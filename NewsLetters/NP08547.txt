Benishek to serve on Veteran Affairs conference committee
Congressman Benishek Attends Agricultural Outlook
U.S. House passes Benishek Alzheimer's research measure
Dear Friends,
Work in Washington continues on reforming the VA and this week I was
humbled to be appointed to the House-Senate Conference Committee to
help iron out the differences between the House and Senate VA reform
bills.
Weather in Washington has been hot and muggy, so I am definitely ready
to head back to Northern Michigan. Looking forward to attending the 5th
Annual Thunder at the River Veterans Motorcycle Rally
in Manistee tomorrow!
Sincerely,
Dan Benishek M.D.
Member of Congress
Michigan's First District
Veterans' Affairs Conference Committee
It is an honor to be one of the 29 Members of Congress chosen to be on
this committee. Please know that we are taking the necessary steps to
find solutions that will improve care for our veterans. We will be
tasked with negotiating the differences between the House passed bill
(H.R. 4810) and the Senate passed bill (H.R. 3230). We are looking to
have legislation agreed upon by both the House and Senate worked out in
the next few weeks, so the President can sign it into law and get our
veterans the care they need and deserve as soon as possible.

Agricultural Outlook Event
Michigan truly is a national leader when it comes to growing the food
Americans eat. Our state is a leader not only in growth, but in crop
diversity as well.
On Saturday, the Michigan Agri-Business Association
held an Agricultural Outlook in Traverse City, where field experts and
producers were able to share their thoughts and concerns about the
upcoming season.
It was a great opportunity for me to learn about the
latest agricultural information so I can best represent Michigan's
interests in Washington.

Here I am accepting an award from Jim Byrum of
the Michigan Agri-Business Association for my work on the enactment of
the Farm Bill
and support of the
Michigan agriculture in Congress.
Alzheimer's Research Funding
I am happy to report that my amendment to the Department of Defense
Appropriations Act of 2015 to increase funding to the Defense Health
Program for Alzheimer's research by $2 million passed unanimously in
the House. As a doctor who treated patients in Northern Michigan for 30
years, I have seen how devastating this disease can be and know that
this is just a small step in achieving the goal of a cure.

I want to hear your thoughts on how to best represent Northern
Michigan, so please call me at 202-225-4735 or send me an email through
my website at www.benishek.house.gov
