Dear Neighbor,
I am taking the next step to defend private property. Last week, I introduced an Amendment to the
Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act . My amendment would require regulatory agencies to complete a &ldquo;Private Property Impact Test&rdquo; to assess the cost of a proposed regulation on private property
I think of it like this, we have environmental impact tests, to assess the communal cost associated with a regulatory action. Why don&rsquo;t we also have private property impact tests to assess the cost borne by individuals due to regulatory action? We can and we should.
It is only fair and really is just common-sense to include such a test; which is why I am proud that my amendment was approved and passed by the House. This is the next step in ensuring that the private property rights of the people of the Southern Tier and Finger lakes are protected and strengthened.
Fighting Hunger through Incentivizing Charity
Hunger is a critical issue that has no easy solution. It is my hope that incentivizing the donation of billions of pounds of food will help towards solving the issue. That is why I introduced the Fighting Hunger Incentive Tax Act, which incentivizes excess food donations to those that need it most.
America is in many ways the land of plenty but for many Americans hunger is a reality. Nearly one in six of our neighbors face the specter of hunger. At yet, over 150 billion pounds of excess food is simply thrown away. It only makes sense that this excess food be donated to our local charities and food banks which provide a crucial link in defeating hunger for those who experience food insecurity.
I have heard from food bank volunteers, farmers, small business employees, and restaurateurs about the positive impact this bill will have on their ability to donate food to the food banks and help their neighbors in need. Instead of wasting perfectly good food, the goal is to have it donated by providing a tax deduction over the cost of goods sold if the food is donated to a charitable organization.
By providing this critical tax deduction, we are incentivizing the donation of food rather than its disposal as with the current code. This bill helps offset the additional costs of packing and transporting the food for donation. And it also provides a critical source of donated inventory for our charitable organizations.
I care deeply about those in need and it is only fair that we put to use perfectly good food to feed and give some measure of relief to those in need. I am happy to see this bill - put with other bills that put people first by incentivizing charity and community goodwill - and head to the House floor this week.
Continuing the Commitment
Last Saturday I held three town hall meetings in the towns of Elmira, Cameron, and Bolivar. This is in keeping with my commitment to hear firsthand from you, the people I represent.
From the 150+ town halls we&rsquo;ve held so far, it&rsquo;s clear the real solutions come from moms and dads, small business employees and our entrepreneurs &ndash; not bureaucrats in Washington. The voices of taxpayers on the ground are the voices we need to be listening to so that we can better care for the places we call home.
At our Elmira Town Hall meeting on Saturday, January 31.

Optical Society of America
I was honored to accept the Optical Society of America's "2015 Advocate of Optics" Award. Optics is a big part of the Hi-Tech manufacturing in upstate NY. It was a pleasure to meet with Tom Baer, Phil Bucksbaum, Chris Schaffer, and Amy Eskilson to discuss legislative initiatives to advance the science of light.
Sincerely,
Tom
