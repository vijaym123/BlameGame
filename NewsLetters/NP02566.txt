Rep. Reed St. Joseph&rsquo;s Press Conference
Last week I held a press Conference at St. Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital in Elmira where I discussed the importance of the Rural Hospitals Access Act and the need to ensure critical funding for rural hospitals. I care about access to health care in rural areas and the bipartisan House and Senate Rural Hospital Access Act is a solid plan to ensure that our hospitals can deliver needed services. This bill would make permanent two important programs for our Southern Tier and Finger Lakes hospitals. It is only fair to the patients that we continue to support these vital programs.
I am pleased to work with St. Joseph&rsquo;s as I work to safeguard access to high quality healthcare close to home. I will fight to defend these programs and ensure that they continue in our rural areas. Access to care is an issue I support. This will hopefully end the cycle of unpredictable funding that has plagued our rural providers. It is only fair that Congress provides a reliable funding stream to our crucial care facilities.
*New York&rsquo;s 23rd Congressional District has three Medicare-dependent hospitals and three low-volume hospitals.*
Continuing the Valentine&rsquo;s for Veterans Tradition
On Saturday the 18 th
I spent the day with veterans at the Bath VA Medical Center. I visited with our Veterans and gave out Valentines hand-made by Corning-Painted Post students. This annual event coincides with National Salute to Veteran Patients Week.
Honoring the commitment our veterans made is what this event is all about. As a son of a WWII and Korean War veteran, I am proud to be a part of this tradition that brings much needed joy to our veterans and teaches students about their sacrifice. To be able to spend time with veterans is a tradition I look forward to each Valentine&rsquo;s Day.
*Reed, Ed Mancini and the Corning-Painted Post School District launched the annual event eight years ago. This year the Corning Rotary Club and officials from Bath and Corning joined in handing out Valentines to veterans at the Bath VA.*
Continuing the Town Hall Tradition
Last week I held five town hall meetings covering issues related to property rights and ISIS. I always look forward to hearing from the people of the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes. Know I am taking your thoughts and suggestions back to Washington. On such important issues as terrorism and national security, it is vital to hear from you.
