Dear Mr. Johnson,
This week, the U.S. House of Representatives, in a 251-166 vote,
approved a nearly $100-billion-a-year farm bill. I know some of the
farm provisions in the bill are extremely important to our farmers, but
I voted against this legislation because it failed to reform the food
stamp program and included farm provisions that harm the poultry
industry on the Eastern Shore. The bill will spend about $950 billion
over 10 years, with $756 billion going toward food stamps.
The House previously passed two separate pieces of legislation-a
freestanding farm bill and a separate food stamp bill. I supported that
House farm bill, which included protection for the poultry industry,
and I supported substantial reforms the House wanted to make to the
food stamp program, including a work-training requirement for
able-bodied adult recipients. The legislation passed this week combined
those two bills, but practically eliminated all of the important
reforms to the food stamp program. The bill reduced only $8 billion
from the food stamp program, a far cry from the $39 billion reduction
in spending from reforms like the work requirement that the House had
proposed.
I support efforts to help our farmers, and I support safety-net
nutrition programs for the hungry in America. Sadly, the combined farm
and food stamp bill failed on both these measures. The farm component
of the bill will harm the poultry industry so important to the economy
on the Eastern Shore-an economy that is barely treading water in this
ongoing recession. Some poultry farmers are concerned about the
retaliation that will follow country-of-origin labeling requirements.
For example, Canada has already threatened to retaliate against U.S.
poultry imports, potentially denying American chicken farmers the
ability to sell their product in that country.
The food stamp program, which has grown 240 percent in only a dozen
years, needed reforms that included work or work-training requirements
for able-bodied adult recipients-but the final bill stripped out those
requirements from the earlier House version. That's why I couldn't
support this week's bill, even though I voted for both the separate
farm bill and the separate food stamp bill when they came to the House
last summer and fall.
The National Chicken Council and other agriculture groups opposed the
final bill as well. If you'd like to read more about why I voted no,
please see my opinion piece in last Sunday's Star Democrat:

Dear
Mr. Johnson,
This
week,
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives,
in
a
251-166
vote,
approved
a
nearly
$100-billion-a-year
farm
bill.
I
know
some
of
the
farm
provisions
in
the
bill
are
extremely
important
to
our
farmers,
but
I
voted
against
this
legislation
because
it
failed
to
reform
the
food
stamp
program
and
included
farm
provisions
that
harm
the
poultry
industry
on
the
Eastern
Shore. The
bill
will
spend
about
$950
billion
over
10
years,
with
$756
billion
going
toward
food
stamps.
The
House
previously
passed
two
separate
pieces
of
legislation&#8212;a
freestanding
farm
bill
and
a
separate
food
stamp
bill.
I
supported
that
House
farm
bill,
which
included
protection
for
the
poultry
industry,
and
I
supported
substantial
reforms
the
House
wanted
to
make
to
the
food
stamp
program,
including
a
work-training
requirement
for
able-bodied
adult
recipients.
The
legislation
passed
this
week
combined
those
two
bills,
but
practically
eliminated
all
of
the
important
reforms
to
the
food
stamp
program. The
bill
reduced
only
$8
billion
from
the
food
stamp
program,
a
far
cry
from
the
$39
billion
reduction
in
spending
from
reforms
like
the
work
requirement
that
the
House
had
proposed.
I
support
efforts
to
help
our
farmers,
and
I
support
safety-net
nutrition
programs
for
the
hungry
in
America.
Sadly,
the
combined
farm
and
food
stamp
bill
failed
on
both
these
measures. The
farm
component
of
the
bill
will
harm
the
poultry
industry
so
important
to
the
economy
on
the
Eastern
Shore&#8212;an
economy that
is
barely
treading
water
in
this
ongoing
recession.
Some
poultry
farmers
are
concerned
about
the
retaliation
that
will
follow
country-of-origin
labeling
requirements. For
example,
Canada
has
already
threatened
to
retaliate
against
U.S.
poultry
imports,
potentially
denying
American
chicken
farmers
the
ability
to
sell
their
product
in
that
country.
The
food
stamp
program,
which
has
grown
240
percent
in only
a
dozen years,
needed
reforms
that
included
work
or
work-training
requirements
for
able-bodied
adult
recipients&#8212;but
the
final
bill
stripped
out
those
requirements
from
the
earlier
House
version.
That's
why
I
couldn't
support
this
week&#8217;s
bill,
even
though
I
voted
for
both
the
separate
farm
bill
and
the
separate
food
stamp
bill
when
they
came
to
the
House
last
summer
and
fall.
The
National
Chicken
Council
and
other
agriculture
groups
opposed
the
final
bill
as
well.
If
you&#8217;d
like
to
read
more
about
why
I
voted
no,
please
see
my
opinion
piece
in
last
Sunday&#8217;s

Democrat :
