One Year Anniversary of the Farm Bill: Making a Difference for ND
Farmers & Ranchers
Growing up in rural North Dakota, agriculture was all around - as it is
for so many families. I remember looking out across the expansive
fields and waving to the farmers on their combines as we drove by in
the shadows of grain bins and elevators. And as I grew older, I began
to realize just how important the entire agriculture industry was to
the livelihoods of families in my own community and throughout our
state and country.
In North Dakota, we know personally the powerful impact of our farmers
and ranchers - they support good jobs, support about a quarter of our
state's economy, and put food on the table that feeds our families as
well as families all across the country and the world. Not everyone
understands the importance of supporting rural America, but North
Dakotans do and so do I.
Even since before joining the Senate, I knew that for our farmers to
succeed and grow the food the world relies on, we had to pass a
long-term Farm Bill to provide them with the resources they need to do
their jobs. And that's exactly what we did a year ago this week. As a
member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, I was proud to help
write, negotiate, and pass this important legislation because I knew
how critical it was to farmers and ranchers in our state. But our work
didn't end 12 months ago.
Now comes an equally-important part:
making sure the 2014 Farm Bill is implemented properly so farmers and
ranchers are able to access the programs and supports to help them do
their jobs. Since the bill was signed into law in February 2014, I've
been working closely with folks on the federal and state levels, making
sure producers are connecting with the resources this Farm Bill
provides. With new risk mitigation tools, investments in research,
support for rural infrastructure, and resources for young families to
get started in farming, the Farm Bill touches nearly every aspect of
rural life.
In North Dakota, production agriculture represents about 25 percent of
our state's economic base. And the livelihoods of 16 million Americans
and their families depend on agriculture. That's why I pushed to
include in the 2014 Farm Bill several provisions that would help
support our state's farmers and ranchers, including making the
livestock disaster programs permanent, preserving the Sugar Program,
and providing historic investments in agricultural research.
And all this week on my Twitter
, Facebook,
and Instagram
pages, I've been highlighting the Farm Bill's
importance to North Dakota and the country and connecting folks with
tools and resources available online. Click here to view a summary on
Storify of my social media posts on the Farm Bill throughout the week

Supporting our ranchers out west and farmers I grew up watching in
Mantador is critical to the success of communities all across our state
and country. But we need to remain engaged and focused to carry this
great work forward in the years ahead. I hope you'll join me in my
continued push to make sure the 2014 Farm Bill works for all our
nation's farmers and ranchers.

One
Year
Anniversary
of
the
Farm
Bill:
Making
a
Difference
for
ND
Farmers
&amp;
Ranchers
Growing
up
in
rural
North
Dakota,
agriculture
was
all
around
&#8211;
as
it
is
for
so
many
families.
I
remember
looking
out
across
the
expansive
fields
and
waving
to
the
farmers
on
their
combines
as
we
drove
by
in
the
shadows
of
grain
bins
and
elevators.
And
as
I
grew
older,
I
began
to
realize
just
how
important
the
entire
agriculture
industry
was
to
the
livelihoods
of
families
in
my
own
community
and
throughout
our
state
and
country.
In
North
Dakota,
we
know
personally
the
powerful
impact
of
our
farmers
and
ranchers
&#8211;
they
support
good
jobs,
support
about
a
quarter
of
our
state&#8217;s
economy,
and
put
food
on
the
table
that
feeds
our
families
as
well
as
families
all
across
the
country
and
the
world.
Not
everyone
understands
the
importance
of
supporting
rural
America,
but
North
Dakotans
do
and
so
do
I.
Even
since
before
joining
the
Senate,
I
knew
that
for
our
farmers
to
succeed
and
grow
the
food
the
world
relies
on,
we
had
to
pass
a
long-term
Farm
Bill
to
provide
them
with
the
resources
they
need
to
do
their
jobs.
And
that&#8217;s
exactly
what
we
did
a
year
ago
this
week.
As
a
member
of
the
Senate
Committee
on
Agriculture,
I
was
proud
to
help
write,
negotiate,
and
pass
this
important
legislation
because
I
knew
how
critical
it
was
to
farmers
and
ranchers
in
our
state.
But
our
work
didn&#8217;t
end
12
months
ago.
Now
comes
an
equally-important
part:
making
sure
the
2014
Farm
Bill
is
implemented
properly
so
farmers
and
ranchers
are
able
to
access
the
programs
and
supports
to
help
them
do
their
jobs.
Since
the
bill
was
signed
into
law
in
February
2014,
I&#8217;ve
been
working
closely
with
folks
on
the
federal
and
state
levels,
making
sure
producers
are
connecting
with
the
resources
this
Farm
Bill
provides.
With
new
risk
mitigation
tools,
investments
in
research,
support
for
rural
infrastructure,
and
resources
for
young
families
to
get
started
in
farming,
the
Farm
Bill
touches
nearly
every
aspect
of
rural
life.
In
North
Dakota,
production
agriculture
represents
about
25
percent
of
our
state&#8217;s
economic
base.
And
the
livelihoods
of
16
million
Americans
and
their
families
depend
on
agriculture.
That&#8217;s
why
I
pushed
to
include
in
the
2014
Farm
Bill
several
provisions
that
would
help
support
our
state&#8217;s
farmers
and
ranchers,
including
making
the
livestock
disaster
programs
permanent,
preserving
the
Sugar
Program,
and
providing
historic
investments
in
agricultural
research.
And
all
this
week
on
my
Twitter ,
Facebook,
and
Instagram
pages,
I&#8217;ve
been
highlighting
the
Farm
Bill&#8217;s
importance
to
North
Dakota
and
the
country
and
connecting
folks
with
tools
and
resources
available
online.

is

But
we
need
to
remain
engaged

to
carry
this
great
work
forward
in

years
ahead.
I

the
2014

works
for
