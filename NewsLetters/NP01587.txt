A secure border should not just be a priority, it should be a reality.
Thats why the House Judiciary Committee passed the Michael Davis, Jr. In Honor of State and Local Law Enforcement Act ( H.R. 1148 ), which is an updated version of the SAFE Act. This bill, which I co-sponsored, removes the Presidents ability to unilaterally shut down immigration enforcement, and strengthens the interior enforcement of our immigration laws by allowing state and local governments to enforce federal immigration law.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. I am also supporting
H.Res.11 , to authorize the House of Representatives to legally determine in federal court whether President Obamas unilateral immigration actions violate the Constitution, and allow the Speaker to seek a declaratory judgment to compel the President to obey our nations immigration laws.
