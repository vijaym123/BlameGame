Dear David,
When he delivers his
State of the Union address tomorrow, President Obama has a lot of
explaining to do.
According to recent reports, the President
plans to use this speech as a kick off for his so-called 'year of
action.' He intends to focus on income inequality leading up to the
midterm elections this year.
What President Obama fails to
acknowledge is that Americans are hurting as a result of his own policies.
Too many of the poorest Americans continue to suffer from stalled job
creation, skyrocketing federal debt, burdensome regulations, and
broken promises on health care reform.
If all the President
has to offer tomorrow is more of the same, or if he refuses to
acknowledge that his own policies have failed to work
the President is
simply doing what many failed leaders have done before him: trying to set
one group of Americans against another group of
Americans.
We dont need more class warfare, and we dont need more interference
from Washington. No government program can replace what a good job
means for the future of a family.
Republicans in Congress
are ready for a 'year of action.' Were ready to enact a pro-growth,
pro-jobs agenda. The House has already passed a number of bills aimed at
jump-starting the economy
bills that are stalled in the Senate
thats controlled by Democrats and Majority Leader Harry
Reid.
President Obama can join us to grow the nations economy and the
nations jobs. Or he can continue pushing for more regulations, more
taxes, higher utility bills, and health care turmoil
bad policies that
hurt poor Americans the most.
Lets hope the President
uses his so-called 'year of action' to have a little less talk, and a lot
more action.
