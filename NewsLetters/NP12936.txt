Dear Friend,
I applaud Mayor Bill de
Blasios call on all of us to embrace the challenge of our day:
reversing the growing tide of income inequality that threatens to put the
American dream beyond the reach of far too many people. We look forward
to President Obamas State of the Union speech next week as he
addresses the fight against income inequality which he has called the defining
challenge of our time.
Why I got arrested:
On Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, I got arrested at a march outside La
Guardia Airport, where I proudly stood with fellow elected officials in
New York and hundreds of airport workers demanding that they be paid
a living wage with benefits. It is an affront to Dr. King's legacy
that New Yorks airport workers are paid less in real wages in 2014 than
the Memphis sanitation workers he was championing in 1968. We must
keep standing up to reclaim an America where working men and women can
reasonably expect to support their families and plan for the future. If
it means getting arrested in an act of civil disobedience
as I and so many of my fellow elected officials in New York
did
then we bear that arrest as a badge of
honor.
Minimum Wage:
We have good news in New York State --
effective Dec. 31, 2013, the state's minimum wage has increased to $8.00 per
hour. In a state with the greatest income inequality gaps between the
rich and the poor, it is imperative that workers get paid a fair wage.
In Congress, I'm a co-sponsor of the Fair Minimum Wage Act, which
would raise the federal minimum wage from its current $7.25 an hour to
$10.10 an hour. This would not just help working families in America
make ends meet, but also would stimulate the consumer spending that
drives our economy.
Unemployment Insurance:
As of
today,
1.6 million Americans, including more than
147,000 New Yorkers, have lost this emergency support.
House
Republicans have blocked multiple efforts by Democrats to bring up
legislation to extend the unemployment insurance benefits on the House
floor. Americans deserve better. It is long past time for Republicans to
drop their obstruction and work with Democrats to renew UI without
further delay.
