Dear Friends,
Last week was a productive and
substantive week in Washington. Below are a few
highlights:
Questioning Sally Jewell at the Interior Subcommittee
Hearing
As a new member of the House Appropriations
Subcommittee on the Interior, I had the opportunity to question Interior
Secretary Sally Jewell during last weeks subcommittee hearing. Once the
congressional budget is approved, the appropriations subcommittees
decide how and where the budgeted money is spent. One of my top
priorities on the Interior subcommittee is to help UT get reimbursed for the
money it used to keep national parks open during last years government
shutdown.
I am happy to report that during last weeks hearing,
Secretary Jewell assured me that she would not block any legislation
that reimbursed UT and states in similar situations. You can read the
Deseret News article
about the hearing
here , and watch the video of our conversation
here .
Ensuring Public
Involvement in the Creation of National Monuments
Act
Im proud to be a co-sponsor of Congressman Bishops
bill , which passed the House last week. This bill would
update the Antiquities Act of 1906 by requiring presidential monument
designations to go through the same environmental review process that
federal agencies, businesses and other entities working on federal lands
must undergo.
This process would be done in an open and
transparent setting and ensures that local communities are involved. This is
extremely important legislation for Utah, as 66% of the land is
federally owned and huge monuments like Utah's Grand Staircase Escalante
were established using the Antiquities Act. I was honored speak on behalf
of this bill on the House Floor; you can watch my speech
here .
