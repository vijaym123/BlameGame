Dear Friends,
Recently, the US House voted on and
passed, in bipartisan fashion, a bill approving the Keystone XL
pipeline.
This bill will not only help bring us closer to our goal of
energy independence, it will also create jobs across our nation and
advance our national security interests.
Over the last few years,
our nation has made significant advances in reducing our dependence on
foreign oil. To further extend on this positive trend, approval and
construction of this pipeline would increase North American production
and bring us closer to total energy independence.
According to
the House Energy and Commerce Committee, this project would create
around 42,000 jobs and add more than $2 billion to our economy.
Not only is Keystone XL an incredible opportunity for
hardworking Americans, it also has great potential to advance our national
security interests and policies around the world.
Our nation is
best served by looking for democratic and market-based partners and
allies, like Canada, who conduct free and fair trade closer to
home.
Canada is already our largest trading partner, a nation whose
interests are closely aligned with ours and an ally that has fought with us
in defense of freedom all over the world.
However, the
continued opposition by liberals to this project threatens to destroy
our advances towards a secure and stable energy future. Time is
of the essence.
Americans cannot afford any more delays of this
project, not when so many jobs and our national security are at stake.
Congress has acted and demonstrated strong, bipartisan support for
Keystone. It is time to put the interests of the American public first
and approve this project once and for all.
Sincerely,
Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen
Member of
Congress
