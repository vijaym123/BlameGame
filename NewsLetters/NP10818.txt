WEEK IN
REVIEW
My thoughts are with those affected by
the tragedy at Fort Hood.
Please keep them in your prayers,
too.
Thanks to all the Arkansans
who were in Washington this week and came by my office, especially
Dontae Bell, the staff assistant from my Rogers office, who spent the
latter half this week shadowing me!
My thanks to the Arkansas
Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, U of As Dr. Timothy Cavell, Alan
Fortenberry and Thad Luther representing the Beaver and Central Arkansas
water districts, the Ouachita National Forest supervisors, Alan Clark and
Greg Smith with the Mid-American Lumbermans Association, Theresa
Gramlich and Art Middleton with the Arkansas Society for Respiratory Care,
Dr. Daniel Fields, the American Occupational Therapy Association,
Teresa Belew, the American Waterways Operators, Gregory Hershel from Fort

Cadet Nathan Weir from Hackett during my visit to West
Point!
I spent Sunday and
Monday of this week at the United States Military Academy at West
Point for the Board of Visitors meeting.
I was appointed as one of
four House members to serve on the board by Speaker John Boehner in
February 2012.
The Board of Visitors has the responsibility of
inquiring into the morale and discipline, curriculum, instruction,
physical equipment, fiscal affairs, academic methods, and other matters of
USMA.
On Monday, I joined
Representatives Bob Goodlatte (VA-6), Jim Costa (CA-16), and Peter Welch
(VT-AL) in sending a letter to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
Administrator Gina McCarthy requesting additional information on the
challenges in implementing the Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS) ethanol
mandate.
This letter is a follow-up to a recent meeting between the
lawmakers and Administrator McCarthy.
In October, we sent a
letter
signed by 169
bipartisan Members of the House of Representatives to the EPA asking
them to lower the ethanol mandate for 2014, and also jointly
introduced
H.R. 1462 , the RFS Reform Act, which eliminates
corn-based ethanol requirements, caps the amount of ethanol that can
be blended into conventional gasoline at 10 percent, and requires the
EPA to set cellulosic biofuels levels at production levels.
You

NASCAR driver Kurt Busch, who won Sundays
race at Martinsville Speedway, came by my office to talk about his
work with the Armed Forces Foundation and what the foundation does to
support our military and our veterans.

On Wednesday, I joined Senator John Boozman, as well as
Congressmen Rick Crawford (AR-1), Tim Griffin (AR-2), and Tom Cotton
(AR-4), in sending a letter to Federal Communications Commission Chairman
Tom Wheeler expressing concern over a potential increase in the rate
floor, which determines the rate small rural carriers charge for
voice services.
The
letter reads, in part, the rate floor mechanism, in effect, offers
certain rural telecom companies money to raise customers phone bills,
with the price increases matched dollar-for-dollar from the federal
universal service fund.
This perverse incentive structure is
negatively impacting rural customers and is skewing the business costs of
investing in the provision of rural
service.
Chairman Wheeler recently testified before the House
Financial Services and General Government Appropriations subcommittee
that the FCC may delay the initial date and phase-in the full rate
increase. However, we remain concerned about the broader negative impacts
the rate floor will have on rural consumers.
The full letter can
be found
here .
In addition to suspensions, on Thursday, the House
passed
H.R. 2575 , the Save American Workers (SAW)
Act, by a vote of 248-179.
H.R. 2575 repeals the 30-hour
definition of full time employee in the Affordable Care Act for purposes of
the employer mandate and replaces it with a 40-hour definition for
full time employee.
If left untouched, Obamacare and its 30-hour
mandate will result in the equivalent of 2.5 million fewer jobs in the
next decade.
Thats unacceptable.
America needs more jobs
not fewer.
Thursday
afternoon, I met with Northside High School Assistant Principal Chris
Carter.
Congrats on being named Arkansass Assistant Principal of the
Year!
On Friday, the House passed
H.R. 1874 , the Pro-Growth Budgeting Actby a
vote of 224-182.
H.R. 1874 requires the Congressional Budget
Office (CBO) to produce a supplemental macroeconomic analysis for major
legislation, which is defined as legislation causing a gross change in
revenue, outlays, deficits, or debt in excess of .25 percent of GDP
within a ten-year window.
In addition to suspensions, the House will consider the FY 2015 budget
resolution as well as two budget reform bills: H.R. 1871, the Baseline
Reform Act of 2013, and H.R. 1872, the Budget and Accounting
Transparency Act of 2014.
