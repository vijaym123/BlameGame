Update from Congressman Scott Tipton
Dear Friend,
With the endless problems, increased costs, and delays we continue to
see with the President's un-Affordable Care Act, it's clear that the
law has fallen far short of providing accessible and affordable
healthcare.
There is no question that we can and should provide affordable and
accessible care to every American. But, unfortunately, we're not there
yet.
To get there, it's going to take innovation and reform built on the
foundation that the patient-not government-comes first. We're going to
have to replace the President's healthcare law.
This week, the Healthcare Leadership Council, a coalition of national
healthcare leaders dedicated to making affordable, high-quality care
accessible to all Americans, presented me with the Champion of
Healthcare Innovation award during a ceremony at the U.S. Capitol. I
was honored to receive the award and truly inspired by the group of
healthcare professionals behind it, who every day, are on the front
lines of finding new ways to save and improve lives. They, like us,
understand that in order for a healthcare system to work it must be
patient-centered.
I am working to advance alternative solutions to the President's
healthcare law based on this patients-first approach to bring about
affordable and accessible care for all Americans.
The solution I support would allow for portability and pooling of
insurance coverage, and ensure coverage of pre-existing conditions. I
believe that this can be achieved through a market-driven approach that
incentivizes enrollment with affordable access to quality care without
forcing people to buy insurance they may not want through a mandate.
This approach must also enact comprehensive tort reform to protect
patients while preventing frivolous lawsuits. The healthcare solution I
support would encourage the hiring of more doctors and other providers,
not more IRS agents and bureaucrats. Finally, the solution I support
would reward innovation in the healthcare delivery system-driving down
costs, while enhancing the overall quality of care.
There are a number of good alternatives to the President's healthcare
law that have been introduced in the House of Representatives. One such
solution that I believe is a good starting point is the Empowering
Patients First Act (H.R. 2300). I have co-sponsored this bill and
invite you to take a look at it
, and share your thoughts with me.
I believe we can have truly affordable and accessible healthcare for
all Americans, and am dedicated to continuing to work to get us there.
Sincerely,
In Case You Missed It

Update
from
Congressman
Scott
Tipton
Dear
Friend,
With
the
endless
problems,
increased
costs,
and
delays
we
continue
to
see
with
the
President&#8217;s
un-Affordable
Care
Act,
it&#8217;s
clear
that
the
law
has
fallen
far
short
of
providing
accessible
and
affordable
healthcare.
There
is
no
question
that
we
can
and
should
provide
affordable
and
accessible
care
to
every
American.
But,
unfortunately,
we&#8217;re
not
there
yet.
To
get
there,
it&#8217;s
going
to
take
innovation
and
reform
built
on
the
foundation
that
the
patient&#8212;not
government&#8212;comes
first.
We&#8217;re
going
to
have
to
replace
the
President&#8217;s
healthcare
law.
This
week,
the
Healthcare
Leadership
Council,
a
coalition
of
national
healthcare
leaders
dedicated
to
making
affordable,
high-quality
care
accessible
to
all
Americans,
presented
me
with
the
Champion
of
Healthcare
Innovation
award
during
a
ceremony
at
the
U.S.
Capitol.
I
was
honored
to
receive
the
award
and
truly
inspired
by
the
group
of
healthcare
professionals
behind
it,
who
every
day,
are
on
the
front
lines
of
finding
new
ways
to
save
and
improve
lives.
They,
like
us,
understand
that
in
order
for
a
healthcare
system
to
work
it
must
be
patient-centered.
I
am
working
to
advance
alternative
solutions
to
the
President&#8217;s
healthcare
law
based
on
this
patients-first
approach
to
bring
about
affordable
and
accessible
care
for
all
Americans.
The
solution
I
support
would
allow
for
portability
and
pooling
of
insurance
coverage,
and
ensure
coverage
of
pre-existing
conditions.
I
believe
that
this
can
be
achieved
through
a
market-driven
approach
that
incentivizes
enrollment
with
affordable
access
to
quality
care
without
forcing
people
to
buy
insurance
they
may
not
want
through
a
mandate.
This
approach
must
also
enact
comprehensive
tort
reform
to
protect
patients
while
preventing
frivolous
lawsuits.
The
healthcare
solution
I
support
would
encourage
the
hiring
of
more
doctors
and
other
providers,
not
more
IRS
agents
and
bureaucrats.
Finally,
the
solution
I
support
would
reward
innovation
in
the
healthcare
delivery
system&#8212;driving
down
costs,
while
enhancing
the
overall
quality
of
care.
There
are
a
number
of
good
alternatives
to
the
President&#8217;s
healthcare
law
that
have
been
introduced
in
the
House
of
Representatives.
One
such
solution
that
I
believe
is
a
good
starting
point
is
the
Empowering
Patients
First
Act
(H.R.
2300).
I
have
co-sponsored
this
bill
and
invite
you
to
take
a
look
at
it ,
and
share
your
thoughts
with
me.
I
believe
we
can
have
truly
affordable
and
accessible
healthcare
for
all
Americans,
and
am
dedicated
to
continuing
to
work
to
get
us
there.
