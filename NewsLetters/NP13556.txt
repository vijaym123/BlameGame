Dear
Friend,
It was a busy last few weeks in Washington. I
had a chance to question Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen
Sebelius about the continuing issues with the implementation of
ObamaCare and possible problems that are on the horizon. I also voted
against the most recent budget deal because it spends more today and puts
off savings for almost a decade. We cant just keep passing the buck to
future generations.
I want to keep you up to date on
what is going on, so please click on the links below to learn
more!
I also want to get your opinion so be sure to answer the poll
question on the right.
