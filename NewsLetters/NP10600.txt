Dear friend,
This week brought
some great news
for New Hampshire and North
Country veterans when Senator Kelly Ayotte and I announced that the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will open two VA health care sites in
Colebrook and Berlin. This long-awaited news will mean that veterans
in the North Country, who for too long have faced long commutes across
New Hampshire for basic health care services, will finally have two
local health care clinics to get the care they
need.
In New Hampshire veterans make up approximately 10 percent of our
population and we need to make sure that each of our veterans has access to
the quality health care that he or she deserves. I have met and heard
from dozens of veterans in Coos County who have had to travel more
than two or three hours to get to medical centers for their
appointments, often dealing with inclement weather and hazardous road conditions.
Thats unacceptable. We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the men
and women who have served in uniform, which is why I have consistently
worked to expand and improve access to health care services for New
Hampshires veteran community.
The establishment of VA
health care sites has been an ongoing effort for many years, and
finally North Country veterans will have the access to the care they need
and that we have promised them they would get. The Colebrook and
Berlin VA clinics will truly make a difference, helping to serve more than
2,500 veterans in local and surrounding areas once they
open.
I look forward to continue working with the VA and the New
Hampshire delegation to get these clinics up and running as soon as
possible and will continue working to support our
veterans.
Sincerely,
Jeanne Shaheen
