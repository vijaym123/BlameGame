Toward a "Pay It Forward" Budget
Dear Friend,
As the late Speaker Tip O'Neill used to say, the budget we write in
Congress is more than dollars and cents - it's a clear statement of our
priorities as a nation.
Many of us grew up in a time when our parents and our politicians
weren't afraid to invest in us, and in our country. And we've
benefitted greatly because they did.
Thanks to Medicare, we have almost doubled life expectancy in America
in a little over a generation. Thanks to our national highway system,
virtually every city and town in America is connected, creating jobs
and building the strongest economy and middle class in the history of
the world. The list of investments past generations have made in us
goes on and on.
Now our obligation - our priority - must be to pay those investments
forward for future generations.
Yet last week, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and the
Majority proposed a budget that turns America backwards - cutting
Medicare, education, Head Start, highways, food and nutrition programs,
research and development for health, technology, and clean energy -
generations of investments others made to help assure our individual
and collective success.
I hope you will take a minute to watch me convey this message to my
colleagues on the House Floor:
We need a budget that acknowledges the foundations of our success, and
shows our gratitude by paying it forward. I'll continue to work toward
that end.
Sincerely,

Standing Up for U.S. Sugar Growers
Rep. Nolan questioning U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack during
last week's meeting of the House Committee on Agriculture.
International trade agreements should never force U.S. companies,
producers, or workers to compete against cheap foreign products that
are, in many cases, subsidized by their governments. At a House
Agriculture Committee meeting last week, I stood up for Minnesota sugar
growers on this issue, pointing out to the U.S. Secretary of
Agriculture, Tom Vilsack, that with sugar prices at a two-year low, we
simply must do something to come to the aid of local producers
victimized by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with
Mexico and Canada. According to the growers, the Mexican sugar industry
has flooded the American market with cheap, government-subsidized
sugar, dropping the price of American sugar by half and seriously
jeopardizing the future of our own commodities market. American sugar
producers have taken action to defend themselves by filing a petition
with the International Trade Commission. As I put it to the Secretary
Vilsack, the sugar industry didn't have any alternative - they need our
help. The Secretary pledged to look into this issue. I assure you I
will follow up to ensure that he does. Click here

Bio-Based (Wood) Products Help Move Rural America Forward
Rep. Nolan discussing the benefits of wood-based products with U.S.
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack during last week's House Committee on
Agriculture meeting.
I'm delighted to see the new good work the Department of Agriculture
(USDA) is undertaking, thanks to my amendment to the Farm Bill
requiring the USDA to promote the benefits of wood products for its
many uses - from building materials and biofuels, to optical technology
and protective armor. During the same Agriculture Committee meeting
mentioned above, the Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack, and I had a
good discussion about the great potential these products have in
bringing new industries to rural communities, creating new jobs and
boosting our rural economies. Along with tourism and taconite, the wood
and timber industries are critical to our Minnesota economy, and our
ability to keep our communities prosperous and help them grow. Click

Supreme Court: Our Political Process is For Sale
Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court opened another door to allow wealthy
and powerful individuals to pour even more outside money into the
system, further undermining the voices of the regular folks our
democracy was founded to represent. Specifically, the court struck down
previously-set limits on the total amount of money an individual can
contribute to political candidates, underscoring once again the need to
overturn Citizens United, a 2010 Supreme Court decision that opened the
flood gates to big corporations and moneyed special interests. That is
the point of the House Resolution I introduced last year, to amend our
Constitution by stating - unequivocally - that corporations are not
people and money is not free speech. This recent Supreme Court ruling
reminds us that we must continue to work all the harder to send the
message that enough is enough: the American people must not permit this
continued corruption and perversion of our system.

Scammers Target Seniors at Tax Time
Telephone scammers are targeting our seniors and their families, and
tax time is prime time for these criminals. Knowledge, planning, and
preparation are absolutely necessary in order to protect yourself
against these schemes, and so with that in mind, I recently produced a
special "Nolan Report" for seniors and the elderly to learn what they
can do to defend themselves against unscrupulous telemarketers, direct
mail offers, phony "miracle" drugs, IRS fraud, and more. Take a moment
to page through my newsletter here
or by clicking the image above. In the meantime, I have
co-sponsored two important pieces of bipartisan legislation to help
pull the rug out from underneath crooks who attempt to victimize
seniors out of their hard-earned money - the Seniors Fraud Prevention
Act, to help assure faster action from federal agencies in charge of
investigating and prosecuting fraud complaints, and the Protecting
Seniors from Health Care Fraud Act to ensure the FBI, the Attorney
General, and other federal agencies better coordinate in their efforts.
Please remember, my staff and I are here to help on this or on any
matter of concern to you - I do hope you'll find our newsletter helpful!

Our Week in Pictures
I welcomed the Taiwan Representative (Ambassador) to the United States,
Shen Lyushun, to Washington last week at a reception celebrating our
two countries' long history of political and economic fellowship.
A group of Greenway High School students from Coleraine, MN, met with
me in my D.C. office as part of their Close Up program's trip to
Washington.
A former State Senator from the Iron Range, Bob Lessard, was in
Washington last week, and stopped by my office for a chat on how we
best protect Minnesota's precious natural resources. Great to see such
a terrific public servant again!

Coming Up in Washington
At some point this week (probably Wednesday or Thursday), the House of
Representatives expects to vote on the Ryan Budget to fund the
government for Fiscal Year 2015. As I said earlier, we need a
pro-growth, pro-jobs budget, one that invests in education,
transportation, health, and new technologies. Rather than improve upon
these foundations of our prosperity, however, the Ryan Budget sets us
back by cutting funding for programs such as early childhood education,
health care, transportation, and community development. It also ends
Medicare as we know it. I will keep you posted as debate proceeds on
this yearly battle over our nation's priorities.

Finally...
Calling All High School Artists!
Our 2013 winner, Caroline Kriske of Duluth, with me in our D.C. office.

Report
from
Representative
Rick
Nolan
Toward
a
"Pay
It
Forward"
Budget
Dear
Friend,
As
the
late
Speaker
Tip
O&#8217;Neill
used
to
say,
the
budget
we
write
in
Congress
is
more
than
dollars
and
cents
&#8211;
it&#8217;s
a
clear
statement
of
our
priorities
as
a
nation .
Many
of
us
grew
up
in
a
time
when
our
parents
and
our
politicians
weren&#8217;t
afraid
to
invest
in
us ,
and
in
our
country.
And
we&#8217;ve
benefitted
greatly
because
they
did.
Thanks
to
Medicare,
we
have
almost
doubled
life
expectancy
in
America
in
a
little
over
a
generation.
Thanks
to
our
national
highway
system,
virtually
every
city
and
town
in
America
is
connected,
creating
jobs
and
building
the
strongest
economy
and
middle
class
in
the
history
of
the
world.
The
list
of
investments
past
generations
have
made
in
us
goes
on
and
on.
Now
our
obligation
-
our
priority
&#8211;
must
be
to
pay
those
investments
forward
for
future
generations .
Yet
last
week,
House
Budget
Committee
Chairman
Paul
Ryan
and
the
Majority
proposed
a
budget
that
turns
America
backwards
&#8211;
cutting
Medicare,
education,
Head
Start,
highways,
food
and
nutrition
programs,
research
and
development
for
health,
technology, and
clean
energy
-
generations
of
investments
others
made
to
help
assure
our
individual
and
collective
success.
I
hope
you
will
take
a
minute
to
watch
me
convey
this
message
to
my
colleagues
on
the
House
Floor:
We
need
a
budget
that
acknowledges
the
foundations
of
our
success,
and
shows
our
gratitude
by
paying
it
forward.
I&#8217;ll
continue
to
work
toward
that
end.
Sincerely,

U.S.
Sugar
Growers
Rep.
Nolan
questioning U.S.
Agriculture
Secretary Tom
Vilsack during
last
week's
meeting
of
the
House
Committee
on
Agriculture.
International
trade
agreements
should
never
force
U.S.
companies,
producers,
or
workers
to
compete
against
cheap
foreign
products
that
are,
in
many

subsidized

a House
Agriculture
Committee
meeting last

I
stood
up
for
Minnesota
sugar
growers
on
this
issue ,
pointing
out
to
the
U.S.
Secretary
of
Agriculture, Tom
Vilsack, that
with
sugar
prices at
a
two-year
low, we
simply
must
do

of
local

victimized

the
North
American

According
to the growers,
the
Mexican
sugar
industry has flooded
the
American
market
with
cheap,
government-subsidized
sugar,
dropping
the
price
of
American
sugar
by
half
and
seriously

future
of
our
own
commodities
market. American
sugar
producers
have
taken
action
to
defend
themselves
by
filing
a

with
the
International
Trade
Commission. As
I
put
it
to
the
Secretary
Vilsack,
the
sugar
industry
didn't
have
any
alternative
-
they
need
our
help .
The
Secretary
pledged
to
look
into
this
issue.
I
assure
you
I
will
follow
up
to
ensure
that
he
does.

the
benefits
of
wood-based
products
with
U.S.
Agriculture
Secretary Tom
Vilsack during
last
week's
House
Committee
on
Agriculture
meeting.
I'm delighted
to
see
the
new
good
work
the Department

During
the
same
Agriculture
Committee
meeting
mentioned
above,
the
Secretary
of
Agriculture,
Tom
Vilsack,
and
I
had
a
good
discussion
about
the
great
potential
these
products
have
in bringing
new
industries to rural
communities ,
creating
new jobs
and
boosting
our
rural economies . Along
with
tourism
and
taconite, the
wood
and
timber
industries
are critical
to our
Minnesota
economy,
and
our
ability
to keep
our communities
prosperous
and help
them
grow. Click

Supreme
Court:
Our
Political
Process
is
For
Sale
Last
week,
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
opened
another
door
to
allow
wealthy
and
powerful
individuals
to
pour
even
more
outside
money
into
the
system,
further
undermining
the
voices
of
the
regular
folks
our
democracy
was
founded
to

Specifically,
the
court
struck
down
previously-set
limits
on
the
total
amount
of
money
an
individual
can
contribute
to
political
candidates,
underscoring
once
again
the
need
to
overturn
Citizens
United,
a
2010
Supreme
Court
decision
that
opened
the
flood
gates
to
big
corporations
and
moneyed
special

is
the

of

introduced
last
year,
to
amend
our
Constitution
by
stating
-
unequivocally
- that
corporations
are
not
people
and
money
is
not

This
recent
Supreme
Court
ruling
reminds
us
that
we
must
continue
to
work
all
the

to
send the
message
that
enough
is
enough: the
American
people
must
not
permit
this
continued corruption

perversion of
