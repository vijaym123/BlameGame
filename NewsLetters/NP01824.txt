A Weekly e-Newsletter from
Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA)
March 20, 2015
Dear Friends,
This week, the Senate debated hundreds of amendments related to the
federal budget. The Budget Resolution that passed the Senate in the
early hours of this morning led by the Republican Majority is the first
step in a new direction for Washington: a leaner, more effective and
less intrusive federal government. It balances the budget over 10 years
by controlling spending and reducing the deficit. It supports economic
growth and more opportunity for hardworking families while protecting
those who truly need help. It also allows us to repeal Obamacare, which
has been a drain on the finances of both our nation and individuals'
pocketbooks, and replace it with patient-centered reforms that give
Americans the freedom to get better health care at a lower cost.
In the last election, the American people sent a clear message that
they will no longer tolerate the federal spending spree in Washington.
It is time we demanded that our government should do for taxpayers the
same thing all Americans have had to do for themselves and their
families: set priorities, find ways to save money, and live within our
means.
I will continue to work to cut wasteful spending and demand fiscal
responsibility from the federal government. I look forward to leading
our nation back in the right direction with a more efficient, effective
and accountable government.
Expansion of the Veterans' Choice Program
This week, Secretary McDonald responded directly to concerns voiced by
my colleagues and me to ensure reforms made to the Department of
Veterans Affairs through the Veterans' Choice Program are working for
all veterans across the nation
. I also appreciate the
commonsense adjustment to the "40-mile" rule announced this week that
has the
potential to greatly increase the
success of the Veterans' Choice Program.
This change will allow the 40-mile provision to be calculated by
driving distance instead of "as the crow flies"
and will significantly increase the number
of veterans who can take advantage of this program. For elderly, ill or
disabled veterans, traveling long distances to Veterans' Affairs
medical centers can be difficult or impossible. Veterans deserve the
highest-quality health care, and should not be denied this right simply
because of where they live.
At a Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing I chaired on Tuesday to
address this issue, I called on the VA to stop making excuses and act
quickly to implement this commonsense interpretation of the Veterans'
Choice distance criteria to allow all veterans better access to health
care.
End Opioid Over-Prescription Now
Yesterday at another Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing, we
heard from the Department of Veterans Affairs about their ongoing
efforts to end the all-too-common practice of over-prescription of
opioid drugs to veterans throughout the VA healthcare system.
To give you a better idea of the scope of the problem, 145,000
Americans have died from an over-prescription or over-consumption of
opiates in the last 10 years. The prescribing rate has become so high
that there were enough opiates prescribed last year to provide one in
every six Americans with a full-year prescription.
At the hearing, I asked the VA Interim Undersecretary for Health to
help the VA Committee identify changes that should be made in order to
allow the VA to properly and quickly respond to violations committed
made by employees. As chair of the Senate VA Committee, I will take the
steps necessary to ensure the VA can be run in a responsive way and
make sure our veterans are receiving the highest-quality health care.
Repeal the Death Tax
As we work toward a complete overhaul of our broken tax code, I
continue my push to permanently repeal the "death tax."
Once again, I co-sponsored legislation called
the Death Tax Repeal Act of 2015
that would finally put an end to this
punishing tax that hits families who have just lost a loved one. Far
too often, families are forced to sell the farm or the family business
just to pay the tax.
This legislation is good for both middle class families and small
businesses, and it's good for our economy.
Family Friendly and Workplace Flexibility Act
I recently introduced the Family Friendly and Workplace Flexibility Act
that will allow hardworking Americans the
flexibility required to meet the needs of their family while also
allowing them to adequately meet the needs of their employers. The
legislation, which I introduced along with Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., would allow workers to
voluntarily arrange "flex-hours" or "comp time" with their employers
for overtime work, rather than monetary compensation if they so choose,
allowing them the same flexibility extended to hourly workers in the
public sector.
Stopping Union Work on Taxpayers' Dime
I spoke with FOX News this week about legislation I co-sponsored that
would restrict the ability of federal employees to conduct as much
union-related business as they
want while they are on the
government payroll. Watch the piece on my website here
to learn more about
this unacceptable practice.
The Federal Employee Accountability Act
would help ensure that taxpayer dollars are
not being used for union activities that should instead be conducted
during the employees' paid time off, as would be demanded in the
private sector.
What's on Tap?
I will be home back in Georgia for the next two weeks while the Senate
adjourns in observance of Easter and Passover. I look forward being in
Georgia and meeting with many of you during this time. When the Senate
returns, we will consider bipartisan legislation to protect Medicare
beneficiaries' access to their doctors by reforming the flawed payment
system used to determine Medicare physician reimbursement fees.
Sincerely,
Johnny Isakson

Dear
Friends,
This
week,
the
Senate
debated
hundreds
of
amendments
related
to
the
federal
budget.
The
Budget
Resolution
that
passed
the
Senate
in
the
early
hours
of
this
morning
led
by
the
Republican
Majority
is
the
first
step
in
a
new
direction
for
Washington:
a
leaner,
more
effective
and
less
intrusive
federal
government.
It
balances
the
budget
over
10
years
by
controlling
spending
and
reducing
the
deficit.
It
supports
economic
growth
and
more
opportunity
for
hardworking
families
while
protecting
those
who
truly
need
help.
It
also
allows
us
to
repeal
Obamacare,
which
has
been
a
drain
on
the
finances
of
both
our
nation
and
individuals'
pocketbooks,
and
replace
it
with
patient-centered
reforms
that
give
Americans
the
freedom
to
get
better
health
care
at
a
lower
cost.
In
the
last
election,
the
American
people
sent
a
clear
message
that
they
will
no
longer
tolerate
the
federal
spending
spree
in
Washington.
It
is
time
we
demanded
that
our
government
should
do
for
taxpayers
the
same
thing
all
Americans
have
had
to
do
for
themselves
and
their
families:
set
priorities,
find
ways
to
save
money,
and
live
within
our
means.
I
will
continue
to
work
to
cut
wasteful
spending
and
demand
fiscal
responsibility
from
the
federal
government.
I
look
forward
to
leading
our
nation
back
in
the
right
direction
with
a
more
efficient,
effective
and
accountable
government.
Expansion
of
the
Veterans'
Choice
Program
This
week,
Secretary
McDonald
responded
directly
to
concerns
voiced
by
my
colleagues
and
me to
ensure
reforms
made
to
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
through
the
Veterans'
Choice
Program
are
working
for
all
veterans
across
the
nation .
I
also
appreciate
the
commonsense
adjustment
to
the
"40-mile"
rule
announced
this
week
that
has
the
potential
to
greatly
increase
the
success
of
the
Veterans'
Choice
Program.
This
change
will
allow
the
40-mile
provision
to
be
calculated
by
driving
distance
instead
of
"as
the
crow
flies"
and
will
significantly
increase
the
number
of
veterans
who
can
take
advantage
of
this
program.
For
elderly,
ill
or
disabled
veterans,
traveling
long
distances
to
Veterans'
Affairs
medical
centers
can
be
difficult
or
impossible.
Veterans
deserve
the
highest-quality
health
care,
and
should
not
be
denied
this
right
simply
because
of
where
they
live.
At
a
Senate
Veterans'
Affairs
Committee
hearing
I
chaired
on
Tuesday
to
address
this
issue,
I
called
on
the
VA
to
stop
making
excuses
and
act
quickly
to
implement
this
commonsense
interpretation
of
the
Veterans'
Choice
distance
criteria
to
allow
all
veterans
better
access
to
health
care.
End
Opioid
Over-Prescription
Now
Yesterday
at
another
Senate
Veterans'
Affairs
Committee
hearing,
we
heard
from
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
about
their
ongoing
efforts
to
end
the
all-too-common
practice
of
over-prescription
of
opioid
drugs
to
veterans
throughout
the
VA
healthcare
system.
To
give
you
a
better
idea
of
the
scope
of
the
problem,
145,000
Americans
have
died
from
an
over-prescription
or
over-consumption
of
opiates
in
the
last
10
years.
The
prescribing
rate
has
become
so high
that
there
were
enough
opiates
prescribed
last
year
to
provide
one
in
every
six
Americans
with
a
full-year prescription.
At
the
hearing,
I
asked
the
VA
Interim
Undersecretary
for
Health
to
help
the
VA
Committee
identify
changes
that
should
be
made
in
order
to
allow
the
VA
to
properly
and
quickly
respond
to
violations
committed made
by
employees.
As
chair
of
the
Senate
VA
Committee,
I
will
take
the
steps
necessary
to
ensure
the
VA
can
be
run
in
a
responsive
way
and
make
sure
our
veterans
are
receiving
the
highest-quality
health
care.
Repeal
the
Death
Tax
As
we
work
toward
a
complete
overhaul
of
our
broken
tax
code,
I
continue
my
push
to
permanently
repeal
the
"death
tax."
Once
again,
I
co-sponsored
legislation
called
the
Death
Tax
Repeal
Act
of
2015
that
would
finally
put
an
end
to
this
punishing
tax that
hits families who
have
just
lost a
loved
one.
Far
too
often,
families
are
forced
to
sell
the
farm
or
the
family
business
just
to
pay
the
tax.
This
legislation
is
good
for
both
middle
class
families
and
small
businesses,
and
it's
good
for
our
economy.
Family
Friendly
and
Workplace
Flexibility
Act
I
recently
introduced
the
Family
Friendly
and
Workplace
Flexibility
Act
that
will
allow
hardworking
Americans
the
flexibility
required
to
meet
the
needs
of
their
family
while
also
allowing
them
to
adequately
meet
the
needs
of
their
employers.
The
legislation,
which
I
introduced
along
with
Majority
Leader
Mitch
McConnell,
R-Ky.,
and
Sen.
Kelly
Ayotte,
R-N.H.,
would
allow
workers
to
voluntarily
arrange
"flex-hours"
or
"comp
time"
with
their
employers
for
overtime
work,
rather
than
monetary
compensation
if
they
so
choose,
allowing
them
the
same
flexibility
extended
to
hourly
workers
in
the
public
sector.
Stopping
Union
Work
on
Taxpayers'
Dime
I
spoke
with
FOX
News this
week about
legislation
I
co-sponsored
that
would
restrict
the
ability
of
federal
employees
to
conduct
as
much
union-related
business
as
they
want
while
they
are
on
the
government
payroll.
Watch
the
piece
on
my
website
here
to
learn
more
about
this
unacceptable
practice.
The
Federal
Employee
Accountability
Act
would
help
ensure
that
taxpayer
dollars
are
not
being
used
for
union
activities
that
should
instead
be
conducted
during
the
employees'
paid
time
off,
as
would
be
demanded
in
the
private
sector.
What's
on
Tap?
I
will
be
home
back
in
Georgia
for
the
next
two
weeks
while
the
Senate
adjourns
in
observance
of
Easter
and
Passover.
I
look
forward
being
in
Georgia
and
meeting
with
many
of
you
during
this
time.
When
the
Senate
returns,
we
will
consider
bipartisan legislation
to
protect
Medicare
beneficiaries'
access
to
their
doctors
by
reforming
the
flawed
payment
system
used
to
determine
Medicare
physician
reimbursement
fees.
