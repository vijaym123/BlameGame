Dear
Friend,
The IRS recently issued a warning about a phone
scam that is targeting people across the nation. Callers, claiming to be
from the IRS, tell intended victims they owe taxes and must pay using
a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer. The scammers threaten those
who refuse to pay with arrest or the loss of a business or drivers
license.
The callers who commit this fraud
often:
Use fake IRS badge numbers.
Know the last four
digits of the victims Social Security number and other personal
information.
Make caller ID appear as if the IRS is
calling.
Send fake IRS emails as
follow-ups.
Call a second time claiming to be the police or the Department of Motor
Vehicles.
If you get a call from someone claiming to
be with the IRS asking for a payment, you should immediately report
the incident to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration
at 800-366-4484. You may also file a complaint with the Federal Trade
Commission
here .
In addition, the IRS
has identified eleven other scams on its annual list of the Dirty
Dozen tax scams; the full list can be found
here .
Always be alert for phone and email scams that use the IRS
name. The IRS will never request personal or financial information by
email, texting or social media. You should forward suspected scam
emails to
phishing@irs.gov .
I am honored
to serve in Congress on behalf of Utah families like yours. As your
representative, I always appreciate hearing from you on current topics
and issues affecting you and our community.
Please let me
know areas you find especially interesting or where I can provide
you with additional information.
I value your ideas and look
forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
U.S. Representative
4th District of
Utah
