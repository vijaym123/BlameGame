7th
DISTRICT
March 13, 2015
Dear Friend,
With the House not in Session, I have been busy back in the
district this week.
It has been a great opportunity to meet with
many constituents and local organizations and to attend numerous
events.
This weekend, Saturday,
March 14th, I have invited Orlando Magic players to Bithlo to meet
with local youth.
We will highlight efforts to increase opportunity
in that community.
Hot dogs, ice cream and other refreshments
will be provided.
The event will take place from 11 a.m. to 1
p.m. at Transformation Village, 18415 11th Avenue, Orlando (Bithlo).
Everyone is welcome to this free community event, so invite your
friends and neighbors with children to join us.
Prior to that, at 9:30 a.m., I will be
participating at the opening ceremonies of the 14th Annual Youth
Celebration of the Arts at Gemini Springs Park, located at 37 Dirksen Drive,
DeBary.
This exciting youth-centered event will run until 4:30
p.m. and will include visual and performing arts from some of our local
schools, a Kids Arts Alley, food trucks and
games.
Winding up a busy week in the district has
provided me an opportunity to address and update local civic clubs on my
activities and work in Washington and to meet with state and local
community leaders on transportation projects important to the
community.
On Monday, I return to
Washington and greet 400 Lake Brantley High School students visiting
our Nations Capital before joining my colleagues to address the
important challenges facing our
nation.
You can follow my efforts on Facebook at
www.facebook.com/JohnMica or on our 7th Congressional District website,
www.Mica.House.Gov.
With my regards and
best wishes, I
remain
Sincerely,
John L.
Mica
Member of Congress
