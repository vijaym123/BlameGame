CALLING ALL INTERNS!

Summer
Session I: May 25, 2015 - July 3, 2015

A Congressional internship is a rewarding experience, and

those interested in political science, government, public policy,
business, and social work to apply.

available
on my
website . For more information, please call (202)

WEEK IN REVIEW
In 2010,
Congressman Alan Nunnelee and I were both elected to Congress and were two
of the three freshman members placed on the House Committee on
Appropriations. On Monday, it was with a heavy heart that I joined our House
colleagues and his family, friends, and constituents to lay him to
rest. It was an honor to know and serve with Alan. May he rest in
peace.
On Wednesday, the House
passed
S.
1 , the Keystone XL Pipeline Approval Act, by a vote of
270-152. (See
Roll Call
#75 ) S. 1 authorizes the construction,
connection, operation, and maintenance of the Keystone XL pipeline. The bill
also ensures private property protections in construction of the
pipeline, requires adequate consultation with Indian nations, and includes a
number of provisions to improve energy efficiency with respect to
commercial buildings and grid-enabled water heaters.
It has been six long years since the initial
Keystone application was submitted. Americans are ready to build, and the
House has shown time-and-time again that we are ready, too. The
passage of S. 1 not only supports jobs creation and an all-of-the-above
energy policy critical to Americas success by finally approving the
Keystone XL, but it also marks the turning of a page towards smart,
bipartisan workings with the newly-led Senate. President Obama has no
more excuses, and I urge him to work with us and sign this commonsense,
bipartisan bill into law.
On Thursday, the House passed
H.R. 644 , the America Gives More Act of 2015, by a vote
of 279-137. (See
Roll Call
#80 ) H.R. 644 includes a package of four bills reported
by the Ways and Means Committee that would improve and make permanent
a number of tax rules governing charitable donations and charitable
organizations. This package includes provisions that
make permanent the enhanced deduction for contributions of food inventory by
any type of business, allow tax-free distributions from Individual
Retirement Arrangements (IRAs) for charitable purposes,
allow the temporary deduction for contributions of conservation easements, and
amend the Internal Revenue Code to set the excise tax rate on net
investment income of private foundations at 1
percent.
On Friday, the House passed
H.R. 636 , the
America's Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2015, by a vote of 272-142.
(See
Roll Call
#82 ) H.R. 636 permanently extends Code section 179 expensing at 2014
levels, allowing taxpayers to expense up to $500,000 of investments
in new equipment and property per year, with the deduction phased out
for investments exceeding $2,000,000 (with both amounts indexed for
inflation). Moreover, H.R. 636 restores and makes permanent rules
allowing computer software and certain investments in real property to
qualify for section 179 expensing, allows investments in air conditioning
and heating units to qualify for section 179 expensing, and makes
permanent both the five-year recognition period during which an S
corporation is subject to an entity-level tax at the highest corporate rate on
certain built-in gain of property that it held while operating a C
corporation and the basis-adjustment rule for S corporation shareholders.
I applaud the passage of this bill and the steps the House continues
to take to support job creation. Arkansas farmers and small
business owners need to have faith in a stable tax code so they can focus on
growing and investing in their businesses,
instead of changing
goalposts.
To wrap up this edition of From the Front I would like to
thank all of the Arkansans who were in Washington this week and
stopped by my office, including the Arkansas Rice Producers, Bruce Appel and
Tinatra Carr of Fayetteville, the Arkansas Prosecutors, Don Marr of
Fayetteville, the Arkansas Fraternal Order of Police, Russell Holt and
David Varner of Springdale, the Pulp and Paperworkers' Resource
Council, General Berry and members of the Arkansas National Guard, the
Arkansas Rural Water Association, Dr. Jorgenson of NorthWest Arkansas
Community College (NWACC), the Arkansas Education Association, Sandy
Stroope of Harrison, Dr. English with the University of Arkansas College of
Engineering, and the Schultz family of Arkadelphia! Great to see you,
and safe travels home!
Next week, the House will have its first district work period
of the 114 th
Congress. I hope to see you at one of my many
events throughout the Third District.
From the Front...
