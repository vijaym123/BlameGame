David,
I just got word that Iowa's Army National Guard is bracing for possible
troop reductions in next year's defense budget -- and I'm not going to
stand for it.
Under the worst-case scenario, the Iowa Guard could lose 8 or 9 percent
of its 7,200 person force, translating into a loss of nearly 650
soldiers.
This is simply unacceptable. The last thirteen years have illustrated
the National Guard's critical value to our national security -- as
hundreds of thousands of these soldiers have bravely served in Iraq,
Afghanistan, and around the world.
That's why I'm urging the Department of Defense to not cut National
Guard troops in its 2015 budget, and now I want to hear from you:
Click here to take a quick poll and tell me if you think the Pentagon
should make cuts to the Iowa National Guard.
With weapons systems that are tens of billions of dollars over budget
and additional billions being spent on projects halfway around the
world in Afghanistan, there are far better areas to look for savings at
the Pentagon than in gutting Iowa's National Guard.
The National Guard is an essential component of America's defense
apparatus and has proven to be as effective as its active duty
counterparts.
It's my hope that Secretary Hagel does the right thing and protects our
brave Iowa Guard jobs.
