RUBIO URGES ADDITIONAL ACTION TO
COUNTER ISIL
On Thursday, Marco issued the following
statement after President Obama announced
the United States would be providing
humanitarian aid to threatened populations
in northern Iraq:
I am encouraged that American
forces are providing humanitarian relief
to threatened populations, including
Christians and other religious minorities
in northern Iraq. My thoughts and prayers
are with our men and women in uniform who
are in harm's way tonight carrying out
this mission.
It is important to remember
that ISIL threatens not just Iraqis but
also the security of the United States
and our allies in the region as it
consolidates its control of territory
that can be used as a base from which to
launch attacks.
That is why I've been urging
President Obama since June to conduct
airstrikes against ISIL targets and to
provide additional lethal assistance and
other support to the Iraqi government. A
key part of such an effort should be to
provide direct humanitarian and military
assistance to the Kurds, who face a
growing military and humanitarian
challenge in northern Iraq as they
confront ISIL and also host thousands of
refugees from Iraq and Syria who have
been forced to flee their homes.
Without immediate U.S. action,
it will not just be innocent Syrians and
Iraqis who pay the price of ISIL's
rise.

Rubio Honors Florida Borinqueneers At
Orlando Ceremony
On Tuesday, Marco honored members of the
65
th
Infantry Regiment
Borinqueneers for their
bravery and service at a Borinqueneers
Florida Honor Ceremony in Orlando. In June,
Rubio was on hand when President Obama
signed a bill into
law
to award the Borinqueneers with the
Congressional Gold Medal (the bill-signing
portion begins around the 10:30 mark). The
measure was sent to the Presidents
desk after the Senate passed S. 1174, which
Rubio originally co-sponsored.
The Borinqueneers were a segregated
Hispanic unit, comprised of mostly Puerto
Rican soldiers, who were not given the same
benefits and honors awarded to other
soldiers despite their service in World War
I, World War II and the Korean War.
