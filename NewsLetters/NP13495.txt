HIGHLIGHTS IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
[cid:image003.jpg@01CEFDB4.7058A000]
Transition extension gets Senate committee okay - The Commonwealth-only worker and investor programs would be extended through 2019 under terms of the omnibus territories bill
approved by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in Washington on Thursday. The number of foreign workers in the Northern Mariana Islands would still have to be reduced every year, however, and zeroed-out by the end of 2019. The 184 foreign investors, who had businesses in the NMI prior to 2009 and now hold Commonwealth-only visas, would be allowed to stay, also through 2019. In addition, the bar on asylum claims, which is critical to the continuation of parole-based tourism from China, would continue. All three programs are presently scheduled to end in twelve months.
Foreign workers now hold about 10,000 jobs in the NMI, but only 1,742 local workers are registered with the Commonwealth employment services office as looking for work. Even if every local worker took a job, we would still be 8,000 short. Businesses would close. Investors would take their money elsewhere. The cost of electricity and other basics would rise, because we would have fewer consumers in our economy. And tax revenues would drop, making it harder for the Commonwealth to pay government employees and NMIRF retirees.
The omnibus territories bill, S.1237, also contains provisions to reduce the local match island governments pay for federal grants, help island finance departments improve annual revenue estimates, and reduce electricity rates in the insular areas. The bill was introduced in the Senate at my request by Chairman Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and Ranking Member Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), as a companion to my own bill, H.R. 2200 , in the House.

8th graders from Rota's Dr. Rita Hocog Inos School, under the guidance of art teacher Therese Calvo Macalang and Principal Sharlene Manglona, crafted the beautiful ornaments that embellish the Northern Mariana Islands Christmas Tree this year. Our tree stands beside the National Christmas Tree near the White House, together with trees decorated by students from every state and territory. For more information on the 2013 National Christmas Tree, visit www.nps.gov/whho/national_christmas_tree.htm . Congratulations, Bucks!
Defense bill with divert limitations heads to the President - The 2014 National Defense Authorization Act , setting limits on Air Force development of divert airfield facilities in the Northern Marianas, passed the Senate Thursday and now goes to the President to sign into law. The bill bars expenditure of the $29.3 million, allotted for construction of maintenance and storage buildings and a hazardous cargo pad, until the Air Force reports on all the alternatives considered for the divert field. Congress expects "the Secretary of the Air Force to consult with the Governor of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands regarding the location of projects to support divert field operations with the goal of achieving a mutually agreeable solution." The NDAA also requires the Defense Department to report within 180 days on the feasibility of establishing a National Guard unit for the Northern Marianas, a project I have been working on since 2011. Another important component of the bill is new sexual assault policy for the military. It provides legal counsel for victims, eliminates the statute of limitation for sexual assault-related courts-martial, requires civilian review of cases not prosecuted, and stipulates dishonorable discharge or dismissal for anyone convicted of sexual assault. Military commanders are stripped of their ability to overturn jury convictions; and retaliation against victims will carry criminal penalties. I strongly support efforts to combat sexual assaults in the military and in civilian life.

Ms. Aurora David invited me to be one of the speakers at this week's induction of the Marianas High School National Honor Society. The chapter added 28, new, hardworking and dedicated students to its ranks. Thanks to Principal Cherlyn Cabrera and MHS NHS President Jonavelle Cuerdo and congratulations to the Dolphin family.
Magnuson-Stevens fisheries act added to 2014 agenda - Chairman Doc Hastings (R-Washington) released a draft bill this week that would reauthorize the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act
and asked for public comment. As Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, Oceans, and Insular Affairs, I will be working closely with Natural Resources Ranking Member Peter DeFazio (D-Oregon) to shape this important reauthorization. I am also looking into how the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council, one of the regional councils set up by Magnuson-Stevens to regulate fishing and manage stocks, is responding to recommendations made by the Government Accountability Office in 2009 . Together with Rep. Henry Waxman (D-California), who asked GAO to study the Council's expenditures in 2008, I asked the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
for an update on the Council's compliance with the changes in contracting practices and other problem areas GAO identified. Reauthorization of Magnuson-Stevens provides an opportunity to improve management of the councils, if needed, as well as to provide further protection for the dwindling fish stocks in the Pacific. I encourage all stakeholders to submit comments to your congressional office at kilili@mail.house.gov
and/or to the Natural Resources Committee Majority at magnusonstevens@mail.house.gov .

Pacifica Insurance Underwriters celebrates its 40th anniversary as an integral part of our business community this year. I presented Pacifica CEO and President Norman Tenorio with the statement I made in the company's honor in U.S. House of Representatives. I also gave copies of the floor statement to representatives of the families of Pacifica's cofounders, Alex Screen, Sonny Ada, John Terrace, and Yukio Kuribayashi.
Top Homeland Security officials confirmed by Senate - Mr. Jeh Johnson and Mr. Alejandro Mayorkas were confirmed by the U.S. Senate this week to be Secretary and Deputy Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. The agency is responsible for immigration, including the ongoing transition in the Northern Mariana Islands and the parole program that is critical to our tourist industry. Johnson is a former General Counsel at the Department of Defense, well versed in national security issues. Mayorkas is currently Director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and we have worked together on Marianas issues since day-one of the transition period. He called me on Thanksgiving Day in 2011 to announce his decision to make parole available on a case-by-case basis to persons born in the Northern Marianas between 1974 and 1978, their immediate relatives, and the immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, a policy he extended a year later . Mayorkas was also instrumental in responding to my calls for accommodation for foreign workers acting as family care-givers to our man'amko and the disabled. I look forward to working with Mr. Johnson and Mr. Mayorkas to continue making the immigration transition as least difficult as possible for the people and the economy of the Northern Mariana Islands.
Senate committee okays Kia'aina for Insular Areas Assistant Secretary - Esther Kia'aina has moved a step closer to becoming Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Insular Areas. On Tuesday, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources gave her the nod after both Chairman Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and Ranking Member Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) recognized Ms. Kia'aina as highly qualified and urged Members to support her nomination. President Obama picked Kia'aina to be the next Assistant Secretary in September. Now, the nomination heads to the Senate floor for consideration. I look forward to working with Ms. Kia'aina when she is confirmed by the U.S. Senate.

The Rotary Club of Saipan and Rotary clubs around the world set standards for personal integrity and for compassion for others in their communities. Speaking to the Club this week, I thanked the Rotary members for leading us all by exemplifying these values. Thanks to president Laila Younis Boyer and all Club members for their warm welcome and for all they do to make our islands a better place to live.
Jim Richardson selected as Superintendent of American Memorial Park - The National Park Service has announced that Jim Richardson will be the new Superintendent of the American Memorial Park on Saipan. Richardson is no stranger to our islands. He was assigned on detail in 2011 to the War in the Pacific Historical Park on Guam and American Memorial Park. More recently, Richardson served as Acting Superintendent at the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument in Arizona. He has 31 years of law enforcement and emergency service duties, including six years as the Chief Ranger at the Whiskeytown National Recreation Area in California. Richardson replaces Barbara Alberti, who has transferred to the Pacific Regional Office in San Francisco. Congratulations to Superintendent Richardson; and thank you to Ms. Alberti for all of her work over the last several years at American Memorial Park.

Lieutenant Colonel Lawrence Camacho visited his congressional office in Washington after wrapping up meetings at the Pentagon. He is currently stationed at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo serving as the Chief of Land Forces Branch, Office of Military Cooperation.
Thank you, LTC Camacho, for visiting and most especially for your service to our nation.
$228,458 awarded to Historic Preservation Office - The National Park Service announced the award of $228,458 to the Commonwealth government this week. The historic preservation grant will be used to preserve and protect our islands' historic sites. The formula grant only provides funding up to January 2014, but should be augmented when Congress finalizes appropriations for the rest of the year. Congratulations HPO!
$26,677 awarded for diesel emission reduction - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has awarded the Commonwealth Utilities Corporation $26,677 to reduce unsafe diesel emissions in the Northern Marianas Islands. CUC will use the money to help retrofit its generators, improving efficiency and cutting pollution. Congratulations to CUC.
