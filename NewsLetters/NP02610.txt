#ChoosingExcellence
Last Monday, February 9th, I hosted my "Choosing Excellence
" forum
on Capitol Hill. School choice advocates joined me in a dialogue about
bringing educational leaders from across the country together to
discuss the power of school choice. I thank South Carolina State
Senator Larry Grooms, Governor Bobby Jindal, Congresswoman Cathy
McMorris Rogers (R-WA) and the many other wonderful panelists who spoke
passionately about maximizing each child's full potential through the
power of education.
I truly enjoyed speaking with students from local charter schools at
the forum. They were very bright and positive. You can watch the entire
forum on C-SPAN HERE
.
NLRB Hearing
Last week, I also questioned witnesses in the HELP Committee on the
NLRB's damaging ambush elections rule. This rule hurts small
businesses, while only benefiting Big Labor. You can watch by clicking
the image below.
Community Office Hours
My staff will host Community Office Hours in 11 communities across
South Carolina. One of the most important ways I represent South
Carolina in the U.S. Senate is to support the people of our state when
they need assistance dealing with a federal agency. Residents seeking
assistance should bring all pertinent information and documents, such
as claim numbers and correspondence that they have received from the
federal agency involved. We look forward to your visit!
Celebration of Vietnam Vets
I was truly honored to join in a Black History Month celebration
honoring Vietnam Veterans Odell Price and Nathan White
. Their service and sacrifice make me
proud to ensure their story will be part of the official Congressional
record!
Thank you again for subscribing!
Sincerely,
Tim
