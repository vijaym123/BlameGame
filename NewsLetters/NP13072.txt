Dear
Neighbor,
Every January, Americans gear up for the
biggest football game of the season: the Super Bowl. Unfortunately,
some of the worst criminals, human traffickers, begin gearing up, too.
Its a little known secret that women and children are taken as sex
slaves, becoming the most sought-after entertainment on Super Bowl
weekend. This is a fitting time to recognize
National Slavery and
Human Trafficking Prevention Month . This month serves as a
reminder that modern day slavery is occurring in our own backyards every
day.
We must do all we can to fight this despicable
crime.
That is why I introduced the bipartisan
Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (H.R. 3530) , along with
Senator John Cornyn.
This is a comprehensive anti-human
trafficking bill focused on rescuing victims, tracking down their exploiters,
and prosecuting every criminal responsible for modern-day
slavery.
We must punish all of those involved in this dastardly deed and
rescue and restore victims.

In addition, this week the House passed the
Consolidated
Appropriations Act of 2014 , also known as the Omnibus bill. I
voted against this bill for several reasons. Most importantly, it fails
to restore military benefits promised to our men and women who have
served while giving billions to foreign countries like Egypt. Congress
should not pass a budget that treats our enemies better than our
heroes.
That is why Senator Rand Paul and I have introduced the
Uphold Our Promise to Veterans Act that would restore COLA benefits by
cutting aid to Egypt and Pakistan.
It also requires the
federal government to sell a small portion of unused land (excluding
National Parks and historical sites). These retiree pension benefits were
cut under the recently passed budget bill (H.J. Res. 59), which I did
not support.
We promised to care for these brave men and
women.
Now, they are being punished for Washingtons addiction to
spending.
We must uphold our promise to veterans and ensure they
receive their full benefits.

And thats just the way it
