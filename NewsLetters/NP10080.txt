I was on Fox News this Saturday to discuss the Select Committee to
investigate the administration's response to the attacks in Benghazi,
Libya that cost four Americans their lives.
The White House has repeatedly tried to prevent the complete facts
about the attacks and the government's response to them from coming to
light. They have continually obstructed congressional investigations
and failed to produce relevant documents.
If Republicans hadn't pushed for answers in the first few days after
the attacks, we might still think that a video caused a spontaneous
protest which simply got out of hand. Instead, we know the truth - the
CIA, the Defense Department and the State Department knew early that a
terrorist group had engaged in a sophisticated attack on our diplomatic
facilities.
As Members of the House Oversight Committee, we have been demagogued by
many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, dealt with an
often hostile media and were accused by the president of propagating a
"phony scandal." But we pressed on because we believe the American
people deserve answers, especially the families of those we lost.
We gave the administration every opportunity to come forward and be
transparent. Yet rather than work with us, they continued to stonewall
our investigation. At this point a Select Committee is the appropriate
course of action and I am optimistic we will soon learn the truth.
