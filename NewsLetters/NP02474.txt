Kansas Common Sense
March 2, 2015
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thank you for your continued interest
in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
Upcoming Vote on President Obama's Nominee for Attorney General
Reviewing the President's nominees for executive and judicial
appointments is one of my most serious responsibilities as a United
States Senator. President Obama's nominee for Attorney General, Loretta
Lynch, has failed to demonstrate a willingness to exert independence
from the White House when applying the laws of the land. On issues
ranging from gun rights to immigration, this White House has habitually
sought to ignore the law when it posed inconvenient limits on executive
power. This troubling trend must come to an end. The Attorney General
is America's most senior law enforcement official, and Americans must
be certain that the rule of law will be applied consistently and fairly
by the Department of Justice. After careful consideration, I am
unconvinced that Ms. Lynch meets this standard and am unable to support
her confirmation for Attorney General.
Voting "No" on Funding President Obama's Executive Amnesty
This week, I voted against using taxpayer dollars to fund
implementation of the President's executive amnesty through the
Department of Homeland Security spending bill. I strongly support
funding the Department of Homeland Security but I do not believe we
should use taxpayer dollars to pay for executive amnesty. Unlike the
Senate bill, the House-passed legislation would prevent a DHS shutdown
without funding unconstitutional executive actions. Unfortunately, this
legislation was repeatedly filibustered by Senate Democrats and
promised a veto from President Obama. Congressional Democrats and
President Obama are using the threat of a department shutdown as a
political weapon to grant amnesty and expand executive power. If we are
ever to address the country's immigration challenges, President Obama
must break his fixation on unilateral action and work with the
legislative branch, not against it.
FCC Approves New Internet Regulations
On Thursday, in an unprecedented expansion of regulatory authority, the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved 317 pages of new
regulations mandating equal treatment of Internet traffic -
implementing what is commonly referred to as "net neutrality." This is
an important topic for many Kansans. While the plan has yet to be
released, I am concerned about the suspect legal authority the FCC used
and the potential legal challenges that will inevitably stem from this
decision. These legal flaws could tie the decision up in court for
years to come. Additionally, new regulations may create challenges for
smaller Internet service providers looking to expand and improve
service in order to comply with new regulatory costs. Ultimately, these
new costs could be passed on to consumers, thus discouraging broadband
adoption. Additionally, the decision may prevent providers from new and
innovative plans that give consumers greater choice in picking
broadband plans that meet their needs.
The most troubling fact about the FCC's process is the profound lack of
transparency. The FCC never made the 317 pages of new rules public
before approving the plan. A recent survey conducted before the vote
showed that 85 percent of Americans opposed any new regulations or
believe the FCC should have either delayed the vote until the full plan
is made public. On an issue of such importance to American consumers,
the economy, and the future of the Internet, this is unacceptable.
Congress stands ready to work with the Administration on crafting
commonsense net neutrality legislation, but the President has pushed
FCC to move forward. We know all too well how damaging the 'we have to
pass it so you can find out what is in it' approach can be. By choosing
this path, the FCC has left Congress with no choice but to consider all
options to scrutinize these rules. Just as the FCC believes Internet
service providers should be held accountable for their network
management practices, I believe the FCC should be held accountable for
its potential interference in an Internet marketplace that has served
Americans so well.
Calling on VA Secretary Bob McDonald to Serve the Best Interest of
Veterans
This week, I took Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Bob
McDonald to task regarding my concerns over a lack of change within the
culture of bureaucracy at the VA as the Department continues to
overlook what is in the best interest of veterans. Thousands of
veterans are struggling to access care through the Choice Act primarily
because of VA's flawed implementation and interpretation of the law.
These errors include delays in mailing out Choice Cards, disqualifying
veterans who should be eligible without explanation, and dramatically
narrowing the scope of veterans who can use these funds by unreasonably
calculating how far a veteran lives from a VA medical facility, not
whether that facility can actually provide the medical services a
veteran needs.
I continue to press the VA Secretary to improve the Department's
implementation of the Choice Act so that veterans can access the care
they need. To that end, this week 41 of my Senate colleagues joined me
in writing to Secretary McDonald urging him to make certain that
funding provided by Congress is being used to implement the Veterans
Choice Program as Congress envisioned. The program allows veterans who
live more than 40 miles from the closest VA facility, or who face a
significant delay in scheduling an appointment, to access non-VA care.
Unfortunately, the VA is construing the eligibility criteria as it
relates to the 40-mile rule so narrowly that it is excluding too many
who are far away from the care that they need. Click here
to read our letter to the VA Secretary.
Last month, I introduced legislation, the Veterans Access to Community
Care Act of 2015 (S. 207), requiring the VA to utilize its authorities,
including the Choice Act, to offer community care to veterans who are
currently unable to receive the healthcare services they need from a VA
medical facility within 40 miles of where they live. The VA has
remained unwilling to apply common sense and use their authorities,
forcing many rural veterans to travel hours to access care they could
receive through the Choice Act in their communities - or go without
care altogether. I am very pleased that the American Legion and Vietnam
Veterans of America both endorsed my legislation during this week's VA
Committee hearing, and Chairman Isakson announced that he will hold a
hearing on the 40 mile issue in the coming months. I will continue to
work so that veterans are able to access care they deserve, avoid
lengthy wait times and travel times, and have the VA that is worthy of
their service. Click here
to watch my full
remarks conveying the continued struggles of veterans to the VA
Secretary.
Introducing American Legion National Commander Mike Helm
I was pleased to introduce the National Commander of the American
Legion Mike Helm, of Norcatur, Kansas, as he presented the American
Legion's legislative priorities before a joint Senate and House
Veterans' Affairs Committee Hearing. Commander Helm is uniquely
qualified to understand the issues impacting rural veterans who
struggle to access quality and timely health care. There is no group of
people that Kansans admire more than those who served our country -
maybe with one exception. Veterans who serve other veterans are the
most worthy of our respect and esteem. There is no greater example to
folks in Kansas and nationally than Commander Mike Helm. He served his
country with great patriotism, valor and courage, and then came home
and dedicated his life to caring for other veterans.
The other thing that Kansans admire are good parents. The Commander and
his wife Debbie, who is very involved in the Auxiliary, have raised
wonderful children. I actually had the honor of nominating two of his
children to U.S. Service Academies - one to West Point and one to the
Air Force Academy. I can't think of a better role model than someone
who served their country in the military, who came home and honored
their fellow veterans, and did everything in their power to raise a
good family. Kansans are honored to have Mike Helm as the National
Commander of the American Legion, and I am grateful for the opportunity
to introduce him before Members of Congress. Click here
to watch my introduction of Commander Helm
at the joint Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committee Hearing.
Subcommittee Hearing on Foreign Ops
On Tuesday, Secretary of State John Kerry testified before the Senate
Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the State Department and
foreign aid budgets. As a new member of this subcommittee, I warned
Secretary Kerry against downplaying the threat of the Islamic State to
our nation and the need for the Obama Administration to maintain focus
on fighting this threat. I believe it is necessary for the President to
ask Congress for the appropriate authority to wage battle against these
Islamic extremists and work to retain the support of the American
people in this cause.
I also asked if the State Department plans to submit the Arms Trade
Treaty (ATT) to the Senate for consideration. I have led opposition in
the Senate against this treaty, and I am concerned the Administration
will operate under the ATT without having received Senate approval.
Seventeen months have passed since the treaty was signed, and it is far
past time for President Obama to permit the Senate to fulfill its
constitutional obligations and vote on the ATT. Click here
to see the conversation.
Defense Subcommittee Hearing with the United States Air Force
On Wednesday, I had the opportunity to question the Secretary of the
United States Air Force, Deborah Lee James, and Chief of Staff of the
United States Air Force, General Mark Welsh, during a Senate
Appropriations Defense Subcommittee Hearing. We discussed important
issues for airmen serving in Kansas including the KC-46 Tanker,
military construction for McConnell Air Force Base, Forbes Field, and
Kansas National Guard cyber capabilities.
The Secretary confirmed that the arrival of the KC-46 Tanker will not
be impacted by sequestration reductions to the Air Force, which is good
news for McConnell AFB and Wichita. Additionally, the Chief of Staff
affirmed the need to retain, grow and expand cyber mission capabilities
in the National Guard much like the unique skills and existing capacity
in the 177th Information Warfare Aggressor Squadron of the Kansas
National Guard. The Chief also provides assurance that he will look
into future military construction projects, such as the runway on
Forbes Field and a new Air Traffic Control Tower at McConnell Air Force
Base. As a new Member on the Senate Appropriations Defense
Subcommittee, I look forward to working with the Air Force on these
critical initiatives for Kansas as well as other matters of national
significance.
Meeting with USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack
This week, I visited with Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack about
our priorities for the upcoming Congress. In my role as chairman of the
Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, I will be working to making
certain USDA programs are working for farmers, ranchers and rural
Kansas. The Secretary and I discussed the importance of agriculture
research, and agreed to work together to encourage innovation and the
development of new technologies that will benefit rural areas of our
country. Regarding implementation of the Farm Bill, the Secretary
informed me the deadline for farmers to update their yield history or
reallocate base acres was extended until March 27, which USDA formally
announced later in the week. I appreciated the early notice of the
deadline extension, and encouraged him to continue to work as closely
as possible with farmers while implementing the Farm Bill. We also
discussed initiatives and ways to operate USDA in a more cost-effective
manner so the Department is efficiently using taxpayer dollars. I look
forward to working with Secretary Vilsack on issues affecting rural
America.
Supporting Pilots and General Aviation
Over the past 10 years, 60,000 pilots have left the general aviation
industry. On Wednesday, I joined several of my Senate colleagues in
introducing two bipartisan bills to help reverse this troubling trend.
For many pilots, the current process of obtaining a third-class medical
certificate has become burdensome and expensive, while providing very
little benefit to the industry. The General Aviation Pilot Protection
Act of 2015, or S. 573, extends the 2004 Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) sport pilot rule to include slightly larger
aircraft, provided certain safety requirements.
The second bill, known as the Pilot Bill of Rights 2 (PBOR2), or S.
571, also expands the third-class medical exemption for recreational
pilots, while broadening the protections of Senator Inhofe's original
Pilots Bill of Rights which overwhelmingly passed Congress in 2012. In
addition, PBOR2 represents a significant improvement in the due process
rights and liability protections for volunteer pilots by ensuring
certificate holders have the right to appeal FAA decisions through a
new, merit-based trial in Federal Court.
General aviation is the largest industry in Kansas, generating nearly
$3 billion in annual exports and manufacturing 40 percent of all
general aviation planes. These common-sense bills will allow general
aviation to grow and prosper while providing vital protections to
pilots and aircraft operators. I am proud to be an original cosponsor
of the General Aviation Pilot Protection Act and the Pilots Bill of
Rights 2, two important steps toward ensuring a brighter future for
general aviation.
Kansas Farm Bureau Visit
I enjoyed the opportunity to visit with Kansas farmers who traveled to
Washington as representatives of the Kansas Farm Bureau this week. We
talked about opportunities that exist to address a number of issues
impacting rural Kansas in my role as chairman of the Agriculture
Appropriations Subcommittee. The farmers reiterated the importance of
rolling back burdensome regulations such as the EPA's proposed clean
water rules and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife's listing of the lesser
prairie chicken. We also discussed the need to reform our tax code and
create more business certainty for farmers and ranchers. Most farmers I
talk to just want to make a living without unnecessary intrusion from
the federal government, and to have the ability to pass along their way
of life to their sons or daughters. Thanks also to President Rich Felts
for presenting me with the "Friends of Farm Bureau" award.
Rice Growers Keynote
This week I gave the keynote address at the USA Rice Federation
conference in Washington. Over the years, I have found that farmers
from across the nation, including rice producers, share many of the
same values and concerns as farmers in Kansas. We may grow different
commodities, but just like in Kansas, rice producers tell me they are
concerned about over regulation from the federal government, want more
fairness and certainty in the tax code, and need crop insurance and
farm policy that provide them at least modest protection against
uncontrollable weather events and volatile commodity markets.
Also like Kansas farmers, promoting trade in foreign markets, like
Cuba, is a top priority for rice growers. Cuba was the top export
market for U.S. rice prior to the embargo. Today, Cuba imports $300
million worth of rice from other nations instead of purchasing U.S.
rice because of the embargo and regulatory restrictions limiting our
producers' trade opportunities. I continue to make the case that
lifting the unilateral trade embargo would benefit both our farmers and
the Cuban people. For over 50 years the current policy has failed to
effect regime change or lift up the repressed Cuban people. I believe
it is time for a new direction in our policies towards Cuba, and
opening up trade for U.S. commodities, like wheat and rice, is part of
the solution.
Johnson County Kansas Listening Tour Stop
Before flying back to Washington, D.C., on Monday I made another stop
in Mission on my listening tour and met with 150 Johnson County
residents to hear their thoughts. The topics included Department of
Homeland Security, Medicare, Obamacare, Fair Tax, ISIS, Climate change,
and hunger. I appreciate the conversation I have with Kansans to learn
more about the issues that are affecting them. Thanks also to Northeast
Johnson County Chamber of Commerce President Deb Settle for hosting the
event and to the City of Mission for the use of the Sylvester Powell,
Jr. Community Center. For upcoming town hall meetings, visit my website
.
Applications Available for Summer 2015 Internships

Kansas
Common
Sense
March
2,
2015
Hello,
Welcome
to
" Kansas
Common
Sense ."
Thank
you
for
your
continued
interest
in
receiving
my
weekly
newsletter.
Please
feel
free
to
forward
it
on
to
your
family
and
friends
if
it
would
interest
them.
Upcoming
Vote
on
President
Obama's
Nominee
for
Attorney
General
Reviewing
the
President's
nominees
for
executive
and
judicial
appointments
is
one
of
my
most
serious
responsibilities
as
a
United
States
Senator.
President
Obama's
nominee
for
Attorney
General,
Loretta
Lynch,
has
failed
to
demonstrate
a
willingness
to
exert
independence
from
the
White
House
when
applying
the
laws
of
the
land.
On
issues
ranging
from
gun
rights
to
immigration,
this
White
House
has
habitually
sought
to
ignore
the
law
when
it
posed
inconvenient
limits
on
executive
power.
This
troubling
trend
must
come
to
an
end.
The
Attorney
General
is
America's
most
senior
law
enforcement
official,
and
Americans
must
be
certain
that
the
rule
of
law
will
be
applied
consistently
and
fairly
by
the
Department
of
Justice.
After
careful
consideration,
I
am
unconvinced
that
Ms.
Lynch
meets
this
standard
and
am
unable
to
support
her
confirmation
for
Attorney
General.
Voting
"No"
on
Funding
President
Obama's
Executive
Amnesty
This
week,
I
voted
against
using
taxpayer
dollars
to
fund
implementation
of
the
President's
executive
amnesty
through
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
spending
bill.
I
strongly
support
funding
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
but
I
do
not
believe
we
should
use
taxpayer
dollars
to
pay
for
executive
amnesty.
Unlike
the
Senate
bill,
the
House-passed
legislation
would
prevent
a
DHS
shutdown
without
funding
unconstitutional
executive
actions.
Unfortunately,
this
legislation
was
repeatedly
filibustered
by
Senate
Democrats
and
promised
a
veto
from
President
Obama.
Congressional
Democrats
and
President
Obama
are
using
the
threat
of
a
department
shutdown
as
a
political
weapon
to
grant
amnesty
and
expand
executive
power.
If
we
are
ever
to
address
the
country's
immigration
challenges,
President
Obama
must
break
his
fixation
on
unilateral
action
and
work
with
the
legislative
branch,
not
against
it.
FCC
Approves
New
Internet
Regulations
On
Thursday,
in
an
unprecedented
expansion
of
regulatory
authority,
the
Federal
Communications
Commission
(FCC)
approved
317
pages
of
new
regulations
mandating
equal
treatment
of
Internet
traffic
&ndash;
implementing
what
is
commonly
referred
to
as
"net
neutrality."
This
is
an
important
topic
for
many
Kansans.
While
the
plan
has
yet
to
be
released,
I
am
concerned
about
the
suspect
legal
authority
the
FCC
used
and
the
potential
legal
challenges
that
will
inevitably
stem
from
this
decision.
These
legal
flaws
could
tie
the
decision
up
in
court
for
years
to
come.
Additionally,
new
regulations
may
create
challenges
for
smaller
Internet
service
providers
looking
to
expand
and
improve
service
in
order
to
comply
with
new
regulatory
costs.
Ultimately,
these
new
costs
could
be
passed
on
to
consumers,
thus
discouraging
broadband
adoption.
Additionally,
the
decision
may
prevent
providers
from
new
and
innovative
plans
that
give
consumers
greater
choice
in
picking
broadband
plans
that
meet
their
needs.
The
most
troubling
fact
about
the
FCC's
process
is
the
profound
lack
of
transparency.
The
FCC
never
made
the
317
pages
of
new
rules
public
before
approving
the
plan.
A
recent
survey
conducted
before
the
vote
showed
that
85
percent
of
Americans
opposed
any
new
regulations
or
believe
the
FCC
should
have
either
delayed
the
vote
until
the
full
plan
is
made
public.
On
an
issue
of
such
importance
to
American
consumers,
the
economy,
and
the
future
of
the
Internet,
this
is
unacceptable.
Congress
stands
ready
to
work
with
the
Administration
on
crafting
commonsense
net
neutrality
legislation,
but
the
President
has
pushed
FCC
to
move
forward.
We
know
all
too
well
how
damaging
the
'we
have
to
pass
it
so
you
can
find
out
what
is
in
it'
approach
can
be.
By
choosing
this
path,
the
FCC
has
left
Congress
with
no
choice
but
to
consider
all
options
to
scrutinize
these
rules.
Just
as
the
FCC
believes
Internet
service
providers
should
be
held
accountable
for
their
network
management
practices,
I
believe
the
FCC
should
be
held
accountable
for
its
potential
interference
in
an
Internet
marketplace
that
has
served
Americans
so
well.
Calling
on
VA
Secretary
Bob
McDonald
to
Serve
the
Best
Interest
of
Veterans
This
week,
I
took
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
Secretary
Bob
McDonald
to
task
regarding
my
concerns
over
a
lack
of
change
within
the
culture
of
bureaucracy
at
the
VA
as
the
Department
continues
to
overlook
what
is
in
the
best
interest
of
veterans.
Thousands
of
veterans
are
struggling
to
access
care
through
the
Choice
Act
primarily
because
of
VA's
flawed
implementation
and
interpretation
of
the
law.
These
errors
include
delays
in
mailing
out
Choice
Cards,
disqualifying
veterans
who
should
be
eligible
without
explanation,
and
dramatically
narrowing
the
scope
of
veterans
who
can
use
these
funds
by
unreasonably
calculating
how
far
a
veteran
lives
from
a
VA
medical
facility,
not
whether
that
facility
can
actually
provide
the
medical
services
a
veteran
needs.
I
continue
to
press
the
VA
Secretary
to
improve
the
Department's
implementation
of
the
Choice
Act
so
that
veterans
can
access
the
care
they
need.
To
that
end,
this
week
41
of
my
Senate
colleagues
joined
me
in
writing
to
Secretary
McDonald
urging
him
to
make
certain
that
funding
provided
by
Congress
is
being
used
to
implement
the
Veterans
Choice
Program
as
Congress
envisioned.
The
program
allows
veterans
who
live
more
than
40
miles
from
the
closest
VA
facility,
or
who
face
a
significant
delay
in
scheduling
an
appointment,
to
access
non-VA
care.
Unfortunately,
the
VA
is
construing
the
eligibility
criteria
as
it
relates
to
the
40-mile
rule
so
narrowly
that
it
is
excluding
too
many
who
are
far
away
from
the
care
that
they
need.
Click
here
to
read
our
letter
to
the
VA
Secretary.
Last
month,
I
introduced
legislation,
the
Veterans
Access
to
Community
Care
Act
of
2015
(S.
207),
requiring
the
VA
to
utilize
its
authorities,
including
the
Choice
Act,
to
offer
community
care
to
veterans
who
are
currently
unable
to
receive
the
healthcare
services
they
need
from
a
VA
medical
facility
within
40
miles
of
where
they
live.
The
VA
has
remained
unwilling
to
apply
common
sense
and
use
their
authorities,
forcing
many
rural
veterans
to
travel
hours
to
access
care
they
could
receive
through
the
Choice
Act
in
their
communities
&ndash;
or
go
without
care
altogether.
I
am
very
pleased
that
the
American
Legion
and
Vietnam
Veterans
of
America
both
endorsed
my
legislation
during
this
week's
VA
Committee
hearing,
and
Chairman
Isakson
announced
that
he
will
hold
a
hearing
on
the
40
mile
issue
in
the
coming
months.
I
will
continue
to
work
so
that
veterans
are
able
to
access
care
they
deserve,
avoid
lengthy
wait
times
and
travel
times,
and
have
the
VA
that
is
worthy
of
their
service.

remarks

the
continued
struggles

Secretary.
Introducing
American
Legion
National
Commander
Mike
Helm
I
was
pleased
to
introduce
the
National
Commander
of
the
American
Legion
Mike
Helm,
of
Norcatur,
Kansas,
as
he
presented
the
American
Legion's
legislative
priorities
before
a
joint
Senate
and
House
Veterans'
Affairs
Committee
Hearing.
Commander
Helm
is
uniquely
qualified
to
understand
the
issues
impacting
rural
veterans
who
struggle
to
access
quality
and
timely
health
care.
There
is
no
group
of
people
that
Kansans
admire
more
than
those
who
served
our
country
&ndash;
maybe
with
one
exception.
Veterans
who
serve
other
veterans
are
the
most
worthy
of
our
respect
and
esteem. There
is
no
greater
example
to
folks
in
Kansas
and
nationally
than
Commander
Mike
Helm.
He
served
his
country
with
great
patriotism,
valor
and
courage,
and
then
came
home
and
dedicated
his
life
to
caring
for
other
veterans.
The
other
thing
that
Kansans
admire
are
good
parents.
The
Commander
and
his
wife
Debbie,
who
is
very
involved
in
the
Auxiliary,
have
raised
wonderful
children.
I
actually
had
the
honor
of
nominating
two
of
his
children
to
U.S.
Service
Academies
&ndash;
one
to
West
Point
and
one
to
the
Air
Force
Academy.
I
can't
think
of
a
better
role
model
than
someone
who
served
their
country
in
the
military,
who
came
home
and
honored
their
fellow
veterans,
and
did
everything
in
their
power
to
raise
a
good
family.
Kansans
are
honored
to
have
Mike
Helm
as
the
National
Commander
of
the
American
Legion,
and
I
am
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
introduce
him
before
Members
of
Congress.

Subcommittee
Hearing
on
Foreign
Ops
On
Tuesday,
Secretary
of
State
John
Kerry
testified
before
the
Senate
Appropriations
subcommittee
that
oversees
the
State
Department
and
foreign
aid
budgets.
As
a
new
member
of
this
subcommittee,
I
warned
Secretary
Kerry
against
downplaying
the
threat
of
the
Islamic
State
to
our
nation
and
the
need
for
the
Obama
Administration
to
maintain
focus
on
fighting
this
threat.
I
believe
it
is
necessary
for
the
President
to
ask
Congress
for
the
appropriate
authority
to
wage
battle
against
these
Islamic
extremists
and
work
to
retain
the
support
of
the
American
people
in
this
cause.
I
also
asked
if
the
State
Department
plans
to
submit
the
Arms
Trade
Treaty
(ATT)
to
the
Senate
for
consideration.
I
have
led
opposition
in
the
Senate
against
this
treaty,
and
I
am
concerned
the
Administration
will
operate
under
the
ATT
without
having
received
Senate
approval.
Seventeen
months
have
passed
since
the
treaty
was
signed,
and
it
is
far
past
time
for
President
Obama
to
permit
the
Senate
to
fulfill
its
constitutional
obligations
and
vote
on
the
ATT.

Defense
Subcommittee
Hearing
with
the
United
States
Air
Force
On
Wednesday,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
question
the
Secretary
of
the
United
States
Air
Force,
Deborah
Lee
James,
and
Chief
of
Staff
of
the
United
States
Air
Force,
General
Mark
Welsh,
during
a
Senate
Appropriations
Defense
Subcommittee
Hearing.
We
discussed
important
issues
for
airmen
serving
in
Kansas
including
the
KC-46
Tanker,
military
construction
for
McConnell
Air
Force
Base,
Forbes
Field,
and
Kansas
National
Guard
cyber
capabilities.
The
Secretary
confirmed
that
the
arrival
of
the
KC-46
Tanker
will
not
be
impacted
by
sequestration
reductions
to
the
Air
Force,
which
is
good
news
for
McConnell
AFB
and
Wichita.
Additionally,
the
Chief
of
Staff
affirmed
the
need
to
retain,
grow
and
expand
cyber
mission
capabilities
in
the
National
Guard
much
like
the
unique
skills
and
existing
capacity
in
the
177th
Information
Warfare
Aggressor
Squadron
of
the
Kansas
National
Guard.
The
Chief
also
provides
assurance
that
he
will
look
into
future
military
construction
projects,
such
as
the
runway
on
Forbes
Field
and
a
new
Air
Traffic
Control
Tower
at
McConnell
Air
Force
Base.
As
a
new
Member
on
the
Senate
Appropriations
Defense
Subcommittee,
I
look
forward
to
working
with
the
Air
Force
on
these
critical
initiatives
for
Kansas
as
well
as
other
matters
of
national
significance.
Meeting
with
USDA
Secretary
Tom
Vilsack
This
week,
I
visited
with
Secretary
of
Agriculture
Tom
Vilsack
about
our
priorities
for
the
upcoming
Congress.
In
my
role
as
chairman
of
the
Agriculture
Appropriations
Subcommittee,
I
will
be
working
to
making
certain
USDA
programs
are
working
for
farmers,
ranchers
and
rural
Kansas.
The
Secretary
and
I
discussed
the
importance
of
agriculture
research,
and
agreed
to
work
together
to
encourage
innovation
and
the
development
of
new
technologies
that
will
benefit
rural
areas of
our
country.
Regarding
implementation
of
the
Farm
Bill,
the
Secretary
informed
me
the
deadline
for
farmers
to
update
their
yield
history
or
reallocate
base
acres
was
extended
until
March
27,
which
USDA
formally
announced
later
in
the
week.
I
appreciated
the
early
notice
of
the
deadline
extension,
and
encouraged
him
to
continue
to
work
as
closely
as
possible
with
farmers
while
implementing
the
Farm
Bill.
We
also
discussed
initiatives
and
ways
to
operate
USDA
in
a
more
cost-effective
manner
so
the
Department
is
efficiently
using
taxpayer
dollars.
I
look
forward
to
working
with
Secretary
Vilsack
on
issues
affecting
rural
America.
Supporting
Pilots
and
General
Aviation
Over
the
past
10
years,
60,000
pilots
have
left
the
general
aviation
industry.
On
Wednesday,
I
joined
several
of
my
Senate
colleagues
in
introducing
two
bipartisan
bills
to
help
reverse
this
troubling
trend.
For
many
pilots,
the
current
process
of
obtaining
a
third-class
medical
certificate
has
become
burdensome
and
expensive,
while
providing
very
little
benefit
to
the
industry.
The
General
Aviation
Pilot
Protection
Act
of
2015,
or
S.
573,
extends
the
2004
Federal
Aviation
Administration
(FAA)
sport
pilot
rule
to
include
slightly
larger
aircraft,
provided
certain
safety
requirements.
The
second
bill,
known
as
the
Pilot
Bill
of
Rights
2
(PBOR2),
or
S.
571,
also
expands
the
third-class
medical
exemption
for
recreational
pilots,
while
broadening
the
protections
of
Senator
Inhofe's
original
Pilots
Bill
of
Rights
which
overwhelmingly
passed
Congress
in
2012.
In
addition,
PBOR2
represents
a
significant
improvement
in
the
due
process
rights
and
liability
protections
for
volunteer
pilots
by
ensuring
certificate
holders
have
the
right
to
appeal
FAA
decisions
through
a
new,
merit-based
trial
in
Federal
Court.
General
aviation
is
the
largest
industry
in
Kansas,
generating
nearly
$3
billion
in
annual
exports
and
manufacturing
40
percent
of
all
general
aviation
planes.
These
common-sense
bills
will
allow
general
aviation
to
grow
and
prosper
while
providing
vital
protections
to
pilots
and
aircraft
operators.
I
am
proud
to
be
an
original
cosponsor
of
the
General
Aviation
Pilot
Protection
Act
and
the
Pilots
Bill
of
Rights
2,
two
important
steps
toward
ensuring
a
brighter
future
for
general
aviation.
Kansas
Farm
Bureau
Visit
I
enjoyed
the
opportunity
to
visit
with
Kansas
farmers
who
traveled
to
Washington
as
representatives
of
the
Kansas
Farm
Bureau
this
week.
We
talked
about
opportunities
that
exist
to
address
a
number
of
issues
impacting
rural
Kansas
in
my
role
as
chairman
of
the
Agriculture
Appropriations
Subcommittee.
The
farmers
reiterated
the
importance
of
rolling
back
burdensome
regulations
such
as
the
EPA's
proposed
clean
water
rules
and
the
U.S.
Fish
&amp;
Wildlife's
listing
of
the
lesser
prairie
chicken.
We
also
discussed
the
need
to
reform
our
tax
code
and
create
more
business
certainty
for
farmers
and
ranchers.
Most
farmers
I
talk
to
just
want
to
make
a
living
without
unnecessary
intrusion
from
the
federal
government,
and
to
have
the
ability
to
pass
along
their
way
of
life
to
their
sons
or
daughters.
Thanks
also
to
President
Rich
Felts
for
presenting
me
with
the
"Friends
of
Farm
Bureau"
award.
Rice
Growers
Keynote
This
week
I
gave
the
keynote
address
at
the
USA
Rice
Federation
conference
in
Washington.
Over
the
years,
I
have
found
that
farmers
from
across
the
nation,
including
rice
producers,
share
many
of
the
same
values
and
concerns
as
farmers
in
Kansas.
We
may
grow
different
commodities,
but
just
like
in
Kansas,
rice
producers
tell
me
they
are
concerned
about
over
regulation
from
the
federal
government,
want
more
fairness
and
certainty
in
the
tax
code,
and
need
crop
insurance
and
farm
policy
that
provide
them
at
least
modest
protection
against
uncontrollable
weather
events
and
volatile
commodity
markets.
Also
like
Kansas
farmers,
promoting
trade
in
foreign
markets,
like
Cuba,
is
a
top
priority
for
rice
growers.
Cuba
was
the
top
export
market
for
U.S.
rice
prior
to
the
embargo.
Today,
Cuba
imports
$300
million
worth
of
rice
from
other
nations
instead
of
purchasing
U.S.
rice
because
of
the
embargo
and
regulatory
restrictions
limiting
our
producers'
trade
opportunities.
I
continue
to
make
the
case
that
lifting
the
unilateral
trade
embargo
would
benefit
both
our
farmers
and
the
Cuban
people.
For
over
50
years
the
current
policy
has
failed
to
effect
regime
change
or
lift
up
the
repressed
Cuban
people.
I
believe
it
is
time
for
a
new
direction
in
our
policies
towards
Cuba,
and
opening
up
trade
for
U.S.
commodities,
like
wheat
and
rice,
is
part
of
the
solution.

on
Monday
I
made
another
stop
in

on
my
listening
tour
and
met
with
150
Johnson
County

to
hear
their
thoughts.
The
topics
included
Department
of
Homeland
Security,
Medicare,
Obamacare,
Fair
Tax,
ISIS,
Climate
change,
and
hunger.
I
appreciate
the
conversation
I
have
with
Kansans
to
learn
more
about
the
issues
that
are
affecting
them.
