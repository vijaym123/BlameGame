"If You Like It You Can Keep It"
That was the promise that President Obama made to the people of America in order to sell the healthcare law that bears his name.
The voice of the people has been heard &ndash; they expect the President to keep his word. I believe it is the duty of the House of Representatives to hold him to his promise.
On Friday, I voted for H.R. 3350, the Keep Your Health Plan Act, which will allow plans available on the individual market today to be offered next year. I supported the bill because it is my responsibility to aid my constituents whose coverage has been cancelled and who are facing hardships and uncertainty. The Keep Your Health Plan Act seeks to offer those in this situation a degree of relief.
I am pleased that this legislation passed with broad, bipartisan support by a vote of 261-157 (39 Democrats joined all but 4 Republicans to support the bill.) This bill is not the ultimate answer to dealing with the many flaws and failures of Obamacare.
In fact, the nation will likely continue to face issues with the law&rsquo;s implementation, particularly when the employer mandate takes effect at the end of next year.
I firmly believe that all Americans deserve a real solution to protect them from the ill effects of this law, not temporary administrative fixes by the President. That is why I will continue to fight to fully repeal this law and replace it with common sense reforms that will lower costs and increase access to affordable health insurance.
