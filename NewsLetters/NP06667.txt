Last week, an inspector generals audit report highlighted that at least a third of the contracts entered into - to implement Obamacare - are over budget, as
reported
by the Washington Times. Seven of the contracts already have costs twice as high as initially anticipated, the Health and Human Services Departments Inspector General said.
This is more than disturbing statistics -- its unacceptable. It reinforces the need for the DATA Act and an independent body to track federal spending and require more transparency. The American people have a right to know how their dollars are being used.
Yours in service,

Friend -
Recently, a government
report
showed that federal agencies have failed to report over $600 billion in awards, including grants and loans.
I supported the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA),
H.R. 2061 , to establish an independent body to track federal spending, including grants, contracts, loans and agencies internal expenses, on a single electronic platform, making all of the information available to the public.
Transparency and accountability are not just common sense, they are necessary in order to show the American people how their money is being spent.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.

about the bill I introduced to hold Members of Congress directly accountable for spending in Washington.
