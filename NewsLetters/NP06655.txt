Protecting the Border
Last week,
the Obama Administration
announced
that it sent
1,275 illegal immigrants to Louisiana.
This was done without the
knowledge or consent of our Governor or our Congressional
delegation.
This highlights the Presidents failure to properly
enforce our immigration laws.
We must protect our borders and stop the
Presidents executive
amnesty.
Protecting Medicare
I
recently met with senior citizens
to discuss Medicare
Advantage.
Medicare Advantage is a program which gives seniors healthcare
choices as part of their Medicare benefits.
Obamacare cut
Medicare by $700 billion, including $300 billion from Medicare
Advantage.
I have worked to reverse these cuts and I support health
programs that give power to patients, not
bureaucrats.
Honoring Katrina
Victims
Friday was the 9-year anniversary of Hurricane
Katrina.
We remember those we lost and are reminded of the strength
of Louisianans
I remember when we turned an abandoned K-Mart
into a temporary hospital to treat storm victims.
It was neighbors
helping neighbors.
While there's still more work to be
done, doing everything to protect Louisiana families will always be my
number one priority.
You can read more about this progress
here .
