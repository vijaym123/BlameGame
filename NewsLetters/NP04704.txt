Did you see this?
Paul Krugman issued a forceful endorsement of Barack Obama&rsquo;s Presidency.
We AGREE!
But the last two years of President Obama&rsquo;s term are in grave danger.
Republicans are threatening to win the largest Congressional majority in generations.
Just this week, they spent $26,OOO,OOO on nasty Obama-bashing TV ads.

This is Barack Obama&rsquo;s final national election as President.
