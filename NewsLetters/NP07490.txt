Dear
David,
As you may have heard, President Obama came to Kansas City
yesterday and said people who oppose his policies should " stop just hating all the time. "
Mr. President,
with all due respect, this is the kind of rhetoric that happens in
junior high, when you say that somebody else is a really bad person. And
it's certainly no way to begin to work
together.
Traveling the country, giving campaign-style speeches, saying the other
side shouldn't be in such a bad mood all the time - this is not the kind
of presidential leadership Americans deserve.
The
nation is facing a number of critical issues. This week alone,
Congress is debating transportation legislation, bills to address the border
crisis, and plans to give America's veterans better
care.
Meanwhile, people in Missouri and across America are struggling to
find good-paying jobs while footing the bill for more costly health care
coverage and higher utility bills. Under this administration's
policies, the poorest families among us are working several part-time jobs to
simply feed their families.
We don't need another
empty 'pivot' or for President Obama to continue ignoring the law
altogether. Americans deserve presidential leadership. We know President
Obama knows how to campaign; we need to now see a president that knows
how to lead.
I hope you'll join this conversation

Sincere
regards,
