Friend,
In case you missed it, we wanted to share the video below.
President Obama was recently interviewed by a local Sacramento news anchor, and he highlighted Ami&#39;s work on climate change, the drought, and his efforts to strengthen the middle class.

As the President said, it&#39;s important that we look to the future-- and that&#39;s what Ami is doing every day in Washington: fighting to move our country forward and create opportunity for a strong middle class.
Thank you for standing with us.
