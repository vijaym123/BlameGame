HIGHLIGHTS IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
Limitations on divert development added to 2014 NDAA -Air Force plans for a divert airfield in the Northern Mariana Islands will receive new Congressional oversight under terms of the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act
passed on Thursday by the House. The NDAA provides $29.3 million for airfield projects - $2.8 million for a maintenance facility, $8 million for a hazardous cargo pad, and $18.5 million for bulk storage - but bars any expenditure until the Air Force reports to Congress on alternatives considered for the divert-field operations. In addition, the bill report
notes that the Governor wants divert operations located on Tinian, not Saipan; and it calls for a mutually agreeable resolution to that issue. I agree that Tinian is the preferred location for military expansion in the NMI and worked with the Armed Services Committee to ensure that all of our local concerns are addressed by the Air Force. The divert field will provide an alternative in the event that aircraft cannot be landed at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam because of natural disaster or military conflict. The Senate is expected to approve the NDAA next week and send it to the President to sign into law.

180-day turnaround required on NMI National Guard study - The 2014 National Defense Authorization Act
also sets the stage for a Northern Mariana Islands National Guard unit. Section 515 directs the Secretary of Defense to do a feasibility study and report to Congress within 180 days. I have been working to get a National Guard unit for the Northern Marianas for some time. In 2011 I introduced H.R. 2773
that required establishment of an NMI National Guard. But the Armed Services Committee did not want to move forward without first looking at what the costs are and whether the Northern Marianas has the infrastructure and enough population to support a Guard unit. Now, the 2014 NDAA requires that study. I want to thank Armed Services Committee member Madeleine Z. Bordallo (D-Guam) for adding the language to the bill during the Committee's markup. Currently, our men and women serve in the Guam National Guard. They are returning from a tour of duty in Afghanistan this month. In addition to this combat mission, National Guard units, which are under the authority of their state and territorial Governors, may also be called up in response to natural disasters.

Conferees get more time to finish farm bill - - We will have to wait until January to see if the $33 million SNAP pilot program for the Northern Mariana Islands and the rest of the 2013 farm bill are enacted into law. As the holiday recess neared without conference committee agreement on the farm bill, H.R. 2642 , House Agriculture Committee Chair Frank Lucas (R-Oklahoma) convinced the House to pass an extension of the 2008 farm policies effective until the end of January . This extension will give conferees time to complete their work; otherwise the agriculture law enacted in 1949 goes into effect on January 1. The Senate has not yet agreed to the extension, but may vote next week. Key House negotiators say they are close to an agreement and will continue to work through the holidays to ensure that Congress can enact the farm bill in January. Meanwhile, I will continue to work to be sure the Northern Marianas SNAP pilot program is a part of the final conference agreement, so that food stamp benefits for our people are on par with the rest of the United States.

House approves federal budget for 2014 and 2015 - Northern Marianas programs dependent on federal dollars will be spared some of the impact of sequestration over the next two years. On Thursday, the House of Representatives approved the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 . The Act provides $63 billion in relief from the across-the-board sequester cuts that hurt Head Start and other federal programs nationwide. 169 Republicans and 163 Democrats voted in favor; 62 Republicans and 32 Democrats voted against. Discretionary spending for fiscal 2014 had been scheduled to go down to $967 billion, but is now set $1.012 trillion for this year and $1.014 trillion for fiscal year 2015. Next week, the Senate is expected to pass the bill; and President Obama has said he will sign it into law. After that, Congress will have to enact appropriations for fiscal 2014. Appropriations are set to expire on January 15.

Pacific coast Representatives concerned about loggerhead turtle catch - Led by Rep. Jared Huffman (D-California) thirteen members of the House of Representatives from the Pacific coast have asked for an update on consultations between the United States and Mexico on efforts to protect loggerhead turtles from being caught by mistake. Loggerheads begin their lives off the coast of Japan, then migrate thousands of miles across the Pacific to feed off the coast of California and Mexico. According to a 2013 report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, "Each year thousands of loggerhead sea turtles die at sea or become stranded after encountering the high density of fishing gear deployed by Mexican fishermen off the West Coast." NOAA is currently using its authority under the Magnuson-Stevens Act to investigate the Mexican government's efforts to address the problem. Our letter expresses support for NOAA's work . The update will be valuable when, early next year, reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Act is expected to be on the agenda of the Natural Resources Committee, where I serve as Ranking Member of the subcommittee responsible for oceans and fisheries.
