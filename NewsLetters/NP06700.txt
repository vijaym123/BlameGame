Dear
David,
Back to
School
The children are back
to school.
Eve, one of my granddaughters, started at Lake View
High School in Chicago as a freshman on Tuesday.
First days are
always exciting and a bit scary, but all of my grandkids got off to a
good start.
I wish the same for all our children.
The start
of school also means the start once again of free and reduced-cost
lunches, sometimes the only nutritious food of the day for many
students.
I worked with the Chicago Food depository and the Summer Meals
Illinois to connect as many kids to food programs as possible during
the summer months, but still 89 percent of those eligible were not
enrolled.
Parents: be sure your students who need them,
get the reduced-fare CTA passes
and check
out the lunch and maybe breakfast thats available at school.
In the House of Representatives, Im
supporting the
Middle Class Jumpstart
agenda that includes improving and expanding early childhood
education and making college more affordable.
The
Strong
Start for Americas Children Act
would make quality child care
available for more working parents. The
Bank on Students
Emergency Loan Refinancing Act
would help Americans refinance their
college loans at new, lower rates, and increase Pell Grants for higher
education.
There is nothing better for our economy and our
families than robust investment in education.
Caring for Seniors and People with
Disabilities
I was invited to be a
caregiver for a homebound woman as part of a national Come Care With
Me day, sponsored by Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute (PHI), to
highlight the work of direct care workers and the need for government
investment in quality home care programs and the training of
workers.
Along with the caregiver, I swept the floor, folded laundry,
washed dishes, and, best of all, spent time chatting with a wonderful
woman who appreciated the help and loved the companionship of her
caregiver.
I also had the pleasure of
delivering Meals on Wheels out of the Arlington Heights Senior
Center.
There again I had a chance to talk with the seniors in their
homes, who relied on the hot and cold meals brought right to

care aide,

their doors.
I saw first hand what a huge difference this
program makes in the lives of the recipients.
I saw the compassion
of the staff and community volunteers that make the rounds every day.
We need to expand home
and community based long-term care services.
10,000 baby boomers
are turning 65 every single day!
Still, some people will need nursing home care, and much can
be done to improve the quality of nursing homes.
I authored a
provision in the Affordable Care Act that requires accurate reporting
of the levels of staffing based on actual payroll data.
So far
this provision has not been adequately enforced,
so I wrote a letter to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services
asking them to meet the letter of the law.
Staffing levels are a sure indicator of the quality of care, and families
deserve to know.
Handing out Meals on Wheels to a
woman in Arlington
Heights
she relies on the service to get
meals she
needs.
Did you know that current law does not require a
nursing home
regardless of its size
to have a Registered Nurse
(let along a physician) on duty for more than 8 hours a day?
I was
shocked to learn that.
Thats why I introduced H.R. 5373, the
Put a Registered Nurse in the Nursing Home
Act , which would require nursing homes and skilled nursing
facilities to have at least
one direct-care
Registered Nurse (RN) on duty 24 hours per day, 7 days per
week .
To me this should be an obvious requirement.
I will keep fighting for our students,
seniors and people with disabilites. Thank you for
reading!
