Dear Friends,
Today is the 70 th
anniversary of D-Day, which marked the beginning of the end of Nazi Germany. Thanks to the bravery and sacrifice of U.S. troops and their
allies on June 6, 1944, the world was soon rid of Adolf Hitlers bloody regime.
In honor of these courageous veterans, here are a few D-Day-related links:
