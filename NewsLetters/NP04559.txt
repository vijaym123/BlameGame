Thank Them Today
I was going to write that we should take time today to think about America&rsquo;s veterans and their families. And we should. We should definitely think about the hardships they have borne for us, the dangers they have faced for us and the threats they have beaten back for us.
We should think about how it&rsquo;s not just the veterans who bear a burden, but their families and loved ones as well. When Mommy deploys to fly fighter planes at a base in the Middle East or when Grandpa fought at
Pusan to help stop unprovoked aggression &ndash; small children, wives, husbands, mothers and fathers were left facing a year, sometimes longer without seeing their loved ones. And each and every day, they had to face the question of if they&rsquo;d see their child, parent or spouse again. That&rsquo;s why if you work with veterans or their spouses, if your neighbor is a veteran, if your child&rsquo;s teacher has a daughter who is a veteran or if you see someone wearing the uniform, today is the day to thank them. They most certainly deserve it.
Please, if you're a veteran and need help, or if you know a veteran that needs help, with anything ranging from replacing lost paperwork, to accessing care through the VA to questions about your GI Benefits, please call my office.
My family&rsquo;s thoughts and prayers are with all of the men and women, and their families, who gave of themselves to defend the United States of America and with those currently serving.
God bless.
