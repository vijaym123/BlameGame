VISITING DC
May 23, 2014
This week, I continued to work along with some of my
colleagues on addressing the serious problems facing the VA and the
Veterans Health Administration. On Tuesday, Senator Deb Fischer
(R-Neb.) and I introduced S. 2362, legislation that would prohibit the
payment of bonuses to employees at the Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
through Fiscal Year 2015.
It is appalling and totally
unacceptable that the VHA, which is being scrutinized by Congress and the
media for a string of national scandals, is giving out bonuses. It is
totally inconceivable that the Veterans Health Administration can
justify rewarding themselves while they fail our veterans. It is my hope
that the Senate will swiftly adopt this legislation so that such gross
misconduct is no longer rewarded at taxpayer expense. To read the full
statement on S. 2362, click

Also
on Tuesday, the Office of Inspector General (IG) released a report on
the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) Quick Start Program. The
Quick Start program was designed to help service members smoothly
transition to civilian life by beginning the disability claims process for
veterans prior to their separating from the Armed Forces. However,
this new IG report shows that numerous factors -- such as ineffective use
of resources, inadequate training, and insufficient program controls
-- led to problems with the timeliness and quality of VAs decisions
on these claims. The IG found that the VBA accurately processed only
69% of Quick Start claims during 2013.
That is 29% lower than VAs
98% goal and well below VAs reported quality measures.
In
light of last weeks hearing regarding the accuracy and trustworthiness of
Veterans Health Administrations wait time data, I question the
Administrations claim that the VA disability claims backlog is improving.
The findings in this report are symptomatic of the ongoing, pervasive
problems at the VA. Congress must conduct aggressive oversight to make
sure that the VA is treating our veterans with the respect that they
deserve. To read IGs full report, click

On the topic of oversight, this week minority members of
the Senate VA Committee and myself signed a letter calling on
Chairman Sanders of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs to hold several
oversight hearings on numerous topics including, but not limited to,
the Veterans Health Administration, the quality of VA healthcare, and
the integrity of the VAs data and performance metrics. It is obvious
from the ongoing VA scandals and the report above that the Department
desperately needs vigorous oversight. It is our mission as a committee
to provide oversight; yet the Chairman has chosen to ignore
reasonable requests for hearings. My fellow minority members and I hope that
this letter will be heard and oversight hearings will be scheduled
immediately. To read the full text of the letter sent to Chairman Sanders,

This week, President
Obama held a press conference addressing the issues within the
Veterans Administration. I listened with great interest to the President's
remarks on the unfolding VA scandals. Quite frankly, I am shocked that
the President feels he needs to wait for the results of yet another
investigation before he takes action. As we discussed in our committee
hearing with the Secretary last week, there are at least four years
worth of reports from the Inspector General, the Government
Accountability Office, the Office of Special Counsel, and Office of the Medical
Investigator highlighting the problems within the Veterans Health
Administration.
Yet, we still can't connect the dots without a report
on Phoenix?
Veterans are tired of waiting for the next report,
the next investigation, the next media "Breaking News Alert." VA is
broken, Mr. President.
Veterans don't want the appearance of
leadership on this issue.
They want action. To watch the Presidents
full press conference, click

On
Wednesday, I introduced legislation to correct a mistake by the Census
Bureau and the Office of Management of Budget (OMB) that is hurting
eastern North Carolina. A year ago, OMB issued new rules that
arbitrarily separated Brunswick County from the Wilmington metropolitan area.
This separation has not only led to an understatement of the size of
North Carolinas economy, but hurt economic development in the area.
Everybody in North Carolina knows that Brunswick County is part of the
greater Wilmington area. Instead of mindlessly applying bureaucratic
rules, the Administration needs to address what reality looks like for
people in North Carolina. If passed, this legislation would settle the
issue by requiring the Director of the Office of Management and Budget
to consider Brunswick County to be part of the same metropolitan
statistical area as Wilmington, North Carolina-- just like it always has
been. To read the bill text, click

Be sure to keep an eye out for a special edition of my weekly
newsletter, and spend time this weekend reflecting on the real meaning
of Memorial Day. As we gather with our families, give thanks and honor
to those who gave their lives for our freedom. I wish you all a happy
and safe Memorial Day weekend.
Sincerely,
Richard Burr
