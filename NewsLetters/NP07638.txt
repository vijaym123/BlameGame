Friends,
With the surge of unaccompanied
children at the border dominating the
news in Arizona, I wanted to drop you a
line on the latest from here in
Washington.
President's $3.7B Proposal Sends Wrong
Message
If you haven't already heard, I am
opposed to President Obama's $3.7 billion
proposal to address the surge of
unaccompanied children at the border. While
I do not begrudge the
administrations request for
additional funds to address this crisis,
the devil is in the details of how the
president plans to spend those funds.
Rather than directing the bulk of these
funds to resources at the border and within
the court system, the president plans to
send much of it to the Department of Health
and Human Services, the agency tasked with
temporarily settling these children with
guardians living in the United States. Not
only does this send the wrong message, it
wastes an extraordinarily large sum on an
approach that will do little, if anything,
to actually stem the flow of unaccompanied
children across the border.
For more details, take a look at my
recent appearance on Fox News Channel's
Special Report with Bret Baier.

The CREST Act
Last week, Sen. John McCain and I
introduced the
Children Returning on an Expedited and
Safe Timeline Act
- otherwise known as
the CREST Act - which addresses the crisis
at the border.
The bill would not only stem the
present tide of unaccompanied children, it
would address the motivating factors that
led to this crisis, preventing future waves
of children from making the dangerous
journey north. Specifically, the bill
would:
Condition foreign aid on countries'
efforts to secure their borders.
Increase penalties for human
smuggling.
Amend current law to ensure the
expedited removal of unaccompanied
children from non-contiguous countries
such as El Salvador, Honduras and
Guatemala.
Require mandatory detention of
unaccompanied children until their
cases are fully adjudicated.
Increase the number of immigration
judges to hear cases and create a
separate immigration docket for
juvenile cases.
Increase the number of refugee
applications by up to 5,000 each for El
Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala.

President Obama Can and Must Act
While Congress should pass legislation
such as the CREST Act, you may not be aware
that President Obama has the power to begin
to stem the flow of unaccompanied children
right now.
Specifically, President Obama can:
Direct federal agencies not to
release unaccompanied children after
they have been apprehended.
Expedite or trim the timelines of
hearings for unaccompanied
children.
Direct the Department of Health and
Human Services not to place
unaccompanied children with guardians
in the United States.
I've been making an aggressive push to
bring attention to these little-discussed
powers to try and get the president to act
immediately to address this crisis. Here
are just a few examples:

Show
Thanks for taking time from your busy
day to catch up with me. I'll be sure to be
in touch with any new developments on this
crisis.
Best,
Jeff
