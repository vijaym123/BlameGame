Small
Businesses Are the Key to More
Jobs
Dear Friend,
Last week, I traveled the Fifth District
visiting small businesses throughout
Central and Southside Virginia in
recognition of National Small Business
Week. From a Danville Tractor Supply
Company to a garden center in Arrington to
a construction company in Charlottesville,
we were able to witness the ingenuity of
Virginias Fifth District firsthand
as we talked to hard-working employees and
met with the entrepreneurs behind these
Main Street businesses that are the
backbone of our communities.
May 12th
16th marked the 51st
annual National Small Business Week to
recognize the contributions of small
businesses to our communities and our
economy. Small businesses are the backbone
of our economy, comprising 97 percent of
all employers in America and accounting for
60 to 80 percent of all new jobs created.
That is why a successful recovery and a
robust economy require a thriving small
business sector where entrepreneurs are
encouraged to succeed.
Yet, excessive government regulation
continues to disproportionately impact
small businesses and impede their growth
and development at a time when we need
their success the most. As I met with these
small businesses last week, the sentiment
was consistent that the federal government
is stifling their ability to grow and
create jobs.
The National Small Business Association
reported in February that 91 percent of
small companies reported increases in their
health premiums with their most recent
insurance renewal. Further, the Obama
Administration is on its way to generating
the most government regulations in American
history, issuing 157 new major rules which
cost American taxpayers an annual $73
billion.
In addition to the unnecessary costs and
regulations the Presidents health
care law is imposing upon our small
businesses, this administrations
energy policies are also making life harder
for them with skyrocketing utility bills.
As a result, they must cut employee hours
and slash jobs we cannot afford to
lose.
That is why my colleagues in the House
and I have been laser-focused on promoting
policies that will foster growth for small
businesses and benefit their current and
future employees. From cutting unnecessary
regulations to establishing an
all-of-the-above American energy policy,
the House has passed over one hundred bills
that would provide our small businesses
with the environment to grow and create
jobs for our communities.
We must free our Main Street businesses
from these government-created obstacles to
economic growth. With the unemployment rate
in many Central and Southside Virginia
localities exceeding the national rate, it
is unacceptable that unnecessary government
regulations are holding our job creators
back.
I look forward to continuing to promote
pro-growth policies that put trust in the
hands of our Main Street businesses, and
not the federal government. As I saw last
week in our district, small businesses
truly are the drivers of our economy and we
must do all we can to foster their
success.
