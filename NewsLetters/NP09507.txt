Combating Superbugs at Northwestern
This week, Congressman Danny Davis (D-IL) and I joined a panel of
medical experts at Northwestern Medical Center to discuss our bill, the
DISARM Act
, which aims to spur the development
of new drugs to treat antibiotic-resistant infections, or "superbugs."
There is a critical shortage of research and development of advanced
antibiotics, often leaving doctors and hospitals with few options when
treating patients with these deadly bugs.
Each year more than two million people suffer antibiotic-resistant
infections, and 23,000 of them die as a result. This year, the Centers
for Disease Control listed superbug infections as the #1 public health
threat.
Experts back house bill to develop
new drugs to combat superbugs
One of five infectious disease experts vided the nation's "superbug"
problem through an ominous local perspective on Thursday.
"We're fortunate to watch our Chicago Blackhawks win another playoff
series, and they did that in front of 23,000 fans," said Dr. Marc H.
Scheetz, an infectious diseases pharmacist at Northwestern Memorial
Hospital. "Imagine all of those fans dying annually from an
antibiotics-resistant infection."
