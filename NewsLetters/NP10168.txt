The Hill Report
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of April 28 - May 2, 2014
For nearly two years, House committees have been investigating the
terrorist attack that tragically took the lives of four Americans in
Benghazi, Libya.
This week it became abundantly clear that the
Administration has been deliberately withholding documents that were
subpoenaed by the House.
From day one, I have supported every effort
to uncover the truth and believe that the Administration's obstruction
is completely unacceptable and warrants a new level of investigation.
As Chairman of the Rules Committee, I stand ready to act on Speaker
Boehner's announcement today that the House will vote on creating a
Select Committee on Benghazi. It is my hope that the Select Committee
will increase the public's awareness regarding this tragic event, force
the Administration to comply with the law, and provide answers to the
American people.
North Texas Invasive Species Barrier Act of 2014
On Monday the House approved a bill to assist more than 1.5 million
customers of the North Texas Municipal Water District, many of whom
reside in the 32nd Congressional District, who could face restricted
access to water as a result of the discovery of invasive species in
Lake Texoma.
As you may remember, the House and Senate passed
legislation to exempt the Texoma Pump Station from the Lacey Act in
instances of zebra mussel transfers.
This week's bill simply expands
the zebra mussel exemption to other invasive species, which are
transferred from Lake Texoma in a closed conveyance system to guarantee
that 100 percent of invasive species are removed and extirpated.
This bill would ensure that 28 percent of the North Texas Municipal
Water District's critical water supplies will not be unnecessarily shut
off and that millions of Texans will have an adequate supply of water
in the future.
It's important that we restore the steady stream of
water to North Texans in a manner that does not use taxpayer dollars
and that complies with the Lacey Act's intended goal of preventing the
spread of invasive species. To read the bill, which I cosponsored with
Congressman Ralph Hall and Congressman Sam Johnson, click here

MilCon-VA Appropriations
On Wednesday the House approved the first bill of our annual
appropriations process, the Military Construction Veterans Affairs
Appropriations Act of 2015.
This process will allow us to fund our
nation's priorities while also cutting wasteful spending and achieving
meaningful savings for American taxpayers. The Military
Construction-Veterans Affairs bill reduces overall spending by $1.8
billion compared to the fiscal year 2014 bill and increases funding for
veterans' programs.
I'm pleased to support this legislation to ensure
that our troops and veterans have the services they need and the
benefits they deserve.
As the Chairman of the Rules Committee, I sent this bill to the House
floor under an open process, meaning that all Members were given the
opportunity to offer amendments on the House floor and voice their
opinions. I enjoyed the opportunity to hear the robust debate this week
and to see the House work its will on behalf of the American people.
Constituent Meetings
I had the opportunity to meet with several constituents and groups that
were visiting DC this week.
On Wednesday I met with a student from SMU
that was advocating on behalf of college students who support the
Collegiate Housing and Infrastructure Act (CHIA), which I have
sponsored
this Congress.
Congressman Sessions with Natalie Yezbick from SMU
In addition to discussing the CHIA bill, we talked about her priorities
to improve student safety on campus. I always enjoy hearing from
students in the 32nd Congressional District about their ideas to help
make our community a better place to live and appreciate her group
taking the time to meet with me. To learn more about other meetings I
had with North Texans this week, visit my Facebook page.
Have a good weekend.
Sincerely,
Pete Sessions
Member of Congress

Weekly
Newsletter
from
Congressman
Pete
Sessions
Week
of
April
28
&#8211;
May
2,
2014
For
nearly
two
years,
House
committees
have
been
investigating
the
terrorist
attack
that tragically
took
the
lives
of
four Americans in
Benghazi,
Libya.
This
week
it
became
abundantly
clear
that
the
Administration
has
been
deliberately
withholding
documents
that
were
subpoenaed
by
the
House.
From
day
one,
I
have
supported
every
effort
to
uncover
the
truth
and
believe
that
the
Administration&#8217;s
obstruction
is
completely
unacceptable
and
warrants
a
new
level
of
investigation.
As
Chairman
of
the
Rules
Committee,
I
stand
ready
to
act
on
Speaker
Boehner's
announcement
today that
the
House
will
vote
on
creating
a
Select
Committee
on
Benghazi.
It
is
my
hope
that
the
Select
Committee
will
increase
the
public&#8217;s
awareness
regarding
this
tragic
event,
force
the
Administration
to
comply
with
the
law,
and
provide
answers
to
the
American
people.
North
Texas
Invasive
Species
Barrier
Act
of
2014 On
Monday
the
House
approved
a
bill
to
assist
more
than
1.5
million
customers
of
the
North
Texas
Municipal
Water
District,
many
of
whom
reside
in
the
32nd
Congressional
District,
who
could
face
restricted
access
to
water
as
a
result
of
the
discovery
of
invasive
species
in
Lake
Texoma.
As
you
may
remember,
the
House
and
Senate
passed
legislation
to
exempt
the
Texoma
Pump
Station
from
the
Lacey
Act
in
instances
of
zebra
mussel
transfers.
This
week&#8217;s
bill
simply
expands
the
zebra
mussel
exemption
to
other
invasive
species,
which
are
transferred
from
Lake
Texoma
in
a
closed
conveyance
system
to
guarantee
that
100
percent
of
invasive
species
are
removed

extirpated.
This
bill
would
ensure
that
28

of
the
North
Texas
Municipal

District&#8217;s

water
supplies
will
not
be
unnecessarily
shut
off
and
that
millions
of
Texans
will
have
an
adequate
supply
of
water
in
the
future.
It&#8217;s
important
that
we
restore
the
steady
stream
of
water
to
North
Texans
in
a
manner
that
does
not
use
taxpayer
dollars
and
that
complies
with
the
Lacey
Act&#8217;s
intended
goal
of
preventing
the
spread
of
