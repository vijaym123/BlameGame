Dear
Friend,
This whole IRS story just gets more implausible as it
goes on.
That's
what I told
the IRS Commissioner on Monday night when he
appeared before Congress to talk about how Lois Lerner's e-mails went
missing.
I'm including the
video
of that here so you can get caught up on
how we got here.
As I told some folks after the hearing, even as I
walked back through just what we know so far about the apparent
targeting that took place for quite some time at the IRS, it's just even
more unbelievable.
Please check out the video, and if you
want to stay in the loop on this issue, make sure you're
signed up
for these e-mail
updates and you're checking in on the special
website
that the Oversight Committee has set
up to keep tracking this investigation.
Your rights are
important, and the truth is important.
Sincerely,
Doug
Collins
Member of Congress
More
implausible as it goes...
Congressman Doug Collins questioned IRS Commissioner John Koskinen
Monday night about the simple plausibility of the IRS's position on
whether or not illegal and unconstitutional targeting took place on Lois
Lerner's watch.
