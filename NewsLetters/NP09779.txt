Dear Friend,
I've always told folks that I represent the best state in the nation.
And it's true. Since devastating tornadoes touched down in Arkansas
just a few weeks ago, the country has seen the strength and spirit of
our state. Churches bringing volunteers by the busload to assist with
clean-up efforts. Families helping families dig through the rubble to
find photos, mementos, and heirlooms. Local businesses offering
services, food, and water to those affected.
Times like these remind us that there are no Democrats or Republicans.
We're all Americans, and we must work together to help our neighbors in
need. Since day one, the Arkansas delegation has worked with local,
state, and federal officials to ensure our state receives the
assistance it needs.
Help is on the way. Arkansans in Faulkner, Pulaski, Randolph, and White
Counties are now eligible to apply for Individual Assistance from FEMA.
These funds cover costs ranging from temporary housing and home repairs
to Small Business Administration low interest loans and medical
expenses. Just last night, we received word that Clay, Cleburne,
Fulton, Independence, Izard, Jackson, Lawrence, Randolph, Sharp,
Faulkner, and White Counties are now eligible to apply for Public
Assistance, which provides funding for emergency work and the repair
and replacement of disaster-damaged facilities.
My office stands ready to help in any way we can. For those impacted,
please visit www.disasterassistance.gov
, call 1-800-621-3362, or stop by one of the
Disaster Recovery Centers around the state. As always, if you have any
questions, please call my office at 877-259-9602.
Thank you,
Mark Pryor
