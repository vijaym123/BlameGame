WEEK IN REVIEW
I spent this second week of the Houses two-week district
work period with more stops throughout the Third District and even made
my way down to Little Rock. Thanks to all who were a part of
it.
My Monday was spent in
Little Rock, where I toured Southwest Power Pool, Inc. and had a chance to
meet with Delta Dental.
On Tuesday, before departing the Natural States capital, I
had the opportunity to have coffee the Arkansas State Chamber, and then
it was off to Russellville. While in my hometown, I got to tour the
facilities of Dow Chemical, the world's largest supplier of chlorinated
organic products and services.
Afterwards, I headed over to
visit the Arkansas Hospice River Valley Home and then stopped by Rose
Drug, Inc.
I wrapped up my day in Russellville by holding a town
hall meeting at Russellville High (Go Cyclones!). Thank you to those who
came out! If you missed it, you can read about my town hall in
this Russellville Courier
article .
I spent Wednesday in Benton County. My day
started off with a visit to Shirleys Flowers in Rogers.
I then
headed over to Nabholz Construction to get an update on Nabholzs many
ongoing projects in the Third District
including the Amazeum in
Bentonville and the ArcBest headquarters and the Fort Smith Osteopathic School
of Medicine at Chaffee Crossing. From there, I headed over to the Pea
Ridge Manufacturing and Business Academy to learn about the schools
unique curriculum. The last stop of my day was
Pea Ridge National Military Park . If you have not
been, I encourage you to check out this fantastic resource in our
backyard!
On Thursday, I
headed to the River Valley for a full day of events. My first stop was
at Five Rivers Distribution
the newest intermodal port facility on
the Arkansas River. From there, I swung by the Van Buren Police
Station to see their new facilities! After joining the Van Buren RotaryClub
for lunch, I toured River Bend Industries in Fort Smith. I also had
the chance to meet with the UAFS Up to Us campaign team and the Old Fort
Homeless Coalition before making my way to the Fort Smith Senior
Activity Center for my town hall. I truly appreciate all those who took
time out of their days to join me. For those who couldnt be there, you
can read up on my Fort Smith town hall in
this article from the Times Record .
Next week, its back to
Washington. Thank you to all who
were apart of this district work period.
From the
Front...
