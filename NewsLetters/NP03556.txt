Changing Obamacare
to Save the Jobs of Millions
1/8/15
Today,
Congressman Doug Lamborn cosponsored and voted in favor of H.R. 30, the Save
American Workers Act. This bill makes the definition of a full-time
employee one who completes 40 hours of work per week. The employer mandate
of Obamacare had made the definition of a full-time employee someone
who completes 30 hours of work per
week.
"The House is taking another important step in
dismantling Obamacare. The employer mandate attempts to micromanage the
employment practices of America's job creators and places the job
security of millions of Americans at risk. The Save American Workers Act
will help solidify over two million jobs in this country, including
many workers who earn a median income under $30,000 a year and do not
have a college degree. We will continue to stand with the workers and
employers of America in pushing back against harmful legislation from the
Obama Administration."
