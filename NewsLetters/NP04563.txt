Opposing
Amnesty
President Obama announced that despite
opposition from a majority of Americans, he will continue to move forward on
his plans to issue executive amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants
in the U.S.
This is unconstitutional.
The President
must stop disregarding the Constitution and bypassing Congress to pursue
his unpopular agenda.
I will continue to push back on the
President's executive overreach and lawless
amnesty.
Supporting Israel
I
was disappointed by reports that a senior Obama Administration official
made offensive and inappropriate remarks about Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
President Obama has a record of a
feckless foreign policy.
His administration's recent comments are a
reflection of that policy.
Israel is one of America's best
partners and closest allies, and they must remain
so.
Saving Social Security
The Social Security Trust Fund is going bankrupt.
Instead of
ignoring the problem, we must fix Social Security so those near or at the
age of retirement see no reduction in their benefits in the future.
We must also preserve Social Security for future
generations.
My office is ready to assist those who have problems with their
Social Security or Medicare benefits.
If you have questions,
please do not hesitate to contact one of my
offices.
