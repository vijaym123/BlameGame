Dear David,
As we celebrate Memorial Day with family and friends, I encourage you to think about all the brave men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.
I know my family, as we honor all of our men and women in uniform, will be thinking of my dad who proudly served in World War II - a role he rarely discussed.
And much like my dad, Kirkwood Vietnam War Veteran Gene Haltenhof never sought out the recognition he deserved. Thankfully, after more than forty years that has finally changed.
This week, Former U.S. Army Captain Haltenhof
was presented
with an Air Medal with Numeral "25" in recognition of hours flown in hostile airspace. During his service, he was awarded a Bronze Star and the Distinguished Flying Cross for his heroism in the evacuation of Fire Support Base Ripcord, but an administrative oversight kept him from receiving the Air Medal. This administrative oversight was a wrong my staff and I were thrilled to play a role in correcting - it's one of the best parts of my job.
I was privileged to help Captain Haltenhof, because it's important we continue to keep our promises to veterans long after they return from the battlefield.
This is a promise that also includes our four-legged heroes. Last week, when the Senate Armed Services Committee - a committee on which I proudly serve -
passed
the annual defense bill, it included a provision
I championed
to ensure service members who handle service dogs are at the front of the line to adopt the dogs when they're retired from duty.
There are many issues facing our returning troops, and this is one that remained dear to my heart. I've heard directly from veterans who want to be reunited with the friend they served with and who at times kept them out of harm's way, much like a Kansas City Iraq War Veteran who reached out to me about his dog Diego and what reuniting them would mean to him. It was
a great day
when that moment finally came for Logan Black and Diego.
Now I'm proud I can say we're one step closer to ensuring that at the first chance they get, service members and their service dogs can finally be reunited.
It's stories like the ones I've relayed today that remind me the best way to honor those who've sacrificed so much, is to ensure we recognize and remember their service.
All the best,
