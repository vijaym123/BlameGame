Dear Friend,
Recently, American Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who had been held by the Taliban
since 2009, was returned to the United States in exchange for five
Taliban prisoners being held at Guantanamo Bay.
Law requires the
President to notify Congress at least 30 days before the transfer or
release of a Guantanamo detainee; however this did not occur due to
concerns over Sgt. Bergdahls health and safety, according to the
Administration.
With which of the below statements do you most agree?
I support the Administrations
actions. The most important consideration is the freedom and safety of
an American POW. I do
not support the Administrations actions primarily because the United
States government should never negotiate with
terrorists. I do not support the
Administrations actions primarily because the release of Taliban terrorists
risks the lives of Americans and other people around the world.
I do not support the
Administrations actions primarily because the President acted outside of the
law.
I do not support
the Administrations actions primarily because I have reservations
about Sgt. Bergdahls service.
I dont know.
I have another answer.
