LEGISLATION
October 05, 2014
Dear
David,
California has already suffered a brutal fire season.
According to the U.S. Forest Service, Northern California alone normally
sees about 144,000 acres burn annually. This year, the total has already
topped 450,000 acres. In our district, the Happy Camp, July, Eiler,
Boles, and Beaver fires have burned well over 200,000 acres. This past
week, the King Fire in El Dorado County was contained, but only after
burning more than 150 square miles97, 000 acres.
As these
wildfires continue to rage across the North State, one thing remains
clear
the current system is broken. Protecting our homes, lands, and
local economies from catastrophic fires is not a partisan issue, and we
can no longer allow our forests and communities to suffer at the
expense of poor policies from Washington. It is past time we end the
devastating cycle of hands-off forest management and increasingly
restrictive red tape. As I continue to work in Congress to advance responsible
solutions so we can work to prevent these fires before they start, I
want to hear your thoughts. Please take a moment to share your input
and concerns below.
I am looking forward to hearing from
you!
Sincerely,
Have you, or anyone close to you, been
impacted by the wildfires in the North State? Yes No If yes, please share how these fires have affected
you. What do you believe to be the cause of the wildfires in
California? Irresponsible management of public forests. Dry conditions caused by drought.
High temperatures this
summer. Climate
change. Other. What
action(s) do you think Congress should take? Streamline regulations so that forests can be
properly managed. Increase funding for the U.S. Forest Services firefighting
efforts.
Allow
federal emergency funding to be used to fight severe fires instead of
borrowing from other forest management programs.
Nothing. What do you think should be done in forested
areas burned by fires? Salvage logging of usable wood and replanting of
trees. Leave dead trees and
debris in place.
Need More Information. Do you have any additional
thoughts? *By answering this survey, you are
