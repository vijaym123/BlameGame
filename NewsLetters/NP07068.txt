Dear Friend,
Earlier
this summer I had the opportunity to meet with veterans from across our
state participating in an Honor Flight from Utah to Washington, DC.
I gathered with the group at their departure, and our
congressional delegation visited the group in Washington as well.
Across
the country, groups of veterans, especially those who have served in
World War II, visit our nations capital as members of Honor Flight
programs, which celebrate their exceptional service to our
country.
During their time in Washington, veterans visit a number of
locations in Washington, DC, including Arlington Cemetery and the
World War II Memorial.
Many of the men and women who served in World
War II, who may have previously visited the capital, have not had the
opportunity to solemnize their service at the memorial which opened
in 2004 and is dedicated to their bravery and sacrifice.
It is
deeply moving to see our greatest generation pay tribute to their fellow
soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines and to be a part of honoring
them as well.
This fall, in September and October,
additional Honor Flights will depart Utah for Washington, DC.
I
plan to participate again, and hope you will join me.
You can learn
more about the flights by visiting the official site,
http://www.utahhonorflight.org/home.html .
Some specific
ways you and your family can support the Honor Flight include helping
with the Utah sendoff and return which are patriotic celebrations of
service, or by serving as a guardian who accompanies a veteran on the
trip.
While there will never be an adequate way to fully honor the
courage and commitment of our veterans or to thank them for their
service, participating in an Honor Flight is one tangible way to pay
tribute.
One small way the House has honored these
veterans was by passing the Honor Flight Act (HR 4812) on July 22, 2014.
I was proud to support this measure, which requires the
Transportation Security Administration, in collaboration with the Honor Flight
Network or other not-for-profit organizations that honor military
veterans, to develop a process for providing expedited and dignified
passenger screening services for veterans traveling on private charter
flights to visit war memorials built and dedicated to honor their
service.
Saving these veterans time and showing them the respect they have
earned is one small way we can thank these brave men and
women.
I am honored to serve in Congress on behalf of Utah families
like yours.
As your representative, I always appreciate hearing
from you on current topics and issues affecting you and our
community.
Please
let me know
areas you find especially
interesting or where I can provide you with additional
information.
I value your ideas and look forward to hearing from
you.
Sincerely,
U.S.
Representative
4th District of Utah
