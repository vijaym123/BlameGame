It should never take 13 hours for you to figure out how much money the government is going to take away from you. And yet,
according to the IRS , that is the approximate amount of time it takes the average American taxpayer to comply with the tax code -- including record-keeping, reading the rules, gathering receipts, and filling out the necessary forms.
No matter what your political beliefs, we can agree this doesnt make sense. The complexity of the current tax code places an unnecessarily heavy time and cost burden on American families and small businesses, impacting their effectiveness and productivity. Thats why Im pushing for a simpler, fairer tax code
including supporting an optional flat tax and pushing to reform the entire code. Read about my work,

Yours in service,
