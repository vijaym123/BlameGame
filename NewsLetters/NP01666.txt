Dear Friends,
Tax season is quickly
drawing to a close; the tax filing deadline is Wednesday, April
15.
As families in South Florida are filling out income tax forms,
looking for receipts, and sorting their way through mountains of
paperwork, few are thinking about fraud.
However, income tax fraud is one
of the most common types of white collar crime in the U.S.
Because of the nature of the crime, it is extremely difficult to calculate
the impact of tax fraud; however the Internal Revenue Service
estimates that more than $300 billion are lost every year to this
crime.
According to the Federal Trade Commission, Florida saw
the highest number of fraud and identity theft cases per capita of any
state in the nation in 2014. These statistics mean that members of our
community are more likely to be the victims of tax scams than anyone
else in our nation.
However, there are steps and actions that we
can take to keep us safe from white collar
criminals:
Do not carry your Social
Security card or any documents with your Social Security Number (SSN)
or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) on
it.
Never give
information to anyone calling you and claiming they work for the IRS. The IRS
will only communicate with taxpayers by
mail.
Do not give a business your SSN or
ITIN just because they ask. Give it only when
required.
Check your credit
report every 12
months.
Protect your personal computers by using firewalls,
anti-spam/virus software, update security patches and change passwords for
Internet
accounts.
Never give personal information over the phone, through the
mail or on the Internet unless you have initiated the contact or you are
sure you know who you are dealing
with.
If you are having a hard time filling
out your taxes or have questions, please contact a CPA or tax
professional to help you with the process.
You should also
reach out to your tax professional and ensure
that:
Only one tax return was filed
under your
name
You have no balance due, refund offset or have had collection
actions taken against you for any unfilled
returns.
Your state or federal
benefits were reduced or cancelled because the agency received information
reporting an income change.
Income tax fraud is a serious
problem that impacts many in our community and our nation.
However, by being vigilant and following some safe practices, we can help
ensure a decrease in income tax fraud and safeguard our financial
security.
Should you need help filling out your federal
income taxes, members of the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program
(VITA) at Miami-Dade College can help.
VITA coordinators at the
Wolfson Campus (305) 237-3151, the Hialeah Campus (305) 237-8620, or the
InterAmerican Campus (305) 237-6484 for assistance but residents can
get tax assistance from VITA anywhere in Miami-Dade
County.
Sincerely,
Ileana
