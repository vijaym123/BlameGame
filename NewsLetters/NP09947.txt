Foster
Representing the 11th District

Dear Friend,
One of the biggest barriers to college today is the cost.
Skyrocketing textbook costs, along with the high costs of tuition, room
and board, create a financial barrier that has become increasingly
difficult for students and families to
overcome.
To help remove that barrier,
Ive introduced legislation to increase the accessibility of high quality
educational materials, making higher education more affordable and
accessible for students.
The Learning Opportunities with Creation
of Open Source Textbooks (LOW COST) Act will make high quality
educational materials freely accessible to the general public, saving
students money on textbooks and making higher education more affordable and
accessible.
Click here to learn more about the LOW COST
Act.
Congressman Bill Foster meets with students at
Aurora University.
The College Board
has reported that students spend over $1,200 a year on college books
and supplies. Free, open-source textbooks could help students
struggling with debt after finishing college, reducing the debt from a 4-year
college program by as much as
$5,000.
As a scientist and businessman, I know
how critical education is to economic success. Making higher education
affordable and accessible is a key component to supporting jobs and
economic development in our community.
We cant support job
growth without a skilled workforce. Posting these open source materials is
a common sense solution that will allow our students to have access to
the most up-to-date and accurate information available
without the
burden of high prices.
