Dear Friend, $20,000.
For most families in the Commonwealth, $20,000 is a huge sum of money. For most donors in the Koch brothers&rsquo; network, $20,000 is a drop in the bucket.
And to us, $20,000 is where we need to be before the FEC deadline tonight at midnight --
move us closer to our goal by giving $5.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
This is our biggest goal of the year so far, and hitting this fundraising target will help us grow our network. The money you contribute will help us build a firewall against whichever group of anonymous donors decides to attack next.
We&rsquo;re not looking for Koch-network-sized checks from a few anonymous donors -- we&rsquo;re looking for lots of small contributions from people like you. Give $5 and help us reach this goal before the FEC deadline.
Thank you for your support.
Ed
