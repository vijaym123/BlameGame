Friend,
I know we ask a lot. But I&rsquo;m not kidding when I say outsider spending against me is just shy of $10 MILLION --
in fact, I&rsquo;m NUMBER ONE on their list.
What&rsquo;s that mean? With two weeks to go, Republican outsiders still think they can throw endless money at us to buy this race for their handpicked candidate.
Let me be clear:
I don&rsquo;t care how many lists I&rsquo;m on. I&rsquo;ll never stop fighting for you.
But I can&rsquo;t win this on my own. Doug Ose has the full financial backing of the Republican establishment.
So please, I need your support now more than ever. Please use the links below to pitch in what you can tonight.

Make no mistake, I truly appreciate everything you&rsquo;re doing.
But Election Day is two weeks from tonight. And how we do will come down to how we respond now while we still have the chance.
Please, dig deep -- every dollar makes a difference.
Be well,
Ami
