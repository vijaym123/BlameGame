This week, I was able to travel through
north Idaho, meeting and talking with constituents, including hosting
town halls in Post Falls and Ponderay.
In the town halls, the
issues that came up most frequently were President Obamas abuse of
power (on things ranging from Obamacare to immigration to burdensome
regulations) and the need for Congress and the White House to advance
positive, constructive solutions.
I couldnt agree
more.
I believe our elected officials need to unify behind smart,
innovative policies that put people first.
Its not good enough to say
Obamas policies are bad.
We need to champion
better
policies.
We need to give the American people a compelling
alternative
something that will inspire people, improve peoples lives,
and get our country moving again.
Other issues that
came up were government spending,
PILT , immigration,
and the minimum wage.
About 250 folks showed up at Post Falls
and about 110 showed up at Ponderay
great turnout.

Another highlight from my trip was
touring Thorne Research, one of Idahos most dynamic companies.
Founded in 1984 and based in Sandpoint, Thorne Research manufactures and
formulates excellent dietary supplements, employing over 250
people.
When I was in Boise at the start of the week, I had the chance
to tour Hawkins Company and Healthwise, another pair of great Idaho
companies.
I also went to Boise State University to meet Barbara
Morgan, their Distinguished Educator in Residence.
We had a
great, in-depth conversation about how Idaho can become a leader in STEM
(Science, Technology, Engineering and
Mathematics).
Throughout the week, I was able to spend some time with the local media.
I met with the editors of the
Coeur d'Alene Press
and the
Bonner County Daily Bee.
I also spent some time with Mike
Fitzsimmons on KXLY.
Before I go, one final note:
This month, I announced my annual nominations to the U.S. service
academies.
I was honored to nominate 32 extraordinary young
Idahoans who met the exacting requirements to earn these nominations. To
see the full list of nominees, please click

It was great to be in Idaho this week, and I want to thank
you for giving me the privilege of serving you in Congress.
I
remain grateful for your trust and confidence.
