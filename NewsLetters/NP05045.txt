Friend -- President Obama emailed you this morning.
Now I&rsquo;m emailing you this afternoon.
It&rsquo;s because tonight&rsquo;s final-week Get Out The Vote deadline WILL determine Senate control.
I need EVERY SINGLE DEMOCRAT to read this email closely:
Democrats are surging at the exact right moment -- even in Mitch McConnell&rsquo;s Kentucky.
But 11 races are now within five points.
ELEVEN!
The Senate is a total toss-up. That&rsquo;s just plain alarming with 9 days left.
Friend, our final-week Get Out The Vote operation WILL win us the Senate -- but we have a $72,645 budget hole to fill.
Will you pitch in? The entire election literally depends on it -- so we&rsquo;re TRIPLE MATCHING gifts until midnight!
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
Democratic candidates are weathering attack after attack from Karl Rove and the Koch brothers in these final NINE days. I REFUSE to let these lies tip this election to the GOP.
If we can fully fund our final-week GOTV push, we can go out in full force in tight battleground states and TEAR this election away from the Republicans! It&rsquo;d be a truly heartbreaking last-second loss for them.
But if we can&rsquo;t meet our GOTV budget goal, that means fewer canvasses, fewer phone calls to voters, fewer poll watchers. The result? A win for McConnell and the GOP.
Will you pitch in to our final-week Get Out The Vote operation before the midnight deadline? Gifts will be triple matched!
Let&rsquo;s win in these final 9 days!
Thanks,
Harry Reid
Senate Majority Leader
