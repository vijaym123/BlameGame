Bipartisan Coalition Introduces USA FREEDOM Act
I'm leading a bipartisan coalition of congressmen to introduce
comprehensive legislation to rein in the federal government's
unconstitutional surveillance of Americans
.
The USA FREEDOM Act, H.R. 3361, reforms parts of the USA PATRIOT Act
that have been used to surveil Americans' telephone records and
Internet activity, according to recent leaks. I joined Rep. Jim
Sensenbrenner (R-WI), Rep. John Conyers (D-MI), Rep. Zoe Lofgren
(D-CA), and more than 70 cosponsors in the House of Representatives.
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-VT) introduced the
companion bill in the Senate.
The days of unfettered spying on the American people are numbered. This
legislation ceases the government's unconstitutional surveillance, and
I am thrilled that my distinguished colleagues are rallying behind it.
The comprehensive bill reforms several provisions in the Patriot Act
that reportedly have been used to commit privacy abuses. First, the
bill ends the government's blanket collection of Americans' records.

E-SURVEY
Have you and your family experienced positive or negative results from
the implementation of Obamacare?
Obamacare is helping my family and me.
Obamacare is hurting my family and me.
So far, Obamacare has mixed results for my family and me.
It is not yet clear whether Obamacare is helping or hurting my family
and me.

Second, it increases the transparency of government
surveillance. It ends the era of secret law by requiring FISA court
opinions to be made available to all congressmen and summaries of the
opinions to be made publicly available. Gag orders on
telecommunications companies are modified so that the companies can
make more information about government surveillance available to
customers.
Third, the bill increases privacy protections. It installs a Special
Advocate to argue on behalf of Americans' privacy before the FISA
court, and the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board receives
subpoena power to perform its duties.
Introduction of the Freedom Act marks a major acceleration in the
movement to reform government surveillance. The Amash-Conyers
amendment, which was substantively incorporated into the Freedom Act,
failed narrowly on a 205-217 vote in July. Eight of the Freedom Act's
original cosponsors voted against Amash-Conyers. Representative
Sensenbrenner and Senator Leahy are the primary authors of the Patriot
Act, which the Freedom Act reforms.
Monitoring the Implementation of Obamacare
"If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your
health care plan. Period."
President Obama made this statement
in 2009. Four years later, it is reported that
millions of Americans are losing their current health insurance because
of Obamacare. Obamacare forces many individuals to purchase health
coverage they do not want or need, and it is driving up the cost of
health insurance for millions of individuals and families.
Meanwhile, the website to sign up for the new Obamacare exchanges has
experienced numerous technical problems. House committees such as the
Committee on Oversight and Government Reform
, of which I am a member, the Committee on Ways and
Means
, and the
Committee on Energy and Commerce
continue to monitor these issues and conduct investigations.
I remain committed to working with my colleagues toward health care
reforms that will limit costs and improve health care for Americans.

Military Service Academy Night

R. Ford Presidential Museum from 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Representatives
from the five United States service academies
