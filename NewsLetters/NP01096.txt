David --
Women have made enormous strides over the past few decades, but many of our economic policies are still stuck in the past and hurting families.
That's why Cheri is fighting hard each day to increase economic security and opportunity for working women and all middle class families.
This includes:
Expanding affordable health care
Ensuring paid sick leave
Working for equal pay for equal work
Making the minimum wage a livable wage
Stand with Cheri and expand economic security and opportunity &gt;&gt;
Cheri truly believes that when women succeed, families succeed, and all our communities succeed. http://act.cheribustos.com/expand-security
