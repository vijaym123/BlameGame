President Obama Tours Devastation in
Oso, Snohomish Co. Receives Critical FEMA
Grant
Washington
Conservation Corps members currently
deployed in Oso.
Last week, President Obama joined me in
Oso to meet with officials on the ground,
survivors, and first responders. I
was so glad that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) announced it will
provide Snohomish County with $7.5 million
as part of its Public Assistance (PA) Grant
Program. This funding represents the first
payment as part of the PA program, which
reimburses state and local governments for
spending on recovery efforts in the
aftermath of federally declared disasters.
This funding is absolutely essential for
Snohomish County at a time when
theyve had to use every resource
available to respond to this disaster.
This is exactly why the federal
disaster designation was so important. In
the face of disasters like this, local
officials should never have to think about
the bottom line when dealing with response
and recovery efforts. This will be
the first among a number of federal
reimbursements that will come as the county
and state request payments for search and
recovery efforts.

Caregivers: Our Hidden Heroes
Our nations veterans caregivers
are the unsung heroes behind our heroes
they are the hidden heroes. They
give up their lives to care for those who
have sacrificed everything to protect our
nation
they give up their jobs,
their health care, their free time
so that they can be with those who have
been often times catastrophically wounded
in service. But the big question for
a long time has been this:
Who cares for our caregivers? Who makes
sure that their needs are being met?
Recently, I had the opportunity
to meet with some of these hidden heroes in
Seattle to discuss exactly that.
Caregivers have significantly worse
health than non-caregivers, are at higher
risk for depression, are at greater risk of
divorce, and have trouble with employment
and keeping health insurance. There is no
way we can sit by and let caregivers and
veterans face this on their own
not
when we can make it at least a little bit
easier. That is why I have long supported
congressional efforts to establish the
original veterans caregiver benefits
program and pushed VA to stop delaying
implementation of the program. And
that is why I have introduced new
legislation that renews and builds our
commitment to caregivers. My bill
will make veterans of all eras eligible for
caregiver benefits, recognize a wider array
of needs which may require caregiving,
place greater emphasis on mental health
injuries like TBI and PTSD, and will remove
restrictions on who is eligible to become a
caregiver. Under the bill, caregiver
services will also be expanded to include
child care, financial advice, and legal
counseling.

Standing with our LGBT Community
When Im back in DC, Im
always boasting about our state
and
how were leading the way in
aerospace, agriculture, technology
just to name a few. But one of the things
Im most proud of is our
states history of protecting the
rights of all citizens
especially
in the LGBT community. We understand the
idea that a persons race, religion,
gender or sexual orientation should not be
an obstacle to pursuing their dreams.
We get that here in Washington
but
unfortunately this is not the case across
the country
Despite statistics telling us LGBT
students are nearly twice as likely to
experience harassment when compared to
their heterosexual peers
there is
no federal requirement that colleges and
universities have policies to protect their
students from harassment. Thats why
I have introduced legislation that gets to
the heart of this issue by ensuring
students and schools alike have the tools
and resources necessary to not only prevent
this epidemic of harassment, but assist
victims who are too often left with no
sense of closure or recourse for their
perpetrators. I was honored to sit
down with students and faculty at the
University of Washington last week to
discuss how this bill will protect students
in Washington state and across the
country.

The Affordable Care Act is Working for
Washington
Last week, Governor Inslee and I joined
with representatives from Washington
Healthplanfinder and other health care
advocates in Seattle to celebrate the
incredible success of Washingtons
Health Benefit Exchange. I am so
proud that Washington Healthplanfinder has
been a national leader from the very start,
and has had some of the highest enrollment
counts in the entire country. The
Affordable Care Act is working.
Sometimes its hard to believe
just how far weve come in the last
four years since the Affordable Care Act
became law. Thanks to the law, millions of
Americans have received preventive services
like mammograms or colonoscopies with no
out-of-pocket costs. And now, many of our
self-employed innovators and entrepreneurs
have access to quality, affordable coverage
many of them for the very first
time. This comes on top of the 3.1
million young Americans getting covered
under their parents plan, and the
nearly 8 million seniors, who are saving
billions on prescription drugs through
Medicare. Its for all these reasons
and more that I am so proud to highlight
just how far weve come in Washington
state, and to remind anyone who might tell
you differently that we arent going
back. Were not going to let
Republicans repeal this law and take health
care away from millions of Americans.
