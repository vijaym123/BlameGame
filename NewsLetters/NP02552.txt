Friend,
Ami is turning 50 next week and he is a bit unsure about the whole situation.
On one hand, he gets to celebrate with Janine, Syd and all his friends, like you, but on the other hand, he feels like he is getting old.
After winning the most expensive Congressional race in the country, working to break through the partisan gridlock, and flying across the country nearly every weekend to come back to our district , everyone at Team Bera will agree that he has the energy and spirit of a 35 year old.
Can you pitch in $35, $50, $100 or whatever you can to remind Ami that 50 is the new 35? Click here to make a contribution in honor of Ami&rsquo;s 50 th
birthday.
We are all looking forward to celebrating with Ami and we appreciate your generosity and support to make his birthday a special day.
Thanks again,
Team Bera
P.S. Old age is simply a state of mind- click here if you agree!
