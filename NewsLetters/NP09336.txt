May 25, 2014
Dear Friend,
For generations we've told our children that if they work hard they
will be able to get ahead, because in the U.S. we've set up a system of
opportunity, what I call the Infrastructure of Opportunity, which
allows each of us- no matter where we come from- to reach our American
Dream.
However, we can't ignore that there are children in our schools and
neighborhoods who have grown up with that same guiding principle, but
because they were brought to this country without documentation, are
now stuck in limbo with a lot of potential, but an empty promise.
That is why I introduced the Opportunity for Military Academies and
Readiness (OMAR) Act to allow these young people to have the
opportunity to apply to our military service academies and eventually
serve as leaders in the only country they have ever known.
This bipartisan bill is named after Omar, a high school senior who will
be graduating in the top 10% of his class in San Antonio this year. He
arrived to the United States with his family when he was just 2 years
old and although Omar benefited from the policy known as the Deferred
Action Childhood Arrivals (DACA), he will not be able to fulfill his
lifelong dream of attending West Point and joining the U.S. Army due to
his immigration status.
I had the privilege of getting to know Omar
when he joined me as my guest to this year's State of the Union
address.
My bill would allow Omar and other promising students across our nation
to have the opportunity to fulfill their dreams by:
*
Allowing persons that are classified as Deferred Action
Childhood Arrivals (DACA) under the Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) policy to become eligible to apply to the Department of Defense
military academies.
*
Specifically, these students will have the opportunity to apply
to the three Department of Defense academies--the U.S. Military Academy
at WestPoint, the Naval Academy, and the Air Force Academy.
*
This bill will not alter the process by which a person may
naturalize through service in the armed forces. Additionally, the bill
clarifies that those who are classified as DACA must also satisfy the
requirements for admission.
Funding Our Nation's Military and Defense Programs
This week, the House of Representatives passed the National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2015, a critical bill that
authorizes spending levels for the Department of Defense for our
military and national defense programs.
The NDAA provides $513.4
billion in funding provisions for our nation's military and was adopted
by the House with overwhelming support.
I worked closely with my colleagues to ensure measures that are
important to San Antonio, our service members, and their families were
included in the legislation.
I'm particularly proud that this bill
recognizes the sacrifices of our men and women in uniform by calling
for a pay increase for military personnel, while also preserving
TRICARE, housing allowances, commissary benefits, and strengthening
educational opportunities by providing $15 million for STEM education
for Pre-K-12 students in school districts with high concentrations of
military dependent families, like in San Antonio.
Memorial Day
As we recognize Memorial Day tomorrow and remember all those who have
made the ultimate sacrifice for our country, our freedoms, and our
values, we must continue to show our appreciation and gratitude for
their service by caring for their fellow soldiers and families back at
home in every way we can and with the high quality they deserve. These
folks truly understand the meaning of these sacrifices and for that we
must never forget to extend our thanks in every way we can.
As a Representative for San Antonio - Military City, USA - I am a
strong advocate for our soldiers and veterans.
I will continue to
ensure that my work in Congress supports the more than 2 million troops
and reservists, their families, and 22 million veterans across our
country and safeguards the benefits they deserve.
Our country owes an immeasurable amount of gratitude to those who have
served in uniform. I'm hopeful that my colleagues in Congress will join
me in opening up opportunities and expanding this honor to all who are
willing to sacrifice to protect our freedoms and defend our nation.
Sincerely,
Member of Congress
Join Me....

Dear
Friend,
For
generations
we&#8217;ve
told
our
children
that
if
they
work
hard
they
will
be
able
to
get
ahead,
because
in
the
U.S.
we&#8217;ve
set
up
a
system
of
opportunity,
what
I
call
the
Infrastructure
of
Opportunity,
which
allows
each
of
us&#8212;
no
matter
where
we
come
from&#8212;
to
reach
our
American
Dream.
However,
we
can&#8217;t
ignore
that
there
are
children
in
our
schools
and
neighborhoods
who
have
grown
up
with
that
same
guiding
principle,
but
because
they
were
brought
to
this
country
without
documentation,
are
now
stuck
in
limbo
with
a
lot
of
potential,
but
an
empty
promise.
That
is
why
I
introduced
the
Opportunity
for
Military
Academies
and
Readiness
(OMAR)
Act
to
allow
these
young
people
to
have
the
opportunity
to
apply
to
our
military
service
academies
and
eventually
serve
as
leaders
in
the
only
country
they
have
ever
known.
This
bipartisan
bill
is
named
after
Omar,
a
high
school
senior
who
will
be
graduating
in
the
top
10%
of
his
class
in
San
Antonio
this
year.
He
arrived
to
the
United
States
with
his
family
when
he
was
just
2
years
old
and
although
Omar
benefited
from
the
policy
known
as
the
Deferred
Action
Childhood
Arrivals
(DACA),
he
will
not
be
able
to
fulfill
his
lifelong
dream
of
attending
West
Point
and
joining
the
U.S.
Army
due
to
his
immigration
status.
I
had
the
privilege
of
getting
to
know
Omar
when
he
joined
me
as
my
guest
to
this
year&#8217;s
State
of
the
Union
address.
My
bill
would
allow
Omar
and
other
promising
students
across
our
nation
to
have
the
opportunity
to
fulfill
their
dreams
by:
Allowing
persons
that
are
classified
as
Deferred
Action
Childhood
Arrivals
(DACA)
under
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
(DHS)
policy
to
become
eligible
to
apply
to
the
Department
of
Defense
military
academies.
Specifically,
these
students
will
have
the
opportunity
to
apply
to
the
three
Department
of
Defense
academies -- the
U.S.
Military
Academy
at
WestPoint,
the
Naval
Academy,
and
the
Air
Force
Academy.
This
bill
will
not
alter
the
process
by
which
a
person
may
naturalize
through
service
in
the
armed
forces.
Additionally,
the
bill
clarifies
that
those
who
are
classified
as
DACA
must
also
satisfy
the
requirements
for
admission.
Funding
Our
Nation&#8217;s
Military
and
Defense
Programs
This
week,
the
House
of
Representatives
passed
the
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
(NDAA)
for
Fiscal
Year
2015,
a
critical
bill
that
authorizes
spending
levels
for
the
Department
of
Defense
for
our
military
and
national
defense
programs.
The
NDAA
provides
$513.4
billion
in
funding
provisions
for
our
nation&#8217;s
military
and
was
adopted
by
the
House
with
overwhelming
support.
I
worked
closely
with
my
colleagues
to
ensure
measures
that
are
important
to
San
Antonio,
our
service
members,
and
their
families
were
included
in
the
legislation.
I&#8217;m
particularly
proud
that
this
bill
recognizes
the
sacrifices
of
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
by
calling
for
a
pay
increase
for
military
personnel,
while
also
preserving
TRICARE,
housing
allowances,
commissary
benefits,
and
strengthening
educational
opportunities
by
providing
$15
million
for
STEM
education
for
Pre-K-12
students
in
school
districts
with
high
concentrations
of
military
dependent
families,
like
in
San
Antonio.
Memorial
Day
As
we
recognize
Memorial
Day
tomorrow
and
remember
all
those
who
have
made
the
ultimate
sacrifice
for
our
country,
our
freedoms,
and
our
values,
we
must
continue
to
show
our
appreciation
and
gratitude
for
their
service
by
caring
for
their
fellow
soldiers
and
families
back
at
home
in
every
way
we
can
and
with
the
high
quality
they
deserve.
These
folks
truly
understand
the
meaning
of
these
sacrifices
and
for
that
we
must
never
forget
to
extend
our
thanks
in
every
way
we
can.
As
a
Representative
for
San
Antonio
&#8211;
Military
City,
USA
&#8211;
I
am
a
strong
advocate
for
our
soldiers
and
veterans.
I
will
continue
to
ensure
that
my
work
in
Congress
supports
the
more
than
2
million
troops
and
reservists,
their
families,
and
22
million
veterans
across
our
country
and
safeguards
the
benefits
they
deserve.
Our
country
owes
an
immeasurable
amount
of
gratitude
to
those
who
have
served
in
uniform.
I'm
hopeful
that
my
colleagues
in
Congress
will
join
me
in
opening
up
opportunities
and
expanding
this
honor
to
all
who
are
willing
to
sacrifice
to
protect
our
freedoms
and
defend
our
nation.
Sincerely,
Member
of
Congress
