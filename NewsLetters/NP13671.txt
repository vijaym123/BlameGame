David,
The renewable energy industry here in Iowa is a major part of our
state's economy, providing us with thousands of good-paying jobs.
However, the EPA is proposing major changes to the Renewable Fuel
Standard that could drastically scale back this important industry in
our state.
That's why, just recently, I reached out to you and other folks across
Iowa to share your stories
about how the renewable energy
industry affects you personally so I could share them with the EPA.
The response has been really overwhelming, so I want to share with you
a few stories that were sent in:
Iowa and the heartland states are proud to deliver a product that helps
America. To retreat from this previously approved mandate is wrong and
will hurt all of agriculture - America's greatest resource.
-Bill from Eldridge, IA
Scaling back the renewable fuels standard will cost our community jobs
and financial resources. We need to be decreasing our dependence on oil
and investing in sustainable resources that support our local
economies.
-Justin in Nevada, IA
If the forces that oppose renewable energy have their way, Iowa and the
nation will lose the skills, passion, and creativity of the next
generation of workers who wish to produce clean, affordable energy. I
can only hope that our leaders will support renewable energy -- we need
exactly this sort of job, and our nation needs this sort of clean
energy now more than ever.
-Marc in Cedar Rapids, IA
I join my fellow Republican and Democratic lawmakers from across the
state, including Governor Branstad, Senators Harkin and Grassley and
many more, to call on the EPA to reconsider their proposal.
And I'm honored to add your voice to this movement. If you haven't yet
told your story, click here and I will share it with the EPA.
All the best,
Bruce
P.S. If you know someone who would also like to share their story,
please forward this email to them.
