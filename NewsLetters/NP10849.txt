April 6, 2014
Dear Friend,
My thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by the tragedy at
Fort Hood.
Our hearts are heavy with the loss of our own, especially
when these men and women have already sacrificed so much to protect our
country's values and freedoms.
Visiting the Troops
Last week, I had the opportunity to visit the U.S. military troops
stationed in Afghanistan.
I met with impressive men and women from San
Antonio and across Texas and expressed our nation's gratitude for their
service. I am extremely proud of these soldiers' courage and was
honored to present them with a Texas flag and letters from students
from Tafolla Middle School and Kuentz Elementary School to remind them
of home.
My visit was a clear reminder that we must continue to show our
appreciation by caring for our soldiers and their families when they
are away and supporting them when they come home. These soldiers guard
the freedoms we enjoy every day and for that we must never forget to
extend our thanks in every way we can.
ACA Enrollments Top 7.1 Million
With the close of the open enrollment period this week, 7.1 million
Americans, including hundreds of thousands of Texans, have signed up
for affordable, quality healthcare coverage through the Affordable Care
Act. Folks want access to essential health services such as
preventative care exams and cancer screenings and the peace of mind of
knowing that they have a safety net in the event of an unforeseen
emergency.
The coalition in San Antonio of healthcare professionals, hospitals,
county and city officials, and community organizations working to
enroll folks in healthcare plans gained national recognition for their
efforts as a model for successful community engagement.
They worked
tirelessly to ensure folks had the information and assistance they
needed to select a plan that was best for them and their families.
Unfortunately, the House Republican leadership attempted to repeal the
Affordable Care Act for the 52nd time this week, even after millions of
folks flocked to get health care coverage thanks to this law.
During
the debate over the bill, I discussed the importance of affordable,
quality healthcare and the impact it is already having on millions of
Americans who now have coverage.
If you tried to enroll in health coverage by the March 31st deadline
but did not finish your application, you may still be able to get
coverage for this year.
You must finish the enrollment process by
April 15th to have coverage beginning on May 1st. There are events
going on around the city to help you finish your application process
before the April 15th deadline.
Here is some helpful information:
*	To check if you are eligible to finish your application or for
more information on the Affordable Care Act
*	Visit: Healthcare.gov
or
CuidadoDeSalud.gov
*	For a list of helpful enrollment events in San Antonio
*	Visit http://bexarhealthmarketplace.org
As a Representative for San Antonio - Military City, USA - I am a
strong advocate for our soldiers and veterans, many of whom call San
Antonio home.
I will continue to ensure that my work in Congress
reflects the needs of San Antonians and supports our troops, military
families, and communities in San Antonio and across the nation.
Sincerely,
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
My
thoughts
and
prayers
are
with
everyone
affected
by
the
tragedy
at
Fort
Hood.
Our
hearts
are
heavy
with
the
loss
of
our
own,
especially
when
these
men
and
women
have
already
sacrificed
so
much
to
protect
our
country&#8217;s
values
and
freedoms.
Visiting
the
Troops
Last
week,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
visit
the
U.S.
military
troops
stationed
in
Afghanistan.
I
met
with
impressive
men
and
women
from
San
Antonio
and
across
Texas
and
expressed
our
nation&#8217;s
gratitude
for
their
service.
I
am
extremely
proud
of
these
soldiers&#8217;
courage
and
was
honored
to
present
them
with
a
Texas
flag
and
letters
from
students
from
Tafolla
Middle
School
and
Kuentz
Elementary
School
to
remind
them
of
home.
My
visit
was
a
clear
reminder
that
we
must
continue
to
show
our
appreciation
by
caring
for
our
soldiers
and
their
families
when
they
are
away
and
supporting
them
when
they
come
home.
These
soldiers
guard
the
freedoms
we
enjoy
every
day
and
for
that
we
must
never
forget
to
extend
our
thanks
in
every
way
we
can.
ACA
Enrollments
Top
7.1
Million
With
the
close
of
the
open
enrollment
period
this
week,
7.1
million
Americans,
including
hundreds
of
thousands
of
Texans,
have
signed
up
for
affordable,
quality
healthcare
coverage
through
the
Affordable
Care
Act.
Folks
want
access
to
essential
health
services
such
as
preventative
care
exams
and
cancer
screenings
and
the
peace
of
mind
of
knowing
that
they
have
a
safety
net
in
the
event
of
an
unforeseen
emergency.
The
coalition
in
San
Antonio
of
healthcare
professionals,
hospitals,
county
and
city
officials,
and
community
organizations
working
to
enroll
folks
in
healthcare
plans
gained
national
recognition
for
their
efforts
as
a
model
for
successful
community
engagement.
They
worked
tirelessly
to
ensure
folks
had
the
information
and
assistance
they
needed
to
select
a
plan
that
was
best
for
them
and
their
families.
Unfortunately,
the
House
Republican
leadership
attempted
to
repeal
the
Affordable
Care
Act
for
the
52nd
time
this
week,
even
after
millions
of
folks
flocked
to
get
health
care
coverage
thanks
to
this
law.
During
the
debate
over
the
bill,
I
discussed
the
importance
of
affordable,
quality
healthcare
and
the
impact
it
is
already
having
on
millions
of
Americans
who
now
have
coverage.
If
you
tried
to
enroll
in
health
coverage
by
the
March
31st
deadline
but
did
not
finish
your
application,
you
may
still
be
able
to
get
coverage
for
this
year.
You
must
finish
the
enrollment
process
by
April
15th
to
have
coverage
beginning
on
May
1st.
There
are
events
going
on
around
the
city
to
help
you
finish
your
application
process
before
the
April
15th
deadline.
Here
is
some
helpful
information:
