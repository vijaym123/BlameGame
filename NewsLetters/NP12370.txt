Dear Friend:
Today, as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, I held a hearing on the economic importance of maintaining federal investments in our transportation infrastructure.
There will be devastating impacts felt across the economy if the Highway Trust Fund runs out of funds later this year, and we must not let that happen.
