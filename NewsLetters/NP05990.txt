MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: All Gifts TRIPLE-MATCHED
President Obama, Joe Biden, and Hillary Clinton asked for your help. Now until midnight, all donations are
TRIPLE-MATCHED.
President Obama, Joe Biden, and Hillary Clinton wouldn&rsquo;t have emailed you if we didn&rsquo;t need your help.
-- Boehner&rsquo;s launching his biggest TV ad blitz of the entire election --
$6,OOO,OOO
-- TODAY
-- It's also the FINAL quarterly fundraising deadline of the election -- and we&rsquo;re falling dangerously behind!
That&rsquo;s a crushing combo of bad news.
But here&rsquo;s the good news: Yesterday at 1:00PM EST, we received the last donation we needed to unlock the TRIPLE-MATCH!
David, control of Congress is at stake. Please don&rsquo;t waste this opportunity.
