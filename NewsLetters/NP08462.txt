Riverside Makerspace Vocademy Participates in White House Maker Faire
Last week, Vocademy, a Riverside based makerspace, was invited to
participate in the first ever White House Maker Faire, which brought
more than 100 students, entrepreneurs, engineers and researchers from
25 states to Washington to showcase their inventions and advocate for
ways to grow the maker movement through innovation and
entrepreneurship.
Vocademy Founder and CEO Gene Sherman was accompanied at the White
House with Representative Mark Takano (D-Riverside), who co-founded the
Congressional Maker Caucus.
"Vocademy is an education-focused makerspace, one of the first of its
kind in this country," said Sherman. "Not just a place where people
have access to the tools of making, it's where they can learn
everything about the tools and then use these skills to make anything
they desire.
Sherman continued, "I feel incredibly fortunate that I live in a city
that is truly embracing the Maker Movement. Our Mayor, Rusty Bailey, is
participating in the Mayor Maker Challenge. Our Congressman, Mark
Takano, spearheaded the Congressional Maker Caucus. They recognize that
hands-on skills are important to the progress of the community and they
see how a makerspace is valuable to education, manufacturing, and
technology industries. They understand that the future of invention and
innovation will be found within the maker movement."
"For the past century, innovation and entrepreneurship has helped
propel the American economy," said Takano, "but with global competition
increasing, developing new industries like the maker movement right
here in the United States could not be more important. Makerspaces like
Vocademy are an important part of this burgeoning industry, as they
look to harness the power of America's best and brightest. Riverside is
playing an important part in the growing maker community, and having
the White House recognize that will only help grow this industry and
provide the fuel to make America a manufacturing powerhouse once again."

Rep. Mark Takano Releases Statement on Vergara Ruling
Earlier this month, Rep. Takano released the following statement after
a Los Angeles Superior Court ruled teacher tenure as being
unconstitutional:
"Today's decision by the Los Angeles Superior Court ruling that teacher
tenure laws are unconstitutional is disappointing. After spending more
than 20 years as a classroom teacher, I learned that we are better off
with teachers who see the profession as a mission and that great
teachers develop over time with hard work and support from
administrators. I am open to reviewing and adjusting tenure laws, but I
don't believe that the frustration with a few bad apples justifies
stripping away this workforce protection. Calling teacher tenure
unconstitutional ignores research that shows the importance of
experience to a teacher's success. If critics of teacher unions are
concerned about the quality of education students may be receiving,
then we should be doing more to provide teachers with opportunities to
enhance their skills, not strip them of their workforce protections."

"Vocademy

&#8220;I

that
is

the
Maker

Our
Mayor,

Our

Mark

spearheaded

&#8220;For
the
past
century,
innovation
and
entrepreneurship
has
helped
propel
the
American
economy,&#8221;
said
Takano,
&#8220;but
with
global
competition
increasing,
developing
new
industries
like
the
maker
movement
right
here
in
the
United
States
could
not
be
more
important.
Makerspaces
like
Vocademy
are
an
important
part
of
this
burgeoning
industry,
as
they
look
to
harness
the
power
of
America&#8217;s
best
and
brightest.
Riverside
is
playing
an
important
part
in
the
growing
maker
community,
and
having
the
White
House
recognize
that
will
only
help
grow
this
industry
and
provide
the
fuel
to
make
America
a
manufacturing
powerhouse
once
again.&#8221;
Rep.

Rep.

released
the
following
statement
after
a

decision
by
the
Los

Superior

ruling
that

is
disappointing.
After
spending
more
than
20

I
learned
that
we

I

that

Calling
teacher

success.
If
critics

then
we
should
be
doing
