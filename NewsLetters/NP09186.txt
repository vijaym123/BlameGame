Dear Friend:
I hope you and your family had an enjoyable Memorial Day weekend, and
were able to reflect on the tremendous sacrifices made by our brave
veterans.
Having just finished up another busy two weeks, I wanted to
provide you with a quick update on some of the latest news from
Washington, D.C. and Florida's Second Congressional District.
VA Scandal Survey Results
Last weekend our constituent survey focused on the current scandal
facing the Veterans Affairs (VA) Department.
With news reports showing
veterans were purposely hidden on secret waiting lists to hide their
lengthily wait times, I asked if you thought the Secretary of VA Eric
Shinseki should resign. 56% said they thought the Secretary should
resign - while 19% said no and 25% needed more information.
Like many Americans, I've been infuriated by these reports.
To restore
the trust of America's heroes, the people who did this must be held
responsible and that starts at the top.
That's why I sent a letter
to Secretary Shinseki demanding his resignation last
week.
I am pleased the President acted and asked for Secretary
Shinseki's resignation.
Now it's time to get someone in there who can
clean up this mess.
Water Resources Victory for North Florida
The House and Senate passage of the Water Resources Reform and
Development Act (WRRDA) last week represents a major victory for North
Florida's oystermen, coastal businesses and maritime industries.
I am
proud that this legislation includes a hard-fought provision I
championed aimed at ending the tri-state water dispute that has crushed
Apalachicola Bay and its oyster industry.
It also strengthens our
small and emerging ports, like Port Panama City and Port of Port St.
Joe.
This bipartisan legislation is a huge step forward for North
Florida and it was done with no earmarks.
Seeking Immediate Relief for Gulf Fishermen
The government's continued mismanagement of the Gulf of Mexico fishery
has caused serious harm to Florida's coastal economies.
While it is
clear long-term changes are needed, I have sent a letter
to Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker outlining immediate
actions she can take to address the insufficient nine-day red snapper
season recently handed down to Gulf of Mexico fishermen.
Taking a Leading Role in Fisheries Reauthorization
This past week the House Natural Resources Committee approved it's
draft of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the primary law governing America's
fisheries.
The committee also adopted five amendments I proposed to
inject common sense into fishery data collection and fishery disaster
declarations.
The legislation represents an important first step in
ensuring our fishermen have a voice in establishing any new catch share
programs, while addressing inflexibility in rebuilding plans and moving
us closer to a data collection solution.
I look forward to ensuring
our fishermen's interests are addressed as I work with members of both
parties to pass a Magnuson-Stevens Act reauthorization in the House
this year.
Combating Human Trafficking
Recent human trafficking arrests
in Tallahassee demonstrate how real and widespread this problem
has truly become.
Recently, the House took action and passed a series
of bipartisan bills that I cosponsored aimed at combating human
trafficking.
As the father of four daughters, I refuse to stand by
while so many of our children are put at risk of being exploited
through this modern day form of slavery.
I look forward to building
upon these efforts and working towards the ultimate goal of eliminating
human trafficking.
Disaster Relief for Jackson County
Jackson County residents can now apply for federal disaster assistance
in response to last month's heavy floods.
According to FEMA,
assistance can include money for temporary housing and home repairs,
and for other serious disaster-related needs, such as child care
assistance, medical and dental expenses, or funeral and burial costs.
Information on how and where to get registered can be found here

Sincerely,
Steve Southerland, II

Dear

I

an

weekend,
and
were
able
to
reflect
on
the
tremendous
sacrifices
made
by
our

Having
just
finished

I
wanted
to
provide
you
with

VA

With

56%
said
they

resign
&#8211;

no
and
25%

Like
