The Scalise Capitol Report
Friday, May 2,
2014
One step closer to Morganza to the Gulf flood
protection
After nearly 20 years
of bureaucratic red-tape, we are now at the doorstep of Congress
finally authorizing the Morganza to the Gulf Hurricane Protection Project in
the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRDA).
This
week, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee officially
reviewed the Chiefs Report for the Morganza to the Gulf
Hurricane Protection Project submitted by the Army Corps of
Engineers.
Getting Morganza to the Gulf authorized has been one of my top
priorities because it means stronger flood protection and peace of mind for
hard-working families throughout southeast Louisiana.
This
paramount project is vital, not only for hurricane surge protection for
residents in southeast Louisiana, but also for protecting the energy
infrastructure that delivers 20 percent of our nation's oil and
gas.
Requesting a hold on nomination of HHS
Secretary
Sylvia Burwells nomination as
Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services should not be
considered on the Senate floor until she agrees to treat all American
people fairly under Obamacare.
As I continue fighting to repeal
Obamacare and replace it with reforms that lower health costs, some of
my colleagues in the Louisiana delegation and I wrote a letter to
Senators Landrieu and Vitter, asking them to stand with us in protecting
Louisiana families from the harmful effects and penalties of Obamacare
by using every tool available to them, including a hold on Burwells
nomination.
More than 92,000 Louisianans have had their health
insurance plans canceled, and some individuals in our home state are
seeing their health insurance premiums increase by more than 100
percent.
Unfortunately, while these scenarios are playing out across
the country, President Obama continues to pick political favorites
through selective exemptions from the Affordable Care Act.
No
president has the authority to write their own set of laws, and it is wholly
unfair for these families to still be threatened with penalties from
the IRS while the Administration has unilaterally delayed or changed
the law at least 20 times to grant relief to
others.

Demanding
accountability for Benghazi
The House of Representatives will be voting to establish a
Select Committee on Benghazi. Unfortunately, the time for answers from
the Obama Administration on Benghazi is long overdue. Four brave
Americans lost their lives in this preventable tragedy, and their loved ones
and our nation deserve the answers that I believe a House Select
Committee on Benghazi will finally get out of this Administration.
I
look forward to voting in favor of the establishment of this Select
Committee so we can finally get the answers that the American people
deserve.
Addressing the rise of drug
abuse
Im very concerned with the rise in
heroin-related deaths in southeast Louisiana.
At a hearing this
week in Washington, I voiced those concerns to representatives from the
Drug Enforcement Agency and the Office of National Drug Control Policy,
among others.
I commend our local officials on the work theyve
done to educate the community in an effort to reduce these alarming
statistics.
