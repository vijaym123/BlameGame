Greetings:
Our military men and women make tremendous sacrifices to protect our
freedoms. We recognize and honor their commitment every day and
especially on Veterans Day which we celebrated earlier this month.
Earlier this month we also celebrated 125 years of North Dakota
statehood. We would not be where we are without the determination and
moral fortitude of the pioneers who settled North Dakota. God has
abundantly blessed us, and like the Pilgrims and Native Americans at
the first Thanksgiving, it is to Him we turn to give thanks. Mikey and
I wish you a very Happy Thanksgiving and holiday season.
The headlines mid-month were dominated in part by President Obama's
executive order on immigration. I do not support his decision to act
alone. He circumvented Congress after a midterm election that sent a
clear message that the American people want the president and Congress
to work together to solve problems. I believe the right approach is to
secure the border, enforce existing immigration laws and work with
Congress on immigration reform.
Also this month, the Keystone XL Pipeline - which, as we highlighted in
our September newsletter, has waited more than six years for approval -
was again in the national spotlight as the Senate voted on the project.
Though the legislation did not pass, I believe we will have enough
votes to pass it and send it to the President's desk after the new
Congress is seated in January.
Below we talk about these and other happenings important for North
Dakota.
Sincerely,
John Hoeven
U.S. Senator

Keystone XL Pipeline
Hoeven: "Keystone XL Pipeline Is in the Interest of the American
People"
Senator Highlights Continued Efforts to Create Comprehensive National
Energy Plan After Keystone XL Approval Vote
WASHINGTON -Senator John Hoeven issued the following statement after
the U.S. Senate fell short of passing his Keystone XL approval bill:
"We did not gain the 60 votes necessary in the Senate to pass my bill
to approve the Keystone XL pipeline. Even had it passed, however,
President Obama has indicated that he intends to veto the bill. I
believe we will have the votes to pass the bill in January when a
number of new Senators who support my legislation take office and the
new Congress begins." Click here to read more.

Greetings:
Our
military
men
and
women
make
tremendous
sacrifices
to
protect
our
freedoms.
We
recognize
and
honor
their
commitment
every
day
and
especially
on
Veterans
Day
which
we
celebrated
earlier
this
month.
Earlier
this
month
we
also
celebrated
125
years
of
North
Dakota
statehood.
We
would
not
be
where
we
are
without
the
determination
and
moral
fortitude
of
the
pioneers
who
settled
North
Dakota.
God
has
abundantly
blessed
us,
and
like
the
Pilgrims
and
Native
Americans
at
the
first
Thanksgiving,
it
is
to
Him
we
turn
to
give
thanks.
Mikey
and
I
wish
you
a
very
Happy
Thanksgiving
and
holiday
season.
The
headlines
mid-month
were
dominated
in

by
President
Obama&#8217;s
executive

on
immigration.
I
do
not
support
his

to
act

He
circumvented
Congress
after
a
midterm
election
that
sent
a
clear
message
that
the
American
people
want
the
president
and
Congress
to
work
together
to
solve
problems.
I
believe
the
right
approach
is
to
secure
the
border,
enforce
existing
immigration
laws
and
work
with
Congress
on
immigration
reform.
A lso
this
month,
the
Keystone
XL
Pipeline
&#8212;
which,
as
we
highlighted
in
our
September

has
waited
more

&#8212;
was
