Renewing my promise to veterans
Dear David,
When I voted for the bipartisan budget in December to help put our country on more sound financial footing, I pledged to keep working on the measure to make sure it works for Montanans.
That&rsquo;s why, this week, I voted to repeal the change in the annual Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) increase for military retirees included in the budget bill.
I am pleased that we were successful in repealing this change.
I voted for the bipartisan budget deal because it cuts our deficit by billions of dollars and makes smart investments in education and infrastructure that will help create jobs.
Voting against the budget would have been irresponsible &ndash; and an endorsement of the gridlock plaguing Washington.
Folks in Montana want a common-sense budget, but not one that balances its books on the backs of veterans who signed up to fight for our country.
Thanks to this week&rsquo;s vote, Montana&rsquo;s and America&rsquo;s military retirees will continue to get the benefits they earned.
Moving forward, I will continue to find common-sense ways to move our nation forward while honoring our hard-working military men and women.
As a member of the Senate Veterans&rsquo; Affairs Committee, it&rsquo;s a responsibility that I take very seriously.
It&rsquo;s an honor to serve you in the U.S. Senate.
Be well, and keep in touch.
