Dear Friend,
It is not every day that Republicans and Democrats come together in
support of the same projects. But it is heartening to see many of the
people's representatives joining forces in urging the White House to
act in the best interests of our country by ending the delay in
approving construction of the Keystone XL pipeline to create thousands
of jobs and to bring much-needed oil from Canada to the United States.
It has been six years since the review process began and the State
Department's Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement shows no
significant impact on the environment. It clears the way for President
Obama to give this important project the green light. Building the
Keystone pipeline will create thousands of direct jobs for construction
workers, welders, mechanics, electricians, pipefitters, and heavy
equipment operators. In addition, tens of thousands of jobs will be
created through the supply chain. Economists estimate the Keystone
pipeline will create 20,000 manufacturing and construction jobs with an
additional 118,000 spin-off jobs.
America must find solutions to its energy needs while putting Americans
back to work. And construction of the Keystone XL pipeline is a step in
the right direction. Unions want it and the people are demanding it. It
Is time to stop the stalling and to approve this worthy project.
On another matter, I recently spoke from the floor of the House in
support of the A-10 jet aircraft that is in danger of being prematurely
retired. The A-10 has provided air support for American forces in Iraq,
Afghanistan, and elsewhere. It has been described by the Air Force
Chief of Staff as the best airplane in the world at what it does. In my
comments, I encouraged the Air Force not to retire the A-10 before its
replacement plane reaches full capacity. Early retirement could
unnecessarily threaten American servicemembers in future conflicts.
As Americans, we have no greater responsibility than ensuring the
safety of our men and women in uniform by providing them with the
support they need to accomplish their missions and return home safely.
The A-10 is still a valuable asset to our national defense. It is not
yet time to retire this tried and true "veteran" of American military
warfare.
Finally, I want to share the important work being done by the Missouri
Veterans History Project (MVHP), a Columbia-based not-for-profit
corporation organized to interview and record the stories of our
veterans. The MVHP, which was founded in 2011, trains volunteers to
collect the stories of our veterans, organizes community-based groups
to interview as many veterans as possible, and makes these recordings
available to the State Historical Society of Missouri, the Library of
Congress, and Missouri's veterans.
I urge veterans who want to tell their stories, volunteers who want to
interview veterans about their stories, and those who would like to
provide financial support or assist in other efforts to contact the
Missouri Veterans History Project by calling 573-522-4220 or emailing
at info@mvhp.net
. Recording the memories of
Missouri's military veterans is a most valuable effort and allows this
rich history to be preserved for today's and future generations.
Have a great week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
It
is
not
every
day
that
Republicans
and
Democrats
come
together
in

of
the
same
projects.
But
it
is
heartening
to
see
many

the
people&#8217;s
representatives

forces
in

the
White
House
to

of
our
country
by
ending
the

construction
of
the
Keystone
XL
pipeline
to
create
thousands
of
jobs
and
to
bring
much-needed
oil
from
Canada
to
the
United
States.
It
has
been
six
years
since
the
review
process
began
and
the
State
Department&#8217;s
Final
Supplemental
Environmental
Impact
Statement
shows
no
significant

on
the
environment.
It
clears
the
way
for
President

to
give
this
important

the
green

Building
the
Keystone

will
create
thousands
of
direct
jobs
for
construction
workers,
welders,
mechanics,
electricians,
pipefitters,
and
heavy

In
addition,
tens
of
thousands

will
be
created
through
the

the
Keystone

will
create
20,000

with
an

118,000
spin-off
jobs.
America
must
find
solutions
to
its

while
putting
Americans
back
to

And
construction
of
the
Keystone

is
a

in
the
right

Unions
want
it
and
the
people
are
demanding

It
Is

to

and
to

this
worthy
project.
On
another
matter,
I
recently

from
the
floor
of
the
House
in
support
of
the
A-10
jet
aircraft
that
is
in
danger
of
being
prematurely
retired.
The
A-10
has
provided
air
support
for
American
forces
in
Iraq,
Afghanistan,
and
elsewhere.
It
has
been
described
by
the
Air
Force
Chief
of
Staff
as
the
best
airplane
in
the
world
at
what
it
does.
In
my
comments,
I
encouraged
the
Air
Force
not
to
retire
the
A-10
before
its
replacement
plane
reaches
full
capacity.
Early
retirement
could
unnecessarily
threaten
American
servicemembers
in
future
conflicts.
As
Americans,
we
have
no
greater
responsibility
than
ensuring
the
safety
of
our
men
and
women
in

by
providing
them
with
the

they
need
to
accomplish
their
missions
and
return
home
safely.
The
A-10
is
still
a
valuable
asset
to
our
national
defense.
It
is
not
yet
time
to
retire
this
tried
and
true
&#8220;veteran&#8221;
of
American
military
warfare.
Finally,
I
want
to
share
the
important
work
being
done
by
the
Missouri
Veterans
History
Project
(MVHP),
a
Columbia-based
not-for-profit

The
MVHP,
which
was

trains

makes
these

available
to
the
State
Historical
Society
of
Missouri,
the
Library
of

and
Missouri&#8217;s
veterans.
I
urge
veterans
who
want
to
tell
their
stories,
volunteers
who
want
to
interview
veterans
about
their
stories,
and
those
who
would

Recording

is
a
most
valuable

and
allows

Have
