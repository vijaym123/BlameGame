These three words mean bad news for Illinois families: Paul Ryan&rsquo;s budget.
When this budget is released, it&rsquo;ll be full of the same preschool program-cutting, Medicare-slashing, poverty-inducing measures that he proposed last year. That&rsquo;s why Cheri is going on offense.
She&rsquo;s standing with leaders across the country to reach one million strong standing up to Ryan before he releases his reckless budget proposal. Will you help us get there? ONE MILLION STRONG:
Sign your name to stand up to Paul Ryan&rsquo;s extreme budget &gt;&gt;
Many Illinois families are still struggling to make ends meet and provide for their children. It would be cruel to pull the rug out from under them. But that&rsquo;s exactly what Paul Ryan wants to do.
Ryan&rsquo;s draconian proposals are unacceptable, and we have to take action to defeat them. SIGN ON:
