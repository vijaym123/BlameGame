That didn&rsquo;t take long&hellip;
Hillary JUST announced that she&rsquo;s running for President, but she&rsquo;s already facing Republican attacks. We are NOT going to let the Republicans ruin this historic moment.
Let&rsquo;s show that we&rsquo;re standing together to win the White House, win Congress, and win the real change Americans are demanding. [24-HOUR GOAL: 10,000 Donations for Democrats]
