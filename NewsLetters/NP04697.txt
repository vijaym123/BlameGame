REVIEW
I spent
Monday in Russellville on the campus of Arkansas Tech
my alma mater! It
was great to finally meet Techs new President, Dr. Bowen, and of
course, have a double-double at Whatta-Burger!
On Thursday, I spent the day in Fort Smith. My
first stop was to speak at the Regional Chamber of Commerces Annual
Gala, where we celebrated the 3,300 new jobs that have been created in
Fort Smith in the past two years. The Fort Smith region is uniquely
situated to be the center of a resurgence of American productivity, and
when you consider the confluence of systems
river, rail, air, and
interstates
and
available energy resources, I believe this trend will continue and
that Fort Smiths best days are ahead. You can catch up on my remarks in
this article from the
Times Record .
Next Tuesday, our nation celebrates
Veterans Day by taking time to honor all veterans
young and old, present
and past
and paying tribute to the men and women who defend
our freedom.
On Thursday afternoon, I kicked off the celebrations
early by attending
Golden
Livings Veterans Day event . Thank you to Golden
Living for serving the Fort Smith Community for 50 years and for
inviting me to participate in the festivities and speak to your staff on
this most important holiday.
Every veteran is a hero, and while we
celebrate and honor them on November 11th, these heroes serve 365 days a
year.
So on Saturday, Ill continue honoring our veterans
by
speaking at the
Pig Trail
Harley-Davidson Veterans Day Ceremony . But I believe
a day should never go by in which we take for granted the selfless
sacrifices they have made to protect us and our freedoms.
Our
nation is forever indebted to them. To our past, current, and future
service members, I say thank you.
From the Front...
