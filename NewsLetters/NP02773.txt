Kansas Common Sense
February 17, 2015
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thank you for your continued interest
in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
We Are One - Fort Riley Listening Session
On Monday morning, I had a productive breakfast meeting at Fort Riley
with U.S. Army leadership from the Pentagon to discuss the impact of
potential force reductions to the Big Red One. The Army is in this
position because Congress passed and the President signed a Budget
Control Act that requires reduced defense spending. This makes no sense
when global threats continue put to our country in jeopardy and at
risk. As plans for force reductions are reviewed, the investment that
has already been made in infrastructure, space and community support
would be difficult to walk away from. Brigadier General Roger Cloutier
and I discussed the importance of troop strength at Fort Riley and its
value to the Army.
Later in the afternoon, I accompanied Brigadier General Cloutier to the
official Listening Session at the Geary County Convention Center where
more than 4,200 members of the community and state gathered to share
how vital the installation is to the community, state and country.
After visiting with Brigadier General Cloutier and knowing what he
learned from Kansans that evening, I believe he recognizes that Kansans
support, care and respect those serving our country at Fort Riley. More
importantly, I think Brigadier General Cloutier was able to see just
how special the Fort Riley community is, not only in support of the
soldiers in the Big Red One but for the entire U.S. Army. Kansans
expressed gratitude and appreciation to those who serve our country and
their families.
I will do everything I can to reduce the impact of sequestration and
make certain Fort Riley receives the support it deserves from the
Pentagon, so the Armed Forces and the Big Red One can continue to
defend our nation. Fort Riley is America's First Division - the place
in which we defend our nation. It is a place where we defend our
values, ensure that those who follow us - our kids and grandkids - live
with the freedoms and liberties that many of Kansans sacrificed and Big
Red One soldiers serve to protect. A special thanks to Major General
Funk who provided his own comments from Iraq and his wife, Beth, who
attended to convey her support for the Fort Riley community. In Major
General Funk's absence, Acting Senior Commander and Deputy Commanding
General, Brigadier General Eric Wesley did a wonderful job on behalf of
Fort Riley and our troops.
Salina Aviation Roundtable
On Monday, I was in Salina to lead an aviation summit for Kansas
stakeholders. The roundtable discussion included Kansas airport
operators
and officials from the Kansas Department of Transportation
(KDOT) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), as well as
various representatives of the aviation industry and private pilots. As
a member of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Aviation Operations,
Safety and Security for the 114th Congress, Monday's event was an
opportunity for me to hear firsthand about their legislative priorities
for 2015, a year in which Congress must tackle FAA Reauthorization
before funding expires in September. The conversation touched on many
important topics, ranging from Essential Air Service to the Federal
Contract Tower Program to FAA's implementation of rules regarding the
commercial use of Unnamed Aerial Systems.
Prior to passage of the most recent FAA Reauthorization in 2012,
Congress unfortunately resorted to nearly two dozen short-term
extensions. The message I received on Monday is that these short-term
patches are terribly disruptive to Kansas airports, who need certainty
and stability in order to plan ahead and invest in the facilities and
technologies necessary to maximize safety and efficiency at our
airports. I will work diligently to ensure a safer and more efficient
air traffic system that will allow the aviation industry in Kansas to
continue to grow and prosper. Many thanks to Tim Rogers, Executive
Director at Salina Airport Authority, for his hospitality and his
leadership in assembling Monday's aviation roundtable.
A VA Worthy of Veterans' Service - Tell Your Story
Veterans deserve a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that is worthy
of their service and sacrifice for our nation. When the Senate and
House came together to pass the Choice Act last summer, there was a
sense of hope among veterans, their families and the American people
that it was the start of dramatic change at the VA. Six months later,
many veterans are still unable to access the care they need because of
numerous problems with Choice Act implementation.
It is clear that we are not prepared for the servicemen and women who
are returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan, and we are not capable of
caring for our aging veterans - particularly those from the Vietnam era
- as we promised we would and as every American knows we should.
Unfortunately, common sense is not prevailing and the VA continues to
operate in the same bureaucratic fashion.
To veterans and their families - I want to hear about your experience
with the Choice Act Program. Too often the personal story of a veteran
who is struggling to get the help he or she deserves goes unheard. I
want to make certain the VA listens and commits to transformation of a
bureaucracy that is a disservice to our veterans. Click here
to share your
experience. I will do my best to respond in a timely fashion and make
certain the VA hears your story.
Meeting with VA Secretary Bob McDonald
This week, a few colleagues and I met with the Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA) Secretary Bob McDonald to discuss the VA's fiscal year
2016 budget request. Spending at the VA has increased 74 percent since
2009, and just six months after the Veterans Access, Choice and
Accountability Act of 2014 (Choice Act) was signed into law, the VA is
requesting a reallocation of the law's emergency funds that are solely
meant to pay for veteran health care to support "investments in the VA
System priorities."
The goal of the Choice Act is to offer access to timely, quality and
cost-effective care for our nation's heroes. I am frustrated that even
with a new law and new leadership in place, the VA system continues to
overlook what is in the best interest of veterans. I'm also afraid we
are only just beginning to fully grasp the Choice Act's implementation
issues. I will press Secretary McDonald on this further at a full
Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee Hearing later this month.
Veterans TRICARE Choice Act
On Wednesday, I introduced the Veterans TRICARE Choice Act of 2015, S.
448, which would give TRICARE-eligible veterans, dependents and those
serving in the Reserve Component the ability to pause TRICARE benefits
in order to contribute to a Heath Savings Account (HSA) as well as
receive contributions from their employer. This bipartisan legislation
addresses the inequities of current federal law, which prevents
TRICARE-eligible individuals from participating in an HSA program.
Veterans and their families deserve the highest-quality health care for
their service to our country. They should not be denied the opportunity
to select the best health care option for their needs just because of
their service to our country. HSAs have proven to be an effective way
to pay for medical costs and proactively save for future medical
expenses. Employees invest and save tax-free money in HSAs, which are
then used to pay for qualified medical expenses. Our nation's heroes
should not have to opt out of the TRICARE benefits they earned just
because they want to participate in an HSA program offered by their
employer. The Veterans TRICARE Choice Act of 2015 would make certain
that members of the military, both past and present, have the same
opportunity as their coworkers to select the health care plan they want.
Frustration with VA Health System Continues
This week, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health system was
added to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) "high risk"
list - a biannual report focused on agencies at high risk of waste,
fraud and mismanagement and recommends ways to improve their
performance and accountability. The addition of the VA health system
unfortunately does not come as a surprise, and it adds to the
frustration my colleagues and I feel as we continue to demand
accountability and leadership within the VA system. When the Senate and
House came together to pass the Choice Act last summer, there was a
sense of hope among veterans, their families and the American people
that it was the start of dramatic change at the VA. Six months later,
many veterans are still unable to access the care they need because of
numerous problems with the Choice Act implementation. The GAO's listing
of the VA health system raises real concerns that common sense is not
prevailing and the VA continues to operate in the same bureaucratic
fashion.
I met with VA Secretary McDonald the day before the GAO list was
released to discuss VA priorities, and I continue to ask why the VA is
not bending over backwards to implement the Choice Act as it was
intended and take care of our veterans. I look forward to addressing
this issue directly with the VA Secretary when he testifies before the
Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee on Feb. 26, and I will share with
him the stories of Kansas veterans who continue to struggle to access
the care they were promised under the Choice Act.
In the absence of dramatic change at the VA, it is clear that we are
not prepared for the servicemen and women who are returning home from
Iraq and Afghanistan, and we are not capable of caring for our aging
veterans - particularly those from the Vietnam era - as we promised we
would and as every American knows we should. I will not rest until our
veterans have a Department of Veterans Affairs worthy of their service
and sacrifice.
Clay Hunt Legislation Signed into Law
I am pleased that President Obama signed the Clay Hunt Suicide
Prevention for American Veterans Act into law on Thursday. As a sponsor
of this bill and a Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee Member, I am
proud this important legislation will finally be enacted and begin to
help our veterans.
The average suicide rate among veterans is a staggering 22 deaths each
day. This bill will help develop a VA system capable of offering
first-rate mental health care services, as well as utilize the
expertise of outside organizations to provide support for those
returning home and struggling with the invisible wounds of war. I can
think of no better way to honor the memory of Clay Hunt, a Marine
veteran who committed suicide in March 2011 at the age of 28.
During a Senate Veterans Affairs' Committee hearing in last fall, I had
the opportunity to learn about his compelling story of sacrifice for
our country and struggle with the VA from Clay's mom, Susan Selke. No
mother, father or family member should suffer with the loss of their
loved one because of failures in the VA health care system. President
Obama should take quick action in signing this important legislation so
the VA has the ability to care for our suffering service members who
are not receiving the care they need. Click here

Correcting the President's Comments on Paris Terror Attack
This week, President Obama was featured in an interview where he spoke
about the recent terror attacks in Paris, France. The President
described this attack as "randomly shoot[ing] a bunch of folks in a
deli." This strange description of the hostage taking and murder of
four Jews in a Kosher supermarket is deeply concerning.
When asked to clarify the President's comments, a White House spokesman
stated that the Jewish victims of this attack were "killed not because
of who they were, but because of where they randomly happened to be."
Given media reports that the attacker declared his intention to target
Jewish people, the Obama Administration's repeated comments that chalk
up this targeted attack to "randomness" are bizarre and concerning. The
Obama Administration should be doing everything it can to clearly
describe the threat of terrorism. The stakes are simply too high to
operate under anything but a full understanding of the significant
challenges our Americans and our allies face. I shared these concerns
in a speech
on the Senate floor this week. My speech was featured
on Fox News'Special Report program.
Privacy Notice Modernization Act
This week I introduced the Privacy Notice Modernization Act, S. 423.
This bipartisan legislation would streamline the financial privacy
notifications that banks provide consumers. Under current law,
consumers are inundated with written notices that are often confusing,
duplicative and become so routine that they are commonly discarded
without being read. By enacting a commonsense notification policy, we
can ensure consumers are receiving timely alerts of policy changes in a
format that is accessible and on-demand, while at the same time
unburdening our community banks from erroneous regulation.
Striking a regulatory balance is vital for American businesses and
consumers as we seek to grow and strengthen our economy. Unfortunately,
community banks are being disproportionately hurt by overregulation and
notification requirements because they have less capacity to absorb the
compliance costs. By reducing these costs and providing more relevant
information to the consumer, our community banks can focus on what they
do best - serving the community. I look forward to working with my
colleagues in the Senate to ensure swift passage of this commonsense
legislation. Click here
to learn more.
U.S. Chamber of Commerce Announces Support for Startup Act
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which represents 3 million companies
across the United States in addition to business associations and state
and local chambers, has announced its support for Startup Act - a
bipartisan jobs plan I introduced that is aimed at jumpstarting the
economy through the creation and growth of new businesses. In a letter
this week, Executive Vice President for Government Affair at the
Chamber R. Bruce Josten said, "Unleashing and fostering the
entrepreneurial spirit has been the hallmark of sustained economic
growth in the United States since the nation's inception. For more than
a decade we have seen this economic engine sputter through a drag on
the traditional strength of business formation. This trend has slowly
started to reverse with the passage of the bi-partisan Jumpstart Our
Business Startups Act ("JOBS Act"). The bi-partisan Startup Act is
another important step in reversing that trend. Continued efforts to
restart the business formation engine are critical for the economy to
grow and create jobs."
Startup Act, which is based on research and analysis by the Ewing
Marion Kauffman Foundation based in Kansas City, modifies the tax code
to encourage investment in new businesses, accelerates the
commercialization of university research that can lead to new ventures,
and seeks to improve the regulatory process. Research shows that for
close to three decades, companies less than five years old have created
almost all net new jobs in America - averaging about 3 million jobs
each year. I am pleased the business community has recognized the power
of these policies to create jobs and economic growth, and I am hopeful
that with new leadership in the Senate, the Startup will no longer be
denied a vote. Click here
to read the full text of the U.S. Chamber's letter
to Sen. Moran on Startup Act.
Recognizing the Importance of Community Service
On Tuesday morning, I met with leaders of several Senior Corps programs
across our state to visit about the importance of community service and
volunteering. Senior Corps is an organization that connects Americans
older than 55 with opportunities to contribute their expertise and job
skills to their respective communities. Three of the these initiatives
are the Retired Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP), the Foster Grandparent
Program, and the Senior Companion Program. Foster Grandparents serve as
tutors and mentors to Kansas students. Senior Companions help homebound
seniors and other adults maintain independence in their own homes. And,
RSVP volunteers conduct safety patrols, renovate homes, tutor and
mentor youth, respond to natural disasters, and provide other services
across the state. More than 5,300 Kansas seniors contribute their time
and talents through participation in these programs.
That evening, I joined these Kansas Senior Corps directors at the 12th
Annual Friends of National Service Awards event. I was honored to
receive an award at this event and humbled to join a bipartisan group
of advocates in support of national service. As a nation, we must make
sure that we make smart decisions regarding our federal budget.
National service and community volunteering represent exceedingly
cost-effective solutions to some of the nation's most pressing
challenges. These initiatives connect dedicated and caring citizens to
those in need. They are genuine examples of neighbors helping
neighbors, which is the foundation of the special way of life we live
in Kansas and in communities across this great nation. Thank you to
Melody Gault of Augusta, Lori Bishop of Manhattan, Connie Stewart of
Topeka, and Brittany Crabtree of Topeka for their insight on the
benefits of community service and their commitment to supporting
Kansans.
Visiting with Leaders of Kansas Community Colleges
Administrators and trustees representing our state's community colleges
traveled to Washington this week to meet with the Kansas Congressional
Delegation and attend the Association of Community College Trustees'
2015 National Legislative Summit. I had the opportunity to visit with
leadership of Johnson County Community College to learn more about the
latest developments on their campus and the issues impacting their
institution. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Education
Subcommittee, which has authority over the budget of the U.S.
Department of Education, these conversations are very useful in helping
me assess how the Department's higher education initiatives are
impacting Kansas students and colleges.
Executive Order on Cybersecurity
On Friday, President Obama issued an executive order related to
improving critical cybersecurity infrastructure. Recent high-profile
data breaches demonstrate the significant cyber threats that businesses
and consumers face in our digital world. The President's actions today
are not a complete solution, but do help prepare a policy foundation on
which Congress can build a robust legislative strategy to solving the
data security challenges American businesses face. I hope the President
will keep his commitment to work with Congress to align incentives for
American businesses to protect themselves and consumers. As Chairman of
the Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Data Security, I
will continue my efforts to provide solutions to these important
issues.
On Thursday Feb. 5, 2015, I chaired a hearing
of the Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer
Protection, Product Safety, Insurance and Data Security entitled,
"Getting it Right on Data Breach and Notification Legislation in the
114th Congress." The hearing featured testimony from experts to inform
committee efforts in crafting a federal data breach bill, and focused
on issues including the consumer benefits of a uniform federal law in
place of disparate state laws, the timeliness of notification to
consumers, and how sensitive personally identifiable information should
be defined.
Applications Available for Summer 2015 Internships
I am currently accepting internship applications for my Washington,
D.C. and Kansas offices for summer 2015. An internship, either

Kansas
Common
Sense
February
17,
2015
Hello,
Welcome
to
" Kansas
Common
Sense ."
Thank
you
for
your
continued
interest
in
receiving
my
weekly
newsletter.
Please
feel
free
to
forward
it
on
to
your
family
and
friends
if
it
would
interest
them.
We
Are
One
&ndash;
Fort
Riley
Listening
Session
On
Monday
morning,
I
had
a
productive
breakfast
meeting
at
Fort
Riley
with
U.S.
Army
leadership
from
the
Pentagon
to
discuss
the
impact
of
potential
force
reductions
to
the
Big
Red
One.
The
Army
is
in
this
position
because
Congress
passed
and
the
President
signed
a
Budget
Control
Act
that
requires
reduced
defense
spending.
This
makes
no
sense
when
global
threats
continue
put
to
our
country
in
jeopardy
and
at
risk.
As
plans
for
force
reductions
are
reviewed,
the
investment
that
has
already
been
made
in
infrastructure,
space
and
community
support
would
be
difficult
to
walk
away
from.
Brigadier
General
Roger
Cloutier
and
I
discussed
the
importance
of
troop
strength
at
Fort
Riley
and
its
value
to
the
Army.
Later
in
the
afternoon,
I
accompanied
Brigadier
General
Cloutier
to
the
official
Listening
Session
at
the
Geary
County
Convention
Center
where
more
than
4,200
members
of
the
community
and
state
gathered
to
share
how
vital
the
installation
is
to
the
community,
state
and
country.
After
visiting
with
Brigadier
General
Cloutier
and
knowing
what
he
learned
from
Kansans
that
evening,
I
believe
he
recognizes
that
Kansans
support,
care
and
respect
those
serving
our
country
at
Fort
Riley.
More
importantly,
I
think
Brigadier
General
Cloutier
was
able
to
see
just
how
special
the
Fort
Riley
community
is,
not
only
in
support
of
the
soldiers
in
the
Big
Red
One
but
for
the
entire
U.S.
Army.
Kansans
expressed
gratitude
and
appreciation
to
those
who
serve
our
country
and
their
families.
I
will
do
everything
I
can
to
reduce
the
impact
of
sequestration
and
make
certain
Fort
Riley
receives
the
support
it
deserves
from
the
Pentagon,
so
the
Armed
Forces
and
the
Big
Red
One
can
continue
to
defend
our
nation.
Fort
Riley
is
America's
First
Division
&ndash;
the
place
in
which
we
defend
our
nation.
It
is
a
place
where
we
defend
our
values,
ensure
that
those
who
follow
us
&ndash;
our
kids
and
grandkids
&ndash;
live
with
the
freedoms
and
liberties
that
many
of
Kansans
sacrificed
and
Big
Red
One
soldiers
serve
to
protect.
A
special
thanks
to
Major
General
Funk
who
provided
his
own
comments
from
Iraq
and
his
wife,
Beth,
who
attended
to
convey
her
support
for
the
Fort
Riley
community.
In
Major
General
Funk's
absence,
Acting
Senior
Commander
and
Deputy
Commanding
General,
Brigadier
General
Eric
Wesley
did
a
wonderful
job
on
behalf
of
Fort
Riley
and
our
troops.
Salina
Aviation
Roundtable
On
Monday,
I
was
in
Salina
to
lead
an
aviation
summit
for
Kansas
stakeholders.
The
roundtable
discussion
included
Kansas
airport
operators
and
officials
from
the
Kansas
Department
of
Transportation
(KDOT)
and
the
Federal
Aviation
Administration
(FAA),
as
well
as
various
representatives
of
the
aviation
industry
and
private
pilots.
As
a
member
of
the
Senate
Commerce
Subcommittee
on
Aviation
Operations,
Safety
and
Security
for
the
114th
Congress,
Monday's
event
was
an
opportunity
for
me
to
hear
firsthand
about
their
legislative
priorities
for
2015,
a
year
in
which
Congress
must
tackle
FAA
Reauthorization
before
funding
expires
in
September.
The
conversation
touched
on
many
important
topics,
ranging
from
Essential
Air
Service
to
the
Federal
Contract
Tower
Program
to
FAA's
implementation
of
rules
regarding
the
commercial
use
of
Unnamed
Aerial
Systems.
Prior
to
passage
of
the
most
recent
FAA
Reauthorization
in
2012,
Congress
unfortunately
resorted
to
nearly
two
dozen
short-term
extensions.
The
message
I
received
on
Monday
is
that
these
short-term
patches
are
terribly
disruptive
to
Kansas
airports,
who
need
certainty
and
stability
in
order
to
plan
ahead
and
invest
in
the
facilities
and
technologies
necessary
to
maximize
safety
and
efficiency
at
our
airports.
I
will
work
diligently
to
ensure
a
safer
and
more
efficient
air
traffic
system
that
will
allow
the
aviation
industry
in
Kansas
to
continue
to
grow
and
prosper.
Many
thanks
to
Tim
Rogers,
Executive
Director
at
Salina
Airport
Authority,
for
his
hospitality
and
his
leadership
in
assembling
Monday's
aviation
roundtable.
A
VA
Worthy
of
Veterans'
Service
&ndash;
Tell
Your
Story
Veterans
deserve
a
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
that
is
worthy
of
their
service
and
sacrifice
for
our
nation.
When
the
Senate
and
House
came
together
to
pass
the
Choice
Act
last
summer,
there
was
a
sense
of
hope
among
veterans,
their
families
and
the
American
people
that
it
was
the
start
of
dramatic
change
at
the
VA.
Six
months
later,
many
veterans
are
still
unable
to
access
the
care
they
need
because
of
numerous
problems
with
Choice
Act
implementation.
It
is
clear
that
we
are
not
prepared
for
the
servicemen
and
women
who
are
returning
home
from
Iraq
and
Afghanistan,
and
we
are
not
capable
of
caring
for
our
aging
veterans
&ndash;
particularly
those
from
the
Vietnam
era
&ndash; as
we
promised
we
would
and
as
every
American
knows
we
should. Unfortunately,
common
sense
is
not
prevailing
and
the
VA
continues
to
operate
in
the
same
bureaucratic
fashion.
To
veterans
and
their
families
&ndash;
I
want
to
hear
about
your
experience
with
the
Choice
Act
Program.
Too
often
the
personal
story
of
a
veteran
who
is
struggling
to
get
the
help
he
or
she
deserves
goes
unheard.
I
want
to
make
certain
the
VA
listens
and
commits
to
transformation
of
a
bureaucracy
that
is
a
disservice
to
our
veterans.
Click
here
to
share
your
experience.
I
will
do
my
best
to
respond
in
a
timely
fashion
and
make
certain
the
VA
hears
your
story.
Meeting
with
VA
Secretary
Bob
McDonald
This
week,
a
few
colleagues
and
I
met
with
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
Secretary
Bob
McDonald
to
discuss
the
VA's
fiscal
year
2016
budget
request.
Spending
at
the
VA
has
increased
74
percent
since
2009,
and
just
six
months
after
the
Veterans
Access,
Choice
and
Accountability
Act
of
2014
(Choice
Act)
was
signed
into
law,
the
VA
is
requesting
a
reallocation
of
the
law's
emergency
funds
that
are
solely
meant
to
pay
for
veteran
health
care
to
support
"investments
in
the
VA
System
priorities."
The
goal
of
the
Choice
Act
is
to
offer
access
to
timely,
quality
and
cost-effective
care
for
our
nation's
heroes.
I
am
frustrated
that
even
with
a
new
law
and
new
leadership
in
place,
the
VA
system
continues
to
overlook
what
is
in
the
best
interest
of
veterans.
I'm
also
afraid
we
are
only
just
beginning
to
fully
grasp
the
Choice
Act's
implementation
issues.
I
will
press
Secretary
McDonald
on
this
further
at
a
full
Senate
Veterans'
Affairs
Committee
Hearing
later
this
month.
Veterans
TRICARE
Choice
Act
On
Wednesday,
I
introduced
the
Veterans
TRICARE
Choice
Act
of
2015,
S.
448,
which
would
give
TRICARE-eligible
veterans,
dependents
and
those
serving
in
the
Reserve
Component
the
ability
to
pause
TRICARE
benefits
in
order
to
contribute
to
a
Heath
Savings
Account
(HSA)
as
well
as
receive
contributions
from
their
employer.
This
bipartisan
legislation
addresses
the
inequities
of
current
federal
law,
which
prevents
TRICARE-eligible
individuals
from
participating
in
an
HSA
program.
Veterans
and
their
families
deserve
the
highest-quality
health
care
for
their
service
to
our
country.
They
should
not
be
denied
the
opportunity
to
select
the
best
health
care
option
for
their
needs
just
because
of
their
service
to
our
country.
HSAs
have
proven
to
be
an
effective
way
to
pay
for
medical
costs
and
proactively
save
for
future
medical
expenses.
Employees
invest
and
save
tax-free
money
in
HSAs,
which
are
then
used
to
pay
for
qualified
medical
expenses.
Our
nation's
heroes
should
not
have
to
opt
out
of
the
TRICARE
benefits
they
earned
just
because
they
want
to
participate
in
an
HSA
program
offered
by
their
employer.
The
Veterans
TRICARE
Choice
Act
of
2015
would
make
certain
that
members
of
the
military,
both
past
and
present,
have
the
same
opportunity
as
their
coworkers
to
select
the
health
care
plan
they
want.
Frustration
with
VA
Health
System
Continues
This
week,
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
health
system
was
added
to
the
U.S.
Government
Accountability
Office
(GAO)
"high
risk"
list
&ndash;
a
biannual
report
focused
on
agencies
at
high
risk
of
waste,
fraud
and
mismanagement
and
recommends
ways
to
improve
their
performance
and
accountability.
The
addition
of
the
VA
health
system
unfortunately
does
not
come
as
a
surprise,
and
it
adds
to
the
frustration
my
colleagues
and
I
feel
as
we
continue
to
demand
accountability
and
leadership
within
the
VA
system.
When
the
Senate
and
House
came
together
to
pass
the
Choice
Act
last
summer,
there
was
a
sense
of
hope
among
veterans,
their
families
and
the
American
people
that
it
was
the
start
of
dramatic
change
at
the
VA.
Six
months
later,
many
veterans
are
still
unable
to
access
the
care
they
need
because
of
numerous
problems
with
the
Choice
Act
implementation.
The
GAO's
listing
of
the
VA
health
system
raises
real
concerns
that
common
sense
is
not
prevailing
and
the
VA
continues
to
operate
in
the
same
bureaucratic
fashion.
I
met
with
VA
Secretary
McDonald
the
day
before
the
GAO
list
was
released
to
discuss
VA
priorities,
and
I
continue
to
ask
why
the
VA
is
not
bending
over
backwards
to
implement
the
Choice
Act
as
it
was
intended
and
take
care
of
our
veterans.
I
look
forward
to
addressing
this
issue
directly
with
the
VA
Secretary
when
he
testifies
before
the
Senate
Veterans'
Affairs
Committee
on
Feb.
26,
and
I
will
share
with
him
the
stories
of
Kansas
veterans
who
continue
to
struggle
to
access
the
care
they
were
promised
under
the
Choice
Act.
In
the
absence
of
dramatic
change
at
the
VA,
it
is
clear
that
we
are
not
prepared
for
the
servicemen
and
women
who
are
returning
home
from
Iraq
and
Afghanistan,
and
we
are
not
capable
of
caring
for
our
aging
veterans
&ndash;
particularly
those
from
the
Vietnam
era
-
as
we
promised
we
would
and
as
every
American
knows
we
should.
I
will
not
rest
until
our
veterans
have
a
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
worthy
of
their
service
and
sacrifice.
Clay
Hunt
Legislation
Signed
into
Law
I
am
pleased
that
President
Obama
signed
the
Clay
Hunt
Suicide
Prevention
for
American
Veterans
Act
into
law
on
Thursday.
As
a
sponsor
of
this
bill
and
a
Senate
Veterans'
Affairs
Committee
Member,
I
am
proud
this
important
legislation
will
finally
be
enacted
and
begin
to
help
our
veterans.
The
average
suicide
rate
among
veterans
is
a
staggering
22
deaths
each
day.
This
bill
will
help
develop
a
VA
system
capable
of
offering
first-rate
mental
health
care
services,
as
well
as
utilize
the
expertise
of
outside
organizations
to
provide
support
for
those
returning
home
and
struggling
with
the
invisible
wounds
of
war.
I
can
think
of
no
better
way
to
honor
the
memory
of
Clay
Hunt,
a
Marine
veteran
who
committed
suicide
in
March
2011
at
the
age
of
28.
During
a
Senate
Veterans
Affairs'
Committee
hearing
in
last
fall,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
learn
about
his
compelling
story
of
sacrifice
for
our
country
and
struggle
with
the
VA
from
Clay's
mom,
Susan
Selke.
No
mother,
father
or
family
member
should
suffer
with
the
loss
of
their
loved
one
because
of
failures
in
the
VA
health
care
system.
President
Obama
should
take
quick
action
in
signing
this
important
legislation
so
the
VA
has
the
ability
to
care
for
our
suffering
service
members
who
are
not
receiving
the
care
they
need.

Correcting
the
President's
Comments
on
Paris
Terror
Attack
This
week,
President
Obama
was
featured
in
an
interview
where
he
spoke
about
the
recent
terror
attacks
in
Paris,
France.
The
President
described
this
attack
as
"randomly
shoot[ing]
a
bunch
of
folks
in
a
deli."
This
strange
description
of
the
hostage
taking
and
murder
of
four
Jews
in
a
Kosher
supermarket
is
deeply
concerning.
When
asked
to
clarify
the
President's
comments,
a
White
House
spokesman
stated
that
the
Jewish
victims
of
this
attack
were
"killed
not
because
of
who
they
were,
but
because
of
where
they
randomly
happened
to
be."
Given
media
reports
that
the
attacker
declared
his
intention
to
target
Jewish
people,
the
Obama
Administration's
repeated
comments
that
chalk
up
this
targeted
attack
to
"randomness"
are
bizarre
and
concerning.
The
Obama
Administration
should
be
doing
everything
it
can
to
clearly
describe
the
threat
of
terrorism.
The
stakes
are
simply
too
high
to
operate
under
anything
but
a
full
understanding
of
the
significant
challenges
our
Americans
and
our
allies
face.
I
shared
these
concerns
in
a
speech
on
the
Senate
floor
this
week.
My
speech
was
featured
on
Fox
News' Special
Report
program.
Privacy
Notice
Modernization
Act
This
week
I
introduced
the
Privacy
Notice
Modernization
Act,
S.
423.
This
bipartisan
legislation
would
streamline
the
financial
privacy
notifications
that
banks
provide
consumers.
Under
current
law,
consumers
are
inundated
with
written
notices
that
are
often
confusing,
duplicative
and
become
so
routine
that
they
are
commonly
discarded
without
being
read.
By
enacting
a
commonsense
notification
policy,
we
can
ensure
consumers
are
receiving
timely
alerts
of
policy
changes
in
a
format
that
is
accessible
and
on-demand,
while
at
the
same
time
unburdening
our
community
banks
from
erroneous
regulation.
Striking
a
regulatory
balance
is
vital
for
American
businesses
and
consumers
as
we
seek
to
grow
and
strengthen
our
economy.
Unfortunately,
community
banks
are
being
disproportionately
hurt
by
overregulation
and
notification
requirements
because
they
have
less
capacity
to
absorb
the
compliance
costs.
By
reducing
these
costs
and
providing
more
relevant
information
to
the
consumer,
our
community
banks
can
focus
on
what
they
do
best
&ndash;
serving
the
community.
I
look
forward
to
working
with
my
colleagues
in
the
Senate
to
ensure
swift
passage
of
this
commonsense
legislation.

U.S.
Chamber
of
Commerce
Announces
Support
for
Startup
Act
The
U.S.
Chamber
of
Commerce,
which
represents
3
million
companies
across
the
United
States
in
addition
to
business
associations
and
state
and
local
chambers,
has
announced
its
support
for
Startup
Act
&ndash;
a
bipartisan
jobs
plan
I
introduced
that
is
aimed
at
jumpstarting
the
economy
through
the
creation
and
growth
of
new
businesses.
In
a
letter
this
week,
Executive
Vice
President
for
Government
Affair
at
the
Chamber
R. Bruce
Josten
said,
"Unleashing
and
fostering
the
entrepreneurial
spirit
has
been
the
hallmark
of
sustained
economic
growth
in
the
United
States
since
the
nation's
inception.
For
more
than
a
decade
we
have
seen
this
economic
engine
sputter
through
a
drag
on
the
traditional
strength
of
business
formation.
This
trend
has
slowly
started
to
reverse
with
the
passage
of
the
bi-partisan
Jumpstart
Our
Business
Startups
Act
("JOBS
Act").
The
bi-partisan
Startup
Act
is
another
important
step
in
reversing
that
trend.
Continued
efforts
to
restart
the
business
formation
engine
are
critical
for
the
economy
to
grow
and
create
jobs."
Startup
Act,
which
is
based
on
research
and
analysis
by
the
Ewing
Marion
Kauffman
Foundation
based
in
Kansas
City,
modifies
the
tax
code
to
encourage
investment
in
new
businesses,
accelerates
the
commercialization
of
university
research
that
can
lead
to
new
ventures,
and
seeks
to
improve
the
regulatory
process.
Research
shows
that
for
close
to
three
decades,
companies
less
than
five
years
old
have
created
almost
all
net
new
jobs
in
America
&ndash;
averaging
about
3
million
jobs
each
year.
I
am
pleased
the
business
community
has
recognized
the
power
of
these
policies
to
create
jobs
and
economic
growth,
and
I
am
hopeful
that
with
new

Recognizing
the
Importance
of
Community
Service
On
Tuesday
morning,
I
met
with
leaders
of
several
Senior
Corps
programs
across
our
state
to
visit
about
the
importance
of
community
service
and
volunteering.
Senior
Corps
is
an
organization
that
connects
Americans
older
than
55
with
opportunities
to
contribute
their
expertise
and
job
skills
to
their
respective
communities.
Three
of
the
these
initiatives
are
the
Retired
Senior
Volunteer
Program
(RSVP),
the
Foster
Grandparent
Program,
and
the
Senior
Companion
Program.
Foster
Grandparents
serve
as
tutors
and
mentors
to
Kansas
students.
Senior
Companions
help
homebound
seniors
and
other
adults
maintain
independence
in
their
own
homes.
And,
RSVP
volunteers
conduct
safety
patrols,
renovate
homes,
tutor
and
mentor
youth,
respond
to
natural
disasters,
and
provide
other
services
across
the
state.
More
than 5,300 Kansas
seniors
contribute
their
time
and
talents
through
participation
in
these
programs.
That
evening,
I
joined
these
Kansas
Senior
Corps
directors
at
the
12th
Annual
Friends
of
National
Service
Awards
event.
I
was
honored
to
receive
an
award
at
this
event
and
humbled
to
join
a
bipartisan
group
of
advocates
in
support
of
national
service.
As
a
nation,
we
must
make
sure
that
we
make
smart
decisions
regarding
our
federal
budget.
National
service
and
community
volunteering
represent
exceedingly
cost-effective
solutions
to
some
of
the
nation's
most
pressing
challenges.
These
initiatives
connect
dedicated
and
caring
citizens
to
those
in
need.
They
are
genuine
examples
of
neighbors
helping
neighbors,
which
is
the
foundation
of
the
special
way
of
life
we
live
in
Kansas
and
in
communities
across
this
great
nation.
Thank
you
to
Melody
Gault
of
Augusta,
Lori
Bishop
of
Manhattan,
Connie
Stewart
of
Topeka,
and
Brittany
Crabtree
of
Topeka
for
their
insight
on
the
benefits
of
community
service
and
their
commitment
to
supporting
Kansans.
Visiting
with
Leaders
of
Kansas
Community
Colleges
Administrators
and
trustees
representing
our
state's
community
colleges
traveled
to
Washington
this
week
to
meet
with
the
Kansas
Congressional
Delegation
and
attend
the
Association
of
Community
College
Trustees'
2015
National
Legislative
Summit.
I
had
the
opportunity
to
visit
with
leadership
of Johnson
County
Community
College to
learn
more
about
the
latest
developments
on
their
campus
and
the
issues
impacting
their
institution.
As
a
member
of
the
Senate
Appropriations
Education
Subcommittee,
which
has
authority
over
the
budget
of
the
U.S.
Department
of
Education,
these
conversations
are
very
useful
in
helping
me
assess
how
the
Department's
higher
education
initiatives
are
impacting
Kansas
students
and
colleges.
Executive
Order
on
Cybersecurity
On
Friday,
President
Obama
issued
an
executive
order
related
to
improving
critical
cybersecurity
infrastructure.
Recent
high-profile
data
breaches
demonstrate
the
significant
cyber
threats
that
businesses
and
consumers
face
in
our
digital
world.
The
President's
actions
today
are
not
a
complete
solution,
but
do
help
prepare
a
policy
foundation
on
which
Congress
can
build
a
robust
legislative
strategy
to
solving
the
data
security
challenges
American
businesses
face.
I
hope
the
President
will
keep
his
commitment
to
work
with
Congress
to
align
incentives
for
American
businesses
to
protect
themselves
and
consumers.
As
Chairman
of
the
Commerce
Subcommittee
on
Consumer
Protection
and
Data
Security,
I
will
continue
my
efforts
to
provide
solutions
to
these
important
issues.
On
Thursday
Feb.
5,
2015,
I
chaired
a
hearing
of
the
Commerce
Subcommittee
on
Consumer
Protection,
Product
Safety,
Insurance
and
Data
Security
entitled,
"Getting
it
Right
on
Data
Breach
and
Notification
Legislation
in
the
114th
Congress."
The
hearing
featured
testimony
from
experts
to
inform
committee
efforts
in
crafting
a
federal
data
breach
bill,
and
focused
on
issues
including
the
consumer
benefits
of
a
uniform
federal
law
in
place
of
disparate
state
laws,
the
timeliness
of
notification
to
consumers,
and
how
sensitive
personally
identifiable
information
should
be
defined.
