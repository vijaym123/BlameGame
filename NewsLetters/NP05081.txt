NPR: SIX SENATE RACES TOO CLOSE TO CALL
PITCH IN TO HELP US WIN ALL OF THEM &gt;&gt;
Friend --
NPR
reports, &ldquo;With just over a week to go until Election Day&hellip; nearly a half dozen Senate seats look to be SO close that they&#39;re within the margin of error in the polls&rdquo; -- and that&rsquo;s EXACTLY the number Republicans need to take control.
But while this election will &ldquo;certainly com[e] down to the wire,&rdquo; the GOP is outspending us by a whopping $5 MILLION in the final stretch. If we let those THOUSANDS of attack ads go unanswered, we could lose at the last second -- and McConnell will take over.
But there&rsquo;s another way: If you step up TODAY,
we can ERASE the Republicans&rsquo; spending advantage, go on the OFFENSE, and hand the GOP a PAINFUL, DEVASTATING loss on Election Day.
Friend, we need $389,243 in grassroots funds by midnight tomorrow for our last-week ad campaign to DESTROY THE GOP. Will you pitch in TODAY? We&rsquo;ll triple-match your gift!
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
This morning, Hillary Clinton warned, &ldquo;I need you to act this second. The election is in just eight days -- this is your best chance to make an impact.
It may be our last chance as well.&rdquo;
She&rsquo;s right, because we MUST make a robust final-week ad buy if we&rsquo;re to compete with Republicans on the air AND on the ground.
And the fact is, we can ABSOLUTELY win this.
NPR
reports that despite running in red states, Democrats are holding the line:
&ldquo;Republicans are facing some Democratic incumbents who are hanging tough against some bad odds.&rdquo;
If you pitch in now, we&rsquo;re going to meet and BEAT our ad buy goal, kick McConnell OUT of office, and RIP this election out of the GOP&rsquo;s grasp.
Will you help us make it happen? All gifts will be triple-matched until midnight!
