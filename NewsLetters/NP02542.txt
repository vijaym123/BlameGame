Recently, I introduced a
bill
that does two important things: 1) it strategically cuts the legs out from under Obamacare and 2) it rolls back the massive overreach of the IRS. The Prevent IRS Overreach Act ( H.R. 683 ) accomplishes these goals by prohibiting the expansion of the IRS to implement Obamacare.
I will keep you posted on the bill's progress.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. What are your thoughts on this strategy for defeating Obamacare and reining in the IRS at the same time? Weigh in with your thoughts on my blog,
