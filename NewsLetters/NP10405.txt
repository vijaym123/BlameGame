Best of luck to these fine young Cadets who are currently in training to become Ports Police Officers.
Invited to show support for the Sexual Assault Awareness Month, these Cadets and I joined the Northern Marianas Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic Violence in their series of village walks spreading awareness and working to end violence in our communities.
Your Voice. Our Future. End Sexual Violence.
$223,188 specialty crop block grant available for the Northern Marianas
The Northern Marianas has been allocated $223,188 under the USDA Specialty Crop Block Grant Program
(SCBG) to help contribute to food safety improvements, increased access to healthy food, and new research to help growers increase profitability and sustainability. Specialty crops include locally grown nuts, fruits and vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, horticulture and nursery crops, including floriculture. The Agricultural Act of 2014 or the farm bill, passed by Congress earlier this year, now allocates the funding for this program to States and territories based on a formula that factors in the specialty crop acreage planted and the estimated value of production but not less than $100,000 for each jurisdiction. The SCBG program is authorized until 2018. The Northern Marianas DLNR is eligible to apply directly to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for grant funds.

Former Honolulu Mayor Mufi Hanneman and the Pacific Century Fellows Program, Marianas Chapter, invited me to speak at their second leadership series that focused on government.
The fellowship includes a chat with the living negotiators of the covenant, meeting with the executive branch, the legislature and the judiciary.
For my part, I shared some insights about how their congressional office works both in Washington and here at home.
Thank you, Mayor Hanneman and Pacific Century Fellows for your kind invitation.
$45,000 awarded for NMI WIC breastfeeding program
The USDA Food and Nutrition Service has announced the release of funds for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infant and Children (WIC) breastfeeding program to WIC state agencies. The Northern Marianas WIC program will receive $45,000 from these funds. The grant will continue to support the administration and implementation of the peer counseling program that addresses barriers to breastfeeding that low income mothers face. Peer counselors are recruited and hired from WICs target population of low-income women and undergo training to provide mother-to-mother support in group settings and one-to-one counseling through visits in the home, clinic, or the hospital. The grant award will enable WIC program to build upon and expand their breastfeeding peer counseling implementation plans.
