Friends,
Thanks for subscribing to my e-newsletter.
It's the best way for me to
share important updates from Washington and at home in South Carolina.
Opportunity Agenda
I spoke this past week at the Heritage Foundation's Conservative
Policy Summit on the importance of school choice in creating
opportunity for kids and my CHOICE Act
.
It is my firm belief that those closest to the child are
in the best position to make decisions that will help them succeed-when
a parent has a choice, a kid the best chance.

Around South Carolina
Financial literacy is a crucial stepping stone towards economic
independence and success for our youth.
Last Saturday, I spoke at
MoneyRocks Youth Financial Literacy Summit in North Charleston to help
share these ideas with bright young South Carolinians.
Valentines Day Cheer
Every year for Valentines Day, one of my favorite traditions is to
visit the kids who are being treated at the Medical University of South
Carolina and talk with them and their parents.
While handing out
Valentines, I meet some amazing young people and hear stories of hope,
strength, and inspiration.
Happy Valentines Day to them, and to all
South Carolinians-I hope that it is a day filled with love and
compassion for one another.
I appreciate the opportunity to represent the great state of South
Carolina in the United States Senate, and hope that you and your
families have stayed safe and warm during this winter weather.
As
always, please do not hesitate to reach out to my office with questions
or suggestions--I appreciate hearing from you.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott
