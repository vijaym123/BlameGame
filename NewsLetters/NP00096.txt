CDOT Completes Phase 1 of US 36 Express Lanes
Left to right: Broomfield Mayor Randy Ahrens,
U.S. Transportation Deputy Secretary Victor Mendez, U.S.
Rep. Ed Perlmutter and Governor John Hickenlooper
I joined the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), Governor Hickenlooper and the many different stakeholders in celebrating the completion of Phase 1 of the US 36 Express Lanes Project. This marks the beginning of multi-modal choices on the newly reconstructed highway that will eventually connect Westminster to Boulder.
Colorado has long been ahead of the curve when it comes to transportation. We are a state of innovative thinkers who put that thinking into action. I couldn&rsquo;t be more proud to celebrate the completion of yet another model project for the state.
Phase 1 of US 36 is open to drivers, but toll collection is currently being waived while the lanes undergo a brief testing period until mid-July to ensure the tolling equipment and technology is working properly for all vehicles. Drivers are encouraged to get a pass before tolling commences by visiting
www.expresstoll.com . There, drivers can choose the pass that is right for them and their Express Lane usage. Bus riders can get information on passes at
www.rtd-denver.com .
