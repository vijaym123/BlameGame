David -- there&rsquo;s no time to lose, so I&rsquo;ll get straight to it:
Cheri Bustos needs your help, and she needs it now.
Why? Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s gearing up to launch a MASSIVE
$2,24O,OOO
negative ad blitz on the Illinois airwaves.
We don't have enough common sense, solutions focused women in Congress to begin with. We can't let Speaker Boehner try to kick her out for another Tea Party loyalist. David, we need to have Cheri&rsquo;s back -- now more than ever.
But as of 9:30 AM, her campaign&rsquo;s coming up $1,230 short on its critical budget goal.
Will you chip in a few dollars to help close the gap? If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Illinois&rsquo; hardworking families deserve a strong woman fighting for them in Congress, not a rubber stamp Republican. So I&rsquo;m asking:
Please, pitch in for Cheri today: http://action.cheribustos.com/Fight-Back
Let&rsquo;s do this!
Kirsten
