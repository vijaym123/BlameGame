Dear David,
I'm proud Missouri was home to one of America's gutsy, straight-talking, and most well-respected Presidents.
That's why I'm
working across the aisle
with my friend, fellow Missouri Senator Roy Blunt, to rename Washington, D.C.'s iconic Union Station the "Harry S. Truman Union Station." We introduced our bipartisan legislation last week on the 130th anniversary of President Truman's birth. And we believe it's only fitting the train station that's just a short walk from the Capitol, and that played such an important role in his presidency, bear his name.
In fact, Union Station was home to the Presidential rail car, U.S. Car No. 1, which was used extensively by President Truman during his time in the White House. When he left Washington, D.C., aboard the train car to embark on his famous "whistle-stop campaign" tour, his journey began and ended at Union Station.
The day after his reelection, Truman returned to Washington, D.C., via Union Station. As he made his way from Union Station to the White House, more than 750,000 people welcomed him back to the city. And following the inauguration of President Eisenhower in 1953, Truman departed from Union Station by train one last time with his wife, Bess. More than 5,000 people squeezed on the platform to see them off.
Senator Blunt and I plan to work on a bipartisan basis to ensure this legislation is passed - and I'm thrilled that our colleagues in the U.S. House, including all of Missouri's House members and the District of Columbia's Delegate to Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton, have introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House to advance this goal.
President Truman holds a significant place in American history, and it's important we continue to work to ensure his legacy lives on for future generations of Missourians, and the entire nation.
All the best,
P.S. I want to hear your thoughts about how we can carry on Truman's legacy. Send me a message via
