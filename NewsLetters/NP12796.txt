Dear friend,
This coming Tuesday, February
4th at 6:00 p.m. Ill be hosting my first telephone town hall of
2014. These kinds of forums are a great opportunity to connect with people
across New Hampshire and discuss important issues from jobs and the
environment to health care and foreign policy. I hope youll join me to
share your thoughts on how to address the challenges facing our
nation. Sign up at
http://www.shaheen.senate.gov/teletownhall/
by 6:00 p.m. on February 3rd to join the
discussion.
I look forward to speaking with
you.
Sincerely,
Jeanne
Shaheen
