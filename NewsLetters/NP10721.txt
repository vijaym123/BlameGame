Roll Call
Restoring Unemployment
Insurance &amp; Bipartisanship
By Senators Dean Heller and Jack
Reed
April 8, 2014
Millions of Americans are struggling to
find work, and this week, the United States
Senate finally voted 59-38 to pass a
bipartisan bill to provide them some
targeted, temporary relief.
We come from different states and
different parties, but we agree that
temporarily restoring emergency
unemployment insurance for the long-term
unemployed is the right thing to do and
this is the critical moment to get it
done.
The bipartisan bill we crafted is a
fiscally responsible compromise that will
assist our neighbors in need, improve both
our short-term and long-term national
economic health, and make important reforms
to the program.
It has now been over 100 days since the
federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation
program was allowed to expire, leaving
millions of job-seeking Americans in the
lurch.
Although the latest jobs report shows
the U.S. economy added 192,000 jobs in
March, the national unemployment rate
remains unchanged at 6.7 percent, and this
remains a particularly difficult economy
for the long-term unemployed. Indeed, the
number of long-term unemployed Americans
today is nearly twice as high as it has
ever been when Congress cut off emergency
unemployment insurance.
The Reed-Heller bill provides five
months of targeted relief, and is
retroactive to ensure that job seekers
whove been unfairly cut off are made
whole. This bill is the product of months
of negotiations, and is truly a compromise
solution that includes input from many
members of Congress.
We both agree that the ultimate solution
is a growing economy and more jobs.
Congress should take more bipartisan
actions to get our country back to full
employment
to a place where all
Americans have an opportunity to earn a
living and build a better life for their
families.
But in the meantime, we must not turn
our backs on those who are desperately
looking for a job but just have not yet
secured one.
Unemployment insurance provides
effective relief to those hit hardest by
the recession, and plays an important role
in sustaining our local communities.
This federal assistance helps everyone
not just the jobless
because it prevents people from being
evicted or foreclosed on, which can hurt
property values and neighborhoods. It helps
people keep their phones on so when an
employer calls them back for an interview
they can answer the call, and allows
individuals to access goods and services
from mom and pop businesses like grocery
stores, gas stations and pharmacies.
The bill also builds on significant
changes to the unemployment insurance laws
that were passed in 2012. The Reed-Heller
agreement also includes language to
strengthen reemployment and eligibility
assessment and ReEmployment Services
programs. In an effort to help get job
seekers back into the workforce,
individuals receiving emergency
unemployment compensation will be eligible
for enhanced, personalized assessments and
referrals to re-employment services when
they begin their 27th week of UI (Tier I)
and 55th week of UI (Tier III). It also
ends emergency unemployment insurance
payments to any individual whose adjusted
gross income in the preceding year was $1
million or more.
Our bill is fully paid for. But the cost
of inaction is severe, as more unemployed
people will be forced to turn to shelters,
food pantries, or other social services
they never dreamed theyd need.
Compromise isnt always easy. Some
of our colleagues have raised questions
about how state workforce agencies might
administer retroactive benefits and enforce
new requirements provided in this bill.
These are reasonable concerns, but we
firmly believe that these challenges can be
overcome. Indeed, in a recent letter
addressing these very concerns, U.S.
Department of Labor Secretary Thomas Perez,
a former state labor secretary for Maryland
with hands-on experience with unemployment
insurance, indicated that these challenges
are not insurmountable and his agency
stands ready to assist.
Weve got our work cut out for us,
but restoring unemployment insurance is a
smart step that will also provide more
stability and predictability for businesses
as well.
We both served in the U.S. House of
Representatives and understand the House
has its own priorities. But we hope the
House leadership will quickly take up this
bill and we stand ready to work with them
in a bipartisan fashion to get this
done.
