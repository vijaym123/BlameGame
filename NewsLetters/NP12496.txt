Friends,
A major report released last week confirmed what many have said all
along- ObamaCare has serious negative consequences for the economy. A
report from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released
on Tuesday said the healthcare law could lead 2.3 million people to
work less or not at all. The head of the CBO testified before Congress
that ObamaCare creates a "disincentive for people to work."
There was plenty of troubling information contained in the CBO report,
but I could hardly believe how the White House, in defending the
President's signature law, acted as if it's a good thing that more than
2 million people would choose to work less or not at all because of
taxpayer-subsidized healthcare. Policies that encourage people to work
less and depend on government more send a dangerous message. That's not
the America we grew up in.
I want to grow our economy and build an America that works. I believe
in helping Americans achieve more, not in convincing them to do less.
That's why conservatives will continue to point out the flaws of
ObamaCare, but also get more specific in presenting our cost saving
alternative: a patient-centered healthcare system that isn't run by the
government.
Out of Excuses on Keystone
President Obama has now waited more than 1,950 days to approve the
Keystone XL Pipeline
, a private sector energy project
that, by most estimates, would create over 20,000 direct jobs. Since
the project crosses the Canadian border, the Obama Administration must
grant a permit before the project can begin.
Last week, the State Department released a long awaited impact study
that found the Keystone XL project would not have a significant impact
on the environment or worsen carbon
pollution. Despite these findings, President Obama continues to stand
in the way.
Even some of President Obama's most loyal supporters admit his delay
has nothing to do with policy or science. This past weekend, former
Obama Secretary of Energy Steven Chu said "the decision to approve the
Keystone XL oil pipeline is a political one
, and not one founded in science."
That stands to reason, especially considering President Obama said in
2008
that, under his plan, "electricity rates would
necessarily skyrocket," and that new regulations would "bankrupt" coal
producers.
American families experience the pain of high energy costs every time
they fill up the tank or pay the power bill. At a time when energy
costs are high and job creation low, now is the time to build this
pipeline as part of an "all-of-the-above" energy approach. In addition
to lowering costs and creating jobs, approving the Keystone Pipeline
would also be a key step towards decreasing American reliance on
foreign sources of energy.
The SHARE Act
Our Constitution guarantees us the fundamental right to keep and bear
arms, a right I strongly value as a Member of Congress and a gun owner
myself. Last week, the House passed the Sportsmen's Heritage and
Recreational Enhancement Act (SHARE)
by a
vote of 268 to 154. The bill helps protect the traditional rights of
American sportsmen to fish and hunt while removing roadblocks that
prohibit hunting on federally-owned land. The bill also protects an
individual's right to bear arms on land owned by the Army Corps of
Engineers. Additionally, the SHARE Act prohibits the Environmental
Protection Agency from banning the use of lead in hunting and fishing
components.
Like many Alabamians, our family enjoys hunting, fishing, and enjoying
the beauty of the outdoors together. Washington has no business
enacting regulations that prevent Americans from enjoying our favorite
pastimes on public lands.
The Week Ahead
Early next week, we expect to release our interim report on the
Department of Defense's response to the terrorist attack in Benghazi,
Libya. Make sure you are following me on Facebook
(facebook.com/RepresentativeMarthaRoby
) and Twitter (@RepMarthaRoby
) to be one of the first to know when the report is
released.
The House is also expected to consider bills relating to the ongoing
conflict in the Ukraine and reforms to the Consumer Financial
Protection Act. Specifically, the House is expected to vote on:
*	H.R. 2431
: The
National Integrated Drought Information Systems Reauthorization Act,
*	H.R. 3448
: Small Cap
Liquidity Reform Act of 2013,
*	H. Res. 447
: Supporting
the democratic and European aspirations of the people of Ukraine, and
*	H.R. 3193
: Consumer
Financial Protection and Soundness Improvement Act of 2013
I appreciate all of those who reached out to me last week on
immigration and other issues, and I hope that you will continue to stay
in contact with my office
. If there is ever anything I can do for you, do not
hesitate to let me know.

Friends,
A
major
report
released
last
week
confirmed
what
many
have
said
all
along&#8211;
ObamaCare
has
serious
negative
consequences
for
the
economy.
A
report
from
the
non-partisan
Congressional
Budget
Office
(CBO)
released
on
Tuesday
said
the
healthcare
law
could
lead
2.3
million
people
to
work
less
or
not
at
all.
The
head
of
the
CBO
testified
before
Congress
that
ObamaCare
creates
a
&#8220;disincentive
for
people
to
work.&#8221;
There
was
plenty
of
troubling
information
contained
in
the
CBO
report,
but
I
could
hardly
believe
how
the
White
House,
in
defending
the
President&#8217;s
signature
law,
acted
as
if
it&#8217;s
a
good
thing
that
more
than
2
million
people
would
choose
to
work
less
or
not
at
all
because
of
taxpayer-subsidized
healthcare.
Policies
that
encourage
people
to
work
less
and
depend
on
government
more
send
a
dangerous
message.
That&#8217;s
not
the
America
we
grew
up
in.
I
want
to
grow
our
economy
and
build
an
America
that
works.
I
believe
in
helping
Americans
achieve
more,
not
in
convincing
them
to
do
less.
That&#8217;s
why
conservatives
will
continue
to
point
out
the
flaws
of
ObamaCare,
but
also
get
more
specific
in
presenting
our
cost
saving
alternative:
a
patient-centered

that
isn&#8217;t

Out
of
Excuses
on
Keystone
President
Obama
has
now
waited
more
than
1,950
days
to
approve
the
Keystone
XL
Pipeline ,
a
private
sector
energy
project
that,
by
most
estimates,
would
create
over
20,000
direct
jobs.
Since
the
project
crosses
the
Canadian
border,
the
Obama
Administration
must
grant
a
permit
before
the
project
can
begin.
Last
week,
the
State
Department
released
a
long
awaited
impact
study
that
found
the
Keystone
XL
project
would
not
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
environment
or
worsen
carbon
pollution.
Despite
these
findings,
President
Obama
continues
to
stand
in
the
way.
Even
some
of
President
Obama&#8217;s
most
loyal
supporters
admit
his
delay
has
nothing
to
do
with
policy
or
science.
This
past
weekend,
former
Obama
Secretary
of
Energy
Steven
Chu
said
&#8220;the
decision
to
approve
the
Keystone
XL
oil
pipeline
is
a
political
one ,
and
not
one
founded
in
science.&#8221;
That
stands
to
reason,
especially
considering
President
Obama
said
in
2008
that,
under
his
plan,
&#8220;electricity
rates
would
necessarily
skyrocket,&#8221;
and
that
new
regulations
would
&#8220;bankrupt&#8221;
coal
producers.
American
families
experience
the
pain
of
high
energy
costs
every
time
they
fill
up
the
tank
or
pay
the
power
bill.
At
a
time
when
energy
costs
are
high
and
job
creation
low,
now
is
the
time
to
build
this
pipeline
as
part
of
an
&#8220;all-of-the-above&#8221;
energy
approach.
In
addition
to
lowering
costs
and
creating
jobs,
approving
the
Keystone
Pipeline
would
also
be
a
key
step
towards
decreasing
American
reliance
on
foreign
sources
of
energy.

Our
Constitution

us
the

bear

a
right
I
strongly

passed
the
Sportsmen&#8217;s

of
American
sportsmen
