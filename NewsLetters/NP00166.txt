Dear Friend,
As you may know, June is Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) Pride Month. This affords us the opportunity to celebrate the strides made to achieve equality for the LGBT community and to reaffirm our support to furthering their cause.
You can hear more about my commitment to fighting for their full equality in my video greeting below.
