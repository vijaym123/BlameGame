Dear Friends,
Brrr, the past few days have
been cold here in Delaware!
These bone-chilling
temperaturesare expected
to continue over the next
several weeks, which is why I
thought it would be important
to remind everyone to take
proper precautions against this
winter weather with a few
helpful tips:
Protect yourself from
freezing
temperatures:
be
aware of both the temperature
and wind chill when planning
outdoor activities. When you
prepare to go outside in
severe cold weather, please
remember to wear a hat, dress
in layers, and acknowledge
the warning signs and
symptoms for hypothermia and
frostbite.
Heat Your Home
Safely:
use caution
with portable heaters and
always operate portable
generators outdoors.
Prevent Frozen
Pipes:
now is the
time to protect your house
pipes from freezing and
bursting. Keep garage doors
closed if there are water
supply lines in the garage,
leave heat on in your home if
going away during cold
weather, and keep the
thermostat set to the same
temperature during the day
and night.
To learn more about how to
protect yourself in this cold
weather, visit the websites of
the
American
Red Cross
and the
Federal
Emergency Management Agency

Stay warm,
