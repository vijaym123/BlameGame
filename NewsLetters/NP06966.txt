Click here to protect Social Security from devastating changes &gt;&gt;
For 79 years, Social Security has guaranteed financial stability for retiring seniors. But now Republicans want to make changes to Social Security that would jeopardize its future. After a lifetime of hard work, our seniors shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about their economic future. If you agree, please add your name to demand Congress protect Social Security:
David --
Americans have counted on Social Security for almost eight decades.
It's founded on the promise that paying into it now means it will take care of you when you retire.
But Republicans in Congress want to break that promise and gut Social Security as we know it. David, we can&rsquo;t let that happen.
Cheri strongly opposes any changes to Social Security that would leave the future of the system to chance. If you agree, we need you with us. Help ensure a strong future for Social Security by adding your name to our petition today &gt;&gt;
