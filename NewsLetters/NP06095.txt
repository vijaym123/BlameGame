Dear Friends,
The Islamic State is continuing its atrocities, most recently with its
destruction
of the Armenian Genocide Memorial Church in the Syrian town of Der Zor. The attack, whose results are shown above, was a typical act of Islamic State barbarism, this time aimed at a Christian
minority group that has long suffered oppression and even genocide in the region. For my take on fighting the Islamic State and other terror groups, listen to my recent interview with Chris Daniel
