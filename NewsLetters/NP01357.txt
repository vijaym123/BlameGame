Dear David Doherty:
I will continue to meet one-on-one with constituents during mobile district office hours in Pittsburg,
Saturday, April 25th from 11 am to 1 pm . Mobile District Office Hours are one part of my efforts to be accessible to constituents. I am also holding town hall meetings and listening tours across the district.
People are busy and I want them to have easy and direct access to the information and assistance they need. That&rsquo;s why, in addition to two district offices, I have instituted a plan to host mobile district office hours at locations all across Contra Costa County during my first two years in office.
I will be available to share thoughts and to answer questions on federal legislation, and to assist with issues related to Social Security, the Veteran&rsquo;s Administration, passports, or other federal agencies.
&bull;
What : Congressman DeSaulnier&rsquo;s Mobile District Office Hours &bull;
When : Saturday, April 25th, from 11 AM to 1 PM &bull;
Where : Pittsburg City Hall, 65 Civic Avenue, Pittsburg, CA 94565. Check in at the main lobby.
No appointment necessary . &bull;
For More Information : Please email CA11.RSVP@mail.house.gov or call (925) 933-2660.
Very truly yours,
Mark DeSaulnier
Member of Congress
