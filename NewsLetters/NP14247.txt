Dear Friend,
On this Veterans Day, please join me in reflecting upon the sacrifices
that have been made by our nation's veterans - generations of men and
women who have stood together to defend our freedom and the principles
for which our country stands.
We owe much to our men and women in uniform - and to the families that
have supported them. President Reagan said of our veterans, "they are
what we can only aspire to be: giving, unselfish, the epitome of human
love - to lay down one's life so that others might live." As we mark
our gratitude on Veterans Day, may we be reminded of their sacrifices
and know how blessed we are that so many have answered the call to duty
- around the globe and at home.
To those veterans who have returned home and those have been lost, we
owe our deepest gratitude. May we remember these men and women and what
they have given to all of us - not just today on Veterans Day - but
every day.
Sincerely,
George Holding

Friend,
On
this
Veterans
Day,
please
join
me
in
reflecting
upon
the
sacrifices
that
have
been
made
by
our
nation's
veterans
-
generations
of
men
and
women
who
have
stood
together
to
defend
our
freedom
and
the
principles
for
which
our
country
stands.
We
owe
much
to
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
-
and
to
the
families
that
have
supported
them.
President
Reagan
said
of
our
veterans,
"they
are
what

be:
giving,
unselfish,
the
epitome
of

As
we

our

may
we
be
reminded
of
their
sacrifices
and
know
how
blessed
we
are
that

To
those
veterans
who
have

lost,
we
owe
our
deepest
gratitude.
May
we
remember
these
men
and
women
and
what
they
have
given
to
all
of
us
-
not
just
today
on
Veterans
