Dear
Friend,
This year,
Veterans Day comes on the heels of a very special event at the White
House honoring the memory and legacy of one of Wisconsins and Americas
greatest war heroes, First Lt. Alonzo Cushing. After decades of hard
work done by elected officials and local advocates, this Delafield
native has finally gotten his Medal of Honor.
On July 3, 1863,
the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg, Lt. Cushing and the 110
men under his command received the full force of Confederate artillery
and Picketts Charge of 13,000 infantry. In just a few hours, all of
his officers had been killed and Cushing himself was badly injured. But
he continued to fight, and sustained two more wounds before dying on
the field of battle.
His actions demonstrated an
astonishing level of courage that needed to be recognized by the nation he
helped save. But making it possible to award Lt. Cushing took a lot of
persistence and bipartisan cooperation.
Late this summer, a
bill I authored to make awarding the Medal possible was passed by
Congress. Along with my colleague Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI), I sent a
letter to Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel requesting his prompt
attention to Lt. Cushings record. The decision was made, and the Medal was
just presented to one of Lt. Cushings relatives in a special White
House Ceremony.
The key to our success has been Margaret
Zerwekh, who lives on the same Delafield property once owned by the
Cushing family. For decades, she has been a tireless citizen advocate for
recognition of Lt. Cushing, who lobbied Congress (starting with my
old boss Senator William Proxmire), the White House and the military for
posthumous recognition of Cushings heroism. It was an honor to have
her join us at the White House.
Its never too late to do
the right thing, and its an honor to be a part of Lt. Alonzo
Cushings story. Today, we thank all of our veterans, from past to
present.
