Dear Friend,
Article I, Section 1
of the United States Constitution isn't hard to
understand:
All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a
Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and a
House of Representatives .
Congress makes the laws in
this country, plain and simple.
It's high time the president
enforce the law instead of his own political preferences.
That's why I co-sponsored and
the House passed two bills this week aimed at reining in executive
overreach and restoring the lawmaking authority of
Congress.
I hear all the time from people who want to know how and why
things are happening in Washington the way that they are--why President
Obama feels his pen and his phone are all he needs to govern as he
sees fit.
The bills we passed this week aren't just about
President Obama, however.
They're about any president now or in the
future who thinks this sort of executive action is
appropriate.
I hope you'll
read
about
the ENFORCE the Law Act and the Faithful Execution of the
Law Act, and as always,
tell
me what you think .
Sincerely,
Doug
Collins
Member of Congress
We deserve answers from the
IRS
Congressman Collins
spoke on the House Floor this week about the continued obstruction of the
investigation into the IRS and its political targeting
pracitices.
