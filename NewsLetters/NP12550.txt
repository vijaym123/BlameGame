Dear Friends,
With the enrollment period for the new healthcare marketplace (here in California known as Covered California) coming to a close, it's important that you as constituents of the 14th Congressional District have all of the information you need to enroll before the March 31st deadline. This is the absolute last day to enroll into the exchange until the next open enrollment season later in the year.
Everyone has a different set of circumstances and those circumstances will affect your insurance options during this important shift in our healthcare system. As a result, we've ended up in a situation where many people have specific questions without enough Covered CA representatives to answer them. I've heard from many of you that the Covered CA phone lines have been tied-up and that you still need important questions about enrollment to be addressed.
It's also important to remember that, in order for the Affordable Care Act to work, we need young healthy people to contribute to the insurance pool. Though we've seen a significant number of individuals in California under the age of 30 enroll into the exchanges, there are still a great number of those who are uninsured, but have yet to enroll.
To help address these challenges, I'm happy to announce that I will be holding another healthcare enrollment assistance event on Friday, February 7th, 2014 at San Francisco State University for students and members of the community at large.
At the event, there will be repeating Covered CA workshops, one-on-one assistance with Covered CA representatives, and FREE preventative health screenings. There will also be a number of insurance companies and health organizations present with detailed information on services they may be able to provide to you.
