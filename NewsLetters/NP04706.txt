Dear David,
We&rsquo;re looking at a catastrophe if things go wrong in 48 hours. 32 races are in statistical dead heats. The Republicans know it too, and according to Politico, they&rsquo;ve recently bought &ldquo;millions of dollars of TV advertising time&rdquo; in districts we won in 2012.
This is the kind of late-breaking attack ad blitz that could prove decisive. We can&rsquo;t back down now -- give $5 and help us fight back before tonight&rsquo;s deadline at midnight. All Donations to this Email Triple-Matched Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
If they can run the table, Republicans and their special interest backers will have bought the largest GOP majority in the House since Herbert Hoover was in the White House.
I need you in this fight, and I need you now. There are only 48 hours until the election --
please give $5 to help us avoid a disaster.
Thank you.
Nancy
