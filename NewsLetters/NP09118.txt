&ldquo;The projected [$125 million] budget for [the Koch brothers&rsquo;] Americans for Prosperity would be unprecedented for a private political group in a midterm, and would likely rival even the spending of the Republican and Democratic parties&rsquo; congressional campaign arms.&rdquo;
- Politico , 5/9/14
Dear Friend,
Nobody spends $125 million on something without expecting a return on their investment -- and the Koch brothers are not dumb investors.
I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of elections. I have
never
seen an outside group so proudly proclaim its attempt to buy the Senate.
Our grassroots network is our best defense against the Koch brothers&rsquo; money avalanche. Ed depends on people like you to keep his campaign going --
can you pitch in $5 to help us reach our $20,000 goal for May?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
The worst part of the Koch brothers&rsquo; spending spree is that we don&rsquo;t know where it&rsquo;s going yet. All we know is that it&rsquo;s coming -- we&rsquo;re just waiting for the other shoe to drop.
In the meantime, though, we can give Ed the resources he needs to respond to any attacks.
Make a $5 contribution and help Ed stay strong.
Thank you.
David
