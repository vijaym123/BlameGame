Obamacare
>From the Mailbag: Your experiences with Healthcare.gov
Thank you to those who responded to my request for your experiences
thus far with Obamacare. Here's a sampling of what we heard from 3rd
District residents:
"I remember the President clearly saying if I like my insurance, I
could keep it. I recently talked to the insurance broker, who helped us
get our policy, and he said because of the ACA (Obamacare) our old
policy will have to be discontinued at the end of 2014 and we'll be
forced to buy a new one that complies with ACA regulations."

Jeremy from Pleasant Grove
"I see the benefit and the purpose of the ACA but I feel like the
execution and reality of the act leave much to be desired." - Holly
from Orem
"I am 63 and paying 1,200.00 per month from my group plan. My new quote
is less by 210.00 by going to Avenue H." - Craig from SLC
Entering Obamacare Exchanges
I dislike Obamacare. I am unhappy with its implementation. I am even
losing my own coverage. However, I feel that I have no choice but to
comply with the letter and spirit of the law by enrolling myself and my
staff in Obamacare.

Is the White House stonewalling the Oversight Committee?
Contractors tell the Oversight Committee that Healthcare.gov decisions
were driven by the White House. Will the White House produce the
documents that confirm or refute those claims?

Latest News on the Benghazi Investigation
60 Minutes
Recently 60 min. interviewed a British security officer who was on the
ground in Benghazi during the Sept. 11, 2012 attack. Watch the
explosive story below.
In response to this story the officers real name was leaked to the
Washington Post. I'm horrified
. Even Chris Matthews
wants answers.
Benghazi Press Conference
Congressmen Trey Gowdy (R-SC), Jim Jordan (R-OH), and myself, along
with U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) and John
McCain (R-AZ), held a press conference addressing the latest issues
surrounding the Benghazi investigation and demanded that the Benghazi
survivors be made available to testify before Congress.

DHS Internal Doc Reveals Plans to Lift Longstanding Libyan Ban
The House Judiciary Committee obtained an internal Department of
Homeland Security draft final regulation prepared by the Obama
Administration that would lift the longstanding prohibition on Libyans
to come to the U.S. to work in aviation maintenance, flight operations,
or to seek study or training in nuclear science.
This is very concerning. Read here
for more information.
More questions about Obama Administration abuse of data gathering
Dick Cheney is right - our friends don't trust us and our enemies don't
fear us.
With the latest Snowden revelations on American efforts to
spy on our allies, I told Andrea Mitchell I am concerned about both
international and domestic data gathering.
This administration has
engaged in spying on our allies, collecting phone data on US citizens,
and now they expect us to enter our social security numbers into a
website that doesn't even bother to encrypt our data?
