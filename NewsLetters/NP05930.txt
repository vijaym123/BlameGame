Dear
Friend,
Last week I told you about
legislation I've
offered
to
stop the
threat
of the Islamic State. I also told you that in the midst of
meeting this challenge, the House had still been hard at work trying
to meet your priorities.
There are now 387 bills passed by
the House awaiting Senate action--Senate action of any kind. One of
those is now
H.R. 2, the
American Energy Solutions for Lower Costs and More American Jobs
Act . The cost of American energy doesn't just affect what you pay at
the pump, but it's tied to more than 150,000 jobs in this country.
It's a logical place for job creation, and the House action to spur that
industry deserves Senate attention as soon as possible.
The
House also passed an economic growth package aimed at alleviating the
pressure of regulations on smaller businesses.
One piece of
that package was
my
legislation
to keep the federal government accountable and open about
the ways some regulations are enacted. The House Majority Leader has
a great write-up about how these bills work
here .
It's my hope that
we'll see the Senate act soon. As always, you can
let me know
your views on this or any
other issue.
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of
Congress
