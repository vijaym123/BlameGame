News from Representative Richard Nugent
Dear Friends,
Just a quick couple updates from this week.
First, the House has
officially begun the appropriations season.
We started with two bills.
One, the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill sets the funding levels
for Congress - the House, Senate, Library of Congress, Government
Accountability Office, and some other smaller ancillary line items.
I
offered an amendment to that bill that, unfortunately, ended up being
blocked in the House.
In short, my amendment would have ended the practice of members of
Congress being able to lease vehicles with their official office funds.
Over the years, there have been a number of cases where members of the
House have leased luxury vehicles like Lexuses and Cadillacs.
As a
taxpayer, I was pretty offended at that.
With everything this country
has been through and with everything we are asking federal agencies to
do to tighten their belts, I just think it sends the wrong message.
The sad thing is that there are some members who have legitimate reason
to lease a vehicle for official use and they have bent over backwards
to make sure the costs were absolutely minimal.
The program has just
been so thoroughly abused that it's hard to justify continuing it.
At
least in my opinion.
In any case, my amendment got voted down this time (196-221).
But it
was close and I will definitely continue to push this issue.
Ending
the program may not save much, but I think the principle is important.
The other appropriations bill we considered this week was the Military
Construction and Veterans Administration bill, which funds the VA and
various construction projects (as the title suggests).
Last year's bill actually had more direct, local relevance for us.
In
the bill we passed a year ago, we appropriated funds for a "State Home
Grant" account that ended up providing a potential $23 million for a
120-bed veterans nursing home in Marion County.
The VA in Washington
had put the project down as a "priority one", which basically
guarantees its approval at the federal level.
The only catch was that
in order for the county to get the money, the state of Florida had to
agree to provide matching funds.
It remains to be seen whether the state will follow through or whether
they will elect to direct the money to a different county.
At this
point, it's largely out of my hands.
I've pushed the Florida
Department of Veterans Affairs and the Governor's Office to go with
Marion.
But absent a congressional earmark, which we've banned in the
House, I unfortunately don't have a legislative mechanism to ensure
that the money ends up in our area (as intended at the federal level).
The resources are there, it's just a question of getting at it from the
state end.
That's about it for now.
Much more to report next week.
In the
meantime, have a great weekend and please let me know if there is
anything I can do.
Sincerely,
Rich Nugent
Member of Congress

Dear
Friends,
[if gte mso 10]>
<![endif]
Just
a
quick
couple
updates
from
this
week.
First,
the
House
has
officially
begun
the
appropriations
season.
We
started
with
two
bills.
One,
the
Legislative
Branch
Appropriations
bill
sets
the
funding
levels
for
Congress
&#8211;
the
House,
Senate,
Library
of
Congress,
Government
Accountability
Office,
and
some
other
smaller
ancillary
line
items.
I
offered
an
amendment
to
that
bill
that,
unfortunately,
ended
up
being
blocked
in
the
House.
In
short,
my
amendment
would
have
ended
the
practice
of
members
of
Congress
being
able
to
lease
vehicles
with
their
official
office
funds.
Over
the
years,
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
where
members
of
the
House
have
leased
luxury
vehicles
like
Lexuses
and
Cadillacs.
As
a
taxpayer,
I
was
pretty
offended
at
that.
With
everything
this
country
has
been
through
and
with
everything
we
are
asking
federal
agencies
to
do
to
tighten
their
belts,
I
just
think
it
sends
the
wrong
message.
The
sad
thing
is
that
there
are
some
members
who
have
legitimate
reason
to
lease
a
vehicle
for
official
use
and
they
have
bent
over
backwards
to
make
sure
the
costs
were
absolutely
minimal.
The
program
has
just
been
so
thoroughly
abused
that
it&#8217;s
hard
to
justify
continuing
it.
At
least
in
my
opinion.
In
any
case,
my
amendment
got
voted
down
this
time
(196-221).
But
it
was
close
and
I
will
definitely
continue
to
push
this
issue.
Ending
the
program
may
not
save
much,
but
I
think
the
principle
is
important.
The
other
appropriations
bill
we
considered
this
week
was
the
Military
Construction
and
Veterans
Administration
bill,
which
funds
the
VA
and
various
construction
projects
(as
the
title
suggests).
Last
year&#8217;s
bill
actually
had
more
direct,
local
relevance
for
us.
In
the
bill
we
passed
a
year
ago,
we
appropriated
funds
for
a
&#8220;State
Home
Grant&#8221;
account
that
ended
up
providing
a
potential
$23
million
for
a
120-bed
veterans
nursing
home
in
Marion
County.
The
VA
in
Washington
had
put
the
project
down
as
a
&#8220;priority
one&#8221;,
which
basically
guarantees
its
approval
at
the
federal
level.
The
only
catch
was
that
in
order
for
the
county
to
get
the
money,
the
state
of
Florida
had
to
agree
to
provide
matching
funds.
It
remains
to
be
seen
whether
the
state
will
follow
through
or
whether
they
will
elect
to
direct
the
money
to
a
different
county.
At
this
point,
it&#8217;s
largely
out
of
my
hands.
I&#8217;ve
pushed
the
Florida
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
and
the
Governor&#8217;s
Office
to
go
with
Marion.
But
absent
a
congressional
earmark,
which
we&#8217;ve
banned
in
the
House,
I
unfortunately
don&#8217;t
have
a
legislative
mechanism
to
ensure
that
the
money
ends
up
in
our
area
(as
intended
at
the
federal
level).
The
resources
are
there,
it&#8217;s
just
a
question
of
getting
at
it
from
the
state
end.
That&#8217;s
about
it
for
now.
Much
more
to
report
next
week.
In
the
meantime,
have
a
great
weekend
and
please
let
me
know
if
there
is
anything
I
can
do.

Nugent Member
