Join me DFW &amp; Let's Move in May!
Dear Friends,
Designating the month of May as Health and Fitness Month is more than just a yearly pledge for me. Due to my desire to make health and fitness a priority for Americans everywhere, I urge you to join me at the following FREE and family friendly events in the DFW Metroplex.
Tomorrow, May 16, 2015, I will host
Community Fitness Day
from 9
11 a.m. at Tarrant County College South Campus track. This FREE and family friendly event, with special guests the Texas Rangers six-shooters and Universal Cheerleaders Association, will further our goal of increasing physical activity for Americans everywhere. The event will allow residents of the DFW Metroplex to participate in interactive, educational games, and learn about ways to promote healthy living.
In case of inclement weather tomorrow, please join me at Tarrant County College South Campus SHPE gymnasium.
On Saturday, May 30, 2015, please join me in making healthy living a priority as I discuss with Chef Brenda Johnson how to use cooking to support a healthier lifestyle. I will host a FREE
healthy cooking class
to demonstrate ways to create healthy and nutritious meal options. Lunch included!
Space is limited, RSVP is required.
I encourage you to join me in these events as we demonstrate the steps you can take right now that will make today healthier than yesterday and pave the way for healthy living tomorrow. To learn more about the May Health Events and other
events
I will host in the DFW Metroplex, sign up to receive my e-mails.
