Friends,
This week, families and
friends will gather around their tables to celebrate Thanksgiving. This
special holiday originated from the first harvest of the new world - a
time when the Pilgrims and Native Americans joined together in fellowship
to feast and give thanks to God.
Today, we too should reflect
on the many blessings we have been
given.
Its a tradition in my family to go around the
table and share one thing we are thankful for. Its always difficult
to just choose one.
Among many other blessings, Im grateful
for my wonderful and loving wife Renee, for my supportive family, for
the way God has richly blessed my life, and for the tremendous honor to
serve the Eighth District in the U.S. House of Representatives.
From the freedoms we enjoy as Americans, to the men and women who
fight to protect our country, we are truly
blessed.
As Americans, we would not be able to celebrate
the many blessings we hold dear without the sacrifice of our service
members and their families.
I want to give a special thanks to
our men and women in uniform and to our veterans for their service to
our country that makes the world a safer place.
As your
Representative, taking care of these heroes and their families is one of my
most sacred
responsibilities.
Standing up and fighting for our military community so they
receive the care and respect they deserve is the least we can do to
repay the countless sacrifices they make on our behalf.
Just
two weeks ago, I read an article in the
New York Post
about a
soldier, Spc. Brent Grommet, and his military dog, Matty, who were
wrongfully separated after returning from Afghanistan where they both
sustained injuries in the line of duty. Under
Robbys Law , Spc.
Grommet should have been able to adopt Matty, but they were separated
due to administrative mishaps.
When I first read the story, I
was heartbroken and determined to do all that I could to get Matty back
where he belonged
with Spc.
Grommet.

I was thrilled that after two days of looking into the
matter, I was able to track down Mattys whereabouts. The family who
had adopted Matty in good faith and had cared for him for almost a year
graciously offered to return him to his rightful owner and best
friend.
I spoke with Brent the day after he got Matty back and was
so touched to hear the details of their emotional reunion and how
excited Matty was to see him.
Brents father said Matty nearly
knocked Brent over while leaping into his arms because he was so excited
to be reunited with his best
friend.
I am truly honored to have played a role to help reunite
these two heroes. Moreover, I am deeply humbled and grateful for the
family that cared for Matty and selflessly returned him to our soldier.
From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank Brent, Matty and all
service members and their canine companions for serving our great
nation.
I hope you take
the time this Thanksgiving and holiday season to truly appreciate the
many things we have to be grateful for in this world.
Please
keep in your hearts those who have sacrificed and those who continue
to serve so that our country can remain prosperous and
free.
Until next week,
Richard Hudson
Member of Congress
(NC-08)
SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESS
SATURDAY
November 29,
2014
We hear a lot about Black Friday, but
Small Business Saturday may just be the most important shopping day of
the year. It matters more to our local economy and to our communities.
We cant have a strong economy unless our small businesses are doing
well.
Small Business Saturday is an
opportunity for shoppers to get a great deal while investing in our
local communities, growing our economy, and promoting the continued
livelihood of our great
nation.

Congress.
I'm excited to have the opportunity to serve on a
committee that is so important to North Carolina and the Eighth District.
Our state has the opportunity to unleash our own energy resources,
grow
our economy, and create good
jobs.
From my position on the Energy and Commerce Committee, I
will work to cut federal spending, replace Obamacare with a health care
system that puts patients first, and go after all sources of American
energy in order to lower costs for everyone and put people back to
work.
