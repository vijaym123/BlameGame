Veterans Job Training Initiative
I kicked off the week with my Veterans Job and Resource Fair
. It was a success! More than 110
Employers from across South Carolina attended the fair.
Hundreds of veterans and their families came out to the North
Charleston Convention Center to apply for jobs and learn more about
employment opportunities for veterans and active military members.
To continue my Veterans Job Training Initiative, I will hold another
veterans job workshop in Anderson on Monday, March 16th. This will
workshop focus on Education and Entrepreneurship, and is in partnership
with Tri-County Technical College. The second workshop will be held in
Greenville on Thursday, March 19th. Attendees are encouraged to bring
copies of their current resume or a list of work experiences. For more
information, those interested can call Senator Scott's Upstate office
at (864) 233-5366.
Iran Letter
46 of my colleagues and I signed Senator Tom Cotton's letter to the
Leaders of Iran this week. I strongly believe that the American people
deserve a voice in any final agreement with Iran, especially about an
issue as important as nuclear weapons.
Selma 50th Anniversary March
Last Saturday, I marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge with my
colleagues for the 50th anniversary of 'Bloody Sunday' in Selma,
Alabama. It was an honor to participate in the remembrance ceremonies
as Senate Co-Chairman of Faith and Politics Institute's Civil Rights
Pilgrimage. I was alongside Civil Rights icon Rep. John Lewis and House
republican Leader Kevin McCarthy.
Amazing day and great experience!
