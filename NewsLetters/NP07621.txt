A Vision for America's Energy Future
Dear Friend:
Today the United States is emerging as the worlds leading energy superpower
eclipsing Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the largest producing nation of both natural gas and oil. We are no longer beholden to adverse exporters overseas and now have the resources to control our own energy destiny.
But despite these dramatic changes in our energy landscape, our energy policy still looks very similar to the one the Carter administration prescribed. The laws and regulations currently on the books are still rooted in an era of scarcity and are holding back opportunities to capitalize on our newfound energy abundance.
It is time for a different vision for American energy
one that seeks to harness the benefits of our energy abundance and better connect these new resources to the people who need them in a safe and responsible way. At my Energy and Commerce Committee we are taking on this task, and constructing what we call the Architecture of Abundance.
Building the Architecture of Abundance requires a whole range of tools to take full advantage of our energy resources
a broad array of policies that can be understood within five key policy goals, or pillars, for Americas energy future:
1) Modernizing and updating our nations transmission and distribution infrastructure to keep pace with our growing energy supplies;
2) Maintaining a diverse electricity portfolio;
3) Permitting a new manufacturing renaissance;
4) Harnessing new energy innovation and efficiency; and
5) Unleashing a new era of energy diplomacy.
Constructing these five pillars will allow us to make the most of our energy resources, and fully realize our potential to be an American energy superpower. Our energy sector is already a bright spot in our economy, supporting millions of jobs and spurring economic activity across the country. But as my old boss President Reagan used to say, You ain't seen nothing yet.
With the right policies in place, the benefits of our energy abundance can grow tenfold. That means even more jobs and investment, cheaper energy for manufacturers and the middle class, and increased domestic and global energy security.
