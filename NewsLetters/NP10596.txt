Congressional Report -- Week of April 14-18: $2.5 Million
Recovered for Texans
Hello Friend,
I spent the week traveling 23rd District of Texas visiting with
constituents in El Paso, Crane, Culberson, Winkler, Ward, Upton,
Brewster and Jeff Davis Counties. During this district work period, I
will also spend time in Bexar, Val Verde and Maverick Counties.

$2.5 Million Recovered for 23rd District of Texas' Constituents
Our office has recovered over $2.5 million for constituents of 23rd
District of Texas from various federal agencies. We reached this
landmark achievement one month ahead of goal. On a daily basis, staff
and I work to recover federal funds owed to constituents by
communicating and working closely with federal agencies and departments.
My top priority is helping people - that's what's most rewarding to me -
seeing lives improve immediately through the work we do. I encourage
constituents of 23rd District of Texas who need help with a federal
agency or department to contact our offices. Staff can help
constituents with any federal agency, including the U.S. Department of
Veterans Affairs, Internal Revenue Service, Social Security
Administration, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S.
Citizenship and Immigration Services, among others.
To contact a caseworker, visit www.gallego.house.gov. You can also
contact a caseworker by visiting district offices or calling the
telephone numbers below. Our offices are open from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30
p.m. (local times), Monday through Friday.
Getting Answers for Texans
In a House Agriculture Committee hearing on April 3, I asked Secretary
of Agriculture Tom Vilsack questions about the shutdown of a U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) inspection station. The inspection
station, which was closed in mid-August 2012, is located in Ojinaga,
Mexico, across from Presidio, Texas. Inspection stations are critical
to moving cattle from Mexico across the Southwest.
The only consistent thing about the USDA's answers has been their
inconsistency - they have yet to provide solid reasoning for shutting
the inspection station down. Far West Texas has lost jobs and economic
opportunities due to this issue which hurts towns that depend on the
cattle business.
Government must be responsive to the people it serves regardless of
whether the area is a big city or a small town. We have an obligation
to foster a healthy economic climate and create an environment where
business people can prosper -- including farmers, ranchers and small
business owners throughout local communities.
I will continue to press the USDA for answers, and a process for
reopening the inspection station, because every taxpayer in Presidio -
and every taxpayer anywhere else in the country - deserves a clear,
consistent answer. To watch the questions I asked, and Secretary
Vilsack's response, click here

April is School Library Month
School Libraries across the country and in Texas play an invaluable
role in the education and development of our youth. Ever since I was a
kid, I loved reading. Libraries can help kids grow and gain new
perspectives about our great state of Texas, about our country and
about the world we live in.
Through the Library of Congress Book Surplus Program, I distribute
books on a wide range of genres to schools and libraries across 23rd
District of Texas. If you would like your library to receive some,
please contact staff at the telephone numbers below. To watch a short
video I recorded commemorating School Library Month, click here

Happy Easter
In several of the world's religions, this weekend is special and brings
much reflection. In Christianity, Sunday is Easter. Whatever religion
you practice or adhere to, take a moment to reflect on how fortunate we
are to be Americans. As we surround ourselves with family and friends,
we should take time to reflect on those special characteristics that
make us who we are as a nation.
I also ask that, as you enjoy these days and reflect on your own
blessings, please take the time to think of and say a prayer for those
of our sons and daughters serving in uniform throughout the world. Many
of them are not surrounded by their families this weekend, but by their
colleagues who have also stepped up to defend their nation overseas.
For my part, I'm blessed to be a husband and father - and to serve as
the voice of the 23rd District of Texas in the U.S. House of
Representatives. To each of you, thank you so much for this incredible
opportunity. All the best from my family to yours.
Again, if I can help with a federal agency or issues, please call on
any of our offices. The phone numbers and addresses are listed below.
I've never been a big fan of politics - helping people is my favorite
part of the job. Please put us to work for you.
Sincerely,
Pete P. Gallego

Getting
Answers
for
Texans
In
a
House
Agriculture
Committee
hearing
on
April
3,
I
asked
Secretary
of
Agriculture
Tom
Vilsack
questions
about
the
shutdown
of
a
U.S.
Department
of
Agriculture
(USDA)
inspection
station.
The
inspection
station,
which
was
closed
in
mid-August
2012,
is
located
in
Ojinaga,
Mexico,
across
from
Presidio,
Texas.
Inspection
stations
are
critical
to
moving
cattle
from
Mexico
across
the
Southwest.
The
only
consistent
thing
about
the
USDA's
answers
has
been
their
inconsistency
&#8211;
they
have
yet
to
provide
solid
reasoning
for
shutting
the
inspection
station
down.
Far
West
Texas
has
lost
jobs
and
economic
opportunities
due
to
this
issue
which
hurts
towns
that
depend
on
the
cattle
business.
Government
must
be
responsive
to
the
people
it
serves
regardless
of
whether
the
area
is
a
big
city
or
a
small
town.
We
have
an
obligation
to
foster
a
healthy
economic
climate
and
create
an
environment
where
business
people
can
prosper
--
including
farmers,
ranchers
and
small
business
owners
throughout
local
communities.
I
will
continue
to
press
the
USDA
for
answers,
and
a
process
for
reopening
the
inspection
station,
because
every
taxpayer
in
Presidio
-
and
every
taxpayer
anywhere
else
in
the
country
&#8211; deserves
a
clear,
consistent
answer.
