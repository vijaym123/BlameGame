Dear Friend,
I wanted to let you know in advance about a piece of legislation the
House will vote on this Friday.
The Health Exchange Security and Transparency Act is a bill that would
require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to notify
individuals within two business days of any security breach of the
health insurance exchanges, created under the health care law, that
endangers personal data or information.
News reports and congressional inquiries regarding the security of the
website have shown that not enough attention was paid to online
security and the threat of identity theft while building and testing
the federally-run health insurance exchange. For example, Congress has
learned that HHS did not perform a full "Security Control Assessment"
before the website went live in October. The website was so behind in
being constructed that officials ran out of time to perform the full
security assessment. In addition, the consumer data company Experian
has predicted increased information security breaches in the health
care sector in 2014, particularly because healthcare.gov was put
together too quickly and haphazardly.
As someone who has signed up for health insurance through one of the
exchanges, this does not provide much comfort at all. Identify theft is
no joking matter, and it's a threat that should be taken seriously.
That's exactly why I have raised concerns
about the security of the personal information that is
required when signing up through the exchanges. Passing the Health
Exchange Security and Transparency Act is one helpful step toward
ensuring people do not fall victim to this type of financially
destructive crime.
Sincerely,
Kay Granger
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
I
wanted
to
let
you
know
in
advance
about
a
piece
of
legislation
the
House
will
vote
on
this
Friday.
The
Health
Exchange
Security
and
Transparency
Act
is
a
bill
that
would
require
the
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
(HHS)
to
notify
individuals
within
two
business
days
of
any
security
breach
of
the
health
insurance
exchanges,
created
under
the
health
care
law,
that
endangers
personal
data
or
information.
News
reports
and
congressional inquiries
regarding the
security
of
the
website
have
shown
that
not enough
attention
was
paid
to
online
security
and
the
threat
of
identity
theft
while
building
and
testing
the
federally-run
health
insurance
exchange.
For
example,
Congress
has
learned
that
HHS
did
not
perform
a
full
&#8220;Security
Control
Assessment&#8221;
before
the
website
went
live
in
October.
The
website
was
so
behind
in
being
constructed
that
officials
ran
out
of
time
to
perform
the
full
security
assessment.
In
addition,
the
consumer
data
company
Experian
has
predicted
increased
information
security
breaches
in
the
health
care
sector
in
2014,
particularly
because
healthcare.gov
was
put
together
too
quickly
and
haphazardly.
As
someone
who
has
signed
up
for
health
insurance
through
one
of
the
exchanges,
this
does
not
provide
much
comfort
at
all.
Identify
theft
is
no
joking
matter,
and
it&#8217;s
a
threat
that
should
be
taken
seriously.
That&#8217;s
exactly
why
I
have
raised
concerns
about
the
security
of
the
personal
information
that
is
required
when
signing
up
through
the
exchanges.
Passing
the
Health
Exchange
Security
and
Transparency
Act
is
one
helpful
step
toward
ensuring
people
do
not
fall
victim
to
this
type
of
financially
destructive
crime.
