HIGHLIGHTS IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
Farewell, General Ben G. Blaz - I have extended the condolences of the people of the Northern Mariana Islands to the people of Guam on the passing of their former Delegate to Congress, General Ben Garrido Blaz. In a statement for the Congressional Record I recognized Blaz as a trail-blazer for all the Chamorros of the Mariana Islands, being the first of us ever to rise to the rank of general officer in the U.S. Armed Forces. Ben Blaz served from the 99th through the 102nd Congresses, often looking out for the interests of the people of the Northern Marianas, at a time when we were without congressional representation ourselves. I joined Guam Delegate Madeleine Z. Bordallo for a tribute and moment of silence in honor of the General. Our deepest sympathies go out to his family and to the people of Guam as they mourn the passing of General Ben Garrido Blaz.

Army SPC Ryan Kikku and his wife Eunice Ogumoro Kikku dropped by their congressional office while visiting our nation's capital this week. The couple lives in Tennessee, just across the border from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, where Ryan is stationed. They received a staff-guided tour of the U.S. Capitol. Thank you for your service, SPC Kikku, and for your support, Ms. Kikku. Please visit us again.
