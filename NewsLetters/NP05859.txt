Dear Friend,
In 33 days, voters in Massachusetts and across the country will go to the polls. The
New York Times
gives the Republicans a 63% chance of gaining the majority in the Senate, which means we have 33 days to build up our firewall and keep Massachusetts&rsquo; seat blue. To make the most of the time we have left, we need to raise $16O,OOO in October. Get us off to a strong start with a $5 contribution.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Republicans are banking on picking up the six seats they need to take over the Senate, and the conventional wisdom was that they&rsquo;d get those six seats easily. But the &ldquo;conventional wisdom&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t take you into account, friend.
We&rsquo;ve all recognized what happens when we sit on the sidelines. We&rsquo;re not going to stay home on Election Day. And with only 33 days left in this campaign,
we&rsquo;re not going to let up in our grassroots efforts. Our team needs to raise $16O,OOO to keep us going through election day. If you can, please consider giving $5 to help out.
Thanks for your continued support. Only 33 days left -- let&rsquo;s go win this thing.
Sincerely,
Ed
