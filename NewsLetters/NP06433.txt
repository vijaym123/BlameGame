Dear Friend,
Every year on September 11, our country wakes up with a heavy heart.
We relive our painful memories, and we come together to mourn the thousands of innocent lives we lost on that terrible day.
Like so many of you, I can remember exactly where I was when I heard the news of the attacks.
My thoughts immediately turned to all thosefamily, friends, neighborswho were working in New York City.
Before long, I too was consumed by the enormous void that was left by the tragic loss of life.
When I remember, I still feel the deep sadness, anger, and resolve I felt on that day and the days that followed.
As a nation, we must always remember that our freedom isnt free.
There are evil forces who wish to destroy our way of life.
We must remain alert to all threats to our freedom wherever they arise.
Thanks to our armed forces and our first responders, we will defend ourselves and bring to justice all those who seek to destroy us.
Today, I join you as we remember those we lost and pray for those who fight to protect our freedom.
We will continue to recover, but we must never forget.
May God continue to bless the United States of America.
Sincerely,
Scott Garrett
