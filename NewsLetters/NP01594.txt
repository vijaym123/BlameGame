Dear
Friend,
Please take a
minute to answer the questions below.
Wisconsin taxpayers are paying for expanded Medicaid in
states throughout the nation, but those taxes are not coming back to
benefit Wisconsin. According to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal
Bureau, an estimated 152,000 Wisconsinites would qualify for Medicaid if
Governor Walker accepts the federal funding.
Would you support expanding Medicaid in
Wisconsin? Yes No If yes, why? (check as
many as apply) The federal funding will go to other states if Wisconsin does not
expand Medicaid Medicaid expansion will provide quality, affordable health coverage
to over 150,000 Wisconsinites Republican Governors across the country have taken
federal Medicaid expansion support It is irresponsible to refuse $345 million in
federal funds when Wisconsin faces a $2 billion budget
shortfall Other? *By answering this survey, you
