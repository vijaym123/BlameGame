Dear Friend,
One of my favorite parts of my job is the opportunity to travel around
Oregon and meet with folks from all corners of our state.
I was lucky recently to get to spend a day in Newport, holding a town
hall with local citizens, meeting with the Newport Fishermen's Wives
and other leaders about continuing the fight to protect our Coast Guard
helicopter, and visiting the Coast Guard stations in Newport to learn
directly about the lifesaving work they do.
It's always a privilege to hear directly from the Oregonians that I
represent, and this day was no different. From talking directly with
constituents in the town hall forum, to strategizing with local leaders
about the next steps to keep the Coast Guard helicopter in Newport, to
learning firsthand about the critical and dangerous search and rescues
that the Coast Guard performs along our coast, being on the ground and
hearing from Oregonians always strengthens my ability to fight for
Oregon priorities back in Washington, D.C.
Thanks again for helping to inform my work and to make our democracy
stronger. And don't forget to check out the Facebook photos
of my day in Newport and follow me on Facebook for
similar updates in the future.
All my best,
Jeff
