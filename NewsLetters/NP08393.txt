Dear Friend,
Yesterday marked the one year anniversary of the Supreme Court's
decision to strike down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act
(DOMA). This historic decision upheld our American values of equality
and freedom for all, no matter who you are or who you love.
Marriage equality is deeply personal for me. I gave a gay rights speech
when I was just 15 years old, and I've been a strong advocate ever
since. A few years ago, I was proud to welcome my brother's husband
into our family. And one of my proudest moments in the state
legislature was voting for marriage equality.
The Supreme Court's decision to strike down DOMA meant that thousands
of gay and lesbian couples received federal recognition of their
marriages and some of the federal benefits they deserve. But there is
still work we need to do. I am committed to doing what I can to move
our country forward, which is why I'm a coauthor of the SAME Act. My
bill would ensure that all couples-regardless of who they love or where
they live-receive the Social Security benefits they've earned after
lifetimes of hard work.
Watch the video below, where I share what the decision to strike down
DOMA meant to me:
If you or your loved ones are experiencing any difficulty accessing the
federal benefits you deserve, my office is here to help. As always,
please don't hesitate to reach out to me with your thoughts on this or
any other issue by email
or at 860-223-8412. To find out more about my
work in Congress, check out my Facebook

Sincerely,
Elizabeth Esty
Member of Congress

2014 Dear
Friend,
Yesterday
marked
the
one
year
anniversary
of
the
Supreme
Court&#8217;s
decision
to
strike
down
Section
3
of
the
Defense
of
Marriage
Act
(DOMA).
This
historic
decision
upheld
our
American
values
of
equality
and
freedom
for
all,
no
matter
who
you
are
or
who
you
love.
Marriage
equality
is
deeply
personal
for
me.
I
gave
a
gay
rights
speech
when
I
was
just
15
years
old,
and
I&#8217;ve
been
a
strong
advocate
ever
since.
A
few
years
ago,
I
was
proud
to
welcome
my
brother&#8217;s
husband
into
our
family.
And
one
of
my
proudest
moments
in
the
state
legislature
was
voting
for
marriage
equality.
The
Supreme
Court&#8217;s
decision
to
strike
down
DOMA
meant
that
thousands
of
gay
and
lesbian
couples
received
federal
recognition
of
their
marriages
and
some
of
the
federal
benefits
they
deserve.
But
there
is
still
work
we
need
to
do.
I
am
committed
to
doing
what
I
can
to
move
our
country
forward,
which
is
why
I&#8217;m
a
coauthor
of
the
SAME
Act.
My
bill
would
ensure
that
all
couples&#8212;regardless
of
who
they
love
or
where
they
live&#8212;receive
the
Social
Security
benefits
they&#8216;ve
earned
after
lifetimes
of
hard
work.
