Breaking News: House Passes Nolan Amendment to Prohibit Afghanistan
Infrastructure Funding
"The funds prohibited by my amendment would almost certainly have ended
up in the hands of corrupt officials."
- Congressman Rick Nolan
(WASHINGTON, D.C.) - In a late-Wednesday night session of Congress, the
U.S. House of Representatives adopted an amendment authored by Eighth
District Congressman Rick Nolan prohibiting funding for all military
infrastructure projects in Afghanistan.
The Nolan measure, adopted by voice vote, amends the National Defense
Appropriations Act (H.R.4870) to state that none of the funding in the
bill would be used for the Afghanistan Infrastructure Fund, part of the
Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), which is used for military
construction or reconstruction projects abroad.
The OCO is authorized to spend up to $79 billion in infrastructure
projects, with $790 million currently authorized for use in
Afghanistan, although that number could change once the President
submits his budget request.
In a speech on the Floor of the House late Wednesday, Rep. Nolan told
his colleagues that according to the Special Inspector General for
Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), Afghanistan is "one of the most
corrupt nations in the world," supplying more heroin than all the other
nations in the world combined. Since traditional banking services do
not exist in most of the country, construction projects are financed,
quite literally, with "truckloads of cash" driven by U.S. personnel.
As consequence, explained Nolan, the federal government can never fully
assure these projects are built at all. Most of the money authorized
for Afghanistan construction is completely unaccounted-for.
"The funds prohibited by my amendment would almost certainly have ended
up in the hands of corrupt officials," said Nolan.
"As U.S. troops withdraw from Afghanistan, more and more of the country
is outside of the areas in which U.S. personnel can travel and operate
safely," he added. "Subsequently, there is no way to properly audit or
inspect these projects.
"It is an unmitigated prescription for unparalleled waste of taxpayer
money, and tonight we put a stop to it."
H.R.4870 is expected to pass the U.S. House of Representatives tomorrow
by a bipartisan vote, whereupon it will move to the Senate for action.

A Message from Congressman

Nolan
Breaking
News: House
Passes
Nolan
Amendment
to
Prohibit
Afghanistan
Infrastructure
Funding
&#8220;The
funds
prohibited
by
my
amendment
would
almost

have
ended
up
in
the
hands
of
corrupt
officials.&#8221;
&#8211;
Congressman
Rick
Nolan
(WASHINGTON,
D.C.)
&#8211;
In
a
late-Wednesday
night
session
of
Congress,
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives
adopted
an
amendment
authored
by
Eighth
District
Congressman
Rick
Nolan
prohibiting
funding
for
all
military
infrastructure
projects
in
Afghanistan.
The
Nolan
measure,
adopted
by
voice
vote,
amends
the
National
Defense
Appropriations
Act
(H.R.4870)
to
state
that
none
of
the
funding
in
the
bill
would
be
used
for
the
Afghanistan
Infrastructure
Fund ,
part
of
the
Overseas
Contingency
Operations
(OCO),
which
is
used
for
military
construction
or
reconstruction
projects
abroad.
The
OCO
is
authorized
to
spend
up
to
$79
billion
in
infrastructure
projects,
with
$790
million
currently
authorized
for
use
in
Afghanistan,
although
that
number
could
change
once
the
President
submits
his
budget
request.
In
a
speech
on
the
Floor
of
the
House
late
Wednesday,
Rep.
Nolan
told
his
colleagues
that
according
to
the
Special
Inspector
General
for
Afghanistan
Reconstruction
(SIGAR),
Afghanistan
is
&#8220;one
of
the
most
corrupt
nations
in
the
world,&#8221;
supplying
more
heroin
than
all
the
other
nations
in
the
world
combined.
Since
traditional
banking
services
do
not
exist
in
most
of
the
country,
construction
projects
are
financed,
quite
literally,
with
&#8220;truckloads
of
cash&#8221;
driven
by
U.S.
personnel.
As
consequence,
explained
Nolan,
the
federal
government
can
never
fully
assure
these
projects
are
built
at
all.
Most
of
the
money
authorized
for
Afghanistan
construction
is
completely
unaccounted-for.
&#8220;The
funds
prohibited
by
my
amendment
would
almost
certainly
have
ended
up
in
the
hands
of
corrupt
officials,&#8221;
said
Nolan.
&#8220;As
U.S.
troops
withdraw
from
Afghanistan,
more
and
more
of
the
country
is
outside
of
the
areas
in
which
U.S.
personnel
can
travel
and
operate
safely,&#8221;
he
added.
&#8220;Subsequently,
there
is
no
way
to
properly
audit
or

these
projects.
&#8220;It
is
an
unmitigated
prescription
for
unparalleled
waste
of
taxpayer
money,
and
tonight
we
put
a
stop
to
it.&#8221;
H.R.4870
is
expected
to
pass
the
U.S.
House
of

tomorrow
by
a

whereupon
it
will
