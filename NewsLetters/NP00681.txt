Memorial Day

From the very time that Betsy Ross created the first flag, our American heroes carried that flag through the streets of Concord, across the fields of Gettysburg, through the rocks of Iwo Jima, the tundra of Korea, the jungles of Vietnam, and the deserts of the Middle East.
To all of them that have given their lives on our behalf for freedom, we are forever grateful.
