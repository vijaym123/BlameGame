To all who celebrate Hanukkah, both at home and abroad, please accept my warmest greetings. The Festival of Lights is a joyous time of year that commemorates a miracle, and is probably the most fitting time to give thanks for our blessings of the past year.
In this Holiday Season, in honor of the Menorahs lights as a symbol of freedom and hope shining through the darkness, lets re-dedicate ourselves to creating a more peaceful world, especially for our friends in Israel.
On behalf of my family and loved ones, please accept my best wishes for a joyous and safe Hanukkah.
