Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Last Friday, I had the privilege of facilitating a computer donation for the Polk Training Center. The Lake Alfred Chamber of Commerce joined me at the Polk Training Center as the
Alliance for Affordable Services
donated ten refurbished computers to enhance the work that the Polk Training Center is doing to assist members of our community with developmental disabilities. It was a pleasure to work with Alliance to connect business with the community by supporting a local service organization.

Last summer, I visited the Winter Haven Meals on Wheels to meet their volunteers and hear about the work they are doing to feed the homeless population in Polk County. On Friday, I stopped by their thrift store with a load of donations to help support their faithful service in Polk County. It was good to hear an update on their volunteers and the residents they are serving.

This past Wednesday, I went for a demonstration ride in a fully autonomous, driverless vehicle produced by Carnegie Mellon University. Similar in appearance to a normal vehicle, I sat in the back of the car with another member of congress and an engineer as the car drove itself down a portion of the Washington Mall. It was great to experience the ingenuity of American engineering and see the latest transportation technology.

Victor Fan from Dr. Phillips High School won my Congressional Art Competition this year, and was flown to Washington by Southwest Airlines for the honorary reception last week. I am looking forward to seeing Victors masterpiece, prominently displayed in the Cannon Tunnel, each time I go to the Capitol to vote.

It has been an honor to see young men and women eager to rise up, advance through the Service Academy nomination process, and dedicate themselves to serving our country. Trevin Weech, one of my Service Academy nominees from West Orange High School, stopped in Washington last week with his family before reporting for the United States Military Academy at West Point.
Service Academy applications and information is now available
on my website
for those interested in finding more about the United States Service Academies.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
A constituent from Winter Haven recently contacted my office regarding a problem he was experiencing receiving his mail.
The street address was 403 , and any mail that was marked 403 B instead of
was not being delivered. My office submitted a Congressional inquiry to the United States Postal Service (USPS) on his behalf. Shortly afterwards, the constituent stopped by my office to inform my staff that he is receiving his mail again, and believes the issue has been resolved.
Constituent Services is a critical element of our congressional office, and no federal issue that affects your life is too small. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
For the past several years, the Obama Administration has been overreaching the jurisdiction of the Executive Branch and assuming authority that is not prescribed in the Constitution. Last week, the United States Supreme Court ruled against President Obamas attempt to circumvent the jurisdiction and activity of Congress by making illegal appointments to the National Labor Relations Board.
Several months ago, I shared with the House Leadership a procedure used by the Florida Legislature, when I was a member of that body, to sue the Governor for overstepping his bounds. Last week, Speaker Boehner took the same action by announcing the US House of Representatives would file a law suit against President Obama for stepping across the line between the legislative and executive branches of government.
Do you believe that the three branches of government work in tandem, but should stay within their jurisdictional areas that our founders outlined within the Constitution?
Yes
