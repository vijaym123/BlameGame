Dear Friends,
As you know, it has
been a busy couple of weeks in Congress and we have made some
bittersweet progress in fighting for our great state of Idaho.
On the
sweeter side, two of my bills combating federal land control are headed
to the president and should become law.
The first bill is
the Grazing Improvement Act that allows 20,000 ranchers to extend
delayed grazing rights on over 250 million acres of federal land across
the West.
This helps improve the rural economies that rely on
ranching in Idaho.
The second bill, the Idaho County Shooting
Range Land Conveyance Act, will clear the way for the first public
shooting range in Idaho County.
This bill transfers 31 acres near
Riggins from the Bureau of Land Management to Idaho County, filling an
important need of our local law enforcement agencies.
These
bills are good for our state and I have worked hard to get them
passed.
However
on the bitter side
while I voted for the bills
when they first passed the House, I was unable to do so last week on
their final passage.
That is because these two natural resource
committee bills were bundled into the 1,648-page National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA).
I voted against the NDAA because I
have never liked the DC practice of tying unrelated bills to must
pass legislation.
I also object to the NDAA on both foreign policy
and civil liberties grounds.
I oppose the NDAA's authorization
of $1.6 billion to arm and train Syrian rebels, and still have concerns
about the NDAAs failure to properly define the standards for the
indefinite detention of U.S. citizens suspected of
terrorism.
In this case, House leadership
in order to get support for NDAA bill
decided to lump together 96 other bills that were totally unrelated
to defense.
The Senate has since approved the NDAA, including
the Grazing Improvement Act and the Idaho County Shooting Range Land
Conveyance Act.
President Obama is expected to sign it into
law.
Now, although I am happy that I have been able to achieve
these positive changes for Idaho, I am saddened that they were passed
in this manner.
Last week, I also voted against the
fiscal year 2015 catchall appropriations bill that spends $1.1 trillion,
up $88 billion from fiscal year 2014 levels.
Once again,
Congress has failed to take seriously its responsibility to squarely address
the federal spending crisis.
The process was driven by a
handful of people behind closed doors.
The result was a 1,603-page
bill larded with pork and favors for special interests.
The
funding bill also failed to address the Presidents unconstitutional
immigration order.
When the people of Idahos First District
elected me in 2010, I promised to stay true to my principles and not be
changed by business as usual in Washington.
I promised Idahoans I
would do everything in my power to stem the growth of our now-$18
trillion debt, which Congress refuses to do.
Next year, with both
the House and Senate in Republican hands, my sincere hope is we enact
meaningful spending reforms and go about doing the peoples business in
an open and honest way.
In closing, please take 90
seconds to listen to
Sen. Coburns farewell
speech .
He has always been an inspiration to me and I am proud to call
him a friend.
He reminded his colleagues in the Senate and the
House that do not take an oath to provide benefits to our
states.
Instead, our oath is to protect the United States of America, its
constitution and its liberties.
We need more people like Tom
Coburn serving in Congress.
Thank you ,
