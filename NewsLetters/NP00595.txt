North Briton #45: The
forgotten history of the Fourth Amendment, and its relevance for reforming the
Patriot Act
The authorization for the Patriot Act will
soon expire, and elected officials in Washington have been debating
whether it should be renewed. There are those who believe this law, which
was passed in the wake of the September 11 attacks, should be renewed
with no changes.
Since the last time it was authorized,
Americans have learned that certain provisions of this Act were being
interpreted by the National Security Agency to give this agency
authority to collect bulk metadata on the phone calls of every American. This
controversial practice has led to an erosion of support for the
Patriot Act in Congress, and currently there arent enough votes in
Congress to pass a clean re-authorization of this law. Americans across the
country are rising up and demanding that their rights to privacy be
protected.
The Constitution of the United States protects
the American people against unreasonable searches, and it does so
against a long historical backdrop of government abuse. Over time, our
founding fathers came to an understanding that the immense power of
government needs to be constrained. They understood that those in power will
tend to accumulate more power, and in time they will tend to abuse
that power, unless that power is carefully constrained. Americas
founding fathers were informed in many respects by what they learned from our
previous national government, our London-based national
government.
They were informed in part by the story of John Wilkes.
John Wilkes, not to be confused with John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of
Abraham Lincoln, was a member of English parliament. In 1763 he found
himself at the receiving end of King George IIIs justice. In 1763,
John Wilkes had published a document known as the North Briton Number
45. The North Briton was a weekly circular, or type of news magazine in
England. Unlike most of the other weeklies in England at a time, The
North Briton was not dedicated to the praise of King George III and his
ministers. From time to time, this weekly would actually criticize
the actions of King George.
At the time John Wilkes
published The North Briton Number 45, he became the enemy of the King because
he had criticized certain remarks delivered by the King in his
address to Parliament. While not openly and directly critical of the King
himself, he criticized the Kings ministers who had prepared the
remarks. For King George III this was simply too much. This simply could not
stand. So on Easter Sunday 1763 John Wilkes found himself arrested and
he found himself subject to an invasive search.

Amendment, you can

Deciding
the Fate of the Patriot Act
This Sunday, the Senate will
convene to decide the fate of key aspects of the Patriot Act before they
expire at 12:01 a.m. on Monday. As this deadline approaches, it is
becoming clear that he USA Freedom Act is the only solution the Senate
can pass that would end the NSAs blanket metadata collection and
storage activities, while still keeping non-controversial sections of the
Patriot Act intact. After a landslide vote in the House of
Representative of 338 - 88, it is unlikely that the House would pass any other
alternative the Senate sends their way - even if they had the time. I
have been doing everything I can to ensure that controverisal sections
of the Patriot Act are not reauthorized, and you can
learn more about these efforts here . I will also plan to keep you
updated on the progress of these efforts as developments
unfold.
