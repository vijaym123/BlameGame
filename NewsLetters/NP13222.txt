I hope your holiday season went well! As we move forward in 2014, I
imagine things will start really picking up in Washington. In that
regard, I want to keep you as updated as possible on happenings in
Congress, but rather than flooding your inbox with emails, I thought I'd
pass along the link to my Facebook page
.
If you haven't already 'liked' my page on Facebook
, it's where I post explanations of votes I take,
articles I found interesting, or updates about where I'll be when I'm
at home in the Lowcountry. It makes it that much easier for me to stay
in touch with you while also hearing your thoughts on a whole host of
issues.
So if you have a moment, please click here to 'like' my page on
Facebook
. I'll continue to send updates through the monthly
newsletter and be in touch with folks who write and contact my offices,
but in the meantime, this is a good way to stay up to date!

Take good care,
Mark

Lowcountry.
It
makes
it
that
much
easier
for
me
to
stay

also
hearing
your

on
a
