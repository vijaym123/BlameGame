Achieving
American Energy Independence Will Reduce
Gas Prices and Create Virginia
Jobs
Dear Friend,
With Independence Day approaching,
AAA
estimates that a record 1.16 million
Virginians
will hit the road for the
July 4th weekend. Whether you are going out
of town or just driving to see your local
display of fireworks, you are certainly
continuing to feel the significant pain at
the pump that has plagued our country for
the last several years. It is hard to
believe that only five short years ago, the
national average price for a gallon of gas
was $2.35 compared to $3.68 today. I often
hear from constituents throughout the Fifth
District about how todays high
energy costs are significantly harming our
families, Main Street businesses, and
family farms, all of which are struggling
with higher costs not only for fuel, but
also the goods and services that depend on
fuel. The increased electricity rates,
grocery prices, and transportation costs
make it harder and harder for families to
achieve or maintain financial
stability.
Last week, the House of Representatives
once again took action to alleviate the
effects of high fuel prices by approving
H.R. 4899, the Lowering Gasoline Prices to
Fuel an America that Works Act.
I
was proud to support this measure ,
which expands onshore energy production,
streamlines permitting processes, and
reduces unnecessary red tape. This bill
represents a significant milestone in our
goal to achieve energy independence by
easing government regulations that hamper
American energy production and job
creation. It also represents a central
piece of our all of the above
energy strategy that includes increased oil
and gas production, including off of
Virginias coast, the use of
alternative energies, as well as
conservation.
Over the last five years, this
administration has unnecessarily restricted
energy production on federal lands and
canceled lease sales on over 85 percent of
our domestic offshore areas. It is time
that we take advantage of the numerous
natural resources Virginia has to offer and
overcome the barriers to energy
independence and job creation that this
administration has created. These proposals
have enjoyed strong bipartisan and
bicameral support for many years, and it is
my hope that our colleagues in the Senate
will help us to advance these policies and
in turn create thousands of new Virginia
jobs.
I am pleased that the House of
Representatives has acted to encourage the
creation of new jobs and lighten the burden
on our hardworking families and small
businesses, while harnessing the natural
resources we have here in the United
States. I look forward to continuing to
work with my colleagues to create a
sensible and robust domestic energy policy
that increases our energy security and
strengthens our economy, and I hope the
Senate and the President will join us in
this crucial effort.
