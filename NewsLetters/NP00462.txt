Dear
Fellow Nevadan,
Yesterday the Department of the Interior
announced the approval of three solar energy projects on public lands in
Nevada.
It is remarkable how much progress we have made in
building a renewable energy industry in Nevada. In 2009, I was proud to
join former Secretary Ken Salazar to announce a plan to prioritize and
expedite permitting for renewable energy projects on public lands. In
2010, the first solar project on Nevada public lands was approved. The
three solar projects approved today alone will create 1,900 jobs and
generate enough electricity to power over 130,000
homes.
This progress did not happen by accident; it is a result of diligent and
determined efforts to make Nevada the capital of clean energy. These
efforts came from the federal level in the form of assistance and
incentives, including financing to build the One Nevada transmission line
and tax credits for solar, wind and geothermal. These efforts came
from the state level, including passage of the law that closed a large
dirty coal plant, while replacing it with clean and renewable energy.
And these efforts came from the private sector, through innovative
companies like Tesla, SolarCity, Ormat and others. Clean energy is good for
the economy and is good for the environment. No state in the union
has the opportunity that we have. Clean energy is Nevadas
future.
This August, I will co-host the eighth annual Clean Energy
Summit in Las Vegas. Every year this event brings together leaders from the
private sector, academia, and government to discuss clean energy
innovation and investment in Nevada. Discussions like those that take
place during the summit have been vital to achieving the rapid expansion
of clean energy and innovation in the Silver State and beyond. For more
information about the summit and to register online, please go to
