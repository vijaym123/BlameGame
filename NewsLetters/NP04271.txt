Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Mission Inn, located in Howey-in-the-Hills, celebrated their 50th anniversary by honoring 50 couples who have been married for 50 years. It was a pleasure to recognize these couples this weekend and thank them for their faithful commitment to each other, their families, and their community. As one of the main hubs of Lake County, this ceremony was a wonderful way for Mission Inn to celebrate their own 50th anniversary of serving the Lake County community.

Earlier this year, I was privileged to address the Leesburg Armory, and it was an honor to be invited to speak with the soldiers and their families at the Winter Haven Armory in Polk County this week. I am grateful for all the men and women of our Armed Forces, and it was a pleasure to speak with this contingency of the Florida National Guard and participate in serving them lunch as they celebrated their early Family Day Christmas Party.

George Hagerty, President of Beacon College, met with me in Washington this week to give me an update on their educational program and progress. This year, Beacon College celebrated their 25th anniversary of offering academic opportunities for students with learning disabilities and ADHD. Located in Leesburg, I have had the privilege of visiting Beacon College several times, and was glad to hear an update of the school and students.

On Friday, I was privileged to speak at the Second Annual Leadership Prayer Breakfast of Lake County as we consider the importance of Gods guidance and blessing in our country and community. As we look forward to celebrating Thanksgiving this week, it is a good time to reflect on our many blessings and remember the rich history of our great American heritage.

Tildenville Elementary School in Winter Garden held their annual Teach In community week, and it was a pleasure to visit many of their classrooms, teachers, and students on Friday. I am grateful for our educators who are dedicated to teaching the next generation, and was glad to talk to the students and answer their questions as I represent our community in Washington.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Recently, a realtor contacted my office on behalf of a constituent from Clermont, whose closing date for his new home was only two weeks away. The bank was having trouble obtaining a transcript verifying his 2013 taxes. The constituent had previously attempted to file electronically but when that failed, he had gone to the local IRS office.
Unfortunately, his return was not showing in the system.
My office submitted an inquiry on the constituents behalf, asking that the looming closing date be taken into consideration. The Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) worked with the IRS and was able to post the return, make the transcript available to the bank, and process the refund prior to the date of closing.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
For the past year, the Obama Administration has negotiated with Iran over Irans continued efforts to acquire nuclear technology. The Obama Administration relaxed previous sanctions, allowing billions of dollars to flow into Irans government coffers, and persuaded Congress to not impose new sanctions in order to give the negotiations a chance. Now, this afternoon, we learn that Secretary of State John Kerry has extended the negotiations for another 7 months and released billions more dollars without so much as an agreed upon set of principles.
Should the Obama Administration continue negotiating with Iran and allow Iran to continue to develop any quantity of uranium or centrifuge technology that could eventually lead to their possession of a nuclear weapon?

Legislative Update:
Last week, the House of Representatives resumed our work to clear the way for job creation, certainty, and economic stability. I voted to support H.R. 4795, the Promoting New Manufacturing Act, legislation that would provide for a more predictable, efficient, and transparent permitting process for industrial facilities under the Clean Air Act.
Our regulatory and permitting process should be considered with transparency and take into account economic impact in order to ensure the smartest approach. I am committed to strong congressional oversight to ensure these principles of rulemaking are put into practice at all federal regulatory agencies so that our environment is safe and our job creators in Central Florida are well-positioned to expand and create economic growth.
