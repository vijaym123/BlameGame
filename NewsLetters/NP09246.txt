Dear Friend,
The
scandals currently rocking our VA system show a lack of competent
management. When bureaucrats know that it is almost impossible to be fired,
performance often takes a nose dive. Thats why, among other steps last
week, I cosponsored and voted for the bipartisan VA Accountability
Act. This bill gives VA leadership the authority needed to remove failing
senior executives. I demand they use it.
Speaking with
the local Colorado VA
leadership
I placed a call from my Washington office to
the leadership staff at the Colorado Springs VA Clinic and the Denver VA
Hospital. I was assured that no secret waiting lists are being used
in Colorado. Additionally, I was informed that the facilities have
passed impromptu Inspector General checks within the last
month.
However, I understand that
wait times of any length are frustrating. That's why Im getting ahead of
the curve. I inserted language in the 2015 National Defense
Authorization Act directing that a study begin on adding a Joint DOD-VA Clinic
(with emergency room care) to northern El Paso
County.
If you are experiencing ANY problems
with the local VA system, please call my Colorado Springs office at
(719) 520-0055. My staff will do everything they can to assist
you.
It is an honor to
serve you in
Congress.
Sincerely,
What's Happening in
Washington DC
ADDRESSING THE VA
SCANDAL
From my position as the second-ranking Republican on the House
Veterans Affairs Committee, I remain focused on the VA
Scandal.
I drafted a letter to VA Secretary Eric Shinseki, signed by
the entire Republican Colorado delegation, requesting a detailed report
on the state of affairs of the VA system in Colorado. Letters from
Members of Congress are taken very seriously at agencies and we expect a
timely response from the
VA.
I've
supported the efforts of the Veterans Affairs Committee in subpoenaing VA
officials to get to the bottom of the problems occurring across the
country.

comments on these subpoena
efforts
I also
spoke out on the House Floor in support of the VA Accountability Act, I
interviewed with AM 740 KVOR's Richard Randall locally and was on
nationwide TV with Glenn Beck's network The Blaze discussing this
issue.

Heads
must roll in this situation. Secretary Shinseki must fire the
Hospital Directors and others responsible for any secret waiting lists.
If he himself knew about any such waiting-list, he must himself resign
and face the consequences. In addition, he must recall the bonuses
recently paid out to leadership at the hospitals currently under
suspicion.
ADDING IMPORTANT AMENDMENTS TO THE NDAA REGARDING
MILITARY RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND THE NEW START
TREATY
On the House Floor
last week, I had six more amendments adopted into the final language
of the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act. The full 2015 National
Defense Authorization Act passed the House by a bipartisan vote of 325
to 98. Of particular importance is my amendment language mandating a
rewriting of overly strict Department of Defense and Air Force
regulations regarding religious freedom in the military. This passed
unanimously and directs the DOD and Air Force to rewrite existing regulations
to ensure that verbal and written expressions of individual faith are
protected by new regulations. It is unacceptable to me that our men
and women who defend our Constitution do not currently enjoy all the
protections of the Constitution. Changes to internal regulations must be
made in order for religious freedom to be fully protected for the
members of our military.

Religious Freedom

Family Research Council Radio's Tony Perkins on Military Religious
Freedom
I
also had an amendment adopted that prohibits funding for the
implementation of the New START Treaty (calling for a reduction in our nuclear
capabilities) until Russia withdraws from Ukraine. The United States
should not be spending money to disarm ourselves
to dramatically cut
our strategic nuclear deterrent
if the other party to the treaty
requiring these cuts is verifiably dishonest. The Russian Federation is
clearly not trustworthy. Their actions in Ukraine and violation of
agreements such as the INF Treaty and CFE Treaty should be cause for great
concern. Vladimir Putin is a serial treaty violator who should not be
trusted with Americas national security. I am pleased that the House
adopted my resolution by an overwhelming, bipartisan
majority.

Amendment
Other amendments I
successfully added to the NDAA before its final passage last week
include:
An
amendment establishing the sense of Congress that national security
functions, such as military training and exercises, should be a top
priority, particularly when land owned by the US government is to be
used. We must be smart about how and where the military trains in order to
preserve our pristine national parks; however we must also remember
that the first job of the federal government is to protect our
nation.
An
amendment ensuring that the Afghan government does not levy illegal taxes
against companies supporting our military men and women taking part in
Operation Enduring Freedom. This has cost American companies at least a
billion dollars that should be recovered from
Afghanistan.
An amendment giving
additional authority to the non-profit Air Force Academy Athletics
Corporation to allow them to supply equipment and services to the athletics
teams, including supporting travel. These changes will allow the AFAAC
to provide better support to the student-athletes at the Air Force
Academy and will save taxpayer funds. This is because the AFAAC has
access to private sector fundraising efforts to support Air Force Academy
Athletics.
An amendment requiring the Director of National Intelligence to
produce a public report on the
political and economic corruption among
senior Russian leaders, including an analysis of potentially illegal
attainment of financial assets.
Also last week in Washington, I was able to cosponsor two
very important pieces of
legislation:
The Repeal Amendment will provide
States with the ability to repeal any federal law, regulation, tax, or
unfunded mandate if two-thirds of the State legislatures are in
agreement. The text of the legislation reads, Any provision of law or
regulation of the United States may be repealed by the several states, and
such a repeal shall be effective when the legislatures of two-thirds of
the several states approve resolutions for this purpose that
particularly describe the same provision or provisions of law or regulation to
be repealed.
The Every Child Is A Blessing Act is important pro-life legislation
that will put a stop to wrongful birth lawsuits that are being made
because of children born with disabilities. Please click

legislation.

What Say
You?
One of the most important things I
can do is listen to my constituents. My staff and I get thousands of
phone calls, emails, letters, and social media postings every week. Here
is a sampling of what you are saying.
On
my
Facebook
this week constituents shared their thoughts on the VA
Scandal:

This
has everything to do with corrupt people in the VA offices... Each
person is responsible for their own actions. These people knew our Vets
were not receiving proper care. PERIOD! Anyone with a part in it needs
to be fired from the top down.

Please hold
those responsible accountable. Dinesh D'Souza is going to jail for a
minor infraction. But these criminals like Lois Lerner and VA
administrators do not get punished.
Donna

Thank you! Make them
appear and make them talk. Then hold them accountable.

I contacted your office; I wrote two letters, and went to
your office, in person. Mr. Dale Anderson was extremely helpful, thank
you. I am 45, the VA says that I am dying(which I am), they do not know
why, refused to do anymore testing, nor listen to ME. Mr. Anderson
LISTENED; thank you. I am going to get to see the doctor I NEED, I could
not wait until all the trends were followed. Thank you so much,
Congressman Lamborn. This veteran knows you care.
