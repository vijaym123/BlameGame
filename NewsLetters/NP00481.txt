U.S. Sens.
John Thune (R-S.D.) and Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) and U.S. Rep. Kristi Noem
(R-S.D.) this week urged the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA),
its Office of General Counsel (OGC), and Forest Service (FS) to finally
take responsibility for the Pautre fire that beginning on April 3,
2013, consumed grass on more than 10,000 acres of public and private
pasture land, and damaged and destroyed fences, bales of forage,
buildings, and trees. Damages from the fire occurred on both sides of South
Dakota's northern border.
This week's
letter will draw attention to this important issue and help expedite the
process so farmers and ranchers can more quickly submit their claims.
The Pautre fire that occurred in Perkins County is the first of two
recent out-of-control prescribed burns in South Dakota. Most recently,
the Cold Brook fire in Wind Cave National Park burned more than 6,500
acres.
