Friends,
The first week of
August has come and gone, and many of you are soaking in the last few
weeks of summer.
As our families prepare for the start of a
new school year, the last thing they need to worry about is a sluggish
economy, dwindling paychecks and rising bills.
But
according to a recent
Wall Street Journal
survey, 60%
of Americans are dissatisfied with the state of our economy, and over
70% believe our nation is headed in the wrong
direction.
Now more than ever, our families, our
students, our workers and our veterans need real
solutions.
Unfortunately, Washington is making life more difficult
at the
hospital, in the job market and at the gas pump. You know whats best
for you and your family, not a government bureaucrat who has never
stepped foot in our district. That is why its so important that I hear
from you about your top concerns, your most pressing needs, and your
bright ideas
ideas that can root out the waste and steer decision-making
power back to North Carolina and away from
Washington.
This week, Ive had the privilege of working
and traveling in the district to hear whats on your
mind.
We are fortunate to have a variety of quality small businesses and
manufacturers in our district that drive our local economies and provide
unique services.
One of the businesses I toured was the
2013 winner of Stanly Countys Small Business of the Year - Seven Oaks
Doors &amp; Hardware in Oakboro. The commercial hardware manufactured
here is used in schools, universities, hospitals, and other
manufacturing facilities across the Carolinas and Virginia. Not only does this
business supply our region with unparalleled products and services, it
also provides workers specialized, high-skilled
jobs.
I also had the chance to visit K2 Solutions in
Ellerbe. Did you know our district is home to one of the leading canine
detection training and research facilities in the nation? Among other
defense services, K2 Solutions provides law enforcement and military
personnel with trained explosives detection canines.
As
Chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation Security, Im a huge
proponent of these highly-effective canine teams as part of the
risk-based approach to security.
The capabilities that the dogs
are learning at K2 Solutions are exactly the tools we need to respond
to growing threats, protect our
nations transportation system and keep passengers
safe.
Another business that is essential to
the economic success of our district and our state is
Concord
Regional Airport. In total, the airport has contributed $176 million to
the local economy and supported nearly 2,000 jobs. In 2012 alone,
Concord Regional had almost 60,000 landings and takeoffs and nearly 4,000
commercial flights. The number of passengers boarding has increased
3,000 percent in the last four years. Last year I worked with my
colleagues to prevent devastating cuts to contract control
towers that would have severely hampered growth at the
airport.
Ill continue to fight against bad policies that hurt our local
economy and will push for new opportunities to
expand.
Finally, this
week I had the opportunity to view the new Carolinas Healthcare facility
in Anson county that provides access to quality healthcare for folks
throughout our district. This new hospital is engaging directly in the
community to address long term health issues and bring qualified
specialists directly to Anson so that families arent forced to travel
long distances just to get the care they deserve. By utilizing new
technologies, providing mobile access,
and co-locating family
practice and
hospital services, the Anson facility is changing healthcare
for the
better.
These
productive discussions made clear to me that we need real solutions that get
government out of the way and empower our local
communities. Since being sworn-in as a Member of Congress, I have passed three
bipartisan bills out of the U.S. House of Representatives. In a town wrecked
with partisan gridlock, I am very proud of this
accomplishment.
I will continue my work to ensure an economic-friendly
environment where our local businesses can grow and create
jobs.
Until next week,
Richard
Hudson
Member of Congress
(NC-08)
