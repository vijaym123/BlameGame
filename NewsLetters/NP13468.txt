Dear Friend,
I hope you and your family are having a wonderful holiday season and
looking forward to a great 2014.
As we close in on the New Year, I
want you all to know that an important health insurance deadline is
quickly approaching.
If you are eligible to enroll through our state's
health insurance marketplace - known as Connect for Health Colorado
- and would like coverage to begin on January 1, 2014,
you will need to sign up by December 23, 2013. For those applying after
January 1, 2014, the enrollment period ends March 31, 2014.
Over the past few months, the marketplaces created under the Affordable
Care Act (ACA) have received a great deal of attention. However, many
of the key elements of the law that are providing benefits for millions
of Americans have been absent from the discussion. For families and
individuals in Colorado, the ACA is already making a difference in
their lives. For example:
1.9 million Coloradoans are now free from worrying about lifetime
limits on coverage.
1.3 million adults and children and 300,000 Medicare recipients have
access to preventive care services without pay.
Almost 210,000 residents will benefit from $27.5 million in rebates
from insurance companies this year.
In 2012 alone, nearly 38,000 individuals in Colorado saved over $24.3
million on prescription drugs, or an average of $645 per person.
Now that the marketplaces - like Connect for Health Colorado
- are open for business, many people have questions about
what it means for them and how it works. That is why before the
marketplaces opened for business, I hosted town hall meetings to
provide important information about the ACA, Connect for Health
Colorado
, and benefits of this comprehensive new law. If you were
unable to attend one of the many town hall meetings, you can watch the
videos below:

WATCH: ACA Town Hall Part 2:
I hope you found the information about Connect for Health Colorado
in the videos helpful.
Again, I'd like to remind you that if you are eligible to enroll
through Connect for Health Colorado
and would like coverage to start by January 1, 2014, the
last day to sign up is December 23, 2013. For those who do not sign up
by the end of this year, the opportunity to enroll ends on March 31,
2014. If you need additional assistance or have any questions, please
contact Connect for Health Colorado directly
.
As always I encourage you to follow me on Facebook and Twitter to stay
up-to-date on the latest news from Washington and in the district.
Also, you can visit my website at www.degette.house.gov, where you can
read my positions and learn about the different ways my staff can
assist you. While there, be sure to visit the "Contact
" page and send me an email about the issues that matter
most to you and your family. Finally, be sure to share this email with
your friends, family, and neighbors so that they too can be a part of
this important dialogue.

Dear
Friend,
I
hope
you
and
your
family
are
having
a
wonderful
holiday
season
and
looking
forward
to
a
great
2014.
As
we
close
in
on
the
New
Year,
I
want
you
all
to
know
that
an
important
health
insurance
deadline
is
quickly
approaching.
If
you
are
eligible
to
enroll
through
our
state&#8217;s
health
insurance
marketplace
&#8211;
known
as
Connect
for
Health
Colorado
&#8211;
and
would
like
coverage
to
begin
on
January
1,
2014,
you
will
need
to
sign
up
by
December
23,
2013 .
For
those
applying
after
January
1,
2014,
the
enrollment
period
ends
March
31,
2014.
Over
the
past
few
months,
the
marketplaces
created
under
the
Affordable
Care
Act
(ACA)
have
received
a
great
deal
of
attention.
However,
many
of
the
key
elements
of
the
law
that
are
providing
benefits
for
millions
of
Americans
have
been
absent
from
the
discussion.
For
families
and
individuals
in
Colorado,
the
ACA
is
already
making
a
difference
in
their
lives.
For
example:
1.9
million
Coloradoans
are
now
free
from
worrying
about
lifetime
limits
on
coverage.
1.3
million
adults
and
children
and
300,000
Medicare
recipients
have
access
to
preventive
care
services
without
pay.
Almost
210,000
residents
will
benefit
from
$27.5
million
in
rebates
from
insurance
companies
this
year.
In
2012
alone,
nearly
38,000
individuals
in
Colorado
saved
over
$24.3
million
on
prescription
drugs,
or
an
average
of
$645
per
person.
Now
that
the
marketplaces
&#8211;
like
Connect
for
Health
Colorado
&#8211;
are
open
for
business,
many
people
have
questions
about
what
it
means
for
them
and
how
it
works.
That
is
why
before
the
marketplaces
opened
for
business,
I
hosted
town
hall
meetings
to
provide
important
information
about
the
ACA,
Connect
for
Health
Colorado ,
and
benefits
of
this
comprehensive
new
law.
If
you
were
unable
to
attend
one
of
the
many
town
hall
meetings,
you
can
watch
the
videos
below:

I
hope
you
found
the
information
about
Connect
for
Health
Colorado
in
the
videos
helpful.
Again,
I&#8217;d
like
to
remind
you
that
if
you
are
eligible
to
enroll
through
Connect
for
Health
Colorado
and
would
like
coverage
to
start
by
January
1,
2014,
the
last
day
to
sign
up
is
December
23,
2013 .
For
those
who
do
not
sign
up
by
the
end
of
this
year,
the
opportunity
to
enroll
ends
on
March
31,
2014.
If
you
need
additional
assistance
or
have
any
questions,
please
contact
Connect
for
Health
Colorado
directly .
As
always
I
