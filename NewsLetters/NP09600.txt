Build dreams, not debt
Dear Friend,
A college degree should help individuals build dreams, not debt.
Each year, we see the cost of college tuition increase. Gov. Jindal and his allies in the legislature continue to slash higher education funding by $700 million and raise tuition and fees by 40 percent on students and their families. This is not sustainable and hinders our youth earning the education they need to compete in the world.
That is why I launched the
&ldquo;Passport to the Middle Class&rdquo; initiative , which will increase access to higher education by restoring the original potency of the Pell Grant and makes college more affordable by letting responsible borrowers take advantage of today's low interest rates that homeowners and businesses enjoy.
Listen to my interview with WJBO Radio this morning to learn more about the initiative.
When you work hard and play by the rules, you deserve a fair shot to build a prosperous future and earn a passport to the middle class. This is a basic American principle.
When we invest in our students, we invest in a better future for our country. I will continue to fight to improve our education system and ensure all Louisiana&rsquo;s students have a fair shot to earn an affordable college education.
Share this with your friends, neighbors and family.
Sincerely,
Please contact Sen. Landrieu at
the office nearest you .
