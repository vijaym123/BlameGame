Help With a Federal Agency
Dear Friend-
For the past year, the House Oversight Committee has been conducting an
investigation into malfeasance at the IRS.
As the power to tax is the
power to destroy, the abuse of power by such a mighty agency threatens
liberty and undermines the rule of law.
This investigation has, unfortunately, been met with consistent
stonewalling by the IRS and the Obama White House; it has even led to
former IRS official Lois Lerner being held in contempt of Congress for
refusing to cooperate with the investigation.
Now, late on Friday afternoon, the IRS announced that Lois Lerner's
emails from the critical time frame in question have been "lost."
Think about that: the IRS routinely imposes duties on private entities
to maintain records that could be relevant to a tax audit and would
never accept an explanation that needed documents or emails were simply
"lost."
Indeed, would the IRS accept a claim for a big charitable tax
deduction if you happened to "lose" the backup documentation?
The IRS in all its arrogance seems to think that it should live under a
different set of rules than the rest of us.
This is unacceptable and
it reeks of a Watergate-style cover-up.
This week, in response to my questions during a Judiciary Committee
hearing, FBI Director James Comey acknowledged that the agency has
finally started a criminal investigation regarding malfeasance at the
Department of Veteran Affairs. This is welcome news.
The senior officials suspected of misconduct essentially hatched a
fraudulent scheme to enrich themselves at the expense of sick veterans:
by fabricating waiting list information, the managers could claim
efficient administration and avail themselves of thousands of dollars
of taxpayer-funded bonuses. Meanwhile, sick veterans died while waiting
in line.
The American people cannot - and should not - tolerate those who harm
veterans while bilking the taxpayer.
My colleagues and I in the House continued to take action to ensure
that our nation's veterans are getting the care that they deserve by
passing Congressman Jeff Miller's Veteran Access to Care Act. This
legislation will allow veterans who cannot get an appointment at the VA
within 14 days to utilize private services.
I spoke with Neil Cavuto on Fox Business on this important topic -
watch the interview by clicking here.
I am happy to report that the Council for the Citizens Against
Government Waste has named me a "Taxpayer Hero" for my record of fiscal
conservatism and protecting taxpayers against wasteful spending.
I was
ranked the #1 taxpayer hero in all of Florida and #5 out of 435 members
of the House of Representatives.
I will continue to stand with taxpayers against special interests.
In
fact, this week I passed an anti-cronyism amendment to the annual
Transportation/HUD appropriations bill.
HUD currently allows
businesses and municipalities to take out government-guarantee loans to
finance an array of often times questionable projects. When these
projects fail, HUD allows the business or municipality to apply for
taxpayer-financed grants to pay off the taxpayer-backed loan.
It is
truly a "heads they win, tails the taxpayer loses" situation.
My
amendment blocks this type of scheme and will prevent further abuse of
taxpayer money.

hesitate to contact my Washington, Port Orange, or St. Augustine office

Dear
Friend&#8211;
For
the
past
year,
the
House
Oversight
Committee
has
been
conducting
an
investigation
into
malfeasance
at
the
IRS.
As
the
power
to
tax
is
the
power
to
destroy,
the
abuse
of
power
by
such
a
mighty
agency
threatens
liberty
and
undermines
the
rule
of
law.
This
investigation
has,
unfortunately,
been
met
with
consistent
stonewalling
by
the
IRS
and
the
Obama
White
House;
it
has
even
led
to
former
IRS
official
Lois
Lerner
being
held
in
contempt
of
Congress
for
refusing
to
cooperate
with
the
investigation.
Now,
late
on
Friday
afternoon,
the
IRS
announced
that
Lois
Lerner's
emails
from
the
critical
time
frame
in
question
have
been
"lost."
Think
about
that:
the
IRS
routinely
imposes
duties
on
private
entities
to
maintain
records
that
could
be
relevant
to
a
tax
audit
and
would
never
accept
an
explanation
that
needed
documents
or
emails
were
simply
"lost."
Indeed,
would
the
IRS
accept
a
claim
for
a
big
charitable
tax
deduction
if
you
happened
to
"lose"
the
backup
documentation?
The
IRS
in
all
its
arrogance
seems
to
think
that
it
should
live
under
a
different
set
of
rules
than
the
rest
of
us.
This
is
unacceptable
and
it reeks
of
a
Watergate-style
cover-up.
This
week,
in
response
to
my
questions
during
a
Judiciary
Committee
hearing,
FBI
Director
James
Comey
acknowledged
that
the
agency
has
finally
started
a
criminal
investigation
regarding
malfeasance
at
the
Department
of
Veteran
Affairs.
This
is
welcome
news.
The
senior
officials
suspected
of
misconduct
essentially
hatched
a
fraudulent
scheme
to
enrich
themselves
at
the
expense
of
sick
veterans:
by
fabricating
waiting
list
information,
the
managers
could
claim
efficient
administration
and
avail
themselves
of
thousands
of
dollars
of
taxpayer-funded
bonuses.
Meanwhile,
sick
veterans
died
while
waiting
in
line.
The
American
people
cannot
&#8211;
and
should
not
&#8211;
tolerate
those
who
harm
veterans
while
bilking
the
taxpayer.
My
colleagues
and
I
in
the
House
continued
to
take
action
to
ensure
that
our
nation's
veterans
are
getting
the
care
that
they
deserve
by
passing
Congressman
Jeff
Miller's
Veteran
Access
to
Care
Act.
This
legislation
will
allow
veterans
who
cannot
get
an
appointment
at
the
VA
within
14
days
to
utilize
private
services.
I
spoke
with
Neil
Cavuto
on
Fox
Business
on
this
important
topic
-
watch
the
interview
by
clicking
here.
I
am
happy
to
report
that
the
Council
for
the
Citizens
Against
Government
Waste
has
named
me
a
"Taxpayer
Hero"
for
my
record
of
fiscal
conservatism
and
protecting
taxpayers
against
wasteful
spending.
I
was
ranked
the
#1
taxpayer
hero
in
all
of
Florida
and
#5
out
of
435
members
of
the
House
of
Representatives.
I
will
continue
to
stand
with
taxpayers
against
special
interests.
In
fact,
this
week
I
passed
an
anti-cronyism
amendment
to
the
annual
Transportation/HUD
appropriations
bill.
HUD
currently
allows
businesses
and
municipalities
to
take
out
government-guarantee
loans
to
finance
an
array
of
often
times
questionable
projects.
When
these
projects
fail,
HUD
allows
the
business
or
municipality
to
apply
for
taxpayer-financed
grants
to
pay
off
the
taxpayer-backed
loan.
It
is
truly
a
"heads
they
win,
tails
the
taxpayer
loses"
situation.
My
amendment
blocks
this
type
of
scheme
and
will
prevent
further
abuse
of
taxpayer
money.
