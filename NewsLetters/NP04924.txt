Friend -- The latest
Louisville Courier-Journal
poll has Mitch McConnell&rsquo;s race against Democrat Alison Grimes virtually tied. Not kidding: 44-43.
This is the best opportunity we&rsquo;ve EVER had to kick the self-titled &ldquo;guardian of gridlock&rdquo; out of office and end his filibustering!! We could finish his career, crush Tea Party extremists, and keep the Senate blue!
But the bad news? In the next seven days, his dark-money backers will outspend Democrats by HALF A MILLION DOLLARS in Kentucky.
We CAN negate McConnell&rsquo;s spending advantage if we can mobilize voters who are sick of his do-nothing agenda -- but not if you don&rsquo;t act.
So, will you sit this election out and let McConnell and his cronies win?
Or will you pitch in so we can get out the vote, CRUSH the GOP, and push McConnell OUT? Donate before midnight and we&rsquo;ll triple-match it!

Or donate another amount.
The
Washington Post
calls McConnell&rsquo;s race a &ldquo;nail-biter&rdquo; -- it really could go either way. That&rsquo;s why EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR donated will be CRUCIAL.
It would be criminal to let this golden opportunity pass. Let&rsquo;s show the Republicans that we WILL NOT tolerate their obstructionism! Let&rsquo;s send Mitch and his buddies PACKING!
Donate today and you&rsquo;ll be supporting our HUGE Last-Weekend Get Out The Vote Push to BEAT McConnell and the GOP! All gifts triple-matched!
We&rsquo;re going to win this!
