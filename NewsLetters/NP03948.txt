Sign Up for Health Insurance by
December 15!
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is working in terms of access,
affordability and quality.
In just one year, the ACA has reduced the
number of uninsured adults by 26 percent.
During the first enrollment
period, nearly 7 out of 10 people who selected a plan through the
Marketplace found coverage for less than $100 a month with financial
assistance.
This year, new
choices and increased competition in the Health Insurance Marketplace
are giving Michiganders more affordable options during Open
Enrollment.
In Michigan, consumers can choose from 16 issuers in the
Marketplace in 2015up from 12 in 2014.
And Michigan consumers can
choose from an average of 64 health plans in their
county.
If you want to sign up for
health care coverage or change your existing plan, be sure to visit
HealthCare.gov and sign up for a plan by December 15 in order to have
coverage by January 1!
Through the
Federal Marketplace , you can sign
up for an affordable plan that fits your budget and health needs.
If you already have coverage through
HealthCare.gov , its time to come back and renew your coverage or shop around
for new plans in your area.
Be sure to enroll by December 15 in
order for coverage to begin on January 1, 2015.
Dont miss out on this important opportunity to
get covered.
Take a moment to review your options and find a
plan thats right for you.
If you have any questions about
enrolling for health insurance through the Federal Marketplace, please call
Rep. Levins Roseville office at (586) 498-7122 and his staff will be
happy to assist you.
House Approves Great Lakes Restoration Initiative
Act
On
December 9, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved legislation
by Rep. Levin and other Great Lakes lawmakers to formally authorize
the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI).
The GLRI was
created by the Obama Administration in 2010.
Over the last five years,
Congress has provided more than $1.6 billion for GLRI, which funds
restoration efforts in the Lakes, including cleaning up toxic hotspots;
fighting aquatic invasive species; restoring critical habitat; and
addressing polluted runoff that contributes to beach closures and harmful
algal blooms in the Lakes.
Formal authorization of the GLRI strengthens the program,
provides for regular congressional oversight, and makes it more likely that
future congresses will continue to fund the effort.
