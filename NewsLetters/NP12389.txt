Dear Friend,
By now there is a good chance you have heard about the Monuments Men of
World War II, especially with the just released motion picture about
their efforts to save, preserve and return five million pieces of
European art and cultural items to their rightful owners.
Honoring the Monuments Men has been an effort I have worked on since
2006 when I first learned about their story. It's an effort I am
continuing now with legislation to honor them with the Congressional
Gold Medal
.
In Fort Worth, we are fortunate to have a special connection to the
Monuments Men. The February issue of the Fort Worth, Texas Magazine
documents this connection. There is
currently a magnificent piece of art hanging in the Kimbell that was
stolen by the Nazis during the war. The unique part of this story is
that the painting - Turner's Glaucus and Scylla - was sold to the
Kimbell decades ago. The rightful owner of the painting tracked the
painting down and the Kimbell agreed to return it at no cost. The
painting was then put up on auction where there Kimbell bought it back
where it hangs there today.
I'm proud that Fort Worth is able to enjoy this unique connection to
this period of time when the greatest generation not only liberated a
continent, but saved its cultural history too.
Sincerely,
Kay Granger
Member of Congress
P.S. In an effort to build support around my gold medal legislation I
have hit the air waves to help show the significance of the Monuments
Men to world history. Here are just a couple of my interviews I wanted
to share with you.

Dear
Friend,
By
now
there
is
a
good
chance
you
have
heard
about
the
Monuments
Men
of
World
War
II,
especially
with
the
just
released
motion
picture
about
their
efforts
to
save,
preserve
and
return
five
million
pieces
of
European
art
and
cultural
items
to
their
rightful
owners.
Honoring
the
Monuments
Men
has
been
an
effort
I
have
worked
on
since
2006
when
I
first
learned
about
their
story.
It's
an
effort
I
am
continuing
now
with
legislation
to
honor
them
with
the
Congressional
Gold
Medal .
In
Fort
Worth,
we
are
fortunate
to
have
a
special
connection
to
the
Monuments
Men.
The
February
issue
of
the
Fort
Worth,
Texas
Magazine
documents
this
connection.
There
is
currently
a
magnificent
piece
of
art
hanging
in
the
Kimbell
that
was
stolen
by
the
Nazis
during
the
war.
The
unique
part
of
this
story
is
that
the
painting
-
Turner&#8217;s
Glaucus
and
Scylla
-
was
sold
to
the
Kimbell
decades
ago.
The
rightful
owner
of
the
painting
tracked
the
painting
down
and
the
Kimbell
agreed
to
return
it
at
no
cost.
The
painting
was
then
put
up
on
auction
where
there
Kimbell
bought
it
back
where
it
hangs
there
today.
I&#8217;m
proud
that
Fort
Worth
is
able
to
enjoy
this
unique
connection
to
this
period
of
time
when
the
greatest
generation
not
only
liberated
a
continent,
but
saved
its
cultural
history
too.
