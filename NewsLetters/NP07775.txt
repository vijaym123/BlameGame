Friends,
As the son of a World War II veteran, I believe it is of the
upmost importance that our veterans receive both the deep appreciation
of our country and access to high-quality health care. With stories of
rampant mismanagement throughout the VA continuing to unfold, the
reality of our heroes not getting the health services they need is
unacceptable to me.
It was an honor to meet many local veterans
on Friday morning during our Veterans Resource Day in Willoughby Hills
and hear their thoughts on what needs to be done to improve their VA
care. The best way to make effective, lasting changes at the VA is to
hear directly from the people who depend on its
services.
Im grateful to all the organizations that came together to make
Veterans Resource Day possible, including the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA
Medical Center, Lake County VA community-based outpatient clinics, the Lake
County Veterans Service Commission, Tricare and the Veterans Benefit
Office.
Our veterans made the selfless decision to stand
in the face of danger for us, and this week we had the opportunity to
lend a helping hand to them.

Other highlights from the
week:
The
Financial Services Appropriations
bill
for fiscal year 2015 passed the House this week and cuts IRS funding
by $1.48 billion, rolling it back to below 2003 levels. Americans are
disgusted with the IRS's deceitful games. Considering that it is one
of the most feared federal agencies, we have to make it clear that the
IRS's lack of accountability to the American people will not be
tolerated.
The House passed H.R. 4719, the
America Gives More Act , to foster charitable
giving. America ranks as the worlds most charitable nation, so we need to
ensure our tax laws support these acts of service. We know Washington
has a bad habit of not spending money wisely. This bill makes a number
of charitable deductions permanent so that Americans can choose to
spend more of their hard-earned dollars to help those among us who need
it most, rather than handing their money over to the
IRS.
