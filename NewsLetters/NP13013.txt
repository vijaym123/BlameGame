Senator Stabenow: Army Corps of Engineers on "Borrowed Time" in Dealing
with Asian Carp Crisis
At public meetings in the state this week, Senator Stabenow added her
voice to the chorus of fellow Michigan residents calling on the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers to more fully develop its proposals so that work
on projects to stop Asian carp can begin. Stabenow, author of the
bipartisan Stop Invasive Species Act, said, "Time is running out to stop
Asian carp from devastating our Great Lakes and the hundreds of
thousands of jobs that depend on them. We have an opportunity to make

2014 Appropriations Bill Funds MSU Nuclear Science Center
U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow and Carl Levin announced that the
appropriations bill Congress passed last week includes $55 million to
fund Michigan State University's Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB)
project. The bill also authorizes construction to begin this year. "The
research that will be done at this state-of-the-art MSU facility is
critical to Michigan and the entire country, and will create thousands
of jobs in our state," Stabenow said. "After the bill passes, Michigan
State will be able to start work on this project in the next few
months." FRIB will generate an estimated $1 billion in economic activity
for Michigan during the project's first decade, creating thousands of
jobs during construction and hundreds of high-paying permanent jobs.

Senator Stabenow Celebrates Success with Big Three at North American
International Auto Show
Senator Debbie Stabenow, Co-Chair of the bipartisan Senate Manufacturing
Caucus, toured vehicle exhibits for Chrysler, Ford, and GM at the 2014
North American International Auto Show. Sen. Stabenow championed the
rescue of the domestic auto industry and has authored legislation to
boost American manufacturing by retooling loans, providing clean energy
tax credits, ending tax loopholes for companies that ship jobs overseas,
cutting taxes for businesses that create jobs in America, and training
workers with new cutting-edge skills. "Manufacturing is the backbone of
our middle class and our economy, and that is on full display here," she
said. Since 2009, the Big Three have announced plans to make investments
in Michigan totaling over $8 billion. The auto industry employs more
than 8 million workers and has added 372,600 jobs since mid-2009.

Affordable Care Act to Cover Breast Cancer Prevention Drugs
It was announced earlier this month that most health insurance plans
will soon provide women who are at high risk of developing breast cancer
with free access to prescription drugs that help prevent the disease.
The Affordable Care Act requires most health plans-whether they are
employer-provided, individual market, or ACA marketplace plans-to
provide certain preventive services at no cost to patients. "Women at
high risk for breast cancer will soon get medicine to help prevent the
disease without a copay or deductible. This is another example of the
Affordable Care Act doing what it was meant to do-saving money and
saving lives," Stabenow said. The requirement will take effect for plans
that begin coverage in September 2014.
