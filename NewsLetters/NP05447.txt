Friend -- President Obama emailed you.
Elizabeth Warren emailed you.
Just about every Democrat has emailed you because it&rsquo;s the single most important day of the election -- the FINAL FEC deadline is in 11 hours.
Nate Silver reported this morning, &ldquo;This year&rsquo;s Senate election is close. Republicans have the clearer path to a majority, but it&rsquo;s a treacherous one.&rdquo;
The election is alarmingly soon -- just 20 days out -- and the Senate is ANYONE&rsquo;S to take.
Silver reports our &ldquo;ground game&rdquo; could help us SURGE: &ldquo;Democrats are investing more into it this year, and that could help them.&rdquo;
But tonight is our LAST chance to fund the Get Out The Vote Campaign that will be crucial to our win.
Pitch in before the final FEC deadline in 11 hours and we&rsquo;ll get our GOTV folks out in the field immediately. Triple-match ends at midnight!

If we don&rsquo;t raise another $200,000 by midnight, we&rsquo;re seriously worried that we&rsquo;ll lose this at the last second. But if you pitch in now, we&rsquo;ll go on the ATTACK -- and hand the GOP an electoral disaster on Election Night.
