Dear Friend,
As we prepare to observe Memorial Day, I first want to thank all our
veterans who have served with honor and sacrificed so much to protect
our country and our ideals. We owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude
that we can never fully repay.
I also want to share a few updates
about my work in Washington on your behalf.
Supporting American Manufacturers
This week, I introduced bicameral legislation
with U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) to
modernize decades-old Buy American standards and help create new
manufacturing jobs in the United States.
Instead of purchasing
foreign-made products that create jobs overseas, the federal government
should spend American taxpayer dollars on American-made goods to
support American workers.
Our 21st Century Buy American Act will help
rebuild our manufacturing industry and create new jobs by providing an
increased demand for American-made products from the federal
government.
It's time to bring manufacturing back to America and the
U.S. government should lead by example.
Additionally, on Thursday, the U.S. House of Representatives adopted an
amendment I offered
to the Fiscal Year 2015 National
Defense Authorization Bill that will strengthen America's manufacturing
sector.
The simple idea that American companies should have the
opportunity to compete for contracts being funded by American taxpayers
came from conversations with local, Rhode Island based businesses, and
I am glad it will help U.S. manufacturers produce and sell their
products, which are the best in the world to customers overseas.
Protecting Americans' Privacy
On Thursday, the full House voted to end the National Security Agency's
authority to collect bulk data on millions of Americans.
Bulk data
collection is an unreasonable government intrusion into the private
lives of American citizens and violates well-established and long
standing principles of privacy. As a member of the Judiciary Committee,
I carefully studied this issue, attended multiple hearings, heard from
top Administration officials, and worked across party lines to help
advance this legislation
. While this bill does not address all the things
we need to do to reform our intelligence gathering programs it is a
good compromise and an important step in the right direction.
Protecting Rhode Island's Economy and Environment
Rhode Island is home to a stunning coastline and this week I was proud
to support legislation
that invests in protecting and improving our
nation's waterways. This bill, which successfully passed the full House
and U.S. Senate now awaits President Obama's signature, authorizes the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to invest in improving the nation's water
infrastructure, including our ports, inland locks and dams, and flood
control projects. As our state continues to recover from the harmful
impact of Hurricane Sandy,these funds will help the U.S. Army Corp of
Engineers rebuild our beaches and protect them from future natural
disasters.
Putting an End to Boko Haram
On Wednesday, I had the opportunity to meet Deborah Peter, a young
survivor of a Boko Haram attack in 2011.
Deborah shared her tragic
story about her traumatic experience at the hands of this terrorist
organization with me and my colleagues on the House Foreign Affairs
Committee.
What I heard was both horrific and heartbreaking.
In 2011,
she watched the execution of her father and brother simply because they
would not renounce their Christian faith.
This week the U.S. House of Representatives sent a strong message
condemning Boko Haram for abducting more than 200 innocent young
Nigerian schoolgirls.
These actions are unconscionable and no child in
any part of the world should live in this fear.
Furthermore, the House
also committed the U.S. to working with Nigeria and all of our allies
in the region to secure the safe return of these girls.
That's why, I
support President Obama's decision to deploy 80 members of our armed
forces to Chad this week to help rescue these Nigerian schoolgirls and
ensure their safe return home.
As we all pray for the safe return of these innocent young girls, I
will continue working with my colleagues and our international partners
to achieve an end to Boko Haram's reign of terror and return these
girls to their families.
As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns,
call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at

Dear
Friend,
As
we
prepare
to
observe
Memorial
Day,
I
first
want
to
thank
all
our
veterans
who
have
served
with
honor
and
sacrificed
so
much
to
protect
our
country
and
our
ideals.
We
owe
them
a
tremendous
debt
of
gratitude
that
we
can
never
fully
repay.
I
also
want
to
share
a
few
updates
about
my
work
in
Washington
on
your
behalf.
Supporting
American
Manufacturers
This

I
introduced
bicameral
legislation
with
U.S.
Senator
Chris
Murphy
(D-CT)
to
modernize
decades-old
Buy
American
standards
and
help
create
new
manufacturing
jobs
in
the
United
States.
Instead
of
purchasing
foreign-made
products
that
create
jobs
overseas,
the
federal
government
should
spend
American
taxpayer
dollars
on
American-made
goods
to
support
American
workers.
Our
21st
Century
Buy
American
Act
will
help
rebuild
our
manufacturing
industry
and
create
new
jobs
by
providing
an
increased
demand
for
American-made
products
from
the
federal
government.
It's
time
to
bring
manufacturing
back
to
America
and
the
U.S.
government
should
lead
by
example.
Additionally,
on
Thursday,
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives
adopted
an
amendment
I
offered
to
the
Fiscal
Year
2015
National
Defense
Authorization
Bill
that
will
strengthen
America&#8217;s
manufacturing
sector.
The
simple
idea
that
American
companies
should
have
the
opportunity
to
compete
for
contracts
being
funded
by
American
taxpayers
came
from
conversations
with
local,
Rhode
Island
based
businesses,
and
I
am
glad
it
will
help
U.S.
manufacturers
produce
and
sell
their
products,
which
are
the
best
in
the
world
to
customers
overseas.
Protecting
Americans&#8217;
Privacy
On
Thursday ,
the
full
House
voted
to
end
the
National
Security
Agency&#8217;s
authority
to
collect
bulk
data
on
millions
of
Americans.
Bulk
d ata
collection
is
an
unreasonable
government
intrusion
into
the
private
lives
of
American
citizens
and
violates
well-established
and
long
standing
principles
of
privacy.
As
a
member
of
the
Judiciary
Committee,
I
carefully
studied
this
issue,
attended
multiple
hearings,
heard
from
top
Administration
officials,
and
worked
across
party
lines
to
help
advance
this
legislation .
W hile
this
bill
does
not
address
all
the
things
we
need
to
do
to
reform
our
intelligence
gathering
programs
it
is
a
good
compromise
and
an
important
step
in
the
right
direction.
Protecting
Rhode
Island&#8217;s
Economy
and
Environment
Rhode
Island
is
home
to
a
stunning
coastline
and
this
week
I
was
proud
to
support
legislation
that
invests
in
protecting
and
improving
our
nation&#8217;s
waterways.
This
bill,
which
successfully
passed
the
full
House
and
U.S.
Senate
now
awaits
President
Obama&#8217;s
signature,
authorizes
the
U.S.
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
to
invest
in
improving
the
nation&#8217;s
water
infrastructure,
including
our
ports,
inland
locks
and
dams,
and
flood
control
projects.
As
our
state
continues
to
recover
from
the
harmful
impact
of
Hurricane
Sandy, these
funds
will
help
the
U.S.
Army
Corp
of
Engineers
rebuild
our
beaches
and
protect
them
from
future
natural
disasters.
Putting
an
End
to
Boko
Haram
On
Wednesday,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
meet
Deborah
Peter,
a
young
survivor
of
a
Boko
Haram
attack
in
2011.
Deborah
shared
her
tragic
story
about
her
traumatic
experience
at
the
hands
of
this
terrorist
organization
with
me
and
my
colleagues
on
the
House
Foreign
Affairs
Committee.
What
I
heard
was
both
horrific
and
heartbreaking.
In
2011,
she
watched
the
execution
of
her
father
and
brother
simply
because
they
would
not
renounce
their
Christian
faith.
This
week
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives
sent
a
strong
message
condemning
Boko
Haram
for
abducting
more
than
200
innocent
young
Nigerian
schoolgirls.
These
actions
are
unconscionable
and
no
child
in
any
part
of
the
world
should
live
in
this
fear.
Furthermore,
the
House
also
committed
the
U.S.
to
working
with
Nigeria
and
all
of
our
allies
in
the
region
to
secure
the
safe
return
of
these
girls.
That&#8217;s
why,
I
support
President
Obama&#8217;s
decision
to
deploy
80
members
of
our
armed
forces
to
Chad
this
week
to
help
rescue
these
Nigerian
schoolgirls
and
ensure
their
safe
return
home.
As
we
all
pray
for
the
safe
return
of
these
innocent
young
girls,
I
will
continue
working
with
my
colleagues
and
our
international
partners
to
achieve
an
end
to
Boko
Haram&#8217;s
reign
of
terror
and
return
these
girls
to
their
families.
As
always,
if
you
or
someone
you
know
has
any
questions
or
concerns,
call
my
office
at
