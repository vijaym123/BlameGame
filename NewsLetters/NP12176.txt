Dear Friend,
In the last week, I was honored to be recognized for my record of
protecting our environment and I encouraged the Governor to expand our
state's Medicaid program and help the thousands of Tennesseans trapped
in the coverage gap. Keep reading to learn more.

Helping Ensure More Tennesseans Have Access to Quality Health Coverage
There are thousands of Tennesseans who don't have access to quality
health care because of Governor Haslam's inaction, so I sent a letter
to the Governor once again urging him to expand our state's Medicaid
program, TennCare. Governors in other states who oppose expanding
Medicaid like those in Arkansas, Iowa, and Michigan, have been able to
reconcile their concerns with the best interests of those they
represent-but Governor Haslam has not. I also pledged to help him in
the effort to provide coverage to those caught in this coverage gap in
my letter to the Governor, which you can read here
.
Honoring Leaders in the Fight for Civil Rights
Late last Friday, I attended the United Negro College Fund's National
Alumni Council Legacy Award Gala. At the gala, I was glad to accept a
legacy award on behalf of my friend and colleague in the U.S. House of
the Representatives, Congressman John Lewis. The award is meant to
honor outstanding individuals who have a long-standing record of
encouraging students and colleagues to realize their full potential and
have helped others find ways to achieve their best. I am honored to
serve alongside Congressman Lewis, a courageous leader of our nation's
civil rights movement, who is clearly deserving of this award and I
look forward to presenting him the award when Congress returns to
Washington next week.
Voting for Our Environment
I'm proud to announce that of all the members of the Tennessee
Congressional Delegation, I was awarded the highest grade for my votes
to protect the environment in the League of Conservation Voters' (LCV)
2013 National Environmental Scorecard
. It is an honor to be recognized by the League of Conservation
Voters for my record on the environment. If we are going to improve the
air we breathe, the water we drink and preserve our environment for
future generations, we must treat our planet with the care it deserves.
Doing so will also help reduce our dependence on foreign oil, lower
energy costs for American families and small businesses, and establish
a clean energy economy that will help create green jobs across the
country. I look forward to continuing my work on protecting and
improving our environment.
Building a Healthier Memphis
Among the many benefits of the Affordable Care Act is free preventive
care for services like mammograms that can detect breast cancer. A New
York Times story
noted that Memphis is "the deadliest major
American city for African-American women with breast cancer."
The racial disparity in breast cancer outcomes is deplorable, but we
can take steps to reduce it. A primary reason for the high mortality
rate among African American women is late diagnosis, when the disease
is harder to treat and has much lower survival rates. That's why I
launched my "Building a Healthier Memphis" series on wellness in the
Ninth District last week by hosting an expert panel discussion and
education session about this disparity and what we can do to address it
and improve outcomes for victims of breast cancer in our city. I'm
encouraged by all of the Memphians who attended the event to learn how
they can help improve their own health and the health of their families
and communities, and I look forward to hosting the next "Building a
Healthier Memphis" event soon.
Everyone in the Ninth District should know that provisions of the
President's Affordable Care Act enable them to get mammograms with no
co-pays or deductibles. Taking advantage of the Affordable Care Act
could help save lives in our city and around the country. And don't
forget that the open season deadline to enroll in health coverage for
this year at HealthCare.gov
is March 31st.
Fully Funding the HOPE Scholarships
Over the last 10 years, the HOPE Scholarship program that I worked for
20 years as a State Senator to create has been an outstanding success
that has provided $2.9 billion to Tennessee's best and brightest. And
while this funding has been critical to helping students attend college
and complete 4-year degrees, the HOPE Scholarship has never fully
funded college scholarships, as intended, because state lawmakers have
not allowed it to keep up with the skyrocketing cost of higher
education.
Today's HOPE Scholarships pay a smaller portion of college costs than
it did 10 years ago and, if Governor Haslam's newly-announced plan to
slash the first two years of HOPE Scholarships by 25% is implemented,
it will provide even smaller scholarships for freshmen and sophomores.
The first two years of college are crucial for students finding their
way. With scholarships paying a smaller portion of tuition, families
will have to pay more and students may need to work more hours while
juggling their scholastic responsibilities, making academic success and
retention of the HOPE Scholarship more difficult. Today's college
students are graduating with more student loan debt than ever before,
crippling their chances of economic success.
To ensure that HOPE Scholarships continue to help Tennessee's students
afford college and succeed, the program must keep pace with the rising
cost of higher education. But the Governor's newly-announced "Tennessee
Promise" actually cuts funding from high-achieving students beginning
4-year degree programs. I am extremely concerned and remain cautious
about any plan that would make it harder for our state's proven young
people to begin attending the best universities in Tennessee, or any
plan that places additional financial burden on schools like the
University of Memphis which are already struggling to keep costs down
and provide high-quality educations.
Rather than raiding the scholarship fund's excess to create a new
government program, those funds should be used to provide full HOPE
scholarships. Tennesseans voted to repeal our state's constitutional
prohibition on lotteries based on the idea of replicating the success
of Georgia's successful HOPE program which provides full college
scholarships. That promise to the people moves farther from being
realized with every new idea to siphon money from the scholarship
program. Once scholarships are fully funded, the excess funds would be
better used, as I personally expressed last year to Governor Haslam, by
raising the income cap on or raising the amount of Aspire Awards that
give middle- and low-income students who work hard extra help to give
them a fair shot at success.
Join My February 25th Telephone Town Hall
On Tuesday, February 25th, at 6:30PM CT I will host a telephone town
hall to answer your questions and discuss a variety of topics including
what Memphians can do to reduce the breast cancer outcome racial
disparity and how everyone can better take advantage of the Affordable
Care Act. I hope you can join our telephone town call later this month.
If you would like to participate in this telephone town hall on the
evening of Tuesday, February 25th, please fill out the form here

Emerging Leaders Sought from Memphis Area
The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has launched recruitment
for its 2014 Emerging Leaders executive-level training initiative,
formerly known as e200, in the Memphis area.
There are 15 slots available this year for established small business
owners in Memphis/Shelby County to receive approximately 100 hours of
free training and the opportunity to work with experienced mentors,
attend workshops, and develop connections with their peers, city
leaders, and financial communities.
Recruitment is now underway with
the deadline for applying continuing through March 21, 2014.
Classes are scheduled to begin in late April and will be held Wednesday
evenings at the Renaissance Center, 555 Beale Street, in Memphis
Eligibility requirements include:
having annual revenues of at least
$400,000, being in business for at least 3 years and have at least one
employee, other than his or her self.
As a part of the program, each
participant will develop a three-year strategic growth action plan with
benchmarks and performance targets to help their company emerge as
self-sustaining business that creates jobs and contributes to the
economic growth of Memphis.
Eighty-nine business owners in Memphis have graduated from the program
over the past six years of Emerging Leaders classes.
According to SBA
Tennessee District Director, Walter Perry, "we anticipate a large
number of applicants for the Class of 2014 as this is an opportunity
for qualified Memphis-area small business owners to benefit from a 'mini
MBA' curriculum that enables them to develop a growth plan specific to
their business."
To apply, go to www.sba.gov/emergingleaders
and complete the on-line application.
Ensuring Memphians Get the Tax Returns They Deserve
The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is too important for people to
overlook, and everyone who is eligible should claim it when filing
their taxes. But historically, eligible taxpayers in Memphis and Shelby
County have not taken full advantage of the program-last year alone, as
much as $70 million in potential tax credits were left on the table by
area taxpayers.
Memphians shouldn't pay more than they owe, and they should receive
every penny they deserve in refunds. That's why I attended the grand
opening of one of 15 new Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) sites
that recently opened throughout Shelby County to provide guidance and
advice free of charge to ensure that eligible Shelby County citizens
take advantage of programs like the EITC and get the tax refund they
are entitled to. Click here
to find a VITA site near
you to help ensure you get every penny you are owed.
Helping Memphians Get Covered
All Memphians should have quality health insurance and the President's
landmark Affordable Care Act is making affordable, higher-quality
coverage available to people who have not had access to it in the past.
Luckily, many who have been unable to afford quality coverage in the
past are now eligible to enroll in Tennessee's Health Insurance
Marketplace
. Please don't forget that the open season
deadline to enroll in health coverage for this year at HealthCare.gov
is March 31st. And if you do not have health insurance coverage,
you may also be eligible to save money on your health care premiums
in the Marketplace.
If you are on Medicare or your employer is offering qualified health
insurance that you are enrolled in, you're already covered and won't
need to enter the Marketplace for your health coverage. If you aren't
sure whether or not you should use the Marketplace to get insurance,
call the Marketplace Hotline at 1 (800) 318-2596, visit
www.HealthCare.gov, or call Tennessee's navigator, Seedco, at (901)
528-8341. You can also call my office at (901) 544-4131 or the
Marketplace Hotline to find out if TennCare (Tennessee's Medicaid
program) is a coverage option for you. If you are one of the millions
of Americans who need health insurance, you can sign up
for coverage for 2014 until the open
enrollment period closes on March 31st, 2014. Visit www.healthcare.gov
today to look at your options.
The Affordable Care Act is already working for families across the
Ninth District. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, 147,000 individuals in the district now have health insurance
that covers preventive services without co-pays, $3.1 million in
insurance premiums have been returned to consumers, and more than 5,000
seniors on Medicare paid a total of $5.9 million less for their
prescription medications as we continue to close the 'donut hole.'
Also, health insurance companies can no longer discriminate against
patients with pre-existing conditions and young adults up to age 26 can
now stay on their parents' insurance plan.
Many of the Marketplace website issues that have been in the news have
been resolved. However, the Marketplace website is only one tool that
you can use to sign up for coverage. If you are having trouble
accessing the website, please do not hesitate to call the Marketplace
Hotline at 1 (800) 318-2596 or visit the Affordable Care Act Navigators
at Seedco's Mid-South office at 22 North Front Street (Suite 900) for
in-person help. Seedco can also be reached by phone at (901) 528-8341,
and if you have any other questions, you should feel free to call my
office at (901) 544-4131.
United States Naval Academy Summer Programs
Each year, the United States Naval Academy invites more than 3,000
students to Annapolis, Maryland, to participate in its summer programs.
The Academy's summer STEM program, which is now accepting applications
here
, gives rising 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th graders the opportunity
to learn from some of the best college professors in the country and
work in world-class lab facilities. The Academy's Summer Seminars gives
rising 12th graders the opportunity to find out if they have what it
takes to be midshipmen by allowing them to experience the rigorous
academics, physical challenges, and student life at the Naval Academy.
More information about the Summer Seminar and how to apply is available
here
.
Helping Veterans Become Homeowners
Last year, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs helped a record
number of veterans obtain mortgage loans and become homeowners
. In guaranteeing nearly 630,000 home loans, the VA's Loan
Guarantee program helped more veterans become homeowners or move to a
new home than at any point in its 70-year history. Not only is this
great news for veterans, but it also is another sign that our housing
market is rebounding-and that is good news for everyone. The VA Loan
Guarantee program has some of the lowest foreclosure rates around and,
along with offering low interest rates, their loans do not require a
down payment from first-time buyers. If you are a veteran looking to
purchase a home, you can learn more about the program here
.
Grant Announcements
I regularly release a list of grant announcements from federal agencies
like the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, and others. These
federal funding opportunities are available to faith-based and
neighborhood associations, nonprofits and other community organizations
in the Ninth District. The announcements are updated regularly on my
website
.
As always, I remain.
Most sincerely,

Honoring
Leaders
in
the
Fight
for
Civil
Rights
Late
last
Friday,
I
attended
the
United
Negro
College
Fund&#8217;s
National
Alumni
Council
Legacy
Award
Gala.
At
the
gala,
I
was
glad
to
accept
a
legacy
award
on
behalf
of
my
friend
and
colleague
in
the
U.S.
House
of
the
Representatives,
Congressman
John
Lewis.
The
award
is
meant
to
honor
outstanding
individuals
who
have
a
long-standing
record
of
encouraging
students
and
colleagues
to
realize
their
full
potential
and
have
helped
others
find
ways
to
achieve
their
best.
I
am
honored
to
serve
alongside
Congressman
Lewis,
a
courageous
leader
of
our
nation&#8217;s
civil
rights
movement,
who
is
clearly
deserving
of
this
award
and
I
look
forward
to
presenting
him
the
award
when
Congress
returns
to
Washington
next
week.
Voting
for
Our
Environment
I&#8217;m
proud
to
announce
that
of
all
the
members
of
the
Tennessee
Congressional
Delegation,
I
was
awarded
the
highest
grade
for
my
votes
to
protect
the
environment
in
the
League
of
Conservation
Voters&#8217;
(LCV)
2013
National
Environmental
Scorecard .
It
is
an
honor
to
be
recognized
by
the
League
of
Conservation
Voters
for
my
record
on
the
environment.
If
we
are
going
to
improve
the
air
we
breathe,
the
water
we
drink
and
preserve
our
environment
for
future
generations,
we
must
treat
our
planet
with
the
care
it
deserves.
Doing
so
will
also
help
reduce
our
dependence
on
foreign
oil,
lower
energy
costs
for
American
families
and
small
businesses,
and
establish
a
clean
energy
economy
that
will
help
create
green
jobs
across
the
country.
I
look
forward
to
continuing
my
work
on
protecting
and
improving
our
environment.
Building
a
Healthier
Memphis
Among
the
many
benefits
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act
is
free
preventive
care
for
services
like
mammograms
that
can
detect
breast
cancer.
A
New
York
Times
story
noted
that
Memphis
is
&#8220;the
deadliest
major
American
city
for
African-American
women
with
breast
cancer.&#8221;
The
racial
disparity
in
breast
cancer
outcomes
is
deplorable,
but
we
can
take
steps
to
reduce
it.
A
primary
reason
for the
high
mortality
rate
among
African
American
women
is
late
diagnosis,
when
the
disease
is
harder
to
treat
and
has
much
lower
survival
rates.
That&#8217;s
why
I
launched
my
&#8220;Building
a
Healthier
Memphis&#8221;
series
on
wellness
in
the
Ninth
District
last
week
by
hosting
an
expert
panel
discussion
and
education
session
about
this
disparity
and
what
we
can
do
to
address
it
and
improve
outcomes
for
victims
of
breast
cancer
in
our
city. I&#8217;m
encouraged
by
all
of
the
Memphians
who
attended
the
event
to
learn
how
they
can
help
improve
their
own
health
and
the
health
of
their
families
and
communities,
and
I
look
forward
to
hosting
the
next
&#8220;Building
a
Healthier
Memphis&#8221;
event
soon.
Everyone
in
the
Ninth
District
should
know
that
provisions
of
the
President&#8217;s
Affordable
Care
Act
enable
them
to
get
mammograms
with
no
co-pays
or
deductibles.
Taking
advantage
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act
could
help
save
lives
in
our
city
and
around
the
country.
And
don&#8217;t
forget
that
the
open
season
deadline
to
enroll
in
health
coverage
for
this
year
at
HealthCare.gov
is
March
31st.
Fully
Funding
the
HOPE
Scholarships
Over
the
last
10
years,
the
HOPE
Scholarship
program
that
I
worked
for
20
years
as
a
State
Senator
to
create
has
been
an
outstanding
success
that
has
provided
$2.9
billion
to
Tennessee&#8217;s
best
and
brightest.
And
while
this
funding
has
been
critical
to
helping
students
attend
college
and
complete
4-year
degrees,
the
HOPE
Scholarship
has
never
fully
funded
college
scholarships,
as
intended,
because
state
lawmakers
have
not
allowed
it
to
keep
up
with
the
skyrocketing
cost
of
higher
education.
Today&#8217;s
HOPE
Scholarships
pay
a
smaller
portion
of
college
costs
than
it
did
10
years
ago
and,
if
Governor
Haslam&#8217;s
newly-announced
plan
to
slash
the
first
two
years
of
HOPE
Scholarships
by
25%
is
implemented,
it
will
provide
even
smaller
scholarships
for
freshmen
and
sophomores.
The
first
two
years
of
college
are
crucial
for
students
finding
their
way.
With
scholarships
paying
a
smaller
portion
of
tuition,
families
will
have
to
pay
more
and
students
may
need
to
work
more
hours
while
juggling
their
scholastic
responsibilities,
making
academic
success
and
retention
of
the
HOPE
Scholarship
more
difficult. Today&#8217;s
college
students
are
graduating
with
more
student
loan
debt
than
ever
before,
crippling
their
chances
of
economic
success.
To
ensure
that
HOPE
Scholarships
continue
to
help
Tennessee&#8217;s
students
afford
college
and
succeed,
the
program
must
keep
pace
with
the
rising
cost
of
higher
education.
But
the
Governor&#8217;s
newly-announced
&#8220;Tennessee
Promise&#8221;
actually
cuts
funding
from
high-achieving
students
beginning
4-year
degree
programs.
I
am
extremely
concerned
and
remain
cautious
about
any
plan
that
would
make
it
harder
for
our
state&#8217;s
proven
young
people
to
begin
attending
the
best
universities
in
Tennessee,
or
any
plan
that
places
additional
financial
burden
on
schools
like
the
University
of
Memphis
which
are
already
struggling
to
keep
costs
down
and
provide
high-quality
educations.
Rather
than
raiding
the
scholarship
fund&#8217;s
excess
to
create
a
new
government
program,
those
funds
should
be
used
to
provide
full
HOPE
scholarships.
Tennesseans
voted
to
repeal
our
state&#8217;s
constitutional
prohibition
on
lotteries
based
on
the
idea
of
replicating
the
success
of
Georgia&#8217;s
successful
HOPE
program
which
provides
full
college
scholarships.
That
promise
to
the
people
moves
farther
from
being
realized
with
every
new
idea
to
siphon
money
from
the
scholarship
program.
Once
scholarships
are
fully
funded,
the
excess
funds
would
be
better
used,
as
I
personally
expressed
last
year
to
Governor
Haslam,
by
raising
the
income
cap
on
or
raising
the
amount
of
Aspire
Awards
that
give
middle-
and
low-income
students
who
work
hard
extra
help
to
give
them
a
fair
shot
at
success.

in
the
Memphis

develop
connections
with
their
peers,
city
leaders,
and
financial
communities.
Recruitment
is
now
underway
with
the

continuing

2014.
Classes

Beale

three-year
strategic

performance
targets

their

Eighty-nine

the
past
six
years

Emerging

According
to
SBA
Tennessee
District
Director,
Walter
Perry,
&#8220;we
anticipate
a
large
number
of
applicants
for
the
Class
of
2014
as
this
is
an
opportunity
for
qualified
Memphis-area
small
business
owners
to
benefit
from
a
&#8216;mini
MBA&#8217;
curriculum
that
enables
them
to
develop
a
growth
plan
specific
to
their
business.&#8221;

Ensuring
Memphians
Get
the
Tax
Returns
They
Deserve
The
Earned
Income
Tax
Credit
(EITC)
is
too
important
for
people
to
overlook,
and
everyone
who
is
eligible
should
claim
it
when
filing
their
taxes.
But
historically,
eligible
taxpayers
in
Memphis
and
Shelby
County
have
not
taken
full
advantage
of
the
program&#8212;last
year
alone,
as
much
as
$70
million
in
potential
tax
credits
were
left
on
the
table
by
area
taxpayers.
Memphians
shouldn&#8217;t
pay
more
than
they
owe,
and
they
should
receive
every
penny
they
deserve
in
refunds.
That&#8217;s
why
I
attended
the
grand
opening
of
one
of
15
new
Volunteer
Income
Tax
Assistance
(VITA)
sites
that
recently
opened
throughout
Shelby
County
to
provide
guidance
and
advice
free
of
charge
to
ensure
that
eligible
Shelby
County
citizens
take
advantage
of
programs
like
the
EITC
and
get
the
tax
refund
they
are
entitled
to.

find
a
VITA
site
near
you
to
help
ensure
you
get
every
penny
you
are
owed.
Helping
Memphians
Get
Covered
All
Memphians
should
have
quality
health
insurance
and
the
President&#8217;s
landmark
Affordable
Care
Act
is
making
affordable,
higher-quality
coverage
available
to
people
who
have
not
had
access
to
it
in
the
past.
Luckily,
many
who
have
been
unable
to
afford
quality
coverage
in
the
past
are
now
eligible
to
enroll
in
Tennessee&#8217;s
Health
Insurance
Marketplace .
Please
don&#8217;t
forget
that
the
open
season
deadline
to
enroll
in
health
coverage
for
this
year
at
HealthCare.gov
is
March
31st.
And
if
you
do
not
have
health
insurance
coverage,
you
may
also
be
eligible
to
save
money
on
your
health
care
premiums
in
the
Marketplace.
If
you
are
on
Medicare
or
your
employer
is
offering
qualified
health
insurance
that
you
are
enrolled
in,
you&#8217;re
already
covered
and
won&#8217;t
need
to
enter
the
Marketplace
for
your
health
coverage.
If
you
aren&#8217;t
sure
whether
or
not
you
should
use
the
Marketplace
to
get
insurance,
call
the
Marketplace
Hotline
at

www.HealthCare.gov,

You
can
also
call
my

at

544-4131
or
the
Marketplace
Hotline
to
find
out
if
TennCare
(Tennessee&#8217;s
Medicaid
program)
is
a
coverage
option
for
you.
If
you
are
one
of
the
millions
of
Americans
who
need
health
insurance,
you
can
sign
up
for
coverage
for
2014
until
the
open
enrollment
period
closes
on
March
31st,
2014.

The
Affordable
Care
Act
is
already
working
for
families
across
the
Ninth
District.
According
to
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services,
147,000
individuals
in
the
district
now
have
health
insurance
that
covers
preventive
services
without
co-pays,
$3.1
million
in
insurance
premiums
have
been
returned
to
consumers,
and
more
than
5,000
seniors
on
Medicare
paid
a
total
of
$5.9
million
less
for
their
prescription
medications
as
we
continue
to
close
the
&#8216;donut
hole.&#8217;
Also,
health
insurance
companies
can
no
longer
discriminate
against
patients
with
pre-existing
conditions
and
young
adults
up
to
age
26
can
now
stay
on
their
parents&#8217;
insurance
plan.

United
States
Naval
Academy
Summer
Programs
Each
year,
the
United
States
Naval
Academy
invites
more
than
3,000
students
to
Annapolis,
Maryland,
to
participate
in
its
summer
programs.
The
Academy&#8217;s
summer
STEM
program,
which
is
now
accepting
applications
here ,
gives
rising
8th,
9th,
10th,
and
11th
graders
the
opportunity
to
learn
from
some
of
the
best
college
professors
in
the
country
and
work
in
world-class
lab
facilities.
The
Academy&#8217;s
Summer
Seminars
gives
rising
12th
graders
the
opportunity
to
find
out
if
they
have
what
it
takes
to
be
midshipmen
by
allowing
them
to
experience
the
rigorous
academics,
physical
challenges,
and
student
life
at
the

Helping
Veterans
Become
Homeowners
Last
year,
the
U.S.
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
helped
a
record
number
of
veterans
obtain
mortgage
loans
and
become
homeowners .
In
guaranteeing
nearly
630,000
home
loans,
the
VA&#8217;s
Loan
Guarantee
program
helped
more
veterans
become
homeowners
or
move
to
a
new
home
than
at
any
point
in
its
70-year
history.
Not
only
is
this
great
news
for
veterans,
but
it
also
is
another
sign
that
our
housing
market
is
rebounding&#8212;and
that
is
good
news
for
everyone.
The
VA
Loan
Guarantee
program
has
some
of
the
lowest
foreclosure
rates
around
and,
along
with
offering
low
interest
rates,
their
loans
do
not
require
a
down
payment
from
first-time
buyers.
If
you
are
a
veteran
looking
to
purchase
a
home,
you
can
learn
more
about
the
program
here .
