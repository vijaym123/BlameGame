Dear Friend:
Having just wrapped up another busy two
weeks, I wanted to provide you with a quick
update on some of the latest work I am
doing on behalf of Floridas Second
Congressional District. Also, if you
have not yet done so, please be sure to
connect with me on
Facebook and
Twitter
to stay on top of the latest news and
events coming out of Washington and North
and Northwest Florida.
Restoring Veterans Benefits
When the House approved the Bipartisan
Budget Act, I made clear my commitment to
doing all I could to restore the full
cost-of-living adjustments for our military
retirees. Thats why I am proud that
a bipartisan majority of the House joined
me this week in ensuring the federal
government does right by the heroes who
sacrificed so much in defense of our
freedoms by eliminating the current COLA
cuts. The legislation, which passed the
House by a bipartisan 326
90
1 margin, now awaits the
Presidents signature.
Volunteering at The Shelter
I recently had the pleasure of spending
an afternoon volunteering at the
Tallahassee-Leon Shelter, which provides
24-hour service to individuals and families
who dont have a home to return to
each night. As chairman of the House
Republicans' Anti-Poverty Task Force, I
have been meeting with local food banks,
job training specialists, and volunteer
coordinators for homeless and struggling
families across North and Northwest
Florida. I believe we must have a strong
safety net to help the truly vulnerable
among us, but our fight against poverty is
going to be won on the ground, by faithful,
dedicated men and women like the volunteers
at The Shelter. To learn more about The
Shelter and the great work theyre
doing to strengthen our community, please

Supporting Local Job Growth
As a life-long resident of Bay County
and vice chairman of the Subcommittee on
Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, I
was proud to announce this week that Panama
Citys Eastern Shipbuilding Group,
Inc., is being named one of the three
finalists competing for a $10.5 billion
contract to build the U.S. Coast
Guards next generation of offshore
patrol cutters.Eastern Shipbuilding
was awarded more than $21 million to design
its prototype for the new vessel. This
contract would be a tremendous boost to
Northwest Floridas economy and
potentially bring hundreds of well-paying,
highly-skilled construction jobs to our
community.
Recognizing North Florida Students
It was a privilege to personally
congratulate the 16 North Florida high
school seniors who were awarded college
scholarships by the Tallahassee Quarterback
Club Foundation at last Saturdays
Biletnikoff Award Banquet. These young
people
hailing from Leon, Gadsden,
and Wakulla counties
have
demonstrated maturity beyond their years by
overcoming significant challenges to become
successful leaders both in and outside of
the classroom.
Sincerely,
Steve Southerland, II
United States Representative
