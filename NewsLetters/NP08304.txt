Investigation
Continues into VA Health Care Facilities; Women Vets Healthcare Also Under
Scrutiny
The deeply disturbing news about the many
problems the Veterans Affairs healthcare system faces in caring for our
nations veterans has prompted a broad-based internal review.
I
am closely monitoring these audits, with particular attention to the
VA facilities that serve veterans in New Jersey.
I am
pleased that my office has not received any reports in recent months from
veterans or their families about excessive wait times or other issues at
either Lyons VA or East Orange healthcare facilities.
Nevertheless, the VA must ensure that all eligible veterans
men and women
receive the care they deserve in a timely fashion.
In
addition to solving the problems that result in excessive wait times,
the VA must also move quickly to address recent
reports
about inadequate care for our female
veterans.
There is simply no excuse for the VA not having the staff and
facilities needed to address the health care needs of all
veterans!
This
article , which ran in several area
weekly papers, conveys my commitment to making certain our veterans are
being treated right!
Administration Finally
Submits its Request for Defense Operations
Overseas
Yesterday, the White House finally submitted its
request
to Congress for funding for Overseas Contingency Operations
(OCO).
As chair of the House Defense Appropriations
Subcommittee, I have repeatedly asked the Administration to provide their
request on a timely basis.
This $60 billion budget request for
overseas operations is nearly five months late and cries out for
oversight.
In coming weeks, our Subcommittee will examine
this proposal in detail to make sure it fully supports and protects
our deployed warfighters.
And, given the gains of ISIL in Iraq and
Syria, continuing uncertainty in Afghanistan, growing chaos in Libya
and terrorism rearing its head across the globe, our committee will
expect answers.
Supreme Court Invalidates Recess
Appointments
In a rare 9-0 decision, the Supreme Court
unanimously ruled against President Obama in invalidating three
appointments he made to the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB).
The appointments were subject to Senate confirmation, but the
President attempted to circumvent the process by claiming he was using his
recess appointment power to fill the vacant seats on the NLRB.
The only problem was that the Senate was not in recess.
This
is a stinging
rebuke
to the Presidents attempt
to go around the Constitution.
This decision is a good start in
the effort to rein in President Obamas repeated efforts to expand
his power at the expense of the Congress and the
Constitution.
The President
shall take care that the
laws be faithfully executed .
The
Constitution specifically requires the President ensure that the laws of
the United States are faithfully executed.
It does not give
the President the option of enforcing only those laws with which he
agrees.
Neither does it allow the President to unilaterally change
existing law.
Over the past 5 years, however, President
Obama has failed on numerous occasions to carry out this basic duty, as
this
column
by George Will
enumerates.
To address this growing dereliction of presidential duty, the
Speaker of the House, John Boehner,
announced
this
week his intention to take the matter to court.
A copy of the
Speakers memo to the House of Representatives outlining his plan for
moving forward can be found here.
Obamas
Disastrous Iraq Policy: An Autopsy
The
Atlantic
has an excellent, even-handed account, of
President Obamas Iraq policy.
The
story
provides an historical review of specific dates and milestones and shows
the terrible consequences of his hands-off approach.
This piece
is well worth a read, despite its length.
Final
Salute: Len Soucy, Founder of the Raptor Trust
Len
Soucy, the
founder
of the Raptor Trust, a wildlife
rehabilitation and educational center located in Long Hill Township,
died earlier this month.
All of us who support the
Raptor Trust
remember Len as someone who made a
life of making lives better. Whether saving avian lives here at The
Raptor Trust, educating others on the diversity and value of wild animals
in our lives, or studying raptor populations so that we humans could
learn more about them and live better with them, Lens was truly a life
well lived.
I extend my deepest sympathy to Lens wife,
Diane, his son Christopher and daughter-in-law Jessica, his
granddaughter Leah, and to all those who worked alongside him to make the Raptor
Trust a widely respected organization, not only in New Jersey, but
also around the nation.
Salute: Lt. Col. Ingrid
Parker, Picatinnys New Garrison
Commander
Congratulations and welcome to New Jersey to Lt. Col. Ingrid Parker, Picatinny
Arsenals newly
named
garrison commander.
With
Lt. Col. Parkers appointment, Picatinny has, for the first time in
its history, an all-female command pairing.
Lt. Col. Parker will
be serving with Sgt. Maj. Rosalba Dumont-Carrion, who has been
Picatinnys command sergeant major since September 2012.
Lt. Col.
Parker was commissioned an officer in the U.S. Army in 1994.
Transferring to Picatinny from Fort Meade, Maryland, she brings a wealth
of experience to her new post at the Armys premier research and
development facility.
Salute: Donna Costello, Retiring
Denville Municipal Clerk
Congratulations and best
wishes to Donna Costello, who is retiring after 34 years of service as
Denvilles municipal clerk.
Municipal clerks are the unheralded
glue that helps to hold local government together.
With a
wide-range of duties that range from preparing the agenda for town council
meetings to establishing polling places for elections, they often dont
get the recognition they deserve.
Donna, whose experience
and expertise put her in the top ranks of municipal clerks in New
Jersey, said that one the best memories of her long service is being able
to assist residents and solve problems and watch them walk away
happy.
I salute Donna Costello for her faithful service to the
people of Denville and wish her the very best for a long and healthy
retirement.
Salute: Larry Ripley, New Rotary
Governor
Congratulations to Larry Ripley of Morris Plains
for being named the governor of Rotary District 7470, which includes
Essex, Morris, and Sussex counties, as well as Warren County and
Bernardsville.
Larry assumes his new office on July
1.
Larry has lived in Morris Plains for more than 40 years and has
volunteered for numerous civic and charitable organizations.
He joined
the Morris Plains Rotary Club in 1985.
Rotarys motto is Service
above self, and Larry has certainly embraced that ethic in his own
life.
