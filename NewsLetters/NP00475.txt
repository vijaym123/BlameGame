Recently, I joined over 250 Members of Congress in signing a letter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), requesting a delay in the enforcement period of the new mortgage disclosure rules that are set to go into effect on August 1st. You can read a copy of the letter,
here .
The requested grace period would allow the mortgage and housing industry time to adjust to all the changes, and to evaluate and ensure they are able to comply with the new regulations. In turn, this will help the industry better serve their consumers without tangling them in any potential confusion surrounding these new regulations. I will keep you posted.
Yours in service,
Randy
