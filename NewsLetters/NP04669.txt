A DAY TO HONOR
When it comes to our nation's Veterans, we simply cannot honor them enough. It's good to remember that as we approach Veterans Day this year. While we will officially mark the day on November 11th, each day is an opportunity to say 'thank you', to those who have sacrificed and served -- so we can remain free. On this solemn holiday, we join together as a nation, forgetting our differences, and remembering we are all Americans. Our country is safe and secure, because of the sacrifices these brave men and women have made abroad, and here at home. We, in turn, must honor them, by keeping our commitment to stand behind them, and their families, not just on the battlefield, but when they return home as well.
NEW JOBS
Congressman Emanuel Cleaver, II, announces a bigger and better way to create jobs
There are few things as exciting as announcing new jobs, but that's exactly what we got to do this week, along with Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, and several local leaders. The expanded effort will create some 1500 summer jobs throughout the Kansas City area for low-income, young people.
Missouri Governor Jay Nixon explains increased efforts for new jobs in Missouri
With the help of community leaders, local businesses and schools, and $4.5 million in Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) federal funds, the expansion of job and career opportunities is getting underway immediately. I am pleased our Governor is willing to spearhead this effort, and utilize these funds to pave the way for a better future, for a huge number of our young people.
FIRST SNEAK PEEK INSIDE IN LONGER THAN A DECADE
Congressman Cleaver joins in the 15th anniversary celebration of the USCIS National Records Center in Lee's Summit
The last time the public was invited inside, via the media, was in February 2000. But recently, that all changed. I was honored to participate as the United States Citizenship and Immigrations Services' (USCIS) National Records Center in Lee's Summit, opened its doors for a rare look. The exclusive, behind-the-scenes, media tour was part of the 15th anniversary celebration of the records facility. The National Records Center first opened in 1999 to store immigration files. The massive, underground storage facility now holds more than 20 million files, employs more than 500 people, and adds about a million and a half new files each year. Each file holds an immigrant's records and history.
MAKING BOYS INTO MEN
Congressman Cleaver talks with young men attending the High Aspirations Mentor Challenge
Helping young boys turn into responsible men is a high aspiration, indeed. Community leader Alvin Brooks and I recently served together as Honorary Co-Chairs of the High Aspirations Mentor Challenge event. The event is one of many efforts underway to support the mentoring of African-American boys, living in the urban core of our communities. There are many challenges facing our country, our neighborhoods, and our young people. The responsibility to guide them is a large and sometimes, daunting one. But as my mother used to say, "Just because it's heavy, doesn't mean you can drop it." This event stressed the importance of not dropping the ball, no matter how heavy it may seem at times, when it comes to making young boys into good men.
