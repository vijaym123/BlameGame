Friends,
By now it is indisputable that President Obama's promise of "if you
like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care
plan" under the Affordable Care Act simply wasn't true.
Thousands of Alabamians and millions across the country are facing
health insurance cancellations or skyrocketing costs. To make matters
worse, the disastrous roll out of the Obamacare website has made it
nearly impossible for those affected to search for alternatives.
Over the last few weeks, a great many Alabamians have called, emailed
or sent letters about the negative impact Obamacare is having on their
families. One constituent, Allyson Strickland, a homeschooling mom of
four from Dothan, wrote that her family's premiums were more than
doubling from $440 to $920 a month. Allyson was featured on Fox News
where Greta Van Sustren asked about her family's story:
Republicans and Democrats recognize the basic unfairness that has
occurred here, and good faith efforts to remedy the situation are
underway. Even former President Bill Clinton supports making this right
, saying in a recent interview that "even
if it takes a change to the law, the president should honor the
commitment the federal government made to those people and let them
keep what they got."
I appreciate Allyson sharing what she and her husband have gone
through. Now it's your turn, and I'm listening.
I want to hear about ObamaCare's impact on you, your family or your
place of business. Have your rates gone up? Has the plan you like been
altered or cancelled? Are you able to see your preferred doctor? Are
you pleased with your health care options under the law?
Tell me about it. Tell me your story so I can be a better voice for you
and push for positive changes in Congress.
Time is of the essence, and I'm optimistic as the House is expected to
take up the "Keep Your Health Plan Act"
this week. However, even though Republicans
and Democrats support fixing this problem, we are fighting an uphill
battle because this is President Obama's signature law.
That's why I need your help. The more we highlight specific examples
that demonstrate the real-life consequences of ObamaCare, the more
pressure we can put on the White House to accept commonsense,
bi-partisan reforms.

A Salute to Our Veterans
Veterans Day is certainly a special time to thank all those who have
served our country, as well as to thank our military families for their
sacrifice. But let's not let Veterans Day be the only time we remember
and honor those who have served our country.
On my Facebook page, I asked for Alabamians to share the names, photos,
and information about a special veteran in their life. One particular
story caught my attention, that of Sergeant David Cantrell and Lance
Corporal Adrian Simone, both Marines.
Adrian lost both of his legs as the result of an IED explosion in
Afghanistan. David, the commanding officer, responded immediately
applying tourniquets and keeping Adrian calm. After 16 months of
"grueling" therapy, Adrian regained the ability to walk, run - and even
dance. This photo was taken at Adrian's wedding in Montgomery where he
"brought the house down" dancing at the reception.

The Week Ahead
In addition to voting on the "Keep Your Health Plan Act," the House is
also expected to consider important legislation relating to veterans
and health services. In particular, the House is expected to consider:
*
S. 252
: The PREEMIE Reauthorization Act
*
S. 893
: Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living
Adjustment Act of 2013;
*
H.R. 982
: Furthering Asbestos Claim
Transparency Act, and;
*
H.R. 2655
: Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act
of 2013.
As always, feel free to contact my office
to share your thoughts on any of these bills or any
issue of importance to you. My staff and I work for you.

for
their
sacrifice.

let&#8217;s
not
let
Veterans

be
the
only
time
we
remember
and
honor
those
who
have
served
our
country.
