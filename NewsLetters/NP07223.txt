Urgent Deadline Approaching
Dear Friend,
As your Congressman, I occasionally send out email newsletters to keep you informed on my work in Washington and throughout the Metroplex. These newsletters cover a variety of topics ranging from district and community events to legislative updates.
I am writing to alert you that, due to U.S. House rules concerning communication before elections, mass communications to non-subscribers must cease for 90 days in advance of any election in which the Members name will appear on the ballot.
These rules still allow me to keep my email newsletter subscribers informed on how my office is serving them, as long as they opt-in before the period begins on August 6, 2014.
In order to stay up to date on important information, including my work on your behalf, I encourage you to sign up to receive my e-mails
by August 5, 2014 .
Click here
to sign up for my email newsletter.
I look forward to keeping you informed of my efforts to serve Texas 33 rd
congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Sincerely,
Congressman Marc Veasey, TX-33
