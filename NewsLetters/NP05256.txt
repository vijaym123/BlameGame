David Johnson
UNTIL 5:59PM: All Donations
Triple-Matched President Obama and President Clinton asked for your help.
Now until 5:59PM, we&rsquo;re making an emergency extension of the Triple-Match for today&rsquo;s huge ad buy deadline. Can you help?
Another shocking poll!
Democrats 44%
Republicans 41%
POLITICO (Margin of Error +/- 4.2%)
David -- we can hardly believe it!
This is the 2nd straight poll showing a dead-heat:
Fox News has us down 3.
POLITICO has us up 3.
Either way, we&rsquo;re within the margin-of-error.
Now, we HAVE to find a way to close this budget gap.
The Republicans are planning to kill our chances with a massive ad blitz: over $2O,OOO,OOO in just one week. Frankly, we can&rsquo;t compete with that.
That&rsquo;s why President Clinton emailed you yesterday. And that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re emailing you so early in the morning. We don&rsquo;t want to let this opportunity slip through our fingers.
**EMERGENCY EXTENSION**
