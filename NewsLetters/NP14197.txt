November 18, 2013
Dear Friends,
Yesterday,
Senator Kaine and I introduced the
Servicemember Education
Reform and Vocational Enhancement (SERVE) Act of 2013 , our second
bill to improve veterans unemployment. This bipartisan legislation
will improve the quality of educational programs for servicemembers and
veterans to help ease their transition as they enter the civilian
workforce.
The transition from active military duty to
civilian life can be tough on our servicemen and women, and we must ensure
that the programs we have in place to assist our veterans are effective
and beneficial to each individual. Over one million veterans have
taken advantage of the Post 9/11 GI Bill. However, many of our
veterans do not graduate from these programs, and the unemployment rate
among veterans who served in our recent wars remains high. The SERVE Act
will raise the standards of these existing educational programs to
ensure our veterans and servicemembers are effectively getting counseling
on the usage of their benefits to increase the likelihood of
employment as they enter the workforce once their schooling is complete. The
bill also establishes a new pilot program to facilitate the use of
veterans' benefits for employment or on-the-job training programs, and
provides academic or employment counseling throughout the process to
enable servicemembers the opportunity to be employed more quickly and at a
lower cost.
It is our duty to ensure our veterans are taken
care of as they transition into civilian life. It is my hope that
with better educational opportunities, our servicemen and women can take
their talents into the workforce, smoothly transition into civilian
life, and continue to help keep America strong. The improved
transparency and career counseling from this legislation will guarantee our
troops receive the training they need to continue to be successful in their
civilian careers.
The Senate is expected to take up the
National Defense Authorization Act this week, and I will continue to be
a strong voice for our nations servicemen and women, fighting so that
they are guaranteed the care they need and the services they
deserve.
Very Truly Yours,
