Remembering Officer Jason
Crisp
Click
here to watch WCNC Charlotte's tribute to Officer
Crisp .
Today at McDowell High School, the community honored
the memory of U.S. Forest Service Officer Jason Crisp, who lost his life
during a manhunt in Burke County last Wednesday. Officer Crisp and
his K-9 Maros, who was also killed, patrolled five counties and
demonstrated unwavering dedication to the people of Western North Carolina. I
was honored to attend the service and stand alongside Officer Crisp's
family, friends and fellow law enforcement officers.
The
funeral was a tribute to Officer Crisp's selfless service but also a
sobering reminder that the men and women who serve our communities are
at risk every day. Their family and friends expect that they will
return from work each evening. Sadly, some never return.
We
must pause and make sure we thank those who willingly put their lives
on the line each day to protect us.
