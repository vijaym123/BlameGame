Congressmen Lamborn and O'Rourke Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to
Help Regional Airports
12/1/14
Congressmen Doug
Lamborn and Beto O'Rourke (TX-16) have introduced bipartisan legislation
designed to update the eligibility requirements for Department of
Transportation grants that helps expand service at small and
underserved airports.
Small Community
Air Service Development (SCASD) grants provide much-needed boosts for
small airports across the country to pay for advertising and other
startup costs associated with new airline routes. These grants may only
go to airports considered small hubs or smaller by the Federal
Aviation Administration. The law authorizing SCASD stipulates that only
airports considered small hubs in 1997 are eligible for the program. The
grants typically range in value from $100,000 to
$900,000.
The 21st Century
Small Community Air Service Development Program Act eliminates the
current requirement that limits grants to only airports that were
classified as small in
1997.
Airports that would benefit from
the legislation: Colorado Springs, El Paso, Tucson, Louisville,
Reno-Tahoe, Will Rogers in Oklahoma, Tulsa, and
Guam
"I am happy
to be partnering with Congressman O'Rourke on this bipartisan reform
legislation. It is important that our aviation laws reflect the most
current status of our airports. The Colorado Springs Airport is a
fantastic facility that is making real strides of progress. My hope is that
this legislation is one more tool that will allow the Colorado Springs
Airport to continue its transformation and add more air service to
our
region."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
(CO-05)
"Thank you to
Congressmen Lamborn and O'Rourke for introducing this much-needed piece of
legislation. Having the ability to be competitive for SCASD grants will be
very beneficial as we work hard to increase service at the Colorado
Springs
Airport."
- Colorado Springs Airport Aviation Director Dan
Gallagher
