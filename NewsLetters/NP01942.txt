David -- I don&rsquo;t have much time:
The House is voting TOMORROW on the Republican budget.
If this atrocious budget passes, it&rsquo;d be a disaster for our country:
revives Paul Ryan&rsquo;s plan to destroy Medicare.
repeals the Affordable Care Act.
hands lavish tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy.
The bad news gets worse:
Now that Republicans control BOTH Houses of Congress, this budget could actually pass.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m coming to you. We need to raise $80,000 more before the vote tomorrow to show our Democratic strength.
Are you ready to fight back with me before it&rsquo;s too late? Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
True to form, Republicans will trample all over the middle class, all while showering huge tax breaks on the their ultra-wealthy donors.
We need to stop them&hellip; and quick.
Thanks,
Nancy
