Setting the Record Straight on Uninsured Under Obamacare
On Monday, Politifact Georgia, while "cutting some slack" for Barack Obama's failed healthcare law and anemic economic recovery, rated my claim that the uninsured are not being helped by Obamacare as
"half-true" .
Today, even as the President declared that "debate over repealing [Obamacare] is over," we learned the truth about its impact on the uninsured - or lack thereof. According to
research in Forbes Business , the uninsured are signing up at only half the rate of the most recent projections. The Congressional Budget Office initially projected nearly 40% of the uninsured would be covered, but now it is clear only a little more than 10% of the estimated 45 million uninsured people will get covered under Obamacare.
By even the rosiest projections, Obamacare's impact on the uninsured, after taking over of one-sixth of the economy, was underwhelming. But covering only about a tenth? Embarrassing.
Before spiking the football and declaring "Mission Accomplished", perhaps the President should reflect upon the true impact of his socialistic policies - increased costs, fewer choices, and less freedom.
