Dear
Friend,
I am writing you to share what I've been up to during this District
Work Week, and give you a look ahead at what's on the calendar for
next week in D.C. The majority of my time back home has been filled with
a roundtable at the state capitol for the "EPA Waters of the U.S."
proposed rule and a review of some of our casework requests here in the
office.
I wanted to share some helpful tips for your summer
vacation planning. My team has seen passport issues become more of a
problem this time of the year. Keep my office in mind when you're
planning a summer getaway-- you'll see why when you read below.
EPA Waters Joint
Roundtable
Thank you again to everyone who
joined the conversation on Monday. If you weren't there, review
this packet of testimonies and biographies of the
panelists . The packed house and standing room only really proved to me
that this is a unique issue for Arizonans.
The
EPA's proposed rule to "redefine" the "waters of the U.S."
under the
Clean Water Act
is a blatant overreach
of power from the EPA. Now that we've made it clear this rule is
something we're watching, j oin me in
calling on the EPA and the Corps to tell us exactly every body of water that
it intends to regulate.
The rule's comment
period is open until Monday, July 21, 2014. You can comment online,
here .
Can I help you with
that?
Summer is the season for
traveling-- most often away from our home state of triple digit temperatures.
If you haven't submitted the paperwork for your passport, or find
yourself in a bind when planning a summer getaway outside of the U.S.,
take a look at my website.
It is my job to be a liaison for you if any unexpected delays
occur. See how I can help with passport issues and
travel questions
and call my Arizona team if you have any questions; (480)
946-2411.
I
hope this email proved informative for you as
you wrap up your work week. As always, don't hesitate to reach out if I
can do anything for
you.
Sincerely,
Next Week's
Issues
