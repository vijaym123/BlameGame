Friends,
Great news! Over the past year,
unemployment has been rapidly declining
in
South Carolina.
Last month, our state's rate fell to 5.7 percent
from January's 6.4 percent. This is the largest one-month decrease
ever recorded in South Carolina since the data series began in
1976.
Horry and Georgetown counties saw unemployment drop 2.2
percent and 1.4 percent respectively from January to February.
These
are significant drops, especially during the winter season.
I
remain committed to seeing this kind of employment growth throughout
our
entire district.
On Friday, BMW
announced a $1 billion dollar plant expansion in the Palmetto State, making
the SC plant the largest in the world.
Since 1992,
BMW has invested $6.3 billion
dollars
in South Carolinas economy and put nearly 8,000 people to work.
While this plant expansion is not in our district, an investment this
large will have a ripple effect on our state's economy
and breathe new life into our manufacturing sector.

Looking to move?
It is my goal to attract
companies, like BMW, to our district, and I believe it is only a
matter of time before we see other large manufacturers relocate their
operations to our community.
I will do all I can to achieve this
goal.
If you hear of any companies shopping around or on the move,
please contact me or our Seventh District Economic Developer, Rodney
Berry, at 843-679-9781. Together, we can continue to decrease
unemployment and grow our economy.
JOBS Act Unveiled
The name plate on my
desk still reads Jobs, Jobs, Jobs, and last week, I became a proud
cosponsor of the Jumpstarting Opportunities with Bold Solutions (JOBS)
Act.
In order for our country to see more job growth and compete
globally, Washington must stop over-regulating our economy and
resources.
The JOBS Act aims to eliminate the regulations preventing
businesses from receiving loans from local financial institutions. This
legislation would also put our country on a path towards energy
independence by approving projects like the Keystone Pipeline and reining in
the overzealous EPA.
7th District Constituents Visit Washington
Seventh District Members of the South Carolina Bankers Association
and members of the South Carolina American Legion
Auxiliary stopped by our Washington office this week.
It was great visiting
with these folks during their trips to our nation's Capitol.
If you
are visiting Washington, DC, please stop by and say hello! We would
be happy to schedule a tour of the Capitol or White House for you too.
Call my DC office at 202-225-9895 for more
information.
It is an
honor and privilege to serve you and your
family.
Have a good
week,
Washington D.C.
