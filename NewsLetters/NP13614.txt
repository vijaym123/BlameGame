After decades of skyrocketing insurance premiums for many
middle class families, health care price inflation is now at its lowest

Tough new rules under the Affordable Care Act that ensure

Dear
Friend,
For
tens
of
millions
of
Americans,
the
new
health
care
law
means
access
to
affordable
health
insurance,
in
some
cases
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives. But
I
understand
there
is
some
confusion
about
who
is
and
who
is
not
affected
by
the
historic
health
reform
law,
the
Affordable
Care
Act.
Even
for
people
who
already
had
insurance,
the
new
law
means
you
now
have
new
protections
and
benefits
you
may
have never
had
before
that
can
never
be
taken
away
from
you.
I
want
to
make
sure
you
know
about
what
changes
are
happening.
In
Contra
Costa
County
people
are
already experiencing
the
benefits
of
the
new
law.
Many
of
my
constituents
have
shared
their
stories
about
how
the
law
has
already
helped
them
or
how
they
stand
to
benefit
starting
next
year.
Below
are
six
specific
examples
of
how
the
Affordable
Care
Act
is
making
a
difference
in
people&#8217;s
lives
in
Contra
Costa,
in
California,
and
across
the
country.
I
hope
you
find
these
stories
helpful.
While
there
have
clearly
been
inexcusable
setbacks
with
the
federal
Healthcare.gov
website,
big
improvements
have
been
made
and
more
are
being
made
every
day. And,
the
California
marketplace,
www.CoveredCA.com ,
is
up
and
running
smoothly
and
accepting
completed
applications
at
a
rate
of
over
20,000
a
day
at
this
point.
If
you
have
a
story
to
share
about
how
the
Affordable
Care
Act
has
helped
you
or
your
family,
share
it
with
me
here .
Thank
you. 105
Million
Americans
have
gained
access
to
preventative
care,
like
cancer
screenings
and
immunizations
care
at
no
additional
cost . Up
to
129
million
Americans
&#8211;
including
more
than
16.1
million
in
California
&#8211;
with
pre-existing
conditions
like
cancer,
asthma,
or
diabetes
will
no
longer
be
charged
more
or
denied
insurance. After
decades
of
skyrocketing
insurance
premiums
for
many
middle
class
families,
health
care
price
inflation
is
now
at
its
lowest
level
in
50
years. Children
with
pre-existing
conditions
are
being
protected
against
discrimination
by
their
insurance
companies
based
on
their
health. Tough
new
rules
under
the
Affordable
Care
Act
that
ensure
Americans
receive
value
for
their
premiums
or
they&#8217;re
entitled
to
a
rebate
from
their
insurer. 6.1
Million
Seniors
with
Medicare
have
saved
$5.7
