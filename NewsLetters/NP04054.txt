Judge's
Boarding Pass
Dec. 1 - Dec. 5
Click here to view the video
Our boarding pass is
printed and Im in the car right now heading to the airport. We just had
our last vote and passed the
FY15 National Defense
Authorization Act
by a vote of 300-119 ( See Roll
Call #551 ).
I am proud to announce that included in the NDAA
is a bicameral agreement that ensures victims of the 2009 terrorist
attack on Fort Hood are eligible for being awarded the Purple Heart,
along with its corresponding benefits. The Senate is supportive of the
House-passed legislation and is expected to pass the bill in the next
week and send it to the Presidents
desk.
The House passed the FY15 NDAA by a vote of 325-98 in May. The Senate
Armed Services Committee also passed a similar version. After a
conference by both House and Senate Members, the agreed upon NDAA was passed
Thursday by the House of Representatives by a vote of 300-119 and now
awaits passage by the
Senate.
Representative Williams and I took to the House floor yesterday to voice our
strong support for this provision.
The video can be
seen here .
This has been a top
priority for my Texas colleagues and me ever since the tragic attack
in 2009. I am relieved that the victims and families of the 2009 Fort
Hood shooting are finally nearing justice and closure. I remain
disappointed that the President has not taken action or fulfilled his promise
that he made to the victims five years ago. I urge the President to
forego any further politics on this issue and keep his promise by
signing the NDAA into law. The victims of this terrorist attack have
suffered long enough! The fight for the victims of the 2009 Fort Hood
shooting has been long and hard, but I am always honored to go to battle for
the men and women who serve this great
country
The NDAA would adjust the Purple Heart criteria so that our
service members and civilians, who experience an attack inspired by
terrorism, receive the appropriate awards and recognition. The language
awards the Purple Heart to service members who are victims of an attack
that was inspired or motivated by a U.S. State Department-designated
foreign terrorist organization. The provision would be retroactively
effective as of September 11, 2001.
Thats our boarding pass and
Ill see all you folks in Texas. I get back to D.C. next Tuesday for
another busy week.
