Dear Friend,
This week the House passed
legislation, with my support, to address the President's immigration
directive relating to illegal entrants.
Some key provisions of this
Bill include:
Prevents any funds to be used to carry-out the executive actions to grant
deferred action to
unlawful
immigrants
Prevents use of selective immigration law
enforcement
Increases the number of Border Patrol
agents and CBP Officers to its largest force in
history
Defunds the ability of unlawful immigrants to receive any
Federal benefits
Funds Employment
Verification (E-Verify) system
While these are only
initial steps to deal with the problem, additional action is being crafted
to update illegal immigration enforcement and border security.
Be assured that I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress
to address our nation's immigration crisis.
With my regards and best wishes, I
remain
Sincerely,
John L. Mica
