Speaking Out to Protect
Christmas
12/23/14
Recently on the House Floor, Congressman Doug Lamborn spoke out on
the importance of Christmas.
"Its the most wonderful time of the year. A time when millions of
Americans gather together to celebrate Christmas.
For many of
us, Christmas is a time to remember the humble birth of our Savior on a
holy night more than 2,000 years ago in the town of Bethlehem. We
give thanks for Jesus message of love and peace and remember the
sacrifice He made for us all.
It is a season of giving, of love, and of
joy. According to a recent poll, 9 out of 10 Americans celebrate
Christmas.
Sadly, however, there is a troubling effort in America,
by a vocal minority, to remove the symbols and traditions of Christmas
from the public arena.
There have been countless examples of
various atheist, and humanist groups working to public nativity displays,
and other Christmas decorations.
Just last year, in my home
state of Colorado, an anti-religious organization filed a lawsuit against
school officials for their support of student led involvement with
Operation Christmas Child, a Christian charity that gives shoeboxes
filled with small gifts to underprivileged children throughout the world.
These efforts by a small group offended by Christmas, violates the
freedom of religion our founding fathers provided for us in the
Constitution.
I have introduced a resolution to protect the symbols and
traditions of Christmas for use by those who celebrate the holiday.
The resolution also disapproves of efforts to ban references to
Christmas.
We must not allow those who choose to take offense to
shut down the religious celebration or acknowledgement of every other
American.
I urge its passage."
