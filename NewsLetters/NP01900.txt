Before the end-of-quarter FEC deadline in 24 hours, we&rsquo;re working to recruit our top Democratic supporters in all 50 states to renew their DSCC memberships and form the bedrock of our Back to Blue campaign.
David -- Before the end-of-quarter FEC deadline in 24 hours, we&rsquo;re working to recruit our top Democratic supporters in all 50 states to renew their DSCC memberships and form the bedrock of our
Back to Blue project.
Will you be one of them?
2015 Membership Rate:
$3
(renew now)
Deadline:
24 hours
Here&rsquo;s the deal: Our Back to Blue campaign to keep the White House, take back the Senate, and pass a progressive agenda has to start right now -- or the Republicans will crush our hopes before we can even get off the ground.
David, will you renew your membership before the FEC deadline in 24 hours?
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
If we start laying the groundwork now, we WILL elect leaders who will fight for the progressive priorities we share:
An economy that works for everyone, not just the 1%
Keeping Social Security and Medicare strong
Guaranteeing an unrestricted right to vote
A robust effort to combat climate change
Supreme Court justices who value fairness and equality
The GOP would love it if you sat out this fight. But if you do, Mitch McConnell, John Boehner, Ted Cruz, and Rand Paul will win. This is your opportunity to stop them.
Will you renew your membership before the huge end-of-quarter FEC deadline?
We can&rsquo;t do this without you. Thank you for your help.
