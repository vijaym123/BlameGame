Boehner: Illinois GOP will have the best year in two decades
David --
Boehner&rsquo;s putting everything on the line, barnstorming the Land of Lincoln to raise cash for GOP candidates.
Some reports indicate that he could be hauling as much as $100,000 per event. If that doesn&rsquo;t scare you, it should. Look, it all boils down to this:
if we&rsquo;re going to stop Boehner&rsquo;s takeover of Illinois, we need to go on offense. But time is of the essence.
David, your support today could determine the outcome of this race. Will you chip in to become a Founding Member of Brad&rsquo;s re-election campaign?
