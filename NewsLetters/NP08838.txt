Fellow Delawareans,
Last week, I traveled the state and spoke to thousands of Delawareans to learn more about Delaware&rsquo;s manufacturing sector -- I called it my &ldquo; Make It In Delaware &rdquo; week.
I talked to former Chrysler employees, current Hodgson Vo-Tech students, instructors at Delaware Technical and Community College, employers at PATS Aircraft, Agilent Technologies, and a host of others to gather ideas for how we can make more things in America and create more manufacturing jobs here at home. I visited Allied Precision in Middletown, Miller Metal Fabrication in Bridgeville, and Hirsh Industries in Dover and heard first-hand about the challenges employers face in finding employees with the skills needed to fill the jobs they have available.
I wanted to share with you
my take
on what federal manufacturing policy should look like, with a particular focus on how we can help Delaware manufacturers grow. If you have ideas about ways we can bring more manufacturing jobs to our state, I&rsquo;d love to
hear from you .
As always, it&rsquo;s an honor to serve as your representative.
