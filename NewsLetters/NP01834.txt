Dear Friend,
This past month, I joined Congressman John Lewis and other civil rights
leaders in Selma, Alabama to mark the 50th anniversary of Bloody
Sunday. Shortly after, I joined many of my colleagues to support the
Voter Empowerment Act.
After the Supreme Court invalidated critical provisions of the original
Voting Rights Act, I believe we must make reforms to ensure equal
access to the ballot for every eligible voter, modernize our voter
registration system, and take steps to eliminate deceptive practices
and voter fraud.
The right to vote is one of most sacred freedoms we have in our
democracy, so I want to hear what you think. Please take a minute to
answer the survey below.
Do you think Congress should pass a modern Voting Rights Act?
