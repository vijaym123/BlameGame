A Message from Representative Sean Duffy
April 20, 2014
Dear friends,
In nearly every town hall, coffee, or impromptu meeting across the
district people are always telling me that they are tired of the
Washington gridlock. My constituents urge me to, when possible, find
ways to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get
something done. This week, I was glad to lead bipartisan efforts on
several issues and am hopeful that by working together, we will be able
to get more work done for Wisconsinites and our country as a whole.
Keep reading for a wrap-up of the week that was.
Don't miss the forest through the trees: I led an effort with a
bipartisan group of 28 of my House colleagues urging the Senate Energy
& Natural Resources Committee to advance legislation that will increase
state and local participation in forest management, improve forest
health and give the Forest Service the tools it needs to streamline and
expedite timber sales and salvages.
The overall health of our national forests is integrally tied with the
industries that rely on this resource.The Forest Service must continue
to make a concerted effort to meet timber sale goals and Congress
should continue to advance reforms to assist in this effort. Read more
Our Veterans Deserve Answers: Following a delegation-wide meeting with
representatives from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to address
the on-going claims backlog, the Wisconsin Congressional delegation
expressed our concern to VA Secretary, Erik Shinseki, over the impact a
National Work Queue (NWQ) would have on Wisconsin Veterans.
While it is critical that underperforming regional offices are brought
up to par, it is also important for the Department to be
forward-thinking by building on the successes of those high performing
offices that have been selected to broker in additional claims. Read
more
Bury the "Death Tax": I also led an effort with 59 of my House
colleagues urging Ways & Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp to include
a full repeal of the estate tax, or so called "death tax", as part of
any tax reform proposal.
The tax punishes the hard work and savings of parents wishing to leave
behind a better life for their children and it seriously affects family
farms and family-owned businesses. This tax only accounts for around 1%
of federal revenue and we believe it's an unnecessary tax on America's
job creators. Read more
I will continue to keep you up-to-date with the latest on these efforts
and will look for additional opportunities to work with all of my
colleagues to ensure that the issues that mean the most to you and the
7th District are being addressed.
I hope this message comes at the conclusion of a great weekend spent
with family and friends. Rachel, the kids and I wish you and your
family a joyous and blessed Easter season. Until next week.
Have a great week,
Sean
