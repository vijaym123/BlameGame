David, here&rsquo;s the latest: October 07:
Boehner&rsquo;s Super PAC announces $1 million to viciously attack my progressive record. October 14:
FIVE different groups go on the air in support of reliable Republican Bob Dold. October 20:
Moments ago, one of Dold's billionaire backers upped his Chicago TV ad buy to a staggering $2 MILLION. I won't lie. This wave of outside money hurts.
We&rsquo;re facing incredibly well-funded operatives, and frankly, your support is my only hope for beating them back.
We can win this race -- and hand Boehner an agonizing defeat -- but we need every Democrat reading this to step up immediately. David please, stop what you&rsquo;re doing, chip in, and help keep the Tea Party agenda out of Illinois.
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
I&rsquo;m incredibly grateful for your support,
Brad
P.S. We have 15 days to go. Boehner&rsquo;s allies are trying to swoop in at the last second to win this for Bob Dold. The only thing in their way is you.
Please help.
