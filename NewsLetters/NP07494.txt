Dear
Tennesseans,
We are incredibly fortunate to live in a state in which companies
worldwide are clamoring to establish a presence. Many attribute it to
our pro-business culture, well-prepared workforce, low tax
environment, right-to-work policies, and engaged citizenry.
That is
why the
announcement by Volkswagen
to build its
midsize sports utility vehicle and establish the Souths first
automotive research and development center in Chattanooga was possible. I
could not be more excited about Volkswagens deepened commitment to our
state and for the thousands of Tennessee families who will benefit from
the high-quality jobs that will be added at the plant and at
automotive suppliers statewide.
I will never forget the moment in
2008 when I got the call from Volkswagen officials with news that the
company would come to Chattanooga. That call was the culmination of a
decades-long vision our community developed with the goal of attracting
a major, international manufacturing company to the city.
A
key reason that was possible was because of the foundation my
colleague, Lamar Alexander, laid with the recruitment of Nissan in the 1980s,
which started a process that has allowed Tennessee to become one of
the most important automotive states.
On July 15, six years
to the day since Volkswagen first announced it was coming to the
Volunteer State, we celebrated the news that the company will significantly
grow its presence in my hometown.
It has not been an easy
road. Over the past several months, you have watched the debate
regarding Volkswagens decision to expand play out in public. I know some
viewed the path we took as controversial, but there was no other road
that would have led us to this great outcome. I know it has been
challenging at times, especially for the workers at Volkswagen and for the
community, but in the end this effort that so many helped make happen
has and will continue to pay off in huge ways for
Tennesseans.
The number of jobs Volkswagen will add is far more than anyone
anticipated. That is in large part because of the tenacity and hard work of
our governor, Bill Haslam, and his economic development team.
Originally, we were focused on obtaining the second automobile line
the
midsize SUV
for production at the Chattanooga plant and a promise that
1,350 new jobs would be created.
Through Governor Haslams
leadership, we were able to move the dial and greatly expand
Volkswagens commitment by also securing the research and development center,
bringing the total number of new jobs from 1,350 to 2,000 and an
investment of $600 million in Tennessee.
This investment
hopefully will have a ripple effect that will make an even larger economic
splash in the state. A 2013 University of Tennessee study indicated that
because jobs in the auto industry have such a significant multiplier
effect, the original Volkswagen plant
which was employing 2,400
people at that time
drove the creation of more than 12,400 jobs to the
state, including 17 supplier companies that came to the area and other
Tennessee-based businesses that added new jobs because of the economic
growth.
We expect this investment to create thousands of
indirect jobs, helping solidify Tennessee as the place for automobile
manufacturing in our country.
There are few things I cherish
more than coming home every weekend to the community and state I love.
There is no place quite like Tennessee, which is why we are catching
the attention of so many around the world. I believe even more great
things are yet to come as we continue working together to bring
high-quality jobs to the state by making the most of the unique assets for
which Tennessee is known.
Bob Corker is a U.S. senator for Tennessee
and served as mayor of Chattanooga from
2001-2005.
