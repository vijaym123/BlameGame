Well this has been one of
the worst weeks that weve had in quite some time with the shooting that
has taken place at Fort Hood.
I have
been
trying to get the message out
to the rest of
the United States of America of the horrendous crime that took place in
our home town. I have been trying to get questions answered as to
what happened and why it happened and who is going to do something about
it. Im totally involved in this completely. It dominated my week
completely, however, in the process I had to keep doing my job. I held
hearing on various subjects, both in the Defense Department and the
Justice Department.
Today, during the
House Appropriations subcommittee hearing
on the Justice
Departments FY15 budget,
I demanded answers from
Attorney General Eric Holder
on why the 2009 Fort Hood shooting has
not been declared an act of
terror.
Attorney General Holder hid behind the fact that the shooting is a
Department of Defense issue and he would not comment and would not give his
opinion on the definition of terrorism. Chairman Frank Wolf asked him
to please be compassionate and help us resolve this issue by talking to
the President. He refused to say that he would talk to the President,
and instead said that he would talk to the Secretary Hagel at the
Department of Defense.
It was a typical
political answer. I am disappointed
in the Attorney
General Holders response, but will not stop pushing the Obama
Administration until the attack is declared an act of terror and the victims
receive the benefits they deserve.
Im
heading home today and I am going to the memorial service next week for
our fallen heroes from this shooting. This is a serious week, as
serious as it gets. Quite honestly we have a lot of questions that need to
be answered. Lets hope next week brings a little more brightness to
community. Right now its time for everybody not only in the
31 st
Congressional District, but in the entire United States of
America to
pray
for us. There are men and women who
were killed and injured. This was as serious as it gets. Thats what
this week was all about.
I am headed back to
Texas for the memorial service next week. I will be back in D.C.
