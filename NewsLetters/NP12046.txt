Friend,
It&rsquo;s an exciting time on the campaign&mdash;Ami is turning 49 this Sunday, March 2 nd
and with the primary election three months away, we&rsquo;re gearing up our efforts.
We&rsquo;re ready to go out there and win this election.
As we ramp up our momentum even further, you can now join me and other supporters in wishing Ami a happy birthday.
In honor of Ami&rsquo;s 49 th
birthday, a generous friend has pledged to match donations until Sunday, dollar for dollar, up to $4900.
That means that for every dollar you give, it will have twice the impact.
I hope you&rsquo;ll consider making a contribution of $4.90, $49, $490, or even more to help us maximize our friend&rsquo;s pledge.

Janine
