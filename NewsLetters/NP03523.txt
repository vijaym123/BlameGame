Hi Friend,
Thank you for reaching out to me this year with your thoughts and
concerns. Despite the gridlock in Washington, we were able to achieve
some big wins for the state of Connecticut this year. From job training
to preschool funding, infrastructure improvements and a new National
Park, I'm proud of what we were able to accomplish.
I put together this short video to showcase just a few of the
highlights from 2014. I hope you'll give it a look
.
Despite these successes, there is still much to be done in 2015 and I'm
ready to hit the ground running today as the new Congress officially
begins. I'm grateful for the opportunity to represent Connecticut in
the U.S. Senate and work on your behalf each and every day. I hope
you'll stay in touch this year and continue to let me know how I can
best serve you.
All the best,
Chris Murphy
U.S. Senator, Connecticut
