Dear Friend,
May proved to be a
busy month for us in Congress. Here is a quick update on what we have
been able to accomplish over the last month. Additionally, I have
included information on what we are setting our sights on in the near
future, and some helpful tips for you as you prepare for hurricane
season.
What I have been up
to
H.R. 3080,
the Water Resources Reform and
Development Act (WRRDA)
passed the U.S. House of Representatives and
the U.S. Senate with bipartisan support.
The bill passed the House
with a vote of 412-4 and the Senate passed the bill with a vote of
91-7. The President is expected to sign the bill into law
soon.
The bill includes an increase in federal support for deeper
dredging of our rivers, a key step in our journey towards a vibrant
Mississippi River with ports that can take advantage of increased
global trade and create more well-paying jobs. In the future, the changes
this bill made to the project process for the Army Corps of Engineers
could benefit important flood protection projects across the state,
including the West Shore Levee Project here in the 2nd
District.
I introduced H.R. 4618,
the Solitary Confinement
Study and Reform Act of 2014 . The bill seeks to start a
national conversation about the practice of solitary confinement in U.S.
prisons by bringing all relevant stakeholders to the table to explore
options on how to improve the system.
The current
practice of solitary confinement in our prisons must change and I look
forward to leading this effort to bring change in the months and years
ahead.
What to look forward
to
In the near term, I will be introducing legislation
which would
increase the amount of good time credits
available
to prison officials to shorten the length of time served by
inmates convicted of non-violent crimes that have demonstrated good
conduct and taken steps to acquire marketable job skills and
education.
Our prisons are overcrowded and they impose
significant costs on the American taxpayer. I am introducing this bill
because I think we should make smart reforms that will reduce the number of
individuals in our system while at the same time encouraging inmates
to acquire skills to join the 21st century labor force upon their
release.
Also, in the coming weeks I will introduce a
bill that allows the
United States Postal Service to offer
basic financial services , including checking accounts and
interest-bearing savings accounts.
More than 68 million
Americans (181,000 households in the New Orleans area alone) do not
have access to basic financial services. Without the ability to save and
borrow at a reasonable price, these Americans are forced to rely on
predatory lenders to put food on their tables. The USPS could offer
these services at nearly one-tenth the price of predatory lenders,
providing tens of millions of Americans with financial
security.
What is impacting the 2nd Congressional
District
June 1 st
marked the beginning
of
hurricane season.
In its initial outlook for the
2014 Atlantic hurricane season, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) predicted eight to thirteen named storms this
year. Three to six of these storms are expected to become hurricanes, and
one to two are likely to become major hurricanes . It is
important to keep in mind it only takes one storm for disaster to
strike.
I encourage you to take advantage of all
available resources and information to ensure you are prepared in case
of an
emergency:
