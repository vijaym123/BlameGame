David, I know the last thing you want to read right now is another email asking for money. But please don&rsquo;t delete this, because I really need your help:
Late last night, we found out a large right-wing Super PAC is launching a deceptive ad campaign against me.
We don&rsquo;t have all the details yet, but we can&rsquo;t wait around to set the record straight and get out the facts to Illinois voters. So David, I&rsquo;m pleading.
Please chip in today -- before it&rsquo;s too late.

Thanks,
Cheri
