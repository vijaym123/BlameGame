Social Security allows seniors in Illinois and around the country to retire with dignity.
That&rsquo;s why President Obama&rsquo;s 2016 budget protects Social Security.
But we can't let House Republicans cut this critical program.
They&rsquo;re unveiling their budget proposal as early as next week. We need to make sure it protects Social Security benefits for Illinois seniors. 50,000 Signatures Needed &rarr;
