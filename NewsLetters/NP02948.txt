I have long been a strong proponent for financial accountability in the Department of Defense.
To ensure taxpayer dollars are used in the most efficient, effective means possible, we need a full and comprehensive audit of the DoD. Its just common sense.
Additionally , a full audit of the Department of Defense would create an even stronger national defense , allowing us to better ensure that the agency is meeting its core goal of protecting our national security. Thats why I recently joined a number of my colleagues on the House Armed Services Committee in sending a
letter
to the Senate Armed Services Committee, urging leadership to commit to keeping the DoD on track to reach its audit deadlines in a timely manner.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. The need for fiscal accountability does not stop with the DoD. I have also cosponsored the Federal Reserve Transparency Act (H.R.24) to audit the Fed. Read the bill
here.
