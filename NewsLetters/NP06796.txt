I just need to say this: I&rsquo;m sick of Obama-bashing Republicans.
No President in U.S. history has faced the level of obstruction that Barack Obama has. And this month has been especially brutal:
-- Boehner&rsquo;s paying lawyers $500/hour to sue President Obama
-- More House Republicans are outright calling for impeachment
-- Mitch McConnell is threatening the President with another government shutdown
It&rsquo;s all absolutely outrageous. And if Republicans win complete control of Congress in November, it&rsquo;ll get exponentially worse. That&rsquo;s why President Obama emailed you. And that's why I&rsquo;m pleading:
we still need 8 donations from the 60659 Zip Code. Will you step up now and help us fight Republican attacks with the truth? ALL GIFTS TODAY TRIPLE-MATCHED!
