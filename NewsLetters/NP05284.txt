David -- I need your support. Here&rsquo;s why:
-- Right now, there are 32 Congressional races that are too close to call
-- But Republicans outside groups are outspending Democrats worse than ever The only way we can get our Democratic campaigns across the finish line is with a huge surge of grassroots support.
If you believe that we need folks in Congress who will fight for you -- not just those at the top -- then I need you to do your part before the deadline.
