Congressman
Steve Stockman
Representing the 36th District
April 28, 2014
Stockman seeks to strip U.N. funding over any anti-gun rights treaty
WASHINGTON
Congressman Stockman is moving to block any potential or future
attempt by the United Nations to restrict gun ownership with H.R. 575, the
Second Amendment Protection Act of
2013.
Treaties like the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty still pose a
threat to our national sovereignty and the Second Amendment. My bill is
absolutely necessary in preventing such treaties from being ratified
and further limiting our constitutional right to keep and bear arms,
said Congressman Stockman. The U.N. has no right to infringe upon our
nations gun rights.
If
enacted, this bill would ensure that Congress does not adopt any treaties
that violate our national sovereignty and any Americans
constitutional rights. In addition, this bill would strip any funding to the
United Nations if the United Nations restricts or infringes upon the right
to keep and bear arms.
It has
been referred to the House Foreign Affairs committee and has received
two co-sponsorships from Congressmen Charles Boustany (R-LA) and Rob
Bishop (R-UT).
