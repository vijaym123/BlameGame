Supporting Women Leaders in Agriculture
In North Dakota, agriculture impacts everybody's life in one way or
another, supporting our state's economy, providing food for our dinner
tables, and serving as a way of life for thousands of North Dakotans.
Women are increasingly involved in every aspect of agriculture, not
just farm work, and many are taking proactive roles in the industry -
running the businesses and overseeing the work of their farms.
In Fargo last week with USDA Deputy Secretary Harden, Senator
Klobuchar, and women leaders in agriculture
Last week, I brought U.S. Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Krysta Harden
to Fargo to speak with women leaders in agriculture from the area about
ways to improve outreach, address challenges, empower women, and help
promote more female leadership in the agricultural industry,
particularly in North Dakota, and U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar from
Minnesota joined us. We know women are great leaders in agriculture. We
excel in roles in laboratories as scientists, in executive board rooms,
and on our farms and ranches heading the operation or as veterinarians
and conservationists. And we generate nearly $13 billion in annual
agricultural sales throughout the U.S., including $136 million in North
Dakota alone. But while women make up 30 percent of our nation's
principal farm operators, that number is only 10 percent in North
Dakota, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) -
numbers we need to improve in our state and nationwide.
During Deputy Secretary Harden's visit last week, we heard how women
need to step up, take credit for their work, and jump in the ring.
Vanessa Kummer is a soybean, corn, wheat, and sugar beet farmer in
Colfax and we toured her farm to hear what it's like to be a woman
farmer in North Dakota. She's doing great work in Richland County, but
we need more women like Vanessa to take on this mantle and get involved
in agriculture in counties across our state - an effort we can advance
together.
Visiting Vanessa Kummer's farm last week in Colfax
USDA recently created the Women in Agriculture Mentoring Network to
help grow
the number of women leaders in agriculture. If you or
someone you know is interested in learning more about this exciting new
program, send a note to agwomenlead@usda.gov.
Now is the time for women to take that next step in their agricultural
careers, and by coming together and making sure they get the support
and resources they need to succeed, we can continue to feed families in
North Dakota and around the world generations into the future.
