David, we&rsquo;re out of people to email you. This weekend alone ...
-- President Obama
-- Nancy Pelosi
-- Debbie Wasserman Schultz
-- and James Carville
... have all asked you to fight the Republican ad blitz. IT&rsquo;S THAT CRITICAL. They know we&rsquo;re drowning. And that we&rsquo;re nearly out of time
The federal fundraising deadline hits at midnight. And we&rsquo;re STILL falling short. At this point, we&rsquo;ll need 21,273 donations in the next 11 hours to catch up. Please -- chip in whatever you can to President Obama&rsquo;s call-to-action immediately. MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: ALL GIFTS TRIPLE-MATCHED! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
