Dear Friend:
After spending a wonderful afternoon
honoring our veterans at parades in Panama
City and Callaway, I wanted to take this
opportunity to wish all of North and
Northwest Floridas heroes a Happy
Veterans Day.
If you served in the U.S. Armed Forces,
thank you for your service. Your commitment
to selfless sacrifice is an inspiration to
those of us who enjoy the freedoms you helped
protect. I have had the great privilege of
meeting with Florida veterans from each
American war since World War II to record
their personal stories in the Library of
Congress. I hope you will
click here
to learn more about the Veterans History
Project
and consider contributing your
own story for the benefit of future
generations. It's a pretty simple
process, but it will leave a big mark on our
nation's history.
If you havent served but know a
veteran in your family or your community who
has, let them know how much their service
means to you
not just once a year,
but every chance you get. And please join me
in lifting a prayer for the brave men and
women in uniform who carry on this legacy
today.
Thank you, and God bless. Sincerely,
Steve Southerland, II
United States Representative
