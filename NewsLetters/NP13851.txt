Dear Friend,
Today, I write to wish you and your family a happy
and healthy Thanksgiving!
I remain thankful for the opportunity
to serve the constituents of Louisiana's 2nd Congressional District.
As a nation, we are confronted with many challenges daily. However, we
have not lost our resolve to work to overcome them.
One pressing
issue at the forefront of my mind is the countrys fiscal position
and the need to find a solution that protects Louisianas families and
the vital services you, your family, and our neighbors rely on.
Please know that I am thankful for your support and I will continue to
work to find common ground that allows us to achieve our fiscal goals
as soon as possible.
Wishing you and your loved ones a happy
Thanksgiving filled with good food, much laughter and wonderful
memories.
Sincerely,
Congressman Cedric
