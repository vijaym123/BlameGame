A Promise this Veterans Day
President Teddy Roosevelt told an audience of veterans in 1903 that "A
man who is good enough to shed his blood for his country is good enough
to be given a square deal afterwards." To this day, it remains our
responsibility as a nation to make sure that when servicemembers return
home, they get the support and services they bravely earned.
Many, however, simply don't feel as connected as they should to the
places they call home - a particular challenge for veterans living in
rural communities in remote areas, including for many Native American
veterans.
Five months ago in Bismarck, I held my first Native American Veterans
Summit to talk candidly about the challenges these veterans are
confronted with on a daily basis. From poor communication between
federal agencies to prohibitive travel times for veterans to simply get
to VA health care facilities, the honest, six-hour conversation was
eye-opening for many in the room that day. And I knew right away that
Native veterans weren't alone. Similar challenges impact veterans
across North Dakota.
To offer some solutions to these issues,
this past summer, I introduced my Connect with Veterans Act. When I
started writing this bill, I wanted to find a way to make sure our
nation's veterans had better access to programs, benefits, and services
so they can find opportunities, support groups, jobs, and other
resources in their communities. My bill aims to help communities
connect veterans with employers looking to hire veterans in their area,
educational programs, and important health care services.
Earlier this year, I helped Northern Industrial Training, a
Dickinson-based company that trains and employs veterans, get the funds
it needed through the Post 9/11 GI Bill to complete its trainings. By
partnering with the federal Hero 2 Hired program and its North Dakota
coordinator, we were able to help returning veterans earn their
commercial driver licenses - which can cost thousands of dollars - and
find truck-driving jobs in the Bakken. No longer did they have to worry
about putting food on the table for their families. Using my bill, I
hope to make more stories like this one possible by bringing veterans,
communities, and resources together more easily.
When we think about those who have put their lives on the line for our
country around this Veterans Day, let's do so with a renewed commitment
that not only expresses our deep gratitude, but also reaffirms a
promise we should all keep together - to never leave our fellow man or
woman behind.

A
Promise
this
Veterans
Day
President
Teddy
Roosevelt
told
an
audience
of
veterans
in
1903
that
"A
man
who
is
good
enough
to
shed
his
blood
for
his
country
is
good
enough
to
be
given
a
square
deal
afterwards."
To
this
day,
it
remains
our
responsibility
as
a
nation
to
make
sure
that
when
servicemembers
return
home,
they
get
the
support
and
services
they
bravely
earned.
Many,
however,
simply
don't
feel
as
connected
as
they
should
to
the
places
they
call
home
-
a
particular
challenge
for
veterans
living
in
rural
communities
in
remote
areas,
including
for
many
Native
American
veterans.
Five
months
ago
in
Bismarck,
I
held
my
first
Native
American
Veterans
Summit
to
talk
candidly
about
the
challenges
these
veterans
are
confronted
with
on
a
daily
basis.
From
poor
communication
between
federal
agencies
to
prohibitive
travel
times
for
veterans
to
simply
get
to
VA
health
care
facilities,
the
honest,
six-hour
conversation
was
eye-opening
for
many
in
the
room
that
day.
And
I
knew
right
away
that
Native
veterans
weren't
alone.
Similar
challenges
impact
veterans
across
North
Dakota.
To
offer
some
solutions
to
these
issues,
this
past
summer,
I
introduced
my
Connect
with
Veterans
Act .
When
I
started
writing
this
bill,
I
wanted
to
find
a
way
to
make
sure
our
nation's
veterans
had
better
access
to
programs,
benefits,
and
services
so
they
can
find
opportunities,
support
groups,
jobs,
and
other
resources
in
their
communities.
My
bill
aims
to
help
communities
connect
veterans
with
employers
looking
to
hire
veterans
in
their
area,
educational
programs,
and
important
health
care
services.
Earlier
this
year,
I
helped
Northern
Industrial
Training,
a
Dickinson-based
company
that
trains
and
employs
veterans,
get
the
funds
it
needed
through
the
Post
9/11
GI
Bill
to
complete
its
trainings.
By
partnering
with
the
federal
Hero
2
Hired
program
and
its
North
Dakota
coordinator,
we
were
able
to
help
returning
veterans
earn
their
commercial
driver
licenses
-
which
can
cost
thousands
of
dollars
-
and
find
truck-driving
jobs
in
the
Bakken.
No
longer
did
they
have
to
worry
about
putting
food
on
the
table
for
their
families.
Using
my
bill,
I
hope
to
make
more
stories
like
this
one
possible
by
bringing
veterans,
communities,
and
resources
together
more
easily.
When
we
think
about
those
who
have
put
their
lives
on
the
line
for
our
country
around
this
Veterans
Day,
let's
do
so
with
a
renewed
commitment
that
not
only
expresses
our
deep
gratitude,
but
also
reaffirms
a
promise
we
should
all
keep
together
-
to
never
leave
our
fellow
man
or
woman
behind.
