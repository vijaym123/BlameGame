Friend -- We&rsquo;ve been emailing you again and again and again.
Here&rsquo;s the reason: What GRASSROOTS supporters do now will decide whether we win the Senate in eight days.
Grassroots Democrats have kept us toe-to-toe with GOP billionaires, but now the Kochs and their buddies are coming out in full force and outspending us by $5 million in the final stretch.
Can we stop them?? Here&rsquo;s the answer:
If YOU step up, we&rsquo;ll be able to erase the Republican spending advantage, answer every single attack, and DASH the GOP&rsquo;s Senate takeover hopes for good.
But if you don&rsquo;t help and these attacks go unanswered, Mitch McConnell will be leading a Republican Senate. We can&rsquo;t let that happen.
