&ldquo;Now Dold wants revenge, and his cash-flush conservative supporters are hell-bent on flipping the district back to red.&rdquo; -- NBC Chicago
David --
Since we last emailed you, an out-of-state billionaire dropped $2 MILLION on Chicagoland T.V. to pump up Bob Dold&rsquo;s campaign.
David, there&rsquo;s only 15 days left. If we can&rsquo;t close the gap and get out the facts, Brad will lose. It&rsquo;s simple as that.
RAPID RESPONSE: Will you rush $5 or more to help us get out the facts to Illinois voters?
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
When we win this election, it&rsquo;ll be because of what you did in moments like this. Chip in $5 or more right now:
