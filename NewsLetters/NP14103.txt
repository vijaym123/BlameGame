Week in Review
This year, only
three schools in Arkansas were named 2013 National Blue Ribbon Schools of
Excellence , and Bergman Elementary was one of them!
This
Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Education celebrated the Blue Ribbon
honorees, and I enjoyed seeing Ms. Richey, Ms. Curtis, Ms. Atkinson, and Ms.
Adams from Bergman who came to Washington for the ceremony.
Congratulations to Bergman and keep up the hard work!
Mat Pitsch, Executive Director of the Western Arkansas
Regional Intermodal Transportation Authority, Ivey Owen, Executive
Director of the Fort Chaffee Redevelopment Authority,
and U of A
Professor Kevin Hall were also in our nations capital to voice
Arkansass infrastructure needs and just how vital infrastructure investments
are for the continued growth of our state's economy.
On Wednesday, the House passed
H.R. 1965 , the
Federal Lands Jobs and Energy Security Act of 2013.
H.R. 1965
streamlines the leasing process for onshore oil and natural gas projects on
federal lands.
The House also passed
H.R.
2728 , the Protecting States Rights to Promote American Energy
Security Act.
H.R. 2728protects a states right to regulate
hydraulic fracturing by prohibiting the Department of the Interior from
enforcing any federal regulations governing hydraulic fracturing in a
state that has its own regulations and on lands held in trust or
restricted status for the benefit of Indians without express
consent.
On Thursday, the House passed
H.R. 1900 ,
the Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform Act.
H.R. 1900
expedites the federal review process for natural gas pipeline applications
by requiring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to approve
or deny a pipeline certificate within one year of receiving a
complete application.
The production of affordable American energy supplies
is driving job creation and fueling the growth of other major sectors
of economy, especially in Arkansas, a leader in natural gas
production and fracking innovation.
Im proud to have supported these
bills, and I will continue to support policies to remove barriers to
domestic energy production and stop harmful regulations from driving up
energy costs.
With the right policies
and policies like these
in place, I believe we can achieve the goal of American energy
independence.
I'd thank all of the Arkansans who visited my office
this week, including the Arkansas Medical Society, U of As Partners
for Inclusive Communities, Arkansas Developmental Center for Children
and Families, Inc., Shelley Myers with Independent Case Management,
Inc., Sunshine Barrett with the Arkansas Human Resource Association, and
Hannah Jeppsen from Fayetteville.
Safe travels back
home.
