Dear Friend,
I have always taken pride in what I view as a common sense approach to governing &#8211; I value pragmatism over partisanship and reason over rhetoric. So last week, I was especially humbled to receive one of the top
awards in the Intelligence Community for my bipartisan leadership of the House Intelligence Committee over the last four years.
Receiving the &#8220;William Oliver Baker Award&#8221; from the nonprofit, nonpartisan Intelligence and National Security Alliance was especially meaningful because I was chosen along with former Committee Chairman Mike
Rogers, a Republican, as the group&#8217;s first co-recipients in more than 30 years. We were thrilled to join the ranks of former Baker honorees from both sides of the political aisle including Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former Defense Secretaries
Leon Panetta and Robert Gates and former CIA and NSA Director General Michael Hayden.
Mike and I decided early on that, when it comes to the security of our nation, there is no room for party politics. During our four years together at the committee&#8217;s helm, we were able to pass five budget authorization
bills, twice pass landmark cybersecurity legislation and ushered a bipartisan bill to end the bulk collection of phone data through the House.
I accepted the award Friday in front of 750 people including my family, friends and staff. I encourage you to visit the
