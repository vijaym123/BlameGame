Rubio Comments On New ObamaCare Fire
Sale
Marco issued the following statement
regarding reports about the Obama
administrations announcement that it
will offer hardship exemptions for
Americans whose health care plans have been
cancelled under ObamaCare:
The Administration is
recognizing the grim reality that more
Americans have lost health insurance than
gained it under ObamaCare. Holding a fire
sale of cheap insurance is not a
responsible fix for a broken program.
This is a slap in the face to the
thousands of Americans who have already
purchased expensive insurance through the
ObamaCare exchanges. ObamaCare as
originally conceived is a flawed policy
and must be repealed.
Rubio, Colleagues Introduce The
Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act
Joined by 25 Senators, Marco introduced
the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act,
bipartisan legislation proposing
prospective sanctions on Iran should the
regime violate the interim Joint Plan of
Action agreed to in Geneva or should Iran
fail to reach a final agreement.
As Ive said before, I
believe that the administrations
agreement with Iran makes a nuclear Iran
more, not less likely. However,
this bipartisan bill is a first step
towards ensuring that there will be
serious repercussions for Iran if it
violates the agreement made in Geneva or
it becomes clear that, as many of us
fear, Iran is not serious about fully
abandoning its nuclear weapons
program,
said Senator Rubio . Even as
I support this bill focused on
Irans nuclear program, I plan to
continue to work with colleagues in
Congress next year to find additional
ways to ensure that Irans
continued human rights violations and its
sponsorship of terrorism are highlighted
and the elements of the Iranian regime
responsible are penalized.
Rubio Discusses How Trade Benefits
American Workers
During a hearing for the Subcommittee on
East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Marco
discussed the ways trade benefits Americans
workers. An excerpt from the exchange is
below:
Rubio:
But in specific,
on the issue of imports, theres
this idea that imports into the U.S., in
and of themselves, destroy American jobs.
But in your written statement, you have
outlined why, in fact, that is not
potentially the case. That, in
fact, there are also jobs created through
imports from offloading. Can you just
elaborate on that more? Because
thats an issue I get a lot when I
go out and talk about the need to expand
trade opportunities, not just with Asia,
but with the entire world. Can you
elaborate a little bit more on the
benefits that imports, obviously we want
to be able to export too, but the
benefits that imports have for American
jobs, particularly stable, middle class
jobs

Where's My IRS Tax Exempt
Application?
Each month, the IRS receives thousands
of applications for tax exemption. All
applications go through an initial
screening process, where the agency decides
if the application can be approved as
submitted or requires a follow up with the
applicant for more information. If the IRS
needs additional information, a
determinations specialist will contact the
applicant with questions.
Once the IRS receives an application,
they send the applicant an acknowledgement
letter within a few weeks. Due to the
volume of applications, it may take up to
six months from the date of the
acknowledgement letter before the IRS
contacts an applicant to either inform them
that their application has been approved or
to request additional information.
If you received an acknowledgement
letter more than six months ago and have
not yet been notified that your application
was assigned to a specialist, you can
contact Customer Account Services at (877)
829-5500 to check on its status. You will
need the following information when you
call:
The name of the organization on whose
behalf the request was submitted;
The organization's employer
identification number (EIN);
The document locator number assigned
to the request (if you have received
one); and
A proper power of attorney submitted
with the exemption application, unless
you are an officer or director and
legally authorized to represent the
organization.
