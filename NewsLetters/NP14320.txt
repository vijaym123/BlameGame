Dear Friend,
Typhoon Haiyan/Yolanda caused unimaginable destruction and devastation
to the Philippines.
Thousands of people perished and millions more had
their lives upended by this horrific event.
For many, life may never
be the same.
My heart goes out to all those impacted by the storm, and
I am dedicated to helping these people recover from this terrible
disaster.
I am proud to represent a vibrant Filipino population in the East Bay.
Many of my constituents are very concerned about family and friends in
the Philippines, but, unfortunately, power outages and severe damage
have hampered their ability to reconnect.
For inquiries about U.S.
citizens in the affected areas, the U.S. Department of State has set up
a hotline at 1-888-407-4747, or you can email the U.S. Embassy in
Manila directly at acsinfomanila@state.gov
.
We are privileged to live in a country that can offer assistance to
other nations during times of need, and we have - the United States has
pledged $20 million in immediate humanitarian assistance to provide
food, emergency shelter, water, sanitation, and hygiene support.
The
Department of Defense also has deployed U.S. Marines and the USS George
Washington to the region, and immediate efforts will include search and
rescue and humanitarian aid.
For more information on U.S. efforts and
how to help, you can visit www.usaid.gov.
The Philippines is a key ally of the United States, and we must do our
part to help as it rebuilds and recovers from the strongest typhoon on
record.
I stand in solidarity with all of those impacted, and I hope
you will view our office as a resource during this difficult time.
If
you need additional information, please contact one of my East Bay
Offices at (925) 460-5100 or (510) 370-3322, or stop by if there is
anything we can do for you.
Sincerely,
