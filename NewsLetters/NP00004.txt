AR-3 CONNECTION TO FATHER'S
DAY
Did you know that there is Third District connection
to Fathers Day? Sonora Smart Dodd
the Mother of Fathers Day as
shes been called
was born in 1882 south of Fort Smith in Jenny Lind,
Sebastian County, Arkansas. Her mother died during childbirth when
Sonora was 16 years old, leaving her father, William Jackson Smart to
raise six children. While living in Spokane, Washington, in 1909, she
heard a sermon extolling the virtues of motherhood in recognition of the
relatively new Mothers Day holiday that was gaining wider
recognition. Inspiration struck. Fathers should receive a day of recognition
their own for all they do too. It was a thought born out of her
personal experience with her father. She pursued the idea, and with the
backing of Spokane Ministerial Alliance and Spokane YMCA, the first
Fathers Day was celebrated 105 years ago in 1910.
WEEK IN REVIEW
I'd like to start off this week's From the Front... by
thanking all of the Arkansans who visited my office during their visits to
our nation's capital, including the Arkansas Electric Co-Op Youth tour
group, the Arkansas Health Care Association advocates, Windstream,
the Mountain Home High Robotics Team, the Trollinger family of
Springdale, the Arkansans competing in the National History Day Competition,
the Hunter Family of Bella Vista, the Central Junior High students of
Springdale, the Rogers family of Fort Smith, Transportation
Intermediaries Association members, Dr. Marteze Hammonds of Arkansas Tech, the
Trail Life USA troop from Fort Smith and Van Buren, the Podgurski of Fort
Smith, and Arkansass Future Farmers of America. Safe travels back
home!
On Monday, Congressman
Jason Chaffetz (R-UT-3) and I
along with a group of bipartisan lawmakers
introduced the Remote Transaction Parity Act (RTPA; H.R. 2775), a
bill that will modernize our nations outdated sales tax collection
process. The legislation will promote states rights and bring sales tax
parity between e-retailers and brick-and-mortar stores by closing the
internet sales tax loophole in a way that is generous to small remote
sellers without completely changing our current state sales and use tax
structure.
The
existing remote sales tax loophole has created the perception of the
Internet as a duty-free marketplace and skewed the free market. Without
Congressional action, it will stay that way, forcing more Main Street
businesses to close their doors, further harming state and local
services, and burdening consumers with the responsibility of filing their
remote sales taxes. That is why I am proud to join Chairman
Chaffetz to introduce the Remote Transaction Parity Act, which takes the
Marketplace Fairness Acts framework and adds much-needed protections
and exemptions for small businesses. It is the most collaborative
effort to date, and I urge its support.

On Tuesday, the House passed the Intelligence Authorization Act
for FY16 ( H.R. 2596 ) by a vote
of 247-178 ( Roll Call #369 ).
H.R. 2596 authorizes funds for intelligence and intelligence-related
activities of the U.S. government.
Tuesday evening, I was honored by the United States Marine Corps as
the guest of honor at the Sunset Parade. It was truly humbling to see
the Marines performance in front of one of America's greatest
memorials
the Marine Corps War Memorial.
On Wednesday, by a vote of 139-288 ( Roll
Call #370 ), the House rejected
H.Con.Res. 55 , a resolution that would have
directed the President to remove U.S. Armed Forces who were deployed to
Iraq or Syria on or after August 7, 2014, except for those required to
protect U.S. diplomatic facilities and personnel in those countries,
no later than 30 days after adoption of the resolution. If the
President determined that removing such forces within that period is not
safe, the resolution would have allowed the forces to be withdrawn at
any time he determined they can safely be removed, but not later
than December 31, 2015.
Also on Wednesday, the House Appropriations Committee approved my
amendment to the FY16 Financial Services and General Government (FSGG)
bill, which requires the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to
conduct a new, transparent, peer-reviewed study to replace its
seriously flawed Arbitration Study released in March, prior to any rulemaking.

On Thursday, the House concurred in the
Senate Amendment with a House Amendment to the Trade Priorities and
Accountability Act ( H.R. 2146 ) by a vote of
218-208 ( Roll
Call #374 ). The House amendment provides Trade Promotion Authority
(TPA) and establishes a partnership between Congress and the
Administration to ensure the United States secures the most effective trade
agreements possible while bringing greater transparency, vigorous oversight,
and accountability to the negotiating process. Specifically, the
amendment provides robust Congressional oversight and consultation
procedures and Congress with access to information on trade agreements in the
negotiating process, stipulates certain timeline requirements in order
for a trade agreement to be considered under expedited consideration
mechanisms provided in the bill, and establishes procedures through
which Congress may withdraw TPA from the President. The bill authorizes
presidential trade negotiating authority, as prescribed by the bill,
until July 1, 2018. Such authority may be extended until July
1, 2021, if the President submits a request for such an extension and
neither the House nor Senate adopts an extension disapproval
resolution. H.R. 2146 as amended now awaits consideration by the
Senate.
Americans rely on
trade. More than 38 million of our jobs across the country
and
342,335 in Arkansas alone
depend on it. Expanding trade, ensuring its
fair, and allowing access to the 96 percent of the worlds 7 billion
consumers who live outside our borders is essential for growing the U.S.
economy and creating
and keeping
good, high-paying jobs here at
home. TPA will provide unprecedented access, transparency, and
accountability on future free trade agreements and simply gives Americans the
opportunity to compete on a level playing field. When we can do that,
America wins, and when signed into law, TPA will mark a victory for
all of us and a step forward for free
enterprise.
To wrap up the week, the House passed
the Protect Medical Innovation Act of 2015 ( H.R.
160 ) by a vote of 280-140 ( Roll Call
#375 ). H.R. 160 repeals the 2.3 percent excise tax
on the sale of medical devices imposed by the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act on sales in calendar quarters beginning after the
date of enactment.
Next week, its back to Washington for the
consideration of the Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act of 2015
(H.R. 1190), the Ratepayer Protection Act of 2015 (H.R. 2042), and
the Interior and Environment Appropriations Act of
2016.
Wishing all Third District fathers a
Happy Fathers Day!

Front...
