Dear Friend,
This is it. It&rsquo;s 4pm on the last day of the month. There&rsquo;s only 8 hours left for your contribution to count towards our $55,000 goal for August. Election day will be here before we know it. Republicans are already on the ground with offices and operatives in Massachusetts. We need your support now -- can you spare $5?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
I can&rsquo;t predict whether or not outside groups will decide to spend millions of dollars attacking me. But I know that if they do, we&rsquo;re going to have limited time to respond.
If we aren&rsquo;t prepared for a special interest attack, we&rsquo;re in trouble. With fewer than 70 days until the election, we don&rsquo;t have the time to play catch-up if we miss our goals. Outside groups are waiting for an opportunity to strike. We can&rsquo;t give them an opening. Chip in $5, help us hit our goal, and keep us ready for whatever might come our way.
Thank you.
Ed
