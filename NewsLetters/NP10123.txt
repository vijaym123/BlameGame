I&rsquo;d like to share with you some of what I&rsquo;ve been working on in Tennessee and Washington this past month:
Calling for the federal government to stop mandating &ndash; and start enabling
On April 19, I gave the Weekly Republican Address, saying Republicans want a government that enables Americans to create a better life, instead of placing mandates on them. I based the idea in part on the words of technology expert Tim O&rsquo;Reilly. Newt Gingrich quoted O&rsquo;Reilly in his new book,
Breakout , as saying that government should operate like your iPhone &ndash; as a platform to enable society. Apple figured out that if it created a platform, outside developers would bring hundreds of thousands of applications to the table. Usually in Washington, Republicans are the enablers and Democrats are the mandators telling you what to do, on issues from health care to education. Republicans want to enable and empower you &ndash; we want to be the iPhone party.

Scholarships for Kids Act , which is an example of Republicans enabling parents to choose a better school, instead of telling them how to educate their children.
Pushing to simplify student aid &ndash; and lift other Washington burdens on Tennesseans
The 10-page form with 72 pages of instructions that families and students have to fill out to get federal student aid for college is a symptom of what happens in Washington &ndash; not just on education, but on health care and many other issues. All sorts of well-intentioned ideas have piled up, creating a burden for families, which I discussed in a talk at a Jackson Downtown Development Corp. lunch on March 21 and elsewhere around Tennessee over the past month.

Secretary Sebelius&rsquo;s resignation: the right decision after Obamacare&rsquo;s disastrous rollout
It was the right decision for Kathleen Sebelius to step down as President Obama&rsquo;s secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. I called for her resignation in October after the disastrous rollout of Obamacare, which came on top of the rising health insurance costs and cancelled health insurance plans that are the result of the president&rsquo;s health care law. The challenge for Sylvia Burwell, the president&rsquo;s nominee to replace Secretary Sebelius &ndash; or any other successor &ndash; is to help Congress find the right way to repair the damage Obamacare has done to American families.
I believe we need to repeal Obamacare, and replace it with step-by-step reforms that increase choices and drive down the cost of health care, so that more people can afford to buy insurance.

Highlighting four problems Tennesseans have a right to be upset about on Tax Day
This year I marked Tax Day by highlighting four things Tennesseans have a right to be upset about at the close of tax season. They included our $17 trillion debt, the many taxes imposed upon Americans by Obamacare, the unfair treatment of Tennesseans under the federal tax code and the overreach of the Internal Revenue Service. I&rsquo;ve proposed a solution to each of these problems.

Supporting the decision of Tennessee workers to choose not to join a union
Volkswagen&rsquo;s workers rejected the United Auto Workers union last month, and now the best thing for all concerned is to get back to building cars. The UAW appealed the vote by workers not to unionize at Volkswagen&rsquo;s plant in Chattanooga, but dropped its appeal on April 21. The UAW may not like it, but it is the right of employees everywhere to decide whether or not they want to join a union. In almost every case, especially in right-to-work Tennessee, workers have decided they are better off union-free &ndash; and meanwhile new auto jobs have raised family incomes in our state for 30 years.

Discussing problem solving and good government at forums on new book
On March 20, I spoke before an audience at Rhodes College in Memphis about a new book by Keel Hunt called
Coup . It recounts the story of my early swearing-in as governor of Tennessee to stop a pardon scandal &ndash; an experience that for me served as a boot camp for solving problems in government. I&rsquo;ve spoken at a number of such events all around Tennessee, and this one was in honor of Lewis Donelson, left, who helped me through the crisis and served as my commissioner of Finance and Administration. Author Keel Hunt and Professor Mike Nelson, of Rhodes College, joined the discussion.
