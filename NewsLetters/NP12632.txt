Friends,
Thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter. It's been a busy week and
I appreciate the opportunity to share with you everything that's going
on in South Carolina and Washington.
Budget Office: Obamacare Will Cost Over 2 Million Jobs
On Tuesday, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released
a new report showing that Obamacare would cost our economy the
equivalent of nearly 2.5 million full-time jobs.
We knew Obamacare was a bad law from the beginning, and the news only
seems to get worse. Millions have lost their coverage as a result. The
40-hour work week was already under attack from the employer mandate,
and now we're seeing even greater downward pressure on our economy.
Earlier today, I joined an effort that would allow states to opt out of
Obamacare if they choose so we can put this dangerous law behind us and
move forward with solutions that actually make healthcare more
affordable, bolster rather than harm our economy, and let people keep
their coverage.
Meet the Press, On the Record
I was on Meet the Press on Sunday and went "On the Record" with Greta
van Susteren yesterday to discuss my opportunity agenda and how to
build a brighter future for our country. Watch those segments here:

Education that Works for Our Kids
On Wednesday, I announced that I would join my colleagues in
introducing a resolution
aimed at giving states
the flexibility they need when it comes to education - flexibility they
aren't getting with Common Core.
Washington rarely knows best, especially when it comes to the unique
needs of our kids and our communities. Let's put education choices back
in the hands of parents, school districts, and states.
It's an honor to serve you in the United States Senate. As always,
please contact my offices if you have any questions or concerns.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott
