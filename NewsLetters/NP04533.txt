Veterans Day is a special occasion
to honor the more than 22 million brave men and
women who have served in our nations Armed Forces. It is because of the
selfless sacrifices of our veterans and their families that
we have the freedom and liberties we now enjoy.
I am
humbled to represent a region of more than 66,000 armed service members
who have served our country with great
distinction.
President Harry S. Truman once said, our debt to
the heroic men and valiant women in the service of our country can
never be repaid. They have earned our undying gratitude. America will
never forget their sacrifices.
I hope that everyone can take some
time out of their day to remember, honor and express appreciation for
all of our veterans around the country who have risked both life and
limb to protect us and our way of life.
Thank you to all who have served. God bless you and God bless the United
States of America.
