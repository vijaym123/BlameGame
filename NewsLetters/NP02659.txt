Homeland security faces shutdown
Along with all 192 members of the Democratic Caucus, I am cosponsoring legislation, H.R. 861,
that would continue funding for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for the rest of fiscal year 2015. Unless a funding bill passes Congress and is signed by the President by February 27 the Department faces a shutdown. Homeland Security agencies such as USCIS, CBP, TSA, ICE and the Coast Guard keep us safe and play a critical role in the Northern Mariana Islands economy. And all of those agencies employ people who live in our community and deserve to be paid for their hard work. H.R. 861 does not contain any of the policy riders that have caused a legislative stalemate between the House and the Senate threatening to shut down the Department. The way to solve these policy disagreements is for Congress to pass comprehensive immigration legislation, not by refusing to fund the agency that is supposed to keep us all safe. In addition to assuring that Homeland Security and its employees can continue their work in the Northern Marianas, H.R. 861 provides the Commonwealth government with funding through various grant programs.

Mr. Jadrien Lotoc, a student at Kagman High School in Saipan, and Ms. Carlene Patris, formerly of Saipan and now attending Mindszenty High School in Palau, visited their congressional office as part of the Junior State of America (JSA) Winter Program. JSA provides a wonderful experience for students to meet who have similar interests, to exchange ideas through stimulating debates called thought talks, problem solving and a variety of simulations. Thank you both for visiting.
Medical leave of absence
These last six years in the U.S. Congress have been filled with success, but they have also been hard on my health. Flying back and forth from the Northern Marianas to Washington, month-after-month, has been especially bad for my back. My doctors tell me that my only choice is surgery to fuse some of the vertebrae in my lower back. I am scheduled for that operation on Monday, March 2nd at George Washington Hospital in Washington, DC. For at least two months I will be in recovery with limited mobility. Of course, I will have e-mail and the phone, so I can stay in touch with my colleagues in Congress and you can stay in touch with me. And the staff in the Northern Marianas and in Washington never stop working whether I am there or not. The doctors say I can expect a full recovery and will return fit to work. In the meantime, while I get the medical care I need, I ask you for your patience, your understanding and your prayers. You have my promise to keep you informed of my progress and to do what it takes to reach full recovery, so I can return well and continue to work for you.
