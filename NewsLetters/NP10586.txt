Dear Friends:
This weekend, people around the world will be united in a special way
as we celebrate Easter.
As you wrap up your weeks and consider
the days ahead, let us take a moment to reflect on the season's true
joy.
Christ made the ultimate
sacrifice so that we may live through Him.
It is with such
sacrifices, we are granted the opportunity to humble our hearts and renew our
faith.
This Easter, I pray that you will join me in sharing this
sense of restored strength and hope in each other
and in this great
nation
so that we, too, can create a better future for our
children.
It is truly a blessing
to represent you and the people of Arkansass Third District.
I
look forward to seeing many of you while I am home next
week.
Happy Easter, and God
bless.
From the
Front...
Congressman
Steve Womack
Arkansas Third
District
Be on your guard, stand firm in the faith, be
courageous, be strong.
Do everything with love.
