Rep. Bruce Braley -- Iowa's First
District
David,
Did you know that an average of six children are killed in school bus
related accidents each year, while an average of twelve children are
killed each year in pedestrian deaths outside of the school bus?
When my kids were getting on the bus to go to school I wanted every
tool possible to keep them safe, and that's a feeling all parents
share.
That's why this week I introduced the School Bus Safety Act, the most
comprehensive overhaul of the nation's school bus safety system in over
15 years.
The School Bus Safety Act will protect our schoolchildren in a number
of ways:
*	Requires states to enact tough penalties for drivers who pass
stopped school buses -- which is based on "Kadyn's Act," named after
Northwood student Kadyn Halverson who was killed by a driver illegally
passing a school bus.
*	Creates grants for Motion Activated Detection Systems on the
exterior of buses. These systems alert a driver when a moving target is
detected within the danger zones near the front, rear and sides of the
bus.
*	Require background checks on school bus drivers. In 2012, Iowa
enacted such a law, but some states are still operating without this
requirement.
*	Create a Demonstration Program which would allow states to
apply for funding to purchase new school buses with seat belts or to
equip current ones with seat belts.
*	Direct the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to
assess using technology to get drivers to stop for school buses.

For many schoolchildren, their safety is more at risk coming and going
from school than in the classroom or on the playground -- and we can do
something to change that.
All the best,
Bruce

David,
Did
you
know
that
an

six

each

while
an
average

twelve

are

each

in

deaths
outside

school
bus?
When
my

were
getting

I
wanted

and
that&#8217;s
a

That's

this

I

the

The

Creates

for
Motion
Activated
Detection
Systems
on
the
exterior

These
systems
alert
a
driver
when
a
moving

is
detected
within
the
danger
zones
near
the

the

Require
