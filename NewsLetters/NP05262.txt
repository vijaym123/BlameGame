David -- We have a TERRIBLE problem. And literally only a few hours left to find a solution. Please take 30 seconds to read this:
Boehner and his billionaire allies are breaking the record this week. They&rsquo;re spending $20 MILLION dollars to defeat Democrats.
That&rsquo;s staggering. As we speak, that Republican money is flowing into districts we MUST WIN.
We&rsquo;ll be blunt: we can&rsquo;t let their attacks go unanswered. But our ad buy deadline is at 6PM today. We&rsquo;re still coming up 9,137 donations short.
If you&rsquo;re reading this email right now, we&rsquo;re begging for your help.
David -- please step up again before the ad buy deadline.
Donations before 6pm will be
TRIPLE-MATCHED.
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;

Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks,
