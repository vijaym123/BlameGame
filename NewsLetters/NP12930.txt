Congressman Pittenger to Host "Twitter
Town Hall" Following State of the Union
Address
Local
Military Hero to Accompany Congressman Pittenger to State of the
Union
Are you planning to watch
President Obamas State of the Union address tonight at 9 p.m.?
Following President Obamas speech and the
Republican response by Congresswoman Cathy
McMorris-Rodgers,
I will be holding a Town Hall on Twitter to answer your
questions.
Please join us! My account is
@RepPittenger
and well add the #NC09SOTU tag to our messages
for a full, group conversation.
This past September Congressman
Pittenger met Sgt. Cooke for the first time when he joined the Patriot
Guard Riders to welcome Sgt. Cooke home after four years of recovery at
Fort Hood. Click

This year my personal guest for the State of the Union is
Matt Cooke , Sergeant US Army (Ret.),
a local
hero of the Fort Hood massacre who used his body to shield others
during the attack.
Sgt. Cooke is a true American hero, willingly risking his life to
save others.
Sadly, Sgt. Cooke has not received full recognition for his bravery because
the Obama Administration refused to classify the Fort Hood massacre a
terrorist attack.
Despite being shot five times, Sgt. Cooke isnt eligible for the
Purple Heart and receives fewer disability benefits than his fellow
soldiers wounded while serving in Iraq or Afghanistan.
Sgt. Cooke, who is 90 percent disabled due
to the attack, lives with family members in Charlotte. He will spend
part of this time in Washington drawing attention to the unequal
treatment of Fort Hood survivors. Now that the terrorist responsible for
the Fort Hood massacre was sentenced to death, it is time for the
Obama Administration to rightfully classify that attack as an act
of terrorism.
Sgt. Cooke deserves the Purple Heart for
defending his fellow soldiers, even while unarmed himself,
and our
country owes him and every victim of Fort Hood the rightful benefits
they were promised upon their commitments to defend Americans.
This past September I met Sgt. Cooke for
the first time when I joined the Patriot Guard Riders to welcome him
home in Charlotte after four years of recovery at Fort Hood.
This is the second year I will be
accompanied by a Wounded Warrior while the President delivers his State of the
Union address.
Please join us
on Twitter following the State of the Union address. We will have a
productive conversation regarding your thoughts about the speech, as well
as share our plan for growing the economy and producing better jobs
in the Charlotte-area.
