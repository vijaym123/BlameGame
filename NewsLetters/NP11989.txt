RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE: This week, I took action to force an up-or-down vote on key legislation that would give at least 25 million Americans a pay raise.
I joined my colleagues in signing a discharge petition to bring the Fair Minimum Wage Act (H.R. 1010) to the floor for a vote. The bill increases the minimum wage over three years from $7.25 to $10.10 per hour, indexes future annual increases to inflation thereafter, and gradually increases the tipped minimum wage to 70 percent of the minimum wage.

MEDICAL : It&#8217;s hard to believe it's been a year since the groundbreaking of Oakhurst Medical Center&#8217;s Memorial Drive facility. I was pleased to present the Center&#8217;s CEO Jeff Taylor with a Congressional Certificate at their
ceremony on Monday, Feb. 24. The Affordable Care Act has provided more than $6.5 million to our community health centers, and Oakhurst is on the front lines of providing quality, affordable health care. For more, visit my Facebook page by clicking

FARM BUREAU : It was excellent to attended the 2014 Newton County Farm Bureau Legislative Appreciation dinner last month at the Newton County College and Career Academy in
Covington. My staff and I have embraced the agricultural parts of the Fourth District, and I appreciate the Farm Bureau reaching out to us. And congratulations to the Newton County Farm Bureau for recently being named the No. 1 Farm Bureau in Georgia by the
state Farm Bureau president.
As always, I appreciate your time and feedback. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to represent you in Congress.
