Dear Friend,
This was an in-district work week, an opportunity to spend time
visiting the good people of Missouri's Fourth Congressional District
and to listen to their concerns.
A visit to Pulaski County included a tour of Waynesville High School's
9thGrade Center and its superb learning environment provided to
students. The 9thGrade Center is designed for a purpose. I learned that
while the center is a building within a building, housing core courses
and facilities dedicated to freshmen, it is connected to the high
school to allow students to take advantage of elective classes and
programs and to interact with upperclassmen.

students of Waynesville High School's 9thGrade Center
A major benefit is that the 9thGrade Center has students and faculty
arranged in small learning communities where core teachers work with a
smaller group of freshmen to get to know them, their parents, and their
specific learning needs. Each morning, freshmen meet with their mentors
who deliver mini-lessons that cover a wide range of topics important to
student success. In essence, this educational experience is designed
specifically to strengthen the transition of students from middle
school to high school. As a former school teacher, I am impressed and
pleased that such a high quality program is offered in our district.
Many of the students attending Waynesville High School are the sons and
daughters of service members stationed at nearby Fort Leonard Wood. The
Fort is observing Women's History Month, and I was given the honor of
addressing the 3rdChemical Brigade luncheon on the theme of "Celebrating
Women of Character, Courage and Commitment." It was a great opportunity
to acknowledge some of the accomplishments they have made to our
country.
Our history is rich with women who have distinguished themselves in the
defense of our country. From Mary Hays McCauley, better known as Molly
Pitcher, who brought drinking water to soldiers at the Battle of
Monmouth during the American Revolutionary War - to Margaret Corbin,
who took the place of her mortally wounded husband at the cannon during
the defense of Fort Washington in 1776, and was awarded an annual
pension by the State of Pennsylvania for her heroism in battle - to the
women defending our country today in Afghanistan, women have served our
country bravely and protected our freedoms. As a woman on the House
Armed Services Committee, I am so proud of the contributions these and
other women have made to our country and I thank the women who are
serving today for all they do for our nation on a daily basis.
It is always important to hear from community leaders and I was pleased
to meet with the Mayors of Waynesville and St. Robert as well as many
of the civic and business leaders who shared their concerns with
government red tape, the future of Fort Leonard Wood, and other issues
of importance.
Congresswoman Hartzler meets with Waynesville
Mayor Luge Hardman and community leaders
Fort Leonard Wood (FLW) is one of the Army's premier Centers of
Excellence and vital military assets. It is an important cog in the
wheel of America's defense readiness. It has come far since the days my
father did his basic training there! I couldn't be prouder to represent
this installation. We must continue to stand strong for our national
defense and let others know the good missions being conducted at FLW. I
firmly believe that at a time when America faces threats from rogue
nations and uncertainty with such powers as Russia, it would be a grave
error to make further reductions to our national defense. I will
continue to fight for additional funding to ensure we provide for the
common defense.
I visited Pettis County this week, as well, meeting with the good
people at the Ewing Vocational Center, which is part of the Center for
Human Services (CHS). The Center provides vocational rehabilitation or
habilitation services that include job counseling, job training, and
work experience to citizens with disabilities and who are affected by
lack of education, job skills, or experience.

The CHS Vision statement is: Lives without limitations; and its Mission
statement is: Overcoming barriers to achieve a fulfilled life. There is
a firm commitment to helping everyone achieve his or her abilities and
dreams and to live full lives. The Center has seen many of the people
it has served over the years grow up, attend school, go to work, and
contribute to their communities. The Center is also thankful for the
positive response its efforts have received from the good people of
Sedalia and Pettis County. This cooperation has been an integral part
of so many individuals with disabilities achieving success. It is truly
a blessing for citizens in need of vocational assistance to have access
to this center and the caring communities interested in hiring. I am
honored that this center is part of our district, helping many of our
citizens to succeed and become productive members of society.
As a staunch supporter of our Second Amendment rights, while in Sedalia
I took the opportunity to visit Sierra Bullets, which manufactures
bullets known throughout the world for their quality. Hunting and
target bullets for rifles and handguns are the only products made by
Sierra, and I was impressed with all I saw. It's important we continue
to stand strong for our freedoms and I am glad Sierra Bullets is
helping to lead the way.
It's been a busy week, but one I value as I was able to spend time with
the good citizens of Missouri's Fourth Congressional District. The
reasonable and sound comments I hear as I visit cities and towns
throughout our district provide me with valuable insight I take when I
return to Washington, D.C. There is no substitute for good old
fashioned Missouri common sense and values.
Have a great week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler

Dear
Friend,
This

an

to
spend

the

is
that

small

where
core

work

In

this

is
designed

to
strengthen

As
a

I
am

such
a
high
quality
program
is
offered
in
our
district.
Many

the
students
attending
Waynesville

are
the
sons

members
stationed

The

to
Margaret
Corbin,
who
took
the
place
of
her
mortally
wounded
husband
at
the
cannon
during
the
defense
of
Fort
Washington
in
1776,
and
was
awarded
an
annual
pension
by
the
State
of
Pennsylvania
for
her
heroism
in
battle
&#8211;
to
the
women
defending
our
country
today
in
Afghanistan,
women
have
served
our
country
bravely
and
protected
our
freedoms.
As
a
woman
on
the
House
Armed
Services
Committee,
I
am
so
proud
of
the
contributions
these
and
other
women
have
made
to
our
country
and
I
thank
the
women
who
are
serving
today
for
all
they
do
for
our
nation
on
a
daily
basis.
It
is
always
important
to
hear
from
community
leaders
and
I
was

to
meet
with
the
Mayors

Waynesville
and

as

the
future
of
Fort

Wood,
and
other
issues
of
importance.

It

We
must
continue
to
stand

for

and
let
others
know
the
good
missions
being
conducted
at
FLW.
I
firmly

that
at

Russia,
it

I
visited
Pettis

this

as
well,
meeting
with
the
good

at
the
Ewing

which
is
part

The
CHS
Vision
statement
is:
Lives
without
limitations ;
and
its
Mission
statement
is:
Overcoming
barriers
to
achieve
a

There
is
a
firm
commitment
to
helping
everyone
achieve
his
or
her
abilities
and
dreams
and
to
live
full
lives.
The
Center
has
seen
many
of
the
people
it
has
served
over
the
years
grow
up,
attend
school,
go
to
work,
and
contribute
to
their
communities.
The
Center
is
also
thankful
for
the
positive
response
its
efforts
have
received
from
the
good
people
of
Sedalia
and
Pettis
County.
This
cooperation
has
been
an
integral
part
of
so
many
individuals
with
disabilities
achieving
success.
It
is
truly
a
blessing
for
citizens
in
need
of
vocational
assistance
to
have
access
to
this
center
and
the
caring
communities
interested
in
hiring.
I
am
honored
that
this
center
is
part
of
our
district,
helping
many
of
our
citizens
to
succeed
and
become
productive
members
of
society.
As
a
staunch
supporter
of
our
Second
Amendment
rights,
while
in
Sedalia
I
took
the
opportunity
to
visit
Sierra
Bullets,
which
manufactures
bullets
known
throughout
the
world
for
their
quality.
Hunting
and
target
bullets
for
rifles
and
handguns
are
the
only
products
made
by
Sierra,
and
I
was
impressed
with
all
I
saw.
It&#8217;s
important
we
continue
to
stand
strong
for
our
freedoms
and
I
am
glad
Sierra
Bullets
is
helping
to
lead
the
way.
It&#8217;s
been
a
busy
week,
but
one
I
value
as
I
was
able
to
spend
time
with
the
good
citizens
of
Missouri&#8217;s
Fourth
Congressional
District.
The
reasonable
and
sound
comments
I
hear
as
I
visit
cities
and
towns
throughout
our
district
provide
me
with
valuable
insight
I
take
when
I
return
to
Washington,
D.C.
There
is
no
substitute
for
good
old

Missouri
common
sense
and
values.
Have
a
great
week.
