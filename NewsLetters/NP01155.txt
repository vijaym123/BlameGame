Friend,
Im proud to announce that Ive been
honored as a Humane Champion again this year!
This is the seventh time Ive received this award from the
Humane Society since joining the U.S. Senate and I plan to live up to
the honor by continuing to champion the issues we all believe are so
critical to protecting our animals.
Here are a few things Ive been working
on:
I plan to introduce the SAFE Act (Safeguard American
Food Exports) which would prohibit the slaughter of horses for human
consumption in the U.S. and I plan to do it with the bipartisan support
needed to get it enacted.
Last month, I
led a letter
with 19
Senators from both sides of the aisle
to the Appropriations
Agriculture Subcommittee requesting that no funds go toward federally-required
inspections for the reopening of domestic horse slaughter
facilities.
I re-introduced the
Safe Transport for Horses Act to prohibit the use of
double-decker trailers for transporting horses. And dont get confused by the
name of the Act; its the same bill as my Horse Transportation Safety
Act, just with a new name.
Im
fighting against the Administrations plan to open our coast to offshore
drilling because we must protect our marine wildlife from a potential
oil spill.

Jerseyans are saying about the bill and become a citizen
co-sponsor .
I will not stop standing up for animal rights in
the U.S. Senate. This is personal for me. M y
familys cat, Twinky, and pug, Freddy, remind me every day how important
the fight to protect animals is.
