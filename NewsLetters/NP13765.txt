Dear Friend,
December 14 will mark the one year anniversary of the tragedy at Sandy
Hook Elementary School, which took the lives of 20 innocent children
and six brave educators.
Though we mark the anniversary of a dark day, I also know we will see
renewed hope and inspiration.
Throughout this difficult year, families and members of the community
in Newtown have responded to unimaginable tragedy not with anger or
hate, but with love, courage, and kindness. They have inspired me and
countless people across the country.
Next week, members of the Newtown community will inspire us again, as
families and advocates honor all victims of gun violence by performing
acts of kindness and encouraging Americans across the country to do the
same. Many will volunteer in Connecticut while others will volunteer in
Washington, D.C. when they travel there next week. My staff and I will
also participate. They have chosen to volunteer on their own time with
charities and non-profits in both Connecticut and Washington to honor
all those whose lives were lost to gun violence.
This past year has been filled with heated rhetoric on many issues
including how to prevent gun violence. December 14 presents an
opportunity for all of us to pause and reflect, remember the 20
innocent children and six brave educators appropriately, and perform
acts of kindness to improve and serve our communities.
As always, please do not hesitate to contact me by email, phone, or
letter with your concerns, or questions, or if I or my office can help
you in any way.
Sincerely,
Elizabeth Esty
Member of Congress
