Congressman Lamborn Statement on
Obamacare Anniversary
3/24/14
Today, Congressman
Doug Lamborn released the following statement marking the fourth
anniversary of the passage of Obamacare.
In the four years since the passage of Obamacare, we sure
have found out what is in the bill, and the American people dont like
it. Six million canceled insurance plans. Countless broken promises.
Arbitrary movement of deadlines. Freedoms of conscience in jeopardy.
Increased premiums. The list goes on and on. It is time to end this
madness and start over with free market and patient-centered reforms. I
have opposed this disastrous bill every step of the way and I will
continue to do everything I can to stop the government from standing
between you and your doctor.
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
(CO-05)
