Friend,
I can&rsquo;t thank you enough. Over 100 people pitched in over the last couple days to show their support and, I must say, this has been the best birthday yet!
I had a wonderful time celebrating with family and friends over the weekend, and I am looking forward to what this year has to bring.
Thanks again for your faith and support. I am humbled.
Be well,
Ami
