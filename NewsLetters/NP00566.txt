TOMORROW: Join me for Cooking with your Congressman
Dear Friends,
During the month of May, I have hosted a variety of events in recognition of May as Health and Fitness Month to get everyone thinking about becoming healthier. From my Community Fitness Day in Fort Worth to my Congressional Fitness Expo in Washington, D.C., I will continue my efforts to make health and fitness attainable for Americans everywhere.
To conclude my month-long pledge of health and fitness I would like to invite you to join me tomorrow, Saturday, May 30 at 11 a.m. for a FREE lunch and healthy cooking demonstration with Chef Brenda Johnson at Nash-Davis Recreation Center located at 3710 N. Hampton Road in Dallas. Space is limited, so
please click here to RSVP for this FREE event.
I look forward to seeing you tomorrow!
In the meantime, I also invite you to connect with me through my
official website ,
Facebook page , and
Twitter account
to stay informed of what I am working on in the District and in Washington D.C.
Sincerely,
Marc Veasey
Member of Congress
