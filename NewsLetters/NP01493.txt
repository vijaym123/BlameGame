Dear Friends,
Today marks the start of National Park Week! This year, Delaware has
even more reason to celebrate since it's the first time that the First
State can celebrate National Park Week with a national park of its own!
This past December, I was thrilled when legislation to create the First
State National Historical Park
was finally approved by Congress, joining Delaware
to the network of states that are home to national parks that attract
millions of visitors each year.
Every year, millions of tourists
plan their vacations around our nation's national park system. In 2009
alone, each state with a national park received a minimum of $1.1
million in direct economic benefits from park tourism, with many states
receiving much more. Now Delawareans stand to benefit from the added
tourism from the park, and we also have the unique opportunity to
influence the experience and memories of those visiting our state.
Admission to the First State
National Historical Park is always free - and the experience is
priceless. But this weekend, in celebration of National Park Week,
every park across the country has free admission. I hope you have the
opportunity to explore our nation's rich history, beautiful landscapes
and vibrant culture by seeing what our national parks have to offer,
near and far.
This week, I invite my friends visiting the First State National Park
to share your photos and videos from your visit on Twitter
and Facebook
.

2015 Dear
Friends,
Today
marks
the
start
of
National
Park
Week!
This
year,
Delaware
has
even
more
reason
to
celebrate
since
it&#8217;s
the
first
time
that
the
First
State
can
celebrate
National
Park
Week with
a
national
park
of
its
own!
This
past
December,
I
was
thrilled
when
legislation
to
create
the
First
State
National
Historical
Park
was
finally
approved
by
Congress,
joining
Delaware
to
the
network
of
states
that
are
home
to
national
parks
that
attract
millions
of
visitors
each
year.
Every
year,
millions
of
tourists
plan
their
vacations
around
our
nation's
national
park
system.
In
2009
alone,
each
state
with
a
national
park
received
a
minimum
of
$1.1
million
in
direct
economic
benefits
from
park
tourism,
with
many
states
receiving
much
more.
Now
Delawareans
stand
to
benefit
from
the
added
tourism
from
the
park,
and
we
also
have
the
unique
opportunity
to
influence
the
experience
and
memories
of
those
visiting
our
state.
Admission
to
the
First
State
National
Historical
Park
is
always
free
-
and
the
experience
is
priceless.
But
this
weekend,
in
celebration
of
National
Park
Week,
every
park
across
the
country
has
free
admission.
I
hope
you
have
the
opportunity
to
explore
our
nation&#8217;s
rich
history,
beautiful
landscapes
and
vibrant
culture
by
seeing
what
our
national
parks
have
to
offer,
near
and
far.
This
week,
I
invite
my
friends
visiting
the
First
State
National
Park
to
share
your
photos
and
videos
from
your
visit
on
Twitter
and
Facebook .
