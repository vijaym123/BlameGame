Kansas Common Sense
June 22, 2015
Hello,
Welcome to Kansas Common Sense. Thank you for your continued interest
in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
Using Common Sense to Conserve Lesser Prairie Chicken
This week, my amendment to the Fiscal Year 2016 Interior and
Environment Appropriations Bill to restrict the use of funds for
enforcement of the decision by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife (FWS) to list
the lesser prairie chicken (LPC) as a threatened species under the
Endangered Species Act passed out of committee. I believe the FWS acted
prematurely when listing the LPC. The five states with habitat area
Kansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Texas
came together with
stakeholders to develop a broadly supported plan to conserve the bird.
However, they were not given adequate time to implement the
conservation plan due to the federal government unnecessarily stepping
in and listing the bird as a threatened species.
Critics of my amendment expressed a belief that the FWS knew best when
deciding to list the LPC as a threatened species and we should trust
their judgment. I disagree. I believe the Kansas Department of Wildlife
and Parks, landowners and conversation organizations in Kansas and
other stakeholders know better than the federal government how to
preserve the bird and its habitat area.
I am confident there are ways to conserve the species without
burdensome regulations from the federal government that hinder economic
opportunities in rural communities. Rainfall this spring and
conservation efforts at the state and local level will be far more
effective at replenishing the lesser prairie chicken population than
rules and regulations coming from Washington, D.C. I am pleased my
amendment passed in the appropriations committee and am committed to
continuing my efforts to shield Kansas from the impacts of the listing.

Protecting Kansans from EPA Overregulation
As a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations, I also took
aim Thursday at the Obama Administrations pattern of unnecessary
federal overreach and costly environmental regulations. The 2016
Interior and Environment Appropriations Bill, which now heads to the
full Senate for a vote, would block the Waters of the United States
(WOTUS) rule released by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), as well as allow states to
opt out of the EPA's Clean Power Plan rule which threatens to increase
energy costs for Americans while providing minimal environmental
benefits.
For both the WOTUS rule and the EPA's Clean Power Plant rule, the EPA
has ignored the clear objections of stakeholders from across the
country about the devastating impacts these regulatory schemes will
have on families and businesses. I will continue to work to protect
Kansas families, the rural economy and small businesses from these
deeply flawed regulations and work for commonsense, local solutions to
protect our environment. Click here

Passage of the National Defense Authorization Act
This week, the United States Senate continued consideration of the
National Defense Authorization Act. This legislation authorizes the
appropriations process for the Fiscal Year 2016 for the Department of
Defense, military construction and defense related projects for other
federal agencies. I was pleased by the full and open discussion that
took place regarding numerous amendments to the bill, which passed the
full Senate by a vote of 71-25 this past Thursday. Providing the men
and women of our military with the proper training and equipment they
need to defend our nation has always been and continues to be one of my
top priorities.
I was pleased that an amendment I offered to the NDAA passed
unanimously and was included in the final bill. My Sense of Congress
Amendment directs the Secretary of Defense to review and consider
findings and recommendations from the Council of Governors regarding
cyber mission force requirements and the synchronization of cyber
capabilities in the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces,
particularly as it relates to reducing capabilities. The Council of
Governors
created to enable governors and federal officials to
address matters pertaining to the National Guard, homeland defense and
defense support to civil authorities
has an inherent coordination
role between state and federal governments. This amendment highlights
the importance of the Council of Governors and their role in
determining the Department of Defenses cyber capabilities,
specifically in the National Guard.
Oversight of the Consumer Product Safety Commission
On Wednesday, I convened my third hearing as Chairman of the Senate
Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety,
Insurance, and Data Security. As part of the Subcommittees role to
conduct oversight of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the
hearing examined the agencys FY 2016 Budget Request, its current
rulemaking agenda, and issues identified in recent reports by the CPSC
Inspector General.
Created in 1972, the CPSC is an independent regulatory agency led by
five commissioners, each of whom presented testimony at Wednesdays
hearing. A relatively small but powerful agency, the CPSC is
responsible for protecting the public against unreasonable risks of
injuries associated with more than 15,000 consumer products, such as
household products, toys and sporting goods. The Consumer Product
Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA) greatly expanded the scope of
the agencys mission, and implementation of this law has been
controversial and required Congressional action to limit the
Commissions new authority. While protecting the safety of Americans is
a top priority for the Subcommittee, it is important to make certain
CPSC activity is supported by sound data and engagement with
manufacturers, importers, retailers and other stakeholders.
During the hearing, senators from both sides of the aisle discussed a
wide range of issues related to CPSC rulemaking and jurisdiction,
including expanded surveillance on imported goods at our nations
ports, the safety risks of liquid laundry packets, and legislation to
study the safety concerns of recreational off-highway vehicles, or
ROVs. In particular, my questioning focused on the issue of consumer
fireworks. Every Fourth of July holiday, thousands of American
consumers are critically injured using fireworks, and yet the CPSC has
not updated its mandatory fireworks standards in many years. In fact,
CPSC staff often determines which fireworks are safe on the basis of a
subjective ear test related to the sound a product makes when
detonated. This creates additional uncertainty for manufacturers and
importers who struggle to predetermine compliance in the absence of
measurable scientific standards. I strongly encouraged the five
commissioners to make the development of objective fireworks testing
criteria a priority of the agency, and have been assured that
meaningful progress will be forthcoming.
I look forward to working with the CPSC and my colleagues on the Senate
Commerce Consumer Protection Subcommittee in the future to further
explore these and other important issues, as each of us shares the
common goal of protecting consumers and doing what we can to prevent
tragic injuries or fatalities from consumer products. To watch a video

Meeting with the 931st Air Refueling Group
I always enjoy meeting with Kansans who serve in our Armed Forces, and
this week I had the opportunity to catch up Colonel Mark Larson, who
commands the 931st Air Refueling Group stationed at McConnell Air Force
Base. I am pleased to report that the group now meets the threshold to
transition into an Air Refueling Wing, which will give them the
resources and manning necessary to fuel the new KC-46A tankers arriving
at McConnell in 2017. I have advocated for their Wing status for
several years and I am glad that the transition is now underway.
Kansas Vietnam Era Veterans Medallion Ceremony in Independence
On Saturday, I was honored to be the keynote speaker at a ceremony
honoring our veterans in Independence. In conjunction with the Kansas
Commission on Veterans Affairs, 200 individuals were presented with the
Kansas Vietnam Era Veterans Medallion. These brave men and women served
in our Armed Forces between February 1961 and May 1975. This year, as
we commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War, it is fitting
that we honor them.
During the Vietnam War, 248 Medals of Honor were presented to our
American troops who courageously fought for our freedom. There is no
group of people I hold in higher regard than our nations troops and
veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country. Thanks
again to Kathy Shepard for inviting me to be a part of this special
event. Thanks also to Ryon Knop, Jason Sterling, and the Kansas
Commission on Veterans Affairs' Gregg Burden and Wayne Bollig for
assisting with the ceremony. The day also included a parade,
preservation workshop, reunions for all war veterans and a free will
donation dinner and auction.
Visiting Southeast Kansas Hospitals
Also on Saturday, I had the opportunity to visit two community
hospitals in southeast Kansas. My first stop was at Coffeyville
Regional Medical Center (CRMC). CRMC is an 88-bed acute hospital that
serves on an annual basis more than 45,000 patients from Montgomery,
Chautauqua, Labette, Allen, Neosho, and Wilson counties in Kansas, as
well as Nowata and Craig counties in Oklahoma. I shared valuable
conversation with hospital staff and administrators, including CRMCs
newly-appointed CEO, Mark Woodring. Mark previously served as associate
administrator of operations at Truman Medical Centers in Kansas City,
Mo. Mark brings valuable experience and knowledge in health care
management to the CRMC team. Thanks to Mark for hosting my visit and to
all the members of the CRMC staff and board of trustees for attending.
I appreciate having you as partners in the effort to improve the
quality of life of we enjoy in our Kansans communities.
Next I visited with hospital administrators and staff at Neosho
Memorial Regional Medical Center (NMRMC) in Chanute. NMRMC is a
Critical Access Hospital serving Kansans in Neosho County and the
surrounding area since 1951. Recently, NMRMC announced it received a
five-star rating from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS) under the agencys patient satisfaction survey. I enjoyed
visiting with NMRMC staff and administrators about several investments
the hospital is making to enhance patient care, including a new
state-of-the-art mammography unit, and plans to purchase a new surgical
system that will allow for the performance of minimally invasive
procedures. Thanks to NMRMC CEO Dennis Franks for hosting my visit.
During my time representing Kansans in Washington, D.C., Ive had the
opportunity to visit each of the 127 community hospitals in our state.
Each of my visits with Kansas health care providers provide me with
useful insight on their efforts to provide quality care to patients,
often across wide geographic areas. For Coffeyville, Chanute, and
communities like them, access to the types of health care services
offered by these community hospitals is essential because access to
quality health care services determines whether Kansans can remain in
the communities they call home, and whether their children can return
to raise families of their own.
Speaking at the 60th anniversary of Iola Industries, Inc.
I ended the week in Iola, where I was invited to present the keynote
address at the 60th anniversary of Iola Industries, Inc. More than 80
area community and business leaders were present for this annual
meeting to celebrate their accomplishments over the past 60 years.
First incorporated in 1955, the organization promotes industry and
business development in the Iola area. Iola Industries has more
recently become interested in addressing housing concerns in Allen
County and continues to demonstrate the importance of a community
believing enough in itself to invest for current and future
generations.
Thanks to the Iola Industries board of directors for the invitation to
participate in their celebration, and to Board Chairperson Mary Kay
Heard for coordinating my visit
Thanks also to Allen County
Commissioners Jim Talkington and Jerry Daniels; Iola City Council
Members Beverly and Aaron Franklin; Iola City Administrator Carl
Slaugh; former-Kansas House of Representatives member Stanley Dreher;
and former-Mayor Bill Shirley for attending this event.

Common
Sense
to
Conserve
Lesser
Prairie
Chicken
This
week,
my
amendment
to
the
Fiscal
Year
2016
Interior
and
Environment
Appropriations
Bill
to
restrict
the
use
of
funds
for
enforcement
of
the
decision
by
the
U.S.
Fish
and
Wildlife
(FWS)
to
list
the
lesser
prairie
chicken
(LPC)
as
a
threatened
species
under
the
Endangered
Species
Act
passed
out
of
committee.
I
believe
the
FWS
acted
prematurely
when
listing
the
LPC.
The
five
states
with
habitat
area
&#150;
Kansas,
Colorado,
Oklahoma,
New
Mexico and
Texas
&#150;
came
together
with
stakeholders
to
develop
a
broadly
supported
plan
to
conserve
the
bird.
However,
they
were
not
given
adequate
time
to
implement
the
conservation
plan
due
to
the
federal
government
unnecessarily
stepping
in
and
listing
the
bird
as
a
threatened
species.
Critics
of
my
amendment
expressed
a
belief
that
the
FWS
knew
best
when
deciding
to
list
the
LPC
as
a
threatened
species
and
we
should
trust
their
judgment.
I
disagree.
I
believe
the
Kansas
Department
of
Wildlife
and
Parks,
landowners
and
conversation
organizations
in
Kansas
and
other
stakeholders
know
better
than
the
federal
government
how
to
preserve
the
bird
and
its
habitat
area.
I
am
confident
there
are
ways
to
conserve
the
species
without
burdensome
regulations
from
the
federal
government
that
hinder
economic
opportunities
in
rural
communities.
Rainfall
this
spring
and
conservation
efforts
at
the
state
and
local
level
will
be
far
more
effective
at
replenishing
the
lesser
prairie
chicken
population
than
rules
and
regulations
coming
from
Washington,
D.C.
I
am
pleased
my
amendment
passed
in
the
appropriations
committee
and
am
committed
to
continuing
my
efforts
to
shield
Kansas
from
the
impacts
of
the
listing.

Protecting
Kansans
from
EPA
Overregulation
As
a
member
of
the
U.S.
Senate
Committee
on
Appropriations,
I
also
took
aim
Thursday
at
the
Obama
Administration&#146;s
pattern
of
unnecessary
federal
overreach
and
costly
environmental
regulations.
The
2016
Interior
and
Environment
Appropriations
Bill,
which
now
heads
to
the
full
Senate
for
a
vote,
would
block
the
Waters
of
the
United
States
(WOTUS)
rule
released
by
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(EPA)
and
the
U.S.
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
(USACE),
as
well
as
allow
states
to
opt
out
of
the
EPA's
Clean
Power
Plan
rule
which
threatens
to
increase
energy
costs
for
Americans
while
providing
minimal
environmental
benefits.
For
both
the
WOTUS
rule
and
the
EPA's
Clean
Power
Plant
rule,
the
EPA
has
ignored
the
clear
objections
of
stakeholders
from
across
the
country
about
the
devastating
impacts
these
regulatory
schemes
will
have
on
families
and
businesses.
I
will
continue
to
work
to
protect
Kansas
families,
the
rural
economy
and
small
businesses
from
these
deeply
flawed
regulations
and
work
for
commonsense,
local
solutions
to
protect
our
environment.

Passage
of
the
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
This
week,
the
United
States
Senate
continued
consideration
of
the
National
Defense
Authorization
Act.
This
legislation
authorizes
the
appropriations
process
for
the
Fiscal
Year
2016
for
the
Department
of
Defense,
military
construction
and
defense
related
projects
for
other
federal
agencies.
I
was
pleased
by
the
full
and
open
discussion
that
took
place
regarding
numerous
amendments
to
the
bill,
which
passed
the
full
Senate
by
a
vote
of
71-25
this
past
Thursday.
Providing
the
men
and
women
of
our
military
with
the
proper
training
and
equipment
they
need
to
defend
our
nation
has
always
been
and
continues
to
be
one
of
my
top
priorities.
I
was
pleased
that
an
amendment
I
offered
to
the
NDAA
passed
unanimously
and
was
included
in
the
final
bill.
My
Sense
of
Congress
Amendment
directs
the
Secretary
of
Defense
to
review
and
consider
findings
and
recommendations
from
the
Council
of
Governors
regarding
cyber
mission
force
requirements
and
the
synchronization
of
cyber
capabilities
in
the
active
and
reserve
components
of
the
Armed
Forces,
particularly
as
it
relates
to
reducing
capabilities.
The
Council
of
Governors
&#150;
created
to
enable
governors
and
federal
officials
to
address
matters
pertaining
to
the
National
Guard,
homeland
defense
and
defense
support
to
civil
authorities
&#150;
has
an
inherent
coordination
role
between
state
and
federal
governments.
This
amendment
highlights
the
importance
of
the
Council
of
Governors
and
their
role
in
determining
the
Department
of
Defense&#146;s
cyber
capabilities,
specifically
in
the
National
Guard.
Oversight
of
the
Consumer
Product
Safety
Commission
On
Wednesday,
I
convened
my
third
hearing
as
Chairman
of
the
Senate
Commerce
Subcommittee
on
Consumer
Protection,
Product
Safety,
Insurance,
and
Data
Security.
As
part
of
the
Subcommittee&#146;s
role
to
conduct
oversight
of
the
Consumer
Product
Safety
Commission
(CPSC),
the
hearing
examined
the
agency&#146;s
FY
2016
Budget
Request,
its
current
rulemaking
agenda,
and
issues
identified
in
recent
reports
by
the
CPSC
Inspector
General.
Created
in
1972,
the
CPSC
is
an
independent
regulatory
agency
led
by
five
commissioners,
each
of
whom
presented
testimony
at
Wednesday&#146;s
hearing.
A
relatively
small
but
powerful
agency,
the
CPSC
is
responsible
for
protecting
the
public
against
unreasonable
risks
of
injuries
associated
with
more
than
15,000
consumer
products,
such
as
household
products,
toys
and
sporting
goods.
The
Consumer
Product
Safety
Improvement
Act
of
2008
(CPSIA)
greatly
expanded
the
scope
of
the
agency&#146;s
mission,
and
implementation
of
this
law
has
been
controversial
and
required
Congressional
action
to
limit
the
Commission&#146;s
new
authority.
While
protecting
the
safety
of
Americans
is
a
top
priority
for
the
Subcommittee,
it
is
important
to
make
certain
CPSC
activity
is
supported
by
sound
data
and
engagement
with
manufacturers,
importers,
retailers
and
other
stakeholders.
During
the
hearing,
senators
from
both
sides
of
the
aisle
discussed
a
wide
range
of
issues
related
to
CPSC
rulemaking
and
jurisdiction,
including
expanded
surveillance
on
imported
goods
at
our
nation&#146;s
ports,
the
safety
risks
of
liquid
laundry
packets,
and
legislation
to
study
the
safety
concerns
of
recreational
off-highway
vehicles,
or
ROVs.
In
particular,
my
questioning
focused
on
the
issue
of
consumer
fireworks.
Every
Fourth
of
July
holiday,
thousands
of
American
consumers
are
critically
injured
using
fireworks,
and
yet
the
CPSC
has
not
updated
its
mandatory
fireworks
standards
in
many
years.
In
fact,
CPSC
staff
often
determines
which
fireworks
are
safe
on
the
basis
of
a
subjective
&#147;ear
test&#148;
related
to
the
sound
a
product
makes
when
detonated.
This
creates
additional
uncertainty
for
manufacturers
and
importers
who
struggle
to
predetermine
compliance
in
the
absence
of
measurable
scientific
standards.
I
strongly
encouraged
the
five
commissioners
to
make
the
development
of
objective
fireworks
testing
criteria
a
priority
of
the
agency,
and
have
been
assured
that
meaningful
progress
will
be
forthcoming.
I
look
forward
to
working
with
the
CPSC
and
my
colleagues
on
the
Senate
Commerce
Consumer
Protection
Subcommittee
in
the
future
to
further
explore
these
and
other
important
issues,
as
each
of
us
shares
the
common
goal
of
protecting
consumers
and
doing
what
we
can
to
prevent
tragic
injuries
or
fatalities
from
consumer
products.

Meeting
with
the
931st
Air
Refueling
Group
I
always
enjoy
meeting
with
Kansans
who
serve
in
our
Armed
Forces,
and
this
week
I
had
the
opportunity
to
catch
up
Colonel
Mark
Larson,
who
commands
the
931st
Air
Refueling
Group
stationed
at
McConnell
Air
Force
Base.
I
am
pleased
to
report
that
the
group
now
meets
the
threshold
to
transition
into
an
Air
Refueling
Wing,
which
will
give
them
the
resources
and
manning
necessary
to
fuel
the
new
KC-46A
tankers
arriving
at
McConnell
in
2017.
I
have
advocated
for
their
Wing
status
for
several
years
and
I
am
glad
that
the
transition
is
now
underway.
Kansas
Vietnam
Era
Veterans
Medallion
Ceremony
in
Independence
On
Saturday,
I
was
honored
to
be
the
keynote
speaker
at
a
ceremony
honoring
our
veterans
in
Independence.
In
conjunction
with
the
Kansas
Commission
on
Veterans
Affairs,
200
individuals
were
presented
with
the
Kansas
Vietnam
Era
Veterans
Medallion. These
brave
men
and
women
served
in
our
Armed
Forces
between
February
1961
and
May
1975. This
year,
as
we
commemorated
the
50th
anniversary
of
the
Vietnam
War,
it
is
fitting
that
we
honor
them.
During
the
Vietnam
War,
248
Medals
of
Honor
were
presented
to
our
American
troops
who
courageously
fought
for
our
freedom.
There
is
no
group
of
people
I
hold
in
higher
regard
than
our
nation&#146;s
troops
and
veterans
who
have
dedicated
their
lives
to
serving
our
country. Thanks
again
to
Kathy
Shepard
for
inviting
me
to
be
a
part
of
this
special
event.
Thanks
also
to
Ryon
Knop,
Jason
Sterling,
and
the
Kansas
Commission
on
Veterans
Affairs'
Gregg
Burden
and
Wayne
Bollig
for
assisting
with
the
ceremony.
The
day
also
included
a
parade,
preservation
workshop,
reunions
for
all
war
veterans
and
a
free
will
donation
dinner
and
auction.
Visiting
Southeast
Kansas
Hospitals
Also
on
Saturday,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
visit
two
community
hospitals
in
southeast
Kansas. My
first
stop
was
at
Coffeyville
Regional
Medical
Center
(CRMC).
CRMC
is
an
88-bed
acute
hospital
that
serves
on
an
annual
basis
more
than
45,000
patients
from
Montgomery,
Chautauqua,
Labette,
Allen,
Neosho,
and
Wilson
counties
in
Kansas,
as
well
as
Nowata
and
Craig
counties
in
Oklahoma.
I
shared
valuable
conversation
with
hospital
staff
and
administrators,
including
CRMC&#146;s
newly-appointed
CEO,
Mark
Woodring.
Mark
previously
served
as
associate
administrator
of
operations
at
Truman
Medical
Centers
in
Kansas
City,
Mo.
Mark
brings
valuable
experience
and
knowledge
in
health
care
management
to
the
CRMC
team.
Thanks
to
Mark
for
hosting
my
visit
and
to
all
the
members
of
the
CRMC
staff
and
board
of
trustees
for
attending.
I
appreciate
having
you
as
partners
in
the
effort
to
improve
the
quality
of
life
of
we
enjoy
in
our
Kansans
communities.
Next
I
visited
with
hospital
administrators
and
staff
at
Neosho
Memorial
Regional
Medical
Center
(NMRMC)
in
Chanute.
NMRMC
is
a
Critical
Access
Hospital
serving
Kansans
in
Neosho
County
and
the
surrounding
area
since
1951. Recently,
NMRMC
announced
it
received
a
five-star
rating
from
the
Centers
for
Medicare
and
Medicaid
Services
(CMS)
under
the
agency&#146;s
patient
satisfaction
survey.
I
enjoyed
visiting
with
NMRMC
staff
and
administrators
about
several
investments
the
hospital
is
making
to
enhance
patient
care,
including
a
new
state-of-the-art
mammography
unit,
and
plans
to
purchase
a
new
surgical
system
that
will
allow
for
the
performance
of
minimally
invasive
procedures.
Thanks
to
NMRMC
CEO
Dennis
Franks
for
hosting
my
visit.
During
my
time
representing
Kansans
in
Washington,
D.C.,
I&#146;ve
had
the
opportunity
to
visit
each
of
the
127
community
hospitals
in
our
state.
Each
of
my
visits
with
Kansas
health
care
providers
provide
me
with
useful
insight
on
their
efforts
to
provide
quality
care
to
patients,
often
across
wide
geographic
areas.
For
Coffeyville,
Chanute,
and
communities
like
them,
access
to
the
types
of
health
care
services
offered
by
these
community
hospitals
is
essential
because
access
to
quality
health
care
services
determines
whether
Kansans
can
remain
in
the
communities
they
call
home,
and
whether
their
children
can
return
to
raise
families
of
their
own.
Speaking
at
the
60th
anniversary
of
Iola
Industries,
Inc.
I
ended
the
week
in
Iola,
where
I
was
invited
to
present
the
keynote
address
at
the
60th anniversary
of
Iola
Industries,
Inc.
More
than
80
area
community
and
business
leaders
were
present
for
this
annual
meeting
to
celebrate
their
accomplishments
over
the
past
60
years.
First
incorporated
in
1955,
the
organization
promotes
industry
and
business
development
in
the
Iola
area. Iola
Industries
has
more
recently
become
interested
in
addressing
housing
concerns
in
Allen
County
and
continues
to
demonstrate
the
importance
of
a
community
believing
enough
in
itself
to
invest
for
current
and
future
generations.
Thanks
to
the
Iola
Industries
board
of
directors
for
the
invitation
to
participate
in
their
celebration,
and
to
Board
Chairperson
Mary
Kay
Heard
for
coordinating
my
visit
Thanks
also
