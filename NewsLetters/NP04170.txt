As 2014 draws to a close, I'd like to thank you for
staying connected to my office. My ability to represent our communities
in Congress is tied directly to how you and I communicate, and I ask
that you stay engaged with me in the new year through email, facebook
and twitter.
Moving forward into
2015,
I will continue my fight to help small businesses create jobs and
provide opportunity for the middle-class and those struggling to enter
it. If you have a moment, please fill out the short survey below and
tell me what you believe should be the main focus of Congress next
year.
I want to wish you and your family a
safe and happy holiday season. Thank you again for staying in touch and
please let me know if I can ever be of service. My door is always
open.
