Dear David,
Late last
year, I asked you to share your priorities for Congress in 2015. My
office received a high level of feedback that I will take to Washington
as I continue my work to help the private sector continue to create
well-paying jobs for the middle class. Please take a moment to
view the results of my 2015 Priorities
Survey
below:
Protect Social
Security &amp; Medicare: 17.9%
Rebuild Aging Infrastructure:
15.0%
Boost Job Creation &amp; Economic Growth: 13.7%
Reduce the
Debt &amp; Deficit: 11.9%
Clean Energy &amp; Protect the
Environment: 11.7%
Raise the Minimum Wage: 9.0%
Pass Comprehensive
Immigration Reform: 7.7%
All Other Issues:
13.1%
Thank you to those who participated in this
year's survey. My ability to represent you in Washington is directly tied
to how often we stay in touch.
By the
way, it's
never
too late to provide your feedback
or share your concerns with me. You can connect with me on
facebook ,
twitter ,
instagram ,
my website , or you can call one of
my offices. My door is always
open.
Thanks, as always, for reading.
