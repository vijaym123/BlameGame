New E-Newsletter
First of all, thank you for subscribing
to my E-Newsletter in which I will be
providing subscribers with a snapshot of
the weeks happenings. These weekly
updates aim provide you with insight into
what Congress is working on and how I am
making sure Nevadans voices are
heard. If you ever have any questions
please feel free to email me or contact any
one of my offices.
Week in Review
Yesterday, I filed
No
Budget, No Pay
as an amendment
to the Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS)
Appropriations bill, which is one of the
twelve funding bills that Congress is
supposed to pass every year. The amendment
calls on Congress to adopt legislation
requiring passage of a yearly budget and
all twelve appropriations bills each fiscal
year in order to receive pay. Nevadans work
hard for their paychecks and Congress
should too.
I also filed the
No
Funding for Blacklists
amendment, which prohibits any funding for
the purpose of establishing a blacklist of
American cities, likes Las Vegas and Reno,
from hosting federal agency and executive
branch conferences and conventions. In the
past government misconduct has threatened
Nevadas ability to host conferences.
Our state must not be a political target
due to government misbehavior, especially
at a time when we are still struggling to
recover financially.
While I was pleased to see the Senate
begin consideration of this appropriations
bill as part of a larger legislative
package encompassing other related
appropriations bills, further consideration
of the bill was temporarily suspended for
the near future. I am hopeful that
the Senate will have the opportunity to
once again consider this and all of its 12
appropriations bills before the end of the
fiscal year.
Last week, I held a roundtable
discussion with university and college
administrators, victim advocacy groups, and
other organizations as part of my ongoing
efforts to gather information and insight
on how to best address campus sexual
assault. The discussion was very helpful
and I was proud to stand with my colleagues
in introducing an amendment to the CJS
Appropriations Bill to help address campus
sexual assault and to make sure our
students are safe.
