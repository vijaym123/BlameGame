Washington, D.C.
Legislation introduced by U.S. Representative Scott Perry (PA-04) to preserve the Lincoln Train Station is expected to be passed by the U.S. Senate this week. If adopted by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama, it will be the first piece of legislation introduced by the freshman congressman to be signed into law. President Abraham Lincoln arrived at the Train Station on November 18, 1863, prior to delivering the Gettysburg Address the following day.
The Battle of Gettysburg marks a turning point in American history, said Rep. Perry. By preserving the Lincoln Train Station, I hope to inspire my fellow citizens to learn and appreciate the significance of the Gettysburg Campaign, the Gettysburg Address, the Civil War and the bravery of the soldiers who, in President Lincoln's words, "gave the last full measure of devotion. If the Senate and President Obama approve this as expected, Ill be privileged that my first piece of legislation signed into law will be to help protect the Gettysburg Battlefield.
Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Lincoln Train Station also served as a hospital during the Battle of Gettysburg, transporting wounded soldiers after the battle. The Lincoln Train Station is currently owned by the Gettysburg Foundation. The Borough of Gettysburg approached Gettysburg National Military Park (GNMP) about incorporating the station within GNMP to better ensure its preservation. The National Park Service plans to utilize the station as a downtown Gettysburg information center. The Gettysburg Foundation, a non-profit partner of the park, secured the funds necessary to purchase the train station from the Borough of Gettysburg and donate it to GNMP once the boundary legislation is passed.
Representative Perrys legislation was incorporated into the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2015, which passed the U.S. House by a vote of 300-119 on December 4th and is expected to pass the Senate later this week. It was originally introduced as H.R. 1513 on April 11, 2013. Rep. Perrys legislation also expands the boundaries of GNMP to include 45 acres of donated land along Plum Run in Cumberland Township. This property abuts land already owned by the National Park Service. Although both properties in question involve willing transactions, the legislation specifically forbids the use of eminent domain for acquisition of either property and will not utilize any federal funds.
In addition to preserving our heritage, such historic preservation and tourism efforts remain a critical part of the regional economy.
More than 235,000 visitors took part in 2013s events commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg and the dedication of the Soldiers National Cemetery, which contributed about $100 million to the local economy. In 2012, 3.4 million people visited Adams County and contributed $628 million to the economy.
We are very grateful to Congressman Scott Perry for his steadfast persistence and extra efforts, along with the actions of U.S. Senators Bob Casey and Pat Toomey, to shepherd this legislation to preserve the historic Lincoln Train Station, said Joanne M. Hanley, President of the Gettysburg Foundation. The Gettysburg Foundation is committed to serving as good stewards of this inspirational landmark. We stand ready to begin work with the National Park Service to take the steps necessary to transfer the property to them. This will enable us, together, to preserve the Lincoln Train Station for future generations to continue to be inspired in their lives by the stories from 151 years ago at Gettysburg.
Senators Casey and Toomey introduced legislation (S. 782) on April 23, 2013, which passed the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in November 2013.
In addition to the Gettysburg legislation, Rep. Perry has sponsored several measures that passed the U.S. House during his first term, including a bi-partisan amendment to reform State Department bureaucracy to better protect the lives of American diplomats serving overseas, and amendments condemning Russian violations of Ukrainian sovereignty; protecting chemical facilities from terrorist attacks; limiting government surveillance of citizens and reducing wasteful federal spending.
Residents of the 4th District are welcome to contact Congressman Perry and his staff at any of the offices or via Perry.House.Gov, where they can sign up for e-mail updates and for his Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages.
