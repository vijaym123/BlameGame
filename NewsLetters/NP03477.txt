Dear Friend,
With the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) operating under a
short-term measure that is set to expire soon, the House of
Representatives will consider legislation this week to authorize and
fund homeland security activities for the remainder of the fiscal year.
As Congress begins debate, I write today to ask for your thoughts and
feedback on the measure.
In short, the draft bill is an effort to stop the influx of illegal
immigrants at the border by redirecting resources into border control
and enforcement and "defunding" many of the Administration's executive
orders.
Click to read the bill summary.
Specifically, the draft bill contains more than $10 billion for Customs
and Border Protection (CBP) to deploy the largest operational force in
history: 21,370 Border Patrol agents and 23,775 CBP officers. It also
provides almost $6 billion for the Office of Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (ICE). While the Administration has sought to close ICE
detention facilities and release illegal immigrant detainees in US
communities, the bill mandates and provides funding for ICE to keep at
least 34,000 individual detention slots and 3,700 family detention
slots.
The most significant aspect of the legislation will be the following
amendments, which will be considered and debated individually.
Congressman Lou Barletta, former Mayor of Hazelton, PA, will offer the
main amendment. It will:
1. Prevent any funds from the Department of Homeland Security to carry
out the Executive actions announced by the President on November 20,
2014 which ended deportation actions of unlawfully present aliens;
2. Stop action on the four "Morton Memos" issued in 2011 and 2012 that
advanced "prosecutorial discretion," which fundamentally ended
longstanding immigration enforcement priorities, effectively preventing
certain classes of unlawfully present aliens from being removed from
the country;
3. Affirm that of the President's policies defunded by Congress, or any
substantially similar policies, have no statutory or constitutional
basis, and therefore, no legal effect;
4. Further stipulates that no funds may be used to carry out any
substantially similar policies to those defunded so the Administration
cannot rewrite Executive Orders to evade the intent of Congress or
continue with prosecutorial discretion;
5. Declares that no funds may be used to grant any Federal benefit to
any alien as a result of the policies defunded.
Another amendment, which will be separately debated, requires the
Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to put at the front of
the line for deportation of any illegal alien who is convicted of a
crime of child molestation, domestic violence, sexual abuse, or child
abuse.
Finally, another amendment from Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) will
overturn the Administration's "deferred action" policies, which took
effect in June 2012 and allow children who came to the United States
illegally to receive a deferment of two years on deportation, and to
apply for work authorization permits. Deferred action was described by
the President as a form of "prosecutorial discretion" so he could
implement the DREAM Act, which failed to be enacted by Congress. The
amendment prohibits any funds from being used to consider or renew any
deferred action applications, and would also apply to the November 20,
2014 action the President took to extend the period of deferred action
and work authorization permits from two years to three years.

Dear
Friend,
With
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
(DHS)
operating
under
a
short-term
measure
that
is set
to
expire
soon,
the
House
of
Representatives
will
consider
legislation
this
week
to
authorize
and
fund
homeland
security
activities
for
the
remainder
of
the
fiscal
year.
As
Congress
begins
debate,
I
write
today
to
ask
for
your
thoughts
and
feedback
on
the
measure.
In
short,
the
draft
bill
is
an
effort
to
stop
the
influx
of
illegal
immigrants
at
the
border
by
redirecting
resources
into
border
control
and
enforcement
and
"defunding"
many
of
the
Administration's
executive
orders.
Click
to
read
the
bill
summary.
Specifically,
the
draft
bill
contains
more
than
$10
billion
for
Customs
and
Border
Protection
(CBP)
to
deploy
the
largest
operational
force
in
history:
21,370
Border
Patrol
agents
and
23,775
CBP
officers.
It
also
provides
almost
$6
billion
for
the
Office
of
Immigration
and
Customs
Enforcement
(ICE). While
the
Administration
has
sought
to
close
ICE
detention
facilities
and
release
illegal
immigrant
detainees
in
US
communities,
the
bill
mandates
and
provides
funding
for
ICE
to
keep
at
least
34,000
individual
detention
slots
and
3,700
family
detention
slots.
The
most
significant
aspect
of
the
legislation
will
be
the
following
amendments,
which
will
be
considered
and
debated
individually.
Congressman
Lou
Barletta,
former
Mayor
of
Hazelton,
PA,
will
offer
the
main
amendment.
It
will:
1.
Prevent
any
funds
from
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
to
carry
out
the
Executive
actions
announced
by
the
President
on
November
20,
2014
which
ended
deportation
actions
of
unlawfully
present
aliens;
2.
Stop
action
on
the
four
"Morton
Memos "
issued
in
2011
and
2012
that
advanced
"prosecutorial
discretion,"
which
fundamentally
ended
longstanding
immigration
enforcement
priorities,
effectively
preventing
certain
classes
of
unlawfully
present
aliens
from
being
removed
from
the
country;
3.
Affirm
that
of
the
President's
policies
defunded
by
Congress,
or
any
substantially
similar
policies,
have
no
statutory
or
constitutional
basis,
and
therefore,
no
legal
effect ;
4.
Further
stipulates
that
no
funds
may
be
used
to
carry
out
any
substantially
similar
policies
to
those
defunded
so
the
Administration
cannot
rewrite
Executive
Orders
to
evade
the
intent
of
Congress
or
continue
with
prosecutorial
discretion;
5.
Declares
that
no
funds
may
be
used
to
grant
any
Federal
benefit
to
any
alien
as
a
result
of
the
policies
defunded.
Another
amendment,
which
will
be
separately
debated,
requires
the
Secretary
of
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
to
put
at
the
front
of
the
line
for
deportation
of
any
illegal
alien
who
is
convicted
of
a
crime
of
child
molestation,
domestic
violence,
sexual
abuse,
or
child
abuse.
Finally,
another
amendment
from
Rep.
Marsha
Blackburn
(R-TN)
will
overturn
the
Administration's
"deferred
action"
policies,
which
took
effect
in
June
2012
and
allow
children
who
came
to
the
United
States
illegally
to
receive
a
deferment
of
two
years
on
deportation,
and
to
apply
for
work
authorization
permits.
Deferred
action
was
described
by
the
President
as
a
form
of
"prosecutorial
discretion"
so
he
could
implement
the
DREAM
Act,
which
failed
to
be
enacted
by
Congress.
The
amendment
prohibits
any
funds
from
being
used
to
consider
or
renew
any
deferred
action
applications,
and
would
also
apply
to
the
November
20,
2014
action
the
President
took
to
extend
the
period
of
deferred
action
and
work
authorization
permits
from
two
years
to
three
years.
