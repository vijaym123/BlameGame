Dear
Friend,
This week afforded
me the great opportunity to get around the district and talk with as
many people as I could. We had a great time in Cornelia on Friday where
we were able to have a casual lunch and help a lot of people with
casework issues they're having with federal agencies.
If
you think my office can ever be of assistance with issues you may be
having with the Social Security Administration, the VA, your passport
or visa, or any other questions you might have,
let me know .
My Gainesville
office is staffed with constituent services experts who can help you get
answers, and all of us are here to help!
I'm sure you know
that the State of the Union is Tuesday night at 9:00.
I want to
encourage you to watch, because a speech to Congress is, in fact, a
speech to you because we're here to represent you.
I've invited a Hall County constituent
to be my guest that evening for that very reason.
After
it's over, tell me how you feel by
e-mailing me , tweeting
@RepDougCollins , or on
Facebook .
We'll be in
touch!
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of Congress
