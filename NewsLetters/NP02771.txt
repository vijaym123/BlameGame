David -- Citizens United
opened the door for the Koch brothers&rsquo; outside groups to spend millions to influence last year&rsquo;s elections.
Now, the Kochs&rsquo; network is gearing up to spend nearly $1 billion in 2016. That&rsquo;s
unprecedented .
Cheri believes Illinois voters should decide our elections -- not out-of-state billionaires. But if we&rsquo;re going to bring an end to
Citizens United , it&rsquo;ll take a tremendous grassroots effort.
