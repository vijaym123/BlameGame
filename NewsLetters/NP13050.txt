Dear Friend,
On December 28, roughly 1.3 million American workers lost crucial
unemployment insurance benefits - cutting off a vital lifeline families
rely on to make ends meet while they look for a job.
I sent three letters urging House Speaker Boehner to allow a vote to
extend unemployment benefits. It is the right thing to do for millions
of Americans who are trying to support their families, and it is the
right thing to do for our economy. As your representative in Congress,
I want to hear from you on this issue.
Should Congress extend unemployment insurance?
Yes
No
Don't Know
Survey link
California's unemployment rate remains above the national average at
8.9 percent, and there are still 1.3 million fewer jobs than there were
before the Great Recession. While our economy continues to recover from
the economic downturn, American families searching for a job should not
be left out in the cold. Fill out this survey to let me know what you
think.
As always, it is an honor to represent you in the U.S. Congress. Please
do not hesitate to contact my East Bay offices to let us know how we
can help at 925-460-5100 or 510-370-3322. For questions or comments
regarding federal legislation, contact my Washington, DC office at
202-225-5065.
