David, I ran for Congress to fight for you.
That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so disturbing an outside group led by Karl Rove released a deceptive attack campaign targeting me.
Wow. How desperate.
We must get out the facts to Illinois voters -- before Mr. Rove&rsquo;s lies take hold. So I&rsquo;m asking for your support: please chip in to our Democratic campaign before tonight&rsquo;s public fundraising deadline.
Every dollar helps. http://action.cheribustos.com/Donate-Here
