WASHINGTON DC
U.S. Rep. Gregg Harper (R-Miss.) made the following remarks today after the House of Representatives passed the Senate legislation authorizing construction of the KeystoneXL oil pipeline:
The American people have waited long enough for the KeystoneXL pipeline to be approved, said Harper. Today, House and Senate Republicans continued their commitment to push forward with this shovel-ready, jobs-creating project and continue to do their job by putting Americans to work and ensuring reliable energy from friendly sources. With hardworking, middle-class families still struggling to get by, that should give the President plenty of cause to reconsider his veto threat and sign this bill into law.
