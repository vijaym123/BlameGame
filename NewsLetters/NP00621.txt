Over the years, decades, and centuries of American existence, our peace and prosperity
and our future
have always rested on the shoulders of the servicemen and women who are willing to sacrifice so much for the cause of liberty. From General Cornwallis surrender at Yorktown, signifying the end of the Revolutionary War, to the present day War on Terror, these individuals have selflessly fought for freedom on behalf of their fellow countrymen. This May, we recognize Military Appreciation Month, and I hope that all of you will take an opportunity to thank our men and women in uniform and support them in any way you can. We have survived and prospered for more than 200 years because they have made it their duty to defend our liberty. Remembering and acknowledging the debt we owe to them is the least we can do. This and every month, let's say "thank you" to our service members.
Congress plays an intrinsic role in supporting our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines and Coast Guardsmen each and every day. I believe we have a constitutional duty to ensure they are effectively resourced. As Chairman of the House Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee, I remain committed to doing everything I can to ensure that the policies coming out of Washington ensure our military has the training, resources, and equipment needed to accomplish its missions. I also believe that we must support them when they return home, which is why I have supported measures aimed at restoring accountability at the VA and ensuring veterans timely access to quality health care, as well as providing greater stability for military families. The First District is home to a significant number of active duty service members and veterans, and I am humbled to serve them.
Recently, I was proud to recognize another group of individuals whose selflessness is instrumental in the important work of this nation: our federal workforce. I introduced a
resolution
this month to express support for our public servants and to commend them for their dedication and continued service to the U.S. during Public Service Recognition Week. This week of appreciation served as a great opportunity to thank our dedicated federal employees, both past and present, for their devoted efforts on behalf of the citizens of the United States. From the CIA agents and Defense Department civilians who complement the work of our military, to the Border Control agents fighting illegal immigration, human trafficking, and drug-running operations, our federal workforce is full of individuals who value service above self. Without them, this nation would not be what it is today, and I thank them for their service.
The main streets of Virginias First District are full of ideas to get our economy back on track, and your feedback is critically important to me as I serve you. I can be reached by telephone at (202) 225-4261, through my website ( www.wittman.house.gov ), on Facebook ( www.facebook.com/reprobwittman ), and via Twitter ( www.twitter.com/robwittman ).
