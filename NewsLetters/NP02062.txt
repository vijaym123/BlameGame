Kagman Community Health Center Board President Velma Palacios, Board member Maria Torres, and Executive Director Vince Castro were among the Community Health Center officers from the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Yap, Palau, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, who made their annual visit to the congressional office this week. The Kagman Community Health Center will be celebrating its second anniversary in April and has been a welcome source of primary care for residents of Kagman, San Vicente, and other areas of Saipan with fees as low as $5 for those without insurance.
Tinian office reopens full-time - Residents of Tinian have full-time access to their congressional office again. Mr. Edward Hofschneider has been hired as the Tinian Field Representative/Caseworker and began daily operations on Tinian this week after receiving two days of orientation and training at the Saipan District Office. Making the services of the congressional office easily available to constituents on Tinian and Rota, as well as Saipan, was a goal I established when I was first began serving in 2009. The Tinian office can supply application materials and information about Social Security and other federal programs and is a convenient intake point for anyone having a problem with receipt of services from the federal government. The office is open Monday to Friday from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM and is located in the Villagomez Building, just a few doors down from the office of the Mayor of Tinian. The phone is (670) 433-2647, and you may always contact me directly at kilili@mail.house.gov .

Subcommittee looks at Presidents budget for Insular Affairs - The Subcommittee on Indian, Insular, and Alaska Native Affairs, examined President Obamas fiscal 2016 budget proposal
for the Interior Departments Office of Insular Affairs this week. It includes $9.6 million for capital improvement projects in the Northern Mariana Islands, a slight increase over fiscal 2015. The budget also proposes $7 million and 2 staff positions for a new Resilient Insular Areas fund to help island governments plan for climate change. In my view this $7 million could be better invested in existing programs that already address the causes and effects of climate change. For instance, Interiors Empowering Insular Communities program, which has provided $560,000 to the Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation and $440,000 to our Public School System for solar power systems, help reduce the use of fossil fuels. More of this investment in locally produced power would not only reduce carbon emissions that cause global warming, but also keep more money in our local economy.

Edward Lynch, Senior Vice President of HDR Inc., and CDR Joan Malik and John VanName of the U.S. Navy briefed staff at the Saipan District Office this week on the Mariana Islands Training and Testing Environmental Impact Statement/Overseas Environmental Impact Statement.
Promoting job training assistance for the Northern Marianas - The House Education and the Workforce Committee took testimony from Labor Secretary Thomas Perez this week on the fiscal year 2016 budget proposal for his department. Last June, Secretary Perez made the decision to extend the CW foreign worker program in the Commonwealth for another five years. In my prepared statement I urged him to follow through with technical assistance, financial resources, and advice and expertise to help the Commonwealth transition from an economy dependent on foreign labor to one that provides full and well-paid employment for U.S. workers. I also set out this general principle in commenting on the American Technical Training Fund, a job training program the budget proposes: in creating new programs or administering those already on the books we have to be sure that Americans living in non-state areas of our nation, who face economic challenges as great or greater than other Americans, receive from the Department of Labor equivalent assistance to improve their lives.
