Blaine's Bulletin
Over the past few weeks, many of you have made it clear how concerned you are about national security, homeland security, and specifically, the conflict involving the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL). I firmly believe providing for the common defense of our nation is a fundamental duty that our Constitution requires, and it is a responsibility that I take seriously.
As you know, the Sunni insurgent group known as ISIL has started to take control of a number of cities in Syria and Western Iraq by extreme force. This conflict has displaced thousands of families and cost too many lives. The group is also responsible for the kidnapping and brutal murder of two American journalists. In a relatively short amount of time, this terrorist organization has shown the extreme lengths it is willing to go in order to attain power, giving clear evidence that the war on terror is far from over.
The threat that ISIL poses to America must be defeated which is why Congress acted and passed legislation to allow the United States to act to degrade these terrorist groups.
The House of Representatives passed legislation which authorizes the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of State, to train and equip appropriately-vetted elements of the Syrian opposition and other highly-screened Syrian groups or individuals. This proposal strengthens Congressional oversight by requiring detailed progress reports on the overall plan and vetting process, and requires the President to report on how this authority would fit into a larger regional strategy.
However, this amendment does not authorize new funds, does not authorize the introduction of United States ground troops into combat situations, and does not supersede the obligation for the President to report to Congress under section 4 of the War Powers Resolution.
Moving forward, Congress must make sure President Obama is held accountable of his efforts and intents. It is vital that that Congress and the Administration have an ongoing dialogue about his authority and the steps he intends to take to defeat these extremist groups.
Around the world today, there is immense instability and insecurity. If a terrorist group poses a threat to our nations homeland or our allies, America must step up and lead, not sit on the sideline.
As our brave men and women continue to serve overseas, they deserve our full and unwavering support. The security we all enjoy is a direct result of their selfless sacrifice. Those men and women deserve to know that when an order is given, their country will stand with them in support of their service.
