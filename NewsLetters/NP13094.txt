Dear friend,
This week, I
voted against the FY 2014 Omnibus spending bill .
The Omnibus
which funds discretionary programs for the current fiscal
year
guts the so-called sequester, a law Congress passed in 2011
to cap discretionary spending.
While the sequester
wasnt perfect, it forced Congress to start making the tough choices
to rein in spending and get our fiscal house in order.
Since the
sequester was signed into law, discretionary spending has shrunk by
the largest amount in decades, the deficit has been cut in half, and
the economy has grown at a faster rate.
The Omnibus reverses
much of that progress, spending $45 billion above the budget caps
that were already agreed to.
The Omnibus is Washington at its worst
a 1,582-page bill stuffed with pork, ineffective programs and
giveaways, being rushed through Congress without proper review.

compilation of the worst aspects of the bill.
Some of the things
youll be spending on include
Obamacare funding of
abortion coverage
The UN Population
Fund
Hidden green handouts
Obsolete rural
programs
TARP bailouts
Another troubling aspect of
the Omnibus is that, while it increases overall spending by $45
billion, it doesnt have a single dime for the Payments in Lieu of Taxes
(PILT) program. Every county in Idaho receives PILT payments and many of
them rely on PILT to meet their basic budget
needs.
While House Leadership is promising to include PILT in future
legislation, it should have been included in this weeks bill to benefit
Idahos counties as soon as possible.
Congress should keep its
commitment to Idahos counties.
I will continue to work hard
for fiscally-responsible legislation that is also fair and equitable
to our state.
