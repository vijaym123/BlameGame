"Remember the Maine"
Senator Collins traveled to Cuba last week
with Senators Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Pat Roberts (R-KS) to meet with
officials regarding the changing relationship between the American and
Cuban governments.
While in Cuba, Senator Collins visited the U.S.S. Maine Memorial in
remembrance of those who lost their lives on one of the first American
battleships. In 1898, the U.S.S. Maine was sent to Cuba to protect the
interests of Americans after a rebellion against Spanish rule. The
Naval Ship exploded and sank on February 15, 1898, killing 267
Americans. Although the cause of the explosion that sank the U.S.S.
Maine has never definitively been determined, the event was the climax
of pre-war tension between the United States and Spain.

Senator Collins Raises Concerns Following OPM Data Breach
Following reports earlier this month that a massive cyber-attack on the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) had breached the personal
information of millions of Americans, Senator Collins renewed her call
for
improved cyber security, It is time for us to take action to better
protect the
critical infrastructure this nation depends
upon. As a leading voice for reforming cyber security, this has been a
consistent refrain for Senator Collins throughout her time in the
Senate and as a current member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
This week, Senator Collins received a letter from OPM
informing her that her personal data
was compromised in the hack of OPMs databases. Senator Collins is
among millions of Americans who received letters this week informing
them that their information fell victim to hackers in this recent
cyber-attack.
Sen. Susan Collins May Have Had Info Stolen in Hack on Government
>From NBC News
A key member of the Senate Intelligence Committee has been
informed she is likely among the millions of federal government workers
whose personal information was stolen in a cyberattack on the Office of
Personnel Management, according to a letter obtained by NBC News.
Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, received a letter from the
OPM's chief information officer Wednesday informing her that Social
Security number, date and place of birth, and current or former address
may have been compromised in the hack disclosed last week.
"You are receiving this notification because we have determined that
the data compromised in this incident may have included your personal
information," the letter to Collins reads, "Please be assured that OPM
remains deeply committed to protecting the privacy and security of
information and has taken the appropriate steps to respond to this
intrusion."

A Senate Health, Education Labor and Pensions Committee hearing this
week investigated ways to improve the Electronic Health Record system
program. During the hearing, Senator Collins highlighted concerns about
the program expressed by physicians across Maine and asked the panel,
comprised of leaders in the medical community, about ways to make
improvements and alleviate burdens to physicians.
An electronic health record (EHR) is a digital version of a patients
paper chart. Current government programs incentivize certain health
care providers to incorporate EHR's into the patient-physician
experience. After receiving feedback from physicians in Maine, Senator
Collins expressed concerns about the amount of time the program takes
away from the crucial face-to-face interaction that physicians value
with their patients. She also raised questions about the cost of the
program noting, "A physician in Maine, a gastroenterologist, who has a
very small practice, said that he was looking at cost in excess of
$200,000 in order to adopt the latest electronic health record for his
small practice. Thats no small amount.
Senator Collins Welcomes Library of Congress Junior Fellow to Washington
Senator Collins welcomed Columbia University student and Blue Hill
native, Lucy Jakub to Washington, D.C. this week. Lucy was selected as
one of 37 college students chosen from more than 800 applicants to
serve as a Library of Congress Junior Fellow, working in the Librarys
Conservation Division.
Senator Collins Congratulates Maine's "National History Day" Winners in
Washington
Senator Susan Collins met with students from across Maine to wish them
luck as they competed in the final round of
the National History Day
contest hosted in Washington, D.C. this week. More than three hundred
students from thirty-six schools across Maine participated in the
statewide National History Day competition at the University of Maine
on March 28. Following victories in the Maine competition, these
students represented Maine and competed alongside nearly 3,000 of
Americas top young historians.
Two students from Holbrook Middle School, Ceci Doering and Damian
Sheffer created a website that explored, The Career of Margaret Chase
Smith: A Legacy That Paved The Way For Women In Politics. As part of
their project, Ceci and Damian interviewed Senator Collins in February.
Weekly Column
"Ringing Off the Hook: The Proliferation of Unwanted Calls"
By: Senator Susan Collins
When Congress passed legislation creating the National Do Not Call
Registry in 2003, we thought we had put an end to the plague of
unwelcome telemarketers who were interrupting Americans morning, noon,
and night. But now, nearly twelve years later, phones are once again
ringing off the hook.
Too many of us can relate to the frustration that results from high
volumes of unwanted and disruptive calls. Yet, signing up for the Do
Not Call list doesnt seem to make a difference in far too many cases.
In addition, advances in technology, such as robocalls, the ability to
disguise, or spoof a caller ID, and Voice Over Internet Protocol
(VoIP), are making it easier for scammers to reach potential victims.
I recently chaired a Senate Aging Committee hearing to examine the
proliferation of unwanted calls and whether the Do Not Call Registry is
still effective. One of our witnesses was Linda Blase, a small business
owner from Dallas, Texas, who had become so frustrated and overwhelmed
by junk calls that she kept a log of them.
Over the course of just one month, she said she received 74 unwanted
calls, 62 of which were robocalls. From telephone calls from scammers
claiming to be from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Federal
Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and robocalls soliciting home security
systems and home mortgages, to a call from someone trying to sell her
an ATM machine for her home-based business, the calls keep coming. Ms.
Blase has been trying for years to stop these calls through complaints
to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), complaints to the Consumers
Union, and by registering for the Do Not Call list. Yet, her unwanted
calls have not only continued, they have increased.

Yet,
signing

for

In
