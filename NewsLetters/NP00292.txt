Yesterday, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio) was in Columbus, Ohio to
accept the "Medicare Part D Patient Access Champion Award" from the
Alliance for Patient Access and the National Association of Nutrition
and Aging Services Programs in partnership with other national, state,
and local health care advocacy organizations.
"Seniors across our state chose one of the 33 available Medicare Part D
plans in Ohio," said Portman. "Many rely on these plans for quality and
affordable drug coverage each year, and I am honored to accept this
award as recognition that patient access to this program is critical
and must have the full support of Congress."
The Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage provides affordable
access to prescription drugs for over 36 million Medicare
beneficiaries. The Part D program, which has maintained stable,
affordable average monthly premiums, enjoys a 90 percent approval
rating among beneficiaries, and has costs that are more than 40 percent
below original Congressional Budget Office projections.
Portman also hosted a federal resource informational business seminar
for small business owners throughout the Buckeye Lake region to meet
directly with federal agency representatives and to learn about various
resources that are available. In addition, small business counselors
were on hand to assist on developing strategic business plans for
future opportunities.
Last year, Portman held a roundtable at Buckeye Lake Marina in
Millersport, Ohio to discuss his legislation, the Harmful Algal Blooms
and Hypoxia Research and Control Amendments Act of 2013
, which was signed into law by President Obama. The bill
reauthorized the Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) and Hypoxia Research and
Control Act, which was first enacted in 1998 and reauthorized in 2004
and 2008.
For over a decade this program has served as the federal
government's research and response framework for harmful algal blooms.
Portman negotiated a new fresh water section for the program that will
ensure federal agencies prioritize monitoring and mitigation efforts on
fresh water bodies such as Buckeye Lake.
Prior to his roundtable,
Portman surveyed the lake from a boat where he was joined by local
stakeholders.
On Sunday, Portman, along with Jane Portman, will participate in the
8th Annual Ride Cincinnati. The annual ride raises funds for breast
cancer research at The Barrett Cancer Center. The Portmans served as
honorary co-chairs of the ride 4 years ago and are doing so again this
year.
The Portmans at Ride Cincinnati in 2011
"Jane and I are honored to support Ride Cincinnati again this year, and
I look forward to joining friends from the Greater Cincinnati region to
raise funds and awareness for the cause," said Senator Portman. "Cancer
has affected us all in one way or another. I lost my own mom to a rare
form of cancer 20 years ago, and Jane lost her mother to breast cancer.
We congratulate Ride Cincinnati on a successful event this year and
applaud them for their continued fight against breast cancer."
"I lost my mother to breast cancer when she was 51 years old, back in
1986," said Jane Portman. "My sister Sally was diagnosed and
successfully treated for breast cancer at age 45 just last year, 28
years after our mom's death. Slowly but surely, we are seeing progress
in the battle against breast cancer. Awareness and education and
treatment are all improving, thanks to the work of doctors and
researchers at UC's Barrett Cancer Center who are fighting this
important fight."
This week, the Senate resumed consideration of the National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2016.
On Tuesday, Portman announced that he filed an amendment to the NDAA
to examine the feasibility of providing mental health screenings for
servicemembers prior to enlistment and discharge from service.
"We must promote a more comprehensive approach to mental health care in
the military that improves upon the current system to deliver the best
care possible," Portman stated. "My amendment will help focus the
military's efforts to pursue these goals and serve as the foundation
for future efforts on this issue. I believe this amendment represents
an important step towards ensuring our servicemembers receive the care
they deserve and will continue to work for adoption to this critical
legislation."
Portman is the author of the Medical Evaluation Parity for
Servicemembers (MEPS) Act
, which he introduced with Senator Martin Heinrich (D-NM) in
March. This bipartisan legislation would improve the way the military
identifies and assesses mental health issues by instituting mental
health assessments for all incoming recruits. The entry screening would
serve as a baseline for future mental health assessments throughout
servicemembers' careers and would help provide early detection and
treatment of potential mental health issues requiring treatment, a
critical part of effective mental health care. Significant elements of
the bill requiring DoD to consult with mental health experts and begin
developing screening options were already incorporated into the
underlying legislation reported out of the Armed Services Committee in
May.
Text of the amendment can be found here
.
Portman also announced that he filed a bipartisan amendment
that would help increase opportunities
for small businesses as well as prevent government waste and fraudulent
transactions by improving the government construction procurement
process.
The design-build process can be expensive for both industry and
government clients, which could reduce participation by the best design
firms which incur much of the cost in these competitions, frequently
without reimbursement. Streamlining the design-build process will
benefit government agencies by limiting the second phase of competition
to the strongest teams, requiring less time and fewer resources to
evaluate proposals.
By addressing the anti-competitive and efficiency issues with reverse
auction procurement for design and construction services, encouraging
better utilization of design-build project delivery, and providing
financial certainty to assets that support individual surety bonds,
this amendment provides a framework for growth in the construction
industry and encourages more efficient federal government procurement
through simple, no cost to the government solutions. This amendment is
cosponsored by U.S. Senator Mazie Hirono (D- Hawaii).
"The design-build process often gets bogged down with unnecessary
government regulations, costing small businesses time and money,"
Portman stated. "My amendment will streamline this process and expand
opportunities for companies participating in these contracts."
A one-page summary of the amendment can be found here
.
Also on Tuesday, Portman, a former U.S. Trade Representative, submitted
testimony to the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC)
to support the United
Steelworkers' (USW) trade enforcement case on passenger vehicle and
light truck tires imported from China. Portman writes that, "The
increases in Chinese imports came at the direct expense of our domestic
tire industry." He urges a close examination of the case to help level
the playing field for Ohio tire workers to compete and win.
Portman got involved with this case after meeting with USW workers from
Cooper Tire in Findlay earlier this year to discuss the challenges
posed by imported Chinese tires that violate trade laws. Following that
meeting, Portman sent a letter in February to the U.S. Secretary of
Commerce
urging
the Administration to closely study this case.
Portman with USW Local 207L President Rod Nelson
"We applaud the support of Senator Portman on the tire tariffs along
with Senator Sherrod Brown," said USW Local 207L President Rod Nelson.
"It just goes to show you, at least in Ohio, our elected senators have
got the back of the their constituents and will fight to level the
playing field for the hard working people in their state. This sends a
message to China; if you don't play by the international trade rules
then you will be punished until you do.
American workers can compete
with anybody anywhere in the world as long as the competition remains
fair and follows the rules. Thanks to Senator Portman for sticking up
for the hard working people at the Cooper Tire plant in Findlay, Ohio."
Portman has a long record of standing up for Ohio workers impacted by
illegally subsidized and undersold imports.
He has worked hand-in-hand
with Ohio workers who manufacture pipe and tube products
, hot-rolled steel
, rebar
and other products.
Portman and U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown
(D-Ohio) led the charge on a bipartisan measure that passed the Senate
last month
to allow
American workers to more easily get relief from these illegal trade
practices.
Portman's testimony can be found here
.
On Wednesday, Portman urged passage of the NDAA
and
discussed the need to address growing national security threats around
the world, including continued Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine.
Portman urged adoption of his amendments that will help the U.S. better
assist the Ukrainians as they defend their sovereignty.
Full video can be found here
.
The first amendment
modifies a section of the NDAA that authorizes $300 million in
military assistance to Ukraine. This section, as amended, directs the
Secretary of Defense to provide a number of critical capabilities the
Ukrainians need to defend themselves, including real-time intelligence,
counter-artillery radars, defensive lethal assistance, UAVs, secure
communications, and training to develop key combat, planning, and
support capabilities. Half of that $300 million is fenced off until at
least $60 million is spent on the most important capabilities the
Ukrainians need and have requested: real-time intelligence, defensive
lethal assistance, and counter-artillery radars. If the Administration
fails to use this money for the purposes specified, they must use it to
support other nations facing an increased risk of Russian aggression.
The second amendment
studies the implications of the conflict in Ukraine for the U.S.
military. It would require an assessment of U.S. and NATO efforts in
eastern Ukraine based on lessons learned from the tactics, techniques,
and procedures used by the Russians and separatists. This assessment
will include, among other things, a report of the implications of
Russia's information war and the implications the conflict has for
armored warfare equipment, such as Abrams tanks made in Lima, Ohio.
On Social Media:
Senator Rob Portman: Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act
More than 24 million Americans struggle with substance abuse and
addiction. They are our neighbors, friends and family members, and they
need our support. The drugs being abused change, but the results are
the same. These drugs rob people of the chance to reach their God-given
potential. Today, heroin use is on the rise in Ohio and throughout the
country, and without proper intervention and treatment, lives, families
and communities are devastated. Often this leads to a downward spiral
that turns into criminal activity, time behind bars, or even worse;
ends with an overdose.
Addressing substance abuse has always been a top priority of mine and
as the founder of the Coalition for a Drug-Free Cincinnati, and as a
leader in Congress on legislation to combat drug use, I have met many
people who have been personally impacted by addiction. Some received
the help they needed and were able to make a recovery. Others were not
as fortunate. We must focus on what works to turn back this alarming
trend.
In my experience, I have learned that a comprehensive, evidence-based
approach is needed. We should all support prevention and education
efforts to avoid addiction and the struggles it entails. But we also
need more effective treatment and recovery efforts to deal with those
struggling with addiction disorders. We know that addiction is a
disease, but that only about 11 percent of those needing treatment get
it, unlike other diseases. Finally, I have seen that a local,
grassroots approach to prevention and treatment is most effective. In
order to combat substance abuse and help get more people on the road to
recovery, we must offer solutions that go beyond a top down, one size
fits all approach. We must take a comprehensive approach and start from
the bottom up. That is the focus of a bill I introduced, called the
Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2015.
This legislation is designed to provide a variety of resources and
incentives to better address addiction in a number of ways. It does so
by using evidence-based, tested methods to expand treatment and
increases educational efforts aimed at teens, parents, and other
caretakers with the goal of stopping drug abuse before it ever starts.
The bill expands disposal sites for unwanted prescription medications
to keep them out of the hands of children and adolescents. It also
expands the availability of a drug called Naxolone to law enforcement
agencies and other first responders to help in the reversal of
overdoses in order to save lives.
It is understandable that for some, fighting drug abuse may seem like a
battle that cannot be won, but that's because we have not really tried
what we know can work. If we are going to be successful in helping all
Americans achieve their dreams in life, and avoid the devastating
impact of drug abuse, we need to try new and innovative ways to
confront its challenges. By taking a comprehensive approach, relying on
the evidence of what works, and implementing it at the local level, I
strongly believe the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act will help
us meet those challenges and lead more people on the road to recovery.

Here's What's Stunting U.S. Growth and Global Competitiveness
Sen. Rob Portman, the Ohio Republican who serves on the Senate Finance
Committee and exercises considerable influence within the Senate's
Republican caucus, urged his fellow lawmakers to get serious about
reforming the U.S. tax code Tuesday, saying that the corporate sector
is already being "hollowed out" because of competition from lower-tax
countries.
Speaking at a legislative seminar sponsored by the law firm
BakerHostetler in Washington, Portman said, "We're not seeing the kind
of economic growth we've always seen coming out of a recession." One of
the reasons, he said is that an antiquated tax code that hasn't been
"meaningfully reformed since 1986" is hurting competitiveness.
Since that time, he said, "every other country" the U.S. competes with
has reformed their codes, leading U.S. companies to consider move
overseas where their profits are more lightly taxed.
"By the time we get to it, which may be two or three years from now
probably, to be practical, after a new administration comes in and a
new Congress, we're going to see a hollowing out of a lot of
corporations in our country, and we'll look back and say, 'What
happened?'" he said.
("Here's What's Stunting U.S. Growth and Global Competitiveness," Rob
Garver. Fiscal Times
. June 10, 2015.)
Senators call for more aid to Ukraine
Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) called for more U.S. aid to Ukraine, after
senators met with a Ukrainian official to discuss the ongoing crisis.
Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk met with the Senate Ukraine
Caucus co-chaired by Durbin and Rob Portman (R-Ohio). Sens. Amy
Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.)
also attended the meeting.
Tuesday's meeting comes after Durbin traveled to Ukraine last month to
meet with officials, including Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko,
and U.S. service members who are helping train the country's military.
He said during Tuesday's meeting Yatsenyuk "made it clear" that the
country needs more military aid, including weapons, and economic
support.
The administration, so far, has been hesitant to provide Ukraine with
lethal aid. But, late last month, Vice President Joe Biden said whether
or not to provide lethal arms to Ukraine was a "debate worth having."
Tensions between the United States and Russia have been running high
since Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. The United States and
other Western countries have also hit Russia with sanctions, and
accused Russian President Vladimir Putin's government of backing
separatist fighters in eastern Ukraine.
Russia has denied those allegations.

Paying the elderly to stay healthy makes sense
C'mon, grandma, work that body.
That's one way to encourage older citizens to get healthy, but perhaps
a more effective way is to reward them for achieving healthy lifestyle
goals.
That's the intent of legislation U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, Republican of
Ohio, expects to reintroduce later this year. It would allow Medicare
patients to set healthy goals and, if they meet them, to receive modest
payouts from the government.
Portman envisions that a patient could earn as little as $100 after two
years or as much as $400 after three years. Then, of course, there
would be the nonmonetary gratification of having the best vitals on the
assisted-living floor.
A pilot program that incorporates some of the proposed Medicare
health-lifestyle benchmarking, but not the monetary rewards, is being
carried by the Peter B. Lewis Aquatic and Therapy Center at the Menorah
Park Center for Senior Living in Beachwood. The senior-living center
offers initial wellness exams and then works with those so interested
to develop goals and the means to achieve them. Menorah Park will
provide feedback on how the Medicare program can be set up.
The idea had bipartisan support when it was introduced in 2013 as the
Medicare Better Health Rewards Program Act, although it was not
enacted. Both Republicans and Democrats should see the merit to
offering incentives to older Americans that should result in healthier
living and less reliance on Medicare.
While the program won't put an end to rising health care costs, it
could be a cost-effective way to encourage preventive medicine and
other practices to help stave off the chronic diseases that can lead to
huge health care outlays later in life.

Yesterday,
U.S.
Senator
Rob
Portman
(R-Ohio)
was
in
Columbus,
Ohio
to
accept
the
&#8220;Medicare
Part
D
Patient
Access
Champion
Award&#8221;
from
the
Alliance
for
Patient
Access
and
the
National
Association
of

Programs
in
partnership
with
other
national,
state,

advocacy
organizations.
&#8220;Seniors
across
our
state
chose
one
of
the
33
available
Medicare
Part
D
plans
in
Ohio,&#8221;
said
Portman.
&#8220;Many
rely
on
these
plans
for
quality
and
affordable
drug
coverage
each
year,
and
I
am
honored
to
accept
this
award
as
recognition
that
patient
access
to
this
program
is
critical
and
must
have
the
full
support
of
Congress.&#8221;
The
Medicare
Part
D
prescription
drug
coverage
provides
affordable
access
to
prescription
drugs
for
over
36
million
Medicare
beneficiaries.
The
Part
D
program,
which
has
maintained
stable,
affordable
average
monthly
premiums,
enjoys
a
90
percent
approval
rating
among
beneficiaries,
and
has
costs
that
are
more
than
40
percent
below
original
Congressional
Budget
Office
projections.
Portman
also
hosted
a
federal
resource
informational
business
seminar
for
small
business
owners
throughout
the
Buckeye
Lake
region
to
meet
directly
with
federal
agency
representatives
and
to
learn
about
various
resources
that
are
available.
In
addition,
small
business
counselors
were
on
hand
to
assist
on
developing
strategic
business
plans
for
future
opportunities.
Last
year,
Portman
held
a
roundtable
at
Buckeye
Lake
Marina
in
Millersport,
Ohio
to
discuss
his
legislation,
the
Harmful
Algal
Blooms
and
Hypoxia
Research
and
Control
Amendments
Act
of
2013 ,
which
was
signed
into
law
by
President
Obama.
The
bill
reauthorized
the
Harmful
Algal
Bloom
(HAB)
and
Hypoxia
Research
and
Control
Act,
which
was
first
enacted
in
1998
and
reauthorized
in
2004
and
2008.
For
over
a
decade
this
program
has
served
as
the
federal
government&#8217;s
research
and
response
framework
for
harmful
algal
blooms.
Portman
negotiated
a
new
fresh
water
section
for
the
program
that
will
ensure
federal
agencies
prioritize
monitoring
and
mitigation
efforts
on
fresh
water
bodies
such
as
Buckeye
Lake.
Prior
to
his
roundtable,
Portman
surveyed
the

On
Sunday,
Portman,
along
with
Jane
Portman,
will
participate
in
the
8th
Annual
Ride
Cincinnati.
The
annual
ride
raises
funds
for
breast

research
at
The
Barrett
Cancer

The
Portmans
served
as
honorary
co-chairs
of
the

4
years
ago
and
are
doing
so
again
this
year.
The

I
are
honored
to

and
I
look
forward
to
joining
friends
from
the
Greater
Cincinnati
region
to
raise
funds
and
awareness
for
the
cause,&#8221;
said
Senator
Portman.
&#8220;Cancer
has
affected
us
all
in
one
way
or
another.
I
lost
my
own
mom
to
a
rare
form
of
cancer
20
years
ago,
and
Jane
lost
her
mother
to
breast
cancer.
We
congratulate
Ride
Cincinnati
on
a
successful
event
this
year
and
applaud
them
for
their
continued
fight
against
breast
cancer.&#8221;
&#8220;I
lost
my
mother
to
breast
cancer
when
she
was
51
years
old,
back
in
1986,&#8221;
said
Jane
Portman.
&#8220;My
sister
Sally
was
diagnosed
and
successfully
treated
for
breast
cancer
at
age
45
just
last
year,
28
years
after
our
mom&#8217;s
death.
Slowly
but
surely,
we
are
seeing
progress
in
the
battle
against
breast
cancer.
Awareness
and
education
and
treatment
are
all
improving,
thanks
to
the
work
of
doctors
and
researchers
at
UC's
Barrett
Cancer
Center
who
are
fighting
this
important
fight.&#8221;
This

care
in
the
military
that
improves
upon
the
current

Portman
stated.
&#8220;My
amendment
will
help
focus
the
military&#8217;s
efforts
to
pursue
these
goals
and
serve
as
the
foundation
for
future
efforts
on
this
issue.
I
believe
this
amendment
represents
an
important
step
towards
ensuring
our
servicemembers
receive
the
care
they
deserve
and
will
continue
to
work
for
adoption
to
this
critical
legislation.&#8221;
Portman
is
the
author
of
the
Medical
Evaluation
Parity

a
letter
in
February
to
the
U.S.
Secretary
of
Commerce
urging
the
Administration
to
closely
study
this
case.
Portman
with
USW
Local
207L
President
Rod
Nelson
&#8220;We
applaud
the
support
of
Senator
Portman
on
the
tire
tariffs
along
with
Senator
Sherrod
Brown,&#8221;
said
USW
Local
207L
President
Rod
Nelson.
&#8220;It
just
goes
to
show
you,
at
least
in
Ohio,
our
elected
senators
have
got
the
back
of
the
their
constituents
and
will
fight
to
level
the
playing
field
for
the
hard
working
people
in
their
state.
This
sends
a
message
to
China;
if
you
don&#8217;t
play
by
the
international
trade
rules
then
you
will
be
punished
until
you
do.
American
workers
can
compete
with
anybody
anywhere
in
the
world
as
long
as
the
competition
remains
fair
and
follows
the
rules.
Thanks
to
Senator
Portman
for
sticking
up
for
the
hard
working
people
at
the
Cooper
Tire
plant
in
Findlay,
Ohio.&#8221;
Portman
has
a
long
record
of
standing
up
for
Ohio
workers
impacted
by
illegally
subsidized
and
undersold
imports.
He
has
worked
hand-in-hand
with
Ohio
workers
who
manufacture
pipe
and
tube
products ,
hot-rolled
steel ,
rebar
and
other
products.
Portman
and
U.S.
Senator
Sherrod
Brown
(D-Ohio)
led
the
charge
on
a
bipartisan
measure
that
passed
the
Senate
last
month
to
allow
American
workers
to
more
easily
get
relief
from
these
illegal
trade
practices.
Portman&#8217;s
testimony
can
be
found
here .
On
Wednesday,
Portman
urged
passage
of
the
NDAA
and
discussed
the
need
to
address
growing
national
security
threats
around
the
world,
including
continued
Russian
aggression
in
eastern
Ukraine.
Portman
urged
adoption
of
his
amendments
that
will
help
the
U.S.
better
assist
the
Ukrainians
as
they
defend
their
sovereignty.
Full
video
can
be
found
here .
The
first
amendment
modifies
a
section
of
the
NDAA
that
authorizes
$300
million
in
military
assistance
to
Ukraine.
This
section,
as
amended,
directs
the
Secretary
of
Defense
to
provide
a
number
of
critical
capabilities
the
Ukrainians
need
to
defend
themselves,
including
real-time
intelligence,
counter-artillery
radars,
defensive
lethal
assistance,
UAVs,
secure
communications,
and
training
to
develop
key
combat,
planning,
and
support
capabilities.
Half
of
that
$300
million
is
fenced
off
until
at
least
$60
million
is
spent
on
the
most
important
capabilities
the
Ukrainians
need
and
have
requested:
real-time
intelligence,
defensive
lethal
assistance,
and
counter-artillery
radars.
If
the
Administration
fails
to
use
this
money
for
the
purposes
specified,
they
must
use
it
to
support
other
nations
facing
an
increased
risk
of
Russian
aggression.
The
second
amendment
studies
the
implications
of
the
conflict
in
Ukraine
for
the
U.S.
military.
It
would
require
an
assessment
of
U.S.
and
NATO
efforts
in
eastern
Ukraine
based
on
lessons
learned
from
the
tactics,
techniques,
and
procedures
used
by
the
Russians
and
separatists.
This
assessment
will
include,
among
other
things,
a
report
of
the
implications
of
Russia&#8217;s
information
war
and
the
implications
the
conflict
has
for
armored
warfare
equipment,
such
as
Abrams
tanks
made
in
Lima,
Ohio.
On
Social
Media:
Senator
Rob
Portman:
Comprehensive
Addiction
and
Recovery
Act
More
than
24
million
Americans
struggle
with
substance
abuse
and
addiction.
They
are
our
neighbors,
friends
and
family
members,
and
they
need
our
support.
The
drugs
being
abused
change,
but
the
results
are
the
same.
These
drugs
rob
people
of
the
chance
to
reach
their
God-given
potential.
Today,
heroin
use
is
on
the
rise
in
Ohio
and
throughout
the
country,
and
without
proper
intervention
and
treatment,
lives,
families
and
communities
are
devastated.
Often
this
leads
to
a
downward
spiral
that
turns
into
criminal
activity,
time
behind
bars,
or
even
worse;
ends
with
an
overdose.
&#8230;
Addressing
substance
abuse
has
always
been
a
top
priority
of
mine
and
as
the
founder
of
the
Coalition
for
a
Drug-Free
Cincinnati,
and
as
a
leader
in
Congress
on
legislation
to
combat
drug
use,
I
have
met
many
people
who
have
been
personally
impacted
by
addiction.
Some
received
the
help
they
needed
and
were
able
to
make
a
recovery.
Others
were
not
as
fortunate.
We
must
focus
on
what
works
to
turn
back
this
alarming
trend.
In
my
experience,
I
have
learned
that
a
comprehensive,
evidence-based
approach
is
needed.
We
should
all
support
prevention
and
education
efforts
to
avoid
addiction
and
the
struggles
it
entails.
But
we
also
need
more
effective
treatment
and
recovery
efforts
to
deal
with
those
struggling
with
addiction
disorders.
We
know
that
addiction
is
a
disease,
but
that
only
about
11
percent
of
those
needing
treatment
get
it,
unlike
other
diseases.
Finally,
I
have
seen
that
a
local,
grassroots
approach
to
prevention
and
treatment
is
most
effective.
In
order
to
combat
substance
abuse
and
help
get
more
people
on
the
road
to
recovery,
we
must
offer
solutions
that
go
beyond
a
top
down,
one
size
fits
all
approach.
We
must
take
a
comprehensive
approach
and
start
from
the
bottom
up.
That
is
the
focus
of
a
bill
I
introduced,
called
the
Comprehensive
Addiction
and
Recovery
Act
of
2015.
This
legislation
is
designed
to
provide
a
variety
of
resources
and
incentives
to
better
address
addiction
in
a
number
of
ways.
It
does
so
by
using
evidence-based,
tested
methods
to
expand
treatment
and
increases
educational
efforts
aimed
at
teens,
parents,
and
other
caretakers
with
the
goal
of
stopping
drug
abuse
before
it
ever
starts.
The
bill
expands
disposal
sites
for
unwanted
prescription
medications
to
keep
them
out
of
the
hands
of
children
and
adolescents.
It
also
expands
the
availability
of
a
drug
called
Naxolone
to
law
enforcement
agencies
and
other
first
responders
to
help
in
the
reversal
of
overdoses
in
order
to
save
lives.
&#8230;
It
is
understandable
that
for
some,
fighting
drug
abuse
may
seem
like
a
battle
that
cannot
be
won,
but
that&#8217;s
because
we
have
not
really
tried
what
we
know
can
work.
If
we
are
going
to
be
successful
in
helping
all
Americans
achieve
their
dreams
in
life,
and
avoid
the
devastating
impact
of
drug
abuse,
we
need
to
try
new
and
innovative
ways
to
confront
its
challenges.
By
taking
a
comprehensive
approach,
relying
on
the
evidence
of
what
works,
and
implementing
it
at
the
local
level,
I
strongly
believe
the
Comprehensive
Addiction
and
Recovery
Act
will
help
us
meet
those
challenges
and
lead
more
people
on
the
road
to
recovery.

Here&#8217;s
What&#8217;s
Stunting
U.S.
Growth
and
Global
Competitiveness
Sen.
Rob
Portman,
the
Ohio
Republican
who
serves
on
the
Senate
Finance
Committee
and
exercises
considerable
influence
within
the
Senate&#8217;s
Republican
caucus,
urged
his
fellow
lawmakers
to
get
serious
about
reforming
the
U.S.
tax
code
Tuesday,
saying
that
the
corporate
sector
is
already
being
&#8220;hollowed
out&#8221;
because
of
competition
from
lower-tax
countries.
Speaking
at
a
legislative
seminar
sponsored
by
the
law
firm
BakerHostetler
in
Washington,
Portman
said,
&#8220;We&#8217;re
not
seeing
the
kind
of
economic
growth
we&#8217;ve
always
seen
coming
out
of
a
recession.&#8221;
One
of
the
reasons,
he
said
is
that
an
antiquated
tax
code
that
hasn&#8217;t
been
&#8220;meaningfully
reformed
since
1986&#8221;
is
hurting
competitiveness.
Since
that
time,
he
said,
&#8220;every
other
country&#8221;
the
U.S.
competes
with
has
reformed
their
codes,
leading
U.S.
companies
to
consider
move
overseas
where
their
profits
are
more
lightly
taxed.
&#8230;
&#8220;By
the
time
we
get
to
it,
which
may
be
two
or
three
years
from
now
probably,
to
be
practical,
after
a
new
administration
comes
in
and
a
new
Congress,
we&#8217;re
going
to
see
a
hollowing
out
of
a
lot
of
corporations
in
our
country,
and
we&#8217;ll
look
back
and
say,
&#8216;What
happened?&#8217;&#8221;

Senators
call
for
more
aid
to
Ukraine
Sen.
Dick
Durbin
(D-Ill.)
called
for
more
U.S.
aid
to
Ukraine,
after
senators
met
with
a
Ukrainian
official
to
discuss
the
ongoing
crisis.
Ukrainian
Prime
Minister
Arseniy
Yatsenyuk
met
with
the
Senate
Ukraine
Caucus
co-chaired
by
Durbin
and
Rob
Portman
(R-Ohio).
Sens.
Amy
Klobuchar
(D-Minn.),
Sherrod
Brown
(D-Ohio),
and
Ron
Johnson
(R-Wis.)
also
attended
the
meeting.
&#8230;
Tuesday's
meeting
comes
after
Durbin
traveled
to
Ukraine
last
month
to
meet
with
officials,
including
Ukrainian
President
Petro
Poroshenko,
and
U.S.
service
members
who
are
helping
train
the
country's
military.
He
said
during
Tuesday's
meeting
Yatsenyuk
"made
it
clear"
that
the
country
needs
more
military
aid,
including
weapons,
and
economic
support.
The
administration,
so
far,
has
been
hesitant
to
provide
Ukraine
with
lethal
aid.
But,
late
last
month,
Vice
President
Joe
Biden
said
whether
or
not
to
provide
lethal
arms
to
Ukraine
was
a
"debate
worth
having."
Tensions
between
the
United
States
and
Russia
have
been
running
high
since
Moscow
annexed
Ukraine's
Crimean
Peninsula.
The
United
States
and
other
Western
countries
have
also
hit
Russia
with
sanctions,
and
accused
Russian
President
Vladimir
Putin's
government
of
backing
separatist
fighters
in
eastern
Ukraine.
Russia
has
denied
those
allegations.

Paying
the
elderly
to
stay
healthy
makes
sense
C'mon,
grandma,
work
that
body.
That's
one
way
to
encourage
older
citizens
to
get
healthy,
but
perhaps
a
more
effective
way
is
to
reward
them
for
achieving
healthy
lifestyle
goals.
That's
the
intent
of
legislation
U.S.
Sen.
Rob
Portman,
Republican
of
Ohio,
expects
to
reintroduce
later
this
year.
It
would
allow
Medicare
patients
to
set
healthy
goals
and,
if
they
meet
them,
to
receive
modest
payouts
from
the
government.
Portman
envisions
that
a
patient
could
earn
as
little
as
$100
after
two
years
or
as
much
as
$400
after
three
years.
Then,
of
course,
there
would
be
the
nonmonetary
gratification
of
having
the
best
vitals
on
the
assisted-living
floor.
&#8230;
A
pilot
program
that
incorporates
some
of
the
proposed
Medicare
health-lifestyle
benchmarking,
but
not
the
monetary
rewards,
is
being
carried
by
the
Peter
B.
Lewis
Aquatic
and
Therapy
Center
at
the
Menorah
Park
Center
for
Senior
Living
in
Beachwood.
The
senior-living
center
offers
initial
wellness
exams
and
then
works
with
those
so
interested
to
develop
goals
and
the
means
to
achieve
them.
Menorah
Park
will
provide
feedback
on
how
the
Medicare
program
can
be
set
up.
The
idea
had
bipartisan
support
when
it
was
introduced
in
2013
as
the
Medicare
Better
Health
Rewards
Program
Act,
although
it
was
not
enacted.
Both
Republicans
and
Democrats
should
see
the
merit
to
offering
incentives
to
older
Americans
that
should
result
in
healthier
living
and
less
reliance
on
Medicare.
While
the
program
won't
put
an
end
to
rising
health
care
costs,
it
could
be
a
cost-effective
way
to
encourage
preventive
medicine
and
other
practices
to
help
stave
off
the
chronic
diseases
that
can
lead
to
huge
health
care
outlays
later
in
life.
