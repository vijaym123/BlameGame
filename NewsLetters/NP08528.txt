Dear
Friend,
This week we held two more hearings in the Veterans Affairs
committee seeking more information about why secret wait lists were
created in Phoenix and how we can solve the widespread and systemic
problems at the VA nationwide.
Wednesdays hearing
focused on heightening access to non-VA care to increase veterans access.
Ive introduced
a bill to pre-authorize veterans to
receive non-VA care
if the VA cant see them in time, which in the
Central Valley would mean more veterans driving shorter distances
with shorter wait times for their appointments while I work to ensure
construction begins on the French Camp VA facility.
Fridays hearing
reviewed bonuses that senior VA
officials have received in an effort to add badly-needed accountability. Last
month the House passed a bill that I supported to
give the VA Secretary the power to fire or demote senior executives
who arent performing their jobs and providing the care our veterans
deserve. This week we formed a conference committee to match this bill
and others to legislation the Senate passed with the goal of sending a
package of real reform for the VA to the Presidents desk. Over the
coming months I will be participating in a series of hearings where Ill
have the opportunity to ask questions of VA officials. I want to hear
from you
what changes would you make if you could re-build the VA
from the ground up? What experiences have you had with our local VA
locations?

and Gavin LeVake this week when they visited Washington from Turlock.
My office helped Jenifer and her boys tour the White House, the Kennedy
Center, the Library of Congress and the U.S. Capitol
building.
Julie Lish and her family visited from Modesto and
stopped by my office on Thursday to meet with me. It is always great to
