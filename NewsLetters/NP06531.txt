Dear
David,
This past August Recess was a very busy month.
I held two events in the community.
The first was a
Small Business Global Access Exporter Forum
in the
City of Ontario where I invited small business owners to learn about the
benefits of exporting products to grow international sales.
The
second was a
Free Community Resource Fair
in the
City of Chino where families had the opportunity to receive free
brochures and booklets from various government organizations.
I also
visited local small businesses, schools, and places of worship to
hear the concerns of constituents.
This week I fly back to
Washington, D.C. and continue my work in Congress and hope to address
the issues that matter most to Inland Empire Families such as helping
small businesses create jobs, extending unemployment insurance, ending
tax breaks for corporations shipping jobs overseas, and
more.
I invite you to share your thoughts through
Facebook
and
Twitter . I welcome hearing from you
and hope that you will stay in
touch.
Respectfully,
Gloria Negrete McLeod
Member of
Congress
