Dear Fellow Nevadan,
We must do all we can
to make sure our children have healthy, nutritious meals to set them up
for healthy futures. Throughout this week, National School Lunch
Week, we should all reaffirm our commitment to securing access to
nutritious food for our nations youth because well-fed children are happier,
healthier, and do better in school.
In Nevada, there are
more than 156,000 children living in poverty who do not know where they
will get their next meal. This is why I worked with my Senate
colleagues to unanimously pass the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. This
important legislation helps children, schools, and local government
provide nutritious meals to children who otherwise would not eat
breakfast or lunch.
The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act sets
nutrition standards for school meals, and it also increased the federal
reimbursement rate for school lunches. This law also made several other
critical changes in what our children eat in school. The law provides
funding for fresh food instead of cheaper, processed food; supports
school gardens and the sourcing of local produce; removes junk food and
sodas from school vending machines; and helps states fund obesity
prevention efforts and nutrition education programs that help children eat
better.
I will continue to support nutritional programs like
these and with your help, we build a healthier future where all
children have enough to eat.
