Dear Friend,
Memorial Day is here again. It's the day we pause as a nation, as one
community, to remember the men and women who answered our nation's call
and paid the ultimate sacrifice. They died serving our country, and a
grateful country stops to salute and thank them and their families for
their dedication, their courage, their patriotism.
This is a day for remembering, but time takes its toll, and generations
pass. When I was growing up, everybody had a friend, a relative, or a
neighbor who had been killed in war. It was my parents' generation who
fought in World War II, and the scars and the losses were still visible
from that war.
Korea claimed too many American lives and also left a trail of sorrow
and pride and pain. I was aware of the pain and loss and suffering from
that conflict, because a childhood friend grew up without her dad, who
died in Korea.
Then, my generation came to age during the Vietnam War. I grew up with
it on television every night.
There was shock and horror and
overwhelming pain whenever we heard a name we recognized, or friends
told us about someone they knew. We now really understood that a too
early death was possible, and the loss was permanent. The solemn
meaning of Memorial Day was now crystal clear, even when too many here
forgot to thank and support those who served.
Today, we have added a new generation to the honor roll-the men and
women who died in Iraq and Afghanistan and other places around the
world. We must also speak their names, share their stories, and support
their families.
President Lincoln summed up our nation's responsibilities beautifully
in his Second Inaugural Address in 1865:
". to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne
the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan-to do all which may
achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with
all nations."
Fewer citizens now serve in the military, and most people don't have
family members or friends who died in a war, but Memorial Day must
still hold its meaning for them. We must still tell each new generation
the stories of generations of ordinary people who bravely left ordinary
lives to serve and protect their country, and died too far away, too
soon.
We owe these extraordinary Americans a debt that cannot be repaid, but
I believe they would ask us to simply remember two things. They would
want us to remember that freedom isn't free, and they would want us to
remember to keep our promises to them by honoring our commitments to
care for those they left behind.
That's why we should take our children to services and parades on
Memorial Day, or if we can't, read a poem or tell a story about
Memorial Day's meaning. That's why we cannot ever stop pausing one day
a year to bow our heads and thank those who gave their lives for us.
That's why we must honor our commitments to their loved ones.
Freedom
is not free, and some heroic Americans paid the price. They are
counting on us to remember.
Best Wishes,
Carol

Dear
Friend,
Memorial
Day
is
here
again.
It&#8217;s
the
day
we
pause
as
a
nation,
as
one
community,
to
remember
the
men
and
women
who
answered
our
nation&#8217;s
call
and
paid
the
ultimate
sacrifice.
They
died
serving
our
country,
and
a
grateful
country
stops
to
salute
and
thank
them
and
their
families
for
their
dedication,
their
courage,
their
patriotism.
This
is
a
day
for
remembering,
but
time
takes
its
toll,
and
generations
pass.
When
I
was
growing
up,
everybody
had
a
friend,
a
relative,
or
a
neighbor
who
had
been
killed
in
war.
It
was
my
parents&#8217;
generation
who
fought
in
World
War
II,
and
the
scars
and
the
losses
were
still
visible
from
that
war.
Korea
claimed
too
many
American
lives
and
also
left
a
trail
of
sorrow
and
pride
and
pain.
I
was
aware
of
the
pain
and
loss
and
suffering
from
that
conflict,
because
a
childhood
friend
grew
up
without
her
dad,
who
died
in
Korea.
Then,
my
generation
came
to
age
during
the
Vietnam
War.
I
grew
up
with
it
on
television
every
night.
There
was
shock
and
horror
and
overwhelming
pain
whenever
we
heard
a
name
we
recognized,
or
friends
told
us
about
someone
they
knew.
We
now
really
understood
that
a
too
early
death
was
possible,
and
the
loss
was
permanent.
The
solemn
meaning
of
Memorial
Day
was
now
crystal
clear,
even
when
too
many
here
forgot
to
thank
and
support
those
who
served.
Today,
we
have
added
a
new
generation
to
the
honor
roll&#8212;the
men
and
women
who
died
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
and
other
places
around
the
world.
We
must
also
speak
their
names,
share
their
stories,
and
support
their
families.
President
Lincoln
summed
up
our
nation's
responsibilities
beautifully
in
his
Second
Inaugural
Address
in
1865:
"&#8230;
to
bind
up
the
nation's
wounds;
to
care
for
him
who
shall
have
borne
the
battle,
and
for
his
widow,
and
his
orphan&#8212;to
do
all
which
may
achieve
and
cherish
a
just
and
lasting
peace,
among
ourselves,
and
with
all
nations."
Fewer
citizens
now
serve
in
the
military,
and
most
people
don&#8217;t
have
family
members
or
friends
who
died
in
a
war,
but
Memorial
Day
must
still
hold
its
meaning
for
them.
We
must
still
tell
each
new
generation
the
stories
of
generations
of
ordinary
people
who
bravely
left
ordinary
lives
to
serve
and
protect
their
country,
and
died
too
far
away,
too
soon.
We
owe
these
extraordinary
Americans
a
debt
that
cannot
be
repaid,
but
I
believe
they
would
ask
us
to
simply
remember
two
things.
They
would
want
us
to
remember
that
freedom
isn&#8217;t
free,
and
they
would
want
us
to
remember
to
keep
our
promises
to
them
by
honoring
our
commitments
to
care
for
those
they
left
behind.
That&#8217;s
why
we
should
take
our
children
to
services
and
parades
on
Memorial
Day,
or
if
we
can&#8217;t,
read
a
poem
or
tell
a
story
about
Memorial
Day&#8217;s
meaning.
That&#8217;s
why
we
cannot
ever
stop
pausing
one
day
a
year
to
bow
our
heads
and
thank
those
who
gave
their
lives
for
us.
That&#8217;s
why
we
must
honor
our
commitments
to
their
loved
ones.
Freedom
is
not
free,
and
some
heroic
Americans
paid
the
price.
They
are
counting
on
us
to
remember.

Wishes, Carol
