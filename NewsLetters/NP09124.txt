Dear
Friends,
More upsetting news in Washington this week,
everything that we were concerned about - VA data manipulation and
widespread wait time schemes - was confirmed by an interim report
released by the Veterans Affairs Office of the Inspector
General.
Secretary Shinseki has a
distinguished military record, and I am grateful for his service to our country.
He did the right thing by resigning.
When a problem is systemic,
it is not a funding problem nor does one persons resignation solve
the issue.
Ultimately, the buck
stops with the president and at his press conference today, he provided
no substantive plan outside of one mans resignation for going
forward.
It is time for the president to take responsibility and work
with us to solve the problem.
House
Republicans have been taking action with the passage of the
VA Management Accountability Act
last week and the
FY15 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related
Agencies Appropriations bill
in April.
Unfortunately, for
either of these bills to move forward we need the Senate Democrats and
the president to come to the table.
Precious lives have been lost as a result of what has been happening
at the VA.
My focus will remain on doing whatever I can to cut
the bureaucracy that has detrimentally affected the VAs ability to be
responsive to the very people for whom the agency is named
our
veterans.
For veterans and family
members of veterans in the First District,
my team and
I continue to be here for you .
If you are in need of
assistance with the VA, please do not hesitate to
contact
us .
Stay in touch and God bless,
Tell a Friend
