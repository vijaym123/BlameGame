Dear Friend,
Tomorrow, January 25th, is National Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) Day, a nationwide effort to increase awareness about the tax credit and free tax preparation sites.
Under the EITC, your household could walk away with $6,044 in credits if you earned less than $51,567 in 2013 from wages, self-employment, or farming.
While many eligible workers and families benefit from the credit, the EITC is a vastly underused resource. The IRS estimates that 1 in 5 households still miss out on the EITC because they are unaware of the credit or don&rsquo;t file a return.
Don&rsquo;t let your family miss out.
The EITC is a valuable but complex tax break that varies by income, family size, and filing status. That&rsquo;s why I make it a priority to connect Orange County families to all available resources. This spring, I am hosting a series of income tax assistance days in conjunction with the Orange County Financial Stability Alliance where residents can file their taxes for FREE.
For the dates and times of my upcoming Community Tax Days, please visit my website at

The money saved by claiming the EITC can make a serious difference. Last year, the credit returned almost $62 billion to over 27 million workers throughout the nation with an average credit of $2,200. To many families, the credit could translate to two months of income, the money needed to stay current on rent or the means to buy healthy food for their children. Please consider taking advantage of this opportunity.
As always, please contact my District Office at 714-621-0102 if you have any questions.
Very Truly Yours,
Loretta Sanchez
Member of Congress
