Statement
Watch Rep. Carter Speak in support of DHS
Amendments
My boarding pass is printed and Im heading
home to Texas after a busy week. As Chairman of the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS) Subcommittee on Appropriations, I spent the week
battling the Presidents overreaching executive actions. My 2015
Homeland Security Appropriations bill ( H.R. 240 ),
which was passed by the House of Representatives on Wednesday, prohibits
DHS funding from being used to implement the Presidents overreaching
executive amnesty.
This bill stops the Presidents amnesty
action. I am proud that my colleagues are joining me in fighting back
against this President, who continually bypasses Congress to further
his own agenda. I urge the Senate to pass this bill immediately and
send it to the President to sign. I ask, Mr. President, will you
prioritize illegal immigrants over the safety of our homeland and the
American people?
The DHS Appropriations bill provides $39.7
billion in discretionary funding for DHS to keep Americans safe, which is
an increase of $400 million more than last year.
The
safety of our homeland should be top priority. In a time when we are
facing a potential attacks on our homeland by terrorists, the President
wants to focus on giving amnesty to people here illegally. Thats not
happening on my watch. This bill puts money where it needs to be; on our
border.
The FY 15 Homeland Security bill will fund DHS
through the remainder of the year. The bill was passed by the House of
Representatives by a vote of 236 to 191(See
Roll Call
#35 ). The Senate must now vote for the bill and send it to the
President to sign in to law.
Other
highlights of the bill:
Customs and
Border Protection (CBP)
$10.7 billion for CBP
to support the largest operational force levels in history
21,370
Border Patrol agents and 23,775 CBP
officers.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)
$5.96 billion for ICE,
Included- $3.4 billion for
ICE detention programs. The increase will sustain 34,000 detention beds
and increase family detention beds by 3,732.
Included-
$1.9 billion for domestic and international investigations to combat
human trafficking, child exploitation, cyber-crime, and drug smuggling,
and to expand visa vetting capabilities.
Funds to
fully finance E-Verify, a program that helps companies check if their
employees may legally work in the United
States.
Cybersecurity
$753.2 million for
cybersecurity operations in the National Programs and Protection
Directorate.
Oversight
The legislation requires that DHS submit comprehensive spending plans to
Congress to increase transparency and congressional and public
oversight over the use of taxpayer dollars.
