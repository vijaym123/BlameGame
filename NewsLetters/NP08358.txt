Citizens United . Help us reach 1,5OO,OOO supporting a Constitutional Amendment ending
Citizens United
for good:
Sign Your Name &gt;&gt;
The Democratic effort to overturn the
Citizens United
Supreme Court decision is within striking distance of a HISTORIC BREAKTHROUGH:
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT
1,5OO,OOO SIGNERS NEEDED
This is our BIG chance to show Republicans and their wealthy backers that we&rsquo;re ready to change unfair campaign finance laws once and for all.
Successfully amending the Constitution would be a devastating blow to shady outside groups run by people like the Koch brothers. They&rsquo;ll no longer be able to spend unprecedented amounts of money to buy elections.
We&rsquo;re just 191,439 signatures short of hitting our goal of one million signatures, but according to our records, your name hasn&rsquo;t been added: NAME: David Johnson
PETITION SIGNATURE:
PENDING &gt;&gt;
We really don&rsquo;t want you to miss out on history, David. So will you sign on to help us reach
1,5OO,OOO strong
demanding a Constitutional amendment to overturn
Citizens United ? http://dccc.org/Overturn-Citizens-United
