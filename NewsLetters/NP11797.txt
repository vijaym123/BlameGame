How Much Longer in Afghanistan?
After 12 years and hundreds of billions of dollars spent, the
administration has declared that the war in Afghanistan will be wound
down by December 31, 2014. However, the Administration is also
negotiating an agreement with the Government of Afghanistan that would
set guidelines for U.S. troops to remain in training, support, and
counter-terrorism roles through at least 2024.
Before we decide to commit massive resources and thousands of troops to
another decade in Afghanistan, the American people should be able to
weigh in and Congress should vote. Automatic renewal is fine for gym
memberships or Netflix, but it's not the right approach to war. Earlier
this month, Jeff introduced a bipartisan bill with Senators Mike Lee
(R-UT), Joe Manchin (D-WV), and Rand Paul (R-KY) that would require
congressional approval for any military mission in Afghanistan after
the end of this year.
What We Owe Oregon's Veterans
Last week, a minority of senators used a procedural tactic to block a
bill that would improve health care, education and job-training
benefits for veterans despite majority support for the bill. Senator
Jeff Merkley said after the bill was killed that "supporting our
veterans should not be a partisan issue. Our men and women in uniform
have stood up for us, and we must stand up for them. Unfortunately,
some in the Senate are putting politics over good policy for our
veterans. Oregon's veterans deserve better."
The bill would have helped the Veterans Administration shorten the
unacceptable months-long waiting time for veterans to get benefits,
improve care and benefits for victims of sexual trauma, expand
educational opportunities for veterans, and help encourage the hiring
of vets. The bill also includes Jeff's Spouses of Heroes Education Act,
which would grant education benefits to brave military spouses who lose
their partners in the line of service. You can read more about the bill
here.
Protecting our Forests from Wildfires
We shouldn't have to choose between investing in fire prevention and
putting out fires. Late last year, Senator Ron Wyden and Jeff
introduced a bipartisan bill that would treat large fires as the
natural disasters that they are, so firefighting costs will come from
the same disaster account that funds hurricane and earthquake relief.
By funding the firefighting of large fires through disaster assistance,
the U.S. Forest Service can stop raiding the funds that are supposed to
be used for fire prevention and hazardous fuels reduction projects,
making our forests healthier and putting jobs in the woods.
This week, President Obama endorsed Jeff and Ron's plan by including it
in his budget for the next fiscal year. This should be a big help in
Oregon, where we've dealt with huge fires over the last few years,
including a fire in Eastern Oregon in 2012 that was the size of Rhode
Island!

Jeff is a native of Myrtle Creek, Oregon and the son of a millwright.
The first in his family to go to college, Jeff still lives in the same
working class neighborhood that his parents eventually settled in and
his kids go to the same public high school he attended. Making the
'American Dream' a reality for others as it has been for him is what
got Jeff Merkley involved in public life and is what continues to keep
him fighting for Oregon families.
In the four years he has been in the U.S. Senate, Jeff Merkley has been
focused on creating jobs and getting our nation back on track. He led
the fight against high-risk gambling on Wall Street, has been a leading
voice for aggressive action to take on the foreclosure crisis, and
wrote the law that helps small businesses raise money on the internet
so they can grow and create jobs.
Jeff and his wife Mary have been married for twenty years and have two
children, Brynne and Jonathan, and an Airedale terrier, Sadie.
