Dear
Friend,
In one of my committee hearings last week,
we heard from IRS Commissioner John
Koskinen
again.
If you're wondering why, then
definitely check out
this
article .
You'll see why they're saying that those of us in
Georgia call it like we see it.
Every time we have another
hearing about how the IRS and other agencies have abused their power and
undermined the rights of Americans, it seems we learn
something new .
It's
coming in slow drips, but the truth is slowly making its way
out.
It certainly doesn't have to be that way.
The same president
who promised the most transparent administration in history is the very
one whose employees are
dodging
questions,
no-showing
after they're issued subpoenas, and
ignoring their
responsibility
to the American people.
It's only because of our
persistence in the House of Representatives that we're learning
anything at all.
We owe that to you, your thoughtful questions, and
the encouragement we get from folks at home to leave no stone
unturned.
It's a privilege to work for you and to always hear
what you
think .
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of Congress
