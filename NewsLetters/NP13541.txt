December 14, 2013
Dear Friend,
Today we remember the twenty children and the six teachers who were
brutally killed during the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School and
we honor their memory by renewing our commitment to end senseless gun
violence here in Rhode Island and all across our nation.
While it's important to offer moments of silence to reflect and
remember all the victims, we must also speak out and do everything we
can to reduce gun violence and to prevent future tragedies like
Newtown. That is why I have long supported efforts to stem the tide of
gun violence. I was a founding member of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, I
am a member of the Congressional Gun Task Force, and I am working in
Congress to pass legislation that will close gun loopholes, fix the
broken criminal background check system, and prevent criminals and the
seriously mentally ill from having access to firearms.
Today we stand united as a community here in Rhode Island and across
the country to remind each other that we all share in the vital
responsibility to protect the children, families, and neighborhoods we
live in. We pause to honor acts of bravery and the lives taken from us,
recommitting ourselves to the solemn duty of taking action to reduce
gun violence as a way of honoring their memory.
I close by asking you to keep the most recent shooting victim in
Colorado in your thoughts and prayers.
Sincerely,
David Cicilline
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
Today
we
remember
the
twenty
children
and
the
six
teachers
who
were
brutally
killed
during
the
massacre
at
Sandy

Elementary
School
and
we
honor
their
memory
by
renewing
our
commitment
to
end
senseless

here
in
Rhode

and
all
across
our
nation.
While
it&#8217;s
important
to
offer
moments
of
silence
to
reflect
and
remember
all
the
victims,
we
must
also
speak
out
and
do
everything
we
can
to
reduce
gun
violence
and
to
prevent
future
tragedies
like
Newtown. That
is
why
I
have
long
supported
efforts
to
stem
the
tide
of
gun
violence.
I
was
a
founding
member
of
Mayors
Against
Illegal
Guns,
I
am
a

of
the
Congressional
Gun

and
I

Today
we

to
remind
each

that
we
all

We
