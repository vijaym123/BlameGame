There was a time, not too long ago, when most everything we bought was made in factories here in the United States.
Our manufacturing industry was robust and thriving. It employed our families, our friends, and our neighbors, and produced just about everything we needed. Then U.S. manufacturing began to change, as overseas manufacturing became a cheaper option and burdensome regulations began to choke out our competitiveness and innovation.
In 1985,
President Reagan proclaimed that December is Made in America Month . This year, I propose that we use this month as a time to refocus on what we need to do to revitalize and reinvigorate our manufacturing sector. The industry is ripe for global competitiveness, as well as national innovation and job creation. We need to take advantage of that potential by reducing unnecessary, unreasonable regulations, lowering tax burdens, and creating a national manufacturing strategy.
Instead of acting as a barrier, the government needs to be doing its very best to enable growth and competitiveness in this crucial component of our economy.
During Made in America Month , I
would also like to say thank you to all who work in manufacturing, for helping to make the USA strong . You are part of the backbone of our economy, and your industry is responsible for employing thousands of people in steady, good paying jobs. You represent what America is all about: innovation, resourcefulness, growth, and hard work.
Keep up the good work, and know that I am fighting to support you.
Yours in Service,
Randy
P.S. This summer, I conducted a manufacturing tour around the 4 th
District of Virginia to visit various manufacturing sites and hear firsthand from employees and industry leaders what they needed in order to grow, create jobs, and expand opportunities. Learn more about my tour and my work on behalf of American manufacturing,
