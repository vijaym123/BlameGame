Congressional Report -- Week of April 7-11: Harlandale ISD
Receives $750K Grant to Keep Kids Moving
Hello Friend,
I spent the week in our nation's capital working on legislation and
attending hearings and meetings - always looking out for the best
interests of fellow Texans. It was also a busy week across the
district. Field Representatives visited with constituents in Dilley,
Pearsall, north and south side San Antonio, Eagle Pass, Del Rio,
Rankin, Crane, Ft. Stockton, Monahans, Kermit, Pecos and Marfa. Here's
a wrap up.

Harlandale ISD Gets $750K Grant for Physical Ed
On Wednesday, Harlandale Independent School District received a
$750,000 federal grant from the Department of Education. The Carol M.
White Physical Education Program is a 3-year program designed to help
the school district expand and enhance physical education programs,
including after school programs, for students from kinder through 12th
grade.
Taking care of our kids is important, especially as we work to reduce
obesity and diabetes plaguing children at young age. The grant will
help Harlandale Independent School District provide physical education
activities and programs to more than 66,000 students. For more on this
grant, click here
.
Preserving San Antonio Missions - Our Priority
Earlier this week, I learned Mission San Jose, part of the San Antonio
Missions, was vandalized.
Mission San Jose, along with the San Antonio Missions, is a legacy for
our children and grandchildren - as well as all Texans. It's a travesty
that this historic mission was vandalized. I urge United States Park
Police and local law enforcement agencies move swiftly to find, arrest
and prosecute the person or people responsible. Anyone with information
can call (210) 534-8875, extension 224.
Meeting with Toyota leaders, discussing how to create jobs in San
Antonio.
April Mobile Office Hours
In April, Field Representatives will be meeting with constituents
throughout 23rd District of Texas to provide help with federal agencies
and departments.
Field staff makes it a priority to be accessible to constituents in the
29-counties that make up the district, and I take the job of addressing
the needs of those I represent seriously. I invite those facing an
issue with a federal agency or department to meet with staff at our
mobile office locations or at any of the district offices. As of this
month, we have helped constituents recover more than $2.5 million in
savings. To see where staff will be this month, click here
.
23 in 1: Marfa
I love to highlight places in 23rd District of Texas. Recently, on the
House floor, I spoke about Marfa, Texas, during the "23 in 1" segment
in which I take viewers and listeners on a quick one minute journey
through the district. The speeches take place while the House is in
session and are broadcast on local C-SPAN channels and on
www.c-span.org. To watch the "23 in 1" on Marfa, click here
.
Art Competition on Display on Facebook Page
In recent days, district offices have been receiving art pieces from
high school students throughout 23rd District of Texas - from El Paso
to San Antonio to Eagle Pass and Del Rio. I've put the art pieces we've
gotten so far on our Facebook page so people can view and appreciate
the talented art produced by our kids. We have some really talented
artists in the district! One of these works will be chosen to hang in
the U.S. Capitol for the next year. To view the art, click here
.
Lastly, thanks again for letting me be your congressman. If I can help
you with a federal agency or issue, please call on any of our offices.
The phone numbers and addresses are listed below. I've never been a big
fan of politics - helping people is my favorite part of the job. Please
put us to work for you.
Sincerely,
Pete P. Gallego
