Dear
friends,
A nation that cannot secure its own borders cannot secure its own
destiny.
Today
because of President Obamas failed policies
we
are experiencing a genuine humanitarian crisis along our Southern
border, plus a supreme test of our governments willingness to protect
our national sovereignty.
To resolve this crisis, we
must be resolute in ensuring that those with no legal right to be here
are returned home as quickly as possible.
To be clear,
it is President Obamas failed policies that led directly to this
crisis.
In June 2012, the President signed an executive order known
as DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) to stop
deportations of those who came to the U.S. illegally as children.
The year
before DACA, 16,000 unaccompanied alien children (known as UACs)
crossed the Southern border illegally.
This year - with DACA in
full effect
the
Homeland Security Department
projects
as many as 90,000 UACs will enter the U.S illegally.
Next
year, the number is projected to reach
160,000.
The President wants to get these individuals processed as quickly
and humanely as possible.
But if that happens, most of them will
be able stay in America illegally for years, if not
indefinitely.
The
Wall Street Journal
recently noted, Thousands of children from Central America are undertaking
a perilous journey to the U.S. border despite warnings from the U.S.
that they will be sent back. In fact, many will get to stay.
Data
from immigration courts, along with interviews with the children and
their advocates, show that few minors are sent home and many are able
to stay for years in the U.S., if not
permanently.
That is unacceptable.
This is a problem that must be fixed, and
the best way to do that is by closing a loophole in the Wilberforce
trafficking law of 2008.
Under that law, a system was put in place
to expedite removal of border crossers from Mexico and Canada.
Border crossers from Central America were exempted.
That was a
mistake.
The consequence is that tens of thousands of
Central American children are fleeing to the United States in order to
take advantage of DACA.
While they misunderstand DACA
it
doesnt provide automatic amnesty to kids who enter our country illegally
they are not wrong in assuming the President may wish to grant
amnesty later on.
Hence, the rush to the border.
We need a
real solution, one that fixes the loophole in the Wilberforce law,
while appropriating the necessary funds to deal with the humanitarian
crisis.
When the crisis first started, President Obama
called for changing the Wilberforce law.
Since then, hes
reversed himself.
Now he wont say whether he supports changing
it.
Over the past few weeks, Ive been saying that any border
security bill should have the following four
things:
Amend the Wilberforce law to treat all a arriving aliens, whether from
Mexico or Central America, the
same
Expedite asylum determinations for newly arriving
aliens
Send the National Guard to the
border
Allow the Border Patrol unfettered access on public
lands
I am hopeful that a bill
incorporating most of these points will be voted on by the House next
week.
