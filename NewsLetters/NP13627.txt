Dear
Neighbor,
As 2013 comes to a close, I wanted to write you to
explain my vote on the recent budget bill and to share with you a few recent
highlights:
Last week, the House voted on
a budget bill (H.J. Res. 59). Though the media has portrayed this as
an ideal compromise,
I voted against it for several
reasons :
1.
The bill increases current spending
limits.
Washington cannot continue to spend money it doesnt
haveperiod.
2.
The bill increases airline fees on
passengers traveling in the U.S.; some fees go up by as much as 124%.
This so-called fee is a not-so-hidden tax. Americans should not have
to pay more taxes to subsidize more Washington
spending.
3.
The bill cuts one percent from the annual Cost of Living Adjustment
(COLA) increase from veteran and military retiree pension benefits,
benefits that were promised when those individuals signed up to serve
our country. This could amount to a 20 percent decrease in some
military pensions over 20 years. Those who have spent their lives protecting
the rest of us should be the
last
to sacrifice what they have
earned in order to pay for even more Washington spending.
Congress should instead cut the billions in aid to
countries who are not our friends, like Pakistan.
Our
veterans are more important than our disloyal and deceptive allies,
and they should be treated as such.
That is why,
next week I will be introducing legislation to restore funding for
military retiree pension benefits, striking the billions of dollars in
foreign aid that we give to Pakistan and Egypt and by requiring the
federal government to sell its unused land (excluding National Parks and
historical sites).
Currently, the federal government owns over
27% of total land in our country (equivalent to the size of Western
Europe). If this unused land was sold today, it could generate up to
$1.1 trillion.

Congress New Years resolution should be to restore the peoples faith in our
government. 2013 has been a year riddled with Washington scandals.
Next year, I will continue to seek answers to Fast &amp; Furious, the
cover up in Benghazi, the abusive IRS targeting certain Americans and
the NSA (National Surveillance Agency) spying on citizens and
threatening our privacy.

Holidays.
And, thats just the way it is!
