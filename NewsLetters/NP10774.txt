On Wednesday, the House Ways &amp; Means Committee met and
approved
a letter to Attorney General Holder to refer Lois Lerner to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution.
Earlier this week, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee released a contempt
report
regarding Ms. Lerner, former Director of the Exempt Organizations Division at the IRS, the office responsible for processing applications for tax exemption.

published by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration in May of 2013, confirmed that since 2010, the IRS had been using inappropriate criteria to identify organizations applying for tax-exempt status.
Yesterday, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee approved a resolution holding Ms. Lerner in contempt for failing to answer questions before Congress.
