Dear David Johnson,
As I begin my second year in office, one of my top priorities
is to enact
comprehensive, humane immigration reform. Last June, the
Senate passed a comprehensive immigration bill with strong bipartisan
support. In the fall, I was proud to be an original co-sponsor of The
Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization
Act (H.R. 15), legislation that closely mirrors the Senate bill.
H.R. 15 includes many of the priorities I've spent the past
year fighting for-most notably, a "pathway to citizenship" that would
allow the 11.7 million undocumented immigrants in the United States to
come out of the shadows.
The bill also would provide an expedited
pathway for DREAMers, the students who came to America as young
children. The bill would clear the family-visa backlog, and would add
additional visas for a range of workers in fields from seasonal
agricultural work to high-skilled technology.
The legislation also
includes many more needed reforms.
However, passing an immigration overhaul this year will be an
uphill battle. The House leadership has indicated that a comprehensive
bill is extremely unlikely to pass the House.
If immigration reform
comes up for a vote at all, it will be as a series of
Republican-sponsored smaller bills that include provisions that would
increase detention, increase penalties, criminalize undocumented
immigrants, and deport DREAMers.
This would be devastating, not only to immigrants currently in
the U.S., but also to all those around world who are waiting for their
chance to move to the United States and experience the American Dream.
This is why I am fighting for comprehensive, humane immigration
reform, and will support legislation the follows the priorities
outlined in H.R. 15.
I've heard from many of you about why
comprehensive immigration reform is important for you.
I hope you will
continue to share those stories with me.
Sincerely,
Grace Meng
Member of Congress

Dear
David Johnson,
As
I
begin
my
second
year
in
office,
one
of
my
top
priorities
is to
enact
comprehensive,
humane
immigration
reform.
Last
June,
the
Senate
passed
a
comprehensive
immigration
bill
with
strong
bipartisan
support.
In
the
fall,
I
was
proud
to
be
an
original
co-sponsor
of
The Border
Security,
Economic
Opportunity,
and
Immigration
Modernization
Act
(H.R.
15),
legislation
that
closely
mirrors
the
Senate
bill.
H.R.
15
includes
many
of
the
priorities
I&#8217;ve
spent
the
past
year
fighting
for&#8211;most
notably,
a
&#8220;pathway
to
citizenship&#8221;
that
would
allow
the
11.7
million
undocumented
immigrants
in
the
United
States
to
come
out
of
the
shadows.
The
bill
also
would
provide
an
expedited
pathway
for
DREAMers,
the
students
who
came to
America as
young
children.
The
bill
would
clear
the
family-visa
backlog,
and
would
add
additional
visas
for
a
range
of
workers
in
fields
from
seasonal
agricultural
work
to
high-skilled
technology.
The
legislation
also
includes
many
more
needed
reforms.
However,
passing
an
immigration
overhaul
this
year
will
be
an
uphill
battle.
The
House
leadership
has
indicated
that
a
comprehensive
bill
is
extremely
unlikely
to
pass
the
House.
If
immigration
reform
comes
up
for
a
vote
at
all,
it
will
be
as
a
series
of
Republican-sponsored
smaller
bills
that
include
provisions
that
would
increase
detention,
increase
penalties,
criminalize
undocumented
immigrants,
and
deport
DREAMers.
This
would
be devastating,
not
only
to
immigrants
currently
in
the
U.S.,
but
also
to
all
those
around
world
who
are
waiting
for
their
chance
to
move
to
the
United
States
and
experience
the
American
Dream.
This
is
why
I
am
fighting
for
comprehensive,
humane
immigration
reform,
and
will
support
legislation
the
follows
the
priorities
outlined
in
H.R.
15.
I&#8217;ve
heard
from
many
of
you
about
why
comprehensive
immigration
reform
is
important
for
you.
I
hope
you
will
continue
to
share
those
stories
with
me.
