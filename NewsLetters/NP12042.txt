Updates From Congressman Valadao
I am truly honored to serve you as your Representative in the United States Congress.
In order for me to effectively represent you in Washington, it is important that you and I are able to communicate with each other.
Email is an easy and effective way for me to update you on what is happening in Washington, activities in the Central Valley, resources available to you, and events that might be of interest to you.
To receive periodic email updates from me, please sign up at
www.Valadao.house.gov/SignUp . If you have friends or family members who would also like to receive updates from me, please forward them this email and ask them to sign up as well!
It is truly a privilege to serve you. Please do not hesitate to contact my office or email me if there is anything I can assist you with.
Sincerely,
David G. Valadao
Member of Congress
