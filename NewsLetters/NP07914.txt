Dear David,
Silly. Ludicrous. Hogwash.
That's how President
Obama's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Gina McCarthy
described worries about the EPA's Clean Water Act (CWA) rule - which is,
in reality, a massive land grab by the Obama
Administration.
In fact, Administrator McCarthy stated on a call to reporters that
her visit to Missouri this week is part of a broader campaign to
reassure the agriculture community about the proposed rule and " set the record straight ."
But, these
worries
and concerns are very warranted. The EPA's proposed
water rule would significantly expand the authority of the federal
government over water almost everywhere.
Not only would this rule
have a devastating impact on Missouri farm families, it would also
inflict serious harm on productive activities like the construction of
homes, businesses, roads, and even the development of
energy.
That's why I
joined
Senator John
Barrasso (Wyo.) and 28 of our colleagues in introducing the "Protecting
Water and Property Rights Act of 2014," which would stop the EPA from
taking over all private and state water in the United States. We cannot
allow the Obama Administration to continue infringing on Missourians'
private properties.
While I am glad to
welcome
Administrator McCarthy to our state,
I encourage her to
listen as much as she talks - she might very well find out that
Missourians' concerns about the expansion of the law are broad-based and
genuine.
