Congressman Lamborn Wants A Longer Comment Period on
the Proposed "Waters of the United States" EPA
Revisions
11/17/14
Recently, Congressman Doug Lamborn joined his
colleagues on a Congressional Inquiry to the EPA requesting, "a 90 day comment
period extension for the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers revision to
the Clean Water Act definition of "Waters of the United States"
proposed on April 21. 2014. As you are aware, this proposal would expand
federal jurisdiction under the CWA to include manmade conveyances,
ditches, and ephemeral water streams. An expansion of this magnitude seems
to give limitless jurisdiction and would drastically impact many of our
constituents."
Please see below for the full text of the
letter:
