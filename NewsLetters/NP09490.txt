We began this
week with an early morning
press conference
at
Fort Hood on Monday with Congressman Bill Flores and LTC Allen West.
During the press conference we discussed the Fort Hood shooting language
that was put in the FY 15 National Defense Authorization Act. I thank
Congressman Flores, LTC Allen West and the community leaders who
attended for joining me.
This
week was a tremendous victory for the victims and families of the
2009 Fort Hood attack . On Thursday, the House passed the FY15
National Defense Authorization Act ( See Roll Call 240 )
which brings the victims and families of the 2009 Fort Hood attack
closer to the justice they deserve by making the victims eligible to
receive the Purple Heart and its
benefits.
The amendment, offered by Congressman Mike Conaway (R-TX11) on behalf of
Congressman Roger Williams (R-TX25) and I, adjusts the Purple Heart
criteria to include service members and civilians who experience an
attack inspired by international terrorism. This provision would be
retroactively effective as of September 11,
2001.
On Wednesday FBI Director James Comey became the first high
ranking Obama Administration official to admit the obvious when
he told Senator John Cornyn (R-TX)
in a Senate Judiciary
Committee hearing that the 2009 terrorist attack at Fort Hood was
inspired by Al-Qaeda.
Additionally, late
Thursday night Senators Ted Cruz and John Cornyn were able to enter the same
language into the
Senates version of the National
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)
to help the victims of the 2009
Fort Hood shooting.
The House also took
steps to
start holding the Department of Veteran
Affairs more accountable
by passing the VA Management Accountability Act
( See Roll Call 229 ). This legislation attempts
to begin restoring trust back into this mismanaged department by
addressing the accountability and leadership problems. This bill gives the
VA secretary much greater authority in firing VA executives who fail
to perform.
Unfortunately, shortly before
the Memorial Day weekend, Senate Democrats put politics in front of
Veterans and blocked the VA Accountability Act. I urge my colleagues in
the Senate to either reconsider this legislation or propose a bill
that helps restore accountability in the
VA.
I am headed back to Texas for Memorial Weekend and will be back in
Washington on Tuesday. Next week, As Chairman of the Homeland Security
Appropriations Subcommittee I will oversee the markup of the FY15
Homeland Security funding bill.
