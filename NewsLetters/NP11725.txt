Rep. Takano Applauds the prioritization of March Air Reserve Base for
MQ-9 Reapers
Last week, the United States Air Force and the National Guard Bureau
chose the California National Guard's 163rd Reconnaissance Wing,
located at March Air Reserve Base, to receive the next tranche of MQ-9
Reaper remotely piloted aircraft (RPA). This is especially important as
they replace the current aging MQ-1 Predator assets at March.
Last year, Rep. Takano (D-Riverside), along with Rep. Ken Calvert
(R-Corona) and Rep. Paul Cook (R-Yucca Valley), included language in
the House National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that would
prioritize bases with formal training units, schools that train pilots
and sensor operators like those at March Air Reserve Base. The
bipartisan group has also been working closely alongside the California
Military Department to accomplish this.
"I'm incredibly pleased that the United States Air Force has chosen
March Air Reserve Base to receive these new RPAs, which will help
continue the base's mission," said Takano. "The men and women of the
163rd Reconnaissance Wing at March are some of our nation's best and
brightest, and with this new asset they will be able to continue saving
lives and providing crucial reconnaissance capabilities now and in the
future."
After the announcement, Major General David Baldwin said, "Since coming
to Congress, Representative Takano has been a staunch supporter of our
men and women in uniform, including those at the 163rd Reconnaissance
Wing at March Air Reserve Base. I want to extend him my greatest
appreciation for helping to acquire federal support for this new
lifesaving air asset, both for domestic disaster missions here at home
and operations overseas. This announcement will help solidify the base's
mission for years to come."

Rep. Takano Releases Statement on President Obama's Budget Proposal
Earlier today, Rep. Mark Takano released the following statement after
President Obama released his budget proposal for fiscal year 2015:
"The budget request submitted today by President Obama is a strong
proposal that will grow our economy, put Americans back to work, make
important investments for our future, and responsibly reduce our
deficit. It sends a clear message to working and middle class Americans
that they have received the short end of the stick for far too long and
that they should be the focal point of our economic policies.
"I'm also pleased to see that President Obama is no longer proposing to
cut Social Security benefits through chained CPI. If implemented,
chained CPI would cut seniors benefits by $650 a year by the time they
reach 75, and more than $1,000 a year by the time they reach 85. Social
Security is one of the most successful social programs of all time and
is a sacred promises that we've made to our nations seniors. I have
long believed that cutting benefits through chained CPI or any other
method would be a clear violation of those promises and am proud to see
that the President now believes so as well."

Rep. Takano Attends Perris Valley Line Groundbreaking Ceremony
Last month, Rep. Mark Takano attended the construction groundbreaking
ceremony for the Perris Valley Line. At the event, Rep. Takano said,
"There are only a few things local officials can do that are more
beneficial than pushing for investments in local infrastructure. It
boosts our economy, creates jobs, increases efficiency, and provides
resources for generations to come.
This brand new 24-mile rail will do just that. It will take an
estimated 4,000 cars off the road each day, and will create hundreds of
jobs for local businesses. Not to mention that public transportation is
good for our environment.
I'm pleased to see construction beginning, and I'm anxiously await its
grand opening later this year."

said
Takano.
&#8220;The
men
and
women
of
the
163rd
Reconnaissance
Wing
at
March
are
some
of
our
nation&#8217;s
best

and
with
this

they
will
be
able
to
continue
saving

now
and

After

Earlier
today,
Rep.
Mark
Takano
released
the
following
statement
after
President

released
his
budget
proposal
for
fiscal
year
2015: &#8220;The
budget
request
submitted
today
by
President
Obama
is
a
strong
proposal
that
will
grow
our
economy,
put
Americans
back
to
work,
make
important
investments
for
our
future,
and
responsibly
reduce
our
deficit.
It
sends
a
clear
message
to
working
and
middle
class
Americans
that
they
have
received
the
short
end
of
the
stick
for
far
too
long
and
that
they
should
be
the
focal
point
of
our
economic
policies.
&#8220;I&#8217;m
also
pleased
to
see
that
President
Obama
is
no
longer
proposing
to
cut
Social
Security
benefits
through
chained
CPI.
If
implemented,
chained
CPI
would
cut
seniors
benefits
by
$650
a
year
by
the
time
they
reach
75,
and
more
than
$1,000
a
year
by
the
time
they
reach
85.
Social
Security
is
one
of
the
most
successful
social
programs
of
all
time
and
is
a
sacred
promises
that
we&#8217;ve
made
to
our
nations
seniors.
I
have
long
believed
that
cutting
benefits
through
chained
CPI
or
any
other
method
would
be
a
clear
violation
of
those
promises
and
am
proud
to
see
that
the
President
now
believes
so
as
well.&#8221;
