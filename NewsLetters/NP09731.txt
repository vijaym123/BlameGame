Shining Light on Dark Money in Politics
On April 30th, I chaired a Senate Rules Committee hearing on the
overwhelmingly negative influence that dark money - or money given by
anonymous donors - has in our political system. Over the course of
almost two hours, we heard testimony from retired Supreme Court Justice
John Paul Stevens and other campaign finance experts from across the
political spectrum. It is highly unusual for a member of the court -
retired or otherwise - to testify before Congress on an issue such as
this, so I was thrilled that Justice Stevens was able to join us. He
provided great insight into past Supreme Court rulings, and outlined
some suggestions for how Congress can reintroduce some balance into our
currently unbalanced campaign finance system.
Read more and watch the hearing here...
The day after the hearing, I went down to the Senate floor to share my
thoughts on the state of campaign finance laws
. I've long known that the situation is
bad, but after conducting months of research and listening to the
witnesses' testimony, it's now clear to me that things are even worse
than I thought.
I have introduced the Real Time Transparency Act of 2014
,
which would require that all campaign contributions of $1000 or more be
filed with the FEC within 48-hours. This legislation, however, is just
a start. I will continue to engage my colleagues from both parties to
try and come up with potential solutions to the pervasive problem of
dark money.

Policy Update
*
Early in April, the Senate voted to extend critical
unemployment benefits
for five months. The legislation,
which took months of bipartisan work, would provide job-seekers and
their families with a vital lifeline as they continue to look for work -
strengthening the U.S. economy in the process. It is now up to the
House of Representatives to provide needed relief to hard pressed
people in Maine and around the country.
*
At the end of April, the Senate failed to move forward with
legislation to raise the minimum wage
. Though I am disappointed that we were unable to giving
hard-working Americans a well-deserved boost, I remain committed to
finding a compromise suitable to both parties that will ensure a
livable wage.
Scenes from Washington
These students from Marshwood High School won the Northeastern States
regional award at the We the People national competition here in
Washington. They certainly made Maine proud!
I had a nice reunion with Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and John
Leonard, the President and CEO of Maine Employers' Mutual Insurance
Company (MEMIC). When I was Governor of Maine, John and I met then
Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii Hirono when she came to Maine to learn
about MEMIC. Years later, she and I are colleagues in the United States
Senate. It's funny how things turn out.
