House Approves "Keep Your Plan"
Legislation
On Friday, the House voted in a bipartisan way to approve
legislation that would allow millions of Americans to keep their
current health care plans. Currently,
Americans across the country are receiving cancellation
notices
from insurance carriers stating they are being dropped
from coverage, even if they like that
coverage.
The president has stated over and over that Americans who
" like their insurance plan
can keep their insurance plan,
period ."
I agree and voted
" Yes " on this commonsense bill.
261 bipartisan House
Members
joined me and voted to allow Americans to keep their current
health insurance plans if they like them and if they want to keep them.
157 House members voted
no.
Whether you support or oppose the president's health care law, we
should all be able to agree that Americans can keep their current plans
if they like them. This was an important tenant of the president's
legislation, it was a promise that the president personally made on
numerous occasions and it was a key provision that helped pass the law in
the first place, and that is why I voted " Yes " on
H.R. 3350
-
the
Keep Your Health Plan Act . The bill passed by a vote
of
261-157 .
The Cost of Washington Mandates
I
took the opportunity to speak on the House floor this week about the
importance of Congress to use our time and efforts to support policies
that put Americans back to work because creating jobs is the key to
growing our economy.
Click here , or on the image above to watch my full
floor remarks.
Recently, I
toured a power station in Wyandotte County where the plant managers
described the difficulties they face from our country not having a clear
national energy policy.
EPA
mandates will force the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) to make costly
modifications - totaling $250 million. This will result in a
15-20
percent monthly increase
in the average electric bill
for consumers, families and businesses in Wyandotte County who are
already pinching pennies in a sluggish
economy.
Also, after a visit to a Johnson County wastewater treatment
facility, I learned new regulations will
increase rates on
JoCo ratepayers by 25 percent .
Continuing
To Fight For Email Privacy Reform
While many other
issues of national importance are continuing to receive Congressional
attention, one of my key focuses remains continuing to push for much-needed
updates to email privacy protections in America. The last time
Congress updated email privacy law was three decades ago - just think how
much innovation and technology improvements have been made since then in
the areas of electronic communication and online
privacy.
This issue continues to gain support - the
legislation I introduced earlier this year -
H.R. 1852 -
the Email Privacy Act
- is receiving
more and more bipartisan support as Americans continue to recognize the
need for reforms. Currently we have
142 cosponsors, including
96 Republicans and 46 Democrats.

I
published an op-ed in WIRED magazine
over the summer
about our need to enact email privacy updates. You can read it
by

also let your voice be heard by
signing this petition
and telling the White House you
want
email privacy
protections updated .
Kansas City Israel
Action Forum
I attended the Kansas City Israel Action
Forum on Sunday afternoon in Overland Park. I was joined by Congressman
Mike Pompeo, Congresswoman Lynn Jenkins, Congressman Billy Long (R-MO)
and Congresswoman Vicky Hartzler (R-MO) for a panel discussion about
the continued importance of a strong relationship between the United
States and Israel.
As a member of
the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, I have
supported the toughest sanctions on Iran -- pressing U.S. Treasury
Secretary Jacob Lew and Secretary of State John Kerry for data on sanction
effectiveness. These are measures critical to U.S. national security
interest and to the security of our closest ally in the middle east:
Israel.
Sanctions have pushed
the economy of Iran into turmoil, severely limiting Iranian oil export
and driving Iranian elections and rhetoric to moderation. While these
are accomplishments to be noted, the real test of sanctions on Iran
is simple: has Iran dismantled its nuclear
program?
As
long as Iran retains its nuclear ambition, we must resist with ever
increasing pressure. We must be unyielding. We must rely on actions, not
rhetoric. We must not "Calm down," as Secretary Kerry has
urged.
As the administration backs off of
toughening sanctions, now is the most critical time for Congress to
show we are unwavering. Weakened sanctions will not strengthen
Secretary Kerry's bargaining power with Iran as nuclear talks continue in
Geneva next week.
This past
week, I joined with 62 of my colleagues in sending a letter to Majority
Leader Reid and Republican Leader McConnell to urge the Senate to take
leadership in taking up rigorous Iran sanctions so that our
representative voice is heard: Iran must abandon their nuclear
ambition.
Staying
In Touch With Kansans
On Thursday evening, I held a
telephone town hall forum from my Washington, D.C. office with thousands
of Kansans back in the 3rd District. During the call, I gave a quick
update on legislative action from Washington, current events from across
the country, and spoke with Kansans on a variety of
topics.
If you haven't taken the time to
stay on a telephone town hall forum in the past, I encourage you to
listen in on one and let me know what you think. I always appreciate the
feedback from Kansans.
While on the call, we covered the most recent
developments involving the Affordable Care Act and effects on Kansans,
the national budget, growing our economy and tax reform, immigration
policy, education reform, as well as the importance of protecting and
preserving Social Security and other entitlement
programs.
If you haven't been on a telephone town hall
call before and would like to be included on future calls, please
email me
and let me
know what phone number to dial. We'll be sure you are included on
calls in the future.
