Dear
Friend,
Once a year on the Fourth of July, we as a nation come together with
our barbeques, family baseball games and neighborhood firework shows
to celebrate the freedoms that we get to take part in as Americans. We
celebrate our independence and the liberties that were established
238 years ago, which so many have fought and died for since. Our
freedoms are vital to the continued greatness that this country has to offer.
Don't forget to thank a veteran or servicemen today for all that they
do to protect everything that we stand for.
Happy Fourth of
July!
I had a great
time at home this week.
On Saturday I was honored to address
the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials
(NALEO)s 31 st
annual conference and share my support for
top-to-bottom immigration reform for our broken system. It is always a
privilege to speak to such established leaders in the Latino community
on this crucial topic.
On Monday I visited the state-of-the-art Amazon.com fulfillment
center in Patterson. It's great to see Amazon.com bringing jobs to the
city.
I also visited with Luis Molina, the mayor
of Patterson, and Fire Chief Hall to review plans for the new public
safety center. Im pleased to see they have secured the ground for the
building!
I had the great
honor on Tuesday of hosting the first naturalization ceremony in many
years in Modesto. I met more than 100 new Americans from 17 different
countries who together were swearing the oath of allegiance to the
country we all love. As I watched them take the oath, I was awed by how much
work each had done to get to that moment.
What a wonderful week
to recognize that kind of commitment to our nation.
Being able to meet some of these
proud individuals and hearing their stories of their personal journeys
to citizenship made me feel thankful to live in a nation of
immigrants.
On Wednesday I
convened the second meeting of my womens advisory committee. We spoke
about several of the
bills I voted on in May to help stop
the tragic crime of human trafficking in the Central Valley . Even
one victim is too many, and I'm looking forward to hearing feedback
on this issue and many others from the committee.
I
wish you all a safe and happy Independence Day and a
weekend!
