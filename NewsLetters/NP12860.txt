It&rsquo;s 2014. That means our campaign is officially switching into high gear.
To be honest, we&rsquo;ve already been working really hard to get Cheri reelected.
Why so early? For one, last month, Cheri&rsquo;s opponent Bobby Schilling bragged about how he will raise $2 million from his Tea Party backers to spend against us. But most of all, winning tough elections, like this one, means preparing ahead of time so we&rsquo;re able to fight back against all the negative ads and nasty attacks. If you&rsquo;re planning to make a 2014 donation for Cheri, will you consider making it early, when your gift will have the biggest impact?

David, we&rsquo;re working every day to keep Illinois&rsquo; 17th district in the hands of an experienced, responsible leader. But the truth is, we can&rsquo;t get Cheri reelected without a team of dedicated supporters like you.
Let&rsquo;s make sure Cheri has what it takes. Chip in a few dollars to help us start off strong in 2014. http://action.cheribustos.com/Strong-Start
