Dear Friends,
Thank you very much for you interest in the panel on Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease I held yesterday in San Mateo. We had a great turnout and were at capacity, so we streamed the event live for the many of you who we could not accommodate in person because of space limitation. Thank you for submitting your questions online.
For those of you who would like to watch the panel again or those of you who missed the event, I would like to share the video with you. You can watch the panel in its entirety
on my YouTube page .
The San Francisco Chronicle also ran an opinion piece yesterday titled " Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease hits women hardest as caregivers, patients ," in case you missed it.
I will continue to work on raising awareness and increasing federal funding for research on this cruel disease. Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease deserves the same attention and support other diseases have received. It&rsquo;s the only way we can find more treatments and eventually a cure.
You can find additional helpful information on the
National Institute on Aging website .
Thank you again in your interest in this important issue!
All the best,
