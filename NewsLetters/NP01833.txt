Dear Friend,
Early this morning, the U.S. Senate passed
bipartisan energy efficiency legislation that I introduced with
Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) that will create jobs, save consumers money, and
reduce pollution in a smart, effective and affordable way. This bill
is the result of years of hard work with members on both sides of the
aisle, business and environmental groups and countless stakeholders
who all have an interest in smart pragmatic energy
policy.
Energy efficiency is the cheapest and fastest way to address our
nation's energy challenges and it holds enormous potential for America's
energy future. Today weve taken an important step toward realizing that
future. Im optimistic that the House will advance this bill and I
look forward to it receiving the Presidents
signature.
Thank you to everyone, all the families, businesses and Granite Staters
who lent their support to the fight for commonsense energy efficiency
legislation over the past four years. It is your collective voice that
helped us build and sustain the momentum to reach this point. Your
support was critical and I look forward to continuing to advocate for
policies that protect our environment, save taxpayers money and grow our
economy.
Sincerely,
Jeanne

Shaheen Staffers
Honored
Throughout my
career in public service, Ive had the opportunity to work with incredibly
dedicated and talented staff members. These men and women put in long
hours and take on the toughest jobs with a drive and positive
attitude that inspires the best in their co-workers. They strive to make a
difference for families throughout New Hampshire and improve the lives
of everyone in the Granite State.
Today I would like
to recognize the very special achievements of two of my Senate staff
members, Alison MacDonald and Chuck Henderson, who recently have been
honored with prestigious awards for their extraordinary work on behalf
of the people of New Hampshire.
In recent days,
Chuck was notified that he is the recipient of the
2015 Congressman
John Joseph Moakley Award for Exemplary Public Service.
Each
year, this award recognizes just one truly outstanding staff member from
among the hundreds of staffers serving New Englands delegation in
Congress. I cant say enough about the remarkable work Chuck has done on
behalf of New Hampshires North Country. As a lifelong resident, Chuck
has a deep understanding of the regions challenges, and has earned
the respect and trust of everyone with whom he has worked. His dedicated
service is a testament to his love for the North Country and New
Hampshire, and his commitment to public service. This award is well
deserved.
Earlier this month, Alison was honored with Planned
Parenthood's
Stand Up Staffer of the Year
award for her dedication to
improving access to healthcare and improving patient care. Alison has
been a passionate advocate for women, children and families in New
Hampshire, effecting meaningful change for everyone in the Granite
State. She never shies from tough tasks, and approaches every challenge
with a smile. I can think of no one more deserving of the
Stand Up
Staffer of the Year
award.
To both Alison and
Chuck, thank you for your exceptional public service, and for all your
hard work on behalf of the people of New Hampshire.
Congratulations!
