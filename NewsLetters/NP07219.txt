Have we connected on Facebook yet?
Id like to invite you to join my Facebook community and begin connecting with me on a daily basis. Interacting on Facebook gives me the opportunity to provide you with real-time updates from Washington, D.C. and around the District, and it also provides a way for constituents of the Fourth District of Virginia to express their opinions and engage in the kind of dialogue that will help move our nation forward.

Below Ive included a snapshot of some of the posts I have shared recently, so you can get an idea of what type of information Im sharing on Facebook.
