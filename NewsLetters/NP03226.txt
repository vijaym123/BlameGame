David -- Last night, I had the honor of listening to President Obama present his ideas to help the middle class and strengthen America. But for me, the best part of the night was welcoming Mike Malmstrom of Moline to the Capitol.
Mike has been a tireless advocate for the veterans of our region, and is dedicated to ending homelessness among veterans.
I invited Mike to the State of the Union because of his commitment to protecting our veterans, who have risked so much to defend our freedom.
People like Mike inspire me to keep fighting for you and to make sure your voice is heard. As we get back to work in Washington, let me know what you thought about last night and what you want me to focus on in the next two years. Thanks,
