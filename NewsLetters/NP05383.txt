Dear Friend,
It&rsquo;s Day Two of our Donor Weekend of Action, and we&rsquo;re getting close to our 7O,OOO donor goal.
It&rsquo;s not too late to support our grassroots network with a $5 contribution.
Give $5 and get us closer to 7O,OOO strong for Ed.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
I&rsquo;ve gotta tell you, the numbers I see outside groups spending these days leave me speechless.
But even with all of that money, the Kochs can&rsquo;t compete with our ability to organize.
Democrats have a massive advantage when it comes to small donations
-- the kinds of contributions middle class people can make, not the six-figure checks of Koch World. We have to capitalize on that advantage, and you can help -- make your first $5 contribution to Ed, and help us win in November.
Thanks,
Colleen
