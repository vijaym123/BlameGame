Video of the Week:
I had the opportunity to join Congresswoman Eddie
Bernice Johnson (D-TX) last week on CNN to discuss the government's
strategy in helping to contain the Ebola virus. I again stressed the
need for travel restrictions in order to isolate and contain the virus.

Wednesday morning,
I
participated in a conference call
with the N.C. Congressional delegation,
state representatives and local health officials to discuss North
Carolinas ongoing efforts to remain prepared during the Ebola outbreak.
During Wednesdays call, N.C. Department of Health and Human Services
Secretary, Aldona Wos, reiterated that N.C. hospital personnel have
been briefed and are implementing the most-recent guidelines issued by
the Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC). I can assure you
that federal and state officials will continue to collaborate in a
bipartisan manner to prevent the spread of this disease. I hope you will
check out
two different
interviews
I gave with
Newsmax
TV
on Ebola.
Just this past week, North Carolinas largest health insurer, Blue
Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS), said that the average rate for buyers
will rise by more than 13 percent !
As an example, the BCBS insurer cited a typical rate for a 45-year-old
non-smoking man who lives in Raleigh. Without a federal subsidy, his
premium would increase to about $420 per month. These large jumps in
premiums are incredibly expensive and overly burdensome for North
Carolina families, young adults and retirees. We need to replace Obamacare
with patient-centered alternatives, which actually provide better
quality care and affordable rates.
Lastly, I hope you will
inform your friends and high school students that applications for
Service Academy Nominations are due on October 31. If you would like
additional information on the application process or have questions, do not
hesitate to call my Dunn Office at 910-230-1910.
The Polar Bear Exhibit:
The Polar Bear
Exhibit in Asheboro has been undergoing renovations since 2011, and the
grand opening took place on Thursday. It was great visiting and seeing
the new exhibit areas, including a new maternity den for any future
baby polar bears!
Loved watching the polar bears roam around in their new habitat.
It was such a fun way to spend part of my morning, and I enjoyed
visiting with Governor McCrory and N.C. House Representative, Pat Hurley
(R-Randolph)!
Speaking to
Fox News About Ebola:
Last Sunday, I joined a Fox News show called
"America's News Headquarters" and expressed my frustration over the
recently-appointed "Ebola Czar." This new "Czar" has no healthcare background
whatsoever, which is disappointing to say the least. He is nothing
more than a political operative who is now required to take the fall due
to the Obama Administrations failure to lead.
