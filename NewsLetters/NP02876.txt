Wanted: An Independent Voice
on Defense
By Rep. Rodney
Frelinghuysen (NJ-11)
Chairman of the House
Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense
Ashton Carter told the Senate Armed Services Committee this week
that he will be an independent voice as the new Secretary of
Defense.
He indicated he will not be a rubber stamp for the President and
he wont be pushed around.
In fact, he made several
statements about public policy designed to prove his point.
Then, as if
on cue, the White House openly disagreed with its own nominee on many
of his statements.
Sound familiar?
Just as
predecessors Gates, Panetta and Hagel discovered, Secretary Carter will quickly
find out that Americas military policy emanates not from the
Pentagon, but from the National Security Council at the White
House.
And where has the White House taken us?
Under this
Presidents watch:
Weve lost most of Iraq to Iran and the
rest to ISIS;
Iran is very close to developing a nuclear
weapon;
Were in the process of relinquishing all the
gains weve fought for in Afghanistan to the Taliban or tribal
warlords;
We have deserted the Syrian
people;
The government we supported in Yemen has collapsed and our Embassy
there has been evacuated;
Released detainees from
Guantanamo Bay have returned to the fight;
Libya is now
officially a basket-case;
We have basically abandoned
Ukraine to Russia;
At the same time, our defense budget is
sliding rapidly to the point where we will soon have an Army smaller
than it was before World War 2, fewer Navy ships than ever before and an
Air Force that is smaller than ever and flies older aircraft than at
any point in its existence;
Clearly, Secretary
Carter will have his work cut out for him.
As a well-respected
professional, we need his independent voice to begin to turn these
incredibly dangerous trends around.
A good place to start is in
Eastern Europe where Ukrainian President Poroshenko has repeatedly
asked the Obama Administration to go beyond bandages, tents and night
vision goggles and provide lethal aid in their escalating battle with
Russia.
It has been said that Vladimir Putins goal is to keep
Ukraine out of NATO and keep NATO out of Ukraine.
In this
context, I have written to President Obama three times in the last year
urging him to grant Major Non-NATO Ally status to Ukraine.
This
declaration would allow the U.S. to deliver excess defense articles to
the Ukrainian military and enter into bilateral training
agreements.
MREs and blankets will not turn the tide against Russias
military might.
As the Russian military trains and equips insurgents,
Ukraine needs lethal assistance to protect its people and preserve its
independence.
But so far, calls for arms and munitions to
Ukraine have gone unheeded.
Our nation has long been
a reliable force for stability and freedom in the world.
We have
done so by supporting our friends, deterring our enemies and acting
with certainty and predictability.
Former Prime
Minister of Britain, Tony Blair, addressed the House Republican Conference
last month.
He said, Dont worry about whether people around the
world love you. What the world needs is for America to be
strong.
I hope the new Defense Secretary uses his independence to
reinforce that notion each and every day for the next two
years!
