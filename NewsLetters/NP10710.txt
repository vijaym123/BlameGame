Bipartisan action in the Senate on unemployment insurance is a crucial step for economic security for nearly 100,000 Georgians, and now is the time for long overdue action in the House. The economic crisis suffered from the cut off of unemployment compensation has continued for 3 months, spread to more than 2 million Americans and cost our state's economy $110 million. It is time for Speaker Boehner and my House Republican friends to listen to the American people and restore this vital economic lifeline that helps people support their families and pay their bills while they look for a new job.
To force action, I have joined with 192 of my Democratic colleagues in signing a petition to hold a vote on extending unemployment insurance.
RAISE THE WAGE
The American people want and deserve an economy that works for everyone - an economy where a hard day's work earns a decent day's pay, and everyone has the opportunity to build a brighter future for themselves and their families.
But today, the low minimum wage forces many hard working Americans to live in poverty.
[cid:image012.jpg@01CF5318.16569FD0] I would like to see my Republican colleagues allow a vote on raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour - giving a long overdue pay raise to at least 25 million men and women across the country, and lifting from 1 to 4.5 million Americans out of poverty.
I am with the 195 members of Congress who have signed a petition to force a vote for the millions of workers who deserve this long overdue pay raise.
Economists and experts agree: a higher minimum wage is good for our economy, our workers, and our long-term growth.
It is time for Republicans to join Democrats in doing the right thing and vote to give America a raise.
In America, the land of opportunity, no one who works full time should have to raise their family in poverty. I am fighting to raise the minimum wage, which would give more than 500,000 hardworking Georgians a pay raise, totaling $1.3 billion in additional income here in Georgia.
I'm ready to vote on that today. For more, click HERE . To see my floor speech, click HERE .

Dear
F riends,
I commend the Senate bipartisan action last night on legislation to extend unemployment insurance for nearly 3 million Americans, and call on the House to follow suit.
The Senate passed the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act by a vote of 59 to 38, which retroactively extends emergency unemployment insurance through the end of May.
