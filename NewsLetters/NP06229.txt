Dear Friend,
Please see the helpful information
below from our Maricopa County District 2 Supervisor Steve
Chucri. Don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions
on how to best prepare for the anticipated heavy rain and flash
floods!
Stay
safe,
County
Urges Residents to Prepare for Heavy Rain, Flash
Floods
Coordinating with Businesses
and Cities to Provide Resources and
Information
Dear Neighbors,
In anticipation of
heavy rainfall due to Hurricane Odile converging with monsoon
moisture, the Flood Control District of Maricopa County is urging valley
residents to be prepared for another round of storm events and flash
floods.
At this time it is unknown if the
remnants of Odile will continue its current path towards Phoenix or shift
to the east. Either way, the county will likely experience heavy rain
so residents should be ready.
Information
is one of the most powerful tools at our disposal as we prepare for
these upcoming storms, said Denny Barney, Chairman of the Flood
Control District and District 1 Supervisor. We are working with cities,
towns and agencies countywide to make sure that information about storm
preparation and recovery is available and easily
accessible.
Similar to the storm that occurred on Monday,
September 8, the abundance of tropical moisture combined with monsoon
thunderstorms could mean widespread flash floods and a large amount of
rain in a short period of time.
Staff at the
District says that there are things that you can do today. These
items include:
Cleaning out
drainage ditches and drainage
pipes
Securing or removing personal property that is in an area where storm
water flows
Raising property on
blocks in and around your home
Getting
sand and preparing sand bags
Contact
your insurance agent to check your flood insurance
coverage
We want to make sure that our
citizens are safe and they take the necessary steps to protect their
property, said Steve Chucri, who represents District 2 on the board. While
we are confident that our county flood control structures will operate
as designed, citizens may still experience localized flooding if rain
falls hard in their particular
neighborhood.
Please check the
Arizona Emergency Information
Network (AZEIN)
for the latest information on emergency centers
and storm resources.
Maricopa County
and the
Flood Control Districts
websites will post
information as soon as it becomes available. Accessing
fcd.maricopa.gov
link from your mobile device will launch the
Districts mobile tool which residents can use to obtain rainfall data and
stream flow information.
We are preparing
for similar weather to what was experienced last week, said Bill Wiley,
Chief Engineer and General Manager of the Flood Control District. We
urge county residents to be proactive in preparation for this storm.
Although we cant predict what areas will be impacted, everyone should
have a flood readiness action plan and be ready to put it into action
if needed.
The following members of the
Arizona Rock Products Association have generously donated sand to
local fire departments: M.R. Tanner Mining, Hanson Aggregates, CEMEX,
Vulcan, Arizona Materials, Drake, and
SRMG.
Residents who need to bag sand should contact their city to coordinate
their bagging efforts: Carefree, Cave Creek, Fountain Hills, Apache
Junction, Gilbert, Phoenix, Scottsdale and
Mesa.
Drake Materials, Arizona Rock Products Association Member, will
have sand (and a limited number of sand bags available) for residents
to shovel what they need. Hours of operation are 5:30 am to 1:30 pm.
The location in Mesa is:
1800 North Alma
School Road, Mesa, AZ 85201
Access is from Alma School
Road immediately north of the Red Mountain
Freeway
Here are additional reminders to help keep you safe during
monsoon storms:
Stay
informed and ahead of the storm by checking the local weather
forecasts
Do not enter flooded intersections or
washes
If you accidentally drive onto
a flood street, turn around if you can do so
safely
The District encourages residents who
witness flooding in their area to report it at
http://reportaflood.org , a site used by the District to identify flooding
throughout the county.
Sincerely,
Steve
Chucri, District 2
