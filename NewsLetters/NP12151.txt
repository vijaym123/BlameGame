The Buffalo News: Collins seeks to ban federal dollars for Cuomo
college for convicts plan
February 20, 2014
Rep. Chris Collins Thursday jacked up his opposition to Gov. Andrew M.
Cuomo's proposal to provide college educations for prison inmates by
introducing legislation blocking use of federal dollars for the
program.
Collins said the federal Bureau of Prisons provides states with funding
for educational and other programs at state prisons and correctional
facilities, adding his bill would ban states from using the money to
fund college degree programs for convicted criminals.
"The governor's latest plan to fund college educations for convicted
criminals with New Yorkers' tax dollars is an insult to law-abiding
citizens all across our state," he said. "We hear over and over again
from politicians concerned about the growing cost of higher education
and the amount of student debt our young people are sacked with after
earning their degree. Strangely, many of these same politicians think
tax dollars should be spent to give convicted criminals a free college
degree."
Collins said he will formally introduce the legislation in the coming
days.
NY State of Politics: Collins wants to block federal aid for college in
prison plan
February 20, 2014
Republican Rep. Chris Collins plans to introduce a bill that would
block any federal funds to a Gov. Andrew Cuomo-backed program that will
provide college-level courses to state prison inmates.
"The Governor's latest plan to fund college educations for convicted
criminals with New Yorkers' tax dollars is an insult to law abiding
citizens all across our state," Collins said in a statement. "We hear
over and over again from politicians concerned about the growing cost
of higher education and the amount of student debt our young people are
sacked with after earning their degree. Strangely, many of these same
politicians think tax dollars should be spent to give convicted
criminals a free college degree."
Cuomo's plan is aimed at reducing recidivism in the state's prison
system.
It's not entirely clear how much the plan will cost, but Cuomo's office
points to the $60,000-a-year annual cost of incarceration versus the
$5,000-a-year bill to provide a bachelor or associates degree to an
inmate.
Collins, however, says the Federal Bureau of Prisons does grant states
funding for educational programs in state prisons and correctional
facilities.
The bill, which Collins says he'll introduce in the coming days, would
ban states from access to that money for college programs in prisons.
Republicans - mostly state lawmakers and potential candidate for
governor Rob Astorino - have blasted Cuomo for proposing the program,
which would be located at 10 prisons around the state.
Backers of the plan include state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman,
as well as members of the Legislature's black and Hispanic caucus.
Collins, a former Erie County executive who once considered a run for
governor himself, last year ruled out a statewide campaign.
Sincerely,
CHRIS COLLINS
Member of Congress
Vision: The United States of America will reclaim its past glory as the
Land of Opportunity, restoring the promise of the American Dream for
our children and grandchildren.
