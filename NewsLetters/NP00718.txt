A Weekly e-Newsletter from
Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA)
May 15, 2015
Dear Friends,
As chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I made it a
personal commitment to make sure the Department of Veterans Affairs
rises to meet the challenge of implementing necessary reforms on behalf
of all of America's veterans. In late April, I made a trip with the
committee to host a field hearing regarding the Department of Veterans
Affairs construction of a new medical center in Denver, Colo. The cost
of the facility has climbed to $1.7 billion, which is hundreds of
millions of dollars over budget and makes this project the most
expensive hospital construction in the VA's history.
The committee made it very clear at the April 24, 2015, hearing that we
expected a full report from the VA about its plans to address the
unacceptable surge in costs, delays and mismanagement of the
construction at the replacement Denver VA Medical Center. Because of a
near complete and total lack of focus on the project at the highest
levels of VA and the department's disregard for congressional
oversight, the future of the Denver replacement hospital is unclear.
Instead of putting forth a realistic plan for covering the enormous
cost overruns in Denver by finding efficiencies in its existing budget
and eliminating waste, VA has essentially demanded that taxpayers
subsidize the department's incompetence with an $830 million bailout.
Incredibly, VA is asking for this bailout in the absence of any
accountability whatsoever for the problems in Denver while just today
the public learned the department is improperly spending as much as $6
billion on procurements per year.
Congress will not tolerate any more empty VA promises. So if the
department is serious about getting the Denver project back on track,
it needs to show us rather than tell us. I issued a statement along
with U.S. Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Calif., who serves as chair of the U.S.
House Veterans' Affairs Committee yesterday. To read the entire
statement, click here

Fighting Obama's Unilateral Immigration Amnesty
This week, I continued my fight against the president's unilateral
amnesty actions. I joined my colleagues in the U.S. House and Senate to
file an amicus brief with the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals on behalf of
Georgia and 25 other states, arguing that President Obama's unilateral,
deferred-action programs for illegal immigrants are unconstitutional.
The amicus brief was filed in
the case of Texas v. United States. Oral arguments were heard by the
5th Circuit Court of Appeals on April 17, 2015.
The U.S. District Court in Texas said in February that President
Obama's action on immigration is illegal.
Any attempt to circumvent Congress and
grant amnesty to millions in this country illegally is unacceptable and
unconstitutional.
The president continues to circumvent Congress by executive action, and
if Congress must use the courts to force the president to follow the
laws he has sworn to uphold, then so be it.
Reigning in the EPA
This week, I co-sponsored the Affordable Reliable Energy Now Act to
roll back the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed new rule to
regulate greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants. The
Affordable Reliable Energy Now Act will ensure reliable and affordable
energy, put jobs and the economy first and curb federal overreach. For

Providing Quality Care for our Veterans
At a Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs hearing on Tuesday, I
expressed my desire to have a partnership between the private sector
and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in its implementation of
the Veterans Choice Act. If private contractors and the agency can't
work together seamlessly, the Veterans Choice Program will never work.
Also, I questioned Sloan Gibson, deputy secretary of the VA, about what
the VA is doing to ensure that each VA Medical Center has implemented
the program correctly,
and I shared concerns that the culture in
lower levels of the Veterans Health Administration does not support
health care choices for veterans.

Truck Rule Would Save Lives
On Thursday, Sen. David Perdue and I called on the Obama administration
to act expeditiously to adopt a long-overdue and much-needed safety
measure that would require large trucks to have speed limit devices to
cap maximum speeds
to a predetermined mileage-per-hour. This
proposed mandate has the ability to greatly reduce the number of
accidents caused by speeding trucks that often result in serious injury
or death.
In a letter to U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx
, we voiced serious concerns over the numerous negligent delays
that have occurred since 2011 on issuance of the Department of
Transportation's long-overdue rule to mandate electronic speed limiting
devices on the country's heaviest trucks. Had this life-saving measure
already been enacted as promised more than six years ago, it could have
prevented the deaths of five young nursing students who were run over
by a tractor-trailer truck while traveling on Interstate 16 between
Statesboro and Savannah, Ga., on April 22, 2015. This is an issue I
have been pressing with the U.S. Department of Transportation for some
time, and it is time for full implementation.
Helping Americans Prepare for Retirement
On Wednesday, I introduced the Lifetime Income Disclosure Act, S. 267,
to help Americans plan in advance to help ensure they do not outlive
their retirement savings.
This legislation would help provide Americans annual statements with
their projected monthly income based on the current balance of their
401(k). This information not only helps Americans to plan, but also
helps them to save more during their working years.
Georgia News
Last weekend, I had the pleasure of hosting one of my favorite annual
events, Military Academy Day, at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta,
Ga. More than 1,200 Georgians attended this special opportunity to
learn about attending our nation's service academies.
I also spoke at a summit on Monday in Atlanta with Sen. Bob Corker,
R-Tenn., about ending the scourge of human trafficking. In April, the
Senate passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act
by a vote of 99-0.
I was also delighted to greet students and families from across Georgia
in my Washington, D.C., office this week. Any time you are in our
nation's capital, please stop by our office for home state products.
We'll treat you to Georgia peanuts and refreshing beverages straight

What's on Tap?
Next week, the Senate will continue debate on trade agreements.

Weekly
e-Newsletter
from
Senator
Johnny
Isakson
(R-GA)

2015
Dear
Friends,
As
chairman
of
the
Senate
Committee
on
Veterans'
Affairs,
I
made
it
a
personal
commitment
to
make
sure
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
rises
to
meet
the
challenge
of
implementing
necessary
reforms
on
behalf
of
all
of
America's
veterans.
In
late
April,
I
made
a
trip
with
the
committee
to
host
a
field
hearing
regarding
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
construction
of
a
new
medical
center
in
Denver,
Colo.
The
cost
of
the
facility
has
climbed
to
$1.7
billion,
which
is
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
over
budget
and
makes
this
project
the
most
expensive
hospital
construction
in
the
VA's
history.
The
committee
made
it
very
clear
at
the
April
24,
2015,
hearing
that
we
expected
a
full
report
from
the
VA
about
its
plans
to
address
the
unacceptable
surge
in
costs,
delays
and
mismanagement
of
the
construction
at
the
replacement
Denver
VA
Medical
Center.
Because
of
a
near
complete
and
total
lack
of
focus
on
the
project
at
the
highest
levels
of
VA
and
the
department's
disregard
for
congressional
oversight,
the
future
of
the
Denver
replacement
hospital
is
unclear.
Instead
of
putting
forth
a
realistic
plan
for
covering
the
enormous
cost
overruns
in
Denver
by
finding
efficiencies
in
its
existing
budget
and
eliminating
waste,
VA
has
essentially
demanded
that
taxpayers
subsidize
the
department's
incompetence
with
an
$830
million
bailout.
Incredibly,
VA
is
asking
for
this
bailout
in
the
absence
of
any
accountability
whatsoever
for
the
problems
in
Denver
while
just
today
the
public
learned
the
department
is
improperly
spending
as
much
as
$6
billion
on
procurements
per
year.
Congress
will
not
tolerate
any
more
empty
VA
promises.
So
if
the
department
is
serious
about
getting
the
Denver
project
back
on
track,
it
needs
to
show
us
rather
than
tell
us.
I
issued
a
statement
along
with
U.S.
Rep.
Jeff
Miller,
R-Calif.,
who
serves
as
chair
of
the
U.S.
House
Veterans'
Affairs
Committee
yesterday.

Fighting
Obama's
Unilateral
Immigration
Amnesty
This
week,
I
continued
my
fight
against
the
president's
unilateral
amnesty
actions.
I
joined
my
colleagues
in
the
U.S.
House
and
Senate
to
file
an
amicus
brief
with
the
5th
Circuit
Court
of
Appeals
on
behalf
of
Georgia
and
25
other
states,
arguing
that
President
Obama's
unilateral,
deferred-action
programs
for
illegal
immigrants
are
unconstitutional.
The
amicus
brief
was
filed
in
the
case
of
Texas
v.
United
States .
Oral
arguments
were
heard
by
the
5th
Circuit
Court
of
Appeals
on
April
17,
2015.
The
U.S.
District
Court
in
Texas
said
in
February
that
President
Obama's
action
on
immigration
is
illegal.
Any
attempt
to
circumvent
Congress
and
grant
amnesty
to
millions
in
this
country
illegally
is
unacceptable
and
unconstitutional.
The
president
continues
to
circumvent
Congress
by
executive
action,
and
if
Congress
must
use
the
courts
to
force
the
president
to
follow
the
laws
he
has
sworn
to
uphold,
then
so
be
it.

This

I
co-sponsored
the

roll

the
Environmental
Protection
Agency's
proposed
new
rule
to
regulate
greenhouse

The

Providing
Quality
Care
for
our
Veterans
At
a
Senate
Committee
on
Veterans'
Affairs
hearing
on
Tuesday,
I
expressed
my
desire
to
have
a
partnership
between
the
private
sector
and
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
in
its
implementation
of
the
Veterans
Choice
Act .
If
private
contractors
and
the
agency
can't
work
together
seamlessly,
the
Veterans
Choice
Program
will
never
work.
Also,
I
questioned
Sloan
Gibson,
deputy
secretary
of
the
VA,
about
what
the
VA
is
doing
to
ensure
that
each
VA
Medical
Center
has
implemented
the
program
correctly,
and
I
shared
concerns
that
the
culture
in
lower
levels
of
the
Veterans
Health
Administration
does
not
support
health
care
choices
for
veterans.

Truck
Rule
Would
Save
Lives
On
Thursday,
Sen.
David
Perdue
and
I
called
on
the
Obama
administration
to
act
expeditiously
to
adopt
a
long-overdue

much-needed
safety
measure
that
would
require
large
trucks
to
have
speed

to
cap
maximum

This
proposed

has
the
ability
to
greatly
reduce
the
number
of
accidents
caused
by
speeding
trucks
that
often
result
in
serious
injury
or
death.
In
a
letter
to
U.S.
Secretary
of
Transportation
Anthony
Foxx ,
we
voiced
serious
concerns
over
the
numerous
negligent
delays
that
have
occurred
since
2011
on
issuance
of
the
Department
of
Transportation's
long-overdue
rule
to
mandate
electronic
speed
limiting
devices
on
the
country's
heaviest
trucks.
Had
this
life-saving
measure
already
been
enacted
as

more
than
six
years

it
could
have
prevented
the
deaths
of
five
young
nursing
students
who
were
run
over
by
a
tractor-trailer
truck
while
traveling
on
Interstate
16
between
Statesboro
and
Savannah,
Ga.,
on
April
22,
2015.
This
is
an
issue
I
have
been
pressing
with
the
U.S.
Department
of
Transportation
for
some
time,
and
it
is
time
for
full
implementation.
Helping
Americans
Prepare
for
Retirement
On
Wednesday,
I
introduced
the
Lifetime
Income
Disclosure
Act ,
S.
267,
to
help
Americans
plan
in
advance
to
help
ensure
they
do
not
outlive
their
retirement
savings.
This
legislation
would
help
provide
Americans
annual
statements
with
their
projected
monthly
income
based
on
the
current
balance
of
their
401(k).
This
information
not
only
helps
Americans
to
plan,
but
also
helps
them
to
save
more
during
their
working
years.
