Dear
Friend,
The exact origins of Memorial Day are
somewhat unclear, but what this somber day commemorates is not. We are
thankful for the service of so many men and women, past and present, in our
nations armed forces, yet we set aside today to honor the heroes who
have made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our
freedom.
More than one million men and women have had their lives cut short
in the line of duty. It is an astounding price to have paid for
freedom and one that must never be forgotten nor taken for
granted.
While we reflect on their sacrifice and remember the fallen
today, we must also honor their memories every day of the year by
fulfilling the promises we have made to the current members of our armed
forces and our veterans.
Those who are currently serving must
have a clearly-defined mission and be given the tools and support to
carry out that mission successfully.
Those who have served
must be treated with the honor, dignity and respect they deserve and
have our promises to them fulfilled.
For decades, our
enemies have tested our strength; yet we continue to demonstrate our
resolve. America and the world are better places because of the courage
our veterans and service members have shown. Because of them, the world
knows America will fight against the evil of oppression and for the
advancement of freedom.
Thank you to all service members,
past and present, who have answered the call and served with bravery,
honor and commitment; and may God bless our fallen
heroes.
Sincerely,
Steve
