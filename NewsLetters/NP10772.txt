Progress Made on Equal Pay,
But More Work to Do
Dear Friend,
This week, our nation marked Equal Pay Day, the date when women's
earnings finally catch up to what men were paid in the previous year.
For too long, pay discrimination has denied women the income they
deserve, hurt workers and our economy, and undermined our nation's
values of equality and opportunity.
I strongly commend President Obama for marking this year's Equal Pay
Day by signing executive measures to help close the unacceptable gender
pay gap. In January, 55 of my fellow Democratic congresswomen in the
House and I wrote a letter
to the president urging him to take this action, which will increase
wage transparency for federal government contractors.
These important measures will promote
fairness in the workplace and make it harder for contractors doing
business with our government to conceal pay discrimination. But we
still have a long way to go to ensure income equality for women.
In Pennsylvania, women are paid just 76 cents on average for every
dollar paid to men, according to the National Partnership for Women and
Families. The wage gap is even worse African American and Hispanic
women. In Pennsylvania, African American women make 64 cents and Latino
women earn 54 cents for every dollar paid to a white, non-Hispanic man,
according to the National Partnership. This is shameful and we must do
better.
In Congress, I have fought for equal pay for equal work. I supported
the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to reverse a harmful Supreme Court
decision that kept women from pursuing pay discrimination claims. I
have also pushed Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 377),
which would update and strengthen the 1963 Equal Pay Act.
As a mother and a grandmother, I will keep fighting to close the gender
wage gap. Ending pay disparity will strengthen our families, our
communities and our economy.
Sincerely,
Allyson Y. Schwartz
Member of Congress

Progress
Made
on
Equal
Pay,
But
More
Work
to
Do
Dear
Friend,
This
week,
our
nation
marked
Equal
Pay
Day,
the
date
when
women&#8217;s
earnings
finally
catch
up
to
what
men
were
paid
in
the
previous
year.
For
too
long,
pay
discrimination
has
denied
women
the
income
they
deserve,
hurt
workers
and
our
economy,
and
undermined
our
nation's
values
of
equality
and
opportunity.
I
strongly
commend
President
Obama
for
marking
this
year&#8217;s
Equal
Pay
Day
by
signing
executive
measures
to
help
close
the
unacceptable
gender
pay
gap.
In
January,
55
of
my
fellow
Democratic
congresswomen
in
the
House
and
I
wrote
a
letter
to
the
president
urging
him
to
take
this
action,
which
will
increase
wage
transparency
for
federal
government
contractors.
These
important
measures
will
promote
fairness
in
the
workplace
and
make
it
harder
for
contractors
doing
business
with
our
government
to
conceal
pay
discrimination.
But
we
still
have
a
long
way
to
go
to
ensure
income
equality
for
women.
In
Pennsylvania,
women
are
paid
just
76
cents
on
average
for
every
dollar
paid
to
men,
according
to
the
National
Partnership
for
Women
and
Families.
The
wage
gap
is
even
worse
African
American
and
Hispanic
women.
In
Pennsylvania,
African
American
women
make
64
cents
and
Latino
women
earn
54
cents
for
every
dollar
paid
to
a
white,
non-Hispanic
man,
according
to
the
National
Partnership.
This
is
shameful
and
we
must
do
better.
In
Congress,
I
have
fought
for
equal
pay
for
equal
work.
I
supported
the
Lilly
Ledbetter
Fair
Pay
Act
to
reverse
a
harmful
Supreme
Court
decision
that
kept
women
from
pursuing
pay
discrimination
claims.
I
have
also
pushed
Congress
to
pass
the
Paycheck
Fairness
Act
(H.R.
377),
which
would
update
and
strengthen
the
1963
Equal
Pay
Act.
As
a
mother
and
a
grandmother,
I
will
keep
fighting
to
close
the
gender
wage
gap.
Ending
pay
disparity
will
strengthen
our
families,
our
communities
and
our
economy.
