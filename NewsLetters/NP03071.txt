Video of the Week:
Earlier this week I spoke on
the House floor about why it is so important that Congress address the
heinous crime that is human trafficking. My bill, the Trafficking
Awareness Training for Health Care Act of 2015, will train healthcare
workers to identify and recognize signs of abuse so that they can
intervene on the patients behalf
early-on.
I am thrilled to report that H.R.
398,
my bill to fight human
trafficking , passed the House this week!
This
legislationcreates a pilot program for nursing and medical schools to educate
healthcare professionals onsigns of human trafficking, which will
allow for our medical community tointercede early-on. Thiswas one of
several bipartisan bills the House passed this week in order to address
this serious crime, asitis the fastest-growing and 3rd-largest criminal
enterprise in the world. It was an honor to stand beside my colleagues
of both parties, united to address this important
issue.
On the issue of healthcare, I was pleased with
the CMS announcement this week that they will implement a 90-day
reporting period as was suggested in my bill, the Flex-IT Act. The
additional time and flexibility afforded by these modifications will help
hundreds of thousands of providers meet Stage 2 requirements in an
effective and safe manner. Learn more about this recent decision in
my full statement on the issue.
We will continue our productive work in the House next week when we
address Obamacare and other issues that impact your
life.
Thank you for the opportunity to serve you. Please contact my office in
Dunn, Asheboro or Washington if we can be of assistance to
you.
