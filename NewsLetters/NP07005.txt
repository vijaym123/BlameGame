I'm pleading
David, I wouldn&rsquo;t email you three times in 48 hours if it wasn&rsquo;t important. Speaker Boehner was in Illinois TODAY hosting a lavish fundraiser for my opponent.
We don&rsquo;t know exactly how much cash he brought in, but a report late last week said he&rsquo;s hauling as much as $1OO,OOO per event.
I don&rsquo;t mean to sound so dire, but a number like that would put my first re-election campaign in serious jeopardy. So David, I&rsquo;m pleading.
Please chip in to our campaign tonight -- before it&rsquo;s too late.
