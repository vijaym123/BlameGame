Happy Thanksgiving
I wish
you and your loved ones a Thanksgiving full of joy and laughter with
close friends and family.
Today is a day for remembering the many
blessings present in each of our lives.
On this day of thanks, I hope you will
join me in remembering those who are serving our country and are unable
to be home with their family this holiday season. Please continue to
keep them in your thoughts and prayers.
I am grateful for the opportunity to serve
you in the Second District today and everyday, and I wish each of you a
blessed Thanksgiving!
