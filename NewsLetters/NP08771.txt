announced
a new program to enroll approximately 100 lawyers and paralegals to provide legal services at taxpayer expense to youth crossing our border unaccompanied by their parents.
Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security
announced
a renewal of the Administrations policy to grant relief from deportation to youth brought into the United States illegally by their parents, if they meet certain criteria.
