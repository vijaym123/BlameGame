Friend -- I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve been getting a lot of emails.
But this email is different.
I&rsquo;ve got some incredibly exciting news that I know you&rsquo;ll want to hear:
Key Senate races are starting to break for the Democrats.
It&rsquo;s looking like Democrats can eke out a victory, but 11 races are still exceedingly close with just SEVEN days left.
That&rsquo;s why we need your help before the final end-of-month deadline hits in 72 hours.
We could still lose the Senate in just one week if you don&rsquo;t step up today.

If you think women should earn equal pay for equal work, I&rsquo;m calling on you.
If you think no one who works full time should live in poverty, I&rsquo;m calling on you.
If you think no woman&rsquo;s boss should make decisions about her birth control, I&rsquo;m calling on you.
Far too much is at stake in this election to leave the outcome up to chance. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m calling on you to step up immediately --
please pitch in to protect our Democratic Senate majority. Remember: The final end-of-month deadline is in just 72 hours.
Thank you,
Michelle Obama
