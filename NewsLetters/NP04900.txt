President Obama has been working hard to help the American people.
And Republicans? Their sole mission is sabotaging President Obama. In short, they want him to fail. And they don&rsquo;t care who gets hurt in the process.
David -- this is our last chance to give President Obama a Congress he can work with. We don&rsquo;t want to leave any votes on the table. We need 19 donors from the 60659 zip code to chip in so we can expand our get-out-the-vote operation. Will you help?
