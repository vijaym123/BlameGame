GOP Shutdown Looming for Department of Homeland
Security
The federal
agency responsible for the U.S. Border Patrol, airport security, the
Coast Guard, Customs enforcement, the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, and the Secret Service is just days from shutdown unless House
Speaker Boehner and Senate Majority Leader McConnell can break the
political impasse that threatens to shutter the Department of Homeland
Security on February 27.
The
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been running under a
stop-gap funding mechanism since October.
There are no major disputes
over what the funding numbers for the Department and its many important
programs should be; these were worked out months ago on a bipartisan
basis.
Rather,
the problem is that a small number of conservative House Republicans
have demanded that the President reverse the
Executive
Order
he issued in December regarding our nations broken
immigration system as the price for allowing the lights to stay on at the
Department of Homeland Security.
While many
including Rep. Levin
warned that doing so would put U.S. national
security at risk, on January 13 the House approved a DHS funding bill
that was loaded down with poison-pill amendments that would tie the
Presidents hands on immigration.
Weeks later, with time running
out, the Senate has refused to consider the House-passed
bill.
You may remember that in
2013, the Senate passed by a bi-partisan vote of 68 to 32 a
comprehensive immigration reform bill.
Unfortunately, Senator Boehner
refused to even allow a vote on this legislation, and House Republicans
have not been able to agree on their own approach to fixing our broken
immigration system.
Instead of shutting down a major Department,
the President has made it clear that he would welcome legislation to
address immigration for the long-term.
It is clear that the only bill that has the votes to
pass the House and Senate is a clean Department of Homeland Security
funding bill without any controversial policy riders.
Rep. Levin
and 191 other House Members have sponsored
H.R.
861 , which is a clean DHS funding bill, and the White House has
indicated that the President would sign it.
Yet Speaker Boehner has so
far refused to allow the bill to come up for a vote in the
House.
With so many terrorist
threats facing us, and especially considering the recent deadly terrorist
attacks in Paris and Copenhagen, it is time for congressional leaders
to stop playing games with national security and approve a clean
funding bill.
