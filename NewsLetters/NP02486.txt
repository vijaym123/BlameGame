Rogers Now Accepting Entries for 2015 Congressional Art Competition
SOMERSET, KY
- U.S. Rep. Harold Hal Rogers (KY-05) invites high school students in southern and eastern Kentucky to participate in the 2015 Congressional Art Competition.
Each year, the U.S. House of Representatives holds an annual art competition entitled "An Artistic Discovery" for high school students to showcase their talent and represent their congressional districts by displaying their artwork inside the U.S. Capitol for one year, where more than three million people visit annually. Thousands of high school students participate all across the country and one winner is chosen from each congressional district.
I'm always eager to see the impressive works of art that are submitted by our students in southern and eastern Kentucky for the Congressional Art Competition, said Rogers. I enjoy walking through the Cannon Tunnel where all of the winning artwork is displayed from each state, and I take great pride in showing off the talent from the Fifth District of Kentucky."
The top three district winners will be chosen from the Somerset, Prestonsburg and Hazard district offices. The winning artwork will be displayed in the United States Capitol and the winner will receive two free airline tickets to Washington, DC for an annual awards ceremony. Winners may also be eligible to receive an artistic college scholarship.
Last year,
Reagan Smith
submitted the winning artwork from Corbin High School, entitled
"#Selfie #Uncentered" . Reagan utilized watercolors to create her self-portrait. As the Fifth District winner, Reagan received a $3,000 art scholarship from the Savannah College of Art and Design, along with two free airline tickets to see her artwork displayed in Washington, D.C. Her art teacher was Brenda Daniel and Reagan is the daughter of Gwen Lickliter of Corbin, Kentucky.
