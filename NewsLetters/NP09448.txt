Dear Friend,
This week I voted in the House to give the Congressional Gold Medal to a number of military heroes.
The bills I supported, among others, include
H.R. 1726
to honor the 65th Infantry Regiment, known as the Borinqueneers;
H.R. 1209
to honor the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders; and
H.R. 685
to honor the American Fighter Aces.
As you may know, the American Fighter Aces are an elite group of combat pilots that destroyed at least five hostile aircraft in air to air combat.
Interestingly, New Jerseys Fifth District serves as the home to three of these distinguished pilots, Major Thomas Buchanan McGuire of Ridgewood, Colonel Edward Stanley Popek of Hackensack and Captain Richard Dike Faxon of Haworth.
Though we can often get caught up in the parades and barbeques, this Memorial Day I urge you to truly reflect on what we hold so dear and who we have to thank for those blessings.
We are a nation of free people because of those who never wavered in their commitment to liberty and democracy.
As President Reagan said in his first inaugural address, we must realize that no arsenal, or no weapon in the arsenals of the world, is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women.
To all the soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and coast guardsmen who paid the ultimate price for our freedom, thank you.
On this Memorial Day, may God bless the families who grieve for their loved ones, and may God bless all those who have fallen in defense of the United States of America.
Sincerely,
Scott Garrett
