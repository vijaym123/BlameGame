Blaine's Bulletin
Over the past few years, President Obama has often referred to job creation in his State of the Union Address. While his rhetoric on job-creation has been substantial, the results have been disappointing.
The administration has been quick to point out the national unemployment rate has fallen, however, most economists agree that it is misleading and heres why:
In December, for every one person who found a job, more than four stopped looking for one. Meanwhile, the Labor Force Participation Rate, which is a measure of the active portion of an economys labor force, stands at 62.8 percent, its lowest level since 1978.
Despite promises made in each of his previous four State of the Union Addresses, Americans are clearly disappointed with an economy that has meant less take-home pay and higher health care costs, both of which have caused our economy to stagnate. It is my belief that these two factors, combined with job-killing regulations and government red tape, is evidence that Washington is in the way of economic growth.
The fact of the matter is that the middle class is getting squeezed and the policies of this administration have been an abject failure. When I travel around the 3rd District each week, I hear a familiar refrain in which hard-working folks want to know: Where are the jobs?
The outright frustration of many of you is understandable and I am just as frustrated. The House has passed dozens of bills that would address economic growth and job creation but unfortunately the Senate refuses to consider any of them. In other words, the House is focusing on making it easier to find a job and break the status quo. Government should be in the business of creating conditions for job creation, not putting barriers in the way.
It is time for the president to
call on Senate leadership to pass our jobs bills and to approve the Keystone pipeline, which will create thousands of new jobs while also making us less dependent on foreign oil.
I also encourage the president to start leading on Trade Promotion Authority that will help employers and provide more employment in our country and working with the House on education and skills training to give people more opportunities in our new economy. I do remain concerned, however, by the presidents comments last week that he has a pen and a phone, which indicates that he would sooner circumvent Congress, the branch of government that serves as the voice of the people. I am hopeful that this was merely political posturing rather than an attempt to circumvent the Constitution.
With a new year comes new opportunities and I believe that we can make 2014 a year of truly bipartisan action. Within the last few weeks, we passed a bipartisan budget that cuts spending, reduces regulation and creates the groundwork for economic growth, but there is certainly more that has to be done.
I think every one of you would welcome a system of government that works to improve your quality of life instead of hindering it and I am hopeful that the president and his allies in the Senate can put away their rhetoric and instead embrace legislation that puts folks back to work and guides our economy back onto a path of economic security.
