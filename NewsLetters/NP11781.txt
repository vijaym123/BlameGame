Congressman Lamborn Questions the
Secretary of Defense
3/6/14
Today, in the House
Armed Services Committee, Congressman Doug Lamborn questioned Secretary
of Defense Chuck Hagel on America's missile defense partnership with
Israel, on companies trying to do business with both the Pentagon and
Iran, and on the general priorities of the DoD's 2015 Budget proposal.
Additionally, Congressman Lamborn has sent a letter to Secretary Hagel
highlighting just one of the companies that has participated in trade
delegations to Iran and yet has over $2 billion in DOD contracts. Some
news reports have indicated that companies currently exploring
business with Iran have over $100 billion in Defense Department
contracts.
