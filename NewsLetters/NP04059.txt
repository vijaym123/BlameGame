Chairman Palazzo Celebrates Successful Orion Launch
WASHINGTON, D.C.
Congressman Steven Palazzo (MS-4) ,
Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Space, released a statement today following the successful launch of the Orion Spacecraft:
Todays launch of the Orion Spacecraft was another victory for NASA and another momentous step for the future of space exploration.
I applaud NASA as well as their partners who aided in the process of todays successful mission including Stennis Space Center, who tested the rocket engines, and Huntington Ingalls, whose LPD retrieved the capsule.
Continued exploration is the key to returning to the moon and achieving a manned mission to Mars.
That is why I remain committed to a roadmap for NASA that provides a detailed plan and focused budget to ensure the ongoing success of our space program.
