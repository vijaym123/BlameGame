Hi David,
I know you must be getting a lot of emails, so I&rsquo;ll get straight to the point:
-- Last year, we fought hard to keep Brad Schneider&rsquo;s strong progressive voice in Congress.
-- But Republicans spent a
staggering
$10.3 MILLION to defeat him.
-- And sadly, we came up short. We didn&rsquo;t lose this race for a lack of effort.
Brad put together one of strongest grassroots campaigns in Illinois history -- and I know many of you were a part of it.
Now&rsquo;s our chance to win back this seat for Illinois Democrats. Now&rsquo;s our chance to bring back a strong progressive champion to the House of Representatives. David Johnson:
Will you chip in $5 or more ahead of Brad&rsquo;s first public fundraising deadline of the election?
$5 &gt;&gt;
$36 &gt;&gt;
$50 &gt;&gt;
$100 &gt;&gt;
$250 &gt;&gt;
Other &gt;&gt;
Brad Schneider is a relentless defender of women's rights; he&rsquo;s an unapologetic leader for the LGBT community; and his legislative vision is a direct reflection of his genuine passion for helping others. David, this is why I asked Brad Schneider to run for Congress again in 2016.
It&rsquo;s also why Speaker Boehner won&rsquo;t let this seat out of his grasp without a fight.
So I need your help. Please join me today and support Brad&rsquo;s campaign: http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/Donate-Now Let's get to work,
