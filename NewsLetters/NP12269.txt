Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
Having just wrapped up another busy two weeks in Washington, I wanted
to provide you with a quick update on some of the latest work I am
doing on behalf of Kentucky's Sixth Congressional District.
I am looking forward to continuing my Accessibility Initiative this
week as I travel across the district to meet with Kentuckians and
listen to their concerns and thoughts about the challenges our nation
faces.
I hope to see you this week!
Working to Reform the Debt Ceiling Process and Reduce Spending
It is no secret that the current debt limit law is a failure that does
nothing to actually limit spending or remove the threat of default. It
is time to stop allowing politicians to spend money today with no plan
to pay for it, now or in the future.
Last week, I voted against legislation to increase the debt limit
because it would have been unfair to young people and the next
generation to raise the debt ceiling without real reforms that restrain
spending and put our nation back on a path to a balanced budget.
At the same time, we have a responsibility to advance real solutions
that will ensure Congress is able to meet its obligations, while also
reducing spending and holding Washington accountable to the American
people.
That is why on Monday, I introduced legislation to change the way
Washington works by advancing a new, much-needed solution that will
hold politicians accountable, promote economic growth and job creation,
and restrain future spending without threatening default on past
obligations.
My bill, H.R. 4021, the Debt Limit Reform and Congressional Pay for
Performance Act of 2014, would create a new formula for establishing
the debt ceiling based on the size of the economy and annual targets
for reducing spending.
It would also hold Members of Congress accountable for spending
decisions by tying Congressional pay to meeting those spending
reduction targets.

Listening to Sixth District Veterans and Taking Recommendations to
Washington
Last week, I voted to reverse the reductions to the percentage of the
cost-of-living increases given to military retirees. This amendment
addresses the concerns that were brought to my attention by our Sixth
District Veterans Coalition regarding how the Bipartisan Budget Act I
supported would have affected their military retirement.
After the Veterans Coalition meeting on December 30, I directed the
formation of a working group made up of retired veterans who were
affected by the law change. That group examined several pieces of
proposed legislation focused on reforming the changes that were made to
the military retirement system and provided a recommendation on a
future course of action.
It is an honor to act on their recommendation and support today's
Amendment, which ensures that Veterans who are currently retired or who
joined the military before January 1, 2014 will not be subject to the
COLA changes that were contained in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013.
I remain humbled to represent the brave men and women who have fought
on behalf of our country to secure our freedoms.
If you would like to become involved with the Kentucky Sixth District
Veterans Coalition, please contact Tyler White in my Lexington District
Office at 859.219.1366.
Celebrating Black History Month
In the continuing celebration of Black History Month, we are taking a
look back through the Commonwealth's roots to honor Black figures that
have had a positive impact on our history. Today, we remember
Representative Charles W. Anderson, Jr.
Charles W. Anderson, Jr. was the first Black legislator elected in
Kentucky and in the South after the Reconstruction era. Representative
Anderson was then re-elected to the Kentucky General Assembly for five
consecutive terms. During his tenure in the House of Representatives,
Anderson successfully guided historic bills through the legislative
process and became known as a watchdog for Kentucky's Black citizens,
particularly when it came to education.
Shortly before his death in 1960, the President of the United States
named Mr. Anderson as an Alternate United States Delegate to the United
Nations General Assembly. Today, The Personnel Cabinet in the
Commonwealth of Kentucky presents an award as a perpetual memorial
(known as the Anderson Medal) to honor achievements in contribution to
the progression of social issues.

Award, click here

Kentuckians in the Capitol
Tuesday morning, I enjoyed speaking at the Manufactured Housing
Institute National Fly-In about the importance of protecting the unique
role of manufactured housing in Kentucky.
Thank you to Dr. Siddharth Kapoor, the Director of the Headache and
Pain Clinic at UK Healthcare, for stopping by the office this week!
Thanks to members of the Kentucky Rental Dealers Association for
stopping by to meet with me on Tuesday!
Around the District
Why is our economy struggling? Clark County business leaders and I
discussed the burden of our national debt and overbearing regulations
at my Business Roundtable in Winchester on Thursday.
Thanks to Clark County faith leaders for breaking bread with me at the
Cairn coffee house in Winchester. We had a great talk about Obamacare,
the farm bill, immigration and more.
What a great way to spend Valentine's Day. Friday, we celebrated Mr.
Troy Bowling and the love he provides to the Sixth District's vets. Mr.
Bowling is a WWII Veteran with more than 73,000 volunteer hours during
his 63-year career of serving Veterans at the Lexington Veterans
Affairs Medical Center, and he helped secure victory at the island of
Iwo Jima almost exactly 69 years ago.
Thank you for your service and commitment to helping Kentucky's
Veterans, Mr. Bowling
!
Even though the Cats lost to the Gators, the patients at Cardinal Hill
Rehabilitation Hospital in Lexington were the real winners last night!
The Second Annual Roundball Bash Fundraiser was a huge success with
over 600 people attending the pre-game event to raise money for the
Aquatic Center at Cardinal Hill.
I've had the pleasure of visiting Cardinal Hill several times, most
recently in November for their Legislative Forum. I am always amazed by
the staff and their incredible dedication to their patients, as well as
the inspiring Cardinal Hill patients. Special thanks goes to the
Cardinal Hill Junior Board for putting on such a nice event for a great
cause!

Committee Corner: Questioning the New Federal Reserve Chair
On Tuesday, February 11th, the new Federal Reserve Chair, Janet Yellen,
appeared before the Financial Services Committee to provide testimony
about the Fed's policies and to answer questions from Members about the
state of the economy.
My questions to the Chair Yellen focused on improving the employment
situation in our country, the impact of Obamacare on the size of the
labor force, and the long-term consequences and sustainability of our
national debt.
These factors are all taken into consideration by the Federal Reserve
when making its decisions about monetary policy. These decisions impact
nearly everything in our economy -- from the returns seniors receive on
their savings, to the rates that small businesses can obtain on loans
to grow their business, to the cost of financing the purchase of a new
car.
These questions were particularly relevant in light of the
Congressional Budget Office report released last week projecting that
Obamacare will reduce the labor force by 2.5 million workers over the
next decade, approximately three times the number originally projected.
I appreciated Chair Yellen's testimony, and I congratulate her on her
appointment.

On Wednesday, I spoke with News Talk 590 WVLK-AM's Lee Cruse
about my new debt limit bill and my opportunity to question
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen.
I was glad to join News Talk 590 WVLK-AM's Jack Pattie
Thursday morning to take calls from constituents
during the 9:00 AM hour! I always appreciate hearing from constituents
and was glad to answer questions covering a large array of topics
important to the people of the Sixth District! If you didn't catch it
live, you can listen to it by clicking here

I also enjoyed speaking with Tim Smith with Gateway Radio Works, Inc.
(which includes stations WKCA-FM/WIVY-FM/WMST AM-FM/WKYN-FM) about my
debt limit reform bill, H.R. 4021, and the importance of promoting
policies that will help Kentuckians move up the economic ladder and
make it easier for businesses to expand and create good paying jobs. If

Dear
Friend,
Having

on

of

this
week
as
I
travel
across
the
district
to
meet
with
Kentuckians
and
listen
to
their
concerns
and
thoughts
about
the
challenges
our
nation
faces.
I
hope
to
see
you
this
week!
Working

Last

At

Congress

That

on

I
introduced

works
by
advancing

My
bill,
H.R.
4021,
the
Debt

Congressional
Pay

reduction
targets.

Listening
to
Sixth
District
Veterans
and
Taking
Recommendations
to
Washington
Last
week,
I
voted
to
reverse
the
reductions
to
the
percentage
of
the
cost-of-living
increases
given
to
military
retirees.
This
amendment
addresses
the
concerns
that
were
brought
to
my
attention
by
our
Sixth
District
Veterans
Coalition
regarding
how
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act
I
supported
would
have
affected
their
military
retirement.
After
the
Veterans
Coalition
meeting
on
December
30,
I
directed
the
formation
of
a
working
group
made
up
of
retired
veterans
who
were
affected
by
the
law
change.
That
group
examined
several
pieces
of
proposed
legislation
focused
on
reforming
the
changes
that
were
made
to
the
military
retirement
system
and
provided
a
recommendation
on
a
future
course
of
action.
It
is
an
honor
to
act
on
their
recommendation
and
support
today&#8217;s
Amendment,
which
ensures
that
Veterans
who
are
currently
retired
or
who
joined
the
military
before
January
1,
2014
will
not
be
subject
to
the
COLA
changes
that
were
contained
in
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act
of
2013.
I
remain
humbled
to
represent
the
brave
men
and
women
who
have
fought
on
behalf
of
our
country
to
secure
our
freedoms.

Celebrating
Black

In
the
continuing
celebration
of
Black
History
Month,
we
are
taking
a
look
back
through
the
Commonwealth&#8217;s
roots
to
honor
Black

that
have

on
our

Today,
we

Charles
W.
Anderson,

was
the
first
Black
legislator
elected
in
Kentucky
and
in
the
South
after
the
Reconstruction
era.
Representative
Anderson
was
then
re-elected
to
the
Kentucky
General

for
five
consecutive
terms.
During
his
tenure
in
the
House
of

Anderson
successfully
guided

through
the
legislative
process
and
became
known
as
a

Shortly
before

Mr.

Today,
The

Committee
Corner:
Questioning
the
New
Federal
Reserve
Chair
On
Tuesday,
February
11th,
the
new
Federal
Reserve
Chair,
Janet
Yellen,
appeared
before
the
Financial
Services
Committee
to
provide
testimony
about
the
Fed's
policies
and
to
answer
questions
from
Members
about
the
state
of
the
economy.
My
questions
to
the
Chair
Yellen
focused
on
improving
the
employment
situation
in
our
country,
the
impact
of
Obamacare
on
the
size
of
the
labor
force,
and
the
long-term
consequences
and
sustainability
of
our
national
debt.
These
factors
are
all
taken
into
consideration
by
the
Federal
Reserve
when
making
its
decisions
about
monetary
policy.
These
decisions
impact
nearly
everything
in
our
economy
--
from
the
returns
seniors
receive
on
their
savings,
to
the
rates
that
small
businesses
can
obtain
on
loans
to
grow
their
business,
to
the
cost
of
financing
the
purchase
of
a
new
car.
These
questions
were
particularly
relevant
in
light
of
the
Congressional
Budget
Office
report
released
last
week
projecting
that
Obamacare
will
reduce
the
labor
force
by
2.5
million
workers
over
the
next
decade,
approximately
three
times
the
number
originally
projected.
I
appreciated
Chair
Yellen's
testimony,
and
I
congratulate
her
on
her
appointment.

the
