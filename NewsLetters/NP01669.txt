Friend
Currently, there are laws forbidding individuals from receiving Social Security payments if they are here illegally. However, their entire work history
even work done as an illegal immigrant
can still count towards Social Security benefits if the individual later becomes a legal U.S. resident.
In my opinion, that makes no sense. Thats why Im championing the No Social Security for Illegal Immigrants Act ( H.R. 1716 ) to stop unauthorized work from counting towards Social Security credits. I will keep you updated on its progress as it moves through the House in the 114th Congress.
Yours in service,
Randy
