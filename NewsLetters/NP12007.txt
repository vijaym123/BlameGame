VISITING DC
February 28, 2014
This week, the Senate focused on the Veterans
Omnibus, offered by Senator Sanders, which would create at least 15 new
programs at VA while doing nothing to fix the vast problems that exist in
current programs.
Senator Sanders legislation failed during a
procedural vote to raise the spending caps set in the Murray-Ryan
Budget.
I do support many pieces of the Sanders bill.
Those pieces were included in my alternative, which was introduced Tuesday
evening.
Those areas of agreement reflect legislation already
approved by the Veterans Affairs Committee on a bipartisan basis.
Unfortunately, Senator Reid decided playing political games and
blocking amendments was more important than providing real support and help
to our nations heroes, and real reforms to the federal department
that serves them.
My chief concern with the Sanders bill was
its expansion of the VA health care system to veterans who dont have
a service-connected disability, the so-called "Priority 8" veterans.
Simply put, the bill did not provide the resources necessary to
make sure the expansion didn't result in more frustrations and longer
delays for veterans already in the VA system.
For example, the
current wait time for processing veterans disability benefit claims is
376 days, with more than 34,000 veterans currently waiting for a year
or more.
On top of these long wait times, GAO analysts
found more than half of the VAs 50,000 schedulers did not know how to
accurately report the information needed to determine wait times and
others admitted to changing the desired date so the time aligned with VAs
established goal of 14 days. We have heard multiple reports of VA
offices shredding documents so their numbers come in at
threshold.
Veterans waiting for their disability claims to be processed know
all about frustrations and delays at the VA.
Adding more
individuals to an already broken system doesnt seem wise. Instead of
pursuing an expansion of the VA bureaucracy, a serious effort should be made
to fix the VA, something that I look forward to working on with
Chairman Sanders.
Legislation to address needed fixes, such as my own
effort to restructure the Veterans Integrated Service Network system,
which oversees operations of veterans health facilities, is before
the committee -- it just needs action by the committee's
leadership.

On Thursday evening, I sent a letter to Secretary Hagel, along with
19 other Senators and 24 House members, regarding the recent and
abrupt change to TRICAREs reimbursement policy. Starting January 1, 2013
the militarys insurance stopped paying for hundreds of different
medical tests, including common screenings for cancer, cystic fibrosis,
fragile X syndrome and spinal muscular atrophy. No notices were given to
either beneficiaries or providers, and doctors continued to order the
tests, while major laboratories shouldered the costs in hopes that
the Defense Department would reverse the policy.
Members of
the military and their families should have the same access to health
care as other government employees and civilians in the private sector
and not be penalized for receiving care at a private facility. In the
letter, we ask Secretary Hagel to answer a series of questions
regarding this change with a prompt response given by March
14 th
at the latest. You can read more about this issue and access the
text of letter
here .
The Senate is
expected to turn next week to legislation I helped craft with Senator
Barbara Mikulski, addressing Child Care and Development Block Grants.
I hope you will follow this important debate as it
unfolds.
Sincerely,
Richard Burr
