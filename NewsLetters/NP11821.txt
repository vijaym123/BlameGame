February 28th, 2014
Dear Friend,
This week, I spoke with FOX News Channel's Bill O'Reilly about my bill
to help bring sanity to our nation's marijuana policy, hosted a
telephone town hall with nearly 4,000 Ninth District citizens, and
helped break ground at the Hampline. Keep reading to find out what else
happened this week.

Listening to Memphis
On Tuesday night, I hosted a telephone town hall meeting to answer
questions about the issues facing our nation and our city. Telephone
town halls give Memphians another way to speak directly to me and give
me a chance to hear what's really on the minds of citizens of the Ninth
District.
During this week's telephone town hall, I discussed with nearly 4,000
Memphians the importance of keeping college affordable and fully
funding HOPE Scholarships, what citizens can do to protect themselves
and their families from the racial disparity in breast cancer outcomes,
and how they can enroll for health insurance under the Affordable Care
Act before the March 31st enrollment deadline, and several other issues.
Whether working to grow our economy and create jobs or fighting to
protect the voting rights of all Americans, the opinions and ideas of
Ninth District constituents help us move forward with legislation in
Congress.
Making It Easier to Bike in Memphis
On Monday, I was pleased to be in Memphis helping break ground at the
Hampline, which will make our city more livable and sustainable and
give Memphians more opportunities to explore the city on foot or bike.
As you may know, Memphis was recently named America's Most Improved
Bike City by Bicycling Magazine, and projects like the Hampline-
spearheaded by Mayor A C Wharton-will help the city take another step
towards being one of the nation's best cities for cyclists. That helps
attract young, successful people to our city and brings in investment
and jobs that we need. I will continue fighting for more federal
funding for projects like these to make Memphis healthier, improve our
infrastructure, and improve our economy.
Fighting for a Sane Marijuana Policy
Nobody dies from marijuana, but people die from heroin overdoses every
day. Every second that we spend trying to enforce marijuana possession
laws is a moment that we're not enforcing laws meant to protect
Americans from the ravages of drugs like heroin and methamphetamine.
That's where our priority should be. When we put marijuana on the same
level as LSD, crack, heroin, meth, and cocaine-as the federal
government has-it makes young people distrust what they are being told
about hard drugs because they know that what they are being told about
marijuana is wrong. Not only that, but African Americans are 4 times
more likely than Caucasians to be arrested for marijuana. That isn't
right. There is a cultural lag in this country, and Congress and this
Administration must fix it.
One of the reasons for our current policy is that the Office of
National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), commonly referred to as our "Drug
Czar," is required by law to oppose changing the legal status of
marijuana, even though it has been proven to have medical benefits. The
ONDCP is also prohibited by law from studying whether or not there
could be any benefits. That troubles me, because the ONDCP's job should
be to develop and recommend sane drug control policies, not be
handcuffed or muzzled from telling the American people the truth.
How can we trust what the Drug Czar says if the law already preordains
the ONDCP's position? That's why I introduced my "Unmuzzle the Drug
Czar Act" to remove those restrictions and give the ONDCP the freedom
to recommend more sane drug policies for our nation. My bill would give
the ONDCP the freedom to use science rather than ideology in its
recommendations and give the American people a reason to trust what
they are told. I had a spirited discussion with FOX News Channel's Bill
O'Reilly about why we should pass my bill. You can watch my interview
here
.
I am also a co-signer with several other Members of Congress on a
letter to President Obama encouraging the reclassification of marijuana
from Schedule I on our nation's controlled substances "schedule," as it
is currently listed, to a less strict classification. This is a higher
listing than cocaine and methamphetamine. If a drug is listed under
Schedule I, it means that the federal government recognizes no medical
use. Including marijuana in this classification disregards both
scientific medical evidence and the laws of nearly half of the states
that have legalized it for medical purposes. This morning, I discussed
the scheduling of marijuana at a meeting of the House Judiciary
Committee Over-Criminalization Task Force. You can watch the
conversation here
.
Preventing Abuse of Horses
This week, I joined my friend Priscilla Presley and my colleague
Congressman Ed Whitfield to discuss efforts to protect all horses from
the abusive training method called "soring." Horse trainers often go to
great lengths to avoid detection rather than comply with current
federal law and train horses using humane methods. That is why
Congressman Whitfield and I introduced the Prevent All Soring Tactics
(PAST) Act would help stop these practices, and it wouldn't increase
the deficit by a penny. I am glad that Ms. Presley has joined us in
support of the legislation.
Building Ladders of Opportunity for Boys and Young Men of Color
Yesterday at the White House, President Obama launched his "My Brother's
Keeper
" initiative to help build ladders of opportunity for young men
and boys of color. Young men and boys of color are six times more
likely than their Caucasian peers to be murdered, and by 4thgrade more
than 80% of them are likely to be behind in reading proficiency. The
President's collaborative initiative with leading foundations and
businesses seeks to address this disparity and unlock the full
potential of these young people. I applaud President Obama's attention
to this problem and his work with major stakeholders to address it. I
hope to work with him to ensure that all young Memphians have an equal
chance at success in life.
Building a Healthier Memphis
Among the many benefits of the Affordable Care Act is free preventive
care for services like mammograms that can detect breast cancer. A New
York Times story
noted that Memphis is "the deadliest major
American city for African-American women with breast cancer."
The racial disparity in breast cancer outcomes is deplorable, but we
can take steps to reduce it. A primary reason for the high mortality
rate among African American women is late diagnosis, when the disease
is harder to treat and has much lower survival rates. That's why I
launched my "Building a Healthier Memphis" series on wellness in the
Ninth District by hosting an expert panel discussion and education
session about this disparity and what we can do to address it and
improve outcomes for victims of breast cancer in our city. I'm
encouraged by all of the Memphians who attended the event to learn how
they can help improve their own health and the health of their families
and communities, and I look forward to hosting the next "Building a
Healthier Memphis" event at Church Health Center Wellness on the
morning of Saturday, April 19th.
Everyone in the Ninth District should know that provisions of the
President's Affordable Care Act enable them to get mammograms with no
co-pays or deductibles. Taking advantage of the Affordable Care Act
could help save lives in our city and around the country. And don't
forget that the open season deadline to enroll in health coverage for
this year at HealthCare.gov
is March 31st.
Fully Funding the HOPE Scholarships
Over the last 10 years, the HOPE Scholarship program that I worked for
20 years as a State Senator to create has been an outstanding success
that has provided $2.9 billion to Tennessee's best and brightest. And
while this funding has been critical to helping students attend college
and complete 4-year degrees, the HOPE Scholarship has never fully
funded college scholarships, as intended, because state lawmakers have
not allowed it to keep up with the skyrocketing cost of higher
education.
Today's HOPE Scholarships pay a smaller portion of college costs than
it did 10 years ago and, if Governor Haslam's newly-announced plan to
slash the first two years of HOPE Scholarships by 25% is implemented,
it will provide even smaller scholarships for freshmen and sophomores.
The first two years of college are crucial for students finding their
way. With scholarships paying a smaller portion of tuition, families
will have to pay more and students may need to work more hours while
juggling their scholastic responsibilities, making academic success and
retention of the HOPE Scholarship more difficult. Today's college
students are graduating with more student loan debt than ever before,
crippling their chances of economic success.
To ensure that HOPE Scholarships continue to help Tennessee's students
afford college and succeed, the program must keep pace with the rising
cost of higher education. But the Governor's newly-announced "Tennessee
Promise" actually cuts funding from high-achieving students beginning
4-year degree programs. I am extremely concerned and remain cautious
about any plan that would make it harder for our state's proven young
people to begin attending the best universities in Tennessee, or any
plan that places additional financial burden on schools like the
University of Memphis which are already struggling to keep costs down
and provide high-quality educations.
Rather than raiding the scholarship fund's excess to create a new
government program, those funds should be used to provide full HOPE
scholarships. Tennesseans voted to repeal our state's constitutional
prohibition on lotteries based on the idea of replicating the success
of Georgia's successful HOPE program which provides full college
scholarships. That promise to the people moves farther from being
realized with every new idea to siphon money from the scholarship
program. Once scholarships are fully funded, the excess funds would be
better used, as I personally expressed last year to Governor Haslam, by
raising the income cap on or raising the amount of Aspire Awards that
give middle- and low-income students who work hard extra help to give
them a fair shot at success.
Ensuring Memphians Get the Tax Returns They Deserve
The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is too important for people to
overlook, and everyone who is eligible should claim it when filing
their taxes. But historically, eligible taxpayers in Memphis and Shelby
County have not taken full advantage of the program-last year alone, as
much as $70 million in potential tax credits were left on the table by
area taxpayers.
Memphians shouldn't pay more than they owe, and they should receive
every penny they deserve in refunds. That's why I attended the grand
opening of one of 15 new Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) sites
that recently opened throughout Shelby County to provide guidance and
advice free of charge to ensure that eligible Shelby County citizens
take advantage of programs like the EITC and get the tax refund they
are entitled to. Click here
to find a VITA site near you to help ensure you get every penny
you are owed.
Recognizing the Monuments Men
This week, I enjoyed seeing Monuments Men-a movie that is based on a
true story. In 2007, I voted for the first Congressional bill to
recognize the work that the real-life Monuments Men did during World
War II to protect and preserve important art and culture. I also met
author Robert Edsel as well as a surviving Monuments Man Harry
Ettlinger. Their work during World War II deserves a Congressional Gold
Medal, and I am joining my colleague Congresswoman Kay Granger to see
that they receive it.
Helping Memphians Get Covered
All Memphians should have quality health insurance and the President's
landmark Affordable Care Act is making affordable, higher-quality
coverage available to people who have not had access to it in the past.
Luckily, many who have been unable to afford quality coverage in the
past are now eligible to enroll in Tennessee's Health Insurance
Marketplace
. Please don't forget that the open season
deadline to enroll in health coverage for this year at HealthCare.gov
is March 31st. And if you do not have health insurance coverage,
you may also be eligible to save money on your health care premiums
in the Marketplace.
If you are on Medicare or your employer is offering qualified health
insurance that you are enrolled in, you're already covered and won't
need to enter the Marketplace for your health coverage. If you aren't
sure whether or not you should use the Marketplace to get insurance,
call the Marketplace Hotline at 1 (800) 318-2596, visit
www.HealthCare.gov
, or call Tennessee's navigator, Seedco, at (901) 528-8341.
You can also call my office at (901) 544-4131 or the Marketplace
Hotline to find out if TennCare (Tennessee's Medicaid program) is a
coverage option for you. If you are one of the millions of Americans
who need health insurance, you can sign up
for coverage for 2014 until the open
enrollment period closes on March 31st, 2014. Visit www.healthcare.gov
today to look at your options.
The Affordable Care Act is already working for families across the
Ninth District. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, 147,000 individuals in the district now have health insurance
that covers preventive services without co-pays, $3.1 million in
insurance premiums have been returned to consumers, and more than 5,000
seniors on Medicare paid a total of $5.9 million less for their
prescription medications as we continue to close the 'donut hole.'
Also, health insurance companies can no longer discriminate against
patients with pre-existing conditions and young adults up to age 26 can
now stay on their parents' insurance plan.
Many of the Marketplace website issues that have been in the news have
been resolved. However, the Marketplace website is only one tool that
you can use to sign up for coverage. If you are having trouble
accessing the website, please do not hesitate to call the Marketplace
Hotline at 1 (800) 318-2596 or visit the Affordable Care Act Navigators
at Seedco's Mid-South office at 22 North Front Street (Suite 900) for
in-person help. Seedco can also be reached by phone at (901) 528-8341,
and if you have any other questions, you should feel free to call my
office at (901) 544-4131.
VA Rolls Out Secure Veteran Health ID Cards
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) recently announced the phased
roll out of newly designed, more secure Veteran Health Identification
Cards. The new cards are distinguished by additional security features
and will have a different look and feel. In addition to being more
secure, the card has been transformed into a Veterans Health
Identification Card (VHIC).
Similar to a typical health insurance card, the VHIC displays the
veteran's Member ID, a new unique identifier, as well as a Plan ID,
reflecting the veteran's enrollment in VA health care. The card
replaces the Veteran Identification Card (VIC), which was introduced in
2004. As part of a phased rollout, the card will only be offered to
newly enrolled and other veterans who have not been issued a VIC. In
early April, the VA will begin a three month effort to automatically
issue the more secure VHIC to current VIC cardholders. The VA
recommends veterans safeguard their VIC as they would a credit card,
and cut up or shred the card once it is replaced. While not required to
receive VA health care, all enrolled Veterans are encouraged to get a
VHIC.
Enrolled veterans can get more information about the VHIC by visiting
their VA medical facility enrollment coordinator or the website
www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhic
, calling 1-877-222-VETS (8387) or visiting their
local VA health care facility. Veterans who are not enrolled in the VA
health care system can apply for enrollment at any time by visiting
www.va.gov/healthbenefits/enroll
, calling 1-877-222-VETS (8387) or visiting
their local VA health care facility.
Helping St. Jude
This week, I announced nearly $400,000 in federal grant funds to St.
Jude Children's Research Hospital to aid in important work related to
many autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. The funding will be used
to continue important research at St. Jude, which is the world's
leading children's cancer research hospitals and one of the finest
health care institutions on the planet.
United States Naval Academy Summer Programs
Each year, the United States Naval Academy invites more than 3,000
students to Annapolis, Maryland, to participate in its summer programs.
The Academy's summer STEM program, which is now accepting applications
here
, gives rising 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th graders the opportunity
to learn from some of the best college professors in the country and
work in world-class lab facilities. The Academy's Summer Seminars gives
rising 12th graders the opportunity to find out if they have what it
takes to be midshipmen by allowing them to experience the rigorous
academics, physical challenges, and student life at the Naval Academy.
More information about the Summer Seminar and how to apply is available
here
.
Helping Veterans Become Homeowners
Last year, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs helped a record
number of veterans obtain mortgage loans and become homeowners
. In guaranteeing nearly 630,000 home loans, the VA's Loan
Guarantee program helped more veterans become homeowners or move to a
new home than at any point in its 70-year history. Not only is this
great news for veterans, but it also is another sign that our housing
market is rebounding-and that is good news for everyone. The VA Loan
Guarantee program has some of the lowest foreclosure rates around and,
along with offering low interest rates, their loans do not require a
down payment from first-time buyers. If you are a veteran looking to
purchase a home, you can learn more about the program here
.
Grant Announcements
I regularly release a list of grant announcements from federal agencies
like the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, and others. These
federal funding opportunities are available to faith-based and
neighborhood associations, nonprofits and other community organizations
in the Ninth District. The announcements are updated regularly on my
website
.
As always, I remain.

I

meeting
to
answer
questions
about
the
issues
facing
our

and
our

I
discussed
with
nearly
4,000
Memphians
the
importance
of
keeping

fully
funding
HOPE
Scholarships,
what
citizens
can
do
to
protect
themselves
and

of

constituents
help
us
move

in
Congress.
Making
It
Easier
to
Bike
in
Memphis
On
Monday,
I
was
pleased
to
be
in
Memphis
helping
break
ground
at
the
Hampline,
which
will
make
our
city
more
livable
and
sustainable
and
give
Memphians
more
opportunities
to
explore
the
city
on
foot
or
bike.
As
you
may
know,
Memphis
was
recently
named
America&#8217;s
Most
Improved
Bike
City
by
Bicycling
Magazine,
and
projects
like
the
Hampline&#8212;spearheaded
by
Mayor
A
C
Wharton&#8212;will
help
the
city
take
another
step
towards
being
one
of
the
nation&#8217;s
best
cities
for
cyclists.
That
helps
attract
young,
successful
people
to
our
city
and
brings
in
investment
and
jobs
that
we
need.
I
will
continue
fighting
for
more
federal
funding
for
projects
like
these
to
make
Memphis
healthier,
improve
our
infrastructure,
and
improve
our
economy.
Fighting
for
a
Sane
Marijuana
Policy
Nobody
dies
from
marijuana,
but
people
die
from
heroin
overdoses
every
day.
Every
second
that
we
spend
trying
to
enforce
marijuana
possession
laws
is
a
moment
that
we&#8217;re
not
enforcing
laws
meant
to
protect
Americans
from
the
ravages
of
drugs
like
heroin
and
methamphetamine.
That&#8217;s
where
our
priority
should
be.
When
we
put
marijuana
on
the
same
level
as
LSD,
crack,
heroin,
meth,
and
cocaine&#8212;as
the
federal
government
has&#8212;it
makes
young
people
distrust
what
they
are
being
told
about
hard
drugs
because
they
know
that
what
they
are
being
told
about
marijuana
is
wrong.
Not
only
that,
but
African
Americans
are
4
times
more
likely
than
Caucasians
to
be
arrested
for
marijuana.
That
isn&#8217;t
right.
There
is
a
cultural
lag
in
this
country,
and
Congress
and
this
Administration
must
fix
it.
One
of
the
reasons
for
our
current
policy
is
that
the
Office
of
National
Drug
Control
Policy
(ONDCP),
commonly
referred
to
as
our
&#8220;Drug
Czar,&#8221;
is
required
by
law
to
oppose
changing
the
legal
status
of
marijuana,
even
though
it
has
been
proven
to
have
medical
benefits.
The
ONDCP
is
also
prohibited
by
law
from
studying
whether
or
not
there
could
be
any
benefits.
That
troubles
me,
because
the
ONDCP&#8217;s
job
should
be
to
develop
and
recommend
sane
drug
control
policies,
not
be
handcuffed
or
muzzled
from
telling
the
American
people
the
truth.
How
can
we
trust
what
the
Drug
Czar
says
if
the
law
already
preordains
the
ONDCP&#8217;s
position?
That&#8217;s
why
I
introduced
my
&#8220;Unmuzzle
the
Drug
Czar
Act&#8221;
to
remove
those
restrictions
and
give
the
ONDCP
the
freedom
to
recommend
more
sane
drug
policies
for
our
nation.
My
bill
would
give
the
ONDCP
the
freedom
to
use
science
rather
than
ideology
in
its
recommendations
and
give
the
American
people
a
reason
to
trust
what
they
are
told.
I
had
a
spirited
discussion
with
FOX
News
Channel&#8217;s
Bill
O&#8217;Reilly
about
why
we
should
pass
my
bill.
You
can
watch
my
interview
here .
I
am
also
a
co-signer
with
several
other
Members
of
Congress
on
a
letter
to
President
Obama
encouraging
the
reclassification
of
marijuana
from
Schedule
I
on
our
nation&#8217;s
controlled
substances
&#8220;schedule,&#8221;
as
it
is
currently
listed,
to
a
less
strict
classification.
This
is
a
higher
listing
than
cocaine
and
methamphetamine.
If
a
drug
is
listed
under
Schedule
I,
it
means
that
the
federal
government
recognizes
no
medical
use.
Including
marijuana
in
this
classification
disregards
both
scientific
medical
evidence
and
the
laws
of
nearly
half
of
the
states
that
have
legalized
it
for
medical
purposes.
This
morning,
I
discussed
the
scheduling
of
marijuana
at
a
meeting
of
the
House
Judiciary
Committee
Over-Criminalization
Task
Force.
You
can

the
conversation

Preventing
Abuse
of
Horses
This
week,
I
joined
my
friend
Priscilla
Presley
and
my
colleague
Congressman
Ed
Whitfield
to
discuss
efforts
to
protect
all
horses
from
the
abusive
training
method
called
&#8220;soring.&#8221;
Horse
trainers
often
go
to
great
lengths
to
avoid
detection
rather
than
comply
with
current
federal
law
and
train
horses
using
humane
methods.
That
is
why
Congressman
Whitfield
and
I
introduced
the
Prevent
All
Soring
Tactics
(PAST)
Act
would
help
stop
these
practices,
and
it
wouldn&#8217;t
increase
the
deficit
by
a
penny.
I
am
glad
that
Ms.
Presley
has
joined
us
in
support
of
the
legislation.
Building
Ladders
of
Opportunity
for
Boys
and
Young
Men
of
Color
Yesterday
at
the
White
House,
President
Obama
launched
his
&#8220; My
Brother&#8217;s
Keeper &#8221;
initiative
to
help
build
ladders
of
opportunity
for
young
men
and
boys
of
color.
Young
men
and
boys
of
color
are
six
times
more
likely
than
their
Caucasian
peers
to
be
murdered,
and
by
4 th grade
more
than
80%
of
them
are
likely
to
be
behind
in
reading
proficiency.
The
President&#8217;s
collaborative
initiative
with
leading
foundations
and
businesses
seeks
to
address
this
disparity
and
unlock
the
full
potential
of
these
young
people.
I
applaud
President
Obama&#8217;s
attention
to
this
problem
and
his
work
with
major
stakeholders
to
address
it.
I
hope
to
work
with
him
to
ensure
that
all
young
Memphians
have
an
equal
chance
at
success
in
life.
Building
a
Healthier
Memphis
Among
the
many
benefits
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act
is
free
preventive
care
for
services
like
mammograms
that
can
detect
breast
cancer.
A
New
York
Times
story
noted
that
Memphis
is
&#8220;the
deadliest
major
American
city
for
African-American
women
with
breast
cancer.&#8221;
The
racial
disparity
in
breast
cancer
outcomes
is
deplorable,
but
we
can
take
steps
to
reduce
it.
A
primary
reason
for the
high
mortality
rate
among
African
American
women
is
late
diagnosis,
when
the
disease
is
harder
to
treat
and
has
much
lower
survival
rates.
That&#8217;s
why
I
launched
my
&#8220;Building
a
Healthier
Memphis&#8221;
series
on
wellness
in
the
Ninth
District
by
hosting
an
expert
panel
discussion
and
education
session
about
this
disparity
and
what
we
can
do
to
address
it
and
improve
outcomes
for
victims
of
breast
cancer
in
our
city. I&#8217;m
encouraged
by
all
of
the
Memphians
who
attended
the
event
to
learn
how
they
can
help
improve
their
own
health
and
the
health
of
their
families
and
communities,
and
I
look
forward
to
hosting
the
next
&#8220;Building
a
Healthier
Memphis&#8221;
event
at
Church
Health
Center
Wellness
on
the
morning
of
Saturday,
April
19th.
Everyone
in
the
Ninth
District
should
know
that
provisions
of
the
President&#8217;s
Affordable
Care
Act
enable
them
to
get
mammograms
with
no
co-pays
or
deductibles.
Taking
advantage
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act
could
help
save
lives
in
our
city
and
around
the
country.
And
don&#8217;t
forget
that
the
open
season
deadline
to
enroll
in
health
coverage
for
this
year
at
HealthCare.gov
is
March
31st.
Fully
Funding
the
HOPE
Scholarships
Over
the
last
10
years,
the
HOPE
Scholarship
program
that
I
worked
for
20
years
as
a
State
Senator
to
create
has
been
an
outstanding
success
that
has
provided
$2.9
billion
to
Tennessee&#8217;s
best
and
brightest.
And
while
this
funding
has
been
critical
to
helping
students
attend
college
and
complete
4-year
degrees,
the
HOPE
Scholarship
has
never
fully
funded
college
scholarships,
as
intended,
because
state
lawmakers
have
not
allowed
it
to
keep
up
with
the
skyrocketing
cost
of
higher
education.
Today&#8217;s
HOPE
Scholarships
pay
a
smaller
portion
of
college
costs
than
it
did
10
years
ago
and,
if
Governor
Haslam&#8217;s
newly-announced
plan
to
slash
the
first
two
years
of
HOPE
Scholarships
by
25%
is
implemented,
it
will
provide
even
smaller
scholarships
for
freshmen
and
sophomores.
The
first
two
years
of
college
are
crucial
for
students
finding
their
way.
With
scholarships
paying
a
smaller
portion
of
tuition,
families
will
have
to
pay
more
and
students
may
need
to
work
more
hours
while
juggling
their
scholastic
responsibilities,
making
academic
success
and
retention
of
the
HOPE
Scholarship
more
difficult. Today&#8217;s
college
students
are
graduating
with
more
student
loan
debt
than
ever
before,
crippling
their
chances
of
economic
success.
To
ensure
that
HOPE
Scholarships
continue
to
help
Tennessee&#8217;s
students
afford
college
and
succeed,
the
program
must
keep
pace
with
the
rising
cost
of
higher
education.
But
the
Governor&#8217;s
newly-announced
&#8220;Tennessee
Promise&#8221;
actually
cuts
funding
from
high-achieving
students
beginning
4-year
degree
programs.
I
am
extremely
concerned
and
remain
cautious
about
any
plan
that
would
make
it
harder
for
our
state&#8217;s
proven
young
people
to
begin
attending
the
best
universities
in
Tennessee,
or
any
plan
that
places
additional
financial
burden
on
schools
like
the
University
of
Memphis
which
are
already
struggling
to
keep
costs
down
and
provide
high-quality
educations.
Rather
than
raiding
the
scholarship
fund&#8217;s
excess
to
create
a
new
government
program,
those
funds
should
be
used
to
provide
full
HOPE
scholarships.
Tennesseans
voted
to
repeal
our
state&#8217;s
constitutional
prohibition
on
lotteries
based
on
the
idea
of
replicating
the
success
of
Georgia&#8217;s
successful
HOPE
program
which
provides
full
college
scholarships.
That
promise
to
the
people
moves
farther
from
being
realized
with
every
new
idea
to
siphon
money
from
the
scholarship
program.
Once
scholarships
are
fully
funded,
the
excess
funds
would
be
better
used,
as
I
personally
expressed
last
year
to
Governor
Haslam,
by
raising
the
income
cap
on
or
raising
the
amount
of
Aspire
Awards
that
give
middle-
and
low-income
students
who
work
hard
extra
help
to
give
them
a
fair
shot
at
success.
Ensuring
Memphians
Get
the
Tax
Returns
They
Deserve
The
Earned
Income
Tax
Credit
(EITC)
is
too
important
for
people
to
overlook,
and
everyone
who
is
eligible
should
claim
it
when
filing
their
taxes.
But
historically,
eligible
taxpayers
in
Memphis
and
Shelby
County
have
not
taken
full
advantage
of
the
program&#8212;last
year
alone,
as
much
as
$70
million
in
potential
tax
credits
were
left
on
the
table
by
area
taxpayers.
Memphians
shouldn&#8217;t
pay
more
than
they
owe,
and
they
should
receive
every
penny
they
deserve
in
refunds.
That&#8217;s
why
I
attended
the
grand
opening
of
one
of
15
new
Volunteer
Income
Tax
Assistance
(VITA)
sites
that
recently
opened
throughout
Shelby
County
to
provide
guidance
and
advice
free
of
charge
to
ensure
that
eligible
Shelby
County
citizens
take
advantage
of
programs
like
the
EITC
and
get
the
tax
refund
they
are
entitled
to.
Click

to
find
a
VITA
site
near
you
to
help
ensure
you
get
every
penny
you
are
owed.
Recognizing
the
Monuments
Men
This
week,
I
enjoyed
seeing
Monuments
Men&#8212;a
movie
that
is
based
on
a
true
story.
In
2007,
I
voted
for
the
first
Congressional
bill
to
recognize
the
work
that
the
real-life
Monuments
Men
did
during
World
War
II
to
protect
and
preserve
important
art
and
culture.
I
also
met
author
Robert
Edsel
as
well
as
a
surviving
Monuments
Man
Harry
Ettlinger.
Their
work
during
World
War
II
deserves
a
Congressional
Gold
Medal,
and
I
am
joining
my
colleague
Congresswoman
Kay
Granger
to
see
that
they
receive
it.
Helping
Memphians
Get
Covered
All
Memphians
should
have
quality
health
insurance
and
the
President&#8217;s
landmark
Affordable
Care
Act
is
making
affordable,
higher-quality
coverage
available
to
people
who
have
not
had
access
to
it
in
the
past.
Luckily,
many
who
have
been
unable
to
afford
quality
coverage
in
the
past
are
now
eligible
to
enroll
in
Tennessee&#8217;s
Health
Insurance
Marketplace .
Please
don&#8217;t
forget
that
the
open
season
deadline
to
enroll
in
health
coverage
for
this
year
at
HealthCare.gov
is
March
31st.
And
if
you
do
not
have
health
insurance
coverage,
you
may
also
be
eligible
to
save
money
on
your
health
care
premiums
in
the
Marketplace.
If
you
are
on
Medicare
or
your
employer
is
offering
qualified
health
insurance
that
you
are
enrolled
in,
you&#8217;re
already
covered
and
won&#8217;t
need
to
enter
the
Marketplace
for
your
health
coverage.
If
you
aren&#8217;t
sure
whether
or
not
you
should
use
the
Marketplace
to
get
insurance,

or

Marketplace
Hotline
to
find
out
if
TennCare
(Tennessee&#8217;s
Medicaid
program)
is
a
coverage
option
for
you.
If
you
are
one
of
the
millions
of
Americans
who
need
health
insurance,
you
can
sign
up
for
coverage
for
2014
until
the
open
enrollment
period
closes
on
March
31st,
2014.

The
Affordable
Care
Act
is
already
working
for
families
across
the
Ninth
District.
According
to
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services,
147,000
individuals
in
the
district
now
have
health
insurance
that
covers
preventive
services
without
co-pays,
$3.1
million
in
insurance
premiums
have
been
returned
to
consumers,
and
more
than
5,000
seniors
on
Medicare
paid
a
total
of
$5.9
million
less
for
their
prescription
medications
as
we
continue
to
close
the
&#8216;donut
hole.&#8217;
Also,
health
insurance
companies
can
no
longer
discriminate
against
patients
with
pre-existing
conditions
and
young
adults
up
to
age
26
can
now
stay
on
their
parents&#8217;
insurance
plan.

VA
Rolls
Out
Secure
Veteran
Health
ID
Cards
The
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
recently
announced
the
phased
roll
out
of
newly
designed,
more
secure
Veteran
Health
Identification
Cards. The
new
cards
are
distinguished
by
additional
security
features
and
will
have
a
different
look
and
feel. In
addition
to
being
more
secure,
the
card
has
been
transformed
into
a
Veterans
Health
Identification
Card
(VHIC).
Similar
to
a
typical
health
insurance
card,
the
VHIC
displays
the
veteran&#8217;s
Member
ID,
a
new
unique
identifier,
as
well
as
a
Plan
ID,
reflecting
the
veteran&#8217;s
enrollment
in
VA
health
care. The
card
replaces
the
Veteran
Identification
Card
(VIC),
which
was
introduced
in
2004. As
part
of
a
phased
rollout,
the
card
will
only
be
offered
to
newly
enrolled
and
other
veterans
who
have
not
been
issued
a
VIC. In
early
April,
the
VA
will
begin
a
three
month
effort
to
automatically
issue
the
more
secure
VHIC
to
current
VIC
cardholders.
The
VA
recommends
veterans
safeguard
their
VIC
as
they
would
a
credit
card,
and
cut
up
or
shred
the
card
once
it
is
replaced. While
not
required
to
receive
VA
health
care,
all
enrolled
Veterans
are
encouraged
to
get
a
VHIC.
Enrolled
veterans
can
get
more
information
about
the
VHIC
by
visiting
their
VA
medical
facility
enrollment
coordinator
or
the
website
www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhic ,
calling
1-877-222-VETS
(8387)
or
visiting
their
local
VA
health
care
facility.
Veterans
who
are
not
enrolled
in
the
VA
health
care
system
can
apply
for
enrollment
at
any
time
by
visiting
www.va.gov/healthbenefits/enroll ,
calling
1-877-222-VETS
(8387)
or
visiting
their
local
VA
health
care
facility.
Helping
St.
Jude
This
week,
I
announced
nearly
$400,000
in
federal
grant
funds
to
St.
Jude
Children&#8217;s
Research
Hospital
to
aid
in
important
work
related
to
many
autoimmune
and
inflammatory
conditions.
The
funding
will
be
used
to
continue
important
research
at
St.
Jude,
which
is
the
world&#8217;s
leading
children&#8217;s
cancer
research
hospitals
and
one
of
the
finest
health
care
institutions
on
the
planet.
United
States
Naval
Academy
Summer
Programs
Each
year,
the
United
States
Naval
Academy
invites
more
than
3,000
students
to
Annapolis,
Maryland,
to
participate
in
its
summer
programs.
The
Academy&#8217;s
summer
STEM
program,
which
is
now
accepting
applications
here ,
gives
rising
8th,
9th,
10th,
and
11th
graders
the
opportunity
to
learn
from
some
of
the
best
college
professors
in
the
country
and
work
in
world-class
lab
facilities.
The
Academy&#8217;s
Summer
Seminars
gives
rising
12th
graders
the
opportunity
to
find
out
if
they
have
what
it
takes
to
be
midshipmen
by
allowing
them
to
experience
the
rigorous
academics,
physical
challenges,
and
student
life
at
the
Naval
Academy.

about
the
Summer
Seminar

Helping
Veterans
Become
Homeowners
Last
year,
the
U.S.
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
helped
a
record
number
of
veterans
obtain
mortgage
loans
and
become
homeowners .
In
guaranteeing
nearly
630,000
home
loans,
the
VA&#8217;s
Loan
Guarantee
program
helped
more
veterans
become
homeowners
or
move
to
a
new
home
than
at
any
point
in
its
70-year
history.
Not
only
is
this
great
news
for
veterans,
but
it
also
is
another
sign
that
our
housing
market
is
rebounding&#8212;and
that
is
good
news
for
everyone.
The
VA
Loan
Guarantee
program
has
some
of
the
lowest
foreclosure
rates
around
and,
along
with
offering
low
interest
rates,
their
loans
do
not
require
a
down
payment
from
first-time
buyers.
If
you
are
a
veteran
looking
to
purchase
a
home,
you
can
learn
more
about
the
program
here .
