Congresswoman
Mia
Love
Representing the 4th District
June 02, 2015
I am working in Washington every day to create a path of
upward mobility and
real
opportunity for every Utahn and every American. Education is a
critical component to opportunity. As we enter graduation
season , many high school seniors are looking
forward to continuing their education by going to college this fall.
Those prospective students are making costly and critical
decisions about their education with very little or completely
inaccurate information.
The
Student Right
to Know Before You Go Act
would give students access to the tools they
need to responsibly and confidently plan for their
future.
The bill is co-authored by Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) and
has bipartisan support from co-sponsors Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), Rep. Trey
Gowdy (R-SC), Rep. John Carney (D-DE), and Rep. Susan Davis
(D-CA).
The senate version of the bill was introduced by Senator Marco
Rubio (R-FL).
The Student Right to Know Before You
Go Act
would:
Empower students and
families with the tools needed for
a more
complete
picture of the value of their
education
Ensure accurate, easy to understand data be available online for
prospective students and their
families
Free up information that currently
exists, but is not currently
accessible
Match student records with
employment and earnings data
Ensure results would be highly accurate and
informative
Ensure privacy and security of student
data
Going to school to learn new skills is one of the best ways to improve
your quality of life.
But it's also one of the most costly.
Know Before You Go could help cut costs by giving students access
to useful information that would help them make better-informed
decisions about their education.
Im excited to co-sponsor this
commonsense reform.- Rep. Paul
Ryan
With the rising cost of higher
education, families and students have to make tough decisions when planning
for the future. Information is power, and this legislation will
improve transparency and help provide families with better tools when
making these important decisions . - Rep. Trey
Gowdy

I wrote an op-ed for the Salt Lake Tribune about the
"Know Before You
Go"
Act.
You can read
it by clicking

A
couple of recent articles in US News and World Report and the New York
Times focus on the problems college students sometimes face with their
student loans.
Read the
US News
piece: " What Grads Wish They Had Known About Paying for
College "
And the
New
York Times
piece: " Student Loan Facts They Wish
They'd
Known "
Achieving academic excellence is a significant accomplishment. It is my
pleasure to honor those students who have worked so
hard.
There are just under 2,000 high school
seniors in the Fourth District who achieved a 3.8 Grade Point Average or
higher throughout their entire high school career. That takes dedication
and hard work.
I dont want that excellence to go
unnoticed.
I was able to present 93 certificates in person to
the seniors at Murray High School.
Congratulations!
With
outstanding students at Murray High
School
