A Message from Representative Sean Duffy
April 13, 2014
Dear friends,
Several things happened this week that I want to make sure you're aware
of, so let's get right to it.
He can't say he didn't know: During a recent hearing in the House
Financial Services Committee, we heard gripping testimony from a CFPB
employee who cited multiple instances of sexism and racism within the
agency. Since President Obama often claims he was "unaware" of
misconduct or mismanagement within his Administration, I sent him a
letter to recap the horrific working environment at the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau. Please take a few minutes to watch the
brave testimony from one CFPB employee and read my full letter to the
President:
A responsible budget that balances: The House passed our Fiscal Year
2015 Budget resolution this week by a vote of 219-205.
If you have a
fiscal crisis and you have people who are having a hard time heating
their homes or putting food on the table, or kids that want to go to
college, or you want to build roads and bridges, there's not money
there for those projects. If you want to be able to invest in your
future, you have to make sure you have a budget that is sustainable.
The President, who did not submit a budget proposal that balances, has
said that in ten years the interest on the debt will be $880 billion.
You can build a lot of roads, bridges, you can feed a lot of people and
you can send a lot of kids to school for almost a trillion dollars a
year. Click on the image to watch my full remarks from the Floor debate:
Absolutely unacceptable: More Veterans seek help from the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) for hearing loss than any other disability facing
them today. However, because the demand for this service is so high,
many are forced to wait several months to be seen by a VA audiologist.
My bill, H.R. 3508, makes a small tweak that could make a big
difference to millions of our nation's heroes. This week, I was very
glad to be joined by Sgt. Matt Eversmann, a hero of "Blackhawk Down",
to discuss this bill and the important work that we need to continue to
do for our Veterans. Click on the image to watch our "Fox & Friends"
interview:
That's a wrap-up of this week that was. Please tune-in to 550 WSAU
tomorrow morning at 8:00 to hear more about the work I am doing on your
behalf. Also, if you haven't already, click on the link in the column
on the right to sign-up for our Job Fair and Veterans History Project
Workshop.
Until next week, have a great week -
Sean

A
Message
from
Representative
Sean
Duffy
April 13, 2014
Dear
friends,
[if gte mso 10]>
<![endif]
Several
things
happened
this
week
that
I
want
to
make
sure
you&#8217;re
aware
of,
so
let&#8217;s
get
right
to
it.
He
can&#8217;t
say
he
didn&#8217;t
know:
During
a
recent
hearing
in
the
House
Financial
Services
Committee,
we
heard
gripping
testimony
from
a
CFPB
employee
who
cited
multiple
instances
of
sexism
and
racism
within
the
agency.
Since
President
Obama
often
claims
he was
&#8220;unaware&#8221;
of
misconduct
or
mismanagement
within
his
Administration,
I
sent him
a
letter
to
recap
the
horrific
working
environment
at
the
Consumer
Financial
Protection
Bureau.
Please
take
a
few
minutes
to
watch
the
brave
testimony
from
one
CFPB
employee
and
read
my
full
letter
to
the
President:
A
responsible
budget
that
balances:
The
House
passed
our
Fiscal
Year
2015
Budget
resolution
this
week
by
a
vote
of
219-205.
If
you
have
a
fiscal
crisis
and
you
have
people
who
are
having
a
hard
time
heating
their
homes
or
putting
food
on
the
table,
or
kids
that
want
to
go
to
college,
or
you
want
to
build
roads
and
bridges,
there&#8217;s
not
money
there
for
those
projects.
If
you
want
to
be
able
to
invest
in
your
future,
you
have
to
make
sure
you
have
a
budget
that
is
sustainable.
The
President,
who
did
not
submit
a
budget
proposal
that
balances,
has
said
that
in
ten
years
the
interest
on
the
debt
will
be
$880
billion.
You
can
build
a
lot
of
roads,
bridges,
you
can
feed
a
lot
of
people
and
you
can
send
a
lot
of
kids
to
school
for
almost
a
trillion
dollars
a
year.
