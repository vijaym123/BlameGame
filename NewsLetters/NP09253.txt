Congressman Lamborn Calls
on VA Secretary Eric Shinseki to
Resign
5/28/14
During this evening's House Veterans Affairs Committee hearing,
Congressman Doug Lamborn called for the resignation of VA Secretary Eric
Shinseki.
My position has been
clear. Heads must roll. Those responsible for these waitlists must be
held responsible immediately. Unfortunately, the new IG report makes
it clear that Secretary Shinseki is failing to hold people accountable.
Therefore, the time has come for Secretary Shinseki to resign. What
were seeing in the VA IG report about secret wait lists and schemes to
deny our veterans care is appalling. Here we have a concrete example
of the failure of bureaucracy and a failure of leadership. Funding has
not been an issue. A supportive populace has not been the issue. The
issue has been with bureaucrats, aided and abetted by the hands-off
leadership style of this Administration, from President Obama to
Secretary Shinseki on down. We have so-called leaders who are more concerned
with padding their stats and pursuing their perversely structured
incentives than in genuinely helping our veterans. Even Secretary
Shinsekis response to the IG investigation today was a failure. He promises
to triage the 1,700 veterans on the secret wait list in Phoenix.
Those 1,700 veterans shouldnt be triaged, they should be seen
immediately.
Secretary
Shinsekis leadership has failed the 1,700 or more veterans in Phoenix, and
the 100,000 veterans in my district deserve a Secretary of the VA who
can be trusted. I demand that President Obama direct the Attorney
General to launch a criminal investigation into the culture of corruption
that is seemingly running rampant through the VA. The VA has been lying
and deceiving veterans and Congress but we will not tire and we will
not rest until we get to the bottom of this appalling
tragedy.
