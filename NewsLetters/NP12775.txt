Dear Friends,
As a former Florida
certified teacher as well as a former administrator of a
bilingual
elementary school in Hialeah, I know that quality educators make the
difference in ensuring the future of both our children and our South
Florida community. One of the central reasons why I was inspired to enter
public service was to improve the opportunities of our kids and fight
for a stronger education system for all.
Making sure every
student has access to caring and professional teachers will require an
engaged and diverse coalition of our community, one with parents first
and foremost. And then sometimes, a horrible tragedy magnifies the
will and determination needed to make this noble goal an ultimate
priority.
One such case would be that of the Andrea Castillo
Foundation. The foundation was established just last year, by her mother
Sandra Castillo after Andrea was tragically killed in a car accident in
October 2012. Sandra decided to create a legacy for her daughter, who
was studying to be a teacher. The Foundation was named in Andreas
honor and its staff exhibits her dedication and passion for
education.
Over the last academic year, the Andrea Castillo Foundation
awarded eight scholarships to students attending Miami-Dade College
and Florida international University College of Teaching. Recently, the
Foundation has expanded to include further programs that support the
educational pursuits of the teachers of
tomorrow.
Encouraging, and providing support for, our next generation of teachers as they
begin to develop the essential skills they will need to inspire our
children are goals toward which the Andrea Castillo Foundation is
striving. Its work will help provide future educators with the support they
need to be the positive drivers of our school system, ones ready to
improve and strengthen South Florida.
I encourage our South
Florida community to join me in supporting the Andrea Castillo
Foundation. For more information or to apply for a scholarship, visit the
Foundations website: andreacastillofoundation.org.
Sincerely,
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
