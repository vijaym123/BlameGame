Tell what you think the best way to strengthen Social Security is!
Friend,
Thanks to each of you who submitted your story over the past few days about how Social Security has helped you and your family.
Check out
this week's video , where I highlight a particularly touching constituent story.
Youve heard from me about what Im doing to ensure that Social Security remains intact.
But it's time we hear from you once again.
I want to know what you think the best way to strengthen the U.S. Social Security system is by
completing this brief survey.
President Johnson knew that we do better when we work together, tell me what you would like to see us achieve together.
Sincerely,
