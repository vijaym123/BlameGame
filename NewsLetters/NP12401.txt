Dear
Fellow Nevadan,
This week, I was pleased the Senate
passed the
Military Retirement Pay Restoration
Act
that restores the full cost of living adjustment (COLA) for military
retirees. This bill, which is headed to President Obamas desk for
his signature, will benefit 750,000 military retirees across the
country who will now reclaim the benefits they were promised when they
volunteered to serve our nation.
I heard from Nevadas
veterans and dozens of Veterans Service Organizations who informed me
of the impact this would have on our heroes. While we must work to
reduce our nation's deficit, we should not do so on the backs of our
veterans. That is why I am pleased that Republicans and Democrats could
come together on this compromise. I will continue to fight to ensure the
men and women of our Armed Forces receive the benefits that they have
earned through their service to our country.

Benefits of the Restoring Military Retirement Pay
Act
The
legislation will restore full retirement payments for up to 750,000 military
retirees.
Of the 1.94 million retirees that collected
benefits in FY12, it has been estimated that 40 percent, or 750,000
would have faced a benefit cut if action had not been taken to restore
payments. [CRS, 2/11/14]
Enlisted retirees stand to reclaim thousands of dollars each year with
their full COLA restored.
For an E-7 retiring this year
with 20 years of service, the cut will result in an average reduction
in their promised retirement benefits of $3,700 per year, until they
reach age 62. Lifetime retirement pay for enlisted personnel will be
reduced from $1.73 million to $1.67 million for a 4 percent cut of
$69,000. Lifetime retirement pay for officers will be reduced from $3.83
million to $3.74 million, for a 2.3 percent cut equal to $87,000.
[Testimony of General John H. Tilelli, Jr. (Ret.), MOAA, 1/28/14; CRS,
2/11/14]
The bill
will protect retirement payments before cuts take place.
The
COLA modification included in the Bipartisan Budget Act is not slated to
go into effect until December 1, 2015. The
Restoring Military
Retirement Pay Act
will grandfather current retirees and the current
force from the effects of the COLA
reduction.
