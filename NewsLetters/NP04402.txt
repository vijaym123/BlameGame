The Marianas High School Aeronautical Dolphins defended their national title this weekend at the 2014 Real World Design Challenge. The event brought teams from over 35 states, territories, and U.S. affiliated nations to demonstrate their engineering solution to a real world problem and to make the business case for their proposal. This years challenge involved using avionics and remote sensing to spot invasive species on farm lands. Congratulations to the Aeronautical Dolphins and even if you were not 1st place this year, you all are already champions.
Child care act, supporting working families, extended for six years
200 Northern Marianas families get help paying for childcare through the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act . Congress reauthorized the Act for another six years on Monday and the President signed the bill into law two days later. The Child Care Act provides the Northern Mariana Islands with over $2 million each year. The money pays some of the cost of childcare for low-income households, freeing parents to work or to train for new jobs. The reauthorization makes a number of reforms aimed at strengthening health and safety protections, so that mothers and fathers can feel sure their children are safe and well cared for. In addition, the law now provides more stability for families by continuing childcare support for at least a year even if parents income suddenly changes. Before, the law disqualified parents within a month, if their income rose above the programs limits.

Gross Domestic Product in the Northern Marianas increased 4.4 percent in 2013, the best rate of growth in a decade and the second straight year of increase. The Bureau of Economic Analysis released the 2013 data on Monday.
GDP up again in 2013
The primary measure of economic growth, Gross Domestic Product, rose 4.4 percent in 2013 in the Northern Marianas, according to analysis released this week by the Bureau of Economic Analysis . It was the second consecutive year of growth for our islands. The primary drivers were increased consumer spending, particularly for automobiles, and increased tourism. Consumer spending was up 12.3 percent. Tourism, reflected in the export of services category, was up 8.8 percent. GDP is the sum of all spending by consumers, government, and business, and increased from $665 million in 2012 to $682 million in 2013. The Bureau of Economic Analysis, part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, compiles GDP data for the Northern Mariana Islands and other U.S. insular areas with funding from the U.S. Department of Interiors Office of Insular Affairs. The next release of GDP data
for 2014
is planned for the summer of 2015.

How Presidents immigration announcement affects the Northern Marianas
President Obama announced on Thursday that he will be using his executive authority to address the situation of some of the 11 million persons who are not legally present in the United States. Although the Senate passed a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill in July 2013, the House of Representatives has not taken action. So the President stepped in. His action is primarily aimed at persons who do not have a legal status. In the Northern Marianas CW workers, E-2C investors, and the immediate relatives of U.S. and FAS citizens and caregivers who have been granted humanitarian parole are all legally present. But there may be some in the NMI, who have lost their legal status, who could benefit. The Presidents action does not provide any new pathway to citizenship, but may make it easier for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens and others eligible for naturalization by allowing the use of credit cards to pay the $680 fee. Currently, only cash, check, or money order is accepted. Further information about the Presidents announcement is available here .

A 30 km long fiber-optic sensor (shown in yellow) buried around the northern volcano is part of the monitoring system in place on the island of Pagan, but not reporting data because of a lack of funding for a satellite uplink. The U.S. Geological Survey has also installed a 7 station seismic network, 2 web cams, and 2 infrasound arrays to keep tabs on the frequent small explosions and degassing events on Pagan. With the loss of real-time data transmission, USGS now monitors the volcanic activity by daily images captured from satellite.
Hearing asks why USGS no longer has real-time seismic monitoring of Pagan volcano
The recent lava flow on the island of Hawaii, threatening the village of Pahoa, drew congressional attention at a hearing of the Natural Resources Committee this week. Scientists from the Volcano Hazards Program of the U.S. Geological Survey here for the hearing also briefed your congressional office on volcano monitoring on Pagan, Anatahan, Sarigan, and Saipan. All four islands have ground based digital instrumentation and telemetry principally paid for by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, or ARRA. But the Pagan equipment is currently not streaming real-time data because a lack of funding prevents uplinking to satellite. Pagan is still being actively monitored by daily analysis of satellite images of the island. In the meantime, USGS and the Army Corps of Engineers are pursuing other funding sources to re-start the satellite uplink. And your congressional office will also be requesting the needed funding for the Volcano Hazards Program through the member submission procedure in the fiscal year 2016 appropriation process. back to top

Ms. Erika Webb, a recent graduate in international relations from Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, began a two-month stint at your congressional office this week. Ms. Webb is participating in the David Teece CNZM Internship Program, which aims to foster greater understanding of the US legislative process among outstanding students from our Pacific neighbor, New Zealand. The USNZ Council and the Honorable Mike Moore, former Prime Minister and now New Zealands Ambassador to the United States, set up the Program to aid with recovery after the devastating Christchurch earthquake in 2011. Ambassador Moore invited the Northern Mariana Islands to be one of the four areas of the U.S. hosting an intern this year. Ms. Webb will be working with us as we complete legislative activity for the 113th Congress and prepare our legislative agenda for the 114th Congress that convenes in January. And she will be looking for common policy concerns and solutions that can be shared by our two Pacific island areas, New Zealand and the Northern Marianas. Welcome, Erika.
