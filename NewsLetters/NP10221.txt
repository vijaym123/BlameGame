Westmoreland Stays Busy During April District Work
Weeks
Over the last two weeks, I had the opportunity to
travel throughout Georgia's Third District and visit a variety of
facilities and events. I hosted two informational workshops that specifically
targeted two of the highest constituent services requests for my
office: Veterans and Social Security/Medicare. The primary responsibility
of my office is constituent services. In addition to VA benefits and
Social Security disability, please contact the Newnan office at
770-683-2033 for assistance with any federal agency.
Between site
visits, community meetings, and the workshops, I had the opportunity
to hear what matters most to Georgians and their businesses so I can
continue to represent you in Washington.
Below are photos of
some of what I was up to during these district work
weeks:
Hosted a Veterans Information Workshop in Newnan

McDonough
