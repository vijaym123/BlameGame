May 25, 2014
Dear
David,
Memorial Day
for many of us marks a long weekend of relaxing with family and
friends, barbequing, and enjoying the nice weather and beginning of
summer.
But tomorrow also carries a more solemn significance, a time
to reflect on the sacrifices made that allow us to enjoy the freedom
we have today. It is a day to commemorate our nations best and
bravest who have made the ultimate sacrifice and to honor those who continue
to heed the call to protect and serve this great nation.
I
hope that all of us can take time this weekend to remember our fallen
heroes and show our gratitude for the unparalleled sacrifices that
have been made on our behalf.
I want to take this opportunity
to offer my most sincere gratitude to all of our troops, those
serving now and in the past, across our country. Your service will never be
forgotten.
Sincerely,
