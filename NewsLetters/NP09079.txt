Rep. Miller Statement on the 70 th
Anniversary of D-Day
Harrison Township, MI
&#8211; Today, U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10) issued the following statement on tomorrow&#8217;s 70 th
anniversary of D-Day:
&#8220;Tomorrow, we recognize the 70 th
anniversary of the dramatic events that transpired on the beaches of Normandy on June 6, 1944, when 160,000 allied troops stormed the heavily-fortified beaches to push back Nazi forces.
The
attack, the largest amphibious invasion in world history, was a major victory and turning point for Allied forces, but one that came with enormous sacrifice.
&#8220;We must always remember the brave American and Allied soldiers that stormed Normandy by air and by sea on that historic day. They are amongst world history&#8217;s greatest patriots and defenders of freedom and democracy.
&#8220;General Dwight D. Eisenhower said to U.S. forces before the pivotal invasion, &#8216;the hopes and prayers of liberty loving people everywhere march with you.&#8217; We shall honor and celebrate those brave soldiers and continue to provide our
hopes and prayers to march with the brave servicemen and women who continue to fight for our freedom today.&#8221;
