Dear Friend,
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! Over the past couple of weeks, Sandy and I have thoroughly enjoyed spending time with our family and eight grandchildren. It has been a joyous season, with one of our sons getting engaged, our daughters family visiting from Chicago, and everyone spending time together.
I am grateful for the many blessings of 2013. It has been an honor to serve you in Congress, despite all the troubles and frustrations in Washington. Getting to know community members throughout the district, hearing from local businessmen and women, and serving alongside nonprofit organizations has been incredibly rewarding. I appreciate the opportunity to hear your thoughts, share your concerns, and represent you in Congress.
This year, I was able to participate in hundreds of district events and meet thousands of community members throughout the district. In my final event of the year, I joined the Tavares Shuffleboard Club members in celebrating their 100th anniversary, and participated in their shuffleboard tournament. It was a privilege to be a part of this momentous community celebration and recognize the rich history of a Tavares pastime.
As we enter 2014, I look forward to continuing to serve you and fight for the principles that will make our government more accountable and America stronger and more secure for our children and grandchildren.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
In the Fall, a constituent contacted my office about a tour he was hoping to set up at the White House over Christmas. Thirty five years ago, his father had proposed to his mother in Washington DC on the National Mall, and he was hoping to replicate this experience with his future bride. My office was able to coordinate his White Hour tour request and it was a great privilege to assist in making this special moment and Christmas surprise possible.
My staff is eager to provide assistance facilitating tour requests for many of the popular and historic sites in Washington.
Scott Johnson serves as my tour coordinator and can answer any questions you may have regarding your visit to our nations capital.
Please do not hesitate to contact Scott at Scott.Johnson@mail.house.gov or 202.225.2176.
