Dear Friend,
On November 30, I am excited to celebrate Small Business Saturday - a
day to honor those businesses that are the backbone of the American
economy. Did you know that, according to the Small Business
Administration, small businesses are responsible for 64 percent of the
new jobs created between 1993 and 2011?
Having owned small businesses for 25 years, I know these last few years
have been rough on entrepreneurs. Small businesses have found it
difficult to grow and hire new workers in this economic environment -
from the market crash of 2008 to the flood of new Obamacare
regulations. Be assured that I will continue to fight against
job-destroying regulations that stand in the way of achieving the
American dream.
I would also like to recognize small businesses in Arizona's Fourth
Congressional District that are making a positive contribution to our
economy.
If you are a small business owner or know someone who is, email me at
GosarBusiness@mail.house.gov with the owner's name, a picture of the
business, and a few sentences about what the business does. At the end
of the week, I'll recognize the entrants with an official Congressional
"Entrepreneur Certificate." I will also post a list of them on my
Facebook page, so sign up today and be recognized!
As always, you can follow everything I am working on in Arizona and
Washington, D.C. through my website (http://gosar.house.gov
) on Twitter @repgosar
, or through Facebook
at Representative Paul Gosar.
Sincerely,
Paul A. Gosar, D.D.S.
Member of Congress

Did

Administration,
small

responsible

64
percent

Having

25

I
know
these
last
few
years
have
been
rough

entrepreneurs.
Small

have
found
it

this
economic
environment
-
from
the

Be
assured
that
I
will
continue
to
fight
against
job-destroying
regulations
that
stand

I
would
also
like
to

with
the

name,
a
picture
of
the
business,
and
a
few

about
what
the
business
does.
At
the
end

I&#8217;ll
recognize
the

with
an
