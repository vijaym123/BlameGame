Dear Fellow Nevadan,
Yesterdays
immigration announcement is great news for families in Nevada and
across the country. Millions of families in our nation and thousands in
Nevada will no longer have to live in fear of losing a loved one to
deportation. The Presidents executive action will not only keep families
together, it will enforce our immigration laws in a way that protects
our national security and public safety. It will strengthen our
economy by creating new jobs and allowing these families to fully contribute
to the only country they call home.
The American people
have waited for us to fix our countrys broken immigration system. The
Senate passed a strong bipartisan comprehensive immigration bill over a
year ago that would have permanently fixed our broken immigration
system. Sadly, House Republicans have demonstrated that they are more
interested in playing partisan politics than doing what is right for our
country. They ask for more time but we have given them plenty of time,
511 days to be exact. The House let millions of families languish
while passing measures to revoke Deferred Action and deport DREAMers,
leaving the President no option but to take matters into his own
hands.
The Presidents executive action is a good first step;
however it is only a temporary solution. President Obama is doing what he
can within his well-established constitutional authority but nothing
replaces Congress acting on comprehensive immigration reform. So today,
while I thank President Obama for his decisive action, I ask my
Republican colleagues to put their partisan politics aside and focus their
efforts on passing legislation that will permanently fix our broken
immigration system. I will continue to fight until we make immigration
reform a reality.
