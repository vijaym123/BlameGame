David --
Speaker Boehner and the House GOP just announced their new anti-middle class budget.
Once
again
they&rsquo;ve put Medicare on the chopping block -- vowing to turn Medicare into a voucher program while forcing seniors to pay more for health care.
That&rsquo;s unacceptable. Over 1.9 MILLION seniors in Illinois rely on Medicare. We can&rsquo;t let the GOP turn Medicare into a voucher program.
5O,OOO SIGNATURES NEEDED:
Sign your name to stop Boehner from trampling on Medicare &gt;&gt; Supporter: David Johnson Signature:

When Illinois seniors work hard their entire careers, they deserve to retire with dignity. That&rsquo;s Medicare&rsquo;s promise.
But Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s plan threatens to destroy Medicare as we know it.
Cheri&rsquo;s standing up to protect Medicare. Will you join her? SIGN YOUR NAME:
