This year, the Northern Mariana Islands Christmas Tree is adorned with ornaments crafted by Tinian Elementary School's Tinian Heritage Club. Our tree stands beside the National Christmas Tree near the White House, together with trees decorated by students from every state and territory. For more information on the 2014 National Christmas Tree, visit http:// thenationaltree.org/2014-national-christmas-tree/ .
The Tinian Heritage Club (below) is a group of 6th graders who are interested in the history of the Mariana Islands and are dedicated to preserving our culture and traditions. Regarding their choice for the materials of the ornaments, they said "the coconut palm was chosen for our Christmas ornaments because they represent the 'Tree of Life,' as the coconut palm is known throughout the Pacific region. For thousands of years, the coconut has given our people food, water, shelter, clothing, oil, lumber, fish hooks, utensils, and many other things. We are proud of our heritage and feel it adds to the uniqueness of our American way."

Our students in the NMI are some of the brightest and most talented in the entire nation and the students I visited this week at Tinian Elementary School offered a stirring reminder of that. Thank you to Ms. Barbara Safer and her 6th grade students at TES for the opportunity to speak about what I do as your Congressman. These students were also the talented and creative minds that created the Christmas ornaments adorning our tree in front of the White House. As I said - we have the best students in the nation right here in our classrooms. Go Colts!
President signs H.R. 83 continuing NMI immigration policies, funding federal government - On Tuesday, President Obama signed H.R. 83 , the insular areas bill that was used as a vehicle to fund most of the federal government for fiscal 2015. I had six separate bills in motion to continue the bar on claims of asylum from the Northern Mariana Islands, protecting our tourist industry; to keep the NMI free of the national cap on the number of H visas, which should be useful to resort developers who need temporary construction workers; and to allow foreign investors, whom our own Commonwealth immigration law permitted in return for a minimum investment, to remain here for five more years. Of the six, H.R. 83 was the bill that made it over the legislative finish line. H.R. 83 also provides tens of millions of dollars in annual funding to the NMI for the remainder of FY2015. The following table lists some of the more high profile of those grants-in-aid. Most NMI funding (in parenthesis) is estimated to be about the same as for FY2014, though some allocations may go up or down based on changes in population or other factors. In FY2014 federal funding to the Northern Mariana Islands was $133 million, according to USASpending.gov .

"No money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law." U.S. Constitution, article 1, section 9. Each year, each Member of the House of Representatives, including the insular area Delegates, submits to the House Appropriations Committee our recommendations for which programs to fund and what the funding amounts should be. Insular area representatives are treated no differently than other Members of Congress in this polling, which then becomes a basis for the annual spending bills drafted by the Committee.

Dr. Nicole M. Forrester, CEO of Pacific Resources for Education and Learning, visited the Saipan district office this week on her multi-island listening tour. PREL's mission is to enhance community well-being through partnerships in education. I shared with her my work to support the education of our people in the NMI through increases to Pell grant and ESEA Title I funding, among other things. Thank you for your visit, Dr. Forrester!
