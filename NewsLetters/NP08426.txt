Update from Congressman Scott Tipton

In Case You Missed It
Tipton votes to give waitlisted and rural vets access to private
healthcare: The Veteran Access to Care Act of 2014, of which Tipton is
a cosponsor, would for a period of two years direct the VA Secretary to
contract with private medical providers to provide care for veterans
that have waited longer than the VA's wait time goals, could not get an
appointment during that time, or live over 40 miles from a VA medical
facility. Read more
.
Tipton responds to VA audit: "The findings of the VA's internal audit
are an outrage and reflect what I have heard firsthand from
constituents across the district-that there are many veterans in this
nation experiencing ridiculous wait times to receive the healthcare
they need, and some are falling through the cracks altogether. The
problems facing the VA are systemic and need to be addressed
immediately. The solutions I am working on with my colleagues would
help address those issues by improving timely health care for veterans
through access to private-sector medical providers, and changing the
culture at the VA by giving the Secretary the ability to more easily
fire senior VA executives that have failed to do their jobs," said
Tipton. Read more

Tipton: EPA, Forest Service rules imperil farmers' and ranchers' access
to water rights: Congressman Tipton questioned U.S. Department of
Agriculture Undersecretary Robert Bonnie during a House Agriculture
Subcommittee hearing to review the "Interpretive Rule Regarding the
Applicability of Clean Water Act Agricultural Exemptions." Tipton
emphasized that while the EPA Clean Water Act Rule covers all surface
water, a new proposed Forest Service Groundwater Directive will expand
that agency's regulatory overreach to include all groundwater-including
access to streams and tributaries that feed into it. Combined, these
two administrative actions could drastically restrict farmers and
ranchers from accessing their water rights on all fronts. Read more
.
Tipton statement on the situation in Iraq: "Under the President's watch
terrorism has increased across the Middle East-in Syria, Libya, Egypt
and now Iraq-where so many of our brave men and women fought and
sacrificed so much. Much of this could have been prevented with a
strong and deliberate foreign policy that protects our national
security interests, something that the Administration has lacked. The
President must lead, and I believe that means committing to a
definitive and strategic course of action in the region that doesn't
involve deploying American combat troops. Congress is waiting to see
that plan." Read more
.
Tipton urges BLM to collaborate with state and local stakeholders on
Gunnison sage grouse: Congressman Tipton stressed that state and local
involvement is a necessity as the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)
revises 11 resource management plans (RMP) in Colorado and Utah. The
BLM proposal, which would impact 800,000 acres in the states, comes on
the heels of a district court decision in May to grant a six month
extension of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service decision deadline on
the proposed endangered species listing of the Gunnison sage grouse.

Tipton's hydropower law helps advance West Slope projects: Congressman
Scott Tipton toured the site of a new hydropower project on the
Montrose and Delta Canal at Shavano Falls that will provide clean,
renewable and affordable hydropower on the West Slope once completed.
It is one of four small hydropower projects underway by the Uncompahgre
Valley Water Users Association that are directly impacted by Tipton's
Hydropower and Rural Jobs Act (H.R. 678). Tipton's legislation, which
was signed into law in August, reduced the time and cost of small
hydropower projects like that at Shavano Falls by streamlining the
permitting process and clearing red tape that would have required
duplicative regulatory paperwork. Read more
.
Tipton wants local input included in Forest Service travel management
plans: "The Forest Service is supposed to be listening and
incorporating local input into travel management plans that impact
access to public lands, but it's not happening in all cases, and that
is a real problem.
The commonsense Forest Access in Rural Communities
Act (H.R. 4247) would address that problem by requiring the Forest
Service to incorporate the needs of affected local communities into
travel management plans before implementing them. This would give local
communities an assured voice in a process," said Tipton. Read more

Tipton:
EPA,
Forest
Service
rules
imperil
farmers&#8217;
and
ranchers&#8217;
access
to
water
rights :
Congressman
Tipton
questioned
U.S.
Department
of
Agriculture
Undersecretary
Robert
Bonnie
during
a
House
Agriculture
Subcommittee
hearing
to
review
the
&#8220;Interpretive
Rule
Regarding
the
Applicability
of
Clean
Water
Act
Agricultural
Exemptions.&#8221;
Tipton
emphasized
that
while
the
EPA
Clean
Water
Act
Rule
covers
all
surface
water,
a
new
proposed
Forest
Service
Groundwater
Directive
will
expand
that
agency&#8217;s
regulatory
overreach
to
include
all
groundwater&#8212;including
access
to
streams
and
tributaries
that
feed
into
it.
Combined,
these
two
administrative
actions
could
drastically
restrict
farmers
and
ranchers
from
accessing
their
water
rights
on
all
fronts.

Tipton
statement
on
the
situation
in
Iraq :
&#8220;Under
the
President&#8217;s
watch
terrorism
has
increased
across
the
Middle
East&#8212;in
Syria,
Libya,
Egypt
and
now
Iraq&#8212;where
so
many
of
our
brave
men
and
women
fought
and
sacrificed
so
much.
Much
of
this
could
have
been
prevented
with
a
strong
and
deliberate
foreign
policy
that
protects
our
national
security
interests,
something
that
the
Administration
has
lacked.
The
President
must
lead,
and
I
believe
that
means
committing
to
a
definitive
and
strategic
course
of
action
in
the
region
that
doesn&#8217;t
involve
deploying
American
combat
troops.
Congress
is
waiting
to
see
that
plan.&#8221;

Tipton&#8217;s
hydropower
law
helps
advance
West
Slope
projects :
Congressman
Scott
Tipton
toured
the
site
of
a
new

project
on
the
Montrose
and
Delta
Canal
at
Shavano
Falls
that
will
provide
clean,
renewable

affordable
hydropower
on
the
West
Slope
once
completed.
It
is
one
of
four
small
hydropower
projects
underway
by
the
Uncompahgre
Valley
Water
Users
Association
that
are
directly
impacted
by
Tipton&#8217;s
Hydropower

Rural

Tipton&#8217;s

cost
of
small
hydropower
projects

Tipton
wants

it&#8217;s

The
