Moments ago, I voted for
legislation in the U.S. House to protect one of the Constitutions most
cherished liberties
freedom of speech.
The heavy
hand of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has proposed changes in
the tax code that would upend 50 years of political expression by
Americans.
In fact, this IRS proposal is so dangerous and chilling
that it is opposed by the American Civil Liberties Union, the Faith and
Freedom Coalition, the 60-Plus Association and dozens of other
organizations.
Under the proposed rule, social
welfare organizations would face additional, unprecedented scrutiny for
engaging in the most basic nonpartisan political activity, such as
organizing a nonpartisan get-out-the-vote drive, registering voters, or
hosting candidate forums in their neighborhood.
If the Treasury
Department and IRS have their way, these sorts of activities would
jeopardize the tax-exempt status of social welfare
organizations.
It is clear that the American people are also
concerned that these proposed rules would squash their First Amendment
rights.
Treasury has received over 94,000 comments on the rule so far,
which is the most they have received on any rule
ever.
For this reason, I voted for the Stop Targeting of
Political Beliefs by the IRS Act, to prohibit the IRS from finalizing
this controversial rule.
The legislation now goes to the Senate
where it awaits action.
This is neither a
Republican or Democrat issue.
It is an American issue.
I
will continue to fight against any effort by a government agency to
erode the First Amendment.
Please tell me what
you think.
