The House is once again making energy a
priority in Congress.
We need to harness our countrys
abundant energy resources, like natural gas, which will lead to more jobs and
cheaper energy prices for American families.
On January
21 st , the House passed the
Natural Gas Pipeline
Permitting Reform Act .
Too often, construction to build and
improve our nations energy infrastructure gets caught in Washingtons
red tape.
This legislation will help move our nations abundant
supply of natural gas to market, creating jobs and lowering energy costs
for hard-working taxpayers.
The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) is tasked with deciding whether a pipeline is in the
publics best interest. The agency approves or rejects natural gas
pipeline construction on an average of 12 months, but other relevant
regulatory agencies requiring additional permits, such as the Environmental
Protection Agency, often lengthen the process and total project costs.
There are currently no statutory time limits on the process.
The
Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform Act
would
require FERC to approve or deny projects within one year of receiving
applications. All other agencies involved in additional permits for
pipeline construction would have a mandatory maximum 90-day review period.
Any pending application after the one-year or 90-day time period
without extension would be automatically approved.
On January
28 th , the House passed the
LNG Permitting Certainty
and Transparency Act .
Americas energy revolution has
made our country a leader in natural gas production.
We can
harness natural gas not only here at home to help strengthen our economy
and create thousands of jobs, but also export it to help our European
allies and others reduce their energy dependence from adversarial
nations that use energy as a weapon.
This, for example, would
help countries such as Ukraine be less dependent on an oppressive
Russia to meet their energy needs, while creating jobs here at home, giving
a much needed boost to our economy.
Natural gas is just
one part of my support for an all of the above approach to
energy.
Our country has the resources to be a world leader in energy
production, which translates into more jobs here at home.
I will
continue to back efforts that will help our country become energy
independent.
