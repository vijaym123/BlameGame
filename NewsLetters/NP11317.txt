David -- Tomorrow, Cheri&rsquo;s race could become unrecognizable.
Up until now, special interest groups have been holding back, waiting to make sure ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling was their guy.
That will all change tomorrow when Schilling is announced the winner of the Illinois Republican primary. In 2012, Bobby Schilling and outside groups spent over $10 MILLION on this race. That&rsquo;s a daunting number, and it could be even higher in 2014.
Cheri&rsquo;s trying to raise $10,000 in grassroots contributions for her Illinois Rapid Response Fund before tomorrow&rsquo;s primary. With this race kicking into high-gear, she can&rsquo;t fall short. David, please chip in $8 or more before midnight tomorrow to help Cheri fight back against Bobby Schilling and his right-wing backers &gt;&gt; If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: EXPRESS DONATE: $8 EXPRESS DONATE: $35 EXPRESS DONATE: $50 EXPRESS DONATE: $100 EXPRESS DONATE: $250 Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
There's no doubt that the vast majority of Schilling&rsquo;s money will be converted into ads attacking Cheri on the air here in Illinois. If we don&rsquo;t have the resources to fight back against the onslaught of attacks and get the facts out to Illinois voters, Cheri could fall seriously behind.
Cheri&rsquo;s committed to keep fighting for Illinois families, but she needs your help to be successful. Please chip in immediately:

Team Bustos
P.S. Bobby Schilling promised to spend $2 million against Cheri in this race. We&rsquo;ve got to close the gap.
Chip in what you can immediately &gt;&gt;
