Dear Friend:
I'm
honored to once again to be named the
Most Productive
Member of Congress . According to TrackBill, over the past five
sessions, out of the 540 legislators in both chambers of Congress, I
passed the most number of bills, including the Patient Protection and the
Affordable Care Act. I've dedicated my life to serving my community
and my country.
I am fired up and will keep fighting for what is
in your best interest and to move our great nation
forward.
Raising the Wage:
I'm very pleased that
the Port Authority has voted unanimously to increase wages and
benefits for all of its airport workers, including those in New Jersey. Last
month, I wrote to Gov. Christie to urge the Port Authority to do just
that, and as a result, 12,000 minimum wage workers are on track to
get a raise.
I stood with the workers to demand
justice , and will continue to demand fair pay for everyone, such as the
Jazz artists in our District. I'll also keep pushing to raise the
federal minimum wage to ensure working men and women can earn a livable
wage.
Fight for the DREAM:
I
was greatly disappointed that the NY State Senate rejected the Dream
Act, a bill providing state financial aid for college for the children of
undocumented immigrants. Our current immigration system denies some
of the best and brightest students in the nation the chance to help
America maintain its greatness. I urge the State Senate to stop crushing
the dreams of immigrant children in their pursuit of success. As one
of the earliest co-sponsors of the DREAM Act when it was first
introduced in 2001, I'm fighting for its passage in Congress in order to give
our immigrant families a shot at the American
Dream.
Engaging With You:
I enjoyed interacting with
many of you this week at various events around the community. I hosted
a
Women's Empowerment Event , gathering
prominent business leaders, government officials and super women from all over
the District. I answered questions about getting healthcare coverage
at my
"The Affordable Care Act and NY State of
Health"
event. I discussed a variety of issues with nearly 7,400
seniors in a
Telephonic-Town hall . In addition, it was
great to join my friends of Silicon Harlem
in a
conversation with Microsoft's Andrea L. Taylor
and several local tech
enthusiasts, about ways that we can work together to transform our
District into the next Silicon Valley.
Listening to your concerns
and opinions is my number one priority. I will be hosting another
district-wide telephonic-town hall, next Monday at 7pm, to do just that.
If you would like to participate please

you.
Best regards,
Charles Rangel
Please share with your friends &amp;

HAPPY 4TH TO
ACA
Four years ago I was proud to
watch President Barack Obama sign into law the historical Affordable
Care Act, a bill I had introduced and helped pass in the House. With
this law, the promise and hope of quality affordable coverage is now a
reality. More than five million people nationwide have selected a
health plan through the health insurance marketplace, including nearly
670,000 New Yorkers. As we approach the deadline to sign-up for 2014
benefits on March 31st, I encourage everybody to sign-up and get covered.
Don't delay, sign-up today!
