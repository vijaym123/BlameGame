Conaway Chronicle: Homeland Security Funding, Upcoming Town Hall, Keystone Heads to President's Desk, Congressman Johnson's 42nd "Returnniversary"
__________________________________________
Thank you for reading The Conaway Chronicle, a review of my activities in Congress.
Senate Must Act on DHS Funding
In January, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 240, the Homeland Security Appropriations Act, which will fund the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for the remainder of the fiscal year as well as defund the Presidents illegal amnesty plan. However, the Senate has not yet passed similar legislation, and DHS funding is set to run out in just two weeks.
The Senate must now act to keep the Department of Homeland Security open and functional past February 28th. Instead of buckling down and working through the normal legislative process, Senate Democrats are refusing to allow the Homeland Security funding bill to even be considered.
Without this legislation, our borders will be unprotected and our national security will be at risk. It is imperative that Senate Democrats stop blocking this critical legislation and keep DHS operating normally. We are now down to the wire, and it is simply not an option for Senate Democrats to continue to block the Homeland Security funding bill.

Bill to Approve Keystone Pipeline Headed to Presidents Desk
Wednesday, the House of Representatives voted to pass legislation authorizing the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. The Senate also recently approved this measure, and it will now go to the Presidents desk. President Obama now has a very simple choice: he can either listen to the American people and approve a project that will create jobs and economic growth, or he can continue his partisan games and veto this legislation.
The Keystone XL Pipeline is ready to bring tens of thousands of quality jobs and billions of dollars in earnings to hard working Americans. Our national security interests are also at stake here. By blocking the construction of this pipeline, the President is forcing us to continue relying on unstable Middle Eastern nations for our energy supply. The Keystone Pipeline has been stalled for long enough. I sincerely hope that the President is able to put the American people ahead of his political cronies. Its time for the President to sign this legislation, and its time to build the Keystone XL Pipeline.
Honoring Congressman Sam Johnson's 42nd "Returnniversary"
Forty-two years ago, Congressman Sam Johnson returned home to his wife and children after nearly seven years of captivity and torture as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam.
Congressman Johnson served in the United States Air Force for 29 years. During a 1966 night combat mission, he was shot down over North Vietnam and captured. He was held as a POW for the next seven years in the infamous "Hanoi Hilton" Hao Lo Prison.
He has said that it was the grace and mercy of God who provided him with the strength to survive those seven years. The photograph below shows Congressman Johnson reuniting with his family on the tarmac at the Sheppard Air Force Base.
We are so fortunate to have Congressman Johnson continuing his service to our nation as a Member of the House of Representatives. The sacrifices he has made serve to remind us of all those POWs and MIAs who aren't with us today.
As always, you can follow me on

Sincerely,
Rep. Mike Conaway, 11th District
