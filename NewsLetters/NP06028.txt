to take my survey
Muslim extremist groups based in Syria and Iraq have taken the lives of two American citizens and have presented serious threats against the United States in recent months.
To combat this dangerous threat, my colleagues in the House passed an amendment that authorizes the President to arm and train moderate Syrian rebels in the fight against this expansive terrorist network.
Also, the United States has begun air strikes over the hostile area.
As the situation continues, I would like to hear from you.
Please take a moment to
fill out my survey
and let me know your thoughts on how we should combat the situation in the Middle East.
To hear more of my thoughts on what is going on in the Middle East you can
watch a video
from my #AskSteve series that answers a constituents question regarding my thoughts on combating this terrorist group.
