Dear David,
From the bottom of my heart, I want to extend an early
thank you.
Over the last two years, we&rsquo;ve built one of the strongest grassroots campaigns in the country. In fact, just yesterday we passed
$1 million raised online !
That&rsquo;s record-breaking for a House campaign ( and more than many Senate campaigns! ).
Together, more than 28,000 individuals from Illinois and around the country chipped in more than 54,000 times. David, I can&rsquo;t say thank you enough.
But we&rsquo;re not done yet. We&rsquo;ve got 48 hours to go, and our race stands in a dead heat. So David, I&rsquo;m asking one more time:
Will you pitch in today and help us finish strong? I&rsquo;ve never needed your more. If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
As always -- thank you.
Brad Schneider
P.S. If you&rsquo;ve already given, we could really use your help again. If not, it&rsquo;s not too late to make your first contribution.
Chip in here.
Are you in Illinois? Come volunteer for Brad! It&rsquo;s easy, it&rsquo;s fun, and we&rsquo;ll give you everything you need to get started.
