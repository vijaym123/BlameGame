Blocking
Amnesty
Last Thursday,
I voted
to keep Presdient Obama from overstepping his constitutional boundaries
to grant executive amnesty.
The Preventing Executive Overreach
on Immigration Act of 2014 reaffirms that the President does not have
the authority to exempt whole categories of persons illegally in the
U.S. from deportation.
The President's decision to ignore
our laws and grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants threatens
our system of government.
I will continue to work to stop the
President from lawlessly granting
amnesty.
Protecting Small Businesses
Recently, I joined Congressman Steven Palazzo (R-MS) to send a
letter
to the House Appropriations Committee requesting
they withhold funding that would be used to issue a new Flood Risk
Management Standard (FFRMS), or Presidential Executive Order to change
the standard.
We also requested that any funding provided in
previous appropriations bill not be used to implement that
standard.
The FFRMS would change the Floodplain Management Guidelines to
account for uncertainties associated with climate change.
This
would be used as the basis for identifying future flood risk when making
major investment decisions, potentially heightening compliance costs
for many property and small business owners.
If the President is
going to act alone to change the flood risk standard by executive
order, then Congress needs to keep the President from
acting.
Serving Louisiana
It
has been an honor to serve you in the House of Representatives.
From reforming flood insurance to helping veterans, we have achieved
much in the last six years.
I look forward to
serving you in the future.
I wish you and your family Happy Holidays
and a joyful New Year!
