ISSUES AND LEGISLATION
December 21, 2014
From My Family To Yours, Merry
Christmas! :
Our nation is faced with many challenges, but this time
of year we turn our focus to the holidays and spending time with
family, friends, and loved ones. I ask that you please remember and thank
the members of our armed services who are away from their families
this holiday season as they sacrifice to protect our way of life. Safe
travels, and Merry Christmas!
Lawrence Town
Hall Meeting :
Thank you to everyone who
attended my town hall in Lawrence this week. We had a great turnout and
discussed a number of issues including tax reform, the recently passed
appropriations, harmful EPA regulations, the presidents executive
action on immigration reform, and the federal debt.
It
was important to hear all of your concerns as my first priority will
always be to listen to Kansans and get their advice on the important
issues facing our country.

Fully Qualified Offer of Appointment to attend the United States Naval
Academy! I am proud to have nominated Elyjah and wish him well as he

F.W. Huston Medical Center &amp;
My Legislation To Help Rural
Providers :
Thank you to LaMont Cook, CEO of F.W. Huston Medical Center and other
area leaders for visiting with me about rural health and my recent
legislation that was signed into law. H.R. 4067 will delay Medicares
enforcement of unreasonable and inflexible direct supervision rules for
outpatient therapy services at Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) and other
small, rural hospitals in 2014. We also discussed rural education and
other issues that impact Winchester.
ABLE Act Awaiting
President Obamas Signature :
Two weeks ago, the
House of Representatives passed the most significant piece of legislation
impacting disabled Americans in almost 25 years. The ABLE Act will
help individuals with disabilities and their caretakers save more
private funds for medical expenses with the creation of tax-free investment
accounts. I am pleased to report that the legislation also passed with
bipartisan support in the United States Senate, and is on the
Presidents desk awaiting signature.
I wrote an article for the
Disability Rights Center of Kansas about this important legislation, and
how it will expand opportunities for independence and make a
difference in peoples lives.
