Dear Fellow Coloradan,
The Colorado we know today was born from a mining boom that drew thousands of pioneers and entrepreneurs to places like Leadville and Clear Creek with the promise of gold and silver. In fact, the Colorado Capitol's golden dome harkens back to the Centennial State's mining roots. But even as many families benefited from the gold and silver booms, Colorado and the West are littered with stories of pioneers who thought they hit the mother lode and discovered only too late that they instead had found pyrite &mdash; a worthless stone also known as "fool's gold."
Colorado may no longer be the gold and silver hub it was decades ago, but consumers across the state are still faced with modern equivalents of fool's gold. Scammers and fraudsters today troll the Internet preying on Coloradans &mdash; and that&rsquo;s why I have made consumer protection one of my top priorities in Congress. From cracking down on unscrupulous "immigration consultants" to my work to protect consumers' personal information on the health insurance exchanges, I have worked to ensure hardworking Coloradans always have the law on their side.
This
National Consumer Protection Week
offers an opportunity for Coloradans to safeguard their online and financial identities and catch up on the resources available to fight fraud. Here are a few:

I go to work every day fighting to protect Coloradans, including those who have sacrificed for our freedoms. Earlier this month, I urged veterans to use a new website to report schools and other institutions abusing the GI Bill and other federal education benefits. If you know a vet facing issues with an unscrupulous college or university,
please share the new online feedback system with them .
I&rsquo;m also proud of the continued success of my bipartisan legislation to give all Americans greater access to their credit scores. Until my proposal was signed into law in 2010, consumers were forced to pay for the right to see their own credit scores. My common-sense reform helped to level the playing field and ensure Coloradans receive their credit score &mdash; without paying or asking for it &mdash; whenever their score is used against them, such as a denial of credit or higher interest rates. My law boosts transparency in lending and is ensuring Coloradans have better access to the information they need to make informed choices about their finances
I&rsquo;m eager to assist Coloradans anyway I can to protect our communities from fraud and identity theft. Please share these resources with your friends and neighbors and be mindful of people who may try to defraud consumers. Unscrupulous actors may try to take advantage of our high quality of life here in Colorado, but by ensuring our communities have the tools they need to fight back, we will always retain the upper hand.
Warm regards,
Offices
