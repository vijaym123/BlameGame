Nominate Angels in Adoption in Your Community
Growing up, I was fortunate to be part of a close-knit, supportive
family where I learned not only the value of hard work but also the
importance of a nurturing home. Every child deserves these same
opportunities, and selfless foster and adoptive parents are making that
happen every day. As a U.S. Senator, each year, I have the privilege of
honoring an individual, couple, or organization as North Dakota's Angel
in Adoption for those who open their doors and hearts to vulnerable
children.
Angels in Adoption, a program through the Congressional Coalition on
Adoption Institute, highlights leaders among us who support children in
need. Angels can come from all walks, including foster and adoptive
parents, social workers, attorneys, adoptees, physicians, nurses,
teachers, mentors, or child advocates that have made a difference in
children's lives through adoption, foster care, or child welfare
advocacy.
Last year, I was honored to name Courtney and Bobby Williams of
Dickinson as the 2013 Angels in Adoption. In addition to three
biological children, Courtney and Bobby have cared for foster children
for both short and long periods of time, depending on the needs of the
child. They adopted a daughter from the Democratic Republic of Congo,
and last year brought home two brothers from Ethiopia. In addition to
bringing children into their own home, Courtney and Bobby also started
an orphan ministry in their community church for parents of foster and
adopted children.
They are truly changing kids' lives. And I know there are other North
Dakota families also helping children find homes. And I want to hear
about them and recognize them for putting these children ahead of
themselves.
Join me in honoring North Dakotans who are making a difference every
day for children by nominating a compassionate and caring family or
organization in your community. Click here to nominate a North Dakota
Angel in Adoption
. My office
will accept submissions through July 23 and I look forward to hearing
all about North Dakotans nominated for this honor.

Nominate

Your
Community
Growing

I
was
fortunate
to
be
part
of
a
close-knit,
supportive
family
where
I
learned
not
only
the
value
of
hard
work
but
also
the
importance
of
a
nurturing
home.
Every
child
deserves
these
same
opportunities,
and
selfless
foster
and
adoptive
parents
are
making
that
happen
every
day.
As
a
U.S.
Senator,
each
year,
I
have
the
privilege
of
honoring
an
individual,
couple,
or
organization
as
North
Dakota's
Angel
in
Adoption
for
those
who
open
their
doors
and
hearts
to
vulnerable
children.
Angels
in
Adoption,
a
program
through

highlights
leaders
among

who
support
children
in

Angels
can
come

walks,
including
foster

social

attorneys,

advocates
that
have
made
a

in
children's

through
adoption,
foster
care,
or
child
welfare
advocacy.
Last

I
was
honored

as
the
2013

In
