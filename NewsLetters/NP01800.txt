Cutting Red Tape for ND Businesses and Families
Families and businesses all across North Dakota are impacted by federal
regulations - whether it's a farmer trying to understand taxes on farm
equipment or a small business owner having to pay fees and travel costs
to clear employees for work. Regulations are incredibly important in a
number of ways, from keeping the food on our dinner tables safe and
protecting small businesses from fraud to maintaining quality roads for
drivers across the country.
But sometimes these well-meaning regulations don't work the way they're
intended, frustrating consumers and businesses with duplicative,
unnecessary, and even burdensome rules. That's what I want to fix.
Republican Senator James Lankford from Oklahoma and I lead the Senate
subcommittee that oversees the federal regulatory process and last
month, we launched our bipartisan #CutRedTape Initiative
to
help make the federal government work better for families and
businesses.
We created the first central location online where folks from all walks
of life can write in and voice their stories about how federal
regulations are impacting them. This could include difficulties with
properly filing taxes, small business owners working to get their
businesses going, or landowners unsure about existing rules. By
gathering these stories, we can help make the government more effective
and efficient by reducing waste, ending backlogs, and cutting red tape
for families and businesses in North Dakota and across the country.
To make this bipartisan initiative work, we need to hear from folks
like you, sharing with us where these challenges exist. We have a great
opportunity to make a change and improve how our federal government
works for people throughout the country, and I hope you'll join me in
this commonsense effort.
Click here to learn more about our new #CutRedTape Initiative, how to
get engaged, and submit a story
Working together, we can make sure federal regulations work as intended
and best serve North Dakota families and businesses. With your help, I
will keep up that fight.
