This week marked the 4th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act. After a difficult start, enrollment in the health insurance marketplace is increasing and despite claims by the other side, the Affordable Care Act is working. The benefits are real and can be seen in Illinois and across the country.
Six million Americans have enrolled in a private health insurance plan since October 1. Over 9 million have been determined eligible for Medicaid or CHIP. Close to 30% of those enrolled are young adults. In Illinois, more than 323,000 people now have health insurance. Over 113,000 people purchased a plan through the Illinois marketplace and roughly 125,000 young adults have been able to join their parents plan. Americans can no longer be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition like cancer or asthma. Simply put, the Affordable Care Act is working.
Just ask Illinois small business owner Laurel Taylor. Because she and her husband only have two employees and one of their children has asthma, the policies they were sold in the past were very expensive. Now, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, Laurel&rsquo;s business will save 20% on health care costs and her 22 year old son with asthma can stay on her plan.
If you haven&rsquo;t signed up for coverage yet, there&rsquo;s very little time left. The deadline to enroll for 2014 is
