Lamborn, Forbes Praise Revision of Air
Force Policy
11/13/14
Representatives Doug Lamborn
(CO-05) and J. Randy Forbes (VA-04) issued the following
statement in response to an announcement from the United States Air Force
that they have revised Air Force Instruction
1-1:
The Air Forces new
policy more clearly reflects the priority of religious freedom in our
Constitution and in the conscience protections for servicemembers and
chaplains that Congress passed in the National Defense Authorization
Act. Whereas the old language was misleading and confusing for Commanders
to apply, these revisions point to well-established standards for
protecting religious expression. We are grateful to General Welsh and
Chaplain Stendahl for their leadership in revising this policy, and hope
that this new language will better aid commanders in maintaining the
high standard that our Nation has always had for protecting freedom of
religion for our men and women in
uniform.
Background

The Lamborn amendment was added to the FY2015 National Defense
Authorization Act (H.R. 4435) during debate on the House floor in May of
this year. The amendment, section 528, requires the Air Force to revise
Air Force Instruction (AFI) 1-1. The previous version of AFI 1-1
included language restricting the religious expression of
Airmen.
2.11. Free Exercise of Religion and Religious Accommodation. Every Airman
is free to
practice the religion of their choice or subscribe to no religious belief at
all. You should
confidently practice your own beliefs while respecting others whose
viewpoints differ from your
own. Every Airman also has the right to individual expressions
of sincerely held beliefs, to AFI1-1 7 AUGUST 2012
19
include conscience, moral principles or
religious beliefs, unless those expressions would have
an
adverse impact on military
readiness, unit cohesion, good order, discipline, health and safety,
or
mission
accomplishment.
2.11.1. Your right to practice your religious beliefs does not
excuse you from complying
with directives, instructions and lawful orders; however, you may
request religious
accommodation. Commanders and supervisors at all levels must fairly
consider requests for
religious accommodation. Airmen requesting accommodation will continue to
comply with
directives, instructions and lawful orders from which they are requesting
accommodation
unless and until the request is
approved.
2.11.2. If it is necessary to
deny free exercise of religion or an accommodation request,
the
decision must be based on
the facts presented, must directly relate to the
compelling
government interest of
military readiness, unit cohesion, good order, discipline, health
and
safety, or mission
accomplishment, and must be by the least restrictive means necessary
to
avoid the cited
adverse
impact.
2.12. Balance of Free Exercise of Religion and
Establishment Clause. Leaders at all
levels
must balance constitutional protections for their own
free exercise of religion,
including
individual expressions of religious beliefs, and the
constitutional prohibition
against
governmental establishment of religion. They must
ensure their words and actions
cannot
reasonably be construed to be officially endorsing or
disapproving of, or extending
preferential
treatment for any faith, belief, or absence
of belief.
