Dear Friend-
On Tuesday the President delivered his State of the Union address
before a joint session of Congress. My main takeaways from the speech
are as follows:
1. Health Care. I was disappointed at how dismissive the President was
about those of us who are critics of ObamaCare. Millions of Americans
are chafing under higher health insurance premiums, millions have lost
their insurance, and millions are losing access to their preferred
doctors -- despite the President's repeated promises to the contrary.
To suggest that these Americans do not deserve to have their voices
heard in this debate is absurd. As much as the President would like to
distract from these problems, the fact remains that the law was passed
on false pretenses and Americans are increasingly becoming painfully
aware that they have been sold a bill of goods. Congress needs to get
to work protecting people from the harmful effects of this law,
including protecting taxpayers from being forced to bail out insurance
companies (which is actually required under ObamaCare).
2. The Economy. The President delivered a contradictory message
regarding the economy: he claimed his policies are working and that the
economy is healthy yet he proposed a flurry of government spending
initiatives that belied his claims. To me, I think our nation still has
some serious economic challenges. First, for those at the bottom of the
income ladder, government policies tend to trap people in their current
circumstances and do not incentivize upward mobility. Government's role
is necessarily limited in this area -- and a range of cultural factors
are surely critical -- but at a minimum policies at the federal, state,
and local level should reward those seeking to get ahead. Second, many
middle class families are able to get by, but they have little margin
for error -- largely because they face high costs for health care,
energy, and higher education. There are a number of simple reforms --
replace ObamaCare, expand domestic energy production, and reforming
college accreditation to lower tuition costs -- Congress can make to
help in this regard. Unfortunately, the President's proposals --
doubling down on ObamaCare, supporting cap-and-trade, and rewarding
colleges for raising tuition -- will only exacerbate these problems.
Finally, the growth of the scope and power of the federal government
has created a system of artificial privilege in which those businesses
which are politically connected in Washington get policy twisted in
their favor at the expense of would-be competitors and consumers. Given
this state of affairs, it is no accident that 6 of the 10 wealthiest
counties in the entire country are in the Washington, DC metropolitan
area. Congress should pass welfare reform and should start with
corporate welfare reform.
3. Foreign Affairs. During the 2012 presidential campaign the President
used to brag about he "decimated" Al Qaeda; now he says he has degraded
the "core" leadership of Al Qaeda, which is an attempt to redefine
success given the dramatic expansion of Al Qaeda fighters throughout
the Middle East and North Africa. The bottom line is that Al Qaeda has
a larger footprint today than at any time since 9/11/2001. Also, the
President pledged to veto additional sanctions against Iran even though
these sanctions are supported by huge bipartisan majorities in both
houses of Congress. Iran is likely to construe the relaxation of
sanctions as a sign of weakness, and will likely be emboldened to
continue the pursuit of nuclear weapons.
Finally, I have been a frequent critic of the President for failing to
"take care that the laws be faithfully executed" as is required by the
Constitution. Some have sought to justify the President's actions by
citing the record of previous presidents and the number of executive
orders they have issued (which for recent presidents has been more than
those issued by Obama). The problem with this is not the number of
executive orders issued; it is whether the executive actions are proper
in the first place. An executive order can legitimately be issued
vis-a-vis the operations of the executive branch, but the executive
cannot issue edicts that apply to the public at large without any basis
in law and cannot alter or suspend laws already enacted.
On Wednesday, Sen. Mike Lee questioned Attorney General Eric Holder
about the constitutional basis for President Obama's recent actions.
Holder's responses were insufficient. Watch here.
This week, I introduced the Faithful Execution of the Law Act, which
would expand current law by requiring executive branch officials to
inform Congress when an executive branch official refuses to enforce a
federal statute, whether it be for constitutional reasons or policy
reasons.
Under current law the Attorney General is required to inform
Congress when the executive branch stops enforcing a law due to
constitutional concerns.
As can be seen from Holder's answers, more
transparency is needed in this regard.

hesitate to contact either my Washington, DC or Port Orange office

Dear
Friend&#8211;
On
Tuesday
the
President
delivered
his
State
of
the
Union
address
before
a
joint
session
of
Congress. My
main
takeaways
from
the
speech
are
as
follows:
1.
Health
Care.
I
was
disappointed
at
how
dismissive
the
President
was
about
those
of
us
who
are
critics
of
ObamaCare. Millions
of
Americans
are
chafing
under
higher
health
insurance
premiums,
millions
have
lost
their
insurance,
and
millions
are
losing
access
to
their
preferred
doctors
--
despite
the
President's
repeated
promises
to
the
contrary. To
suggest
that
these
Americans
do
not
deserve
to
have
their
voices
heard
in
this
debate
is
absurd. As
much
as
the
President
would
like
to
distract
from
these
problems,
the
fact
remains
that
the
law
was
passed
on
false
pretenses
and
Americans
are
increasingly
becoming
painfully
aware
that
they
have
been
sold
a
bill
of
goods. Congress
needs
to
get
to
work
protecting
people
from
the
harmful
effects
of
this
law,
including
protecting
taxpayers
from
being
forced
to
bail
out
insurance
companies
(which
is
actually
required
under
ObamaCare).
2.
The
Economy.
The
President
delivered
a
contradictory
message
regarding
the
economy:
he
claimed
his
policies
are
working
and
that
the
economy
is
healthy
yet
he
proposed
a
flurry
of
government
spending
initiatives
that
belied
his
claims. To
me,
I
think
our
nation
still
has
some
serious
economic
challenges. First,
for
those
at
the
bottom
of
the
income
ladder,
government
policies
tend
to
trap
people
in
their
current
circumstances
and
do
not
incentivize
upward
mobility. Government's
role
is
necessarily
limited
in
this
area
--
and
a
range
of
cultural
factors
are
surely
critical
--
but
at
a
minimum
policies
at
the
federal,
state,
and
local
level
should
reward
those
seeking
to
get
ahead. Second,
many
middle
class
families
are
able
to
get
by,
but
they
have
little
margin
for
error
--
largely
because
they
face
high
costs
for
health
care,
energy,
and
higher
education. There
are
a
number
of
simple
reforms --
replace
ObamaCare,
expand
domestic
energy
production,
and
reforming
college
accreditation
to
lower
tuition
costs
--
Congress
can
make
to
help
in
this
regard. Unfortunately,
the
President's
proposals
--
doubling
down
on
ObamaCare,
supporting
cap-and-trade,
and
rewarding
colleges
for
raising
tuition
--
will
only
exacerbate
these
problems. Finally,
the
growth
of
the
scope
and
power
of
the
federal
government
has
created
a
system
of
artificial
privilege
in
which
those
businesses
which
are
politically
connected
in
Washington
get
policy
twisted
in
their
favor
at
the
expense
of
would-be
competitors
and
consumers. Given
this
state
of
affairs,
it
is
no
accident
that
6
of
the
10
wealthiest
counties
in
the
entire
country
are
in
the
Washington,
DC
metropolitan
area. Congress
should
pass
welfare
reform
and
should
start
with
corporate
welfare
reform.
3.
Foreign
Affairs.
During
the
2012
presidential
campaign
the
President
used
to
brag
about
he
"decimated"
Al
Qaeda;
now
he
says
he
has
degraded
the
"core"
leadership
of
Al
Qaeda,
which
is
an
attempt
to
redefine
success
given
the
dramatic
expansion
of
Al
Qaeda
fighters
throughout
the
Middle
East
and
North
Africa. The
bottom
line
is
that
Al
Qaeda
has
a
larger
footprint
today
than
at
any
time
since
9/11/2001. Also,
the
President
pledged
to
veto
additional
sanctions
against
Iran
even
though
these
sanctions
are
supported
by
huge
bipartisan
majorities
in
both
houses
of
Congress. Iran
is
likely
to
construe
the
relaxation
of
sanctions
as
a
sign
of
weakness,
and
will
likely
be
emboldened
to
continue
the
pursuit
of
nuclear
weapons.
Finally,
I
have
been
a
frequent
critic
of
the
President
for
failing
to
"take
care
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
executed"
as
is
required
by
the
Constitution. Some
have
sought
to
justify
the
President's
actions
by
citing
the
record
of
previous
presidents
and
the
number
of
executive
orders
they
have
issued
(which
for
recent
presidents
has
been
more
than
those
issued
by
Obama). The
problem
with
this
is
not
the
number
of
executive
orders
issued;
it
is
whether
the
executive
actions
are
proper
in
the
first
place. An
executive
order
can
legitimately
be
issued
vis-a-vis
the
operations
of
the
executive
branch,
but
the
executive
cannot
issue
edicts
that
apply
to
the
public
at
large
without
any
basis
in
law
and
cannot
alter
or
suspend
laws
already
enacted.
On
Wednesday,
Sen.
Mike
Lee
questioned
Attorney
General
Eric
Holder
about
the
constitutional
basis
for
President
Obama's
recent
actions. Holder's
responses
were
insufficient.
Watch
here.
This
week,
I
introduced
the
Faithful
Execution
of
the
Law
Act,
which
would
expand
current
law
by
requiring
executive
branch
officials
to
inform
Congress
when
an
executive
branch
official
refuses
to
enforce
a
federal
statute,
whether
it
be
for
constitutional
reasons
or
policy
reasons.
Under
current
law
the
Attorney
General
is
required
to
inform
Congress
when
the
executive
branch
stops
enforcing
a
law
due
to
constitutional
concerns.
As
can
be
seen
from
Holder's
answers,
more
transparency
is
needed
in
this
regard.
