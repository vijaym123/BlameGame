David, I know what it&rsquo;s like to lose an election. Way back in 1976, I lost my first campaign for office.
Sure, I&rsquo;ve gotten over it -- but I don't want the same thing to happen to my close friend, and colleague Cheri Bustos.
Cheri won her first race in 2012, but a right-wing Super PAC is spending big in Illinois&rsquo; 17th district to put her Tea Party opponent back in Congress.
We&rsquo;ve got to help Cheri get out the facts to Illinois voters
-- before the right-wing lies take hold. So David, will you join me today in supporting Cheri&rsquo;s campaign? Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks,
Dick Durbin
P.S. I&rsquo;ve known Cheri for a long time. So this one&rsquo;s personal for me.
Chip in $5 or more to help keep my friend Cheri fighting for Illinois &gt;&gt;
Paid for by Friends of Cheri Bustos
