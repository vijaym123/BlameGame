Christensen Recess in Review
May 10 to May 16
With the Congress in Recess, Congresswoman Christensen worked in the Virgin Islands this past week, attending an Eagle Scout ceremony on St. Croix and a Mothers Day Luncheon on St. Thomas over the weekend. She gave remarks at the VI-EPSCOR Conference on St. Thomas and met with the U.S. Post Office District Manager for the Caribbean.
On Tuesday, she attended the groundbreaking of the solar power generation plant on St. Thomas. On Friday, she attended a ceremony honoring students who have been accepted to the military academies.
Attends Ceremony Honoring Eagle Scout Andrew Peacock
Andrew Peacock of Troop 7227 in St. Croix achieved the Boy Scouts of Americas highest honor, the Eagle Scout Award, and was honored at a special court of honor with Delegate to Congress Donna M. Christensen attending on Saturday, May 10, 2014 at the St. Croix Country Club. "In a world filled with distractions, the task of guiding the youth of today down the right path is a challenging one," said Christensen. "It warms my heart and gives me hope to see dedicated, focused and promising young people, such as Andrew, achieving success."
The Boy Scouts of Americas highest honor is reserved for a very small percentage of Boy Scouts and to be counted among this elite group is truly an honor. Andrew, a sophomore at Good Hope Country Day School, has distinguished himself by completing extensive community service, including a major project to resurface the floor of the St. Croix Animal Welfare Center intake-treatment room. Andrew has also served his troop in various leadership roles and participated in several Boy Scout events abroad and worked summers as a lifeguard. He proudly earned the 21 required merit badges to achieve the Eagle Scout honor. Scoutmaster Toby Tobias said within Troop 7227 of St. Croix, 12 Eagle Scouts have preceded Andrew and they hope that this will serve as a goal and incentive for the younger Boy Scouts. "I proudly extend congratulations to Andrews family, teachers and Scout leaders," said Christensen. "He is fortunate to have a loving, caring support group and wonderful leaders to guide him down the scouting trail. Andrews incredible success is also yours!"

Appropriations Bill With Caribbean Law Enforcement Language Moves Forward
Congresswoman Christensen announced that the House Appropriations Committee has approved the Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations bill for FY 2015 and it includes language to direct the U.S. Attorney General to assess whether the level of law enforcement personnel and resources from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands is sufficient.
It also directs DOJ to identify resources necessary to fill identified federal law enforcement gaps in the Caribbean island territories. Congresswoman Christensen and Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi have pressed federal officials to assign more assets to address the increase in crime, in particular, drug trafficking and violence in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. With the Caribbean Border Strategy about to be released and the strong possibility of increased federal funding to help us combat crime, I believe that the federal government is taking the situation in the islands more seriously and we will get more help, said Congresswoman Christensen. She thanked Pierluisi and Congressman Jose Serrano for their continued leadership and assistance on this issue.

Announces CBC Spouses Essay Contest
Congresswoman Christensen is pleased to announce that the Congressional Black Caucus Spouses (CBC Spouses) is inviting qualified Virgin Islands students to participate in their Annual Essay Contest and Issue Forum. Virgin Islands students have won this contest for the last three years, including last years winner, Chasen Richards of the St. Croix Educational Complex, said Congresswoman Christensen. I am encouraging our students to participate in this contest once again.
This contest is open to high school sophomores and juniors. Students are presented with a topic that embodies some of our communities most pressing issues and are asked to write an essay to defend their research, analyses and opinion. Submissions are judged by a special committee of CBC Spouses.
Winners and their families are invited to Washington, DC in September to present their essays and participate in a panel discussion during the Congressional Black Caucus Foundations Annual Legislative Conference (CBCF-ALC). There are also monetary prizes for the first, second and third place winners. This year the topic will focus specifically on cyberbullying, which has become more prevalent in recent years. Students are invited to submit an original essay OR a video essay on the topic.
The essay guidelines are as follows:
All participants must be in their sophomore or junior year of high school.
Essays should be original compositions; no less than 750 words, or no more than 1000 words with evidence that supports their findings.
All essays must include the essay contest cover sheet, and have both the student and his/her guidance counselors signature.
All video and written essays must be submitted online by Tuesday, June 10, 2014.
Winners will be selected on or before Friday, August 1, 2014. Winners and runners-up will receive airfare and hotel accommodations to and from Washington DC to attend a congratulatory luncheon and the issue forum that follows.
The Essay Contest Topic is as follows:
Last year alone, more than one million children were harassed, threatened or subjected to other forms of cyberbullying on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. Students as young as 3rd grade report seeing frequent bullying online. The psychological and emotional results of cyberbullying are similar to those of real life bullying. The difference is real life bullying often ends when the school day ends. For children subjected to cyberbullying, there is no escape.
ESSAY QUESTION:
Access to the internet and other forms of technology offer bullies increasing security and seemingly limitless tools to harass their victims through varying mediums. What can schools, parents and most importantly young people do to raise awareness and put a stop to cyberbullying?
Essays can be submitted at the following website: https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form?EQBCT=bee0cc08c51d4c668ead1b634264a285. For more information, please contact Tracye C. Flowers at (202) 263-2840 or visit the Delegates website, www.donnachristensen.house.gov/ .
Gave Remarks at VI-EPSCOR Conference on St. Thomas
Congresswoman Christensen who serves at the Vice-Chair of the Governing Committee of VI-EPSCOR, the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competition in Research under the National Science Foundation gave remarks at its St. Thomas Conference.
She told the group that in collaboration with partners they should pursue increased research and education capacity to meet their goals of increasing competitiveness, strengthen school curriculums, better inform residents, preserve cultural traditions and develop efficient ways to use and produce electricity.
Here in the Virgin Islands, I am confident that we can rely on our own EPSCoR program to serve as a much needed vehicle to connect higher education to the business community and local government, she said. By working with our brothers and sisters in neighboring Caribbean islands, I know that we will only be even more successful in mitigating far reaching ails like the invasive lionfish, or understanding corals or climate change.
Attends Service Academy Appointment Ceremony at Good Hope Country Day School
Congresswoman Christensen attended the recognition ceremony of three Good Hope Country Day School seniors who have received fully qualified offers of appointment to United States Service Academies on Friday. The three students are:
Alex Lewit
U.S. Air Force Academy
Joseph Lanclos
U.S. Air Force Academy Prep School
Harry Hoffman
U.S. Coast Guard Academy
Congresswoman Christensen granted these three young men congressional nominations. Earning an appointment to the Class of 2018 at a U.S. Service Academy is an outstanding accomplishment and a rare honor. Each Congressional representative is allotted nomination slots to four of the five service academies. The U.S. Coast Guard Academy does not require a nomination; however, Hoffman was nominated by Christensen for the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. Graduates of the academies receive a Bachelor of Science degree from a choice of fields and the military rank of Second Lieutenant or Ensign and must serve a minimum term of duty. The Air Force Academy Prep School is a 10-month academic program that is rigorous and specially designed to transition students from a high-school academic environment to the world-class collegiate academic program at the Academy. Upon successful completion, the cadet will earn a full appointment to the Air Force Academy. To become eligible for a nomination to the service academies, applicants must be domiciled in the Virgin Islands. Applicants must be at least 17 years old, but not have passed their 23rd birthday. They must be a U.S. citizen, unmarried, not pregnant and have no legal obligation to support children or other dependants. Applicants should also have SAT scores in the 600s for verbal and math.
