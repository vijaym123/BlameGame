Dear David,
Can you believe this? The
so-called "architect" of the president's health care law recently
claimed
that "the stupidity of the American voter" was
"critical" for the administration to hide the true cost of
ObamaCare.
"Stupidity?"
Contrary to what the Obama Administration believes, Missourians are
not "stupid."
We know that ObamaCare is bad for
our families. In fact, our state was the first in the nation to go to
the ballot box and
reject
ObamaCare from the
start. We know it has led to skyrocketing premiums, canceled coverage,
fewer doctors, and devastating job losses.
Over the course of
the year following the disastrous launch of the ObamaCare exchanges,
I went to the Senate floor almost every week to
share
updates and stories from Missourians impacted by the
law.
These people are not stupid. They're rightly concerned about this
flawed law, which should be repealed and replaced with
common-sense health care solutions .
As always, I hope you'll join this important
discussion online by sharing your thoughts and concerns on my
Facebook
page, on
Twitter , or on
Instagram .
Sincere regards,
Washington D.C.
