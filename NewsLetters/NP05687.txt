Nations
Largest Industrial Trade Association Says Congressman Lamborn is a
Champion of Manufacturing
10/10/14
The
National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) has awarded Congressman Doug
Lamborn the NAM Award for Manufacturing Legislative Excellence. The award
is based on his votes in the 113th Congress on issues that are
critical to manufacturing in the United
States.
Manufacturers in Colorado
and throughout the United States are making a comeback, creating
jobs, making more products and making them better than ever before, said
NAM Senior Vice President of Policy and Government Relations Aric
Newhouse. However, manufacturers are often disproportionately impacted by
decisions made by policymakers in Washington. The NAM is proud to
stand with lawmakers like Congressman Lamborn who understand what is at
stake and seek to implement policies that will foster innovation,
growth and
competitiveness.
Key Votes included in the Voting Record are
selected by small, medium and large manufacturing executives who serve
on the NAMs Key Vote Advisory Committee. Additional information on
the NAM Award for Manufacturing Legislative Excellence can be

-NAM-
The National Association of
Manufacturers (NAM) is the largest manufacturing association in the United
States, representing small and large manufacturers in every industrial
sector and in all 50 states. Manufacturing employs more than 12 million
men and women, contributes $2.08 trillion to the U.S. economy
annually, has the largest economic impact of any major sector and accounts
for two-thirds of private-sector research and development. The NAM is
the powerful voice of the manufacturing community and the leading
advocate for a policy agenda that helps manufacturers compete in the global
economy and create jobs across the United States. For more information
