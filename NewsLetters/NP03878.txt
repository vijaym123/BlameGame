December 17, 2014
Dear David,
I'm writing to you today to share the good news that a
decades-long quest to see that an Albany native and WWI hero receives his
due recognition is now in its home stretch. This month, the House
passed the
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015
(H.R. 3979), which includes language that allows the President to
award Sgt. Henry Johnson the Medal of Honor for his acts of incredible
bravery during World War I.
if you're from
Albany, you know Sgt. Johnson's story. The superhuman acts of valor
demonstrated in defense of our nation and his fellow soldiers is a great
source of pride for our community, and for almost a century these
acts have gone unrecognized. We have jumped a very large hurdle toward
appropriately honoring this American
hero.
I have followed Henry's story since long before becoming a Member of
Congress and have worked hard to make sure his story is heard by
others. I thank the many individuals who never gave up on our tireless
efforts to accomplish this goal, including Sgt. Johnson's relatives,
Senator Schumer, and my predecessor, Mike McNulty. This was a decades-long
team effort across the board, and I could not be happier to see our
efforts pay off.
This legislation is now
expected to be signed into law by the President. After that, he will have
the authority to officially award Sgt. Johnson the Medal of Honor.
Unless a waiver is passed by Congress, service members who exhibit
extreme valor in combat can only be awarded the Medal of Honor if their
acts occurred in the previous five
years.
Please join me in pausing to honor and remember Sgt. Johnson and his
fellow soldiers who have made our nation secure and our communities proud
through acts of bravery both seen and
unseen.
Thank you for reading. If I can ever be of help, please don't
hesitate to call or write. My door is always open.
WWI
hero and Albany native, Sgt. Henry
Johnson
