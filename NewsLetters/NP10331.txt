Latest US Aid Package
to Ukraine Little More than a Fig Leaf
The Obama
Administration has belatedly agreed to send further aid to Ukraine,
in a purported effort to deter further Russian violations of that
countrys sovereignty.
The assistance, though welcome, adds virtually
nothing to Ukraines ability to defend itself from Russian aggression
because it is non-lethal.
It gives the appearance of help, but
provides very little of what Ukraine really needs.
The
President has yet to act on my
request
to declare
Ukraine as Major Non-NATO Ally, which would make American military
equipment and training available to Ukraine.
Such a declaration would
also show President Putin that the United States is standing with
Ukraine as it struggles to maintain its hard-won independence and
freedom.

Time
Magazine:
Obamas Foreign Policy Failures Are Proving His
Critics Right
Less than 15 months ago, on the day
President Obama was sworn in for his second term,
Time
magazines Michael Crowley, wrote that, [F]our
years ago [2009] Obama must have felt like he was diving into the
presidential waters wearing a suit of armor; his most urgent priority was
simply not to drown. This time it should be much easier to actually
swim.
Apparently not.
In recounting the recent failures
in the Obama Administrations foreign policy, Crowley now
concludes
that, the recent disappointments in his foreign
policy are part of a larger failure
a failure of political
vision.
Crippling Defense Cuts Ahead If Sequestration
Remains
Unless the President works with Congress
to end the budgetary practice of sequestration (automatic, mindless,
across-the-board spending cuts that dont require Congressional
approval), in October of next year the defense budget will take a severe
hit, compromising our ability to defend our national interests in even
one hot spot around the globe.
Sequestration would reduce
our military to little more than a paper tiger, gutting the Army,
Navy, Air Force, and Marines to levels not seen since before World War
II.
The two articles below detail the extent of the damage if the
President does not work with Congress to end
sequestration.

Yet Another Phony Excuse to Delay
for the Keystone Pipeline
The White House seems to
have a bottomless pit of
excuses
to justify
delaying the construction of the Keystone Pipeline.
Its latest
excuse is so phony that even one of President Obamas staunchest allies,
the president of the Laborers' International Union of North America,
Terry O'Sullivan, has called it another low blow to the working men and
women of our country for whom the Keystone XL Pipeline is a lifeline
to good jobs and energy security."
Its long past time to
authorize construction of the Keystone Pipeline to strengthen our
energy security and create much needed jobs in
America.
More Obamacare Surprises Lurking
The
Wall Street Journal
this week
exposed
yet another hidden menace in the Affordable Care Act.
This one could likely lead to the rationing of care to 50 million
Medicare and Medicaid patients.
The innocuously named
Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation is supposedly designed to
make payment systems and models of care more innovative and
efficient.
But as the authors argue, innovation in health-care
delivery is necessary and can happen with reforms promoting deregulation and
more intensive competition. What we don't need is more bureaucratic
micromanagement cloaked under the mantle of
innovation.
Picatinny Arsenal: A Soldiers
and a Dogs
Best
Friend
Picatinny Arsenal has been developing cutting edge
weaponry for Americas armed forces for a hundred years.
The
technological advances that have come out of Picatinnys more than 50 labs have
helped win victories on the battlefield and protected the lives of
our nations defenders all over the world.
Since Vietnam,
warriors of the canine variety have been a part of our military,
performing such jobs as patrolling and explosive detection.
Because they
have been called to duty in places that experience extremes in
weather and temperature, Picatinny has helped develop kennels that will keep
the dogs far more comfortable and better able to carry out their
unique mission.
This recent article on
nj.com
gives the details:
Salute: Dr. Helen Streubert
Inaugurated President of the College of St.
Elizabeth
I was honored to attend earlier today the inauguration of Dr.
Helen Steubert as the seventh president of the College of St.
Elizabeth.
Dr. Streubert is the first lay person to serve as president of
St. Elizabeths in its 114-year history.
Her emotional inaugural
address was an inspiring call to academic excellence.
She came
to St. Elizabeths from Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio,
Texas.
I am delighted that she is not only a new and dynamic
leader in the 11 th
Congressional Districts outstanding
higher education community, but is also a new constituent.

Salute: Chatham High School
One of New Jerseys Best High
Schools
The 11 th
Congressional District
has some of the best public schools in the state.
Ive visited
hundreds of them over the years and find them all impressive
institutions of learning and achievement.
Earlier this week,
however, one of our schools
Chatham High School
was
named
by
U.S. News and World Report
as one of the top 10
high schools in New Jersey.
I salute everyone associated
with Chatham High School
administration, faculty, staff, parents
and students
for earning this recognition.
Salute:
the Lake Hopatcong Foundation
As the weather
begins to warm and we think about spending more time outdoors, I salute the
members of the Lake Hopatcong Foundation, who are off to a great
start in advancing their vision for the future of this beautiful
lake.
I recently met with leaders of the Foundation to discuss their
exciting vision for protecting and promoting Lake Hopatcong, one of
New Jersey's greatest natural resources.
Lake Hopatcong is the
largest freshwater body in our state, and is one of the most beautiful
spots in the New Jersey Highlands.
The Lake Hopatcong
Foundation was founded a little more than two years ago.
It stands as
a testimony to the difference a concerned group of citizens can make
when they come together in a common cause.
To learn more about
the good work the Foundation is doing visit:
