David --
I don&rsquo;t like emailing this late on a Friday, but we&rsquo;re all still at the office. Why? There&rsquo;s only 102 days to go until the election.
Believe it or not, we&rsquo;re already finalizing our budget for the Fall.
Earlier this month, we learned that Brad's opponent, Republican Bob Dold, put up his biggest fundraising quarter yet, raising over $600,000. Worse yet, we still have some major gaps in Brad&rsquo;s budget.
We&rsquo;re not panicking, but with just hours to go before our weekly budget deadline, we&rsquo;re running a deficit of $2,400. It may not sound like much, but if we don&rsquo;t close the gap, we&rsquo;ll need to start cutting back on critical programs. David, according to our records, you haven&rsquo;t made an online donation to Brad&rsquo;s campaign. So here&rsquo;s my request:
will you chip in and become a Founding Member of Brad&rsquo;s first re-election campaign?
David Johnson Are you a Founding Member?
