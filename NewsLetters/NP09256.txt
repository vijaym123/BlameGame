Dear Friend,
I am proud to announce that on Thursday, June 5th, I will be
hosting an 11th district job fair in conjunction with the Illinois
Department of Employment Security. Job seekers are invited to come and connect
with over 50 area employers currently hiring for available positions.
Veterans will receive advanced entry with a special one hour preview.
Job
seekers who register at

by June 2 will have the opportunity to be individually matched
with area employers. They may also have the opportunity to schedule
on-site interviews.
Consider
forwarding this email or tell your friends and family to
sign up here
to receive updates on the work we're doing in
Washington, DC and at home in Illinois.
Remember I am here to work for you. If you have any questions, or
