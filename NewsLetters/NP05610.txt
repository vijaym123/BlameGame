David -- Today, you received an email from President Obama. Here&rsquo;s why:
We are facing an unprecedented onslaught from Boehner, Karl Rove, and the Koch Brothers right now.
If we don't close this gap before tonight&rsquo;s ad buy deadline, Democrats will be in for heartbreaking losses in November's election.
That&rsquo;s why hitting our goal on tonight&rsquo;s ad buy deadline is so critical. And that&rsquo;s why we need your help to save the day.
We still need 11 Democrats from the 60659 zip
code to step up before tonight&rsquo;s deadline. Can you help out now?
