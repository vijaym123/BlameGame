Dear Friends,
As we approach the holiday season, I want to give you an update on some
important news from Washington.
On Wednesday, the Senate passed the Bipartisan Budget Act, which the
House passed last week and the President will sign into law. This
two-year budget agreement is an important step in the right direction
and provides a framework for a longer term budget solution. I supported
the Bipartisan Budget Act because it addresses sequestration's damaging
cuts and creates some certainty for our middle class families and
businesses across Central New York, but the bill is far from perfect.
One provision I strongly opposed in the bill would have made cuts to
military retirement cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs). These cuts
unfairly single out our military families and could create serious
hardship for some of our veterans. That's why this week I introduced
the Military Retirement Restoration Act, which would repeal the
provision that cuts military retiree pensions. My bill would not add a
penny to the deficit - it achieves the same amount of savings in the
budget by closing tax loopholes for corporations that abuse foreign tax
havens.
The Military Retirement Restoration Act will ensure our military
retirees get the benefits they have earned and deserve. It has strong
support in the House and the Senate, and I am working with members of
both parties and my colleagues on the House Armed Services Committee to
ensure this measure is signed into law.
I'm thankful for the opportunity to serve our active duty servicemen
and women, military families, and veterans across Central New York. I
will keep you updated on our progress, and encourage you to contact my
office to share your thoughts and concerns. As always, it is an honor
to represent you in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Sincerely,
Member of Congress

Dear
Friends,
As
we
approach
the
holiday
season,
I
want
to
give
you
an
update
on
some
important
news
from
Washington.
On
Wednesday,
the
Senate
passed
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act,
which
the
House
passed
last
week
and
the
President
will
sign
into
law.
This
two-year
budget
agreement
is
an
important
step
in
the
right
direction
and
provides
a
framework
for
a
longer
term
budget
solution.
I
supported
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act
because
it
addresses
sequestration&#8217;s
damaging
cuts
and
creates
some
certainty
for
our
middle
class
families
and
businesses
across
Central
New
York,
but
the
bill
is
far
from
perfect.
One
provision
I
strongly
opposed
in
the
bill
would
have
made
cuts
to
military
retirement
cost-of-living
adjustments
(COLAs).
These
cuts
unfairly
single
out
our
military
families
and
could
create
serious
hardship
for
some
of
our
veterans.
That&#8217;s
why
this
week
I
introduced
the
Military
Retirement
Restoration
Act,
which
would
repeal
the
provision
that
cuts
military
retiree
pensions.
My
bill
would
not
add
a
penny
to
the
deficit
&#8211;
it
achieves
the
same
amount
of
savings
in
the
budget
by
closing
tax
loopholes
for
corporations
that
abuse
foreign
tax
havens.
The
Military
Retirement
Restoration
Act
will
ensure
our
military
retirees
get
the
benefits
they
have
earned
and
deserve.
It
has
strong
support
in
the
House
and
the
Senate,
and
I
am
working
with
members
of
both
parties
and
my
colleagues
on
the
House
Armed
Services
Committee
to
ensure
this
measure
is
signed
into
law.
I&#8217;m
thankful
for
the
opportunity
to
serve
our
active
duty
servicemen
and
women,
military
families,
and
veterans
across
Central
New
York.
I
will
keep
you
updated
on
our
progress,
and
encourage
you
to
contact
my
office
to
share
your
thoughts
and
concerns.
As
always,
it
is
an
honor
to
represent
you
in
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives.
Sincerely,
Member
of
Congress
