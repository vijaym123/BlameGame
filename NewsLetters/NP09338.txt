Dear Friend,
This Memorial Day, let
me tell you a story involving 74 sailors lost during the Vietnam War.
If you go to the Vietnam Memorial Wall, you may look for their
names. But you would not find them. And that is also part of the
story.
On June 3, 1969,
shortly after the U.S.S Frank E. Evans had been providing artillery
support in Vietnam, it was cut in half by an Australian aircraft
carrier in the South China Sea.
Much of the ship sank in a matter of
seconds and 74 American sailors lost their lives. The U.S.S Frank E.
Evans was participating in a joint Southeast Asia Treaty Organization
(SEATO) exercise called "Sea Spirit" with more than 40 ships of SEATO
nations, at the time of the collision with HMAS
Melbourne.
Many years later, after the iconic Vietnam War Memorial wall was
unveiled, the family of one sailors lost on that ship -- Thomas Belue Box --
traveled to Washngton, D.C., to see his name on the wall.
Imagine the family's shock and dismay when they found out he was not
there.
Before she passed away, Eunice Sage - who lost three
sons, Gary, Greg and Kelly Jo on the U.S.S Frank E. Evans -- said the
last thing she wanted was her boys to be added to the Wall. She died
never seeing that come true.
While the U.S.S. Frank E. Evans
was not in the combat zone as defined by Executive Order 11216, the
ship was supporting the ongoing military conflict in Vietnam and the
crew was instrumental in advancing American military objectives in
Vietnam. Not to mention, the crew had participated in the conflict just days
before the collision. Vietnam veterans have long argued that
inclusion on the monument should not be determined by geographic location, and
exceptions to this rule have previously been made for service members
killed as part of the conflict but not in Vietnam
itself.
I was
approached years ago by the family of a sailor lost on the ship, and
since then have been pushing the Administration and successive Defense
Secretaries to rectify this situation. After meeting with me in 2010,
Secretary of the Navy Mabus expressed his support for adding the 74
sailors to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.
Ive also been in touch
with previous Defense Department Secretaries Robert Gates and Leon
Panetta, and current Secretary Chuck Hagel.
But this week,
we finally had some good news.
The House of
Representatives has passed an amendment I authored to the annual defense
authorization bill urging Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to add the names of
74 sailors lost on the U.S.S. Frank E. Evans during the Vietnam War to
the Vietnam Wall.
Hopefully this past weeks vote puts us one
step closer to the reality of seeing the names of the Lost 74 on the
Vietnam Wall. They died serving our country during the Vietnam War and
there is no reason to deny these sailors their rightful place on the
memorial.

made on the House Floor , or click below:
While Ive chosen to
remember those sailors lost on the U.S.S Frank E. Evans this Memorial
Day, please take time to remember veterans in your life and community,
and thank them for their service.
All the
best,
Congressman Adam
Schiff
