Fighting to Fix New Hampshire's Roads
Hi All!
I hope you all had a great weekend. Last week, I introduced a bill to
protect funding for our infrastructure and hosted a telephone town hall
with thousands of Granite Staters to hear from you about issues
important to women and families.
Speaking on the floor about my transportation bill
Protecting our Roads in the Granite State
Following my recent tour of the I-93 expansion project in Windham, I
introduced a bill this week to ensure that the Highway Trust Fund
remains solvent for the remainder of the fiscal year. During my tour
of the expansion project, New
Hampshire Department of Transportation officials and local leaders
expressed their concern that should the Highway Trust Fund run dry,
critical transportation projects across the state would be forced to
come to a halt in the middle of the busy summer construction season due
to lack of funding.
This would result not only in a loss of revenue
for the state, but would also put the jobs of hardworking New Hampshire
construction workers in jeopardy.
I introduced the DRIVE Now Act
to help ensure the funding will
still be available for these transportation projects.
Our transportation network is critical to growing our economy, creating
jobs, and ensuring public safety in New Hampshire and all across the
country. If Congress lets the Highway Trust Fund run out of money, then
important projects like the I-93 expansion won't get finished, leaving
commuters in the lurch and hurting both New Hampshire businesses and
the construction workers that rely on this funding for their
livelihoods.
My bill will ensure that these vital projects can
continue in the short-term, and I call on my fellow Members of Congress
to pass a long-term transportation bill to fund the Highway Trust Fund
for the next six years.
Hearing from YOU about Women's Issues
On Wednesday evening, nearly 9,000 Granite Staters participated in a
live telephone town hall I hosted in order to hear directly from Second
District residents about how Congress can level the playing field for
New Hampshire women and their families.
During the town hall I also
discussed my Women's Economic Agenda
, a plan for Congress to help New Hampshire
families succeed financially.
During the call, I took questions from constituents, and heard numerous
stories from male and female Granite Staters concerned about issues
that affect the economic success of New Hampshire families. I was
thrilled to get a chance to hear directly from so many Granite Staters
on this call - both men and women - concerned about a number of the
issues I've prioritized in my Women's Economic Agenda. From concerns
over a fair minimum wage, to unequal pay in the workplace due to gender
discrimination, to the importance of education and job training to
better prepare those entering into the workforce, the stories I heard
on today's call underscore the need for Congress to prioritize
initiatives that will better support the economic success of New
Hampshire women and families.
Increasing Access to Capital for NH Small Businesses
Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed a bill
I helped introduce to increase access to capital for New Hampshire
small businesses and individuals. As a member of the U.S. House Small
Business Committee, supporting New Hampshire small businesses and
helping them access the capital they need to grow is one of my top
priorities. I worked with my Republican colleague, Congressman Blaine
Luetkemeyer (MO-03), to help introduce H.R. 3329 late last year. This
bipartisan bill would make it easier for smaller community banks that
did not cause the 2008 financial crisis to raise capital, making more
money available for loans to New Hampshire small businesses and
consumers.
I've traveled from one end of New Hampshire to another to hear from
small business owners about how the federal government can better
support their job creation efforts. Over and over again, New Hampshire
entrepreneurs have told me that limited access to capital is one of
their greatest obstacles to success. I was proud to reach across the
aisle to work with my Republican colleague from Missouri to help free
up more resources for our country's small businesses, and I applaud my
colleagues in the House for passing this legislation.
Meeting with timber leaders in Lyme
Discussing NH Forests in Lyme
On Monday, I joined local and national leaders from the forestry
community at Wagner Forest Management in Lyme to discuss challenges and
opportunities facing New Hampshire's timber industry and forest
economy. It was great to have the opportunity to hear from so many
different stakeholders on a range of issues that impact our forests,
including National Forest management, forest operations, renewable
energy, and tax code revisions.
As the first member of the House Committee on Agriculture from New
Hampshire in 70 years, it is critical for me to hear from the forestry
community here in New Hampshire.
It was great to learn more about many
of the issues facing the industry from people who have been doing this
all their lives. New Hampshire is the second most forested state in the
country, and this industry is vital to supporting the economy of the
North Country and thousands of jobs for Granite Staters.
Speaking at the Drug Court Graduation
Fighting Drug Abuse Through Rehabilitation
On Monday, I also spoke at a Graduation Ceremony at the Grafton County
Drug Court in North Haverhill, recognizing five drug court participants
who are in the process of completing the program. The Grafton County
Drug Court is a diversionary sentencing program which allows high risk
non-violent offenders to enter a drug rehabilitation program instead of
incarceration. The program combines intensive treatment with strict
supervision, and each participant is evaluated weekly by a
multidisciplinary team of experts.
The dramatic increase in drug abuse in New Hampshire and across the
country is a destructive trend.
These men and women showed amazing
courage to face this challenge head on and beat their addiction. The
Grafton County drug court is a terrific example of why these courts are
so essential to the American judicial process.
Jail time without
treatment is not an effective way to help those who are willing to take
the necessary steps to better their lives, but don't have the resources
to do so on their own.
Have an excellent week and thanks for everything you do to make New
Hampshire such a wonderful place to live!

Fighting
to
Fix
New
Hampshire&#8217;s
Roads
Hi
All!
I
hope
you
all
had
a
great
weekend. Last
week,
I
introduced
a
bill
to
protect
funding
for
our
infrastructure
and
hosted
a
telephone
town
hall
with
thousands
of
Granite
Staters
to
hear
from
you
about
issues
important
to
women
and
families.
Speaking
on
the
floor
about
my
transportation
bill Protecting
our
Roads
in
the
Granite
State
Following
my
recent
tour
of
the
I-93
expansion
project
in
Windham,
I
introduced
a
bill
this
week
to
ensure
that
the
Highway
Trust
Fund
remains
solvent
for
the
remainder
of
the
fiscal
year.
During
my
tour
of
the
expansion
project,
New
Hampshire
Department
of
Transportation
officials
and
local
leaders
expressed
their
concern
that
should
the
Highway
Trust
Fund
run
dry,
critical
transportation
projects
across
the
state
would
be
forced
to
come
to
a
halt
in
the
middle
of
the
busy
summer
construction
season
due
to
lack
of
funding.
This
would
result
not
only
in
a
loss
of
revenue
for
the
state,
but
would
also
put
the
jobs
of
hardworking
New
Hampshire
construction
workers
in
jeopardy.
I
introduced
the
DRIVE
Now
Act
to
help
ensure
the
funding
will
still
be
available
for
these
transportation
projects.
Our
transportation
network
is
critical
to
growing
our
economy,
creating
jobs,
and
ensuring
public
safety
in
New
Hampshire
and
all
across
the
country.
If
Congress
lets
the
Highway
Trust
Fund
run
out
of
money,
then
important
projects
like
the
I-93
expansion
won&#8217;t
get
finished,
leaving
commuters
in
the
lurch
and
hurting
both
New
Hampshire
businesses
and
the
construction
workers
that
rely
on
this
funding
for
their
livelihoods.
My
bill
will
ensure
that
these
vital
projects
can
continue
in
the
short-term,
and
I
call
on
my
fellow
Members
of
Congress
to
pass
a
long-term
transportation
bill
to
fund
the
Highway
Trust
Fund
for
the
next
six
years.
Hearing
from
YOU
about
Women&#8217;s
Issues
On
Wednesday
evening,
nearly
9,000
Granite
Staters
participated
in
a
live
telephone
town
hall
I
hosted
in
order
to
hear
directly
from
Second
District
residents
about
how
Congress
can
level
the
playing
field
for
New
Hampshire
women
and
their
families.
During
the
town
hall
I
also
discussed
my
Women&#8217;s
Economic
Agenda ,
a
plan
for
Congress
to
help
New
Hampshire
families
succeed
financially.
During
the
call,
I
took
questions
from
constituents,
and
heard
numerous
stories
from
male
and
female
Granite
Staters
concerned
about
issues
that
affect
the
economic
success
of
New
Hampshire
families.
I
was
thrilled
to
get
a
chance
to
hear
directly
from
so
many
Granite
Staters
on
this
call
&#8211;
both
men
and
women
&#8211;
concerned
about
a
number
of
the
issues
I&#8217;ve
prioritized
in
my
Women&#8217;s
Economic
Agenda. From
concerns
over
a
fair
minimum
wage,
to
unequal
pay
in
the
workplace
due
to
gender
discrimination,
to
the
importance
of
education
and
job
training
to
better
prepare
those
entering
into
the
workforce,
the
stories
I
heard
on
today&#8217;s
call
underscore
the
need
for
Congress
to
prioritize
initiatives
that
will better
support
the
economic
success
of
New
Hampshire
women
and
families.
Increasing
Access
to
Capital
for
NH
Small
Businesses
Last
week,
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives
unanimously
passed
a
bill
I
helped
introduce
to
increase
access
to
capital
for
New
Hampshire
small
businesses
and
individuals. As
a
member
of
the
U.S.
House
Small
Business
Committee,
supporting
New
Hampshire
small
businesses
and
helping
them
access
the
capital
they
need
to
grow
is
one
of
my
top
priorities.
I
worked
with
my
Republican
colleague,
Congressman
Blaine
Luetkemeyer
(MO-03),
to
help
introduce
H.R.
3329
late
last
year.
This
bipartisan
bill
would
make
it
easier
for
smaller
community
banks
that
did
not
cause
the
2008
financial
crisis
to
raise
capital,
making
more
money
available
for
loans
to
New
Hampshire
small
businesses
and
consumers.
I&#8217;ve
traveled
from
one
end
of
New
Hampshire
to
another
to
hear
from
small
business
owners
about
how
the
federal
government
can
better
support
their
job
creation
efforts.
Over
and
over
again,
New
Hampshire
entrepreneurs
have
told
me
that
limited
access
to
capital
is
one
of
their
greatest
obstacles
to
success. I
was
proud
to
reach
across
the
aisle
to
work
with
my
Republican
colleague
from
Missouri
to
help
free
up
more
resources
for
our
country&#8217;s
small
businesses,
and
I
applaud
my
colleagues
in
the
House
for
passing
this
legislation.
Meeting
with
timber
leaders
in
Lyme Discussing
NH
Forests
in
Lyme
On
Monday,
I
joined
local
and
national
leaders
from
the
forestry
community
at
Wagner
Forest
Management
in
Lyme
to
discuss
challenges
and
opportunities
facing
New
Hampshire&#8217;s
timber
industry
and
forest
economy. It
was
great
to
have
the
opportunity
to
hear
from
so
many
different
stakeholders
on
a
range
of
issues
that
impact
our
forests,
including
National
Forest
management,
forest
operations,
renewable
energy,
and
tax
code
revisions.
As
the
first
member
of
the
House
Committee
on
Agriculture
from
New
Hampshire
in
70
years,
it
is
critical
for
me
to
hear
from
the
forestry
community
here
in
New
Hampshire.
It
was
great
to
learn
more
about
many
of
the
issues
facing
the
industry
from
people
who
have
been
doing
this
all
their
lives. New
Hampshire
is
the
second
most
forested
state
in
the
country,
and
this
industry
is
vital
to
supporting
the
economy
of
the
North
Country
and
thousands
of
jobs
for
Granite
Staters.
Speaking
at
the
Drug
Court
Graduation Fighting
Drug
Abuse
Through
Rehabilitation
On
Monday,
I
also
spoke
at
a
Graduation
Ceremony
at
the
Grafton
County
Drug
Court
in
North
Haverhill,
recognizing
five
drug
court
participants
who
are
in
the
process
of
completing
the
program.
The
Grafton
County
Drug
Court
is
a
diversionary
sentencing
program
which
allows
high
risk
non-violent
offenders
to
enter
a
drug
rehabilitation
program
instead
of
incarceration.
The
program
combines
intensive
treatment
with
strict
supervision,
and
each
participant
is
evaluated
weekly
by
a
multidisciplinary
team
of
experts.
The
dramatic
increase
in
drug
abuse
in
New
Hampshire
and
across
the
country
is
a
destructive
trend.
These
men
and
women
showed
amazing
courage
to
face
this
challenge
head
on
and
beat
their
addiction. The
Grafton
County
drug
court
is
a
terrific
example
of
why
these
courts
are
so
essential
to
the
American
judicial
process.
Jail
time
without
treatment
is
not
an
effective
way
to
help
those
who
are
willing
to
take
the
necessary
steps
to
better
their
lives,
but
don&#8217;t
have
the
resources
to
do
so
on
their
own.
Have
an
excellent
week
and
thanks
for
everything
you
do
to
make
New
Hampshire
such
a
wonderful
place
to
live!
