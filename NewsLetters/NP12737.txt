Last night, I was in
the Capitol listening to President Obamas State of the Union
speech.
The State of the Union is an annual opportunity for the
President to lay his agenda before Congress and create a framework for finding
common ground.
The best way to do that, of course, is to
generate a spirit of mutual trust, demonstrate a commitment to good-faith
negotiations, and indicate a shared understanding of our Constitutional
responsibilities.
Unfortunately, what I heard from
President Obama last night was hostility toward our foundational principles,
condescension toward a co-equal branch of government, and a general
aversion to common sense and bipartisanship.
Specifically, the
President remains committed to a philosophy of trickle-down
government - a view that Americans can only succeed if the government spends
money it does not have on programs that we can ill afford.
This
view has burdened our economy throughout his Administration, prolonged
the recession and is putting America at risk of a fiscal crisis in
the next few years.
The fact that he is threatening Congress
with executive orders if we do not follow his agenda is even more
alarming.
In response, Congress should insist that President Obama
faithfully execute our current laws before trusting him to execute new
laws.
And if he refuses, we must hold him
accountable.
I will continue to be an advocate for a new approach
a
better approach, focused on more freedom, more opportunity, and more
innovation.
I will work in a bipartisan way when possible and
stand on principle when necessary in order to keep my promises to the
people of Idaho.
