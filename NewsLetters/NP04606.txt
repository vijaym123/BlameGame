Friends -- TODAY is the day we&rsquo;ve been working toward. It&#39;s Election Day!
Polls in California are open from 7 AM to 8 PM, and here at Campaign Headquarters, we will be contacting voters all day making sure every voter in Sacramento County casts their ballot. Call us at 916-903-9420 to join us in getting out the vote, either from here at our office or at your own home.
Make sure you get to the polls yourself. If you don&rsquo;t know where your polling place is, don&#39;t worry. All you have to do is

Thanks again for all your hard work, and happy voting!
Be well,
