Exciting Opportunities to
Serve
A new year is just around the corner, and with it
comes exciting opportunities and important challenges for our
community and country. Serving the citizens of Georgias Sixth Congressional
District is truly an honor, and that means being not only a voice for
you in Congress but also providing assistance whenever and wherever my
staff and I can be helpful.
First and foremost, we want to hear from you. That is why I am happy to
report that over the past year our office has had the opportunity to
reply to over 45,000 constituent letters, emails and phone calls. At
the same time, members of our staff have worked on over 1,000 cases
where folks in our community needed assistance with a federal agency on
issues dealing with Social Security, Medicare, Veterans Affairs and much
more. We look forward to continue serving you in these capacities in
the new year, and encourage you to contact our office with any
questions, comments of concerns. You can find all of our contact information
on our website at

We
are also focused on fighting for positive, common sense policies to
achieve real results on behalf of the American people. Much of that will
begin with the budget process set to kick off as soon as the new
Congress convenes in January. As the incoming Chair of the House Budget
Committee, I look forward to working with my colleagues to craft a
budget that will put our nation on sound fiscal footing and support
economic growth. In a recent conversation with the Marietta Daily Journal, I
discussed some of what lies ahead for our
budget:
In the budget, Price
said he hopes to address four key issues: reducing spending, tax reform,
health care and energy independence. ...
...Price said one of his top
priorities for the budget is to make sure it is
balanced.
The debt that we
have
over $18 trillion as a nation
is at a point now where it is
compromising the ability of the economy to grow.
The only way to do
that, to get the debt under control and begin to pay off the debt is
to run a surplus, and that means balancing the budget, Price
said.
The
debt cant continue to grow, Price said, and his budget next year will
lay out a plan for a balanced budget within 10
years.
Its like turning a
huge ocean liner, Price said. You cant turn it on a dime; it takes
time to turn that. And thats why it takes a period of time to get to
balance and then pay of the debt, or get on a path to pay off the
debt.

care, and we will see you in the new
year!
