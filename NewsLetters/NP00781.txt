Dear Friend,
Some members of the U.S. Senate want to extend the PATRIOT Act for five and half more years, without any reforms. With Congress currently debating the future of the PATRIOT Act, I want to know what you think Congress should do.
Should Congress pass a "clean" extension of the PATRIOT Act with no changes to current law, or should it be reformed to include more privacy protections, transparency and accountability?
(__)
Yes - Pass a "clean" extension with no changes to current law.
(__)
No - Please change the law to add privacy protections, transparency and accountability.

I need more information.
