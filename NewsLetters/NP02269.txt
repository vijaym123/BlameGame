Dear Friends,
Last
week I introduced the Future Logging Careers Act, a bill that would
allow family-owned timber harvesters to train the next generation in one
of Idahos most important natural resource industries.
H.R.
1215 would extend an exemption already applied to agriculture and
allow 16- and 17-year-old children to work for their parents in the
woods.
Like farming and ranching, timber harvesting is often a
family business where the practice of felling and transporting timber
from the forest to the mill passes from generation to generation. Its
only fair that the exemption in the Fair Labor Standards Act for
agriculture be applied to the timber industry.
I first got the
idea for this bill after meeting with two Idaho loggers from
third-generation logging families, Tim Christopherson of Kamiah and Mark Mahon of
Council. They worked in their family operations as
teenagers.
Christopherson started before he turned 18, thinking the ag
exemption applied to logging. If I hadnt been able to work in the woods
when I was young, I wouldnt have chosen this career, said
Christopherson, whose family-owned DABCO Inc. employs 18 workers.
Two
years ago, Mahons son, J.T., was working for the family-owned Tom
Mahon Logging when a U.S. Forest Service employee sent him home because of
the lack of an exemption. J.T. plays football, basketball and runs
track for the Council High School Lumberjacks.
"Hes in
better physical shape than I am, said Mark Mahon, vice president of the
Associated Logging Contractors of Idaho. Working for their families
provides a path for young people to get a taste of the industry. Once you
get that in your blood, its kind of hard to get it
out.
Tom Mahon Logging was started by J.T.s great-grandfather, Joseph. Tom
Mahon, 71, still works for the company, along with a second son, Joe.
The company employs 12 people in Adams County, where unemployment
reached 16 percent during the Great Recession.
There are
easier ways to make a living, but for us its a labor of love, Mark Mahon
said. Its who we are
loggers.
The Future Logging
Careers Act is endorsed by the American Loggers Council, which represents
harvesters in 30 states.
We strive to operate safely and
want to be able to pass along this generations skills in professional
harvesting to our next generation, said Shawn Keough, executive
director of the Associated Logging Contractors of Idaho. This bill will
allow us to train those who wish to follow in their familys proud
tradition. We applaud Congressman Labrador for his
leadership.
My bill would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to allow 16-
and 17-year-olds to work in mechanized logging operations under
parental supervision. H.R. 1215 has nine original cosponsors from eight
states, including Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho. This week, Idaho GOP Sens.
Jim Risch and Mike Crapo introduced a companion bill in the Senate, S.
694.
