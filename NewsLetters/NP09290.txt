On Monday, I had the opportunity
to speak at the annual Memorial Day ceremony at the Idaho State
Veterans Cemetery.
I was able to join many other Idaho veterans and
their families in expressing our deepest gratitude to those courageous
men and women who lost their lives in battle.
Whether they fought
on the beaches of Normandy, the skies over Midway, or the mountains of
Afghanistan, their mission has always been the same: to fight for
freedom, liberty, justice, and the American way of life.
It is
because of their bravery that we are safe and it is because of their
sacrifice that we are free.
President Reagan once said,
Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We
didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for,
protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will
spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children
what it was once like in the United States where men were
free.
Those who have served our country in uniform understand these
words intuitively.
They did not read them in a textbook. They have
lived these words and have taught them by deeds, not by
words.
We must also recognize that when a service member joins the
military, its not just a job - its a family commitment to our
country.
For each deployed service member, there is often a wife or a
husband left behind.
These quiet patriots kiss their loved ones
goodbye, and send them far from home, often in harms way.
They
run their households.
And they raise their children.
And
they do it without knowing if their loved one will ever return.
And sometimes they do not return.
Whatever accolades we bestow
upon our service members, we must also bestow upon their
families.
I am so proud of Idahos service members, veterans and their
families.
We owe them everything and we must never forget
them.
We must always keep the flame of memory alive.
