Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
This week, I visited several service organizations led by community leaders with a vision to serve those less fortunate in Central Florida. On Friday, I toured a Daves House location in Ocoee. Their team told of their work to provide affordable, permanent housing for those recovering from mental illnesses. Ron and Lin Wilensky founded Daves House in memory of Lins brother. I was happy to hear their vision as they seek to offer safe environments that foster independence and hope.
Some of the other locations I visited this week included:
-
Touring Harbor House of Central Florida with Carol Wick
-
Seeing the dogs and training facility at Canine Companions
-
Meeting with Lui Damiani and his team at the Victim Service Center of Central Florida
-
Listening to success stories of lives that have been impacted by the Howard Phillips Center for Children and Families
-
Participating in a presentation of Congressional Recognition to the Arnold Palmer Medical Center after they were named one of the best childrens hospitals in the country by U.S. News &amp; World Report.

Earlier this year, Joe and Alyse Quinn left their comfortable jobs to establish their own branding and marketing firm. Derived from the Latin verb meaning earn, obtain by service, deserve, Emereo Creative is proof that America still offers an opportunity for success to those who are willing to work hard and passionately pursue their dreams. It was a pleasure to sit down with them this week to hear about their journey, see the services they offer, and discuss how technology is continuing to transform and enhance Central Florida.

On Wednesday, I hosted two senior listening sessions in South Lake County in order to hear directly from members of our community, answer questions, and provide an update on federal issues that concern them. I shared the
services that my office offers , and went around the room listening to each attendee that wanted to make a comment or ask a question. It is an honor to represent our community, and I was grateful to hear the topics and questions that are on their minds.
In addition to visiting Senior Residences of Clermont and the Clermont Senior Center, I took a tour of Benton House Assisted Living, which opened in Clermont earlier this year. It was great to meet the residents, take a tour of the facility, and talk with the Executive Director Terry Haehnel and other members of her team who care for the couples and individuals who call it home.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Earlier this year, a constituent from Leesburg contacted my office regarding a delay
in receiving her disability benefits. Although she had been approved as an eligible recipient, she was informed that there would be a delay in receiving the payments. The constituents husband was suffering from cancer, and she had no income.
My office reached out to the Social Security Administration (SSA) and they were able to process her benefits in a more timely fashion. The constituent followed up with my office, asserting: Without your interventions, I am sure it would have been months. I really want to thank you so much for your help.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
Nearly 350 bills have passed the House of Representatives this year that remain stuck in the Senate. These bills include initiatives that cut bureaucratic red tape, dozens of jobs bills and appropriations measures that fund everything from health care for veterans to citrus disease research to body armor for the troops. Should Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid bring these bills up for a vote as soon as the Senate gets back in town next week?

Legislative Update:
Last Monday, we celebrated Labor Day and Americas rich heritage of hard work. The cornerstone of the American dream has always showcased the promise of opportunity and the hope for success to those who are willing to work hard and pursue their dreams.
Unfortunately, as the employment report revealed this week, our country continues to experience a severely disappointing rate of job creation on a national level, sinking to an eight-month low and revealing a shrinking labor force.
Not only has the Senate refused to consider nearly 50 job creating measures that the House of Representatives have passed, but federal policies continue to hamper job creation and economic growth. Forbes Magazine in
an article this week
revealed how Obamacare is continuing to dampen the job market by increasing taxes, raising the cost of hiring employees, and discouraging work through increased government subsidies. It is a sad day when federal policies weaken our legacies and suppress the American entrepreneurial spirit.
As Congress reconvenes during the next couple of weeks, the House is scheduled to consider two jobs packages. Despite their poor track record for taking up legislation, I urge the Senate to review these measures and pass them without delay.
