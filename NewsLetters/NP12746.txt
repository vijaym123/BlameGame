Dear
David,
Last night I delivered the Tea Party response to the
presidents State of the Union speech.
I wanted to share the
text of the speech with you and invite you to
join the
discussion
on how we can move a new reform agenda forward in
Washington:
Im Senator Mike Lee, from
Utah.
In the few minutes I have tonight
Id like to speak especially
to those Americans who may feel they have been forgotten by both
political parties:
Those individuals and families who
work hard, play by the rules, balance their budgets, honor the Golden
Rule
and dont understand why their government in Washington cant do
the same.
You are probably as frustrated as I am
about an ever-growing government that somehow thinks it is okay to lie
to, spy on and even target its own citizens. Many hard-working
Americans are discouraged and wondering what, if anything, can be
done.
I believe we need to do what Americans have always
done
come together and press for positive change.
Protesting
against dysfunctional government is a great American tradition, going back
to the original Tea Party in Boston, about 240 years ago.
Americans have a natural instinct to stand up and speak out when they know
something is wrong.
In 1773, Americans had
simply had it with a London-based national government that had become
too big, too expensive and far too intrusive.
It is
important to note, however, that had the founding generation stopped
at just protesting against the kind of government Americans did not
want, the Boston Tea Party would have been little more than a footnote
in history.
At most, it would have been remembered as just one
more futile protest against an abusive national
government.
Fortunately for all of us, those early patriots moved on
from Boston and moved past their protest against the government they
didnt want.
They marched forward on a road toward the kind of
government they did want.
It took them 14
long years to get from Boston to Philadelphia, where they created, with
our Constitution, the kind of government they did
want.
In America, the test of any political movement is not what that
movement is against, but what it is for.
The founders made a
point at Boston Harbor, but they made history in Philadelphias
Independence Hall.
Unfortunately, in recent years, we have
had no choice but to engage in a number of protests against our current
presidents Washington-centered agenda.
As
Americans we must always be willing to fight the Boston-type battles -
boldly calling out bad policy whenever we see it
but we must do so with
an eye toward Philadelphia, maintaining a positive focus on the kind
of nation we want to be and become.
Today,
Americans know in their hearts that something is wrong.
Much of what is
wrong relates to the sense that the American Dream is falling out of
reach for far too many of us. We are facing an inequality crisis
one to which the President has paid lip-service, but seems uninterested
in truly confronting or correcting.
This
inequality crisis presents itself in three principal
forms:
immobility among the poor, who are being trapped in
poverty by big-government
programs;
insecurity in the middle class, where families are struggling
just to get by and cant seem to get
ahead;
and cronyist privilege at the top, where political and
economic insiders twist the immense power of the federal government to
profit at the expense of everyone
else.
To be fair, President Obama and his party did not create all of these
problems. The Republican Establishment in Washington can be just as
out-of-touch as the Democratic
Establishment.
However, tonight, as on numerous occasions of late, the Presidents lofty
rhetoric ignored the fact that his administration continues to leave
poor and middle-class families further behind, while he and his allies
insist that the real problem is inequality
itself.
But where does this new inequality come from? From government
every time it takes rights and opportunities away from the American people
and gives them instead to politicians, bureaucrats, and special
interests.
Inequality
real inequality - is trapping
poor children in failing schools to benefit bureaucrats and union
bosses. Its penalizing low-income parents for getting married, or getting
better jobs.
Its guaranteeing insurance companies
taxpayer bailouts if Obamacare cuts into their
profits.
Inequality is blocking thousands of middle-class jobs in the
energy industry as a favor to partisan donors and radical environmental
activists.
Inequality is denying viable, unborn
children any protection under the law, while exempting unsanitary,
late-term abortion clinics from basic safety
standards.
Its denying citizens their right to define marriage in their states
as traditionally or as broadly as their diverse values
dictate.
Its the federal government hurting rural communities,
especially in the west, by controlling and mismanaging public
lands.
Its changing laws without congressional approval,
and spying on American citizens without constitutional
authority.
And of course, Obamacare
all by itself
is an
inequality Godzilla that has robbed working families of their insurance,
their doctors, their wages and their jobs.
Many Americans are now
seeing why some of us fought so hard to stop this train-wreck over the
last four years.
Government-driven inequality is
the reason why, as hard-working families across the country struggle to
make ends meet, six of the ten wealthiest counties in America are now
suburbs of Washington, D.C.
Throughout the last
five years, President Obama has promised an economy for the middle
class; but all hes delivered is an economy for the
middle-men.
And tonight his party cheered as he asked for more of the
same, as if the solution to inequality were
well
more
inequality.
Critics might push back and argue that my own party
has been part of the problem, too often joining the Democrats to rig
our economy to benefit the well-connected at the expense of the
disconnected.
I know, because Im one of those
critics.
But Im speaking to you tonight because I think
maybe - just maybe - thats finally starting to
change.
As a nation we are, once again, at a critical turning
point.
Now, as in 1773, Americans have had it with our
out-of-touch national government. But if all we do is protest, our Boston Tea
Party moment will occupy little more than a footnote in our
history.
Hopefully our leaders, reformers and citizens will
join the journey from Boston to Philadelphia
from protest to
progress. Together we can march forward and take the road that leads to the
kind of government we do want.
We have
a new generation of leaders in Washington with positive, innovative
ideas
thoughtful policy reforms to, as my friend Senator Ted Cruz
says Make D.C. listen.
Reforms to help poor families work their
way into the middle class, to help middle-class families start to get
ahead, and to level the playing field and put corporate and political
insiders back to work for the rest of
us.
Conservative reformers like Senator Marco Rubio, Congressman Paul Ryan and
Congressman Jim Jordan are working on new welfare-reform ideas to help
underprivileged families escape poverty.
Senator
Rand Paul and I are working with some of the most liberal Democrats in
Congress to reform the federal criminal-justice system
to help keep
violent predators behind bars while creating opportunities for reformed,
non-violent offenders to return to the families and neighborhoods
that so desperately need them.
Senator John Cornyn
has legislation that would empower states to improve K-12 education
across the country. Senator Tim Scott has reforms to improve our
job-training programs.
And Ive introduced a bill to modernize higher
education, making it more accessible and affordable for lower-income and
non-traditional students.
Congressman Tom Graves
has a transportation-reform bill to ensure our infrastructure dollars
are invested in roads and bridges, and not wasted on bureaucrats and
special interests.
Congressman Mike Pompeo
introduced a bill to end all federal subsidies for the energy industry. And
others are working on proposals to do the same for every industry
so
that business profits are won from customers, not through political
connections.
After all, if were going to reform welfare, we really
should start with corporate welfare.
One proposal
that should directly help you and your family is a bill I have
introduced to simplify our tax code, and provide relief from the hidden
double-tax Washington currently imposes on working parents, especially moms
and dads in the middle class.
When it comes to
healthcare, we know the best way to repeal Obamacare is to deliver
better solutions.
We cant just return to the
old system. Healthcare policy used to give too much power to insurance
companies; Obamacare now gives far too much power to government. We
know that real reform will put healthcare dollars and decisions where
they belong, in the hands of patients and families and their doctors and
nurses.
So reformers in both the House and the
Senate are hard at work developing new, patient-centered reforms to
control healthcare costs, ensure access to affordable coverage for all
Americans, and provide extra help for the poor and the
sick.
All of these proposals within this new conservative reform
agenda, along with many more to come, mark the road to Philadelphia.
These principles and these policies will work - and will put
Americans back to work.
Not just by cutting big
government, but by fixing broken government.
Not just by making government
smaller but by promoting bigger citizens, stronger families and more
heroic communities. Our goal should be an America where everyone has a
fair chance to pursue happiness - and find it. Thats what it looks
like when protest grows into reform.
So if youre
one of those Americans that big government is leaving behind if you
work hard, play by the rules and teach your kids to do the same, I want
you to know that your family will not be forgotten
anymore.
This new generation of reformers still has a long way to go
to win over our Party in Washington, and even further to go to earn
your trust.
I am confident that our best days
as a nation are ahead of us
not because of government, but because
within Americas diverse society of individuals and families,
neighborhoods and churches, businesses and communities, freedom doesnt mean
youre on your own. Freedom means were all in this
together.
I invite you to join us on the road to a more prosperous
America
together we can create the kind of government we do want and
the kind of nation our children and grandchildren
deserve.
Thank you very much for your time. Good night, and God
bless.
