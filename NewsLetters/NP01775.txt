It&rsquo;s official: Brad&rsquo;s running for Congress!
The outpouring of support has been astounding. More than 100 donors have chipped in...just since 10am!
Now we need to harness this momentum and give Brad the strong start he needs to win in 2016.
That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re launching a $24,000 in 24 hours moneybomb:
Will you chip in $5 or more to help Brad get started?
$5 &gt;&gt;
$36 &gt;&gt;
$50 &gt;&gt;
$100 &gt;&gt;
$250 &gt;&gt;
Other &gt;&gt;
Right-wing groups spent millions of dollars to defeat Brad in 2014. The best way to stand up to those attacks is to start early.
We need to build a strong infrastructure right from the start. One that has the power to get Brad&rsquo;s message to the voters of our district:
I know we can be a nation where every child has an opportunity for a quality education; every family has access to quality, affordable health care; and anyone willing to work hard has the opportunity to earn a fair wage, provide for their family, and achieve a dignified retirement. -- Brad Schneider
