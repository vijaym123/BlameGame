Wean business insurers off Terrorism Risk Insurance Act
Business should relieve taxpayers of insuring against future attacks
By Rep. Jeb Hensarling
The threat posed by radical Islam once again commands the nation's attention at the same time Congress debates whether to re-extend a never-used terrorism-risk insurance program that was supposed to expire nine years ago.
The 2002 Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) subsidizes insurance companies as an incentive to sell insurance against the losses caused by acts of terrorism.
Whether to extend the act beyond its original purpose will be debated in Congress' lame-duck session.
TRIA supporters often suggest the program is a vital part in the war on terrorism, but nothing in the act prevents an attack. Nothing in it saves lives or property.
Instead, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act concerns just one issue: Who should pay for the property damage caused by terrorists
commercial property owners, the insurance companies that took on the risk, or taxpayers?
This is an important question, and it is one reason why there was enormous uncertainly in our economy in the wake of Sept. 11, 2001.
