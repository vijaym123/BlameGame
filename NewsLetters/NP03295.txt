A Renewed Commitment to Native American Children
While I'm in the Senate, I'll consider it a failure if I don't do
anything to help Native American children.
The figures are startling: more than one in three Native children live
in poverty, barely more than half of Native students graduate from high
school, and suicide rates for Native children ages 15-24 are two and a
half times the national average.
Despite some trying circumstances, our children are still full of hope.
I've seen it on the faces of young students on MHA Nation and Standing
Rock. I've heard it at the inspirational powwows at United Tribes
Technical College in Bismarck. And I've witnessed it when meeting with
some of our country's most exceptional Native American youth leaders
through the Champions for Change program.
Dating back to my time as North Dakota's Attorney General in the 1990s,
I've been striving to give Native children the opportunities to thrive -
in many ways, the same kind of opportunities that so many others in
North Dakota had as we grew up.
That's why, yesterday, I re-introduced my bipartisan bill to create a
Commission on Native Children with Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski
from Alaska. We can't just say we want to help. We have to do
something, actually show our Native kids that they are not alone, and
work to make changes to help them. We came so close last year, and this
year, we need to bring the bill across the finish line. Native kids and
their families are counting on us.
Click the image below to watch a video about the importance of this
bill to the lives of Native children and why each of us should stand up
to better support Native kids. And please feel free to share the video
with your friends, neighbors, and family to help spread the word.
Named in part to honor my dear friend and former MHA Nation Chairwoman
Alyce Spotted Bear, the Alyce Spotted Bear and Walter Soboleff
Commission on Native Children would conduct a comprehensive study on
the programs, grants, and supports available for Native children, both
at government agencies and on the ground in Native communities, with
the goal of developing a sustainable system that delivers wrap-around
services to Native children. Then, the Commission would issue a report
to address a series of challenges currently facing Native children,
including how to achieve better use of resources, increase
coordination, produce measureable outcomes, develop better data
collection methods, build stronger private-sector partnerships, and
highlight successful best practices.
This was the first bill I introduced after I came to the Senate because
I knew that a collective effort and increased attention were needed to
improve the lives of Native children. Together, we can make a
difference and I hope you'll join me in this push to make sure all kids
across this country have the support they deserve.

A
Renewed
Commitment
to
Native
American
Children
While
I&#8217;m
in
the
Senate,
I&#8217;ll
consider
it
a
failure
if
I
don&#8217;t
do
anything
to
help
Native
American
children.
The
figures
are
startling:
more
than
one
in
three
Native
children
live
in
poverty,
barely
more
than
half
of
Native
students
graduate
from
high
school,
and
suicide
rates
for
Native
children
ages
15-24
are
two
and
a
half
times
the
national
average.
Despite
some
trying
circumstances,
our
children
are
still
full
of
hope.
I&#8217;ve
seen
it
on
the
faces
of
young
students
on
MHA
Nation
and
Standing
Rock.
I&#8217;ve
heard
it
at
the
inspirational
powwows
at
United

in
Bismarck.
And
I&#8217;ve
witnessed
it
when
meeting
with
some
of
our
country&#8217;s
most
exceptional
Native
American
youth
leaders
through
the
Champions

program.
Dating
back
to
my

as
North
Dakota&#8217;s
Attorney
General
in
the
1990s,
I&#8217;ve
been
striving
to
give
Native
children
the
opportunities
to
thrive
&#8211;
in
many
ways,
the
same
kind
of
opportunities
that
so
many
others
in
North
Dakota
had
as
we
grew
up.
That&#8217;s
why,
yesterday,
I
re-introduced
my
bipartisan
bill
to
create
a
Commission
on
Native
Children
with
Republican
Senator
Lisa
Murkowski
from
Alaska.
We
can&#8217;t
just
say
we
want
to

We
have
to
do
something,
actually
show
our
Native
kids
that
they
are
not
alone,
and
work
to
make
changes
to
help
them.
We
came
so
close
last
year,
and
this
year,
we
need
to
bring
the
bill
across
the
finish
line.
Native
kids
and
their
families
are
counting
on
us.

better
support
Native
kids.

spread
the

you'll

in
this

all
