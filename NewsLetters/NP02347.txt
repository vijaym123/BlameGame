Week in Review
Dear Friends,
Thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter!
Here, you can find out the latest information on what I have been working on at home in Central New York and in Congress.
Read Across America Day
On Monday, I celebrated Read Across America Day with the Literacy Coalition of Onondaga County. The highlight of the program was reading "The Foot Book" by Dr. Seuss to children from PEACE, Inc.'s Head Start program.
Israeli Prime Minister Address to Congress
It was an honor to welcome and hear from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahou in Congress this week.

Special Visitors to Washington, D.C.
I welcomed some special visitors from the district to Washington this week. Jeffrey is a wounded warrior from Oswego County who lost his leg while dispatching his duties.
He is now seeking medical treatment in Washington, D.C. and has multiple surgeries and rehab scheduled over the course of the next year.
His family has picked up and moved to D.C. to support their husband and father.
They were waiting for me outside the House floor this week just so they could say hello. It was a high honor for me to meet such a wonderful and dedicated family. God Bless Jeff and his family.
Foreign Fighter Task Force
I'm proud to announce that I will be leading a bipartisan task force to combat terrorist and foreign fighter threats. We face a constantly evolving terrorist threat to the United States homeland, and Congress must remain vigilant to protect the American people from extremists fighting overseas and the danger they pose to our country.
You can read more about the task force

Again, thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter!
Sincerely,
John Katko (NY-24)
Member of Congress
