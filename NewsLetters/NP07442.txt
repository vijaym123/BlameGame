David --
Michelle Obama emailed you this week.
President Obama emailed you this week.
And now, I&rsquo;m emailing you this week for the 4th time.
I&rsquo;m pleading for your help, because this so important.
With 9 hours until the deadline, we're still 14,321 donations from hitting our goal. We must hit it if we want to defend President Obama from Boehner&rsquo;s shameful lawsuit -- and defeat the Tea Party Republicans who made it possible. Can I count on you?
MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: All Gifts Today Triple-Matched! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
Nancy
