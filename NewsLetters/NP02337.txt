An Important First Step in Supporting our First Responders
North Dakota has been at the forefront of U.S. energy development in
recent years, continually surpassing production records as we continue
to develop and explore the potential of our resources - particularly in
the Bakken. And while we produce this energy, we also have to transport
it.
The reality remains that crude oil will continue to be transported by
rail well into the future. In fact, more than 60 percent of crude oil
produced in our state was transported out of North Dakota by rail as of
mid-2014, according to the Association of American Railroads. Since
trains are likely to be a primary mode of transportation for crude oil,
the train derailment just outside Casselton in December 2013, the
recent incident near Mount Carbon, West Virginia, and yesterday's oil
train derailment near Galena, Illinois remind us that our first
responders need to be prepared to handle potential hazardous materials
situations. First responders put their lives on the line every day,
rushing to dangerous situations to protect our communities, and it's
imperative that they have all the skills and resources they need to
keep us safe while also protecting themselves.
That's why I reintroduced my Railroad Emergency Services Preparedness,
Operational Needs, and Safety Evaluation (RESPONSE) Act last week - to
improve support and training for first responders in North Dakota and
across the country. My bill would establish a public-private panel of
relevant Federal agencies, emergency responders, technical experts, and
the private sector to review training, resources, and unmet needs of
first responders relating to their ability to respond to railroad
hazmat incidents.
And earlier this week, my bill unanimously passed a Senate committee
with bipartisan support - a critical step before a vote on the Senate
floor. Click here to read more from Forum News Service about how my
RESPONSE Act would better prepare and support first responders to
handle hazardous materials situations
.
In the Senate, I've focused on providing first responders with the
tools, training, and resources they need to protect our communities -
especially through my Strong & Safe Communities Initiative. Last March,
I led a Senate hearing on how to better train emergency responders for
hazardous threats such as oil train derailments, bringing Casselton
Fire Chief Tim McLean to testify following the derailment near his
town. And the following month, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony
Foxx came to North Dakota to discuss our state's transportation
infrastructure needs and to review a plan to improve rail safety
nationwide.
There is a one-of-a-kind federal training facility for first responders
in Pueblo, Colorado which teaches them how to handle the derailment of
crude oil trains - which has already been a huge asset for North Dakota
first responders. After pushing the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), I'm proud to have helped secure $5 million in federal funding
for the training facility to help more first responders access this
training, and nearly 70 North Dakotans participated in training in
2014. And I hope more of our state's first responders apply to attend
the facility's training sessions.
Even with improved safety standards, the world is not foolproof, and
there's no way we can say an incident will never happen. We will always
need to have first responders ready to respond to potential rail hazmat
situations in communities across our country, and that's why I'm never
going to give up this push to improve support and training for all our
first responders. Just as our first responders work tirelessly to keep
our communities strong and safe, we also have to make sure we're
providing them with the training and resources they need to stay safe -
an effort that will take all our support.

An
Important
First
Step
in
Supporting
our
First
Responders
North
Dakota
has
been
at
the
forefront
of
U.S.
energy
development
in
recent
years,
continually
surpassing
production
records
as
we
continue
to
develop
and
explore
the
potential
of
our
resources
-
particularly
in
the
Bakken.
And
while
we
produce
this
energy,
we
also
have
to
transport
it.
The
reality
remains
that
crude
oil
will
continue
to
be
transported
by
rail
well
into
the
future.
In
fact,
more
than
60
percent
of
crude
oil
produced
in
our
state
was
transported
out
of
North
Dakota
by
rail
as
of
mid-2014,
according
to
the
Association
of
American
Railroads.
Since
trains
are
likely
to
be
a
primary
mode
of
transportation
for
crude
oil,
the
train
derailment
just
outside
Casselton
in
December
2013,
the
recent
incident
near
Mount
Carbon,
West
Virginia,
and
yesterday's
oil
train
derailment
near
Galena,
Illinois
remind
us
that
our
first
responders
need
to
be
prepared
to
handle
potential
hazardous
materials
situations.
First
responders
put
their
lives
on
the
line
every
day,
rushing
to
dangerous
situations
to
protect
our
communities,
and
it's
imperative
that
they
have
all
the
skills
and
resources
they
need
to
keep
us
safe
while
also
protecting
themselves.
That's
why
I
reintroduced
my
Railroad
Emergency
Services
Preparedness,
Operational
Needs,
and
Safety
Evaluation
(RESPONSE)
Act
last
week
-
to
improve
support
and
training
for
first
responders
in
North
Dakota
and
across
the
country.
My
bill
would
establish
a
public-private
panel
of
relevant
Federal
agencies,
emergency
responders,
technical
experts,
and
the
private
sector
to
review
training,
resources,
and
unmet
needs
of
first
responders
relating
to
their
ability
to
respond
to
railroad
hazmat
incidents.
And
earlier
this
week,
my
bill
unanimously
passed
a
Senate
committee
with
bipartisan
support
-
a
critical
step
before
a
vote
on
the
Senate
floor.
Click

to
read
more
from
Forum
News
Service
about
how
my
RESPONSE
Act
would
better
prepare
and
support
first
responders
to
handle
hazardous
materials
situations .
In
the
Senate,
I've
focused
on
providing
first
responders
with
the
tools,
training,
and
resources
they
need
to
protect
our
communities
-
especially
through
my
Strong
&amp;
Safe
Communities
Initiative.
Last
March,
I
led
a
Senate
hearing
on
how
to
better
train
emergency
responders
for
hazardous
threats
such
as
oil
train
derailments,
bringing
Casselton
Fire
Chief
Tim
McLean
to
testify
following
the
derailment
near
his
town.
And
the
following
month,
U.S.
Secretary
of
Transportation
Anthony
Foxx
came
to
North
Dakota
to
discuss
our
state's
transportation
infrastructure
needs
and
to
review
a
plan
to
improve
rail
safety
nationwide.
There
is
a
one-of-a-kind
federal
training
facility
for
first
responders
in
Pueblo,
Colorado
which
teaches
them
how
to
handle
the
derailment
of
crude
oil
trains
-
which
has
already
been
a
huge
asset
for
North
Dakota
first
responders.
After
pushing
the
Federal
Emergency
Management
Agency
(FEMA),
I'm
proud
to
have
helped
secure
$5
million
in
federal
funding
for
the
training
facility
to
help
more
first
responders
access
this
training,
and
nearly
70
North
Dakotans
participated
in
training
in
2014.
And
I
hope
more
of
our
state's
first
responders
apply
to
attend
the
facility's
training
sessions.
Even
with
improved
safety
standards,
the
world
is
not
foolproof,
and
there's
no
way
we
can
say
an
incident
will
never
happen.
We
will
always
need
to
have
first
responders
ready
to
respond
to
potential
rail
hazmat
situations
in
communities
across
our
country,
and
that's
why
I'm
never
going
to
give
up
this
push
to
improve
support
and
training
for
all
our
first
responders.
Just
as
our
first
responders
work
tirelessly
to
keep
our
communities
strong
and
safe,
we
also
have
to
make
sure
we're
providing
them
with
the
training
and
resources
they
need
to
stay
safe
-
an
effort
that
will
take
all
our
support.
