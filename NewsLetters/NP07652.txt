Friends,
As your Representative, its a priority of mine to build relationships
across the aisle and find pragmatic solutions to the problems facing
our nation.
This week, we have made good progress. The
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act
(H.R. 803) was signed into
law to consolidate and streamline workforce development programs,
protect taxpayer dollars and ensure that workers have the skills they need
to get the jobs that are out there. As a cosponsor of the
House-passed versionthe
Supporting Knowledge and Investing in Lifelong
Skills
(SKILLS)
Act and a leader on the House Committee on
Education and the Workforce, I was invited by the White House to attend
the bill signing ceremony.
Its so refreshing to see folks in
Washington work together to invest in our workforce and take steps to
solve the jobs crisis in our country.
While theres still work
to be done, Im pleased to see H.R. 803 finally cross the finish line
and become law.
I will continue working with my colleagues to
grow our economy and help North Carolinians get back to work and
provide for their
families.
The
High Point Enterprise
wrote a great article about this legislation and my bipartisan
efforts. Check it out
below!
Thought bipartisanship gone way of
dinosaur?
High Point Enterprise, By: Paul B.
Johnson
TRIAD - First-term U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, R-8th, showed Tuesday
that bipartisanship at the nations capital isnt quite dead
yet.
The conservative congressman who represents parts of Davidson County
joined Democratic President Barack Obama as the president signed a
workforce retraining reform bill that Hudson supported. The event marked
the first time that Hudson attended a bill-signing ceremony at the White
House.
The
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act
includes provisions
to better link job-seekers with employers who need their skills,
streamline the oversight of workforce programs, allow communities more
flexibility to make training fit local needs and encourage young people to
re-enter the job market through education and
training.
With millions of
Americans unemployed and millions of jobs unfilled, its clear our
job-training system is broken. We must invest in our workforce to ensure that
folks have the skills they need to get the jobs that are out there, the
congressman said.
Hudson told The High Point Enterprise that the legislation
shows the grip of partisan gridlock in the nations capital can be
loosened.
One of
the reasons I ran for Congress is that I was frustrated the Republicans
and Democrats cant come together and solve these problems that we
all know are problems, the congressman
said.
The president echoed Hudsons
sentiment in his remarks at the
ceremony.
So I want to thank all the Democrats and
Republicans here today for getting this bill done. ... But Im also inviting
you back.
Lets do this more often, the president said. Its
so much fun. Lets pass more bills to help create more good jobs,
strengthen the middle class. Look at everybody
everybody is smiling,
everybody feels good. We could be doing this all the
time.
During his first year in
Congress, Hudson said hes tried to build levels of trust with
Democratic House members despite differing viewpoints on
issues.
One of my better
friends in the freshman class is Joe Kennedy III from Boston. Hes very
liberal. But we like each other, and weve built trust, he
said.
"We
might not agree on every topic, but Congressman Hudson and I share a
strong commitment to workforce development and ensuring all Americans
have the skills they need to find employment. I'm glad to call him a
friend and hopeful we can continue to work together on this and other
issues," Kennedy said in a statement to the
Enterprise.
Hudson told the Enterprise
he hopes that Republicans and Democrats in Congress from the bottom
up can change the partisan gridlock over
time.
