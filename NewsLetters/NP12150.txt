REED: MORE TO BE SPENT ON DEBT INTEREST THAN DEFENSE, SOCIAL SECURITY
A recent
report
from the non-partisan CBO projects the interest payment on the national debt to reach $880 billion by 2024. To put that into perspective, the country spent about $670 billion on defense and $768 billion on Social Security in 2012. Unless we take serious action now, the money to pay for that interest is going to come from gutting critical federal programs or unimaginable tax increases. I care too much to let this happen and am not willing to jeopardize the future of the next generation. Enough is enough &ndash; we must solve the problem now.

ENERGY SECRETARY&rsquo;S NATURAL GAS COMMENTS WELCOME, REED SAYS
In an interview this week, Energy Secretary Moniz suggested Governor Cuomo look at the economic prosperity natural gas development is bringing to neighboring Pennsylvania as he weighs whether or not to lift the five-year moratorium. Demand for energy in the U.S. will only continue to grow. New York can and should be a part of that growth. After more than five years of investigation and study, New Yorkers fairly deserve the benefits of safe, careful development.

REED HELPS CARRY ON VALENTINES FOR VETERANS TRADITION
We spent Valentine&rsquo;s Day with veterans at the Bath VA visiting and handing out Valentines made by Corning-Painted Post students.
The veterans always light up when they see the cards and it&rsquo;s just as meaningful for the students &ndash; they recognize and appreciate the sacrifice of our veterans. Caring for those who have served the country is a staple I look forward to each Valentine&rsquo;s Day.
