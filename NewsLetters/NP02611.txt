Dear Friend,
In just a few short
months, it'll be time to file taxes again. As you may know,
individuals and businesses spend over 6 million hours each year filing taxes.
Our tax code is close to indecipherable. That's why I'm committed to
fighting for a fairer, flatter, easier-to-understand tax code. We need
major reform and I won't stop fighting until we get there. As we work
towards that goal, I want to send some helpful resources your way in
preparation for the April 15 filing
deadline.
For individuals: start with
www.irs.gov ,
which provides a variety of resources to help answer many of your
tax filing questions.
For students: try
the Understanding Taxes site , an interactive tax education
program for high school and community college
classrooms.
The IRS offers free online tax filing software called " FreeFile ," which can help you prepare and e-file your
federal return. Participating software companies make their products
available through the IRS. Some also support state tax
returns.
The IRS offers two free in-person tax help programs called the
Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and the Tax Counseling for the
Elderly (TCE). VITA is a service for anyone earning less than $51,000 a
year. TCE is a service for people over the age of 60.
Find a VITA or TCE site near you .
Call the
IRS's live telephone assistants toll-free at 1-800-829-1040. They're
available Monday through Friday, 7 a.m.
7 p.m., to help you prepare
your tax return or answer your questions.
Visit an IRS
Taxpayer Assistance Center (TAC) for face-to-face assistance.
Find a TAC near you .
Keep up with the
status of your refund by visiting " Where's My
Refund? " for tracking purposes.
As always, if there's anything my office can do to help, or
if you have a question not answered here, please let us know. You can
reach my Modesto office at 209-579-5458 and my D.C. office at
202-225-4540, or email me
here
with questions, comments
and suggestions.
