Friend,
We are just
1 week
away from our first important deadline and we need to have a strong showing.
H ere&rsquo;s why:
- Ami is on the DCCC&rsquo;s list of
most vulnerable Democrats
- The GOP has named Ami a
top target
for 2016
-
The Koch brothers have pledged to spend $889 million
to drown out the voices of regular people in districts like ours
We&#39;ve set a goal to raise $10,000 online before the first FEC deadline on March 31st.
If we are going to be in a strong position to reelect Ami, coming up short is NOT an option.
Click here and give $5, $25, or whatever you can to show your support.
After winning the
most expensive House race in 2014
by less than 2,000 votes, the best way we can avoid a similar race in 2016 is by having a strong start-- and this is our first opportunity to show our momentum.
Can we count on you?
Thanks for standing with us,
Team Bera
P.S.
National pundits and potential opponents are already watching our race, so it&#39;s crucial that we lay early groundwork for a winning campaign.
We saw how costly it was last year to run against a self-funding opponent and, this year, we don&#39;t have any time to lose.
Can you help us reach our goal by giving $5 now?
