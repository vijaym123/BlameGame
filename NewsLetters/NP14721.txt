Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
I am so grateful to be spending this upcoming district work week back
home in the Bluegrass. It will be a busy week visiting folks across the
district, listening to concerns and hearing how I can best represent
the people of central and eastern Kentucky.
My staff and I work hard to be accessible and look forward to seeing
you around the district. And, Go Cats!
Upcoming Events
As part of my Accessibility Initiative, this week I will host another
"Lunch with Your Congressman" in Scott County, as well as a Town Hall
Meeting in Clark County.
I look forward to visiting with constituents at my "Lunch with Your
Congressman" event in Scott County
on
Thursday, November 7th. The lunch will be at Galvin's from 12:00
PM-1:00 PM. I urge you to drop in and share your thoughts on
legislation, get help with federal agencies, or just chat about issues
that are important to you.
On Thursday night from 6:00-7:30 PM, I will be holding another Town
Hall Meeting, this time in Clark County
at the BCTC-Winchester Campus, located at 2020 Rolling Hills Lane in
Winchester. I look forward to answering your questions regarding issues
facing the Bluegrass and our nation.
Advocating for the Valley View Ferry
On Tuesday, I spoke before the House Transportation and Infrastructure
Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation about how the
stringent federal captain licensing requirements on the Valley View
Ferry have forced it to cut back its hours and cease weekend operation.
I encouraged them to support and advance my proposed legislation that
would put licensing authority for captains in the hands of the states-
not federal regulators.
The Richmond Register reported on my testimony
, noting that the "chairman of the committee, Rep. Duncan
Hunter, (R-Calif.) responded favorably to Barr's testimony" saying " .
it shouldn't need the highest classification license to drive a cable
ferry."

Rallying for Kentucky Coal Communities and American Energy Jobs
I was honored to add my voice to those of the thousands of hardworking
coal miners and their families who visited Washington last week as part
of the "Rally for American Energy Jobs."
This event was a powerful denunciation of the EPA's efforts to ban coal
mining in Eastern Kentucky and throughout Appalachia, as well as the
use of coal-fired electricity throughout this country, which are
killing jobs and driving up electric rates.
I stand with the miners who traveled from Kentucky and other coal
producing states to join their Members of Congress at the U.S. Capitol
to make clear to President Obama that the EPA's ruinous policies are
bad for the coalfields, bad for hardworking families, and bad for our
economy.

Have You Told Me Your Obamacare Story Yet?
President Obama repeatedly promised Americans that, "If you like your
current health care plan, you can keep it." Now, millions of Americans
are discovering that is a promise the Administration could not keep
.
Are you one of them?
I want to hear how the law's new insurance exchanges may have changed
Kentuckians health coverage situations.
How has your experience been with the Obamacare website and call
centers? Will your health insurance premiums change? Will you be able
to keep your current plan? Will you have to change doctors? Have you
received a letter from your insurance company regarding changes to your
plan?

to alleviate the harmful impact of this law

Rallying

I
was
honored
to
add
my

who
visited
Washington
last
week
as

for

Energy
Jobs.&#8221;
This

in
