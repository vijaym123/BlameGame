Hi
Neighbor,
It's a beautiful day in this
neighborhood. A beautiful day
for a neighbor.
The Supreme Court made a
necessary, sensible decision
this week to uphold the
Environmental Protection
Agencys (EPA) Good
Neighbor rule, ensuring states
work together with their
downwind neighbors to reduce
polluted air that drifts across
state lines.
Delaware is, unfortunately,
located at the end of what I
call "America's tailpipe."
Other states' dirty emissions
drift east, causing pollution
that Delaware cannot regulate.
During my time as governor, I
learned firsthand that despite
their best efforts, downwind
states cannot clean up their
air alone.
Protecting our environment
and the health of millions of
Americans, including thousands
of children with respiratory
issues in Delaware, should be
everyones goal. We're
all in this together.
I always try to live my life
by the Golden Rule, to treat
others the way I want to be
treated. This weeks
common-sense ruling ensures
that all statesfollow the
Golden Rule for clean air -
making sure we all do our part
to be better neighbors and
clean up air pollution.
Excited about improving
Delawares air? Let me
know about this, or any other
issue, through
