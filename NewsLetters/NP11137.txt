Dear Friend,
As of March 24 th , more
than 700,000 New Yorkers have enrolled for healthcare coverage
through the New York State of Health marketplace. The deadline to get
coverage for this year is less than a week away and I encourage you to sign
up today!
More than 70 percent of those who have enrolled
for healthcare coverage have qualified for financial assistance making
their monthly premiums affordable. According to the New York Times, in
New York the average premium rates are 53 percent lower than
comparable rates before the ACA took place. New Yorkers can access plans
available to them along with estimated costs and their potential financial
assistance by using the Tax Credit and Premium Estimator,
http://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/premiumEstimator .
Please keep in mind that if you do not sign up for healthcare by
the March 31 st
deadline you will not be able to purchase
healthcare through the Marketplaces until next year. Individuals and
families can get information and enroll in a plan in several ways
including, online at
https://nystateofhealth.ny.gov/ , by
calling toll-free at 1-855-355-5777, or in-person through a
navigator.
Thanks for taking the time to read this and dont forget to
get covered!
