IN TWO HOURS: GOP votes on Obamacare-killing budget
David -- Things couldn&rsquo;t be any worse:
Last night, Boehner and the GOP raised $17.5 MILLION at a mega-fundraiser.
They shattered a fundraising record in one single night.
We&rsquo;ll be frank: If we let the GOP drown us in a flood of dirty corporate cash, their agenda could actually pass. Their billionaire financiers will get tax breaks for yachts and private jets. And Obamacare and Medicare will be destroyed.
Suggested Action for David Johnson
Donate $5 to stop the Republicans' budget
We need your help before time runs out.
The next two hours are URGENT
-- we need 2,000 more of our strongest Democrats to fight back.
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
It&rsquo;ll take a wave of grassroots support to stand up to the GOP. We know we can count on you.
