Greetings,
As the disastrous effects of Obamacare come to light, two things become increasingly clear: Obamacare isn't working, and it is hurting millions of people across the country. We will continue the effort to stop this misguided law before it can do any more harm.
The unlimited opportunity to pursue greatness has defined America for generations, and together, we will reclaim the liberty that has made this nation exceptional -- that's what this fight is all about.
Please keep reading below for an update on the latest in the Senate. As always, it's an honor to represent you and the Great State of Texas.
All the best,
Ted Cruz
Obamacare Implementation Has Been Abusive, Lawless
This week, Sen. Cruz released a
report
highlighting the numerous ways the administration has ignored its constitutional limits and overreached its authority in enacting Obamacare:
"President Obama has made explicit that if the Congress won't agree to his preferred policies, then the President will simply rewrite the law through an abuse of executive power," Cruz said. "For over two centuries, we have been a nation of laws, not men, and Republicans and Democrats should both be united against any President who refuses to follow the law. This arrogation of power to the Executive undermines the rule of law, and poses a grave threat to our Constitution and to the liberty of every American."
Budget Deal Moves in the Wrong Direction
On Thursday, Sen. Cruz
released a statement
regarding Congress&rsquo; budget deal.
"The new budget deal moves in the wrong direction: it spends more, taxes more, and allows continued funding for Obamacare. I cannot support it.
"Under the sequester, Congress took a small step forward by reducing spending by 2.4%. We should increase that number while protecting the military from disproportionate cuts.
"Instead, this proposal undoes the sequester's modest reforms and pushes us two steps back, deeper into debt. Supporters of this plan are asking for more spending now in exchange for minor changes that may possibly reduce spending later. That may be a fine deal for Washington, but it&rsquo;s not for the American people."
Obamacare is a Disaster
This week, Sen. Cruz published
an op-ed in
USA Today
that outlines the coming ways Obamacare will harm families and stifle job opportunities. Here are several highlights:
&ldquo;Already, more than 4 million people have lost their insurance plans because of Obamacare. And millions more Americans' health insurance is at risk. Some experts predict anywhere from 80 million to 129 million private health plans will be canceled or forcibly changed over the next year.
&ldquo;Watchdog.org found that 11 of the top 18 hospitals nationwide had only one or two Obamacare insurance carriers.
&ldquo;The president promised that the average family's premiums would fall by $2,500; instead, they have risen by over $3,000 since 2008.&rdquo;
