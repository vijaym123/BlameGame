VISITING DC
November 28, 2013
Today, I urge you and your family to take time to
reflect on all the things we as a nation have to be grateful for. Let us
give thanks for those brave individuals who have come before us and
sacrificed their lives for our freedoms and our security. Let us keep
the men and women in uniform who are currently serving our nation and
their families in our thoughts and prayers, and remember the debt of
gratitude we owe them when they return home.
Please keep in
mind our fellow Americans who are struggling to provide for their
families in this economy. For all that we have to be thankful for, let us
express it through doing what we can to help our neighbors. Each year,
volunteers assist the homeless and others in need and they spread a
message of hope through their good work.
For all of that, I
want to give thanks to God our Creator and wish you and yours a safe and
happy Thanksgiving.
Sincerely,
Richard Burr
