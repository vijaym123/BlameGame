A New Contract With America
Americans deserve a choice between the tired, failing policies we have lingered under for the last six years or a renewed dedication to success and prosperity across our great country.
My American Renewal Initiative, which I launched late last year, offers that choice. The 6-point plan emphasizes cutting spending and getting the government out of the way. If Americans are allowed to get back to work and are given the tools they need to succeed, this nation will continue to lead the world.
To lead in the world, we must have clear goals and a strong military able to secure the peace we desire. When the world is more peaceful, trading routes are open, and our resources are directed toward critical investments, we can achieve the kind of growth we have enjoyed in the past.
Please take a moment to watch my appearance on Fox News with Gretchen Carlson today and be sure to check out the details of my plan here: http://kingston.house.gov/americanrenewal/
