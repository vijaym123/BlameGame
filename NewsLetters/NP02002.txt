Republicans just passed a disgusting budget that guts Medicare, kills Obamacare, and hands tax breaks to billionaires. Add your name to denounce the outrageous Republican budget and protect Medicare &gt;&gt;

We want to take a moment to thank you.
This week, House Republicans just passed a carbon copy of the Ryan plan. They&rsquo;d gut Medicare for future generations, all to pay off their billionaire financiers.
But then something AMAZING happened. Grassroots supporters fought back.
An incredible 84,625 Democrats have stepped up to hold the Republicans accountable. Thank you! IF YOU SUPPORT MEDICARE: Can you sign on and help us get 100,000 signatures by midnight? SIGN YOUR NAME: Denounce the Republicans&rsquo; budget. Tell the Republicans to leave Medicare and Obamacare ALONE!
Thanks,
