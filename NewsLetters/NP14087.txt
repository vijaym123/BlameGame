Dear Friends,
Thousands of families
across West Virginia have grown their families through adoption, and I've
cosponsored two bipartisan pieces of legislation to help families
adopting children from abroad.
The first, H.R 3386, would allow
state courts to correct an adopted child's name or date of birth.
Current law does not recognize state court orders to amend a child's name
or date of birth, creating confusion when children are older and apply
for a passport, driver's license or Social Security card. The
Accuracy for Adoptees Act cuts red tape for families by requiring federal
agencies to accept and recognize state court orders amending a child's
name or date of birth.
The second, H.R. 3323, would establish
a bureau at the State Department to serve as a diplomatic hub on
international child welfare. It would also consolidate the processing of
all inter-country adoptions under the U.S. Citizen and Immigration
Services. The Children in Families First Act streamlines bureaucratic
systems, helping families navigate the international adoption
process.
Every child deserves a loving family, and I am proud to
support these legislative efforts to encourage and streamline
adoption.
MARSHALL UNIVERSITY
I spoke to students competing in
the semi-finals of the West Virginia Statewide Collegiate Business
Plan Competition at Marshall University today. In the competition,
students create business plans in one of three categories: hospitality and
tourism; lifestyle and innovation; and STEM/technology. Three grand
prizes will be awarded of $10,000 cash each plus accounting, legal and
virtual or physical incubator space.
If you have a student
who would be interested in entering next year's competition, please
