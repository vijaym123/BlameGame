As the weather
warms and we finally enter spring, our staff and I look forward to more
Hoosiers visiting Washington, D.C.
We
consider it a great privilege to assist 9 th
District
Hoosiers in planning their Washington, D.C. trip, as well as giving tours
of the U.S. Capitol!
And while scheduling and giving Capitol
tours is a major service our office provides, we can also assist with a
variety of other tours, activities, and sites in the area.
In this
eNewsletter addition, Ill go over these services and detail how we
can help you plan your trip to Washington.
Exploring
Washington, D.C.
In addition to being the center of the
United States Federal Government,
Washington, D.C. has a variety
of attractions and educational opportunities for children, students,
and adults. As your elected representative, I welcome the opportunity
to help you get the most out of your
visit.
As
mentioned, one of the many ways in which we can help is by scheduling tours
at several locations in the area.
Tours to consider for your trip
include::
U.S.
Capitol
White House
Pentagon Bureau of
Engraving and Printing
Library of Congress
Kennedy
Center Supreme Court
While all of these tours offer a
unique experience, I especially recommend scheduling a Capitol tour by our
personal staff.
While the Capitol Visitors Center also offers
tours, our staff will be able to better personalize your
experience.
Youll also have the opportunity to see and learn about our
Washington office and about the staff that works
here!
Other
things to do include: exploring the many
museums and
exhibits , seeing our national monuments, visiting the
National Zoo , paying your respects at
Arlington National Cemetery , and enjoying the beauty of the
National Cathedral , as well as many other activities and
locations.
Our staff can provide further information on any of these
attractions. And if you wish to visit or tour another place in
Washington not listed above, our staff will be happy to look into what is
available.
If you would like to schedule a tour, you can
either call our Washington office at 202-225-5315, or submit a tour
request by
clicking here .
NOTE: Due to the high
amount of requests that our office receives, and the approval process
for some locations, it is highly recommended that you book your tour at
least four to five months prior to your visit in Washington
D.C.
Schools and Large Group
Tours
If you are
organizing a large group to visit Washingtonsuch as a school, church,
or other organizationour staff can help.
Many of the locations
listed above offer special large group tours, which our office can
schedule for you.
In addition, if you have general travel and
accommodation questions, our staff will be happy to assist you with those
arrangements as well.
I also
understand that many large groups use private agencies to plan their
Washington trip.
Nevertheless, I still encourage you to contact our
office as I always enjoy meeting with Hoosiers visiting the
Capitol!
