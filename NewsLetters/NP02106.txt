Dear Friend,
I have had a busy week
working for you and your neighbors here in Sacramento.
Here is an
update on what Ive been doing, and what Ive been working on
recently:
Making Health Care
Available in Our Communities
Every man, woman
and child in the Sacramento region should be able to access
affordable, reliable health care close to home.
Thats why this week I
was pleased to join our community and local students for the grand
opening of the WellSpace Health School Based Community Health Center at
Hiram Johnson High School.
This clinic
known as the Dr. Richard
Ikeda Health Clinic
is a full service medical clinic that is open to
all students.
This new Community Health Center at Hiram Johnson High
School wouldnt have been possible without $500,000 federal grant funding
provided through the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
In addition to
providing for health insurance, holding insurance companies
accountable, disease prevention measures and new, much needed quality standards,
the ACA is funding clinics such as this one to help ensure everyone
has access to needed health care services.
That is why
I am fighting any efforts to undermine, dismantle or
repeal this important health care law.
In our state alone, more
than 1.4 million Californians are enrolled in health insurance through
Covered California, the health insurance marketplace created by the
ACA.
Repealing the ACA would be a detrimental leap backwards in
ensuring the health of our communities.
Rep. Matsui argues against repeal of the Affordable Care Act on the
House Floor.

Advocating for Women and
Families
In March we celebrate Womens History
Month by reflecting on how far women in our country have come, and
recommitting ourselves to the further progress that must be made.
This Congress, I was
elected to serve as a co-chair of
the Congressional Caucus for Womens Issues .
I look forward
to working with our biggest class of women Members yet, to advance
issues that matter most to women and our country.
Outgoing chairs of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues pass the
gavel to the new leadership team.
From left to right:
Congresswomen Lois Frankel (D-FL), Kristi Noem (R-SD), Doris
Matsui (D-CA), Donna Edwards (D-MD), Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-WA), Susan
Brooks (R-IN).
Earlier this year bipartisan
legislation I introduced with my Womens Caucus co-chair Congresswoman Kristi
Noem (R-SD) was passed by the House.
This bill,
the Human Trafficking Prevention, Intervention, and Recovery Act ,
works to better prevent and intervene when trafficking or attempted
trafficking occurs, and opens additional resources for survivors who are
attempting to recover.
This week I hosted a Womens Small
Business Roundtable in Sacramento to talk with local business owners
about the challenges and opportunities they face every day while
running their own businesses.
The roundtable was held at California
Capitals Small Business Administration certified Women Business
Center, and staff was on hand to provide information about resources
available to help business owners.
If you are a small business
owner and are interested in taking classes or learning about available
resources, the
Women Business Center
and the
local chapter of the
National Association of Women
Business Owners
are both worth checking out.
Standing up for Seniors
In the 114th Congress I continue to serve as the co-chair
of the Congressional Task Force on Seniors, where I am working hard
to protect and fight for the health and well-being of older
Americans.
Congresswoman Matsui meets with representatives from
the California Alliance for Retired Americans about the importance of
strengthening and improving Medicare.
They also dropped off
postcards from local residents who support Medicare.
This
year is the 80th anniversary of Social Security, and the 50th
anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid.
These programs are essential to
retirement security and health care for millions of seniors.
Thats why I
sent a letter to the President
urging him
to strengthen and improve Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid in
his budget recommendations.
Seniors
Task Force Co-Chairs Congresswomen Jan Schakowsky and Doris Matsui
pledge to protect and expand Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
