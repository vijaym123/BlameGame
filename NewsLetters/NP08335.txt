Dear David,
It's been a busy start to summer. I had eight town hall meetings around
the First District to hear from constituents and I'll be holding three
veterans forums in the coming weeks. In Washington, D.C. my legislation
to protect waterways from toxic algal blooms passed the House and
Senate and is now headed to President Obama's desk for his signature. I
also attended the White House's Summit on Working Families to discuss
actions we can take to benefit businesses and working parents by
bringing flexibility to the workplace, providing for paid sick leave,
and making child care more affordable. Here's a summary of some of the
issues I've worked on in June.
White House Summit on Working Families
I attended the White House Summit on Working Families to discuss how
greater workplace flexibility, a higher minimum wage, affordable child
care, and paid leave is good for our working families and for business.
I met with several local advocates
including Oregon
Representative Jessica Vega Pederson, officials from Family Forward
Oregon, and a leader from Oregon Tradeswoman Inc. A CEO from Oregon
discussed how family-friendly workplace policies led to better employee
performance and better results for her company.
Harmful Algal Blooms Bill Passes!
My bipartisan legislation to protect our waterways from the threat of
harmful algal blooms and hypoxia passed the House and Senate and will
be signed into law
by
President Obama. Many of my constituents rely on healthy ocean and
waterways to earn a living. This legislation will help researchers
better study and manage harmful algal blooms and reduce the damage they
cause. I spoke on the House floor about the importance of this
legislation. Watch here
.
Town Hall Meetings & Veterans Forum
After holding eight town hall meetings around the First District,
veterans' care emerged as one of the major issues of concern to
constituents. I will be holding three veterans forums around the
district to hear from veterans directly about challenges they face and
issues of concern. Several representatives from local VA centers will
also attend the forum to answer questions. This is an issue I take very
seriously and I am committed
to ensuring our country's veterans get
the care and services they need. Read more about the veterans forums
here
.
Local Student & Teacher Recognized
A Rainier, OR student and his teacher were recognized for their work
piloting the Hometown Heroes
Service Learning Project. I joined them at the
Library of Congress as the curriculum was officially launched. The
Hometown Heroes Service Learning Project aims to connect students with
local veterans in their community to help them learn more about the
Vietnam War and other military conflicts in our nation's history.
As always, you can find more updates on my work around the district and
in Washington on Facebook
and Twitter
. You can also contact my Oregon and Washington, D.C.
offices with questions, comments, or for assistance with a federal
agency. This mailbox is not monitored. To contact me via email, please
