Dear Friend,
Since coming to Washington, I have
worked with my friends on both sides of the
aisle to help advance solutions that will
revive faith in the American Dream. As the
first member of my family to graduate from
college, I have experienced the American
Dream firsthand. That is why I firmly
believe that we must place progress over
politics and work together to make it
easier for Ohioans and Americans everywhere
to succeed.
Over the past several months, we have
seen a series of disappointing jobs
reports. Though the unemployment rate
recently ticked down, the labor force
participation rate stands at 62.8 percent.
That means that more and more people
are dropping out of the workforce or giving
up their search for employment. The lesson
learned is clear; we must turn to
pro-growth solutions that will help get
Northeast Ohioans and Americans across the
country get back to work.
That is why I introduced the Flexibility
to Promote Reemployment Act with my friend,
John Carney, the co-founder of our
Bipartisan Working Group. This bipartisan
bill would encourage job creation by
providing states with more flexibility to
help unemployed individuals collect
paychecks instead of benefit checks.
Under the Middle Class Tax Relief and
Job Creation Act of 2012, the Department of
Labor (DOL) was granted waiver authority
within the unemployment insurance program.
The waivers allowed unprecedented
flexibility in the use of state
unemployment insurance (UI) funds, enabling
states to operate demonstration projects
designed to assist the unemployed in their
efforts to re-enter the workforce. To date,
Texas is the only state that has applied
for a waiver and its application was
swiftly denied. Many states have described
the rigorous application process created by
the DOL as onerous and time consuming.
At a time when too many continue to
struggle with unemployment, we should be
doing everything we can to help incite
growth and investment in our local
communities. It is time for DOL to go back
to the drawing board and reassess its
application requirements.
The Flexibility to Promote Reemployment
Act would require the DOL to do just that,
benefiting both employers and employees. It
would implement a series of reforms to the
current waiver in an attempt to make it
more appealing to states, increasing
states flexibility to help
unemployed individuals find employment.
Additionally, this legislation furthers
extends the deadline for waiver
applications to 2019.
It is critical that Republicans and
Democrats work together toward a stronger
economy. A good place to start is by
working with states to make unemployment
programs more effective for both job
seekers and job creators.
