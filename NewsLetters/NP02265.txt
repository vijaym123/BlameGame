The Second Amendment is engrained within Southwest Missouri
culture from hunting and sporting to self-defense.
Many folks raise
their children with firearms safety in mind, teaching the proper way
to use them and respecting the law.
I remember going from my
first BB gun to my pellet gun then to Grandpa Long's 16 gauge single shot
and then to my Uncle Diemer Long's .22 cal.
Ruger Single Six
pistol that I still have.
Many in the Ozarks went through a similar
progression in their youth.
For so many Americans, the Second
Amendment is more than just self-defense, it's a way of
life.
The ATF was forced to pull a proposed rule to re-classify
.223-caliber M855 green tip ammunition as an "armor piercing bullet" after
getting bombarded with negative comments on their proposed bullet
ban.
The Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act defines "armor
piercing bullet" as "projectiles constructed from specified material [such
as tungsten alloys, steel, iron, brass, bronze, beryllium copper or
depleted uranium] which may be used in handguns."
The law
provides exclusions for hunting, target shooting and sport.
ATF has
actually considered M855s a form of sport ammunition since 1986.
Although .223s are most popularly used in AR-15s and not handguns, ATF
cited concerns among the law enforcement community that the bullets
could be used in newer versions of handguns as a weapon against officers-
a concern that supersedes the hunting or sport
exclusions.
ATF's proposed rule was incredibly concerning, and I am glad
they pulled it.
I saw this as a back door assault by the Obama
administration on our Second Amendment rights through another-'simple
fix' with his pen and phone.
I strongly objected to the rule change
because I saw it as an attempt to ban ammunition, rather than guns
themselves, through market controls.
That is why I, along with
more than 235 of my House colleagues sent a letter to ATF Director B.
Todd Jones to state our objections, demand answers and urge the Bureau's
reconsideration of the rule.
Rest assured that I strongly
oppose any new restrictions interfering with our Second Amendment
rights and actively seek removal of those restrictions - whether they arise
in legislation, an executive agency, or from the president's
continual abuse of executive power.
