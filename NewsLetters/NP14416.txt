Honoring Our Veterans
Dear Friend,
Today we honor our nations veterans for all they have done to protect us, to protect our homeland, and to protect our way of life.
Were it not for the sacrifice and selfless dedication to a cause greater than themselves, the United States would not be the country it is today.
We owe our lives, our prosperity, and our freedom to the United States military veterans that answered the ultimate call of duty.
The United Statesonce just a great experimentis the result of bold ideas and a brave few who are willing to fight for them.
We are eternally grateful to those who have fought and to those who continue to fight to preserve the American way of life.
So todayand every dayjoin me in thanking a veteran for their service and dedication to everything our country holds dear.
May God bless and protect our veterans and their families, and may God bless the United States of America.
Sincerely,
Scott Garrett
