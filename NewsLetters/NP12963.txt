Academy Nominations
It is one of the great
privileges of my job to be able to recommend a select group of individuals
for admission to the United States Service Academies each year.
The military academies offer a unique and rewarding experience for young
men and women.
And North Missouri continues to produce some of
the most outstanding candidates in the nation.
I
am both honored and proud to nominate nine students this year to serve
their country:
United States Military Academy
at West Point, New York : David Jeong and Stephen Komar, both
of Park Hill South High School in Riverside, and Will Ryan of Park
Hill High School in Kansas City;
United States Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, Colorado :
Grant Mitton of Kearney High School, and Tom Prinslow of Parkville
(Park Hill South High School);
United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland : Andrew Maus
of Rockhurst High School in Kansas City, David Mershon of Lees Summit
North High School, and Nicolas Russell of Central High School in St.
Joseph; and
United States
Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, New York : Brennan Rialti of
Lees Summit High School.
While I have nominated these
outstanding students, their application process is not over.
They
still must compete with students nominated from across the
country.
I am always humbled and proud to suggest local
students for these prestigious appointments.
I hope youll join me in
congratulating this stellar group of candidates, and wishing them the
best of luck.

Sincerely,
Sam Graves
