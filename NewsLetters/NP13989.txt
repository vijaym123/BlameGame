Dear Friends,
While sitting in a recent hearing in the Financial Services Committee, where I have sat for nine years, I became enraged over the tone and tolerance level of the debate. I raised my hand to enter the word-of-mouth melee.
I have always been relatively creative when it comes to the use of words. And I had a doozy just waiting. But just before the chair called on me, I recalled something from my childhood that caused me to alter what I had planned to say.
Percy Cleveland and I grew up together in Wichita Falls, Texas. We lived across the street from each other, we were in the same class, attended the same church, and were running mates on the Booker T. Washington track team.
As I remember the story, Percy was casing out a packed peach tree in the back yard of an older couple who also belonged to our church. As he stood outside the gate to their back yard, just staring at the tree, the women of the house walked out of the back door and yelled, "Hey, aren't you Sister Robingson&rsquo;s boy? Are you trying to steal my peaches?&rdquo; Percy quickly, nervously, and a bit angelically replied, "No ma'am, I'm just working on that willpower we talked about in Sunday school."
The point is this: We are all passionate about our beliefs but we must exercise passion with restraint. I cannot control what anyone else says, but I do have the willpower to control what I say.
