Congressman Lamborn and Colleague introduce
legislation to cancel two years of Defense Sequestration
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn and
Congressman Jim Bridenstine (OK-01) introduced the
Provide for the Common
Defense Act
(PCDA).
The bill would reduce the deficit by
$200 billion over ten years by reforming entitlements as requested by
the President in his 2014 budget and unwinding for two years the
devastation to defense caused by sequestration.
Congressman Lamborn said:
Washington has a spending
problem, but incessantly and mindlessly cutting national security will not
get us out of our fiscal mess.
Completely eliminating the
Department of Defense (DOD) would not even pay off this years deficit
let
alone seriously reduce our $17 trillion national debt.
Congress
needs to give our military relief rather than use it as a punching
bag.
Even President Obama must realize that out-of-control
entitlement spending is drowning our country in debt. Our bill cancels national
security sequestration for two years by enacting a few Obama-endorsed
reforms that will actually produce over $300 billion in savings over
ten years. Two-thirds of the savings will go toward debt
reduction.
Congressman Bridenstine
said:
China is claiming international waters and airspace as its
own while building the worlds second largest Navy and Air Force
including state-of-the-art aircraft carriers and nuclear ballistic missile
submarines.
Russia is investing $750 billion into military
modernization and buildup while threatening nuclear war and invading its
former Soviet satellite states which are striving for freedom and
independence.
In the meantime, America is hollowing out its military,
emboldening our enemies to be even more aggressive, and encouraging
our friends to align with the east.
This bill generates three
times the savings needed to offset the increased defense spending through
implementing modest mandatory spending reforms endorsed by President
Obama. Our bill also pays down the national debt by $200
billion.
Even without the Budget Control
Act-required sequestration, our national security budget is scheduled to
receive a $650 billion cut over ten years.
Sequestration is an
additional cut
a blunt and imprecise meat axe in the words of former
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta
that mindlessly cuts another $500
billion.
The
Provide for the Common
Defense Act
cancels sequestration for the revised security
category in FY 2014 and FY 2015.
This change brings national security
spending back up to levels consistent with the House-passed Ryan
Budget, the conservative Republican Study Committee budget, and the
Budget Control Act caps.
PCDA
enacts
mandatory spending reforms resulting in approximately $307 billion in
savings over one decade.
The bill only enacts reforms proposed by
President Obama in his FY 2014 budget request.
The 3-to-1 ratio of
budgetary savings to increases sensibly restores the national
security budget in a fiscally responsible manner.
The remaining
two-thirds of savings is used to help pay down the debt.
