David -- President Obama emailed you last week.
Now I&rsquo;m emailing you, too.
When both the President and the Vice President email you, it&rsquo;s got to be important. So please take 30 seconds to read this:
We have a remarkable opportunity coming up.
We only need to win four currently Republican seats to win back the Senate and restart progress. Only four!
We can win four seats, right? Well -- it depends on you. Republican megadonors are starting to throw their millions into the ring, and if Democrats don&rsquo;t stay on track toward our fundraising goals, this election could be over before it even begins.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking you to give to the DSCC before the end-of-month FEC deadline in 10 hours. Will you pitch in now?
You&rsquo;ve seen how Republicans run things -- we need to get them out of office and keep them out.
We don&rsquo;t have to match what they&rsquo;ll spend dollar for dollar -- that&rsquo;s impossible.
But we
do
need every single grassroots supporter on board and giving what they can.
Your contributions add up, and they&rsquo;ll power our win.
Democrats can&rsquo;t do this without you. Will you pitch in before the deadline in 10 hours?
