Congressman
Bill
Foster
Representing the 11th District
April 29, 2014
Dear Friend,
Recently, I launched Project Growth, an initiative that focuses on
bringing members of our community together to grow our local economy and
support jobs and economic development in our region. Throughout
the past year, I have toured the 11 th
District, meeting
with over 145 businesses and community groups to identify four key
areas for improving job growth: strengthening the middle class,
investing in our transportation and infrastructure, education and workforce
development and supporting advanced
manufacturing.
As a scientist and businessman I recognize that
real progress doesnt come from partisan rhetoric or poll-tested
talking points, but from a close examination of what works in the real
world, what doesnt work and how we can close the gap. I believe Project
Growth will allow our communitys leaders, educators, and working
families to come together and build a brighter future for
Illinois.
I hosted a telephone town
hall meeting to discuss project growth and hear from
constituents.
If you werent able to join the
conversation, you can voice your opinion
here .
I launched Project Growth because I
believe we have great potential to bring jobs and opportunity to our
community with the right focus on ensuring our workers have the skills they
need for 21st century jobs and ensuring businesses have the tools and
infrastructure they need to thrive.
