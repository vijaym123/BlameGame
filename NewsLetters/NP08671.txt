House Passes Congressman Lamborn's
VA Clinic Naming Bill
6/17/14
Today, the House
passed Congressman Doug Lamborn's legislation naming the new Colorado
Springs VA Clinic after PFC Floyd K. Lindstrom. PFC Lindstrom was a
Colorado Springs native who gave his life serving the country in World
War II and is a Medal of Honor
recipient.
Ensuring that our veterans have access to
convenient, comprehensive healthcare has always been a priority of mine.
It has been an honor to partner with so many Southern Colorado
veterans to bring a new Colorado Springs Community Based Outpatient
Clinic for our veterans. This facility is set to open on August 18th on
the corner of West Fillmore Street and Centennial Boulevard off of
I-25. This new facility will more than double the size of the current
clinics.
This increased capacity will allow for 5000-6000 more
veterans to receive primary and mental care right here in Colorado
Springs.
Today, I am honored to announce that I offered H.R. 3375 on
the House floor and it passed.
This bill designates the new
Colorado Springs VA clinic as the PFC Floyd K. Lindstrom Department of
Veterans Affairs Clinic.
PFC Lindstrom was posthumously awarded the
Medal of Honor for his heroic actions during WWII and is one of the
Fifth Congressional Districts
and the nations
greatest heroes.
He is buried in Colorado Springs at the Evergreen Cemetery and I
can think of no one more deserving of this honor.
I want to thank
the Colorado Springs CBOC Naming Committee and everyone else who
worked so hard to make this happen.
