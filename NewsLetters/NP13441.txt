A Defining Moment
I believe that right now, were
living in a defining moment when it comes
to the treatment of our nations
veterans and helping current
servicemembers transition out. Its
a time when our older veterans population
including so many of our Vietnam
veterans
are increasingly relying
on VA care. But were also at
a pivotal point - an opportunity we
cannot afford to miss - to properly
care for an entire generation of
post-9/11 veterans, who have endured a
decade of repeated deployments,
unbelievable stress on their
families, and the visible and
invisible wounds of war. That
challenge - to meet the needs of these
brave men and women not decades down the
road, but from the moment they begin the
process of transitioning to civilian life
- is truly one of our nations
great tasks at hand.
Below, youll find just a few of
the veterans issues I focused on this
year. I look forward to continuing
these efforts, and working to ensure our
nations heroes get the care and
services they have earned.
Caring for the Invisible Wounds of
War
We know our servicemembers and veterans
have faced unprecedented challenges:
multiple deployments, difficulty finding a
job here at home, and isolation in
their communities. Some have faced tough
times reintegrating into family life, with
loved ones trying to relate but not knowing
how. These are the challenges our
servicemembers and veterans know all too
well. But even as they turn to us for
help, were losing the battle.
Time and time again, weve lost
servicemembers and veterans to suicide.
But while the Departments of Defense
and Veterans Affairs have taken important
steps towards addressing this crisis, we
know more must be done. We know that any
solution depends upon reducing wait times
and improving access to mental health care;
ensuring proper diagnosis; and achieving
true coordination of care and information
between the Departments. That is why I was
so proud to pass my
Mental
Health ACCESS Act
earlier this year to
begin addressing these issues. I will
continue doing everything I can to ensure
that we are providing our vets with access
to consistent, quality mental and
behavioral health care and support services
to address their needs.
Military Sexual Assault: It is Time to
Act
Meeting with survivors of military
sexual assault in Seattle this past May.
Military sexual assault is an epidemic
that has plagued our nations
military for far too long. It is absolutely
unconscionable that a fellow servicemember,
the person you rely on to have your back
and to be there for you, would commit such
a terrible crime. But, whats worse,
and what has made change an absolute
necessity - is the prevalence of these
crimes. Recent estimates tell us that
26,000 servicemembers are sexually
assaulted each year, but just over 3,000 of
those assaults are reported. According to
the Department of Veterans Affairs, about
one in five female veterans treated by VA
has suffered from military sexual trauma.
One in five.
Since coming to the Senate, I have
worked with my colleagues in Congress to
end military sexual assault and provide
victims with the tools and support they
need to seek justice. This past year saw
great strides taken towards that goal as
the Senate passed into law a number of
landmark provisions that help to combat
military sexual assault, including those
contained within my Combating Military
Sexual Assault Act of 2013. Among other
things, my legislation will provide Special
Victims Counsels to help victims of
military sexual assault navigate the
military justice system and ensure that
members of the National Guard and Reserve
have access to Sexual Assault Response
Coordinators 24/7. I am extremely proud of
this legislation and believe it will go a
long way towards helping victims and
finally ending the crisis of sexual assault
within our militarys ranks.
Over the course of advocating for this
legislation, I had a chance to sit down
with survivors of military sexual assault
in Seattle. Our servicemembers
volunteer to face danger, to put their
lives on the line, to protect the country
and all its people
but not the kind
of dangers that we discussed that day in
Seattle. Thanks to eye-opening
conversations like these, bipartisan
cooperation back in the other Washington,
and the work of thousands of dedicated
advocates -- we are poised to make a
difference on an issue that women
everywhere have brought out of the shadows.

Ending Veteran Homelessness
This summer, I visited with veterans at
the Longview Housing Authoritys
recently opened Stratford apartments, which
provide long-term permanent housing for 20
formerly homeless veterans
No one who has made sacrifices to serve
our nation should ever be homeless, and
this problem should never be ignored.
Ive been proud to work to stem the
tide of this national crisis, and
weve seen real results in Washington
state this year. In May,
eight
housing authorities received $1.5M
to
put 260 homeless veterans into stable
housing under a program I included in the
2013 Transportation, Housing and Urban
Development Appropriations bill, and in
July,
nine
of our states non-profit community
agencies received more than $7M
in
homeless prevention grants through a VA
program I supported.
With new servicemembers returning home
every day and the economy sputtering, we
must step up our efforts in the new year to
provide all veterans with stable housing
and the dignity that comes with it.
We owe it to our veterans to provide them
with the resources and support they need to
keep a roof over their heads. We have
a long and difficult road ahead, but
its clear that with continued
investment in proven solutions and
cooperation between government agencies, we
are making progress.
Reducing the Claims Backlog
I continue to hear all too often from
veterans in Washington state that they are
waiting far too long for their claims to be
completed.Ending the claims backlog
and building a timely, accurate claims
processing system is one of the absolute
top priorities for our veterans.
I understand this is a complex
problem that has no single easy solution,
and I am encouraged by the steps VA has
taken so far, but I know that VA still has
a long way to go. In the coming year,
I will continue to work with the VA to meet
these challenges and ensure that each and
every veteran receives the benefits they
have earned.

Hiring Our Heroes
Delivering the keynote address to the
first graduating class of military students
from Microsofts Software &amp;
Systems Academy pilot program at Saint
Martins University in
Lacey.
Not long ago, double-digit unemployment
rates for recent veterans was the norm, but
today, unemployment among recent veterans
is way down - on par with the rest of the
country, and post-9/11 veterans are being
hired at a faster rate than
non-veterans. Still, no matter how
much we do to prepare our veterans for the
workplace
I believe we cant
succeed in fully transitioning them to
civilian life without strong, lasting
partnerships with businesses, labor
organizations, colleges, and
universities. This month, I had the
honor of speaking at a
graduation
ceremony to honor the first graduating
class of military students
from
Microsofts Software &amp; Systems
Academy pilot program at Saint
Martins University in Lacey,
WA. The 22 graduates, currently
active duty service members from JBLM, will
now be hired into entry-level roles as
software testers at Microsoft or Launch
Consulting.This program was started
shortly after my VOW to Hire Heroes Act was
signed into law in 2011 and is exactly the
type of program I had hoped to encourage by
writing that important piece of
legislation.
I am also thrilled by JBLMs
emergence over the last year as a national
leader in transitioning servicemembers back
into civilian life. Recently,
the
Department of Labor awarded JBLM a $5.5M
grant to help servicemembers transition to
meaningful employment after
separating.
This grant was
established under the VOW to Hire Heroes
Act and will help approximately 900
servicemembers.
Wishing You a Safe and Happy Holiday
Season
We are so grateful you have given us the
gift of security, service, and
self-sacrifice. Please know you, and
your families, are in our thoughts each and
every day of the year. Happy
holidays.
