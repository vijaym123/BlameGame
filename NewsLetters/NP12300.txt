Hidden Crisis: Examining Prescription
Drug and Heroin Addiction in Our Community
Wednesday, February 19th at
3:00 p.m.
Fred Rogers Center
St. Vincent College in
Westmoreland County
Dear
Friend,
I invite you to join me at a congressional
forum I am hosting on
Wednesday, February 19th at 3:00 p.m. at the
Fred Rogers Center on the campus of St. Vincent College in
Westmoreland County
entitled "Hidden Crisis: Examining Prescription
Drug and Heroin Addiction in Our Community." This meeting is open to the
public and I urge you to
participate.
Heroin and prescription drug abuse is a growing problem
nationally as well as right here in Southwestern Pennsylvania. In
just the last few weeks, a tainted batch of heroin caused at least 22
deaths in the Pittsburgh area. Last year, there were a total of 115
heroin and heroin-related deaths in Allegheny, Washington, Westmoreland,
and Greene counties. Nationwide, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration reports that heroin use has nearly doubled
between 2007 and 2012.
Oftentimes, drug abuse is a form of self-medication for the estimated 8.9
million persons with both a mental and substance use disorder. In
Washington D.C., I have been working to reform our current mental health
system to increase the treatment options for persons with mental
illness. In December, I introduced the Helping Families in Mental Health
Crisis Act ( H.R. 3717 ), to break down barriers to
mental health treatment for individuals and families, and increase the
amount of resources and hospital beds available for the most severely
mentally ill patients. I will be discussing how this legislation fits
into the continuum of care for those battling substance abuse as
well.
At this forum, we will hear
the perspectives of parents, medical professionals, and community
leaders about the problems facing those who battle drug addiction and
discuss the best strategies to combat this hidden crisis at the local,
state, and federal levels.
Please mark your calendars for
Wednesday, February 19th at
3:00 p.m. at the Fred Rogers Center on the campus of St. Vincent
College, 300 Fraser Purchase Road, Latrobe, PA 15650 . I personally
welcome you to come out, listen to all the perspectives, and share your
personal experiences as well as offer your own thoughts on this
topic. To RSVP or request additional information, please contact Meg
Vredenburgh in my district office at (724) 850-7312 or at
meg.vredenburgh@mail.house.gov .
Sincerely,
Tim Murphy
