Kansas Common Sense
December 15, 2014
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thanks for your continued interest in
receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
Late Thursday night, the House of Representatives narrowly passed H.R.
83, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, two
hours before funding for the federal government was set to expire.
Following a two-day, level-funding extension of government funding, the
Senate passed the $1.1 trillion spending bill on Saturday by a vote of
56-40. I voted against the measure.
The spending package will finance the day-to-day operations of every
Cabinet department, with the exception of the Department of Homeland
Security (DHS), through September 30, 2015. With DHS funding running
out on February 27, 2015, the new Republican majorities in Congress
will have an opportunity early next year to act on President Obama's
executive action suspending the deportation of millions of illegal
immigrants. On Saturday, I voted in favor of a point of order
indicating President Obama's executive action on immigration is
unconstitutional.
Honoring Junction City's LTG Seitz
Last Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed
legislation I led and offered in the U.S. Senate to honor the life and
legacy of a dedicated soldier, an American hero, and Kansan Lieutenant
General Richard J. Seitz. This legislation, S. 1434, will designate the
Department of Veterans Affairs Junction City Community-Based Outpatient
Clinic as the "Lieutenant General Richard J. Seitz Community-Based
Outpatient Clinic."
Lieutenant General Richard "Dick" Seitz was a mentor and someone I hold
in extremely high regard. He spent his life serving others, and as a
WWII veteran in the United States Army he successfully led his
battalion through the Battle of the Bulge. His Army career included
nearly 37 years of active duty service and he received numerous awards
including the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars and the Purple Heart.
Following his military retirement he never retired from serving,
Lieutenant General Seitz settled in Junction City, where he frequently
visited Ft. Riley to greet deploying and returning soldiers from Iraq
and Afghanistan. He was also involved with the Coronado Council of the
Boy Scouts, served on the Board of the Eisenhower Presidential Library,
and was named an Outstanding Citizen of Kansas. In 2012, the Lieutenant
General Richard J. Seitz Elementary School at Ft. Riley was named in
his honor. Click here

Change in Access or Avoiding Change?
I continue to hear stories across Kansas about VA failures, and the
majority of these stories relate to veterans continuing to struggle to
access the care they need through the VA - whether that means waiting
months for a routine appointment or driving hours to see a doctor. The
good news is that most veterans say once they actually get an
appointment, they are satisfied with the care they receive, but the
preeminent challenge is accessing care altogether.
In July, the House and Senate came together to pass the Veterans
Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014, comprehensive
legislation to respond to VA wait-time manipulation and failure to
provide timely, quality health care to veterans. The Choice Act was
intended to provide veterans with the choice to access health care
outside the VA when timeliness and distance put their well-being at
risk. This legislation permitted veterans across the country to access
non-VA community care if they live more than 40 miles from a VA medical
facility, including Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs), or
their wait time for an appointment is more than 30 days.
Even with this new law, many rural Kansas veterans are still unable to
access the care they need because some VA facilities do not offer all
medical services. It has become clear that the VA will not allow
veterans to access non-VA community care if they live within 40 miles
of a VA medical facility, regardless of whether that facility can
provide the specific care a veteran needs. There are countless stories
of veterans who are desperate for care and the VA's limited
interpretation of the Choice Act is preventing their access to care
closer to home.
Last week, I met with VA Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson who reiterated
the limitations of the Choice Act language. We discussed using
existing, separate authorities under Title 38 to provide this access to
non-VA care. I appreciate the Deputy Secretary's agreement that it
doesn't make sense for veterans to travel unacceptable distances to
meet their basic health care needs. I was hopeful we could come to a
solution about using existing VA authorities to address this problem;
however, my impression was that Deputy Secretary Gibson and the VA do
not believe they have the current authorities to fix this problem.
If the VA believes it does not have the authority to fix this problem,
then as a Member of the United States Senate and the Senate Veterans'
Affairs Committee, I will do everything I can to help. This week I
introduced legislation, S.3006, to reaffirm the VA authority to offer
non-VA care to veterans who find themselves in this gray area of the
Choice Act and are unable to receive the healthcare services they need
from a VA medical facility within 40 miles of where they live. Rural
veterans should not feel forgotten because of where they live and be
unable to request care closer to home. I am hopeful the VA is on the
right track for change and reform, and I will continue to work with the
VA in good faith to provide the best possible timely care to those who
served our country.
Introducing Wounded Warriors Federal Leave Act
This week I joined Senator Jon Tester of Montana to introduce
legislation to make certain wounded veterans who work for the federal
government can get the care they need. The Wounded Warriors Federal
Leave Act, would provide first-year federal workers who have
service-related disabilities 104 hours of sick leave to use for medical
visits. Currently, first-year government workers accrue four hours of
sick leave each pay period, forcing many veterans with disabilities to
take unpaid leave because they have not built up the necessary leave
time. Our legislation is supported by the American Legion, the American
Federation of Government Employees, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and
the National Treasury Employees Union, among others.
Service-disabled veterans who have served our nation with duty and
honor deserve peace of mind when transitioning into the federal
workforce and civilian life. The Wounded Warriors Federal Leave Act
will help make sure certain veterans can pursue a career in the federal
government and support their families while also addressing their
medical treatment needs.

Federal Leave Act.
Legislation to Encourage Innovative Savings Programs Passes Senate
On Wednesday evening, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed legislation I
introduced called the American Savings Promotion Act. This legislation
will remove federal barriers that prevent states from implementing
innovative savings programs, including prize-linked savings accounts
(PLS). PLS accounts would incentivize personal savings by offering
participants chances to win prizes based on savings account deposit
activity while never putting their savings at risk.
A handful of states currently allow credit unions to offer these types
of programs, and the results have been promising. Studies show these
programs have been successful at encouraging first-time savers to open
an account and also that nearly two-thirds of participants have rolled
their accounts over at the end of the year rather than withdrawing
their savings. The legislation passed the House in September 2014 and
now heads to the President. At a time when 44 percent of American
households lack the savings necessary to weather financial emergencies,
this law will help American families become more financially secure and
upwardly mobile. Click here to learn more.
Participating in Tech Roundtable with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella
On Tuesday, I joined my colleagues on the Republican High-Tech Task
Force for a discussion with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. In his first
trip to Washington since succeeding Steve Ballmer as CEO, Mr. Nadella
provided an overview of some of the important policy issues for not
only Microsoft, but also the tech sector and the greater American
economy including improving access to markets/trade issues; developing
human capital, including more computer engineers, investing more in
K-12 education, and making our immigration system work for tech talent;
and strengthening our patent system and intellectual property.
We also had a good discussion about the Kansas tech economy and ways to
make our state more competitive when it comes to developing and
retaining tech talent. As Republicans prepare for leading the Senate,
this meeting was a helpful way to develop a technology and innovation
agenda for the new Congress.
Thanking Fall Interns
Thanks to Jakob Provo of El Dorado and Nathan Yunker of Hays for their
hard work this fall interning in my Washington, D.C. office. They have
been doing important work for Kansans and gaining valuable experience.
I was an intern myself-it's what got me interested in public service.
Interns continue to prove to me that there are a lot of great, young
people across our state who have an interest in making a difference in
the lives of others. Young people like Jakob and Nathan give me
confidence that good things are going to happen in this country and
especially in Kansas because our kids are growing up to become
impressive and hardworking young adults.

honor
the

of
a

Lieutenant

He
spent
his

and
as
a
WWII

in

he

Change
in
Access
or
Avoiding
Change?
I
continue
to
hear
stories
across
Kansas
about
VA
failures,
and
the
majority
of
these
stories
relate
to
veterans
continuing
to
struggle
to
access
the
care
they
need
through
the
VA
&#8211;
whether
that
means
waiting
months
for
a
routine
appointment
or
driving
hours
to
see
a
doctor.
The
good
news
is
that
most
veterans
say
once
they
actually
get
an
appointment,
they
are
satisfied
with
the
care
they
receive,
but
the
preeminent
challenge
is
accessing
care
altogether.
In
July,
the
House
and
Senate
came
together
to
pass
the
Veterans
Access,
Choice,
and
Accountability
Act
of
2014 ,
comprehensive
legislation
to
respond
to
VA
wait-time
manipulation
and
failure
to
provide
timely,
quality
health
care
to
veterans.
The
Choice
Act
was
intended
to
provide
veterans
with
the
choice
to
access
health
care
outside
the
VA
when
timeliness
and
distance
put
their
well-being
at
risk.
This
legislation
permitted
veterans
across
the
country
to
access
non-VA
community
care
if
they
live
more
than
40
miles
from
a
VA
medical
facility,
including
Community-Based
Outpatient
Clinics
(CBOCs),
or
their
wait
time
for
an
appointment
is
more
than
30
days.
Even
with
this
new
law,
many
rural
Kansas
veterans
are
still
unable
to
access
the
care
they
need
because
some
VA
facilities
do
not
offer
all
medical
services.
It
has
become
clear
that
the
VA
will
not
allow
veterans
to
access
non-VA
community
care
if
they
live
within
40
miles
of
a
VA
medical
facility,
regardless
of
whether
that
facility
can
provide
the
specific
care
a
veteran
needs.
There
are
countless
stories
of
veterans
who
are
desperate
for
care
and
the
VA&#8217;s
limited
interpretation
of
the
Choice
Act
is
preventing
their
access
to
care
closer
to
home.
Last
week,
I
met
with
VA
Deputy
Secretary
Sloan
Gibson
who
reiterated
the
limitations
of
the
Choice
Act
language.
We
discussed
using
existing,
separate
authorities
under
Title
38
to
provide
this
access
to
non-VA
care.
I
appreciate
the
Deputy
Secretary&#8217;s
agreement
that
it
doesn&#8217;t
make
sense
for
veterans
to
travel
unacceptable
distances
to
meet
their
basic
health
care
needs.
I
was
hopeful
we
could
come
to
a
solution
about
using
existing
VA
authorities
to
address
this
problem;
however,
my
impression
was
that
Deputy
Secretary
Gibson
and
the
VA
do
not
believe
they
have
the
current
authorities
to
fix
this
problem.
If
the
VA
believes
it
does
not
have
the
authority
to
fix
this
problem,
then
as
a
Member
of
the
United
States
Senate
and
the
Senate
Veterans&#8217;
Affairs
Committee,
I
will
do
everything
I
can
to
help.
This
week
I
introduced
legislation,
S.3006,
to
reaffirm
the
VA
authority
to
offer
non-VA
care
to
veterans
who
find
themselves
in
this
gray
area
of
the
Choice
Act
and
are
unable
to
receive
the
healthcare
services
they
need
from
a
VA
medical
facility
within
40
miles
of
where
they
live.
Rural
veterans
should
not
feel
forgotten
because
of
where
they
live
and
be
unable
to
request
care
closer
to
home.
I
am
hopeful
the
VA
is
on
the
right
track
for
change
and
reform,
and
I
will
continue
to
work
with
the
VA
in
good
faith
to
provide
the
best
possible
timely
care
to
those
who
served
our
country.
Introducing
Wounded
Warriors
Federal
Leave
Act This
week
I
joined
Senator
Jon
Tester
of
Montana
to
introduce
legislation
to
make
certain
wounded
veterans
who
work
for
the
federal
government
can
get
the
care
they
need.
The
Wounded
Warriors
Federal
Leave
Act ,
would
provide
first-year
federal
workers
who
have
service-related
disabilities
104
hours
of
sick
leave
to
use
for
medical
visits.
Currently,
first-year
government
workers
accrue
four
hours
of
sick
leave
each
pay
period,
forcing
many
veterans
with
disabilities
to
take
unpaid
leave
because
they
have
not
built
up
the
necessary
leave
time.
Our
legislation
is
supported
by
the
American
Legion,
the
American
Federation
of
Government
Employees,
the
Veterans
of
Foreign
Wars,
and
the
National
Treasury
Employees
Union,
among
others.
Service-disabled
veterans
who
have
served
our
nation
with
duty
and
honor
deserve
peace
of
mind
when
transitioning
into
the
federal
workforce
and
civilian
life.
The
Wounded
Warriors
Federal
Leave
Act
will
help
make
sure
certain
veterans
can
pursue
a
career
in
the
federal
government
and
support
their
families
while
also
addressing
their
medical
treatment
needs.

Legislation
to
Encourage
Innovative
Savings
Programs
Passes
Senate
On
Wednesday
evening,
the
U.S.
Senate
unanimously
passed
legislation
I
introduced
called
the
American
Savings
Promotion
Act.
This
legislation
will
remove
federal
barriers
that
prevent
states
from
implementing
innovative
savings
programs,
including
prize-linked
savings
accounts
(PLS).
PLS
accounts
would
incentivize
personal
savings
by
offering
participants
chances
to
win
prizes
based
on
savings
account
deposit
activity
while
never
putting
their
savings
at
risk.
A
handful
of
states
currently
allow
credit
unions
to
offer
these
types
of
programs,
and
the
results
have
been
promising.
Studies
show
these
programs
have
been
successful
at
encouraging
first-time
savers
to
open
an
account
and
also
that
nearly
two-thirds
of
participants
have
rolled
their
accounts
over
at
the
end
of
the
year
rather
than
withdrawing
their
savings.
The
legislation
passed
the
House
in
September
2014
and
now
heads
to
the
President.
At
a
time
when
44
percent
of
American
households
lack
the
savings
necessary
to
weather
financial
emergencies,
this
law
will
help
American
families
become
more
financially
secure
and
upwardly
mobile.

Participating
in
Tech
Roundtable
with
Microsoft
CEO
Satya
Nadella
On
Tuesday,
I
joined
my
colleagues
on
the
Republican
High-Tech
Task
Force
for
a
discussion
with
Microsoft
CEO
Satya
Nadella.
In
his
first
trip
to
Washington
since
succeeding
Steve
Ballmer
as
CEO,
Mr.
Nadella
provided
an
overview
of
some
of
the
important
policy
issues
for
not
only
Microsoft,
but
also
the
tech
sector
and
the
greater
American
economy
including
i mproving
access
to
markets/trade
issues;
d eveloping
human
capital,
including
more
computer
engineers,
investing
more
in
K-12
education,
and
making
our
immigration
system
work
for
tech
talent;
and
s trengthening
our
patent
system
and
intellectual
property.
We
also
had
a
good
discussion
about
the
Kansas
tech
economy
and
ways
to
make
our
state
more
competitive
when
it
comes
to
developing
and
retaining
tech
talent.
As
Republicans
prepare
for
leading
the
Senate,
this
meeting
was
a
helpful
way
to
develop
a
technology
and
innovation
agenda
for
the
new
Congress.

office.
They
have
been
doing
important
work
for
Kansans
and
gaining
valuable
experience.
I
was
an
intern
myself&#8212;it&#8217;s
what
got
me
interested
in
public
service.
Interns
continue
to
prove
to
me
that
there
are
a
lot
of
great,
young
people
across
our
state
who
have
an
interest
in
making
a
difference
in
the
lives
of
others.
Young
people
like
Jakob
and
Nathan
give
me
confidence
that
good
things
are
going
to
happen
in
this
country
and
especially
in
Kansas
because
our
kids
are
growing
up
to
become
impressive
and
hardworking
young
adults.
