Friends,
Merry Christmas!
As I provide you with information relating to my office and what is
happening in Congress, I am delighted to extend my wishes for a very
merry Christmas, season's greetings, and a happy New Year. I am
grateful to my colleague from Michigan, Candice Miller, who has lifted
the ban on holiday greetings in congressional communications to
constituents
in her position as Chairman of the House Franking Commission.

Proposed Budget Deal: In Exchange for More Spending, We Get Higher
Taxes?
I joined many of my colleagues in sending a letter
to House leadership
before the announcement of the new budget deal. The new deal increases
spending and taxes by billions of dollars, and it violates the spending
limits
set by the sequester
in the Budget Control Act. It passed 332-94, and I voted no.
While the sequester-a mere slowdown in federal spending-is not ideal,
it is a minimal reform that should be kept in place until real reforms
are achieved. Congressional Republicans and Democrats need to come
together to compromise on the biggest areas of federal spending: Social
Security, military spending, and Medicare.
Director Clapper Should Be Prosecuted
My friend, Representative Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI), has called on the
Department of Justice to fire and prosecute Director of National
Intelligence James Clapper
. Clapper lied to
Congress and the American people-a federal offense-when he claimed
earlier this year that the National Security Agency (NSA) does "not
wittingly" engage in bulk surveillance of American citizens.
I joined Rep. Sensenbrenner, Rep. John Conyers (D-MI), Rep. Zoe Lofgren
(D-CA), and many others to introduce H.R. 3361, the USA FREEDOM Act, to
reform parts of the USA PATRIOT Act that have been used to surveil
Americans' telephone records and Internet activity. The bill continues
to gain bipartisan support
, and I am very
optimistic
the House will debate
substantial, comprehensive surveillance reform next year.
In other news, NSA agents have been playing massive multiplayer online
video games to, uh, thwart terrorism-with little success
.
Reducing Roadblocks to Domestic Energy Production
On Wednesday, November 20, I voted yes on H.R. 1965, the Federal Lands
Jobs and Energy Security Act of 2013
. The bill combines
five bills that are aimed at increasing the supply of energy produced
in the United States. Among other things, the bill requires the federal
government to lease more of its land for energy production, and it
streamlines the permitting process for oil and gas drilling. Americans
should be able to access the vast resources available on federal land.
Reducing roadblocks to domestic energy production would help make our
fuel supply more dependable and affordable. H.R. 1965
passed 228-192.
White House Tours
The White House has announced that White House public tours have
resumed. If you plan to visit Washington, D.C., you are welcome to
contact my office to request tours
of the U.S. Capitol
, the White House
, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing
, or the Library of Congress
. For those planning a
visit during spring break, please make your requests as soon as
possible for best results. You may also visit my office in 114 Cannon
House Office Building for House and Senate gallery passes. We look
forward to seeing you!
Internship
My Washington, D.C., and Grand Rapids offices are looking for interns
for 2014. More information is available at

Best wishes in the new year!
