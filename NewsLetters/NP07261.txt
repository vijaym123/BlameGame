SERVING THE 34TH DISTRICT OF TEXAS
Share
Dear Friends,
Yesterday, SpaceX announced that Boca Chica Beach will serve as the location for their new commercial rocket launch facility which will include launches of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy orbital vertical launch vehicles. Along with these launches, up to 12 rockets may be sent into space each year, both for private industry and possibly NASA.

For many years, city, county, state, and federal officials have worked with SpaceX to make this announcement a reality.
Though South Texas was competing with Florida and Georgia as potential launch sites, Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX, saw the potential of our region through his vision of continuing space exploration.

The establishment of a SpaceX launch facility will greatly benefit the South Texas economy, creating approximately 300 jobs and putting capital investment into the local economy.
Along with impacting the economy, this move will provide unique educational opportunities for students, scientists, and researchers.
Currently, there is a proposed project between the University of Texas at Brownsville and SpaceX, STARGATE, which will give students and faculty access to cutting-edge equipment to track satellites and spacecraft.
I am very excited to have SpaceX in South Texas.
