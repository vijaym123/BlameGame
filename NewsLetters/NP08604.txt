Dear Friend,
Happy Father's Day to all our Dads.
Thank you for your leadership and courage. Thank you for your example
in words and action. Thank you for being the rock of your family and
community.
I often say that that the gravest problem we face as a country and a
culture, even beyond our ever-increasing debt load, or our coasting
education system, is the deterioration of the family unit. By our Dad's
words and actions, and their courage, patience and example, we will
Keep the Republic.
Proverbs 10:9
The man of integrity walks securely,
but he who takes crooked paths will be found out.
I hope your day is as good as mine.
Sincerely,
Todd Rokita
Representative Rokita with his wife, Kathy and two boys,
Teddy and Ryan.
