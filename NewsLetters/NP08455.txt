Majority of the House Supports Email
Privacy
Im excited to announce that my
bill, H.R. 1852, the Email Privacy Act, now has 218 cosponsors, which
indicates that a majority of the House supports this legislation. The
legislation is vital to protecting Americans Fourth Amendment rights to
security of personal electronic correspondence. Its clear more and
more Americans arent okay with law enforcement officials and
government agencies, such as the SEC and IRS, accessing their digital
communications without a warrant. I will continue to add cosponsors to this
important bill.

The Fight Against Pancreatic
Cancer
I enjoyed visiting with Kansas City Pancreatic Cancer Action
Network advocates, including Kansas State Representative Marvin Kleeb, in my
Washington, D.C. office last week. We discussed the important role
that federal research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and
National Cancer Institute (NCI) plays in developing a cure for one of the
deadliest cancers. Im proud to represent the University of Kansas
Cancer Center, a designated National Cancer Institute, in our district.
Together we can work to find a cure and keep stomping on pancreatic
cancer.
Thank you, Representative Kleeb and Kansas City Pancreatic Action Network
advocates, for your advocacy.
Communicator of the Year
It was
such an honor to receive the Communicator of the Year award from the
National Speech &amp; Debate Association
Friday
evening. The national conference and competition was held in Overland
Park, bringing more than 7,000 students and educators to our community.
I attended two national competitions as a student at Hutchinson High
School, and as a Member of Congress it was exciting to return and stand
before thousands of high school debaters. Congratulations to all
those who won awards in their respective
categories!
Speaking at the
National Speech &amp; Debate
Association
conference and receiving Communicator of the Year was a true
honor.
House
Passes 2015 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill
The House approved the Department of Defense Appropriations
Act on Friday with a bipartisan vote of 340-73. I was happy to support
this vital piece of legislation as it provides resources essential to
keeping our nation safe. The bill funds military operations overseas,
supports the brave men and women who serve our country, and prohibits
the transfer of prisoners from Guantanamo Bay, without the approval of
Congress.
As a member of the Committee on Appropriations, it is
my goal to sufficiently fund our Armed Services, while reducing
spending on unused and ineffective programs.
House Appropriations Committee Passes Energy
and Water Appropriations Act
The House
Appropriations Committee approved the FY15 Energy and Water Appropriations Act by
a bipartisan vote on Wednesday. I support this legislation that cuts
$50 million in funding from last year and provides adequate funds to
secure our nuclear weapons stockpile and create jobs by providing the
resources to build water infrastructure projects.
The
legislation contains a provision that prohibits the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from expanding the
definition of navigable waters to include streams, ponds, isolated
wetlands, and other various small bodies of water, even places where water
isnt running year-round. Allowing these agencies to create burdensome
regulations negatively impacts Kansass farmers and ranchers and
raises costs for consumers across the state. I will continue to work to
rein in the Corps of Engineers and EPA and protect our local
communities.
From the
Washington Post : " Abdication has a
price "
Increasing violence in Iraq is a top news
story this week. As Congress and the Administration work to find a
peaceful solution to this crisis, an Op-Ed from the
Washington
Post
by Charles Krauthammer,
Abdication has a
price , caught my eye and I want to share it with you.

Missing
IRS Emails
Last week, the IRS
claimed it was unable to generate two years worth of emails from Lois
Lerner. When Congress learned the IRS was targeting conservative groups, the
President promised he and his Administration would work with Congress
to get to the bottom of the IRS scandal. This is becoming the
Presidents mode of operation: another scandal, another broken promise,
refusal to work with Congress, resulting in no action to fix the broken
IRS. Americans are waiting for answers. Instead of reading innocent
American's email messages, the IRS should focus on finding their own. It's
time for the President to work with Congress and find these emails and
records.
