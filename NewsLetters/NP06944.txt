Join me in calling for Koch-Free Elections to stop billionaires from bankrolling campaigns &gt;&gt;
Citizens United
opened the door to unlimited campaign spending from outside groups. No one&rsquo;s taken advantage of this more than the Koch Brothers. They&rsquo;re expected to spend almost
$125 million
this election. That&rsquo;s absurd. David, add your name to demand Congress pass campaign finance reform to shut out dark money from elections:
David --
It&rsquo;s no secret the Koch brothers are coming for us.
A recent article said, &ldquo;The Koch Brothers have their eyes on Illinois,&rdquo; targeting the closest races in the state. Races like ours.
I&rsquo;m disgusted by how much billionaires are spending to buy elected officials that will serve their interests. David, I believe elections should be about the voters, not who can spend more money. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m demanding that Congress pass meaningful campaign finance reform. David, will you click here to stand with me in calling for Koch-Free Elections?
