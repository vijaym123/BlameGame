Dear Friends,
No county in West
Virginia is immune to the scourge of methamphetamine addition and
trafficking. Meth use and manufacturing pose a grave danger to our
communities, and our local law enforcement officials have worked diligently
to fight the spread of meth.
I'm pleased to announce that
the state of West Virginia will receive a $1 million grant from the COPS
Anti-Methamphetamine Program to combat the making and distribution of
meth. These much-needed funds will help our state continue to address
the production, trafficking and use of meth in our
communities.
This competitive two-year grant program provides funds to state
law enforcement agencies to respond to the manufacture and
distribution of meth. Ten states received a total of $6 million in grants, with
West Virginia receiving the largest grant.
WORLD HABITAT
DAY
Volunteers
gathered at the State Capitol on Monday to build the walls for a
Habitat home for a Huntington Area Habitat for Humanity partner family. It
was my privilege to join them in their work and share my thoughts about
the good work Habitat does in helping West Virginia's families
achieve homeownership and stability.
SAYING NO TO DOMESTIC ABUSE IN
SPORTS
On Monday, I joined 56 fellow members of Congress
in a bipartisan effort to strengthen professional sports leagues
responses to violent crimes.
In letters to the commissioners of
the National Football League, Major League Baseball, National
Basketball Association, National Hockey League and Major League Soccer, we
called on the leagues to take a strong stand to prevent and respond
effectively to domestic violence, sexual assault, child abuse, and all
violent crimes.
When these vicious crimes are not properly
addressed and when offenders are not held accountable, the cycles of
violence continue, victims remain in constant jeopardy and fear, and the
very lives of women and children are at stake. We urge you in the
strongest possible terms to use your profound platform to move our
society toward a future where violence against women and children is not
acceptable, we wrote.
A PDF of the five letters is available
here .
Thank you for reading my
weekly
e-newsletter, and as always, you can join in the conversation on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Shelley
