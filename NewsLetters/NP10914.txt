Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Families from all over Central Florida visited Washington this week as they enjoyed spring break and an educational vacation. It was a pleasure to meet the many individuals, families, and groups that came through my office to take pictures and receive a tour of the Capitol building provided by my staff. If you are planning to visit Washington, you can

I also met with many organizations and constituent groups who were traveling to Washington. On Wednesday, I welcomed Diana Bolivar, the President of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Metro Orlando and other local representatives from the Hispanic Chamber and the Hispanic Business Initiative Fund of Florida. For nearly 20 years, the Hispanic Chamber has been a prominent business-related entity in Central Florida, and it has been a pleasure to work with them on behalf of the Hispanic community.

Healthcare remains a prominent focus in Washington as we seek to provide patient-centered care to individuals and families. This week, I met with John Lord, the Chairman of the Board of Directors for Nemours, and other leaders and directors who provided an update on the Nemours Childrens Hospital in Orlando. Earlier this year, I took a tour of the Orlando facility, and was glad to see the dedicated care and service that the staff and leadership provide to our community.
During the 2014 Healthcare Innovations Expo hosted by the Healthcare Leadership Council in Washington this week, I was presented with the Healthcare Innovation Award recognizing my continual support of advanced technological and treatment progress in the medical field.

As we continue to discuss improvements to our nations infrastructure network in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I met with local representatives from both the Canaveral Port Authority &amp; the Florida Airports Council this week to discuss how to best support and improve Floridas port and airways systems. As a Committee, we continue to hold hearings and consider legislation that will expand our infrastructure capacities and build the support system for a strong and successful economy.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Several years ago, a constituent from Orlando was involved in an accident that resulted in an early onset of arthritis throughout her back. The constituent filed for Social Security Disability, and requested a hearing to review her case. When the constituent was unable to get in touch with the Social Security Administration (SSA), she contacted my office and requested that we follow up on her pending claim. After reaching out to SSA, my staff was informed that there was no hearing request for her. My office was able to forward a copy of the hearing request to SSA that the constituent provided my office. Due to their oversight, SSA expedited the hearing date, and after careful review, issued a favorable decision.
Constituent Services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
The deadline for filing federal tax returns is just around the corner.
Leading up to April 15th, millions of Americans will be forced to try and make sense of our complicated and antiquated tax code. Many will invest hard earned money in professional tax services in exchange for the peace of mind that the IRS wont come knocking with an audit down the road.
Others will not have that luxury and will instead invest millions of hours while having to try and go it alone when preparing their tax return.
It shouldnt have to be this hard.
Would you support efforts to simplify and flatten our existing tax code, even if it meant certain deductions were repealed in exchange for a lower overall rate and simpler filing system?

Legislative Update:
Several years ago, policies were implemented to make Medicare reimbursement rates correspond to the growth of the economy. With the global downturn, this system collapsed, and medical professionals who assist Medicare patients began receiving decreased payments for services performed. This year, doctors treating Medicare patients faced a 24% cut in their government reimbursements.
Last Thursday, I supported H.R. 4302, the
Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 , to protect physicians who care for Medicare patients. This piece of legislation repeals this cut to benefit both Medicare and Medicaid patients by ensuring that they have access to quality health professionals who will care for their needs.
