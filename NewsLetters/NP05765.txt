Dear Friend,
In the blur of attack ads and mudslinging of election season, we often lose sight of what really matters in all these races:
the issues important to families like yours.
Everyone has different ideas about what is most important -- protecting Medicare and Social Security, medical bills or college costs -- because you are the ones affected most by our decisions in Congress.
You&rsquo;ve heard from me a lot in the past few weeks. Today, I want to hear from you. Tell me which issues matter most to you, to your family and friends, and to your neighborhood. Take our online survey and share your thoughts.
The political climate in Washington is frustrating. I served in the House when the Tea Party took over, and I&rsquo;ve seen the damage their obstructionism has caused. But no matter how much they obstruct progress, I&rsquo;m going to keep fighting to make life better for the middle class.
We have work to do -- we need to work to create more and better paying jobs, guarantee equal pay for women and protect women&rsquo;s health rights, roll back
Citizens United , and take bold action on climate change. Today, I&rsquo;m asking
you
what affects you most. Which issues should take priority? Click here to tell us what you think.
Thanks for your support, and thanks for your help as election day approaches.
