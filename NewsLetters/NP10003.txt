Judiciary Committee Passes Bills to Combat Human Trafficking
Human trafficking is an extensive problem worldwide.
Even
though many of these crimes occur outside of the public eye, the impacts are very real. According to the FBI, sex trafficking is the fastest growing
business of organized crime and the third largest criminal enterprise in the world. The Department of Justice has noted that it is more profitable for
a trafficker to prostitute a child than to commit other crimes such as dealing in drugs. That is because drugs can only be sold once, whereas minor
children can be, and are, prostituted multiple times a day. While Congress has strengthened our laws to combat human trafficking, there is still work
to do to put an end to these heinous crimes. This week the House
Judiciary Committee approved three bills to help combat the growing problem of human trafficking in the United States and provide needed services to
victims.
The
Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act
(H.R. 3530)
boosts support and protection for domestic human trafficking victims by
increasing and streamlining law enforcement resources, enhancing victims&rsquo; services, and strengthening our laws to ensure that both buyers and
sellers engaged in sex trafficking are held accountable for their crimes.
The
Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act
(H.R. 3610) provides incentives to states to adopt
safe harbor laws that treat trafficked minors as victims, rather than as criminals or delinquents.
The bill also provides an avenue for victims to
access job skill training so that they can begin to rebuild their lives.
The third bill, the
Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act
(H.R. 4225), criminalizes those who knowingly advertise or profit from advertisements that offer the commercial exploitation of minors and trafficking
victims. It goes without saying that no
child should be subjected to this horrifying and inhumane violence.
Sadly, it happens across the country every single day.
As a father myself, I
understand the need for legislation that will hold everyone involved in these crimes accountable, whether they sell, buy, or market these crimes to
potential buyers.
All three of these bills were approved by the House Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support, and I urge the House to take these
measures up as soon as possible.

Today, I joined in calling on Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a
Special Counsel to investigate the Internal Revenue Service&rsquo;s (IRS) targeting of conservative groups. Over a year has passed since we first
learned that the IRS had been singling out certain conservative groups for further review as they applied for tax exempt status and today no one has
yet been held accountable for this political plan to silence the voices of groups representing millions of Americans. To restore trust in the
investigation, Attorney General Holder should immediately appoint an independent Special Counsel to probe this unsettling
issue.

Why is patent reform needed?
Take a minute to watch a prime example of how frivolous
lawsuits from patent trolls impact businesses. My bill, the
Innovation Act , would discourage this type of abuse. Click
