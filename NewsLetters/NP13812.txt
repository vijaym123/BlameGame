Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
Yesterday our nation paused to remember and honor the thousands of
Americans who died in the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.
Though it has been 72 years since the attack, we have not forgotten the
effect it had on our country nor the service of the "Greatest
Generation" who answered the call of duty and fought to preserve the
freedoms we have today.
As we remember those who gave their lives on this day 72 years ago,
Carol and I send our thoughts and prayers to all members of our Armed
Forces and their loved ones.
This week, we also were saddened to hear of the passing of Nelson
Mandela, South Africa's first democratically elected president. Our
prayers are with his family, the people of South Africa and all who
mourn his passing.
Financial Services Committee Corner: Battling Beltway Bureaucrats
Unfortunately, we have a situation where Washington-based bureaucrats
at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) are incorrectly
claiming that Bath County, Kentucky should be considered "non-rural"
for purposes of lending rules that limit access to credit in the
community. But it is clear to any of us who have ever been to Bath
County that it is certainly rural, and has even been called "one of the
most rural places in the United States" by our Commissioner of the
Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions, Charles Vice.
Government bureaucrats don't always know best!
And they certainly don't know our local communities better than we do.
That's why on Wednesday, the Committee on Financial Services
Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit held a
hearing focused on legislation I introduced
that would provide rural areas like Bath County the
right to petition to be properly reclassified as "rural" and relieve
them from burdensome regulations that limit their ability to lend and
help create jobs in their communities.
Kentucky's Sixth District resident and fifth generation banker, Mr.
Thomas Richards from Owingsville Banking Company, testified on behalf
of my bill, H.R. 2672, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Rural
Designation Petition and Correction Act.

knowledge about the negative impact resulting from Washington-based
bureaucrats' decision to incorrectly consider Bath County 'non-rural'
for purposes of lending rules that limit access to credit in the
community

Signature Industry Spotlight: Honoring Our Coal Miners
As Kentuckians, we know better than most that coal keeps the lights on.
Modern life is only possible thanks to the hard work and dedication of
our coal miners.
And while we don't need a specific day to remind us to celebrate and
honor their critical contributions to the our standard of living, I
hope that today, you will take a moment to thank America's coal miners
who produce the fuel to provide nearly 40 percent of the electricity
used in the United States.

Listening to Kentuckians
On Wednesday, I was honored to record a holiday greeting to our
soldiers serving all over the world.
It was great to meet with University of Kentucky President Eli
Capilouto in my Washington office this week! We had a good discussion
about ways we can continue to promote UK and its research programs.
Friday, I spoke to a crowd of 200 constituents at Commerce Lexington's
monthly public policy lunch, updating them on the situation in DC and
sharing some of the stories I have heard from residents of Kentucky's
Sixth Congressional District. I discussed my efforts to help create a
better environment for job creation through promotion of Kentucky's
signature industries, and the need to reform spending programs before
they crowd out other priorities like transportation, infrastructure,
education and national defense.
Later in the day, I toured the Lexmark International, Inc. headquarters
and appreciated their research and development team showing me some of
their new innovative approaches to document management. We also had a
great discussion about legislation I cosponsored, H.R. 2084, the
Partnership to Build America Act.
Casework Corner: Honoring the Sacrifice
A Madison County constituent reached out to our office requesting
assistance with receiving survivors benefits following her husband's
fatal case of Post-Traumatic Stress resulting from his military
service.
She had been unable to obtain the assistance she was due from the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). We worked closely with the VA to
make sure this widow's benefits were processed in a timely manner as
she was barely getting by and was on the verge of losing her home. She
was also able to receive burial benefits to lessen the burden of her
husband's funeral costs.
While we can never repay the loss this widow has suffered, we were
grateful to be able to lessen the burden she will have to carry after
her husband gave the ultimate sacrifice.
If you or anyone you know is having trouble navigating the federal
government bureaucracy, my office is ready to help
. Whenever we
can be of service, or if you have questions or comments about our
federal government, please contact my offices or visit us during our
monthly office hours in your county
.
Furthermore, I encourage veterans and active service members in the
Sixth District of Kentucky to get involved with my Veterans Coalition
so we can
continue to work together to help members of the military, their
family, and friends.
Please continue to let me know your thoughts and concerns about issues
facing our community, and also I hope you will forward my weekly
newsletter to your friends, family and neighbors.
You may also visit my website

home in the Sixth District and in Washington.
Thank you and have a great week!

Report
Dear
Friend,
Yesterday
our
nation
paused
to
remember
and
honor
the
thousands
of
Americans
who
died
in
the
attack
on
Pearl
Harbor on
December
7,
1941. Though
it
has
been
72
years
since
the
attack,
we
have
not
forgotten
the
effect
it
had
on
our
country
nor
the
service
of
the
"Greatest
Generation"
who
answered
the
call
of
duty
and
fought
to
preserve
the
freedoms
we
have
today.
As
we
remember
those
who
gave
their
lives
on
this
day
72
years
ago,
Carol
and
I
send
our
thoughts
and
prayers
to
all
members
of
our
Armed
Forces
and
their
loved
ones.
This
week,
we
also
were
saddened
to
hear
of
the
passing
of
Nelson
Mandela,
South
Africa&#8217;s
first
democratically
elected
president.
Our prayers
are
with
his
family,
the
people
of
South
Africa
and
all
who
mourn
his
passing.
Financial

Committee
Corner: Battling

Unfortunately,
we
have
a
situation
where
Washington-based
bureaucrats
at
the
Consumer
Financial
Protection
Bureau
(CFPB)
are
incorrectly
claiming
that
Bath
County,
Kentucky
should
be
considered
&#8220;non-rural&#8221;
for
purposes
of
lending
rules
that
limit
access
to
credit
in
the
community.
But
it
is
clear
to
any
of
us
who
have
ever
been
to
Bath
County
that
it
is
certainly
rural,
and
has
even
been
called
&#8220;one
of
the
most
rural
places
in
the
United
States&#8221;
by
our
Commissioner
of
the
Kentucky
Department
of
Financial
Institutions,
Charles
Vice. Government
bureaucrats
don&#8217;t
always
know
best! And
they
certainly
don&#8217;t
know
our
local communities
better
than
we
do.
That&#8217;s
why on
Wednesday,
the
Committee
on
Financial

Subcommittee
on
Financial

and
Consumer
Credit
held
a

focused

I
introduced
that

relieve
them
from
burdensome
regulations
that
limit
their
ability
to
lend
and
help
create
jobs
in
their
communities.
Kentucky&#8217;s
Sixth

fifth

Mr.
Thomas
Richards
from

Company,
testified
on

the

Act.

Listening

On
Wednesday,
I
was
honored
to
record a
holiday
greeting
to
our
soldiers
serving
all
over
the
world.
It
was
great
to
meet
with
University
of
Kentucky
President
Eli
Capilouto
in
my
Washington
office
this
week!
We
had
a
good
discussion
about
ways
we
can
continue
to
promote
UK
and
its
research
programs.
Friday,
I
spoke
to
a
crowd
of
200
constituents
at
Commerce
Lexington's
monthly
public
policy
lunch,
updating
them
on
the
situation
in
DC
and
sharing
some
of
the
stories
I
have
heard
from
residents
of
Kentucky's
Sixth
Congressional
District. I
discussed
my
efforts
to
help
create
a
better
environment
for
job
creation
through
promotion
of
Kentucky's
signature
industries,
and
the
need
to
reform
spending
programs
before
they
crowd
out
other
priorities
like
transportation,
infrastructure,
education
and
national
defense.
Later
in
the
day,
I
toured
the
Lexmark
International,
Inc.
headquarters
and
appreciated
their
research
and
development
team
showing
me
some
of
their
new
innovative
approaches
to
document
management. We
also
had
a
great
discussion
about
legislation
I
cosponsored, H.R.
2084,
the
Partnership
to
Build
America
Act.
Casework
Corner:
Honoring
the
Sacrifice
A
Madison
County
constituent
reached
out
to
our
office
requesting
assistance
with
receiving
survivors
benefits
following
her
husband&#8217;s
fatal
case
of
Post-Traumatic
Stress
resulting
from
his
military
service.
She
had
been
unable
to
obtain
the
assistance
she
was
due
from
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA).
We
worked
closely
with
the
VA
to
make
sure
this
widow&#8217;s
benefits
were
processed
in
a
timely
manner
as
she
was
barely
getting
by
and
was
on
the
verge
of
losing
her
home.
She
was
also
able
to
receive
burial
benefits
to
lessen
the
burden
of
her
husband&#8217;s
funeral
costs.
While
we
can
never
repay
the
loss
this
widow
has
suffered,
we
were
grateful
to
be
able
to
lessen
the
burden
she
will
have
to
carry
after
her
husband
gave
the
ultimate
sacrifice.
If
you
or
anyone
you
know
is
having
trouble
navigating
the
federal
government
bureaucracy,
my
office
is
ready
to
help .
Whenever
we
can

please

Furthermore,
I
encourage
veterans
and
active

members
in
the
Sixth

of
Kentucky
to
get
involved
with
my
Veterans
Coalition
so
we
can
continue
to
work
together
to
help
members
of
the
military,

and

Please
continue
to
