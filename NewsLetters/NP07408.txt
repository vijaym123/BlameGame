Dear Fellow
Nevadan,
This July marks the 24th anniversary of the passage of the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA). Since it was signed into law in 1990, the ADA
has strengthened our nation by promoting equal rights, equal
opportunities, and independence for individuals with disabilities in Nevada
and throughout the US. The ADA was a landmark civil rights achievement
in the United States, and it inspired an international movement to
protect the civil rights of individuals with disabilities world-wide. This
month, we remind ourselves of the promise the ADA seeks to fulfill:
to grant individuals with disabilities the freedom to fully participate
as members of their communities.
Through the ADA, barriers
to public accommodations, employment, transportation, public
services, and telecommunications have been diminished. Children can no longer
be prevented from attending a school, afterschool, or daycare program
based on their disabilities. Individuals can no longer be denied
employment, fair compensation, or be discharged simply because of a
disability. The protections of the ADA are common-sense and so vital to the
interest of democracy, which demands every free citizens ability to
participate. That is why I was so proud to cosponsor legislation in 2008
to strengthen the ADA and further protect the rights of persons with
disabilities.
While we have made great strides to ensure
that the civil rights of all Americans are protected, there is still
work to be done. Ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of
Persons with Disabilities, which was inspired by the ADA, was shamefully
voted down by Republicans in the last Congress. The Foreign Relations
Committee recently passed the treaty out of Committee and we are working
hard to get the 67 votes needed for passage on the Senate
floor.
