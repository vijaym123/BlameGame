Dear David,
Today marks World Mental Health Day.
Approximately
one in four
adults suffer from a
diagnosable mental disorder each year across America.
It's so
important that we work to remove the stigma associated with behavioral
health treatment and start treating mental health illnesses like
physical health.
As part of National Mental Health Month this May,
I
visited
nine facilities across Missouri to
learn more from our health care professionals and community leaders about
the ways that we treat mental health challenges.
I
introduced the " Caring for America's Heroes Act ," to
bring mental health treatment in-line with the way physical injuries are
treated under TRICARE. I also worked with Senator Stabenow to
successfully
pass
a version of the bipartisan " Excellence in Mental Health Act ," which will expand access
to community mental health services and strengthen the quality of care
provided to those living with mental illness.
Please visit
my website to find out more about my efforts to improve behavioral
health treatment.
This is a
critical issue, and I'll keep fighting to ensure everyone - including our
veterans, active duty military, and families - has access to timely,
quality care.
I hope you'll join this important discussion
online by sharing your thoughts on my
Facebook
page,
on
Twitter ,
Instagram , and
on
YouTube .
Sincere
regards,
Washington
