This week the House and Senate reached an agreement on a budget that balances in 10 years, doesnt raise taxes and confronts the $18 trillion debt crisis that threatens the economic security of every American. This budget supports a healthier economy and strengthens economic growth, while protecting Social Security and Medicare and making government more efficient, effective and accountable.
This budget will lead to more than $400 billion in new economic growth over the next decade and add 1.2 million jobs, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Washington must stop spending money we dont have and pay its bills like every American and business.
I supported this balanced budget in the House and offered my own balanced budget amendment to the Constitution earlier this year. Ill keep fighting for common-sense solutions.
Leadership means making tough decisions. President Obama has yet to offer a balanced budget during his terms in office. Before he and his allies criticize our plan to balance the budget, they need to offer their own.
In addition to agreeing to a balanced budget I successfully continued my efforts this week to remove government barriers to the development of hydropower in the U.S. by sponsoring an amendment to H.R. 2028, the Energy-Water Appropriations bill for FY2016 that would restore funding for this vital energy resource. Hydropower is the largest source of clean, renewable energy in the U.S., creating thousands of jobs (including many in the 4th District) and providing power to millions of Americans at low cost.
This bipartisan amendment increases funding for hydropower development - without adding to our debt. Hydropower is vitally important to reducing our dependence on foreign oil and unlike some other renewable energy sources; its reliable and available in every region of the country.
Hydropower is our nations most available, reliable, affordable and sustainable energy source. Of the approximately 80,000 dams in the U.S., approximately 3 percent currently generate hydropower. This represents a tremendous opportunity for our nations energy needs and is vitally important to reducing our dependence on foreign oil.
The U.S. produces more electricity from hydropower than from any other renewable electricity source, accounting for 56 percent of renewable generation in 2012 and 7 percent of the nations overall electricity generation. Utilizing new technology at existing hydro sites represents an opportunity for enhancing this infrastructure and generating more sustainable power.
Finally this week I introduced legislation, H.R. 2077, to prevent the Secretary of Transportation from unilaterally raising insurance minimums on the motorcoach and school transportation industries. Congress historically has set minimum insurance limits and should not abdicate its regulatory and legislative responsibilities here.
Touring Bailey Motorcoach in York County
The motorcoach and school transportation industries have an exceptionally high safety record. If we unnecessarily raise minimum insurance rates we'll only force out of business companies with an extremely safe track record; this is not the proper role of the federal government. We shouldn't look to penalize companies that work hard and play by the rules.
H.R. 2077 requires the Secretary of Transportation to conduct a comprehensive study of minimum financial responsibility requirements for motor carriers of passengers. This study will show that the motor carriers have an exceptionally high safety rating and should not have an unnecessary increase in minimum financial responsibility requirements.
Sincerely,
Scott Perry
