FEATURED STORY
A Major Step Forward for Community Mental Health
Advocates from mental health organizations, veterans' organizations, and
law enforcement joined Senator Stabenow to celebrate passage of
legislation that is a huge step forward in the effort to expand
community mental health services, reduce the stigma around mental
illness, and achieve true parity between physical and mental health
care. The legislation, a version of Stabenow's Excellence in Mental
Health Act, will establish pilot programs in eight states for community
health centers to improve access to quality care by offering services
like 24-hour psychiatric care and integrated treatment for mental
illness and substance abuse. "This is a critically important issue that
touches all of our families in some way and this legislation is one of
the most significant steps in decades to expand access to care. I'm glad
that both the House and the Senate were able to come together and act in
a bipartisan way to strengthen mental health services," Stabenow said.

WHAT YOU MAY HAVE MISSED
Senate Panel Clears Way for Extending Mortgage Forgiveness Tax Relief
for Homeowners
Help is on the way for homeowners who have modified their mortgages to
remain in their homes. A two-year renewal of Senator Stabenow's Mortgage
Forgiveness Tax Relief Act is among the package of tax measures the
Senate Finance Committee passed today. Unbelievably, under current law,
when a bank works with a family to lower their mortgage costs, the
family can get hit with an enormous tax bill because the IRS considers
that mortgage reduction as "income." First enacted in 2007, Senator
Stabenow's mortgage forgiveness law stops the IRS from counting that as
income. According to the Urban Institute, the law has helped more than 7
million families avoid an enormous tax bill. With an estimated 6.4
million homeowners still underwater on their mortgages-including 250,000
Michigan families-- it is critical that the law be extended to provide
certainty to families, our housing markets, and our overall economy.
"This is not just about fairness for homeowners," Senator Stabenow said.
"This is about keeping the housing recovery alive. The last thing we
want to do is to tax people into foreclosure, where they feel that their
only option is to default and walk away from their homes." The
bipartisan provision now heads to the Senate floor, where Senator
Stabenow and Senator Heller of Nevada will continue their work to make
sure it becomes law.

WHAT
YOU
MAY
HAVE
MISSED
Senate
Panel
Clears
Way
for
Extending
Mortgage
Forgiveness
Tax
Relief
for
Homeowners
Help
is
on
the
way
for
homeowners
who
have
modified
their
mortgages
to
remain
in
their
homes.
A
two-year
renewal
of
Senator
Stabenow&#8217;s
Mortgage
Forgiveness
Tax
Relief
Act
is
among
the
package
of
tax
measures
the
Senate
Finance
Committee
passed
today.
Unbelievably,
under
current
law,
when
a
bank
works
with
a
family
to
lower
their
mortgage
costs,
the
family
can
get
hit
with
an
enormous
tax
bill
because
the
IRS
considers
that
mortgage
reduction
as
&#8220;income.&#8221;
First
enacted
in
2007,
Senator
Stabenow&#8217;s
mortgage
forgiveness
law
stops
the
IRS
from
counting
that
as
income.
According
to
the
Urban
Institute,
the
law
has
helped
more
than
7
million
families
avoid
an
enormous
tax
bill.
With
an

homeowners
still

on
their
mortgages&#8212;including
250,000
Michigan
families--
it
is

the
law
be

our
housing
markets,
and
our
overall
economy.
&#8220;This

&#8220;This
is

keeping
the

last
thing
we
want
to
do
is
to
tax

that
their

option
is
to
default
and
walk
away
from
their
homes.&#8221;
