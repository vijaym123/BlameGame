HIGHLIGHTS IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM

Specialist Marcelino King Biz, Jr. of Tinian was awarded the Purple Heart for injuries sustained in Afghanistan earlier this month. He is currently receiving treatment at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. I visited SPC Biz and his family to thank him for his heroism and service, to check on his progress, and to meet with Walter Reed officials to ensure he is getting the best care possible. Present were his parents Marcelino Biz and Sylvia King Biz, sister Jovie K. Aquiningoc, and friend Raybrent Iglecias. Thank you, to the Biz family for your service and sacrifice. Our thoughts and prayers are with you, SPC Biz, for a speedy recovery.

Not an interstellar lightship, but the rare dumbo octopus captured in video
by the ocean research vessel Okeanos on its current voyage. Dr. Alan Leonardi briefed the congressional office this week on the work of Okeanos and other aspects of the Office of Ocean Exploration and Research, which he leads, at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A sister ship, Hi'ialakai, explored our islands of Maug in 2014 , looking at how ocean acidification by volcanic activity has affected the coral reef ecosystem. A further expedition to Maug is planned for 2016. Teachers will want to check out the lesson plans OER has developed for students in grades 5-12 . And students - of all ages - will want to explore the sights available on this federal agency's website , including live streams from submersibles, seeking out strange new worlds and new life, where no one has gone before.
Ocean Champions support Fishing Economy Improvement Act - Ocean Champions , a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting our oceans, came out this week in support of my bill , reauthorizing the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Ocean Champions wrote to Members of Congress urging them to back H.R. 1826, the Fishing Economy Improvement Act , which I introduced last week. "H.R. 1826 would sustain the basic tenets of the [Magnuson-Stevens Act] that have been instrumental in re-establishing many of America's fisheries as the healthy, robust, and productive resources they should be, and in putting many other depleted fisheries on track to recovery," wrote David Wilmot, Ph.D., President of Ocean Champions. "For fishermen, for fishing communities, and for the oceans - we urge you to support H.R. 1826." Among the notable Board members of the group are conservationist David Rockefeller, Jr., oceanographer Philippe Cousteau, and executive director of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Julie Packard.

In education funding separate is not equal for insular areas - Funding for our insular areas schools and for schools managed by the Bureau of Indian Education at the Interior Department is separated from the normal distribution of Elementary and Secondary Education Act Title I-A grants to states. And, as the Supreme Court ruled in the landmark case Brown v. Board of Education, separate is not equal. I made that point this week at a hearing of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education. Title I-A funding is supposed to help areas, where family incomes are lower than the rest of our nation, give students in grades K-12 the opportunity for a U.S.-standard education. I have introduced legislation, H.R. 851 , in this Congress that would integrate funding for island schools into the mainstream and treat us more like the U.S. states.
Responding faster to veterans disability claims - Congressional staff responding to veterans, who have overdue disability claims, can also face long waits before the Veterans Administration provides information about the claims. One way around that problem would be to give congressional staff direct access to the VA claims database. For that reason 63 of us in the House of Representatives have written to VA Secretary Robert McDonald requesting read-only access to the VA claims database . Allowing our staff to view the database would mean we could more quickly tell veterans the status of their claim. It would also mean VA staff-time could be used to process claims, not to answer congressional inquiries. Of course, congressional staff would have to be trained and certified to access the system and no access to private records could occur without the permission of the veteran. Anything we can do to get services to veterans faster would be an improvement.
Record number of entries for Congressional Art Competition - 42 student-artists have submitted entries for the 2015 Congressional Art Competition . That is the largest number of entrants since the Northern Mariana Islands gained a seat in Congress and became eligible for this event. Next step is selection of a winner by a panel of local artists. Entries are graded for originality, technique, communication, and effectiveness. The winner will be announced in the coming weeks and her or his work will then be displayed here at the U.S. Capitol for a year, alongside the work of high school students from most of the other 440 congressional districts. Thanks to all the students, who participated in this year's competition, and to our panel of judges, who now face some difficult decisions.
Join the 4th Annual Healthy Lunchtime Challenge - Another competition - still open for submissions - is First Lady Michelle Obama's Healthy Lunchtime Challenge. Kids aged 8 to 12 from around the country submit lunch recipes following these MyPlate
nutrition guidelines. And a healthy food ambassador from each state and territory is then selected to be flown to Washington with a parent or guardian to attend the Kids' "State Dinner," hosted by Mrs. Obama at the White House. Fruits and vegetables should make up about half of the recipe, alongside whole grains, lean meats, or low-fat dairy foods. Submissions must include information about how and why the recipes were created and the dish should be healthy, creative, affordable, delicious, and original. A parent or legal guardian is required to fill out the entry form
on his or her child's behalf. Deadline for entries is April 30, 2015. For more information, go to http://www.pbs.org/parents/lunchtimechallenge/home/.
NMPASI awarded $14,000 for assistive technology - Northern Marianas Protection and Advocacy Systems, Inc. is receiving a grant of $14,000, the Administration for Community Living, Administration on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities announced this week. The grant will be used provide assistive technology to individuals of all ages with disabilities. Congratulations NMPASI.
