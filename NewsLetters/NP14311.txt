Benghazi Investigation Update
Thursday, November 14, 2013
Dear Friend,
Since last nights Benghazi Investigation Update, it appears that the link to access materials on the investigation into the September 11, 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi has changed.
Information on this important investigation can now be found
here , or by typing Benghazi in the upper right corner of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligences website,
http://intelligence.house.gov/ .
Thank you to those who brought this change to my attention.
As always, if you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to call my Abingdon office at 276-525-1405 or my Christiansburg office at 540-381-5671.
To reach my office by email, please visit my website at

Sincerely,
H. Morgan Griffith
Member of Congress
