Dear Friend,
As I travel around California's North Coast, I am often asked, "What
can we expect from Congress in the new year?"
I recorded a video
to share my reflections on 2013-my first
year as a Congressman-and my predictions for 2014.
Watch it HERE
or read the transcript below.
"Happy New Year. It's Congressman Jared Huffman and it's early January
here in Washington, D.C. So far as I travel around my district in 2014,
the thing I hear most is, "What can we expect from Congress in this new
year?" So, I'm going to accept that invitation to look ahead.
Frankly, it's more hopeful than looking behind at 2013 because it was a
frustrating year-by most measures the least productive year in Congress
in American history. And those frustrations include the fact that we
weren't even able to bring to a vote in the House of Representatives a
bipartisan-supported comprehensive immigration reform bill
. We weren't even able to bring to a vote a bipartisan,
common-sense background check bill
to help address our gun violence problem
in this country. We weren't able to pass a bipartisan Farm Bill
like every Congress before us. And, of course, all of it
culminated in a sixteen day government shutdown
that accomplished nothing, but cost the
economy billions of dollars and impacted millions of lives.
So, it was a year of a lot of frustrations. But, even in that difficult
climate we got some things done in 2013 and I'm proud of what we were
able to achieve. I worked with colleagues in both parties to
reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act
and that was very, very
important. I was part of the bipartisan majority that helped finally
end the government shutdown
. And, in the eleventh hour, came up with a
budget deal and finally put a federal budget agreement on the books.
I was also really proud to do something most freshmen members of
Congress haven't been able to do
, and that is to pass a bill. My bill
to expand the California Coastal National Monument to include the Point
Arena-Stornetta Public Lands on the Mendocino County coast passed with
strong bipartisan support in the House of Representatives and is
awaiting action in the Senate, and I am extremely hopeful that we are
going to make that happen
, an important piece of land
conservation for my coastal district.
And then, I was able to work across the aisle and build a coalition in
support of addressing the problem of trespass marijuana grows on public
and private land
. It's affecting my district and
many other districts in the west in a big, big way, causing major
environmental problems. So, as we work to reform marijuana policy, I'm
glad that we've at least got a bipartisan coalition working on
increasing penalties for these environmentally-destructive trespass
growing operations.
In 2014, looking ahead, job number one is to extend unemployment
insurance benefits
. We have 1.3 million job seekers in
this country right now that have lost their benefits because Congress
let them expire at the end of last year. And, these are not handouts,
these are vital lifelines for people who have worked, who want to work
and are struggling to find jobs in an economy that is not yet turned
around and is still not providing the number of jobs that we need.
72,000 people per week are going to be affected by this problem, this
lack of benefits, unless Congress steps up and acts.
So that, I think, is job number one in early 2014. It's a bipartisan
issue historically: under President Bush it was always extended, and in
fact going back fifty years when unemployment, long term unemployment
was anywhere close to where it is today, there's always been bipartisan
support in Congress to provide these type of benefits. So I'm hopeful
we can get that done.
I think we need to stay the course in 2014 on healthcare reform
. I know the Affordable Care Act has been
politicized, has been made, I think, more controversial than it needs
to be. But the truth is we are getting some numbers that are extremely
positive about this health care reform. We are holding
health
care inflation to the lowest rate of increase in 40
years. That, in fact, is having enormous benefits to our deficits,
our long term debt, and our overall economy. So, as we go forward, I
think there is going to be more and more good news from the Affordable
Care Act and I'm hoping we can get to a point where, on a bipartisan
basis, we can look ahead and try to make the Affordable Care Act work
instead of having all of these pointless attempts to try to repeal it.
Immigration reform
will remain a huge priority for this country. It's the
right thing to do for our values, for our traditions. It's hugely
important in our economy, and independent economists will tell you it
will help with our deficit and debt. So we've got to get that passed
this year, we have a great coalition in support of it. I'm not giving
up hope that we can do that because there's a bipartisan vote that we
could have any time in this House of Representatives to pass that bill,
we just need to build the political pressure to bring it to a vote.
We need a Farm Bill
, as I mentioned before, that protects nutrition programs,
protects land conservation, and also provides stability to farmers. I'm
optimistic that we can get that done early in 2014.
We have come so far on discrimination and equality, but there is still
some unfinished business. That includes a bill called ENDA, which would
end employment discrimination against gay, lesbian, and transgender
workers in the workplace. It's really important. Again, there is
bipartisan support if we can get it to a vote in the House, and I'm
going to do everything I can to try to make that pass in 2014.
And finally, as tough as it is in this House of Representatives, I'm
going to do everything I can to keep climate change on the national
radar
. It is, as I've
said many, many times before, I think one of the imperatives of our
generation
is to step up to
this challenge and show some leadership
on it. So, I'll
be pushing for a clean energy
economy, for
clean energy incentives
. One of the
other very important things we can do on it is to end the tax breaks
and special subsidies
we have been
extending many, many years to the oil and gas industry. That's not only
the right thing to do for a clean energy policy
; it's the right
thing to do for our deficit and our debt.
I know our politics are divided right now in Congress and I know we've
just finished a year that was very frustrating in many respects. But, I
never give up, I know you won't let me give up, and you're not giving
up. So we're going to keep slugging away in 2014. I hope we can make
all of the reforms I just mentioned happen in the coming year. It's my
job to do everything I can to make them happen. I'll keep working to
find other bipartisan common ground on all sorts of issues. But even if
we can't pass all the different reforms that I have mentioned, we are
going to draw some very clear lines in 2014, and we will let the people
see the differences of opinion heading into the 2014 election and let
the people of America decide what they think about that.
Thanks for a few minutes to reflect on the year we just concluded and
share some thoughts on the year ahead."
Best,
Jared Huffman

Dear
Friend,
As
I
travel
around
California's
North
Coast,
I
am
often
asked,
"What
can
we
expect
from
Congress
in
the
new
year?"
I
recorded a
video
to
share
my
reflections
on 2013 &#8212; my
first
year
as
a
Congressman &#8212; and
my predictions
for
2014.
Watch
it
HERE
or
read
the
transcript
below.
"Happy
New
Year.
It&#8217;s
Congressman
Jared
Huffman
and
it's early
January
here
in
Washington,
D.C.
So
far
as
I
travel
around
my
district
in
2014,
the
thing
I
hear
most
is,
&#8220;What
can
we
expect
from
Congress
in
this
new
year?&#8221;
So,
I&#8217;m
going
to
accept
that
invitation
to
look
ahead.
Frankly,
it&#8217;s
more
hopeful
than
looking
behind
at
2013
because
it
was
a
frustrating
year&#8212;by
most
measures
the
least
productive
year
in
Congress
in
American
history.
And
those
frustrations
include
the
fact
that
we
weren&#8217;t
even
able
to
bring
to
a
vote
in
the
House
of
Representatives
a
bipartisan-supported
comprehensive
immigration
reform
bill .
We
weren&#8217;t
even
able
to
bring
to
a
vote
a
bipartisan,
common-sense
background
check
bill
to
help
address
our
gun
violence
problem
in
this
country.
We
weren&#8217;t
able
to
pass
a
bipartisan
Farm
Bill
like
every
Congress
before
us.
And,
of
course,
all
of
it
culminated
in
a
sixteen
day
government
shutdown
that
accomplished
nothing,
but
cost
the
economy
billions
of
dollars
and
impacted
millions
of
lives.
So,
it
was
a
year
of
a
lot
of
frustrations.
But,
even
in
that
difficult
climate
we
got
some
things
done
in
2013
and
I&#8217;m
proud
of
what
we
were
able
to
achieve.
I
worked
with
colleagues
in
both
parties
to
reauthorize
the
Violence
Against
Women
Act
and
that
was
very,
very
important.
I
was
part
of
the
bipartisan
majority
that
helped
finally
end
the
government
shutdown .
And,
in
the
eleventh
hour,
came
up
with
a
budget
deal
and
finally
put
a
federal
budget
agreement
on
the
books.
I
was
also
really
proud
to
do
something
most
freshmen
members
of
Congress
haven&#8217;t
been
able
to
do ,
and
that
is
to
pass
a
bill.
My
bill
to
expand
the
California
Coastal
National
Monument
to
include
the
Point
Arena-Stornetta
Public
Lands
on
the
Mendocino
County
coast
passed
with
strong
bipartisan
support
in
the
House
of
Representatives
and
is
awaiting
action
in
the
Senate,
and
I
am
extremely
hopeful
that
we
are
going
to
make
that
happen ,
an
important
piece
of
land
conservation
for
my
coastal
district.
And
then,
I
was
able
to
work
across
the
aisle
and
build
a
coalition
in
support
of
addressing
the
problem
of
trespass
marijuana
grows
on
public
and
private
land .
It&#8217;s
affecting
my
district
and
many
other
districts
in
the
west
in
a
big,
big
way,
causing
major
environmental
problems.
So,
as
we
work
to
reform
marijuana
policy,
I&#8217;m
glad
that
we&#8217;ve
at
least
got
a
bipartisan
coalition
working
on
increasing
penalties
for
these
environmentally-destructive
trespass
growing
operations.
In
2014,
looking
ahead,
job
number
one
is
to
extend
unemployment
insurance
benefits .
We
have
1.3
million
job
seekers
in
this
country
right
now
that
have
lost
their
benefits
because
Congress
let
them
expire
at
the
end
of
last
year.
And,
these
are
not
handouts,
these
are
vital
lifelines
for
people
who
have
worked,
who
want
to
work
and
are
struggling
to
find
jobs
in
an
economy
that
is
not
yet
turned
around
and
is
still
not
providing
the
number
of
jobs
that
we
need.
72,000
people
per
week
are
going
to
be
affected
by
this
problem,
this
lack
of
benefits,
unless
Congress
steps
up
and
acts.
So
that,
I
think,
is
job
number
one
in
early
2014.
It&#8217;s
a
bipartisan
issue
historically:
under
President
Bush
it
was
always
extended,
and
in
fact
going
back
fifty
years
when
unemployment,
long
term
unemployment
was
anywhere
close
to
where
it
is
today,
there&#8217;s
always
been
bipartisan
support
in
Congress
to
provide
these
type
of
benefits.
So
I&#8217;m
hopeful
we
can
get
that
done.
I
think
we
need
to
stay
the
course
in
2014
on
healthcare
reform .
I
know
the
Affordable
Care
Act
has
been
politicized,
has
been
made,
I
think,
more
controversial
than
it
needs
to
be.
But
the
truth
is
we
are
getting
some
numbers
that
are
extremely
positive
about
this
health
care
reform.
We
are
holding
health
care
inflation
to
the
lowest
rate
of
increase
in
40
years .
That,
in
fact,
is
having
enormous
benefits
to
our
deficits,
our
long
term
debt,
and
our
overall
economy.
So,
as
we
go
forward,
I
think
there
is
going
to
be
more
and
more
good
news
from
the
Affordable
Care
Act
and
I&#8217;m
hoping
we
can
get
to
a
point
where,
on
a
bipartisan
basis,
we
can
look
ahead
and
try
to
make
the
Affordable
Care
Act
work
instead
of
having
all
of
these
pointless
attempts
to
try
to
repeal
it.
Immigration
reform
will
remain
a
huge
priority
for
this
country.
It&#8217;s
the
right
thing
to
do
for
our
values,
for
our
traditions.
It&#8217;s
hugely
important
in
our
economy,
and
independent
economists
will
tell
you
it
will
help
with
our
deficit
and
debt.
So
we&#8217;ve
got
to
get
that
passed
this
year,
we
have
a
great
coalition
in
support
of
it.
I&#8217;m
not
giving
up
hope
that
we
can
do
that
because
there&#8217;s
a
bipartisan
vote
that
we
could
have
any
time
in
this
House
of
Representatives
to
pass
that
bill,
we
just
need
to
build
the
political
pressure
to
bring
it
to
a
vote.
We
need
a
Farm
Bill ,
as
I
mentioned
before,
that
protects
nutrition
programs,
protects
land
conservation,
and
also
provides
stability
to
farmers.
I&#8217;m
optimistic
that
we
can
get
that
done
early
in
2014.
We
have
come
so
far
on
discrimination
and
equality,
but
there
is
still
some
unfinished
business.
That
includes
a
bill
called
ENDA,
which
would
end
employment
discrimination
against
gay,
lesbian,
and
transgender
workers
in
the
workplace.
It&#8217;s
really
important.
Again,
there
is
bipartisan
support
if
we
can
get
it
to
a
vote
in
the
House,
and
I&#8217;m
going
to
do
everything
I
can
to
try
to
make
that
pass
in
2014.
And
finally,
as
tough
as
it
is
in
this
House
of
Representatives,
I&#8217;m
going
to
do
everything
I
can
to
keep
climate
change
on
the
national
radar .
It
is,
as
I&#8217;ve
said
many,
many
times
before,
I
think
one
of
the
imperatives
of
our
generation
is
to
step
up
to
this
challenge
and
show
some
leadership
on
it.
So,
I&#8217;ll
be
pushing
for
a
clean
energy
economy,
for
clean
energy
incentives .
One
of
the
other
very
important
things
we
can
do
on
it
is
to
end
the
tax
breaks
and
special
subsidies
we
have
been
extending
many,
many
years
to
the
oil
and
gas
industry.
That&#8217;s
not
only
the
right
thing
to
do
for
a
clean
energy
policy ;
it&#8217;s
the
right
thing
to
do
for
our
deficit
and
our
debt.
I
know
our
politics
are
divided
right
now
in
Congress
and
I
know
we&#8217;ve
just
finished
a
year
that
was
very
frustrating
in
many
respects.
But,
I
never
give
up,
I
know
you
won&#8217;t
let
me
give
up,
and
you&#8217;re
not
giving
up.
So
we&#8217;re
going
to
keep
slugging
away
in
2014.
I
hope
we
can
make
all
of
the
reforms
I
just
mentioned
happen
in
the
coming
year.
It&#8217;s
my
job
to
do
everything
I
can
to
make
them
happen.
I&#8217;ll
keep
working
to
find
other
bipartisan
common
ground
on
all
sorts
of
issues.
But
even
if
we
can&#8217;t
pass
all
the
different
reforms
that
I
have
mentioned,
we
are
going
to
draw
some
very
clear
lines
in
2014,
and
we
will
let
the
people
see
the
differences
of
opinion
heading
into
the
2014
election
and
let
the
people
of
America
decide
what
they
think
about
that.
Thanks
for
a
few
minutes
to
reflect
on
the
year
we
just
concluded
and
share
some
thoughts
on
the
year
ahead.&#8221;
