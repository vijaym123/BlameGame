Dear Friend,
With less than six weeks before Covered CA&rsquo;s March 31 st
enrollment deadline, I am focused on getting every eligible Orange County resident enrolled in quality, affordable health insurance.
I am happy to say that Covered CA has met many of its enrollment goals, including signing up more than 1.6 million Californians for Covered California health insurance plans or for low-cost or no-cost Medi-Cal.
But to me it&rsquo;s not just about meeting projections, it&rsquo;s about enrolling everyone who wants and deserves health insurance. That&rsquo;s why I launched &ldquo;Countdown to Enroll OC,&rdquo; to connect Orange County residents with certified, in person bilingual health insurance enrollment services.
I have been working with community groups across the 46 th
district and filling the calendar between now and March 31 st
with live enrollment events. Please visit my
website
for more information on upcoming events and updates.
Read about my program in the Los Angeles Times
here
and, as always, feel free to email me or contact my office if you have any questions or concerns.
Very Truly Yours,
Loretta Sanchez
Member of Congress
