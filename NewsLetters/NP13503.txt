Dear David,
Late last night, the U.S. Senate achieved a major victory for justice in America's Armed Forces.
The annual defense bill, which we passed and sent to the President for his signature, includes the most historic, substantial reforms to the military justice system in decades - designed to curb sexual assaults in the ranks. The legislation contains bipartisan
reforms
to the "Article 32" pre-trial process, as well as a long list of historic
provisions , including:
Stripping military commanders of their ability to overturn jury convictions
Requiring civilian review if a commander declines to prosecute a case
Assigning victims their own independent legal counsel to protect their rights and fight for their interests
Mandating dishonorable discharge for anyone convicted of sexual assault
Criminalizing retaliation against victims who report a sexual assault
Eliminating the statute of limitations in rape and sexual assault cases
For me, this year has been largely defined by my fight for victims of military sexual assault - and I know that's also the case for many of my colleagues. We all recognized the crisis that sexual crimes represent to our servicemembers, and we pursued reforms that would encourage survivors to report these assaults, lead to more prosecutions, and put these perpetrators behind bars.
The overwhelming majority of these reforms were met with near-consensus, but there were also areas of spirited disagreement - areas that often received a big share of the spotlight. What received less attention was the incredible dedication and tenacity with which Congress approached this work. Washington is often characterized as "broken," and too often that characterization is true. But this issue should give us all optimism that we can work together to find serious solutions to tough problems.
Today represents a huge win for victims of sexual assault, and for justice in America's armed forces, but this is no finish line. In the months and years ahead, vigilance will be required to ensure that these historic reforms are implemented forcefully and effectively. Given the incredible advocacy and passion displayed by so many on this issue, I know we are finally, belatedly, headed in the right direction.
All the best,
