Capitol Update
Congressman Cook Votes to Protect American Workers
Congressman Cook voted last week in favor of the Save American Workers
Act, H.R. 2575. This bill focuses on jobs and helps to provide relief
to middle-class families.
The employer mandate section of Obamacare stipulates that any employee
working 30 hours per week qualifies as full time, and is entitled to
health care coverage. This contradicts the traditional notion of the
40-hour workweek, which has been used for decades as a measure of full
time status.
This 30-hour definition has forced employers, especially small
businesses, to cut hours for employees in order to stay under the
30-hour threshold just to keep their doors open. By keeping the
traditional 40-hour full time workweek, this bill will ensure that
workers don't see their hours cut by as much as 25 percent.
Obamacare isn't just hurting people through higher health care costs -
it's forcing employers to cut hours, which is devastating to people
struggling to make ends meet. With unemployment and underemployment
still the number one issue, we have a responsibility to do all we can
to put America back to work. This bill gets government out of the way
and allows job creators to do what they do best.
Congressman Cook Introduces Bill to Designate Johnson Valley as First
National Off-Highway Vehicle Recreation Area
Last week, Congressman Cook introduced legislation to designate the
Johnson Valley Off-Highway Vehicle Recreation Area as a National
Off-Highway Vehicle Recreation Area. Last year, the off-road community
united in a successful battle to end the threat of base expansion to
nearly 100,000 acres of Johnson Valley and ensured continued off-road
access to the area. Cook introduced H.R. 4371 to recognize this effort
and highlight Johnson Valley's significance by making it the nation's
first national off-highway vehicle recreation area.
This might seem like a small change, but it's important. It will show
that Johnson Valley is of national significance, raising its profile
for economic purposes and within the federal government, which owns the
land.
Johnson Valley is explicitly designated for off-highway vehicle use
under last year's deal negotiated with the US Marine Corps. This area
includes the Hammers, both the front and back side, and other
topographical features such as Spooners, Aftershock, Sunbonnet, the
Riffle Monument, and the Cal200 Memorial (The Rockpile). The majority
of the Fry Mountains and full access to Soggy Dry Lake Bed are also
guaranteed for off-highway vehicle use, as well as access to Emerson
Dry Lake Bed.
This is the culmination of a years-long campaign to save the Hammers
from base expansion. The famed "King of the Hammers" Race, which draws
over 30,000 people to Johnson Valley, can continue to be held in
Johnson Valley. The Bureau of Land Management estimates that Johnson
Valley currently generates more than $71 million annually for local
economies.
Congressman Cook Cosponsors Bill to Extinguish Wildfires
Today, Congressman Cook announced his sponsorship of H.R. 3992, the
Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which will ensure firefighters have the
necessary resources needed to save lives and protect communities from
fire. This bipartisan bill will end the need to borrow government money
to fight fires by categorizing and funding efforts to combat wildfires
the same way as other natural disasters.
Under this bill, routine firefighting costs, which make up about 70
percent of the cost of wildfire suppression, would be funded through
the normal federal budgeting and appropriation process. The true
emergency fire events, which represent about 1 percent of wildfires but
make up 30 percent of the costs, would be treated like other major
natural disasters and funded under disaster programs.
Seasonal wildfires are a grave threat to our region, and everyone in
the firefighting community is bracing for what could be a bad year
given the historic drought in our state. When a fire starts, we need to
be able to respond in a way that saves homes and lives. H.R. 3992 does
that. One major fire can exhaust most of the resources for the year,
leaving little money for routine firefighting. This bill will help
prevent our fire departments from being bankrupted by a single
devastating fire.
A Message from Congressman Cook: Terrorists Have No Place at the U.N.
Recently, Iran announced its intention to name Hamid Aboutalebi, a
known terrorist, as its ambassador to the U.N. Aboutalebi was a member
of the Muslim Students Following the Imam's Line, the group that
stormed the American Embassy in Tehran and took 54 Americans hostage
for 444 days.
I have cosponsored H.R. 4357, a bill to block terrorists from using
diplomatic credentials to enter the United States. Terrorists have no
place serving as diplomats at the United Nations and certainly have no
right to enter the United States. Aboutalebi's nomination as Iran's
U.N. Ambassador is a reminder that despite President Rouhani's
rhetoric, Iran remains the world's leading sponsor of terrorism and can
never be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon.
Terrorists like Aboutalebi whose actions have violated all the rules of
diplomatic conduct have no business serving as diplomats, particularly
in the nation they attacked. I'm proud to be a cosponsor of this bill
and urge my colleagues in the House to join the Senate in unanimously
passing this important legislation.

A Message from Congressman Cook: Support Give BIG San Bernardino County
Give BIG San Bernardino County, sponsored by the Board of Supervisors
of San Bernardino County, is a 24-hour fundraising web-a-thon taking
place from 7AM May 8, 2014 to 7AM May 9 to benefit San Bernardino
County communities.
San Bernardino County has great challenges and needs, but receives the
smallest amount of outside foundational dollars and state and federal
grants per capita when compared to any other counties in California.
Many of our local nonprofits regularly struggle to keep their doors
open. Give BIG San Bernardino County is the first countywide campaign
supporting organizations that help those most in need in our county.
This opportunity will increase participating San Bernardino County
nonprofit's economic resources while letting the public know of their
existence. Individuals who wish to donate can visit
www.giveBIGsbcounty.org and select from over 175 participating
nonprofits. Donations can be made via smart phone, tablet or computer
via a secure online donation platform.
Give BIG is doing great work to make the lives of San Bernardino
residents better. These non-profits need the support of our community
to carry out their mission.
Congressman Cook Assists Widow in Fight Against Department of Veterans
Affairs
A 77-year-old widow from Apple Valley was seeking assistance receiving
the Dependency Indemnity Compensation (IDC) and burial costs from the
Department of Veterans Affairs after her husband passed away.
Originally, the widow filed in November 2011. After being denied
without explanation, she appealed. Exhausted from wading through inept
bureaucracy for three years, she sought assistance from our office to
obtain a decision on her appeal. My staff worked directly with the VA
and she was granted $31,000 in retroactive pay for DIC, and was
approved for burial reimbursements. The VA process was inefficient and
burdensome and is just another example of how harmful the VA can be.

Congressman

Congressman
Cook
voted last
week in
favor
of
the
Save
American
Workers
Act,
H.R.
2575.
This
bill
focuses
on
jobs
and
helps
to
provide
relief
to
middle-class
families.
The
employer
mandate
section
of
Obamacare
stipulates
that
any
employee
working
30
hours
per
week
qualifies
as
full
time,
and
is
entitled
to
health
care
coverage.
This
contradicts
the
traditional
notion
of
the
40-hour
workweek,
which
has
been
used
for
decades
as
a
measure
of
full
time
status.
This
30-hour
definition
has
forced
employers,
especially
small
businesses,
to
cut
hours
for
employees
in
order
to
stay
under
the
30-hour
threshold
just
to
keep
their
doors
open.
By
keeping
the
traditional
40-hour
full
time
workweek,
this
bill
will
ensure
that
workers
don&#8217;t
see
their
hours
cut
by
as
much
as
25
percent.
Obamacare
isn&#8217;t
just
hurting
people
through
higher
health
care
costs
&#8211;
it&#8217;s
forcing
employers
to
cut
hours,
which
is
devastating
to
people
struggling
to
make
ends
meet.
With
unemployment
and
underemployment
still
the
number
one
issue,
we
have
a
responsibility
to
do
all
we
can
to
put
America
back
to
work.
This
bill
gets
government
out
of
the
way
and
allows
job
creators
to
do
what
they
do
best.
Congressman

Last

Congressman
Cook
introduced
legislation
to
designate
the
Johnson

Off-Highway

Area
as
a
National

Last

the

united
in

to
nearly
100,000

of
Johnson

and
ensured

Cook
introduced
H.R.

and
highlight
Johnson
Valley&#8217;s
significance
by
making
it
the
nation&#8217;s
first
national
off-highway
vehicle
recreation
area.
This
might
seem
like
a
small
change,
but
it&#8217;s
important.
It
will
show
that
Johnson
Valley
is
of
national
significance,
raising
its
profile
for
economic
purposes
and
within
the
federal
government,
which
owns
the

Johnson

is
explicitly
designated

under
last

Soggy
Dry
Lake
Bed
are
also
guaranteed
for
off-highway
vehicle
use,
as
well
as
access
to
Emerson
Dry
Lake
Bed.
This
is
the
culmination
of
a
years-long
campaign
to
save
the
Hammers
from
base

The
famed
&#8220;King
of
the
Hammers&#8221;
Race,
which
draws
over
30,000
people
to
Johnson
Valley,
can
continue
to
be
held
in
Johnson
Valley.
The
Bureau
of
Land
Management
estimates
that
Johnson
Valley
currently
generates
more
than
$71
million
annually
for
local
economies.
Congressman
Cook
Cosponsors
Bill
to
Extinguish
Wildfires
Today,
Congressman
Cook
announced
his
sponsorship
of
H.R.
3992,
the
Wildfire
Disaster
Funding
Act,
which
will
ensure
firefighters
have
the
necessary
resources
needed
to
save
lives
and
protect
communities
from
fire.
This
bipartisan
bill
will
end
the
need
to
borrow
government
money
to
fight
fires
by
categorizing
and
funding
efforts
to
combat
wildfires
the
same
way
as
other
natural
disasters.
Under
this
bill,
routine
firefighting
costs,
which
make
up
about
70
percent
of
the
cost
of
wildfire
suppression,
would
be
funded
through
the
normal
federal
budgeting
and
appropriation
process.
The
true
emergency
fire
events,
which
represent
about
1
percent
of
wildfires
but
make
up
30
percent
of
the
costs,
would
be
treated
like
other
major
natural
disasters
and
funded
under
disaster
programs.
Seasonal
wildfires
are
a
grave
threat
to
our
region,
and
everyone
in
the
firefighting
community
is
bracing
for
what
could
be
a
bad
year
given
the
historic
drought
in
our
state.
When
a
fire
starts,
we
need
to
be
able
to
respond
in
a
way
that
saves
homes
and
lives.
H.R.
3992
does
that.
One
major
fire
can
exhaust
most
of
the
resources
for
the
year,
leaving
little
money
for
routine
firefighting.
This
bill
will
help
prevent
our
fire
departments
from
being
bankrupted
by
a
single
devastating
fire.
A
Message
from
Congressman
Cook:
Terrorists
Have
No
Place
at
the
U.N.
Recently,
Iran
announced
its
intention
to
name
Hamid
Aboutalebi,
a
known
terrorist,
as
its
ambassador
to
the
U.N.
Aboutalebi
was
a
member
of
the
Muslim
Students
Following
the
Imam&#8217;s
Line,
the
group
that
stormed
the
American
Embassy
in
Tehran
and
took
54
Americans
hostage
for
444
days.
I
have
cosponsored
H.R.
4357,
a
bill
to
block
terrorists
from
using
diplomatic
credentials
to
enter
the
United

Terrorists
have
no
place
serving
as
diplomats
at
the
United
Nations
and
certainly
have
no
right
to
enter
the
United
States.
Aboutalebi&#8217;s
nomination
as
Iran&#8217;s
U.N.
Ambassador
is
a
reminder
that
despite
President
Rouhani&#8217;s
rhetoric,
Iran
remains
the
world&#8217;s
leading
sponsor
of
terrorism
and
can
never
be
allowed
to
acquire
a
nuclear
weapon.
Terrorists
like
Aboutalebi
whose
actions
have
violated
all
the
rules
of
diplomatic
conduct
have
no
business
serving
as
diplomats,
particularly
in
the
nation
they
attacked.

Assists
Widow
in
Fight
Against
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
A
77-year-old
widow
from
Apple

was
seeking
assistance
receiving
the
Dependency
Indemnity
Compensation
(IDC)
and
burial
costs
from
the
Department

Veterans
Affairs
after
her
husband
passed
away.
Originally,
the

filed
in
November
2011.
After
being
denied

she
appealed.
Exhausted
from
wading
through
inept
bureaucracy
for
three
years,
she
sought
assistance
from
our
office
to
obtain
a
decision
on
her

My

worked
directly
with
the

and she
was
granted
$31,000
in

for
DIC,
and
was
approved
for
burial

process
was
inefficient
