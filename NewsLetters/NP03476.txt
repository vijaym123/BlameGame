How Can I Help You?
Tuesday, January 13, 2015
Dear Friend,
Last Tuesday marked the start of the 114th Congress. It is an honor and privilege to serve the 24th Congressional District, and I look forward to continuing to represent the people and communities of the Central Coast in Washington, D.C. There are a number of challenges facing our country, and I am eager to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to address the important issues before us.
I&rsquo;ve always taken great pride in my work on behalf of youmy neighbors and constituents. And I want you to know that my offices, both in California and in Washington, D.C., are here to serve you.
We do so by helping local residents, organizations, and businesses in a myriad of ways, from resolving issues with federal agencies such as helping someone obtain their veterans benefits or a passport to assisting our local universities with information on federal grants to helping our young people gain nominations to our nation&rsquo;s prestigious military academies.
If you are coming to Washington, D.C., we can also help you arrange tours to the Capitol, White House, and other important sights in our nation&rsquo;s capital. We can even have an American flag flown over the U.S. Capitol for you. We are here to help.
Additionally, it&rsquo;s no secret that our country is facing a number of challenges, and Congress has not been the most productive. But I believe we must find a way to put aside partisan differences and work together for the common good.
That is why I want to hear
your views on the issues and the priorities you believe Congress should focus on. Thoughtful and engaging political dialogue is what keeps our democracy strong, so I greatly appreciate constituents taking the time to share their thoughts on an issue.
Please keep in touch with me through
my website , by liking
my Facebook page , following me on
Twitter , or
sending me an email .
I look forward to working with my colleagues in this new Congress to address the needs of our nation.
Happy New Year to you and your family.
Sincerely,
Lois Capps
MEMBER OF CONGRESS
