We&rsquo;re still FUMING:
Last night, House Republicans voted to officially sue President Obama. Boehner claimed it wasn&rsquo;t about attacking the President. It was about the Constitution.
But mere minutes after the vote, Boehner&rsquo;s campaign operatives fired off a fundraising email to top right-wing donors:
From:
National Republicans
Subject:
Give Obama Hell!
That's right. As soon as the vote was in, he was trying to rile up the extreme Tea Party base!
We&rsquo;re done mincing words: We want to make Boehner pay for his actions before tonight&rsquo;s midnight deadline.
To do that, we&rsquo;re working to reach 5OO,OOO grassroots donations since Boehner announced the lawsuit. Right now, we have 27,947 to go.
