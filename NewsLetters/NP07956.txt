The Border Crisis Requires Immediate Presidential
Action
The images of thousands of innocent
children entering the United States illegally along our southern border are
heartbreaking.
Sadly, the policies of the Obama administration
have led tens of thousands of families in Central America to believe
that they can send their children to the United States where they will
be able to stay.
For the ten years preceding fiscal
year 2012, the federal government dealt with approximately 7,000 to
8,000 unaccompanied illegal alien children a year. In FY 2011, there were
6,560.
However, in 2012, the President signed an
Executive Order
entitled Deferred Action for
Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and the number jumped to 13,625.
Since last
October, at least 50,000 have entered illegally. Officials estimate at
least 150,000-160,000 more will try next year.
The White
House has embarked on a public relations campaign to tell potential
migrants that they will not receive amnesty.
Yet many illegal
immigrants have told authorities that they traveled to America, or paid
thousands of dollars to drug and human traffickers to transport their young
children, believing the Obama administration would never deport them
if they made it across the U.S.-Mexico border.
The
President already has the authority needed to secure the border and return
these children to their home countries,
says
Jessica Vaughan, the director of policy studies at the Center for
Immigration Studies:
I also suggest reading Charles Krauthammers excellent
op-ed
from yesterdays Washington Post.
Iron Dome is Protecting Israel
I am,
and have always been, a stronger defender of Israel and of its right to
defend itself against those who deny its basic right to exist.
I fully support Israels forceful response to the ongoing attacks on
Israel and its people by the terrorist organization
Hamas.
An important part of Israels defense is the Iron Dome air
defense system.
As chair of the House Defense Appropriations
Subcommittee, I was very pleased that our bill for the coming fiscal year
includes $350,972,000 for improvements to Israels Iron Dome.
This
represents an increase of $175,000,000 above the Presidents original
budget request for the program.
This
article
from the Voice of America details just how successfully Iron
Dome has performed in intercepting rockets fired into Israel by Hamas
terrorists.
The United States must continue to stand
with Israel, one of our closest allies and the only democracy in the
Middle East.
Ukraine Going it Alone:
Washington
Post
This
editorial
from
todays
Washington Post
is well
worth a read.
Picatinny: Always Finding a Better
Way
Picatinny Arsenal has long been in the
forefront in developing advanced weaponry and other equipment to give our
troops the advantage on the battlefield.
One of its
latest
innovations
is the Advanced Speed Bag, a
vastly improved container for resupplying troops in the field.
Currently, supplies are dropped from helicopters, often resulting in
significant damage to the equipment being provided.
This
innovation will ensure that when our warriors are in the midst of a
battle, the ammunition, medical supplies, and food they need can now be
delivered largely undamaged, providing an edge that could mean all the
difference between life and
death.
Freedoms Indispensable Nation
The
Wall
Street Journal
uses the
occasion
of its 125 th
anniversary to reflect on the indispensable
role the United States has played over the past century in advancing
the cause of peace and freedom in the world.
As the international
situation continues to deteriorate, this essay is a must
read.
Salute:
Fort Nonsense Officially Reopened on the
Fourth of July
I was pleased to attend the
re-opening, on Independence Day, of Fort Nonsense in Morristown.
This
National Park Service historic site was badly damaged by Superstorm Sandy,
and has been undergoing repairs.
I
salute
the Washington Association of New Jersey, ably led by Hardings
own Eileen Cameron, which donated $35,000 to clear downed trees and
install new benches, picnic tables, and signs.
I
also salute, Tom Ross, the superintendent of the Morristown National
Historic Park, and his staff for their efforts to make Fort Nonsense
even more visitor-friendly than it was before the storm.
Fort
Nonsense is located 600 feet above sea level, on the highest spot in
Morristown.
On a clear day, the New York City skyline is
visible, nearly 25 miles away.
Information about planning a visit to
Fort Nonsense, and the rest of the Morristown National Historic Park,
can be found
here .
Honoring
Raoul Wallenberg
This past Wednesday, I had the honor
of attending the Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony honoring the
heroic efforts of Raoul Wallenberg during World War II. Wallenberg,
operating as a Swedish diplomat, was responsible for saving the lives of more
than 100,000 Hungarian Jewish men, women, and children in the final
year of the war.
At great risk to his own life, Wallenberg
bravely issued official Swedish documents to tens of thousands of
Hungarian Jews who would otherwise have been sent to Nazi concentration
camps.
Wallenbergs courage was also directly responsible for
saving the lives of 70,000 people living in the largest Jewish ghetto in
Budapest.
In January 1945, Wallenberg disappeared and
his fate remains unknown.
Incredibly, in just six months, he
accomplished one of the greatest humanitarian rescue missions in
history.
In recognition of his heroism, Wallenberg was made an honorary
citizen of the United States in 1981, becoming only the second person
ever to receive that honor.
Winston Churchill was the
first.

website
of the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum.
