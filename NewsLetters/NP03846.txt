Dear Friends,
Parents of
children with disabilities are aware of how special their child is and
the additional care that these children will need throughout their
lifetime. Raising a child with disabilities involves long hours and many
sacrifices.
Beyond that, families with disabled children must
also think ahead and plan for their childs adult years.
I am
proud that the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act (ABLE Act), a
bipartisan bill, which I cosponsored and was recently passed by the House,
will provide the necessary tools to individuals with disabilities and
their family members to financially plan for the future by allowing
them access to tax free savings
accounts.
Individuals with disabilities and their families face enormous struggles
when it comes to planning for college and retirement. This bill would
allow families to create tax free savings accounts for the future
care of their children.
These accounts will allow families to cover
expenses such as education, housing and transportation; it will also
supplement the long-term disability expenses of children with special
needs.
Finally, this bill will eliminate barriers to work and
saving by preventing dollars set aside through ABLE accounts from
counting against an individuals eligibility for any federal benefits
program.
Floridians with disabilities overcome difficulties every
day. Trying to save for their future should not be yet another
challenge. Families with disabled children deserve the assurance that they
can properly care for their children, especially after parents and
other direct decision makers have passed or are unable to make decisions
related to the beneficiarys care.
I am thankful that the ABLE
Act will help provide this much needed assistance.
Allowing
families to establish ABLE accounts will lead to peace of mind for parents
and primary caregivers while ensuring that children with special needs
will receive the care they will require in later years.
Although
there is still much work to be done, the ABLE Act is a great first
step in creating a more inclusive society for our loved ones with
disabilities.
Sincerely,
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
Member of
Congress
