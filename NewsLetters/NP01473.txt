Highly unusual
Dear Friend,
Something highly unusual happened near the U.S. Capitol this week. And
unlike
Gryo-Copter Man
this event was peaceful, calm, and constructive. It also went largely unreported.
Two members of Congress, one Republican and one Democrat, one from Michigan and one from Colorado, sat down, and had a thoughtful chat on how we can get better and faster cures to patients all across the country.
Those two members of Congress were Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colorado, and myself. There is even
video evidence .
I know youre tired of hearing about the partisan rancor in Washington. I am too. Thats exactly why I teamed up with Rep. DeGette and remain ever-committed to finding bipartisan solutions
like our 21 st
Century Cures initiative. We share the common goal for getting faster and better cures and treatments to patients.
One of the keys to 21 st
Century Cures success has been the support and ideas from folks back home. Last year, we held a bipartisan roundtable in Kalamazoo at the Western Michigan University Homer Stryker M.D. School of Medicine which sparked a number of ideas for this initiative, including a discussion about the value and importance of increased data sharing among researchers, innovators, clinicians, and patients while maintaining important patient safety protections.
This initiative breaks the usual Washington mold. So were bringing 21 st
Century Cures back to Southwest Michigan again.
This
Monday and Tuesday
Rep. DeGette and I will visit students, researchers, patients, innovators, and job creators. Everyone has an important voice, and we are now closer than ever to delivering hope to patients here in Michigan and across the country as 21 st
Century Cures becomes a reality.
Join the conversation and follow along using the hash tag
#CuresInTheMitten
on social media. We look forward to seeing and hearing from you.
