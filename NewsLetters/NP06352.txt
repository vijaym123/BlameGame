Right now, government agencies are not required
to disclose on advertisements that they are the publishers behind them
or that their advertisements are paid for with the publics money.
People should not have to play detective to find out what their
government is doing.
I believe it is important, in the
interest of transparency and government accountability, for the public to
know exactly what taxpayer dollars are funding and promoting; that is why
I introduced the
Taxpayer Transparency Act .
The
Taxpayer Transparency Act
requires federal agencies to
disclose that any educational or advertising materials they fund are paid for
at taxpayer expense.
This includes mediums such as printed
mailers, brochures, television and radio advertisements, billboards, and
emails.
Specifically, printed communications are required to
state this disclosure in clearly legible font, type size and must be
separated from all other content by a printed box.
Television and
radio advertisements are required to have a voiceover stating that the
communication is recorded at taxpayer expense, with television also
requiring a statement meeting the same requirements as printed
communications.
The House and Senate already operate with this
type of transparency requirement. By law, the House is required to
include a disclosure statement on similar types of communication such as
newsletters and franked mail, while the U.S. Senate is required to do
the same by self-imposed rules.
My
Taxpayer Transparency Act
unanimously passed the House in
February.
My bill is one of many bills that remain stuck in the
Senate.
Government cannot be held accountable
unless the people know what their government is doing.
My bill will
help pull back the curtain on Executive Branch spending by requiring
greater transparency in terms of spending, and thats an objective I
hope everyone can get behind.
