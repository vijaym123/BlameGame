David --
A lot of people will be emailing you asking for your help before the end of the year -- and there are a lot of important races for us in 2014.
But, here&rsquo;s one race that absolutely warrants your attention: Cheri Bustos' in Illinois&rsquo; 17th district. Cheri&rsquo;s race isn&rsquo;t going to be easy.
Speaker Boehner and national Republicans have already targeted her campaign with vicious attacks. If Cheri is going to win, we&rsquo;ve got to help her get the facts out to voters.
The final Federal Election Commission fundraising deadline of the year hits on December 31st. Let&rsquo;s make sure Cheri has a huge showing so she can fight back with the truth. 24 HOURS TO GO:
Please chip in $3 or whatever you can to help out Cheri Bustos before tomorrow's final 2013 FEC fundraising deadline &gt;&gt;
I wish we had more leaders like Cheri in Congress. I&rsquo;m not sure I can say the same for our friends across the aisle.
Please, do your part today to make sure Cheri has the resources she needs to win in 2014. Click here to make a donation for Cheri &gt;&gt;
Best,
Nancy
