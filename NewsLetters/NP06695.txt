Interior
Secretary Jewell Visits the Great Swamp
On Wednesday I
had the pleasure of
welcoming
the Secretary of
the Interior, Sally Jewell, to the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge
in Harding Township where we celebrated the 50 th
Anniversary of the signing of the Wilderness Act by President Lyndon B. Johnson.
This is the third Interior Secretary I have welcomed to this
beautiful natural treasure: Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Secretary Gale Norton
each visited the Great Swamp at my invitation in years
past.
Be sure to read my guest
column
on nj.com that
tells the story of the citizen-led fight to save the Great Swamp 50
years ago from being a major
jetport.
Job
Growth Still Sluggish
For the 68 th
month in
a row, the nations unemployment rate remains above 6 percent. Just
142,000 jobs were created last month, the worst month for job growth
this
year.
Fortune
magazine
reports
that despite the slight uptick in
job growth, economist Mike Schenk believes, We still have a long way
to go before we can claim things are better. According to
Fortune , Schenck also maintains that it is
problematic that the average duration of unemployment is still about two
times higher than historical norms.
With Congress
returning to Washington next week,
it is more important than ever
that the Senate begin passing the more than 40 bills passed by the
House to create jobs and opportunity for Americas workers.
A
description of those bills can be found
here .
Henry Kissinger: The Assembly of a New World
Order
Noble Peace Prize recipient and former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger provided a fascinating
analysis
of the geopolitical lay of the land, and poses some
thought-provoking questions for U.S. policymakers to consider as we confront
the many problems threating peace and stability around the world. It
is well worth a read!
Its Not Morning in
America
Despite the growing list of problems confronting
our country, President Obama seems to think everything is going along
just fine. In this perceptive
column
in the
Washington Post , Dana Milbank says the
Presidents happy talk is unnerving when the country faces so many
problems at home and around the world.
A Major
Breakthrough in Treating Heart Failure
New Jersey is
known around the globe as the Medicine Chest of the World because it is
home to many of the worlds most productive research pharmaceutical,
biotechnology, and life sciences companies. So it not surprising that
East Hanover based Novartis made international headlines with the
announcement of a new drug to treat heart failure.
Dr. Clyde
Yancy, a former head of the American Heart Association, hailed the news,
saying, "This is a new day for patients.It's been at least a decade
since we've had a breakthrough of this
magnitude."
Congratulations to everyone at Novartis for their work in
developing
this drug and to everyone in works in this industry in New
Jersey for their life-saving work.
Back to
School!
With Labor Day behind us, students, teachers, and
staff at our outstanding public, private, and parochial schools are
returning to the classroom. The
New Jersey
Herald
published
a Back to School guide
that includes all sorts of useful tips (covering everything from choosing
the right backpack to getting back into the school routine) for
parents as their children kick-off another school
year.
Salute: The Friends of Great Swamp
With the
nations attention drawn to the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge earlier
this week, one group of people that does so much to preserve and
protect this beautiful treasure deserves special recognition: The Friends
of Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, which is marking its
15 th
anniversary this year.
I salute this great group of
volunteers, who are indispensable to the Refuge, providing thousands
of hours of volunteer work every year to help preserve and protect for
all time this precious natural resource! These men and women deserve
our thanks!
The Friends Fall Festival Celebration takes
place tomorrow, September 6, from 10:30 am to 3:30 pm. To learn more
about this fun event, and about this wonderful organization, visit its
website:
http://www.friendsofgreatswamp.org/ .
Salute: Mary Pierson
Mary
Pierson of Netcong, Morris County, was honored earlier this week by the
Netcong Mayor and Council for 50 years of active volunteerism to her
community. You would be hard pressed to find a more public spirited
citizen than Mary. She is an example to all of the difference that one
person can make in the life of ones community. I salute Mary for her half
century of community support!
Salute: Turn The
Towns Teal
September is Ovarian Cancer Awareness
Month and a national campaign to raise awareness has been launched from
right here in the 11 Congressional District by Turn The Town Teal: A
National Awareness Campaign for Ovarian Cancer, which is
headquartered in Brookside.
Now in its eighth year, this nationwide
campaign, with supporters in 45 states, is tying teal ribbons in hundreds
of towns across the country to raise awareness of this terrible
disease. This year, an estimated 22,000 women will be diagnosed with
ovarian cancer; another 14,000 are expected to die from this
disease.

effort to save womens lives, visit

Salute: Whippany River Watershed Action
Committee
I had the pleasure of attending a
celebration marking the 15 th
anniversary of the
Whippany River Watershed Action Committee . This outstanding group
helps protect the cleanliness of the river by safeguarding the
streams and tributaries that flow into it.
This was the first
watershed effort in Northern New Jersey and more than a dozen
municipalities have been working to protect the Whippany River watershed for more
than 30 years.
The rivers total watershed area covers
almost 70 square miles in Morris County
and the river helps provide
drinking water to more than one million North Jerseyans. Over the years,
the committee has received numerous awards for its work. I salute them
for their commitment to the health of the Whippany
River!
