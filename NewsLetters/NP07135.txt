Connection

Dear Friends,
Last week, Sen. Coons and
I were fortunate enough to
enjoy a taste of Delaware in
Washington, D.C., when our
friends from the University
of Delawares UDairy
Creamery paid us a visit.
UDairys own
Melinda Litvinas and Jacob
Hunt were both honored by the
White House and the USDA as
a
Future
of American Agriculture
Champion of Change.
Agriculture Champions
of Change are leaders from
across the country who are
doing extraordinary things to
build the bench for the next
generation of farming and
ranching.
The UDairy Creamery is on
the University of
Delawares campus, and
an extension of the College
of Agriculture and Natural
Resources. UDairy offers a
hands-on experience for UD
students and faculty through
an integrated learning
approach. The creamery pulls
from many different
curriculums - including
agriculture, science and
technology, business
management, and even
engineering - and makes a
cohesive (and delicious)
final product.
Melinda has served as the
UDairy director for the past
four years and Jacob is one
of the students who
flourished under her
direction and has gone on to
become managing partner of a
creamery in New Jersey.
I congratulate Melinda and
Jacob on their well-deserved
recognition, and I urge
Delawareans to take a beat
from the heat with an ice
cream treat sometime this
summer!
Stay cool,
Stay Connected with
