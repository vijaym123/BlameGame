Hello,
Welcome to Kansas Common Sense. Thank you for your continued interest
in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
Cyber Attack at United States Office of Personnel Management Affects
Millions
It was troubling to hear the news Thursday of a massive cyber attack
breaching the personal information of 4 million current and former
federal employees stored at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
Even more troubling is the fact that this is the second OPM breach in
less than a year. These cyber criminals, which some have suggested are
state-sponsored, gained access to 4 million federal government employee
records including Social Security numbers, job assignments, performance
ratings and training information. Last year in an Appropriations
Subcommittee hearing, I asked a number of questions to OPM Director
Archuleta about how to attract and retain cyber talent within the
federal workforce to protect against breaches like this. As Chair of
the Senate Commerce Subcommittee for Consumer Protection, Product
Safety, Insurance and Data Security, I will pursue answers to how this
breach occurred, how long the hackers were in the system, and what
steps the federal government should be taking to protect other agencies
and sensitive information.
Senate Votes on Legislation to Extend Government's Surveillance
Authorities
This week, the Senate passed the USA FREEDOM Act
legislation altering
and extending the governments surveillance authorities. I voted
against the bill as I am concerned by the governments domestic data
collection practices and the intrusion of the privacy of American
citizens. The U.S. intelligence community should be equipped with the
tools necessary to reduce national security risks, but the USA FREEDOM
Act fails to provide the reform necessary to safeguard individual
rights. At the same time, it does not adequately improve the security
of Americans.
Effective intelligence gathering does not have to come at the expense
of civil liberties. Limited debate in the Senate failed to yield
appropriately meaningful reforms. By waiting until the last few days
before expiration to address the legislation, Americans were
shortchanged in finding a responsible solution. I will continue to push
for intelligence policies that protect both national security and the
privacy of American citizens.
Frustrating Update from Colmery-ONeil VA Medical Center
My request for an update about the delay in reopening Colmery-ONeils
emergency department this week resulted in frustrating news from VA
Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson
certain emergency department service
areas arent yet fully capable of meeting the needs of the veterans.
Colmery-ONeil has a plan in place to address these areas and will seek
approval to reopen in the coming weeks. While my first priority is the
safety and quality of care for veterans, I will continue to work with
Congresswoman Jenkins to press the VA until this issue is resolved.
Additionally, this week at a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Hearing
I questioned
the Veterans Health Administration Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for
Health Clinical Operations Thomas Lynch about the Colmery-ONeil VA
Medical Centers Emergency Department. Click here
to read more about this issue.
Sensible Environment Protections Act
I joined a bipartisan group of senators this week in introducing
legislation to eliminate a duplicative EPA regulation that results in
added cost and bureaucratic red tape for Kansas farmers, ranchers,
state and local governments, and other pesticide applicators. The
Sensible Environmental Protection Act (SEPA) clarifies Congressional
intent concerning the safe use of pesticides around bodies of water
under jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act (CWA).
For decades, the EPA has rigorously regulated pesticide applications
under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)
with the aim to protect human health and the environment. FIFRA
requires pesticides to be extensively tested and registered with the
EPA. Pesticide users must then strictly comply with agency approved
labels when applying the registered pesticide. However, despite this
clear regulatory framework in place, a 2009 court decision forced EPA
to require additional permits for pesticide use under the CWA. SEPA
would eliminate this unnecessary and redundant permitting requirement
for pesticides that hinders stakeholders without any environmental
benefit. Click here

Drawing Attention to Issues at FIFA
Last week, nine FIFA officials and five corporate executives were
formally charged by U.S. prosecutors for racketeering, wire fraud, and
money laundering
charges that suggest FIFA officials may have been
bribed to select certain locations as host countries for the World Cup
soccer tournament. This week, the newly re-elected President of FIFA,
Sepp Blatter, who has presided over international soccers governing
body for 17 years, announced his immediate resignation amidst
allegations he is also connected to the high-profile corruption
scandal.
As FIFA prepares to elect a new president, I believe now is an
opportunity to examine some of the tragic human rights abuses occurring
in one of those host countries, Qatar. In 2022, Qatar is scheduled to
host the FIFA World Cup. The country, which has a population of less
than 300,000 citizens, plans to import as many as 500,000 migrant
workers to construct the World Cup stadiums. Last year ESPN aired a
riveting documentary, which highlighted the unsanitary living
conditions, troubling working conditions and extreme heat that has cost
nearly 700 lives in recent years. Should the pace of death continue, as
many as 6,000 workers are expected to lose their life before the first
World Cup 2022 game begins. As Chairman of the Commerce Subcommittee on
Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and Data Security, our
jurisdiction includes sports. I intend to hold a hearing to examine
these abuses in Qatar, and determine how the United States can play a
productive role in encouraging the new president of FIFA to improve
worker conditions and restore integrity to the organization. Click here

Visiting Central Kansas Hospitals
On Friday afternoon, I had the opportunity to visit health care
providers and hospital administrators at two Kansas community hospitals
to learn more about their efforts to provide quality care to patients.
First, I visited Stafford County Hospital (SCH), a 25-bed Critical
Access Hospital (CAH) serving the community since 1961. SCH provides a
wide range of services, including imaging and laboratory services,
physical, occupational and speech therapy, and wound care.
Following my time in Stafford, I visited Ellinwood District Hospital
(EDH). EDH is also a 25-bed CAH providing care since 1952. EDH also
operates a rural health clinic specializing in family medicine, which
has seen patients for more than 20 years. As a member of the Senate
Appropriations Health Subcommittee, which has funding jurisdiction over
most agencies within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) that impact hospitals and providers, meeting with Kansas hospital
administrators, physicians, nurses, and other staff gives me important
insight on the challenges they face caring for patients.
My discussions with SCH and EDH administrators and staff spanned
various topics including concerns with proposed changes in Medicare
reimbursements and the consequences to CAHs, and the challenges of
providing quality patient care under regulations that do not account
for the realities of delivering care in a rural setting. It is
important that the federal government allow rural providers the
flexibility necessary to adequately care for their patients, many of
whom are older and live across wide areas. Thank you to SCH CEO Todd
Taylor and EDH CEO Kile Magner for hosting my visits to their hospitals.
Working to Prevent Domestic Violence and Child Abuse in Kansas
This week I met with two groups that are working to end domestic
violence and child abuse: the Kansas Coalition Against Sexual and
Domestic Violence and the Children's Advocacy Centers of Kansas.
On Wednesday, I met with Joyce Grover to discuss the Kansas Coalition
Against Sexual and Domestic Violence (KCSDV). KSCDV is a nonprofit
network that works to prevent and eliminate sexual and domestic
violence across our state. The ongoing efforts of KCSDV are critical to
the individuals and families it serves, as well as the various
organizations it coordinates with. I appreciated the chance to visit
with such a respected leader on this important issue.
The Children's Advocacy Centers of Kansas visited with my staff about
their work to prevent abuse and keep children safe. In 2014, the Child
Advocacy Centers of Kansas served over 4,000 children. Among other
things, the CACs work assists law enforcement and the judicial system
efficiently process child abuse cases while prioritizing the childs
health and safety.
Continuing Kansas Listening Tour Stops
I continued my Kansas Listening Tour stops with visits to Ellis and
Barton Counties on Saturday. For a list of my upcoming Kansas Listening
Tour stops, visit my website
.
Ellis County
More than 50 Hays-area residents joined me for a Kansas Listening Tour
stop in Ellis County. We discussed a number of issues including health
care for rural veterans, the Fair Tax, national security, and the
importance of improving our country for future generations. Thanks to
Hays Area Chamber of Commerce
Executive Director Tammy Wellbrock and the City of
Hays Welcome Center for hosting my visit.
Barton County
Thanks to the Barton County area residents who attended my Kansas
Listening Tour stop in Hoisington. The conversation focused on a number
of issues of importance to our state and nation including veterans'
health care, Critical Access Hospitals, frustration with the Affordable
Care Act and the Farmer Veteran Coalition
. Thanks also to Hoisington Chamber of
Commerce Executive Director Kristi Lovett and the Hoisington Recreation
Commission for hosting.
FHSUs Annual Presidents Dinner
On Friday, Robba and I attended the Fort Hays State University annual
Presidents Dinner, which is held every year to thank those who have
contributed to the Universitys success. It was great to spend the
evening with many FHSU alumni and supporters as we celebrated the
universitys outstanding achievements. I appreciated the opportunity to
speak with Dr. Mirta Martin on her first year as FHSUs President and
the great things happening at FHSU.
Honoring Captain Christopher Norgren
On Friday, flags across Kansas were flown at half-staff to honor fallen
Marine and Wichita native Chris Norgren. Chris was killed on May 12
aboard a Marine helicopter that crashed while delivering disaster aid
to earthquake victims in Nepal. His bravery serves as an inspiration to
us all, and I attended his funeral to pay respects on behalf of all
Kansans and Americans.
Visiting with Kansas Students in Washington
Over the past couple weeks, its been a real pleasure to visit with
students from across the state visiting our nations capital including
Blue Valley Northwests We the People group, Nemaha Central Middle
School and students from McPherson, Geneseo, Windom, Little River,
Claflin, Bushton and Holyrood. I shared with them how my interest in
politics began when I came to Washington as an intern during college,
and I appreciated their questions on current issues facing our state
and nation.

The deadline for fall internship applications is quickly approaching,
and anyone interested should submit their application before Friday,
June 26. Application forms can be obtained and completed under the

Cyber
Attack
at
United
States
Office
of
Personnel
Management
Affects
Millions
It
was
troubling
to
hear
the
news
Thursday
of
a
massive
cyber
attack
breaching
the
personal
information
of
4
million
current
and
former
federal
employees
stored
at
the
Office
of
Personnel
Management
(OPM).
Even
more
troubling
is
the
fact
that
this
is
the
second
OPM
breach
in
less
than
a
year.
These
cyber
criminals,
which
some
have
suggested
are
state-sponsored,
gained
access
to
4
million
federal
government
employee
records
including
Social
Security
numbers,
job
assignments,
performance
ratings
and
training
information.
Last
year
in
an
Appropriations
Subcommittee
hearing,
I
asked
a
number
of
questions
to
OPM
Director
Archuleta
about
how
to
attract
and
retain
cyber
talent
within
the
federal
workforce
to
protect
against
breaches
like
this.
As
Chair
of
the
Senate
Commerce
Subcommittee
for
Consumer
Protection,
Product
Safety,
Insurance
and
Data
Security,
I
will
pursue
answers
to
how
this
breach
occurred,
how
long
the
hackers
were
in
the
system,
and
what
steps
the
federal
government
should
be
taking
to
protect
other
agencies
and
sensitive
information.
Senate
Votes
on
Legislation
to
Extend
Government's
Surveillance
Authorities
This
week,
the
Senate
passed
the
USA
FREEDOM
Act
&#150;
legislation
altering
and
extending
the
government&#146;s
surveillance
authorities.
I
voted
against
the
bill
as
I
am
concerned
by
the
government&#146;s
domestic
data
collection
practices
and
the
intrusion
of
the
privacy
of
American
citizens.
The
U.S.
intelligence
community
should
be
equipped
with
the
tools
necessary
to
reduce
national
security
risks,
but
the
USA
FREEDOM
Act
fails
to
provide
the
reform
necessary
to
safeguard
individual
rights.
At
the
same
time,
it
does
not
adequately
improve
the
security
of
Americans.
Effective
intelligence
gathering
does
not
have
to
come
at
the
expense
of
civil
liberties.
Limited
debate
in
the
Senate
failed
to
yield
appropriately
meaningful
reforms.
By
waiting
until
the
last
few
days
before
expiration
to
address
the
legislation,
Americans
were
shortchanged
in
finding
a
responsible
solution.
I
will
continue
to
push
for
intelligence
policies
that
protect
both
national
security
and
the
privacy
of
American
citizens.
Frustrating
Update
from
Colmery-O&#146;Neil
VA
Medical
Center
My
request
for
an
update
about
the
delay
in
reopening
Colmery-O&#146;Neil&#146;s
emergency
department
this
week
resulted
in
frustrating
news
from
VA
Deputy
Secretary
Sloan
Gibson
&#150;
certain
emergency
department
service
areas
aren&#146;t
yet
fully
capable
of
meeting
the
needs
of
the
veterans.
Colmery-O&#146;Neil
has
a
plan
in
place
to
address
these
areas
and
will
seek
approval
to
reopen
in
the
coming
weeks.
While
my
first
priority
is
the
safety
and
quality
of
care
for
veterans,
I
will
continue
to
work
with
Congresswoman
Jenkins
to
press
the
VA
until
this
issue
is
resolved.
Additionally,
this
week
at
a
Senate
Veterans&#146;
Affairs
Committee
Hearing
I
questioned
the
Veterans
Health
Administration
Assistant
Deputy
Under
Secretary
for

Thomas

about

Environment
Protections
Act
I
joined
a
bipartisan
group
of
senators
this
week
in
introducing
legislation
to
eliminate
a
duplicative
EPA
regulation
that
results
in
added
cost
and
bureaucratic
red
tape
for
Kansas
farmers,
ranchers,
state
and
local
governments,
and
other
pesticide
applicators.
The
Sensible
Environmental
Protection
Act
(SEPA)
clarifies
Congressional
intent
concerning
the
safe
use
of
pesticides
around
bodies
of
water
under
jurisdiction
of
the
Clean
Water
Act
(CWA).
For
decades,
the
EPA
has
rigorously
regulated
pesticide
applications
under
the
Federal
Insecticide,
Fungicide
and
Rodenticide
Act
(FIFRA)
with
the
aim
to
protect
human
health
and
the
environment.
FIFRA
requires
pesticides
to
be
extensively
tested
and
registered
with
the
EPA.
Pesticide
users
must
then
strictly
comply
with
agency
approved
labels
when
applying
the
registered
pesticide.
However,
despite
this
clear
regulatory
framework
in
place,
a
2009
court
decision
forced
EPA
to
require
additional
permits
for
pesticide
use
under
the
CWA.
SEPA
would
eliminate
this
unnecessary
and
redundant
permitting
requirement
for
pesticides
that
hinders
stakeholders
without
any
environmental
benefit.

Drawing
Attention
to
Issues
at
FIFA
Last
week,
nine
FIFA
officials
and
five
corporate
executives
were
formally
charged
by
U.S.
prosecutors
for
racketeering,
wire
fraud,
and
money
laundering
&#150;
charges
that
suggest
FIFA
officials
may
have
been
bribed
to
select
certain
locations
as
host
countries
for
the
World
Cup
soccer
tournament.
This
week,
the
newly
re-elected
President
of
FIFA,
Sepp
Blatter,
who
has
presided
over
international
soccer&#146;s
governing
body
for
17
years,
announced
his
immediate
resignation
amidst
allegations
he
is
also
connected
to
the
high-profile
corruption
scandal.
As
FIFA
prepares
to
elect
a
new
president,
I
believe
now
is
an
opportunity
to
examine
some
of
the
tragic
human
rights
abuses
occurring
in
one
of
those
host
countries,
Qatar.
In
2022,
Qatar
is
scheduled
to
host
the
FIFA
World
Cup.
The
country,
which
has
a
population
of
less
than
300,000
citizens,
plans
to
import
as
many
as
500,000
migrant
workers
to
construct
the
World
Cup
stadiums.
Last
year
ESPN
aired
a
riveting
documentary,
which
highlighted
the
unsanitary
living
conditions,
troubling
working
conditions
and
extreme
heat
that
has
cost
nearly
700
lives
in
recent
years.
Should
the
pace
of
death
continue,
as
many
as
6,000
workers
are
expected
to
lose
their
life
before
the
first
World
Cup
2022
game
begins.
As
Chairman
of
the
Commerce
Subcommittee
on
Consumer
Protection,
Product
Safety,
Insurance,
and
Data
Security,
our
jurisdiction
includes
sports.
I
intend
to
hold
a
hearing
to
examine
these
abuses
in
Qatar,
and
determine
how
the
United
States
can
play
a
productive
role
in
encouraging
the
new
president
of
FIFA
to
improve
worker
conditions
and
restore
integrity
to
the
organization.

Visiting
Central
Kansas
Hospitals
On
Friday
afternoon,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
visit
health
care
providers
and
hospital
administrators
at
two
Kansas
community
hospitals
to
learn
more
about
their
efforts
to
provide
quality
care
to
patients.
First,
I
visited
Stafford
County
Hospital
(SCH),
a
25-bed
Critical
Access
Hospital
(CAH)
serving
the
community
since
1961.
SCH
provides
a
wide
range
of
services,
including
imaging
and
laboratory
services,
physical,
occupational
and
speech
therapy,
and
wound
care.
Following
my
time
in
Stafford,
I
visited
Ellinwood
District
Hospital
(EDH).
EDH
is
also
a
25-bed
CAH
providing
care
since
1952.
EDH
also
operates
a
rural
health
clinic
specializing
in
family
medicine,
which
has
seen
patients
for
more
than
20
years.
As
a
member
of
the
Senate
Appropriations
Health
Subcommittee,
which
has
funding
jurisdiction
over
most
agencies
within
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
(HHS)
that
impact
hospitals
and
providers,
meeting
with
Kansas
hospital
administrators,
physicians,
nurses,
and
other
staff
gives
me
important
insight
on
the
challenges
they
face
caring
for
patients.
My
discussions
with
SCH
and
EDH
administrators
and
staff
spanned
various
topics
including
concerns
with
proposed
changes
in
Medicare
reimbursements
and
the
consequences
to
CAHs,
and
the
challenges
of
providing
quality
patient
care
under
regulations
that
do
not
account
for
the
realities
of
delivering
care
in
a
rural
setting.
It
is
important
that
the
federal
government
allow
rural
providers
the
flexibility
necessary
to
adequately
care
for
their
patients,
many
of
whom
are
older
and
live
across
wide
areas.
Thank
you
to
SCH
CEO
Todd
Taylor
and
EDH
CEO
Kile
Magner
for
hosting
my
visits
to
their
hospitals.
Working
to
Prevent
Domestic
Violence
and
Child
Abuse
in
Kansas
This
week
I
met
with
two
groups
that
are
working
to
end
domestic
violence
and
child
abuse:
the
Kansas
Coalition
Against
Sexual
and
Domestic
Violence
and
the
Children's
Advocacy
Centers
of
Kansas.
On
Wednesday,
I
met
with
Joyce
Grover
to
discuss
the
Kansas
Coalition
Against
Sexual
and
Domestic
Violence
(KCSDV).
KSCDV
is
a
nonprofit
network
that
works
to
prevent
and
eliminate
sexual
and
domestic
violence
across
our
state.
The
ongoing
efforts
of
KCSDV
are
critical
to
the
individuals
and
families
it
serves,
as
well
as
the
various
organizations
it
coordinates
with.
I
appreciated
the
chance
to
visit
with
such
a
respected
leader
on
this
important
issue.
The
Children's
Advocacy
Centers
of
Kansas
visited
with
my
staff
about
their
work
to
prevent
abuse
and
keep
children
safe.
In
2014,
the
Child
Advocacy
Centers
of
Kansas
served
over
4,000
children.
Among
other
things,
the
CACs&#146;
work
assists
law
enforcement
and
the
judicial
system
efficiently
process
child
abuse
cases
while
prioritizing
the
child&#146;s
health
and
safety.
Continuing
Kansas
Listening
Tour
Stops
I
continued
my
Kansas
Listening
Tour
stops
with
visits
to
Ellis
and
Barton
Counties
on
Saturday.
For
a
list

Ellis
County
More
than
50
Hays-area
residents
joined
me
for
a
Kansas
Listening
Tour
stop
in
Ellis
County.
We
discussed
a
number
of
issues
including
health
care
for
rural
veterans,
the
Fair
Tax,
national
security,
and
the
importance
of
improving
our
country
for
future
generations.

Area
Chamber
of
Commerce
Executive
Director
Tammy
Wellbrock
and
the
City
of
Hays
Welcome
Center
for
hosting
my
visit.
Barton
County
Thanks
to
the
Barton
County
area
residents
who
attended
my
Kansas
Listening
Tour
stop
in
Hoisington.
The
conversation
focused
on
a
number
of
issues
of
importance
to
our
state
and
nation
including
veterans'
health
care,
Critical
Access
Hospitals,
frustration
with
the
Affordable
Care
Act
and
the
Farmer
Veteran
Coalition .
Thanks
also
to
Hoisington
Chamber
of
Commerce
Executive
Director
Kristi
Lovett
and
the
Hoisington
Recreation
Commission
for
hosting.
FHSU&#146;s
Annual
President&#146;s
Dinner
On
Friday,
Robba
and
I
attended
the
Fort
Hays
State
University
annual
President&#146;s
Dinner,
which
is
held
every
year
to
thank
those
who
have
contributed
to
the
University&#146;s
success.
It
was
great
to
spend
the
evening
with
many
FHSU
alumni
and
supporters
as
we
celebrated
the
university&#146;s
outstanding
achievements.
I
appreciated
the
opportunity
to
speak
with
Dr.
Mirta
Martin
on
her
first
year
as
FHSU&#146;s
President
and
the
great
things
happening
at
FHSU.
Honoring
Captain
Christopher
Norgren
On
Friday,
flags
across
Kansas
were
flown
at
half-staff
to
honor
fallen
Marine
and
Wichita
native
Chris
Norgren.
Chris
was
killed
on
May
12
aboard
a
Marine
helicopter
that
crashed
while
delivering
disaster
aid
to
earthquake
victims
in
Nepal.
His
bravery
serves
as
an
inspiration
to
us
all,
and
I
attended
his
funeral
to
pay
respects
on
behalf
of
all
Kansans
and
Americans.
Visiting
