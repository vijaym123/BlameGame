News from Representative Lou Barletta
The State of Our Union
Sunday, February 9, 2014
After the State of the Union, I joined C-SPAN in the historic Statutory
Hall to discuss my initial thoughts of the president's address.
A week ago, President Obama tried to convince us that our economy is
better off today than it was when he first took office.
However, our
national debt is 18 trillion dollars and growing, the roll-out of the
Affordable Care Act has proven disastrous, and executive overreach has
become the new normal in Washington.
The president talks about "income inequality" but his policies have
done nothing to help close that gap, much less spur the economy or
create jobs.
I believe the best way to address this divide is to put
hardworking Americans back to work.
We should invest in our small
businesses, our infrastructure, and the next generation of our nation's
workforce.
More government regulations will only add fuel to the fire,
amplifying existing problems that our country cannot afford.
On immigration reform, I'm unconvinced that 'legal status' is anything
less than the functional equivalent of amnesty.
I've seen very little
throughout this debate to assure me that we will permanently secure our
borders. Failure to do so will repeat the mistakes of the 1986 amnesty
law that gave birth to the illegal immigration crisis our country has
faced for the last two decades.
This past year Americans suffered countless broken promises from the
president.
If we hope to ensure equal opportunities for all Americans,
a 'pen and phone' strategy is not the answer.
From Washington...
Protecting Our Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Personnel from the
Affordable Care Act
Last week, the House Ways and Means Committee passed my Protecting
Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act by a unanimous vote
of 37-0.
This bill ensures that emergency services volunteers are not taken into
account as full-time employees under the Employer Mandate Provision of
the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
Emergency services volunteers would
include volunteer firefighters and volunteers providing emergency
medical services (EMTs), and ambulance services.
The bill was slightly
revised, with just technical edits and now has the bill number H.R.
3979.
I am pleased the Committee voted in favor of my bill, which is an
important step towards a vote on the House floor.
Simply put, this is
a public safety issue and its impact on volunteer firefighters and EMTs
represents special and urgent circumstances.
We owe it to the brave
men and women who volunteer to protect our communities each and every
day to fully ensure they are not adversely affected by the ACA.
Last month, the IRS indicated that they will not count hours of
volunteer firefighters and emergency medical personnel when determining
an employer's full-time employees in compliance with the ACA; however,
final regulations have not been issued.
In the meantime, Congress must take legislative action by passing this
bill, so the president can sign it into law. Firehouses and
municipalities across the country need assurance that they won't have
to pay costly fines or shut their doors.
Ensuring Economic Stability
On January 15, 2014, the House passed the FY14 Appropriations bill
(H.R. 3547) by a strong bipartisan vote of 359-67, to fund the federal
government through September 30, 2014.
This important legislation provides total discretionary spending of
$1.012 trillion - consistent with the level provided in the Bipartisan
Budget Act of 2013 - and provides specific funding amounts for the
programs and services relied on most by the American people. On January
16, 2014, the Senate also passed H.R. 3547, and the president signed
this legislation into law.
This bill represents the first time, since the Korean War, that
Congress has cut spending for four years in a row.
Even so, this is
not a perfect spending bill, but as in many cases, the perfect should
not be the enemy of the good.
It spends $165 billion less than we did in 2010, and also is $21
billion below last year's post-sequester level.
Meanwhile, defense
spending is protected, providing our troops a pay increase and
supporting operations and maintenance, which are so important for our
region of Pennsylvania.
There is no new funding for Obamacare, and in fact, the package reduces
the public health slush fund for Obamacare by a full billion dollars.
Additionally, important language prohibits the Internal Revenue
Service's use of federal funds to target specific ideological groups.
We also delay certain premium increases in the National Flood Insurance
Program and increase funding for flood control projects to advance
public safety.
In short, everyone got something, no one got everything, and we cut
spending. If you can't get the whole loaf, why not take a slice or two
and go back for the rest later?
Transportation & Infrastructure Committee Group to Seek Better Use of
Federal Property
In mid-January, I was named a member of a special panel of the House
Transportation and Infrastructure (T&I;) Committee to focus on the use
of and opportunities for public-private partnerships (P3s) across all
modes of transportation, economic development, public buildings, water,
and maritime infrastructure and equipment.
This is a great opportunity to build upon the work that I've been doing
as Chairman of the T&I; Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public
Buildings and Emergency Management, where I've already been able to
identify more than $700 million in savings to the taxpayers. The more
we can do to link the private sector and public property, the better it
is for the government, the taxpayers, and the nation.
Supporting American Farmers, Ranchers, and Consumers
As you know, agriculture is the number one industry in Pennsylvania and
is vitally important to our nation's economic recovery and national
security. On January 29, 2014, I supported and the House passed the
Farm Bill Conference Report by a bipartisan vote of 251-166. This
five-year farm bill offers certainty to over 16 million Americans whose
jobs depend on agriculture, while reducing the deficit and growing the
economy.
Like in any compromise, no one gets everything they wanted, but I voted
for this bill because it provides our farmers with five years of
stability and consistency and protects American consumers. Crop
insurance is strengthened so that farmers will be better equipped to
deal with risks that threaten their ability to produce goods. Consumers
will benefit from a stable marketplace and won't have to worry about
paying inflated prices for necessary food items, like milk.
Importantly, it ensures food security. Our ability to grow our own food
isn't just an agricultural issue; it's a national security issue. If we
rely on imported foods from foreign countries, we risk jeopardizing the
long-term security of our communities and the nation as a whole.
In the end, the Farm Bill saves taxpayers approximately $16.6 billion.
This bipartisan bill is good for farmers as well as consumers.
I am pleased that the U.S. Senate also passed the Farm Bill and this
legislation now goes to the president for his signature.
...To Pennsylvania
Tunkhannock Main Street Tour
On January 22, I toured Tunkhannock area businesses and spoke to owners
and residents about their ideas and concerns regarding today's economic
climate.
I was honored to visit Monzie's Floral Design, the Prince Hotel, the
Dietrich Theater (top right), Gay's True Value Hardware (left), and
Beagles (bottom right).
Businesses like these family owned stores and
historical landmarks provide for economic stability in towns like
Tunkhannock. We need to do everything possible in Washington to cut red
tape and esnure they continue to drive their local economies and create
jobs for Pennsylvanians across the 11th Congressional District.
To see more pictures and information about my Main Street Tours, visit
my Facebook page.
Honoring Our Veterans
One of the great honors I have is to present long-deserved medals to
our military veterans. On January 17, I did just that at my Hazleton
district office (pictured above).
Receiving medals were: David Sturdevant, of Tunkhannock, served in the
U.S. Air Force from 1965 to 1969; George W. Zeeb (deceased), of West
Hazleton, served in the U.S. Army from 1944 to 1946, in Company L, 85th
Mountain Infantry Regiment, 10th Mountain Division; and Joseph C.
Heintz, of Hazleton, served in the U.S. Army, National Guard and
Reserves from 1947 to 1990.
Legislative Update
Cosponsored Legislation:
*	Electricity Security and Affordability Act (H.R. 3826), which
would address the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) new source
performance standards. This bill would provide specific direction to
the EPA regarding the establishment of standards for new plants, while
allowing Congress the authority to set the effective date of
regulations on existing power plants.
*	Flood Insurance Relief and Transparency Act (H.R. 3693) and the
Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act (H.R. 3370), which would
provide relief for National Flood Insurance Plan policy holders
impacted by Biggert Waters.
*	Strengthening Child Welfare Response to Trafficking Act (H.R.
1732), which would require state foster care programs to report on
current efforts to address the human trafficking and commercial sexual
exploitation of children in their care.
*	Children's Health Insurance Protection (CHIP) Act (H.R. 3931),
which would allow states, like Pennsylvania, to have the flexibility to
maintain successful CHIP programs, and ensure that children are not
forced into Medicaid if they are in a strong health program
pre-Obamacare.
Letters Sent to:
*	The president asking to restore Low Income Home Energy
Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funding for FY15. The letter requests that
the president include $4.7 billion for the LIHEAP program in his FY15
Budget.
*	Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member Rahall of the House
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to fully fund the Highway
Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) and allow for flexibility in
transfering of HSIP funds to other programs.
Important Vote: The Health Exchange Security and Transparency Act
On January 10, I supported, and the House passed, the Health Exchange
Security and Transparency Act (H.R. 3811) by a 291-122 vote.
The bill
responds to concerns that people's personally identifiable information
is at risk because of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and requires the
Department of Health and Human Services to notify individuals within
two days if their information has been stolen or unlawfully accessed.
We've been asked to believe promises about the functionality of the
website at each step of the way, but with very few exceptions, those
promises have not been kept.
This bill is necessary to protect people
from thieves who would prey on their readily available information.

The
State
of
Our

Sunday,
February
9,
2014
After
the
State
of
the
Union,
I
joined
C-SPAN
in
the
historic
Statutory

to
discuss
my
initial
thoughts
of
the

President
Obama
tried
to
convince
us
that
our

is
better

than
it
was
when
he
first
took
office.
However,
our

and
growing,
the
roll-out
of

The

talks
about
&#8220;income

but
his
policies
have
done
nothing
to
help
close
that
gap,
much
less
spur
the
economy
or
create
jobs.
I
believe
the
best
way
to
address
this
divide
is
to
put
hardworking
Americans
back
to
work.
We
should
invest
in
our
small
businesses,
our
infrastructure,
and
the
next
generation
of
our
nation&#8217;s
workforce.
More
government
regulations
will
only
add

the

existing
problems
that
our

cannot

crisis
our

has
faced
for
the

two
decades.
This

If

is
not

Simply

Ensuring
Economic
Stability
On

15,
2014,
the
House
passed
the
FY14
Appropriations
bill
(H.R.
3547)
by
a
strong
bipartisan
vote
of
359-67,
to
fund
the
federal
government
through
September
30,
2014.
This
important
legislation
provides
total
discretionary
spending
of
$1.012
trillion
&#8211;
consistent
with
the
level
provided
in
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act
of
2013
&#8211;
and
provides
specific
funding
amounts
for
the
programs
and
services
relied
on
most
by
the
American
people.
On
January
16,
2014,
the
Senate
also
passed
H.R.
3547,
and
the
president
signed
this
legislation
into
law.
This
bill
represents
the
first
time,
since
the
Korean
War,
that
Congress
has
cut
spending
for
four
years
in
a
row .
Even
so,
this
is
not
a
perfect
spending
bill,
but
as
in
many
cases,
the
perfect
should
not
be
the
enemy
of
the
good.
It
spends
$165
billion
less
than
we
did
in
2010,
and
also
is
$21
billion
below
last
year&#8217;s
post-sequester
level.
Meanwhile,
defense
spending
is
protected,
providing
our
troops
a
pay
increase
and
supporting
operations
and
maintenance,
which
are
so
important
for
our
region
of
Pennsylvania.
There
is
no
new
funding
for
Obamacare,
and
in
fact,
the
package
reduces
the
public
health
slush
fund
for
Obamacare
by
a
full
billion
dollars.
Additionally,
important
language
prohibits
the
Internal
Revenue
Service&#8217;s
use
of
federal
funds
to
target
specific
ideological
groups.
We
also
delay
certain
premium
increases
in
the
National
Flood
Insurance
Program
and
increase
funding
for
flood
control
projects
to
advance
public
safety.
In
short,
everyone
got
something,
no
one
got
everything,
and
we
cut
spending.
If
you
can&#8217;t

why
not
take
a

or

and
go

Transportation
&amp;
Infrastructure
Committee
Group
to
Seek
Better
Use
of
Federal
Property
In
mid-January,
I
was
named
a
member
of
a
special
panel
of
the
House
Transportation
and
Infrastructure
(T&amp;I)
Committee
to
focus
on
the
use
of
and
opportunities
for
public-private
partnerships
(P3s)
across
all
modes
of
transportation,
economic
development,
public
buildings,
water,
and
maritime
infrastructure
and
equipment.
This
is
a
great
opportunity
to
build
upon
the
work
that
I&#8217;ve
been
doing
as
Chairman
of
the
T&amp;I
Subcommittee
on
Economic
Development,
Public
Buildings
and
Emergency
Management,
where
I&#8217;ve
already
been
able
to
identify
more
than
$700
million
in
savings
to
the
taxpayers.
The
more
we
can
do
to
link
the
private
sector
and
public
property,
the
better
it
is
for
the
government,
the
taxpayers,
and
the
nation.
Supporting
American
Farmers,
Ranchers,
and
Consumers
As
you
know,
agriculture
is
the
number
one
industry
in
Pennsylvania
and
is
vitally
important
to
our
nation&#8217;s
economic
recovery
and
national
security.
On
January
29,
2014,
I
supported
and
the
House
passed
the
Farm
Bill
Conference
Report
by
a
bipartisan
vote
of
251-166.
This
five-year
farm
bill
offers
certainty
to
over
16
million
Americans
whose
jobs
depend
on
agriculture,
while
reducing
the
deficit
and
growing
the
economy.
Like
in
any
compromise,
no
one
gets
everything
they
wanted,
but
I
voted
for
this
bill
because
it
provides
our
farmers
with
five
years
of
stability
and
consistency
and
protects
American
consumers.
Crop
insurance
is
strengthened
so
that
farmers
will
be
better
equipped
to
deal
with
risks
that
threaten
their
ability
to
produce
goods.
Consumers
will
benefit
from
a
stable
marketplace
and
won&#8217;t
have
to
worry
about
paying
inflated
prices
for
necessary
food
items,
like
milk.
Importantly,
it
ensures
food
security.
Our
ability
to
grow
our
own
food
isn&#8217;t
just
an
agricultural
issue;
it&#8217;s
a
national
security
issue.
If
we
rely
on
imported
foods
from
foreign
countries,
we
risk
jeopardizing
the
long-term
security
of
our
communities
and
the
nation
as
a
whole.
In
the
end,
the
Farm
Bill
saves
taxpayers
approximately
$16.6
billion.
This
bipartisan
bill
is
good
for
farmers
as
well
as
consumers.
I
am
pleased
that
the
U.S.
Senate
also
passed
the
Farm
Bill
and
this
legislation
now
goes
to
the
president
for
his
signature.
...To
Pennsylvania Tunkhannock
Main
Street
Tour
On
January
22,
I
toured
Tunkhannock
area
businesses
and
spoke
to
owners
and
residents
about
their
ideas
and
concerns
regarding
today&#8217;s
economic

Businesses
like
these
family
owned
stores
and
historical
landmarks
provide
for
economic
stability
in
towns
like
Tunkhannock.
We
need
to
do
everything
possible
in
Washington
to
cut
red
tape
and
esnure
they
continue
to
drive
their
local
economies
and
create
jobs
for

the
11th

Important
Vote:
The
Health
Exchange
Security
and
Transparency
Act
On
January
10,
I
supported,
and
the
House
passed,
the
Health
Exchange
Security
and
Transparency
Act
(H.R.
3811)
by
a
291-122
vote.
The
bill
responds
to
concerns
that
people&#8217;s
personally
identifiable
information
is
at
risk
because
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act
(ACA),
and
requires
the
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
to
notify
individuals
within
two
days
if
their
information
has
been
stolen
or
unlawfully
accessed.
We&#8217;ve
been
asked
to
believe
promises
about
the
functionality
of
the
website
at
each
step
of
the
way,
but
with
very
few
exceptions,
those
promises
have
not
been
kept.
This
bill
is
necessary
to
protect
people
from
thieves
who
would
prey
on
their
readily
available
information. How
