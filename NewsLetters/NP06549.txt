We know, David. We ask a lot. ( Ok, a ton ).
There&rsquo;s a good reason why:
-- In 2012, Bob Dold and outside groups spent more than $8,000,000 against us.
-- In 2014, they&rsquo;re on pace to spend even more to beat up on Brad&rsquo;s progressive record.
But the most important reason is simple: -- If we don&rsquo;t have the resources to respond, we could lose.
That might sound grim, but it&rsquo;s the truth. Will you rush a donation of $5 or more to help Brad get out the facts to Illinois voters?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Brad&rsquo;s in a down-to-the-wire fight.
He&rsquo;s working day and night to make sure Illinois&rsquo;s 10th District is represented by a Democrat -- not a reliable Republican.
David, there&rsquo;s so much at stake. Please chip in to have Brad&rsquo;s back. http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/Fight
When polls close, we don&rsquo;t want to have any regrets.
Let&rsquo;s get to work.
