Congressman Lamborn Supports
Suspending the Individual
Mandate
3/5/14
Today,
Congressman Lamborn supported H.R. 4118, the Suspending the Individual
Mandate Penalty Law Equals Fairness Act. H.R. 4118 passed the House
by a bipartisan vote of 250 to 160. This bill delays the enforcement of
the individual mandate penalty for one
year.
"This legislation delays the individual
mandate, one of the most egregious portions of Obamacare. With the
President handing out arbitrary delays and exemptions to various interest
groups, it is time for the American people to join that list.
Individuals must be protected from the unworkable mandates of
Obamacare."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
(CO-05)
