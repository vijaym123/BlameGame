Today, I spoke on the House Floor in defense of the legal requirement for our Navy to maintain at least 11 aircraft carriers in its fleet. This number is not arbitraryit is the number of carriers the Navy needs to maintain a global presence and conduct current and future operations under our national security strategy.
Reducing our carrier fleet to 10 ships would place a larger burden on the remaining force and on our military personnel by increasing the length of deployments, reducing our ships and sailors time at home, and increasing the stress on our ships and the stress on sailors and their families. In addition, it would deny the United States the floating base of operations we need to rapidly respond to crises and protect American lives and interests overseas.
Rear Admiral Thomas Moore arguably put it best when he said, We're an 11-carrier Navy in a 15-carrier world.
Reducing the statutory requirement for carriers would mean accepting risks to our men and women in uniform, our national security, and our future military readiness that I am not willing to take.
