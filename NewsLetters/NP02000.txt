Recognizing Outstanding Young
Citizens
3/27/15
"Each spring, I have the honor and privilege of
acknowledging some of the best and brightest high school students that the
Fifth Congressional District has to offer. The Congressional Art
Competition and the Service Academy Nominations are two highlights of each
and every year.
It
was absolutely incredible to see all of the talent on display at the
2015 Congressional Art Competition. I am impressed every year by the
talent showcased by the high school artists here in the Fifth
Congressional District. Thank you to Library 21c for hosting our show. Please join
me in congratulating Grand Prize Winner Grace Medran a home school
student instructed by Kenneth Shanika. Her painting will hang in the
Capitol for a year and she will be flown to Washington DC for a winner's
reception at the White House! It is an amazing privilege to be able to
provide a platform for wonderful young
artists."
