Dear Friend,
All of our goals are important, but with so little time before the election,
this one is critical.
We&rsquo;re counting on your support to help us make the most of October, when we&rsquo;ll be working all across Massachusetts to get out the vote.
We need fighters like Ed in the Senate. We need Senators who understand the challenge of climate change and who will work to protect Medicare and Social Security.
And your support will help power Ed to victory on November 4th. 15 hours, $5,689 left to go to reach our $145,OOO FEC goal -- I know we can do it. Chip in $5 if you can before it&rsquo;s too late!
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Thank you.
Colleen
