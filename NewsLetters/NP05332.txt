Friend -- The Koch brothers and their friends funneled $20,000,000 into a final push to buy the Senate. This is NOT good:
Republicans just took the financial edge in EIGHT races.
The GOP must gain only SIX seats to take control.
The Senate is now projected to come down to a single seat that could flip EITHER WAY.
It&rsquo;s all up to you:
If you help fund our Emergency Media Campaign, we can get on the air, match GOP attacks dollar for dollar, and win.
But if we fall short before the midnight deadline, unanswered attacks could tip the Senate to the GOP in the final 18 days.
Will you pitch in to the Emergency Media Campaign before midnight? Your gift will be TRIPLE-MATCHED for 8 more hours.
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
If you help us fund this absolutely crucial response, Mitch McConnell and Ted Cruz&rsquo;s chance at a Senate majority will be GONE.
&ldquo;If Republicans&hellip; fall one seat short of controlling the Senate, it will rank among the most crushing failures in recent political history,&rdquo; according to
ABC News . But we can ONLY do it with your help.
If you pitch in to the Emergency Media Campaign before midnight, we&rsquo;ll triple-match your gift and use it to respond to GOP attacks IMMEDIATELY.
