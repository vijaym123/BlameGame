Rep. Bob Goodlatte
Happy New Year!
Best wishes for a safe, healthy, and prosperous 2015
to you and your family.
Looking Ahead
at the 114th Congress
As the House of Representatives and the Senate kick off the 114th Congress, there are many
opportunities ahead for the new Congress to work together on behalf of the American people. In recent years, many House-passed jobs bills have run
into the Washington version of quicksand known as the United States Senate. Fortunately, in November the American people delivered a clear message to
Washington. They are more interested in results than the latest filibuster. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House as well as
incoming Majority Leader McConnell in the Senate to see important legislation moved through Congress this year.
While we have made small strides in cutting federal spending, much more must be done to get the United
States&rsquo; fiscal house in order. The $18 trillion dollar national debt threatens to bankrupt future generations and further stall the already
sluggish economy. Additional measures to cut federal spending and reduce the deficit will be required to put our nation back on a path toward fiscal
responsibility. This includes a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, which I plan to introduce in the House once again.
Another issue we must address is common sense tax reform. I plan to introduce legislation to
scrap the current tax code and compel Congress to simplify the tax code, which will generate economic growth and create jobs by making America more
competitive in the global economy. I will also continue working to protect students&rsquo; college choice by fighting the Administration&rsquo;s
misguided plan to rate colleges and universities based on standardized measures.
As Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, I will continue to pursue a pro-growth agenda that is focused on creating jobs and making
America more competitive and free. The Committee will work to advance policies with the goal of protecting and promoting intellectual property rights,
a major driving force and job-creating engine of our economy. I will also continue to push legislation that helps protect the rights and liberties of
American citizens and reforms our nation&rsquo;s intelligence-gathering programs.
I hope you will stay in touch throughout the coming year. You can contact me by visiting one of my offices located in the Sixth District or

staff in communities each month.
A new year is upon us, and like many
around the nation I am hopeful for what 2015 will bring. I will continue to remain focused on tackling the challenges facing America today in order to
create a better future for the next generation.
Want Net Neutrality? Enforce our anti-trust laws .
The Internet
is one of the most dynamic and competitive marketplaces in existence and has become a cornerstone of the American economy and culture. Consequently,
concerns about the future of an open and fair Internet, broadly coined as &ldquo;net neutrality,&rdquo; have rightfully risen to the forefront of the
national debate.
Increasing regulation on the rapidly growing and
dynamic Internet would be a mistake and undermine the intent of net neutrality, which is to maintain a free, open, and competitive Internet. The key
to an open and free Internet lies in strong enforcement of our nation&rsquo;s antitrust laws.
