Dear Friend, It&rsquo;s been five years since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) became law, and the numbers tell a good story
-- 16.4 million people now have health insurance, medical inflation is down, and the the total price tag is about 20% lower than we thought it might be.
But even though the evidence makes clear the law is working, the GOP still wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act. So it&rsquo;s up to us to stop them. I&rsquo;m joining my colleagues to stand up for affordable health care and tell the Republicans to stop their attacks. Add your name to ours right now.
I could tell early on that the Affordable Care Act was going to work. That&rsquo;s not because I have a crystal ball, it&rsquo;s because Massachusetts had already passed a health reform law that looked an awful lot like the ACA.
After we passed health care reform in Massachusetts, we saw more employers offering health insurance. And now we have 98% of all our citizens covered. These numbers do not lie.
But this won&rsquo;t stop my Republican colleagues who continue to do their best to deny reality. They will continue to claim that the Affordable Care Act is too expensive, even as it comes in under budget; they will continue to claim that the law will kill jobs, even as our economic recovery continues. All we can do is push back hard, knowing that the facts are on our side. Stand up for affordable health care -- sign our petition and tell Republicans to stop trying to take away health care reform.
Thanks,
Ed
