The
USDA Rural Development Section 502 Direct Loan
Program
provides low and very low income people the opportunity to
acquire, build, rehabilitate, or improve single family dwellings in rural
areas.
Under this program, borrowers receive a loan directly from
USDA Rural Development.
The standard term for a section 502
loan is 33 years.
However, loans may be made for a shorter term,
and in some cases for 38 years.
Each loan is made at a fixed rate
established by the Agency and payment subsidies are available to many
(income eligible) borrowers to reduce monthly loan payments.
