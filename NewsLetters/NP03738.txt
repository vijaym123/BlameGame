Congressman Lamborn Joins Bipartisan Effort to Rescind EPA's Carbon
Dioxide Emissions Plan
12/19/14
Today, Congressman
Doug Lamborn joined dozens of his colleagues in a bipartisan letter to
President Obama expressing concern regarding proposed rule changes by
the EPA entitled, "Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing
Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating
Units.
Text from the
letter
The EPA specifically directs
states to consider renewable energy standards, generation dispatch
changes, co-firing or switching to natural gas, construction of new
natural gas combined-cycle plants, transmission efficiency improvements,
energy storage technology, plant retirements, expanding renewables like
wind and solar, expanding nuclear, market-based trading programs, and
demand-side energy efficiency and conservation programs.
Under
the rule, the EPA would also have the ability to impose its own
alternate federal energy plan on a state in the event EPA did not approve a
states plan. We agree that states should be free under their own laws
to pursue these types of energy policies and activities within their
own borders, but it is not the role of the EPA to exercise ultimate
authority over a states electricity
system.
Furthermore, the Members of
Congress stressed the importance of maintaining affordable and reliable
electricity citing EPAs own projections that there would be additional
power plant retirements and electricity rate increases.
If
this were to occur, it would "threaten electricity reliability and drive
up energy costs for consumers, including the elderly, poor, and those
on fixed incomes, at a time when over 50 million Americans are
currently living in
poverty.
The Members concluded the letter by recognizing
that although some of their own views may vary on the statutory authority
of the regulations they are "all concerned that this rule is simply
unworkable as proposed and, if finalized, would effectively give EPA
control over a states generation, supply, and consumption of power.
Accordingly, we respectfully ask that you direct the EPA to withdraw its
proposed
rule.
