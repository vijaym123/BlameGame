A Personal Message from Congressman Roe
Instead of our regular weekly newsletter, the Congressman would like to share the message below.
The last six weeks have been extremely difficult for my family and me. Pam was a special lady, and I loved her very much. The sadness Im feeling now will be with me for a long time, but I know Pam would want us to carry on. She was so strong and selfless, and the number of people who have honored her life is a testament to the kind of woman she was. She touched many lives, especially mine, and I was blessed to call her my wife. Now shes with our Lord and Savior, and that brings our family comfort.
On behalf of my entire family, to everyone who has called, visited, sent a card, texted, e-mailed or prayed for us, thank you. I want you to know that each of you has helped lift our spirits and we will never forget your kindness. The days, weeks and months ahead will be difficult and we ask for your continued prayers. Again, we thank you for your support and understanding.
