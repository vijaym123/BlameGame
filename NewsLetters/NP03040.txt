Dear Friend,
This past week was National School Choice Week, an annual week of nationwide activism to shine a positive spotlight on the need for effective education options for all children.
In honor of the occasion and its purpose, earlier this week I was very proud to become an original co-sponsor of H.R. 524,
the Local Control of Education Act , which will prohibit the federal government from mandating that states
adopt a specific curriculum or set of academic standards, as the
problematic Common Core program currently does.
Over the past several years, the Obama administration has used a combination of waivers and grants to coerce states into adopting Common Core. This has resulted in unprecedented federal overreach into instructional content, academic standards, and assessments. Moreover, states that have adopted the standards face losing their waivers should they choose to replace Common Core.
This commonsense bill would prohibit the federal government from using grants or waivers to mandate, incentivize, or coerce states into adopting Common Core, thus ensuring that control over education is properly left to the states.
Also this week, I was proud to co-sponsor and vote for H.R. 351,
the LNG Permitting Certainty & Transparency Act ,
which will eliminate existing red tape holding back energy independence, job creation, and American manufacturing.
It would expedite the approval of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports by
requiring the Department of Energy (DOE) to issue a final decision on export applications within 30 days of the conclusion of the NEPA environmental review of the LNG facilities.
By
2018, the construction of new LNG export projects is estimated to
create up to
45,000 new American jobs .
The bill was passed by the House on Wednesday by a vote of 277-133 with bipartisan support.
Finally, this week saw the U.S. Senate follow the House's lead
by
voting to approve the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline
for the very first time.
Both houses of Congress, leaders in both parties, and a consistent majority of the American people now
support this commonsense project. It will create thousands of jobs,
strengthen our allies, and bring us closer to energy independence.
It's time for President Obama to listen to America and finally say "Yes" to the Keystone XL pipeline.
Sincerely,
Rep. Kelly

Rep. Kelly Supports Bipartisan Bills to End Human Trafficking
On Tuesday, Rep. Kelly
issued the following statement in support of
a series of bipartisan bills
to combat human trafficking which were passed by the House of Representatives that afternoon with unanimous support:
"Today I was proud to stand with a united House of Representatives in support of these bipartisan bills to stop human trafficking and save the victims of this evil scourge. This is not a Republican or Democrat issue but a full-fledged American issue. This mission is an urgent moral priority for decent people of all nations, especially the United States-the greatest defender of liberty and human dignity the world has ever known. After all, this crime is not a faraway problem only plaguing other places but a growing cancer right here in America, including in Western Pennsylvania. Even as
National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month
comes to an end, our fight will continue until 21st century slavery is stamped out forever."

Rep. Kelly Co-Sponsors Bill to Strengthen College Savings Plans for Hardworking American Families
Rep. Kelly issued the following statement on Wednesday announcing his co-sponsorship of
H.R. 529 , legislation introduced this week to expand, modernize, and strengthen tax-free 529 college savings plans:
"Even though President Obama has now
abandoned his reckless idea to punish middle-income families by taxing 529 college saving plans , those of us in Congress who want to protect hardworking Americans from new taxes must remain vigilant. These savings plans make it easier for millions of households to send their children to college, which encourages more students to pursue higher education, which in turn puts young adults on a stronger path to rewarding careers. This bipartisan bill strengthens and updates this massively popular savings tool so that our nation's families and students can continue to benefit from it."
NOTE:
The importance and popularity of 529 college savings plans have grown substantially as more and more middle-income families are using them to save for college. Since the bipartisan creation of Section 529 in 1996, these plans have expanded to nearly 12 million accounts and have resulted in college savings of more than $225 billion for American families. The
Pennsylvania 529 College Savings Program
consists of 13 different investment plans and helps Pennsylvanians keep pace with increasingly expensive college tuition.
H.R. 529
makes three important improvements to 529 savings plans, enhancing what is a successful model for helping students attend college. It achieves the following:
Modernize 529 plans by adding computers to the list of qualified expenses.
Allow funds to be re-deposited without taxes or penalties if a student withdraws early for medical reasons and obtains a refund from the school.
Removes unnecessary paperwork burdens that date back to before withdrawals from 529 plans became tax-free.
