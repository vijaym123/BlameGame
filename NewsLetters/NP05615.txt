URGENT: All Gifts Today Matched Today's ad buy deadline is the most critical of the election. This is our last chance to rescue Democrats drowning in Koch-funded attacks. Can you chip in $5 or more?
We're drowning, and we just don't know what else to do.
This morning,
President Obama emailed you to ask for your help&hellip;
At first,
it look like we were well on our way to our goal&hellip;
But then,
Boehner&rsquo;s allies just dropped
$1O,371,656
worth of Obama-bashing attacks ad
This isn&rsquo;t a garden-variety ad buy. This is a Republican secret money rout.
Here's what that means: our goals just skyrocketed.
And now we need 9 more donations from 60659 zip code before tonight&rsquo;s ad buy deadline to keep pace.
David Johnson Suggested Support: $5.OO (ad buy deadline: 11:59pm)
There&rsquo;s no falling short here. If we don't hit this goal TODAY, we might as well just pack up and go home. We hate to ask you again -- but can you answer the President&rsquo;s call-to-action today? MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: All Gifts
