Message from Congressman Keith Ellison
Dear Neighbor-
We Minnesotans have a lot going for us. We have the best healthcare in
the country, the highest voter turnout, and some of the most beautiful
wilderness in the world. But what I think makes our state really
special is the way our diverse community overcomes differences and
works together to make our state a better place to live for every
Minnesotan.
Last week the Minnesota congressional delegation joined together to do
just that. With the help of all eight of Minnesota's Representatives,
the House passed language I sponsored to protect our state's economy
and environment by slowing the spread of invasive carp in Minnesota's
waterways.
Thousands of Minnesotans rely on our lakes and rivers for work and
recreation. According to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,
there is one boat for every six Minnesotans. Invasive carp, which can
grow to over 60 pounds and can jump as high as 10 feet out of the
water, pose a huge risk to recreational boaters and fisherman. Carp
would crowd out native species like Walleye. In rivers where invasive
carp get established, they can make up 90% of the entire fish
population by weight.
Rep. Ellison speaks on the Floor of the House of Representatives about
the dangers of invasive carp.
When we work together, there is nothing we can't do. Our national and
local leadership came together last week to officially open the Target
Field Metro Station, a project decades in the making. Earlier this
year, progressives from all over the country joined me in calling for a
raise in the minimum wage, and President Obama answered by raising the
wage of new federal contractors to $10.10 an hour.
So I want to hear directly from you. If you have any suggestions about
new policies or projects that we can work on to better the 5th
District, please let me know by leaving a message on our website at
www.ellison.house.gov
, or by calling my office at (202) 225-4755.
As always, you can stay up to date and give your feedback on the work
we are doing on behalf of the 5th District by following me on Twitter
and Facebook

Dear
Neighbor&#8212;
We
Minnesotans
have
a
lot
going
for
us.
We
have
the
best
healthcare
in
the
country,
the
highest
voter
turnout,
and
some
of
the
most
beautiful
wilderness
in
the
world.
But
what
I
think
makes
our
state
really
special
is
the
way
our
diverse
community
overcomes
differences
and
works
together
to
make
our
state
a
better
place
to
live
for
every
Minnesotan.
Last
week
the
Minnesota
congressional
delegation
joined
together
to
do
just
that.
With
the
help
of
all
eight
of
Minnesota&#8217;s
Representatives,
the
House
passed
language
I
sponsored
to
protect
our
state&#8217;s

by
slowing
the

of
invasive
carp
in
Minnesota&#8217;s
waterways.
Thousands

our

and

According
to
the
Minnesota
Department
of
Natural

there
is
one

for
every

Invasive
carp,
which
can
grow
to

can
jump
as
high

10

out
of

pose

Carp

they

When
we
work
together,
there
is
nothing
we
can&#8217;t
do.
Our
national
and
local
leadership
came
together
last
week
to
officially
open
the
Target
Field
Metro
Station,
a
project
decades
in
the
making.
Earlier
this
year,
progressives
from
all
over
the
country
joined
me
in
calling
for
a
raise
in
the
minimum
wage,
and
President
Obama
answered
by
raising
the
wage
of
new
federal
contractors
to
$10.10
an
hour.
So
I
want
to
hear
directly
from
you.
If
you
have
any
suggestions
about
new
policies
or
projects
that
we
can
work
