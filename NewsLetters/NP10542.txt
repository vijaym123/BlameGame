Friend,
It&#39;s early in the election year, and I didn&#39;t expect to be writing you this email in mid-April.
My team has just told me that
two of my opponents are already running television and radio ads in our district.
This is happening
much
earlier than we expected, and everyone around here is adamant that we ramp up our fundraising efforts IMMEDIATELY.
We&#39;ve set up a rapid response fund to make sure we&#39;re able to combat these early television and radio ads -- can you pitch in $5 now ?
Again, I know it&#39;s really early - but my opponents are already hitting the campaign trail hard, and we must have the ability to do the same.
Can you help us respond today?
Our opponents&#39; TV and radio ads mean they are communicating directly with voters-- and we need to push back.

Thanks for your support and for understanding why it&#39;s crucial we take action right now.
Thanks for standing with us.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
PS - It&#39;s only April, and my opponents are already running TV and radio ads in our district.
These attacks are early and can&#39;t go unanswered.
Can you chip in $5 here?
