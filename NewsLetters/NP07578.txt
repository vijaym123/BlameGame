Defended President Obama? NO DONATION Suggested Support: $5.00
When House Republicans broke two centuries of historical precedent to sue President Obama, we knew we&rsquo;d need a huge response.
That&rsquo;s why we were so excited to see $1,798,384 (and counting!) has come in since Republicans voted to authorize Boehner's lawsuit.
We now have a shot at hitting our $2,OOO,OOO goal to defend the President -- and defeat Boehner&rsquo;s Republican House.
With today&rsquo;s news that Republicans are openly discussing impeachment, it&rsquo;s more critical than ever that we hit our goal. David -- Can you help us crush our goal and send shockwaves through the Republican Party? ALL GIFTS TODAY TRIPLE-MATCHED!
