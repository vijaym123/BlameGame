Dear Friend,
Thank you very much for signing up for our eNewsletter. I appreciate
the opportunity to serve as your Representative. I wanted to give you
this update on our activities in the Second District and Washington,
D.C.
I was so glad to have Ivy and Lynette visit Washington, D.C. this week.
Water Infrastructure Conference Committee
Our nation's water infrastructure system is the best in the world, and
we need to fight to keep it that way and to make it more competitive.
Water infrastructure reform is very important not only to the Second
District, but to the millions of Americans that rely on our waterway
system to trade, do business, and purchase goods.
I was recently chosen to serve on the Conference Committee on water
infrastructure reform, which held its first meeting this week on two
separate bills. I believe that both chambers passed good bills, and it
is imperative that we work together to come out of conference with the
best bill possible. H.R. 3080, the Water Resources Reform and
Development Act of 2013 (WRRDA), was approved with overwhelming
bipartisan support in the House by a vote of 417-3. The Senate has its
own version of water infrastructure reform, which has resulted in the
two chambers coming together for a Conference Committee.
Conference Committee members were in agreement that working in a
bipartisan approach will allow us to accomplish much. Eight Senators
and 28 Representatives make up the committee and we are focused on
putting rhetoric aside and engaging in constructive conversation that
will actually produce results. My hope is that we leave conference with
a bill based on a foundation of good policy and reform, a bill that is
fiscally responsible, and a bill that improves our waterway system
while maintaining our Congressional authority.

Christie, Ivy and Lynette joined me as I gave over 80 Native Americans
from Oklahoma a tour of the United States Capitol.
In Washington, D.C. this week, thirty-three code talking tribes were
honored during a Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony.
Code Talkers Ceremony
It was such a privilege to attend the Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony
this week, where Native American code talkers were honored. The
Congressional Gold Medal marks Congress's highest expression of
national appreciation for distinguished achievements and contributions.
The ceremony was held in Emancipation Hall in the United States Capitol
Visitor Center.
Code talkers were a critical asset during World War I and World War II,
by providing an unprecedented avenue for message transmission. Code
talkers were Native Americans who used their respective tribal
languages to communicate coded messages and confuse the enemy.
Click the picture below to hear my remarks on the House floor about
these courageous soldiers.
These courageous individuals chose to be a part of history and take on
a unique role in war. Oklahoma was home to many code talkers including
Mr. Wayne Russell, who was a dear family friend and helped me learn
Cherokee at a young age. I consider it a privilege to be from a state
of such heritage and heroism.
Each tribe that participated in the code talkers program received a
Congressional Gold Medal. A total of 33 tribes were recognized, 10
being from the state of Oklahoma. Following the Gold Medal Ceremony
that recognized tribes as a whole, there was a Silver Medal Ceremony
that recognized specific individuals for their service as code talkers.
With only one living code talker, family members of departed code
talkers accepted the medals on their behalf.
Protecting States' Rights, Limiting Bureaucracy
Shale, oil and natural gas activity contributed to over 1.7 million
jobs last year in the United States, but the Obama Administration's
proposed regulations would cost jobs and productivity in the country's
energy sector at a time when America needs to become more energy
independent.
Duplicative layers of red tape cost Americans and Oklahomans jobs. As a
business owner, I completely understand the harm done to productivity
and employment by overzealous regulation and duplicity. Furthermore, a
one-size-fits-all approach does not fit with the unique geology in
different states. The states themselves are best equipped to make those
decisions.
Oklahoma has completed decades of energy work in an environmentally
responsible manner--we have been safely and effectively fracking since
1949. In fact, we have 193,000 current active wells in our state.
On Wednesday, the House passed H.R. 2728, the Protecting States' Rights
to Promote American Energy Security Act. The legislation, which passed
by a vote of 235-187, would limit the Obama Administration from
imposing duplicative layers of bureaucracy on hydraulic fracturing,
commonly known as "fracking." Additionally, H.R. 2728 would not permit
the Department of Interior to enforce federal hydraulic fracturing
regulations in any state that already has its own regulations in place.
Though nothing in the legislation prevents the federal government from
implementing baseline standards in states where none exist.
H.R. 2728 passed with my amendment attached, codifying that the
Department of Interior shall not enforce federal regulation of fracking
on tribal lands, as tribal lands are not public lands.
