Dear
Friend,
I predict future happiness for
Americans, if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of
the people under the pretense of taking care of
them.
- Thomas
Jefferson
In
keeping with our pledge to grow Americas economy, I wanted relay actions
taken by Congress in its 30 days.
Some of the measures passed,
with bipartisan support, will benefit economic opportunity, keep energy
costs down, assist our veterans and demonstrate that Congress can
accomplish positive things for the benefit of all Americans.
Some of
these measures include:
Approving the Keystone
pipeline;
Passing the
Hire More Heroes
Act
to make it easier
for small businesses to hire veterans without running afoul of
Obamacare;
Restoring the 40-hour workweek and protecting the paychecks
of millions of Americans;
Restoring common sense to financial
regulations to help small businesses access capital and
grow;
Expediting the licensing of liquefied natural gas exports,
both to create jobs and strengthen our national
security;
Blocking funds
to implement the Presidents unconstitutional
amnesty;
Passing 12 separate bills to combat human trafficking, protect the most
vulnerable among us, especially children, and help
survivors;
Prohibiting taxpayer funding of abortion; and
Repealing
Obamacare.
Legislation to approve the
Keystone pipeline and to help prevent veteran suicide will be on the
Presidents desk soon.
I hope the President will work positively
with the new House and Senate Majorities by signing these and other
bills into law.
This is only one month with small steps.
Much more remains to be done for the benefit of our
citizens.
With my regards and best wishes, I
remain
Most
respectfully,
John L. Mica
