, completed earlier this year by the National Commission on the Structure of the Air Force, included recommendations to the President, the Department of Defense and Congress to evaluate and improve the overall structure of the Air Force.
Specifically of note, the Commission recommended that the Air Force place greater reliance on the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve to lower overall military personnel costs and produce a more ready and capable force.
Despite this recommendation, the Administration is once again seeking to undermine one of our most capable, cost-effective resources by eliminating the entire A-10 fleet used by the Air Guard without identifying a replacement.
On May 22, 2014, the House passed the FY15 National Defense Authorization Act which would protect the A-10 fleet through 2015.
Undermining the Houses defense authorization, the Houses Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2015 originally excluded funding for the A-10 fleet in FY15. To prevent the appropriations bill from forcing the divestment of the A-10s, Rep. Miller offered an amendment that would prohibit funds from being used to divest the fleet in FY15.
Last night, the full House adopted her amendment 300-114. Today, the House passed the full appropriations measure 340-73.

House Passes Defense Funding Bill with Millers Amendment to Save the A-10s
House-passed defense appropriations bill includes amendment offered by Rep. Candice Miller that prevents the Air Force from divesting the A-10 in FY15
Washington
Today, U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10) issued the following statement after the House passed the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2015 340-73 that included her amendment, which
passed the House 300-114, that prevents the Air Force from using appropriated funds to divest the A-10:
Today, for the second time this year, after another shortsighted attempt to defund the A-10s, the House voted overwhelmingly to protect the fleet with the final passage of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2015, which included my amendment
that prevents the Air Force from retiring the fleet.
Since 2012, the President has been trying to retire this fleet despite its proven record and support amongst our troops, including Army Chief of Staff, General Ordinero, who described it as the best close air support. For the past 13 years, the A-10 has
been the champion and workhorse aircraft in Iraq and Afghanistan.
It might be old, but its effective, and there currently isnt another aircraft that can take its place.
If our combat troops on the ground say that they believe in the A-10, and that its the best when it comes to close air support, we should listen, and we did.
Last nights overwhelming support in the House is testament to the
fleets proven success of protecting our troops on the ground, and I will continue to fight to keep the fleet operational until there is a suitable replacement that our troops can trust to protect them in combat.
Background:
In 2012, Rep. Miller successfully defeated the Administrations attempt to eliminate and/or reduce the Air National Guard personnel and assets, including the A-10 Thunderbolt aircraft, based at Selfridge Air National Guard Base.
As a result of her efforts,
the National Defense Authorization Acts of 2013 and 2014 preserved Air Guard resources until an analysis could be conducted on the Air Force and its current and future structure with respect to its mission.
The
detailed report , completed earlier this year by the National Commission on the Structure of the Air Force, included recommendations to the President, the Department of Defense and Congress to evaluate and improve the
overall structure of the Air Force.
Specifically of note, the Commission recommended that the Air Force place greater reliance on the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve to lower overall military personnel costs and produce a more ready and capable force.
Despite this recommendation, the Administration is once again seeking to undermine one of our most capable, cost-effective resources by eliminating the entire A-10 fleet used by the Air Guard without identifying a replacement.
On May 22, 2014, the House passed
the FY15 National Defense Authorization Act which would protect the A-10 fleet through 2015.
Undermining the Houses defense authorization, the Houses Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2015 originally excluded funding for the A-10 fleet in FY15. To prevent the appropriations bill from forcing the divestment of the A-10s, Rep. Miller offered
