In November of last year, I asked if you believe the ban should be lifted on Libyans seeking to work in the U.S. in aviation and nuclear fields. Since
93%
of you answered no, I wanted to share the latest information with you.
In November of 2013, the House Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform Committees
raised concerns
about the administrations plan to lift a longstanding prohibition on Libyans coming to the U.S. to attend flight school, to work in aviation maintenance or flight operations, or to study or seek training in nuclear science. Since that time, the Department of Homeland Security has failed to respond and has instead moved forward with this proposed policy without disclosing information about it to Congress.
Today, the House Judiciary Committees Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committees Subcommittee on National Security will convene a joint hearing in order to obtain critical information regarding this policy change.
You can watch the hearing, entitled Overturning 30 Years of Precedent: Is the Administration Ignoring the Dangers of Training Libyan Pilots and Nuclear Scientists?
here .
I am committed to working with my colleagues to ensure that the national security of the United States is protected.
Yours in service,
Randy
