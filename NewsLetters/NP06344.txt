Dear Friend,
This past week we
somberly remembered those lost on one of the worst days in our nations
history, while at the same time honoring the first responders and our
service men and women who put their lives on the line every
day.
On September 10th, President Obama announced his plans to fight a
new, growing terrorist threat. I think the strategy laid out by the
President may weaken our enemy, but isnt enough to defeat it.
