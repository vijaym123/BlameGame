Dear Friend,
It is estimated that 17,000 people may be trafficked into the United States every year, and in recent years, we've seen a number of victims right here in the Hudson Valley.
We cannot sit by while the disgusting practice of modern day slavery is happening in our own backyard. To help stop human trafficking in its tracks, I recently hosted a Human Trafficking Resources Forum to bring together the federal, state and local resources to make sure law enforcement have the tools they need to combat human trafficking in our community.
Senator Larkin and local law enforcement joined our Human Trafficking Resources Forum.
It is critical that we continue working with our local community organizations and local law enforcement to end
human trafficking. We can also stop human trafficking before it begins by training Foreign Service Officers to spot victims of human trafficking before they enter the United States. In July, the House of Representatives passed my legislation, the
Human Trafficking Prevention Act which improves the training of Foreign Service Officers so that they can more easily determine if someone entering the United States is a victim of human trafficking.

As you Representative, I remain committed to making the Hudson Valley safe for all of its residents. If I can ever be of assistance please
contact my office .
Sincerely,
Sean Patrick Maloney
