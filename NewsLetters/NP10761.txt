Rep. Miller Votes for Budget that
Prioritizes U.S. National Security
Miller says Ryan Budget not only prioritizes national security, but also spurs economic growth and preserves Medicare and Medicaid for future generations
WASHINGTON &#8211; U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10) issued the following statement after voting for the budget plan, the Path to Prosperity, introduced by House Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (WI-1):
&#8220;Last month, the President presented a budget proposal that continues the federal spending spree, adds trillions of dollars to our national debt, and never balances.
Worse yet, it would also hollow out our military and greatly reduce our national defense
capabilities by shrinking the size of the military to pre-World War II levels.
And he doesn&#8217;t even propose these cuts to pay down our massive debt, but instead uses these cuts to the military to fund even more new government spending.
That is the last thing
we need, and the House agreed by rejecting the President&#8217;s budget by a vote of 2-413.
&#8220;I believe the first and foremost responsibility of our federal government is to provide for the common defense, in fact that is in the preamble of our Constitution.
And as Vice Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, I am aware of the threats
our nation faces and consider the President&#8217;s proposed military cuts dangerous to national security.
&#8220;Today, I voted for another path forward.
I voted for the Path to Prosperity, a budget proposal and blueprint that prioritizes national defense, spurs economic growth and makes common sense reforms to important programs like Medicaid and Medicare so they
are available for future generations.
The House Budget balances the federal books within the 10-year budget window by spending $5.1 trillion less over the next ten years than the President&#8217;s budget simply by slowing the rate of growth in federal spending.
Our budget also would put our nation on a path to pay off our national debt over time, which will help provide a greater opportunity for success for our children and grandchildren.
It&#8217;s a good dose of common sense which is desperately needed in Washington.
&#8220;Most importantly, the budget I voted for today strengthens this country&#8217;s ability to protect itself in a dangerous world by providing our military with the equipment, training and compensation they need to keep Americans safe at home and abroad.&#8221;
