This week I chaired the Homeland Security Committee, Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Security Technologies hearing regarding electromagnetic pulse (EMP) threats to critical infrastructure.
The hearing focused on the threats that nation-states, terrorists, and criminal organizations could pose to the American electricity grid. The hearing also examined the persistent threat that solar flares pose to the grid. Combating these threats and hardening Americas energy infrastructure will require a coordinated effort among multiple partners in the public and private sectors.

The hearing was a critical first step in raising public awareness about the underreported threat that Electromagnetic Pulse poses to our homeland security. Its important that we present accurate, objective information to the American people.
