, which would place restrictions and transparency measures on the Department of Defense (DOD) Program that transfers surplus military equipment to state and local law enforcement agencies.
Americans saw firsthand what militarization of our police departments looks and feels like last month during protests in Ferguson, Missouri, but I've been calling for a review of this program since March . Now is the time to act.
The program currently lacks meaningful oversight and accountability, and that's exactly what my bill would do . We need an honest debate on the type of surplus military-grade weaponry that is appropriate for transfer from war zones to our Main streets. For more, read about it in On Common Ground News .

HISTORIC CHURCH: Another bipartisan bill I introduced recently - authorizing the Department of Interior to determine whether the historic West Hunter Street Baptist Church in Atlanta
meets the criteria for designation in the National Park System - passed the House of Representatives on Sept. 15.
The West Hunter Street Baptist Church Study Act, proposed by me and my colleague Rep. Austin Scott (GA-08), was signed by 77 members of Congress from both sides of the aisle. The bill now goes to the Senate for a vote. If it passes the Senate, it goes to President Obama's desk for his signature.
HEALTH CARE GRANTS: I announced this week that the Department of Health & Human Services is awarding $3.3 million in grants for health care navigators in Georgia and more than $460,000 for two local community health care centers.
The Rockdale County Treatment Court Collaborative also will receive more than $234,000 in Mental Health & Substance Abuse Service Grants.
The funds will help Georgians sign up for health care through the Marketplace Exchanges under the Affordable Care Act, and assist community health centers that provide coverage for underinsured and uninsured constituents. For more, click HERE .

CONSTITUTION DAY: I want to thank my staffers - Outreach Director Mr. Eric Hubbard and Congressional Liaison Shy Armstrong - for celebrating Constitution Day with teachers, principals and students at Shiloh High School in Gwinnett County Newton County High School; Rockdale County High School and MLK Jr. High School in DeKalb County. Eric and Shy presented flags that flew over the Capitol Dome in Washington, D.C. to each school and Constitutions to all government and U.S. history students.

Dear
F riends,
I&#8217;m pleased to report that the bill I co-authored this month to de-militarize the police is receiving bipartisan support.
[if gte vml 1]>
<![endif] On
Sept. 16, Rep. Raul Labrador (R) (ID-01) and I introduced the bipartisan
Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act of 2014 (H.R. 5478) , which would place restrictions and transparency measures on the Department of Defense (DOD) Program that transfers surplus military equipment to state and local law enforcement agencies.
Americans saw firsthand what militarization of our police departments looks and feels like last month during protests in Ferguson, Missouri, but I&#8217;ve
been calling for a review of this program since March . Now is the time to act.
The program currently lacks meaningful oversight and accountability, and that&#8217;s
exactly what my bill would do . We need an honest debate on the type of surplus military-grade weaponry that is appropriate for transfer from war zones to our Main streets. For more, read about it in
On Common Ground News .
HISTORIC CHURCH:
Another bipartisan bill I introduced recently &#8211; authorizing the Department of Interior to determine whether the
