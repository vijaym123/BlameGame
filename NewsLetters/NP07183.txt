The
Scalise Capitol Report
August 11, 2014
Call the Senate back from their recess
More than a week ago, the House passed a bipartisan bill
to solve the border crisis.
Louisiana House Republicans recently sent this letter to Senate Majority
Leader Harry Reid
calling on him
and the Senate to come back from their recess, do their job, and take up
the House-passed border security bill to solve this
crisis. As thousands more unaccompanied minors flood across our border,
the Obama Administration and the Senate continue to ignore this
crisis. The House took the lead and did our job by passing a bill to solve
this crisis at the border. Its time for the Senate to step up and do
the same.

Fighting
proposed cuts to Medicare Advantage
The Obama Administration's deep cuts to Medicare Advantage
threaten the more than 200,000 Louisiana seniors who have paid into and rely
on this program to provide them high quality, affordable health
care. Last week I met with some Louisiana seniors at the STAR
Fitness Center in Covington and listened to their experiences with
Medicare Advantage and heard their deep concerns about these cuts. I will
continue to fight the Administrations efforts to eliminate Medicare
Advantage and advocate for the preservation and expansion of this
successful part of the Medicare program.
Hosting Service Academy Day
America's military service academies offer a unique opportunity for
young leaders who are interested in pursuing a post-secondary
education while also serving our nation at the same time. Last week, I
co-hosted a Service Academy Day with Senator David Vitter and Congressman
Cedric Richmond to bring together high school students and
representatives from those service academies. More than 60 attendees joined us at
Federal City to learn about the process to gain admission into our
nation's service academies. Thanks to all of those who came!
It is an honor to represent you in Congress. For
