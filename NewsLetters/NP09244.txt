Forbes: Chinas Behavior in South China Sea Shows Necessity of Strong U.S. Presence in the Asia-Pacific
Washington, D.C.
-
Congressman J. Randy Forbes (VA-04), Chairman of the House Armed Services Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee and Chairman of the Congressional China Caucus, released the following statement on the reported sinking of a Vietnamese civilian vessel in the South China Sea:
Chinas continued escalation of its maritime dispute with Vietnam, including actions that have led to the sinking of a Vietnamese fishing vessel in recent days, has only reinforced the perception that Beijing is willing to resort to military coercion to achieve its political objectives. From Tokyo to Manila to Hanoi, Chinas neighbors are looking for a clear signal that the United States is determined to maintain the existing regional status quo where freedom of navigation is respected, disputes are managed peacefully, and the military balance continues to favor the United States and its allies. The United States should never accept the resolution of territorial disputes in the Asia-Pacific by military force or other forms of coercion.
