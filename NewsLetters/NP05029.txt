Friends,
Being back in Northeast Ohio and
having the opportunity to visit with you has been a welcome change from
the day-to-day power struggles of Washington. But with October coming to
a close, I can't help but think about the work ahead of us when
Congress recovenes in November.
Many
of you know I went to Washington to fight for Northeast Ohio workers
and families. When I arrived in D.C., Washington hadnt produced a
budget in four years. Theres still much more to do, but we finally forced
Washington to sit down and put together a budget that reduced
discretionary spending by $165 billion -- and Im proud to have been part of
that solution as a member of the House Appropriations
Committee.
That was just the start. There are
still countless areas of the federal government that need a strong dose of
common sense. Consider these examples:
The
average government processing time for an interstate natural gas pipeline
is
558 days . These unnecessary delays continue to
slow our nation's march toward energy
independence.
Before Congress passed a water resources reform bill
earlier this year, it could take
10 to 15 years
for
the Corps of Engineers just to complete a project feasibility
study.
As of August 2014, people requesting
hearings to review Social Security Administration decisions on benefits
elligibility faced an average wait time of
7 to 22
months .
Nearly half of the Social Security
Administration's scheduled continuing disability reviews for children
with mental impairments are overdue, and an estimated
205,000 of those reviews
are overdue by more than 3
years.
These are only a few of the many, many places our
government is not being accountable to those it is supposed to serve. It's
time to put a stop to inefficiency and incompetence in government in
order to restore the people's trust and do what's best for our
nation.
I remain committed to doing all I can to make our government
functional, bringing stability and greater opportunity to Northeast
Ohio.
Below I've included photos from a few of my recent
travels around the district. Thank you for the honor of serving
you.
