Dear Friend,
Last week when the House did not have votes in Washington, I had the opportunity to visit individuals, organizations, and businesses all over our part of Texas. Staying in touch with the people for whom I work is one of the most important parts of my job, and I am always grateful for those who take the time to share their views and concerns.
In Amarillo, I had the privilege of visiting a free clinic for those in our community who have no insurance or other ways of receiving health care. Heal the City is a place where do unto others is
Mac &amp; Sally with Heal the City Volunteers
put into practice in a way that affirms the dignity of each individual. Its founder, Dr. Alan Keister, the selfless volunteers who work there, and the generous community supporters who make Heal the City possible provide inspiration to all of us to make a difference in someones life wherever we can.
I also had a chance to tour several businesses in Amarillo and Wichita Falls including Yellowhouse Machinery Co., Reed Beverages, and Wichita Beer. The families that started these companies and the employees that make them great are a testament to the fact that successful businesses are a product of hardworking people and an economic environment that allows hard work and innovation to be rewarded. Our national economy would be healthier and more people would have jobs if the federal government's approach to business was more like ours in Texas.
Sally and I were honored to be with the Iwo Jima Survivors Association of Texas in Wichita Falls as they recognized the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Iwo Jima. We were privileged to be in the company of about 30 survivors of the battle, including Medal of Honor Recipient Cpl. Herschel "Woody" Williams. It was the Associations 24th and final meeting, but the memory of all the sacrifices those men and others like them made will live on for many generations.
Below are some links to local news coverage about my visits.
