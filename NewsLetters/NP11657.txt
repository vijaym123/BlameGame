Dear Friend:
This week, the Senate filibustered the Military Justice Improvement Act, legislation I introduced with Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Susan Collins (R-ME) that would help address the epidemic of sexual assault in the military.
A bipartisan majority of 55 Senators supported our bill, which would remove decisions about prosecuting sexual assault cases from the chain of command and put them in the hands of professional, trained military prosecutors.
But we came up five votes short of defeating a filibuster by opponents of our bill.
I was so proud to stand with Senator Gillibrand, so many other colleagues and with all the survivors of military sexual assault who fought so hard for this legislation. To see video of our remarks right after the vote, please click

I have been here long enough to know that sometimes change is painful and slow, but it happens. We will not stop fighting until these survivors get the justice they deserve.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
