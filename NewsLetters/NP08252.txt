Dear Friend,
The end of the FEC fundraising quarter is tomorrow, and we&rsquo;re working toward a $36,000 goal to keep Ed&rsquo;s campaign on track for victory.
You can get us $5 closer by clicking below.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
But today, I&rsquo;m hoping to take some time to explain where your donations go. Campaigns are odd creatures -- they&rsquo;re sort of like a start-up, but most start-ups aren&rsquo;t founded with a definitive end date in mind.
And like a start-up (or any business, or any household), our campaign takes in money and then spends it on useful things. Things like phone banks to identify supporters and remind them to vote. Or direct mail that explains what Ed&rsquo;s doing for the people of Massachusetts.
We need clipboards, pens and supplies for our door knockers. The coffee, donuts, and pizza for the volunteers who give their time at Ed&rsquo;s events. And all of it costs money. Hitting our $36,000 goal before tomorrow&rsquo;s deadline will give our campaign the resources it needs to succeed. Give $5, $10, or whatever you can to keep us going.
This campaign is about people like you, and it&rsquo;s fueled by people like you. On Ed&rsquo;s behalf, I want to say thank you for never letting him down.
Sincerely,
David
