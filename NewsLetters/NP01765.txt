Friend,
We just had the best first quarter for our campaign to date -- and it&#39;s because I have the greatest team of supporters in the country.
It&#39;s all thanks to you.
First, we had generous donors agree to match every contribution dollar-for-dollar, and then, you stepped up to the plate and donated over $15,000.
That means, in less than one week, we were able to raise over $30,000 .
Amazing.
We are off to a great start, and I am grateful for your help.
Be well,
Ami
