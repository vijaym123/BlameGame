A Message from Representative Sean Duffy
December 15, 2013
During this season of family gatherings and gift giving, it is
sometimes easy to forget about the people in our own community who do
not have a home to gather in, or the means to prepare a holiday meal.
Often when we think of hunger and homelessness we imagine urban, high
population centers like Madison or Milwaukee, but it is a very
prevalent problem in rural communities across America and the 7th
Congressional District is no exception.
According to the Wisconsin Food Security Project, 13.5% of all
households in the 7th CD experienced food hardships, meaning they did
not have enough money to buy the food they needed at times during the
past year. Additionally, over 2,000 individuals received documented
care from shelters. Most concerning, these numbers have been trending
upward in Wisconsin in recent years despite a decline nationally.
The increase in families suffering from hunger and homelessness
requires us to no longer simply manage the problem, but to solve the
problem. This shift to what has been termed the "New Approach" has
produced results elsewhere and is catching on nation-wide. We see it
here in our own backyard through the tireless work and dedication from
organizations like the Marathon County Housing & Homelessness Coalition
and the Marathon County Hunger Coalition.
In addition to bringing more partners to the table through coalition
building, this "New Approach" also advances a more systemic strategy
with individuals and organizations - both public and private - working
in a coordinated manner.
Not only is this "New Approach" more efficient and a big step forward
from the previous practice of serving people somewhat haphazardly
through a collection of disconnected programs, the numbers also show it
is working.
Recent data show that the number of chronically homeless declined by
30% between 2005 and 2007 and has declined an additional 13% since.
Overall, homelessness declined nation-wide by 9.2% between 2007 and
2013.
This "New Approach," also termed "housing-first," efficiently reduces
homelessness and improves the lives of no-longer-homeless individuals
and families and the quality of our communities. Furthermore, it often
brings net savings to taxpayers since preventing homelessness is less
expensive than the cycle of emergency services that can be the daily
existence of homeless individuals and families.
Before communities can fully engage in this "New Approach," however,
its members need to fully understand the extent of the suffering, its
root causes, and develop empathy for the individuals and families
suffering from hunger and homelessness.
This Wednesday, December 18, leaders from communities across the 7th CD
are gathering in Wausau to learn about hunger and homelessness and its
impacts on our communities, what different communities and coalitions
are doing to address these problems, and to brainstorm and share ideas
on how we can continue to work to solve these problems.
We look forward to the summit, the various presentations, and the
discussions on Wednesday.

Programs and Policy at the National Alliance to End Homelessness. It

A
Message
from
Representative
Sean
Duffy
December 15, 2013
During
this
season
of
family
gatherings
and
gift
giving,
it
is
sometimes
easy
to
forget
about
the
people
in
our
own
community
who
do
not
have
a
home
to
gather
in,
or
the
means
to
prepare
a
holiday
meal.
Often
when
we
think
of
hunger
and
homelessness
we
imagine
urban,
high
population
centers
like
Madison
or
Milwaukee,
but
it
is
a
very
prevalent
problem
in
rural
communities
across
America
and
the
7th
Congressional
District
is
no
exception.
According
to
the
Wisconsin
Food
Security
Project,
13.5%
of
all
households
in
the
7 th
CD
experienced
food
hardships,
meaning
they
did
not
have
enough
money
to
buy
the
food
they
needed
at
times
during
the
past
year.
Additionally,
over
2,000
individuals
received
documented
care
from
shelters.
Most
concerning,
these
numbers
have
been
trending
upward
in
Wisconsin
in
recent
years
despite
a
decline
nationally.
The
increase
in
families
suffering
from
hunger
and
homelessness
requires
us
to
no
longer
simply
manage
the
problem,
but
to
solve
the
problem.
This
shift
to
what
has
been
termed
the
&#8220;New
Approach&#8221;
has
produced
results
elsewhere
and
is
catching
on
nation-wide.
We
see
it
here
in
our
own
backyard
through
the
tireless
work
and
dedication
from
organizations
like
the
Marathon
County
Housing
&amp;
Homelessness
Coalition
and
the
Marathon
County
Hunger
Coalition.
In
addition
to
bringing
more
partners
to
the
table
through
coalition
building,
this
&#8220;New
Approach&#8221;
also
advances
a
more
systemic
strategy
with
individuals
and
organizations
&#8211;
both
public
and
private
&#8211;
working
in
a
coordinated
manner.
Not
only
is
this
&#8220;New
Approach&#8221;
more
efficient
and
a
big
step
forward
from
the
previous
practice
of
serving
people
somewhat
haphazardly
through
a
collection
of
disconnected
programs,
the
numbers
also
show
it
is
working.
Recent
data
show
that
the
number
of
chronically
homeless
declined
by
30%
between
2005
and
2007
and
has
declined
an
additional
13%
since.
Overall,
homelessness
declined
nation-wide
by
9.2%
between
2007
and
2013.
This
&#8220;New
Approach,&#8221;
also
termed
&#8220;housing-first,&#8221;
efficiently
reduces
homelessness
and
improves
the
lives
of
no-longer-homeless
individuals
and
families
and
the
quality
of
our
communities.
Furthermore,
it
often
brings
net
savings
to
taxpayers
since
preventing
homelessness
is
less
expensive
than
the
cycle
of
emergency

that
can

of

Before
