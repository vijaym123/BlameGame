Sorry to fill up your inbox, David, but I just couldn&rsquo;t wait to break the news: As of 10am, we&rsquo;re zeroing in on
7,5OO
online donations for our Illinois campaign in 2014 --
only 272 left to go! That&rsquo;s our best online showing
EVER!!!
If we hit 7,5OO by tonight&rsquo;s July fundraising deadline, it&rsquo;ll be a
HUGE
victory
for us and a
MAJOR
setback
for our opponent, Tea Partier Bobby Schilling. So I&rsquo;m asking: David, can you chip in before midnight?
David Johnson Deadline: MIDNIGHT
Your Donation: $5.OO
