Dear Friends,
On
Wednesday, I met with two officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention to discuss the chemical spill and water safety: Dr.
Tanja Popovic, director of the National Center for Environmental
Health/Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, and Edward Hunter,
director of the CDCs Washington office.
I spoke with Dr.
Popovic and Director Hunter about a number of topics of concern to West
Virginians, including testing, long-term effects, and the consumption
of tap water by pregnant women. The CDC has been involved in responding
to the spill since day one, and I will continue to remain in constant
communication with the CDC, FEMA and other federal agencies to share
concerns and stories of West Virginians struggling to recover from the
water contamination.
I look forward to seeing the results
of the study of health effects from the chemical spill, and I hope
this study will be released soon.
SERVING OUR
NATION
Navy
Lieutenant Jonathan Wachtel of Martinsburg has been serving in the
House of Representative's Office of Legislative Affairs as a Navy liason
officer for three years and is leaving for a post in Rhode Island. I
nominated Jonathan for the U.S. Naval Academy when he was a student at
Martinsburg High School, and he has served on my academy nominations
board for the past few years. Jonathan has represented West Virginia
proudly as a member of the Navy, and I wish him well in his new
post.

Sandra.
REINING IN THE
IRS
I voted yes Wednesday on H.R. 3865, Stop Targeting of
Political Beliefs by the IRS Act of 2014. This important legislation would
prohibit the U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue service
from finalizing their proposed 501(c)(4) regulations for one
year.
In November 2013, they issued proposed rules that would
jeopardize 501(c)(4) organizations tax-exempt status based on their
non-partisan get-out-the-vote efforts, voter registration drives, and
candidate forums, which would now be considered political
activities.
The House voted 243-176 to pass the bill and prohibit the
Treasury and IRS from finalizing these harmful new regulations for one
year.
PIERPONT COMMUNITY
COLLEGE
Paul Schreffler, vice
president of workforce development at Pierpont Community &amp; Technical
College, visited me in Washington Friday to tell me about the college's
latest efforts to help West Virginians find good-paying jobs. I'm
proud of their efforts in training workers for the region's oil and gas
industry and providing for the region's next generation of qualified
employees.
Thank you for
reading my
weekly
e-newsletter, and as always, you can join
in the conversation on
