The freedom to peacefully live out our faith is not just part of our heritage as Americans, but a linchpin of our humanity.
In the face of the atrocities being committed against Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East, it is perhaps more crucial than ever that we refuse to sit idly by in silence. We must stand. We must act. Thats why I cosponsored
a bipartisan bill
to improve U.S. efforts to protect religious freedom by better training and equipping diplomats to counter extremism, address persecution, mitigate conflict, and assist the Ambassador at Large for Religious Freedom to coordinate efforts globally. This bill also reauthorizes the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, which passed the House unanimously last year but stalled in the Senate.
This bill requires a training program to be developed for mandatory religious freedom training for all Foreign Service Officers. It states that it should be U.S. policy that violent non-state actors should be eligible for designation as countries of particular concern, and authorizes the President to take specific actions against foreign persons responsible for committing systemic violations of religious freedom or supporting terrorist acts targeting members of religious groups.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. I also joined with my colleagues in the House and Senate in a
bipartisan letter
to President Obama, affirming Congress grave concern with ongoing persecution of religious minorities in Iraq and Syria, and urging the swift appointment of a Special Envoy.
