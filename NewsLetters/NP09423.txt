Dear Friends,
As we gather this weekend to celebrate Memorial Day with our friends
and family, please take a moment to remember the men and women who gave
the ultimate sacrifice so that we may have freedom.
America is a
stronger country because of our armed service members. The 21st
Congressional District is home to many veterans, current members of the
military and their families. The debt we owe them can never fully be
repaid.
Arlington National Cemetery, our Nation's
most hallowed ground, in Arlington, VA.
Memorial Day is a testament of our country's commitment to our service
members, past and present, who risked all to defend our nation's
freedoms. We will never forget the men and women who bravely gave their
lives for our country. A simple thank you never seems enough to fully
express the extent of our gratitude, but nonetheless, thank you for
allowing our country to be the land of the free and the home of the
brave.
As the weekend approaches and Americans all over the world prepare to
celebrate Memorial Day, I'd like to give a
special thanks to the many men and women of the 21st District of Texas
who have selflessly served our nation. Your service and sacrifice have
helped keep our nation safe and our citizens secure. And for that we
are eternally grateful.
For more information on my work to support our veterans and troops or
to send me a message, feel free to visit the 21st District's website,

.
Have a happy and safe Memorial Day weekend!
Sincerely,
Lamar Smith
