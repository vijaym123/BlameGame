President Obama is taking bold action to begin fixing our broken immigration system!!!
Executive action to shield 5 million undocumented immigrants from deportation
Politico is calling the President&rsquo;s actions &ldquo;the most sweeping changes to immigration policy in decades.&rdquo; Now, 5 million immigrants will be able to come forward and live in freedom and dignity -- all while supporting their families and contributing to the U.S. economy. But today, John Boehner announced he&rsquo;ll do everything in his power to block President Obama&rsquo;s immigration plan.
And Boehner&rsquo;s Republican colleagues in Congress are threatening President Obama with a government shutdown, lawsuits... even impeachment!
The Republicans' threats may be extremely disgusting -- but they&rsquo;re also extremely real. Now is the time to stand with President Obama on immigration reform. Will you add your voice?
