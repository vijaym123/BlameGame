Friends,
We are holding a Seventh District
Telephone
Town Hall Meeting this Tuesday at 5:30 PM ET
and would love
for you to participate if you are available.
During the
call, I will provide an update on recently passed legislation,
preview bills I plan to introduce, and take questions from callers.
Telephone Town Halls are interactive and allow for our entire district
to connect via phone and discuss issues impacting our community, state,
and country.
Again, the event is this Tuesday from
5:30pm-6:30pm.

A Seat at the Table
In 2010, President
Obama overhauled our countrys financial system by enacting the
Dodd-Frank Act.
This law established the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau (CFPB) to oversee the implementation of the law and
monitor markets for consumer financial products and services.
For too long, small businesses have lacked representation on the CFPB
Advisory Board, and with Dodd-Frank reforms impeding small business
growth and stifling community bank lending, their absence has been
evident.
Last week, I joined my colleagues in passing
legislation that would require the CFPB Director to appoint small business
representatives to two advisory committees: the Credit Union Advisory
Council and the Community Bank Advisory Council.
These boards
monitor regulations that directly impact small businesses ability to grow
and hire.
By having a seat at the table, small business owners
can advocate for changes to regulations and share their first-hand
stories about how Dodd-Frank regulations are impacting Main
Street.
Preventing Cybersecurity Attacks
Last year, Home Depot and Target were victims of massive cybersecurity
breaches, putting financial information for millions of customers at
risk.
The recent Sony Pictures security breach cost the company
millions of dollars in ticket sales and production costs.
Imagine
if a cybersecurity breach of this scale occurred within the federal
governments cyber network.
This would be detrimental to our
safety and could easily crumble a large citys
infrastructure.
Currently, the federal government and private companies take
precautions to stop or thwart cyber-threats but do not share information
out of fear of legal issues.
If sharing data would help keep
Americans information safe, the two should coordinate to prevent attacks
but only if consumers personal, private information is kept safe and
secure.
The U.S. House of Representative passed two bills this
week that would make it easier for private companies to share
information about cybersecurity threats with the federal government with
safeguards to protect Americans privacy.
SC
Truckers Visit DC
Last week, I met with South Carolina
members of the American Trucking Association to discuss the upcoming
highway bill, trucking regulations, and transportation funding.
After our meeting we toured the Capitol together.
Here are some
pictures from our visit:
VA Expands Choice Card Eligibility
Earlier this month, I was glad to report to you that
VA Secretary McDonald said he would direct the VA to change the
Choice Card 40-mile eligibility rule so that driving distance is measured
by actual driving distance, not straight-line.
This seems like
common-sense right? On Friday, the VA officially implemented this rule
change, make it effective immediately.
I will keep working to
encourage more common-sense solutions and changes within the
VA.
Letters are being sent to the newly eligible veterans to let them
know they are now eligible for the veterans Choice Program under this
expansion.
If a veteran does not remember receiving a Veterans
Choice Card or has other questions about the Choice Program, please call
(866) 606-8198 or visit
www.va.gov/opa/choiceact/factsheets_and_details.asp.
It is an honor and privilege to serve
you and your family,
Have a good
week,
