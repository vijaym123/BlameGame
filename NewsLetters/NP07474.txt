Dear Friends,
I spoke on the House floor today about how Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s lawsuit against President Barack Obama is a waste of taxpayer money and has no legal standing.
With just one day before a five-week district work period, the Majority has decided to grant itself the authority to sue the president for essentially doing what they seem incapable of. The lawsuit focuses solely on a small part of the Affordable Care Act, one that Republicans themselves wanted to roll back.
It is absurd to think that the House of Representatives, as an institution, has been harmed by President Obama attempting in good faith to implement the ACA. I understand their feelings might be hurt, but acting out only gets them negative attention. And Americans agree this lawsuit is a waste of time.
The last time the Republicans sued the President it was over the implementation of the Defense of Marriage Act, which went nowhere and cost taxpayers $2.3 million. Like this previous fruitless lawsuit, this will bounce around the courts for years. Making rich lawyers richer &ndash; that&rsquo;s the only jobs program the Republicans will have passed this Congress.
Please take the time to watch the speech in its entirety

All the best,
