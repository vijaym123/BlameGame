The Hill Report
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of June 9 - 13, 2014
This week, the House passed legislation to ensure that our veterans
receive the quality of health care that they deserve. In light of
recent reports of the alleged mismanagement of the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA), the House has worked expeditiously to care for
our veterans and uncover the truth behind this appalling news.
I was proud to join my colleagues in the House in supporting the
Veterans Access to Care Act
. This bill would
give veterans the option of seeking private-sector health care if the
wait time that they face at the VA exceeds 30 days. This bill would
also ban bonuses for all VA employees and require the VA to submit
quarterly reports to Congress to increase transparency and require
accountability. I'm pleased to announce that this bill unanimously
passed the House.
Legislation Approved this week
On Tuesday, the House passed the Transportation, Housing and Urban
Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2015. This
legislation responsibly supports critical housing and transportation
programs while spending $7.8 billion below the President's budget
request and making strides to reduce our nation's deficit. I believe it
is essential to make sensible investments in our nation's highways,
bridges, and airports to meet the needs of the American people and
sustain a strong economy. To read more about THUD, click here

The House also passed
two important measures to provide our nation's
job creators with permanent tax relief. H.R. 4457, the Small Business
Tax Relief Act
, provides
companies with the flexibility to access capital in order to invest in
their businesses and create new jobs. H.R. 4453, the Permanent S
Corporation Built-in Gains Recognition Period
,
provides small
businesses with the fiscal certainty that they need to plan for the
future, expand their businesses, and hire new workers. I was proud to
support these common sense jobs bills to reduce the tax burden on our
nation's small businesses, which will spur investment, economic growth,
and job creation.
North Texas Invasive Species Barrier Act of 2014
I am very pleased to report that the North Texas Invasive Species
Barrier Act of 2014 was signed into law this week. I was an original
cosponsor of this bill, which ensures that more than 1.5 million
customers of the North Texas Municipal Water District will continue to
have access to an adequate supply of water in the future. It guarantees
that water transferred from Lake Texoma will reach North Texans
unrestricted while remaining in compliance with the Lacey Act by
continuing to prevent the spread of invasive species across state
lines. I am delighted this common sense piece of legislation was signed
into law and will ensure that millions of Texans will have a steady
stream of clean water for generations to come.
Texas Department of Transportation
On Tuesday, June 17th, the Texas Department of Transportation is
holding a public meeting to discuss the proposed implementation of the
I-635 Express/HOV lanes from US 75 to I-30 in Dallas, Garland, and
Mesquite. The proposed project would implement tolling of single
occupant vehicles on the existing express/HOV lanes from US 75 to I-30.
If you are interested in learning more about this project or offering
your feedback I hope that you will take part in this open forum.
