David -- I am astonished.
Last night, we achieved an incredible milestone. More than 15,000 grassroots supporters (like yourself!) chipped in and helped us raise $1.1 million for this quarter.
I am truly humbled by the outpouring of support! I can't thank you enough for believing in me, this campaign, and the values we're fighting for together.
With such incredible support, we're well on our way to building one of the strongest grassroots campaigns Illinois has ever seen. We couldn't do it without you.
Thanks again.
Onward to November,
Brad
