Dear
Friend,
To
retain and expand jobs in the modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) industry
in our region, I recently brought together leaders in Washington to
develop a blueprint for our 2014 work.
We were able to coordinate
simulation community and national leaders to help develop a plan to
ensure that the federal government continues to utilize cost-effective
and highly successful M&amp;S for training and
readiness.
After launching our successful Save Our Simulation (SOS) campaign early
last year, we secured inclusion of some of the strongest language
ever adopted by Congress in support of modeling and simulation (M&amp;S)
in the budget, appropriations and authorization
measures.
As I hosted M&amp;S leaders, including industry representatives from
Central Florida, the Florida Governors Office and Orange County
government, we developed a strategic plan for this year.
We were able
to achieve productive sessions with key Members of Congress, staff and
policy makers.
We continued to receive strong commitments during
this fly-in from federal decision makers to assist M&amp;S
initiatives locally and nationally.
Future advocacy trips are planned to
target other Congressional leaders and key decision makers to ensure
that the local M&amp;S jobs are not endangered and that we expand
opportunities in this cost-effective and highly successful
industry.
These high-paying M&amp;S jobs are a significant part of our
regional economy and have expanded from military applications to commercial
applications in industries including transportation, health care,
homeland security, entertainment and numerous other sectors.
A
blueprint for action was developed, which I will execute with our
Central Florida partners.
Later this month, I will lead a group of
regional community leaders in an advocacy campaign to support our
M&amp;S industry.
The Central Florida Partnership, which includes
local political and community leaders, will return to Washington, DC in
May to continue our efforts and target other key Florida Delegation
Members and the Committees of jurisdiction.
For more
information on this or other efforts to expand economic opportunity in Central
Florida, please visit our 7 th

regards and best wishes, I remain
John L. Mica
