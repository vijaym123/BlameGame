Last Friday, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio), along with Senator
Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), joined the Ohio State University President
Michael Drake and Senator John and Mrs. Annie Glenn at the official
ribbon cutting of the new John Glenn College of Public Affairs. The
John Glenn School of Public Affairs - with more than 550 students and
21 faculty - will be the 15th college at OSU.
"I've seen firsthand during my time as a teacher in the classroom at
the Glenn College the determination and resolve that students bring to
challenge themselves and to find solutions," said Portman. "That's what
public service is all about, and that's what the Glenn College is all
about. This milestone for the Glenn College will usher in a new
generation of public servants, and it will create leadership
opportunities for young people from across our country. I want to
congratulate John and Annie Glenn, and the fine faculty and
administrators for all their hard work in making the John Glenn College
of Public Affairs such a success."
Portman currently serves on the Board of Advisors at the College and
previously taught four courses at the Glenn School. In 2011, Portman
was awarded the John Glenn School of Public Affairs' Medal of
Leadership Award for demonstrating outstanding leadership in public
affairs by example, action, and accomplishments. In 2009, Portman
received the Glenn School's Excellence in Public Service Award.
Last Monday, Portman, along with other members of the Ohio delegation,
hosted the 2014 national championship football team
, The Ohio State University Buckeyes, at the U.S.
Capitol. Portman presented the team with a Senate Resolution
congratulating them on their championship.
"The Ohio State University has the best team in the land, and I was
pleased to have the opportunity to congratulate them on a hard-earned
championship season," Portman said.
The Resolution can be found here

Last Tuesday, Portman and Senator Jeanne Shaheen announced that their
Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015
passed the House and is now headed to the President for signature. This
bill, which passed
the Senate in March, contains
key energy efficiency provisions that will strengthen the economy and
reduce pollution.
"Our targeted energy efficiency bill has garnered widespread support
because of a simple fact - it is good for the economy and good for the
environment," said Portman. "This is an important part of our energy
plan for America that can help bring jobs back, help make our
manufacturers more competitive, and actually help to protect the
environment. I'm pleased that it is now headed to the President for
signature, and will continue to work for passage of my larger bill and
a national energy strategy that boosts American workers while
protecting the environment at the same time."
Text of the legislation can be found here
.
Portman and Shaheen introduced their larger energy efficiency bill
, the Energy Savings
and Industrial Competitiveness Act, earlier this year. It is scheduled
to receive a hearing in the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural
Resources on April 30th.
Also on Tuesday, Portman, co-chair of the Senate Caucus to End Human
Trafficking, spoke on the Senate floor
to address legislation to
combat human trafficking and strengthen protection for victims.

.
Last Wednesday, the Senate passed
Portman's bill to combat human
trafficking, the Bringing Missing Children Home Act, as well as key
provisions of his Combat Human Trafficking Act. Portman's amendment
called Ensuring a Better Response for Victims of Child Sex Trafficking
was also adopted unanimously. This amendment contained the remaining
provisions of the Child Sex Trafficking Data and Response Act that have
not been enacted into law.
"Human trafficking is a heinous crime, and I'm pleased that we are
finally moving forward on this legislation to end modern-day slavery,"
Portman stated. "My measures included in the bill will allow us to
improve the way we find missing children, strengthen the prosecution
against buyers of sex acts from trafficking victims, rightly define
victims of child sex trafficking as victims of child abuse and ensure
that children who are sex trafficked or sexually exploited are treated
as victims, not criminals.
"This legislation had been stalled for too long, and I'm pleased that
we're now closer to enacting these important measures to protect the
most vulnerable among us. I urge swift passage in the House so that
this critical legislation can be signed into law."
Video of Portman talking about his legislation can be found here
.
The Bringing Missing Children Home Act
is bipartisan legislation
Portman introduced with Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to improve the way
we find missing kids by refining and streamlining how cases of missing
children are handled and enhancing the critical information needed for
law enforcement to investigate cases of missing and abducted children.
Specifically, for the first time ever, law enforcement will be required
to add a photograph to the missing child's file if available. Portman's
bill also replaces the term "child prostitution" with "child sex
trafficking," reinforcing that children who are sex trafficked or
sexually exploited are victims, not criminals, and making it clear that
we must save these children from abuse.
The Combat Human Trafficking Act
is bipartisan legislation
Portman introduced with Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) to strengthen
law enforcement efforts to investigate and prosecute all who commit sex
trafficking crimes, particularly the buyers of sex acts from
trafficking victims. Enforcement efforts often focus on prosecuting the
sellers of these acts because of challenges in prosecuting buyers.
Portman's legislation sends a clear message to those who victimize
children that we will prosecute them to the full extent of the law. By
strengthening laws against buyers, we can take steps toward reducing
demand for child victims and ensuring criminals are fully prosecuted.
Ensuring a Better Response for Victims of Child Sex Trafficking was
originally part of the Child Sex Trafficking Data and Response Act
, bipartisan legislation
Portman introduced with Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) to amend the Child
Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) to require that child
victims of sex trafficking are considered victims of child abuse. Under
the amendment, CAPTA state plans must also contain provisions and
procedures requiring identification and assessment of all reports
involving children known or suspected to be victims of sex trafficking,
training for child protective services workers to identify and provide
comprehensive services victims and a
description of efforts to
coordinate with state law enforcement, juvenile justice, and social
service agencies such as runaway and homeless youth shelters to better
serve victims of sex trafficking.
These bills follow up on Portman's extensive efforts to combat human
trafficking. Last year, Portman's provisions
to protect children from violent
criminals were signed into law as part of the Child Care Development
Block Grant. Additionally, key provisions of Portman's Child Sex
Trafficking Data and Response Act
, which requires state
child welfare workers to identify and document victims of sex
trafficking within the child welfare system, were signed into law last
year. In December 2012, Portman's bill to strengthen protections
against trafficking in connection with overseas federal contracts, the
End Trafficking in Government Contracting Act
, was signed into law as part of
the National Defense Authorization Bill.
Also on Wednesday, Portman and Senator Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) announced the
introduction of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2015
, legislation that authorizes the Great Lakes Restoration
Initiative (GLRI), a results-driven program to address some of the most
serious issues that threaten the ecological and economic wellbeing of
the entire Great Lakes basin. Portman serves as vice-chair of the Great
Lakes Task Force.
"GLRI has been an incredibly successful tool for Lake Erie protection
and restoration efforts, and I'm pleased to introduce this legislation,"
Portman stated. "We must protect our Great Lakes not only for their
environmental well-being, but also for the economy of our region."
Last year, the GLRI received $300 million in the Omnibus Appropriations
bill for fiscal year 2015 to combat some of the biggest challenges the
Lakes are facing today, such as the threat of invasive species,
pollution and toxic contamination. Among its many achievements, the
environmental restoration work conducted through this program led to
the delisting of three formerly contaminated sites along the Great
Lakes, known as Areas of Concerns. Yet, despite this progress, 27 toxic
Areas of Concern remain across the Great Lakes Basin. The Kirk-Portman
bill authorizes the GLRI at $300 million annually from fiscal year
2016-fiscal year 2020 to ensure that continued federal resources are
made available to accelerate the restoration and protection of the
Great Lakes.
The Senate Finance Committee passed the Trade Adjustment Assistance
(TAA) legislation last Wednesday which includes an extension of the
Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC)
for Delphi retirees and
retired United Steelworkers.
"I strongly support TAA which helps struggling Ohio workers and
families," said Portman. "I am pleased that TAA will extend the health
care issue that we've talked about a lot in this committee, the HCTC
tax credit."
Portman has worked to extend the HCTC, a vital tool for many Americans
who have experienced job loss and receive TAA or have had their defined
benefit pension plans taken over by the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (PBGC), such as thousands of Delphi salaried retirees in
Ohio along with many retired United Steelworkers.
Portman's remarks can be found here
.
Portman also welcomed the passage
of his
amendment to customs bill to reform the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB)
process, which was backed by the National Association of Manufacturers,
Ohio Manufacturers Association and 185 companies and associations. This
amendment builds on Portman's efforts to create a level playing field
for America's manufacturers and guard against the return of
Congressional earmarks.
"American workers can go head-to-head with foreign competitors when
operating on a level playing field, but unfair tariffs put them at a
disadvantage," Portman stated. "These important reforms will streamline
and simplify a system few currently understand while providing a clear
pathway for the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill to be renewed to provide
needed aid to American manufacturers."
Last week, Portman introduced the American Manufacturing
Competitiveness Act, legislation to reform the MTB with Senators Claire
McCaskill (D-Mo.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.),
following up on a similar bill
he
introduced with McCaskill earlier this year.
Portman's amendment was
cosponsored by Senators Toomey, Casey, Burr and Carper.
Portman's amendment with Senator Brown to ensure steel companies can
more easily seek help from illegally undersold and subsidized imports
also passed the Finance Committee
on Wednesday.
This bipartisan measure was backed by American
steel manufacturers like AK Steel, US Steel, Nucor, ArcelorMittal along
with the United Steelworkers. Portman and Senator Ron Wyden (D-Oregon)
also welcomed inclusion of crucial legislation to crack down on customs
duty evasion schemes through the ENFORCE Act.
Portman also announced that his bipartisan amendment with Senator Ben
Cardin (D-Md.) to the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation aimed
at combatting the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)
movement successfully passed the Senate Finance Committee
.
Over the past several years, a growing contingency of countries have
sought to isolate and delegitimize Israel through BDS. This amendment
leverages ongoing trade negotiations to discourage prospective U.S.
trade partners from engaging in economic discrimination against Israel.
Video of Portman's remarks can be found here
.
"This amendment sends a clear message that if you want to be an
economic partner with the United States, you cannot support politically
motivated boycotts of Israel," said Portman. "I'm pleased that it was
successfully included in this legislation because it says the United
States will not stand with those who attempt to weaken Israel."
Portman also offered an amendment addressing currency manipulation
to the TPA legislation. Portman's bipartisan amendment,
co-sponsored by Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), puts teeth into
addressing currency manipulation by holding countries accountable to
International Monetary Fund standards. It would add explicit and
enforceable currency language necessary to ensure that foreign
competitors don't use their exchange rates to subsidize their exports
at the expense of products made by American workers.
Portman's
amendment was backed by American automakers like Ford and GM along with
American steel companies like Timken, AK Steel, Nucor and US Steel.
"We need a balanced approach on trade - fighting for good jobs through
more exports and fighting against unfair trade practices," said
Portman. "Unfortunately, some of our competitors tilt the playing-field
by manipulating their currencies, so that our American-made exports are
more expensive, while our competitors' exports into our country are
cheaper.
That's not fair for Ohio workers who can compete with anyone
on a level playing-field, and this amendment provides enforceable
measures to achieve that outcome. I will continue to fight to get it
included in TPA when it moves to the Senate floor."
Video of Portman's remarks can be found here
.
Portman has repeatedly called for currency issues to be addressed in
any trade negotiation. He signed a letter with 60 senators calling for
currency to be addressed in trade agreements
. He also has raised it repeatedly with Cabinet
officials, including in hearings in February with Secretary Lew
and Ambassador Froman. During each hearing he held up
letters from Ohio United Automobile Workers (UAW) at Ford plants.
Portman visited Ford plants in Sharonville and Brook Park
to discuss currency issues with UAW workers in 2013. Portman has
also repeatedly stood up for Ohio workers targeted by illegally
subsidized or undersold imports, ranging from pipe and tube products
(oil country tubular
goods), tires
(case
ongoing with United Steelworkers (USW)), light weight thermal paper
(West Carrollton),
uncoated paper
(with USW), and others.
Last Thursday, Portman highlighted the negative effects of the Medical
Device Tax
at a
Senate Finance Committee hearing. Portman, along with a bipartisan
group of Senators, introduced the Medical Device Access and Innovation
Protection Act
earlier this year. This bill will repeal the medical
device tax that was implemented as a part of Obamacare.
Under Obamacare, manufacturers of medical devices are required to pay a
2.3 percent excise tax on products ranging from surgical tools to bed
pans. The tax, which took effect in January 2013, is hurting
innovation, job creation, and the overall delivery of quality patient
care.
A study by the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed)
found that the tax impacted approximately 33,000 American jobs in its
first year, either through layoffs or forgone jobs that would have been
created.

On Social Media:
Sen. Portman bill heads to Obama for signature
A bill aimed at encouraging energy savings in new homes and older
commercial buildings won House approval Tuesday and heads to the White
House for President Barack Obama's signature.
The Senate approved the energy efficiency bill last month. The bill
would, among other things, provide incentives for owners of commercial
buildings and their tenants to reduce the energy they use. In a
statement, Portman said the bill gained broad support from both parties
"because of a simple fact - it is good for the economy and good for the
environment."
("Sen. Portman bill heads to Obama for signature," Jack Torry. Columbus
Dispatch
. April 22, 2015.)
Portman's energy bill clears Congress
Congress gave final approval this week to a scaled-back version of
energy efficiency legislation championed by Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio.
With President Obama expected to sign the bill into law in the coming
days, Portman said it was a major victory that would help the economy
and the environment.
"This is an important part of our energy plan . that can help bring
jobs back, help make our manufacturers more competitive, and actually
help to protect the environment," the Ohio senator said in a statement
after the House passed the bill on Tuesday. It cleared the Senate in
March.
Portman and Shaheen are still hoping to pass the bigger legislation,
which would encourage more energy-efficient elements in the
construction of new homes and commercial buildings, among other things.
But they trumpeted passage of the smaller measure as a key victory that
enjoyed broad bipartisan support.
("Portman's energy bill clears Congress," Deirdre Shesgreen. Cincinnati

Congress Passes Bipartisan Bill to Improve Energy Efficiency
Congress on Tuesday passed a bill focused on improving energy
efficiency in buildings and water heaters, a move celebrated by both
parties for breaking longstanding partisan gridlock.
The bill, which President Obama is expected to sign into law this week,
is a modest one. But its authors, Senator Rob Portman, Republican of
Ohio, and Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, who had
worked together for years on more ambitious energy-saving legislation,
called it a significant victory.
Mr. Portman said, "Our targeted energy efficiency bill has garnered
widespread support because of a simple fact: It is good for the economy
and good for the environment."
The two senators have been working together since 2011 on their broader
energy efficiency measure. That bill, which also has bipartisan
support, would create incentives for federal mortgage writers to
incorporate energy-efficient heating and cooling systems into the value
of a home, establish training programs in energy-efficiency
construction, create programs to increase the energy efficiency of
manufacturing supply chains, and direct the Energy Department to work
with manufacturers on energy-efficient technology.
This year, the senators introduced a bill that incorporated a few
elements of the broader measure. The narrower bill would create a
voluntary program for landlords and tenants to improve energy
efficiency in commercial buildings, mandate that large electric water
heaters be run in a highly energy-efficient manner and require federal
agencies to perform energy-use assessments on commercial buildings that
they lease.

Davenport. New York Times

Trade with U.S. should be balanced
Amid a contentious fight over the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade
agreement, Ohio Sens. Rob Portman and Sherrod Brown are pushing for a
legislative amendment to attack currency manipulation.
The trade agreement has sparked a fierce fight in Congress with action
shifting lately to the Senate which is debating giving President Obama
fast track authority to conclude the deal with the provision the treaty
be made public for a month before it can be finalized.
Portman's bipartisan amendment is proposed for attachment to Trade
Promotion Authority legislation, a power also known as Fast Track that's
granted the president by Congress to conclude the trade agreement. It
is also co-sponsored by Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat and
Sen. Charles Schumer, a Democrat of New York.
Portman, in a statement, said the amendment "puts teeth into addressing
currency manipulation by holding countries accountable to International
Monetary Fund standards."
He added that it includes "explicit and enforceable currency language
necessary to ensure that foreign competitors don't use their exchange
rates to subsidize their exports at the expense of products made by
American workers."
"We need a balanced approach on trade - fighting for good jobs through
more exports and fighting against unfair trade practices," Portman
said. "Unfortunately, some of our competitors tilt the playing-field by
manipulating their currencies, so that our American-made exports are
more expensive, while our competitors' exports into our country are
cheaper."
Endorsement also came in from steelmakers AK Steel, U.S. Steel,
TimkenSteel, and ArcelorMittal USA and domestic automobile
manufacturers.
"Unfair trade practices, including currency manipulation, have
contributed to overcapacity in the global steel industry and
record-setting import levels," Andy Harshaw, chief executive officer,
ArcelorMittal, said in a statement.
American Automotive Policy Council President, former governor Matt
Blunt added: "Currency manipulation is the most significant 21st
century trade barrier that American manufacturers face."

Senator Portman Meets with Cleveland Eastern European Communities
Portman recently hosted European ambassadors to the United States, a
Ukrainian parliamentary delegation led by Deputy Speaker of the
Ukrainian Parliament, Andriy Paurbiy, as well as U.S. Ambassador to
Ukraine Geoff Pyatt in the U.S. Capitol to discuss the U.S.-Ukraine
partnership.
On Friday, April 17, 2015 Senator Portman, co-chair of the Senate
Ukraine Caucus, met with members of Eastern European communities in
Cleveland to discuss his recent visit to Ukraine and Latvia.
"It was good to meet with Clevelanders who share my concerns regarding
the continued Russian aggression in Ukraine," Portman stated. "Many
Ohioans still have family in Ukraine, and I was pleased to have the
opportunity to report what I saw on the ground, as well as my
conversations with President Poroshenko. I will continue to push for
increased U.S. assistance to Ukraine and our other allies in the
region."
"It was good to hear firsthand about Senator Portman's trip to Ukraine
and Latvia," said Marta Liscynesky. "We appreciate his continued
efforts to support the Ukrainian people."

TimkenSteel shows off new caster
Customers and vendors had the chance Friday to see TimkenSteel Corp.'s
new jumbo bloom vertical caster.
The company opened the doors to the Faircrest Steel Mill to officially
commission the giant caster. TimkenSteel officials said the caster is
the largest of its kind in the world, and that the Faircrest mill is
the only plant that has a jumbo bloom vertical caster and an in-line
forge press.
The caster has been operating since late October. Steel made during the
first run was sold to a customer, a testament to the strength of the
new technology, as well as the skill and expertise of employees
operating the equipment, TimkenSteel officials said.
Since October the caster has been used more that 300 times and produced
more that 45,000 tons of steel blooms. The blooms later are rolled into
bars and tubes used in the industrial, energy, bearing, military and
heavy machinery markets.
Joining the celebration were U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Cincinnati, and
U.S. Reps Bob Gibbs, R-Lakeville, and Jim Renacci, R-Wadsworth. Gibbs
represents Ohio's 7th District, where Faircrest is located, and Renacci
has the 16th District, home to TimkenSteel headquarters and factories.
Timken said it is important for government and business to have a good
relationship. "Working together we make American manufacturing strong,"
he said.
Portman echoed the sentiments and said he plans to take steps next week
aimed at helping American businesses deal with foreign competitors that
dump products in U.S. markets. He plans to propose an amendment that
will make it easier for U.S. companies to show they have suffered
material injury because of dumping by a foreign competitor.
Portman said he also would like to see steps taken to help oil and
natural gas companies export their products. Shale oil drilling has
increased U.S. oil and gas production, making exports possible.
TimkenSteel is used in oil and gas drilling, Portman said. "We need to
make sure this caster is busy, that this caster has a lot of customers."
Portman said innovation helped make Faircrest the most efficient steel
mill in the world. "Washington isn't doing enough to support that kind
of innovation," he said.

now
closer
to
enacting
these
important
measures
to
protect
the
most
vulnerable
among
us.
I
urge
swift
passage
in
the
House
so
that
this
critical
legislation
can
be
signed
into
law.&#8221;
Video
of
Portman
talking
about
his
legislation
can
be
found
here .
The
Bringing
Missing
Children
Home
Act
is
bipartisan
legislation
Portman
introduced
with
Senator
Chuck
Schumer
(D-NY)
to
improve
the
way
we
find
missing
kids
by
refining
and
streamlining
how
cases
of
missing
children
are
handled
and
enhancing
the
critical
information
needed
for
law
enforcement
to
investigate
cases
of
missing
and
abducted
children.
Specifically,
for
the
first
time
ever,
law
enforcement
will
be
required
to
add
a
photograph
to
the
missing
child&#8217;s
file
if
available.
Portman&#8217;s
bill
also
replaces
the
term
&#8220;child
prostitution&#8221;
with
&#8220;child
sex
trafficking,&#8221;
reinforcing
that
children
who
are
sex
trafficked
or
sexually
exploited
are
victims,
not
criminals,
and
making
it
clear
that
we
must
save
these
children
from
abuse.
The
Combat
Human
Trafficking
Act
is
bipartisan
legislation
Portman
introduced
with
Senator
Dianne
Feinstein
(D-CA)
to
strengthen
law
enforcement
efforts
to
investigate
and
prosecute
all
who
commit
sex
trafficking
crimes,
particularly
the
buyers
of
sex
acts
from
trafficking
victims.
Enforcement
efforts
often
focus
on
prosecuting
the
sellers
of
these
acts
because
of
challenges
in
prosecuting
buyers.
Portman&#8217;s
legislation
sends
a
clear
message
to
those
who
victimize
children
that
we
will
prosecute
them
to
the
full
extent
of
the
law.
By
strengthening
laws
against
buyers,
we
can
take
steps
toward
reducing
demand
for
child
victims
and
ensuring
criminals
are
fully
prosecuted.
Ensuring
a
Better
Response
for
Victims
of
Child
Sex
Trafficking
was
originally
part
of
the
Child
Sex
Trafficking
Data
and
Response
Act ,
bipartisan
legislation
Portman
introduced
with
Senator
Ron
Wyden
(D-OR)
to
amend
the
Child
Abuse
Prevention
and
Treatment
Act
(CAPTA)
to
require
that
child
victims
of
sex
trafficking
are
considered
victims
of
child
abuse.
Under
the
amendment,
CAPTA
state
plans
must
also
contain
provisions
and
procedures
requiring
identification
and
assessment
of
all
reports
involving
children
known
or
suspected
to
be
victims
of
sex
trafficking,
training
for
child
protective
services
workers
to
identify
and
provide
comprehensive
services
victims
and
a
description
of
efforts
to
coordinate
with
state
law
enforcement,
juvenile
justice,
and
social
service
agencies
such
as
runaway
and
homeless
youth
shelters
to
better
serve
victims
of
sex
trafficking.
These
bills
follow
up
on
Portman&#8217;s
extensive
efforts
to
combat
human
trafficking.
Last
year,
Portman&#8217;s
provisions
to
protect
children
from
violent
criminals
were
signed
into
law
as
part
of
the
Child
Care
Development
Block
Grant.
Additionally,
key
provisions
of
Portman&#8217;s
Child
Sex
Trafficking
Data
and
Response
Act ,
which
requires
state
child
welfare
workers
to
identify
and
document
victims
of
sex
trafficking
within
the
child
welfare
system,
were
signed
into
law
last
year.
In
December
2012,
Portman&#8217;s
bill
to
strengthen
protections
against
trafficking
in
connection
with
overseas
federal
contracts,
the
End
Trafficking
in
Government
Contracting
Act ,
was
signed
into
law
as
part
of
the
National
Defense
Authorization
Bill.
Also
on
Wednesday,
Portman
and
Senator
Mark
Kirk
(R-Ill.)
announced
the
introduction
of
the
Great
Lakes
Restoration
Initiative
Act
of
2015 ,
legislation
that
authorizes
the
Great
Lakes
Restoration
Initiative
(GLRI),
a
results-driven
program
to
address
some
of
the
most
serious
issues
that
threaten
the
ecological
and
economic
wellbeing
of
the
entire
Great
Lakes
basin.
Portman
serves
as
vice-chair
of
the
Great
Lakes
Task
Force.
&#8220;GLRI
has
been
an
incredibly
successful
tool
for
Lake
Erie
protection
and
restoration
efforts,
and
I&#8217;m
pleased
to
introduce
this
legislation,&#8221;
Portman
stated.
&#8220;We
must
protect
our
Great
Lakes
not
only
for
their
environmental
well-being,
but
also
for
the
economy
of
our
region.&#8221;
Last
year,
the
GLRI
received
$300
million
in
the
Omnibus
Appropriations
bill
for
fiscal
year
2015
to
combat
some
of
the
biggest
challenges
the
Lakes
are
facing
today,
such
as
the
threat
of
invasive
species,
pollution
and
toxic
contamination.
Among
its
many
achievements,
the
environmental
restoration
work
conducted
through
this
program
led
to
the
delisting
of
three
formerly
contaminated
sites
along
the
Great
Lakes,
known
as
Areas
of
Concerns.
Yet,
despite
this
progress,
27
toxic
Areas
of
Concern
remain
across
the
Great
Lakes
Basin.
The
Kirk-Portman
bill
authorizes
the
GLRI
at
$300
million
annually
from
fiscal
year
2016-fiscal
year
2020
to
ensure
that
continued
federal
resources
are
made
available
to
accelerate
the
restoration
and
protection
of
the
Great
Lakes.
The
Senate
Finance
Committee
passed
the
Trade
Adjustment
Assistance
(TAA)
legislation last
Wednesday
which
includes
an
extension
of
the Health
Coverage
Tax
Credit
(HCTC)
for
Delphi
retirees
and
retired
United
Steelworkers.
&#8220;I
strongly
support
TAA
which
helps
struggling
Ohio
workers
and
families,&#8221;
said
Portman.
&#8220;I
am
pleased
that
TAA
will
extend
the
health
care
issue
that
we&#8217;ve
talked
about
a
lot
in
this
committee,
the
HCTC
tax
credit.&#8221;
Portman
has
worked
to
extend
the
HCTC,
a
vital
tool
for
many
Americans
who
have
experienced
job
loss
and
receive
TAA
or
have
had
their
defined
benefit
pension
plans
taken
over
by
the
Pension
Benefit
Guaranty
Corporation
(PBGC),
such
as
thousands
of
Delphi
salaried
retirees
in
Ohio
along
with
many
retired
United
Steelworkers.
Portman&#8217;s
remarks

Portman
also
welcomed
the
passage
of
his
amendment
to
customs
bill
to
reform
the
Miscellaneous
Tariff
Bill
(MTB)
process,
which
was
backed
by
the
National
Association
of
Manufacturers,
Ohio
Manufacturers
Association
and
185
companies
and
associations.
This
amendment
builds
on
Portman&#8217;s
efforts
to
create
a
level
playing
field
for
America&#8217;s
manufacturers
and
guard
against
the
return
of
Congressional
earmarks.
&#8220;American
workers
can
go
head-to-head
with
foreign
competitors
when
operating
on
a
level
playing
field,
but
unfair
tariffs
put
them
at
a
disadvantage,&#8221;
Portman
stated.
&#8220;These
important
reforms
will
streamline
and
simplify
a
system
few
currently
understand
while
providing
a
clear
pathway
for
the
Miscellaneous
Tariff
Bill
to
be
renewed
to
provide
needed
aid
to
American
manufacturers.&#8221;
Last
week,
Portman
introduced
the
American
Manufacturing
Competitiveness
Act,
legislation
to
reform
the
MTB
with
Senators
Claire
McCaskill
(D-Mo.),
Pat
Toomey
(R-Pa.)
and
Richard
Burr
(R-N.C.),
following
up
on
a
similar
bill
he
introduced
with
McCaskill
earlier
this
year.
Portman&#8217;s
amendment
was
cosponsored
by
Senators
Toomey,
Casey,
Burr
and
Carper.
Portman&#8217;s
amendment
with
Senator
Brown
to
ensure
steel
companies
can
more
easily
seek
help
from
illegally
undersold
and
subsidized
imports
also
passed
the
Finance
Committee
on
Wednesday.
This
bipartisan
measure
was
backed
by
American
steel
manufacturers
like
AK
Steel,
US
Steel,
Nucor,
ArcelorMittal
along
with
the
United
Steelworkers.
Portman
and
Senator
Ron
Wyden
(D-Oregon)
also
welcomed
inclusion
of
crucial
legislation
to
crack
down
on
customs
duty
evasion
schemes
through
the
ENFORCE
Act.
Portman
also
announced
that
his
bipartisan
amendment
with
Senator
Ben
Cardin
(D-Md.)
to
the
Trade
Promotion
Authority
(TPA)
legislation
aimed
at
combatting
the
anti-Israel
Boycott,
Divestment
and
Sanctions
(BDS)
movement
successfully
passed
the
Senate
Finance
Committee .
Over
the
past
several
years,
a
growing
contingency
of
countries
have
sought
to
isolate
and
delegitimize
Israel
through
BDS.
This
amendment
leverages
ongoing
trade
negotiations
to
discourage
prospective
U.S.
trade
partners
from
engaging
in
economic
discrimination
against
Israel.
Video
of
Portman&#8217;s
remarks
can
be
found
here .
&#8220;This
amendment
sends
a
clear
message
that
if
you
want
to
be
an
economic
partner
with
the
United
States,
you
cannot
support
politically
motivated
boycotts
of
Israel,&#8221;
said
Portman.
&#8220;I&#8217;m
pleased
that
it
was
successfully
included
in
this
legislation
because
it
says
the
United
States
will
not
stand
with
those
who
attempt
to
weaken
Israel.&#8221;
Portman
also
offered
an
amendment
addressing
currency
manipulation
to
the
TPA
legislation.
Portman&#8217;s
bipartisan
amendment,
co-sponsored
by
Senator
Debbie
Stabenow
(D-MI),
puts
teeth
into
addressing
currency
manipulation
by
holding
countries
accountable
to
International
Monetary
Fund
standards.
It
would
add
explicit
and
enforceable
currency
language
necessary
to
ensure
that
foreign
competitors
don't
use
their
exchange
rates
to
subsidize
their
exports
at
the
expense
of
products
made
by
American
workers.
Portman&#8217;s
amendment
was
backed
by
American
automakers
like
Ford
and
GM
along
with
American
steel
companies
like
Timken,
AK
Steel,
Nucor
and
US
Steel.
&#8220;We
need
a
balanced
approach
on
trade
&#8211;
fighting
for
good
jobs
through
more
exports
and
fighting
against
unfair
trade
practices,&#8221;
said
Portman.
&#8220;Unfortunately,
some
of
our
competitors
tilt
the
playing-field
by
manipulating
their
currencies,
so
that
our
American-made
exports
are
more
expensive,
while
our
competitors&#8217;
exports
into
our
country
are
cheaper.
That&#8217;s
not
fair
for
Ohio
workers
who
can
compete
with
anyone
on
a
level
playing-field,
and
this
amendment
provides
enforceable
measures
to
achieve
that
outcome.
I
will
continue
to
fight
to
get
it
included
in
TPA
when
it
moves
to
the
Senate
floor.&#8221;
Video
of
Portman&#8217;s
remarks
can
be
found
here .
Portman
has
repeatedly
called
for
currency
issues
to
be
addressed
in
any
trade
negotiation.
He
signed
a
letter
with
60
senators
calling
for
currency
to
be
addressed
in
trade
agreements .
He
also
has
raised
it
repeatedly
with
Cabinet
officials,
including
in
hearings
in
February
with
Secretary
Lew
and
Ambassador
Froman.
During
each
hearing
he
held
up
letters
from
Ohio
United
Automobile
Workers
(UAW)
at
Ford
plants.
Portman
visited
Ford
plants
in
Sharonville
and
Brook
Park
to
discuss
currency
issues
with
UAW
workers
in
2013.
Portman
has
also
repeatedly
stood
up
for
Ohio
workers
targeted
by
illegally
subsidized
or
undersold
imports,
ranging
from
pipe
and
tube
products
(oil
country
tubular
goods),
tires
(case
ongoing
with
United
Steelworkers
(USW)),
light
weight
thermal
paper
(West
Carrollton),
uncoated
paper
(with
USW),
and
others.
Last
Thursday,
Portman
highlighted
the
negative
effects
of
the
Medical
Device
Tax
at
a
Senate
Finance
Committee
hearing.
Portman,
along
with
a
bipartisan
group
of
Senators,
introduced
the
Medical
Device
Access
and
Innovation
Protection
Act
earlier
this
year.
This
bill
will
repeal
the
medical
device
tax
that
was
implemented
as
a
part
of
Obamacare.
Under
Obamacare,
manufacturers
of
medical
devices
are
required
to
pay
a
2.3
percent
excise
tax
on
products
ranging
from
surgical
tools
to
bed
pans.
The
tax,
which
took
effect
in
January
2013,
is
hurting
innovation,
job
creation,
and
the
overall
delivery
of
quality
patient
care.
A
study
by
the
Advanced
Medical
Technology
Association
(AdvaMed)
found
that
the
tax
impacted
approximately
33,000
American
jobs
in
its
first
year,
either
through
layoffs
or
forgone
jobs
that
would
have
been
created.

Congress
gave
final
approval
this
week
to
a
scaled-back
version
of
energy
efficiency
legislation
championed
by
Sen.
Rob
Portman,
R-Ohio.
With
President
Obama
expected
to
sign
the
bill

in
the
coming

Portman
said
it
was
a
major
victory
that

"This
is
an

the

Congress
Passes
Bipartisan
Bill
to
Improve
Energy
Efficiency
Congress
on
Tuesday
passed
a
bill
focused
on
improving
energy
efficiency
in
buildings
and
water
heaters,
a
move
celebrated
by
both
parties
for
breaking
longstanding
partisan
gridlock.
The
bill,
which
President
Obama
is
expected
to
sign
into
law
this
week,
is
a
modest
one.
But
its
authors,
Senator
Rob
Portman,
Republican
of
Ohio,
and
Senator
Jeanne
Shaheen,
Democrat
of
New
Hampshire,
who
had
worked
together
for
years
on
more
ambitious
energy-saving
legislation,
called
it
a
significant
victory.
&#8230;
Mr.
Portman
said,
&#8220;Our
targeted
energy
efficiency
bill
has
garnered
widespread
support
because
of
a
simple
fact:
It
is
good
for
the
economy
and
good
for
the
environment.&#8221;
The
two
senators
have
been
working
together
since
2011
on
their
broader
energy
efficiency
measure.
That
bill,
which
also
has
bipartisan
support,
would
create
incentives
for
federal
mortgage
writers
to
incorporate
energy-efficient
heating
and
cooling
systems
into
the
value
of
a
home,
establish
training
programs
in
energy-efficiency
construction,
create
programs
to
increase
the
energy
efficiency
of
manufacturing
supply
chains,
and
direct
the
Energy
Department
to
work
with
manufacturers
on
energy-efficient
technology.
&#8230;
This
year,
the
senators
introduced
a
bill
that
incorporated
a
few
elements
of
the
broader
measure.
The
narrower
bill
would
create
a
voluntary
program
for
landlords
and
tenants
to
improve
energy
efficiency
in
commercial
buildings,
mandate
that
large
electric
water
heaters
be
run
in
a
highly
energy-efficient
manner
and
require
federal
agencies
to
perform
energy-use
assessments
on
commercial
buildings
that
they
lease.

Trade
with

should
be
balanced
Amid
a
contentious
fight
over
the
Trans-Pacific
Partnership
trade
agreement,
Ohio
Sens.
Rob
Portman
and
Sherrod
Brown
are
pushing
for
a
legislative
amendment
to
attack
currency
manipulation.
The
trade
agreement
has
sparked
a
fierce
fight
in
Congress
with
action
shifting
lately
to
the
Senate
which
is
debating
giving
President
Obama
fast
track
authority
to
conclude
the
deal
with
the
provision
the
treaty

made
public
for
a

a
power
also
known
as
Fast

fighting

&#8220;Unfortunately,
some
of

competitors
tilt
the
playing-field
by
manipulating
their
currencies,
so
that

TimkenSteel
shows
off
new
caster
Customers
and
vendors
had
the
chance
Friday
to
see
TimkenSteel
Corp.&#8217;s
new
jumbo
bloom
vertical
caster.
The
company
opened
the
doors
to
the
Faircrest
Steel
Mill
to
officially
commission
the
giant
caster.
TimkenSteel
officials
said
the
caster
is
the
largest
of
its
kind
in
the
world,
and
that
the
Faircrest
mill
is
the
only
plant
that
has
a
jumbo
bloom
vertical
caster
and
an
in-line
forge
press.
The
caster
has
been
operating
since
late
October.
Steel
made
during
the
first
run
was
sold
to
a
customer,
a
testament
to
the
strength
of
the
new
technology,
as
well
as
the
skill
and
expertise
of
employees
operating
the
equipment,
TimkenSteel
officials
said.
&#8230;
Since
October
the
caster
has
been
used
more
that
300
times
and
produced
more
that
45,000
tons
of
steel
blooms.
The
blooms
later
are
rolled
into
bars
and
tubes
used
in
the
industrial,
energy,
bearing,
military
and
heavy
machinery
markets.
&#8230;
Joining
the
celebration
were
U.S.
Sen.
Rob
Portman,
R-Cincinnati,
and
U.S.
Reps
Bob
Gibbs,
R-Lakeville,
and
Jim
Renacci,
R-Wadsworth.
Gibbs
represents
Ohio&#8217;s
7th
District,
where
Faircrest
is
located,
and
Renacci
has
the
16th
District,
home
to
TimkenSteel
headquarters
and
factories.
Timken
said
it
is
important
for
government
and
business
to
have
a
good
relationship.
&#8220;Working
together
we
make
American
manufacturing
strong,&#8221;
he
said.
Portman
echoed
the
sentiments
and
said
he
plans
to
take
steps
next
week
aimed
at
helping
American
businesses
deal
with
foreign
competitors
that
dump
products
in
U.S.
markets.
He
plans
to
propose
an
amendment
that
will
make
it
easier
for
U.S.
companies
to
show
they
have
suffered
material
injury
because
of
dumping
by
a
foreign
competitor.
Portman
said
he
also
would
like
to
see
steps
taken
to
help
oil
and
natural
gas
companies
export
their
products.
Shale
oil
drilling
has
increased
U.S.
oil
and
gas
production,
making
exports
possible.
TimkenSteel
is
used
in
oil
and
gas
drilling,
Portman
said.
&#8220;We
need
to
make
sure
this
caster
is
busy,
that
this
caster
has
a
lot
of
customers.&#8221;
&#8230;
Portman
said
innovation
helped
make
Faircrest
the
most
efficient
steel
mill
in
the
world.
&#8220;Washington
isn&#8217;t
doing
enough
to
support
that
kind
of
innovation,&#8221;
he
said.
