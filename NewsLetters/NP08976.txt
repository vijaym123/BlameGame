Help With a Federal Agency
Dear Friend-
This week marks the 70th anniversary of the D-Day invasion during World
War II.
To see many of the vets who stormed those beaches return in
their twilight years to commemorate the occasion is quite inspiring.
Anyone who cares about freedom and justice owes those veterans a great
deal of thanks for answering the call when the world was spiraling
towards complete disaster.
National security and defense issues have taken center stage this week.
Here is a brief rundown of what has happened:
1.
Releasing 5 high-level jihadists.
The decision by President Obama
to release 5 senior Taliban commanders has been met with dismay, as it
effectively replenishes the Taliban's senior leadership. These
detainees are skilled jihadists who, as the President himself admitted,
will very likely resume waging jihad.
Indeed, one of them, Noorullah
Noori, has already stated that will be resume trying to kill Americans
now that he is released.
The release is being hailed by the Taliban and the Haqqani terror
network as a major victory for their cause.
The Taliban has already
declared that this lopsided "deal" provides them incentive to capture
Americans in the future.
As Dutch Ruppersberger, the senior Democrat
on the House Intelligence Committee pointed out, the detainee release
"puts all Americans at risk throughout the world, including our men and
women on the front line."
2.
Bowe Bergdahl.
It is good that Bergdahl is now in U.S. custody.
I
do think the U.S. had a responsibility to bring him back to America in
spite of his possible desertion, just not at the price of degrading our
national security by releasing seasoned jihadists, which harms all
Americans.
A lot of veterans are dismayed at how the Obama administration treated
Bergdahl as a hero -- from the White House Rose Garden ceremony with
the parents to the statements by Susan Rice that Bergdahl served with
"honor and distinction" before being "captured on the battlefield."
After listening to the testimonials from his unit members, it is likely
that Bergdahl deserted his unit and it is possible that he collaborated
with the Taliban.
At the appropriate time he should face the consequences for his actions
via the court-martial process.
Desertion in wartime is one the most
serious offenses in the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and the
allegations that Bergdahl's conduct led to the deaths of six (or more)
of his fellow soldiers and that the precision and lethality of enemy
attacks increased significantly immediately after his desertion are
incredibly aggravating.
Bergdahl should explain his conduct and
justice should be done.
3.
A lawless transfer.
The defense authorization bill signed by
President Obama in December 2013 clearly prohibited any transfer of a
terror detainee from Guantanamo Bay without providing 30 days advance
notice to Congress.
The Obama administration has been all over the map
in trying to explain away why the President violated this law.
Administration officials have argued that they could not notify
Congress for fear that the Taliban would kill Bergdahl if word of the
deal leaked.
That explanation undercuts the notion that this was a
routine prisoner exchange and makes the episode sound like a hostage
situation.
What is more, members of both parties who have been briefed
in a classified setting have denied that there is evidence that
Bergdahl was in impending danger.
It seems likely that the Obama
administration did not follow the law because they did not want
Congress to raise objections and stop the release of the terror
detainees.
4.
Sending U.S. taxpayer dollars to terror group Hamas.
The
Palestinian Authority has announced a "unity government" with the
terrorist group Hamas, which should trigger an immediate cessation of
funds under current law.
Moreover, it is a federal criminal offense to
provide material support to a terrorist group.
Yet, the State
Department has announced that it will continue to send taxpayer dollars
to the new unity government.
This is both illegal and bad policy.
5.
VA reform.
Though news of the release of the terrorist detainees
has dominated the discussion, the issue of the poor treatment of
veterans by the VA is not going anywhere.
A recent poll of veterans
found that almost 60% believe that the terror detainees at Guantanamo
Bay receive better medical care than American veterans through the VA.
How did it ever get to this point?
The first order of business is to create accountability within the VA
bureaucracy.
After that, Congress needs to embrace reforms to the
system that will provide veterans with more choices and options
regarding their care.
I very much appreciate all the veterans who have
contacted our office to give their views about how best to serve our
veterans.

Dear
Friend&#8211;
This
week
marks
the
70th
anniversary
of
the
D-Day
invasion
during
World
War
II.
To
see
many
of
the
vets
who
stormed
those
beaches
return
in
their
twilight
years
to
commemorate
the
occasion
is
quite
inspiring.
Anyone
who
cares
about
freedom
and
justice
owes
those
veterans
a
great
deal
of
thanks
for
answering
the
call
when
the
world
was
spiraling
towards
complete
disaster.
National
security
and
defense
issues
have
taken
center
stage
this
week.
Here
is
a
brief
rundown
of
what
has
happened:
1.
Releasing
5
high-level
jihadists.
The
decision
by
President
Obama
to
release
5
senior
Taliban
commanders
has
been
met
with
dismay,
as
it
effectively
replenishes
the
Taliban's
senior
leadership.
These
detainees
are
skilled
jihadists
who,
as
the
President
himself
admitted,
will
very
likely
resume
waging
jihad.
Indeed,
one
of
them,
Noorullah
Noori,
has
already
stated
that
will
be
resume
trying
to
kill
Americans
now
that
he
is
released.
The
release
is
being
hailed
by
the
Taliban
and
the
Haqqani
terror
network
as
a
major
victory
for
their
cause.
The
Taliban
has
already
declared
that
this
lopsided
"deal"
provides
them
incentive
to
capture
Americans
in
the
future.
As
Dutch
Ruppersberger,
the
senior
Democrat
on
the
House
Intelligence
Committee
pointed
out,
the
detainee
release
"puts
all
Americans
at
risk
throughout
the
world,
including
our
men
and
women
on
the
front
line."
2.
Bowe
Bergdahl.
It
is
good
that
Bergdahl
is
now
in
U.S.
custody.
I
do
think
the
U.S.
had
a
responsibility
to
bring
him
back
to
America
in
spite
of
his
possible
desertion,
just
not
at
the
price
of
degrading
our
national
security
by
releasing
seasoned
jihadists,
which
harms
all
Americans.
A
lot
of
veterans
are
dismayed
at
how
the
Obama
administration
treated
Bergdahl
as
a
hero
--
from
the
White
House
Rose
Garden
ceremony
with
the
parents
to
the
statements
by
Susan
Rice
that
Bergdahl
served
with
"honor
and
distinction"
before
being
"captured
on
the
battlefield."
After
listening
to
the
testimonials
from
his
unit
members,
it
is
likely
that
Bergdahl
deserted
his
unit
and
it
is
possible
that
he
collaborated
with
the
Taliban.
At
the
appropriate
time
he
should
face
the
consequences
for
his
actions
via
the
court-martial
process.
Desertion
in
wartime
is
one
the
most
serious
offenses
in
the
Uniform
Code
of
Military
Justice,
and
the
allegations
that
Bergdahl's
conduct
led
to
the
deaths
of
six
(or
more)
of
his
fellow
soldiers
and
that
the
precision
and
lethality
of
enemy
attacks
increased
significantly
immediately
after
his
desertion
are
incredibly
aggravating.
Bergdahl
should
explain
his
conduct
and
justice
should
be
done.
3.
A
lawless
transfer.
The
defense
authorization
bill
signed
by
President
Obama
in
December
2013
clearly
prohibited
any
transfer
of
a
terror
detainee
from
Guantanamo
Bay
without
providing
30
days
advance
notice
to
Congress.
The
Obama
administration
has
been
all
over
the
map
in
trying
to
explain
away
why
the
President
violated
this
law.
Administration
officials
have
argued
that
they
could
not
notify
Congress
for
fear
that
the
Taliban
would
kill
Bergdahl
if
word
of
the
deal
leaked.
That
explanation
undercuts
the
notion
that
this
was
a
routine
prisoner
exchange
and
makes
the
episode
sound
like
a
hostage
situation.
What
is
more,
members
of
both
parties
who
have
been
briefed
in
a
classified
setting
have
denied
that
there
is
evidence
that
Bergdahl
was
in
impending
danger.
It
seems
likely
that
the
Obama
administration
did
not
follow
the
law
because
they
did
not
want
Congress
to
raise
objections
and
stop
the
release
of
the
terror
detainees.
4.
Sending
U.S.
taxpayer
dollars
to
terror
group
Hamas.
The
Palestinian
Authority
has
announced
a
"unity
government"
with
the
terrorist
group
Hamas,
which
should
trigger
an
immediate
cessation
of
funds
under
current
law.
Moreover,
it
is
a
federal
criminal
offense
to
provide
material
support
to
a
terrorist
group.
Yet,
the
State
Department
has
announced
that
it
will
continue
to
send
taxpayer
dollars
to
the
new
unity
government.
This
is
both
illegal
and
bad
policy.
5.
VA
reform.
Though
news
of
the
release
of
the
terrorist
detainees
has
dominated
the
discussion,
the
issue
of
the
poor
treatment
of
veterans
by
the
VA
is
not
going
anywhere.
A
recent
poll
of
veterans
found
that
almost
60%
believe
that
the
terror
detainees
at
Guantanamo
Bay
receive
better
medical
care
than
American
veterans
through
the
VA.
How
did
it
ever
get
to
this
point?
The
first
order
of
business
is
to
create
accountability
within
the
VA
bureaucracy.
After
that,
Congress
needs
to
embrace
reforms
to
the
system
that
will
provide
veterans
with
more
choices
and
options
regarding
their
care.
I
very
much
appreciate
all
the
veterans
who
have
contacted
our
office
to
give
their
views
about
how
best
to
serve
our
veterans.
