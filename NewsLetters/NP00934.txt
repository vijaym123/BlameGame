Raise the Wage!
Dear Friend,
This week, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that he made a clarion call to impanel a Wage Board for fast food workers in his efforts to increase the minimum wage for fast food workers in New York State. I am proud that our Governor is leading the nation in taking bold actions to give a much-needed pay raise to fast food workers who deserve it. In America, the land of opportunity, no one who works full time should be struggling to raise a family. Ensuring a living wage is not just about providing fair compensation, but also
preserving justice and dignity for working families .
In Congress, I will keep fighting alongside my Democratic Colleagues and President Obama to pass the Raise the Wage Act, which will increase the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $12.00 by 2020. Raising the minimum wage is not only good for millions of Americas workers, it is good for America. Let us remember:
When Americans succeed, America succeeds .
Mental Health Awareness Month
During the Mental Health Awareness Month in May, the federal Veterans Administration is encouraging veterans, their families, and friends to visit
MakeTheConnection.net . Make the Connection is a national awareness program operated by the VA, aimed at reducing the negative perceptions and stigma associated with seeking mental health care. If you or a loved one has suffered from the hidden wounds of war, please take advantage of this invaluable program.
Sincerely,
Charles Rangel
