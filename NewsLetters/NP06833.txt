Friends,
For the first time in 30
years, the Department of the Interior is considering the Atlantic
Seaboard for seismic testing for oil and gas resources.
This does not
mean that oil companies can start drilling in the Atlantic this year,
next year, or the next five years.
Instead, reopening the
seaboard for testing continues the exploration process needed to determine
what energy resources are below our oceans floor.
Before
seismic testing begins, and before the Department rolls out its Five Year
Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing Program, the agency
requested public comments and input.
This open comment
period ended last week and I wanted to share with you the comments I
sent to Department of Interior Secretary Sally
Jewell.
Since I think the U.S. Department of the Interior must coordinate
closely with coastal states and coastal communities as it works to
advance a new Five Year OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program, I sent Secretary
Jewell my own comments instead of signing onto letters authored by
other Representatives.
Our district entertains 14 million
visitors annually and it is imperative that our hoteliers, restaurateurs,
small businesses, and residents are able to participate in this
process and voice their input.
I am committed to a strong
national energy strategy and recognize the importance of protecting South
Carolinas beautiful coastline.
Have a good
week,
