Rep. Bruce Braley -- Iowa's First
District
David,
Growing up in Brooklyn, Iowa, detassling corn and walking beans, I know
first hand that agriculture is not only a major part of our state's
economy -- it's our way of life.
But if some Washington bureaucrats get their way, a centerpiece of the
agriculture economy in our state -- renewable energy -- will be rolled
back, costing Iowa thousands of jobs and millions of dollars.
Last month, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed scaling back
the Renewable Fuels Standard which would deal a severe blow to the
renewable energy industry in our state.
Tomorrow, I will be testifying before the EPA, urging the agency to
abandon their proposed change -- and I want to add your voice as part
of my testimony.
Click here to tell me how the renewable energy industry affects you
personally, and I will share your stories with the EPA during my
testimony tomorrow.
The RFS is critical to promoting the continued expansion of homegrown,
renewable energy -- a vital component of Iowa agriculture and our
economy. As a national leader in biofuels, Iowa's renewable energy
industry is responsible for 4 percent of Iowa's GDP and supports over
60,000 jobs.
Folks in Washington should be working every day to grow the economy,
not hurt it. If these changes go into effect, Iowa's economy will
suffer.
But by standing together, we can convince the EPA to change its mind
and show the bureaucrats in Washington that the RFS is vital to Iowa's
agriculture economy.
Share your story here and I hope to use it in my testimony tomorrow>>

I look forward to hearing from you.
All the best,
Bruce
