Defending Life
Thousands braved the bitter
cold in DC this past Wednesday to participate in the
March for Life . Through this important event, and others like it
across the country, we remember that there is no greater cause than to
speak in love for those who cannot speak for themselves. As the
father of two children, I wholeheartedly affirm the sanctity of life for
every human being. In Congress, I will continue to defend each life as a
precious gift from God.
This upcoming week, the House
will vote on H.R. 7, the
No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act ,
to end taxpayer funding for abortions once and for all. It is time for
Congress to stand up for the most vulnerable while respecting the
consciences of millions of Americans.
11th District Spotlight
Earlier this
week, I took a tour of the Home Depot in Hendersonville. A true
dedication to customer service was evident from every aisle to every
employee I met. It was also quite thoughtful of the team to make me feel
welcome with a personalized apron!
On
Tuesday, I had the opportunity to tour Duke Energy's plant in Arden. It is
encouraging to see the efforts being made by so many of these dedicated,
long-serving employees to ensure that the energy produced is clean,
environmentally-sound and cost-effective.
As a special treat this
week, I got to stop by Harry's in Hendersonville for lunch. Thank you
for the delicious food and friendly service!
