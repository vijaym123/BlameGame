David -- This is a long email. But please read the whole thing.
We have a crisis on our hands. As you know, the Supreme Court&rsquo;s
Citizens United
decision opened up a flood of corporate cash in our elections. From the start, we knew we couldn&rsquo;t compete with all the Republican SuperPAC attacks out there. So we chose to run this campaign differently.
We decided to rely on grassroots contributions instead of checks from Big Oil billionaires.
We decided to invest in our communities with an unprecedented get-out-the-vote operation.
We decided to register more voters (75,000) and knock on more doors (3 million) than ever before.
In short, we chose to invest in people.
(and no, corporations are NOT people)
But that grassroots strategy only works if we can give our community organizers enough cover on the airwaves to win these races on the ground. And right now, we&rsquo;re not holding up our end of the bargain. Just take a look at this chart of Republican ad spending:
Republican ad spending has spiked this week. And right now, we can&rsquo;t keep up.
Now, we have to make some painful decisions. If we can&rsquo;t pull together another $142,000 before tonight, we&rsquo;ll have to slash our get-out-the-vote program or pull more ads off the air.
So David, when we say we&rsquo;re pleading for you to make a donation, we&rsquo;re not kidding. We really need your help.
