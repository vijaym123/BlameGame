Wreath laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Arlington
National Cemetery
Dear Fellow Hoosier,
This Memorial Day weekend, the nation will pause to honor the men and
women in uniform who paid the ultimate price for our freedom.
Flags will be placed at the graves of the fallen and parades will be
held in towns across the country in their honor.
As I reflect on that sacrifice, I am also mindful of the more than 2
million military members who are proudly serving today. They are our
fathers, sons, mothers, daughters, neighbors and friends.
Like many Americans, I am deeply disturbed by the allegations of
medical misconduct within the Department of Veterans Affairs.
It is
shameful that nearly 40 veterans died in Phoenix while allegedly
awaiting care at a VA medical center.
What's also troubling are the
allegations that staffers tried to cook the books to hide treatment
delays.
That's why I supported the VA Management Accountability Act, which the
House just passed, to make it easier to fire or demote senior leaders
who are failing to live up to their responsibilities to our service men
and women.
The bill is designed to foster a culture of accountability
and transparency at the VA to replace the current culture of
bureaucracy and secrecy that seems to exist now.
But, that's not enough.
The VA needs to be examined, from top to
bottom, to determine what is working and what isn't.
Persistent
problems must be fixed, inefficient processes and ineffective practices
must be overhauled, and inappropriate or criminal behavior must be
stopped.
Those responsible for these failures should be held
accountable.
If you get a chance this weekend, please say "thank you" to a soldier.
Our nation owes each of them a debt that can never be repaid, but their
sacrifice can be honored.
I hope you are able to celebrate the freedom that we enjoy with friends
and family this weekend.
If there is any Federal matter with which I can help you, do not
hesitate to reach out to my offices in Richmond, Shelbyville, Muncie
and D.C.

Happy Memorial Day!

Wreath
laying
ceremony
at
the
Tomb
of
the
Unknown
Soldier
Arlington
National
Cemetery
Dear
Fellow
Hoosier,
This
Memorial
Day
weekend,
the
nation
will
pause
to
honor
the
men
and
women
in
uniform
who
paid
the
ultimate
price
for
our
freedom.
Flags
will
be
placed
at
the
graves
of
the
fallen
and
parades
will
be
held
in
towns
across
the
country
in
their
honor.
As
I
reflect
on
that
sacrifice,
I
am
also
mindful
of
the
more
than
2
million
military
members
who
are
proudly
serving
today. They
are
our
fathers,
sons,
mothers,
daughters,
neighbors
and
friends.
Like
many
Americans,
I
am
deeply
disturbed
by
the
allegations
of
medical
misconduct
within
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs.
It
is
shameful
that
nearly
40
veterans
died
in
Phoenix
while
allegedly
awaiting
care
at
a
VA
medical
center.
What's
also
troubling
are
the
allegations
that
staffers
tried
to
cook
the
books
to
hide
treatment
delays.
That's
why
I
supported
the
VA
Management
Accountability
Act,
which
the
House
just
passed,
to
make
it
easier
to
fire
or
demote
senior
leaders
who
are
failing
to
live
up
to
their
responsibilities
to
our
service
men
and
women.
The
bill
is
designed
to
foster
a
culture
of
accountability
and
transparency
at
the
VA
to
replace
the
current
culture
of
bureaucracy
and
secrecy
that
seems
to
exist
now.
But,
that's
not
enough.
The
VA
needs
to
be
examined,
from
top
to
bottom,
to
determine
what
is
working
and
what
isn't.
Persistent
problems
must
be
fixed,
inefficient
processes
and
ineffective
practices
must
be
overhauled,
and
inappropriate
or
criminal
behavior
must
be
stopped.
Those
responsible
for
these
failures
should
be
held
accountable.
If
you
get
a
chance
this
weekend,
please
say
"thank
you"
to
a
soldier.
Our
nation
owes
each
of
them
a
debt
that
can
never
be
repaid,
but
their
sacrifice
can
be
honored.
I
hope
you
are
able
to
celebrate
the
freedom
that
we
enjoy
with
friends
and
family
this
weekend.
If
there
is
any
Federal
matter
with
which
I
can
help
you,
do
not
hesitate
to
reach
