Conaway Chronicle:
Holding the Administration Accountable for ESA Recovery,
A Touching Story from Angelo State University
__________________________________________
Thank you for reading The Conaway Chronicle, a review of my activities in Congress and the 11th District.
Holding the Administration Accountable for ESA Recovery
Thursday, Congressman Bruce Westerman and I introduced the Accountable Recovery Act. This legislation requires that recovery plans for species conservation are made publically available once a species is listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).
The purpose of the Endangered Species Act is to recover species, but all too often species are listed with no real plans for recovery. This legislation will ensure that not only are comprehensive species recovery plans with objective criteria in place, but they are made publically available so that the best available science will prevail. Im looking forward to working with my colleague Rep. Westerman to get this important legislation passed into law.
A Touching Story from Angelo State University
I recently came across an incredibly touching story from Angelo State University. Kandis Eagleton was working towards a Master of Education in guidance and counseling from ASU online while working full time with special needs students when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She continued to excel and completed her degree despite the obstacles. However, she had a surgery scheduled just days before her commencement ceremony, and wouldn't be able to make the trip to take part in the ceremony.
When ASU President Brian May found out, he decided to drive 386 miles to put on a commencement ceremony for Kandis. He invited all of her friends, family, and students, and they honored her accomplishments with a commencement ceremony just for her.
I am truly moved by the generosity of President May, Dr. Topliff, and all the others who helped pull this off. Kandis, congratulations on your tremendous accomplishments. I wish you nothing but the best.
As always, you can follow me on

Sincerely,
Rep. Mike Conaway, 11th District
