Wicker Fights Administration's
Proposed
Changes to National Guard
Guard
Components Are Integral to Army's
Overall Strength and
Capability
After more than a
decade of combat, the National Guard is facing dramatic changes to its
role as a ready reserve force of the Army.
A number of changes
follow misguided budget proposals by the Obama Administration to
reduce Army personnel and reorganize its aviation program.
I am
working diligently with Mississippi's congressional delegation to ensure
our well-trained units and facilities are protected from indiscriminate
harm.
Mississippi's
155th
Of particular attention is the future of the
Mississippi National Guard's 155th Heavy Brigade Combat Team
one of 28 such
teams across the country.
Army Chief of Staff Gen. Raymond
Odierno has proposed to deactivate six of these units as part of Defense
Secretary Chuck Hagel's plan to concentrate training and equipment on a
smaller active-duty force.
This ill-advised approach unfairly places the burden of
sequestration squarely on America's National Guard components.
As our
state's congressional delegation and National Guard leaders argue, the Obama
Administration is wrong to ignore the important contributions that
combat teams like the 155th offer the Army's overall strength and
capability.
Not least is the critical support they have provided
during the U.S. operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Reducing the Army's ability to depend on
cost-effective National Guard units would be a mistake that threatens to
reverse years of experience, investment, and readiness.
There is no
substitute for well-trained citizen-soldiers in times of major crisis
and prolonged conflict
not to mention in the aftermath of disaster.
Just last month, we witnessed the importance of the 155th Heavy
Brigade Combat Team in responding to the tornadoes that left a swath of
destruction across Mississippi. Members of the 155th provided vital
security and search-and-rescue
help.
Maintaining the
Guard's
Preparedness
Another proposal in the Army's sweeping restructure is the removal of
Apache attack helicopters from Mississippi's National Guard units.
In
theory, the helicopters would be replaced with Blackhawks, but there
is no assurance that Mississippi would be allocated these additional
aircraft.
The loss of the Apaches would preclude National Guard
members from operating advanced war-fighting machinery. Simply put, it
would fundamentally change the National Guard's traditional combat
role
adversely affecting the military's capacity to interchange reserve
and active-duty units.
The Guard would no longer be
combat-ready at a moment's notice.
Army Plan Needs
Independent Review
There is
increasing scrutiny in Congress on the Army's plans.
Overwhelming
bipartisan support exists for maintaining the National Guard's current
capabilities.
Nearly every Senator, in fact, is a member of the
National Guard Caucus.
Sen. Thad Cochran and I have also cosponsored
Senate legislation to establish a National Commission on the Future of the
Army, which would study the Administration's proposed changes.
Introduced by Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.),
the bill would set up a panel for independently assessing overall size
and force mix.
It is understandable that our military's needs
after Sept. 11, 2001, are likely to be different than its needs today,
as our forces withdraw from two wars.
But finding the right
modifications is important to ensuring our national security interests are
not compromised because of a premature deactivation.
Although budget constraints are
difficult for all government departments, modernizing the Army should not
jeopardize our country's ability to respond to a crisis.
As a
member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am committed to finding
a solution that keeps combat teams like Mississippi's 155th ready to
answer the nation's call.
This fight will begin in earnest with
the upcoming Fiscal Year 2015 National Defense Authorization Act.
I will work with my colleagues to ensure that America's future
preparedness is not forsaken by shortsighted decisions.
