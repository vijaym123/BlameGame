Dear Friends,
In April, I marked my first year representing the 2nd Congressional
District.
It has been my honor to be your voice and your champion in Washington.
>From day one, my priorities in office have been two-fold: to fight for
my constituents' best interests in Washington and to provide the
absolute best constituent services at home.
To that end, we saw much success in April, from the district receiving
over $1 million in grants, to the opening of our new Kankakee office,
to the selection of the winner of the Second District's Congressional
Art Competition.
We've accomplished a great deal together so far and I am very excited
about the year ahead. I look forward to continuing to work with you to
make the Second District an even better place to work and live!
Sincerely,
Robin L. Kelly

Housing Fair
Unfortunately, the Second District has one of the highest foreclosure
rates in the state. To assist the district's distressed homeowners, I
held the Second District Housing Fair to connect them with the
resources they need to keep their homes.
Nearly 200 homeowners attended the fair, held at Victory Apostolic
Church in Matteson, where dozens of lenders, housing organizations and
government agencies were on hand to help. Participants learned about a
variety of topics, including loan modification, property tax appeals
and first-time home buying.
As long as our friends and neighbors continue to struggle with housing
issues, I will work to assist them by bringing housing programs to the
district to meet their needs.

School in Matteson on job creation in the District
_____
Financial Empowerment Fair
Many families in our district rely on women
as the primary or sole
breadwinner. As such, supporting the financial success of women is key
to creating and maintaining economic stability in our communities.
To that end, I hosted a Financial Empowerment Fair at New Faith Baptist
Church in Matteson that offered women information on a variety of
important financial topics, including budget management, college
financing, foreclosure prevention and retirement planning. The fair
also offered strategies on advancing their careers.
As a former single mother raising two children, I know all too well the
challenges female heads of household face. I will continue to work to
help women achieve financial security.
_____
Health Fair
The health and wellness of my constituents is a top priority of mine,
particularly those residents living in underserved communities. That's
why I sponsored a Health Fair at Corliss Early College STEM High School
in the Pullman neighborhood of Chicago.
The fair offered free health screenings, healthy cooking demonstrations
and stress management sessions. Participants also learned about a
variety of community resources for women's health, senior care and
veterans.
Rep. Kelly speaks with a constituent about available health resources
at her district Health Fair
I am committed to encouraging my constituents to live healthier and
active lives. I'd like to remind everyone about the importance of
preventative health care and that early detection saves lives. Many
health plans now offer free annual physicals and other health
screenings.
So get checked out! You owe it to yourselves and your families.

Kankakee Office Opening
As part of my commitment to provide the best constituent services in
all corners of the district, I opened a new office in Kankakee.
The office is located in Kankakee City Hall, on the lower level, at 304
South Indiana Avenue. It will be open on the second and fourth
Wednesdays of each month, from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
Constituents can receive assistance with Social Security and Veterans
Administration claims and other issues involving federal agencies as
well as get information on federal grants and programs.
I'd like to thank Kankakee Mayor Nina Epstein for providing the space.
I'd also like to thank the many local officials who showed their
support at the office's grand opening, including Mayor Epstein, Bradley
Mayor Bruce Adams, state Rep. Kate Cloonen, state Sen. Donne Trotter
and Kankakee Community College President John Avendano.
To schedule an appointment at the Kankakee office, please call (708)
679-0078.

District Grant Recipients
Part of my duties as a Member of Congress is to support our schools,
community-based organizations and municipalities in applying for
grants.
I'm proud to report that a number of local entities received a total of
more than $1 million in grants -funding that will directly improve our
children's education and the safety of residents.
The municipalities of Momence, Kankakee, Manteno, Flossmoor, and Crete
together received more than $600,000 from the U.S. Department of
Homeland Security for fire equipment and training.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was awarded $500,000 to complete the
design and initiate construction of a sanitary sewer relining project
in Olympia Fields.
The U.S. Department of Education awarded $242,000 to Matteson School
District 162 to expand physical education and after-school programs.
Prairie State College earned a $100,000 federal grant to expand its
child care program so that more student-parents with young children are
able to continue their education.
Several south suburban communities received brownfield cleanup funding
through the South Suburban Mayors and Managers Association. And, Park
Forest received a transportation grant.
Here are some other worthy programs and projects that received grant

Dear
Friends,
In
April,
I
marked
my
first
year
representing
the
2nd
Congressional
District.
It
has
been
my
honor
to
be
your
voice
and
your
champion
in
Washington.
From
day
one,
my
priorities
in
office
have
been
two-fold:
to
fight
for
my
constituents'
best
interests
in
Washington
and
to
provide
the
absolute
best
constituent
services
at
home.
To
that
end,
we
saw
much
success
in
April,
from
the
district
receiving
over
$1
million
in
grants,
to
the
opening
of
our
new
Kankakee
office,
to
the
selection
of
the
winner
of
the
Second
District's
Congressional
Art
Competition.
We've
accomplished
a
great
deal
together
so
far
and
I
am
very
excited
about
the
year
ahead.
I
look
forward
to
continuing
to
work
with
you
to
make
the
Second
District
an
even
better
place
to
work
and
live!
Sincerely,
Robin
L.

Housing
Fair
Unfortunately,
the
Second
District
has
one
of
the
highest
foreclosure
rates
in
the
state.
To
assist
the
district's
distressed
homeowners,
I
held
the
Second
District
Housing
Fair
to
connect
them
with
the
resources
they
need
to
keep
their
homes.
Nearly
200
homeowners
attended
the
fair,
held
at
Victory
Apostolic
Church
in
Matteson,
where
dozens
of
lenders,
housing
organizations
and
government
agencies
were
on
hand
to
help.
Participants
learned
about
a
variety
of
topics,
including
loan
modification,
property
tax
appeals
and
first-time
home
buying.
As
long
as
our
friends
and
neighbors
continue
to
struggle
with
housing
issues,
I
will
work
to
assist
them
by
bringing
housing
programs
to
the
district
to
meet
their
needs.

Financial
Empowerment
Fair
Many
families
in
our
district
rely
on
women
as
the
primary
or

breadwinner.
As
such,
supporting
the
financial
success
of
women
is
key
to
creating
and
maintaining
economic
stability
in
our
communities.
To
that
end,
I
hosted
a
Financial
Empowerment
Fair
at
New

Baptist
Church
in
Matteson
that
offered
women
information
on
a
variety
of
important
financial
topics,
including
budget
management,
college
financing,
foreclosure
prevention
and
retirement
planning.
The
fair
also
offered
strategies
on
advancing
their
careers.
As
a
former
single
mother
raising
two
children,
I
know
all
too
well
the
challenges
female
heads
of
household
face.
I
will
continue
to
work
to
help
women
achieve
financial
security.
Health
Fair
The
health
and
wellness
of
my
constituents
is
a
top
priority
of
mine,
particularly
those
residents
living

communities.
That&#8217;s
why
I
sponsored
a
Health

in
the

neighborhood
of

offered

also

I&#8217;d
like
to
remind
everyone
about
the

Kankakee

Opening
As
part
of
my
commitment
to

of
the

I
opened

claims
and
other

I&#8217;d
like
to

for
providing
the
space.
I&#8217;d
also

Part
of
my
duties
as
a
Member
of
Congress
is
to
support
our
schools,
community-based
organizations

municipalities
in
applying
for
grants.
I&#8217;m
proud
to
report
that
a
number
of
local
entities
received
a
total

more

&#8212;funding

and
the
safety
of
residents.

Crete
together
received
more

fire
equipment

training.
The

awarded
$500,000

complete
the
design
and
initiate
construction
of
a

of
Education
awarded
$242,000
