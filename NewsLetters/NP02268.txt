Friend-
Recently, I cosponsored the
Ensuring Seniors Access to Local Pharmacies Act of 2015
( H.R.793 ) to help protect 4 th
District seniors who live in rural areas and depend upon the local community pharmacy nearest them.
Heres how it works:
While Medicare Part D preferred pharmacy network plans were created to help make prescription drugs more affordable, these plans have also unintentionally put some community pharmacies at a competitive disadvantage. Some seniors, especially in rural areas, have reported having to travel upwards of 20 miles in order to get their medications from a preferred pharmacy network because their local community pharmacy was not given the opportunity to participate in such a network.
This bill will help ensure seniors have better access to prescription medications while helping keep rural community pharmacies competitive with larger pharmacies, by allowing any willing pharmacy located within a designated medically underserved or health professional shortage area to participate in the Medicare Part D preferred network program. This helps reinforce and preserve the critical role that local pharmacies play in delivering care to our rural communities.
I will keep you posted on this bill as it progresses through the House.
Yours in service,
Randy
