Fellow Delawareans,
I thought you might find the following editorial encouraging:
News Journal: A Healthy Compromise in Congress .
Last week in Congress,
a bill I introduced
to save
500 Delaware jobs
passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 268-150. The bill fixed an oversight in the Affordable Care Act that would have put American companies at a disadvantage to their foreign competitors, and put 500 Delaware jobs on the line. Senators Carper and Coons are now working hard to get the bill passed in the Senate.
It isn&rsquo;t easy getting both sides of the aisle to agree on something here in Washington, but we did it through hard work and common sense -- the Delaware Way.
It&rsquo;s an honor to serve as your representative.
Sincerely,
P.S. As the election period quickly approaches, Congressional rules prevent me from communicating with you through mailings like this unless you have signed up for them -- either on
