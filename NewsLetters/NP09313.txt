Dear Friend:
Every Memorial Day, we honor the military men and women who throughout our history have made the ultimate sacrifice in service to America.
We remember these brave service members who courageously risked their own lives to selflessly serve our nation and defend our freedom.

Across the country, flags will be lowered and raised in memory of our fallen heroes, and Americans will mark the day with memorials, parades, and private reflection.

As we remember those who served our country and their families this Memorial Day, their dedication and selflessness should inspire us every day of the year.
This Memorial Day offers us all an opportunity to thank those who gave their lives for our country by remembering and reflecting on that extraordinary legacy.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
