28th
District
Dear Friend,
This last week, the House
moved forward on major NSA reform
something I have been urging for
several years.
In fact, several of the pieces of the reform
measure are very close to the provisions of bills I have introduced in the
past.
Now the ball is in the Senates court, and I hope
they move quickly.
Under the recently declassified telephone
metadata program under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, the government
collects, stores and searches vast numbers of domestic phone records
in order to determine whether there is a link in terrorism cases. This
collection is done in bulk with no individualized finding or specific
order from the courts, but rather a standing order to
telecommunications companies to turn over many of their phone records, though not the
content of the communication.
I believe that this
bulk collection should stop, as it is unnecessary and there is a better
way to get the information we need that is more protective of the
privacy interests of the public.
Click here
to watch my speech on the House Floor this week
advocating for Congress to pass these major
reforms:
I believe
that when it comes to any surveillance program, Members of Congress
should ask themselves several key questions. Is it constitutional, and if
so, is it effective? If our actions were to become public, would we be
able to defend them to our citizens and our allies overseas? And are
there alternative approaches that provide the same capability that are
more protective of the legitimate expectations of privacy of the
American people?
In answering those questions, its clear
theres a better way. The House Intelligence and Judiciary committees have
worked together to find that middle course, and the USA Freedom Act
our compromise legislation
passed overwhelmingly in the
House.
This legislation would end bulk collection, not just of
telephone metadata but all metadata, and create an entirely new, tailored
procedure in which telephone companies would maintain their own
records in a searchable format. The government would be required to go to a
court to get an order to search those numbers, just like domestic law
enforcement.
It would reform the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Court by introducing nongovernment lawyers and technical experts
charged with arguing on behalf of the privacy interests of the American
people and it would require declassification of significant opinions.
Finally, it would enable technology companies to report in
greater detail about the type and numbers of requests they get from the
government.
Now this legislation moves on to the Senate,
which must pass it this week, or the capabilities go away
completely.
Its my hope that in the Senate, supporters of the status quo and
advocates for reform will come to the table before time runs out or we
will end up with a result that benefits no one.
Let me know
your thoughts. You can always share your input through

Through these quick-read updates, I hope to keep you informed of my work at
home and in Washington, D.C. on issues of interest to our
communities, as well as provide an opportunity for you to keep me informed of
your views and interests.
As always, I welcome hearing from you on
these and any other issues, and hope that you will
stay in
touch .
Sincerely,
Congressman Adam Schiff
