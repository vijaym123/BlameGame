Dear Friend,
Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr. is unquestionably one of the preeminent figures in American
history. He was not only an activist, but pioneered many of the ideals we
hold so dear today
namely, nonviolence and equality. It is his set of
values that we follow today as we strive to close the gaps in
equality that persist throughout our
country.
Our country experienced a regrettable setback in 2013 when the
U.S. Supreme Court, when considering the case of
Shelby County v.
Holder , declared Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act
unconstitutional. Designed to prohibit tactics that would effectively prevent
individuals from voting, especially minorities, Section 4 of the Voting
Rights Act was critical in safeguarding Americans right to execute
their key duty as citizens in a
democracy.
These setbacks will not be taken lightly or without a fight.
In July, when considering the case
Perez vs. Perry
concerning
discriminatory gerrymandering in Texas, the U.S. Department of Justice
evoked Section 3 of the Voting Rights Act to require that Texas
receive permission before altering voting procedures. I am confident that
this important check will be applied to other states in the future, as
more states seek to change their voting rights laws in the wake of
Shelby County v.
Holder .
This Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, let us reflect upon Dr. Kings
efforts to bring about such safeguards. Through his tireless efforts and
devotion, he laid the groundwork for a civil rights movement in America.
It is up to us to continue his vital work. Inequality still pervades
too many facets of American society: wealth, employment, education,
and so on. Dr. King declared, We must rapidly begin the shift from a
thing-oriented society to a person-oriented society. When machines and
computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more
important than peopleracism, militarism and economic exploitation are
incapable of being conquered. Dr. Kings reminder is still relevant
decades later. I was humbled to attend the 50th anniversary celebration of
Dr. King's "I Have a Dream" speech this past summer. This milestone
served as an important reminder that we must not ignore the
injustices that our fellow Americans experience. While our country has made
great strides since the time of Martin Luther King, Jr., there remains
much work to be done.
I will
continue to do everything in my power to bring about equality for all
Americans. I am proud to have been awarded the following honors for my
commitment to civil rights:
A+ for fighting
poverty from the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty
"A"
from the NAACP
100% Civil Rights score from The
Leadership Conference on Civil Rights
The greatest way we
can honor Dr. Kings memory is to follow his tremendous example. On this
Martin Luther King Day, we should celebrate our nations progress,
but also work to ensure that progress perseveres.
Sincerely,
Eliot L. Engel
MEMBER OF
CONGRESS
