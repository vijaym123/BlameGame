Dear Friend,
In
case you didn't hear, last week I delivered the Weekly Republican
Address.
It airs just after the President's Weekly Address, a
tradition offered in the principle of fairness and equal time.
Not
only was I happy to address the nation on behalf of Northeast
Georgians, I was proud to be able to do it
from right here in Northeast
Georgia .
Because you've signed up for this e-mail updates, I wanted to send you
this special interactive version
of the address I gave last week .
I hope by
now you know me well enough to know that I don't say things I don't
mean or that I don't believe.
I hope the links here will help show
you what I've done, both at home and with my colleagues in the House,
to
put these words into action .
Take a look and
let me know
what
you think. By the way--if you're over around Lavonia on Thursday, come
to our
town
hall !
Sincerely,
Remarks of Representative Doug Collins
of Georgia
Weekly
Republican Address

Earlier this week, I
visited with folks in Blue Ridge, a small community of less than fifteen
hundred between the Chattahoochee National Forest, the Cohutta
Wilderness Area, and a big, beautiful lake where families often go to camp,
kayak, or just
catch a few
trout .
At the local high
school,
we had a good,
honest conversation
about growing the economy, creating more
jobs, and expanding opportunities for all
Americans.
I
listened
as workers and parents who are living paycheck to
paycheck shared their concerns about the future of their families and
also of our country.
Like most
Americans, my constituents are frustrated with the status
quo.
They wish Washington would
stop meddling in things
that
arent broken, and start fixing the things that
are.
They think theres too much talk, and not enough
action on real solutions.
Those I
talked to want to know,
why
cant our leaders just do their
jobs?
I know how they feel, because my Republican colleagues
in the House and I
have
made the American peoples priorities our
priorities .
Weve passed bill after bill to help our
struggling economy,
save
taxpayer dollars , lower the
cost of gas
and groceries, and
help every child get a good
education .
But Democrats in the Senate have essentially decided to
do nothing .
Our bills are
piling up on Harry Reids desk , collecting
dust.
Even when it comes to
a crisis like the one on our southern
border , House Republicans passed a
common-sense solution , and Senate
Democrats left town without doing the hard work to pass their
own.
Thats just irresponsible
theres no other word for
it.
In recent weeks, Republicans
have led efforts to enact
job
training
legislation that helps people get back to
work.
Weve given veterans stuck in an outdated federal
bureaucracy timely access to the care they
need .
And weve prevented major highway projects
from being shut down.
But there
is much more work to be
done.
President Obama
enjoys
complaining about Congress , but the fact is, his own party controls
the Senate, and they need to get to
work.
Of the bills that have been signed into law, more than
75 percent of them have
originated in the
House .
Whats more, right now, Senate Democrats have failed to take action on more
than 340 bills passed by the
House.
Many of them have bipartisan support, including most of the 43
jobs bills that are
stuck in
this do-nothing
Senate .
So if theyre truly interested in making progress, the president and
his party have a lot of catching up to
do.
Republicans arent going to slow down; were going to keep
passing
common-sense
solutions to help American families , and were going to keep the
pressure on Senate Democrats to do their
job.
Thank you so much for
listening.
