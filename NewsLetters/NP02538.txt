Republicans&rsquo; control over Congress is a complete train wreck. It&rsquo;s bad enough the GOP
David -- We hate to be flooding your inbox, but it&rsquo;s critical that we reach you today.
You&rsquo;ve been a top Democratic supporter -- thank you. But a review of our records shows that you haven&rsquo;t renewed your DSCC membership for 2015 yet:
DSCC Membership Status:
pending
2015 Membership Rate:
$25
(renew membership now)
It&rsquo;s urgent that you renew now.
Republicans&rsquo; control over Congress is a complete train wreck. It&rsquo;s bad enough the GOP tried to undermine Social Security and Obamacare -- now John Boehner is just two days from
shutting down the critical Homeland Security department
over Tea Party politics!
But here&rsquo;s the incredibly frightening part: If we don&rsquo;t act now, the GOP could take control of both the White House
and
all of Congress in 2016.
The right-wing money machine is already firing on all cylinders. If Democrats fall behind in early donations, Republicans could run away with an insurmountable lead.
We need 10,000 Democrats to renew their membership , and we have only 72 hours to make it happen -- that&rsquo;s when the big FEC end-of-month deadline hits.
David, will you renew your membership by the FEC deadline in 72 hours? Your gift will be matched, giving it twice the impact!
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
Remember, Democrats don&rsquo;t have the Koch brothers to bankroll us. Members like you are the heart of this party and will make or break our efforts to hold Republicans accountable and help Democrats win. We&rsquo;re counting on you!
Thanks for your support,
Democratic Victory
