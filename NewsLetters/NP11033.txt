Dear Friends,
With the healthcare enrollment deadline only 3 days away, I wanted to send an important message to you about the Affordable Care Act&rsquo;s premium tax credits and survivors of domestic violence.
Survivors of domestic violence face a unique barrier when attempting to qualify for tax credits that will lower their monthly premiums while searching for a healthcare plan in the new marketplace. Current regulations state that married taxpayers who do not file a joint return are ineligible for premium tax credits. However, it&rsquo;s common for survivors of domestic violence to file taxes separately from their spouses to protect themselves from the ongoing threat of abuse. This has posed a significant problem for these individuals, as many are now living on one income, and should qualify for healthcare premium assistance.
In response to a letter that I signed with 76 of my colleagues to Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew, the Department of Treasury and the IRS released new guidelines that permit these separated individuals to claim a premium tax credit for 2014, while filing a tax return with a filing status of &ldquo;Married Filing Separately&rdquo;.
In addition, although the deadline to enroll is coming up on March 31st, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has allowed marketplaces to establish a special enrollment period for such individuals so that they will have sufficient time to select a qualified plan through the marketplace. For our healthcare marketplace here in California (known as Covered California),
the special enrollment period for survivors of domestic violence will last until May 31st . To clarify, the special enrollment period is
only
for survivors of domestic violence.
All other applicants only have until March 31st to enroll.
For guidance on how domestic violence survivors can claim a premium tax credit for 2014 when filing separately from their spouse, please see the release
here . For any other questions about these new guidelines, please contact my district office at (650) 342-0300.
All the best,
