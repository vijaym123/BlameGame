Dear Friend, Next week will mark five months since America's new Congress took office. While there is still much work to do, my colleagues and I in the People's House have been getting things done for the American people, working together to pass bills to help spur economic growth, and tackling many other pressing challenges facing our country.
Each bill that we have passed and sent to President Obama's desk is an example of how we have been governing based on your priorities, including:
The first real entitlement reform
in nearly two decades New mental health resources
to help
prevent veteran suicides Ensuring oversight of any nuclear deal
with Iran Giving Medicare patients and their doctors more certainty
by
permanently eliminating the so-called "doc fix" New tools for law enforcement
to fight
human trafficking New reforms
to protect law enforcement
officers and their families The House and the Senate have also agreed to
the first joint 10-year balanced budget since 2001 , which does not require the president's signature.
On top of all this, the House has also made progress in a number of other areas on behalf of the American people, passing such commonsense initiatives as: A strong national defense bill
that authorizes a much-deserved raise for our troops Protecting and expanding 529 college savings plans
that millions of
hardworking families
rely on to put money away for school, and
stopping the president's reckless plan
to tax these savings accounts Providing more certainty in the tax code and paving the way for stronger growth by
repealing the death tax Reining in red tape by
holding bureaucrats accountable
for the cost of new rules,
giving small businesses a voice
in the regulatory process, and
fighting the Obama administration's
harmful "Waters of the US" rule Increasing
VA accountability
and
making it easier for small businesses to hire veterans A bipartisan bill to
build the Keystone pipeline
and create 40,000 new American jobs
Powerful reforms to
stop IRS abuse Compassionate legislation to
protect unborn children ...and much more!
As always, to learn more about the bills I'm working on and why they're important,

Presents 3rd District Community Champion Award to Yvonne Clark of New Castle
Rep. Kelly with Yvonne Clark, Director of Walker's Neighborhood House in Lawrence County
On Wednesday, Rep. Kelly presented the
3rd District Community Champion Award
for the second quarter of 2015 to Yvonne Clark, Director of Walker's Neighborhood House in Lawrence County, at St. John United Holy Church in New Castle, PA.
Excerpts of
Rep. Kelly's official commendation
for Mrs. Clark:
"Yvonne, the Director of Walker's Neighborhood House in Lawrence County, has served both her family and community with excellence, leaving a legacy of compassion and integrity behind her that has impacted many.
...
"In 1979, Yvonne enrolled in the Pittsburgh Beauty Academy in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania and graduated with honors shortly thereafter. Under the mentorship of a respected and accomplished local salon-owner, Yvonne learned the skills of the trade and eventually opened her own salon in 1984. When health issues demanded a change of course, Yvonne worked as a family service worker and then a job coach before returning to school at Midwestern Baptist School of Ministry. Again, she graduated with honors and received her Associate's Degree in Women's Ministry in 2006. Additionally, valuing her role as mother and grandmother, Yvonne became the primary caregiver for her three grandchildren when her daughter was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.
"It was around this time that Walker's Neighborhood House, a division of the Gussie M. Walker Community Outreach Organization, was established. The mission of this after-school program is to empower youth and families to be the best they can be by obtaining a better education, while also learning that through God all things are possible. By providing both tutoring and structured recreational opportunities for local youth in an area where 85% of the population is considered low-income, Walker's Neighborhood House is breathing life back into a community and empowering our next generation of leaders. Under Yvonne's devoted and impassioned leadership, over 2,500 students have walked through its doors and left changed for the better.
"Whether serving her family or her community, Yvonne has shown herself to be a leader in the truest sense of the word and a role model for the many that are privileged to know her. Furthermore, her dedication to directing the St. John United Holy Church Choir for thirty-five years and being a member of the praise team for fifteen gives evidence to the core Christian values that have informed her experiences and given strength when strength was needed along her journey. On behalf of many, I would like to express sincere gratitude and appreciation to Mrs. Yvonne Clark, a true Community Champion."
