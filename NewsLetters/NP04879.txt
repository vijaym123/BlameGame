Here's what I believe:
There is nothing more pressing in our time than confronting and solving the climate crisis.
We have no time to spare. We must act now. Luckily, we have all the tools we need to solve this challenge. All we need is political will -- but political will is a renewable resource!
That's why the election on November 4th is so monumentally important. President Obama is now leading on this issue -- but we need to elect more Democrats dedicated to putting the future of our planet before the interests of Big Oil and Coal and other large carbon polluters who demand the right to use our atmosphere as an open sewer without any accountability.
And right now, that means we need to support Democratic candidates facing Koch-funded attacks. There are only a few days left to make a difference in this election. Can you chip in whatever you can today?
Will you step up?
