FY16 spending requests submitted to Appropriations Committee - Representatives of U.S. territories are sometimes referred to as non-voting Delegates. That is not true of caucus voting, when leadership and committee heads are elected by every caucus member, whether they represent people living in a state or in a territory. Non-voting is also inaccurate when the Appropriations Committee canvases all Members of the House of Representatives each year for their views on which federal programs should be funded and at what funding level. Delegates votes count. And that vote is important for your representative to have, because each year the Commonwealth government and individuals and organizations in the Northern Mariana Islands receive millions of dollars appropriated by Congress. Last week, your congressional office wrapped up the work of making our recommendations to appropriators on 220 programs, important to the people of the NMI, for fiscal year 2016 funding. See the complete list here . We also submitted 15 recommendations for legislative language to be included in the FY16 spending laws, ranging from instructions that could lead to completion of the Kagman watershed project to requirements that will help justify increasing reimbursement rates for school meals served in the Northern Marianas.

Pacific Air Forces Brigadier General Steven Basham, Marine Forces Pacific Executive Director Craig Whelden, and staff
briefed the Saipan district office this week on the CNMI Joint Military Training Draft Environmental Impact Statement. The Draft EIS released today assesses the potential effects of the proposed actions to develop live-fire military training areas on Tinian and Pagan. The National Environmental Policy Act provides the public with opportunities to provide input on the militarys proposal. A 60 day public comment period is now open until June 2, 2015. Details on the proposed action and the associated EIS process, methods to submit comments, and a schedule of public meetings to be held on Tinian and Saipan are available at http:// www.cnmijointmilitarytrainingeis.com/ .
$1,000,000 for home visiting this year, funding continues for another two years - We reported on two-year extensions of funding for community health centers and the Childrens Health Insurance Program, CHIP, when the House passed H.R. 2 on March 26. Also of note in the bill is another two years of funding for the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program. The Northern Mariana Islands was awarded $1,000,000
for this important program on February 19. Funding will continue at that level through fiscal year 2017, if, when it returns to work on April 13, the Senate also approves H.R. 2. Programs that send nurses, social workers, or other specially trained helpers to visit first-time mothers in their homes and teach parenting skills, advise on nutrition, and provide information on education have proven to result in children who are healthier and more school-ready. (See, for instance, Effect of Home Visiting by Nurses on Maternal and Child Mortality .) The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program is one part of President Obamas Early Learning Initiative.
