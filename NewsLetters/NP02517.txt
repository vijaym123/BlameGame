Dear Friend,
As a key supporter, I want to keep you
updated on the goings-on on the Hill and set a
strategy of how we can be most helpful to my
former colleagues grappling with issues in the
House.
When I made the difficult decision to retire
from Congress, I knew that I wanted to continue
to work on issues that are important to
American families. The issue at the top
of that list now is comprehensive tax
reform.
As you likely know, Congressman Paul Ryan
was selected to serve as the new chairman of
the House Ways and Means Committee. Paul
and I have worked closely together in the past
and in these opening weeks of the new Congress,
hes already made it clear that he
intends to keep the fight for comprehensive tax
reform as the focus of his immediate work.
In fact, in some of the reading Ive
been doing on this issue, I came across a
Reuters report that says Congressman Ryan
believes Congress must get tax reform done by
the end of the summer
you can read the
complete article
here
. And
The Hill
also published an article that says he
"will take an aggressive approach to build
support for a tax reform overhaul by the August
recess."
I know personally the battle hes
facing , because we are dealing with an
Obama Administration that does not want
comprehensive tax reform.
I believe this
Barrons
article is on point, as it reports that
Republicans fully intend to produce a tax
reform bill for President Obama to sign.
The challenge will be to convince the President
to sign the tax reform legislation. And
thats a challenge we are meeting head on
through our work at CAMPAC. Im
counting on your support to get the job
done. More updates coming soon.
Thanks!
Dave Camp,
Chairman, CAMPAC
P.S.
If you havent signed our petition
--
Comprehensive Tax Reform Now
please do so today.
I want to let
Paul Ryan know we are behind him 100%.
Join us in fighting for real tax
reform.
