Wyoming Energys Newest Market: India
Dear Friends,
A few weeks ago I went to Madison Square Garden in New York to welcome Mr. Narendra Modi, newly elected Prime Minister of India, on his first official visit to the U.S.
I had met with Mr. Modi previously in early 2013 in the Gujarat Province of India where he was the Chief Minister (the equivalent of a state governor in the United States). While in Gujarat I saw firsthand how he had transformed the province with a focus on higher education, jobs, and the economy.
In order to make Prime Minister Modis transformation possible across the whole of India, the country will need reliable energy resources, like those we have in abundance in Wyoming.
Our own government here in the United States is taking actions to harm important Wyoming industries, including coal and uranium.
Now it is time for Wyoming to look to additional and welcoming energy markets, and India may be ripe for the picking.
As I continue to work for Wyoming, please dont hesitate to
