In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, rescue workers found two intersecting beams in the shape of a cross in the wreckage at Ground Zero.
In 2011, the cross was moved to the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum, and following a lawsuit in 2013, a federal judge ruled that the crosss presence in the 9/11 Museum did not violate the Establishment Clause of the Constitution.
