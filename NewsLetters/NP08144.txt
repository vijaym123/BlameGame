Environmental
Protection Agency overreaching, hurting Idahoans
During
the month of June, Senator Risch, other Senate colleagues and I took
necessary action against what is becoming a long list of Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) overreaches. These latest abuses include a
proposed sweeping federal regulation mandating existing power plants
nationwide reduce carbon emissions 30 percent by 2030. The Administrations
proposals threaten to undermine an important sector of our economy
and the industries and jobs it supports and will ultimately result in
significant increased energy costs for Idahoans. To learn earn more
about the proposed rule, click

In
addition, the EPA is proposing a rule revising the definition of
waters of the United States under the federal Clean Water Act (CWA). Under
the revision, the EPA is attempting to regulate virtually every body
of water in the country. The proposal is a blatant attempt to exert
authority over water outside the scope of the CWA, and represents an
assault on private property rights, state sovereignty and puts Idahoans
family farms in jeopardy. For more information, click
here.
In response to these blatant federal
overreaches, my colleagues on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee,
of which I am a member, expressed concern with the regulations
potential impacts on electricity providers, jobs and the economy.
Additionally, Senator Risch and I introduced legislation that would
prohibit the EPA from finalizing the proposed Definition of the Waters of
the United States Under the Clean Water Act.
Idahoans
are rightfully concerned about the EPAs excessive, heavy-handed
regulations and the impacts in our state. I share these concerns. This
alarming trend is not limited to our nations environment and water
issues.
Whether it is the Internal Revenue Service targeting
organizations based on political beliefs or the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau collecting and storing data on consumers financial transactions,
I have opposed and continue to fight these unnecessary overreaches and
intrusions into the lives of ordinary citizens.
Reining in the
federal government and preserving the way of life we enjoy in Idaho
and across the West remains one of my highest priorities in
Congress.
Remembering
D-Day

June is also a month when Americans proudly
remember and honor the tremendous sacrifice of our armed forces. This
year, June 6 th
marked the 70 th
anniversary of
D-Day, when American soldiers stormed the beaches of Normandy and forever
changed the course of history.
Taking steps to
address VA issues
I joined 44 of my Senate
colleagues, including Idaho Senator Jim Risch, in co-sponsoring bipartisan
legislation.
This legislation, S. 2450, the Veterans Access to Care
Through Choice, Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014, was
introduced by Senators Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) and John McCain
(R-Arizona) and seeks to end lengthy waits for veterans seeking medical care by
expanding veterans access to private treatment.
The
legislation, which the Senate recently passed by a vote of 933, also improves
the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) accountability by
allowing VA leadership to more easily fire underperforming
employees.
This measure establishes long overdue policies needed to improve
the agencys treatment of our nations heroes.
Rural Idahoans
will finally be able to seek local care rather than traveling more than
40 miles to seek health services from the VA. S.2450 provides a number
of other important improvements:
Allows veterans
to seek private treatment if faced with long wait times at VA
facilities;
Expands the VA Secretarys ability to terminate or
demote employees for poor performance;
Allows for the
hiring of additional doctors and nurses;
Establishes two
independent commissions to review and monitor veterans access to care
and VA construction projects;
Extends counseling and
treatment to service members who suffered sexual trauma while serving
on inactive duty training;
Requires the VA to report on
prevalence of domestic violence in the veteran
population.
Our nation must support those men and women who have risked
their lives to protect our country in the past and who continue to do so
today.
I remain dedicated to efforts to provide affordable and
quality health care to such individuals during their retirement years;
this commitment needs to be upheld.
We are blessed in Idaho to
have many veterans in our communities who continue to lead through the
example of extraordinary service.
Ensuring they receive quality
health care is a part of the way our nation must honor their
service.
In Case You Missed
It:
Immigration
This week, Senator Risch and I, along
with 39 Senate colleagues, called on the Administration to take
immediate steps to stem the flow of the thousands of unaccompanied children
crossing the southern border into the U.S. illegally. The
current crisis at our border is a direct consequence of the Administrations
dangerous, piecemeal approach to reforming our broken immigration
system. The President must send a clear signal to those seeking to enter
the country illegally that the U.S. will uphold our immigration laws
to the fullest extent. To read more,

I
was honored to present Theresa Hart of Post Falls with the Spirit of
Idaho Award during a ceremony in Coeur dAlene for her willingness to
go above and beyond to lend a helping hand to Idahos servicemen and
women. Hart tragically lost her son, Nick Newby, to an I.E.D explosion
in Iraq in 2007. Since then, she has founded a service program named
in her sons honor. Newby-Ginnings assists active military, veterans
and Gold Star families with whatever they can. The organization has
supplied dozens of military families with everything from new appliances
to clothing, even money for gas. Theresas spirit of service and
ultimate decision to transform a tragedy into meaningful service is truly
inspiring.
I am always proud to have the opportunity to spend
time with Idahoans like Theresa who embody the spirit of our great
state.
It is always fun to talk with new interns and learn
about their ambitions. I was able to do that this month with the
summer interns in my Washington, D.C., office. Idaho can be proud of
them!
It is
always a privilege to present Congressional Award Gold Medals to Idaho
students. Congratulations to Matthew of Caldwell, Devon of Ketchum and
Cynthia of Shelley!
It was an honor to sit down with Alex Assante and his
mother, Christina. Alex is a talented young man, who was in Washington
as a participant in the National History Day Competition. Alex
certainly represented our great state and Idaho Falls well in the nations
capital.
