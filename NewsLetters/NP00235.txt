Blaine's Bulletin
We take the stars from heaven, the red from our mother country, separating it by white stripes, thus showing that we have separated from her, and the white stripes shall go down to posterity representing Liberty.
President George Washington
Our United States flag was first authorized by the Second Continental Congress on June 14, 1777. This date is now observed as Flag Day throughout our nation, and, on it, we pause to recognize, remember, and give honor to one of our countrys most enduring symbols.
To me, the flag represents a living example of what it means to be an American. Our flag serves as an inspiration to our nations veterans, those currently defending our country, and all Americans who proudly stand tall and raise their hands over their hearts when they recite the Pledge of Allegiance or sing the Star Spangled Banner.
Many of our fellow Americans have made courageous sacrifices to preserve all that our national flag represents. And June 14 serves as a day to remember our loyalty to our great nation and reaffirm our belief in liberty and justice. Across the nation, there will be ceremonies, parades, and services held in communities for all to pay respect to the nations flag.
One service my office offers is the flag program in which residents of the 3 rd
District can request a flag that has been flown over the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. Each year my office receives dozens of requests from Eagle Scouts, veterans, businesses, and families that would like flags to use for ceremonies, display inside, or fly outside. Each flag flown over the Capitol comes with a commemorative certificate identifying the date on which it was flown and the occasion for doing so.
The price of each flag depends on size and material. For more information or to place an order, please call any of my offices or visit my website.
Flag Day exists because the American spirit exists, and I encourage you to take a moment and reflect on what this symbol means to you and to those who defend our country.
