Driving A Stake Into the Heart of Sex Trafficking
Congressman Nolan with sex trafficking survivors and members of the
human rights organization Rights4Girls
during an event last week to stop domestic sex trafficking in America.
Dear Friend,
Child sex trafficking is nothing short of 21st-century slavery, and
last week I joined Senator Amy Klobuchar and other Democrats and
Republicans in both the House and Senate to drive a stake into the
heart of it.
At any one time, some 300,000 American children are in danger of being
trafficked and sold for sex, according to the U.S. Department of
Justice.
In fact, as we were announcing H.R.3530, the Justice For Victims of
Trafficking Act, last Wednesday, and hearing from two trafficking
survivors at another event earlier that day, the Star Tribune was in
the midst of a powerful 4-part series
featuring one young trafficking victim
from our own 8th District community of Two Harbors.
H.R.3530 would give federal prosecutors new powers to go after
traffickers and trafficking operations, and put additional teeth into
penalties for human trafficking-related offenses. The bill would also
create a federal fund to help rescue and restore the lives of the young
people caught up in this terrible web of criminal exploitation.
We want to be clear. Girls who are lured by traffickers, then raped,
beaten, and forced into submission, are not criminals. They are
victims. And they are entitled to the same legal support, healing,
counseling, education, and shelter as other rape victims. And full
protection under laws governing child abuse.
I will keep you informed as we continue to pursue tougher, more
effective trafficking laws to target criminals and protect our precious
children.
Sincerely,
_____
We Still Need More Jobs, But White House Says Economy's Looking Better
I heard good news on the economy last Thursday during a high-level
briefing with White House officials in the West Wing. According to the
White House Council of Economic Advisers, we've had 44 straight months
of private job growth, adding 7.8 million jobs. Hourly wages are up by
1.3% and people are building more houses than they were in 2012 - great
news for our 8th district construction and building trades. More good
news: unemployment in Minnesota has dropped to 4.8%, its lowest since
December 2007, according to the Department of Employment and Economic
Development. That said, there are still thousands of people in MN and
millions across our nation who need good-paying, permanent jobs, and we
need to double down on our efforts to rebuilt and reinvest in America,
and continue to generate good made-in-America jobs for everyone who
wants and needs one.
True American Heroes: Honoring Our Wartime Code Talkers
With Lex Porter's family at the Congressional Medal event. Lex Porter
was a Code Talker during the Korean Conflict and a member of the Grand
Portage Band of Chippewa, one of the tribes of Minnesota's 8th District.
As members of our U.S. Armed Forces, Native American Code Talkers
fooled our wartime enemies by using their native languages in radio
communications, playing an incredibly important role in America's
ultimate victories. We recognized these true American heroes in a
special Congressional Medal event in the Capitol, where members of the
Fond du Lac, Mille Lacs, and Grand Portage Bands of Chippewa were
honored for their service in WWII and the Korean Conflict. Chairwoman
Karen Diver accepted the Gold Award on behalf of Fond du Lac, and Lex
Porter of Grand Portage - whose family was there in his memory -
received a posthumous Congressional Silver Medal for his service. I'm
deeply grateful I was able to witness our country finally award these
heroes the recognition they so rightfully deserve.
Great Lakes Cargo and Invasive Species Are Top Priorities as WRRDA
Negotiations Begin Wednesday marked the opening session of the
House-Senate Conference Committee on the Water Resources Reform &
Development Act (WRRDA), set to work out differences between the House
and the Senate bills. I'm proud to represent Minnesota as one of the
Democrats selected by Leadership to this distinguished panel;
increasing cargo capacity through the Port of Duluth and the Great
Lakes through dredging, and stopping Asian Carp and other invasive
species from escaping into our northern Minnesota lakes and waterways
top my list of priorities. I'll keep you informed as we continue
negotiations over the coming weeks.
Coffee & Conversation With Our Minnesota Delegation
The Minnesota Delegation met Wednesday to chat about the ongoing Farm
Bill and WRRDA negotiations
Even when there's gridlock in D.C., the folks in Minnesota know how to
work together to solve problems and get things done. We like to get
together every so often to chat informally about the issues we're each
working on, and in particular how it will affect the hard-working
citizens of our great state of Minnesota (the hardest part, as you may
imagine, is trying to coordinate all of our schedules). We met on
Wednesday to discuss the latest on Farm Bill and WRRDA - since we have
members on both of these important conference committees.
Farm Bill Negotiations Are "Tough" and "Slow" In a nutshell, that's
what I reported to members of the Minnesota Farm Bureau and the
Minnesota Farmers Union at meetings late last week in the Twin Cities.
After consulting with our Minnesota conferees, Agriculture Committee
Ranking Member Collin Peterson, Congressman Tim Walz, and Senator Amy
Klobuchar, it's clear that reconciling differences between the House
and the Senate bills - particularly with respect to cuts in the SNAP
nutrition program - will be difficult at best. The key question is: can
we keep the farm and nutrition pieces of the bill together in order to
preserve the bipartisan urban-rural coalition historically necessary to
pass a Farm Bill? I remain optimistic that common sense can replace
partisanship and politics so Congress can finally agree on a five-year
Farm Bill. We will keep you posted.
_____
Briefly...
Last week I:
.
Signed on as an original cosponsor of the bipartisan "Our
Daughters Are Not For Sale" Resolution, H.Con.Res.66, asserting that
children trafficked in the United States be treated as victims of
crime, and not as perpetrators.
.
Cosponsored the Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act
(H.R.2504), to strengthen access to home health services under
Medicare. The bill will allow advanced practice registered nurses
(APRNs), including nurse practitioners (NPs), clinical nurse
specialists (CNSs), certified nurse midwives (CNMs), as well as
physician assistants (PAs), to order home health services under
Medicare in accordance with state law.
.
Joined 46 Republicans and Democrats in urging the House and
Senate Budget Committees to prioritize funding for the Payment in Lieu
of Taxes (PILT) program for fiscal year 2014. Congress has not yet
approved funding for FY2014, a delay causing much concern for counties
now formulating their upcoming budgets. Without congressional action,
counties will be forced to implement budget contingency plans, probably
including cuts to critical local government services.
.
Introduced the Grand Portage Band Per Capita Adjustment Act
(H.R.3608), a bill to provide equal treatment of certain per capita
income payments for members of the Grand Portage Band of Lake Superior
Chippewa. This bill is a critical step forward in restoring a small
piece of the tribal trust relationship.
.
Cosponsored the Veterinary Medicine Mobility Act (H.R.1528),
allowing veterinarians to transport and dispense medicine to animal
patients outside the walls of their practice. This change is especially
important for rural communities.

Coming Up in Minnesota
.
Today I met with MNDOT officials for a tour of the proposed
reconstruction and redesign of the Highway 371 corridor, just north of
Brainerd.
.
On Tuesday I'll meet with Rear Admiral Fred Midgette of the
Ninth Coast Guard District, which spans the entire Great Lakes from
Lake of the Woods in Minnesota to the eastern end of the St. Lawrence
Seaway. We plan to discuss the Water Resources bill (WRRDA) and a wide
range of matters important to commerce and navigation through the Great
Lakes system.
.
Also on Tuesday I'll host a Labor Round Table with labor
leaders from throughout northeastern Minnesota. We'll be talking about
jobs and economic development, as well as issues facing the working men
and women of our 8th District.
.
I'll be touring the U.S. Postal Service sorting facility in
Duluth, which the USPS has been considering closing. The closure would
mean the loss of jobs to the Duluth community and the delay of mail
delivery to all of northern Minnesota.
.
Attention Grand Rapids and Bovey: Congress is coming to you
on Tuesday, November 26th. My staff will be in Grand Rapids in the
morning and in Bovey in the afternoon, and they are looking forward to
answering your questions, hearing your views on issues of the day,
and/or helping you with an issue you may be having with a federal
program such as Social Security or veterans benefits. Just visit my
website for details: nolan.house.gov/congress-comes-to-you-schedule

Finally...
The Monday Report will return on Monday, December 9th. Until then,
enjoy this special time with your family and friends.

Report
from
Representative
Rick
Nolan
Driving
A
Stake
Into
the
Heart
of
Sex
Trafficking
Congressman
Nolan
with
sex trafficking
survivors
and members
of
the
human
rights
organization
Rights4Girls
during
an
event
last
week
to
stop
domestic
sex
trafficking
in
America.
Dear
Friend,
Child
sex
trafficking
is
nothing
short
of
21st-century
slavery,
and
last
week
I
joined
Senator
Amy
Klobuchar
and
other
Democrats
and
Republicans
in
both
the
House
and
Senate
to
drive
a
stake
into
the
heart
of
it.
At
any
one
time,
some
300,000
American
children
are
in
danger
of
being
trafficked
and
sold
for
sex ,
according
to
the
U.S.
Department
of
Justice.
In
fact,
as
we
were
announcing
H.R.3530,
the
Justice
For
Victims
of
Trafficking
Act,
last
Wednesday,
and
hearing
from
two
trafficking
survivors
at
another
event
earlier
that
day,
the
Star
Tribune
was
in
the
midst
of
a
powerful
4-part
series
featuring
one
young
trafficking
victim
from
our
own
8th
District
community
of
Two
Harbors.
H.R.3530
would
give
federal
prosecutors
new
powers
to
go
after
traffickers
and
trafficking
operations ,
and
put
additional
teeth
into
penalties
for
human
trafficking-related
offenses.
The
bill
would
also
create
a
federal
fund
to
help
rescue
and
restore
the
lives
of
the
young
people
caught
up
in
this
terrible
web
of
criminal
exploitation.
We
want
to
be
clear.
Girls
who
are
lured
by
traffickers,
then
raped,
beaten,
and
forced
into
submission,
are
not
criminals.
They
are
victims.
And
they
are
entitled
to
the
same
legal
support,
healing,
counseling,
education,
and
shelter
as
other
rape
victims.
And
full
protection
under
laws
governing
child
abuse.
I
will
keep
you
informed
as
we
continue
to
pursue
tougher,
more
effective
trafficking
laws
to
target
criminals
and
protect
our
precious
children.
Sincerely,
We
Still
Need
More
Jobs,
But White
House
Says
Economy's
Looking
Better
I
heard
good
news
on
the
economy
last
Thursday
during
a
high-level
briefing
with
White
House
officials
in
the
West
Wing.
According
to
the
White
House
Council
of Economic
Advisers,
we've
had
44
straight
months
of
private
job
growth,
adding
7.8
million
jobs.
Hourly
wages
are
up
by
1.3%
and
people
are
building
more
houses
than
they
were
in
2012
-
great
news
for
our
8th
district
construction
and
building
trades.
More
good
news:
unemployment
in
Minnesota
has
dropped
to
4.8%,
its
lowest
since
December
2007,
according
to
the
Department
of
Employment
and
Economic
Development.
That
said,
there
are
still
thousands
of
people
in
MN
and
millions
across
our
nation
who
need
good-paying,
permanent
jobs,
and
we
need
to
double
down
on
our
efforts
to
rebuilt
and
reinvest
in
America ,
and
continue
to
generate
good
made-in-America
jobs
for
everyone
who
wants
and
needs
one.
True
American
Heroes:
Honoring
Our
Wartime
Code
Talkers
With
Lex
Porter&#8217;s
family
at
the
Congressional
Medal
event.
Lex
Porter
was
a
Code
Talker
during
the
Korean
Conflict
and
a
member
of
the
Grand
Portage
Band
of
Chippewa,
one
of
the
tribes
of
Minnesota's
8th
District.
As
members
of
our
U.S.
Armed
Forces,
Native
American
Code
Talkers
fooled
our
wartime
enemies
by
using
their
native
languages
in
radio
communications ,
playing
an
incredibly
important
role
in
America's
ultimate
victories.
We
recognized
these
true
American
heroes
in
a
special
Congressional
Medal
event
in
the
Capitol,
where
members
of
the
Fond
du
Lac,
Mille
Lacs,
and
Grand
Portage
Bands
of
Chippewa
were
honored
for
their
service
in
WWII
and
the
Korean
Conflict.
Chairwoman
Karen
Diver
accepted
the
Gold
Award
on
behalf
of
Fond
du
Lac,
and
Lex
Porter
of
Grand
Portage
-
whose
family
was
there
in
his
memory
-
received
a
posthumous
Congressional
Silver
Medal
for
his
service.
I'm
deeply
grateful
I
was
able
to
witness
our
country
finally
award
these
heroes
the
recognition
they
so
rightfully
deserve.
Great
Lakes
Cargo
and
Invasive
Species
Are
Top Priorities as
WRRDA
Negotiations
Begin
Wednesday
marked
the
opening
session
of
the
House-Senate
Conference
Committee
on
the
Water
Resources
Reform
&amp;
Development
Act
(WRRDA),
set
to
work
out
differences
between
the
House
and
the
Senate
bills.
I'm
proud
to
represent
Minnesota
as one
of
the Democrats selected
by Leadership
to this
distinguished
panel;
increasing
cargo
capacity
through
the
Port
of
Duluth
and
the
Great
Lakes
through
dredging,
and
stopping
Asian
Carp
and
other
invasive
species
from
escaping
into
our
northern
Minnesota
lakes
and
waterways
top
my
list
of
priorities.
I'll
keep
you
informed
as
we
continue
negotiations
over
the
coming
weeks.
Coffee
&amp;
Conversation
With
Our
Minnesota
Delegation
The
Minnesota
Delegation
met
Wednesday
to
chat
about
the
ongoing
Farm
Bill
and
WRRDA
negotiations
Even
when
there&#8217;s
gridlock
in
D.C.,
the
folks
in
Minnesota
know
how
to
work
together
to
solve
problems
and
get
things
done . We like
to
get
together
every
so
often
to
chat
informally
about
the
issues
we're each
working
on,
and
in
particular
how
it
will affect
the
hard-working
citizens
of
our
great
state
of
Minnesota (the hardest
part,
as
you
may
imagine,
is
trying
to
coordinate
all
of
our
schedules).
We
met
on
Wednesday
to
discuss
the
latest
on
Farm
Bill
and
WRRDA
-
since
we
have
members
on
both
of
these
important
conference
committees.
Farm Bill
Negotiations
Are
"Tough"
and
"Slow"
In
a
nutshell,
that's
what
I
reported
to
members
of
the
Minnesota
Farm
Bureau
and
the
Minnesota
Farmers
Union
at
meetings
late
last
week
in
the
Twin
Cities.
After
consulting
with
our
Minnesota
conferees,
Agriculture
Committee
Ranking
Member
Collin
Peterson,
Congressman
Tim
Walz,
and
Senator
Amy
Klobuchar,
it's
clear
that
reconciling
differences
between
the
House
and
the
Senate
bills
-
particularly
with
respect
to
cuts
in
the
SNAP
nutrition
program
-
will
be
difficult
at
best.
The
key
question
is:
can
we
keep
the
farm
and
nutrition
pieces
of
the
bill
together
in
order
to
preserve
the
bipartisan
urban-rural
coalition
historically
necessary
to
pass
a
Farm
Bill?
I
remain
optimistic
that
common
sense
can
replace
partisanship
and
politics
so
Congress
can
finally
agree
on
a
five-year
Farm
Bill.
We
will
keep
you
posted.
Briefly...
Last
week
I:
&#8226;
Signed
on
as
an
original
cosponsor
of
the
bipartisan
"Our
Daughters
Are
Not
For
Sale"
Resolution ,
H.Con.Res.66,
asserting
that
children
trafficked
in
the
United
States
be
treated
as
victims
of
crime ,
and
not
as
perpetrators.
&#8226;
Cosponsored
the
Home
Health
Care
Planning
Improvement
Act
(H.R.2504),
to
strengthen
access
to
home
health
services
under
Medicare.
The
bill
will
allow
advanced
practice
registered
nurses
(APRNs),
including
nurse
practitioners
(NPs),
clinical
nurse
specialists
(CNSs),
certified
nurse
midwives
(CNMs),
as
well
as
physician
assistants
(PAs),
to
order
home
health
services
under
Medicare
in
accordance
with
state
law.
&#8226;
Joined
46
Republicans
and
Democrats
in
urging
the
House
and
Senate
Budget
Committees
to
prioritize
funding
for
the
Payment
in
Lieu
of
Taxes
(PILT)
program
for
fiscal
year
2014.
Congress
has
not
yet
approved
funding
for FY2014,
a
delay
causing
much
concern
for
counties
now
formulating
their
upcoming
budgets.
Without
congressional
action,
counties
will
be
forced
to
implement
budget
contingency
plans,
probably
including
cuts
to
critical
local
government
services.
&#8226;
Introduced
the
Grand
Portage
Band
Per
Capita
Adjustment
Act
(H.R.3608),
a
bill
to
provide
equal
treatment
of
certain
per
capita
income
payments
for
members
of
the
Grand
Portage
Band
of
Lake
Superior
Chippewa.
This
bill
is
a
critical
step
forward
in
restoring
a
small
piece
of
the
tribal
trust
relationship.
&#8226;
Cosponsored
the
Veterinary
Medicine
Mobility
Act
(H.R.1528),
allowing
veterinarians
to
transport
and
dispense
medicine
to
animal
patients
outside
the
walls
of
their
practice.
This
change
is
especially
important
for rural
communities.
Coming
Up
in
Minnesota
&#8226;
Today
I
met
with
MNDOT
officials
for
a
tour
of
the
proposed
reconstruction
and
redesign
of
the
Highway
371
corridor ,
just
north
of
Brainerd.
&#8226;
On
Tuesday
I'll
meet
with
Rear
Admiral
Fred
Midgette
of
the
Ninth
Coast
Guard
District ,
which
spans
the
entire
Great
Lakes
from
Lake
of
the
Woods
in
Minnesota
to
the
eastern
end
of
the
St.
Lawrence
Seaway.
We
plan
to
discuss
the
Water
Resources
bill
(WRRDA)
and
a
wide
range
of
matters
important
to
commerce
and
navigation
through
the
Great
Lakes
system.
&#8226;
Also
on
Tuesday
I'll
host
a
Labor
Round
Table
with
labor
leaders
from
throughout
northeastern
Minnesota.
We'll
be
talking
about
jobs
and
economic
development,
as
well
as
issues
facing
the
working
men
and
women
of
our
8th
District.
&#8226;
I'll
be
touring
the
U.S.
Postal
Service
sorting
facility
in
Duluth ,
which
the
USPS
has
been
considering
closing.
The
closure
would
mean
the
loss
of
jobs
to
the
Duluth
community
and
the
delay
of
mail
delivery
to
all
of
northern
Minnesota.
&#8226;
