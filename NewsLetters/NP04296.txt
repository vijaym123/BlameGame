As we head into the holiday season and winter weather, I wanted to pass along these helpful tips and resources for staying safe during the colder weather and winter storms that will soon be headed our way. Make sure you keep a charged cell phone with you, make a note to check on elderly or disabled neighbors, and consider the following tips and resources:
Cold weather puts an extra strain on the heart.
If you have heart disease or high blood pressure, follow your doctors advice about shoveling snow or performing other hard work in the cold.
Extreme cold weather precautions:

Frozen pipes occur most frequently in areas with temperate climates where pipes are more likely to be exposed or under insulated.
Running water, even at a trickle, helps prevent pipes from freezing. Preventing and thawing frozen pipes:

Winterize your home by insulating walls and attics, caulking and weather-stripping doors and windows. In addition, if you use woodstoves or fireplaces to heat your home, remember to have them professionally serviced and cleaned.
Bring pets inside, if possible, and move other animals to sheltered areas with access to non-frozen drinking water.
Protecting pets during cold weather:

Have an emergency kit prepared with supplies such as an alternate fuel source for heating your home, flashlights and batteries in your home and car, blankets, food that needs no cooking or refrigeration, a 3 day supply of water, prescription medicines, snow shovel etc.
