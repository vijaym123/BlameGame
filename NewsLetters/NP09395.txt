VISITING DC
May 26, 2014
As we celebrate Memorial Day, let us
take a moment to remember the true meaning of the holiday: to honor
those service members who have sacrificed for our nation. Upon entry to
the United States military, these brave men and women take an oath to
protect and defend the Constitution, our country, and our freedom,
even if it means paying the ultimate price.
For those who pay this
price, we express our deepest
gratitude.
Let us also remember the families who were left
behind
they paid dearly for our freedom as well.
Remember to honor
them just as we would those who have fought on the front lines.
Because of their sacrifice, we owe them the support and care they
deserve.
As I spend time reflecting on the great sacrifice
our fallen soldiers have made, I think of a recent trip I took with
members of the Committee on Veterans Affairs. We
visited eight overseas American cemeteries as part of a Congressional
Delegation. The American Battle Monuments Commission uniquely serves our
country by acting as the guardian of Americas overseas cemeteries and
memorials that honor the service and sacrifice of our military. The
Commission maintains these cemeteries and memorials by caring for the
landscape, gravesite upkeep, and visitor center restoration; more
importantly, it acts as a liaison and storyteller between the cemeteries
rich history and the public. Guides are passionate about their
positions and understand the importance of keeping the stories alive. They
ensure that even though these brave men and women are gone, they are
never forgotten.
During the visit, a wreath was laid at each cemetery
honoring those who gave their lives for our freedom. We also had
the privilege of visiting the gravesites of men
and women
from our home state.
At Lorraine American Cemetery in
France, I visited the graves of Major George Preddy and First
Lieutenant William
Preddy, two
brothers from Greensboro, North Carolina.
The Preddy brothers were
both pilots with the U.S. Army Air Forces and fought in World War II,
flying P-51 Mustangs. The Preddy brothers both died while serving their
country and are buried alongside one another.
While visiting Florence American
Cemetery in Italy, I also had the honor to learn of Technician 4th Class
Harry B. Morgan from Charlotte, North Carolina. Morgan was an Army still
photographer assigned to the 3131st Signal Service; he and other
members of his unit are mentioned in the book, The Last Farewell, Army
Sgt. Edmund Burke OConnells final farewell to post-war Italy. On
November 12, 1944, Morgan was wounded in action and later
died.
Every headstone has a story; these are just two of the
many inspiring tales told by the docents with the
American Battle Monuments Commission.
If you ever have a chance to go
overseas, I highly recommend researching and visiting one of the
memorials or cemeteries, witness their humbling beauty, and speak with
those who tell the stories first hand. Most importantly, honor the men
and women, buried abroad and at home, for their
sacrifice.
This Memorial Day, let us remember all of those who
fought in our nations wars and gave their lives for us. Without their
service, the America we know would not exist. Without their sacrifice, we
would not live in a country where we may live and speak freely without
fear of punishment.
To the men and women who died for our
freedom, and to their families, thank you and God bless
you.
Sincerely,
Richard
Burr
