We&rsquo;re running out of time -- so we won&rsquo;t waste any:
Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s Super PAC attack ads hit the Chicago airwaves TOMORROW. If he outspends us right now -- just 22 days before the election -- the damage could be irreversible.
We just checked: we need 500 donations in the next 24 hours to respond to Boehner&rsquo;s attacks. So David, if you were planning to chip in for Brad&rsquo;s progressive campaign, it&rsquo;s critical you do so immediately.
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks,
