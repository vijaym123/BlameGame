It was 226 years ago, on
December 7, 1787,that a
group of 30 elected delegates
met at the Golden Fleece
Tavern in Dover to decide the
future of Delaware and our
nation. On that day,
Delawareans made the
unanimous decision to ratify
the U.S. Constitution and
officially become the First
State of our new nation.
Today, from Wilmington to
Georgetown and everywhere in
between, Delawareans continue
to work together to find
ways, regardless of political
party, to build bridges
across partisan divisions to
find a path forward and do
whats best for our
state and Delawareans.
Its a tradition
started all those long years
ago that I like to refer to
as the "Delaware Way".
In Washington, we strive
to live up to the ideals
enshrined in the
Constitution, but lately we
havent done such a
great job. I remain
determined toto work
together with my colleagues
on both sides of the aisle to
communicate and compromise
and, I hope, bring a bit more
of Delaware to our
nations capital.
Happy Delaware Day,
