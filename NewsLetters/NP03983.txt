With the cold of winter settling in, many people in
Southwest Missouri turn to wood stoves to heat their homes.
The
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is targeting wood burning stoves with a
regulation that lacks commonsense and threatens
jobs.
The EPAs New Source Performance Standards proposal affecting wood
stoves takes a harsh, technology forcing approach which will
eventually render 85 percent of wood burning stoves sold in the U.S.
illegal.
The EPA expects to finalize this new rule in February
2015.
In April, I questioned EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy on
this proposal and expressed my frustration with how impractical the
proposal is, especially for folks in Southwest Missouri.
Southwest
Missourians turn to burning wood to heat their homes because wood is
readily available, often cheap, and reliable.
I
support the
Wood Stove Regulatory Relief Act
that prohibits the
EPA from implementing or enforcing any new standards for an eight year
period as they relate to wood burning stoves.
This
latest proposal from the EPA has the potential to cause job losses in the
manufacturing sector.
Last month, I signed on to a bipartisan,
bicameral letter to Administrator McCarthy requesting a longer
compliance timeline for their New Source Performance Standards for warm air
furnaces.
Warm air furnaces are forced-air, wood-fired furnaces
Americans are using to heat their homes.
The EPAs proposed rule
would prohibit the manufacture or sale of any non-certified warm air
furnace within 60 days of the final rule being published in the Federal
Register.
Manufacturers would have 60 days to completely change
their operations when it comes to producing warm air furnaces.
At the same time, because the rule prohibits the sale of non-certified
models, manufacturers may have to re-purchase the stock that retail
stores have already purchased.
These manufacturers are often
small companies; for many of them the rule will create an insurmountable
financial burden, forcing many out of business.
This would be
needless and when EPA first regulated wood stoves in the 1980s, it
allowed a longer compliance timeline that helped the industry adjust.
In the letter, we asked for at least a year for manufacturers to be
compliant with this rule.
The EPA should not
make it harder for families to heat their homes with wood stoves and ban
the production of Americas current wood burning stoves.
The
EPA needs to bring commonsense to its proposals.
Taking away a
heating source folks in Southwest Missouri use and threatening jobs makes
no sense at all.
