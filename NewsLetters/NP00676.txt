Friends,
On the first Memorial Day (then-called Decoration Day)
in 1868, 5,000 Americans gathered in Arlington National Cemetery to
decorate the graves of 20,000 Union and Confederate soldiers.
Today, nearly the same number of Americans gather at Arlington National
to honor our fallen soldiers from every warRevolutionary to
Iraq.
As we gather with family and friends this Memorial Day
Weekend, I want to share with you this brief video,
Honor Thy
Fallen: A Memorial Day Tribute , produced by SGT Rodney Roldan about the
history of Memorial Day.
I encourage you to take a moment to
watch this moving tribute and share it with your loved ones.
The rolling hills of
Arlington National Cemetery serve as a constant reminder that
many
brave Americans
sacrificed their lives for our freedom.
While we can never repay their debt, we can commemorate their legacy
and ensure that our children and grandchildren understand the true
price of freedom.
Tomorrow, at 3:00 p.m. our nation will pause
to observe the National Moment of Remembrance, a moment of silence to
recognize the sacrifices of our fallen troops.
I also encourage
you to participate in one of the many Memorial Day parades and marches
across our community.
I will join Seventh District
Veterans and members of the Myrtle Beach Combat Veterans Motorcycle
Association chapter in their Memorial Day March at 9:00 a.m. on Ocean
Boulevard.
After the march ends at the Pavilion site on 9th Avenue
North, there will be a brief commemorative ceremony. For more details
about this event, please click
HERE .
Tonight at 8:00 p.m. is the National Memorial
Day Concert on the West Lawn of the United States Capitol.
The
concert will be broadcast live on PBS.

It is an honor and privilege to serve you, our military
families, and our nations veterans.
God
Bless our Troops and God Bless America!
