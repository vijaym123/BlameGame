Rep. Bob Goodlatte
House Acts to Defund Executive Actions on Immigration
It&rsquo;s
fitting that one of the first actions taken by the House of Representatives this year was a
reading of the United States Constitution . As Members from both
sides of the aisle read sections of our governing document, it was a reminder of the carefully balanced separation of powers outlined by our
Founders.
President Obama's rewriting of our nation&rsquo;s immigration
laws ignore the will of the American people, threaten the separation of powers between Congress and the Executive branch, and violate the
President&rsquo;s obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.
In
response to these unconstitutional actions, the House approved the
Department of
Homeland Security Appropriations bill this week, which
funds enforcement of our immigration laws and processing of visa
applications. As Chairman of
the House Judiciary Committee, I worked
closely with other Members to draft five amendments to the bill that
would
defund and end
the President&rsquo;s executive amnesty programs.
Here are
three things you need to know
about the House Homeland bill.
If
President Obama&rsquo;s
unilateral immigration amendments are not stopped,
future presidents will continue to expand the power of the Executive
Branch and encroach upon
individual liberty. Our fight against the
President&rsquo;s actions is not yet over. In the coming days and weeks, I
will work with my colleagues in
the Senate to get a bill to the
President&rsquo;s desk. We cannot let one man nullify the law of the land with
the stroke of his pen.

Goodlatte Urges House to Stop President's Executive
Overreach
Curbing Excessive Federal
Regulations
The effects of excessive government regulation are real for the American people. Today, Americans face a burden of over $3
trillion from federal taxation and regulation. The regulatory burden for each American household adds up to $15,000 &ndash; funds that could instead
be used on housing, education, or groceries. Every month, hardworking Americans witness the government digging deeper and deeper into their
pocketbooks with the results being lower wages, fewer jobs, and a less competitive America.
On Tuesday, the
House of Representatives
passed my bill
- the
Regulatory
Accountability Act
- to reform the Executive Branch and lessen the burden of overreaching federal regulation. This bill is a strong, bipartisan
solution to the problem of overreaching, ill-considered, and excessively costly federal regulation. It requires the Executive Branch to execute the
laws passed by Congress in the least costly way, and with better public input, to find the most efficient regulatory solutions that benefit all
Americans. I applaud the House for passing this real and permanent regulatory reform for the American people.
