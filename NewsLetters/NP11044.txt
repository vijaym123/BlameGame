Dear Friend,
This week, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in two cases of
business owners challenging the mandate in the President's health law
that employees be provided abortion-inducing drugs. Hobby Lobby, a
family-owned craft store business, and Conestoga Wood, a
Mennonite-owned woodworking company, believe their First Amendment
right to religious freedom is being violated by the government mandate.
On the eve of this historic case, I led many of my House colleagues in
a Special Order, in support of our Constitutional right to religious
freedom. I shared what I called "A Tale of Two Garages; the American
Dream; and how the Government is Jeopardizing it." The first is the
story of David and Barbara Green who, in the early 1970s, borrowed $600
and began making picture frames in their garage in Oklahoma. From those
humble beginnings came success with the Hobby Lobby chain that has
blossomed into 556 stores in 41 states, with 70 more scheduled to open
this year. And they hire 16,000 full-time employees. The second story
is that of Norman and Elizabeth Hahn in Pennsylvania. They began a
small business in their garage in the 1960s, selling doors and wood
components for kitchen cabinets. That small business, known as
Conestoga Wood, is now a leader in wholesale wood products for kitchen
cabinets, with five locations in three states.
Both the Greens and the Hahns are people of faith who believe abortion
ends a life. They do not want the government to force them to pay for
something they find morally objectionable, or to choose between staying
in business and following their religious beliefs. But the sad fact is
that employers offering health care coverage without abortion-inducing
drugs face fines of up to $36,500 per employee each year for failure to
comply with the government edict - an unconscionable price to have to
pay for following one's religious beliefs. Where are the
Administration's priorities in this unjust scheme? From a
Constitutional perspective the government mandate clearly tramples on
America's deeply held tradition of respecting the freedom of
conscience.
These businesses and others across the country want to provide their
employees with quality health coverage, but do not want to be forced to
choose between following their faith and submitting to an intrusive
government mandate. No one is stopping any employees from obtaining
abortion-inducing drugs on their own. The Greens and Hahns are simply
saying they should not be forced by the government to aid in the
abortion process by providing these drugs. Their position makes good
sense and it upholds America's Constitutional rights and freedoms. I
eagerly look forward to the Supreme Court decision, which expected in
June. I pray they uphold our most fundamental right.
On another matter, the House took another step this week to rein in the
unilateral power of the White House by approving the Ensuring Public
Involvement in the Creation of National Monuments Act, H.R. 1459. This
would require public participation before a presidentially-declared
National Monument is made official by changing the 1906 Antiquities
Act, which allows Presidents to unilaterally designate National
Monuments without any input or involvement of the American public,
community leaders, or elected officials. It was intended to be used in
emergencies to protect historic artifacts and sites of scientific value
from imminent threat. But it has been misused for political purposes,
specifically to restrict access to vast areas of America's public lands.
The House bill would guarantee the American people an opportunity to
take part in these important decisions, while preventing the inclusion
of private property in monument declarations without the prior approval
and written consent of property owners. This legislation addresses the
issue of Presidential overreach by ensuring that Presidents -
regardless of political party - make decisions of this kind out in the
open. America benefits when the secrecy of government actions is
replaced with transparency. I urge the Senate to take up this common
sense legislation and act on behalf of the American people by quickly
passing it.
Have a great week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler

Dear
Friend,
This
week,
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
heard
oral
arguments
in
two
cases
of
business
owners
challenging
the
mandate
in
the
President&#8217;s
health
law
that
employees
be
provided
abortion-inducing
drugs.
Hobby
Lobby,
a
family-owned
craft
store
business,
and
Conestoga
Wood,
a
Mennonite-owned
woodworking
company,
believe
their
First
Amendment
right
to
religious
freedom
is
being
violated
by
the
government
mandate.
On
the
eve
of
this
historic
case,
I
led
many
of
my
House
colleagues
in
a
Special
Order,
in
support
of
our
Constitutional
right
to
religious
freedom.
I
shared
what
I
called
&#8220;A
Tale
of
Two
Garages;
the
American
Dream;
and
how
the
Government
is
Jeopardizing
it.&#8221;
The
first
is
the
story
of
David
and
Barbara
Green
who,
in
the
early
1970s,
borrowed
$600
and
began
making
picture
frames
in
their
garage
in
Oklahoma.
From
those
humble
beginnings
came
success
with
the
Hobby
Lobby
chain
that
has
blossomed
into
556
stores
in
41
states,
with
70
more
scheduled
to
open
this
year.
And
they
hire
16,000
full-time
employees.
The
second
story
is
that
of
Norman
and
Elizabeth
Hahn
in
Pennsylvania.
They
began
a
small
business
in
their
garage
in
the
1960s,
selling
doors
and
wood
components
for
kitchen
cabinets.
That
small
business,
known
as
Conestoga
Wood,
is
now
a
leader
in
wholesale
wood
products
for
kitchen
cabinets,
with
five
locations
in
three
states.
Both
the
Greens
and
the
Hahns
are
people
of
faith
who
believe
abortion
ends
a
life.
They
do
not
want
the
government
to
force
them
to
pay
for
something
they
find
morally
objectionable,
or
to
choose
between
staying
in
business
and
following
their
religious
beliefs.
But
the
sad
fact
is
that
employers
offering
health
care
coverage
without
abortion-inducing
drugs
face
fines
of
up
to
$36,500
per
employee
each
year
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
government
edict
&#8211;
an
unconscionable
price
to
have
to
pay
for
following
one&#8217;s
religious
beliefs.
Where
are
the
Administration&#8217;s
priorities
in
this
unjust
scheme?
From
a
Constitutional
perspective
the
government
mandate
clearly
tramples
on
America&#8217;s
deeply
held
tradition
of
respecting
the
freedom
of
conscience.
These
businesses
and
others
across
the
country
want
to
provide
their
employees
with
quality
health
coverage,
but
do
not
want
to
be
forced
to
choose
between
following
their
faith
and
submitting
to
an
intrusive
government
mandate.
No
one
is
stopping
any
employees
from
obtaining
abortion-inducing
drugs
on
their
own.
The
Greens
and
Hahns
are
simply
saying
they
should
not
be
forced
by
the
government
to
aid
in
the
abortion
process
by
providing
these
drugs.
Their
position
makes
good
sense
and
it
upholds
America&#8217;s
Constitutional
rights
and
freedoms.
I
eagerly
look
forward
to
the
Supreme
Court
decision,
which
expected
in
June.
I
pray
they
uphold
our
most
fundamental
right.
On
another
matter,
the
House
took
another
step
this
week
to
rein
in
the
unilateral
power
of
the
White
House
by
approving
the
Ensuring
Public
Involvement
in
the
Creation
of
National
Monuments
Act ,
H.R.
1459.
This
would
require
public
participation
before
a
presidentially-declared
National
Monument
is
made
official
by
changing
the
1906
Antiquities
Act,
which
allows
Presidents
to
unilaterally
designate
National
Monuments
without
any
input
or
involvement
of
the
American
public,
community
leaders,
or
elected
officials.
It
was
intended
to
be
used
in
emergencies
to
protect
historic
artifacts
and
sites
of
scientific
value
from
imminent
threat.
But
it
has
been
misused
for
political
purposes,
specifically
to
restrict
access
to
vast
areas
of
America&#8217;s
public
lands.
The
House
bill
would
guarantee
the
American
people
an
opportunity
to
take
part
in
these
important
decisions,
while
preventing
the
inclusion
of
private
property
in
monument
declarations
without
the
prior
approval
and
written
consent
of
property
owners.
This
legislation
addresses
the
issue
of
Presidential
overreach
by
ensuring
that
Presidents
&#8211;
regardless
of
political
party
&#8211;
make
decisions
of
this
kind
out
in
the
open.
America
benefits
when
the
secrecy
of
government
actions
is
replaced
with
transparency.
I
urge
the
Senate
to
take
up
this
common
sense
legislation
and
act
on
behalf
of
the
American
people
by
quickly
passing
it.
Have
a
great
week.
