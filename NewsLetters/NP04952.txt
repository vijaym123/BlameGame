Friend --
Nate Silver writes,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s remarkable how many [Senate] races have remained competitive.&rdquo;
(That&rsquo;s due to YOUR support -- thank you!!)
And
USA Today
reports, &ldquo;Losing in this climate would shake the [Republican] party, its base and its donors to the core.&rdquo; We&rsquo;re so close to DEVASTATING their hopes and OUSTING McConnell from office!
But here&rsquo;s the troubling part: If we can&rsquo;t fully fund our Last Weekend Get Out The Vote Push, we risk losing it all at the last second. We have until the deadline in 48 hours -- and as of right now, we&rsquo;re still $1,700,803 short.
Friend, we need your help and we need it now. Will you contribute to make our Last Weekend GOTV Push VICTORIOUS? The deadline is just 48 hours away -- so we&rsquo;re triple-matching all gifts!
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
A vigorous last weekend Get Out The Vote push can -- WILL -- make the difference for Democrats. We have an incredibly ambitious plan to knock on 1.5 MILLION doors and call 2 MILLION voters, leading to an overwhelming presence at the polls.
But none of it can happen without you.
We know we&#39;re asking a lot -- but we really need EVERY DEMOCRATIC SUPPORTER to step up right now.
Please, contribute now so we can mobilize hundreds of thousands of voters in our last weekend push! We&rsquo;ll TRIPLE-MATCH your gift -- so it will have FOUR TIMES the effect!
Thank you for everything,
