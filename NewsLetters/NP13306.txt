Robert's
Round-Up: Reflecting Back on 2013 and
Looking Toward the Year Ahead
Dear Friend,
Since coming to Congress, my top
priority has been promoting job growth. As
we look back at 2013 and we begin the New
Year and the second session of the 113th
Congress, I am encouraged by the progress
my colleagues in the House and I have made
in this effort. We have approved numerous
pieces of legislation aimed at rejuvenating
our economy, and it is my hope that many of
these will continue to move through the
legislative process as we return in
January.
This year, we have focused on expanding
energy independence, eliminating
job-hampering red tape and regulations, and
saving our economy from the job-crushing
burden of debt. In June, the House approved
the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act (H.R.
2231), which opens areas of the country
rich in resources, like the coast of
Virginia, to new offshore energy
production, creating jobs and providing
much-needed energy to revitalize
manufacturing. H.R. 367, the Regulations
from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny
(REINS) Act, also passed the House this
year. The REINS Act reforms the federal
regulatory process that stands in the way
of private sector job creation by requiring
a vote in Congress on any new major
regulation costing our economy $100 million
or more.
Also, two job-creating bills that I
introduced passed the House with wide
bipartisan support: The Small Business
Capital Access and Job Preservation Act
(H.R. 1105) and the Audit Integrity and Job
Protection Act (H.R. 1564). Both of these
pieces of legislation seek to protect our
small businesses and the vital jobs they
create from costly, inefficient, and
unnecessary Washington red tape.
Unfortunately, a common thread ties all
these and many other House-passed proposals
together - they are stalled in the U.S.
Senate. I am disappointed that our
colleagues in the Senate are stifling the
good work we in the House have put forth to
improve our economy and the lives of the
American people. As we look toward the New
Year, it is my hope that we are able to
come together in a bicameral, bipartisan
way to make progress on these and many
other important pieces of legislation
passed by the House.
I look forward to working with my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle and
both sides of the Capitol in 2014 to bring
true spending reform to our country,
promote policies that will bring
good-paying jobs to our communities,
protect Americans from the damaging effects
of the President's health care law, and
guarantee a brighter future for all
Virginians and Americans.
