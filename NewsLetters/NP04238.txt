Dear Friend,
Thursday,
the President laid out his unilateral, unconstitutional executive action
on immigration and I wanted to share my thoughts with
you.
I believe it is an abuse of power and shows arrogance to do something
by executive order that the President himself admitted is a
legislative issue. If he had announced he was sending these ideas as a bill to
the Congress for its consideration, it would have been seriously
reviewed and acted upon. However, by deciding to issue an executive order,
President Obama is thumbing his nose at the Constitution, the
Congress, and the American people. This Administration should be working with
Congress for sensible immigration reform instead of working against
the will of the American people by taking extreme
steps.
Voters sent the message that they want cooperation in Washington, not
unilateral action. Our immigration system has flaws and they need
permanent solutions, but what the President outlined is a short term political
fix. Our immigrants deserve concrete policies that become law after
thorough, transparent discussion.
I will join my
colleagues in considering every legislative tool granted by the Constitution to
stop this executive overreach and use the legislative process to work
the will of the American people.
What do you think? Tell
me by answering the poll to the right, visiting my

I appreciate the opportunity to communicate with you and hear what
you have to say.
Have a Happy and Blessed Thanksgiving
Week!
Joe
