Every election is an opportunity to shape our future.
This November, we have a clear choice -- and a chance. It&rsquo;s a chance to elect Democrats to Congress who will fight for us every day. It&rsquo;s a chance to elect leaders who believe that our economy and our democracy should work for everyone.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m writing you. My friends at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) are pulling out all the stops to help us seize this chance. But they need our help.
It&rsquo;s going to take all hands on deck to get this done.
