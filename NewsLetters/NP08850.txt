Dear Friend,
As always, the best laid plans are known to go awry. While we were
preparing for the tele town-hall, I was called to the Capitol to vote
on the Transportation Housing and Urban Development Appropriations
Bill, which means we unfortunately have to cancel our call tonight. One
thing I learned very quickly in Washington is that votes always seem to
fall during the most important part of my day!
We're looking forward to holding another tele town-hall in the future -
hopefully with more luck.
Thanks for your interest, and I'll talk to
you soon.
All my best,
Congressman Joe Kennedy
