Dear
David,
This Saturday, November 23, 2013, I will be hosting
a Holiday Season Scam Stoppers Town Hall Meeting in the City of
Ontario.
With the holiday season fast approaching, millions of
Americans are spending their hard-earned money to celebrate the
spirit of giving with loved ones and friends.
The season also brings
out thieves and scammers who take advantage of unsuspecting consumers
that are eager to find the best deals on holiday gifts.
My goal
as a representative is to help constituents avoid the most common
scams during this time.
I have invited officials from the
Federal Trade Commission and the Ontario Police Department to provide a
community briefing and answer questions on how consumers can protect
themselves from the most typical scams committed during the holidays. I
encourage all constituents to attend.
The details of the town
hall meeting are:
Who:
Congresswoman Gloria Negrete McLeod in cooperation with the Federal Trade
Commission and the Ontario Police Department
What:
