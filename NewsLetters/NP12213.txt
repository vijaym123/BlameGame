Dear Friend,
San Antonio is home to some of the brightest young people in our
country. Our students win robotics competitions, excel in literary
contests, and take top honors at national cyber defense competitions.
Every time I meet with students in San Antonio or when they're visiting
Washington, their intelligence, drive, and vision for their futures are
inspiring. Which is why increasing their opportunities is crucial to
finding their paths and careers.
By supporting our students, we are able to become increasingly globally
competitive and create a thriving workforce with low to highly skilled
workers. And it all starts with opportunity. Here is how I'm working to
engage our youth through the arts and academics.
Engaging students in the 20thCongressional District
This spring, my office is sponsoring two competitions through the House
of Representatives for high school students that live in or attend
school in the 20th Congressional District of Texas.
Both events are
exciting opportunities to nurture our students' creativity and showcase
the talent of San Antonio's high school students.
Congressional Art Competition: The Congressional Art Competition-An
Artistic Discovery is an opportunity to recognize the artistic talent
in our district.
*	This year's theme: What San Antonio Means to Me is meant to
invoke the rich sights, sounds, and flavors that make San Antonio one
of America's most unique cities.
*	The winning artist will join me in Washington, DC for a special
reception and will have their art displayed in the U.S. Capitol for one
year.
*	Art Submission Deadline: April 28, 2014
House STEM Competition:
This year kicks off the first ever
Congressional Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) Academic
Competition, the "House App Contest."
*	Students are challenged to create a software application or
"app"
*	Apps can run on a platform of their choice including mobile,
tablet, or computer devices
*	The winning student will have their app displayed on the House
of Representatives website and in the U.S. Capitol for a year.
*	App Submission Deadline: April 30, 2014
The arts is an important cornerstone to our community, including in San
Antonio's myriad museums and art appreciation festivals, not to mention
the beautiful art in downtown San Antonio that enriches our culture and
cements our Texas roots. The historical Congressional Art Competition
is their chance to be a part of the art community. Additionally, we see
our kids on their phones downloading the latest apps; this is their
opportunity to create their own.
District Report on Constituent Services
As your representative in Washington, my job is to be your voice and I
take great pride in helping my constituents solve problems they are
having with the federal government. From issues with veteran's
benefits, Social Security payments, passports, or housing, my office
will do our best to help you if you're having trouble receiving the
answers you need or the federal benefits you've earned. My office may
be able to help resolve your issue or get you the information you need.
So far this year, my office has worked with hundreds of folks to
provide assistance with federal agencies such as the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA), United States Citizenship and Immigration
Services(USCIS), and Social Security Administration.
We've recovered
more than $1.3 million, over $92,400 of that since January alone, owed
to folks from agencies, some who have been waiting years to have their
cases resolved.
I am looking forward to highlighting and celebrating the imaginative
minds and talents of students in the 20th Congressional district with
my colleagues and the public up in Washington.
For more information on
both events, please visit my website at castro.house.gov. If you need
assistance with an issue with a federal agency, please contact my
office in San Antonio.
We're here to help you.
Sincerely,
Joaquin Castro
