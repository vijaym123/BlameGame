Dear Friends,
This week,
I was pleased to invite high school students across California's
45th Congressional Distric t to participate in the 2015
Congressional Art Competition.
Last year's winning piece of artwork from California's 45th
Congressional District. Titled: Urban Journey Home by
Hyojin
Im
Each year, the U.S.
Congress hosts a nationwide art competition to encourage and recognize the
artistic talent of our nation's youth. Thousands of high school
students participate, and one student from each district will be chosen as
the winning artist to represent his or her district. The winning
student from Californias 45 th
Congressional District will be
invited to attend a national reception in Washington, D.C. and will have
his or her artwork displayed in the U.S. Capitol for an entire
year.
Please encourage your children, or those you
know in grades 9-12 to take advantage of this unique opportunity. My
office will be accepting artwork entries until
Friday,
April 24th.
For more information on the competition rules and
guidelines, please visit

Meetings in Washington, D.C.
It was an honor to be presented with the
official Army seal by
Col. David Hamilton. I will proudly display this
in my
office!
It was great to meet
with MIT Graduate students from Orange County, California in the
office this
week.
Meeting with the Cystic
Fibrosis Foundation, thank you for taking the time to come by the
office.
In Case You Missed It: Rep. Mimi Walters on Fox
News
This week, I joined Joel Walman with
Fox News to discuss my experience as a freshman member of Congress,
and how I hope to encourage more women to run for public
office.

News
I
grew up in a time where a lot of women stayed home, and took care of
their kids, and they weren't out in the workforce - I happened to do
both. A lot of young women today dont really think that they can do it.
I want to be able to show them, especially with the fact that I have
two girls, that if they want to work outside the home, they can work
outside the home. If they want to stay home with their kids, they can
stay home with their kids. If they want to do both, they can do both. If
they want to run for office, they can do it. If they want to be
President of the United States, they can do it.
I think its a matter
of showing them, I did it, and that if I can do it, they certainly
can do it.

Trauma Systems Legislation
This week, I was
pleased to support the passage of H.R. 647, the Access to Life-Saving
Trauma Care for All Americans Act, and H.R. 648, the Trauma Systems
and Regionalization of Emergency Care Reauthorization Act. These vital
pieces of legislation will reauthorize financial support to trauma
centers, work to prevent trauma center closures, and address certain
shortfalls in trauma services. These bills help to fund a number of trauma
centers in Southern California, including the UCI Regional Burn
Center.
Protecting Volunteer Firefighters
from Obamacare
The House
unanimously passed this week legislation to protect volunteer firefighters and
emergency responders from being included as full-time employees under
Obamacare. If volunteer fire companies were required to comply with the
employer mandate, they would be liable for skyrocketing new health
care costs which would force many to cut down volunteer hours or worse
yet, close their doors. The House passed this legislation by a vote of
415 to 0, and it now awaits consideration by the U.S.
Senate.
I will continue to fight to protect the
American people from the President's misguided health care law and work to
replace it with common-sense, free-market policies that will empower
patients when it comes to making their healthcare
decisions.
The Week
Ahead
Next week, the House will consider the House Republican's
Budget for Fiscal Year 2016 as well as legislation to repeal and replace
the Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR), commonly known as the "doc
fix."
Warmest
Regards,
Mimi
