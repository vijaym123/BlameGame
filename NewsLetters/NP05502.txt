Elizabeth Warren emailed yesterday, and I&rsquo;m emailing today. It&rsquo;s because today is the single most important day of the whole election -- the FINAL FEC deadline hits at midnight.
Friend -- Elizabeth Warren emailed yesterday, and I&rsquo;m emailing today.
It&rsquo;s because today is the single most important day of the whole election
-- the FINAL FEC deadline hits at midnight. I&rsquo;m begging: If you read a single email today, please read this!
Here&rsquo;s where things stand:
Six races will decide control of the Senate&hellip; and they&rsquo;re all a dead heat.
Republicans only need to win three to take control.
That&rsquo;s 50-50 odds -- just plain scary! We CAN win, but
I need your help and I need it now.
Tonight is our LAST chance to fully fund the Get Out The Vote Campaign that will be crucial to our win.
Donate in the next 14 hours and we&rsquo;ll get our GOTV folks out in the field immediately. Triple-match ends at midnight!
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
We&rsquo;re just 20 days out -- an alarmingly short time. A leading pollster says, &ldquo;This election is still on a knife-edge,&rdquo; which means every single donation WILL make a difference.
Frankly, if we don&rsquo;t raise another $225,000 by midnight, I&rsquo;m worried that we&rsquo;ll falter, and the GOP will run away with our victory. But if you pitch in now, we&rsquo;ll be able to take the battle to them -- and leave them reeling from an electoral disaster on November 4.
Will you join me by midnight tonight? We&rsquo;ll triple-match your gift and send it right to must-win battleground states!
Thank you for everything,
Harry Reid
Senate Majority Leader
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
