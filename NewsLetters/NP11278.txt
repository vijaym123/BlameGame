Dear Neighbor,
Below is a brief update from the past two weeks.
As always, please continue to
write ,
call , and

your opinions to my office. I could not effectively represent you in Congress without the advice of my constituents. It is an honor and a privilege to serve you in Congress.

Returned $87,000 of 2013 Office Budget to Treasury
I have worked hard to ensure that every dollar counts and I have returned more than a quarter million taxpayer dollars to the Treasury throughout the past three years.
Holding the President Accountable
When President Obama took the oath of office, he vowed to uphold the Constitution and recognize that we are a nation of laws. Its unfortunate that we had to pass H.R. 4138, the
ENFORCE the Law Act of 2014
to hold him accountable to his oath.
SOCIAL MEDIA
Introduced Bill to Protect Seniors' Health Savings Accounts
This bill would allow anyone with a Health Savings Account (HSA) to
transfer the money they have saved
in their HSA during their working years to a Medicare Medical Savings Account (MMSA) upon turning 65 years old/becoming eligible for Medicare coverage.
I testified before the House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee and
shared a story from two constituents
who found out that they cannot keep the doctors they have been seeing for ten years because of the regulations of Obamacare.
