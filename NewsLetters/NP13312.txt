Benghazi in the Spotlight again:
Last week, the
New York
Times
published a story claiming no evidence of al Qaeda involvement in the
Benghazi attack, contradicting the collective bipartisan judgment of the House
Intelligence Committee.
This report only
reemphasizes the many questions left unanswered about what happened.
We will
not give up our pursuit for answers and accountability on Benghazi. Watch this
recent interview about what Congress must do to get answers on Benghazi:
This week in the House:
Although the Obamacare exchanges launched three months ago on October 1, we have little information about the exchanges or how many people have fully enrolled and paid for their coverage.
Americans deserve to know how their taxes are spent and if their personal data is at risk.
Yet:
The exchanges were not completely built by the launch date, and as a result,
HHS did not perform
an end-to-end Security Control Assessment of the website.
The chief information security officer
told congressional investigators she recommended the site was too vulnerable to go live, and since its launch there have been serious high-risk findings.
This week, the House will vote on two bills to
demand transparency from the Administration about the implementation of the exchanges and risks to personal information security . Read more about these bills to require transparent reporting about
enrollments
and
security risks .
