.) Well talk about the upcoming field hearing
on the crisis, which will be held on March 19 at 10:00 am at the Fresno City Council Chambers
Im looking forward to speaking there.
Another topic that may come up is this letter , which I signed along with six other California Congressmen, urging the Senate to hold a hearing on the House water bill. The Senate has introduced a water bill, which is a small miracle in itself, but until it passes a bill, Congress cannot act on the issue.
Separately, the Nunes Digest is updated for your weekend reading here .
