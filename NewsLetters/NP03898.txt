Dear Fellow
Nevadan,
Yesterday President Obama announced significant changes
to the economic and diplomatic relationship between the US and Cuba. I
support President Obamas decision for the United States to start a
new chapter in our relationship with Cuba. It begins with the return of
Alan Gross, who had been held captive for five years by the Cuban
government. I am so pleased Alan is home. I remain concerned about human
rights and political freedom inside Cuba, but I support moving forward
on a new path with Cuba.

Senate on behalf of Nevadans or to contact me, please visit
