Voted to Restore Cost-of-Living Adjustments to Military Retirees
Our Veterans have given their all to our country. When we originally passed the bipartisan budget agreement, I strongly opposed a provision in the bill that made changes to the retirement benefits of working-age military retirees. However, amendments to the bill were restricted so I cosponsored a separate bill to address this serious issue. Yesterday,
I was pleased to support a separate bill that provides Veterans the benefits they have earned and deserve . I hope that the Senate passes the same legislation.
