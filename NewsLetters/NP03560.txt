Equal Treatment for All Married Couples
Dear Friend,
In June 2013, we cheered together when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), but our work to ensure equal treatment for all married couples has not stopped there. This week, I was proud to join more than 40 of my Senate colleagues to reintroduce the Respect for Marriage Act &ndash; a bill to repeal the remaining sections of the discriminatory law and ensure all legally-married, same-sex couples are treated equally under federal law. Without this legislation, the Justice Department has concluded that married same-sex couples will continue to be denied critical federal benefits in certain states, including Social Security or veterans&rsquo; benefits.
I look forward to doing all I can to move this important legislation through the 114th Congress.
Sincerely,
Senator Tim Kaine
