The Federal
Reserve Must Be Transparent and
Accountable
Dear Friend,
The Federal Reserve System supervises
nearly all banking in the United States and
plays a substantial role in the domestic
and global economies. Since its creation in
1913, the Federal Reserves Board of
Governors has expanded its power, and its
role in monetary policy has gone relatively
unchecked. Given the impact that its
policies can have on our economy, the
Federal Reserve must be transparent and its
leaders must be held accountable to the
American people.
Enhancing the transparency of the
Federal Reserve will improve the
publics understanding of the
decisions the Federal Reserve Board makes,
which have a profound impact on the
American people and our economy. I am a
cosponsor of the Federal Reserve
Transparency Act, which would require a
full audit of the Board of Governors within
the Federal Reserve System and the Federal
Reserve banks by the Comptroller General of
the United States.
Until we can institute more transparent
policies for the Federal Reserve, we must
continue to provide rigorous congressional
oversight. Last Wednesday, Federal Reserve
Chair Janet Yellen testified before the
House Financial Services Committee hearing
entitled, Monetary Policy and the
State of the Economy.
I
appreciate Chair Yellen's testimony ,
particularly because I have serious
concerns about Federal Reserve policies
that make life more difficult for
hardworking Americans and
disproportionately diminish the ability of
Main Street banks to provide vital capital
in our rural communities.
I am particularly concerned by the
Dodd-Frank Acts negative impacts and
costs for community banks, small
businesses, and consumers.
A
newly released Harvard study
articulates how the Dodd-Frank Act has
actually given Wall Street an advantage
over Main Street - the exact opposite of
what its proponents said it would do. The
study found that since the enactment of
Dodd-Frank, community banks share of
the market has decreased due to the
pressure of increased regulation. This
means that community banks are providing
fewer mortgages to customers and fewer
loans to small businesses on our Main
Streets.
The studys findings represent the
impacts Fifth District Virginians have felt
for years now. Though the Dodd-Frank Act
was intended to rein in bad actors on Wall
Street, instead, we have seen that it is
disproportionately harming small Main
Street banks, credit unions, and their
customers by imposing one-size-fits-all
regulatory schemes on community financial
institutions. These regulatory impacts
represent real costs and eliminate choices
for consumers
both families and
small businesses
on Main Streets
from Chatham to Warrenton.
The Federal Reserve has an obligation to
tailor regulatory policy to account for the
differences between large multinational
institutions and smaller financial
institutions and the customers they serve.
During
the hearing, I pressed Chair Yellen
to
explain what the Federal Reserve is doing
to ensure that its system of regulation is
not unduly impacting small financial
institutions and dragging down our local
economies as a result.
I will continue to work with my
colleagues on the Financial Services
Committee to maintain robust congressional
oversight of the Federal Reserve, and I
remain committed to promoting policies that
will incentivize economic growth to provide
jobs and opportunities to all Fifth
District Virginians.
