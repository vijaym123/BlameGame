Friends,
On this day, in our nations towns large and small, we come together as Americans for reflection and remembrance.
We honor the fallen and those still missing today.
And we celebrate their lives and we embrace their families.
On D-Day, President Franklin D. Roosevelt prayed this prayer with the American people:
Some will never return. Embrace these, Father, and receive them, Thy heroic servants, into Thy kingdom.
And for us at home - fathers, mothers, children, wives, sisters, and brothers of brave men overseas - whose thoughts and prayers are ever with them - help us, Almighty God, to rededicate ourselves in renewed faith in Thee in this hour of great sacrifice.
I am reminded of the very special role our region has served in defense of our country, one marked with a disproportionate loss of life.
For the Gold Star families among us - those who lost a loved one in service to our country - every day is Memorial Day. Please join me in praying for these families, and thanking them for their service and sacrifice.
Mindful that I work for you, I remain,
Yours in Freedom,
