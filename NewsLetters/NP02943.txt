Dear Friends,
Weve
had a busy couple weeks here in our Nations Capital. Here is a quick
recap of some of things Ive
done:
1.
Voted to Repeal
Obamacare
Of all the laws passed in recent
years, I hear most about the destructive impact of Obamacare. Its
original intent was to make healthcare more accessible and affordable, but it
has done the exact opposite in Utah
increasing healthcare premiums,
and making doctors and plans less accessible. Im proud to have
voted to repeal Obamacare
this week in the House. It
now moves to the Senate. To watch the speech I gave about this
destructive law,

2.
Protected Utah grazing
rights
I was proud to introduce a new piece of legislation this
week that protects Utahs grazing rights. This bill, the
Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument Grazing Protection
Act , is designed to protect traditional and existing grazing access
on the monument. Read more about this bill,

3.
Visited the Utah State Legislature
I had a great trip to the Utah legislature last week
Washington could learn a thing or two from Utahs great legislative
body.
4.
Honored a
Utah Veteran on the House Floor
I was honored to recognize
Utah Veteran Billy Kirkbride
posthumously for his
service as an elite member of the 'Devil's Brigade' during World War II.
Kirkbirde was a member of the force that received a Congressional
Gold Medal in Washington, D.C. To watch the speech,
