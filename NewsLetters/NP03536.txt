Hello!
I'm pleased to send this email, as we begin the
114th Congress, inviting you to your Congressional office in the San
Fernando Valley. We've moved, and we want to make sure you know where
we're located, and what the office can do for
you.
Also, mark your calendars, I will be hosting my second annual
Grant Workshop for businesses in the San Fernando Valley on Thursday,
Jan. 29 at 10 a.m., at the North Hollywood Regional Library, 5211
Tujunga Ave. in North Hollywood. You can learn more about how to obtain
grant money from local, state and federal sources to improve area
non-profit organizations in the Valley.
I hope
you'll attend!
P.S. -- please let me know what you
want me to work on in Congress this session, just click on the survey
