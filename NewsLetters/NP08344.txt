Congressman Lamborn Fights to Lower Gas
Prices
6/26/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn
voted for H.R. 4899, the Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an
America That Works Act. This legislation, introduced by Congressman Lamborn,
Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings, and twelve other
Congressmen, would remove many of the barriers to domestic energy
production put in place by the Obama Administration. An increase in
American production will lead to lower energy costs for our friends and
neighbors. H.R. 4899 passed the House by a bipartisan vote of 229 to
185.
"Americans are
suffering needlessly due to the reckless energy policies of the Obama
Administration. As I chair my Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral
Resources, I see so many examples of ways that a more productive American
energy policy could have an enormously positive impact on our economy.
It is time to unleash our technologies and innovations to help
Americans struggling with high energy costs." - Congressman Doug Lamborn
(CO-05)
