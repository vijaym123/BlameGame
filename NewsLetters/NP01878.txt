Dear Friend,
Last weekend, I was honored to participate in the Bataan Memorial Death March at White Sands Missile Range. The memorial event is a challenging 26.2-mile march through the high desert terrain of White Sands Missile Range, conducted in honor of the heroic service members who defended the Philippine Islands during World War II who sacrificed their freedom, health and, in many cases, their lives.

It's a humbling experience to be part of this community-driven, annual event to honor and learn from the survivors of Bataan. It certainly is a physically challenging experience to participate in the march. But most of all, it's a way to come together to remember that few sacrifices are as selfless as those our military service men and women make in defense of this nation. We owe our veterans and their loved ones more than a debt of gratitude - we owe them action in both our words and deeds.
It is an honor to serve as your United States Senator.
Sincerely,
MARTIN HEINRICH
United States Senator
