Dear Friends,
For up-to-the-minute news from Washington and Arkansas, please follow
me on Facebook .
This week, I had a flashback to my days as a Senate Banking Committee staffer when former Senator Bill Proxmire (D-WI) handed out annual awards for the biggest waste of hard earned taxpayer dollars. I had a " Golden Fleece " moment when I saw KATV's report on the poorly managed
solar panel project
at the VA Hospital in Little Rock.
This story has proven to be equally frustrating for veterans and taxpayers and has highlighted the importance of continued oversight of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
Ensuring federal agencies that receive billions of dollars in taxpayer funds are responsibly using their resources is one of the most important functions of Congress. Over the years, it has become clear that there is no department more in need of congressional oversight than the one charged with providing timely access to hard earned care and benefits for a large portion of our Nations veterans.
Compounding the issue of the VAs frivolous spending on
programs they never even intended to use
is the fact that we are currently over $18 trillion in debt. Government resources and dollars are at a premium, and one of my priorities is seeing that every dollar spent is justified.
It goes without saying: an $8 million grant for solar panels that have never been turned on in over two years is not an appropriate use of taxpayers dollars.
I am committed to seeing we avoid similar failures in Little Rock or any other part of our country.
Our veterans, our taxpayers, and the many hardworking employees at VA deserve better.
Please let me know what you think about this misuse of taxpayer funds by commenting on my
Facebook page .
Sincerely,
Representative French Hill
