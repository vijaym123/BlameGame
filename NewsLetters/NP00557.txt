Boozman Bulletin: Improving the Economy
The Senate passed two crucial bills to grow our economy and create jobs
in Arkansas and across the country before adjourning for the Memorial
Day work period.
*	Trade Promotion Authority (TPA): TPA strengthens the voice of
Congress in trade deals and allows a more collaborative effort with the
executive branch in trade negotiations. Seeking opportunities for new
agreements in a quick and fair manner is important because the vast
majority of the worlds population lives outside of our borders. When
we trade our goods and services with other nations, our economy grows,
creating more jobs at home. Since agriculture is an integral part of
Arkansass economy, TPA will also help promote trade of goods produced
in the state. International trade already supports one in five jobs in
Arkansas
That number will continue to grow with more free and fair trade
agreements.
*	Highway Funding Bill: One of the keys to job creation and
economic growth is maintaining safe, secure and reliable infrastructure
across the nation. Congress passed this legislation to ensure that
funding for the highway projects currently underway in Arkansas
, and throughout the country, would not
lapse. While a long-term solution to this ongoing problem is ideal and
remains a priority for me, this short-term fix is crucial to Arkansas
and other states that rely on this money to improve roads and bridges.
I carried that message of economic security around Arkansas this week.
Getting our economy on track is an issue that unites Arkansas. I was
pleased to join other members of our states Congressional delegation
throughout the week to show Arkansans that we are committed to
improving our economy.
Lockheed Martin brought its Joint Light Tactical Vehicle to Little Rock
to showcase the vehicle it hopes to produce in East Camden. Alongside
Governor Asa Hutchinson, Senator Tom Cotton and Congressman Bruce
Westerman, I urged our state legislators to help make East Camden the
future home for this project, which will bring with it hundreds of
highly skilled, quality jobs. Securing a contract of this magnitude is
important for providing a solid economic foundation for the future of
our state, South Arkansas and the people who call this region home.
As Congress returns to Washington, the focus must remain on creating
jobs at home. We must continue to direct our energy toward creating
policies that preserve and promote an environment that is business
friendly, encourages productivity and innovation, supports educational
opportunities, and affords all Americans the opportunity to achieve
economic freedom.
_____
Quick Takes:
*	Fighting the Presidents Unconstitutional Immigration Action:
This week a federal appeals court rejected the Presidents appeal on
immigration
and continued to block the administration from
implementing its unconstitutional immigration policy. While news
reports indicate that the President wont ask the Supreme Court to
review this
, my colleagues and I are joining efforts against the
Presidents policy. Arkansas and 25 other states have challenged
President Obama's moves to ease deportations for immigrants living in
the country illegally. I recently joined more than 100 of my colleagues
in filing an amicus brief in support of a continued injunction
against President Obamas executive
overreach.
*	Reining in EPA Water Overreach: The Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) finalized a rule this week that puts Washington in our
backyards. The waters of the United States (WOTUS) is nothing more
than government overreach disguised as a policy to protect our nations
water
and eliminate the role of state protection. The
Senate needs to pass the Federal Water Quality Protection Act,
legislation I cosponsored that would protect our nations waters and
the rights of landowners
against an overly burdensome and costly regulatory
power-grab by Washington. This bill directs the EPA to revise its WOTUS
rule to exclude waters that have never been controlled by the federal
government like isolated ponds, ditches and agriculture water that lack
enough flow to carry pollutants to navigable waters.
*	Protecting Reliable and Affordable Energy: Congressman Rick
Crawford (AR-01) and I toured the Independence Steam Electric Station
in Newark
on Wednesday. This coal-fired plant is threatened
under EPAs carbon emissions plan that targets Arkansas for cuts
stricter than 44 other states and puts jobs in our state at risk. EPAs
proposal limiting carbon emissions threatens to increase energy prices
and reduce reliability. Thats why I recently joined Arkansas Senator
Tom Cotton and several of our colleagues to introduce the Affordable
Reliable Energy Now Act
to fight back against this proposal.
*	VA Inspector General to Review Solar Panel Activation Failure:
In my last e-newsletter I detailed an abuse of taxpayer dollars with
the failed activation of the Little Rock Veterans Affairs Medical
Centers (VAMC) solar panels. The VAs Office of Inspector General
notified Congressman French Hill (AR-02) and I that its adding this
location to its national project on VAs Green Management Program Solar
Panel Projects
after we asked for a review of the agencys
renewable energy program because of this problem.
*	Broadband Access: Access to affordable and reliable Internet is
vital in this modern age. According to the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC), 84 percent of rural Arkansas lacks access to
broadband. This is an important issue in our state. Thats why I asked
FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler when the current, antiquated rules would be
updated. The Chairman said he intends to implement reforms by football
season.
*	Giving Congress a Voice in Iran Negotiations: We have a
responsibility to ensure that Iran never achieves its goal of becoming
a nuclear power. Thats why the Senate overwhelmingly passed the Iran
Nuclear Agreement Review Act
. Without this bill, there will be no review of the
Iran deal. There would be nothing stopping President Obama from signing
a bad agreement with Iran. There would be no limitation on the
Presidents ability to waive sanctions and it would be much more
difficult for Congress to reinstate sanctions should Iran fail to live
up to its end of the bargain.
*	Critical Habitat Designation
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
announced its final critical habitat designations for the Neosho mucket
and rabbitsfoot mussels under the Endangered Species Act
(ESA) of
1973. While the agency trimmed its original designation I still have
concerns about the real economic cost
and will work with my colleagues to address this
overreach.
*	Fort Smith Airport Fire Protection Grant: The Federal Aviation
Agency (FAA) awarded the Fort Smith Regional Airport nearly $600,000
for firefighting equipment
. The funds will be used to buy a new fire truck and
four fire protection suits to assist the airport in meeting safety
requirements. This grant is important to the operation of the airport
and economic development in the community.
*	Supporting Economic Growth Policies: I was honored to receive
the U.S. Chamber of Commerces Spirit of Enterprise award for voting
for pro-jobs, pro-growth policies. I was appreciative of members of the
Hot Springs Chamber of Commerce for presenting me with this recognition
.
*	Operation Reboot: I had the opportunity to see how Arkansans
are supporting our veterans during a visit to Rogers-based Operation
Reboot. Watch my video
about this great program that helps veterans in their
transition to housing. As part of National Military Appreciation Month
I encourage you to honor the men and women who wore our nation's
uniform.

Boozman
Bulletin:
Improving
the
Economy
The
Senate
passed
two
crucial
bills
to
grow
our
economy
and
create
jobs
in
Arkansas
and
across
the
country
before
adjourning
for
the
Memorial
Day
work
period.
Trade
Promotion
Authority
(TPA):
TPA
strengthens
the
voice
of
Congress
in
trade
deals
and
allows
a
more
collaborative
effort
with
the
executive
branch
in
trade
negotiations.
Seeking
opportunities
for
new
agreements
in
a
quick
and
fair
manner
is
important
because
the
vast
majority
of
the
world&#146;s
population
lives
outside
of
our
borders.
When
we
trade
our
goods
and
services
with
other
nations,
our
economy
grows,
creating
more
jobs
at
home.
Since
agriculture
is
an
integral
part
of
Arkansas&#146;s
economy,
TPA
will
also
help
promote
trade
of
goods
produced
in
the
state.
International
trade
already
supports
one
in
five
jobs
in
Arkansas .
That
number
will
continue
to
grow
with
more
free
and
fair
trade
agreements.
Highway
Funding
Bill:
One
of
the
keys
to
job
creation
and
economic
growth
is
maintaining
safe,
secure
and
reliable
infrastructure
across
the
nation.
Congress
passed
this
legislation
to
ensure
that
funding
for
the
highway
projects
currently
underway
in
Arkansas ,
and
throughout
the
country,
would
not
lapse.
While
a
long-term
solution
to
this
ongoing
problem
is
ideal
and
remains
a
priority
for
me,
this
short-term
fix
is
crucial
to
Arkansas
and
other
states
that
rely
on
this
money
to
improve
roads
and
bridges.
I
carried
that
message
of
economic
security
around
Arkansas
this
week.
Getting
our
economy
on
track
is
an
issue
that
unites
Arkansas.
I
was
pleased
to
join
other
members
of
our
state&#146;s
Congressional
delegation
throughout
the
week
to
show
Arkansans
that
we
are
committed
to
improving
our
economy.
Lockheed
Martin
brought
its
Joint
Light
Tactical
Vehicle
to
Little
Rock
to
showcase
the
vehicle
it
hopes
to
produce
in
East
Camden.
Alongside
Governor
Asa
Hutchinson,
Senator
Tom
Cotton
and
Congressman
Bruce
Westerman,
I
urged
our
state
legislators
to
help
make
East
Camden
the
future
home
for
this
project,
which
will
bring
with
it
hundreds
of
highly
skilled,
quality
jobs.
Securing
a
contract
of
this
magnitude
is
important
for
providing
a
solid
economic
foundation
for
the
future
of
our
state,
South
Arkansas
and
the
people
who
call
this
region
home.
As
Congress
returns
to
Washington,
the
focus
must
remain
on
creating
jobs
at
home.
We
must
continue
to
direct
our
energy
toward
creating
policies
that
preserve
and
promote
an
environment
that
is
business
friendly,
encourages
productivity
and
innovation,
supports
educational
opportunities,
and
affords
all
Americans
the
opportunity
to
achieve
economic
freedom.
Quick
Takes:
Fighting
the
President&#146;s
Unconstitutional
Immigration
Action:
This
week
a
federal
appeals
court
rejected
the
President&#146;s
appeal
on
immigration
and
continued
to
block
the
administration
from
implementing
its
unconstitutional
immigration
policy.
While
news
reports
indicate
that
the
President
won&#146;t
ask
the
Supreme
Court
to
review
this ,
my
colleagues
and
I
are
joining
efforts
against
the
President&#146;s
policy.
Arkansas
and
25
other
states
have
challenged
President
Obama's
moves
to
ease
deportations
for
immigrants
living
in
the
country
illegally. I
recently
joined
more
than
100
of
my
colleagues
in
filing
an
amicus
brief
in
support
of
a
continued
injunction
against
President
Obama&#146;s
executive
overreach .
Reining
in
EPA
Water
Overreach:
The
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(EPA)
finalized
a
rule
this
week
that
puts
Washington
in
our
backyards.
The
&#147;waters
of
the
United
States&#148;
(WOTUS)
is
nothing
more
than
government
overreach
disguised
as
a
policy
to
protect
our
nation&#146;s
water
and
eliminate
the
role
of
state
protection.
The
Senate
needs
to
pass
the
Federal
Water
Quality
Protection
Act,
legislation
I
cosponsored
that
would
protect
our
nation&#146;s
waters
and
the
rights
of
landowners
against
an
overly
burdensome
and
costly
regulatory
power-grab
by
Washington.
This
bill
directs
the
EPA
to
revise
its
WOTUS
rule
to
exclude
waters
that
have
never
been
controlled
by
the
federal
government
like
isolated
ponds,
ditches
and
agriculture
water
that
lack
enough
flow
to
carry
pollutants
to
navigable
waters.
Protecting
Reliable
and
Affordable
Energy:
Congressman
Rick
Crawford
(AR-01)
and
I
toured
the
Independence
Steam
Electric
Station
in
Newark
on
Wednesday.
This
coal-fired
plant
is
threatened
under
EPA&#146;s
carbon
emissions
plan
that
targets
Arkansas
for
cuts
stricter
than
44
other
states
and
put s
jobs
in
our
state
at
risk .
EPA&#146;s
proposal
limiting
carbon
emissions
threatens
to
increase
energy
prices
and
reduce
reliability.
That&#146;s
why
I
recently
joined
Arkansas
Senator
Tom
Cotton
and
several
of
our
colleagues
to
introduce
the
Affordable
Reliable
Energy
Now
Act
to
fight
back
against
this
proposal.
VA
Inspector
General
to
Review
Solar
Panel
Activation
Failure:
In
my
last
e-newsletter
I
detailed
an
abuse
of
taxpayer
dollars
with
the
failed
activation
of
the
Little
Rock
Veterans
Affairs
Medical
Center&#146;s
(VAMC)
solar
panels.
The
VA&#146;s
Office
of
Inspector
General
notified
Congressman
French
Hill
(AR-02)
and
I
that
it&#146;s
adding
this
location
to
its
national
project
on
VA&#146;s
Green
Management
Program
Solar
Panel
Projects
after
we
asked
for
a
review
of
the
agency&#146;s
renewable
energy
program
because
of
this
problem.
Broadband
Access:
Access
to
affordable
and
reliable
Internet
is
vital
in
this
modern
age.
According
to
the
Federal
Communications
Commission
(FCC),
84
percent
of
rural
Arkansas
lacks
access
to
broadband.
This
is
an
important
issue
in
our
state.
That&#146;s
why
I
asked
FCC
Chairman
Tom
Wheeler
when
the
current,
antiquated
rules
would
be
updated.
The
Chairman
said
he
intends
to
implement
reforms
&#147;by
football
season.&#148;
Giving
Congress
a
Voice
in
Iran
Negotiations:
We
have
a
responsibility
to
ensure
that
Iran
never
achieves
its
goal
of
becoming
a
nuclear
power.
That&#146;s
why
the
Senate
overwhelmingly
passed
the
Iran
Nuclear
Agreement
Review
Act .
Without
this
bill,
there
will
be
no
review
of
the
Iran
deal.
There
would
be
nothing
stopping
President
Obama
from
signing
a
bad
agreement
with
Iran.
There
would
be
no
limitation
on
the
President&#146;s
ability
to
waive
sanctions
and
it
would
be
much
more
difficult
for
Congress
to
reinstate
sanctions
should
Iran
fail
to
live
up
to
its
end
of
the
bargain.
Critical
Habitat
Designation
&#150;
U.S.
Fish
and
Wildlife
Service
announced
its
final
critical
habitat
designations
for
the
Neosho
mucket
and
rabbitsfoot
mussels
under
the
Endangered
Species
Act
(ESA)
of
1973.
While
the
agency
trimmed
its
original
designation
I
still
have
concerns
about
the
real
economic
cost
and
will
work
with
my
colleagues
to
address
this
overreach.
Fort
Smith
Airport
Fire
Protection
Grant:
The
Federal
Aviation
Agency
(FAA)
awarded
the
Fort
Smith
Regional
Airport
nearly
$600,000
for
firefighting
equipment .
The
funds
will
be
used
to
buy
a
new
fire
truck
and
four
fire
protection
suits
to
assist
the
airport
in
meeting
safety
requirements.
This
grant
is
important
to
the
operation
of
the
airport
and
economic
development
in
the
community.
Supporting
Economic
Growth
Policies:
I
was
honored
to
receive
the
U.S.
Chamber
of
Commerce&#146;s
&#145;Spirit
of
Enterprise&#146;
award
for
voting
for
pro-jobs,
pro-growth
policies.
I
was
appreciative
of
members
of
the
Hot
Springs
Chamber
of
Commerce
for
presenting
me
with
this
recognition .
Operation
Reboot:
I
had
the
opportunity
to
see
how
Arkansans
are
supporting
our
veterans
during
a
visit
to
Rogers-based
Operation
Reboot.
Watch
my
video
about
this
great
program
that
helps
veterans
in
their
transition
to
housing.
As
part
of
National
Military
Appreciation
Month
I
encourage
you
to
honor
the
men
and
women
who
wore
our
nation's
uniform.
