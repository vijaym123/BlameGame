Dear Friend,
The battle lines in this year&rsquo;s election couldn&rsquo;t be much clearer. On one side, you have Democrats fighting to raise the minimum wage, guarantee equal pay for equal work, and expand opportunities for the middle class. On the other side, you have Republicans advocating an agenda that only benefits the special interests and the extremely wealthy.
Republicans&rsquo; policies are terrible for most Americans, but the GOP is on the verge of taking over the Senate.
Frankly, I&rsquo;m furious that all our hard work might end up being for naught. A Republican Senate is not going to stand up to polluters, the NRA, or the other special interests that are dominating Washington. But I won&rsquo;t stop fighting for what&rsquo;s right -- help my team stay strong by chipping in $5.

A Republican Senate is a special interest dream come true. They could end Medicare as we know it. They&rsquo;d block any efforts to make progress on combating climate change, or passing life-save gun safety laws, or expanding women&rsquo;s access to health care.
It&rsquo;s what the Koch brothers have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on this year -- and if Democrats don&rsquo;t turn out on election day, the Kochs&rsquo; plan just might work. If the Republicans want to take over the Senate, they&rsquo;ll have to do it without Massachusetts&rsquo; seat. Help us finish our campaign strong by giving $5.
Thank you.
