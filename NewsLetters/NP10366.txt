Now that more than three million Californians have enrolled in health
care coverage through Covered California, do you think Congress should
keep voting to repeal or dismantle the Affordable Care Act?
Yes - The law is not working for the majority of Americans, and
Congress must continue to try to repeal or dismantle the Affordable
Care Act
Maybe - Congress should repeal only some provisions of the Affordable
Care Act
No - The law is working for the majority of Americans, and Congress
must instead work to make the law even better

As you may know, this past Monday was Earth Day - a day for all of us
to be a little more conscious of the daily impacts we make on our
planet.
While we celebrate Earth Day once a year, I remain committed
to protecting our environment, our climate, and our future every day of
the year.
It's our choice whether or not we want to act on the issues that affect
our environment and help make our planet more livable for future
generations.
I choose action.
"Black April" Commemoration Week
Last Saturday, I joined the Vietnamese community in Little Saigon in
Westminster for the unveiling of the Black Wall of Remembrance, as well
as the hanging of the U.S. and Republic of Vietnam flags to kick-off
what is known as "Black April" Commemoration Week. The Black April
commemoration is a special time for the community to pay respect to the
Vietnamese and American soldiers who sacrificed their lives to protect
the freedom of South Vietnam and remember the civilians who lost their
lives during and after the war.
While there, I was pleased to help spread the news that democratic
activist and blogger Nguyen Tien Trung, whom I have adopted as a
"prisoner of conscience" through the Tom Lantos Human Rights
Commission, had been released in Vietnam.

My Visit to Ukraine
Earlier this week, I visited Ukraine with my colleagues from the House
Foreign Affairs Committee. We met with key Ukrainian officials to
discuss the Obama Administration's efforts to help maintain Ukrainian
sovereignty, as well as their security and the future of their energy
industry.
On Tuesday, I spoke to members of the international media at the
Ukrainian Crisis Media Center in Ukraine.

Affordable Care Act Update
As of April 15th, more than three million California consumers have
enrolled in health insurance plans or in Medi-Cal.
Of those enrolled in Covered California plans, 88 percent are eligible
for financial subsidies to help cover the cost of their health
insurance premiums, and 36 percent are between the ages of 18 and 34.
I am very pleased to see so many more people with health insurance and
that the first enrollment period come to a successful close!
"Revise and Extend"
Whenever Members of Congress deliver a speech on the House floor, they
must first ask permission of the chamber and the presiding officer to
revise their remarks in the Congressional Record, and extend them by
inserting material additional to their spoken words, such as
editorials, relevant newspaper articles, or constituent correspondence.
While permission is nearly always granted, members must begin each
speech with "I ask unanimous consent to address the House for X minutes
and to revise and extend my remarks."
