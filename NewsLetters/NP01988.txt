Rep. Scott Garrett pays tribute to Waldwick native Staff Sergeant
Joseph DAugustine by introducing a bill to rename a post office in his honor.
Dear Friend,
This week I was proud to reintroduce legislation to honor fallen Marine and Waldwick native Staff Sergeant Joseph DAugustine. My bill will forever designate the United States Post Office building located at 1 Walter Hammond Place in Waldwick, NJ the Staff Sergeant Joseph DAugustine Post Office Building.
Staff Sergeant Joseph DAugustine was killed in action in the Helmand province of Afghanistan on March 27, 2012 during his fourth tour of duty overseas.
While no action by this Congress could ever repay Staff Sergeant DAugustines sacrifice, renaming this post office in Josephs honor will create a permanent and visible memory of his heroism in the town where he grew up.
Last year, an identical bill that I introduced in the 113th Congress was passed unanimously by the House on June 17, 2014.
However, the bill was not taken up by the Senate, and therefore could not be signed into law.
May we never forget Staff Sergeant DAugustines bravery in the line of duty, and the family and friends he left behind.
Sincerely,
Scott Garrett
