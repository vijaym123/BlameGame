Cheri believes higher education should be available for everyone, not just the lucky few.
That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important that students who receive Pell Grants are given the flexibility they need to complete their education.

David -- America has always been a place where if you work hard and play by the rules, you&rsquo;ll have a fair shot to succeed. But recently, it seems like the price of college is stopping people from achieving their dreams. Pell Grants are key to keeping college affordable and accessible for all.
That&rsquo;s why Cheri is leading an effort to give more flexibility to students who receive Pell Grants. Will you sign our petition to demand Congress ensure education remains affordable and accessible for all?
It&rsquo;s simple: Expanded access to higher education and job training leads to a stronger middle class. Education is key to helping Americans get ahead. Please, join our efforts to keep college affordable: http://action.cheribustos.com/pell-grants Thanks for your support, Team Bustos
