Dear Friend &ndash;
Every year millions of Americans are affected by fraud and identity theft. I want to make sure you aren't one of them.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m holding a
Fraud and Identity Theft Awareness Workshop
on
Saturday, February 21 from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm
at the Rancho Santiago Community College District Boardroom located at 2323 N. Broadway in Santa Ana.
At my workshop you&rsquo;ll learn about tax fraud, mail scams, social security benefits scams and immigration fraud from representatives of the Internal Revenue Service, Social Security Administration, United States Postal Service and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service.
The event will also feature resource tables to provide you with tools to combat fraud. Specifically, my office will be distributing a 43-page booklet from the Federal Trade Commission titled &ldquo; Taking Charge: What To Do If Your Identity Is Stolen .&rdquo;
This publication outlines steps to reduce the risk and
repair the damage
of identity theft.
If you would like to attend or have questions, please contact my district office at (714) 621-0102 or

Very truly yours,
Loretta Sanchez
Member of Congress
