Let's Move In May!
May is Health and Fitness Month
Dear Friends,
This May, I urge you to join me as I renew my yearly pledge to health and fitness. I introduced a resolution recognizing the month of May as Health and Fitness Month and I am dedicated to making healthy living attainable for all Americans, empowering them to increase their physical activity and to improve their nutrition to lead robust lives. Together, we can take small steps every day to guarantee a healthier future for all.
According to the Center for Disease Control, there has been a steady increase in obesity in the United States during the past 20 years. I know how important it is to Americans everywhere that we take the steps needed to make sure our children and loved ones can live to their maximum potential. For this reason, I am introducing for the third year in a row a resolution to ensure that our nation makes health and fitness a priority every day.
Designating the month of May as Health and Fitness Month is more than just a pledge for me. Due to my concerns about making
healthcare
a priority for Americans everywhere, I will host the following FREE and family friendly events in the DFW Metroplex and in Washington, D.C. in recognition of Health and Fitness Month and to answer your questions:
Wednesday, May 13th
