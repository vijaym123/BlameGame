David --
here&rsquo;s the simple truth:
Republican outside groups and Super PACs are hell bent on defeating strong Democratic leaders across the country. If they succeed, it could spell disaster for our Democratic process.
The only way to stop them is by supporting strong Democratic leaders like Brad Schneider in Illinois&rsquo;s 10th district.
But, July 31 marks the first major deadline of this quarter. If we want to send Brad back to Congress, we&rsquo;ve got to pull together and help him hit his goal. David, I need you with me on this. Will you chip in a few dollars to help Brad hit his goal? If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
We have to protect our elections from outside groups that are determined to infiltrate our democracy. David, I&rsquo;m counting on you to help reelect Brad: http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/Fight-For-Brad
