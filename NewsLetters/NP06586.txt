This week marks the end of our month long district work period.
Throughout the last five weeks, weve traveled through every county in the 12 th
District, held events all over the area, and had some important discussions with folks about whats going on in Washington. We put thousands of miles on my old Jeep, and Im glad I had the chance to visit with so many folks.
We kicked off the work period by welcoming the Deputy Secretary of Agriculture, Krysta Harden, to the 12 th
District.
The Deputy Secretary is a Georgia-native and knows how important the agriculture is to our area. A diverse group of folks from the agriculture community joined us at three different roundtables to discuss disaster assistance needs, FARRM bill implementation, and how regulations from Washington are impacting our farmers.
Each August, we gather employers from across the district and in the
surrounding communities together for our annual jobs fairs. This year, most than 1,000 folks attended our jobs fairs in Augusta and Statesboro.
The hardest part of finding a job is knowing where to look, so we took that part out of the equation. We helped businesses meet folks from the area, prospective job applicants ask questions of employers, and we partnered with the community to get veterans the help they need in finding work when they return home.
We also held several seminars in the district to assist folks with grant
opportunities from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and to help folks who want to grow their small business or start a business.
We saw earlier this year what can happen when Mother Nature unleashes her fury on our area. I wanted to make sure our communities were up to date on the resources available to them should it happen again. We were also proud to partner with the Small Business Administration (SBA) to talk about growing or starting a small business.
Finally, we joined with Georgia Regents University to host a health and wellness fair for the community. Folks were able to meet with health professionals in a variety of areas to get tips for healthy living and to receive free health evaluations.
As you can see, we had a productive month in the district. From our events, to visiting with folks in the community, to talking with students who headed back to school, I was very glad to be able to spend an extended amount of time traveling the district. I hope you found some value in our events and are able to join us in the future.
