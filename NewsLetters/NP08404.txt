Rokita Readings
A clickable offering of books and articles that I've read recently and
highly recommend, as we strive together to "Keep the Republic."
In last week's Rokita Report, (click here
), I vowed to protect Hoosiers
from President Obama's latest attack in the "War on Coal".
In this
Rokita Readings, I wanted to share two columns with you that expand
further upon the energy debate.
Both articles were shared with me by a
good friend and I thought they tied in well with the current dialogue
on coal regulations.
Jeevan Vasager, in a January article from the Financial Times titled
"Germany cautions on impact of green energy
," reported on the strain that Germany's conversion to "green
energy" has had on Europe's economy.
In short, the subsidies are
costing business and consumers, while the increased energy costs are
squeezing German taxpayers.
In a second column, an editorial from the Financial Times titled "High
energy prices hold Europe back
," explores the economic opportunity for America in light of
Europe's green energy transition.
While prices in Europe continue to
soar after acquiescing to a politically-driven climate lobby, America
has the opportunity to expand the production of cheap energy, which
will lower costs, or continue down the path Europe is desperate to
reverse, resulting in higher costs for businesses and families.
In my talks with Hoosiers like you at my recent Town Hall in
Mooresville, I know that you want lower energy costs.
Those desires
run contrary to the actions of Obama's Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA).

Engaging Hoosiers - Mooresville Town Hall
Rep. Rokita is Greeted by a fellow Hoosier at the Mooresville Town Hall
As noted in the Rokita Readings above, I held a Town Hall event in
Mooresville on Monday.
I am encouraged by the great turnout of over
150 Hoosiers determined to be engaged citizens intent on Keeping the
Republic, as Benjamin Franklin commanded.
As with all of my Town Hall events, we started with a public reading of
one of our founding documents.
You can read the selections chosen here
.
At this event, volunteers
read selections from Article I, Section 8, known as the enumerated
powers, defining the role of Congress in our federal government.
We
continued with Article V, which outlined the state convention process
for proposing amendments to the Constitution, an effort I support and
that is underway, led by State Senator David Long
.
We closed the
reading with our First, Second, Fourth, and Tenth Amendments, as they
are the answers to many of the public debates we are having today.
I wanted to report to you some of the issues discussed.
Hoosiers are
concerned first and foremost, as am I, about our economy, which is
struggling to reach its potential because of the President's policies.
Rep. Rokita Fields Questions from Hoosiers in Mooresville
Hoosiers still stand in strong opposition to ObamaCare, which has
increased insurance and health care costs for many Hoosiers, and
contributed to the uncertainty facing our business community.
In addition to the great turnout, I was also encouraged that several of
the questions were focused on the Constitution.
These are the kinds of
discussions we must have that will elevate our public discourse and
help guide our Republic back to its founding principles of individual
freedom and limited federal government.
For the questions we weren't able to get to, please stay tuned to my
website and social media.
I'll be posting answers in the days to come.
I'd like to issue a special thank you to Boy Scout troops #203 and #250
- Caleb from Camby, and Zach, Austin, and Sam from Mooresville - for
their help in presenting colors and leading us all in the Pledge of
Allegiance.
A big thank you to these young men!

Building Relationships to Fight Poverty
Last week, as part of the Republican Study Committee
's Day of Service, I visited the Kokomo Rescue Mission
.
The Kokomo Rescue Mission was started as a men's
homeless shelter in 1953.
Since then it has expanded its ministry to
include a woman and family shelter, as well a store, food pantry, and
supper ministry in Clinton County.
Rep. Rokita Talks with Jim Paff, who works in Santa's Workshop at the
Mission 6-13-14
Over the last year, the House Budget Committee has held a series of
hearings to evaluate and propose new solutions to the "War on Poverty"
started by President Lyndon Johnson in 1964.
Today, there are an
estimated 46.5 million Americans living in poverty, the "War" has not
been successful.
Once again, heavy-handed federal programs have failed
the people they were intended to help.
So, what is the answer?
Organizations like the Kokomo Rescue Mission
are a start, and are succeeding where the federal government is
failing.
They are doing the work God commanded us to do - helping our
neighbors.
The men's shelter has provided over 15,593 nights of shelter and served
473 men in the last year.
The Open Arms women and family shelter has
provided over 10,979 nights of shelter.
36 percent of those night of
shelter were provided to children.
Combined, they have served 118,076
meals.
Local organizations, like the Mission, build relationships with the
people they are helping, where a federal government program cannot.
Relationships are the keys to success. A friend or mentor can follow
the person they are helping as they begin the climb out of poverty.
A
bureaucrat simply can't form a bond to this degree, and rarely has it
yielded long-term success.
I am encouraged by the work that the Mission, and other organizations
throughout our great state, are doing.
They recognize that "War on
Poverty" must be fought in our own neighborhoods, cities, and towns by
the people who live there.
While Washington surely can play a
supporting role, it cannot lead the fight if we are to succeed.

Boosting General Aviation - West Lafayette Aviation Roundtable
Early last week, I held a roundtable focused on the state of general
aviation in Indiana.
Stakeholders from the private sector, the
aviation education sector, and federal, state, and local aviation
officials were in attendance.
Rep. Rokita and Participants Discuss General Aviation
Our discussion reinforced many of the same points I have heard at other
aviation events, like at the Aircraft Owner and Operators Association
(AOPA) Fly-In in Indianapolis last month.
General aviation is an industry that is ripe for growth, but it is
experiencing difficulty doing so.
Due to excessive, burdensome, and
costly regulations that are discouraging new aviators and seeing many
older aviators leave the community, general aviation fails to reach its
full capacity.
That is the reason I introduced the General Aviation Pilot Protection
Act (GAPPA), to expand an already successful exemption of a costly
medical test in another flight class to general aviation. I was pleased
to hear support from the roundtable for the bill, and the efforts I
have led in gaining support from my colleagues in the House.
Right
now, we have 117 cosponsors, up five from last week, and continue to
gain key support from members of the Aviation Subcommittee. You can
read a recent op-ed I wrote on GAPPA and the importance of general
aviation by clicking here
.
In addition to GAPPA, we also discussed funding for the Airport
Improvement Program
, which provides grants for the planning and
development of public-use airports, as well as several of the
regulatory burdens associated with these grants.
Many of these
regulations are in need of updates as they are having a negative impact
on the growth of smaller airports.
Participants also expressed concern regarding a 600% increase in flight
training hours for airline first officers that was passed as part of
the 2010 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization.
It was
a drastic change in hours and is contributing to the pilot shortage
that is threatening our airlines.
Participants asked that Congress
consider reforming this rule in the next FAA Reauthorization
legislation.
Several pilots and aviation equipment manufacturers reported troubles
they have experienced as a result of the implementation of the Small
Airplane Revitalization Act
, a bill I coauthored that as signed into law last year.
The FAA
is requiring certification of simple modifications which has made
access to planes for new pilots a challenge at times.
I appreciated the feedback from everyone and will continue to hold
events like this as Congress considers the FAA Reauthorization in the
months ahead.

Thank you for your continued interest in Congress and for supporting my
efforts in Washington. Take care.
Sincerely,
Todd Rokita

Readings
A

offering
of
books
and
articles
that
I've
read
recently
and
highly
recommend,
as
we
strive
together
to
"Keep

In last week's
Rokita
Report,
( click

I
vowed
to
protect
Hoosiers
from President
Obama's latest
attack
in
the
"War
on
Coal".
In
this
Rokita
Readings,
I
wanted
to
share
two
columns
with
you
that
expand
further
upon
the
energy
debate.
Both
articles
were
shared with
me
by
a
good
friend
and
I
thought
they
tied
in
well
with
the
current
dialogue
on
coal
regulations.
Jeevan
Vasager,
in
a
January
article
from
the
Financial
Times
titled
" Germany
cautions
on
impact
of
green
energy ,"
reported
on
the
strain
that Germany's
conversion
to
"green
energy"
has
had
on
Europe's
economy.
In
short,
the
subsidies
are
costing
business
and
consumers,
while
the
increased
energy
costs
are
squeezing
German
taxpayers.
In
a
second column,
an
editorial
from
the
Financial
Times
titled
" High
energy
prices
hold Europe
back ,"
explores
the
economic
opportunity
for
America in
light
of Europe's
green
energy
transition.
While
prices
in
Europe
continue
to
soar
after
acquiescing
to
a
politically-driven
climate
lobby,
America
has
the
opportunity
to
expand
the
production
of
cheap
energy,
which
will
lower
costs,
or
continue
down
the
path
Europe
is
desperate
to
reverse,
resulting
in
higher
costs
for
businesses
and
families.
In
my
talks
with
Hoosiers
like
you at
my
recent
Town
Hall
in
Mooresville,
I
know
that
you
want
lower
energy
costs.
Those
desires
run
contrary
to
the
actions
of
Obama's
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(EPA).
Engaging

Rep.
Rokita
is
Greeted
by a
fellow
Hoosier
at
the
Mooresville
Town
Hall
As
noted
in
the
Rokita
Readings
above,
I
held
a
Town
Hall
event
in
Mooresville
on
Monday.
I
am
encouraged
by
the
great
turnout
of
over
150
Hoosiers
determined
to
be
engaged
citizens
intent
on
Keeping
the
Republic,
as
Benjamin
Franklin
commanded.
As
with
all
of
my
Town

started
with
a
public reading
of
one
of
our
founding
documents.
You
can
read
the

read
selections
from
Article
I,
Section
8,
known
as
the
enumerated

defining
the

of

in
our
federal
government.
We
continued
with
Article
V,
which
outlined
the
state
convention
process
for
proposing
amendments
to
the
Constitution,
an
effort
I
support
and
that
is
underway,
led
by
State

David
Long .
We
closed
the
reading
with
our
First,
Second,
Fourth,
and
Tenth
Amendments,
as
they
are
the answers
to
many
of
the
public
debates
we are
having
today.
I
wanted
to
report
to
you
some
of
the
issues
discussed.
Hoosiers
are
concerned
first
and
foremost,
as
am
I,
about our
economy,
which
is
struggling
to
reach
its
potential
because
of
the

Rep.
Rokita
Fields
Questions
from
Hoosiers
in
Mooresville
Hoosiers still
stand
in
strong
opposition
to
ObamaCare,
which
has
increased
insurance
and
health
care
costs
for
many
Hoosiers,
and
contributed
to
the
uncertainty
facing
our
business
community.
In
addition
to
the
great
turnout,
I
was
also
encouraged that
several
of
the
questions were
focused
on
the
Constitution.
These
are
the
kinds
of
discussions
we
must
have
that
will
elevate
our
public
discourse
and
help
guide
our
Republic
back
to
its
founding
principles
of
individual
freedom
and

we
weren't
able
to
get
to,
please
stay

to
my

I'll

Building
Relationships
to
Fight
Poverty
Last
week,
as
part
of
the
Republican
Study
Committee 's
Day
of
Service,
I
visited
the
Kokomo
Rescue
Mission .
The
Kokomo
Rescue
Mission was
started
as
a
men's
homeless
shelter in
1953.
Since
then
it
has
expanded
its
ministry
to
include
a
woman
and
family
shelter,
as
well a
store,
food
pantry,
and
supper
ministry
in
Clinton
County.
Rep.
Rokita
Talks
with
Jim
Paff,
who
works
in
Santa's
Workshop
at
the
Mission
6-13-14
Over
the
last
year,
the
House
Budget
Committee
has
held
a
series
of
hearings
to
evaluate
and
propose
new
solutions
to
the
"War
on
Poverty"
started
by
President
Lyndon
Johnson
in
1964.
Today,
there
are
an
estimated
46.5
million
Americans
living
in
poverty,
the
"War" has
not
been
successful.
Once
again,
heavy-handed
federal
programs
have
failed
the
people
they
were
intended
to
help.
So,
what
is
the
answer?
Organizations
like
the
Kokomo
Rescue
Mission
are
a
start,
and
are
succeeding
where
the
federal
government
is
failing.
They
are
doing
the
work
God
commanded
us
to
do
-
helping
our
neighbors.
The
men's
shelter
has
provided
over
15,593
nights
of
shelter
and
served
473
men
in
the
last
year.
The
Open
Arms
women
and
family
shelter
has
provided
over
10,979
nights
of
shelter.
36
percent
of
those
night
of
shelter
were
provided
to
children.
Combined,
they
have
served
118,076
meals.
Local
organizations,
like
the
Mission,
build
relationships
with
the
people
they
are
helping,
where
a
federal
government
program
cannot.
Relationships
are
the
keys
to
success. A
friend
or
mentor
can
follow
the
person
they
are
helping as
they
begin
the
climb
out
of
poverty.
A
bureaucrat
simply
can't
form
a
bond
to
this
degree,
and
rarely
has
it
yielded
long-term
success.
I
am
encouraged
by
the
work
that
the
Mission,
and
other
organizations
throughout
our
great
state,
are
doing.
They
recognize
that
"War
on
Poverty"
must
be
fought in
our
own
neighborhoods,
cities, and
towns
by
the
people
who
live
there.
While
Washington
surely
can
play a
supporting role,
it
cannot
lead
the
fight
if
we
are
to
succeed.
Boosting
General
Aviation
-
West
Lafayette
Aviation
Roundtable
Early
last
week,
I
held
a
roundtable
focused
on
the
state
of
general
aviation
in
Indiana.
Stakeholders
from
the
private
sector,
the
aviation
education
sector,
and
federal,
state,
and
local
aviation
officials
were
in
attendance.
Rep.
Rokita
and
Participants
Discuss
General
Aviation
Our
discussion
reinforced
many
of
the
same
points
I
have
heard
at
other
aviation
events,
like
at
the
Aircraft
Owner
and
Operators
Association
(AOPA)
Fly-In
in
Indianapolis
last
month.
General
aviation
is
an
industry that
is
ripe
for
growth,
but it
is
experiencing
difficulty
doing
so.
Due
to
excessive,
burdensome,
and
costly
regulations
that
are
discouraging
new
aviators
and
seeing
many
older
aviators
leave
the
community,
general
aviation
fails
to
reach
its
full
capacity.
That
is
the reason
I
introduced
the
General
Aviation
Pilot
Protection
Act
(GAPPA),
to
expand
an
already
successful
exemption
of
a
costly
medical
test
in
another
flight
class
to
general
aviation.
I
was
pleased
to
hear
support
from
the
roundtable for
the
bill,
and
the
efforts
I
have
led
in gaining
support
from
my
colleagues
in
the
House.
Right
now,
we
have
117
cosponsors,
up
five
from
last
week,
and
continue
to
gain
key
support from
members
of
the
Aviation
Subcommittee.
You
can
read
a
recent
op-ed
I
wrote
on
GAPPA
and
the
importance
of
general
aviation
by
clicking
here .
In
addition
to
GAPPA,
we
also
discussed
funding
for
the
Airport
Improvement
Program ,
which
provides
grants
for
the
planning
and
development
of
public-use
airports,
as
well
as
several
of
the
regulatory
burdens
associated
with
these
grants.
Many
of
these
regulations
are
in
need
of
updates
as
they
are
having
a
negative
impact
on
the
growth
of
smaller
airports.
Participants
also
expressed
concern
regarding
a
600%
increase
in
flight
training
hours
for airline
first
officers
that
was
passed
as
part
of
the
2010
Federal
Aviation
Administration
(FAA)
Reauthorization.
It
was
a
drastic
change
in
hours
and is
contributing to the
pilot
shortage
that
is
threatening
our
airlines.
Participants
asked
that
Congress
consider
reforming
this
rule
in
the
next
FAA
Reauthorization
legislation.
Several
pilots
and
aviation
equipment
manufacturers
reported
troubles
they
have
experienced
as
a
result
of
the
implementation
of
the
Small
Airplane
Revitalization
Act ,
a
bill
I
coauthored
that
as
signed
into
law
last
year.
The
FAA
is
requiring
certification
of
simple
modifications
which
has
made
access
to
planes
for
new
pilots
a
challenge
at
times.
I
appreciated
the
feedback
from everyone
and
will
continue
to
hold
events
like
this
as
Congress
considers
the
FAA
Reauthorization
in
the
months
ahead.
Thank
you
for
your
continued
interest
in
Congress
and
for
supporting
my
efforts
in
Washington.
Take
care.
