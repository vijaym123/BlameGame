Dear Friend,
Over the last few weeks, I've gotten a number of questions about the
situation in Ukraine, so I wanted to take the opportunity to offer a
brief update.
Following the breakup of the Soviet Union, Ukraine became an
independent state with the peninsula of Crimea as its southern border.
Toward the end of the Sochi Olympics in Russia this year, protests
began on the Crimean peninsula. By March 18, Russian President Vladimir
Putin signed a bill to absorb the peninsula of Crimea into the Russian
Federation. Since then, pro-Russian forces have rushed into the
peninsula with more arriving at the new Ukraine-Russia border each day.
The concern is that Russia's imperialism will not stop at Crimea and
that other former Soviet states could be next in Putin's path. After
all, in 2005, Putin stated that the collapse of the Soviet empire "was
the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century."
So far, the U.S. has put trade and investment talks with Russia on hold
and imposed sanctions against Russian politicians and business leaders
connected to the Putin administration. We have also put visa
restrictions on Russians and Crimeans who have threatened Ukraine's
independence. With enough countries (and economies) involved, we're
working to put pressure on Russia to reverse course. This has been done
in close collaboration with our partners in Europe, which is important.
This morning, I joined the House in passing additional support for
Ukraine. The bill, H.R.4278
, affirms America's
support for Ukraine and shows that we're ready to impose all economic
and diplomatic options necessary to isolate Russia. More specifically,
the legislation supports the freezing of assets, visa restrictions and
strong economic sanctions for those who threaten Ukraine's
independence.
It is important that the U.S. take a strong, forward-looking stance in
the region to prevent future abuses of power. It is an issue of
national security for the U.S.
If you have any additional questions about the situation in Ukraine or
any other issues, please don't hesitate to call 855-225-2801 or visit
my office nearest you
.
Best wishes,
Kristi

Dear
Friend,
Over
the
last
few
weeks,
I&#8217;ve
gotten
a
number
of
questions
about
the
situation
in
Ukraine,
so
I
wanted
to
take
the
opportunity
to
offer
a
brief
update.
Following
the
breakup
of
the
Soviet
Union,
Ukraine
became
an
independent
state
with
the
peninsula
of
Crimea
as
its
southern
border.
Toward
the
end
of
the
Sochi
Olympics
in
Russia
this
year,
protests
began
on
the
Crimean
peninsula.
By
March
18,
Russian
President
Vladimir
Putin
signed
a
bill
to
absorb
the
peninsula
of
Crimea
into
the
Russian
Federation.
Since
then,
pro-Russian
forces
have
rushed
into
the
peninsula
with
more
arriving
at
the
new
Ukraine-Russia
border
each
day.
The
concern
is
that
Russia&#8217;s
imperialism
will
not
stop
at
Crimea
and
that
other
former
Soviet
states
could
be
next
in
Putin&#8217;s
path.
After
all,
in
2005,
Putin
stated
that
the
collapse
of
the
Soviet
empire
&#8220;was
the
greatest
geopolitical
catastrophe
of
the
century.&#8221;
So
far,
the
U.S.
has
put
trade
and
investment
talks
with
Russia
on
hold
and
imposed
sanctions
against
Russian
politicians
and
business
leaders
connected
to
the
Putin
administration.
We
have
also
put
visa
restrictions
on
Russians
and
Crimeans
who
have
threatened
Ukraine&#8217;s
independence.
With
enough
countries
(and
economies)
involved,
we&#8217;re
working
to
put
pressure
on
Russia
to
reverse
course.
This
has
been
done
in
close
collaboration
with
our
partners
in
Europe,
which
is
important.
This
morning,
I
joined
the
House
in
passing
additional
support
for
Ukraine.
The
bill,
H.R.4278 ,
affirms
America&#8217;s

for
Ukraine
and
shows
that
we&#8217;re

to
impose
all
economic
and
diplomatic
options
necessary
to
isolate
Russia.
More
specifically,
the
legislation
supports
the
freezing
of
assets,
visa
restrictions
and
strong
economic
sanctions
for
those
who
threaten
Ukraine&#8217;s
independence.
It
is
important
that
the
U.S.
take
a
strong,
forward-looking
stance
in
the
region
to
prevent
future
abuses
of
power.
It
is
an
issue
of
national
security
for
the
U.S.
If
you
have
any
additional
questions
about
the
situation
in
Ukraine
or
any
other
issues,
please
don&#8217;t
hesitate
