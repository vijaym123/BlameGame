FINAL CHANCE: TRIPLE-MATCH ENDS IN 6 HOURS. PITCH IN &gt;&gt;
Friend --
The
New York Times
reports, &ldquo;In states too close to call&hellip; Democrats are making much greater investments in the ground game than Republicans.&rdquo; Thanks to YOU:
We&rsquo;re leading in FIVE Southern states -- enough to STOP McConnell&rsquo;s takeover
If we win, this election could be a DRAMATIC shakeup of the national political landscape
Would the GOP ever recover from losing the South??
Our Paint the South Blue Program has contacted MILLIONS of voters, but the election is still incredibly close. President Obama just warned,
&ldquo;I need you to choose today: Stand with me to mobilize every voter so we can win, or do nothing.&rdquo;
DON&rsquo;T do nothing and let the Republicans rip victory away from us. We MUST raise $40,000 more by midnight.
6 HOUR TRIPLE-MATCH: Will you pitch in to the Paint the South Blue Program before midnight?
