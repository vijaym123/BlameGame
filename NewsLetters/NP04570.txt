More than 10 million people across our country
took advantage of the new quality, affordable health coverage options
made available through Obamacare. The second Open Enrollment period
for Obamacare Marketplaces begins on Saturday, November 15 and ends
Sunday, February 15.
I hope you will take the
opportunity to shop and compare coverage options
and learn about your
eligibility for assistance to reduce the cost of your coverage through
Get Covered Illinois .
In 2014, 77% of
Illinoisans qualified for assistance.
For those
of you who enrolled in Marketplace plans last year, your coverage
will continue if you do nothing.
However, your insurer may have
changed the doctors and hospitals in the network, your premiums, your
copayment or coinsurance requirements, or the amount of premium
charged.
There will also be new plans to choose from, one of which could
work better for you and your family.
That is why I
strongly
urge you to revisit the Marketplace to review changes in
your current coverage, to look at new coverage options and to
update your financial information to make sure you get the full amount of
financial assistance possible.
If your plan automatically
renews on January 1, you still will have the option to shop for a new plan
until February 15.
If you dont have health insurance
or want to see if you can get better coverage, please take a look at
the options offered through Get Covered Illinois.
If youre a
small business owner, you can also shop and compare plans for you and
your employees.
You can get help answering questions by

section
or call 1-866-311-1119.
Whether this is your first time
or if you currently have Obamacare, you must make new selections by
December 15 if you want that coverage to start on January
1.
I strongly suggest looking into what health plan is best for you
and your family as soon as possible.
As you begin to
shop for plans please be aware that the ONLY websites
where you
will be able obtain assistance that helps make coverage more
affordable
are
www.GetCoveredIllinois.gov
or
www.healthcare.gov .
