Picture of the
Week:
On
Monday evening, the Architect of the Capitol, members of Congress, and
the Forest Service gathered outside on the west terrace of the U.S.
Capitol to light the Capitol Christmas tree. This has been a tradition
since 1964, and every year the Christmas tree gets more
beautiful.
As we approach the end of the 113th
Congress, the House of Representatives remains hard at work. This past
week, the House passed Representative Ted Yoho's bill to hold President
Obama accountable for his unilateral executive overreach on
immigration. Additionally, w e voted to prevent a tax
hike affecting "people ranging from schoolteachers, families of college
students and taxpayers in states without an income tax..." Read more
about this vote
in this article in the Fayetteville
Observer .
New subcommittee appointments were
announced this week in the
Energy
and Commerce Committee . In addition to serving on the Health
Subcommittee, and the Communication and Technology Subcommittee, Im
incredibly honored to have been appointed to the Energy and Power Subcommittee
for the 114th Congress. North Carolina plays an incredibly important
role in our countrys energy industry.
We are the
4th largest state for solar power capacity, providing more than 3,100
jobs to the people of N.C. Additionally, the oil and gas industry
supports approximately 146,000 jobs and pumps an additional $12.5 billion
into our states economy!
My role on this committee
will give North Carolina a voice as we work to shape our nations energy
policy.
We saw new reports this week saying that rises in health
insurance premiums are coming in 2015. Now even Democrats that
strongly supported Obamacare are realizing what Americans have known -- that
it didn't make health care more affordable or accessible. Senator Tom
Harkin, one of the authors of Obamacare, is now saying it is too
complicated and it may have been better not passing anything at all.
I am so
thankful for the opportunity to serve you in Congress.
Please
contact my office in Washington, Dunn or Asheboro if we can be of
assistance to you.
In Energy &amp; Commerce:
Im looking forward to the work Ill be doing on the Energy and Power
Subcommittee to explore new ways to increase energy efficiency and
create new jobs in the Tar Heel
State!
In the Second District:
The Express
Clydesdales of Express Employment Professionals were in Sanford this week!
Six Express Clydesdales pulled a
stagecoach carrying Santa Monday night in the Sanford Christmas
Parade.
A member of my staff
took the picture above of two
horses, Topper and Hedges, Tuesday at the Express open
house.
At the ir "Open House with the Clydesdales,"
Express
Employment Professionals collected canned food for The
United Way of Lee County and its partner agencies, The Salvation Army
and Christians United Outreach Center of Lee County.
Made in the USA Month:
December
is "Made in the USA" month. This is a great time to say thank you to
our manufacturers in the Second District and around the
nation.
