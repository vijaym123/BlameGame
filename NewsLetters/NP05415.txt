TRIPLE-MATCHED!
Fed up with the Republicans&rsquo; Obama-bashing attacks ads?
Help us fight back!
David, show your support for President Obama before the final public fundraising deadline.
ALL DONATIONS TRIPLE-MATCHED:
Boehner must&rsquo;ve been pretty proud of himself this morning&hellip;
The Republicans just launched a massive $17 million Obama-bashing ad blitz -- the biggest of the entire election. Well, Boehner&rsquo;s going to be screaming at his computer when he reads this&hellip;
Just a couple minutes ago, we unlocked the triple-match! That means your donation to fight Republican attacks will be TRIPLE-matched!!!
We just did the math: if we can bring in another $875,000 before tomorrow&rsquo;s fundraising deadline, we&rsquo;ll be able to get on-the-air, fight Republican lies, AND get out enough Democratic votes to win. That&rsquo;ll really send Boehner into a frenzy! David Johnson -- GET YOUR DONATION TRIPLE-MATCHED!
