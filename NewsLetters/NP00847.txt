Friend,
No one who works full time should have to live in poverty.
That&rsquo;s why I recently co-sponsored the
Raise the Wage Act
that would raise the national minimum wage from $7.25 to $12.00 by the year 2020.
Wages have been stagnating for too long, and unfortunately, a dollar does not go as far as it used to.
Nearly 38 million hard working Americans will benefit from raising the minimum wage. It will help parents provide for their children, close the wage gap, reduce poverty and strengthen the economy.
We need to make the minimum wage a livable wage.
Click here to sign your name in support of giving America a raise.
I grew up in a country that believed if you worked hard and put in an honest day&#39;s work, then you should be compensated properly.
But too often that is no longer the case.
We need to give hard working Americans the opportunity to succeed and that starts by raising the federal minimum wage.
Let&rsquo;s give America a raise-- sign your name in support of raising the minimum wage.
Be well,
Ami
