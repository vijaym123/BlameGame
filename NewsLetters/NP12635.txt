Capitol Update
Message from Congressman Cook on the Congressional Budget Office's
Report on Obamacare
Today, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its budget &
economic
report on Obamacare. This latest report confirms that under
Obamacare, millions of hardworking Americans will lose their jobs and
those who keep them will see their hours and wages reduced. The
president's health care law creates uncertainty for small businesses,
reduces take-home pay, and makes it harder to invest in new workers. I
remain committed to creating jobs, putting American's back to work, and
expanding the economy. We need to address the factors that drive our
nation's debt so that we don't cripple generations to come.
I will continue to offer common-sense solutions to grow our economy,
rein in federal spending, and protect the American people from the
consequences of Obamacare. I am a cosponsor of H.R. 3121, the "American
Health Care Reform Act," a bill to repeal and replace President Obama's
healthcare law. H.R. 3121 safeguards individuals with pre-existing
conditions by creating high-risk pools. These high-risk pools are
capped at 200 percent of the average premium of the state. This plan
extends existing health privacy protections and improves insurance
portability. We need a real market-based solution, not a
one-size-fits-all government scheme.
Congressman Cook Votes to Guarantee In-State College Tuition for
Veterans
Congressman Cook voted in favor of H.R. 357, the "G.I. Bill Tuition
Fairness Act of 2013." This bill was introduced by Rep. Jeff Miller
(R-FL), Chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee and passed
out of the House of Representatives with an overwhelmingly bipartisan
vote.
This legislation would expand educational opportunities for veterans by
allowing them to attend the state-run higher education institution of
their choice at the in-state tuition rate. This would assist veterans
who typically move to different states after joining the military and
are penalized by being charged out-of-state tuition if they choose to
remain for college.
Said Cook, "When service members go to war, they don't go to fight for
their home states, they fight for their entire nation. Veterans who
risk their lives fighting for the rights of this nation are heroes.
They should be welcomed to any state college with open arms."
