Dear
Friend,
As your Member of Congress, I think
its important to keep you up to date with what Im doing both in D.C.
and here at home.
From the immigration crisis at our southern
border, to the possible next 'Giant Leap' for America's space program -
much is happening in our country and I wanted to share with you a brief
update.
Ive enjoyed talking with those of you I've met with in
the recent weeks, and I look forward to continuing our discussions in
the future.
Factoid of the Day (Actually,
14 Years)
From Q1 2000 to Q1 2014, the American economy created 5.6 million net new
jobs in the 16-65 working age bracket.
Out of those 5.6 million
jobs created, legal and illegal immigrants obtained 5.7 million net
new jobs.
American born citizens lost 127,000 net jobs.
There are 17 million more unemployed American born citizens today than in
2000!
Immigrants swept the jobs field and had job gains in
virtually every segment of the American economy.
The argument that
immigrants only do jobs Americans wont do is not supported by the
facts.

Studies report , based on data from the Census Bureau and
Homeland Security and Labor Departments (the above data was confirmed
accurate by my staff).
Southern Border Illegal
Immigration Crisis
I addressed the U.S. House for the fourth time in two weeks,
detailing the economic damage done to American citizens over the past 14
years by federal immigration policies (emphasizing the need to curtail
illegal alien job competition while suggesting all Americans could
learn from the work and study ethics of lawful immigrants, who did very
well over the past 14 years).
Video of the speech is
available
HERE .
President Obama demands
a $3.7 billion supplemental to assimilate illegal aliens into
America.
Thats not border security, thats border surrender.
In
a
previous
speech on the
House Floor , I detailed a three-step solution to the surge in
illegal alien children flooding America:
"First, the Obama Administration
must stop enticing illegal alien children to America with promises of
amnesty and money.
America cannot give free food, free clothing,
free shelter, free health care, free transportation, free
entertainment, and billions of dollars a year in fraudulent tax refunds to
illegal aliens and then wonder why we have an illegal alien crisis!
"Second, illegal alien children from Central America and Mexico must be
treated equally
prompt returns to parents and homes without costly and
time-consuming deportation hearings.
All contrary laws must be
repealed or amended.
"Third, America must immediately fly illegal alien
children home by the least expensive means possible.
It costs as
little as $258 at CheapFlightNow.Com to fly from Houston to Managua,
Nicaragua. United Airlines flies from San Antonio to Guatemala City for as
little as $363 and to San Salvador, El Salvador for as little as
$292.
At $300 a pop, it costs less than $20 million to fly 60,000
illegal alien children home, thats everyone so far this fiscal
year.
If America used C-5 military aircraft and counted flight time as
pilot training time, the cost is even less.
"The President proposes spending
$3.7 billion to not solve the problem.
Yet spending $20 million
wisely does solve the problem.
$3.7 billion.
$20 million.
Mr. Speaker, this is a no brainer.
It is financially
irresponsible, no financial insanity, to spend $3.7 billion America does not
have, must borrow to get, and cannot afford to pay back when we can spend
$20 million and get better results and better border
security."
Ive cosponsored key
legislation to end the crisis at the
border:
H.R. 5160, Rep. Marsha Blackburns companion
legislation to Senator Ted Cruzs bill in the Senate, to end the use of
federal funding for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals
(DACA).
H.R. 5014, the Illegal Entry
Accountability Act, to suspend foreign assistance to certain countries
assisting with unlawful migration to the
US.
H.R. 2278, Rep. Trey Gowdys SAFE Act, to allow the
states to enforce immigration laws, as long as they dont exceed existing
federal law.
H.R. 5053, the
Expedited Family Reunification Act, to ensure the prompt and humane
deportation of unaccompanied alien
children.
We must return these children to their families
and secure the border if Americans want to go back to work and grow the
economy.
Ill continue fighting for the economic
interests of American citizens as Washington works its way through the
immigration
debate.
Tennessee Valley
Citizens Speak Out on Proposed Federal Internet Sales Tax
Legislation
Recently, I
asked 5th Congressional District residents to share their insight on
whether I should support legislation sought by brick-and-mortar retailers
that empowers the State of Alabama to collect sales taxes on internet
purchases made by Alabama citizens from out-of-state internet
retailers.
The
survey
was sent to randomly selected emails in the Tennessee Valley and a
remarkable 4,838 recipients participated - thanks to all who
submitted a response.
The
results are:
720, or
14.88%, said
"Yes, vote for
the internet sales tax legislation."
4,118, or
85.12%,
said
"No, vote against the internet sales tax
legislation."
Various senators have publicly asked
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to set a Senate vote on the issue in
the next few weeks and to thereafter send the internet sales tax
legislation to the House for consideration.
Time will tell if and when
I actually face the internet sales tax vote.
I will keep the
wishes of Tennessee Valley citizens in mind should I face a House Floor
vote on federal legislation to empower states to collect sales taxes
from Alabama citizens on out-of-state internet
sales.
Space Station Astronauts to Congressman Brooks:
Mars
Is Next 'Giant Leap' for America's Space
Program
Following the
45 th
anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon
landing , the Science, Space, and Technology (SST)
Committee held a special LIVE Q&amp;A with astronauts aboard the
International Space Station (ISS).
As a
child I grew up feeling the ground shake as the Saturn V rocket was
tested nearby and I vividly remember Apollo 11 when Neil Armstrong
descended from the lunar module declaring, "one small step for man, one giant
leap for mankind."
The Apollo program was American
exceptionalism at its best, and an important milestone for North Alabama
and America .
Im
thankful SST Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (TX-21) selected me as one
of the few Congressmen permitted to ask a question of the ISS
astronauts. During the Q&amp;A, I asked U.S. Astronauts Steven Swanson and
Reid Wiseman what NASA mission should be Americas next "giant leap for
mankind."
Dr. Swanson did not hesitate in answering,
"Mars."

Alabamian and American Hero Jeremiah Denton
Honored at Arlington
Last Tuesday morning I attended Arlington Cemetery services for
former U.S. Senator and U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Jeremiah Denton.
Admiral Denton was one of the finest patriots I have had the pleasure
to meet and I was fortunate to count him as a
friend.
His patriotism and determination during his 7 years and 7 months in
North Vietnamese captivity inspired fellow POWs and helped mend a war-torn
nation.
All Alabamians and Americans would do well to remember
this selfless patriot and strive to carry on the values he cherished
that have served our great nation so well for so
long.
A Mobile native, Jeremiah Denton was a POW for
seven and a half years in Vietnam.
He became famous for covertly
blinking the word "TORTURE" in Morse code during a televised interview
staged by his captors in 1966, confirming to the U.S. government for
the first time that American POWs were being tortured.
Denton
was released in 1973.
He retired from the military as a rear
admiral in 1977, and went on to become a U.S. Senator.
Denton passed
away on March 28, at 89 years.
Arlington Cemetery Services
for Admiral
Jeremiah A. Denton,
Jr.
As always, it is an honor and privilege to represent you and
your family.
Sincerely,
Member
of Congress
