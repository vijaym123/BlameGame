Dear
David,
President Obama's so-called " victory lap " on ObamaCare
may have been a bit premature. According to a recent survey,
only 38% of Americans think the president's health
care law is working .
Maybe that's because so
many people have experienced
skyrocketing premiums
and
job losses
as a result of this flawed law. On
top of that, we recently learned that the disastrous ObamaCare
website is far from finished, and is estimated to
cost
taxpayers $121 million
before the second round of enrollments - $30
million more than the Obama Administration estimated a few months ago.
The president's own approval rating has
dropped to
37% . To make matters worse for President Obama, early results show
that only
two-thirds
of individuals that signed up
for the ObamaCare exchanges actually paid their enrollment premiums.
Every day, I receive stories from Missourians who are concerned
about the president's health care overhaul. And almost every week, I
go to the Senate floor to share those experiences.
If
you have questions or concerns about ObamaCare, I hope you will
share your story with me here .
