EMERGENCY TRIPLE-MATCH EXTENSION DUE TO LAST NIGHT'S REPORT OF REPUBLICAN OUTSIDE GROUPS RESERVING $12 MILLION WORTH OF TELEVISION ADS TO DEFEAT US, THE TRIPLE-MATCH HAS BEEN EXTENDED THROUGH TODAY. TRIPLE-MATCH IS AVAILABLE UNTIL 11:59PM EST.
David -- Did you see the new CNN poll?
DEMOCRATS HAVE TAKEN A 2-POINT LEAD!
That&rsquo;s the 2nd poll in a row showing Democrats with a lead! Together, we can deliver a devastating defeat to Boehner in this election!!!
Now, we just have to find a way to close this budget gap.
Yesterday, news broke that Boehner&rsquo;s billionaire backers are coming in full-force. 7 different outside groups are teaming up to take us down.
David -- we can&rsquo;t let the Republicans steal this election with a last-minute billionaire-backed ad blitz. So for today only, we&rsquo;re extending the triple-match until midnight tonight.
Please don&rsquo;t pass up this special opportunity. Chip in whatever you can today:

It&rsquo;s great to have a lead (finally!) but we should be clear-eyed about this. The race for Congress is still a complete toss-up. Yesterday's poll shows us up by 2 points, 47% to 45%. But after the beating we&rsquo;ve taken from the Republicans and the SuperPACs, we&rsquo;ll take good news wherever we can get it!
Now it&rsquo;s up to us to take advantage of this opportunity. And for that, we need you.
Please chip in whatever you can today:
