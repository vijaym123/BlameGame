World Record Toffee in Midland
__________________________________________
Thank you for reading The Conaway Chronicle, a review of my activities in Congress and the 11th District.
1965 Permian Panthers Reunion
Today, I am joining my teammates from the 1965 Permian Panthers to celebrate the 50th anniversary of our state championship. I am really excited to see everyone and look back on the last 50 years. This week, I spoke on the House floor, reflecting on that season and all that I learned from Coach Mayfield and my teammates. You can find the video by

Honor Flight
This past weekend, I had the pleasure of meeting the Permian Basin Honor Flight at the U.S. Navy Memorial. We took quite a few pictures, which I posted to my Facebook page. You can find all the pictures from the trip by

World Record Toffee in Midland
Did you know that Susie's South Forty Confections, Inc. in Midland, Texas is the Guinness World Records holder for the largest piece of toffee? The piece of toffee that won the title was 2,940 pounds and shaped like Texas, measuring 10.5 ft wide, 8.5 ft long, and 2 ft deep at it's widest point. It took 1,040 pounds of butter, 851 pounds of sugar, 690 pounds of pecan pieces, and 200 pounds of chocolate to make the piece of Texas Pecan Toffee that has held the world record for over 12 years!
As always, you can follow me on

Rep. Mike Conaway, 11th District
