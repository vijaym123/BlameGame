Rubio, Menendez Introduce Resolution
Deploring Violence In Venezuela,
Calling For Full Accountability For
Human Rights Violations
Marco, along with Senate Foreign
Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez
(D-NJ) and Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL),
introduced a Senate Resolution (
S.
Res. 365 ) deploring the violent
repression of peaceful demonstrations in
Venezuela, calling for full
accountability for human rights
violations, and supporting the right of
the Venezuelan people to live freely and
democratically.
With the Venezuelan people
struggling and sacrificing for freedom,
liberty and human rights, they deserve
to have their voices be heard, and they
deserve the worlds leading
defender of human rights to be on their
side,
Rubio said . Nicols
Maduro and his thugs must be held
accountable for the atrocities
committed against the people of
Venezuela, including unjust
incarcerations, violent repression and
killing of innocent protestors.
This Resolution urges
President Obama to immediately impose
targeted sanctions that are already
possible under existing law and
encourage a process of dialogue between
Venezuelas government and the
political opposition,
Rubio added . It is time
for the United States to support the
Venezuelan peoples pursuit of a
safe and democratic way of life, as
guaranteed under their
constitution.
On Monday, he delivered a compelling
floor speech about Cubas role in
the crisis in Venezuela. Watch the speech
here .
Rubio:
Iget thousands of
retweets fromstudents and young
people, untilthey shut them out, in
Venezuelawho are encouraged by the
factthat we are on their
side.What they want is what we
have,the freedom and the
liberty.Thats what all
people want.And if America and
itspolicy-makers are not going
tobe firmly on the side of
freedomand liberty, who in the
worldis?
Marco also discussed the crisis in
Venezuela with

Rubio Welcomes Disaster Assistance
For Apalachicola Economic Recovery
Marco welcomed the announcement made
by the U.S. Department of Commerce to
allocate $6,316,533 in disaster
assistance funding for the oyster fishery
in Florida. On August 12, 2013, a federal
fisheries disaster was declared for the
oyster fishery along the northwest coast
of Florida due to excessive drought
conditions in Apalachicola Bay and
elsewhere in the Florida Panhandle that
have caused the regional economy to
suffer significantly. Historically, the
Apalachicola Bay region has produced 90
percent of Floridas oysters and 10
percent of the oysters supplied to the
entire country.
Todays announcement
will bring much-needed relief to the
small business owners and families in
the Apalachicola community whose way of
life depends on the health of the
oyster fishery,
said Senator Rubio . Every
bit of this disaster assistance will be
a good first step in helping the local
communities, industries and businesses
severely impacted and that have
suffered immense economic damage
because of a preventable, man-made
disaster. These small businesses and
hard-working Floridians still deserve a
permanent solution, and I remain
committed to fixing this problem until
Floridas oyster fishery is once
again vibrant.
Rubio Comments On Obama
Administrations Upcoming Defense
Budget
Marco issued the following statement
regarding the proposal by Secretary of
Defense Chuck Hagel to drastically reduce
our militarys size:
Every day, we are reminded
that the world remains as dangerous as
ever and that we need a modern military
to protect the American people and U.S.
interests abroad. It is vital that we
maintain a strong U.S. military that
serves as a capable deterrent, ensures
freedom of the seas, and provides
security for ourselves and our
allies.We also need a military
that is able to project force globally
when crises emerge, sometimes at a
moments notice.
I am concerned that the
budget announced today will put all of
these goals at risk.Reducing the
size of the Army to its lowest levels
in seventy years does not accurately
reflect the current security
environment, in which the
administrations own officials
have noted the threats facing our
country are more diffuse than
ever.Cutting key Air Force and
naval capabilities just as we are
trying to increase our presence in the
Pacific does not make strategic
sense.I am concerned that we are
on a path to repeat the mistakes
weve made during past attempts
to cash in on expected peace dividends
that never materialized.Mistakes
that caused our allies to question
Americas staying power and
encouraged our enemies to test us.
We should always look for
efficiencies in our military budget and
ensure that any wasteful spending is
cut or directed to vital programs. But,
the fact of the matter is that this
administration has been cutting defense
since it came into office and doing
little to address our real fiscal
challenges.Ultimately, we need to
make sure that the real drivers of our
debt are addressed. We need to save
Medicare and Social Security to not
only ensure future seniors can retire
with dignity and a safety net, but also
to make sure that we dont
sacrifice our security in order to deal
with our debt.
President Obamas
upcoming budget reflects his
indifference to doing anything about a
growing $17.3 trillion debt, as well as
his nave and misguided perception
of just how dangerous the world
is.
Constituent Casework Corner
Stephen, a New York resident,
contacted Senator Rubios office
for assistance because his father, a
Florida veteran, passed away. Stephen
wanted to secure military honors at his
fathers funeral. The service was
going to be held at a Florida National
Cemetery and the office had 24 hours to
locate and deliver the necessary
discharge papers required to secure a
proper military burial. With the help of
the National Guard Bureau and the Florida
National Guard, the task was completed
and the honors were performed.
