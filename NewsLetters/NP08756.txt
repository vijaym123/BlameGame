Dear
Friends,
Did you know Delaware is
the first state?
Well, of course you did.
But you probably didn't know
that this summer I'll be
featuring First State facts
for my friends and followers
- say that 5 times fast! - on
Twitter. The series,
Did You Know Delaware ,
will feature a series of
interesting facts on Twitter
to celebrate the state we
know and love.
All summer long I will be
revealing
Did You Know
Delaware facts with
the hashtag
#DYDK.
Here are some
interesting facts you might
have missed:
The 1989 film Dead Poets
Society was shot at St.
Andrew's School in
Middletown.
The Fenwick Island
lighthouse was painted in
1880 for a total cost of
about $5 and added to
National Registerof
Historic Places in
1979.
And todays
#DYKD
fact: This Sunday, June
15th, Delaware celebrates
its 238 year independence
from both Pennsylvania and
the British Crown.
To my friends and fellow
Delawareans, I encourage you
to join the fun and
share
interesting facts you know
about our state using #
DYKD . You could
teach us all something, no
matter how solemn or
silly.
Happy tweeting!
