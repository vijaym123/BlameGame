Dear
David,
February is National Black History Month, and while we reflect
on African Americans contributions to our nation, we are reminded of
the special role that New Yorkers, especially Rochesterians, have
played in our nations history: we can find examples of leadership,
courage, and innovation right in our backyard.
Frederick Douglass, Beatrice Amaza Howard, and Dr.
Freddie Thomas, clockwise from the left, all played critical roles in
the history of Rochester and our country.
No history
of Rochester is complete without mentioning the life and leadership of
Frederick Douglass. Douglass, a former slave, made his home in
Rochester from 1847 to 1872. His newspaper and oratory emboldened the
abolitionist movement and helped stir the conscience of our nation to the
horrors of slavery.
Beatrice Amaza Howard reminds us of the
truth that courage is most often on display in everyday actions. Howard
was the first African American woman to graduate from the University
of Rochester in 1931 and spent her career teaching in public schools,
inspiring every student who passed through her
doors.
Rochester has long been a center of creative thinking, and Dr. Freddie
Thomas played a key role in expanding our understanding of genetics and
surgery at the University of Rochester. A scientist, scholar, and
inventor, Dr. Thomas conducted pioneering research in these areas during the
1950s.
Every day this month on
Facebook , Ill be highlighting these contributions and many like them. I
encourage you to follow along and
share
with
your family and friends.
In his newspaper,
The North
Star , Frederick Douglass proclaimed that Truth is of no Colorwe are
all Brethren. I look forward to continuing to help make this creed a
reality as we move forward, inspired by these remarkable leaders
during National Black History
Month.
Sincerely,
Louise
