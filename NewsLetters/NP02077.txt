David --
Everyone plans for their future differently, but one thing&rsquo;s certain -- everyone wants to retire with dignity. That&rsquo;s why millions of seniors count on Medicare to provide affordable health care after they&rsquo;ve retired.
But, Tea Party extremists are putting Medicare in jeopardy by turning it into a voucher program.
Cheri went to Congress to help the 1.9 million seniors in Illinois who rely on Medicare, and she won&rsquo;t let extremists pull this dirty trick.
Sign The Petition:
Stop the Tea Party from turning Medicare into a voucher program &gt;&gt;
After working hard for their entire career, our seniors should receive the benefits they&rsquo;ve been promised. And our families deserve the peace of mind knowing that their loved ones are being cared for.
Don&rsquo;t allow extremists in Congress to gut Medicare -- sign the petition:
