The Webster Wire
Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Every month, Judy Proli organizes a social breakfast for the residents of her neighborhood, Sanctuary Ridge. Last year, I had the opportunity to speak at one of her breakfasts, so Judy invited me back again to come and share an update this month. It was a packed room, and I was grateful for the opportunity to interact with Clermont residents, share my thoughts, and hear their views on issues facing our country, particularly the threat that the terrorist organization ISIS is posing to our American security.

October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, so Orlando Health sponsored a Pink October event last week at the Dr. P. Phillips Hospital. After the gathering in their atrium, Kathy Black, the Chief Nursing Office, gave me a tour of their cancer facilities and provided me with an update on how the recent partnership with the University of Florida is allowing them to expand their research capacities and offer more advanced quality care.

Last weekend, I went to the Leesburg National Guard Armory to watch the Alpha Company drill and thank them for their committed service to the safety and security of our community and country. Later in the week, I was with the new Veterans Affairs Secretary Bob McDonald and discussed ongoing reforms at the VA. I shared several issues of concern with the Secretary, and look forward to working with him and Chairman Jeff Miller to uphold our promise of quality care to those that have served.

At the Eustis Leads Group lunch last Tuesday, I shared an update on both foreign and domestic policies. Many of their questions centered on the ruthless terrorist organization ISIS and issues that are personally affecting their businesses. Several of the members shared their experience regarding the burdensome regulations in Obamacare and the need for tax reform.

Last Wednesday, I attended the Hispanic Chamber Metro West Leads Group and had a great conversation with their group. As a fellow businessman, I shared basic economic restraints and businesses practices that are lacking in the federal government and how I am working to identify and reduce waste and unnecessary regulations. I also shared a copy of our Constituent Service Guide in Spanish, and offered my office as a resource to constituents who need assistance with a federal agency.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
In November 2009, a constituent from Leesburg was diagnosed with a rare incurable terminal lung disease.
Due to her declining health and inability to perform successfully, she retired from teaching Special Education and filed for Social Security Disability. After the claim was denied, the constituent filed an appeal with additional medical records.
My office submitted an inquiry on her behalf and informed her that we would continue to monitor her case during the processing of her appeal. At her request, I sat down with her to hear her concerns and discuss the situation. Shortly after her appeal was approved, my office received this note:
I just wanted to express my appreciation to Congressman Daniel Webster, you and all those in his office that helped me with my Social Security Disability issue. I did receive confirmation that I was awarded disability to begin in October and truly believe this only occurred due to the Congressional inquiry and the Congressman's involvement in my particular case. It was definitely a pleasure to be able to meet with the Congressman and his associates and I appreciate the time they took out of their schedules to talk with my husband and I. Please pass my appreciation on to all those involved.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
Just last week, I spoke with business owners who shared how burdensome and confusing Obamacare has been as they try to care for their employees healthcare needs. October 1st marked the first anniversary of the laws implementation, yet major parts of the bill have been changed, waived, or delayed until after the election season.
Do you believe that Americans are better off with the Obamacare policies?
Yes
No
I don't know

Legislative Update:
During several of my discussions with constituents last week, I heard concerns about the gridlock that is currently plaguing Washington. I share their frustration. Unfortunately, most of the bills that the House has passed this Congress remain stuck in the Senate. There are dozens of job-creating bills that the Senate Majority Leader refuses to even consider for a vote.
Distressingly, we are also faced with an Executive Branch determined to circumvent out system of checks and balances to selectively enforce or expand duly passed laws.
The simple truth is that Washington has strayed from principle-based leadership in exchange for a system that rewards and relies upon power.
No single Member, regardless of party or seniority, should have the ability to grind things to a halt.
Members should be working together to move forward solutions through a process that allows for many voices to be heard and ideas to rise or fall based on their merit, not the seniority of their sponsor. I am working to make this process, known as "regular order," the norm rather than the exception. As importantly, the Executive Branch should remain focused on its constitutional responsibility of enforcing, not writing, law.
