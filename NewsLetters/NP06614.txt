Congressman Austin Scott to host Military Service Academy Day 2014 at
Moody Air Force Base
I hope you and your family have had a safe and relaxing Labor Day
weekend so far.
As we enjoy the last few days of summer with family
and friends, let us be reminded that while we celebrate a day designed
to honor working people, far too many Americans are still without jobs.
I remain committed to promoting job growth, and I look forward to
returning to Washington to find solutions to get Americans back to
work.
Georgia's Contribution to Our Nation's Defense:
As only one of two Georgia members of Congress on the House Armed
Services Committee, I believe that it is important to visit all of our
state's military bases in order to best represent our military men and
women.
The state of Georgia makes an important contribution to our
nation's defense, and I was honored to visit Fort Stewart and Hunter
Army Airfield last week.
I met with Commanding General Murray at Fort Stewart to discuss the
importance of the 3rd Infantry Division.
It was a privilege to tour
the installation and meet with many of the soliders from the 3 ID.
Our
discussions centered on the plans for the realignment of Brigade Combat
Teams and the 3 ID's mission, training activities, and recent
deployments.
At Hunter Army Airfield, I visited with leadership from the 160th Army
Special Operations Aviation Regiment and the 75th Ranger Regiment.
I
observed their impressive combat capabilities, including the MH-47G
Chinook and MH-60M Blackhawk helicopters, and discussed the impact of
budget pressures on the regiment's training and mission.
Sincerely,
Austin Scott
Member of Congress
