Dear Fellow Nevadan,
Small businesses in
Nevada and across the country play an important role in our economy by
spurring innovation, growth, and job creation. Their success is key to
our economic recovery, so we must do everything possible to support
small businesses as they hire local workers and contribute to local
economies.
Today is an opportunity to think small and support
the local merchants, shop owners, and entrepreneurs that help
strengthen our communities all year round. With this years holiday season in
full swing, I encourage Nevadans to shop small today, and whenever
possible, to help boost our economy and make our communities more vibrant
places to live and work.
To learn more about my work in the
Senate on behalf of Nevadans or to contact me, please visit
