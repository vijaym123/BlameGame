Friend,
Did you see Ami&#39;s email Tuesday?
Boehner&#39;s political folks, the NRCC, have committed to spend nearly a million dollars in our district, other outside dollars are pouring in, we&#39;re staring down a self-funding opponent, and we&#39;re coming up on a huge deadline.
Let&#39;s break that down list-style, shall we?
1. The NRCC (John Boehner&#39;s political army!)
2. Other outside dollars (Shadowy special interest groups!)
3. Self-funding opponent (He has so much money!)
4. Huge deadline (June 30th! Right around the corner!)
On top of that - in order to stay competitive, and to post numbers that show the strength of our team,
we need to raise $10,600 more before
next Monday
night.
But we have a real advantage - because we&#39;ve got you. We know you understand the gravity of the situation. (And if you need any clarification, see above for a handy 4-point list. You&#39;re welcome. We do what we can.)
Click here to give $5 towards our June 30th goal.
We&#39;re fortunate to be able to count on you - it&#39;s a daily reassurance to know that you&#39;re committed to fighting alongside us.
Now, this deadline will be our first head to head test against our opponent in the general election--
please pitch in $5 or more to make sure we come out on top.
Thanks again - talk soon!
Team Bera
PS - The deadline
next Monday
is a big one, and the amount we raise is going to be judged - nationally. Click here to show them what&#39;s up.
Go Team Bera!
