Friends,
The bipartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released their report last week on the state of the economy including Obamacares impact on employment.
The reports findings were shocking.
CBO predicts that Obamacare will cause "a decline in the number of full-time-equivalent workers of about 2.0 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024."
This does not mean that the law will eliminate millions of jobs.
It means that 2.5 million people will be encouraged to stop working
by incentives created by Obamacare .
CBOs report also revealed that
Obamacare will add trillions of dollars to Washingtons out-of-control debt .
This law has already made things worse for South Carolinian families and our economy. We cannot afford these impacts too.
100 members unite behind the STOP Resolution
When asked about the Presidents intent to bypass Congress, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) exclaimed, Lets write up these executive orders.
The Congresswoman recently formed a caucus focused on paving a way for the President to achieve his executive orders.
At a press conference she said the caucus will work to give President Obama a number of executive orders that he can sign with pride and strength."
This concerns me that Members of Congress, no matter their party, are fine with the President ignoring the Separation of Powers.
One hundred Representatives have united behind my STOP Resolution , which would stop the President from bypassing Congress.
Join us for a STOP Resolution Telephone Town Hall tomorrow, Monday, February 10 .
