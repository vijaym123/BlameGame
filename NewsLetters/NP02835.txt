Dear Friend,
President Obama delivered his annual State
of the Union Address on January 20 to a joint
session of Congress. I listened closely
to his message and was especially interested in
what he had to say about tax reform.
Unfortunately, he is continuing on the path of
proposing piecemeal changes to our tax code
rather than the comprehensive tax reform which
everyone agrees that we need.
As one example, he called for closing
loopholes that reward companies to keep profit
abroad. While I was in Congress, my
Republican colleagues and I, over and over,
called for closing tax loopholes, but our
voices landed on the deaf ear of the Obama
Administration.
Ive said it many times before, and
Ill keep repeating it until our message
is heard. Closing tax loopholes must be
part of a
comprehensive tax reform
package.
The
President's attempts to pick and choose certain
sections of the tax code to change simply will
not work. Its like moving chairs
around on the Titanic . Honestly,
America is being left behind. While other
countries are moving forward rapidly in
reforming their tax codes, America is moving at
a glacial pace. We must bring our tax
code into the 21st century and we can only do
that with comprehensive reform.
Help me send that message to President Obama
and
sign our petition today
.
I promise you this - CAMPAC will work hard
to ensure that the President and his liberal
allies understand that the American people want
less spending and lower taxes, AND
comprehensive tax reform now. Add
your signature to mine and thousands of others
across the country -
Sign on today
.
Thank you for your continuing support.
Dave Camp,
Chairman, CAMPAC
