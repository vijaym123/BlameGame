Dear Friend &ndash;
Sorry to bug you, but there is a really important deadline coming up.
In order to be covered by January 1st under a health insurance plan through Covered California, you must enroll by midnight this Monday, December 15th.
If you&rsquo;re one of the
50,000 California that have already enrolled
&ndash; GREAT!
If you&rsquo;re not, don&rsquo;t wait any longer: visit CoveredCA.com, call (800) 300-1506, or
find in-person local help .
You can also swing by an EnrollOC enrollment event tomorrow at the Santa Ana Bristol Clinic (2720 S. Bristol St. Santa Ana, CA, 92704) from 8:00 am - 5:00 pm.
If you have any questions, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact my District Office at (714) 621-0102 or visit my website at www.lorettasanchez.house.gov/EnrollOC.
Very truly yours,
Loretta Sanchez
Member of Congress
