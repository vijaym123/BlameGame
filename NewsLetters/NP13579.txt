Read below for a special message from Congresswoman Brooks.
Dear Friends,
Time and again, 5th District constituents have told me the political
uncertainty coming from Washington makes planning for their own futures
increasingly difficult. It's hard to plan on expanding your business,
buying a new home or heading off to college when our government can't
get its fiscal house in order. That's why I recently voted for the
Bipartisan Budget Act, introduced in the House of Representatives by
Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan.
This deal decreases the deficit by $23 billion without raising taxes. I
would not have voted for a bill that increased our deficit or took more
money away from hardworking Hoosier taxpayers.
The budget deal also preserves the historic deficit reduction measures
Republicans won during the 2011 Budget Control Act negotiations and
actually ensures we continue to realize significant additional savings
beyond those called for in the 2011 agreement.
Moreover, the deal finds common sense spending reforms to replace the
nearly $22 billion in cuts to defense spending that would have gone
into effect in January had Congress failed to act. These cuts would
have seriously impacted our military families and America's ability to
defend itself from dangerous foreign threats. Those who put everything
on the line to defend our freedom should not have to worry about having
the right type of equipment or whether they'll have enough money to
support their families. A strong national defense is in all of our best
interests.
This deal is not perfect. But the importance of having a budget for the
first time in four years cannot be overstated. With the threat of
government shutdowns removed in 2014, we can now stop governing from
crisis to crisis. With a working budget Congress can begin to impose
smarter spending priorities through the appropriations process rather
than giving the White House total control of the nation's purse
strings. We can also ensure the House is able to focus on its proper
oversight duties in 2014, most especially when it comes to the
ineffective implementation of Obamacare.
Moving forward, there is much more work to be done to put America on a
path to fiscal solvency, and I am committed to doing that work. I
believe this is an important first step and I will continue to advocate
for more deficit reduction and a pathway to a balanced budget. I will
continue to push for a more efficient government that realizes every
government dollar spent is a dollar someone else earned. I remain
hopeful that Congress can make a difference on these issues and many
more as we head into 2014.
Thank you so much for reading this message. It has been an honor to
serve you in Congress this year and I wish you and your family a happy
and joyous holiday season.
Best Wishes,
Susan W. Brooks

"My beloved wife of 16 years, Alicia Dawn, was the glue that held our
family together," said Alicia Koehl's widower, Paul Koehl. "Through
this positive step, at least in some small measure, Alicia's death will
not have been in vain, but instead, an instrument for justice and peace
for our family as well as the families of future victims."

Read
below
for
a
special
message
from Congresswoman
Brooks.
Dear
Friends,
Time
and
again,
5th
District
constituents
have
told
me
the
political
uncertainty
coming
from
Washington
makes
planning
for
their
own
futures
increasingly
difficult.
It&#8217;s
hard
to
plan
on
expanding
your
business,
buying
a
new
home
or
heading
off
to
college
when
our
government
can&#8217;t
get
its
fiscal
house
in
order.
That&#8217;s
why
I
recently
voted
for
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act,
introduced
in
the
House
of
Representatives
by
Budget
Committee
Chairman
Paul
Ryan.
This
deal
decreases
the
deficit
by
$23
billion
without
raising
taxes.
I
would
not
have
voted
for
a
bill
that
increased
our
deficit
or
took
more
money
away
from
hardworking
Hoosier
taxpayers.
The
budget
deal
also
preserves
the
historic
deficit
reduction
measures
Republicans
won
during
the
2011
Budget
Control
Act
negotiations
and
actually
ensures
we
continue
to
realize
significant
additional
savings
beyond
those
called
for
in
the
2011
agreement.
Moreover,
the
deal
finds
common
sense
spending
reforms
to
replace
the
nearly
$22
billion
in
cuts
to
defense
spending
that
would
have
gone
into
effect
in
January
had
Congress
failed
to
act. These
cuts
would
have
seriously
impacted
our
military
families
and
America&#8217;s
ability
to
defend
itself
from
dangerous
foreign
threats.
Those
who
put
everything
on
the
line
to
defend
our
freedom
should
not
have
to
worry
about
having
the
right
type
of
equipment
or
whether
they&#8217;ll
have
enough
money
to
support
their
families.
A
strong
national
defense
is
in
all
of
our
best
interests.
This
deal
is
not
perfect.
But
the
importance
of
having
a
budget
for
the
first
time
in
four
years
cannot
be
overstated.
With
the
threat
of
government
shutdowns
removed
in
2014,
we
can
now
stop
governing
from
crisis
to
crisis.
With
a
working
budget
Congress
can
begin
to
impose
smarter
spending
priorities
through
the
appropriations
process
rather
than
giving
the
White
House
total
control
of
the
nation&#8217;s
purse
strings.
We
can
also
ensure
the
House
is
able
to
focus
on
its
proper
oversight
duties
in
2014,
most
especially
when
it
comes
to
the
ineffective
implementation
of
Obamacare.
Moving
forward,
there
is
much
more
work
to
be
done
to
put
America
on
a
path
to
fiscal
solvency,
and
I
am
committed
to
doing
that
work.
I
believe
this
is
an
important
first
step
and
I
will
continue
to
advocate
for
more
deficit
reduction
and
a
pathway
to
a
balanced
budget.
I
will
continue
to
push
for
a
more
efficient
government
that
realizes
every
government
dollar
spent
is
a
dollar
someone
else
earned.
I
remain
hopeful
that
Congress
can
make
a
difference
on
these
issues
and
many
more
as
we
head
into
2014.
Thank
you
so
much
for
reading
this
message.
It
has
been
an
honor
to
serve
you
in
Congress
this
year
and
I
wish
you
and
your
family
a
happy
and
joyous
holiday
season.
Best
Wishes,
Susan
