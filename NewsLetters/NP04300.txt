IMMIGRATION REFORM: Just as past presidents used executive orders to move society forward, President Obama used his authority to boldly push the nation ahead on immigration reform last week. I support his actions. For more, click HERE .
FERGUSON GRAND JURY DECISION: These are trying times, and people have a right to protest what they see as an injustice. Protests should be expected, but I urge protesters to remain peaceful. Death, personal injury or property destruction will not right the injustice, nor will it bring Michael Brown back to life. So let's be smart, and let's handle this through the strategy of non-violence. I also urge law enforcement to exercise restraint and to not meet peaceful protesters with a militarized show of force like what we saw in August. For more, click HERE .
[cid:image012.png@01D00964.E5F9FE50]HONORING H.J. RUSSELL: My thoughts and prayers go out to the Russell family. Herman Russell was an old-school family man with old-school values. Hard work, self-reliance, self-discipline and honesty based on strong faith were his hallmarks. Shattering racial barriers while charitably contributing to the greater society, Herman Russell leaves a lasting legacy of service and success. Great life, sir! For more, click HERE .
PASSING THE $40 MILLION MARK: Since taking office in 2007, my office has worked to help secure more than $40 million for constituents seeking help with federal agencies. Helping constituents solve seemingly intractable problems is what my district office does every day. I'm proud that my staff has been able to help so many constituents receive the money and benefits due them from the federal government. Taking care of home first is my number one priority.

OVERCOMERS HOUSE: Overcomers House is holding the Ella Fountain Holiday Basket Giveaway on Saturday, Dec. 20, 2014, at 2 p.m. in Snellville. Baskets include: Turkey, Hen or Ham with trimmings, uncooked. For more, e-mail them at info@myovercomershouse.com .
HEALTHFAIR: I am joining forces with Oakhurst Medical Center and the Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) as the honorary host of the 2nd Annual Local Take on Health. The two-day event will be held at North DeKalb Mall, 2050 Lawrenceville Highway in Decatur on Saturday and Sunday, December 13 and 14 from 12 to 4 p.m. and will feature an "Ask The Doctor" panel featuring Dr. Pamela Roshell from HHS; navigators will be on hand to answer your questions about the Affordable Care Act and help you sign up for health insurance; and a plethora of other free health screenings. For more, click HERE .
NUCLEAR IRAN: It is welcome news that the U.S. and Iranian diplomats have agreed to stay at the negotiating table by extending talks this week trying to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. Now more than ever is the time to commit ourselves to diplomacy. We know the outcome of a rush to war. Too many hardline members and members-elect are already opposing a deal, emboldening hardliners in Iran. What the hardliners do not say is that failure to reach a deal clears the path to war.

EBOLA INFO GUIDE: In addition to posting an Ebola information section on my website, we now have a Fourth District Ebola Information & Resources Guide as well. For more, click HERE .

Dear
F riends,
I want to wish you and your family a Happy Thanksgiving. I&#8217;m back in town this week meeting with constituents, and I&#8217;m looking forward to spending Thanksgiving with my family as well.
I thoroughly enjoyed participating in our service academy interviews for prospective Fourth District students who are applying to attend a military academy. I was also honored to give keynote speeches at both the A.D. King Youth Empowerment
Awards Gala and the annual meeting of the Georgia Chapter of the Association of Physicians of Pakistani Descent of North America (APPNA).
On Thursday, Nov. 20, I was pleased to join Commissioner Stan Watson in honoring seven of our community leaders during the Trail Blazer Awards at the Porter Sanford Center. It was good to hear the honorees speak from the dais and share
their stories of success and struggles &#8211; overcoming obstacles only makes us stronger, and their leadership serves as the ultimate example to all of us.
This year&#8217;s honorees were: Architect R.L. Brown, community activist Alvin Dollar, former School Board Chair Frances Edwards, the Rev. Dr. Cynthia Hale, political and arts activist Jan Selman, educator Ralph Simpson, and Superintendent Michael
Thurmond. For more, click
