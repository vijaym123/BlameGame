Increasing food stamp benefits for Rota and Tinian was the focus of my meeting this week with Ms. Audrey Rowe, who is in charge of all Department of Agriculture food and nutrition programs. The Commonwealth has collected data on food costs; and I have been encouraging Rowe's agency to use that information as a basis for approving higher benefits. I asked Administrator Rowe to make a final decision on Rota and Tinian benefits this month, if possible.
Better food stamp benefits for Rota and Tinian is next goal - Now that the $32.5 million SNAP pilot program for the Northern Mariana Islands is law, I am turning to the outstanding issue of increasing food stamp benefits for families on Rota and Tinian. Food costs, especially on Rota, are much higher than on Saipan, yet monthly food stamp benefits are the same throughout the Commonwealth. I think benefits should be higher where costs are high. I met this week with Ms. Audrey Rowe, Administrator of the Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service, to continue making the case for Rota and Tinian. The Commonwealth has already provided her agency with the necessary data on comparative food costs, so it is time to make a decision. We also discussed implementation of the $32.5 million pilot program, which begins with a study of whether the national SNAP food stamp program will fit the Northern Marianas or should be modified for our special circumstances. A request for proposals to do that work should go out shortly. The study and report to Congress will take about a year to complete.

Officials from GAO, the Government Accountability Office, briefed me on their latest report on the economy of the Northern Marianas since minimum wage began to increase to the federal level. There have been five increases from the CNMI wage of $3.05 per hour in 2007 to the current federal wage of $5.55 per hour. The wage is scheduled to increase again on October 1 to $6.05 per hour. Pictured left to right: Emil Friberg, Assistant Director, Michael Simon, Senior Analyst, and David Gootnick, Director from GAO's Division of International Affairs and Trade.
GAO: minimum wage workers staying ahead of price increases - The Government Accountability Office issued its latest report on the impact of minimum wage
increases on the Northern Mariana Islands economy on Monday. Among the findings: wages for minimum wage workers in the NMI went up 39 percent faster than prices from 2006 to 2012. Wages for all workers, though, slipped 2 percent during the same period. The economy lost jobs, mostly before 2009 because of the closure of the garment industry. GAO said it could not isolate the minimum wage increases from other factors affecting jobs, such as the global economy, energy prices, and the application of U.S. immigration law to the Commonwealth. So far, the "do no harm" policy of skipping the annual 50 minimum wage hikes in 2011 and 2013 seems to have helped steady the economy. Wages will go up to $6.05 on October 1 this year, skip 2015, then stay on track until we reach the federal minimum of $7.25 in 2018. If the national wage goes up to $10.10, as I support, then the wage in the Commonwealth will keep rising beyond 2018, 50 each year until we reach the U.S. wage level.

Interior Secretary Sally Jewell and I chatted before the Natural Resources Committee hearing on her Department's fiscal year 2015 budget proposal. During the hearing I asked the Secretary to speed up the co-management agreement governing federal and Commonwealth submerged lands in the Islands Unit of the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument.
Interior budget hearing is opportunity to press for Islands Unit co-management agreement - After signing over the oil, gas, and mineral rights around the Northern Mariana Islands to the Commonwealth government last month, the next step for the Interior Department is to complete a co-management agreement with the Commonwealth for the submerged lands in the Islands Unit of the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument. At this week's Natural Resources Committee hearing on Interior's fiscal year 2015 budge, I pressed Secretary Sally Jewell for a timeframe for completion. The Secretary responded that she has already directed Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service to complete an agreement. She also testified on the President's budget proposal
to increase assistance to territories by $3 million and provide an additional $1.8 million to improve safety conditions in insular schools, both changes I support.

$4 million for NMI military cleanups this year - $4 million has been allotted for clean-up of formerly used defense sites in the Northern Mariana Islands this year. I worked to obtain a robust appropriation for the Defense Environmental Restoration Program , which is the source of the funding. FUDS, as they are known, were contaminated by military activity during and after World War II. The Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for doing the cleanup. The four projects for fiscal year 2014 are:
*
Marpi Point Field: $2.645 million. A study will determine the extent and types of unexploded ordinances on property that the CNMI Department of Public Lands wants to use for homesteads.
*
Hospital Dumpsite: $985,000. The dumpsite is located at the Kingfisher Golf Course. A study will determine the extent of contamination and whether there is any risk to human health.
*
Tanapag Fuel Farm: $348,000. This project consists of the removal of 17 above-ground fuel storage tanks and then a study of any remaining contamination.
There are still five other FUDS sites in the Northern Marianas that require remediation: Koblerville Naval Supply Center, Naftan Bomb Storage, Naftan Ordnance Disposal, Northfield, and Ordnance Plan.

California shark fin law not at odds with federal fishing laws - A federal district court in the Northern District of California has upheld California's ban
on the possession or sale of shark fins. The Court held that the California ban does not conflict with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the primary federal law governing management of our nation's fisheries. This is significant because the Commonwealth and ten other U.S. states and territories have enacted similar laws. Last year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration proposed a rule on shark fishing that could preempt these state and territorial laws. In response, I joined Rep. Jared Huffman (D-California), who wrote the California shark fin law as a Member of the State Assembly, to protest the proposal . NOAA has reached agreement with the states of Maryland, Washington, and California on how to conform local and federal law on this issue. NOAA reports that it is still in discussion with the Commonwealth and the remaining states and territories.

$234,640 grant awarded for Assistance Programs for Chronic Disease Prevention and Control - The U.S. Department of the Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has awarded $234,640 to the Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation. The grant will be used for prevention and control of diabetes, tobacco use, heart disease, and associated chronic disease risk factors. Congratulations to the Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation.
