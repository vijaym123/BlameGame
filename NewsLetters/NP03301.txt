Tuition and Scholarship Fair
I am hosting a Tuition and Scholarship Fair on Saturday, January 31, 2015 from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. at Westminster High School. This is a great opportunity to learn about scholarships, resources from colleges, and how to plan, apply and pay for college.
I hope to see you there!
Thoughts on the President&rsquo;s State of the Union Address
Though I couldn't be there in person, I watched President Obama unveil a pro-growth agenda aimed at helping hardworking middle class families in Colorado.
Policies which will help working families the most are enhancing American manufacturing, making home buying and college more affordable, and providing workers paid sick and family leave.
This Congress will be presented with many opportunities including fixing our broken immigration system, investing in infrastructure, making education accessible and affordable, and promoting American ingenuity.
I look forward to working with my colleagues on these proposals to help my constituents across the 7th Congressional District and across our nation.

The Importance of Community Health Centers
Community Health Centers are a lifeline for many throughout Colorado. These facilities are invaluable assets, and make a significant difference in the individual lives and communities they serve.
Without action by Congress, the Community Health Center fund is set to expire in September 2015, which would reduce health centers&rsquo; federal funding by 60-7%.
Ed met with staff and toured Clinica Family Health Services in Thornton last week .
This potential reduction in federal funding could result in the closure of health center sites, layoffs of providers and staff, and a loss of preventive care for millions of patients who often have no other place to turn.
We must continue supporting Community Health Centers to ensure existing and new patients can continue to access the care they need. Since 2002, health centers have expanded health care access from 11 million patients to 22 million patients. Currently, more than 1,200 locally-controlled health centers operate in 9,000 urban and rural underserved communities nationwide. Health centers provide primary care, dental, behavioral
health, pharmacy and a variety of support services, and help prevent individuals from having to visit the emergency room or use more expensive services. I&rsquo;m honored the National Association of Community Health Centers (NACHC) recognized me as their 2014 Distinguished Advocate for my support of health centers and their role in preserving and expanding access to high-quality cost-effective care.
