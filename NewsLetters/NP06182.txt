40 Plus and Counting...
Dear Friend,
On Thursday, the House wrapped up our legislative business before returning home to spend time in-district with those who send us to Washington. Since this Congress began, House Republicans have been working non-stop on solutions to help Americans find work and increase our standard of living.
Last week, we added two more to our Jobs Bills collection. I proudly supported H.R. 2,
The
American Energy Solutions for Lower Costs and More American Jobs Act.
This important legislation is a compilation of energy bills aimed to boost Americas energy independence and create jobs in the process.
Since 2009, the Obama Administration has delayed the Presidential approval permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline citing unproven environmental concerns.
One key component of this legislation removes the Presidents influence and allows for Keystones completion. Approving this project should be a no-brainer as experts have projected that 100,000 shovel-ready jobs would be created once we move forward. Michelin Tire Corporation in Lexington and MTU Diesel in Aiken County would add more jobs as well. Other provisions in this piece of legislation help to reduce energy prices so that American families can keep more of their hard earned paychecks.
We also passed H.R. 4,
the Jobs for America Act , which is a common-sense approach to spur job creation across America.
Unfortunately, high unemployment and living paycheck to paycheck has become the new status quo as a result of the Presidents failed economic policies.
This bill cuts red tape and regulations, simplifies our tax code, and makes permanent certain tax provisions that will give our job creators the flexibility they need to begin hiring again.
House Republicans have solutions, and its time for the Senate to bring the 40 plus bills up for a vote instead of leaving them in the Senate graveyard. Here are some of the jobs-creating solutions that are awaiting action in the other Chamber:
H.R. 5,
The Student Success Act
- Empowers parents, supports effective teacher, and restores local control.
H.R. 2879, The
Stop Government Abuse Act
- Provides small business owners with tools to protect against government harassment.
H.R. 3474,
Hire More Heroes Act
- Makes it easier to hire veterans by exempting those with existing coverage from ObamaCares employer mandate.
H. Con. Res. 96,
The Path to Prosperity Budget
- Cuts spending &amp; implements pro-growth reforms that boost job creation.
H.R. 4457,
America's Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2014
- Permanently allows small business to immediately deduct the cost of purchasing new equipment.
H.R. 3393,
The Student and Family Tax Simplification Act
- Streamlines existing education tax credits to make it easier for families to plan, save and invest in education.
