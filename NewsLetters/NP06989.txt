Friend,
I wanted to take the time to thank you for your support this week - in the wake of the news that Karl Rove&#39;s political group is already running $900,000 worth of negative attack ads in our district, you really stepped up. You fought back. I&#39;m grateful.
Your support helped us to create our own ad -
click here to watch it, and if you agree with our message, give $5 or more to help us get it in front of voters.
This battle is far from over, and Rove&#39;s ads will continue to run throughout the district, multiple times a day, for at least the next week.
These commercials started extremely early, and shadowy outside groups will just keep buying more attack ads in our district.
That&#39;s why grassroots supporters like you are so important - you&#39;re my first line of defense. If you haven&#39;t yet, click here to help us continue to fight back.
Thank you again for everything you do for this campaign.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
PS - The Rove ads are up and running - you may have seen them on the air yourself over the last few days.
