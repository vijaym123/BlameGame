Dear David,
As you know,
President Obama and his administration have a very bad habit of ignoring the
law and the Constitution. That's why this week, I'm traveling across
our state to talk with Missourians who have been impacted by the Obama
Administration's executive over-reach and burdensome regulations. I'll
also keep calling on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (Nev.) to allow
a vote on the "ENFORCE The Law Act," a bill I
introduced
to help allow Congress to hold the president accountable for
failing to faithfully execute the laws.
Whether we're talking about President Obama's threats to take
executive action on immigration, the EPA's blatant executive regulatory
over-reach, HHS cherry-picking which ObamaCare provisions to enforce and
which to delay - this administration's continued executive over-reach
has a real impact on Missouri families and workers. President Obama is
not above the Constitution, and Congress should hold him accountable
for ignoring the law.
