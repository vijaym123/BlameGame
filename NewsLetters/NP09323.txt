Congressional Report -- Week of May 19-23: Holding the VA
Accountable
Hello Friend,
This was a wild week in Washington. The House passed the National
Defense Authorization Act of 2015. This is the bill that governs the
operations of the Defense Department and of national security programs
in the Department of Energy. In addition, the burgeoning scandal at the
Department of Veterans' Affairs took center stage.
These two things kept me busy, but I never forget that I work for
people at home. Several folks from the 23rd District of Texas also
stopped by to visit. As is my practice, I dropped whatever else I was
doing to meet with visiting constituents. After all, they are my bosses.
Thursday afternoon I headed back to Texas. I was pretty excited to see
a little rain in Alpine as I got home on Thursday night. I made a trip
to Presidio and Ojinaga to underscore the importance of the
international cattle crossing there. Dealing with the U.S. Department
of Agriculture on this issue has been frustrating - and that's putting
it mildly.
On this trip I also made stops in Marfa, Fabens and El Paso. Field
Representatives were also busy. They visited Fort Stockton, Grandfalls,
Monahans, Pecos, Marfa, Presidio, Fabens, Carrizo Springs, Eagle Pass,
Brackettville, Del Rio, and various areas in San Antonio. I am really
proud that our offices reach out to and touch base with communities in
the 23rd District of Texas on a regular basis.

National Defense Authorization Act Passes House
On Thursday I voted for the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)
of 2015. The act sets policies for the Department of Defense and the
national security programs now housed in the Department of Energy. The
bill passed by a bipartisan vote of 325 to 98.
This legislation marks the 53rd year in a row that the House Armed
Services Committee, which I am a member of, has reached a bipartisan
agreement on national defense policies and priorities. Not many
committees in the U.S. Congress can say that they have such a long
history of harmonious cooperation. As a new member of Congress, I was
proud to contribute to that tradition.
Unfortunately, the legislation only buys us a little time. Unless
Congress provides relief from the policy known as sequestration, next
year's decisions will be exponentially more difficult. For more on the
NDAA, click here
.
Holding the VA Accountable
On Wednesday I voted in favor of the Veterans Affairs Management
Accountability Act of 2014. The bill gives the VA greater authority to
fire or remove employees due to poor or inappropriate performance. This
bill sends a clear message to the VA, its employees and its leadership -
hiding, lying or misrepresenting facts is wrong and will not be
tolerated. Anyone found to be doing or have done wrong to our country's
veterans should be fired. We cannot play with the lives and health of
those who served our country - that's unacceptable.
The bill passed the House by a bipartisan vote of 390 to 33. For more
on this bill, click here
.
Recently, I hosted a small-business roundtable at The University of
Texas at San Antonio.
USDA Inspection Station in Ojinaga
On Friday I was in Presidio, Texas, and Ojinaga, Chihuahua, Mexico, to
announce plans to re-open the U.S. Department of Agriculture inspection
station. I was joined by the mayors of both cities for this important
announcement.
The inspection station, which closed in mid-August 2012, is critical to
the economy of Southwest Texas. Not too long ago, Ojinaga/Presidio was
the number one cattle-crossing port in the country. Thousands of cattle
were processed at the station and then sold throughout North America.
The station helped create jobs - both in Mexico and the U.S. - and
boost our region's economy. It is a critical lifeline for the
community. I'm glad that lifeline will be reopening.
I will continue to work with the USDA to re-open a safe and secure
inspection station. For more information on this, click here
.
May Is Physical Fitness and Sports Month
Obesity is one of the biggest challenges facing our society. May is a
good month to combat that because it's National Physical Fitness and
Sports Month.
Being active is an important part of fighting obesity and living a long
and healthy life. Before running for Congress, I'd started running half
marathons and training for a full one, and I'd never felt better.
Whether you walk, run or play sports, being active is something that
clears your mind and is fun and enjoyable. For more on National
Physical Fitness and Sports Month, click here
.
Lastly, I want as always to say thanks for letting me be your
congressman. It is a huge privilege and one I never take for granted.
If can help you with a federal agency or issue, please call on any of
our offices. The phone numbers and addresses are listed below. I've
never been a big fan of politics - so helping people is my favorite
part of the job. Please put us to work for you.
Sincerely,
Pete P. Gallego

Congressional
Report --
Week
of
May
19-23:
Holding
the
VA
Accountable Hello
Friend,
This
was
a
wild
week
in
Washington.
The
House
passed
the
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
of
2015.
This
is
the

In

the
burgeoning
scandal
at
the
Department
of

Affairs
took
center
stage.
These
two
things
kept
me
busy,
but
I
never
forget
that
I
work
for
people
at
home.
Several
folks
from
the
23rd
District
of
Texas
also
stopped
by
to
visit.
As
is
my
practice,
I
dropped
whatever
else
I
was
doing

On

Marfa,
Presidio,
Fabens,
Carrizo
Springs,
Eagle
Pass,
Brackettville,
Del
Rio,
and
various
areas
in
San
Antonio.
I
am
really
proud
that
our
offices
reach
out
to
and
touch
base
with
communities
in
the
23rd

of
Texas
on

is

Ojinaga/Presidio

Thousands
of
cattle

The

helped

both
in

and
boost
