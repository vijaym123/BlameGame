House Oversight Committee Field Hearing in Richardson
ObamaCare Implementation: Who Are The Navigators?
As you may remember, undercover videos were released in November
that
showed ObamaCare navigators from two different locations in North Texas
encouraging applicants to lie on their health insurance applications in
order to avoid higher premiums, to remain eligible for premium
subsidies, and to avoid audit.
An additional video of a navigator
encouraging individuals to commit fraud emerged from Houston, Texas,
later in the month.
In response, I asked that the House Committee on Oversight and
Government Reform hold a field hearing in North Texas to investigate
the navigator program.
I'm delighted to share that the Committee has
agreed to this request and that I will be participating in the hearing
with House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa and several other
Members of Congress.
I hope that you will be able to join us.
ObamaCare Implementation: Who Are The Navigators?
Monday, December 16, 2013
1:30pm
Charles W. Eisemann Center
2351 Performance Drive
Richardson, Texas 75082
*This field hearing is open to the public. Please note that
participation is limited to the panel and witnesses during official
congressional hearings.
Even before enrollment in the federal health insurance exchanges began,
many questions were raised about the navigator program. It is my hope
that this field hearing will allow us to gain a deeper understanding of
the navigator program, including its employee training and vetting
processes, and to get to the bottom of these examples of fraud and
abuse.
In order to accommodate attendees, please RSVP to let us know that you
are coming to next week's hearing.
Have a great day.
Sincerely,
Pete Sessions
Member of Congress
