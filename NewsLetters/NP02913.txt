Voting to Repeal
Obamacare
2/3/15
Today,
Congressman Lamborn voted in favor of H.R. 596 to repeal
Obamacare.
Obamacare was
enacted in March of 2010 and
contains:
Over $1 trillion in new taxes, $1.8
trillion in new spending and over $700 billion in cuts to
Medicare.
The law
creates for the first time an individual mandate for Americans to purchase
government approved health insurance and an employer mandate forcing
businesses with more 50 full time employees to offer
government-approved health
insurance.
The legislation forced states to expand their Medicaid
programs, although the Supreme Court found that provision
unconstitutional, so states now can choose whether to expand the program to cover
individuals up to 138 percent of the poverty
level.
Individuals with incomes
between 100 and 400 percent of poverty who purchase insurance through
state-based exchanges may be eligible for tax credits and cost-sharing
subsidies provided certain conditions are met.
For example, the
individual must not be eligible for Medicaid or CHIP and may not have
an offer employer-sponsored
insurance.
"Obamacare is a horrible piece
of legislation that I have opposed since the very beginning. It has
harmed and disrupted the lives and personal healthcare decisions of
millions of Americans. Obamacare has been filed with lies, distortions,
and misleading information from day one. It is past time for this big
government monstrosity to be repealed and replaced with
patient-centered, free market solutions. That's why I pushed leadership hard to
schedule this vote. People want a change in Washington's culture, that's
what you deserve, and that's what I am supporting with my vote
today."
