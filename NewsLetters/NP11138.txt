Dear
Friend,
A nationwide high school arts competition is
sponsored by the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives each
spring to recognize and encourage the artistic talent of their young
constituents across the nation. More than 650,000 high school students
have participated in the Congressional Art Competition since it began in
1982.
Each year, a winner is
chosen from each congressional district across the country and their
winning artwork is on display for one year in the U.S. Capitol. Last
year,
Circles of Rust , by Violette Bruchon, was the winning
entry from the 2nd District.
