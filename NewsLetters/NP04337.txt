Friends,
After a hard fought campaign and a lengthy ballot counting process - the race has been called. I&#39;m proud and honored to say - we won.
WE won.
This victory is not mine. It belongs to all of you. To the volunteers who
knocked more than 250,000 doors
and
made more than 950,000 phone calls.
To the grassroots supporters who showed the outside interests that the people&#39;s voice cannot be bought with money - that this community belongs to you and no one else. To everyone who stuck with us, even 15 days after Election Day.
This victory belongs to you.
When I was elected, I came to Congress with you in mind. I was determined to work across the aisle for the betterment of our community. That was my goal, and I strove every day to live up to it - I will continue to do so.
Despite the hardships that we&#39;ve faced as a country in the past few years, I remain hopeful. We ARE making progress.
And trust me, it won&#39;t be the Members of Congress who make the ultimate difference - it will be you.
By joining your voices together and speaking out about issues that matter, you ARE making a difference. And if we stick together, I believe we can make Washington, D.C. the place it was intended to be - a place of service.
Thank you. I am honored and humbled that you&#39;ve entrusted me to represent you for another two years. I am grateful, and I won&#39;t let you down.
Today is just the beginning. Let&#39;s continue the work.
Be well,
Ami
