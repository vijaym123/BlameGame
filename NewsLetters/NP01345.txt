Kansas Common Sense
April 20, 2015
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." More than usual, it was a productive
week in Washington, D.C. Thank you for your continued interest in
receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
Advocating for Fort Riley During Army Briefings with Military and
Veterans Advisory Committee at Pentagon
I had a useful meeting at the Pentagon this week to discuss all-things
Army in Kansas with members from my Military and Veterans Advisory
Committee, Secretary of the Army John M. McHugh and several Army
Assistant Secretaries. Fort Riley was the primary topic of conversation
given the Army is assessing potential force reductions at military
installations across the country as a result of the Budget Control Act
of 2011.
I am pleased to report that the Army has a clear understanding of the
military value at Fort Riley in training space, deploying capability
and supporting the American soldier with an excellent quality of life.
This was underscored by the Army's investment in military construction
on Fort Riley since 2005. From housing to education and health care,
the $1.8 billion in investments to the infrastructure on Fort Riley
over the last decade equates to half of the total Army budget on
military construction today. I feel confident the Army considers Fort
Riley a significant asset and will thoughtfully analyze the value Fort
Riley offers soldiers, their families and the Army in defense of our
nation.
Members of my Military and Veterans Advisory Committee in attendance
included:
*	John G. Montgomery, Junction City. Civilian Aide Emeritus to
the Secretary of the Army;
*	Mark Edwards, Junction City. Civilian Aide to the Secretary of
the Army;
*	John Armbrust, Manhattan. Colonel, U.S. Air Force (retired),
Governor's Military Council Executive Director;
*	Tod Bunting, Berryton. Major General, Kansas National Guard,
Adjutant General of Kansas (retired);
*	Robert E. Durbin, formerly of Junction City, Kan., now of
McLean, Va. Lieutenant General, U.S. Army (retired), Former Commanding
General of the 1st Infantry Division at Fort Riley;
*	Robert Ulin, Lansing. Colonel, U.S. Army (retired), former head
of the Command and General Staff College Foundation; and
*	Tim Rogers, Salina. Salina Airport Authority Executive
Director, A.A.E.
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Passes Iran Nuclear Agreement Review
Act
On Tuesday the Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously approved
the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 (S. 615), bipartisan
legislation to provide Congress with the power to review a final
nuclear deal with Iran.
After attending a classified briefing with Secretary of State John
Kerry this week, I continue to have serious worries about the
consequences of the nuclear negotiations. Given these concerns, we
should be encouraged by the work of the Foreign Relations Committee and
the promise of Congressional review. There must be an opportunity to
review and evaluate any nuclear deal the Obama administration might
strike with Iran. The stakes are too high for Americans for their
representative in Congress to be denied a say on this critical issue.
Senate Passes Permanent Medicare Physician Payment Reform
To preserve medical access for Kansans, physicians and other health
care providers must receive appropriate Medicare reimbursement for the
care they provide. On Tuesday evening, I voted in favor of H.R. 2, the
Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act, to permanently repeal the
broken Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula, which has
dictated how Medicare pays physicians. This legislation passed the
Senate 92-8 with strong, bipartisan support after the House of
Representatives passed the identical measure by a 392-37 vote last
month. I am glad that Congress has finally come together to permanently
address this issue.
More than a decade of short-term "SGR patches" have frustrated health
care providers, threatened access for Medicare beneficiaries, and
created budgetary problems for Congress. During this time, Congress has
allocated nearly $150 billion on temporary patches that did not address
the fundamental problems with the SGR. I did not support the formula
when it was created and have long urged Congress to permanently repeal
and replace the flawed SGR. Click here
to view my recent
remarks on the Senate floor about the urgent need to permanently
address this problem.
Inadequate and uncertain reimbursements can discourage providers from
seeing Medicare patients. Reimbursement problems may also force
providers to close their doors altogether. This jeopardizes patients'
access to health care in Kansas where our hospitals, physicians,
nurses, therapists, and other medical professionals care for an
increasingly aging population across a wide area. The reality is that
patient care suffers when providers are uncertain as to what amount the
government will reimburse them for the care they provide. Passage of
H.R. 2 is good news for patients, providers, and Kansas communities.
Ending "Tax Day" with the FairTax
For many Americans, April 15 each year is the source of countless
headaches and anxiety brought on by our complex tax code and the
scandalized Internal Revenue Service (IRS) - but it doesn't have to be
this way. In order to boost economic growth and give the American
people more control over their lives, I have introduced the Fair Tax
Act of 2015 (S. 155). This legislation, based on the tax system known
as the "FairTax," would put an end to the burdensome tax filing process
each year and close the IRS once and for all.
The FairTax would replace our outdated tax code with a simple and fair
system based on a flat national consumption tax. By eliminating the
federal income tax and the multitude of loopholes, exemptions and
credits, we can create a fundamentally fairer system that boosts growth
and incentivizes savings and investment. In addition, businesses would
have the certainty and confidence to hire more workers and focus their
resources on innovating and growing the American economy.
While overhauling our tax code is not an easy undertaking, the economic
need for a leaner, pro-growth system has never been greater. It is long
past time for a simplified tax code that cuts the waste and gives our
country a competitive advantage in the global economy. The Fair Tax Act
deserves to be heard in a committee setting, debated and given and up
or down vote. Together, we can end "Tax Day" for good. Click here

this week on the FairTax and learn more.
VA Wants to Raid Choice Act Funds for Denver VA Hospital Construction
The Department of Veterans Affairs sent a legislative proposal
to Congress this week seeking to use nearly $1
billion dollars in funds from the Choice Act to pay for the ballooning
price of a new VA medical center under construction in Denver, Colo.,
which is five times over budget. Just this week, the Washington Post
reported
that the
construction of the VA hospital east of Denver is "riddled with
mistakes and cost overruns."
The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 (Choice
Act) was passed by Congress in July 2014 to provide veterans with
greater choice and flexibility in health care providers and increasing
accountability and transparency at the VA. The Choice Act is not a
cookie jar for the VA to raid as it sees fit. If the President is truly
focused on fixing the VA, why is his administration proposing to raid
emergency funds provided by Congress to support greater access to
health care for veterans? The over-budget and behind-schedule Denver
project is a catastrophic failure of VA's own making. As a member of
the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee and the Senate Committee on
Appropriations I cannot sit by and watch emergency funds intended to
make VA medical facilities nationwide more efficient and hire
desperately-needed physicians and medical staff - like the Topeka
Emergency Room and Liberal Community-Based Outpatient Clinic - be used
to clean up this mess.
Thousands of rural veterans in states like Kansas still can't get the
timely VA care the Choice Act promised and are being forced to travel
long distances to VA hospitals to access the services they need because
the VA facility within 40 miles of their home cannot provide the care.
The request to transfer much-needed Choice Act funds away from their
intended use is just one more piece of evidence of the VA's
unwillingness and lack of interest in implementing the Choice Act.
Addressing the Enduring Wounds of War - Toxic Exposure Research Act of
2015
On Tuesday, I led the reintroduction of critical bipartisan, bicameral
legislation focused on supporting the research of health conditions
faced by descendants of veterans who were exposed to toxins during
their military service - the Toxic Exposure Research Act of 2015 (S.
901). As in the 113th Congress, U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal
(D-Conn.), along with U.S. Representatives Dan Benishek, M.D. (R-Mich.)
and Mike Honda (D-Calif.), are cosponsors of this legislation and
joined me in taking this necessary step toward making certain our
military men and women and their descendants will be properly cared for
in the future.
Many of the symptoms from toxic exposure are frequently misdiagnosed in
descendants of veterans due to a lack of understanding and scientific
proof. However, veterans have observed increased levels of cancers,
birth defects and other conditions in their subsequent generations. The
evidence of these wounds of war afflicting the children and
grandchildren of service members exposed to toxins is growing and
research is warranted to collect data and study this issue. The Toxic
Exposure Research Act of 2015 would establish a national center at a
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facility for research on
the diagnosis and treatment of health conditions of the descendants of
individuals exposed to toxic substances during their time in service.
Such toxic substances that include Agent Orange in Vietnam, Gulf War
neurotoxins, Iraq and Afghanistan chemical weapons and burn pits as
well as other chemicals and toxins. The goal of this medical research
is to determine the conditions that result from debilitating toxins and
hopefully lead to the appropriate support and benefits veterans and
family members deserve. Over the past few years, Kansans have held
several town halls across the state in conjunction with the Vietnam
Veterans of America (VVA) to address this issue and raise awareness.
I'm proud that many Kansans recognize this important issue and I'm
pleased this the Toxic Exposure Research Act of 2015 is overwhelmingly
supported by the VVA in addition to AMVETS, the American Legion,
Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), Rolling Thunder and the Iraq and
Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA).
The Toxic Exposure Research Act is about addressing the painful,
enduring wounds of war that may impact a service member's family long
after the military operation is over - wounds that may not be evident
until decades later when passed on to children and generations to
follow. We must keep our promise to our veterans and their families,
who have made great sacrifices for the sake of our country's security
and our freedom. Click here

Greeting the Kansas Honor Flight at the WWII Memorial
I was happy to greet an Honor Flight of World War II veterans from
Rooks County on Thursday at the World War II Memorial in Washington,
D.C. These veterans who served our country in World War II represent
the best of American ideals. I am always reminded when I visit the
World War II, Korean and Vietnam Memorials that these men and women
answered the call of duty in their country's time of need because they
believed in America. They served and sacrificed for the principles of
our Founding Fathers, as well as the liberties and freedoms they
provide.
Our country owes our veterans a great debt and it was a pleasure to
welcome these veterans as they visited the World War II Memorial that
was built in their honor. I am thankful for the service of our veterans
and I will continue my work on their behalf, ensuring that they receive
the benefits they have earned.

Advocating
for
Fort
Riley
During
Army
Briefings
with
Military

I
had
a
useful
meeting
at
the

this

to
discuss
all-things
Army
in
Kansas
with
members
from
my
Military
and
Veterans
Advisory

Secretary
of
the
Army
John
M.

Fort

was
the

the
Army

assessing
potential

military
value
at
Fort

in
training
space,

This

I

this

I
continue
to
have
serious

Given
these

we
should
be
encouraged
by
the

Senate
Passes
Permanent
Medicare
Physician
Payment
Reform
To
preserve
medical
access
for
Kansans,
physicians
and
other
health
care
providers
must
receive
appropriate
Medicare
reimbursement
for
the
care
they
provide.
On
Tuesday
evening,
I
voted
in
favor
of
H.R.
2,
the
Medicare
Access
and
CHIP
Reauthorization
Act,
to
permanently
repeal
the
broken
Medicare
Sustainable
Growth
Rate
(SGR)
formula,
which
has
dictated
how
Medicare
pays
physicians.
This
legislation
passed
the
Senate
92-8
with
strong,
bipartisan
support
after
the
House
of
Representatives
passed
the
identical
measure
by
a
392-37
vote
last
month. I
am
glad
that
Congress
has
finally
come
together
to
permanently
address
this
issue.
More
than
a
decade
of
short-term
"SGR
patches"
have
frustrated
health
care
providers,
threatened
access
for
Medicare
beneficiaries,
and
created
budgetary
problems
for
Congress. During
this
time,
Congress
has
allocated
nearly
$150
billion
on
temporary
patches
that
did
not
address
the
fundamental
problems
with
the
SGR. I
did
not
support
the
formula
when
it
was
created
and
have
long
urged
Congress
to
permanently
repeal
and
replace
the
flawed
SGR.
Click
here
to
view
my
recent
remarks
on
the
Senate
floor
about
the
urgent
need
to
permanently
address
this
problem.
Inadequate
and
uncertain
reimbursements
can
discourage
providers
from
seeing
Medicare
patients. Reimbursement
problems
may
also
force
providers
to
close
their
doors
altogether. This
jeopardizes
patients'
access
to
health
care
in
Kansas
where
our
hospitals,
physicians,
nurses,
therapists,
and
other
medical
professionals
care
for
an
increasingly
aging
population
across
a
wide
area. The
reality
is
that
patient
care
suffers
when
providers
are
uncertain
as
to
what
amount
the
government
will
reimburse
them
for
the
care
they
provide.
Passage
of
H.R.
2
is
good
news
for
patients,
providers,
and
Kansas
communities.
Ending
"Tax
Day"
with
the
FairTax
For
many
Americans,
April
15
each
year
is
the
source
of
countless
headaches
and
anxiety
brought
on
by
our
complex
tax
code
and
the
scandalized
Internal
Revenue
Service
(IRS)
&ndash; but
it
doesn't
have
to
be
this
way.
In
order
to
boost
economic
growth
and
give
the
American
people
more
control
over
their
lives,
I
have
introduced
the
Fair
Tax
Act
of
2015
(S.
155).
This
legislation,
based
on
the
tax
system
known
as
the
"FairTax,"
would
put
an
end
to
the
burdensome
tax
filing
process
each
year
and
close
the
IRS
once
and
for
all.
The
FairTax
would
replace
our
outdated
tax
code
with
a
simple
and
fair
system
based
on
a
flat
national
consumption
tax.
By
eliminating
the
federal
income
tax
and
the
multitude
of
loopholes,
exemptions
and
credits,
we
can
create
a
fundamentally
fairer
system
that
boosts
growth
and
incentivizes
savings
and
investment.
In
addition,
businesses
would
have
the
certainty
and
confidence
to
hire
more
workers
and
focus
their
resources
on
innovating
and
growing
the
American
economy.
While
overhauling
our
tax
code
is
not
an
easy
undertaking,
the
economic
need
for
a
leaner,
pro-growth
system
has
never
been
greater.
It
is
long
past
time
for
a
simplified
tax
code
that
cuts
the
waste
and
gives
our
country
a
competitive
advantage
in
the
global
economy.
The
Fair
Tax
Act
deserves
to
be
heard
in
a
committee
setting,
debated
and
given
and
up
or
down
vote.
Together,
we
can
end
"Tax
Day"
for
good.

VA
Wants
to
Raid
Choice
Act
Funds
for
Denver
VA
Hospital
Construction
The
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
sent
a
legislative
proposal
to
Congress
this
week
seeking
to
use
nearly
$1
billion
dollars
in
funds
from
the
Choice
Act
to
pay
for
the
ballooning
price
of
a
new
VA
medical
center
under
construction
in
Denver,
Colo.,
which
is
five
times
over
budget.
Just
this
week,
the
Washington
Post
reported
that
the
construction
of
the
VA
hospital
east
of
Denver
is
"riddled
with
mistakes
and
cost
overruns."
The
Veterans
Access,
Choice,
and
Accountability
Act
of
2014
(Choice
Act)
was
passed
by
Congress
in
July
2014
to
provide
veterans
with
greater
choice
and
flexibility
in
health
care
providers
and
increasing
accountability
and
transparency
at
the
VA .
The
Choice
Act
is
not
a
cookie
jar
for
the
VA
to
raid
as
it
sees
fit.
If
the
President
is
truly
focused
on
fixing
the
VA,
why
is
his
administration
proposing
to
raid
emergency
funds
provided
by
Congress
to
support
greater
access
to
health
care
for
veterans?
The
over-budget
and
behind-schedule
Denver
project
is
a
catastrophic
failure
of
VA's
own
making.
As
a
member
of
the
Senate
Veterans'
Affairs
Committee
and
the
Senate
Committee
on
Appropriations
I
cannot
sit
by
and
watch
emergency
funds
intended
to
make
VA
medical
facilities
nationwide
more
efficient
and
hire
desperately-needed
physicians
and
medical
staff
&ndash;
like
the
Topeka
Emergency
Room
and
Liberal
Community-Based
Outpatient
Clinic
&ndash;
be
used
to
clean
up
this
mess.
Thousands
of
rural
veterans
in
states
like
Kansas
still
can't
get
the
timely
VA
care
the
Choice
Act
promised
and
are
being
forced
to
travel
long
distances
to
VA
hospitals
to
access
the
services
they
need
because
the
VA
facility
within
40
miles
of
their
home
cannot
provide
the
care.
The
request
to
transfer
much-needed
Choice
Act
funds
away
from
their
intended
use
is
just
one
more
piece
of
evidence
of
the
VA's
unwillingness
and
lack
of
interest
in
implementing
the
Choice
Act.
Addressing
the
Enduring
Wounds
of
War
&ndash;
Toxic
Exposure
Research
Act
of
2015
On
Tuesday,
I
led
the
reintroduction
of
critical
bipartisan,
bicameral
legislation
focused
on
supporting
the
research
of
health
conditions
faced
by
descendants
of
veterans
who
were
exposed
to
toxins
during
their
military
service
&ndash;
the
Toxic
Exposure
Research
Act
of
2015
(S.
901).
As
in
the
113th Congress,
U.S.
Senator
Richard
Blumenthal
(D-Conn.),
along
with
U.S.
Representatives
Dan
Benishek,
M.D.
(R-Mich.)
and
Mike
Honda
(D-Calif.),
are
cosponsors
of
this
legislation
and
joined
me
in
taking
this
necessary
step
toward
making
certain
our
military
men
and
women
and
their
descendants
will
be
properly
cared
for
in
the
future.
Many
of
the
symptoms
from
toxic
exposure
are
frequently
misdiagnosed
in
descendants
of
veterans
due
to
a
lack
of
understanding
and
scientific
proof.
However,
veterans
have
observed
increased
levels
of
cancers,
birth
defects
and
other
conditions
in
their
subsequent
generations.
The
evidence
of
these
wounds
of
war
afflicting
the
children
and
grandchildren
of
service
members
exposed
to
toxins
is
growing
and
research
is
warranted
to
collect
data
and
study
this
issue.
The
Toxic
Exposure
Research
Act
of
2015
would
establish
a
national
center
at
a
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
medical
facility
for
research
on
the
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
health
conditions
of
the
descendants
of
individuals
exposed
to
toxic
substances
during
their
time
in
service.
Such
toxic
substances
that
include
Agent
Orange
in
Vietnam,
Gulf
War
neurotoxins,
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
chemical
weapons
and
burn
pits
as
well
as
other
chemicals
and
toxins.
The
goal
of
this
medical
research
is
to
determine
the
conditions
that
result
from
debilitating
toxins
and
hopefully
lead
to
the
appropriate
support
and
benefits
veterans
and
family
members
deserve.
Over
the
past
few
years,
Kansans
have
held
several
town
halls
across
the
state
in
conjunction
with
the
Vietnam
Veterans
of
America
(VVA)
to
address
this
issue
and
raise
awareness.
I'm
proud
that
many
Kansans
recognize
this
important
issue
and
I'm
pleased
this
the
Toxic
Exposure
Research
Act
of
2015
is
overwhelmingly
supported
by
the
VVA
in
addition
to
AMVETS,
the
American
Legion,
Veterans
of
Foreign
Wars
(VFW),
Rolling
Thunder
and
the
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
Veterans
of
America
(IAVA).
The
Toxic
Exposure
Research
Act
is
about
addressing
the
painful,
enduring
wounds
of
war
that
may
impact
a
service
member's
family
long
after
the
military
operation
is
over
&ndash;
wounds
that
may
not
be
evident
until
decades
later
when
passed
on
to
children
and
generations
to
follow. We
must
keep
our
promise
to
our
veterans
and
their
families,
who
have
made
great
sacrifices
for
the
sake
of
our
country's
security
and
our
freedom.

Greeting
the
Kansas
Honor
Flight
at
the
WWII
Memorial
I
was
happy
to
greet
an
Honor
Flight
of
World
War
II
veterans
from
Rooks
County
on
Thursday
at
the
World
War
II
Memorial
in
Washington,
D.C. These
veterans
who
served
our
country
in
World
War
II
represent
the
best
of
American
ideals.
I
am
always
reminded
when
I
visit
the
World
War
II,
Korean
and
Vietnam
Memorials
that
these
men
and
women
answered
the
call
of
duty
in
their
country's
time
of
need
because
they
believed
in
America.
They
served
and
sacrificed
for
the
principles
of
our
Founding
Fathers,
as
well
as
the
liberties
and
freedoms
they
provide.
Our
country
owes
our
veterans
a
great
debt
and
it
was
a
pleasure
to
welcome
these
veterans
as
they
visited
the
World
War
II
Memorial
that
was
built
in
their
honor. I
am
thankful
for
the
service
of
our
veterans
and
I
will
continue
my
work
on
their
behalf,
ensuring
that
they
receive
the
benefits
they
have
earned.
