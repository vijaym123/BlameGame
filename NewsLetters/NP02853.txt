Quick Takes:
Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act: The Senate unanimously passed this bill that will improve mental health care and suicide prevention resources for veterans by increasing access to mental health programs, providing incentives to recruit and retain psychiatrists to treat veterans and enhancing resources for members of the military transitioning to civilian life. If you missed my floor speech during the debate, you can watch it here.
Mondays edition of Roll Call included my opinion piece about the importance of the Clay Hunt SAV Act and what next steps we should take to prevent suicides among veterans.
DHS Funding and the Presidents Executive Overreach: In case you missed it, I spoke with the Washington Examiner about why I think defunding Obamas executive actions on immigration is a must have in any new legislation to fund DHS.
The Presidents Out-of-Touch Budget Proposal: President Obama announced his FY 2016 Budget proposal last week. If implemented, the Presidents proposal would create $2.1 trillion in new taxes, increase spending by 65 percent and add $8.5 trillion to the debt over the next ten years. It would fully fund Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with no restrictions on the Presidents executive order declaring amnesty. Read why this is out-of-touch with the needs and concerns of the American people.
Senate Approves Keystone Pipeline: After more than three weeks of debate and votes on several amendments, the Senate passed, with my support, the Keystone pipeline. I encourage the President to join with Congress to get this project moving, instead of being the one to hold it back.
Lifting Ban on Travel to Cuba: I joined a bipartisan group of colleagues to introduce legislation that would end restrictions on travel to Cuba unfairly imposed on American citizens and legal residents. I believe that the way you change the world is through personal relationships. If we are serious about bringing real change to Cuba, we need to expose the Cuban people to our democratic ideals.
Agriculture Subcommittee Chairman: Im proud to serve as the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Commodities, Markets, Trade and Risk Management for the 114th Congress. This subcommittees work is important to the wellbeing of our agricultural economy and protecting producers.
What I'm Co-Sponsoring: Repealing Obamacare Act, Balanced Budget Amendment & More: I added my support to several bills, including efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, a Constitutional amendment that would require Washington to balance its budget and a bill to hold Iran accountable if the regime refuses to negotiate a deal regarding Tehran's nuclear program by June 30th. Read about these bills and more in this blog post.
Protecting Religious Minorities: I joined my colleagues on a letter urging Secretary of State John Kerry to do more to protect Assyrian Christians and other minorities in the Nineveh Plains in northern Iraq from the attacks of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.
UA Mentoring Program for Veteran and Minority Farmers Receives Federal Funding: I joined with U.S. Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) and U.S. Representative Steve Womack (AR-3) to announce that the University of Arkansas (UA) has been awarded funding to develop an online and in-person training and mentoring program for military veterans and minority farmers.
Skype with Schools:
During National School Choice Week I had the opportunity to skype with students at Haas Hall Academy in Fayetteville and LISA Academy in central Arkansas. Students at these public charter schools said having educational options was important to them because it allows them to be better prepared for their interests beyond high school graduation. Watch the KNWA story about my skype session with Haas Hall students.

Boozman Bulletin: Serving Arkansans
Every day I hear from Arkansans who are having trouble resolving problems with federal agencies. More than 3,000 Arkansans reached out to my office for this reason last year alone. My staff, who is working for you to resolve these problems, has more than 61 combined years of experience
navigating our complex bureaucracy and getting answers for Arkansans.
I&rsquo;m proud of what my staff and I have accomplished to resolve issues involving the federal government on behalf of hardworking Arkansas families, which is why I want to share some of those stories with you.
