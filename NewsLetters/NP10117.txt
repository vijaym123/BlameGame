Statement on the Passage of the Military Construction and Veterans
Affairs Appropriations Act
4/30/14
Today,
Congressman Doug Lamborn joined a bipartisan majority in supporting H.R.
4486,
the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related
Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015.
"I am particularly pleased to support this bill because it
includes tens of millions of dollars for new facilities and
construction on Ft. Carson and Peterson AFB. After many months of personally
advocating for the 5th CD with members of the Appropriations Committee,
it is satisfying to see these projects move closer to reality. These
dollars will fund much needed projects and will be an infusion to the
local economy and job market. It's important to recognize that this
money also shows a commitment by the Congress and the DOD to a continuous
and robust military presence in the 5th
CD."
"Additionally, I discussed the importance of
the Southern Colorado National VA Cemetery with Chairman Culberson on
the floor during debate on the bill and he publicly agreed to support
the project when funding is needed next year. This is a project I have
been working on since my very first day in Congress. Seeing the
progress being made brings a great deal of assurance to the veterans of
Southern Colorado. Having a dignified final resting place closer to home
has been an issue of major concern to our local veterans community and
I am very pleased that I have been able to lead the charge and make
this hallowed location a reality."
