No to Another President Bush:
Signature Pending &gt;&gt;
Here&rsquo;s what the
Washington Post
had to say about him: &quot;Bush&#39;s back-to-back terms [as governor of Florida] were marred by frequent ethics scandals, official bungling and the inability of the government he downsized to meet growing demands for state services, including education and aid for the infirm and the elderly.&rdquo;
A Jeb Bush presidency would bring more tax breaks for billionaires and more harm to the middle class. You NEED to stand strong against him.
ADD YOUR NAME: Say NO to another President Bush!!
Thanks,

P.S. It&rsquo;s bad enough that Jeb Bush used his power as Florida governor to help put his brother in the White House. Now, he wants to be President too?
