Capitol Update
Congressman Paul Cook Cosponsors Bill to Safeguard Americans' Internet
Privacy
Congressman Paul Cook has signed on as a cosponsor to the "Safe and
Secure Federal Websites Act" introduced by Rep. Kerry Bentivolio
(R-Michigan).
This bill ensures Healthcare.gov and other federal websites that
collect personally identifiable information be reviewed by the
Government Accountability Office (GAO). The agency's Chief Information
Officer must certify any website as secure before the public can enter
personal information. Additionally, it requires any federal website
published after July 1, 2013 that has not been certified as secure must
be taken down until proven to be safe.
Said Cook, "I'm dedicated to protecting Americans' privacy and
information security. This bill will put in place safeguards to ensure
that our most sensitive information is kept out of the hands of hackers
and identity thieves."
A recent hearing by the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology
revealed that Healthcare.gov has no safeguards to determine when it is
under attack by hackers. Additionally, normal security industry
practices were not employed by the designers in securing the website.
Congressman Cook takes to Twitter for Town Hall with #AskCook
Congressman Cook held his first Twitter town hall last week. During the
town hall, Congressman Cook answered questions directly from
constituents on his Twitter page, @RepPaulCook.

opportunity to communicate directly with constituents. With such a
large and unique district, I've got to be creative to find ways to keep
in touch with them. Outlets such as Twitter provide me the opportunity
to connect even when I'm in Washington. I look forward to holding
another Twitter town hall in February."

Economic Injury Disaster Loans Available to California Small Businesses
Small nonfarm businesses, agricultural cooperatives, businesses engaged
in aquaculture, and most private, nonprofit organizations of any size
may qualify for Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs) of up to $2
million to help meet financial obligations and operating expenses which
could have been met had the disaster not occurred. These loans offset
economic losses because of reduced revenues caused by the drought that
began on January 1, 2014.
Businesses in 35 California counties are now eligible to apply for
low-interest federal disaster loans from the U. S. Small Business
Administration (SBA). Some California counties include Inyo, Mono, and
San Bernardino.
By law, SBA makes EIDLs available when the U. S. Secretary of
Agriculture designates an agricultural disaster. Secretary Tom Vilsack
declared this disaster on January 15, 2014.
Businesses primarily engaged in farming or ranching are not eligible
for SBA disaster assistance. Agricultural enterprises should contact
the Farm Services Agency (FSA) about the U. S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) assistance made available by the Secretary's
declaration. However, in drought disasters nurseries are eligible for
SBA disaster assistance.
For more information, please visit https://disasterloan.sba.gov/ela.
The deadline to apply for these loans is September 15, 2014.
Veterans' Corner
Veterans diagnosed with service-connected Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
who suffer from Parkinson's disease, certain types of dementia,
depression, unprovoked seizures, or some diseases of the hypothalamus
and pituitary glands will soon be able to apply for expanded disability
compensation benefits.
Beginning January 15, 2014, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
(USDVA) will presume those illnesses are service connected when
diagnosed as a secondary condition to TBI. The new regulation stems
from a report of the National Academy of Sciences, Institute of
Medicine regarding the association between TBI and their diagnosable
illnesses.
According to the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center, 287,861
service members and veterans have been diagnosed with TBI since 2000.
The numbers represent medical diagnoses of TBI that occurred anywhere
U.S. forces are located, including the continental U.S.
Veterans file a claim to establish direct service-connection for these
ailments even if they do not meet the time and severity standards in
the new regulation. Service members who are within 180 days of
discharge may also file a pre-discharge claim for TBI. If you are a
veteran who has been diagnosed with service-connected TBI or any of the
five presumptive diseases and disorders related to TBI, contact your
County Veterans Service Office to file a claim for disability benefits.
For more information, please visit the CVSO office nearest you. To find
your local CVSO office, go to www.cacvso.org, click on "Contact Us,"
and then click on your county of residence.
