Congressman Andrews Announces the Opening of New Senior Housing in
Lawnside
HADDON HEIGHTS, N.J. - Tuesday, Congressman Andrews announced that the
Lawnside Senior Meadows senior citizen housing complex, a project that
created over 200 construction jobs, is now open and accepting tenants.
With the assistance and support of Congressman Andrews, the Lawnside
Senior Meadows project was able to secure over $9 million in federal
affordable housing tax credits that were critically needed to help
finance the development.
Lawnside Senior Meadows consists of 40 one-bedroom apartments for
senior citizens, outfitted with energy-efficient appliances, in both a
new building and in the former historic Lawnside Elementary School
which was newly renovated in order to allow for senior housing. Eight
of the residences are designated for disabled senior citizens and five
are reserved for homeless seniors with special needs. In addition,
residents have an onsite exercise room and laundry room to share, as
well as rooms dedicated for crafts and a computer lab. The Center for
Family Services will provide support for different social services
ranging from promoting general health to assisting seniors with special
needs. Lawnside Senior Meadows is easily accessible by public
transportation, making the property convenient for senior citizens who
can no longer drive.
"This project created over 200 jobs building something that will make a
huge difference in the lives of so many seniors and their families,"
said Congressman Andrews.
"I'm glad we were able to play a small part
in making this beautiful place a reality so that our local senior
citizens have access to quality housing that is not only affordable,
but built to provide the amenities and services that these new
residents require."
Congressman Andrews has been a strong supporter of construction
projects, like Lawnside Senior Meadows, that create quality jobs and
provide affordable housing for South Jersey's senior citizens.
As the
senior population in South Jersey grows, Congressman Andrews will
continue the fight in Washington to make sure there is adequate funding
for projects like Lawnside Senior Meadows to keep our seniors healthy,
happy and safe.
