Friends,
Happy Halloween!
I enjoyed meeting people out at Trinity Baptist Church's Fall Festival
and Trunk or Treat in Oconee County-the kids had some great costumes!
I hope that you have the opportunity to spend the holiday with family
and friends and that it is safe and fun.
Protecting Air Facility Charleston
I am very happy to report
that the closure of the Air Facility Charleston has
been delayed at least until December 15, and I am hopeful that we can
find a longer-term solution for the lifesaving facility.
Losing the Air Facility Charleston and its search-and-rescue helicopter
would have serious implications on one of our nation's critical port
cities and adversely impact the safety of mariners, residents and
tourists in the region. Admiral Zukunft's commitment to delay closure
of this important facility until at least December 15th is positive
news for the Lowcountry.
With this extra time, it's my hope that the Coast Guard will look
closely at the safety and economic benefits of the facility to South
Carolinians and those in the region. I will continue to work closely
with our Congressional delegation and the Coast Guard to explore
options that will keep the Air Facility Charleston operational.
Help with Federal Agencies
If you can't get an answer from a federal agency in a timely fashion,
or if you feel you have been treated unfairly, I want to help! My
office can often help resolve a problem or get you the information you
need. Unfortunately, we can't always guarantee you a favorable outcome,
but we can guarantee that we will do everything we can to help you.
You can call my Upstate (864-233-5366), Midlands (803-771-6112), or
Lowcountry (843-727-4525) offices or visit my website
to learn more!
It is an honor to serve as your voice in the United States Senate.
