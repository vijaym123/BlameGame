Dear Neighbor,
I spoke with a number of constituents this week about how their family&rsquo;s healthcare will change under Obamacare. One constituent, a small business owner in Ithaca, believed the President when he said anyone who liked their health care plan could keep them. Unfortunately, he and his wife will not be able to keep the current plan they are happy with. Another constituent from Bath recently saw their hours at an auto parts store cut from 35 to 25 hours per week because of Obamacare. Please continue to
share
your stories with us as we work toward solutions.
We&rsquo;re voting in the House today on the
Keep Your Health Plan Act
to allow health plans currently available on the individual market to continue next year &ndash; giving Americans the opportunity to continue to enroll in those plans without penalty under Obamacare.
A few items I wanted to highlight from the week so far:
At our
joint
Manufacturing
and Natural Gas Caucus meeting
we heard testimony from panelists about
the growth expected and already occurring in both fields. One panelists
testified that energy-related jobs &ldquo;could raise to 3.3 million by 2020&rdquo;
with specific growth noted in New York State. Read more on the joint
meeting
here .
Please visit
our new
website
for the House Manufacturing Caucus &ndash; from recaps to meeting announcements
to photos from our manufacturers, it&rsquo;s a great resource to keep up-to-date
on what&rsquo;s going on with the caucus.
I was
honored to receive the 2012 Congressional Leadership Award from the
American Diabetes Association. From my family ties to diabetes and
participating in the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation annual walks to
my vice chair role on the
Congressional
Diabetes Caucus
&ndash; diabetes research is something I will continue to
partner with the ADA to support and encourage.
We
announced this week more than $3 million in FEMA funds to
update
flood warning systems and prepare for flooding
in communities in the
Southern Tier and Finger Lakes region. This is welcome news for areas hit
hard by storms Sandy and Irene.
We toured
the site of the new water tank in Corning (pictured below) &ndash; pleased our
office was able to help expedite FAA approval so that the new Corning
Hospital construction remains on schedule. So many of us depend on these
rural hospitals for care for our families and I am glad to see the project
moving forward.
Looking ahead to the next few days:
TOWN
HALLS : Tomorrow (Saturday, November 16 th ) we will be in
Seneca and Steuben counties for town halls. I&rsquo;m looking forward to all
input from the district &ndash; the more people from all sides who are involved
in this conversation, the better.
Looking
forward to the
Courage
Bowl
this weekend with friends from
Camp Good Days and Special Times .
We&rsquo;ll be
honoring more veterans in the district at the Corning VFW 75th Anniversary
Celebration this weekend.
I hope everyone was able to spend some time last weekend and Monday &ndash; Veterans Day &ndash; honoring veterans. I was fortunate to spend Veterans Day with local veterans in Corning. To the millions of veterans and their families all around the world, thank you. We are forever grateful.
Best,
Tom
