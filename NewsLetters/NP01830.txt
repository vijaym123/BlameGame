Dear Friends,
I recently attended the Red Cross Real Heroes program in Fresno, where exceptional individuals are recognized
for acts of courage, heroism, and service. An amazing group of people was recognized &#8211; soldiers, law enforcement officers, and numerous everyday people who performed extraordinary acts in their communities.
Along with U.S. Marshal Albert Najera, I had the honor of presenting the Congressional Badge of Bravery to Deputy
U.S. Marshal Stephen Mroczka, who was shot twice while apprehending a dangerous fugitive in Fresno. The suspect, who was wanted in connection with a violent sexual assault, opened fire on U.S. Marshals who came to capture him at a house where he was staying.
Despite being shot in the chest and abdomen, Deputy Mroczka fired back and immobilized the fugitive. It was one of many astounding stories we heard about a truly extraordinary group of Americans. My thanks to the Red Cross for hosting this outstanding event.
Sincerely ,
Devin Nunes
MEMBER OF CONGRESS
