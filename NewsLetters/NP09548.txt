Dear Friends,
I wanted to share with you an update on some recent activities in the
Third District and some things going on now in Washington, DC.
Rest in Peace, Butler Derrick
First, I hope you will join me in remembering former Third District
Congressman Butler Derrick. Congressman Derrick passed on May 5th at
his home in Easley after battling a fight with cancer. A few years ago,
Congressman Derrick was gracious enough to visit with me and share some
of the insight he gained from his many years of public service. To this
day, I still hear stories throughout the Third District about how
Butler impacted someone's life in a positive way. My thoughts and
prayers are with his family during this difficult time.
District Tour
A few weeks ago I wrapped up a tour of the district, where I had the
opportunity to visit small businesses and community organizations to
learn about their priorities and talk about economic opportunity and
job creation. I also attended grand openings at the Piedmont Tech
Abbeville Campus and Laurens County Community Care Center, talked with
students at AR Lewis Elementary about the American Dream, and addressed
the Anderson Pregnancy Care Center at their annual banquet. I greatly
enjoyed this time in the district
and am already looking forward to my next district
week.
Problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs
As many of you are aware, the Department of Veterans Affairs is
currently experiencing massive problems - problems with disbursing
veterans benefits, mismanagement of medical records, months-long
doctors visit wait times, and hundreds of thousands backlogged VA
cases. Some of you may have experience these problems personally.
Others of you may have loved ones or friends who have been affected by
this. These heroes deserve better and were promised better when they
signed up to honorably serve this nation.
The House of Representatives recently voted to address these problems
in the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act.
This bill provides the Military and Department of Veterans Affairs with
funding for regular operations and prioritizes fixing these problems by
concentrating efforts to end the current backlog, holding VA offices
accountable through office performance measurements, and increasing
medical services for veterans. The Military Construction and Veterans
Affairs Appropriations Act also prioritizes the timely and accurate
exchange of medical data, updating of the VA health record system, and
ensuring the system is operable with the Department of Defense. I had
an opportunity to speak in support of this legislation on the House
Floor, which you can watch here
.
Furthermore, if you or a loved one requires assistance with any
veterans issues I am here to help. Please don't hesitate to contact my
Laurens office at 864-681-1028.
Benghazi Select Committee
Speaker John Boehner recently announced that the House of
Representatives will create a select committee to investigate the 2012
terrorist attack in Benghazi that left four Americans dead, including
U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, after years of the Administration
withholding information from Members of Congress and the public. Even
more, Speaker Boehner said he would be appointing South Carolina 4th
District Congressman, and my good friend, Trey Gowdy to lead the select
committee. I congratulate Congressman Gowdy, and wish him much success
in creating accountability and forcing transparency upon the
Administration. His bulldog-like tenacity and prosecutorial skill is
exactly what is needed to get to the bottom of what happened before,
during, and after the attacks in Benghazi.
Town of Greece v. Galloway
On May 5th the Supreme Court made a ruling on the case Town of Greece
v. Galloway, a case questioning the Constitutionality of opening
government meetings with prayer. The Supreme Court found that this
practice does not violate the First Amendment, giving local governments
around the nation freedom and peace of mind to begin public meetings in
prayer. To put it simply, I was very pleased with the Court's decision
and had previously signed onto an Amici Curiae in support of the town's
right to pray.
While the ruling will not stop some from pushing 'Freedom from Religion'
instead of 'Freedom of Religion,' I hope it will some bring some
resolve to local communities that want to begin their public meetings
in prayer.
Thank You
Lastly, I would like to wrap up by saying thank you. Thanks for staying
in contact with me and for your participation and activities on social
media. Through this we have grown our Facebook participation rate to
over 20,000 'Likes,' Twitter to 18,000 'Follows,' and Instagram to
almost 300 'Follows.' These online tools are a great way to keep in
constant communication, provide an opportunity for constituents to see
what is going on in Congress on a daily basis, and give me a way to
keep a constant eye on what is going on in South Carolina at no cost to
the taxpayer. If you haven't yet, I would encourage you to connect with
me on Facebook
, Twitter
, Instagram
and Youtube
.
Thank you, and I hope to see you soon around the District.
Blessing and Liberty,

Dear
Friends,
I
wanted
to
share
with
you
an
update
on
some
recent
activities
in
the
Third
District
and
some
things
going
on
now
in
Washington,
DC.
Rest
in
Peace,
Butler
Derrick First,
I
hope
you
will
join
me
in
remembering
former
Third
District
Congressman
Butler
Derrick.
Congressman
Derrick
passed
on
May
5th
at
his
home
in
Easley
after
battling
a
fight
with
cancer. A
few
years

Derrick
was
gracious
enough
to
visit
with
me
and
share
some
of
the
insight
he
gained
from
his
many
years
of
public
service.
To
this
day,
I
still
hear
stories
throughout
the
Third
District
about
how
Butler
impacted
someone&#8217;s
life
in
a
positive
way.
My
thoughts
and
prayers
are
with
his
family
during
this
difficult
time.
District
Tour A
few
weeks
ago
I
wrapped
up
a
tour
of
the
district,
where
I
had
the

to
visit
small

and
community
organizations
to

and

and
addressed
the
Anderson
Pregnancy

at

I
greatly
enjoyed
this
time
in
the
district
and
am
already
looking
forward
to
my
next
district
week.
Problems
at
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs As
many
of

the
Department

massive
problems
&#8211;
problems
with
disbursing

benefits,
mismanagement
of
medical
records,
months-long

and
hundreds
of
thousands
backlogged
VA
cases.
Some
of
you
may
have
experience

problems
personally.
Others
of
you
may

or
friends
who
have

affected
by
this.
These
heroes
deserve

and
were
promised

to
honorably

The
House
of

recently
voted
to
address
these
problems
in
the
Military
Construction

Veterans
Affairs
Appropriations
Act.
This

of
this
legislation
on
the
House
Floor,
which
you
can
watch
here .
Furthermore,
if

Benghazi
Select
Committee
Speaker
John
Boehner
recently
announced
that
the
House
of
Representatives
will
create
a
select
committee
to
investigate
the
2012
terrorist
attack
in
Benghazi
that
left
four
Americans
dead,
including
U.S.
Ambassador
Christopher
Stevens,
after
years
of
the
Administration
withholding
information
from
Members
of
Congress
and
the
public.
Even
more,
Speaker
Boehner
said
he
would
be
appointing
South
Carolina
4th
District
Congressman,
and
my
good
friend,
Trey
Gowdy
to
lead
the
select
committee.
I
congratulate
Congressman
Gowdy,
and
wish
him
much
success
in
creating
accountability
and
forcing
transparency
upon
the
Administration.
His
bulldog-like
tenacity
and
prosecutorial
skill
is
exactly
what
is
needed
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
what
happened
before,
during,
and
after
the
attacks
in
Benghazi.
Town
of
Greece
v.
Galloway On
May
5th
the
Supreme
Court
made
a
ruling
on
the
case
Town
of
Greece
v.
Galloway,
a
case
questioning
the
Constitutionality
of
opening
government
meetings
with
prayer.
The
Supreme
Court
found
that
this
practice
does
not
violate
the
First
Amendment,
giving
local
governments
around
the
nation
freedom
and
peace
of
mind
to
begin
public
meetings
in
prayer.
To
put
it
simply,
I
was
very
pleased
with
the
Court&#8217;s
decision
and
had
previously
signed
onto
an
Amici
Curiae
in
support
of
the
town&#8217;s
right
to
pray.
While
the
ruling
will
not
stop
some
from
pushing
&#8216;Freedom
from
Religion&#8217;
instead
of
&#8216;Freedom
of
Religion,&#8217;
I
hope
it
will
some
bring
some
resolve
to
local
communities
that
want
to
begin
their
public
meetings
in
prayer.
Thank
You
Lastly,
I
would
like
to
wrap
up
by
saying
thank
you.
Thanks

staying
in
contact
with
me
and

your

and

a

an

for

what
