Congressional Report -- Week of March 24-28: Taking Care of Big
Bend National Park
Hello Friend,
I spent the week in our nation's capital working on legislation and
attending hearings and meetings. I'm always looking out for the best
interests of 23rd District of Texas and fellow Texans. It was a busy
week across the district as well. Field Representatives visited with
constituents in Kermit, Monahans, Ft. Stockton, Pecos, Grandfalls, Del
Rio, Crystal City, Sanderson, Carrizo Springs, Castroville, Pearsall
and Cotulla. Our office is getting ready for the 2014 Congressional Art
Competition, and I'm looking forward to viewing many pieces of art from
across 23rd District of Texas.
Here's a wrap up of the week.

House Armed Services Committee Hearing
A few days ago, I participated in a House Armed Services Committee
hearing with the Secretary of the Army, John McHugh, and the Chief of
Staff of the Army, General Ray Odierno. I continue to fight against
sequestration and the damage it is doing to our Army and national
security in the long-term. As the Army draws down following Iraq and
Afghanistan, I also addressed the need for continued investment to
support our Soldiers at Fort Bliss and Joint Base San Antonio. El Paso
and San Antonio are great communities for the military, and I will
continue to fight for our hometown heroes.
Taking Care of Big Bend National Park
Recently, there was a stir about drilling for oil and gas in national
parks. Big Bend National Park was my childhood playground - having
grown up in Alpine. I support safely drilling for oil, gas and other
natural resources where it makes sense. However, I definitely do not
support drilling in Big Bend National Park. To read my full statement
on this, click here
.
Attended the Abrazo Ceremony in Eagle Pass and Piedras Negras.
March is Music in Our Schools Month
Music is important to our lives. It keeps us on our feet, makes us
happy, brings back memories and teaches us how to keep a beat. I think
it's just as important to learn music, arts and humanities as it is to
learn science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). I
recorded this short video honoring Music in Our Schools and thanking
our many choir teachers, band directors and mariachi directors across
23rd District of Texas. To watch the video, click here
.
Happy Birthday American G.I. Forum
Earlier this week, the American G.I. Forum celebrated its 66th
anniversary. On March 26, 1948, the Forum was started in Corpus
Christi, Texas, by Dr. Hector P. Garcia, a Mexican-American physician,
surgeon and World War II veteran. Today, the Forum has chapters
throughout the country and focuses on veteran's issues, education and
civil rights. Thanks to Dr. Garcia for his vision and commitment to
Latinos. As a young state legislator, I was privileged to meet Dr.
Garcia and I shall not forget him. To learn more about the Forum, visit
www.agifusa.org
.
New Push for Discharge Petition on Bipartisan Comprehensive Immigration
Reform
The votes are there to pass comprehensive immigration reform, but
members have not been allowed to vote on this issue by the leadership.
On Wednesday, I was one of the first members of Congress to sign a
discharge petition to bring H.R. 15, the bipartisan comprehensive
immigration reform bill, to the floor of the U.S. House of
Representatives and allow a vote. Our district has more border with
Mexico than any other in the country - over 800 miles of U.S.-Mexico
border from El Paso to below Eagle Pass. I support a bill that brings
security and economic prosperity to our country and reduces the deficit
by close to $1 trillion in the next two decades. For more on this,
click here
.
Presidio County Healthiest in Texas
Presidio County was named the healthiest county in Texas on Wednesday.
While in the Legislature, I worked to make dramatic changes in
Presidio, the county's largest city, including sidewalks and paving.
Over the years, I've noticed more people, families and children using
the sidewalks to be active. Glad to know Presidio County folks are
doing so well. To learn more about these rankings, or find your county,

Deadline Nearing for Smithsonian's Young Ambassadors Program
The Smithsonian Latino Center continues to accept applications for the
2014 Young Ambassadors Program. The deadline to apply is before 5 p.m.
ET on April 7. The Young Ambassadors Program is a national program for
graduating high school seniors aimed at fostering the next generation
of Latino leaders in the arts, sciences and humanities via the
Smithsonian and its resources. For more information on the program and
application, click here

Lastly, thanks again for letting me be your congressman. If I can help
you with a federal agency or issue, please call on any of our offices.
The phone numbers and addresses are listed below. I've never been a big
fan of politics - helping people is my favorite part of the job. Please
put us to work for you.
Sincerely,
Pete P. Gallego
