Friend,
Congress took a step in the right direction last month with the passage of a long overdue budget deal.
But it&rsquo;s not enough.
Because Speaker Boehner did not allow us to take action at the end of December, over 1 million Americans lost their emergency unemployment benefits.
That&rsquo;s over 1 million workers who are struggling to find jobs and are now facing an even greater challenge to put food on the table and keep their houses warm this winter.
We need to take action.
Please add your name to demand that Speaker Boehner address an extension of emergency unemployment
benefits as soon as possible.
This is a question of our values.
Jobless benefits are a safeguard for families who are facing hardships in this economy, and we cannot turn our backs on them as they continue to seek employment.
Americans shouldn&rsquo;t have to choose between feeding their families and paying their rent.
But that&rsquo;s the situation many face when their jobless benefits expire.
We need to address this issue now.
Please join me in urging Speaker Boehner to extend emergency unemployment
benefits today.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
