Dear
Friend,
Last night, I voted for an amendment to the Defense
appropriations bill to prevent more American troops in Iraq. I was one of only
23 Republicans to do so.
I strongly oppose sending more
American troops to Iraq and believe only Iraqis can secure their
future.
Iraqi leadership must address the concerns of their
citizens from all sects and ethnicities, and Iraqi Security Forces must
fight against al Qaeda-linked forces with urgency and
resolve.
The President must also closely consult with Congress and seek
necessary authorization as decisions regarding the United States' role
in Iraq are made.
As always,
please don't hesitate to
contact my office
if you
have concerns, questions, or ideas to share with me about the
situation in Iraq or any other issue that is important to
you.
Sincerely,
Steve
