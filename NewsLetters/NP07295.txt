Securing our
Borders
Last month I asked what you
think should be done to handle the border crisis.
Overwhelmingly , you said that the border needs to be secured, immigration
laws enforced and the children returned to their home.
I
agree ! The most humane thing we can do for the thousands of
unaccompanied children who have streamed across our border is to
detain them, process their case as quickly as possible and then return
them to their parents, who have made it clear that
they want
their children back.
Last month, I requested to visit the Conroe
facility which houses some of the unaccompanied minors and organized it so
that several other Montgomery County elected officials could join me.
We all had questions that needed answers.
We learned
that it appears these children are being coached to take advantage of a
2008 anti-trafficking law, as most come to the border with the name
and contact information for U.S. officials, as well as their birth
certificate, claiming there is violence back home. Thankfully, only a small
percentage of these children are being released into the area, but
the truth is,
they need to go back home to their
families.
Last
week the House passed legislation that
secures the border, deters
future dangerous journeys for children from Central America and
reunites children with their families back home.
We not only changed
the 2008 law that is being misused to slow walk these cases, we now
require these cases to be filed within
14 days
and have
provided funds to hire enough temporary judges to decide these cases
within
three days.
Our bill ends
house and
release
and funds transportation back to their home countries
redirecting $40 million in previous foreign aid to Central American
countries to be used to take these children home to their families. And
it funds the National Guard to help the border patrol
secure
the U.S. border
and give border officials full access to
federal lands along the border.
These are
common sense
solutions to address this
unprecedented crisis. But in order to keep this from happening again, the
current administration must publicly commit to
securing our
border
and enforcing our immigration laws.
Defending our
Constitution
Last month, the House
voted on a resolution to bring suit against the President because of his
circumvention of Congress,
which according to the
Constitution,
has the sole authority to pass laws. While I believe there
are several instances of the President over-stepping his authority, we
intend to specifically
hold him accountable
for
making changes to the Affordable Care Act without going through Congress.
Understand that this isn't about partisanship --
it's about defending the Constitution and protecting this
Republic
that Benjamin Franklin once challenged an enquiring mind
to keep. No President has the right to make his own laws and every
member of Congress
(who all swore an oath to uphold and defend the
Constitution)
should be concerned when a President exceeds his
authority. All Presidents have used Executive Orders at times. We just
believe it should always be done
within the bounds of the
law.
Protecting our Veterans
Making sure that our Veterans have the care they have
earned and need
is a priority for the House. In
conjunction with the Senate, last month we passed the
Veterans Access,
Choice &amp; Accountability Act.
This bill, which will improve access
to and quality care for our veterans, allows or
requires:
The VA to authorize
non-VA care to veterans who are unable to get an appointment
within
30 days
The VA to authorize non-VA care to veterans who live
more than
40 miles
from a VA facility
An independent assessment of VA medical
care
The VA to
fire
or demote
employees who perform poorly or are guilty of
misconduct
Our Veterans
sacrificed
a
great deal in order to protect us and our country. We are a grateful
nation and we will deliver on the promises made to these
courageous Americans.
Stopping the IRS
While the IRS tries to convince the American
people that important emails have been
conveniently lost
and hard drives scratched, the Ways &amp; Means Committee I sit on
relentlessly investigates and has called for a
forensic expert
to
look at the evidence. And while a thorough discovery process
continues, the House is also moving to
rein in the IRS
through
legislation. A bill the House passed last week cut funding for the
agency back to a
12 year low
and prohibits it from
targeting any taxpayers
because of their ideological beliefs. It
also stops the IRS from using funds to enforce the Affordable Care Act's
mandate that
requires workers to buy government approved health
care or pay a tax.
As long as IRS officials
continue to stonewall
the congressional investigation
into illegal actions surrounding the targeting of conservative
organizations, they can expect to see their budget cut even further. I for
one am not going to vote to increase funding to an agency that uses its
power to
bully and intimidate honest Americans . This
legislation will keep them focused on providing the respectful customer service
that taxpayers deserve and stop them from using resources to create
ridiculous training videos, putting on multi-million dollar
conferences, or going after Americans for speaking out against the current White
House administration.
Federal agencies should serve the
taxpayers who pay for their funding, not target
them.
Providing
Solutions
Many folks believe
that the
American Dream
is no longer in reach. As
Americans struggle to find a good-paying job and make ends meet, they worry
about their children's future and for the
first time in our
history , they don't believe their children will be better off
than they are. They head to the grocery store or gas station, knowing
that they're going to
pay more and get less . I
honestly believe that our wasteful, bloated federal budget, high taxes and
never-ending red tape are the culprits behind this national
malaise.
The
good news is that those things can be fixed. Americans want
efficient, effective government
that works for them, not against
them.
House Republicans have solutions , and
plenty of them. Our bills will
unshackle job creators ,
make sure you keep more of your paycheck, help
hard-working
Americans develop the skills they need and give you back some of the freedom
you lost to make your own choices regarding your health
care.
Unfortunately, dozens of
these bills are bogged down in a
'do nothing'
Senate where
partisanship holds sway. But the House will continue to put on the
pressure, putting forth solutions that are
sensible
and hold
the government
accountable
to
you.

What do you think? What do you think should be
done with the unattended children who are crossing the border
illegally? Border
security needs to be increased so that this can't happen
again. The President needs to make
it clear that there are no free passes for these
children. They should be allowed to
remain in the United States if they have family here. They should be declared
refugees and allowed to remain in the United States. Current immigration laws need to be
strictly enforced. Congress needs to reform immigration law to address issues like this
more effectively. Other/Not sure *By answering this survey, you are subscribing to
