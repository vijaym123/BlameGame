Dear Friends,
This October is National Cyber Security Awareness Month.
This month underscores the responsibility that all Americans have to
educate and protect themselves regarding responsible cyber practices
online. In a world where we spend so much time plugged in and logged
on, it's important that we stop and think before connecting to the
Internet.
The Department of Homeland Security has some tips for keeping yourself,
your assets and your personal information safe online:
*	Set strong passwords and don't share them with anyone;
*	Keep your operating system, browser, and other critical
software optimized by installing updates;
*	Maintain an open dialogue with your family, friends, and
community about Internet safety;
*	Limit the amount of personal information you post online and
use privacy settings to avoid sharing information widely;
*	Be cautious about what you receive or read online-if it sounds
too good to be true, it probably is.
That being said, we have a shared responsibility when it comes to cyber
security. As chairman on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental
Affairs Committee, I've been working hard with my colleagues to pass
bipartisan legislation that would improve our government's cyber
capabilities.
Nearly every day, we hear about criminals and nation states launching
cyber attacks that could undermine our national security and cause
wide-scale economic damage. These cyber criminals are probing our
government agencies, universities, and critical infrastructure - and
they are looking for weak spots in our defenses.
Congress has an important role in making sure that the federal
government and its partners have the tools and resources to counter
these 21st century threats with a 21st century response. It is my hope
that we can come together as a nation - government and industry,
Democrat and Republican - and work together to tackle the growing cyber
security threats we face.
