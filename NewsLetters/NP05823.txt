Congressman Lamborn Attends the First Annual Southern Colorado Manufacturing
Expo
9/30/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn attended
the opening day of the inaugural Southern Colorado Manufacturing Expo.
Presented by Ent Business Banking in association with Colorado
Business Bank, Action Machines, Century Link Business, and Mazak, the expo
is a showcase designed to bring the local manufacturing community
together to demonstrate the products and goods manufactured throughout the
region
from aerospace, to electronics, to food and beverage, to
lifestyle, to bioscience, and to industrial and consumer
items.
"It was wonderful to meet with the
owners and employees of over six dozens manufacturing businesses here
in Southern Colorado and the Pikes Peak region. This new expo will be a
fantastic way to highlight our robust local manufacturing sector.
From 3-D printing to large scale machining, and everything in between,
our community is home to almost every kind of manufacturing imaginable.
I will continue to work hard in Congress to support business friendly
policies designed to make things easier for American
manufacturing."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
