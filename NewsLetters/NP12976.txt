News from Representative John Delaney
January 20, 2014
Dear Friend,
I write to you today to commemorate the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr. Fifty years ago, Dr. King challenged us to live up to our
nation's founding values of democracy, equality and opportunity. Today,
January 20, we celebrate Martin Luther King Day to remember Dr. King's
vision and to remind ourselves of the commitment we have to securing
these values for all Americans.
During his struggle to advance civil rights and combat racial
inequality, Dr. King faced a political establishment resistant to
change and a nation divided by hatred and distrust. By working to build
compassion between neighbors, communities and a country, Dr. King was
able to inspire a nation of people to come together in order to pursue
a dream that our founding fathers had set out to realize.
This year, I will be commemorating Martin Luther King Day by joining
Montgomery County's Community Engagement Cluster (CEC) for a day of
service. The CEC is responsible for strengthening Montgomery County's
commitment to civic engagement and community service by engaging
residents, organizations, businesses, and other interest groups in our
communities.
In his words and actions, Dr. King stressed that his struggle to secure
voting rights, economic opportunity, and housing fairness only provided
a foundation for our continued work. "1963 is not an end," King stated
in his famous speech at the March on Washington, "but only a beginning."
Today we still have work to do to achieve fairness, justice and
opportunity for all Americans. As we begin 2014, I promise to do my
part, both in our community and in Congress.
Sincerely,
John

Dear

I
write
to
you
today
to

the
legacy
of
Dr.
Martin

Fifty
years

Dr.

challenged
us
to
live

Today,

King&#8217;s
vision
and
to
remind
ourselves
of
the
commitment
we
have
to

Dr.
