"Wherever we can, we
follow the law."
Though it sounds
unbelievable , when I asked IRS Commissioner John Koskinen at a
recent Ways &amp; Means Health Subcommittee hearing I was chairing if he
intended to follow the law regarding the recouping of incorrectly paid
ObamaCare subsidies, his response to me was,
"Wherever we
can, we follow the law."
And then he grinned.
If you'd
like to see it for yourself, just click on the
video
below and watch.
I thought I was at a point
where the disdainful actions of the IRS would cease to amaze me, but even
I was
speechless
at this frank admission. But it's
just another example of this corrupt and unlawful IRS and why it's
vital for Congressional committees to continue investigating until we get
the
full truth
so that we can ensure that
no American
is ever again targeted by their government
for their political beliefs.
Defeating
America's Enemies
We've all been
horrified at the monstrous actions by the terrorist organization, the
Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant or ISIL. It's clear that ISIL is the
best equipped and financed terrorist threat America has faced,
and left unchecked is a grave threat to our security .
Experts agree that air strikes alone are not enough to defeat these enemies;
capable armed forces on the ground are necessary and America is doing
our part by training and equipping the Free Syrian Army, who is
already on the ground fighting our common enemies.
I'm not
convinced yet that this is going to be enough to defeat ISIL,
but
it's a needed first step.
The responsibility is now President
Obama's to build a coalition with our allies to eliminate this terror
threat. And that includes
strengthening our own
border
again the thousands of fighters who hold Western passports and
can easily travel to Europe and the United States.
Unleashing American
Innovation
Even during a weak economic recovery such as this, America's
local businesses want to
innovate and grow . But we
know that a
bloated federal government and unfair tax code
is
holding back job creation and stifling American research. In fact, when it
comes to research &amp; development, we're losing ground to nations
such as China.
Last
week, the House voted to
get Washington out of the
way . We passed a Jobs Bill package that focused on securing America's
competitiveness in a global economy. My bill to
simplify and
make permanent
the U.S. R&amp;D tax credit was part of this
package. This will offer strong incentives that will attract new R&amp;D
spending, and the jobs that go along with it.
Local businesses
in my district say Washington throws up too many roadblocks to
growth. This jobs package
removes those roadblocks and unleashes
American entrepreneurs
to do what they do best.
Six Years is Too
Long
It's been
six years
since the Keystone XL Pipeline
project was submitted for approval, but the President continues to
drag his feet, preferring to please his political buddies than help
America's middle-class find good paying jobs. President Obama has also
claimed that he wants
energy independence , but his
administration is rolling out the
redtape
at unprecedented levels,
drowning the energy industry.
That's why the House also passed an Energy Bills
package last week that will ensure the reliable production and
transportation of domestic energy. It also includes approval for the construction
of the Keystone XL Pipeline's northern route by
removing the
need for a Presidential permit.
The package also speeds up
the permitting process for natural gas pipelines, increases offshore and
onshore production of oil and
reins in the EPA's
flood of redtape.
Families continue to struggle in this
historically weak economic recovery to find good jobs and pay the bills.
Unleashing America's domestic energy production will go a long way to
help workers find
good jobs , plus put us on the path
to energy independence.
