Dear David,
This Veterans Day, I'm honoring our men and women who served in uniform, and asking for their feedback on how best to improve the VA health care experience.
I'm continuing to urge veterans across our state to make their voices heard by participating in my "secret shopper" program that allows them to share timely, confidential feedback about their VA health care visits, and helps strengthen oversight and accountability for VA health care facilities. These surveys help give me a real snapshot of the quality of customer service our veterans are receiving.
If you or a veteran you know would like to participate in the Veterans' Customer Satisfaction Program, visit my website
McCaskill.senate.gov/VCSP
and complete the confidential survey. Responses can be submitted after each health care visit.
As the daughter of a World War II veteran, I was determined to make improvements to the VA system following reports in 2010 of problems with medical care at John Cochran VA Medical Center in St. Louis. We first launched the VCSP, starting in St. Louis. Now, the program is in its fourth year and continues to grow, with nearly 1,000 Missouri veterans participating in the last round of surveys. The survey, recently
expanded
to southeast Missouri, is now
active
in four regions: St. Louis, Kansas City, Columbia, and Poplar Bluff.
Please join me this Veterans Day by ensuring the veterans in your life are aware of how they can voice their confidential opinions at
McCaskill.senate.gov/VCSP . Our veterans have already made tremendous sacrifices, and high-quality health services shouldn't be another one.
All the best,
P.S. Last week, I had the honor of helping a veteran receive a long-overdue Puple Heart. Learn more about Reverend Leo Hardin and his story,
