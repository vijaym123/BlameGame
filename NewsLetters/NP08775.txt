Congressional Report -- Week of June 9-13: Meeting with Acting
VA Secretary in San Antonio Regarding Issues Plaguing Department
Hello Friend,
This week seemed more hectic than most in Washington D.C. There were
more votes than usual and more meetings as well, including a highly
publicized appearance by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel in the Armed
Services Committee. I literally get a front row seat since the freshman
members sit nearest the witness.
I also had great visits with constituents visiting Washington. A large
group of students from Eagle Pass stopped by on their way to New York.
I loved visiting with them. Senior Pastor Mike Harkrider of the First
Baptist Church of Boerne also brought a group of kids by to pray for
me. That, too, was a wonderful experience. Kids are such a blessing.
On Thursday afternoon, I headed to San Antonio. This afternoon, I'm
speaking at the commencement as the Class of 2014 graduates from South
San Antonio High School. On Sunday morning, I'll be on KENS5 News (7:30
a.m. CST) in San Antonio visiting with Anchor Barry Davis. I'll also
visit Del Rio and Brackettville before heading back to Washington on
Monday for another week of work in our nation's capital.
Field staff was also busy during week. Field Representatives visited
Pecos, Fort Stockton, Fort Davis, De Rio, Eagle Pass, Crystal City,
Brackettville and south and north side San Antonio..

Meeting with Acting VA Secretary in San Antonio Regarding Issues
Plaguing Department
Last week, I met with Acting VA Secretary Sloan D. Gibson at Audie L.
Murphy Memorial VA Hospital in San Antonio. During meeting, joined by
U.S. Representatives Lamar Smith (R-San Antonio) and Joaqun Castro
(D-San Antonio), I made it clear that while it's very important to get
to the root of the problem, it's just as important that veterans
currently seeking care receive it - and fast.
A recent report indicates that some facilities maintained secret wait
lists designed to hide systematic failures. Additionally, a VA audit
that examined 713 VA hospitals and large outpatient clinics indicates
more than 57,000 veterans have been waiting for more than 90 days for
an initial appointment. Over the past 10 years, 64,000 people who
enrolled in the VA's health care system never had appointments.
Imagine a veteran who narrowly escapes danger while serving overseas
only to die waiting for an appointment at the VA.
I won't give up on those that fought for us. I won't stop until every
veteran who seeks health care has it. Then - and only then - can we say
"Mission Accomplished." For more on my meeting with Acting VA Secretary
and my thoughts on how to move forward at the VA, click here

Students Accepted to U.S. Service Academies
There are many wonderful things about my job, but one of the most
rewarding is the opportunity to nominate kids to attend the US military
academies. A few days ago, I hosted a dinner honoring the Fall 2014
nominees from 23rd District of Texas and their parents. Each of the
nominees received both a Congressional Certificate and a framed copy of
Congressional Record recognizing an impressive achievement - acceptance
into a U.S. Service Academy.
In our nation's history, many of our most recognized leaders have been
graduates of a service academy. West Point is the oldest of the
academies and has the most graduates. It's a big deal to be accepted to
any of the service academies - and it marks the beginning of their
service to our great nation. These students are definitely among the
best that our nation has to offer.
Students accepted to U.S. Service Academies are:
U.S. Military Academy at West Point: Alex Forbes, Ashley Acevedo,
Bennett Gerlinger, Christian Goei, Jonah Marne, Jonathan (Steele) S.
Sessions, and Quinn M. McCuann-Berglin.
U.S. Air Force Academy: Falon Little and Ross Prado.
U.S. Naval Academy: Lauren Osterman.

United Medical Centers in South Texas Receive $4.4 Million Grant
On Wednesday, I announced a federal grant of $4,412,518 for United
Medical Centers in South Texas.
United Medical Centers provides affordable, high quality health care to
constituents of the 23rd District of Texas. These federal funds will
help the medical centers continue to operate in a growing region and
provide top notch care to thousands of people. I'm grateful for their
services and dedication to our region's healthcare needs.
United Medical Centers provides many healthcare services at 7 different
clinic sites. These services include pediatric, OB/GYN, family
medicine, ENT, internal medicine, podiatry and dental services. In
addition, they offer in-house services such as laboratory, pharmacy,
radiology, social services, family planning, WIC, HIV/AIDS testing and
counseling. For more on United Medical Centers' federal grant, click

Friendly Wager for 2014 NBA Finals With House Colleagues
The 2014 NBA Finals are underway and it's no secret that I'm a Spurs
fan - just look at my Facebook page. So, my fellow congressman, U.S.
Representative Joaqun Castro of San Antonio, and I made a friendly
wager with Florida U.S. Representatives Joe Garcia and Frederica Wilson
as our respective teams go head-to-head in the 2014 NBA Finals.
If the Spurs win the championship, Joe Garcia and Frederica Wilson will
take a picture wearing Spurs jerseys in front of the U.S. Capitol. We
will make sure to publish on social media. If Miami Heat wins the
championship, Joaqun Castro and I will take a picture wearing Miami
Heat jerseys in front of the Capitol. For more on our friendly wager,

Lastly, thanks again for letting me be your representative and your
voice in the U.S. House of Representatives. It is a privilege I am
thankful for each day. If I can help you with a federal agency or
issue, please call on any of our offices. The phone numbers and
addresses are listed below. I've never been a big fan of politics -
helping people is my favorite part of the job. Please put us to work
for you.

Regarding

Plaguing
Department Hello
Friend,
This
week
seemed
more
hectic
than

in
Washington
D.C.
There
were
more
votes
than

and
more
meetings
as
well,
including
a

appearance
by

in

I
literally

I
also
had
great

with

A

to

for
me.
That,
too,
was
a

experience.

On

I
headed

This

I'm

During

and
Joaqu&#237;n

I

it&#8217;s

and

A

report
indicates
that

Over

past
10
years,
64,000
people
who
enrolled
in
the
VA&#8217;s
health
care
system
never
had
appointments.
Imagine
a
veteran
who
narrowly
escapes
danger
while
serving
overseas
only
to
die
waiting
for
an
appointment
at
the
VA.
I
won&#8217;t
give
up
on
those
that
fought
for
us.
I
won't
stop
until
every
veteran
who
seeks
health
care
has
it.
Then
-
and
only
then
-
can
we
say
"Mission
Accomplished."

Students
Accepted
to
U.S.
Service
Academies There
are
many
wonderful
things
about
my
job,
but
one
of
the
most
rewarding
is
the
opportunity
to
nominate
kids
to
attend
the
US
military
academies.
A
few
days
ago,
I
hosted
a
dinner
honoring
the
Fall
2014
nominees
from
23rd
District
of
Texas
and
their
parents.
Each
of
the
nominees
received
both
a
Congressional
Certificate
and
a
framed
copy
of
Congressional
Record
recognizing
an
impressive
achievement
&#8211;
acceptance
into
a
U.S.
Service
Academy.
In
our
nation's
history,
many
of
our
most
recognized
leaders
have
been
graduates
of
a
service
academy.
West
Point
is
the
oldest
of
the
academies
and has
the
most
graduates.
It's
a
big
deal
to
be
accepted
to
any
of
the
service
academies
-
and
it
marks
the
beginning
of
their
service
to
our
great
nation.
These
students
are
definitely
among
the
best
that
our
nation
has
to
offer.
Students
accepted
to
U.S.

are:
U.S.
