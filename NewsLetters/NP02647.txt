Rep. Bob Goodlatte
Standing Strong for the Constitution
A decision made by a U.S.
District Court in Texas just a few days ago has had a major impact on President Obama&rsquo;s recent executive actions to unilaterally change our
immigration laws. The
court&rsquo;s injunction
temporarily halts
the President&rsquo;s deferred action program for unlawful immigrants, essentially ruling that he overstepped his powers in trying to grant legal
status and &ldquo;benefits and privileges&rdquo; to millions of illegal immigrants. In the ruling, Judge Andrew Hanen writes that these actions
represent &ldquo;a massive change in immigration practice&rdquo; and will have a significant effect on &ldquo;the nation&rsquo;s entire immigration
scheme and the states who must bear the lion&rsquo;s share of its consequences.&rdquo;
President Obama&rsquo;s executive overreach on immigration poses a clear and present danger to our Constitution. I am pleased that these
actions have been temporarily halted. This will allow a lawsuit filed by 26 states that challenges this executive overreach on immigration to move
forward.
In December, I signed an amicus brief in support of this lawsuit, which was submitted to the federal court by the American Center for Law
and Justice.
It is my hope that the Constitution will come out
on the winning side.

ruling in my weekly column.
