Blaine's Bulletin
I spend a lot of time in Washington talking about how important small businesses and their employees are to the economy and our local communities and there are some specific reasons why.
First, as a former small businessman, I understand the struggle that small businesses face and the role that employees have in their local communities. Second, as vice chairman of the House Small Business Committee, I get to interact with small business owners and their workers from across the nation that face many of the same challenges of our folks right here in Missouri, and more specifically, the 3 rd
Congressional District.
With that in mind, I am looking forward to National Small Business Week (May 12-16) which serves as a way for us to focus on the importance of small business people, their employees and the products and services they offer. More than half of Americans either own or work for small businesses and small businesses create about two out of every three jobs in our country each year.
I was proud to learn the U.S. Small Business Administration named the Woody Bogler Trucking Company of Rosebud in Franklin County as the SBA Rural Small Business of the Year for Missouri. This small business founded in 1924 operates a fleet of more than 100 tractor trailers in the lower 48 States. Its this type of commitment to employing folks and expanding economic opportunity is what motivates me to continue working on behalf of small businesses and their workers.
Meanwhile, back in Washington, I continue to work to support legislation designed to help our small businesses. For example, I recently co-sponsored H.R. 4383, the
Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection Small Business Advisory Board Act .
This bill, introduced by my colleague Robert Pittenger of North Carolina creates a new small business advisory board at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
Small business interests are not currently recognized on an advisory board council at CFPB, a group that has tremendous autonomy outside of Congress to pass regulations and other punitive measures that hamper economic growth. Since we are stuck with this group for now, I believe we must do everything we can to make the law more favorable to groups like small business people and this bill specifically creates a 12 person board consisting of members in the fields of loan officers, data collection, realtors and other small business professionals.
Without a doubt, the motivation, dedication and ingenuity of small business folks, and the people that work for them, is at the heart of economic growth and economic prosperity. I believe that as a member of Congress, I can take steps and support policies that enhance opportunities for entrepreneurs by providing conditions that set up people for success, rather than failure.
