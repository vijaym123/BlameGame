Hi
there,
Im proud to let you know my
boss, Senator Bob Menendez, received top marks on the
2014 Congressional Report Card from GovTrack , a non-partisan
government transparency website.
This is the
second year in a row
the
Senator has topped many of the GovTrack Report Card categories. Plus,
he was listed as the
most productive member of the
113 th
Congress
in Time
magazine.
Senator Menendez was rated number one on the 2014
Report Card in the following
categories:
Leadership Score
Laws Enacted
Bills
Introduced
Bills Out of
Committee
Powerful
Cosponsors
Cosponsors
While the Senator led bills on a variety
of issues, including international affairs bills he introduced as
Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he is especially proud
of both his bill fixing flood insurance rates for New Jerseyans
suffering after Superstorm Sandy and the reauthorization of the Autism CARES
Act.
These two bills, in particular, were the direct result of
New Jerseyans contacting our offices asking for help in meeting tough
challenges and making government work for
them.
I know how much he appreciated all of the input
from New Jerseyans during the 113 th
Congress and he
encourages you to continue
contacting our office
with
your ideas and opinions.
Sincerely,
End
MC Hideable
