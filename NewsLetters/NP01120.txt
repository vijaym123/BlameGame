Subject: sorry! (please read) Sorry if this email is overly direct. But we need you to chip in $5 (or more if you can) right now.
Here&rsquo;s why:
Cheri is the MOST vulnerable Congresswoman in Illinois.
Our end-of-month budget deadline is only 72 HOURS AWAY.
But as of 3pm, we're seriously behind on our online fundraising goal.
We know we ask a lot, David. But we need to make sure Cheri has the resources to fight back against Boehner&rsquo;s campaign machine -- and that starts by hitting this fundraising deadline out of the park! So, we&rsquo;re asking. Can you chip in $5 to help us close the gap? Every dollar helps.
$5
$35
$50
$100
$250

We&rsquo;re so thankful for your support.
Alex
P.S. We&rsquo;re relying on grassroots supporters like you to hit our goal ahead of the April 30th deadline.
Will you donate $5 or more right now? --
