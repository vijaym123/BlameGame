This week, President Obama delivered his sixth official State of the Union Address before a joint session of Congress.
As part of the
speech , the President announced a series of tax hikes, totaling approximately $320 billion in increased taxes, according to White House estimates.
These provisions include raising the capital gains and dividend tax rates to 28 percent
almost double 2012 rates; imposing new fees on financial institutions; and broadening the scope of the unpopular death tax. The Presidents
plan
leverages higher taxes on the backs of job creators and entrepreneurs to fund new federal programs.
Congressman Forbes has stood against raising taxes on the basis that tax increases stifle economic growth, hurt job creation, and fail to address the root issue of government spending. He has
supported
abolishing the code and starting over with a system that is simpler, fairer, and more stable.
