Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
What a week! Big Blue Nation is as proud as we could be of the
University of Kentucky Wildcats! We watched what Aaron Harrison
accurately predicted would be a "great story"
as the Cats battled "the toughest road" to the Final Four "in
NCAA tournament history."
Congratulations to Coach Cal and this team on an unbelievable season
and for reminding the world that Kentucky is home to the greatest
tradition in the history of college basketball!
I look forward to spending the next two weeks traveling across central
and eastern Kentucky and meeting with constituents!
Supporting Fair Pay for Equal Work
There is no question women should receive equal pay for equal work. The
recent jobs report showed that the unemployment rate for women
increased to 6.2 percent in March, demonstrating how badly we need real
solutions that focus on creating economic opportunities that will
provide women and men with better paying jobs.
The House has passed dozens of jobs bills, many with bipartisan
support, that would help grow the economy to create jobs for
hardworking families who are suffering in this stagnant economy.
Unfortunately, all of these proposals are gathering dust in the Senate.
It is time for Congress and the White House to lead by example and
focus on common ground and good ideas, whether they are supported by
Republicans or Democrats. The focus should not be on the political
battles in Washington, but on putting people back to work.
I was glad to speak with NewsTalk 590 WVLK-AM's Lee Cruse about this
subject on Wednesday morning. If you weren't able to tune in, you can

Advocating for our Service Men and Women
I had the opportunity this past week to testify before the House Armed
Services Committee in support of our Active Duty, Guard, and Reserve
components, as well as our veterans to help ensure they receive the
equipment and support they deserve.
I shared with the Committee several issues of concern that have been
raised by my Sixth District Veterans Coalition. As the Committee
remains committed to helping combat military sexual assault and provide
the best care possible for survivors, I encouraged them to consider
incorporating legislation that I have introduced, H.R. 3775, the
Military Sexual Assault Victim Empowerment Act, in the FY 2015 National
Defense Authorization Act. The Military SAVE Act would allow victims of
military sexual assault to choose treatment outside of the TRICARE or
VA health are network that they feel would best fit their needs. This
legislation could serve as an important tool in our ongoing efforts to
help the victims of military sexual assault.
I also advocated for additional resources to go to the VA to help
reduce their medical claims backlog; for the Committee to continue to
support increasing public-private partnerships at all arsenals and
depots like the Blue Grass Army Depot in Richmond; and for the
importance of funding mental health services like suicide prevention
and support programs for our vets.

Fulfilling My Accessibility Initiative
On Thursday morning I joined NewsTalk 590 WVLK-AM's Jack Pattie during
the 9:00 AM hour to discuss my work for the Sixth District and take
questions from callers on the issues facing our nation.
As part of my ongoing Accessibility Initiative, I join Jack the second
Thursday of each month and it is always great to hear directly from
constituents and answer their questions. I look forward to joining Jack
again next month!
Advancing No Budget, No Pay in House Budget
It's time for Congress to get serious about reducing spending. Our
conversation begins with a declaration that the federal government has
a spending problem and that our constituents sent us to Washington to
address that problem.
The next step to fixing this problem is to pass a budget that reduces
spending and fundamentally changes and reforms the way Washington
operates so we can see more economic growth and job-creation. I am
committed to turning things around to put us on a more responsible,
prosperous path for the future, but our work and responsibilities
continue.
On Thursday, the House passed with my support the House Budget
Resolution which is based on the same premise that every Kentucky
family understands: you can't continue to spend money that you don't
have.
It also includes the No Budget, No Pay Act that I support, which simply
says that Members of Congress should not get paid if they fail to pass
a budget, and is consistent with the debt-to-GDP targets included in my
legislation, H.R. 4021, the Debt Limit Reform and Congressional Pay for
Performance Act of 2014, which would combine the need for lawmakers to
focus on growing the economy with the need to restrain spending.

It's never too early to learn the importance of saving! On Friday, I
enjoyed reading a story on good financial habits to third graders in
Ms. Liz Chappel's class at Second Street School in Frankfort for Teach
Children to Save Day. Thank you to Clay Hulette and Lisa Brinley with
First Federal Savings Bank of Frankfort for their efforts to promote
this valuable initiative on behalf of the American Banker's Association
and Kentucky Banker's Association.
Kentuckians in the Capitol
On Tuesday, I met with Dr. Jeffrey Ebersole from the University of
Kentucky to discuss oral health and the importance of federal support
for research.
I appreciated an update from Dr. Rob Doudrick, Station Director for the
USDA Forest Service Southern Research Station, on the work he and the
Station are doing with the University of Kentucky's Department of
Forestry to address issues like invasive species and water quality that
threaten our woodlands and the hardwood timber industry.
I was happy to visit with representatives of rural phone and broadband
providers from across the Commonwealth, including Shayne Ison, GM of
Mountain Telephone, which serves Wolfe and Menifee Counties, to discuss
federal telecommunications regulation and expanding broadband access in
rural Kentucky.
I was happy to see Kentuckians from the Commonwealth Council on
Developmental Disabilities when they visited my DC office on Tuesday,
and discuss the ways that we can help those with disabilities reach
their potential.
Several nurse anesthetists from the Commonwealth visited my office on
Tuesday. We discussed their commitment to provide safe anesthesia care
and the ways that nurse workforce development funding ensures that our
aging population has access to the healthcare professionals and
services they need.
Taylor, Evan, Kyle and I met on Tuesday to discuss issues facing the
dental profession, as well as their desire to provide health care
services to the underserved areas of our community. They are
hard-working students in the UK College of Dentistry and I'm glad to
see them involved and interested in the legislative process.
I had a wonderful time visiting with the Wolffbrandts of Jessamine
County.
It was great to see Dr. Michael McCaul, the President of Kentucky
Community and Technical College System. I enjoyed speaking to the group
of KCTCS representatives about my work in Washington on behalf of the
Sixth District and taking their questions about the current issues
facing our country.
I enjoyed learning more about the footprint of biotechnology in
Kentucky as I visited with Kentuckians in town as part of the
Biotechnology Industry Organization fly-in.
On Wednesday, I met with Dave Maples, Gary Woodall and Tim White from
the Kentucky Cattlemen's Association. We discussed issues impacting
their industry, including EPA regulation, tax policies impacting
producers, and maintaining market access for Kentucky's agriculture
exporters.
I was intrigued to learn more about the work that Save the Children is
doing, and want to thank them for their commitment to helping children
and families in our district.
It was great to meet Dr. Nancy Cox, Dean of the UK College of
Agriculture. The Sixth District is fortunate to be the home of the
College of Agriculture and I am continually impressed with the
education, research and extension programs they provide to the
Commonwealth.
On Wednesday, I met with a great group of Kentuckians who were in town
with the American Bar Association. We had a great discussion about
preserving access to legal services and how the tax code uniquely
impacts law firms.
It is always nice to see Dr. Jimmy Henning, the Associate Dean for
Extension at the UK College of Agriculture, Mr. Drew Graham, the Senior
Assistant Dean at the UK College of Ag, and Wolfe County Extension
Agent Daniel Wilson. We discussed the positive impact the 4-H program
has on Kentucky's youth and their important mission to educate and
train the next generation of agricultural leaders.
I was honored to meet with Lieutenant Colonel Lawrence Herzog and
Colonel Barry Wright of the Military Officers of Association of
America. We shared ideas about how we can continue to help ensure our
service members receive the care and benefits they deserve.
On Wednesday, I met with individuals from Lexington in the commercial
real estate investment industry. We discussed insurance issues, tax
reform and tax code provisions that incentivize real estate investment.
On Wednesday, I had a great meeting with Colmon and Victoria Eldridge
of Georgetown, while they were in town with the Alzheimer's
Association. This disease touches so many families, and I want to thank
Colmon and Victoria for their advocacy.
Please continue to let me know your thoughts and concerns about issues
facing our community, and I hope you will forward my weekly newsletter
to your friends, family and neighbors.
You may also visit my website, Facebook and Twitter, where you can find
regular updates about my work at home in the Sixth District and in
Washington.
Thank you and have a great week!

Dear

What
a
week!
Big
Blue
Nation
is
as
proud
as
we
could
be
of
the
University
of
Kentucky
Wildcats!
We
watched
what
Aaron
Harrison

a
&#8220;great

as
the
Cats
battled
"the

to
the
Final

&#8220;in
NCAA

history.&#8221;
Congratulations
to
Coach
Cal
and
this
team
on
an
unbelievable
season
and
for
reminding
the
world
that
Kentucky
is
home
to
the
greatest

in
the
history
of

I
look
forward

spending
the
next
two

meeting

Supporting
Fair
Pay
for
Equal
Work
There
is
no
question
women
should
receive
equal
pay
for
equal
work.
The
recent
jobs
report
showed
that
the
unemployment
rate
for
women
increased
to
6.2
percent
in
March,
demonstrating
how
badly
we
need
real
solutions
that
focus
on
creating
economic
opportunities
that
will
provide
women
and
men
with
better
paying
jobs.
The
House
has
passed
dozens
of
jobs
bills,
many
with
bipartisan
support,
that
would
help
grow
the
economy
to
create
jobs
for
hardworking
families
who
are
suffering
in
this
stagnant
economy.
Unfortunately,
all
of
these
proposals
are
gathering
dust
in
the
Senate.
It
is
time
for
Congress
and
the
White
House
to
lead
by
example
and
focus
on
common
ground
and
good
ideas,
whether
they
are
supported
by
Republicans
or
Democrats.
The
focus
should
not
be
on
the
political
battles
in
Washington,
but
on
putting
people
back
to
work.
I
was
glad
to
speak
with
NewsTalk
590
WVLK-AM&#8217;s
Lee
Cruse
about
this
subject
on
Wednesday

I
had
the

this

to

I
shared
with
the
Committee
several
issues
of
concern
that
have
been
raised
by
my
Sixth
District
Veterans
Coalition.
As
the
Committee
remains
committed
to
helping
combat
military
sexual

and
provide
the

possible
for
survivors,
I
encouraged
them
to

H.R.
3775,
the
Military
Sexual
Assault
Victim
Empowerment
Act,
in
the
FY
2015
National

Act.
The
Military
SAVE
Act
would
allow
victims
of
military
sexual

to
choose
treatment
outside
of
the
TRICARE
or
VA
health
are
network
that
they
feel
would
best
fit
their
needs.
This
legislation
could
serve
as
an
important
tool
in
our
ongoing
efforts
to
help
the
victims
of
military
sexual
assault.
I
also
advocated
for

reduce
their

It&#8217;s

Our

with
a

that
the

the

On
Tuesday,
I
met
with
Dr.
Jeffrey
Ebersole
from
the
University
of
Kentucky
to
discuss
oral
health
and
the
importance
of
federal

for
research.
I
appreciated
an
update
from
Dr.
Rob
Doudrick,
Station

Kentucky&#8217;s
Department
of
Forestry
to
address
issues
like
invasive
species
and
water
quality
that
threaten
our
woodlands
and
the
hardwood
timber
industry.
I
was
happy
to
visit
with
representatives
of
rural
phone
and
broadband
providers
from
across
the
Commonwealth,
including
Shayne
Ison,
GM
of
Mountain
Telephone,
which
serves
Wolfe
and
Menifee
Counties,
to
discuss
federal
telecommunications
regulation
and
expanding

rural
Kentucky.
I
was
happy
to
see
Kentuckians
from
the
Commonwealth
Council
on
Developmental
Disabilities
when
they
visited
my
DC
office
on
Tuesday,
and
discuss
the
ways

we
can
help
those
with
disabilities
reach
their
potential.
Several
nurse
anesthetists
from
the
Commonwealth
visited
my

on
Tuesday.
We
discussed
their
commitment
to
provide
safe

and
the
ways
that
nurse
workforce
development
funding
ensures
that
our
aging

facing
the
dental
profession,
as
well
as
their
desire
to
provide
health
care
services
to
the
underserved
areas
of
our

They
are
hard-working

in
the
UK

and
I&#8217;m
glad

my
work
in
Washington
on
behalf
of
the
Sixth
District
and
taking
their
questions
about
the
current

I
enjoyed
learning
more
about
the

of
biotechnology
in
Ken tucky
as
I
visited

exporters.
I
was
intrigued
to
learn
more
about
the
work
that
Save
the
Children
is
doing,
and
want
to
thank
them
for
their
commitment
to
helping
children
and
families
in
our
district.
It
was
great
to
meet
Dr.
Nancy
Cox,
Dean
of
the
UK
College
of
Agriculture.
The
Sixth
District
is
fortunate
to
be
the
home
of
the
College
of
Agriculture
and
I
am
continually
impressed
with
the
education,
research
and
extension
programs
they
provide
to
the
Commonwealth.
On
Wednesday,
I
met
with
a
great
group
of
Kentuckians
who
were
in
town
with
the
American
Bar
Association.
We
had
a
great
discussion
about
preserving
access
to
legal
services
and
how
the
tax
code
uniquely
impacts
law
firms.
It
is

has
on
Kentucky&#8217;s
youth
and
their
important
mission
to
educate
and
train
the
next
generation
of
agricultural
leaders.
I
was
honored
to
meet
with
Lieutenant
Colonel
Lawrence
Herzog
and
Colonel
Barry
Wright
of
the
Military

of
Association
of
America.
We
shared
ideas
about
how
we
can
continue
to
help
ensure
our
service
members
receive
the
care
and
benefits
they
deserve.
On
Wednesday,
I
met
with
individuals
from
Lexington
in
the
commercial
real
estate
investment
industry.
We
discussed
insurance
issues,
tax
reform
and
tax
code
provisions
that
incentivize
real
estate
investment.
On
Wednesday,
I
had
a
great
meeting
with
Colmon
and
Victoria
Eldridge
of
Georgetown,
while
they
were
in
town
with
the
Alzheimer&#8217;s
Association.
This
disease
touches
so
many
families,
and
I
want
to
thank
Colmon
and
Victoria
for
their
advocacy.
