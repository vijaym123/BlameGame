Dear David,
As we
enter the sixth year under the Obama Administration, weve learned
that December marked the weakest month of job growth since January 2011.
Nearly 350,000 Americans dropped out of the workforce last month,
dragging the labor force participation rate to its lowest level in 36
years.
One of the more burdensome and devastating policies
for the economy and job creation is the presidents own signature health
care law. Thanks to ObamaCare, millions of Americans have lost
coverage, lost jobs, lost doctors, and must pay higher health insurance
premiums and deductibles they cannot afford.
Not surprisingly,
poll after poll shows most Americans still
disapprove
of ObamaCare as well as the presidents
job
performance .
Im fighting to repeal ObamaCare
because its bad for Missouri families
and I want to hear how this
law is impacting
you.
