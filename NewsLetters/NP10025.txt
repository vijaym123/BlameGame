Dear
friends,
Today, I and the rest of the Idaho delegation were at Gowen Field and
Mountain Home Air Force Base to meet with General Mark A. Welsh III, the
Chief of Staff of the Air Force.
As Chief of Staff, General Welsh
is the senior uniformed Air Force officer responsible for the
organization, training, and equipping of 690,000 active-duty, Air National
Guard, Air Force Reserve, and civilian forces.
A few months ago,
we invited General Welsh to come to Idaho to tour our world-class
facilities and witness the dedication of our service members.
General
Welsh accepted our invitation, and we are grateful that he made the
trip to see everything Gowen Field and Mountain Home Air Force Base
have to offer.
As you probably know, Gowen Field Air
National Guard Base is the home base of the Idaho Air National Guards
124th Fighter Wing and its 22 A-10s.
Recently, there have been
proposals to move some of the Air National Guards operations from Gowen
Field to Mountain Home Air Force Base.
There have also been
proposals to retire the A-10 and replace it with something else.
These
proposals could affect the lives of many
Idahoans.
General Welsh made it clear that these are fiscally difficult times,
and he along with other military brass are examining all options as they
seek to adjust to current and future budget constraints.
I
appreciated his candidness in recognizing the need for cuts.
I also
appreciated that he took the time to visit two of our military's
greatest assets - Gowen Field and Mountain Home Air Force Base - so he
could truly understand all that these facilities have to
offer.
General Welshs trip
and the unity of our delegation
will
count for a lot as we work with the Guard and the Air Force to keep
these assets strong and competitive.
Our goal is to ensure a
long-term, viable air mission for the Idaho Air National Guard, and we will
continue to work with all the relevant stakeholders to determine the
best way to achieve that goal.
So far, our discussions have been
productive and encouraging, and they will continue. By continuing
to work together, we can ensure that the future of the Idaho Air
National Guard is a bright one.
