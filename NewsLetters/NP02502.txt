Friends,
Yesterday, I
voted against
the Senate-passed legislation that funds the Department of Homeland Security through September 2015
but does not deny funding for President Obamas unconstitutional executive actions.
In working to stop the presidents unconstitutional executive amnesty plan, I believe Congress should use every tool, including the power of the purse. While its true that the presidents actions are currently blocked by a federal judge, the legal process is far from over and the current decision could be reversed.
I voted against the Senate bill because it surrenders the power of the purse for the rest of the fiscal year.
But the fight will continue, and I remain committed to finding solutions that keep the government open and shut the president down.
