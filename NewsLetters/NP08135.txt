Dear Friend,
As I continue to meet with individuals,
families, and small businesses across
Ohios 16th District, I repeatedly
here about the negative effect rising gas
prices has on their budgets. In some areas
in Northeast Ohio, prices have reached
nearly $4 a gallon already this summer. In
fact, the average price of a gallon of gas
in Ohio is 20 cents higher than the
national average.
At a time when our economy remains
slowed following years of this
administrations failed policies, the
last thing Ohioans need is to spend more
money to drive to the grocery store or to
work. That is why we in the House of
Representatives have acted repeatedly to
bring down the cost of fuel and decrease
Americas dependence on foreign oil.
Just this past week, the House passed a
series of bills that will unleash the power
of Americas energy resources.
Along with many Democrats, Republicans,
and Independents in Congress, I have
remained a strong proponent of the Keystone
XL Pipeline, a project that would create
20,000 American jobs and bring down the
cost of fuel. Despite several studies that
confirm the Keystone Pipeline would not
have an effect on climate change, President
Obama refuses to approve the project. Last
week, the House passed the North American
Energy and Infrastructure Act, a bill that
reduces Washington red tape by creating an
approval process for pipelines that cross
the U.S. border. Specifically, this
legislation requires the permitting agency
to approve an application within 120 days,
unless the agency finds that it is
not in the national security interests of
the United States. Politics should
never get in the way of economic growth and
job creation, and this bill will ensure
that projects like Keystone will not be
held up for political purposes by any
administration in the future.
Additionally, the House passed the
Domestic Prosperity and Global Freedom Act.
This legislation expedites exports of
liquefied natural gas (LNG) to our allies
and trading partners, and will lead to a
stronger economy and strengthened energy
security. The recent natural gas boom in
America has led more American companies to
seek permission to export LNG, which has
the potential to create more than 450,000
American jobs and more than 30,000 jobs
right here in Ohio by 2035.
Lastly, the House passed the Lowering
Gasoline Prices to Fuel an America that
Works Act, a bill that will ease the pain
at the pump for Ohioans by expanding our
domestic energy production. By requiring
the administration to move forward with new
offshore energy production in areas rich in
oil and natural gas, we will have the
opportunity to fully harness our energy
potential.
At a time when Ohioans are paying more
and more for their gasoline, there is no
better time than now to act to bring down
the cost of fuel. From 2012 to 2013, oil
production in Ohio doubled and natural gas
production increased by more than 40
percent
proving that Ohio is a
leader in energy production. The bills that
passed the House this week are components
of our all-of-the-above energy strategy
that will expand energy production in Ohio,
lower fuel prices, and ultimately lead to
our energy security. I will continue to
fight for commonsense solutions that will
clear the way for job creation and
environmentally safe energy cultivation in
Ohio.
Thank you to all of those who came
out to our Veterans Health and Wellness
Resource Fair. I hope that our veterans
and military families found it to be
helpful, and I encourage all of those
living in Ohio's 16th district to use my
office as a resource. We stand ready to
assist you.
Thanks to EBO Group for giving me a
tour of PT Tech Facilities and
TransMotion Medical Facilities in Medina.
I enjoyed learning more about EBO Group
and had a great discussion with its
employees about my work in
Washington.
