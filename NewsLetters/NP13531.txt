FROM THE DESK OF CONGRESSMAN YOHO
Friends,
On December 12th 2013, the House of Representatives passed a Budget
agreement that would set the spending parameters for 2014. It was the
first time in decades that a budget has been agreed to and will end the
cycle of stop-gap measures that has plagued Congress, and this country,
for years. If there is one thing I have noticed in my time here it is
that Congress is in non-stop crisis mode. With that type of mindset
you'd think that Congress would be serious about solving our nation's
pressing issues.
However, I've found this type of crisis management doesn't focus on the
pressing issues and hard decisions that need to be made---rather it
focuses on getting through the crisis of the moment...at any cost.
Every time Congress approaches a point where the government will run
out of money instead of taking a hard look at what should be cut, the
pressure is on to pass what is called a "continuing resolution" to fund
the government and push those hard decisions to another day.
This is the proverbial kicking the can down the road, which has caused
our trillions of dollars of debt. These continuing resolutions are like
rubber stamps that allow current spending. By perpetuating the status
quo, it can lead to greater spending in the long run. This type of
spending lacks foresight, stability, and the proper oversight that our
Founding Fathers intended us to have over the budgetary process. They
intended for Members of Congress to tackle these issues individually so
we can focus on how money is being spent and why. These constant
continuing resolutions hurt that process because they are large
all-inclusive bills that are crafted without the proper scrutiny that
is needed. This process hinders our ability to cut what needs to be cut
and spend your tax dollars more efficiently.
How do we stop this expensive way of governing? We return to the normal
budgetary process by having both the House and Senate agree to specific
parameters and then pass appropriations bills the way we are suppose
to. This allows your Representatives to make repeals, restraints, and
most importantly cuts to spending that are needed. A normal budget
process brings spending bills back into the sunlight and gives their
drafting the careful consideration they deserve.
The Constitution is very clear: "No money shall be drawn from the
Treasury but in consequence of Appropriations made by law" (Art. 1
Sect. 9 Cl. 7). Voting for a return to the normal budgetary process
brings our spending back to the way our Founders intended. By voting in
favor of the budget resolution, I voted for a return to this process so
that we can make the cuts needed to get our country back on track.
I came to Congress to help solve our nation's fiscal problems. These
problems are very real and need true solutions, not empty rhetoric that
makes you feel better in the moment. This budget agreement was the
first product in a while that, rather than perpetuating the
near-sighted and often expensive status quo, offered a tangible plan to
reduce the deficit and tackle mandatory spending.
This budget agreement is only a blueprint. Now that we are able to
properly scrutinize our spending bills, we can make the cuts that are
desperately needed.
Additionally, last week I cosponsored legislation that would repeal the
provision in the resolution that would affect military pensions. In
order to offset that repeal, this legislation would tackle child tax
credits that are being sent out fraudulently. By ensuring that
recipients have proper Social Security Numbers, we can cut down on
fraud and save billions of dollars. That money can then be used to
reinstate any effect this legislation had on military pensions.
Also, Congress will ensure that retired pay for disabled veterans are
not affected as well as those who receive survivor benefits. Finally, I
am working on my own legislation to make sure there is parity among any
changes to veteran's pensions and Members of Congress and the
Administration's pensions. If there is a change to veteran's pensions,
so too should there be one for Members of Congress. We have a
responsibility to live by the laws we pass. As these bills move
forward, rest assured I will keep you informed.
Take care,
Ted
BILL SPOTLIGHT
H.R. 3788: Legislation to repeal the reductions in military retirement
benefits made by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 and to require
inclusion of the taxpayer's Social Security Number to claim the

What It Does: This bill would repeal any changes to veteran's pensions
and offset it by requiring recipients of the Child Tax Credit are legal
citizens.
"I supported the budget resolution to return us to a normal budgetary
process and I liked the fact that it finally addressed mandatory
spending--which accounts for most of our spending. However, I did not
like that veteran's pensions were changed when there are so many
mandatory programs that should be reformed first. This bill instead
goes after fraudulent payments in the Child Tax Credit program which
saves billions of dollars which can be used to offset the veteran's
pension change. For that reason, I cosponsored this legislation."

FROM
THE
DESK
OF
CONGRESSMAN
YOHO
Friends,
On
December
12th
2013,
the
House
of
Representatives
passed
a
Budget
agreement
that
would
set
the
spending
parameters
for
2014.
It
was
the
first
time
in
decades
that
a
budget
has
been
agreed
to
and
will
end
the
cycle
of
stop-gap
measures
that
has
plagued
Congress,
and
this
country,
for
years.
If
there
is
one
thing
I
have
noticed
in
my
time
here
it
is
that
Congress
is
in
non-stop
crisis
mode.
With
that
type
of
mindset
you'd
think
that
Congress
would
be
serious
about
solving
our
nation's
pressing
issues.
However,
I've
found
this
type
of
crisis
management
doesn't
focus
on
the
pressing
issues
and
hard
decisions
that
need
to
be
made---rather
it
focuses
on
getting
through
the
crisis
of
the
moment...at
any
cost.
Every
time
Congress
approaches
a
point
where
the
government
will
run
out
of
money
instead
of
taking
a
hard
look
at
what
should
be
cut,
the
pressure
is
on
to
pass
what
is
called
a
"continuing
resolution"
to
fund
the
government
and
push
those
hard
decisions
to
another
day.
This
is
the
proverbial
kicking
the
can
down
the
road,
which
has
caused
our
trillions
of
dollars
of
debt.
These
continuing
resolutions
are
like
rubber
stamps
that
allow
current
spending.
By
perpetuating
the
status
quo,
it
can
lead
to
greater
spending
in
the
long
run.
This
type
of
spending
lacks
foresight,
stability,
and
the
proper
oversight
that
our
Founding
Fathers
intended
us
to
have
over
the
budgetary
process.
They
intended
for
Members
of
Congress
to
tackle
these
issues
individually
so
we
can
focus
on
how
money
is
being
spent
and
why.
These
constant
continuing
resolutions
hurt
that
process
because
they
are
large
all-inclusive
bills
that
are
crafted
without
the
proper
scrutiny
that
is
needed.
This
process
hinders
our
ability
to
cut
what
needs
to
be
cut
and
spend
your
tax
dollars
more
efficiently.
How
do
we
stop
this
expensive
way
of
governing?
We
return
to
the
normal
budgetary
process
by
having
both
the
House
and
Senate
agree
to
specific
parameters
and
then
pass
appropriations
bills
the
way
we
are
suppose
to.
This
allows
your
Representatives
to
make
repeals,
restraints,
and
most
importantly
cuts
to
spending
that
are
needed.
A
normal
budget
process
brings
spending
bills
back
into
the
sunlight
and
gives
their
drafting
the
careful
consideration
they
deserve.
The
Constitution
is
very
clear:
"No
money
shall
be
drawn
from
the
Treasury
but
in
consequence
of
Appropriations
made
by
law"
(Art.
1
Sect.
9
Cl.
7).
Voting
for
a
return
to
the
normal
budgetary
process
brings
our
spending
back
to
the
way
our
Founders
intended.
By
voting
in
favor
of
the
budget
resolution,
I
voted
for
a
return
to
this
process
so
that
we
can
make
the
cuts
needed
to
get
our
country
back
on
track.
I
came
to
Congress
to
help
solve
our
nation's
fiscal
problems.
These
problems
are
very
real
and
need
true
solutions,
not
empty
rhetoric
that
makes
you
feel
better
in
the
moment.
This
budget
agreement
was
the
first
product
in
a
while
that,
rather
than
perpetuating
the
near-sighted
and
often
expensive
status
quo,
offered
a
tangible
plan
to
reduce
the
deficit
and
tackle
mandatory
spending.
This
budget
agreement
is
only
a
blueprint.
Now
that
we
are
able
to
properly
scrutinize
our
spending
bills,
we
can
make
the
cuts
that
are
desperately
needed.
Additionally,
last
week
I
cosponsored
legislation
that
would
repeal
the
provision
in
the
resolution
that
would
affect
military
pensions.
In
order
to
offset
that
repeal,
this
legislation
would
tackle
child
tax
credits
that
are
being
sent
out
fraudulently.
By
ensuring
that
recipients
have
proper
Social
Security
Numbers,
we
can
cut
down
on
fraud
and
save
billions
of
dollars.
That
money
can
then
be
used
to
reinstate
any
effect
this
legislation
had
on
military
pensions.
Also,
Congress
will
ensure
that
retired
pay
for
disabled
veterans
are
not
affected
as
well
as
those
who
receive
survivor
benefits.
Finally,
I
am
working
on
my
own
legislation
to
make
sure
there
is
parity
among
any
changes
to
veteran's
pensions
and
Members
of
Congress
and
the
Administration's
pensions.
If
there
is
a
change
to
veteran's
pensions,
so
too
should
there
be
one
for
Members
of
Congress.
We
have
a
responsibility
to
live
by
the
laws
we
pass.
As
these
bills
move
forward,
rest
assured
I
will
keep
you
informed.
Take
care,
Ted
