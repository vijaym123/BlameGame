The
Kilah Davenport Child Protection Act of 2013
approved by the House of
Representatives
Congressman Pittenger telling Kilah
Davenport's story on the House floor. Watch the full video on
Youtube .
The
Kilah Davenport Child Protection Act of 2013
was officially
approved by the United States House of Representatives on December 9th,
passing
unanimously
with
full bipartisan
support .
No child
should ever become the face of child abuse legislation , making
December 9th a bittersweet day. Sweet Kilah and her family watched
Congress debate and then pass the legislation from their home near
Charlotte, where Kilahs mother and grandmother work full-time to care for
her needs.
The Davenports have
every right to be bitter, but to their great credit they have chosen
to
work tirelessly to bring much good out of great
evil
and are using Kilahs horrific abuse as a rallying cry to
strengthen child abuse penalties across America.
The
Kilah Davenport Child Protection Act of
2013
(H.R. 3627):
Creates a comprehensive report on child abuse
penalties in each state, the District of Columbia, and all U.S.
territories.
Examines whether or not existing laws provide enhanced penalties in
cases of severe child abuse.
Directs the U.S. Attorney General to finish the
report in six months, with a follow-up report in three
years.

Davenport family, shortly after announcing
Kilah's Law
in
March.

The goal? To highlight which states have inadequate child abuse laws
and lenient penalties, and motivate them to take action before another
tragedy occurs.
Kilah
Davenport was just three years old when she was severely beaten by her
caregiver, leaving her with serious and permanent mental and physical
disabilities. If convicted, Kilahs alleged abuser will spend only
four to six years in prison. The Kilah Davenport tragedy highlighted
North Carolinas inadequate child abuse laws, which were significantly
strengthened earlier this year.
The next step is for the United States Senate to quickly approve their
version of this legislation, which Senator Richard Burr introduced
last week. Following Senate approval, the
Kilah Davenport Child
Protection Act of 2013
will go to President Obama for his
signature.
The
Kilah Davenport Child
Protection Act
was my first piece of legislation to be passed by
the House of Representatives. While I deeply wish little Kilah had
never suffered abuse, I am honored to play a small part in the Davenport
familys efforts to end child abuse.

Common Sense Solutions to America's
Healthcare Problems
Congressman
Pittenger on Fox Business , discussing the shortcomings
of Obamacare.
Almost 500,000 North
Carolinians received cancellation letters because of the Affordable Care Act.
Yet according to the
latest
numbers , only 8,970 have successfully selected a new plan on the
Healthcare.gov marketplace.
There is no question our health care system needs significant reform,
but the one-size-fits-all model of Obamacare is clearly not
working.
Last week, I joined over 30 of my colleagues in
asking for a meeting with President Obama to discuss serious ideas for
meaningful, successful, health care reform.
Our
proposals include:
Making health insurance companies compete
nationwide , giving Americans the freedom to buy health insurance from any
provider.
Guaranteeing people with pre-existing
conditions get affordable coverage
by creating high risk
pools with premium caps.
Providing a universal tax incentive for buying health
insurance .
Empowering
families with tax-free Health Savings Accounts , which will
encourage financial stability.
Making bills understandable, and providing upfront
information on pricing . You can check reviews and price-check a TV
before buying, so why not health care? Informed choices are better
choices.
Allow small
businesses and other groups to pool their coverage . Allowing
small business to get the same insurance rates as large corporations
will lower costs.
Cracking down on junk lawsuits . Doctors should focus on
treating you, not defending themselves against frivolous lawsuits. We propose
capping attorney fees and other common-sense reforms to the legal
system.
Reducing the
doctor shortage
by providing incentives for primary care
physicians to work in underserved areas.
Giving states flexibility to improve Medicare
through innovation . After being freed from some federal mandates,
Rhode Island increased choice and expanded access for low-income
residents while reducing costs. North Carolina should have the freedom to
do the same.
In June, I
became the first North Carolina Congressman to co-sponsor the
Empowering Patients First Act
(H.R. 2300), a comprehensive, practical, affordable plan which repeals
and replaces the Affordable Care Act with many of these same
suggestions. Despite what you hear in the mainstream media, Republicans are
offering real solutions to the real problems in Americas health care
system.
