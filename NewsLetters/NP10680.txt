The FY2015 Budget
The House of Representatives approved the FY15 Budget Resolution last
week, with my full support. The budget balances over 10 years, makes a
significant dent in our nation's overspending, and saves important
trust fund programs -- like Medicare -- from bankruptcy and collapse.
Budgets are a statement of values and priorities, and to see an
alternative path to the House budget one need look no further than the
President's budget.
His budget -- which failed on the floor of the
House -- would have asked American taxpayers to spend almost $6
trillion on interest payments alone in the next 10 years. That's $6
trillion that doesn't build a single road, help a single student, pay a
single soldier, or protect a single senior...and those interest
payments go primarily to repay debt that the President borrowed at the
lowest interest rates in modern American history.
Can you imagine what
will happen when interest rates inevitably rise?
Despite raising taxes
by nearly $2 trillion, the President continues to borrow more and more
without any intention of paying back one penny of debt...not next year,
not five years from now, not 10 years from now, not 20 years from now;
in fact, not ever, according to his budget.
America does indeed have a choice of two futures, and the House budget
invests in our future by making tough choices today so that we don't
throw money in a bottomless pit of debt tomorrow.
What's more, the House budget provides people with what they need most -
a helping hand and hope that they can provide better lives for their
children than they have today. That's the American Dream.
Budgets are not simply numbers on a page; they are an accounting of
where our country is today and how we want it to be governed tomorrow.
It would have been easier to forego passing a budget this year, but the
easy way isn't the right way.
The American people deserve a Congress
that works.
My colleagues and I on the House Budget Committee are
proud to lay out a vision of lower deficits, higher economic growth,
and more jobs for hard-working Americans.

As an aside, this will be the last year that you hear about the "Paul
Ryan budget."
His budget writing ends with this budget, and what a
transformative era it has been.
The Woodall Budget
I again led the conservative effort to craft an alternative budget
proposal - the Republican Study Committee proposal - which would bring
our nation's budget to balance within four years. I serve on the Budget
Committee, and in that capacity, I work with Paul Ryan to write a
budget that can pass the House.
It is the best that we can do with the
House that we have today.
As Chairman of the Republican Study
Committee Budget and Spending Task Force, my job is to write a budget
of what could be done if only we had enough votes to do it.
While we
did not get enough votes to pass the House, it did receive a majority
of votes from my fellow Republican conference members, and I am so
pleased by that.
Last year, I also wrote and presented a budget -- one
of only six Members of Congress to do that each year -- and I am
winning more votes each year!
Our RSC budget commits us to make tough choices - even tougher choices
than the House budget - and I'm proud of that. I came to Washington as
your representative to do what is right, not what is easy.
Baseline Reform Act
Another budget bill that passed last week was my bill; H.R. 1871, the
"Baseline Reform Act." This bill asks the Congressional Budget Office
to develop a budget baseline that eliminates the practice of
automatically assuming increased spending year after year. This
irresponsible practice is why Congress can call an increase in spending
a cut in spending, and it needs to end now.
I am proud to have passed
this bill last week with bipartisan support, and I will now focus on
convincing the Senate to send it to the President's desk.
Good Work is Being Done in Forsyth County
A few weeks ago I had the pleasure of meeting with an amazing young
lady from South Forsyth High School - Kelsey Hirsch - who is a crusader
for her fellow young people. You may now know it, but April is National
Sexual Assault Awareness Month, and Kelsey is leading a campaign in our
community to protect young people from sexual assault and to help those
who have experienced this violence to recover and to thrive. I took
some time on the House floor last Friday to let America know the very
good work that Kelsey and her supporters are doing for our Forsyth
County community.
I am always proud to highlight the great work that our neighbors are
doing in the Seventh District of Georgia.
I hope that you will take a
moment to talk with me the next time that you see me in Georgia about
those heroes in our midst who deserve to be recognized and celebrated.
Holding Iran Accountable
The House joined the Senate last week in sending a resolution to
President Barack Obama giving him the authority to deny entry to the
U.S. anyone who had participated in terrorist activity against the U.S.
This issue is of critical importance to our nation.
We simply cannot
allow an Iranian diplomat who took part in the 1979 hostage crisis to
be allowed to enter the U.S.

Last week I co-sponsored H.Res. 109
, a bill that
expresses congressional support for the Baha'i community in Iran.
For
many years, Iran's leadership has persecuted Iranians who practice the
Baha'i faith, routinely denying them the most basic of human,
political, and civil rights.
The Week Ahead
I am home in Georgia with you this week as Congress is adjourned for
the Easter/Passover District Work Period.
I am visiting with
constituents and businesses all across the district, listening to and
learning from them.
I look forward to sharing much of what I learn in
next week's newsletter.
Sincerely,
Member of Congress
The
FY2015
Budget
The
House
of
Representatives
approved
the
FY15
Budget
Resolution
last
week,
with
my
full
support. The
budget
balances
over
10
years,
makes
a
significant
dent
in
our
nation&#8217;s
overspending,
and
saves
important
trust
fund
programs
--
like
Medicare
--
from
bankruptcy
and
collapse.
Budgets
are
a
statement
of
values
and
priorities,
and
to
see
an
alternative
path
to
the
House
budget
one
need
look
no
further
than
the
President&#8217;s
budget.
His
budget --
which
failed
on
the
floor
of
the
House
--
would
have
asked
American
taxpayers
to
spend almost
$6
trillion
on
interest
payments
alone
in
the
next
10
years. That&#8217;s
$6
trillion
that
doesn't build
a
single
road,
help
a
single
student,
pay
a
single
soldier,
or
protect
a
single
senior...and
those
interest
payments
go
primarily
to
repay
debt
that
the
President
borrowed
at
the
lowest
interest
rates
in
modern
American
history.
Can
you
imagine
what
will
happen
when
interest
rates
inevitably
rise?
Despite
raising
taxes
by
nearly
$2
trillion,
the
President
continues
to
borrow
more
and
more
without
any
intention
of
paying
back
one
penny
of debt...not
next
year,
not
five
years
from
now,
not
10
years
from
now,
not
20
years
from
now;
in
fact,
not
ever,
according
to
his
budget.
America
does
indeed
have
a
choice
of
two
futures,
and
the House
budget
invests
in
our
future
by
making
tough
choices
today
so
that
we
don&#8217;t
throw
money
in
a
bottomless
pit
of
debt
tomorrow.
What&#8217;s
more,
the
House
budget
provides
people
with
what
they
need
most
&#8211;
a
helping
hand
and
hope
that
they
can
provide
better
lives
for
their
children
than
they
have
today. That&#8217;s
the
American
Dream.
Budgets
are
not
simply
numbers
on
a
page;
they
are
an
accounting
of
where
our
country
is
today
and
how
we
want
it
to
be
governed
tomorrow.
It
would
have
been
easier
to
forego
passing
a
budget
this
year,
but
the
easy
way
isn't
the
right
way.
The
American
people
deserve
a
Congress
that
works.
My
colleagues
and
I
on
the
House
Budget
Committee
are
proud
to
lay

a

of
lower
deficits,
higher
economic
growth,
and
more

As
an
aside,
this
will
be
the
last
year
that
you
hear
about
the
"Paul
Ryan
budget."
His
budget
writing
ends
with
this
budget,
and
what
a
transformative
era
it
has
been.
The
Woodall
Budget
I
again
led
the
conservative
effort
to
craft
an
alternative
budget
proposal
&#8211;
the
Republican
Study
Committee
proposal
&#8211;
which
would
bring
our
nation&#8217;s
budget
to
balance
within
four
years. I
serve
on
the
Budget
Committee,
and
in
that
capacity,
I
work
with
Paul
Ryan
to
write
a
budget
that
can
pass
the
House.
It
is
the
best
that
we
can
do
with
the
House
that
we
have
today.
As
Chairman
of
the
Republican
Study
Committee
Budget
and
Spending
Task
Force,
my
job
is
to
write
a
budget
of
what
could
be
done
if
only
we
had
enough
votes
to
do
it.
While
we
did
not get
enough
votes
to
pass
the
House, it
did
receive
a
majority
of
votes
from
my
fellow
Republican
conference
members,
and
I
am
so
pleased
by
that.
Last
year,
I
also
wrote
and
presented
a
budget
--
one
of
only
six Members
of
Congress
to
do
that
each
year
--
and
I
am
winning
more
votes
each
year!
Our
RSC
budget
commits
us
to
make
tough
choices
&#8211;
even
tougher
choices
than
the
House
budget
&#8211;
and
I&#8217;m
proud
of
that. I
came
to
Washington
as
your
representative
to
do
what
is
right,
not
what
is
easy.
Baseline
Reform
Act
Another
budget
bill
that
passed
last
week
was
my
bill;
H.R.
1871,
the
&#8220;Baseline
Reform
Act.&#8221; This
bill
asks
the
Congressional
Budget
Office
to
develop
a
budget
baseline
that
eliminates
the
practice
of
automatically
assuming increased
spending
year
after
year. This
irresponsible
practice
is
why
Congress
can
call
an
increase
in
spending
a
cut
in
spending,
and
it
needs
to
end
now.
I
am
proud
to
have
passed
this
bill
last
week
with
bipartisan
support,
and
I
will
now
focus
on
convincing
the
Senate
to
send
it
to
the
President's
desk.

A

to
protect

from

and
to

those
who
have
experienced

took
some

on

last
Friday
to
let
America
know
the
very
good
work
that
Kelsey
and
her
supporters
are
doing
for
our

community.
I
am always
proud
to highlight
the
great
work
that
our
neighbors
are
doing
in
the
Seventh

I
hope
that
you
will
take
a
moment
to
talk
with
me
the
next
time
that
you
see
me
in
Georgia
about
those
heroes
in
our
midst
who
deserve
to
be
recognized
and
celebrated.
