Dear Friend,
Sadly, headlines about the Department of Veterans Affairs are piling up
as veterans - those who bravely served to protect our way of life -
have been put on unending wait lists and are receiving second-rate
treatment. As a country, we must never take for granted the sacrifice
of our veterans, and just as these patriots upheld their commitment to
serve our country, we owe it to them to uphold our commitment to care
for them during and after their service.
Which is why I'm launching 'Share Your VA Story' on my website, to give
veterans the opportunity to have their voices heard, and to help me
identify the bureaucratic and systemic problems within that VA that
need to be fixed.
If you or someone you know have been impacted by the VA's
mismanagement, please take a minute and tell your story, so I can
continue working to make sure America's veterans receive the care they
have earned and deserve.
To share your story, please visit my official website,
fincher.house.gov.
Thank you,

Dear
Friend,
Sadly,
headlines
about
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
are
piling
up
as
veterans
&#8211;
those
who
bravely
served
to
protect
our
way
of
life
&#8211;
have
been
put
on
unending
wait
lists
and
are
receiving
second-rate
treatment.
As
a
country,
we
must
never
take
for
granted
the
sacrifice
of
our
veterans,
and
just
as
these
patriots
upheld
their
commitment
to
serve
our
country,
we
owe
it
to
them
to
uphold
our
commitment
to
care
for
them
during
and
after
their
service.
Which
is
why
I&#8217;m
launching
&#8216; Share
Your

Story &#8217;
on
my
website,
to
give
veterans
the
opportunity
to
have
their

and
to

the
bureaucratic

systemic
problems
within
that
VA
that
need

If
you
or
someone
you
know
have
been
impacted
by
the
VA&#8217;s
mismanagement,
please
take
a
minute
and
tell
your
story,
so
I
can
continue
working
to
make
sure
America's
veterans
receive
the
care
they
have
earned
and
deserve.
