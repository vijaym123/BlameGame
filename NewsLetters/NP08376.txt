As Summer Begins, Student Loan Issue Heats
Up
Throughout my time as your representative in Congress, I have
always fought for commonsense solutions that will help students attend
college and repay their loans without difficulty.
Eliminating
inefficiencies in the current system, such as government-backed loans
that put taxpayers on the hook for unpaid loans, ended up saving
taxpayers billions of dollars and eliminated the middle man in student
lending to make the program more streamlined.
Since 1983, I have
introduced legislation to make student loan payments based on a borrower's
earnings rather than fixed monthly payments that all too often leave
students struggling to make ends meet.
In recent weeks, there
has been a renewed focus on this idea as we look towards student loan
reform.
On June 9, President Obama announced
that he would unilaterally expand his failed Pay As You Earn (PAYE)
program that offers an income-based repayment option for students with
complete forgiveness of the loan after 20 years.
There are a few problems with this action .
Fundamentally,
it moves us in the wrong direction by expanding a little-used program.
Taking a program that already exists, but is only used by 1 out
of 10 eligible borrowers, and simply offering them more generous terms
at an enormous cost to taxpayers will not address the problem.
At best, it's a band-aid, but more likely it is just another political
talking point at students' expense.
The
same week,
the Senate rejected a proposal
by
Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) that would allow students to refinance their
loans at a lower interest rate, thereby saving them money.
This
also moves us in the wrong direction.
The estimated cost of
this proposal would be
$52 billion .
And if the cost
isn't enough, it does not even address the underlying problem.
A student paying $400 a month in student loan payments who refinances
and saves $30 a month is probably still going to be burdened by the
payment, especially if that student loses their job.
I addressed
this in a
recent letter to the editor to the
Wisconsin State Journal
in response to their
editorial.
No more political games.
Even
liberal-leaning television host Jon Stewart
called out Senator Chuck
Schumer (D-NY) about the realistic chances of Senator Warren's
proposal becoming law, and asked "what about the Petri plan?"
Watch the clip here
(starting at 4:08).
Days
later, conservative media outlet
Right Wisconsin highlighted the issue .
It's
time we get to work on a bipartisan basis to do what's best for
students and taxpayers.
If you
haven't seen it yet , make sure to read
Jordan Weissmann's article in
Slate
about the student
loan reform debate and my legislation to improve it.
He argues
that we should "forget Elizabeth Warren," and rather listen to "a
Republican from Wisconsin [who] actually has the best plan for fixing our
student debt crisis."
We are making progress
each day with the hope that by the end of the year students will have a
better, more commonsense way to repay their student loans that doesn't
hold them back from buying a car, or a house, or getting
married.
IRS
Investigation
After it was revealed last year that the
IRS had improperly targeted conservative groups
for
scrutiny and audits, more has been revealed about the utter dysfunction at
the IRS.
The latest setback--the
disappearance of two years worth of emails from Lois Lerner , the former
director of the IRS unit responsible for the targeting.
At a recent
hearing of the House Ways and Means Committee,
Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan told the acting IRS commissioner
that "nobody
believes him" that the emails just conveniently disappeared and were
unrecoverable.
House Oversight and Government Reform Committee
Chairman Darrell Issa (R-CA) has continued to hold hearings and
recently subpoenaed the White House attorney
in connection
with the disappearing emails.
The IRS watchdog group that
originally uncovered the controversy of the targeted groups last year
recently announced it was launching a non-partisan investigation into the
case of the disappearing emails.
The House of Representatives
will continue its oversight role into the matter until it is
resolved.
House Passes Defense Funding
Bill
On June 20, the House passed
legislation providing funding for the Department of Defense for fiscal
year 2015.
Included in the bill was
an amendment
I offered
with several of my colleagues to protect American
information from spying and searches by the NSA without a warrant.
This backdoor has been left open and exploited by the NSA for too long,
and I am glad it was included in the final version of the legislation
that passed the House by a vote of 340 -
73.
Bring
Home a Flag Flown Over the U.S.
Capitol
The Fourth of July just around the corner, it's
the perfect time of year to bring home a unique version of Old Glory.
Flags that have been flown over the U.S. Capitol in
Washington are for sale through my office!
Flags can be ordered in three different
sizes and can include a personalized certificate.
More information
about pricing and ordering is available

website .
Petri Leads Bipartisan,
Interfaith Discussion on Money in Politics
On June 11,
I led a group discussion
with my
colleague Rep. John Sarbanes (D-MD) and several religious leaders and
government watchdog groups about money in politics.
There is more
money in politics than ever before and we discussed ways to change the
dynamics of campaign financing, including my legislation, the
Citizens Involvement in Campaigns Act , that would bring
back a tax credit for campaign contributions under $50 to candidates
for federal office.

A Much-Earned 'Thank
You'
After more than 35 years working in my Washington, D.C.
office, I took a moment to thank Linda Towse on the floor of the House of
Representatives for her many years of hard work and service to the
Sixth District of Wisconsin.
Linda is the Office Manager and Chief
Caseworker who has served as the backbone of my office.
Before starting in my office in June 1979 (less than
two months after I was first elected) Linda worked for former Senator
Edward Brooke (R-MA).
All told, Linda has served the public
behind the scenes in Congress for 42 years.

Highway 41 Provision Moving
Ahead
In the nearly-10-year quest to designate Highway 41 from
Milwaukee to Green Bay as an Interstate, the House of Representatives passed
a provision as part of the Transportation Appropriations bill on June
10 to grandfather currently operating trucks on the new Interstate.
Federal weight limits are lower than state allowances for certain
trucks, and my legislation would allow trucks that use the road now
to continue using it in the future.
The Senate is working on its own version of this
spending bill.
Read more about it here .
Standalone
legislation I introduced with Rep. Reid Ribble (R-WI)
already passed the House last
July .

Rally for Roads
On
June 11, I spoke at the Rally for Roads, organized by companies and
associations in the contruction industry, about the importance of
American infrastructure and the need to pass a long-term surface
transportation bill.
**Note** June 11 was also
National Seersucker
Day , in which I was happy to participate.
