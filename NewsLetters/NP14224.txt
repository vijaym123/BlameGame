Dear Friends,
Thank you for the opportunity to update you on the
work of the 113th Congress. I trust this finds you and your family
well. Today marks the 150th annivesary of the Gettysburg Address, a
two
minute speech that
has forever changed our nation. I am grateful for Abraham Lincoln and
all he did for our country. Take a moment and read his address
here .
The Week Ahead:
Im happy to announce that this
week, the House Natural Resources Committee will be holding a hearing
discussing my
PARC Act . This bill would ensure that
in the event of a future government shut down, an agreement is in place
to allow states to quickly continue funding and operating national
parks and federal programs that are vital to their economies. There is
no reason that hardworking American families and communities should be
punished due to circumstances over which they have no control. We are
excited to have Utahs Lt. Governor, Spencer Cox, come to Washington
to testify at this hearing on Utahs
behalf.

House Majority Leaders website

most up-to-date information on the legislation the House is voting
on.
Last Week:
To
alleviate some of the negative impacts of the botched Obamacare rollout,
including increased premiums and cancelled health insurance plans, the
House passed the
Keep Your Health Plan Act of
2013 . This bill allows health insurances companies to continue offering
cancelled health plans through 2014.
If the implementation of Obamacare has impacted you or your
family, please share your story with me by filling out
this survey on my website . Its important for me to share your
stories with my colleagues here in Washington. I remain committed to
market healthcare solutions that get the government out of the way,
allowing the economy to grow and Americans to make their own choices about
their healthcare.
I also had the chance
to question the EPA Administrator, Gina McCarthy, to advocate for clean
air solutions that work for Utah. Watch the clip of me questioning
Ms. McCarthy below.
