Dear Friend,
Thank you very much for signing up for our eNewsletter. I appreciate
the opportunity to serve as your Representative. I wanted to give you
this update on our activities in the Second District and Washington,
D.C.
The Oklahoma Farm Bureau visited the Capitol this week and we talked
about what role agriculture plays in Washington, D.C.
House Budget
On Thursday the House of Representatives passed H. Con. Res. 96, the
budget for the United States Government, by a vote of 219-205. Our
country is in need of leadership, specifically the type of leadership
that puts country first and politics second.
The House Budget Committee worked diligently to construct a budget that
balances in 10 years, cuts spending by over $5 trillion, and increases
funding for the military. While there is still work to be done, today
the full House took a step in the right direction. It will take time to
change the economic condition we find ourselves in and turn this ship
around, but today we voted to get our country headed down the right
path.
Click the photo below to hear my remarks on passage of the House Budget.
It's easy to say the American people deserve a better way of life, but
without action those words are hollow. In voting for this budget, I
stood alongside my colleagues as we went beyond rhetoric and produced
responsible solutions. Unlike this Administration and Senate
leadership, today we put country first.

Always good to have Northeastern State University President Dr. Steve
Turner and Jerry Cook visit the Washington, D.C. office.
Great to have the Fort Smith Chamber of Commerce visit Washington, D.C.
Business Tax
The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in Oklahoma and it
resonates from generation to generation. Parents pass on businesses to
their children, instilling strong work ethics and teaching life-long
lessons. There are varying types of businesses, and specifically within
my family, that ranges from plumbing to farming. But regardless of the
shape a business takes, the heart of the business owner is the same. It
is one of strength and determination.
You have heard me talk countless times about the overreach of the
federal government and the weight it causes on the business community.
During the month of April, all Americans are reminded of just how
burdensome their government can be, especially when it comes to
taxation. Long before April 15 arrives there is a group of Americans
that has already been focused on the tax system and that is our small
businesses-the backbone of our economy.
While individuals prepare their taxes once a year, business owners have
a different story to tell. By the time July arrives, my companies have
prepared taxes four times. With hours spent on tax preparation and
regulation compliance, small businesses are missing prime opportunities
to focus their energy on business expansion and job creation.
Click on the photo below to hear my remarks on the House floor this
week about the reality of taxation on small business.
Over the past year, I have heard a recurring message from business
owners across this country: taxes and overregulation are killing our
businesses. And it's unfortunate that this Administration refuses to
listen to business owners across America. The success of small business
sets the tone for our nation's economy and their stories cannot
continue to fall on deaf ears.

Several students from the Oklahoma Agricultural Leadership Program
stopped by the Washington, D.C. office this week.
Chief George Tiger and members of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation were in
Washington, D.C. this week. I am proud to be one of two Native
Americans in Congress and be a voice for Indian Country.

Business
Tax
The
entrepreneurial
spirit
is
alive
and
well
in
Oklahoma
and
it
resonates
from
generation
to
generation. Parents
pass
on
businesses
to
their
children,
instilling
strong
work
ethics
and
teaching
life-long
lessons.
There
are
varying
types
of
businesses,
and
specifically
within
my
family,
that
ranges
from
plumbing
to
farming.
But
regardless
of
the
shape
a
business
takes,
the
heart
of
the
business
owner
is
the
same.
It
is
one
of
strength
and
determination.
You
have
heard
me
talk
countless
times
about
the
overreach
of
the
federal
government
and
the
weight
it
causes
on
the
business
community.
During
the
month
of
April,
all
Americans
are
reminded
of
just
how
burdensome
their
government
can
be,
especially
when
it
comes
to
taxation.
Long
before
April
15
arrives
there
is
a
group
of
Americans
that
has
already
been
focused
on
the
tax
system
and
that
is
our
small
businesses&#8212;the
backbone
of
our
economy.
While
individuals
prepare
their
taxes
once
a
year,
business
owners
have
a
different
story
to
tell.
By
the
time
July
arrives,
my
companies
have
prepared
taxes
four
times.
With
hours
spent
on
tax
preparation
and
regulation
compliance,
small
businesses
are
missing
prime
opportunities
to
focus
their
energy
on
business
expansion
and
job
creation.
Click
on
the
photo
below
to
hear
my
remarks
on
the
House
floor
this
week
about
the
reality
of
taxation
on
small
business.
Over
the
past
year,
I
have
heard
a
recurring
message
from
business
owners
across
this
country:
taxes
and
overregulation
are
killing
our
businesses.
And
it&#8217;s
unfortunate
that
this
Administration
refuses
to
listen
to
business
owners
across
America.
The
success
of
small
business
sets
the
tone
for
our
nation's
economy
and
their
stories
cannot
continue
to
fall
on
deaf
ears.
