Dear Friend,
This Memorial Day, we honor the memory of the valiant men and women who
sacrificed their lives in order to serve and protect our nation. They
are part of what makes this country great, and we owe them and their
families our gratitude and respect. We also honor our courageous men
and women who today continue to serve, and who are making extreme
personal sacrifices to keep our nation out of harm's way.
Hoosiers have always answered the call of duty. Whether in Afghanistan
or Iraq, the Persian Gulf, Vietnam, Korea, in the Pacific, Europe or
North Africa
our state has sent its sons and daughters, and they have
proudly represented our country. Many returned home to their families,
and many too, gave their last full measure for the freedoms we enjoy
each day.
For those who have made the ultimate sacrifice, today is an opportunity
for us to pay tribute. We also remember that for every absent soldier,
sailor, airman and Marine, there are mothers and fathers, spouses and
children, friends and colleagues who love them, miss them and keep
alive their memory.
While there will never be adequate means to thank our veteran members
of the military for their bravery, or for their sacrifice, I will
always support legislation that provides for our troops to accomplish
their mission and to return home safely.
Rep. Carson talks with a veteran outside the Indiana War Memorial.
I thank our men and women in uniform this Memorial Day, and throughout
the year for protecting the liberties we cherish as a nation.
If you know of any veterans who may need assistance, please encourage
them to visit the Veterans Resources page on my website
or to contact any of my offices
. My staff and I are honored to serve those
who served our country.
Your Friend,
Andr
INSIDE SCOOP:
My office is committed to providing the highest level of constituent
service to the people of Indianapolis. Recently, my office was able to
help Indianapolis resident, Robert get the money he was owed by the IRS.
Robert came to my office seeking assistance with getting an update on
an appeal he and his wife had filed with IRS after being audited for
their 2010 tax returns. After working diligently with IRS for several
months, Robert had not had a resolution on the appeal. With the
assistance of our office, Robert and his wife were able to receive
their refund this month in the amount of $1,260.
CONGRATULATIONS!
