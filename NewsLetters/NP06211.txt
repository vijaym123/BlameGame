Rep. Bob Goodlatte
Celebrating The Constitution
Watch Congressman Goodlatte's Constitution Day Message
Two hundred twenty-seven years ago on this day, September 17, 1787, the Founders of our country signed the United States
Constitution that laid the foundation for our freedoms today.
Thanks to
the 39 delegates who stood up for freedom and democracy, this document has stood the test of time, and continues to safeguard America by providing the
necessary checks and balances for our country hundreds of years later.
This year on Constitution Day, we are concerned whether the President is adhering to his constitutional duty of &quot;faithfully executing the
laws&quot; in light of laws he has circumvented or refused to enforce. The Constitution is very clear: it is Congress&rsquo; job to write our laws and
it is the President&rsquo;s duty to enforce them.
As an elected
representative in Congress, I have taken a solemn oath to uphold and defend the Constitution. Also, as Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee that
has jurisdiction over issues pertaining to the U.S. Constitution, I have held hearings on this issue and cosponsored a bill that the House passed to
stop the President&rsquo;s power grab and to restore the balance to the separation of powers enshrined in our Constitution.
As we reflect with reverence on the oldest written constitution still in use today, let&rsquo;s also not forget the dangers of an unchecked
executive branch.
May we all
remember the lives that have been lost in defense of our Constitution and freedoms as Americans. And may God continue to bless this great
nation.
