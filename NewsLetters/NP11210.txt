The Hill Report
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of March 17 - 21, 2014
This week, I enjoyed spending time with constituents and providing them
with an update on House Republicans' work to fight against President
Obama's agenda that is harming North Texas families and businesses. I
had several meetings throughout the District Work Week, a few of which
I have highlighted below.
Trinity Commons Foundation
On Tuesday I joined several community leaders
at the Trinity Commons
Foundation Luncheon to honor Brigadier General Thomas Kula of the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers for his leadership with the Trinity River
project. It was great to congratulate Brigadier General Kula, as well
as other individuals, who have been instrumental to the success of the
foundation and who are committed to fulfilling the vision of the
Trinity River Corridor Project.

Trust, and Brigadier General Thomas Kula of the U.S Army Corps of
Engineers
Rees-Jones Center for Foster Care Excellence
On Wednesday I had the opportunity to tour the Rees-Jones Center for
Foster Care Excellence at the Children's Medical Center in Dallas. I
enjoyed learning about the center's educational programs that focus on
improving the well-being of foster children and their families. As you
may know, Children's is one of the largest pediatric health care
providers in the nation and has provided cared for the children of
North Texas since 1948.

Chulik, and Matt Moore
Wylie Rotary Club & CARGO Meeting
On Thursday I enjoyed spending time in Wylie to meet with constituents
and hear their thoughts on the important issues facing our nation and
community. Earlier in the day I attended the Wylie Rotary Club meeting
where I had the opportunity to give a legislative update and answer
questions.

Later in the day I joined members of the Citizens Association for
Responsible Gun Ownership (CARGO) in Wylie to discuss our Second
Amendment rights. As a lifetime member of the National Rifle
Association, I'm a strong supporter of the constitutional right to keep
and bear arms and am fully committed to protecting this important
constitutional guarantee.

Sachse Rod Shop, Inc
I also had the opportunity on Thursday to visit the Sachse Rod Shop.
During my visit, we discussed how government intrusion limits the
ability for small businesses to succeed. I shared with them the recent
work of House Republicans to rein in the Administration's executive
overreach that makes it more difficult for our small businesses to grow
and hire more workers.

Meeting with Dallas Builders Association
On Friday I spoke to members of the Dallas Builders Association. The
primary topic of our discussion was on the importance of getting
Washington out of the way so that our economy can thrive. I shared with
them my thoughts on the Texas model of low taxes and smart regulations,
which has helped Texas lead our nation in job creation.
