Dear Neighbor,
My bipartisan
Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act
(RAMI) unanimously
passed
the House Committee on Science, clearing the final hurdle before a vote in the full House of Representatives. Our goal with this bill has always been to revitalize American
manufacturing, which plays a key role in adding jobs and revitalizing
our country's economy.
We introduced the bipartisan bill last August as a way to re-establish the United States as the global leader in manufacturing. It's time for an American manufacturing renaissance, and we're
committed
to making manufacturing a U.S. power again. It's time for this jobs bill.
END TRAFFICKING
I was proud to
cosponsor
the bipartisan, bicameral
Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act
that prevents child sex trafficking and gives children in foster care opportunities to live more normal lives. It's about doing all that we can to protect our kids from exploitation, give kids in foster care more opportunities to participate in more activities, and increase the likelihood that they are placed in caring, permanent homes.
GREAT NEWS FOR VILLAGE OF WESTFIELD
Congratulations to the Village of Westfield for receiving funds for much needed upgrades to the Chautauqua County village's waste-water treatment facility. The federal grant for infrastructure improvements is critical to the public safety and health of the village. What's more, the project will create more than 140 jobs in the area, and take care of Chautauqua's vital grape industry.

WHAT'S NEXT?
There are much-needed reforms that veterans and their families are counting on us to deliver so that they get the care they deserve &ndash; the best care possible. This week, the House and Senate will act on a bill to empower veterans with more flexibility to health care close to home and restore desperately-needed accountability to the VA. Our veterans have defended us and now it's our turn to care for them in the best ways possible. Visit our
website
to read more about what we&rsquo;re doing to stand with our veterans.
