Dear
David,
Unless
Democrats and Republicans in Congress can come to a bipartisan compromise
soon, doctors across our country will see a 24 percent pay cut from
Medicare on April 1st.
Such a massive pay cut threatens to disrupt
our healthcare system and may cause doctors to stop accepting
new Medicare patients.
Thats why it is so disappointing that
the Majority in the House of Representatives chose to put
partisanship before problem solving this morning. Instead of passing a bipartisan
bill to strengthen Medicare - a bill that was negotiated in good
faith over many months - Republicans rewrote the legislation and tried for
the 51 st
time to repeal the Affordable Care Act and deny
healthcare to millions of Americans.
As the Ranking Member
of the Rules Committee, I led an effort earlier this week to stop
these partisan games. Alongside my Democratic colleagues, we fought to
receive a vote on a bipartisan bill to strengthen Medicare
a bill
that had been unanimously supported by Democrats and Republicans in the
House Energy and Commerce Committee. Unfortunately, the Republicans
in the House Rules Committee voted against me and moved forward with
their partisan agenda.
Watch highlights
from the Rules Committee debate here
For more than a
decade, doctors have faced the prospect of dangerous cuts to Medicare
payments. It is shameful that when given the chance to pass a bipartisan
solution, some Members of Congress chose to play politics at the
expense of our doctors and Medicare patients.
Over the next few
weeks I will continue the fight in Congress to pass our bipartisan
solution to strengthen Medicare. Doctors and patients deserve nothing
less.
Sincerely,
Tell A Friend
