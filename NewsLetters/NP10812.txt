Dear Friend,
Congress has to be more
responsible when it comes to spending taxpayer dollars. Thats why this week
I introduced a bipartisan bill with Senator Tom Coburn (R-OK) that
would save taxpayers $1 billion over ten years
by
simply capping federal crop insurance premiums
for a select group of
farm businesses. The fact is, a small number of very large farms
disproportionately benefit from crop insurance premiums - with some farm
businesses receiving up to $1 million in premium support each year - and
that needs to stop. Taxpayers shouldnt be footing the bill for these
subsidies.
Capping insurance subsidies at $70,000 is the
type of straight-forward, common-sense savings we need to find more of in
Washington. Finding savings wherever we can will help us reign in
wasteful government spending and be better stewards of taxpayer money -
and reforming crop insurance subsidies is a perfect place to
start.
Ive worked with my colleagues on both sides of the isle
to identify areas where we can save taxpayer dollars. Ive proposed
cutting the federal governments vehicle fleet ,
amending outdated sugar subsidies
and eliminating
a duplicative catfish inspection program , and
together, we've identified many smart areas to cut government waste.
And I'll continue working with anyone in Congress that wants to find
common-sense ways to reduce spending on behalf of our
taxpayers.
Sincerely,
Jeanne Shaheen
