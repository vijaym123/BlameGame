Congressional Support for ABLE Act Hits Highest Level
With more than half of the United States Congress now supporting the
Achieving a Better Life Experience Act (ABLE Act - S. 313/H.R. 647),
the fight to establish tax-free savings accounts for individuals with
disabilities took an enormous step forward this week.
Originally written in 2006 and reintroduced in the 113th Congress in
February, the ABLE Act has now earned 311 House co-sponsors, 50 Senate
co-sponsors - its highest level ever. Without the backing of more than
50 local, state, and national disability advocacy groups, including the
National Down Syndrome Society, Autism Speaks, and The Arc, we
certainly wouldn't be where we are.
Individuals with disabilities deserve the same financial planning tools
as other Americans, and we will all keep the pressure on to make that a
reality. The legislation would amend Section 529 of the Internal
Revenue Service Code to 1986 to create tax-free savings accounts for
individuals with disabilities. The result: coverage for qualified
expenses such as education, housing, medical, and transportation. The
legislation would supplement, but not supplant, benefits provided
through private insurance, the Medicaid program, the beneficiary's
employment, and other sources.
Those who live with disabilities and their families have difficulties
that most of us can't even imagine. The ABLE Act provides financial
planning tools that will allow them to better plan for their future.
That's something we can all be proud of.
Through the years, ABLE Act supporters have underscored the importance
of tax-free savings accounts for individuals with disabilities.
Promotions in My Congressional Office
With the departure of my long-time Chief of Staff John Ariale, I've
made a few promotions in the Congressional office. Thanks to John's
leadership, we've got a great team in place to handle the top issues of
the day. I wish him the best and know my staff stands ready to address
all the needs of Florida's Fourth Congressional District.
Erica Striebel, a graduate of The George Washington University and the
U.S. Naval War College, has been promoted from Legislative Director to
Chief of Staff. She will direct all operations for my Capitol Hill and
Jacksonville, Florida offices and will continue to handle the Defense
Appropriations Subcommittee and all military and veterans accounts.
Erica joined my staff in 2002.
Jennifer Debes, a graduate of Colorado State University, has been
promoted from Legislative Assistant to Legislative Director. She will
direct my legislative team and will continue to handle the Financial
Services and General Government Appropriations Committee account as
well as telecommunications, tax policy, budget, agriculture, and
environment issues. Jennifer joined my staff in 2007.
Cate Sadler, a graduate of Duke University, will serve as Legislative
Assistant, handling the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations
Subcommittee account as well as NASA, health care, labor, and education
issues. Originally from Jacksonville, she returns to my office after
studying at the London School of Economics. Cate first joined my office
in 2011 as Staff Assistant.

Congressional
Support
for
ABLE
Act
Hits
Highest
Level
With
more
than
half
of
the
United
States
Congress
now
supporting
the
Achieving
a
Better
Life
Experience
Act
(ABLE
Act
&#8211;
S.
313/H.R.
647),
the
fight
to
establish
tax-free
savings
accounts
for
individuals
with
disabilities
took
an
enormous
step
forward
this
week.
Originally
written
in
2006
and
reintroduced
in
the
113th
Congress
in
February,
the
ABLE
Act
has
now
earned
311
House
co-sponsors,
50
Senate
co-sponsors
&#8211;
its
highest
level
ever.
Without

backing
of
more
than
50
local,
state,
and
national
disability
advocacy
groups,
including
the
National
Down
Syndrome
Society,
Autism
Speaks,
and
The
Arc,
we
certainly
wouldn&#8217;t
be
where
we
are.
Individuals
with

deserve
the
same
financial

tools
as
other
Americans,
and
we
will
all
keep
the

The
result:
coverage
for

The

supplement,
but
not
supplant,

the

the

Those
