Dear Friends,
We ask a lot of
our military men and women. When they volunteer and take an oath to
serve our nation in uniform, they understand it will likely mean
extended periods away from their loved ones, often in far-off lands and often
at great risk to their lives.
What they shouldnt
expect, however,
is that while theyre courageously
serving in harms way they might receive a pink slip
informing them
that their services will no longer be needed and that they wont have
a job when they return home. Tragically, thats exactly what happened
to approximately 1,100 Army captains this month.
It was
clear to me early on that preserving the readiness and war-fighting
capabilities of our military would not be a priority of President Obama.
This reality, coupled with the devastating impacts of defense
sequestration, is wreaking havoc on the military and forcing our men and women
in uniform to shoulder the burden.
In 2011, I warned that
defense sequestration would lead to the hollowing out of our military
and civilian furloughs, and program reductions would soon turn into our
active-duty military receiving pink slips and the canceling of
critical weapons programs. We are seeing this happen now with the forced
separation of talented military leaders and with soldiers losing their
jobs while serving on the front lines.
If defense
sequestration continues, it is only going to get worse. Our Army could reach a
level of 420,000 soldiers -- a size not seen since before World War II.
Put simply, more soldiers will receive pink slips in the months and
years ahead. Its devastating for morale and even worse for our national
security and Congress must do something about it.
The
Army has told me that they are committed to helping those who face
forced retirement or discharge. Officers with less than 18 years of
active service will be given 9 months to transition and are eligible for
full separation pay as well as transition assistance counseling.
However, many of us believe that more can and should be done.
As
Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I supported
numerous provisions in this years National Defense Authorization Act
that will assist our soldiers being forced out of the military with
access to higher education opportunities, ongoing transition counseling,
and tools for job placement. We urgently need to bring up the NDAA
before the full Senate so that we can debate these issues, go to conference
with the House, and pass this vital bill for our military for the
53 rd
consecutive year. The men and women serving on the front
lines and those who received notice of their forced separation
continue to do their jobs and, rightfully, expect us in the Senate to do
ours.
My heart goes out to these men and women risking their
lives and making great sacrifices, yet are now being told they are being
separated from the Army and will have no job when they return home to
their families. By bringing up the NDAA as soon as possible, we will
have an opportunity to provide the support these brave Americans and
their families need during this difficult time.
These
soldiers made a commitment to support the defense of the United States and
we have a commitment to support them while in uniform and as they
transition to civilian life. I urge my colleagues to push for the NDAA to
come to the Senate floor so that we can fulfill this solemn
commitment.
Thank you for taking an interest in what I am doing to
best represent you in Washington.
Sincerely,
Jim
Inhofe
Sen. Inhofe
will appear on MiddleGround on Oklahoma City's KOKH Fox 25 at 8:30AM CST
Sunday morning to talk about our men and women in uniform receiving
pink slips.
