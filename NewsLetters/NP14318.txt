OUR DISTRICT
November 15, 2013
Dear Friend,
I wanted to share with you some of the things I've been working here in
Rhode Island and some events I'll be hosting in the First District.
Honoring Our Veterans
On Veterans Day, Rhode Island paid tribute to all the brave men and
women who have worn the uniform of the United States Armed Forces. I
was able to spend time with veterans around the state to salute their
service and sacrifice with the Veterans Council in Bristol and hear
stories from female soldiers at a luncheon in their honor hosted by
Operation Stand Down Rhode Island.
All of use owe an enormous debt of gratitude to those who have served
our nation both at home and across the globe, and this is especially
true for the heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice on the field
of battle in order to protect our the freedoms we hold dear. I will
continue working to support Rhode Island's veterans and make sure that
our country provides them with the honors and services they so richly
deserve.
Women's Economic Priorities
Last week, I welcomed my colleague Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro to the
Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce for a discussion about women's
economic issues. Along with State Senator Gayle Goldin and dozens of
Rhode Islanders, we outlined ways to promote women's economic concerns
both locally and nationally, including pay equity, paid family leave,
and personal medical leave. I was delighted to speak to so many of my
constituents alongside these strong advocates for women's issues in
Rhode Island and across the country, and will continue the fight for
all the things that women deserve to achieve economic security and
equality in the workplace.
Rhode Island Nurses
My grandmother worked as a nurse at St. Joseph's Hospital, and I
understand how important it is that we recognize and support men and
women who enter the nursing profession. Earlier this week, I spoke on
the House floor to honor the Rhode Island Nurses Institute Middle
College Charter High School, the first American charter school
dedicated to preparing students for the nursing profession.
This innovative program gives high school students the chance to
graduate with nursing credentials and a jump start in the competitive
global economy of our day. The RINI-MC is just one of the ways we can
train our workforce to help get our economy back on track and I
congratulate CEO Pamela L. McCue, their faculty, staff and students on
their great achievements. Click here

Neighborhood Conversations
Next week, I will be hosting two Neighborhood Conversations with
constituents in East Providence and Pawtucket. These events will be
held at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, November 25, and Tuesday, November 26.
I
hope you will join me to ask questions, voice opinions, and express any
concerns you have regarding issues like Rhode Island jobs and
manufacturing, protecting the guarantee of Medicare and Social
Security, honoring our responsibilities to veterans, keeping student
loan rates low, and achieving comprehensive immigration reform.
On Monday, November 25, my Neighborhood Conversation will be held at
the East Providence Senior Center on 610 Waterman Avenue. My
Neighborhood Conversation on Tuesday, November 26 will be held at the
Pawtucket Public Library on 13 Summer Street. Click here

As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns,

November

2013
Dear
Friend,
I
wanted
to
share
with
you
some
of
the
things
I&#8217;ve
been
working
here
in
Rhode
Island
and
some
events
I&#8217;ll
be
hosting
in
the
First
District.
Honoring
Our
Veterans
On
Veterans
Day,
Rhode
Island
paid
tribute
to
all
the
brave
men
and
women
who
have
worn
the
uniform
of
the
United
States
Armed
Forces.
I
was
able
to
spend
time
with
veterans
around
the
state
to
salute
their
service
and
sacrifice
with
the
Veterans
Council
in
Bristol
and
hear
stories
from
female
soldiers
at
a
luncheon
in
their
honor
hosted
by
Operation
Stand
Down
Rhode
Island.
All
of
use
owe
an
enormous
debt
of
gratitude
to
those
who
have
served
our
nation
both
at
home
and
across
the
globe,
and
this
is
especially
true
for
the
heroes
who
have made
the
ultimate
sacrifice on
the
field
of
battle
in
order
to
protect
our
the
freedoms
we
hold
dear.
I
will
continue
working
to
support
Rhode
Island&#8217;s
veterans
and
make
sure
that
our
country
provides
them
with
the
honors
and
services
they
so
richly
deserve.
Women's
Economic
Priorities
Last
week,
I
welcomed
my
colleague
Congresswoman
Rosa
DeLauro
to
the
Greater
Providence
Chamber
of
Commerce
for
a
discussion
about
women&#8217;s
economic
issues.
Along
with
State
Senator
Gayle
Goldin
and
dozens
of
Rhode
Islanders,
we
outlined
ways
to
promote
women&#8217;s
economic
concerns
both
locally
and
nationally,
including
pay
equity,
paid
family
leave,
and
personal
medical
leave.
I
was
delighted
to
speak
to
so
many
of
my
constituents
alongside
these
strong
advocates
for
women&#8217;s
issues
in
Rhode
Island
and
across
the
country,
and
will
continue
the
fight
for
all
the
things
that
women
deserve
to
achieve
economic
security
and
equality
in
the
workplace.
Rhode
Island
Nurses
My
grandmother
worked
as
a
nurse
at
St.
Joseph&#8217;s
Hospital,
and
I
understand
how
important
it
is
that
we
recognize
and
support
men
and
women
who
enter
the
nursing
profession.
Earlier
this
week,
I
spoke
on
the
House
floor
to
honor
the
Rhode
Island
Nurses
Institute
Middle
College
Charter
High
School,
the
first
American
charter
school
dedicated
to
preparing
students
for
the
nursing
profession.
This
innovative
program
gives
high
school
students
the
chance
to
graduate
with
nursing
credentials
and
a
jump
start
in
the
competitive
global
economy
of
our
day.
The
RINI-MC
is
just
one
of
the
ways
we
can
train
our
workforce
to
help
get
our
economy
back
on
track
and
I
congratulate
CEO
Pamela
L.
McCue,
their
faculty,
staff
and
students
on
their
great
achievements.
