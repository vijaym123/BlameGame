Bureaucrats and School Lunches
It
has become clearer than ever that Washington is out of touch with
America. Too many bureaucrats and politicians dont understand the effects
of the rules and laws they create.
Take the National
School Lunch Program for example.
For the 2012-2013 school year,
the Obama Administration began implementing new nutritional standards
for school lunches.
These rules coming down from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) are making it harder for school districts to
do their job, leading to increased costs and, in some cases, hungry
children.
In fact, the USDA admits that complying with
these rules will add $3.2 billion to school meal costs over five years.
The end result, according to the School Nutrition Association, is
that one million fewer kids already participate in the program after
just one year.
There have been a number of attempts to
address these overly burdensome regulations.
For instance, the
nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, Congress investigative arm,
made two simple recommendations: permanently remove the weekly meat
and grain maximums for school lunches and give flexibility to comply
with calorie ranges for growing children. Unfortunately, Washington
still isnt listening.
That is why I recently helped
introduce the
School Nutrition Fairness Act
(H.R. 3686). This bill
forces the White House and USDA to comply with the same nutrition
standards it is forcing on kids in school. Any meal
from those served in
the USDA cafeterias to State Dinners at the White House
must meet
their own nutrition standards.
I believe the most effective
way to deliver the message to politicians and unelected bureaucrats
about their harmful actions is to have them experience firsthand the
regulations they approve.
Maybe then theyll consider some
commonsense solutions.
