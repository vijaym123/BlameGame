Congress is facing a critical deadline tomorrow regarding President Obamas executive amnesty and I want to hear from you.
Forty days ago the House passed a bill to fully fund the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) while including provisions to make sure he could not use this money to implement his executive amnesty plan. However, the Senate minority has prevented this bill from even coming before the Senate for a vote. Also, a federal court in Texas ruled that the Administration could not proceed with executive amnesty, but the Administration has applied for an expedited appeal.
I believe it is important we stop executive amnesty and prohibit any government funds from being used to carry it out.
Please take a brief moment to let me know where you stand on this vote by clicking
