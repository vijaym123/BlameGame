Dear Friend,
Last month we celebrated Independence
Day, an opportunity to reflect on all of
the freedoms we enjoy in this country,
thanks to our Founding Fathers and all of
those who have fought so valiantly to
defend those freedoms throughout history. I
could not help but be reminded of one of
our Founding Fathers
George
Washington
and the act that he
should perhaps be most remembered for:
respecting the limits of our Executive
Branch.
President Washington was brilliant. He
led the Revolutionary Army, served as our
first President, and legend has it that the
American people respected him so much they
wanted him to be king. However, President
Washington understood the importance of a
regular and peaceful transfer of power
something that we can still see
apparent in our political process
today.
I believe that our federal government
works best when the White House and
Congress work together to solve our
countrys problems, but time and time
again, the Obama administration has refused
to let Congress do its job. Though many
presidents, both Republicans and Democrats,
have issued executive orders or made recess
appointments, President Obama seeks to
change policy in a major way through his
executive orders.
In June, President Barack
Obama once again announced his intention to
bypass Congress and legislate through
executive order
this time referring
to immigration. Additionally, last month
marked the one year anniversary of the
White Houses delay of the employer
mandate as well as its abandonment of the
eligibility verification process for
exchanges, opting instead for an
honor system. These are just
two of the White Houses many
unilateral changes to the Presidents
health care law. President Obama has also
used executive action to expand the
regulatory scope of the EPA
costing
Ohioans jobs at a time when too many are
looking for work.
If the President cannot work with
Congress to advance bipartisan legislation,
he must be prepared to face the judicial
challenges to his overreach. Last month,
the House of Representatives passed
legislation to initiate a lawsuit against
the president to challenge the Obama
administration's unconstitutional overreach
of its executive authority. I supported it
because I believe that our Founders created
a divided system of government with checks
and balances, which is critical to a nation
without centralized power in one branch of
government.
I came to Congress to legislate and
offer solutions that will get our economy
moving again and spur growth in
Ohios 16
th
District. Its far past
time that the President starts working with
Congress to get things done. He owes it to
the American people.
