Thanksgiving
Thanksgiving is a time to give thanks for the harvest and express gratitude for the blessings in your life. Its about spending time with your family and loved ones. Its about giving back and giving thanks.
As Americans, we have much to be thankful for. Each day we wake up in the greatest country in the world
truly the land of opportunity. Were blessed with a peaceful governing process where citizens are given the privilege of electing their leaders to serve them. This Thanksgiving, I am thankful for the opportunity to serve the First District and represent you in Congress.
None of these freedoms would be possible without our men and women in the Armed Forces. Every Thanksgiving, I say a special prayer for the brave soldiers who are serving our nation overseas. They cannot be with their families and friends here in the States, but they should be in our thoughts and prayers.
I had the opportunity to return to South Korea and visit the DMZ, where I served. When I left, South Korea was an economically-distressed, war-torn country. In returning, I saw a thriving economy that was made possible because America made a stand against communism. Even better, as we drove to the DMZ, I saw crosses that marked the hillsides and came to learn that there is a thriving Christian community in South Korea made possible by freedom for their people.
Veterans of my generation often ask themselves, Was our sacrifice worth it? What I saw in South Korea answered that question for me, and speaks to Americas greatness and goodness. Regardless of our political differences, we can all give thanks for our great nation and be proud to be Americans.
