Congressional Report -- Week of March 17-21: City of San
Antonio Receives $1 Million Grant from FEMA
Hello Friend,
It was a great week on the road traveling throughout 23rd District of
Texas. I met with business leaders at the San Antonio Business Forum.
We spoke about job creation and the needs of businesses in Texas. While
visiting Vineyard Ranch Elementary School in the Stone Oak area on
Wednesday, I congratulated students and parents on their success.
Students participated in the Alamo-FIRST Robotics Competition, the
largest of its kind for K-12 in the world. Later that day, I stopped by
the South Texas Regional Training Center in Hondo where I spoke with
Mayor James W. Danner. On Thursday, I attended the Del Rio Chamber of
Commerce Banquet and spoke with small business owners and constituents
there.
We ended the week in Eagle Pass at the Abrazo Ceremony, a friendly
embrace that brings together the sister communities of Eagle Pass,
Texas, and Piedras Negras, Coahuila, Mexico. It was a busy week, but I
enjoyed every minute of it.
Here's a wrap up of the week.

$1 Million for City of San Antonio
The City of San Antonio has received $1,000,000 from the Department of
Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency. With the other
members of the San Antonio Delegation, I worked to secure this federal
investment that will help provide our law enforcement and police
officers with the latest technology and equipment to protect our city
and its people. The funds will be used through the Urban Areas Security
Initiative (UASI).
The funds will help with planning, organization, equipment, training,
and exercise needs of high-threat, high-density urban areas, and
assists them in building an enhanced and sustainable capacity to
prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from acts
of terrorism. To read more about these and other funding opportunities
for 23rd District of Texas, click here

House Armed Services Hearing on Afghanistan
A few days ago, I participated in a House Armed Services Committee
hearing on the latest in Afghanistan. During the hearing, I asked
General Joseph Dunford, commander of the International Security
Assistance Force and United States Forces-Afghanistan, about our exit
strategy in Afghanistan and about taking care of our veterans. To watch
my questions and his answers, click here

Schools Designated Early College High Schools
Eight schools in 23rd District of Texas were recently designated as
Early College High Schools (ECHS) by the Texas Education Agency. Across
Texas, 44 Early College High Schools were designated for the 2014-2015
school year. Congratulations - these schools are preparing our young
adults across southwest Texas to be college-ready with the goal of
helping them graduate from high school and pursue higher education.
These eight schools are leading by example. I am committed to
supporting career and educational goals of all students. To read the

Texans Invade D.C. During Spring Break
