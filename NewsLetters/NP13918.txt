Healthcare
Website Poses Major Cybersecurity
Risks
Dear Friend,
This weekend, the Obama Administration
announced that the federal health insurance
exchange website is now accessible
for the vast majority of users after
two months of glitches, errors, and bugs.
While the website may be more accessible,
the Administration has not addressed
another major issue presented by the launch
of this website
the security of
individuals personal, private data
entered into the site.
Cybersecurity poses a significant and
growing threat to individual privacy, yet
the Obama Administration has been so
focused on getting the health insurance
website to function at a basic level that
it has not taken sufficient action to
ensure that users personal and
medical information will be protected,
which is unacceptable. Information such as
an individuals Social Security
Number, home address, and email entered
into the website are not sufficiently
protected from hackers and cyber-criminals,
exposing users to identity theft.
The House of Representatives has held
oversight hearings to look into this
important issue, and the findings are
disturbing. At a recent Energy and Commerce
Oversight hearing, we learned that Henry
Chao, a top IT official responsible for
management of healthcare.gov, never saw a
key analysis of foreseeable issues with the
website. A presentation was given to top
administration officials in March and April
of this year, and yet Mr. Chao, a point
person for the site, admitted at this
hearing that he never reviewed this
assessment and the risks it identified.
At a Science, Space, and Technology
Committee hearing, online security experts
testified that significant flaws within
healthcare.gov are putting Americans'
security at serious risk. They stated that
while rushing to achieve the public launch
of the site, the Administration did not
take the precautions necessary to protect
the information of users, and therefore,
they sacrificed the security of Americans'
private information. All but one of the
witnesses at this hearing testified that
they would take the website offline as soon
as possible to address the security risks
involved with the site. All of the
witnesses said that they would advise
Americans against using the site given
these security vulnerabilities. David
Kennedy, who is a "white hat hacker,"
testified that the site is currently being
hacked to reveal Americans' personal
information, and the site is definitely not
safe for use.
The Administration recently announced
that a full Security Control Assessment of
the site is set to begin in December, but
that is too late. Healthcare.gov made its
public debut over 11 weeks ago -- why is
the Administration only now launching a
security assessment?
These security problems must be
addressed immediately to prevent the
exploitation of individuals most
private information as they attempt to use
this website. At a time when hundreds of
thousands of Americans are learning that
they can no longer keep their current
insurance plan and must go onto the health
exchange to obtain a new policy, we cannot
allow their personal information to remain
at risk. I will continue to work with my
colleagues to conduct oversight of those
officials responsible for administering the
site to ensure that individual privacy is
protected.
