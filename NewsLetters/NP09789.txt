Dear Friend,
On April 29th I spoke
on the
House floor to unveil the inaugural poster of the "Faces of the
Unemployed" project.
As you know, I recently launched the "Faces of
the Unemployed" project to help put a human face on the unemployment
crisis and to urge Speaker John Boehner to allow a vote to renew
unemployment benefits for over 2.5 million Americans.
This poster and a second poster I unveiled last week will stand outside
my Washington, D.C. office until the House enacts legislation to renew
this critical lifeline.
The poster will include the first name and
hometown of people who share their stories.
The response to the "Faces of the Unemployed" has been overwhelming
from Rhode Islanders who have lost their emergency unemployment
benefits.
And, I thank all the participants who have helped make this
project such a success.
If you, a friend or family member is unemployed and comfortable sharing
your story and photograph, please visit my website at
http://cicilline.house.gov/tell-your-story
and submit your information.
You can also
contact Alex Macfarlane in my district office at
Alex.Macfarlane@mail.house.gov
.
In the end, this debate is about more than dollars and cents.
It is
about the families who continue to lose unemployment benefits with each
passing day that the House fails to act. It is about the more than
200,000 veterans and more than 1 million children who have been
affected by the loss of these benefits.
It is time for the House
Majority to hear and see those stories every time they walk down the
halls and to the House Floor.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact my office at
(401) 729-5600.
Please know that I will continue to fight to restore
these critical benefits to our nation's long-term unemployed.
My best always,
David Cicilline

Dear
Friend,
On
April
29 th
I
spoke
on
the
House
floor
to
unveil
the
inaugural
poster
of
the
&#8220;Faces
of
the
Unemployed&#8221;
project.
As
you
know,
I
recently
launched
the
&#8220; Faces
of
the
Unemployed &#8221;
project
to
help
put
a
human
face
on
the
unemployment
crisis
and
to
urge
Speaker
John
Boehner
to
allow
a
vote
to
renew
unemployment
benefits
for
over
2.5
million
Americans.
This
poster
and
a
second
poster
I
unveiled
last
week
will
stand
outside
my
Washington,
D.C.
office
until
the
House
enacts
legislation
to
renew
this
critical
lifeline.
The
poster
will
include
the
first
name
and
hometown
of
people
who
share
their
stories.
The
response
to
the
&#8220; Faces
of
the
Unemployed &#8221;
has
been
overwhelming
from
Rhode
Islanders
who
have
lost
their
emergency
unemployment
benefits.
And,
I
thank
all
the
participants
who
have
helped
make
this
project
such
a
success.

In
the

this
debate
is
about
more
than
dollars
and
cents.
It
is
about
the
families
who
continue
to
lose

with
each

that
the

I
will
continue

benefits

our
nation&#8217;s
long-term
unemployed.
