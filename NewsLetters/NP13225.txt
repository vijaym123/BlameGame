Dear Friend,
I'd like to
invite you to join me in a Twitter townhall meeting tomorrow afternoon.
I'll be answering your questions live beginning at 12 p.m. PT (3 p.m.
ET).
On Wednesday I will be holding a hearing as Chairman
of the Transportation and Infrastructures Subcommittee on Railroads,
Pipelines and Hazardous Materials on
the challenges
facing Californias High-Speed Rail project , so that's a great
topic to ask me about. Since Californians supported Prop 1A in 2008,
proposed ride times for the California High-Speed Rail Authoritys
(Authority) project have slowed, promised jobs have failed to materialize
and costs have skyrocketed. A November ruling from the California
Superior Court denied the Authoritys request to issue more than $8
billion in California Proposition 1A state bonds to finance construction of
the project. The hearing will examine the project following the
ruling, which prevents the Authority from generating the State funds
necessary to match the $2.55 billion in federal dollars already spent on the
rail system.
I'm also happy to take your questions on
other federal legislation you're interested in.
Please join
me by tweeting

Hope to talk to you
tomorrow!
