Laredo VA Outpatient Clinic Expands Health Care Services for South Texas Vets
On Tuesday I announced new services and a new partnership with Laredo Medical Center to provide in-patient health care services to veterans in South Texas at the Laredo VA Outpatient Clinic.
Last Tuesday I announced the expansion of health care services at the Laredo VA Outpatient Clinic, including in-patient hospital stays for the first time in history thanks to a partnership with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Laredo Medical Center and community physicians through TriWest.
Other expanded services on-site at the clinic include two new primary care doctors, a dental hygienist and dental assistant, an on-board EMS, police, radiology, and laboratory work that will serve veterans throughout Webb, La Salle and Zapata counties. Veterans and their families in these counties will no longer have to spend time and money traveling to San Antonio to get the health services they need.
Bringing these services to Laredo-area veterans has always been a priority of mine and I will continue to work hard in Washington to make sure our veterans get the support and medical care they rightfully deserve.
Read more about these new expanded services

Meeting with Healthcare Coalition in the Valley
On Wednesday, my Southern District Outreach Coordinator Nichole Hernandez met with a healthcare coalition in the Rio Grande Valley to discuss raising public awareness with partnerships and resources.
Topics discussed include outreach on Disaster Crisis Management Events,
Back-to-School Supplies, Food For the Hungry and Health Care Coverage.
Addressing Students at Texas A&amp;M International University
On Feb. 20, I hosted a discussion with business students from Texas A&amp;M International University about scholarship and study opportunities in petroleum engineering and politics. (Pictured above).
Last week, I invited the Ambassador of the Republic of Azerbaijan to the United States, Elin Suleymanov, to speak to the students of Texas A&amp;M International University about opportunities to study in Asia. I also invited Laredo Mayor Pete Saenz and TAMIU President Ray Keck to discuss the development of a new petroleum engineering program at the university.
