Honoring Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Dear Friends,
On Monday, January 20th, we will commemorate the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his legacy of fighting for justice.
Dr. King travelled the country encouraging even those in the deepest despair to persevere in the fight for equal justice, freedom, and the end of racial discrimination. In 1963, he stood in the shadow of the Washington landmark that memorializes President Lincoln and delivered one of history's
most stirring and inspirational speeches in the fight for freedom and self-determination.
The March on Washington represented one of the greatest peaceful demonstrations ever promoting civil justice and economic opportunity.
Monday is an opportunity to give back to your community. The
MLK Day of Service website
has a number of ideas for ways to honor Dr. King through service.
