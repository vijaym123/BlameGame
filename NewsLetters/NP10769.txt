Dear Friend:
On Wednesday, Senate Republicans filibustered equal pay for women.
Women earn on average just 77 cents for every dollar made by a man. This wage gap will cost a woman $443,000 over the course of her career - enough to pay off a mortgage or send three kids to the University of California. To watch my speech on the need to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and close the wage gap, please click

We owe it to women and their families to end pay discrimination.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
