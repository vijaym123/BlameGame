Dear Friend,
Cynthia and I would
like to wish you and your family a Merry Christmas and a happy,
healthy, and prosperous New Year.
We would also like to thank all
of our brave men and women in the military
especially those serving
in harms way and those separated from family.
Please keep them
and their loved ones in your prayers.
As we prepare to
celebrate the birth of our Lord and Savior, we hope the season gives you
an opportunity to slow down and reflect. During Christmas, we celebrate
the Christ-child entering into humanity to be present with us and to
save us. In imitating our Savior, its also a time for us to make
ourselves present to others.
Like so many New Mexicans, we feel
blessed to celebrate with family and friends.
That said, many among
us are struggling this season due to financial distress or the loss of
a loved one.
For others, it may be physical separation from
family members
especially in our military community.
While exchanging gifts is one way to be present to others, there are
other ways that we can share the warmth and hope of Christmas.
Maybe its a visit or phone call to a relative, friend, or to someone
homebound we havent seen recently.
Whether its expressed as a
card, a plate of cookies, or a warm meal, please remember those less
fortunate this year by welcoming them into your family traditions, giving
what you can, or volunteering.
Christmas is a time for
cherishing faith, family, friendship, and the blessings we enjoy in our
great nation.
Thank you for your friendship, prayers, and
support. May God bless you and may God continue to bless
America.
Sincerely,
Steve Pearce
