Paying America's Bills - Restoring Pensions for America's Heroes
Dear Friend,
On the heels of our bipartisan budget agreement, Democrats and
Republicans joined forces last week to pass critically important
legislation to (1) raise the debt ceiling in order to pay our nation's
bills, and (2) restore unjustified and unnecessary cuts to military
pensions that Congressional Research Service estimates would otherwise
have cost an average enlistee $69,000 in benefits over a lifetime.
To be clear, the debt ceiling bill does not authorize any new spending.
It simply fulfills our Constitutional obligation to pay the debts our
nation has incurred - including federal tax refunds and invoices from
scores of small businesses right here in the 8th District and
throughout Minnesota that supply goods and services to the federal
government.
While our federal deficit is still way too high, we are making
progress. The Congressional Budget Office reports that America's fiscal
year 2013 deficit is the lowest since 2008, and government spending is
presently growing at the slowest rate since the Eisenhower
Administration some 60 years ago.
Meanwhile, those cuts to military pensions were wrong from the start.
There are plenty of places to cut more spending - tax breaks for big
corporations that send American jobs overseas, and wars of choice and
nation-building abroad that continue to cost taxpayers hundreds of
billions of dollars we should be investing at home, come immediately to
mind. Hard-earned military pensions should have never gone on the
chopping block. I am thankful this was fixed in time to do no damage.
So all in all, last week was a good week of bipartisan cooperation. We
got some important things done. Happy President's Day.

Coast Guard Funding Bill Heads to House Floor
With fellow Members of Congress in the House Transportation &
Infrastructure Full Committee markup last week (including Minnesota's
1st District Congressman Tim Walz in the background).
As a member of the House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee, I'm
proud to support the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act,
recently passed by committee and coming to the House Floor for a vote
soon. This critical bill will go to fund our Coast Guard Station in
Duluth, including their crucial icebreaking operations in the Great
Lakes that allow ships to carry their cargo safely in and out of Duluth
Harbor and on to markets around the U.S. and the world.
On Valentine's Day, #WhatWomenNeed is Equal Pay for Equal Work
As we celebrated Valentine's Day last Friday, I asked my Facebook
friends
to consider an alternative to gifts of flowers or
chocolates - and give women what they truly deserve: equal pay for
equal work. In 2014, it's outrageous that women still only earn 77
cents for every dollar a man earns, despite more and more families
depending on "Mom" as the sole breadwinner. A whopping two thirds of
minimum wage earners are women - women who typically also pay for
childcare, groceries, and family health care - another great reason to
raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour with the Fair Minimum Wage
Act. Women are truly the driving forces of our families and our
economy; It just goes to show that when women succeed, the nation
succeeds.
American Made, Locally Laid (by LoLa)
With Jason Amundsen at his now nationally famous farm, Locally Laid
Eggs, in Wrenshall
Small sustainable farms and family businesses help anchor Minnesota's
rural economy with thousands of good jobs and unique local products -
including fresh, pasture raised eggs. With that in mind, our Make It In
America tour headed to Wrenshall on Saturday for a visit with Jason and
Lucie Amundsen and their now nationally famous head hen LoLa at Locally
Laid.
LoLa and her colleagues caught the nation's attention by appearing in a
television ad that almost made it to the Super Bowl as a top four
finalist in Intuit's ad contest for small businesses. Hats off to
everyone at Locally Laid - and to their research partners at University
of Minnesota Duluth and the Lake Superior Sustainable Farm Association,
for their hard work and success making it - or I should say, "laying
it" - in America.
Talking Transportation in North Branch
Minnesotans like to travel - safely and efficiently. The Federal
Transportation Authorization Act, which funds maintenance,
improvements, and expansion of our nation's rail systems, airports,
highways, roads, bridges, inland ports, harbors, and other transit
systems is set to expire this year.
So as a member of the House Committee on Transportation &
Infrastructure, I was pleased to join the Minnesota Transportation
Alliance for a roundtable discussion on future transportation funding
on Saturday morning in North Branch. We talked about a host of
transportation-related issues, and I plan to use what I learned to help
make Minnesota a winner in the high stakes contest for funding to
improve an infrastructure badly in need of repair.
Talking Spring Planting with the Minnesota Farm Bureau
It was great to spend some time with Minnesota Farm Bureau President
Kevin Papp on Saturday. He thanked me for supporting and helping draft
the 2014 Farm Bill, and we talked about prospects for a good (and
hopefully early) spring planting with plenty of moisture thanks to all
the snow we've been having.

Works, oversees the Corps' work, and she and her senior staff stopped
by last week to go over the Corps 2014 Work Plan.
Greeting Folks from the NE Minnesota Higher Education District A former
teacher myself, I was delighted to welcome representatives of the
Northeast Minnesota Higher Education District: President Sue Collins,
President-Emeritus Joe Sertich, and Dawn Erlandson, appointed by
Governor Dayton as a Trustee of the MN State Colleges and Universities
System. The NE MN Higher Education District represents five community
colleges in the 8th district - in International Falls, Grand Rapids,
Hibbing, Virginia, Eveleth, and Ely. During our meeting, we reviewed
funding issues relative to education and job training services and
programs in our community college system.

Honoring the VFW's "Patriot's Pen" and "Voice of Democracy"
Essay Contest Winners in Cloquet
>From left to right: Lukas Morgan of Babbitt (2nd Place Voice of

Congratulations to Molly Deatherage of Cook and Quinn Muhich of
Eveleth, winners of the VFW's "Patriot's Pen" and "Voice of Democracy"
national essay contests here in Minnesota's 8th District. I was
delighted to personally hear them read their essays at a special event
Saturday night at the VFW Hall in Cloquet.
Quinn, a middle school student, wrote on the topic, "What Patriotism
Means to Me." His theme was respect for our veterans. Molly, a high
school student, wrote about "Why I'm Optimistic About Our Nation's
Future." She reminded us to never stop believing that politics and
government can make a difference. Lukas, who also wrote about "Why I'm
Optimistic About our Nation's Future," focused on the reasons why we
must never give up on the promise of America. I can tell you what makes
ME optimistic about our nation's future: patriotic and promising young
people like Lukas, Quinn, and Molly!

Dear
Friend,
On
the

of
our
bipartisan

Democrats
and

joined
forces
last
week
to
pass
critically
important
legislation
to
(1)
raise
the
debt

in
order
to

our
nation&#8217;s

and
(2)
restore
unjustified
and
unnecessary
cuts
to

that
Congressional
Research
Service
estimates
would
otherwise
have
cost
an
average
enlistee
$69,000
in
benefits
over
a
lifetime.
To
be
clear,
the
debt
ceiling
bill
does
not
authorize
any
new
spending .
It
simply
fulfills
our
Constitutional
obligation
to
pay
the

that
supply

to
the
federal

While
our
federal
deficit
is
still
way
too
high,
we
are
making
progress.
The
Congressional
Budget
Office
reports
that
America&#8217;s
fiscal

2013
deficit
is
the
lowest
since
2008 ,
and
government
spending
is
presently
growing
at
the
slowest
rate
since
the
Eisenhower
Administration
some
60
years
ago.
Meanwhile,
those
cuts
to
military
pensions
were
wrong
from
the
start.
There
are
plenty
of
places
to
cut
more
spending
&#8211;
tax
breaks
for
big
corporations
that
send
American
jobs
overseas ,
and
wars
of

that
continue

hundreds

we
should
be
investing
at
home,
come
immediately

Hard-earned

should
have
never
gone

I
am
thankful
this
was
fixed

So
all
in

last

was
a
good

We

some
important

done.
Happy
President&#8217;s
