LEGISLATION
April 05, 2015
Dear
David,
The House recently passed
H.R. 2, the Medicare Access and Children's Health Insurance
Program Reauthorization Act . In addition to replacing the current
Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) payment method
with a new payment
program that the Congressional Budget Office stated will save almost a
billion dollars, this measure includes funding for the Teaching Health
Center Graduate Medical Education program. In rural areas, the need for
primary care physicians and dentists is a federal priority. Teaching
Health Centers currently train more than 500 primary care physicians in
health centers that care for underserved populations, significantly
increasing the number of caregivers training in community based
settings. Northern California has multiple Teaching Health Center programs,
including Shasta Community Health Center in Redding,
CA.
Earlier last month, I authored
this
letter , supported by a wide coalition of House Members, urging House
leadership to continue the Teaching Health Center program before
funding expires this fall. I was very pleased that we were successful in
including funding for this important program in H.R. 2, and am looking
forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on rural health care
priorities.
Below are some recent highlights from my time in
California. To learn about how I can serve you and to follow me
throughout the week, please visit
my
website
and stay in touch with me on
my Facebook page .
I hope you and your loved ones have a
blessed Easter Sunday!
Sincerely,
Rep. LaMalfa speaks
at the Northern Valley Indian Health Groundbreaking Ceremony in Chico,
CA. NVIH has diligently served Butte, Colusa, Tehama, Glenn and Yolo
Counties for over 40 years. This new Chico clinic will ensure
increased access to medical care for local residents, and will provide up to
60 new employees with a thriving place of work.
On March 19 th , 60Plus honors Rep. LaMalfa
with the Benjamin Franklin Award for his determination help end the
estate taxa temporary defense tax that Congress imposed to fund World
War I. 96 years later, this temporary tax still exists and continues
to harm family run businesses and family farms across the country.
Rep. LaMalfa proudly stands for its repeal.
Joined by the air boss, who oversees
flight operations, Rep. LaMalfa visited the USS
Ronald Reagan ,
one of the nations largest and newest aircraft carriers. After
installing new equipment, the
Reagan

will deploy to the Seventh Fleet in the Pacific Ocean.
Coming Up in the North State
Rep. LaMalfa will host a
Congressional Fire Forum
at two separate locations on
Wednesday April 8th, 2015. The Congressman and his staff will be on hand to
hear how residents were impacted by Siskiyou County fires and discuss
forest management reforms to reduce the threat of fires. The forum
will also include presentations organized by Siskiyou County Supervisor
Ray Haupt.
