Congressman Mike Turner (OH-10) joined the hosts of 'Bloomberg Surveillance' to discuss the Bipartisan Budget Deal and its effects on the sequestration cuts that have hindered the Dayton community since their implementation.

Congressman Turner has held numerous community forums warning of the devastating effects sequestration has on our national security as well as our local economy. The budget deal makes critical steps to restore funding to the Department of Defense that was removed as a result of sequestration and prevents the loss of thousands of jobs in the Miami Valley.
While the budget deal that was approved by the House last week makes steps to address the out-of-control spending, there is still work to be done to reign in wasteful spending. The budget deal cuts $23 billion in deficit spending without raising taxes and most importantly avoids any government shutdowns for the next two years. The bipartisan agreement provides stability and certainty in our budget process and allows our military and other government agencies the ability to layout strategic plans.
