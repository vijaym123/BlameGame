House Leaders Sends Members Home; a Pile of
Unfinished Work Awaits Their Return
Speaker Boehner sent House Members home on
September 18, the earliest departure of the Congress for the elections
since 1960.
Of course, House Members can and do work back home in
their districts; however, the 113th Congress is on track to be one of
the most unproductive in history.
The House Leadership has spent most of this year on
ideological bills to sue President Obama, repeal the Affordable Care Act, and
give away the store to the oil and coal industries.
Left undone
is any action to ensure that women receive equal pay for equal work,
increase the minimum wage, extend vitally-needed unemployment benefits,
fix our broken immigration laws, or end tax breaks for corporations
shipping jobs overseas.
Congress Approves Bill to Combat ISIS
Terrorists
Americans
overwhelmingly agree that something needs to be done to stop the terrorist
group ISIS (Islamic State in Iraq and Syria).
ISIS has beheaded
two American journalists, a British foreign aid worker, and hundreds of
civilians in Iraq and Syria.
In the last several months,
hundreds of thousands of innocent men, women and children have been uprooted
from their homes and forced to flee the systematic killing by
ISIS.
Religious minorities, including the Christian population in
northern Iraq, have been told to convert to ISISs perverted form of
religion or be killed.
Women and children are being sold into
slavery.
But Americans
are also wary about getting involved in another war in the Middle
East.
President Obama has ordered air strikes against ISIS, and he is
mobilizing an international coalition to combat these
terrorists.
The President also urged Congress to grant him authority to train
those in the Syrian opposition who are willing to fight ISIS.
After several days of debate, the House voted 273 to 156 to move forward
with this plan.

Lawmakers Work to Stop Nuclear Waste Dump Next
to Great Lakes
Rep. Levin has joined other concerned Great Lakes lawmakers in
cosponsoring
House Resolution 716 , which urges the
Canadian Government not to move forward with plans to build a permanent
nuclear waste repository less than one mile from Lake Huron.
The proposed facility would hold up to 52 million gallons of nuclear
waste.
