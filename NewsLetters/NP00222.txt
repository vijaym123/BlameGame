Rep. Curbelo Applauds Trade Preferences Extension Act, Benefitting Haitian Community in South Florida
Washington, D.C.
Today, the House passed with overwhelming bipartisan support H.R. 1295, the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015. Rep. Curbelo issued the following statement in support of its passage:
H.R. 1295 is a significant step forward in advancing trade under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). This package also extends the preferential duty treatment program for products from Haiti. Promoting the expansion of U.S. trade with Haiti and Sub-Saharan African countries through decreased tariffs opens dynamic and new markets for all those involved.
South Florida is home to thousands of Haitian Americans, and Im proud this legislation extends the duty-free benefit programs for Haiti through September 30, 2025. This bill will help many relatives of the members of our community and I thank the House for its overwhelming support and look forward to H.R. 1295 becoming law.
H.R. 1295
passed the Senate with added amendments on May 14, 2015 by a vote of
97-1 . H.R. 1295 passed the House on June 11, 2015 by a vote of
397-32.
