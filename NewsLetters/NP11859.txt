Dear Friend,
Part of what makes America so special are the countless opportunities
this country offers folks,
including the ability for people to work
hard and rise above their circumstances to build a better life for
themselves and their families.
In this country, we are raised to
believe that if we are hard-working and put in a full day's work, we
will be able to provide for our families.
Far too many people in this
country are still living in poverty, despite working countless hours
each week.
These hardworking families should not have to choose
between paying rent and putting food on the dinner table. We need to
ensure that that promise of American opportunity is still true today
and for generations to come.
The minimum wage in this country has been stagnant since 2007 at $7.25
an hour. And while the unemployment rate in Texas remains low, the
poverty rate in our state is well above the national average.
Hardworking Americans deserve a raise to earn a fair and decent wage
and keep pace with our growing economy.
Capitol Hill Report: A hard day's work should earn a decent day's pay
This week, I joined with over 170 of my Democratic colleagues in
signing a discharge petition calling for Speaker Boehner to allow an
immediate vote on the Fair Minimum Wage Act, H.R. 1010, legislation to
raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour.
An increase of the minimum wage would be monumental for millions of
Americans:
*	Wages would rise for 25 million workers
*	Income for families living below the poverty line would rise by
a combined $5 billion
*	Between 1 million and 4.5 million people would be moved out of
poverty
No one who works full-time should be living below the poverty line.
Failing to pay hardworking men and women a fair wage is preventing
families from prospering and hindering our economic growth.
A person's
income should reflect the time and commitment they put into their jobs
and folks who work hard and contribute to our society deserve to earn a
fair wage.
By raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, we will be
taking a vital step to close the opportunity gap that unfortunately
still exists in this country.
San Antonio Report: Recognizing Families Helping Families
While I was serving in the Texas Legislature, I started hosting an
annual dinner -Families Helping Families - to recognize the selfless
family members who've stepped up to take care of their younger
relatives. This year, I joined over 250 caregivers, many of them
grandparents, and community leaders at the dinner held at Memorial High
School.
I was moved by the many stories and sacrifices they have made
in order to care for their younger relatives. It is an honor to
recognize these San Antonians every year.
Honoring National African American History Month
One month is never enough to honor the contributions of any group of
people, especially in the United States of America where the fabric of
our history is sewn by the threads of so many people's histories. The
end of February doesn't mean the end of celebrating the invaluable
contributions of African-Americans.
Neither does it mean limiting this
year's theme for National African American History Month - Civil Rights
- to a one month pursuit.
Among the intellectual and cultural gifts of African-Americans to our
country has been the long and hard fight to make our nation live up to
the noble ideals expressed in the Declaration of Independence and
Constitution. It is a fight that must continue and there is no better
way to honor the history of African-Americans, and the history of all
Americans, than to continue to work together to ensure that all of our
rights are secure and protected.
I am committed to working alongside my colleagues in Congress to ensure
all Americans are provided with opportunities to gain a brighter future
for themselves and their loved ones - including a fair and decent wage
for their hard work and access to affordable, quality health coverage.
Sincerely,
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
Part
of
what
makes
America
so
special
are
the
countless
opportunities
this
country
offers
folks,
including
the
ability
for
people
to
work
hard
and
rise
above
their
circumstances
to
build
a
better
life
for
themselves
and
their
families.
In
this
country,
we
are
raised
to
believe
that
if
we
are
hard-working
and
put
in
a
full
day&#8217;s
work,
we
will
be
able
to
provide
for
our
families.
Far
too
many
people
in
this
country
are
still
living
in
poverty,
despite
working
countless
hours
each
week.
These
hardworking
families
should
not
have
to
choose
between
paying
rent
and
putting
food
on
the
dinner
table.
We
need
to
ensure
that
that
promise
of
American
opportunity
is
still
true
today
and
for
generations
to
come.
The
minimum
wage
in
this
country
has
been
stagnant
since
2007
at
$7.25
an
hour.
And
while
the
unemployment
rate
in
Texas
remains
low,
the
poverty
rate
in
our
state
is
well
above
the
national
average.
Hardworking
Americans
deserve
a
raise
to
earn
a
fair
and
decent
wage
and
keep
pace
with
our
growing
economy.
Capitol
Hill
Report:
A
hard
day&#8217;s
work
should
earn
a
decent
day&#8217;s
pay
This
week,
I
joined
with
over
170
of
my
Democratic
colleagues
in
signing
a
discharge
petition
calling
for
Speaker
Boehner
to
allow
an
immediate
vote
on
the
Fair
Minimum
Wage
Act ,
H.R.
1010,
legislation
to
raise
the
federal
minimum
wage
to
$10.10
an
hour.
An
increase
of
the
minimum
wage
would
be
monumental
for
millions
of
Americans:
Wages
would
rise
for
25
million
workers Income
for
families
living
below
the
poverty
line
would
rise
by
a
combined
$5
billion Between
1
million
and
4.5
million
people
would
be
moved
out
of
poverty
No
one
who
works
full-time
should
be
living
below
the
poverty
line.
Failing
to
pay
hardworking
men
and
women
a
fair
wage
is
preventing
families
from
prospering
and
hindering
our
economic
growth.
A
person&#8217;s
income
should
reflect
the
time
and
commitment
they
put
into
their
jobs
and
folks
who
work
hard
and
contribute
to
our
society
deserve
to
earn
a
fair
wage.
By
raising
the
minimum
wage
to
$10.10
an
hour,
we
will
be
taking
a
vital
step
to
close
the
opportunity
gap
that
unfortunately
still
exists
in
this
country.
San
Antonio
Report:
Recognizing
Families
Helping
Families
While
I
was
serving
in
the
Texas
Legislature,
I
started
hosting
an
annual
dinner
&#8211; Families
Helping
Families
&#8211;
to
recognize
the
selfless
family
members
who&#8217;ve
stepped up
to
take
care
of
their
younger
relatives.
This
year,
I
joined
over
250
caregivers,
many
of
them
grandparents,
and
community
leaders
at
the
dinner
held
at
Memorial
High
School.
I
was
moved
by
the
many
stories
and
sacrifices
they
have
made
in
order
to
care
for
their
younger
relatives.
It
is
an
honor
to
recognize
these
San
Antonians
every
year.
Honoring
National
African
American
History
Month
One
month
is
never
enough
to
honor
the
contributions
of
any
group
of
people,
especially
in
the
United
States
of
America
where
the
fabric
of
our
history
is
sewn
by
the
threads
of
so
many
people&#8217;s
histories.
The
end
of
February
doesn&#8217;t
mean
the
end
of
celebrating
the
invaluable
contributions
of
African-Americans.
Neither
does
it
mean
limiting
this
year&#8217;s
theme
for
National
African
American
History
Month
&#8211;
Civil
Rights
&#8211;
to
a
one
month
pursuit.
Among
the
intellectual
and
cultural
gifts
of
African-Americans
to
our
country
has
been
the
long
and
hard
fight
to
make
our
nation
live
up
to
the
noble
ideals
expressed
in
the
Declaration
of
Independence
and
Constitution.
It
is
a
fight
that
must
continue
and
there
is
no
better
way
to
honor
the
history
of
African-Americans,
and
the
history
of
all
Americans,
than
to
continue
to
work
together
to
ensure
that
all
of
our
rights
are
secure
and
protected.
I
am
committed
to
working
alongside
my
colleagues
in
Congress
to
ensure
all
Americans
are
provided
with
opportunities
to
gain
a
brighter
future
for
themselves
and
their
loved
ones
&#8211;
including
a
fair
and
decent
wage
for
their
hard
work
and
access
to
affordable,
quality
health
coverage.
Sincerely,
Member
of
Congress
