Blaine's Bulletin
I have always been a firm believer that the gift of life is an inherent right bestowed on each and every human being and that we must do all what we can as a society to protect the rights of the unborn. As a father and grandfather, I take the protection of those who cannot protect themselves seriously.
This year marks the 41 st
year of the of
Roe v. Wade
decision which legalized abortion and until that decision is reversed, I will continue to do all I can as your representative in Congress to limit the incidence of abortion by denying federal dollars to fund these procedures while ensuring that pregnant women are fully informed on the development of their children.
Unfortunately, since that fateful day in January, 1973, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on
Roe v. Wade , there have been horrendous acts of abortion including those perpetrated by Dr. Kermit Gosnell, who last summer was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the murder of three babies born alive after failed abortions. Reading horrific stories such as the Gosnell case makes the pro-life cause even more urgent.
Each January, I am humbled when thousands of Americans make their way to Washington to participate in the March for Life which this year takes place on Wednesday, January 22. I am also encouraged by the significant turnout from the Show Me State. Even though the weather in January is less than ideal, hundreds of students, parents, and teachers from the 3 rd
District and across Missouri make the grueling bus trip to partake in the walk and spend the day in Washington fighting for those who cannot speak for themselves. These peaceful protestors are an inspiration and provide me, other pro-life legislators, and the entire pro-life community strength in continuing our defense of life.
This Congress, I have co-sponsored numerous pro-life bills including the
Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act
which would ensure that Title X family planning grants are used for the intended purpose and are prohibited from being used to provide abortions. I also am a proud co-sponsor of the
Health Care Conscience Rights Act
which would stipulate that nothing in the presidents health-care law can be construed to authorize a health plan provider or sponsor to provide, participate in or refer for a specific item or service contrary to the providers or sponsors religious or moral convictions including abortions.
The people of the 3 rd
District can rest assured that I will continue to support pro-life legislation to stand up for our future generations. The life of every child is priceless and each of them should have the opportunity to live the life that God has granted them. We must all be the voice for those who do not yet have one.
