Dear
Constituent,
We are quickly approaching what could be one of the worst
wildfire seasons in history, due in part to one of the most severe
droughts on record. Minimizing the damage caused by wild fires requires
everyones awareness. Please know that my office stands ready as your
partner both in preparing for this wildfire season and in addressing its
potential aftermath. As one piece of this partnership, I would like to
spread awareness of a variety of programs that exist to help residents
before, during, and after
wildfires.
Before a wildfire strikes, there are steps
you can take both to protect your home and prepare you and your family
for an emergency. The National Interagency Fire Center recommends that
homeowners in wildfire prone areas create a 30-100 foot safety zone
around their homes. By cleaning flammable materials from roofs and
gutters, clearing vegetation and trees, and regularly cutting the grass,
you can establish a buffer between you, your property, and fires. More
steps to protect your property can be found at
www.NIFC.gov .
To prepare for a wildfire, individuals and businesses should build an
emergency kit and make a disaster communications and escape plan.
www.Ready.gov/wildfires
provides tips on what to
include in a kit and how to plan
ahead.
If you see smoke or a fire, call 911
dont
assume that someone else has. In the event of a wildfire, evacuate if
instructed to do so. During an evacuation, you can text the word
SHELTER, followed by your zip code (eg SHELTER 99999) to 4FEMA (43362) to
find the nearest wildfire
shelter.

After a fire,
do not return to your home until fire officials say it is safe to do
so. In the immediate aftermath, groups like the Red Cross and
Salvation Army often help with pressing needs, such as food, clothing and
emergency housing. To best ensure coverage for damages, be sure to file a
claim with your insurance
company.
The Governor of California may also declare a State
of Emergency and request assistance from FEMA, at which point grants
such as the joint FEMA Individuals and Households Program may be made
available. You can get more information on FEMA grants by calling FEMA
at 1-800-621-3362, visiting
www.fema.gov/apply-assistance , or calling my Palm Springs
office.
You may also apply for an
individual disaster loan from the Small Business Association, at
www.sba.gov/content/apply-disaster-loan . Small businesses
may receive up to $2 million in both physical and economic injury
disaster loans from the Small Business Association after a wildfire or
other disaster to cover repairs, as well as assistance in paying
necessary operating expenses if your business suffered economic losses due to
the fire. This assistance includes Home and Personal Property Loans,
so if you do not own a business but your home was damaged by a fire,
you may still be able to apply for a loan to make
repairs.
Last year after the Mountain Fire threatened residents, homes
and businesses near Mountain Center and Idyllwild, I introduced the
H.R. 3333, the Wildfire Prevention Act of 2013, which allows the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to proactively coordinate with
states and localities on wildfire mitigation projects, so we can help
prevent the next brush fire from becoming a wildfire emergency. I am
working on this and other solutions to help our communities gain access to
the resources they need that can save lives and
property.
As your representative and advocate, please remember that my
door is always open. Please contact my Palm Springs office by phone at
(760) 424
8888 if you have any questions or if there is anything we
can do to help you. Stay
safe!
Sincerely,
Raul Ruiz,
