Dear Friend,
Speaker John Boehner is on a political witch hunt -- and the President is the target.
Members of the right wing have been screaming about impeaching the President for a long time. But the Speaker knows that won&rsquo;t work -- mostly because the President hasn&rsquo;t done anything wrong.
So instead,
the Speaker is planning on suing the President over his Executive Orders.
This isn&rsquo;t a serious lawsuit. This is a ridiculous stunt to rile up a Tea Party base in an election year.
Today, I&rsquo;m teaming up with my Democratic colleagues to demand Speaker Boehner drop this lawsuit and get back to work. We need you to join us. Add your name today.
Speaker Boehner is planning to use taxpayer money on this lawsuit. For the leader of the party that often claims the mantle of &ldquo;fiscal responsibility,&rdquo; spending our money on a frivolous lawsuit doesn&rsquo;t sound all that responsible to me.
The attention Speaker Boehner is using on this silly sideshow
could
be focused on much better things. Like ending workplace discrimination for LGBT individuals, raising the minimum wage, passing common sense gun control, or creating jobs. It is simply unacceptable that House Republicans insist on ignoring their duty to the American people and pursuing this purely partisan witch hunt. I won&rsquo;t stand for it -- and if you&rsquo;re with me, sign the petition today. Tell Speaker Boehner and Republicans in Congress it&rsquo;s time to stop the antics and get back to work.
Thank you for joining me in this today.
