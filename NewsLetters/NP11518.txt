Unemployed Vets Deserve Help NOW
Dear Friend,
Unconscionable. That's the only way to describe the fact that 200,000
jobless veterans have lost their emergency unemployment benefits since
January, according to a new report from the Center on Budget & Policy
Priorities.
These vets, unemployed through no fault of their own, are among two
million Americans in this fix because the House Majority refuses to
extend emergency help to those who have exhausted their regular
unemployment benefits - people still struggling to return to the
workforce during our nation's slow recovery from the worst recession
since the Great Depression.
As a businessman of 32 years, let me be clear. Unemployment
compensation is not welfare or charity.
Unemployment compensation is an insurance policy, paid for by employers
to help workers provide for their families as they transition from one
job to another. In particularly tough times, Congress has the
obligation to step in and provide the emergency funds necessary to
extend - not cut off - that lifeline.
Many of the 200,000 veterans now left high and dry have returned from
Afghanistan and Iraq, where they put themselves in harm's way to
protect and serve us. Now we have a sacred obligation to protect and
serve them with all the services and resources a grateful nation can
provide. To that end, I joined 160 of my colleagues last week in an
appeal to House leadership to bring an emergency unemployment
assistance bill to the Floor for an immediate vote. You can read our
letter
here
.
We owe these veterans - these American HEROES - no less.
We will keep you posted as events proceed. Meanwhile, I want to hear
your thoughts. Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below, or

No "Fast Track" Approval for Job Killer Trade Agreements
Click the image above to read my joint op-ed with Rep. Keith Ellison.
(Artwork courtesy of the Star Tribune.)
In considering the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and other future
trade agreements, the lesson is clear: Congress must avoid - not repeat
- the terrible mistake made 20 years ago when the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was put on a 'fast track,' ramrodded through
the House with no debate or amendments allowed.
That was the message Congressman Keith Ellison and I delivered in our
opinion piece published in last Thursday's edition of the Minneapolis
Star Tribune. You can read our piece - and more about the TPP - here

House Votes to Speed Propane Deliveries
The federal government should not stand in the way of consumers and the
fuel they need to make it to spring. That was the point of bipartisan
legislation passed last week, allowing truckers delivering propane to
drive longer hours, and cosponsored by fellow Minnesotans Tim Walz,
John Kline, and yours truly.
The Home Heating Emergency Assistance Through Transportation Act
provides a temporary exemption - through the end of May - to federal
regulations that have slowed deliveries of propane to northern
Minnesota and other areas particularly hard hit by this record cold
winter. Of course highway safety is paramount. We can't have tired
truckers driving beyond their limits. This common-sense bill simply
assures that the federal government isn't standing in the way of
families who need this precious fuel to heat their homes. The bill now
goes to the Senate for hopefully quick consideration.

Next Generation Drones Hold Promise, Face Challenges
With fellow Members of the House Transportation & Infrastructure's
Subcommittee on Aviation, discussing how we can safely integrate the
use of unmanned aircraft into our airspace.
Beyond their military functions, small, unmanned drone aircraft have
the potential to help find lost children, monitor weather effects on
crops, measure air and water quality, map forest fires, and even send
blood samples from remote areas to medical centers where they can be
quickly analyzed.
It's clear, however, that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
needs time beyond Congress' original 2015 deadline to write the rules
and safety regulations necessary to ensure the next generation of
domestic drones don't interfere with larger aircraft. With that in
mind, our House Aviation Subcommittee convened a panel of experts last
week to further discuss proper procedures for testing drones at several
designated sites across the nation.
As with any new technology, we need to anticipate problems and get
things right. In this case, that also includes safeguards to make
certain our privacy is protected. That's why we've decided to give the
FAA the time they need for more study as we move ahead to develop a new
generation of drones, wisely and carefully.

Federal Buildings to Set Energy-Saving Example
As the federal government sets new environmental and energy saving
standards for cars, homes, manufacturers, and utilities, we ought to be
doing the same for our own public buildings. That was the common-sense
logic behind passage last week of the bipartisan Better Buildings Act
of 2014 (H.R. 2126) to require federal buildings to meet tough new
energy standards, and help lead the way to energy independence and
lower carbon emissions.
Many of our federal buildings are decades old, and the energy
improvements this bill requires will save taxpayer dollars while
reducing our dependency on fossil fuels and helping keep our air
cleaner and healthier.

Our Week in Pictures
The Minnesota Association of Counties gathered in the beautiful Members
Room of the Library of Congress last week, where I had the chance to
thank them for their important work and counsel in finding national and
local support for transportation projects in the 8th District.
Our recent joint op-ed
warning against closed-door deals and secret TPP "fast
track" negotiations was the top of the agenda as Rep. Keith Ellison & I
welcomed the Minnesota delegation of the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers (IBEW) to Washington, including Dan Ferguson of
Stacy, MN.
Bicycle advocates in town for the National Bike Summit, including
Natalie Gille of Bemidji, stopped by my office to discuss how to
promote the benefits of bicycling, complete streets, and alternative
modes of transportation in the next Transportation bill, due to come up
this summer.
In between votes, I met with Rear Admiral Fred Midgette, Commander of
the Ninth Coast Guard District, and Lt. JG James Ellsworth. These are
the "Guardians of the Great Lakes," and their ice cutting operations
have been absolutely critical during this record-breaking winter in
keeping our harbors and rivers clear for commerce.
Speaking of the Great Lakes, the leaders of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Association Great Lakes leadership were in my office to
discuss how to restore and protect our lakes.
I met with a delegation of Funeral Directors, including Leif Larsen
from International Falls, here as part of the National Funeral
Directors Association Advocacy Summit to discuss issues important to
the funeral service industry.
Meeting St. Croix Falls National Scenic Riverway Superintendent Chris
Stein over the weekend, discussing what Minnesotans can do to protect,
preserve, and restore the waterways and national parks we share with
our Wisconsin neighbors.
Touring the floor with Scott Hansen, Senior Fabrication Specialist at
Premier Pontoons in Wyoming, on my ongoing Make It In America tour of
local manufacturers and entrepreneurs who bring jobs to the 8th!
_____
Briefly...
Last week, I became a cosponsor of the following:
.
The bipartisan Jobs Originated through Launching Travel
(JOLT) Act to streamline part of the visa application interview process
for visitors to America, as well as relax some federal rules for
Canadians over 50 who have a second home in the United States.
.
H.R.3879, to provide mandatory funding for PILT, the Payment
in Lieu of Taxes Program. We fought successfully to include this
important program in this year's Farm Bill, as it rewards states and
counties who set aside federal land for nature reserves or for
conservation by providing funds to offset the lost revenue.
.
H.R.4162 - of which I am an original cosponsor - to
establish a Financing Energy Efficient Manufacturing Program in the
Department of Energy, promoting energy efficiency and onsite renewable
technologies in manufacturing and industrial facilities.
.
The Email Privacy Act, H.R.1852, to ensure our emails remain
our private property by extending 4th Amendment rights to all
electronic communication.

Coming Up in Minnesota Congress is coming to you this week with

Finally...
Hot Dish Competition Heats Up
Last year, as part of Senator Franken's Annual Minnesota Delegation
Hotdish Cook Off, I presented "Ranger Rick's Real Deal Hotdish." We
unfortunately did not take the grand prize.
As Senator Al Franken likes to say, "Once a year we set aside politics
for what's really important to Minnesota - Hotdish." For our Minnesota
Congressional delegation, a little fun and friendly competition helps
build personal relationships leading to bipartisan cooperation on real
public policy issues. This Wednesday marks the fourth annual Minnesota
Delegation Hot Dish Competition. Each Member submits their favorite
hotdish to a panel of judges, including former Minnesota Congressmen
Gerry Sikorski and Vin Weber. Last year my "Real Deal Ranger Hotdish"
was edged out by Congressman Tim Walz's "Herman the German" concoction
of tater tots, cheese and hamburger. Watch next week's Monday Report
for this year's results.

Unemployed

Dear
Friend,
Unconscionable .
That's
the
only
way
to
describe
the
fact
that
200,000
jobless
veterans
have
lost
their
emergency
unemployment
benefits
since
January,
according
to
a
new

These

because
the
House

-
people
still
struggling
to

during
our

from
the
worst
recession
since
the
Great

As
a
businessman
of
32

let
me
be
clear.
Unemployment

Unemployment

paid
for
by
employers
to
help

In
particularly
tough

Congress
has
the
obligation
to
step
in
and
provide
the
emergency
funds
necessary
to
extend
-
not

off
-
that
lifeline.
Many
of
the
200,000
veterans
now
left
high
and
dry
have
returned
from
Afghanistan
and
Iraq,
where
they
put
themselves
in
harm's
way
to
protect
and
serve
us.
Now
we
have
a
sacred
obligation
to
protect
and
serve
them
with
all
the

a
grateful
nation
can
provide .
To

Of

It's

that
the
