A Message from Representative Sean Duffy
May 25, 2014
Dear friends,
In our house, sending off an Honor Flight, honoring a soldier at a
medal ceremony or passing by the many Veterans who line the parade
routes, is a family affair. I see the wonder in my children's eyes as
they shake the hands of heroes and I am grateful that they have the
opportunity to meet and know them.
As we gather in our respective communities this weekend to honor our
servicemen and women, it is also one more opportunity to offer our
thanks. However, in light of recent events, we must also show them our
thanks as well.
Our Veterans selflessly served and defended this country, and were
promised not just gratitude, but the care of a grateful nation in
return. The government and the administrative officials who run it,
have not held-up their end of the agreement. We must do better. Our
Veterans deserve better. We're going to make good on that promise. I
will see to it that those responsible for the mismanagement at the VA
are held accountable.
An effort to do better: This week the House passed H.R. 4031, the
Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act of 2014 and I was glad
to support it. If you look at recent VA preventable deaths, patient
safety incidents and backlog increases, Department senior executives
who presided over negligence and mismanagement are more likely to have
received a bonus or glowing performance review than any sort of
punishment. H.R. 4031 would give the Secretary of the Department of
Veterans Affairs the authority to remove employees of the Senior
Executive Service when it is believed that their performance warrants
removal from their position. This bill draws down the bureaucratic and
drawn-out process that often makes it nearly impossible to remove
ineffective managers.
Just recognition: The 7th District is the proud home of nearly 10,000
Hmong-Americans.
This week I introduced H. Res. 596 to
recognize the service of Kmer and Hmong "Freedom Fighters" who fought
alongside, supported, and defended U.S. Armed Forces during the Vietnam
War. These Veterans rescued United States pilots shot down in
enemy-controlled territory and returned them to safety, provided
intelligence, captured and destroyed enemy supply lines, and provided
food and shelter to U.S. troops. They deserve the gratitude of our
nation, and this resolution awards them the recognition that they've
long deserved. To read the full release on the resolution, click here

A long overdue thank you: Nearly 200 Veterans, students, and members of
the community gathered in Prentice on Monday to honor and thank
Specialist Ronald
Sandquist on the reception of
his Bronze Star for heroic acts during the Vietnam War. He has been
eligible to receive the award for more than 40 years, but like so many
of our heroes, he returned home from war and returned to regular life.
However, the life and achievements of Specialist Sandquist are far from
regular. At the prodding of his VFW commander who initially brought
this to my office's attention, we were very glad to bestow this long
overdue honor on him this week.
It was my honor to meet Specialist
Sandquist, award him his medal, and personally thank him for his
incredible service to, and defense of, our nation.
Before my family fires up the grill this weekend, we will first offer a
prayer: A prayer of thanks to all of our Veterans, gratitude to the
friends and neighbors for whom we remember on this day, and an extra
prayer for the families who support, guide and memorialize our heroes
every single day. Thank you to all who serve our nation. Until next
week.
Have a great week,
Sean

A
Message
from
Representative
Sean
Duffy
May 25, 2014
Dear
friends,
In
our
house,
sending
off
an
Honor
Flight,
honoring
a
soldier
at
a
medal
ceremony
or
passing
by
the
many
Veterans
who
line
the
parade
routes,
is
a
family
affair.
I
see
the
wonder
in
my
children&#8217;s
eyes
as
they
shake
the
hands
of
heroes
and
I
am
grateful
that
they
have
the
opportunity
to
meet
and
know
them.
As
we
gather
in
our
respective
communities
this
weekend
to
honor
our
servicemen
and
women,
it
is
also
one
more
opportunity
to
offer
our
thanks.
However,
in
light
of
recent
events,
we
must
also
show
them
our
thanks
as
well.
Our
Veterans
selflessly
served
and
defended
this
country,
and
were
promised
not
just
gratitude,
but
the
care
of
a
grateful
nation
in
return.
The
government
and
the
administrative
officials
who
run
it,
have
not
held-up
their
end
of
the
agreement.
We
must
do
better.
Our
Veterans
deserve
better.
We&#8217;re
going
to
make
good
on
that
promise.
I
will
see
to
it
that
those
responsible
for
the
mismanagement
at
the
VA
are
held
accountable.
An
effort
to
do
better:
T his
week
the
House
passed
H.R.
4031,
the
Veterans
Affairs
Management
Accountability
Act
of
2014
and
I
was
glad
to
support
it.
If
you
look
at
recent
VA
preventable
deaths,
patient
safety
incidents
and
backlog
increases,
Department
senior
executives
who
presided
over
negligence
and
mismanagement
are
more
likely
to
have
received
a
bonus
or
glowing
performance
review
than
any
sort
of
punishment.
H.R.
4031
would
give
the
Secretary
of
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
the
authority
to
remove
employees
of
the
Senior
Executive
Service
when
it
is
believed
that
their
performance
warrants
removal
fr om
their
position.
This
bill
draws
down
the
bureaucratic
and
drawn-out
process
that
often
makes
it
nearly
impossible
to
remove
ineffective
managers.
Just
recognition:
The
7 th
District
is
the
proud
home
of
nearly
10,000
Hmong-Americans. This
week
I
introduced
H.
Res.
596
to
recognize
the
service
of
Kmer
and
Hmong
&#8220;Freedom
Fighters&#8221;
who
fought
alongside,
supported,
and
defended
U.S.
Armed
Forces
during
the
Vietnam
War.
These
Veterans
rescued
United
States
pilots
shot
down
in
enemy-controlled
territory
and
returned
them
to
safety,
provided
intelligence,
captured
and
destroyed
enemy
supply
lines,
and
provided
food
and
shelter
to
U.S.
troops.
They
deserve
the
gratitude
of
our
nation,
and
this
resolution
awards
them
the
recognition
that
they&#8217;ve
long
deserved.

A
long
overdue
thank
you:
Nearly
200
Veterans,
students,
and
members
of
the
community
gathered
in
Prentice
on
Monday
to
honor
and
thank
Specialist
Ronald
Sandquist
on
the
reception
of
his
Bronze
Star
for
heroic
acts
during
the
Vietnam
War.
He
has
been
eligible
to
receive
the
award
for
more
than
40
years,
but
like
so
many
of
our
heroes,
he
returned
home
from
war
and
returned
to
regular
life.
However,
the
life
and
achievements
of
Specialist
Sandquist
are
far
from
regular.
At
the
prodding
of
his
VFW
commander
who
initially
brought
this
to
my
office&#8217;s
attention,
we
were
very
glad
to
bestow
this
long
overdue
honor
on
him
this
week.
It
was
my
honor
to
meet
Specialist
Sandquist,
award
him
his
medal,
and
personally
thank
him
for
his
incredible
service
to,
and
defense
of,
our
nation.
Before
my
family
fires
up
the
grill
this
weekend,
we
will
first
offer
a
prayer:
A
prayer
of
thanks
to
all
of
our
Veterans,
gratitude
to
the
friends
and
neighbors
for
whom
we
remember
on
this
day,
and
an
extra
prayer
for
the
families
who
support,
guide
and
memorialize
our
heroes
every
single
day.
Thank
you
to
all
who
serve
our
nation.
Until
next
week&#8230;
Have
a
great
week,
Sean
