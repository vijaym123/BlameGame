Friends,
$18,157,019,361,793.00
This was the total of the U.S. national debt when my
House Budget Committee colleagues and I passed our budget plan last
Thursday at 11:00 a.m.
In fact, here is a screenshot of the debt
clock:
Sadly, the debt clock numbers are
correct.
The U.S. national debt was $18.15 trillion, the debt per
citizen was $56,647, and the debt per taxpayer was $154,113.
If
the federal government does not start operating on a balanced budget,
these numbers will only continue to
climb.
This debt is irresponsible.
If the President, Congress, and federal agencies continue on
this current fiscal path, our children and grandchildren will be
responsible for hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt.
Our country
must start operating on a budget that balances, pays down the
national debt, and restrains spending.
Luckily, there is a
budget plan that accomplishes all of this and
more.
After numerous meetings and
hearings, my House Budget Committee colleagues and I
unveiled our
Fiscal Year 2016 Budget Proposal:
A Balanced Budget
for a Stronger America .
Here is a snapshot of A
Balanced Budget for a Stronger America, compiled by the
committee:

raising taxes, contrast to the Presidents budget which never
balances

trillion in spending

proposal

economy
