Guantanamo
The Wall Street Journal reported
that the Obama
Administration will attempt to circumvent Congress, ignore the will of
the American people and transfer prisoners from Guantanamo Bay to
domestic locations, possibly including the Naval brig in Hanahan, South
Carolina.
I have yet to see any plans or studies that show that transferring
prisoners from Guantanamo Bay to South Carolina or any other domestic
location will make America safer. We are talking about some of the most
dangerous terrorists in the world, including planners of September 11th
and the attack on the U.S.S. Cole. They should stay right where they
are - in cells at the prison on Guantanamo Bay, far away from our
schools and families.
If the administration attempts to push this idea forward it will meet
serious opposition, period.

Reining in the NLRB
This week I announced my support for the National Labor Relations Board
Reform Act, S.2814, which when enacted will turn the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) back to a neutral arbiter, an impartial and
unbiased board protecting the rights of both employers and employees.
It would also keep the general counsel from operating as an activist
for one side or the other.
South Carolina has experienced firsthand what happens when the NLRB
tries to bully a state, and I'm proud we fought back and won. The
National Labor Relations Board Reform Act will go a long way toward
stopping the ongoing partisan actions of the Obama Administration and
the activist board.
From their attempts to undermine secret ballots
for union elections to the President's unconstitutional play to stack
the board with leftwing partisans that would side exclusively with big
unions, the NLRB is out of control and must be changed now.

Standing Up for Taxpayers
I was honored to be recognized this week by the National Taxpayers
Union for standing up for economic opportunity and freedom and
protecting taxpayer dollars. I received the "Taxpayers' Friend Award,"
and will continue working to reduce federal spending, lower taxes and
repeal burdensome regulations so that every South Carolinian has the
opportunity to succeed.
We had a great time visiting Florence, Myrtle Beach, West Columbia, and
North Charleston this week; I look forward to seeing you around the
great state of South Carolina!
Sincerely,
Tim
