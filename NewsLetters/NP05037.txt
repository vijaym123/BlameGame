We don&rsquo;t know what else to do, David:
Boehner&rsquo;s on Illinois T.V. with a staggering
$4,8OO,OOO.OO
in deceptive ads
Karl Rove just released a massive ad campaign against Cheri
and we&rsquo;re running out of time to close the gap
The numbers are frightening:
Our ad buy deadline is tonight, but we&rsquo;re still coming up $1,211 short of our goal.
David, there&rsquo;s no time left. We need 75 donations by midnight to turn things around.
If we can hit the mark, it&rsquo;ll be a major victory for us --
but if we fall short, we might as well just pack up and go home.
Please, are you in? Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks for not backing down,
