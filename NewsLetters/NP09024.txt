Dear Friend,
This past Saturday, I had the opportunity to meet with Sgt.
Tahmooressi, the U.S. Marine being detained at el Hongo II prison in
Tijuana, Mexico. There, we discussed his treatment by prison personnel
and his legal case going forward.
While I'm deeply offended by some of the treatment he received at the
hands of prison officials at his previous detainment facility, I'm
pleased to report he is doing well and is in good spirits since being
relocated to el Hongo II. I also had the opportunity to tour this
facility and I left confident that he will be treated respectfully. I
also expressed to both prison officials and U.S. consular personnel
that his care going forward is of the utmost importance and that our
expectations are that when Andrew comes home, he will be in good
physical condition.
In addition, Sgt. Tahmooressi and I were able to hold a private
discussion regarding his case and strategy for his upcoming hearing.
He seems comfortable with his new attorney and is hopeful that he will
have a successful hearing where his story will be fully explained.
I understand the wheels of justice can be slow, but I remain frustrated
that this case, which amounts to a U.S. Marine making a wrong turn, has
taken so long to resolve. Andrew has served our country honorably and
was in San Diego to receive the scheduled PTSD treatment he desperately
needs. It is imperative that we get him home so he can recover. He is a
U.S. Marine, he is ours, and he needs to be home.
Sincerely,

Dear
Friend,
This
past
Saturday,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
meet
with
Sgt.
Tahmooressi,
the
U.S.
Marine
being
detained
at
el
Hongo
II
prison
in
Tijuana,
Mexico.
There,
we
discussed
his
treatment
by
prison
personnel
and
his
legal
case
going
forward.
While
I&#8217;m
deeply
offended
by
some
of
the
treatment
he
received
at
the
hands
of
prison
officials
at
his
previous
detainment
facility,
I&#8217;m
pleased
to
report
he
is
doing
well
and
is
in
good
spirits
since
being
relocated
to
el
Hongo
II.
I
also
had
the
opportunity
to
tour
this
facility
and
I
left
confident
that
he
will
be
treated
respectfully. I
also
expressed
to
both
prison
officials
and
U.S.
consular
personnel
that
his
care
going
forward
is
of
the
utmost
importance
and
that
our
expectations
are
that
when
Andrew
comes
home,
he
will
be
in
good
physical
condition.
In
addition,
Sgt.
Tahmooressi
and
I
were
able
to
hold
a
private
discussion
regarding
his
case
and
strategy
for
his
upcoming
hearing.
He
seems
comfortable
with
his
new
attorney
and
is
hopeful
that
he
will
have
a
successful
hearing
where
his
story
will
be
fully
explained.
I
understand
the
wheels
of
justice
can
be
slow,
but
I
remain
frustrated
that
this
case,
which
amounts
to
a
U.S.
Marine
making
a
wrong
turn,
has
taken
so
long
to
resolve.
Andrew
has
served
our
country
honorably
and
was
in
San
Diego
to
receive
the
scheduled
PTSD
treatment
he
desperately
needs.
It
is
imperative
that
we
get
him
home
so
he
can
recover.
He
is
a
U.S.
Marine,
he
is
ours,
and
he
needs
to
be
home.
