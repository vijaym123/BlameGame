Dear Friends,
The U.S. Senate has refused to support any of the legislative fixes we have proposed in the House of Representatives
to alleviate Californias drought. Our most recent attempts
temporary fixes we proposed during debate on the omnibus spending bill and the Farm Bill
were not supported by Californias senators.
The drought situation is critical and demands immediate action. Californias entire GOP delegation is now backing
a comprehensive water bill, the SacramentoSan Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act (H.R. 3964), that was introduced in the House today. This bill would finally end Californias perpetual water problem and allow us to store water in wet years for use
in dry ones.
You can read our press release for the bill
here
and a summary of its provisions
here .
Sincerely,
Devin Nunes
