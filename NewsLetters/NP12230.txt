Reining in
Washington
Small business owners I talk to in
North Missouri and across the country nearly unanimously say they need
a break from all the red tape.
A recent study found that the
annual cost of federal regulations stands at more than $1.75 trillion,
with small businesses paying a cost that is 36 percent higher on average
than larger counterparts.
The examples of overreach and
opportunities to rein in federal agencies are not hard to find.
Whether its the Department of Labor looking to prevent teens from
working on their family farms or the Environmental Protection Agency
floating the idea of regulating how much dust a farmer is allowed to stir
up, theres clearly a disconnect between what Washington bureaucrats
want and what our economy needs.
This week, the House will
address this disparity by considering the
Achieving Less Excess
in Regulation and Requiring Transparency Act
(H.R. 2804).
The bill combines several legislative proposals from this Congress,
including one I introduced to allow opportunities for better input from
small businesses on regulations in advance of new requirements.
It
seems common sense that you get a better rule when you consider the
consequences beforehand, and this legislation will help achieve that
goal.
Not all regulations are bad.
Many are
burdensome, however, and the sheer sum of them is a problem.
The nations
founders never anticipated an unrestrained regulatory state
so
lets call on Washington to practice some restraint.
The economy
will be better off, and small businesses will have more room to grow and
create jobs.
