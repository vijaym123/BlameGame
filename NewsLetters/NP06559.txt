The Scalise Capitol Report
September 8,
2014
The president
needs a strategy for ISIL
The recent beheadings of
American journalists prove yet again that the threat of Middle Eastern
terrorists is very real and a continued danger to our homeland
security. Terrorist groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant
(ISIL) are twisting religion to justify barbaric and unacceptable actions.
Our enemies don't fear us and our friends don't trust us. We cannot
afford to continue this failed foreign policy that has left America at
greater risk of attack at home. It is long past time for President
Obama to lay out a clear plan to confront these serious threats and
protect American families from terroristic groups like ISIL. While we have
not seen a strategy or plan from the president, Congress stands ready
to work with him in confronting these challenges head-on and to give
him any additional tools he needs to protect Americans here at home and
abroad.
A victory for the sacred institution of
marriage
When I was in the state legislature, I was the lead author of
an amendment to Louisiana's state constitution that defined marriage
as the union between one man and one woman. That amendment was
approved by an overwhelming majority
nearly 80%
of Louisiana voters in
2004. A federal judge recently upheld the will of Louisiana's voters and
affirmed that the U.S. Constitution leaves important public policy
questions such as the definition of marriage to the states. Rather than
join a rush of other opinions nationwide in what he deemed a pageant
of empathy, Judge Feldman instead said a careful analysis of the law
requires deference to the views of the people of Louisiana. This
victory for marriage breaks a streak of more than 20 court rulings against
state marriage laws since the Supreme Court struck down a portion of
the Defense of Marriage Act in 2013. This is not only a win for our
State, but also for our nation. I will continue to work diligently to
pass legislation that protects the values that this great nation was
built upon.
The president must abandon amnesty
attempt
This weekend, the president decided to delay his planned executive
action to unilaterally rewrite immigration laws until after the
November elections. Once again, President Obama is playing political games
to protect his liberal friends by using sleight of hand to temporarily
hide his radical agenda from the American people prior to November's
critical elections. The president needs to abandon his attempt to issue
blanket amnesty by executive order, and instead focus on securing the
border as the House already did. Border security is a critical
national security issue, and President Obama should stop using immigration
as a political tool during election time, and instead work in a
bipartisan way to solve this problem and secure the border. The decision to
delay is a blatant admission that executive amnesty is not just the
wrong policy for the presidents liberal friends, but for the American
people.
Court rules BP acts with gross
negligence in 2010 oil spill
A federal judge last
week ruled that BP acted with "gross negligence" and bears the majority
of responsibility for the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster. Im
encouraged by this
crucial step forward
as we work to secure RESTORE Act funds for
Louisiana families and for Louisianas coastline. It is time for BP to reach
an agreement that allows the families and communities affected to
finally repair the damage that was done because the people of Louisiana
have waited long enough.
It is an honor to represent you in
Congress. For more information please visit my
