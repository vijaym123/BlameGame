Hi there,
As BuzzFeed recently put it, I just want to talk about spending again.
So, with March Madness on everyone's mind, I joined Fox & Friends yesterday morning to launch my second annual Egregious Eight Tournament .

The Egregious Eight has become the yearly culmination of daily efforts such as #PorkChops
and Science of Splurging , designed to keep Congress and the media focused eliminating wasteful and unnecessary spending. And I could use your help!
When you have a moment, visit
http://www.flake.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/egregious-eight
to cast your vote for the wasteful spending items you believe to be more egregious and unnecessary use of your tax dollars. After voting, be sure to come back for Flagrant Four on March 30th and the championship matchup starting April 5th.

Thanks for reading and good luck with your other brackets!
Best,
Jeff
