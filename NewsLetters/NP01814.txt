ICYMI: Rubio Discusses Obama
Administrations Failure
Regarding Middle East On FOX
During
a
FOX News interview Wednesday , Marco
discussed the Obama
Administrations failed policy in
the Middle East. An excerpt of the
interview is below:
Rubio:
Well, I think he has a history
now of miscalculation and misjudgment, or
quite frankly of just refusing to accept
the facts of whats happening.
Theyre always more interested in
the domestic political spin, and getting
credit domestically for something, than
they are in the truth about it. So time
and again, weve seen them fail as
a result of that.
And so it leads us to believe
that theyve been wrong so often
about the true threat of ISIS, about
the status of Al Qaeda, about the
holding up Yemen as an example of
counterterrorism excellence. How can we
now trust that theyre going to
do
for example, a deal with
Iran thats going make sense for
the world and keep us safer? This is an
administration that has a history of
being wrong, and theyre going to
be wrong again when it comes to
Iran.
Watch the full interview
here .
In an op-ed for ForeignPolicy.com, Marco
also urged the administration to stop
enabling Iran. Read the entire op-ed

On The Senate Floor, Rubio, Cotton
Discuss The Need For Increased Defense
Spending In Senate Budget Proposal
In a joint speech on the Senate floor
Tuesday, Marco and Senator Tom Cotton
(R-AR) spoke regarding
an
amendment
they have filed to increase
defense spending in the Senate budget
proposal. The amendment would increase
budget authority for defense to levels
recommended by the bipartisan National
Defense Panel and begin to reverse the
disastrous impact sequestration is having
on our nations military
both goals that Rubio called for in a
September
2014 speech
on rebuilding
Americas national defense. An
excerpt of Rubios speech is
below:
Rubio:
I
promise you, a world where America is
no longer the most capable fighting
force on the planet is a world that is
more chaotic and less safe. So I look
forward to having a debate on this and
I encourage my colleagues to rally
around these numbers.

speech with Cotton is available

Cottons CNN op-ed on the need to

Rubio, Shaheen, Ayotte Introduce
Resolution Urging IRS To Provide
Taxpayers With Printed Materials Needed
To File Their Taxes
Marco, along with Senators Jeanne
Shaheen (D-NH) and Kelly Ayotte (R-NH),
introduced a resolution urging the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to provide
taxpayers in Florida, New Hampshire and
around the country with the printed
materials needed to file their taxes
correctly and on time.
The resolution comes in response to
constituents who have traditionally
relied on printed copies of the
IRS Publication 17, which provides
instructions for most people filing
taxes. The IRS recently ceased broad
distribution of this printed manual
unless requested and paid for by people
preparing their taxes.
On February 11, Marco requested these
printed materials in
a letter to IRS
Commissioner John Koskinen , who
subsequently
turned
down the request .
While filing taxes
electronically has become the norm in
the 21
st
century, we must also
recognize that many Americans still
lack the Internet access and tools to
be able to do so, not to mention the
serious tax fraud that happens
online,
said Rubio . The IRS
shouldnt be making it harder for
taxpayers to comply with the law, and
this resolution makes clear that the
IRS behavior borders on callous
indifference to the unique needs of
many, especially our
seniors.
Also this week, Marco and Congressman
Ted Yoho (R-FL)
introduced
legislation
requiring the Secretary
of the Treasury to implement tougher
security measures in the electronic tax
return filing process in order to prevent
tax refund fraud.
ICYMI: On ObamaCares 5th
Anniversary, Rubio Calls For Its Repeal
&amp; Replacement
On the 5th anniversary of ObamaCare,
Marco called for the repeal and
replacement of the health care law and
proposed a three part plan to put
patients and families back in control of
their health care decisions in
a
FOX News op-ed . Read an expert of the
op-ed below:
Rubio:
Over the last five years,
ObamaCare has revealed the painful
consequences of placing our faith in big
government. Governments ambitions
may be limitless, but its abilities are
not. The free market, when allowed to
function as intended, has no such
limitations. It has an inexhaustible
ability to empower our people and meet
their needs. We need leaders in Congress
and in the White House
who will recognize that
fact.

Agency Updates
Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA):
As of 3/24/15, the VA is
requiring veterans or survivors seeking
benefits to use standardized claims and
appeals forms when applying for
disability compensation, pension,
survivors pension, and dependency
and indemnity compensation (DIC). The
forms are designed to clearly help the
veteran list the symptoms or conditions
for which they are requesting benefits
and provide the information necessary for
the VA to start processing their claims
and appeals. Veterans can either use the
new paper forms or submit claims and
appeals online.
Additionally, as of 3/24/15, veterans
or survivors who need additional time to
gather information and evidence can
submit an Intent to File a Claim for
Compensation or Pension/or Pension or
Survivors Pension and/DIC. These
individual will have up to one year from
the date they submit an intent to file
form to submit their completed claim
form. If they are ultimately approved for
benefits, in most cases, the date at
which the benefits are originally
awarded, or effective date, will be the
start date for payment. So the intent to
file document preserves the
veterans claim date in most cases
but does not speed up the time needed to
actually process the claim or appeal.
