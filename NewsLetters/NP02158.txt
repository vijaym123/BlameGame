David -- Boehner has already wasted your tax dollars to sue President Obama. Now, he&rsquo;s going after Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s private emails! What a waste of time and money.
This is the last straw. This time-sucking, media carnival of an &ldquo;investigation&rdquo; needs to stop.
Will you step up NOW and demand that Boehner back off and focus on real progress? Add your name and demand John Boehner STOP his outrageous investigation based on petty partisan politics &gt;&gt;
If we get the momentum we need, we can put a stop to all this madness. https://action.dccc.org/stop-Boehner-investigation
