Dear Friend,
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is considering allowing
passengers to talk on their cellphones on planes while in flight. It
seems like a bad idea to me and I have concerns, but as your
representative in Congress I want to hear from you. Fill out the survey
below to let me know whether you want cell phone calls allowed on
planes.
Do you think passengers should be allowed to talk on the phone in
flight?
Yes
No
Not sure

As always, it is an honor to represent you in the U.S. Congress. To
stay in touch, please connect with me on Twitter @RepSwalwell

Eric Swalwell
