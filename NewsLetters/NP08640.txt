Re-Intervention into Iraq Would Be A Terrible Mistake
Dear Friend,
U.S. military re-intervention into Iraq, whether by supplying troops,
weapons, or support by air or sea, would be a terrible mistake -
exacerbating the conflict and drawing us back into a war that has
already cost our nation trillions of dollars and thousands of precious
lives. We have given Iraq one long, expensive chance, and that's
enough. The jihadist insurgency sweeping that nation is the result of a
1,400-year religious conflict between Sunni and Shiite Muslims - and
unless we are prepared to bankrupt ourselves spending another 1,400
years policing them, we need to stay out.
That was my message to President Obama, Secretary of State Kerry, and
Secretary of Defense Hagel on Friday morning as reports intensified
that the Administration is considering military action to prop up the
government of Iraq in the face of growing jihadist insurgency.
It's clear that the corrupt and despotic government of Prime Minister
Nouri al-Maliki has no significant support left in most of the Iraqi
population.
Moreover, high-ranking government and military officials in Iraq are
describing their own army as corrupt, cowardly, and worthless -
dropping their guns to cut and run in the face of the jihadists. They
are leaving untold amounts of American weaponry for the radicals to
pick up and add to the U.S. arms that have already fallen into their
hands. Clearly, supplying more weapons to Iraq will be
counter-productive, strengthening the jihadists with more access to
weapons and firepower.
At this critical point, it is the leaders and people of Iraq who must
step forward and reclaim their nation. America cannot do it for them,
and we should not once again attempt to try.
I will keep you posted as events develop. As always, I welcome your
advice and counsel on this and all important matters facing our great
nation.
Sincerely,

Rural Vets Shouldn't Have to Wait for Care
I spoke with veterans about the often long distances vets must travel
in order to receive care at the nearest VA facility at two public
forums last week in Brainerd and Little Falls. Watch Lakeland TV's
coverage here
.
As veterans who have attended our veterans round tables in Duluth,
Brainerd, and Little Falls have attested, access to medical care close
to home is a huge issue for vets in our heavily rural Eighth District,
who are often required to travel many hours - and wait many weeks for
an appointment in a VA facility - for care they could quickly be
receiving at a local hospital or clinic. Local care saves travel time
for vets, as well as money for mileage that would otherwise be
reimbursed by taxpayers.
So in another important step to change the way the Department of
Veterans Affairs delivers service to our nation's heroes, the House
last week unanimously passed the bipartisan Veterans Access to Care Act
(H.R.4810) to require the VA to provide outside care to veterans who
(1) live more than 40 miles away from the nearest VA clinic, or (2)
have waited more than two weeks for an appointment. This bill is
similar to the bipartisan HEALTHY Vets Act (H.R.635), which I
cosponsored, to allow veterans who live far away from VA facilities to
get the care they need directly from local medical clinics.
The Senate has already passed this 40 miles-two weeks provision as part
of a larger VA reform bill, which the House is expected to take it up
later this week. I will keep you posted as we meld the two measures
into one, and get it to the President's desk for signature. This change
will constitute an enormous improvement in delivery of medical services
to veterans across rural Minnesota and our entire nation.

Make It In America Wins Jobs - and Awards
I joined House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (MD) and other Members of
Congress to introduce my new Presidential Make It In America Awards
bill, part of the Make It In America jobs package. Click the photo
above to watch a clip of our conference.
It's no secret our nation has lost more than eight million good,
middle-class manufacturing jobs over the past three decades, and some
51,000 manufacturing plants over just the past ten years. We need a
common sense, bipartisan solution.
To grow jobs in America, we need to make things in America - starting
with legislation a number of my colleagues and I introduced last week
to reform our tax, trade, regulatory, and investment policies to
encourage companies to start, grow, innovate, and provide world-class
jobs and products right here in America. At our news conference, I
announced the Presidential Make It In America Awards Act (H.R.4825),
which establishes three prestigious new Presidential awards to be made
annually under the auspices of the Secretary of Commerce:
.
The Presidential Reshoring Award will honor the best example
of a company that returns jobs to the United States from abroad.
.
The Presidential Invest in America Award will honor the best
example of a major new Make it in America investment by a company to
create new jobs.
.
And the Presidential Foreign Direct Investment Award will
honor the best example of a foreign investor establishing or expanding
a business venture that creates new American jobs here in the United
States.
It's been my pleasure to have so far visited more than 40 Make It In
America companies right here in Minnesota's 8th District - meeting with
workers, managers, and owners to learn about their operations and get
their input as to how we can encourage jobs and economic development
here at home. The awards in my bill stem in part from those visits, and
I hope to see many of our homegrown Minnesota companies apply for those
awards once this legislation becomes law.

Jobs In - Carp Out - President Signs Bipartisan WRRDA Bill
I was honored to be at the White House last week as President Obama
signed the bipartisan landmark Water Resources Reform and Development
Act, which includes my amendments to protect our northern Minnesota
waters and sport fishing industry from invasive Asian carp - and get
Great Lakes shipping and jobs back up to 100 percent capacity.
Specifically, the amendments I included in the original House bill, and
shepherded through the House-Senate conference committee to final
approval, accomplish the following:
.
By closing the St. Anthony Lock and Dam in Minneapolis, we
will stop invasive carp from moving into the upper Mississippi
watershed - into the Crow Wing, Pine, and Rum Rivers - into Gull, White
Fish, and Mille Lacs Lakes, as well as into other important lakes
including Leech, Cass, and Winnie - threatening our multi-billion
dollar sport fishing and tourism industry.
.
By adding animals like the zebra mussel to the federal
definition of "invasive species" (which heretofore included only plant
life) we provide the Army Corps of Engineers with resources and
authority for more research and abatement.
.
And by stopping raids on the Harbor Trust Fund for other
than the intended purpose of critical maintenance of our harbors and
waterways - we take a giant step toward eliminating a 10-year dredging
backlog that's costing an estimated $3 billion a year in lost jobs and
commerce due to lack of funds. Now we can start returning Duluth Harbor
and Great Lakes ships to 100% operating capacity, creating more jobs by
moving more iron ore, coal, grain and manufactured goods up the Great
Lakes to national and international destinations.
We got this done for Minnesota and the nation, and I'm proud of it.

invasive species and protecting our waterways here.

TIGER Grants - And Good Local Jobs - Take A Hit in the House
TIGER grants have always constituted common sense, bipartisan public
policy. They create good jobs immediately - and lay the foundation for
even more jobs and investment through state and local public and
private matching funds. Click the image above to watch me speak in
support of the TIGER grant program.
Having wasted more than $60 billion on failed infrastructure projects
in Iraq and Afghanistan, it's unconscionable to even be considering
draconian cuts to projects here at home that create good jobs, repair
roads and bridges, improve airports and harbors, clean up the
environment and improve the quality of life for millions of Americans.
Yet that's exactly what House Republicans did last week, voting to cut
Transportation Investment Generating Economic Opportunity (TIGER)
grants by 80% as part of the Transportation, Housing and Urban
Development (T-HUD) appropriations bill.
TIGER grants create immediate, good-paying, middle-class jobs in
communities that compete on the merits of their proposed projects. And
they lay the foundation for more jobs by drawing, on average, $2 in
local or private investment for every dollar the federal government
contributes. TIGER grants are flexible in ways other federal grants are
not, helping local communities solve local problems creatively and
efficiently.
Duluth, for example, recently secured a $10 million TIGER grant to
dredge and improve access to the harbor, restore an abandoned pier and
do environmental clean-up. Across our very rural 8th Congressional
District, TIGER grants are widely used to mark and regulate dangerous
highway and rail crossings, helping save lives and prevent injuries.
As I've noted before, Minnesota receives only about 65 cents back for
every tax dollar we send to the federal government, while some states
get back $4 and $5 dollars and more. That's one reason I'm working so
hard to help our local communities secure money for worthy projects
that create jobs, solve problems and improve our quality of life. We're
going to fight hard to restore TIGER grant funds as this bill moves on
to the Senate. Watch me speak on the Floor in support of TIGER programs
here

Refinance Your Student Loan? It Just Makes Sense
The concept's simple. You can refinance a home loan, a car loan, or a
personal loan, and you should be able to refinance a college loan as
well. So I'm working hard to pass bipartisan legislation that would
allow half a million Minnesotans - and some 25 million people across
our nation - to refinance their old high-interest federal student loans
at today's lower rates. Our bill - the Bank on Students Emergency Loan
Refinancing Act (H.R.4582) - would impose a modest tax on the nation's
wealthiest individuals in order to pay the difference back to the
Treasury.
Make no mistake. Student loan debt is a looming financial crisis of
major portion for our nation. Minnesota college students now graduate
with America's fourth highest student debt - more than $30,000 on
average. Financial experts agree that America's $1.3 trillion in
student loan burden (which has doubled since 2007) is beginning to
choke economic growth as young people find themselves unable to buy
homes, start families, make major purchases, or begin planning for
retirement.
Unfortunately, Senate Republicans last week decided to protect the rich
from higher taxes by blocking an identical bill introduced by Senator
Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. She's vowed to keep fighting and so
have I.

Our Week in Pictures
At my recent veterans round table in Brainerd, I presented Mr. Rodney
Sullivan with two long-awaited medals for his service in the Vietnam
War. I worked with the Hubbard County Veterans Service Office and Navy
Personnel Command to correct Mr. Sullivan's paperwork and ensure he
received the recognition he deserves. Watch Lakeland TV's coverage here
.
I was pleased to join Senator Al Franken and former Labor Secretary to
President Bill Clinton, Robert Reich, for a recent conversation about
income inequality hosted by our own Senator Amy Klobuchar. We discussed
how the massive consolidation of wealth by a select few has crippling
effects on the success of our middle-class workforce and on our
nation's recovering economy.
Of the 121 bills from the current Congress that President Obama has
signed into law, I'm proud to say that several have my name on them.
That includes the bipartisan Small Airplane Revitalization Act, which
streamlines regulations for manufacturers of small aircraft - such as
Cirrus Aircraft of Duluth - freeing them up to hire more people and
push the limits of innovation in airplane technology. So I was honored
last week when Pete Bunce, CEO and President of the General Aviation
Manufacturers Association, presented me with a framed copy of our bill,
signed by the President.
Bread for the World is a non-profit organization striving to end hunger
in our time, and as a former recipient of their "Distinguished Service
Award," I was so proud to speak at their reception last week (here I am
with Betty Anne Donnelly, former Bread for the World board member), and
honor their team for their efforts to help hungry and poor people in
the U.S. and around the world.

Coming Up in Washington
This week, the House will consider two bills of which I'm a cosponsor:
.
H.R.3682 - To name the Mankato, MN, VA clinic the Lyle C.
Pearson Community Based Outpatient Clinic after Lyle Pearson, a WII
prisoner of war who was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air
Medal with Clusters, and Purple Heart for his military service.
.
H.R.43 - To rename the post office in Cold Spring, MN, the
Officer Tommy Decker Memorial Post Office. Tommy Decker served for six
years in the police department in Cold Spring, receiving six
commendations and letters of appreciation. He was shot and killed in
the line of duty on November 29th, 2012.

Finally...
Announcing the Native American Emerging Leaders Program!
Our first Native American Emerging Leaders Intern, Syngen Kanassatega
of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, works at his desk in our Washington
D.C. office.
Welcome to our first Native American Emerging Leaders Intern, Syngen
Kanassatega, from the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe. Syngen is a law
student at the University of New Mexico, and throughout the summer
he'll be helping our legislative team with legal research, with a
particular focus on tribal policy issues.
As I represent the Leech Lake, Bois Forte, Mille Lacs, Fond du Lac, and
Grand Portage Bands, I established our Native American Emerging Leaders
Internship Program to prepare the next generation of Native American
leaders to take their place in community service, policy development,
and public service careers, by exposing interns to the processes by
which national policies are developed and implemented on Capitol Hill
and in the federal government. Following the internship, these young
leaders will return to their communities better informed about how
government works, more able to identify the resources available to help
their communities, and more aware of how they can influence the public
policymaking process. It is my hope with this program to better
represent Indian Country in Congress.
These internships come with a small monthly stipend to help accommodate
living in D.C. for the summer. Native American students from
Minnesota's Eighth District should contact their tribal leader for a
recommendation.

Re-Intervention
into
Iraq
Would
Be
A
Terrible
Mistake
Dear
Friend,
U.S.
military
re-intervention
into
Iraq,
whether
by
supplying
troops,
weapons,
or
support
by
air
or
sea,
would
be
a
terrible
mistake
&#8211;
exacerbating
the
conflict
and
drawing
us
back
into
a
war
that
has
already
cost
our
nation
trillions
of
dollars
and
thousands
of
precious
lives.
We
have
given
Iraq
one
long,
expensive
chance,
and
that's
enough.
The
jihadist
insurgency
sweeping
that
nation
is
the
result
of
a
1,400-year
religious
conflict
between
Sunni
and
Shiite
Muslims
-
and
unless
we
are
prepared
to
bankrupt
ourselves
spending
another
1,400
years
policing
them,
we
need
to
stay
out.
That
was
my
message
to
President
Obama,
Secretary
of
State
Kerry,
and
Secretary
of
Defense
Hagel
on
Friday
morning
as
reports
intensified
that
the
Administration
is
considering
military
action
to
prop
up
the
government
of
Iraq
in
the
face
of
growing
jihadist
insurgency.
It&#8217;s
clear
that
the
corrupt
and
despotic
government
of
Prime
Minister
Nouri
al-Maliki
has
no
significant
support
left
in
most
of
the
Iraqi
population.
Moreover,
high-ranking
government
and
military
officials
in
Iraq
are
describing
their
own
army
as
corrupt,
cowardly,
and
worthless
&#8211;
dropping
their
guns
to
cut
and
run
in
the
face
of
the
jihadists.
They
are
leaving
untold
amounts
of
American
weaponry
for
the
radicals
to
pick
up
and
add
to
the
U.S.
arms
that
have
already
fallen
into
their
hands.
Clearly,
supplying
more
weapons
to
Iraq
will
be
counter-productive ,
strengthening
the
jihadists
with
more
access
to
weapons
and
firepower.
At
this
critical
point,
it
is
the
leaders
and
people
of
Iraq
who
must
step
forward
and
reclaim
their
nation.
America
cannot
do
it
for
them,
and
we
should
not
once
again
attempt
to
try .
I
will
keep
you
posted
as
events
develop.
As
always,
I
welcome
your
advice
and
counsel
on
this
and
all
important
matters
facing
our
great
nation.
Sincerely,
Rural
Vets
Shouldn't
Have
to
Wait
for
Care
I
spoke
with
veterans
about
the
often
long
distances
vets
must
travel
in
order
to
receive
care
at
the
nearest
VA
facility at
two
public
forums
last
week
in
Brainerd
and
Little
Falls.
Watch
Lakeland
TV's
coverage
here .
As
veterans
who
have
attended
our
veterans
round
tables
in
Duluth,
Brainerd,
and
Little
Falls
have
attested,
access
to
medical
care
close
to
home
is
a
huge
issue
for
vets
in
our
heavily
rural
Eighth
District ,
who
are
often
required
to
travel
many
hours
&#8211;
and
wait
many
weeks
for
an
appointment
in
a
VA
facility
-
for
care
they
could
quickly
be
receiving
at
a
local
hospital
or
clinic.
Local
care
saves
travel
time
for
vets,
as
well
as
money
for
mileage
that
would
otherwise
be
reimbursed
by
taxpayers .
So
in
another
important
step
to
change
the
way
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
delivers
service
to
our
nation&#8217;s
heroes,
the
House
last
week
unanimously
passed
the
bipartisan
Veterans
Access
to
Care
Act
(H.R.4810)
to
require
the
VA
to
provide
outside
care
to
veterans
who
(1)
live
more
than
40
miles
away
from
the
nearest
VA
clinic,
or
(2)
have
waited
more
than
two
weeks
for
an
appointment.
This
bill
is
similar
to
the
bipartisan
HEALTHY Vets
Act
(H.R.635),
which
I
cosponsored,
to
allow
veterans
who
live
far
away
from
VA
facilities
to
get
the
care
they
need
directly
from
local
medical
clinics.
The
Senate
has
already
passed
this
40
miles-two
weeks
provision
as
part
of
a
larger
VA
reform
bill,
which
the
House
is
expected
to
take
it
up
later
this
week.
I
will
keep
you
posted
as
we
meld
the
two
measures
into
one,
and
get
it
to
the
President&#8217;s
desk
for
signature.
This
change
will
constitute
an
enormous
improvement
in
delivery
of
medical
services
to
veterans
across
rural
Minnesota
and
our
entire
nation.

and
some
51,000
manufacturing

We

To
grow

we
need
to
make
things

&#8211;
starting
with
legislation a
number
of
my
colleagues
and
I
introduced
last

to
reform
our
tax,

investment
policies
to
encourage
companies
to
start,
grow,
innovate,
and
provide
world-class
jobs
and

At
our
news

I
announced
the
Presidential
Make

Awards
Act
(H.R.4825),
which establishes
three
prestigious
new
Presidential
awards
to
be
made
annually
under
the
auspices
of
the
Secretary
of
Commerce:
&#8226;
The
Presidential
Reshoring
Award
will
honor
the
best
example
of
a
company
that
returns
jobs
to
the
United
States
from
abroad.
&#8226;
The
Presidential
Invest
in
America
Award
will
honor
the
best
example
of
a
major
new
Make
it
in
America
investment
by
a
company
to
create
new
jobs.
&#8226;
And
the
Presidential
Foreign
Direct
Investment
Award
will
honor
the
best
example
of
a
foreign
investor
establishing
or
expanding
a
business
venture
that
creates
new
American
jobs
here
in
the
United
States.
It&#8217;s
been
my
pleasure
to
have
so
far
visited
more
than
40
Make

learn
about
their
operations
and
get
their
input
as
to
how
we
can
encourage
jobs
and
economic
development
here
at
home.
The
awards
in
my
bill
stem
in
part
from
those
visits,
and
I
hope
to
see
many
of
our
homegrown

apply
for
those
awards
once
this
legislation
becomes

&#8211;
threatening

&#8226;
By

bipartisan
public
policy.
They
create
good
jobs
immediately
-
and
lay
the
foundation
for
even
more
jobs
and
investment
through
state
and
local
public
and
private
matching
funds.

speak
in
support
of
the
TIGER
grant
program.
Having
wasted
more
than
$60
billion
on
failed
infrastructure
projects
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan,
it&#8217;s
unconscionable
to
even
be
considering
draconian
cuts
to
projects
here
at
home
that
create
good
jobs,
repair
roads
and
bridges,
improve
airports
and
harbors,
clean
up
the
environment
and
improve
the
quality
of
life
for
millions
of
Americans.
Yet
that&#8217;s
exactly
what
House
Republicans
did
last
week,
voting
to
cut
Transportation
Investment
Generating
Economic
Opportunity
(TIGER)
grants
by
80%
as
part
of
the
Transportation,
Housing
and
Urban
Development
(T-HUD)
appropriations
bill.
TIGER
grants
create
immediate,
good-paying,
middle-class
jobs
in
communities
that
compete
on
the
merits
of
their
proposed
projects.
And
they
lay
the
foundation
for
more
jobs
by
drawing,
on
average,
$2
in
local
or
private
investment
for
every
dollar
the
federal
government
contributes.
TIGER
grants
are
flexible
in
ways
other
federal
grants
are
not,
helping
local
communities
solve
local
problems
creatively
and
efficiently.
Duluth,
for
example,
recently
secured
a
$10
million
TIGER
grant
to
dredge
and
improve
access
to
the
harbor,
restore
an
abandoned
pier
and
do
environmental
clean-up .
Across
our
very
rural
8th
Congressional
District,
TIGER
grants
are
widely
used
to
mark
and
regulate
dangerous
highway
and
rail
crossings ,
helping
save
lives
and
prevent
injuries.
As
I&#8217;ve
noted
before,
Minnesota
receives
only
about
65
cents
back
for
every
tax
dollar
we
send
to
the
federal
government,
while
some
states
get
back
$4
and
$5
dollars
and
more.
That&#8217;s
one
reason
I&#8217;m
working
so
hard
to
help
our
local
communities
secure
money
for
worthy
projects
that
create
jobs,
solve
problems
and
improve
our
quality
of
life.
We&#8217;re
going
to
fight
hard
to
restore
TIGER
grant
funds
as
this
bill
moves
on
to
the
Senate.
Watch
me
speak
on
the
Floor
in
support
of
TIGER
programs

Refinance
Your
Student
Loan?
It
Just
Makes
Sense
The
concept&#8217;s
simple.
You
can
refinance
a
home
loan,
a
car
loan,
or
a
personal
loan,
and
you
should
be
able
to
refinance
a
college
loan
as
well.
So
I&#8217;m
working
hard
to
pass
bipartisan
legislation
that
would
allow
half
a
million
Minnesotans
&#8211;
and
some
25
million
people
across
our
nation
&#8211;
to
refinance
their
old
high-interest
federal
student
loans
at
today&#8217;s
lower
rates .
Our
bill
&#8211;
the
Bank
on
Students
Emergency
Loan
Refinancing
Act
(H.R.4582)
&#8211;
would
impose
a
modest
tax
on
the
nation&#8217;s
wealthiest
individuals
in
order
to
pay
the
difference
back
to
the
Treasury.
Make
no
mistake.
Student
loan
debt
is
a
looming
financial
crisis
of
major
portion
for
our
nation.
Minnesota
college
students
now
graduate
with
America&#8217;s
fourth
highest
student
debt
&#8211;
more
than
$30,000
on
average.
Financial
experts
agree
that
America&#8217;s
$1.3
trillion
in
student
loan
burden
(which
has
doubled
since
2007)
is
beginning
to
choke
economic
growth
as
young
people
find
themselves
unable
to
buy
homes,
start
families,
make
major
purchases,
or
begin
planning
for
retirement.
Unfortunately,
Senate
Republicans
last
week
decided
to
protect
the
rich
from
higher
taxes
by
blocking
an
identical
bill
introduced
by
Senator
Elizabeth
Warren
of
Massachusetts.
She&#8217;s
vowed
to
keep
fighting
and
so
have
I.
Our
Week
in
Pictures
At
my
recent
veterans
round
table
in
Brainerd,
I
presented
Mr.
Rodney
Sullivan
with
two
long-awaited
medals for
his
service
in
the
Vietnam
War .
I
worked
with
the
Hubbard
County
Veterans
Service
Office
and
Navy
Personnel
Command
to
correct
Mr.
Sullivan's
paperwork
and
ensure
he received
the
recognition
he
deserves.
Watch
Lakeland
TV's
coverage
here .
I
was
pleased
to
join
Senator
Al
Franken
and
former
Labor
Secretary
to
President
Bill
Clinton,
Robert
Reich ,
for
a
recent
conversation about
income
inequality
hosted
by
our
own
Senator
Amy
Klobuchar.
We
discussed
how
the
massive
consolidation
of
wealth
by
a
select
few
has
crippling
effects
on
the
success
of
our
middle-class
workforce
and
on
our
nation's
recovering
economy.
Of
the
121
bills
from
the
current
Congress
that
President
Obama
has
signed
into
law,
I'm
proud
to
say
that
several
have
my
name
on
them.
That
includes
the
bipartisan
Small
Airplane
Revitalization
Act ,
which
streamlines
regulations
for
manufacturers
of
small
aircraft
-
such
as
Cirrus
Aircraft
of
Duluth
-
freeing
them
up
to
hire
more
people
and
push
the
limits
of
innovation
in
airplane
technology.
So
I
was
honored
last
week
when
Pete
Bunce,
CEO
and
President
of
the
General
Aviation
Manufacturers
Association,
presented
me
with
a
framed
copy
of
our
bill,
signed
by
the
President.
Bread
for
the
World
is
a
non-profit
organization
striving
to
end
hunger
in
our
time,
and
as
a
former
recipient
of
their "Distinguished
Service
Award," I
was
so
proud
to
speak
at
their
reception
last
week
(here
I
am
with
Betty
Anne
Donnelly,
former
Bread
for
the
World
board
member),
and
honor
their
team for
their
efforts
to
help
hungry
and
poor
people
in
the
U.S.
and
around
the
world.
Coming
Up
in
Washington
This
week,
the
House
will
consider
two
bills
of
which
I'm
a
cosponsor:
&#8226;
H.R.3682
-
To
name the
Mankato,
MN,
VA
clinic
the
Lyle
C.
Pearson
Community
Based
Outpatient
Clinic
after
Lyle
Pearson,
a
WII
prisoner
of
war
who
was
awarded
the
Distinguished
Flying
Cross,
the
Air
Medal
with
Clusters,
and
Purple
Heart
for
his
military
service.
&#8226;
H.R.43
-
To
rename
the
post
office
in
Cold
Spring,
MN,
the
Officer
Tommy
Decker
Memorial
Post
Office.
Tommy
Decker
served
for
six
years
in
the
police
department
in
Cold
Spring,
receiving
six
commendations
and
letters
of
appreciation. He
was
shot
and
killed
in
the
line
of
duty
on
November
29th,
2012.
Finally ...
Announcing
the
Native
American
Emerging
Leaders
Program!
Our
first
Native
American
Emerging
Leaders
Intern,
Syngen
Kanassatega
of
the
Mille
Lacs
Band
of
Ojibwe,
works
at
his
desk
in
our
Washington
D.C.
office.
Welcome
to
our
first
Native
American
Emerging
Leaders
Intern ,
Syngen
Kanassatega ,
from
the
Mille
Lacs
Band
of
Ojibwe.
Syngen
is
a
law
student
at
the
University
of
New
Mexico,
and
throughout
the
summer
he'll
be
helping
our
legislative
team with
legal
research,
with
a
particular
focus
on
tribal
policy
issues .
As
I
represent
the
Leech
Lake,
Bois
Forte,
Mille
Lacs,
Fond
du
Lac,
and
Grand
Portage
Bands ,
I
established
our
Native
American
Emerging
Leaders
Internship
Program
to
prepare
the
next
generation
of
Native
American
leaders
to
take
their
place
in
community
service,
policy
development,
and
public
service
careers,
by
exposing
interns
to
the
processes
by
which
national
policies
are
developed
and
implemented
on
Capitol
Hill
and
in
the
federal
government.
Following
the
internship,
these
young
leaders
will
return
to
their
communities
better
informed
about
how
government
works, more
able
to
identify
the
resources
available
to
help
their
communities,
and
more
aware
of
how
they
can
influence
the
public
policymaking
process.
It
is
my
hope
with
this
program
to
better
represent
Indian
Country
in
Congress.
These
internships
come
with
a
small
monthly
stipend
to
help
accommodate
living
in
D.C.
for
the
summer.
Native
American
students
from
Minnesota's
Eighth
District
should
contact
their
tribal
leader
for
a
recommendation.
