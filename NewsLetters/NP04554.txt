Pictured above: Scott's favorite veteran and Iwo Jima Marine, his father, Ike Rigell, and a Montford Point Marine he greatly respected, Jimmy Hargrove.
Quoteworthy:
"The willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportional to how they perceive veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by our nation."
-George Washington
