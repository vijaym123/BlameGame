&ldquo;The FCC, on Tuesday afternoon, extended the first-round deadline to file comments [on net neutrality]
-- ComputerWorld, 7/15/14
Dear Friend, It&rsquo;s working
-- thanks to our efforts, the FCC has extended its comment period for its proposed net neutrality rule change. So far, net neutrality is the second-most commented-on issue in the FCC&rsquo;s history.
This is how democracy is supposed to work.
Our nationwide effort proves that when we stand up and speak with one voice, Washington can&rsquo;t ignore us
-- and the big cable conglomerates can&rsquo;t overpower us. I will keep fighting to preserve net neutrality. If you can, please give $5 or more to help sustain my efforts.

The Internet is an economic engine that has created hundreds of thousands of jobs, and has had a profoundly positive impact on Massachusetts&rsquo; innovation economy. That&rsquo;s why protecting net neutrality is a battle I&rsquo;ve been waging for years. I recognized a long time ago that the potential existed for big corporations to undermine the free and open nature of the Internet. And I&rsquo;ve never backed down from their threats to end net neutrality. We&rsquo;ve made a lot of progress in the fight to preserve net neutrality -- help keep our grassroots network growing by making a $5 contribution.
I&rsquo;ve already proposed the reclassification of broadband as a public utility, so that big corporations can never again threaten a free, open, and fair Internet. We&rsquo;re close to victory on this -- let&rsquo;s finish what we&rsquo;ve started.
Thank you.
