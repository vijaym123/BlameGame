The 2015 Congressional Baseball Game for Charity was a hit!
For one night out of the year, Republicans and Democrats take their age-old rivalry from the halls of Congress to the baseball diamond to raise money for a worthy cause. While the Grand Ole Party did not ultimately take home the trophy, the real winners are the children who will benefit from the funds raised from this years game.
Representing Georgias 11th District and wearing the colors of Kennesaw State University was a proud moment for me, and it is something that I will never forget. Thank you for entrusting me to serve as your representative here in our nations Capital.

Prescription for Obamacare? Patient-Centered Health Care Reforms
Georgia businesses and families deserve quality, patient-centered health care that does not break the bank. Under Obamacare, health insurance premiums have nearly doubled, leaving Georgians with less disposable income and limited ability to choose the insurance plan that best suits their needs.
It's time to put you - the patient first. To lower the cost of health care and restore free market solutions, I've co-sponsored and voted on the following bills:
On January 8th, 2015, with my support, the House passed
H.R. 30 - Save American Workers Act of 2015 , which would change the 30-hour threshold for classification as a full-time employee for purposes of the employer mandate in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and replace it with 40 hours.
On January 22nd, 2015, with my support, the House passed
H.R. 7 - No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2015.
On February 3rd, 2015, with my cosponsor, the House passed
H.R. 596 FULL REPEAL OF OBAMACARE
- To repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and health care-related provisions in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, and for other purposes (Repeal of Obamacare).
On March 25th, 2015, with my support, the House passed
H.Con.Res. 27 , establishing the budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2016 and setting forth appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2017 through 2025. (Republican budget that would repeal Obamacare and pay off the national debt in 10 years).
In addition to the legislation that has already passed the House, I am cosponsoring the following legislation:
H.R. 160
-
Protect Medical Innovation Act of 2015, which would remove the excise tax on medical devices.
H.R. 928
-
To repeal the annual fee on health insurance providers enacted by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
H.R. 1190
