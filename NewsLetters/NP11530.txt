The most important guest of my
tele-townhall
I host my tele-townhall meeting on the 2nd Wednesday of each month,
and while it is a great opportunity for me to share my perspective on
what is happening in Washington, the feedback, insight and perspective I
receive from Utahns is what matters most.
Truly the most
important person in the townhall is you!
I look forward to answering
your questions on a wide-range of issues.
We have been
holding this open dialogue each month for over a year now, and your input
has been crucial as I have developed a series of policies that are part
of what I call the conservative reform agenda.
The momentum for
these ideas is continuing to build across the country.
I
recently
delivered a speech at CPAC
to challenge those
in attendance to become part of this reform movement in order improve
and strengthen our nation.
I would like to extend that challenge
to you and invite you to add your best ideas to
this
growing list of reform proposals .
On Wednesday night, March
12th, at 7:00 p.m. MT, I hope you will join my tele-townhall and
share your thoughts on how we can improve upward mobility among the poor,
increase opportunity and security for hardworking Americans, as well
as eliminate favoritism and cronyism.
As always, you are the most
important guest in these events.
Please join me and invite your
friends and family to do the same.
