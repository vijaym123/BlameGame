Friends,
On Memorial
Day, I marched in memory of our fallen troops with the Combat Veterans
Motorcycle Association, members of our community, and Dr. Ben Carson.
After much planning, Memorial Day weekend in Myrtle Beach was a safe
holiday. I commmend Chief Gall, our local leaders, the Combat Veterans
Motorcycle Association Myrtle Beach Chapter, and all of the Bikefest
participants on two safe, successful events.
Here are some pictures from the Memorial Day
March in Myrtle Beach :
President's Actions Reviewed by Courts
Last week, the Obama Administration
attempted to defend its unilateral changes to our nation's laws before
federal judges in Texas and Washington, D.C.
On
Tuesday, a federal appeals court sided with Texas and against the
Administration on the President's executive action to
delay deportations for millions of
illegal immigrants. Then,
on
Thursday,
the Administration urged a federal district court to dismiss the
House's case against President Obama over his unconstitutional changes to
Obamacare.
U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer questioned the Administration's
argument against standing. While she did not issue her ruling, the
House's legal team made a sound argument for standing and I remain
optimistic about the outcome.
This lawsuit is based
off the STOP Resolution I introduced in 2013.
After my
resolution gained support from a majority of the Republican majority, House
leadership decided to file a case and listed one of the claims in the
STOP Resolution.
Prior to the court hearing, I discussed the
importance of the House's lawsuit and the impact it could have on the
balance of power within the federal government with
The Hill . Click
