Dear Friend,
I want to take this opportunity to wish you and your family a happy
holiday season and a joyful new year!
When I was elected as your Representative, I promised to listen to you
at home in the East Bay and work for you in Washington.
This past
weekend, I helped out at Morning Glory Farm Christmas Trees in Dublin
as part of my "In Your Shoes" program, where I perform a different job
each month to connect with employers, employees, and community members
alike. Watch the video of my "In Your Shoes" to learn more about my
experience:

It is an honor to represent you in the U.S. Congress.
Please do not

at 925-460-5100 or 510-370-3322.
For questions or comments regarding
federal legislation, contact my Washington, DC office at 202-225-5065.
