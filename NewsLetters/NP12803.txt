Congressman Chuck Fleischmann Responds To The State Of The Union
Address
In what can easily be described as the President's most
egregious speech to date, President Obama delivered yet another
divisive, partisan lecture in which he vowed to bypass both the
Constitution and the American people through the use of executive
orders. This is a grave abuse of power. Our founders, through the
Constitution, expressly vested the duly elected Members of the House
and Senate with the power to legislate.
The American people want a freer economic system that will
create desperately needed jobs. What we need is a system that empowers
the individual, not more failed big government policies. The greatness
of our nation does not come from Washington; it comes from the people
in towns like Athens, Chattanooga and Oak Ridge. Republicans are
working to advance plans that place trust in the people and restore the
freedom needed to achieve the American dream.
The House has already passed 30 jobs bills that are still
awaiting Senate approval. The President called for this to be a year of
action, and I am hopeful that he and Senate Democrats will finally join
House Republicans in taking the 'actions' needed to allow the greatness
of the American people to shine.

Responds
To
The
State
Of
The
Union
Address
In
what
can
easily
be
described
as
the
President&#8217;s
most
egregious
speech
to
date,
President
Obama
delivered
yet
another
divisive,
partisan
lecture
in
which
he
vowed
to
bypass
both
the
Constitution
and
the
American
people
through
the
use
of
executive
orders.
This
is
a
grave
abuse
of
power.
Our
founders,
through
the
Constitution,
expressly
vested
the
duly
elected
Members
of
the
House
and
Senate
with
the
power
to
legislate.
The
American
people
want
a
freer
economic
system
that
will
create
desperately
needed
jobs.
What
we
need
is
a
system
that
empowers
the
individual,
not
more
failed
big
government
policies.
The
greatness
of
our
nation
does
not
come
from
Washington;
it
comes
from
the
people
in
towns
like
Athens,
Chattanooga
and
Oak
Ridge.
Republicans
are
working
to
advance
plans
that
place
trust
in
the
people
and
restore
the
freedom
needed
to
achieve
the
American
dream.
The
House
has
already
passed
30
jobs
bills
that
are
still
awaiting
Senate
approval.
The
President
called
for
this
to
be
a
year
of
action,
and
I
am
hopeful
that
he
and
Senate
Democrats
will
finally
join
House
Republicans
in
taking
the
&#8216;actions&#8217;
needed
to
allow
the
greatness
of
the
American
people
to
shine.
