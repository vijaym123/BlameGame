Dear Friends,
Did you know that two thirds of Alzheimer's patients are women and that more than 60 percent of caregivers for their aging parents or loved ones are women? That is why Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease is of particular concern for women.
If you are interested in basic information about Alzheimer&rsquo;s, have questions about the latest research, or would like to hear about treatment options, I invite you to join me for a panel discussion on Monday, March 30, 2015, 12-1:30 pm at the San Mateo Council Chambers.
I will be joined by:
Cynthia Ortiz Guzman, a nurse diagnosed with younger-onset
Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease,
Dr. Michael Greicius, Medical Director at Stanford&rsquo;s Center for Memory Disorders,
Dr. Elizabeth Landsverk, Medical Director of ElderConsult, and
Ruth Gay, Director of Public Policy and Advocacy at the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association.
For more information on the panelists, please visit my
website .
We will discuss any questions you may have, including the early signs of Alzheimer&rsquo;s, the distinction between the disease and everyday forgetfulness, how it&rsquo;s diagnosed, what treatments are available, and the latest on hopes for a cure.
