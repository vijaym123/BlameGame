Dear Friend,
This week, I spoke out against the Federal Drug Czar's outdated and
racially-charged policies when it comes to marijuana and I also spoke
out against Governor Haslam's plan to raid the HOPE Scholarship surplus
fund. In addition, I attended a meeting with President Obama and was
selected to be the lead Democrat on the influential House Judiciary
Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice. Keep reading to

Building a Healthier Memphis
Among the many benefits of the Affordable Care Act-also known as
Obamacare-is free preventive care for services like mammograms that can
detect breast cancer. A New York Times story
even noted that Memphis is "the deadliest
major American city for African-American women with breast cancer."
This racial disparity in breast cancer outcomes is deplorable, but we
can take steps to reduce it. A primary reason for the high mortality
rate is late diagnosis, when the disease is harder to treat and has
much lower survival rates. Next Thursday morning at Church Health
Center Wellness, I will launch my "Building a Healthier Memphis"
wellness event series by hosting an expert panel discussion and
education session about the source of this disparity and what we can do
to address it and improve outcomes for victims of breast cancer in our
city. More details about the event, which begins at 10am, are available
here
. If you plan on attending, please RSVP by calling my Memphis
office at (901) 544-4131.
I hope you will attend Thursday's panel and education session to learn
how you can take advantage of breast cancer screenings with no co-pays
under the Affordable Care Act, and I encourage you to share this
information with your female family members. It could help save lives
in our city and around the country. And don't forget that the open
season deadline to enroll in health coverage for this year at
HealthCare.gov
is March 31st.
Fighting for a Sane Marijuana Policy
Nobody dies from marijuana, but people die from heroin overdoses-
including the late Philip Seymour Hoffman-every day. Every second we
spend trying to enforce marijuana possession laws is a moment that we're
not enforcing laws meant to protect Americans from the ravages of drugs
like heroin and meth. That's where our priority should be. When we put
marijuana on the same level as LSD, crack, heroin, meth, and cocaine-as
the federal government has-it only encourages young people not to
listen to us. They know that marijuana isn't as dangerous as harder
drugs.
Young people shouldn't be smoking marijuana, but they are. They
shouldn't be smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol either, but they
are. We shouldn't lock them up for any of that. Any time an American
goes to jail and has their liberty taken away from them for marijuana
possession, that is an injustice and a travesty. It is ludicrous,
absurd, and crazy to classify marijuana on the same level as more
dangerous drugs like heroin and methamphetamine. There is a cultural
lag in this country, and Congress and this Administration must fix it.
That's why when Michael Botticelli, Deputy Director of the Office of
National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), came before a House committee
this week I took him and his office to task for their outdated
policies. I am troubled that not only is the ONDCP the only federal
office required by law to oppose rescheduling marijuana even if it is
proven to have medical benefits, but that it is also prohibited from
studying if that could even be true. The ONDCP's job should be to
develop and recommend sane drug control policies, not be handcuffed or
muzzled from telling the American people the truth. Our War on Drugs
has failed, and the ONDCP should be able to recognize reality. I joined
Lawrence O'Donnell on MSNBC's The Last Word on Wednesday night to
discuss just how backwards our federal marijuana policies are. You can
watch our discussion here
.
Fully Funding the HOPE Scholarships
Over the last 10 years, the HOPE Scholarship program that I worked for
20 years as a State Senator to create has been an unparalleled success
that has provided $2.9 billion to Tennessee's best and brightest. And
while this funding has been critical to helping students attend college
and complete 4-year degrees, the HOPE Scholarship has never fully
funded college scholarships, as intended, because state lawmakers have
not allowed it to keep up with the skyrocketing cost of higher
education.
Today's HOPE Scholarships pay a smaller portion of college costs than
it did 10 years ago and, if Governor Haslam's newly-announced plan to
slash the first two years of HOPE Scholarships by 25% is implemented,
it will provide even smaller scholarships for freshmen and sophomores.
The first two years of college are crucial for students finding their
way. With scholarships paying a smaller portion of tuition, families
will have to pay more and students may need to work more hours while
studying, making academic success and retention of the HOPE Scholarship
more difficult. Today's college students are graduating with more
student loan debt than ever before, crippling their chances of economic
success.
To ensure that HOPE Scholarships continue to help Tennessee's students
afford college and succeed, the program must keep pace with the rising
cost of higher education. But the Governor's newly-announced "Promise"
actually cuts funding from high-achieving students beginning 4-year
degree programs. I am extremely concerned and remain cautious about any
plan that would make it harder for our state's proven young people to
begin attending the best universities in Tennessee, or any plan that
places additional financial burden on schools like the University of
Memphis which are already struggling to keep costs down and provide
high-quality educations.
Rather than raiding the scholarship fund's surplus to create a new
government program, those funds should be used for what the people of
Tennessee voted for: encouraging Tennessee high school students to work
hard and earn a scholarship which will then keep our best and brightest
students in Tennessee and providing Tennessee with a highly educated
and desirable workforce. The surplus funds would be better used, as I
personally expressed last year to Governor Haslam, by raising the
income cap on or raising the amount of Aspire Awards that give middle-
and low-income students who work hard extra help to give them a fair
shot at success.
Promoting Memphis Priorities to President Obama and His Administration
On Tuesday night, I visited the White House to attend a meeting with
President Obama and had a chance to speak with him about justice
issues. I was also able to speak with Chief of Staff Denis McDonough,
Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of
Transportation Anthony Foxx and Counsel to the President John Podesta
about projects that will help Memphis.
I also spoke with U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun
Donovan over the phone on Monday. Once again I urged him, as I have for
other projects, to approve the Choice Neighborhood implementation grant
for Foote Homes on Vance Avenue. It will be good for the citizens of
that neighborhood and it may be necessary for Memphis to be considered
for a Promise Zone designation. Mayor Wharton and I have worked closely
on both of these projects.
Protecting the Constitution and Civil Rights
On Wednesday, I was selected by my colleagues on the House Judiciary
Committee to be the lead Democrat on the Constitution and Civil Justice
subcommittee. Fighting to protect our civil rights has always been my
central focus throughout my legal and political careers. I am extremely
proud of and grateful for this opportunity to succeed Congressman Jerry
Nadler of New York as the top Democrat on this committee charged with
safeguarding the Constitution and protecting our civil liberties.
I take this appointment with great humility and responsibility, and I
look forward to using it to continue the fight for the issues that the
people of Memphis sent me here for. Whether safeguarding the voting
rights that we hold sacred and a woman's right to choose, curtailing
government surveillance overreach, or working to bring justice to the
victims of outdated and racially-biased mandatory minimum sentences, I
am committed to doing all that I can to protect the Constitution and
the civil rights of all Americans.
One of the first things I am doing with this new post is helping lead
the effort to protect and strengthen the Voting Rights Act. Just
yesterday morning, I met with Representatives Steny Hoyer, John
Conyers, Jim Clyburn, and Bobby Scott as well as the Leadership
Conference on Civil and Human Rights President Wade Henderson. We are
searching for Republican cosponsors and I hope to help pass a bill that
protects everyone's right to vote soon.
Ensuring Memphians Get the Tax Returns They Deserve
The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is too important for people to
overlook, and everyone who is eligible should claim it when filing
their taxes. But historically, eligible taxpayers in Memphis and Shelby
County have not taken full advantage of the program-last year alone, as
much as $70 million in potential tax credits were left on the table by
area taxpayers.
Memphians shouldn't pay more than they owe, and they should receive
every penny they deserve in refunds. That's why I was at the grand
opening of one of 15 new Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) sites
that just opened throughout Shelby County to provide guidance and
advice free of charge to ensure that eligible Shelby County citizens
take advantage of programs like the EITC and get the tax refund they
are entitled to. Click here
to find a VITA site near you to help ensure you get every penny
you are owed.
Helping Memphians Get Covered
All Memphians should have quality health insurance and the President's
landmark Affordable Care Act is making affordable, higher-quality
coverage available to people who have not had access to it in the past.
Luckily, many who have been unable to afford quality coverage in the
past are now eligible to enroll in Tennessee's Health Insurance
Marketplace
. Please don't forget that the open season
deadline to enroll in health coverage for this year at HealthCare.gov
is March 31st. And if you do not have health insurance coverage,
you may also be eligible to save money on your health care premiums
in the Marketplace.
If you are on Medicare or your employer is offering qualified health
insurance that you are enrolled in, you're already covered and won't
need to enter the Marketplace for your health coverage. If you aren't
sure whether or not you should use the Marketplace to get insurance,
call the Marketplace Hotline at 1 (800) 318-2596, visit
www.HealthCare.gov, or call Tennessee's navigator, Seedco, at (901)
528-8341. You can also call my office or the Marketplace Hotline to
find out if TennCare (Tennessee's Medicaid program) is a coverage
option for you. If you are one of the millions of Americans who need
health insurance, you can sign up
for coverage for 2014 until the open
enrollment period closes on March 31st, 2014. Visit www.healthcare.gov
today to look at your options.
The Affordable Care Act is already working for families across the
Ninth District. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, 147,000 individuals in the district now have health insurance
that covers preventive services without co-pays, $3.1 million in
insurance premiums have been returned to consumers, and more than 5,000
seniors on Medicare paid a total of $5.9 million less for their
prescription medications as we continue to close the 'donut hole.'
Also, health insurance companies can no longer discriminate against
patients with pre-existing conditions and young adults up to age 26 can
now stay on their parents' insurance plan.
Many of the Marketplace website issues that have been in the news have
been resolved. However, the Marketplace website is only one tool that
you can use to sign up for coverage. If you are having trouble
accessing the website, please do not hesitate to call the Marketplace
Hotline at 1 (800) 318-2596 or visit the Affordable Care Act Navigators
at Seedco's Mid-South office at 22 North Front Street (Suite 900) for
in-person help. Seedco can also be reached by phone at (901) 528-8341,
and if you have any other questions, you should feel free to call my
office at (901) 544-4131.
Saving Memphis Car-Owners Money
On Sunday, the Commercial Appeal reported
that the shutdown of Memphis' vehicle inspection program won't add
enough air pollution to violate federal smog rules. While I believe we
all have a part to play in protecting our air, this is good news.
I have heard from constituents about-and experienced for myself-the
frustration of being hit with hundreds of dollars in car repair bills
that will have limited, if any, emissions reductions benefits. Even
though my car registered zero emissions, I was unable to pass the
inspection because my "check engine" light was on-and had to pay
hundreds in repairs just to fix that so that I could pass the
inspection. While I am lucky to have been able to afford the repairs,
Memphians shouldn't have to shoulder an additional burden because of a
faulty testing system that discriminates against those who often don't
have the means to afford repairs that have little or no effect on their
vehicle's emissions.
United States Naval Academy Summer Programs
Each year, the United States Naval Academy invites more than 3,000
students to Annapolis, Maryland, to participate in its summer programs.
The Academy's summer STEM program, which is now accepting applications
here
, gives rising 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th graders the opportunity
to learn from some of the best college professors in the country and
work in world-class lab facilities. The Academy's Summer Seminars gives
rising 12th graders the opportunity to find out if they have what it
takes to be midshipmen by allowing them to experience the rigorous
academics, physical challenges, and student life at the Naval Academy.
More information about the Summer Seminar and how to apply is available
here
.
Helping Veterans Become Homeowners
Last year, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs helped a record
number of veterans obtain mortgage loans and become homeowners
. In guaranteeing nearly 630,000 home loans, the VA's Loan
Guarantee program helped more veterans become homeowners or move to a
new home than at any point in its 70-year history. Not only is this
great news for veterans, but it also is another sign that our housing
market is rebounding-and that is good news for everyone. The VA Loan
Guarantee program has some of the lowest foreclosure rates around and,
along with offering low interest rates, their loans do not require a
down payment from first-time buyers. If you are a veteran looking to
purchase a home, you can learn more about the program here
.
2014 U.S. Capitol Historical Society Calendars Are Available
My office currently has a limited number of 2014 U.S. Capitol
Historical Society calendars available. If you would like to receive a
calendar, please complete this short form on my website
. Due to the rules of
the House of Representatives, I am only able to mail calendars to
residents of Tennessee's Ninth District. Please feel free to share this
email with other citizens of the Ninth District who may be interested
in receiving one but who do not receive my eNewsletter.
Grant Announcements
I regularly release a list of grant announcements from federal agencies
like the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, and others. These
federal funding opportunities are available to faith-based and
neighborhood associations, nonprofits and other community organizations
in the 9th District. The announcements are updated regularly on my
website
.
As always, I remain.

for
African-American
women
with

This
racial
disparity
in
breast
cancer
outcomes
is
deplorable,
but
we
can
take

how
you
can

Fighting
for
a
Sane
Marijuana
Policy
Nobody
dies
from
marijuana,
but
people
die
from
heroin
overdoses&#8212;including
the
late
Philip
Seymour
Hoffman&#8212;every
day.
Every
second
we
spend
trying
to
enforce
marijuana
possession
laws
is
a
moment
that
we&#8217;re
not
enforcing
laws
meant
to
protect
Americans
from
the
ravages
of
drugs
like
heroin
and
meth.
That&#8217;s
where
our
priority
should
be.
When
we
put
marijuana
on
the
same
level
as
LSD,
crack,
heroin,
meth,
and
cocaine&#8212;as
the
federal
government
has&#8212;it
only
encourages
young
people
not
to
listen
to
us.
They
know
that
marijuana
isn&#8217;t
as
dangerous
as
harder
drugs.
Young
people
shouldn&#8217;t
be
smoking
marijuana,
but
they
are.
They
shouldn&#8217;t
be
smoking
cigarettes
or
drinking
alcohol
either,
but
they
are.
We
shouldn&#8217;t
lock
them
up
for
any
of
that.
Any
time
an
American
goes
to
jail
and
has
their
liberty
taken
away
from
them
for
marijuana
possession,
that
is
an
injustice
and
a
travesty.
It
is
ludicrous,
absurd,
and
crazy
to
classify
marijuana
on
the
same
level
as
more
dangerous
drugs
like
heroin
and
methamphetamine.
There
is
a
cultural
lag
in
this
country,
and
Congress
and
this
Administration
must
fix
it.
That&#8217;s
why
when
Michael
Botticelli,
Deputy
Director
of
the
Office
of
National
Drug
Control
Policy
(ONDCP),
came
before
a
House
committee
this
week
I
took
him
and
his
office
to
task
for
their
outdated
policies.
I
am
troubled
that
not
only
is
the
ONDCP
the
only
federal
office
required
by
law
to
oppose
rescheduling
marijuana
even
if
it
is
proven
to
have
medical
benefits,
but
that
it
is
also
prohibited
from
studying
if
that
could
even
be
true.
The
ONDCP&#8217;s
job
should
be
to
develop
and
recommend
sane
drug
control
policies,
not
be
handcuffed
or
muzzled
from
telling
the
American
people
the
truth.
Our
War
on
Drugs
has
failed,
and
the
ONDCP
should
be
able
to
recognize
reality.
I
joined
Lawrence
O&#8217;Donnell
on
MSNBC&#8217;s
The
Last
Word
on
Wednesday
night
to
discuss
just
how
backwards
our
federal
marijuana
policies
are.
You

our
discussion

Fully
Funding
the
HOPE
Scholarships
Over
the
last
10
years,
the
HOPE
Scholarship
program
that
I
worked
for
20
years
as
a
State
Senator
to
create
has
been
an
unparalleled
success
that
has
provided
$2.9
billion
to
Tennessee&#8217;s
best
and
brightest.
And
while
this
funding
has
been
critical
to
helping
students
attend
college
and
complete
4-year
degrees,
the
HOPE
Scholarship
has
never
fully
funded
college
scholarships,
as
intended,
because
state
lawmakers
have
not
allowed
it
to
keep
up
with
the
skyrocketing
cost
of
higher
education.
Today&#8217;s
HOPE
Scholarships
pay
a
smaller
portion
of
college
costs
than
it
did
10
years
ago
and,
if
Governor
Haslam&#8217;s
newly-announced
plan
to
slash
the
first
two
years
of
HOPE
Scholarships
by
25%
is
implemented,
it
will
provide
even
smaller
scholarships
for
freshmen
and
sophomores.
The
first
two
years
of
college
are
crucial
for
students
finding
their
way.
With
scholarships
paying
a
smaller
portion
of
tuition,
families
will
have
to
pay
more
and
students
may
need
to
work
more
hours
while
studying,
making
academic
success
and
retention
of
the
HOPE
Scholarship
more
difficult. Today&#8217;s
college
students
are
graduating
with
more
student
loan
debt
than
ever
before,
crippling
their
chances
of
economic
success.
To
ensure
that
HOPE
Scholarships
continue
to
help
Tennessee&#8217;s
students
afford
college
and
succeed,
the
program
must
keep
pace
with
the
rising
cost
of
higher
education.
But
the
Governor&#8217;s
newly-announced
"Promise"
actually
cuts
funding
from
high-achieving
students
beginning
4-year
degree
programs.
I
am
extremely
concerned
and
remain
cautious
about
any
plan
that
would
make
it
harder
for
our
state&#8217;s
proven
young
people
to
begin
attending
the
best
universities
in
Tennessee,
or
any
plan
that
places
additional
financial
burden
on
schools
like
the
University
of
Memphis
which
are
already
struggling
to
keep
costs
down
and
provide
high-quality
educations.
Rather
than
raiding
the
scholarship
fund&#8217;s
surplus
to
create
a
new
government
program,
those
funds
should
be
used
for
what
the
people
of
Tennessee
voted
for:
encouraging
Tennessee
high
school
students
to
work
hard
and
earn
a
scholarship
which
will
then
keep
our
best
and
brightest
students
in
Tennessee
and
providing
Tennessee
with
a
highly
educated
and
desirable
workforce.
The
surplus
funds
would
be
better
used,
as
I
personally
expressed
last
year
to
Governor
Haslam,
by
raising
the
income
cap
on
or
raising
the
amount
of
Aspire
Awards
that
give
middle-
and
low-income
students
who
work
hard
extra
help
to
give
them
a
fair
shot
at
success.
Promoting
Memphis
Priorities
to
President
Obama
and
His
Administration
On
Tuesday
night,
I
visited
the
White
House
to
attend
a
meeting
with
President
Obama
and
had
a
chance
to
speak
with
him
about
justice
issues.
I
was
also
able
to
speak
with
Chief
of
Staff
Denis
McDonough,
Secretary
of
Health
and
Human
Services
Kathleen
Sebelius,
Secretary
of
Transportation
Anthony
Foxx
and
Counsel
to
the
President
John
Podesta
about
projects
that
will
help
Memphis.
I
also
spoke
with
U.S.
Secretary
of
Housing
and
Urban
Development
Shaun
Donovan
over
the
phone
on
Monday.
Once
again
I
urged
him,
as
I
have
for
other
projects,
to
approve
the
Choice
Neighborhood
implementation
grant
for
Foote
Homes
on
Vance
Avenue.
It
will
be
good
for
the
citizens
of
that
neighborhood
and
it
may
be
necessary
for
Memphis
to
be
considered
for
a
Promise
Zone
designation.
Mayor
Wharton
and
I
have
worked
closely
on
both
of
these
projects.
Protecting
the
Constitution
and
Civil
Rights
On
Wednesday,
I
was
selected
by
my
colleagues
on
the
House
Judiciary
Committee
to
be
the
lead
Democrat
on
the
Constitution
and
Civil
Justice
subcommittee.
Fighting
to
protect
our
civil
rights
has
always
been
my
central
focus
throughout
my
legal
and
political
careers.
I
am
extremely
proud
of
and
grateful
for
this
opportunity
to
succeed
Congressman
Jerry
Nadler
of
New
York
as
the
top
Democrat
on
this
committee
charged
with
safeguarding
the
Constitution
and
protecting
our
civil
liberties.
I
take
this
appointment
with
great
humility
and
responsibility,
and
I
look
forward
to
using
it
to
continue
the
fight
for
the
issues
that
the
people
of
Memphis
sent
me
here
for.
Whether
safeguarding
the
voting
rights
that
we
hold
sacred
and
a
woman&#8217;s
right
to
choose,
curtailing
government
surveillance
overreach,
or
working
to
bring
justice
to
the
victims
of
outdated
and
racially-biased
mandatory
minimum
sentences,
I
am
committed
to
doing
all
that
I
can
to
protect
the
Constitution
and
the
civil
rights
of
all
Americans.
One
of
the
first
things
I
am
doing
with
this
new
post
is
helping
lead
the
effort
to
protect
and
strengthen
the
Voting
Rights
Act.
Just
yesterday
morning,
I
met
with
Representatives
Steny
Hoyer,
John
Conyers,
Jim
Clyburn,
and
Bobby
Scott
as
well
as
the
Leadership
Conference
on
Civil
and
Human
Rights
President
Wade
Henderson.
We
are
searching
for
Republican
cosponsors
and
I
hope
to
help
pass
a
bill
that
protects
everyone&#8217;s
right
to
vote
soon.
Ensuring
Memphians
Get
the
Tax
Returns
They
Deserve
The
Earned
Income
Tax
Credit
(EITC)
is
too
important
for
people
to
overlook,
and
everyone
who
is
eligible
should
claim
it
when
filing
their
taxes.
But
historically,
eligible
taxpayers
in
Memphis
and
Shelby
County
have
not
taken
full
advantage
of
the
program&#8212;last
year
alone,
as
much
as
$70
million
in
potential
tax
credits
were
left
on
the
table
by
area
taxpayers.
Memphians
shouldn&#8217;t
pay
more
than
they
owe,
and
they
should
receive
every
penny
they
deserve
in
refunds.
That&#8217;s
why
I
was
at
the
grand
opening
of
one
of
15
new
Volunteer
Income
Tax
Assistance
(VITA)
sites
that
just
opened
throughout
Shelby
County
to
provide
guidance
and
advice
free
of
charge
to
ensure
that
eligible
Shelby
County
citizens
take
advantage
of
programs
like
the
EITC
and
get
the
tax
refund
they
are
entitled
to.

a
VITA
site
near
you
to
help
ensure
you
get
every
penny
you
are
owed.
Helping
Memphians
Get
Covered
All
Memphians
should
have
quality
health
insurance
and
the
President&#8217;s
landmark
Affordable
Care
Act
is
making
affordable,
higher-quality
coverage
available
to
people
who
have
not
had
access
to
it
in
the
past.
Luckily,
many
who
have
been
unable
to
afford
quality
coverage
in
the
past
are
now
eligible
to
enroll
in
Tennessee&#8217;s
Health
Insurance
Marketplace .
Please
don&#8217;t
forget
that
the
open
season
deadline
to
enroll
in
health
coverage
for
this
year
at
HealthCare.gov
is
March
31st.
And
if
you
do
not
have
health
insurance
coverage,
you
may
also
be
eligible
to
save
money
on
your
health
care
premiums
in
the
Marketplace.
If
you
are
on
Medicare
or
your
employer
is
offering
qualified
health
insurance
that
you
are
enrolled
in,
you&#8217;re
already
covered
and
won&#8217;t
need
to
enter
the
Marketplace
for
your
health
coverage.
If
you
aren&#8217;t
sure
whether
or
not
you
should
use
the
Marketplace
to
get
insurance,
call
the
Marketplace
Hotline
at
1

318-2596,
visit
www.HealthCare.gov,
or
call
Tennessee&#8217;s

Seedco,

You
can
also
call
my
office
or
the
Marketplace
Hotline
to
find
out
if
TennCare
(Tennessee&#8217;s
Medicaid
program)
is
a
coverage
option
for
you.
If
you
are
one
of
the
millions
of
Americans
who
need
health
insurance,
you
can
sign
up
for
coverage
for
2014
until
the
open
enrollment
period
closes
on
March
31st,
2014.

The
Affordable
Care
Act
is
already
working
for
families
across
the
Ninth
District.
According
to
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services,
147,000
individuals
in
the
district
now
have
health
insurance
that
covers
preventive
services
without
co-pays,
$3.1
million
in
insurance
premiums
have
been
returned
to
consumers,
and
more
than
5,000
seniors
on
Medicare
paid
a
total
of
$5.9
million
less
for
their
prescription
medications
as
we
continue
to
close
the
&#8216;donut
hole.&#8217;
Also,
health
insurance
companies
can
no
longer
discriminate
against
patients
with
pre-existing
conditions
and
young
adults
up
to
age
26
can
now
stay
on
their
parents&#8217;
insurance
plan.

Saving
Memphis
Car-Owners
Money
On
Sunday,
the
Commercial
Appeal
reported
that
the
shutdown
of
Memphis&#8217;
vehicle
inspection
program
won&#8217;t
add
enough
air
pollution
to
violate
federal
smog
rules.
While
I
believe
we
all
have
a
part
to
play
in
protecting
our
air,
this
is
good
news.
I
have
heard
from
constituents
about&#8212;and
experienced
for
myself&#8212;the
frustration
of
being
hit
with
hundreds
of
dollars
in
car
repair
bills
that
will
have
limited,
if
any,
emissions
reductions
benefits.
Even
though
my
car
registered
zero
emissions,
I
was
unable
to
pass
the
inspection
because
my
&#8220;check
engine&#8221;
light
was
on&#8212;and
had
to
pay
hundreds
in
repairs
just
to
fix
that
so
that
I
could
pass
the
inspection.
While
I
am
lucky
to
have
been
able
to
afford
the
repairs,
Memphians
shouldn&#8217;t
have
to
shoulder
an
additional
burden
because
of
a
faulty
testing
system
that
discriminates
against
those
who
often
don&#8217;t
have
the
means
to
afford
repairs
that
have
little
or
no
effect
on
their
vehicle&#8217;s
emissions.
United

the
United

in
its
summer
programs.
The
Academy&#8217;s

Helping
Veterans
Become
Homeowners
Last
year,
the
U.S.
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
helped
a
record
number
of
veterans
obtain
mortgage
loans
and
become
homeowners .
In
guaranteeing
nearly
630,000
home
loans,
the
VA&#8217;s
Loan
Guarantee
program
helped
more
veterans
become
homeowners
or
move
to
a
new
home
than
at
any
point
in
its
70-year
history.
Not
only
is
this
great
news
for
veterans,
but
it
also
is
another
sign
that
our
housing
market
is
rebounding&#8212;and
that
is
good
news
for
everyone.
The
VA
Loan
Guarantee
program
has
some
of
the
lowest
foreclosure
rates
around
and,
along
with
offering
low
interest
rates,
their
loans
do
not
require
a
down
payment
from
first-time
buyers.
If
you
are
a
veteran
looking
to
purchase
a
home,
you
can
learn
more
about
the
program
