 from IRS Commissioner John Koskinen as to how his agency lost copies of emails sent by Lois Lerner and other IRS officials who targeted conservative non-profit groups. Mr. Koskinen claimed the emails were lost in computer crashes
which were convenient if these officials had something to hide. Weve heard a lot of excuses from the IRS since this scandal was revealed last year, but this dog-ate-my-emails story might be the dumbest. Along with my fellow members of the Ways and Means Committee, I will continue investigating this issue until we learn the whole truth and until all those who broke the law face justice.

Dear Friends,
Today, the Ways and Means Committee heard
testimony
from IRS Commissioner John Koskinen as to how his agency lost copies of emails sent by Lois Lerner and other IRS officials who targeted conservative non-profit groups. Mr. Koskinen claimed the emails were lost in computer crashes
which were
convenient if these officials had something to hide. Weve heard a lot of excuses from the IRS since this scandal was revealed last year, but this dog-ate-my-emails story might be the dumbest. Along with my fellow members of the Ways and Means Committee,
I will continue investigating this issue until we learn the whole truth and until all those who broke the law face justice.
