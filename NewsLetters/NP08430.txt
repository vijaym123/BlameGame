Fixing the Department of Veterans Affairs
Although developments in Iraq have pushed the problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs out of the headlines, I am committed to bringing long-term solutions to the VA and reforming the bureaucratic layers that are limiting access to care. In this pursuit, I am honored to be named a VA Conference Committee member, entrusted to work with the Senate in negotiating and crafting reform legislation.
"U.S. Congressman Brad Wenstrup has been selected with 13 other House members to represent the House of Representatives to reconcile differences in proposed reforms to the Department of Veterans Affairs."

Many of the challenges we face are largely administrative, not a question of funding. As we work with the Senate, I'm confident we can find common ground to eliminate the systemic VA inefficiencies that block our veterans from receiving timely care. The Department of Veterans Affairs should be in the business of serving veterans, not protecting bureaucrats.
And while I work in Washington towards legislative reforms, I am working locally - right here in the Second District - to ensure our veterans are getting the best care possible.
Listening to Local Veterans
I've hosted two veterans' listening sessions in Ohio this month, and have more planned over the next few weeks.
Hearing directly from Ohio veterans gives me the best perspective on how to fix the problems we face.
Getting Answers on Cinci's VA
In the VA's initial audit on wait times, Cincinnati was "flagged for further review and investigation."
I asked the Department of Veterans Affairs why.

American Security Abroad
As an Army Reservist and veteran of the Iraq war, I share Ohioans' concerns regarding recent Guantanamo prisoner releases, the ongoing Benghazi investigation, and the implosion in Iraq.
As I hear your concerns on these issues, I'm using my position on the House Armed Services Committee to question key government leaders, like Secretary of Defense Hagel, on their decisions and the potential impacts.
Questioning Secretary Hagel
When the Obama Administration failed to notify Congress 30 days ahead of transferring prisoners out of Guantanamo Bay, it violated the law. I questioned Secretary Hagel on this breach of trust and the law.
Make Your Voice Heard
Do you agree with the prisoner exchange that freed an American soldier for 5 high level-members of the Taliban?
