WEEK IN REVIEW
This week, the House
wrapped up its legislative business for 2013.
Thank you to everyone who participated in
and listened into my teletown hall Tuesday
evening!
In addition to a short-term farm
bill extension, the National Defense Authorization Act agreement, and
a number of bills considered under suspension of the rules, the House
considered and passed the Bipartisan Budget Act yesterday by a vote of
332-94.
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013
establishes the top line discretionary spending levels for FY 2014 and 2015
and reduces the deficit by $23 billion by identifying deficit saving
proposals that include mandatory savings and non-tax revenues.
In
addition, the bill prevents a 20.1 percent cut in Medicare physician
reimbursements currently set for January 1, 2014, and replaces it with
a .5 percent increase until April 1, 2014.
To not vote for
this bill would have been the easy decision, but I made a vow to my
constituents to work with my colleagues in the House and the Senate to
address Americas spending problem, a problem which is driven by our
mandatory spending.
And while certainly not perfect, the
Bipartisan Budget Act takes an important step in that direction.
In
addition to delivering greater deficit reduction without increasing taxes,
this agreement moves us away from governing by crisis, provides
much-needed certainty, and, more importantly, gets us back to regular
order.
You can

It is important to understand the
significance of returning to regular order.
The federal government has been
operating under continuing resolutions (CR) for far too long.
Operating under CRs is incredibly inefficient.
Moreover, it is an
abdication of Congresss constitutional responsibility.
By not
passing annual appropriations bills and running the government on CRs,
Congress is ceding its authority to the administration and allowing
President Obama, his cabinet members, and agency heads to determine
where and how they spend appropriated funds.
The agreement puts
Congress back in control of the purse strings, which is what our founders
intended.
I understand the concerns with the deal,
and I agree that it is not ideal.
But these were the changes we
were able to negotiate, and they are consistent with our principles of
reducing the deficit without increasing taxes and maintaining a
strong national defense.
It is clear that Democrats and Republicans
will not agree on a grand bargain to make the necessary reforms to
entitlement programs and to put our budget on a path to balance, so
Republicans must find ways to move the ball forward, even if it is
incrementally, to get us closer to our goal of eliminating our deficits,
paying down our debt, and balancing our budget.
From the Front...
