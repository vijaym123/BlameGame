Dear Friends,
Im encouraged to report significant
progress on my effort to bring common sense and flexibility to criminal
sentencing.
On Tuesday, I was among 16 members of Congress
from both parties who met with President Obama at the White House. The
group included four other conservative stalwarts, Sens. Mike Lee and
Rand Paul and Reps. Jason Chaffetz and Trey Gowdy.
We spent
much of the two hours discussing my bill, the Smarter Sentencing Act,
which I introduced earlier this month with Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va. H.R.
920 would allow judges discretion to make individualized assessments
in nonviolent drug cases, ensuring limited resources are focused on the
most serious offenders.
On Wednesday, the White House told
USA Today the Smarter Sentencing Act appears to meet the presidents
goals. For all our differences, a broad coalition is building for
reform, from the Center for American Progress and ACLU on the left to
Americans for Tax Reform and FreedomWorks on the
right.
Mandatory minimum sentences treat all offenders the same, forcing judges to
impose penalties on first-time nonviolent drug offenders. All too
often, these young people leave prison schooled by violent criminals. That
hurts the young offenders, their families and
society.
Scaling back and eliminating mandatory minimum sentences is also good for
taxpayers. Federal prison spending has increased more than five-fold
in 30 years. It costs $29,000 a year to house a federal inmate. Our
bill could save up to $24 billion over the first 20 years.
As
a conservative, I take seriously the Constitutions protections
against the government depriving citizens of their liberty. It troubles me
that with 5 percent of the worlds population, the U.S. has 25 percent
of the global prison population.
Thanks in part to some
modest reforms already in place, last year was the first time in 40 years
that the federal incarceration rate and the crime rate dropped at the
same time. We have a chance to build on that
momentum.
While some opponents believe reform will lead to more crime, I think the
opposite is true. We must be tough on those who deserve the harshest
sentences, but smart in dealing with those who deserve a second
chance.
To learn more about the reform effort, read the
USA Today report , a
Wall Street Journal
story
and an
editorial in the Spokane
Spokesman-Review .
Thank you ,
