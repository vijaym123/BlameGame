Friend,
On Monday we set a goal of raising $5,000 by our July 31st general election deadline.
My team says that with 48 hours left, we&#39;re close to hitting our goal. Maybe I underestimated how terrific my grassroots supporters are! Thank you.
We know that our race will be one of the most closely watched in the country - and one of the most expensive.
We also know that my opponent, former Congressman Doug Ose, is a self-funder committed to putting millions of dollars of his own resources in the race. In fact, he&#39;s already donated over $600,000 of his own money to try and take this seat.
So - with 48 hours to go, we&#39;re upping our goal to $7500. Give $5 or whatever you can now to help us get there.
I have the best and most generous supporters in the country.
That is my secret weapon .
While I can&#39;t compete with Ose&#39;s millions, what I do have is people like you - people committed to a fairer America.
I&#39;m committed to the vision of an America where everyone has a chance. By working together, we can realize this dream.
I&#39;ll keep fighting, and I hope you will too. Click here to give $5 or more so we can keep up the fight.
Thank you. You&#39;re amazing.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
PS - With your help, we&#39;ll hit this goal by midnight tomorrow - and be in a great place to go up against our self-funding opponent. Click here and give whatever you can now.
