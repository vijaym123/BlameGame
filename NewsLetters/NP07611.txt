Dear Friend,
The Koch brothers are on track to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on this year&rsquo;s elections. The Kochs&rsquo; network alone has pledged to raise
$290 million
to spend on political activities this year. And even a small fraction of that amount could swing the momentum in our race.
I&rsquo;m standing between these Big Oil billionaires and the radical, anti-middle class agenda they want to ram through the Senate. All across the country, the Koch brothers are propping up candidates who will vote for their agenda. At the same time, they&rsquo;re using their millions to attack those of us who are trying to make progress in Washington. The Koch brothers will have a candidate in Massachusetts, and we need to be prepared for any attack they throw our way. You can help us be ready by making a $5 contribution.

If and when they decide to test Bay State voters, the Kochs&rsquo; man in Massachusetts will likely be my opponent, Brian Herr. Like other Koch-backed candidates around the country, Herr isn&rsquo;t saying much. But we do know that he&rsquo;s said he would vote to repeal the health care law that Senator Kennedy worked so hard to make a reality.
Brian Herr doesn&rsquo;t seem to have any new ideas -- but neither do the Koch brothers. They&rsquo;re in favor of the same economic policies that turned Wall St. into a casino and nearly brought about a second Great Depression. They&rsquo;re in favor of tax breaks for oil and gas companies that would only exacerbate the problems of climate change. And they could drop an eight-figure check on Massachusetts at any moment. We need to be ready to stand tall against the Kochs&rsquo; millions -- give $5 so we can weather any storm.
We&rsquo;re a little more than 100 days away from the moment of truth. Let&rsquo;s make sure we&rsquo;re in position to win for the people of Massachusetts.
Thank you for your support.
