Obama's Border Crisis
Dear Friends,
The national security and humanitarian crisis at the border was an avoidable situation--one that was caused by President Obamas failure to enforce our immigration laws. Last night, I spoke with Lou Dobbs on Fox Business about what House conservatives are doing stop the exploitation of innocent children who have been given false hope that they can stay in America if they just make it across the border.
I am using every legislative tool at my disposal to stop the Obama Administrations lawlessness immediately. The power of the purse is the most effective tool in Congress, and Im working with my colleagues on the House Appropriations Committee on language that will force the administration to enforce our laws and secure our border or we will cut off their money.
Its the fastest and most effective way to rein in the Administration, since President Obama wont respond to subpoenas, Congressional inquiries, or public opinion. If his administration wont enforce the law, then I will do everything in my power to ensure they wont get paid.
I hope you'll take a few minutes to watch my interview with Lou Dobbs.
- John
