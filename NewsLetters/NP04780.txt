In a MILLION years, I NEVER thought we&rsquo;d have more than 55,000 contributions for Brad&rsquo;s re-election. But we did.
And in a MILLION years, I NEVER thought we could raise $1 MILLION online. But we did.
Mostly though, in a MILLION years, I NEVER thought anyone could survive SO MANY EMAILS!!! But you did! ;-)
David, you&rsquo;ve done so much for Brad. You've gotten this far, and you've made this campaign possible.
So here it is, my last request before Election Day. Will you pitch in one final time to help us get out the vote and win this thing for Brad? If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
THANK YOU!!!
