it
will
take
priority
over
the
default

in
the
TD.

COMMENT:
Things
to
Avoid:
Microsoft's
Outlook
mail
client
in
particular
has
a
variety
of

size
and
table

that
it
will
not
render.
COMMENT:
Do
not
use
Table
"cellpadding"
or
Style
"margin-padding"
as
both
are
stripped
out
by
Outlook
2007
and
2010.
COMMENT:
Avoid
tables
that
are
more
than
a
single
"page"
(22
inches
or
1500
pixels)
in
height
because
they
will
leave
mysterious
horizontal
gaps
or
blank
areas
between
content
that
otherwise
should
be
above
and
below
in
relation
to
each
other.
COMMENT:
You
may
however
stack
shorter
tables
on

to
form
one
very
long

of

and
avoid
the
