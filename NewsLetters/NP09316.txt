Friends,
This weekend, we honor the brave servicemembers who gave all for our country and express our eternal gratitude to their families. We are reminded of the precious gift of freedom and the cost of its preservation. The sacrifice of many sons and daughters has allowed us to go about our daily lives in peace and put our kids to bed without worry.
Part of honoring our fallen heroes is caring for those they fought beside, Americas veterans. Our society will not tolerate the immoral treatment of veterans.
Providing our veterans with the best possible care, and holding the VA accountable for its misconduct, will show our national gratitude for all who have served in uniform, especially those we remember this Memorial Day.
Freedom First,
Rep. Graves Votes To Allow Swift Termination Of Senior VA Officials
Rep. Graves and the House passed a bill to streamline the process for terminating senior management officials at the Department of Veterans Affairs who failed to do their jobs.
This new authority replaces the slow, multi-step process for removing senior employees that is currently in place.
Military Funding Bill Passes
On May 22, the House passed the National Defense Authorization Act, a major piece of legislation that provides support and resources for the U.S. military on and off the battlefield.
