Fellow Illinoisans:
Please watch this video for a special
message about Memorial Day.
Since 9/11 more than 6,800 American
service members
including 250 sons
and daughters of Illinois
have paid
the ultimate sacrifice serving our country in
the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
And even as Americas military
involvement in those conflicts winds down,
American service members continue to risk
and give
their lives to help
others around the globe.
Earlier this month, Marine Corporal Sara
Medina died, along with five fellow Marines,
while providing humanitarian relief to the
people of Nepal after their terrible
earthquake. Corporal Medina was from Aurora,
Illinois. She was 23 years old. She was
looking forward to coming home this summer to
marry a fellow Marine.
Memorial Day is about remembering and
honoring the sacrifices of all our fallen
heroes.
We can fulfill that obligation by making
sure that our troops today have the best
training, the best equipment, and the best
protection this nation can provide
and by honoring our sacred pledge to take
care of the servicemen and women who do come
home.
So as we celebrate warmer weather and
spend time with family and friends this
weekend, let us all remember what this day is
really about: honoring the lives of those we
have lost.
To those who have made that sacrifice, and
to their loved ones: thank you. Happy
Memorial Day.
Sincerely,
Dick Durbin
United States Senator
