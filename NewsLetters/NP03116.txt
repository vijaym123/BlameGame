State of the Union:
Another missed opportunity for President Obama &amp; his
legacy
In November, Americans sent a
clear message to Washington that they were tired of political gridlock
and want solutions and real results to the problems facing our
country. Both President Bush and President Clinton used their State of the
Union address following difficult midterm elections to acknowledge that
they no longer have control of both chambers and that it was time for
them to work with Congress. Unfortunately, this was another missed
opportunity for President Obama and his legacy.
President
Obamainstead used the State of the Union to appease his political base
and focused on dividing our Nation and using bureaucratic control to
run our country with top-down Washington-centered solutions. I believe
the key to growing a healthy economy begins by strengthening the
paycheck of hard working Americans, putting more money into Kansans
pockets, and growing our economy from the bottom-up.
While I was
disappointed in many of the President's remarks, I remain hopeful
there will be opportunities in the near future to work together to expand
trade and fix our broken tax code. It is my hope that this President
will seize those opportunities just as those who preceded him
did.
Watch my reaction to the State of the Union in an interview
I did with WIBW News

The Presidents Proposals to Tax Existing Higher Education
Incentives
Several
years ago I had the honor of serving as President of the National
Association of State Treasurers, where we all worked tirelessly to expand
and improve college savings tools so families would have the
opportunity to send their kids to the institution of higher education of their
choice.
Congress created section 529 to help middle
class families plan and save for their childrens future and there is no
doubt about the popularity of these plans.
Ever since the
earnings on withdrawals for college expenses became tax free back in 2001, 1
million account holders have turned into 12 million.
Now
President Obama wishes to turn back the clock and further burden hard
working families with new taxes. Middle income families that have
worked hard and saved to send their children to college should receive our
support, not a new tax bill to pay for his agenda. Taxing college
savings plans as the President is pushing for will only lead to less
savings for middle class families.
It will remove the incentive for
families to provide for themselves.
Read more about my
thoughts in an interview I did this week with the
Wall Street
Journal
here .
I also spoke about
this issue at the Republican Leadership Press Conference and I encourage
you to watch
here .
What
They Are Saying About the Presidents
Proposal:
The
Wall Street Journal
editorial
board
wrote in an article titled,
Now Hes
After Middle Class Savers ,
One more time the
Administration is using the political cover of middle class to disguise a
transfer of power from the middle class to
government.
Taxpayer watchdog group, Americans for Tax
Reform , called it a
tax increase on families saving
for college.
The College
Savings Foundation , a nonprofit, warned the change would
undercut the effectiveness of 529 plans
the most effective and
by far the most popular college savings vehicle available to middle
income
families.
Presidents Visit to the
University of Kansas
It is always an honor to have the
President visit your home state.
At KU, the President discussed
his plansto make college more affordable, fix the broken tax code,
grow the economy, and help all Americans get ahead. I couldnt agree more
that these must be our top priorities in Washington, however, I
strongly disagree with his ideas on how we get there.
The
President also said to House Republicans in his speech,
It can't just
be no. I'm happy to start a conversation. Tell me how to do the
things we need to do. Tell me how to get to yes. You can't just say
no."
Ironically, this comes two days after the President
set a record for the most veto threats ever
at a
State of the Union speech. In fact, House Republicans have said yes
over 350 times .
Last Congress the House
passed over
350 bills
which 98% passed with
bipartisan support
that ended up in Harry Reids trash canwithout even
getting a vote.
There are a number of solutions House
Republicans and President Obama can find agreements on if the President is
interested in sitting down and working
together.
House Passes the
No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion
Act :
This week the House acted on another issue that a majority
of Americans agree on and passed H.R. 7, the
No Tax Payer Funding
for Abortion Act.
I was pleased the House passed this legislation
when Washington welcomed Kansans and thousands of other Americans to
in celebrating the March for Life.
I was a cosponsor of
this legislation in the previous two Congresses, and I continue to
support it after hearing from Kansans time and time again that they do not
want their taxpayer dollars funding abortions.
The
specter of taxpayer-funded abortion has been exacerbated by the President's
healthcare law, which offers subsidies to taxpayers in order to
offset its high cost. These subsidized plans, bought through the healthcare
exchanges, could allow for taxpayer funded abortions to
occur.
Without this critical legislation, we will continue to have a
patchwork of provisions regarding federal funding. This creates
confusion, blocks transparency, and opens up additional loopholes. The
longstanding provisions of the Hyde Amendment are re-established under H.R.
7, which would apply uniformly across federal programs, including the
President's destructive healthcare law.
I spoke in
support of this legislation on the House Floor this week and I encourage you
to watch it
here .
