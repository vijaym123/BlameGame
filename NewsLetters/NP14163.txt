The House Keeps the President's Broken Promise
For the last six weeks, Americans have been dealing with a broken
website, and even worse, a broken promise.
President Obama repeatedly
pledged that "if you like your health care plan, you can keep your
health care plan.
Period."
That pledge turned out to be hollow as
the cancellations began to mount.
NBC News has reported that the Obama Administration has known for years
it could not keep the president's promise that people could keep their
existing coverage.
According to the report, 50 to 75 percent of
Americans who purchase insurance in the individual market can expect to
receive a cancellation letter or the equivalent over the next year.
So
far, at least 3.5 million people have seen health plans cancelled with
the number rising each day.
This past Thursday, the president announced that insurance companies
will be permitted to continue to sell health care policies previously
barred by Obamacare. This announcement is proof that his healthcare law
is inherently flawed and was sold with false promises.
He has
essentially admitted that when he told the American people they could
keep their current health plans if they liked them, 'period,' it simply
wasn't true.
Also, I question the president's legal authority to make
such a change in the law, which is why I cosponsored the Keep Your
Health Plan Act (H.R. 3350) to keep his promise for him.
The Keep Your Health Plan Act will ensure that millions of Americans
who have seen their policies cancelled under Obamacare will be able to
keep them in 2014.
Specifically, this important legislation allows
plans available on the individual market today to be offered next year,
providing millions the opportunity to keep their policies in 2014.
It
also would ensure that Americans keeping their plans would not face a
penalty under Obamacare's individual mandate.
I suppose a lot of people thought the president meant what he said,
which is why this legislation is necessary - to keep the president's
promise after the fact. Too many people are being forced off their
health insurance through no fault of their own, against the president's
promise, and at a tremendous cost to themselves and their families.
In an effort to keep Obama's broken promise, on November 15, the House
passed the Keep Your Health Plan Act with my support.
This important
legislation now awaits action in the U.S. Senate.

Immigration Update
During a briefing at the National Press Club on October 30, the Center
for Immigration Studies (CIS) revealed its report that shows the Obama
Administration is artificially inflating its claims of deporting
illegal immigrants in order to move toward a broad plan for amnesty.
Specifically, the CIS report, titled "Deportation Numbers Unwrapped
," found that more than half of the
deportations attributed to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)
were the result of border arrests, or "turn-aways," that would never
have been counted as removals in prior years.
The number of
deportations resulting from actual interior enforcement by ICE has
fallen steadily - by 19 percent from 2011 to 2012, and by 22 percent by
the end of 2013.
This pokes holes into the false perception that this administration is
projecting that our borders are more secure.
I believe that is nothing
more than smoke and mirrors to set the stage for an amnesty bill.
The United States has immigration laws for two main reasons: to protect
national security and to protect American jobs.
Porous borders are a
demonstrable threat to national security, as too many terrorist attacks
and criminal cases have proven.
Additionally, granting amnesty to the
estimated 11 million illegal immigrants currently believed to be
present in the United States would flood labor markets, making it more
difficult for legal residents to find jobs while driving down wages.
Whether it's a border security bill or any immigration bill, I believe
a 'Pathway to Citizenship' bill is the wrong step for our country.
We
don't need new laws right now.
We need an administration that will
enforce the laws we already have.

The Many Faces of Obamacare
Since the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, more commonly
referred to as "Obamacare," was enacted in 2010, the full implications
of this burdensome law are becoming clearer.
Across the country,
Americans are experiencing first-hand the critical problems we face as
a nation with its implementation.
Most recently, the Administration's enrollment website, HealthCare.gov,
has been anything but successful with "glitches" at almost every turn
causing frustration and anxiety. Some have experienced trouble creating
accounts and even logging in to the website, while others have received
confusing error messages, or spent precious time waiting for the
website to load.
>From "glitches" to increasing premiums, these are just the tip of the
iceberg of the problems that exist with the president's health care
law, and many more are sure to come.
I want to hear from you. If you are experiencing problems with the
Obamacare exchanges or seeing a hike in your insurance premium, send me

Federal Emergency Managment Agency Reauthorization Passes Committee
When Hurricane Sandy made landfall last year, we knew from our previous
oversight of the recovery process following Hurricane Katrina that the
rebuilding process could drag on, leaving communities frustrated, local
economies devastated, and increased costs for the taxpayer. From my
experience as mayor and your representative during the 2011 landfall of
Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee, I know first-hand that there
are often obstacles to recovery as localities try to work with the
assistance of - and sometimes despite - the federal government.
Therefore, on the first anniversary of Hurricane Sandy, which caused
nearly $70 billion in damages nationally, I joined the House
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in approving the
reauthorization of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
This legislation, H.R. 3300
, is designed to make FEMA
operate more efficiently, be more responsive to states and localities,
and develop a national alert system.
As Chairman of the Economic
Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management Subcommittee, I
cosponsored this important legislation.
H.R. 3300 now heads to the full House of Representatives for a vote.

Main Street Tours
Shamokin, PA
On October 25, I toured Shamokin area businesses and spoke to owners
and residents about their ideas and concerns regarding today's economic
climate.
I was honored to visit Original Italian Pizza (middle right), Beverly's
Florist (bottom right), Coney Island Lunch (top right), the Medicine
Shoppe, and Bader's Furniture Store (bottom left).
Shamokin Mayor George S. Rozinskie (top left) and Councilman William
Milbrand were great hosts and provided helpful insights into the
community's economic needs. For more on this visit, read a great
article from the News Item

Mount Carmel, PA
On November 6, Mount Carmel Mayor Kevin Jones (top left) and other
local officials led me on a tour of South Oak Street businesses.
We visited several local small businesses including the Community
Pharmacy where we met Mount Carmel's local pharmacist, Jose Gonzalo
(top middle), Experts Charm Furniture Store (bottom left), Matlow's
clothing store (bottom right), Mattucci's, and Hollywood Pizza.
Additionally, Mount Carmel Police Chief Todd Owens (top right) had a
moment to discuss safety for community residents and we met Mount
Carmel's fire fighters.
Small towns like Mount Carmel need growing and prosperous downtown
areas to help support stronger communities. Government can help, but in
a limited manner, so entrepreneurs can still thrive.

Northeastern Pennsylvania Education Roundtable
On November 5, I held a roundtable discussion with Northeastern
Pennsylvania higher education leaders from
Luzerne County Community
College, Penn State Hazleton, Misericordia University, Bloomsburg
University, McCann School of Business and Technology, and the
Pennsylvania Association of Private School Administrators.
We discussed several topics pertaining to higher education in
Pennsylvania and across our nation, including the reauthorization of
the Higher Education Act (HEA).
The HEA is the primary federal law
that authorizes our federal student aid programs and contains
requirements for institutions of higher education.
This legislation
expires in 2015, but the Education and the Workforce Committee, of
which I am a member, will likely unveil a renewal bill in the spring of
next year.
Our institutions of higher education are critical to our nation's
economic recovery. In order to grow and support institutions of higher
education, I am committed to reducing federal overreach and regulations
and helping more students graduate with the skills needed for today's
economy.
Combating Gangs Across Our District
On Thursday, November 7, I hosted Operation Gang Up in Harrisburg
alongside state Senator John Yudichak. Operation Gang Up, formed in
2011, connects citizens, law enforcement, and elected officials to help
identify, fight, and prevent the spread of gangs.
Across Pennsylvania - in big cities like Harrisburg and smaller
communities like Hazleton - we are all fighting the same fight to
dismantle, disrupt, and end organized gang activity.
The U.S. Department of Justice's 2011 Eastern Pennsylvania Drug and
Gang Threat Assessment reported that Harrisburg, Lancaster, and Lebanon
have experienced an increase in organized and deliberate drug-related
violence perpetrated by street gangs - and anyone that watches the news
or reads the paper can attest that the increase in gang activity is
significant.
Gangs expand where there are markets available to them, claim
territory, and enforce their boundaries by violence, intimidation, and
graffiti. They adversely affect our communities with the ever-present
threat of violence, increased crime rates, and vandalism - casting a
shadow of fear over neighborhoods.
Our communities need concerted efforts from responsible officials at
every level - federal, state, and local - to forge aggressive
solutions. Therefore, I remain committed to creating a safer America
for our children and grandchildren and will continue to fight against
gang activity in our district and across the Commonwealth.

Legislative Update
Important Vote: The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2013
(WRRDA, H.R. 3080)
On October 23, I supported, and the House passed, WRRDA
by a 417-3 bipartisan vote.
This is a long time coming, and I am pleased that so many members from
both sides of the aisle are in agreement; especially with the 11th
District's proximity to such a major facility as the Port of
Philadelphia.
A vibrant waterway system is vital to our communities
and supports job creation and economic growth.
Historically, Congress has approved waterway bills every two years, but
the last one was signed into law over five years ago in 2007.
This
fiscally responsible bill deauthorizes $12 billion in spending by
requiring the Army Corps of Engineers to take old, inactive studies and
projects off the books, allowing the Corps to pursue its mission of
protecting communities from flood damage and developing and maintaining
ports and waterways.
In addition, the bill streamlines the
environmental review process by bringing study times down from more
than 15 years to a maximum time of three years.
It's important to note that WRRDA also authorizes the Army Corps of
Engineers to recommend improvements for navigation and commerce and
address flood risk management, hurricane and storm damage risk
reduction, and environmental restoration needs. As we learned in 2011
in Northeastern Pennsylvania, Mother Nature can strike at any time with
devastating effect.
This bill will help us make sure our communities
and their residents are protected.
A conference committee is expected to convene to iron out differences
between the House bill and the already-passed Senate version of the
bill.

Letters Sent To:
*	Speaker Boehner urging him to not bring up any
immigration-related bills without a commitment that the House will not
conference any House bills with a comprehensive Senate bill.
*	President Obama asking him to reconsider his budget proposal
which imposes a Medicaid-style price control on Medicare Part D
prescription drugs.

Army is doing to ensure religious freedom is preserved within its ranks.
*	President Obama urging him to focus on helping unemployed
American workers rather than pushing comprehensive immigration reform.
Cosponsored Legislation:
*	American Healthcare Reform Act (H.R. 3121
), which fully repeals the
president's health care law and inserts reforms, including allowing
insurance to be purchased across state lines and enabling small
businesses to pool together to increase their buying power.
*	Each Act (H.R. 1814
), which would expand the
existing religious conscience exemption in the president's health care
law by exempting an individual from the individual mandate if that
person files an affidavit with their income tax return stating they do
not have insurance because of their religious beliefs.
*	Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2013 (H.R. 3279
), which would require that all
plans on Obamacare exchanges disclose whether or not the plan includes

The
House
Keeps
the
President's
Broken
Promise
For
the
last
six
weeks,
Americans
have
been
dealing
with
a
broken
website,
and
even
worse,
a
broken
promise.
President
Obama
repeatedly
pledged
that
&#8220;if
you
like
your
health
care
plan,
you
can
keep
your
health
care
plan.
Period.&#8221;
That
pledge
turned
out
to
be
hollow
as
the
cancellations
began
to
mount.
NBC
News
has
reported
that
the
Obama
Administration
has
known
for
years
it
could
not
keep
the
president&#8217;s
promise
that
people
could
keep
their
existing
coverage.
According
to
the
report,
50
to
75
percent
of
Americans
who
purchase
insurance
in
the
individual
market
can
expect
to
receive
a
cancellation
letter
or
the
equivalent
over
the
next
year.
So
far,
at
least
3.5
million
people
have
seen
health
plans
cancelled
with
the
number
rising
each
day.
This
past
Thursday,
the
president
announced
that
insurance
companies
will
be
permitted
to
continue
to
sell
health
care
policies
previously
barred
by
Obamacare.
This
announcement
is
proof
that
his
healthcare
law
is
inherently
flawed
and
was
sold
with
false
promises.
He
has
essentially
admitted
that
when
he
told
the
American
people
they
could
keep
their
current
health
plans
if
they
liked
them,
&#8216;period,&#8217;
it
simply
wasn&#8217;t
true.
Also,
I
question
the
president&#8217;s
legal
authority
to
make
such
a
change
in
the
law,
which
is
why
I
cosponsored
the
Keep
Your
Health
Plan
Act
(H.R.
3350)
to
keep
his
promise
for
him.
The
Keep
Your
Health
Plan
Act
will
ensure
that
millions
of
Americans
who
have
seen
their
policies
cancelled
under
Obamacare
will
be
able
to
keep
them
in
2014.
Specifically,
this
important
legislation
allows
plans
available
on
the
individual
market
today
to
be
offered
next
year,
providing
millions
the
opportunity
to
keep
their
policies
in
2014.
It
also
would
ensure
that
Americans
keeping
their
plans
would
not
face
a
penalty
under
Obamacare&#8217;s
individual
mandate.
I
suppose
a
lot
of
people
thought
the
president
meant
what
he
said,
which
is
why
this
legislation
is
necessary
&#8211;
to
keep
the
president&#8217;s
promise
after
the
fact.
Too
many
people
are
being
forced
off
their
health
insurance
through
no
fault
of
their
own,
against
the
president&#8217;s
promise,
and
at
a
tremendous
cost
to
themselves
and
their
families.
In
an
effort
to
keep
Obama&#8217;s
broken
promise,
on
November
15,
the

passed
the
Keep

Immigration
Update
During
a
briefing
at
the
National
Press
Club
on
October
30,
the
Center
for
Immigration
Studies
(CIS)
revealed
its
report
that
shows
the
Obama
Administration
is
artificially
inflating
its
claims
of
deporting
illegal
immigrants
in
order
to
move
toward
a
broad
plan
for
amnesty.
Specifically,
the
CIS
report,
titled
&#8220; Deportation
Numbers
Unwrapped ,&#8221;
found
that
more
than
half
of
the
deportations
attributed
to
Immigration
and
Customs
Enforcement
(ICE)
were
the
result
of
border
arrests,
or
&#8220;turn-aways,&#8221;
that
would
never
have
been
counted
as
removals
in
prior
years.
The
number
of
deportations
resulting
from
actual
interior
enforcement
by
ICE
has
fallen
steadily
&#8211;
by
19
percent
from
2011
to
2012,
and
by
22
percent
by
the
end
of
2013.
This
pokes
holes
into
the
false
perception
that
this
administration
is
projecting
that
our
borders
are
more
secure.
I
believe
that
is
nothing
more
than
smoke
and
mirrors
to
set
the
stage
for
an
amnesty
bill.
The
United
States
has
immigration
laws
for
two
main
reasons:
to
protect
national
security
and
to
protect
American
jobs.
Porous
borders
are
a
demonstrable
threat
to
national
security,
as
too
many
terrorist
attacks
and
criminal
cases
have
proven.
Additionally,
granting
amnesty
to
the
estimated
11
million
illegal
immigrants
currently
believed
to
be
present
in
the
United
States
would
flood
labor
markets,
making
it
more
difficult
for
legal
residents
to
find
jobs
while
driving
down
wages.
Whether
it&#8217;s
a
border
security
bill
or
any
immigration
bill,
I
believe
a
&#8216;Pathway
to
Citizenship&#8217;
bill
is
the
wrong
step
for
our
country.
We
don&#8217;t
need
new

now.

Mount
Carmel,

On
November
6,
Mount
Carmel
Mayor
Kevin
Jones
(top

and
other
local
officials
led
me
on
a
tour
of
South
Oak
Street
businesses.
We
visited
several
local
small
businesses
including
the
Community
Pharmacy
where
we
met

Carmel&#8217;s
local
pharmacist,
Jose

Additionally,
Mount

(top

had
a
moment
to
discuss
safety
for
community
residents
and
we
met
Mount
Carmel&#8217;s
fire
fighters.
Small
towns
like
Mount
Carmel
need
growing
and
prosperous
downtown
areas
to
help
support
stronger
communities.
Government
can
help,
but
in
a
limited
manner,
so
entrepreneurs
can
still
thrive.

Northeastern
Pennsylvania
Education
Roundtable
On
November
5,
I
held
a
roundtable
discussion
with
Northeastern
Pennsylvania
higher
education
leaders
from
Luzerne
County
Community
College,
Penn
State
Hazleton,
Misericordia
University,
Bloomsburg
University,
McCann
School
of
Business
and
Technology,
and
the
Pennsylvania
Association
of
Private
School
Administrators.
We
discussed
several
topics
pertaining
to
higher
education
in
Pennsylvania
and
across
our
nation,
including
the
reauthorization
of
the
Higher
Education
Act
(HEA).
The
HEA
is
the
primary
federal
law
that
authorizes
our
federal
student
aid
programs
and
contains
requirements
for
institutions
of
higher
education.
This
legislation
expires
in
2015,
but
the
Education
and
the
Workforce
Committee,
of
which
I
am
a
member,
will
likely
unveil
a
renewal
bill
in
the
spring
of
next
year.
Our
institutions
of
higher
education
are
critical
to
our
nation&#8217;s
economic
recovery.
In
order
to
grow
and
support
institutions
of
higher
education,
I
am
committed
to
reducing
federal
overreach
and
regulations
and
helping
more
students
graduate
with
the
skills
needed
for
today&#8217;s
economy.
Combating
Gangs
Across
Our
District
On
Thursday,
November
7,
I
hosted
Operation
Gang
Up
in
Harrisburg
alongside
state
Senator
John
Yudichak.
Operation
Gang
Up,
formed
in
2011,
connects
citizens,
law
enforcement,
and
elected
officials
to
help
identify,
fight,
and
prevent
the
spread
of
gangs.
Across
Pennsylvania
&#8211;
in
big
cities
like
Harrisburg
and
smaller
communities
like
Hazleton
&#8211;
we
are
all
fighting
the
same
fight
to
dismantle,
disrupt,
and
end
organized
gang
activity.
The
U.S.
Department
of
Justice&#8217;s
2011
Eastern
Pennsylvania
Drug
and
Gang
Threat
Assessment
reported
that
Harrisburg,
Lancaster,
and
Lebanon
have
experienced
an
increase
in
organized
and
deliberate
drug-related
violence
perpetrated
by
street
gangs
&#8211;
and
anyone
that
watches
the
news
or
reads
the
paper
can
attest
that
the
increase
in
gang
activity
is
significant.
Gangs
expand
where
there
are
markets
available
to
them,
claim
territory,
and
enforce
their
boundaries
by
violence,
intimidation,
and
graffiti.
They
adversely
affect
our
communities
with
the
ever-present
threat
of
violence,
increased
crime
rates,
and
vandalism
&#8211;
casting
a
shadow
of
fear
over
neighborhoods.
Our
communities
need
concerted
efforts
from
responsible
officials
at
every
level
&#8211;
federal,
state,
and
local
&#8211;
to
forge
aggressive
solutions.
Therefore,
I
remain
committed
to
creating
a
safer
America
for
our
children
and
grandchildren
and
will
continue
to
fight
against
gang
activity
in
our
district
and
across
the
Commonwealth.

Update Important
Vote:
The
Water
Resources
Reform
and
Development
Act
of
2013
(WRRDA,
H.R.
3080)
On
October
23,
I
supported,
and
the
House
passed,
WRRDA
by
a
417-3
bipartisan
vote.
This
is
a
long
time
coming,
and
I
am
pleased
that
so
many
members
from
both
sides
of
the
aisle
are
in
agreement;
especially
with
the
11th
District&#8217;s
proximity
to
such
a
major
facility
as
the
Port
of
Philadelphia.
A
vibrant
waterway
system
is
vital
to
our
communities
and
supports
job
creation
and
economic
growth.
Historically,
Congress
has
approved
waterway
bills
every
two
years,
but
the
last
one
was
signed
into
law
over
five
years
ago
in
2007.
This
fiscally
responsible
bill
deauthorizes
$12
billion
in
spending
by
requiring
the
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
to
take
old,
inactive
studies
and
projects
off
the
books,
allowing
the
Corps
to
pursue
its
mission
of
protecting
communities
from
flood
damage
and
developing
and
maintaining
ports
and
waterways.
In
addition,
the
bill
streamlines
the
environmental
review
process
by
bringing
study
times
down
from
more
than
15
years
to
a
maximum
time
of
three
years.
It&#8217;s
important
to
note
that
WRRDA
also
authorizes
the
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
to
recommend
improvements
for
navigation
and
commerce
and
address
flood
risk
management,
hurricane
and
storm
damage
risk
reduction,
and
environmental
restoration
needs.
As
we
learned
in
2011
in
Northeastern
Pennsylvania,
Mother
Nature
can
strike
at
any
time
with
devastating
effect.
This
bill
will
help
us
make
sure
our
communities
and
their
residents
are
protected.
A
conference
committee
is
expected
to
convene
to
iron
out
differences
between
the
House
bill
and
the
already-passed
Senate
version
of
the
bill.
