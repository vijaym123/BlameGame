Supporting Our Veterans and Active-Duty Service-Members
This week I voted for the Fiscal Year 2015 Military Construction and
Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill which provides necessary funds for
our military installations and veterans programs.
I remain committed to providing our veterans and service-members with
the benefits, services, and resources they deserve. The constant delays
and inefficient service our veterans receive from the VA is a national
embarrassment. The bill passed by the House this week makes it clear
that funding is not the issue. The VA must take advantage of resources
Congress continues to provide them and implement the modernizing
technology and systems needed to eliminate the benefits backlog. At the
end of the day, we must hold the VA's feet to the fire until meaningful
reforms are made.
The House has also provided critical funding necessary to maintain and
improve the quality of life for active-duty service-members. Our
military housing and medical facilities are relied upon by our military
families on a daily basis and we must ensure that our installations
meet their basic needs.
Here are a few of the amendments that were offered during the debate
that I voted in favor of:
*
An amendment to support a VA Inspector General investigation
into the alleged misconduct at the Phoenix, Arizona VA hospital.
*
An amendment to prohibit funding for the VA to give bonuses to
Senior Executive Service employees.
*
An amendment to prohibit the Department of Defense from closing
any military commissary.
Highlights of the FY15 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs
Appropriations Bill:
Boosting Veterans Programs
*	Fulfills our moral and legal obligations to our veterans,
ensuring they have quality medical care, important job and training
programs, and other benefits they have earned for their service.
*	Increases discretionary funding for veterans programs by $1.5
billion above last year, providing $64.7 billion total for our nation's
veterans.
*	Supports VA medical services at $45 billion, allowing for 6.7
million patients to be treated in FY15.
*	Includes funding for mental health care, suicide prevention,
traumatic brain injury treatment, homeless veteran programs, and rural
health initiatives.
*	Provides a total $158.2 billion in discretionary and mandatory
funding for VA, $10.3 billion above FY14.
Making Our Government Work Better for Vets
*	Continues efforts to end the disability claims processing
backlog by providing $173 million for the paperless claims processing
system.
*	Increases funding for digital scanning of health records,
centralized mail, and overtime by $20 million to by the backlog by 2015.
*	Maintains strict reporting requirements that help track the
performance of each regional office.
*	Demands the timely and accurate exchange of medical data
between VA, DOD and the private sector to ensure veterans get the best
medical care possible.
*	Contains $344 million for the modernization for the VA
electronic health record system.
*	Holds VA and DOD accountable by restricting funding until the
departments demonstrate progress on system's functionality and
interoperability.
*	Increases oversight of taxpayer dollars at the VA by requiring
reports on construction expenditures and savings, and forbidding
changes in scope of construction projects.
Distinguished Flying Cross National Memorial
Earlier this week, the House Armed Services Committee included my
legislation, the Distinguished Flying Cross National Memorial Act (H.R.
330), in the Readiness Subcommittee mark of the FY2015 National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA).
Riverside County plays an important role in honoring our military
heroes and the establishment of the Distinguished Flying Cross National
Memorial will continue that legacy. Distinguished Flying Cross
recipients have received this prestigious medal for their heroism or
extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight while
serving in any capacity with the U.S. Armed Forces. The designation of
the memorial at March Field Air Museum as a national memorial will
ensure that these brave American heroes, their families, and all
admirers of the Distinguished Flying Cross, will have a place to
remember, honor, and pay tribute.
I introduced the Distinguished Flying Cross National Memorial Act on
January 22, 2013. The language in the NDAA can be found on page 25 of
the mark which can be found HERE
