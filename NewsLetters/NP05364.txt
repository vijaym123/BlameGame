Here&rsquo;s our plan to end unfair campaign finance laws.
WE MUST RESTORE FAIR ELECTIONS BY:
1) Closing the loopholes that allow secret money in our elections
2) Amending the Constitution to Overturn
Citizens United
3) Fighting Republican Voter Suppression Efforts
Show John Boehner and his fellow Republicans that we won&rsquo;t let big money dominate our elections. We need 25O,OOO signatures against
Citizens United
signatures before Election Day.
So if you want to be part of this historic movement, don&rsquo;t miss this opportunity. SUPPORTER:
