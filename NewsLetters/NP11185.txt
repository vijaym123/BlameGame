Dear Friend -
Earlier this week I signed a discharge petition demanding that comprehensive immigration reform be brought to a vote. The petition would force a vote on H.R. 15, the bipartisan Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, legislation that would help secure our border, protect our workers, unite our families, provide an earned pathway to citizenship and create jobs.
I signed this petition because enough is enough - the American people demand a vote on comprehensive immigration reform. It&rsquo;s been almost a year since the Senate passed this bipartisan package and report after report has demonstrated the economic imperative of reform.
I am demanding a vote because we&rsquo;ve been saying &lsquo;the time is now&rsquo; for too long. Action on immigration reform is overdue and I am ready to put the pressure on every member to take a stand.
Join the chorus for reform and sign the
#DemandAVote
Petition here:
