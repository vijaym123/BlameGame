Dear Neighbor,
Happy New Year! As we welcome in 2014, it&rsquo;s important to look back on 2013 and see all that we&rsquo;ve
accomplished
together as a community. Our greatest success comes when we&rsquo;re able to unite communities and make our shared goals the priority. Moving across the district, from Chautauqua to Tompkins counties and everywhere in between, here are a few successes that stand out in my mind:
Partnering with local and state officials and residents to keep the
NRG facility
and the jobs it supports in Dunkirk.
Maintaining the unmatched services, resources and staff at the
Elmira Psychiatric Center . The center has a long history as a cost-effective, high-quality provider of mental health services and I am thrilled it will be able to continue providing that care.
Working with the
FAA and Corning Hospital
to expedite construction and allow the hospital project completion to stay on schedule.
Our work with countless advocacy groups to advance bills supporting our local hospitals:
HELP Hospice Act ,
Rural Hospital Access Act , Personalize Your Care Act and Palliative Care and Hospice Education Training Act.
Being a voice for
local manufacturers
in Washington as co-chair of the
House Manufacturing Caucus .
Strengthening our cancer research ability with the
Clinical Trial Cancer Mission 2020
legislation with the help of a good friend, Gary Mervis of Camp Good Days and Special Times.
What did you see as successes in the 23 rd
district in 2013? What would you like to see the district achieve in the New Year? I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to meet with many of you this year around the district and some of the most valuable feedback comes from those informal sit downs. Looking forward to many more of those conversations in 2014.
Wishing you and your family a healthy and happy New Year,
Tom
