Statement on the 2015 State of the Union
Address
1/20/15
Today, Congressman Doug
Lamborn released the following statement in response to President Obama's
State of the Union Address.
"I am very disappointed that the President has decided to go it alone
and not offer to work with the new Congress. Instead of offering sound
fiscal plans, the President decided to double down on failed liberal
policies. There were no serious plans put forward to strengthen our
national security or to assist our brave veterans. His economic
proposals show that he is more interested in being Santa Claus than being a
skeptical steward of our out-of-control debt and deficit. The President
should be more responsible with his rhetoric. By misleading citizens
into thinking that he can wave a magic wand and dole out hundreds of
millions of dollars in government giveaways and new entitlements, he is
creating a false impression that will lead to more broken promises and
gridlocked government."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn (CO-05)
