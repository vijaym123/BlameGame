Friends,
We're all too familiar with the frustration
of rising prices at the pump. With many Ohio families hitting the road
this holiday weekend, I want to tell you about some of the things I'm
working on with my colleagues here in the House to curb energy prices
and ease the burden on your budgets.
In order to bring
down energy prices here at home, we must produce more of our own energy
and stop relying on foreign sources.
Check out this
video
for a personal message from me about some of the
opportunities we have to boost America's energy independence:
It's an
honor to serve you, and I remain committed to doing everything I can to
create a stronger economic future for Northeast Ohio and our
country.
Wishing you and your family a safe and enjoyable Fourth
of July weekend celebrating this great
nation!
Sincerely,
Dave
