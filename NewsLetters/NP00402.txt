Bipartisan action plan
Dear Friend,
Over the course of this past week I was able to attend the Detroit Regional Chamber Mackinac Policy Conference on Mackinac Island. This conference is a yearly opportunity to talk with fellow Michiganders about important issues that matter most to those right here in Southwest Michigan.
On Wednesday, I joined my colleague Senator Debbie Stabenow, D-Lansing, to unveil a Bipartisan Action Plan for a Brighter Michigan.
Under our leadership, the entire Michigan Congressional Delegation has been meeting regularly to discuss ways we in Washington can improve the lives of everyone here at home. Its also a good way to get to know our fellow Michigan legislators better and it opens the door to all sorts of bipartisan cooperation that produces real results for Michigan.
From working together on issues like fighting
Asian Carp ,
banning synthetic plastic microbeads
that pollute our Great Lakes, working to
protect and expand
our military and defense installations, making sure that Michigan stays on the
cutting edge
of medical innovations, and working to create local jobs and a stronger Michigan economy we are better positioned to succeed when we work together.
You hear a lot about dysfunction in Washington
but the Michigan Congressional Delegation remains ever-committed to putting the needs of everyone in our state above party politics and working to get the job done for you.
When both sides of the aisle and both sides of the U.S. Capitol come together to maximize Michigans voice and impact
we can certainly accomplish a great deal. Thats what our bipartisan action plan for a brighter Michigan is all about.
