Rep. Miller Statement on the House Passage of the Farm Bill
Jan 29, 2014
WASHINGTON &#8211; U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10) today issued a statement regarding the House passage of the bipartisan,
bicameral agreement on a five-year farm bill that will reduce the deficit, grow the economy and provide certainty to the 16 million Americans whose jobs depend on agriculture.
The Agricultural Act of 2014 (H.R.2642), or farm bill, contains major reforms including
eliminating the direct payment program, streamlining and consolidating numerous programs to improve their effectiveness and reduce duplication, and cutting down on program misuse.
The bill also strengthens our nation&#8217;s commitment to support farmers and ranchers
affected by natural disasters or significant economic losses, and renew a national commitment to protect land, water, and other natural resources.
Miller said:
&#8220;For the last several years, I have been listening to and working closely with farmers who I am so proud to represent to work toward the passage of a farm bill that meets the needs of Michigan agriculture.
Today, I was proud to vote in favor of a bill that
will help make certain that the American and Michigan agriculture sector continues to lead and feed our nation and the world.
&#8220;The farm bill repeals direct payments to farmers and enhances risk management tools that will help make our farmers even
more competitive.
The bill also repeals or consolidates nearly 100 outdated or duplicative federal programs and reduces regulatory barriers for new investment to help our economy grow.
&#8220;I am also pleased that this bill makes commonsense reforms to the food stamp program, including ending loop holes that
have been used to offer benefits to people who do not qualify because of their income, ending the practice of federal advertising in foreign nations to recruit non-citizens into the food stamp program, and ensuring that food stamp recipients do not receive
benefits in multiple states.
While I hoped that more could have been done, these are certainly steps in the right direction and the first major reforms of this program in nearly 20 years.
&#8220;The best news for taxpayers is that the reforms included in this farm bill will save $23 billion in mandatory federal
spending compared to current law.
I am very thankful for the thoughtful insight that I received from farmers from across my district on this important legislation and I am glad that our state&#8217;s second largest industry has certainty that will help them continue
to grow our economy and create jobs we so desperately need.&#8221;
