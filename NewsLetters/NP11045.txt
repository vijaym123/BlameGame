I&rsquo;d like to share with you some of what I&rsquo;ve been working on in Tennessee and Washington this past month:
Celebrating East Tennessee&rsquo;s Smoky Mountain heritage
On March 3, I welcomed U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell to Tennessee for the unveiling of construction plans for the Joint Curatorial Collections Facility that will be built in Townsend, Tenn. This facility will house more than 800,000 historical artifacts and archival records, including the possessions of families that lived on farmland that eventually became part of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. After all these years, the curatorial facility is an opportunity to celebrate the way of life of those mountain families.

Supporting the right of Tennessee workers to choose not to join a union
The United Auto Workers has appealed a decision by workers at Volkswagen&rsquo;s Chattanooga plant not to unionize, even though labor laws are written to allow employees to decide whether they want a union, not to ensure that unions win. For 30 years, tens of thousands of new auto jobs have raised Tennessee family incomes, and our workers have decided in almost every case that they are better off union-free. The UAW may not like this, but that&rsquo;s the right of employees in a right-to-work state like Tennessee, and I plan to continue defending that right.
Introducing legislation to reimburse states for reopening national parks during the government shutdown
On March 11, Senator Corker and I joined a bipartisan group of senators in introducing legislation to reimburse states for funds used to reopen national parks while the federal government was shut down last October. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park closing was like a BP oil spill for the Gulf, especially for places like Sevier and Blount counties, where the success of many small businesses relies upon our country&rsquo;s most visited national park. The park shouldn&rsquo;t have been closed in the first place, and Tennesseans certainly shouldn&rsquo;t have to foot the bill to have it reopened.

Visiting with Watertown Elementary students and Boy Scout supporters in Wilson County
On Feb. 24, I spoke to students at Watertown Elementary about the importance of education. I also told them the story of my late friend Alex Haley, the author of
Roots . Afterward, I had the opportunity to present the school with an American flag that had flown over the U.S. Capitol.
Later that same day, I spoke before the Wilson County Friends of Scouting in Lebanon. I told them about my own days as a Boy Scout, hiking in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park where I grew up and learning lessons about responsibility, honesty &ndash; and how to fend off bears!
Fighting to help Americans climb the economic ladder &ndash; and against wasteful spending and burdens on business
Feb. 17 was the five-year anniversary of President Obama&rsquo;s so-called stimulus plan, and after all this time it&rsquo;s clear a better plan would have been to get Washington out of the way. Today, Democrats in Congress are still pushing for more spending and more burdens on businesses, when we should be providing real answers to income inequality that enable more Americans to climb the economic ladder. That means liberating our free enterprise system from Obamacare and other burdensome regulations that prevent businesses from creating new jobs, providing more job training to the unemployed and expanding school choice for 11 million low-income children to help them attend a better school and move up from the back of the line to the front of the line.

Calling on President Obama to do more to fix our $17 trillion federal debt
President Obama proposed a 10-year budget that never balances, and that adds about $8 trillion to the federal debt over the next 10 years. He also failed to include a more accurate measure of inflation for adjusting entitlement spending and tax rates &ndash; known as the chained Consumer Price Index &ndash; a simple, fair way he&rsquo;d proposed last year to help fix the federal debt. If we don&rsquo;t make tough decisions now and do more to fix our $17 trillion federal debt, we&rsquo;ll have let America slip from the hands of the &ldquo;greatest generation&rdquo; to the &ldquo;debt-paying generation&rdquo; with nothing to show for it but the bill. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve introduced the Fiscal Sustainability Act with Senator Corker.
