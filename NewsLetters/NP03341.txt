Take the survey &gt;&gt;
David,
President Obama's delivering his State of the Union address tonight. Republicans might control Congress for the next two years, but as Democrats, we can&rsquo;t back down from our fight for the middle class.
Will you tell us what you want the President to focus on during his speech tonight?
Please select an issue below:
Fight for equal pay &gt;&gt;
End Citizens United &gt;&gt;
Stand up for our veterans &gt;&gt;
Create American jobs &gt;&gt;
Protect Medicare/Social Security &gt;&gt;
Something else? Let us know &gt;&gt;
It&rsquo;s critical we get as many responses as possible before President Obama delivers the State of the Union tonight.
So please David, fill out our survey today: http://action.cheribustos.com/Survey
Look forward to reading your responses!
