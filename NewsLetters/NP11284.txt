NOT A SUBSCRIBER?
Dear Constituents,
Some of
the most often asked questions constituents pose to me are (1) how to
best address our national debt, (2) what should be cut from the federal
budget, (3) how should we balance the varying needs of the American
people, and (4) what investments should we be making for our collective
future?
Im inviting you to a federal budget
workshop which Im hosting with two nationally respected nonpartisan
organizations, the
Concord Coalition
and
Fix the Debt
at
the Campbell Community Center on Friday, March
28th.
The Concord Coalition is a nationwide, non-partisan grassroots
organization that educates the public about different causes and
consequences of federal budget decisions. Fix the Debt is a non-partisan
movement to put America on a better fiscal and economic
path.
Attendees will work in small groups to examine a variety of fiscal
policy alternatives. Importantly, they will also have an opportunity to
share their ideas on how to improve the nations long-term fiscal
outlook.
Im excited about hosting this workshop with the
Concord Coalition and Fix the Debt, and hearing first-hand from my
constituents about their budget priorities. There are many factors involved
in creating a national budget and this is a unique opportunity for
you to learn and participate.
The workshop will be
held on Friday, March 28th from 10:30 a.m. to Noon at the Campbell
Community Center located at 1 West Campbell Avenue in Campbell. Please
RSVP here , or call my Palo Alto office at (650)
323-2984.
I hope to see you on March
28th.
Sincerely,
Anna G. Eshoo
Member of
Congress
