A
Thanksgiving Message
Dear
Friends:
As an Army and a Marine Corps veteran with
five overseas deployments, I know that is not the case in so many other
parts of the world.
In too many countries, a difference of
political opinion or religious conviction is paid for in blood.
I also know what its like to be away from family members
during long deployments and my heart goes out to the many servicemen and
women who are currently stationed overseas
over 50,000 are in
Afghanistan alone
and will not be able to spend this joyous holiday with
their families and loved ones.
And so on
Thanksgiving we sit down with my family to give thanks for our many
blessings, let us pause to remember those whose sense of duty and
commitment keeps them away from their families.
Thank you, God
bless, and Happy Thanksgiving.
Sincerely,
Mike Coffman
U.S. Representative

Three Colo. U.S. Reps Oppose Iran Nuclear
Deal
By Mark Stricherz
The Colorado
Observer
Published November 26, 2013
WASHINGTON
Two Colorado House members said they
oppose the Obama administrations Iranian nuclear deal. But neither has
taken the extra step of vowing to sink the agreement by supporting
legislation that would impose even tougher sanctions on
Tehran.
In a
sharply-worded statement ,
Rep. Mike
Coffman
(R-Aurora) suggested the accord was
misguided.
The only way to get the Iranians to stop developing a nuclear
weapon is to promote regime change and the best way to do that is to
make the economic sanctions much tougher, not weaker, said
Coffman.
The Iranian government must be forced into a position of
choosing whether to retain power and give up their nuclear ambitions or
lose power as a consequence of their economy completely collapsing,
Coffman added.
Rep. Cory Gardner (R-Yuma) said the deal was
disturbing
and vowed to seek stronger curbs on Irans nuclear
ambitions.
Six months from now when this temporary deal has
expired, Irans incentive to walk away from the negotiating table or
demand new concessions will be higher than ever. I applaud my Senate
colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have said they plan on working
on tougher sanctions when the return in December, he said in a
statement.
A spokesman for Rep. Doug Lamborn said the Colorado
Springs Republican was wary of the agreement.
Bottom line,
its a bad deal, interim spokesperson Justin Johnson said in a phone
interview. Certainly (he) doesnt think it does anything that would
stop Irans nuclear program. We give them real relief in exchange for
no corrective changes to their ability to develop enriched
uranium.
Spokespeople for Senators Mark Udall and Michael Bennet as
well as the other five members of the Colorado congressional delegation
did not respond to a phone call or email message for
comment.
The accord gives Iran a suspension from economic sanctions Western
countries have imposed on it and affirms the countrys right to enrich
uranium, a key material in making a nuclear bomb. In exchange, the
country is required to halt its heavy-water reactor facility, allow
inspectors to police its nuclear facilities, and stop installing new
centrifuges.
Secretary of State John Kerry played a key role in
brokering the agreement with Iran and five Western nations in Geneva,
Switzerland over the weekend. But Kerry and President Obama have come
under criticism from Israel and several Republican and Democratic
leaders for ceding too many concessions to Iran.
Sen. Robert
Menendez (D-N.J.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
said the agreement does not proportionally reduce Irans nuclear
program for the relief it is receiving.
Rep. Ed Royce (R-Ca.),
chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said Kerry should
soon come before the committee to discuss the man concerns with this
agreement.
Yet few in Congress have called for scrapping
the diplomatic accord right away. Torpedoing the agreement would be
unlikely in any case. Both chambers of Congress would need to muster a
two-thirds majority for increasing sanctions against Iran if Obama
vetoed the legislation.
Menendez said his panel is considering
legislation that would increase economic sanctions on Tehran if talks
to halt the countrys nuclear program collapse.
Congress has
been on Thanksgiving recess since last Friday and is not scheduled to
return until early next month.
