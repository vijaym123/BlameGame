It's
the most wonderful time of the year
With the kids jingle
belling
And everyone telling you "Be of good cheer"
It's the most
wonderful time of the year
-Andy Williams, Its the
Most Wonderful Time of the Year
This song by Andy Williams
sums up how many of us feel about the Christmas season.
It truly is
the most wonderful time of the year.
Our spirits seem lifted
during this season as we all work to spread holiday cheer to those
around us.
Children eagerly anticipate this time of
year because of the gifts they look forward to receiving.
During
the Christmas season it is important for us to focus on the ultimate
gift, the birth of Jesus Christ.
This gift is the reason we
celebrate this special time of year.
This time of
the year many of us reflect on how we can be a better friend and
neighbor to all.
The Christmas season gives us a great opportunity to
spread love and well wishes to all those around us and to those who
are less fortunate in our communities.
Let us also give
thanks once again for our Armed Services.
Many men and women in
uniform will not be able to celebrate this special time of year with their
families because they are abroad protecting our
freedom.
May the peace and joy of Christmas be with you and your families on
Christmas day and throughout the New Year!
