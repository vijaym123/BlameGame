Reflecting on D-Day 70 Years
Later
Friday marked the 70th Anniversary of the
D-Day invasion when our brave troops and Allied Forces stormed the beaches of
Normandy. I'm humbled by their bravery and sacrifice. If you have the
opportunity, thank a veteran.

On Bergdahl
Swap: The White House Must Consult Congress
It
was a week of mixed feelings for many Americans as we received word
that U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl would finally return home to his
family after years in Taliban captivity. An American soldier coming home is
a cause for celebration, but unfortunately, as the details and
conditions of his release came to light, cause for concern arose among many.
Earlier this week, I wrote an op-ed in Fox News detailing my concerns
over the deal and President Obama's choice to bypass Congress. You

Assisting
Veterans with the VA
Helping veterans in
my district get the care that they deserve is one of my highest
priorities. After learning of cases across the country of improper
treatment of patients and mismanagement at Veterans Affairs hospitals, my
office set up an email account dedicated specifically to assisting
constituents with issues they may encounter with the VA. The email address
VAHelp@mail.house.gov is live and will be regularly checked by my staff
to assist constituents and help expedite cases if necessary. You can
read more about my efforts
