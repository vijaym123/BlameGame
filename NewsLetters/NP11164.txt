I was recently asked to give the Weekly National Address for the
Republicans. I chose to talk about jobs and opportunity and laid out
seven ways to get the economy back on track. When I talk to Ohioans
about their concerns, whether it is a mom from Richland County who
joined us on a teletownhall recently or an autoworker I met at a plant
in Toledo earlier this month, one issue is always at the top of the
list-jobs.
Watch the Weekly Republican Address here
.
The experts tell us the recession ended five years ago, but the
American people are still digging out of the hole it left behind. We're
living through the weakest economic recovery since World War II, and a
lot of folks are struggling to make ends meet.
Take the last national jobs report. It's a testament to how low
expectations have become that this month's jobs report was cheered by
some in the media. The unemployment rate actually rose to 6.7 percent,
and only 175,000 jobs were created, far fewer than the number we need
to start turning things around, and nowhere near enough to help those
who have been looking for a job for months and even years. In fact, the
number of long-term unemployed actually increased by 203,000 in
February-significantly more than the number of new jobs created.
But these statistics only tell half the story. We are told that eleven
million Americans have become so discouraged that they've given up
looking for work altogether.
Poverty rates have gone up, salaries have gone down, with the average
family now bringing home $4,000 less than they did just five years ago.
The wealthy are doing just fine in the Obama economy. Wall Street is
thriving. It's Main Street that's struggling. With paychecks down and
the cost of healthcare, college education, and a tank of gas going up,
a Middle Class squeeze is strangling a lot of American Dreams.
What has been tried-record levels of spending heading to record levels
of debt and more government rather than more pro-growth policies to
free up the private sector-hasn't worked.
Now the President wants to double down on policies that we've seen
fail. His budget earlier this month asked for hundreds of billions in
new government spending and over a trillion in new, job-killing taxes.
That is not a path to prosperity. Tax and spend hasn't worked to get
America moving again for the last five years of this presidency, and it
won't work now.
Some have said we just have to get
used to weak economic growth, that it's the "new normal." I refuse to
accept that we are powerless in the face of fewer people working,
smaller middle-class paychecks, bigger government, never-ending
deficits, and record debt piled on our kids and grandkids.
I think we need a new approach, one that puts our trust back in the
American people, not in more and bigger government.
That's what the Jobs for America
plan I am proposing in the United
States Senate will do. This seven point blueprint will help bring back
opportunity, spark an economic recovery, and restore to every American
a shot at the American Dream.
Our plan calls for commonsense reform that repeals Obamacare and
replaces it with solutions that make it is easier for employers to hire
while providing competition and choice to lower healthcare costs. It
also proposes sensible spending restraint to address the record debt
and deficit that are dragging down the economy and mortgaging the
future of our kids and grandkids.
It includes tax reform that encourages innovation and investment in
American workers and American companies, rather than projects and
corporations overseas. It argues for sensible regulatory reform that
makes it easier for businesses to grow and hire new workers, as well as
export promotion to open new markets for job creators. It also proposes
reforms to the federal government's worker retraining programs to help
give unemployed Ohioans the skills they need to fill open jobs in Ohio,
and it calls for an energy policy that makes us less dependent on
foreign oil and uses American resources to ensure reliable and
affordable energy.
All of these proposals will help give the job market the jumpstart it
needs so that we can get our economy moving again and get Americans
back in good jobs.
These are commonsense, job-creating measures, and we will fight to make
them law. And when we do, I believe we'll see unemployment rates drop,
we'll see incomes rise, and we'll see the gap between the rich and the
poor close, not because we are bringing people down but because we are
bringing people up.
And we will see that America's best days are still ahead of us.
This month's example of government waste may surprise you. When a
federal employee retires, you would think the processing of the
retirement benefits is performed electronically in some office in
Washington, D.C.
But actually, retirements are processed in Boyers, Pennsylvania almost
entirely by hand by 600 federal employees in an abandoned mine 230 feet
underground - at a cost of $56 million annually.
This same facility
houses the processing of background investigations for security
clearances. This labor and paperwork intensive system has led to rising
costs, now over $1 billion annually. Quality issues are also a concern,
particularly 660,000 investigations in recent years that, according to
an Inspector General and the Department of Justice, lacked proper
quality review and resulted in the granting of security clearances to
the likes of Aaron Alexis, the Navy Yard shooter.
We call our monthly examples of waste, 'Your Tax Dollars Down the
Drain,' but never once thought we would talk about an underground
operation. They say that sunlight is the best disinfectant to wasteful
spending, and that may actually be the case here. At a time of record
debt, it's irresponsible to have such an inefficient and costly process
in place for federal workers. Just last week, I sent a member of my
staff to visit the Boyers facility to get a firsthand look at how we
can improve processes and technology to decrease costs, while also
improving quality and timeliness - putting taxpayers' hard-earned
dollars to better use.
The inefficient retirement system was recently investigated by the
Washington Post
. In 1960, the federal government was looking
for an enormous place to store and process tens of thousands of files,
and settled on an abandoned underground limestone mine in rural
Pennsylvania. Here, federal employees, surrounded by 28,000 filing
cabinets spread across multiple caverns, process 100,000 annual federal
retirements by hand. And they do it in a mine so far under the ground
that any warm food must be delivered because an open flame in a
cavernous hole 230 feet underground could be catastrophic.
In an effort to modernize this system, speed up retirement processing,
reduce the error rate, and save taxpayer funds, I joined several of my
colleagues in a letter to the Director of the Office of Personnel
Management requesting a detailed plan to improve the retirement
processing system.

I
was
recently
asked
to
give
the
Weekly
National
Address
for
the
Republicans.
I
chose
to
talk
about
jobs
and
opportunity
and
laid
out
seven
ways
to
get
the
economy
back
on
track.
When
I
talk
to
Ohioans
about
their
concerns,
whether
it
is
a
mom
from
Richland
County
who
joined
us
on
a
teletownhall
recently
or
an
autoworker
I
met
at
a
plant
in
Toledo
earlier
this
month,
one
issue
is
always
at
the
top
of
the
list&#8212;jobs.
Watch the
Weekly
Republican
Address
here .
The
experts
tell
us
the
recession
ended
five
years
ago,
but
the
American
people
are
still
digging
out
of
the
hole
it
left
behind.
We&#8217;re
living
through
the
weakest
economic
recovery
since
World
War
II,
and
a
lot
of
folks
are
struggling
to
make
ends
meet.
Take
the
last
national
jobs
report.
It&#8217;s
a
testament
to
how
low
expectations
have
become
that
this
month&#8217;s
jobs
report
was
cheered
by
some
in
the
media.
The
unemployment
rate
actually
rose
to
6.7
percent,
and
only
175,000
jobs
were
created,
far
fewer
than
the
number
we
need
to
start
turning
things
around,
and
nowhere
near
enough
to
help
those
who
have
been
looking
for
a
job
for
months
and
even
years.
In
fact,
the
number
of
long-term
unemployed
actually
increased
by
203,000
in
February&#8212;significantly
more
than
the
number
of
new
jobs
created.
But
these
statistics
only
tell
half
the
story.
We
are
told
that
eleven
million
Americans
have
become
so
discouraged
that
they&#8217;ve
given
up
looking
for
work
altogether.
Poverty
rates
have
gone
up,
salaries
have
gone
down,
with
the
average
family
now
bringing
home
$4,000
less
than
they
did
just
five
years
ago.
The
wealthy
are
doing
just
fine
in
the
Obama
economy.
Wall
Street
is
thriving.
It&#8217;s
Main
Street
that&#8217;s
struggling.
With
paychecks
down
and
the
cost
of
healthcare,
college
education,
and
a
tank
of
gas
going
up,
a
Middle
Class
squeeze
is
strangling
a
lot
of
American
Dreams.
What
has
been
tried&#8212;record
levels
of
spending
heading
to
record
levels
of
debt
and
more
government
rather
than
more
pro-growth
policies
to
free
up
the
private
sector&#8212;hasn&#8217;t
worked.
Now
the
President
wants
to
double
down
on
policies
that
we&#8217;ve
seen
fail.
His
budget
earlier
this
month
asked
for
hundreds
of
billions
in
new
government
spending
and
over
a
trillion
in
new,
job-killing
taxes.
That
is
not
a
path
to
prosperity.
Tax
and
spend
hasn&#8217;t
worked
to
get
America
moving
again
for
the
last
five
years
of
this
presidency,
and
it
won&#8217;t
work
now.
Some
have
said
we
just
have
to
get
used
to
weak
economic
growth,
that
it&#8217;s
the
&#8220;new
normal.&#8221;
I
refuse
to
accept
that
we
are
powerless
in
the
face
of
fewer
people
working,
smaller
middle-class
paychecks,
bigger
government,
never-ending
deficits,
and
record
debt
piled
on
our
kids
and
grandkids.
I
think
we
need
a
new
approach,
one
that
puts
our
trust
back
in
the
American
people,
not
in
more
and
bigger
government.
That&#8217;s
what
the
Jobs
for
America
plan
I
am
proposing
in
the
United
States
Senate
will
do.
This
seven
point
blueprint
will
help
bring
back
opportunity,
spark
an
economic
recovery,
and
restore
to
every
American
a
shot
at
the
American
Dream.
Our
plan
calls
for
commonsense
reform
that
repeals
Obamacare
and
replaces
it
with
solutions
that
make
it
is
easier
for
employers
to
hire
while
providing
competition
and
choice
to
lower
healthcare
costs.
It
also
proposes
sensible
spending
restraint
to
address
the
record
debt
and
deficit
that
are
dragging
down
the
economy
and
mortgaging
the
future
of
our
kids
and
grandkids.
It
includes
tax
reform
that
encourages
innovation
and
investment
in
American
workers
and
American
companies,
rather
than
projects
and
corporations
overseas.
It
argues
for
sensible
regulatory
reform
that
makes
it
easier
for
businesses
to
grow
and
hire
new
workers,
as
well
as
export
promotion
to
open
new
markets
for
job
creators.
It
also
proposes
reforms
to
the
federal
government&#8217;s
worker
retraining
programs
to
help
give
unemployed
Ohioans
the
skills
they
need
to
fill
open
jobs
in
Ohio,
and
it
calls
for
an
energy
policy
that
makes
us
less
dependent
on
foreign
oil
and
uses
American
resources
to
ensure
reliable
and
affordable
energy.
All
of
these
proposals
will
help
give
the
job
market
the
jumpstart
it
needs
so
that
we
can
get
our
economy
moving
again
and
get
Americans
back
in
good
jobs.
These
are
commonsense,
job-creating
measures,
and
we
will
fight
to
make
them
law.
And
when
we
do,
I
believe
we&#8217;ll
see
unemployment
rates
drop,
we&#8217;ll
see
incomes
rise,
and
we&#8217;ll
see
the
gap
between
the
rich
and
the
poor
close,
not
because
we
are
bringing
people
down
but
because
we
are
bringing
people
up.
And
we
will
see
that
America&#8217;s
best
days
are
still
ahead
of
us.
This
month&#8217;s
example
of
government
waste
may
surprise
you.
When
a
federal
employee
retires,
you
would
think
the
processing
of
the
retirement
benefits
is
performed
electronically
in
some
office
in
Washington,
D.C.
But
actually,
retirements
are
processed
in
Boyers,
Pennsylvania
almost
entirely
by
hand
by
600
federal
employees
in
an
abandoned
mine
230
feet
underground
&#8211;
at
a
cost
of
$56
million
annually.
This
same
facility
houses
the
processing
of
background
investigations
for
security
clearances.
This
labor
and
paperwork
intensive
system
has
led
to
rising
costs,
now
over
$1
billion
annually.
Quality
issues
are
also
a
concern,
particularly
660,000
investigations
in
recent
years
that,
according
to
an
Inspector
General
and
the
Department
of
Justice,
lacked
proper
quality
review
and
resulted
in
the
granting
of
security
clearances
to
the
likes
of
Aaron
Alexis,
the
Navy
Yard
shooter.
We
call
our
monthly
examples
of
waste,
&#8216;Your
Tax
Dollars
Down
the
Drain,&#8217;
but
never
once
thought
we
would
talk
about
an
underground
operation.
They
say
that
sunlight
is
the
best
disinfectant
to
wasteful
spending,
and
that
may
actually
be
the
case
here.
At
a
time
of
record
debt,
it&#8217;s
irresponsible
to
have
such
an
inefficient
and
costly
process
in
place
for
federal
workers.
Just
last
week,
I
sent
a
member
of
my
staff
to
visit
the
Boyers
facility
to
get
a
firsthand
look
at
how
we
can
improve
processes
and
technology
to
decrease
costs,
while
also
improving
quality
and
timeliness
&#8211;
putting
taxpayers&#8217;
hard-earned
dollars
to
better
use.
The
inefficient
retirement
system
was
recently
investigated
by
the
Washington
Post .
In
1960,
the
federal
government
was
looking
for
an
enormous
place
to
store
and
process
tens
of
thousands
of

and
settled
on
an
abandoned
underground
limestone
mine
in
rural
Pennsylvania.
Here,
federal

surrounded
by
28,000
filing
cabinets
spread
across
multiple
caverns,
process
100,000
annual
federal
retirements
by
hand.
And
they
do
it
in
a
mine
so
far
under
the
ground
that
any
warm
food
must
be
delivered
because
an
open
flame
in
a
cavernous
hole
230
feet
underground
could
be
catastrophic.
In
an
effort
to
modernize
this
system,
speed
up
retirement
processing,
reduce
the
error
rate,
and
save
taxpayer
funds,
I
