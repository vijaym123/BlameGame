I&rsquo;ve been emailing you a lot lately.
I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;ve had to do that. But David, I&rsquo;m doing everything I can to defeat Boehner this November.
Today, Boehner launches a $30 million ad blitz against Democrats. And Republican outside groups like the Kochs are already outspending us 2-to-1. We can't win if we keep getting outspent like that.
The only way to close the gap is if you step up now. The mid-month fundraising deadline is this week, and we&rsquo;re still coming up 46,915 donations short. Please, can I count on you now?
