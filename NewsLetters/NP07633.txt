Dear
Friend,
Job creation is consistently
the top issue I hear from people as I travel around Wisconsin. One
step Congress can take to create good jobs is to pass a transportation
bill that replenishes the Highway Trust Fund, which pays for
job-creating transportation projects that repair our aging
infrastructure.
The funding authorization is about to run out of money. But
instead of kicking the can down the road with a short-term patch, Im
calling on Congress to cancel the annual August recess and stay in
Washington until we can craft a long-term plan to invest in our nations
roads, bridges, and workforce.
Our transportation needs are
urgent, and there is no dispute that we can put people back to work
if we act now. States were promised that this money would be available
to fund their most pressing transportation needs, but without
congressional action, projects could be abandoned. Failing to act would result
in the delay of more than 100,000 transportation projects, putting up
to 700,000 construction jobs at risk nationwide.
In
response, the House just passed an inadequate 10-month fix to the problem,
meaning were going to confront this issue again next year. This is
no way for Congress to operate when the safety of our roads and the
health of our economy are on the line.
Enough is enough.
Congress has extended this funding 21 times in the past 11 years; we
cant keep having the same debate over and over again. The decision wont
get any easier in 10 months or in a lame-duck session after the
November elections. And once we enter into the presidential election season,
it will be almost impossible to move forward on a long-term,
comprehensive funding solution, which is what we desperately
need.
According to the Council of Economic Advisors, one dollar in public
investment outlays produces 15 times as much economic activity as the
same dollar spent on business tax incentives. Business tax incentives
have their place to spur economic growth, but increased infrastructure
spending should be an easy area of compromise.
Many of
my colleagues on the other side of the aisle agree with me that we need
a six-year transportation bill, and we still have time to get this
done. Lets stay in Washington and work together on a long-term plan
that invests in our nations infrastructure and
workforce.
