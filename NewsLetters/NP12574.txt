An Update on Flood Insurance Reform
Friends-
Over the last several months, I've been working to provide flood insurance relief to homeowners by delaying drastic increases and enacting more compassionate reforms than the ones homeowners currently face. I also believe we must continue holding FEMA accountable for the flawed and inconsistent way the agency is implementing Biggert-Waters 2012.
Since I first introduced legislation last year to address these issues, the momentum for flood insurance reform has been building. Right now, I am working closely with House leadership to bring legislation to a vote on the House floor. I co-authored the language for a delay that was signed into law with the recent budget bill. And the Senate recently acted on measures to further delay rates.
Flood insurance relief is on the way.
There are those who continue to say this is only a problem for wealthy, waterfront homeowners. There are those who say it is reasonable for rates to increase drastically overnight. There are those who say that flood insurance increases won't have a real impact on the real estate market.
These are all
myths
that I will continue to challenge as we work to address this real issue facing veterans, teachers, retirees, and shipbuilders living in South Mississippi.
Recently I took to the House floor to address these myths. You can watch my remarks by clicking on the video below.
As always, I welcome your feedback, and I encourage you to connect using my

In Your Service,
Congressman Steven Palazzo
