Dear Friends,
As you may know, the House
voted yes this week to authorize efforts to stop the Islamic State of
Iraq and the Levant (known as ISIL or ISIS). I'd like to share with
you my thoughts on why I voted yes.
The group known as the
Islamic State, ISIL and ISIS has shown a bloodthirsty determination to
kidnap, torture and terrorize, proving itself to be a clear threat to
peace worldwide. As a nation, we must respond boldly to the threat
that this group poses to America and our allies around the world. We must
work with our allies to stop ISIL from spreading its hate, terror and
malicious words and deeds.
I joined my fellow members of
Congress in asking the president to present a plan to combat and halt
ISILs actions. While the presidents plan is not perfect, it is the
only current proposal that would take action against the serious threat
that ISIL poses. For that reason, I voted to provide the
president temporary authorization to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels,
subject to robust congressional oversight.
The authorization
was offered as an amendment to H.J.Res. 124, the continuing
resolution to fund the federal government until Dec. 11, 2014. While I may
disagree with the continued practice of short-term bills, it is important
that we move forward and work on a funding agreement for the rest of
the fiscal year.
The Senate has passed the continuing
resolution (with the attached authorization on the Islamic State), and the
president is expected to sign it into law shortly.
SHELLEY RILEY MOORE
Many of you have reached out to share your
support and thoughtful words about the life of our mother,
Shelley Riley Moore, and I want to thank you for your kind thoughts.
She was a compassionate and affectionate mother who loved her family
deeply, including her husband of 65 years, Arch. She was a
caring mother, grandmother, great-grandmother
and a loyal friend. Mom was an inspiration to us all and proudly served
as West Virginias first lady for 12 years.
We will miss her
dearly.
SERVICE ACADEMY DAYS
Please don't forget -- Sunday is
my Academy Day in South Charleston!
As a member of Congress,
I have the privilege of nominating a select group of individuals for
admission to the United States service academies: Army, Navy, Air
Force and Merchant Marine. Dozens of students I have nominated have been
accepted to these academies and have served us honorably in the armed
forces.
I encourage students interested in a career in the
military and their parents or guardians to attend one of my upcoming
Academy Days to learn more about the opportunities available at our
nation's service academies:

AUDIT THE
FED
On
Wednesday, I voted yes on a bill to require the Federal Reserve to be
fully audited within one year. The Government Accountability Office
would be required to conduct a full audit of the Federal Reserve System
and report the findings to Congress, giving Congress the information
and insight necessary to hold this important government agency fully
accountable.
The bill was passed 333-92 with
bipartisan support.
Will the Senate follow the Houses leadership and
hold the Fed accountable to American taxpayers?
SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESSES
Small businesses
are the backbone of West Virginias economy. I was honored this week
that the National Federation of Independent Businesses named me one of
Congress Guardians of Small Business.
Thank you for reading my

conversation on
