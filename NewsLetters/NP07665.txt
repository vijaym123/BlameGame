Deter and
Return
Last month, a Guatemalan mother learned her
11-year-old sons shirtless body was found near a Texas home.
He died
alone , with just his rosary and a belt with a Chicago phone
number written on it. Horror stories abound about children falling
under the wheels while hopping on El Tren de la Muerte, the Death Train
and young girls being sexually assaulted by the very coyotes their
families hired to smuggle them to America. Fueled by President Obamas
2008 executive order to defer deportation for certain children of
illegal immigrants, and lured by coyotes lies of permisos, parents in
poor Central American countries are paying thousands of dollars and
risking their childrens lives. President Obamas policies have helped
create this unprecedented humanitarian crisis.
So what is he doing
to stop it?
***
The answer: Nothing.
The solution is
to prevent the dangerous journey before it begins.
The president,
however, has stubbornly refused to use the Oval Office to send a
strong, public message that those who are seeking to enter the U.S.
illegally will be sent home. While applauded as a hero by those promoting
immigration reform at all costs, his tacit approval
only
encourages
more young children to make the dangerous trek across
Mexico. Even though nearly three of four asylum cases are likely
fraudulent, the White House refuses to crack down and has approved the claims
at a record pace. Instead of implementing tougher standards for
credible fear claims, they rubberstamped 92 percent of these cases last
year.
According to the House
Judiciary Committee, the President has
stretched the boundaries of
prosecutorial discretion beyond recognition
to shield entire
categories of deportable aliens from the law. Worse, the White House has
released into U.S. communities
over 36,000 criminal aliens
with murder, kidnapping, sexual assault and drug convictions who were
in the process of being deported. This sends the signal that not even
aliens with criminal convictions will be sent home. Now President
Obama has requested $3.7 billion from Congress for emergency funding to
continue these same
dangerous, costly policies .

The President is wrong.
Rather than manage
the crisis, its time to stop it and prevent it from occurring again.
The solution is to deter and return. Deter and Return starts with
strengthening our border , sending the National Guard to
our southern border to assist an overwhelmed border patrol and
granting them full access to pursue aliens into bordering environmental
areas. It includes pushing the key security point back away from Americas
southern border by funding the militarys U.S. Southern Command to
assist Guatemala in securing their border. It means changing the 2008
human trafficking law thats being manipulated to cause this crisis, and
accelerate the process for dealing with the 375,000 cases pending
today, using retired judges and special masters.
Rather than shipping children to expensive detention centers
around America and releasing them, any new funding should be used to
humanely detain them
requiring their cases to be filed within seven
days and directing judges to act within 72 hours. Parents in Guatemala
and Honduras recently told a special House working group who traveled
to Central America that
we want our children
back.
Their governments are eager and preparing for their return.
The humane solution is to quickly reunite their children with them.
The humane solution is to deter them from ever starting that dangerous
journey again.

My colleague, Judiciary Committee Chairman
and Virginia Congressman Bob Goodlatte, recently put out a
" Call to action" , reminding the President

immediately to stop
this crisis . You can read his common-sense solutions
