Dear Fellow Nevadan,
Happy Asian American
and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.
In 1978, Congress
designated the first days of May as Asian/Pacific American Heritage week.
This date was chosen in part to commemorate the contributions of
Chinese workers whose work enabled the completion of the transcontinental
railroad on May 10, 1869. The railroad linked the east and west coasts
for the first time and allowed unprecedented development and progress
across the country, including right here in Nevada. Since 1992, when
the observance was expanded to a month long celebration, we have paid
tribute every May to the hard work and sacrifice of the Chinese
workers who toiled in the Sierra Nevadas and to the countless other great
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) throughout our
history.
During my time serving the people of Nevada in the United
States Senate, I have had the pleasure of meeting and working with many
passionate and hardworking Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. This
month gives me the chance to reflect upon the life of one in particular
- my friend, the late Senator Daniel Inouye of
Hawaii.
Senator Inouye was the first Japanese American to serve in both the
United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate, but
his tradition of service began long before his more than 58 years in
Congress. He was a teenager when Japanese war planes attacked Pearl
Harbor. After the attack, Japanese Americans were deemed enemy aliens and
more than 110,000 people of Japanese ancestry were imprisoned in
American internment camps. Yet Dan Inouye and other Japanese Americans
volunteered to fight for this Nation's freedom overseas. For his bravery
and valor as part of the famous 442nd Regimental Combat Team in World
War II, Senator Inouye was awarded the Medal of Honor, the Congressional
Gold Medal, the Distinguished Service Cross, a Bronze Star for valor
and, of course, a Purple Heart. Asked by his son why, after being
classified as an enemy alien, he fought so heroically, Senator Inouye
simply said, "for the children.'' Senator Inouyes legacy as an American
hero, fierce advocate for Native Hawaiians and Asian Pacific Islanders
and one of our countrys greatest Senators lives on and it is stories
like his that we celebrate this month.
Today, the AAPI
community is strong and vibrant; with our country enriched by nearly 16
million people representing 45 different ethnic groups and 28 languages.
In Nevada, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are a vital part of
our states cultural and historic fiber. Our state is already home to
more than 200,000 AAPIs, and every year new Nevadans join us from
China, the Philippines, Japan, Vietnam, Korea, India, and many other Asian
and Pacific nations. Many of these Nevadans own thriving small
businesses that employ their neighbors and strengthen our economy. The
influence and contributions of our states AAPI population are increasing,
and they continue to make the Silver State stronger and more
prosperous.
This May, I rededicate my commitment to ensure Nevadas
AAPI community has every opportunity to achieve the American Dream.
Throughout my time in Congress, I have worked to enact legislation that
positively affects the AAPI community, and I will continue to champion
causes important to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders throughout
Nevada and our nation.
