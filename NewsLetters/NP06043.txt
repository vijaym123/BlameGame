BREAKING: Race for Congress TIED, 40%-40% Rasmussen Reports, 09-21-14
David -- We aren't used to good news, so we're not really sure how to handle this... A new poll released this week shows the race for Congress is tied, 4O%-4O%.
That means we still have a chance to send Boehner packing in November. But let&rsquo;s not fool ourselves -- those poll numbers won't hold.
Not if Boehner's biggest ad buy of the election --
which started this week - - goes unanswered.
The biggest fundraising deadline of the election is in just days. There&rsquo;s no way around it -- we have to hit 1O,OOO grassroots donations TONIGHT to keep our chances alive.
David Johnson Suggested Gift: $5.OO
David -- we need you on this. If we don&rsquo;t match Boehner blow-for-blow, brace yourself for a heart-wrenching defeat in November. Can you chip in $5 or whatever you can right now? ALL GIFTS TODAY MATCHED! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
