Dear Friends:
We had another great weekend traveling around the 12th District, and I hope your week is off to a great start.
On Saturday, I had the chance to visit with folks at the Pine Tree Festival in Swainsboro before heading over to meet with some of the young professionals of the 12th District at the New Leaders Council event in Augusta.
Last week in Washington, Congress began voting on legislation to fund different departments within the federal government.
The first two bills brought up funded the Department of Veterans Affairs and important military construction projects and the Legislative Branch of government.
I wanted to give you a brief update on what we passed out of the House of Representatives.
First, the 2015 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act funded different areas of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), including health care and other benefits our veterans have earned.
This bipartisan bill also includes a provision to improve oversight and investigations at the VA to ensure veterans are getting the care they need. In light of recent delays in care at the Charlie Norwood VAMC in Augusta, its important for the VA to have the resources they need to prevent these problems from happening in the future.
Also last week, the House passed the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, a bill to fund the operations of the House of Representatives and other government organizations.
I voted for this bill because it keeps in place spending cuts weve made in the past, and because it ensures that members of Congress do not receive an automatic pay increase.
Im fighting to make sure elected officials are held accountable, and an automatic pay increase would have been irresponsible.
In fact, Im working to make it easier for
members of Congress to reduce their pay , and to make sure that members of Congress don't get paid if Congress cant do its job.
Finally, last week, I spoke on the floor of the House of Representative about the need for the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline.
This important energy infrastructure project is critical to our energy security and independence future. You can watch my remarks by

Ill keep you updated on the work I'm doing for you in Washington, and I look forward to seeing you around the district.
If theres anything we can do to help out, please dont hesitate to call on me.
Sincerely,
John Barrow
Member of Congress
