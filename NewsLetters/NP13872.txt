Dear David,
While many of us will
spend this Thanksgiving with our family and friends, I would like to
take a moment to recognize our servicemen and women who are separated
from their loved ones in order to protect our nation.
Our
heroic members of the military, and their families, make enormous
sacrifices in order to keep us safe and give us the freedom to enjoy the
holidays.
As you and your family reflect on what you are
thankful for this year, please join me in honoring our men and women in
uniform, and their families, for all they do for
us.
Sincere regards,
Washington D.C. Office
