Dear David,
I wanted to take a moment to give you a brief update on what I've been
up to these past couple of weeks. But first, I want to wish all mothers-
particularly my own mom, Avis, and my sister, Sarah, who is a great mom
to my nephew JT-a very Happy Mother's Day!
Between newsletters, don't forget to follow me on Twitter
or like my Facebook

hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns, or simply
want to express your opinion. I'm always happy to hear from you.
Sincerely,

H.Res. 565 and H.Res. 574: Holding the IRS Accountable
This week the House passed H.Res 565, a resolution calling on Attorney
General Eric Holder to appoint a special counsel to investigate the
targeting of conservative non-profit groups by the IRS. We also passed
H.Res 574, a resolution that holds former IRS Director of Exempt
Organizations Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress for her refusal to
comply with subpoena's related to Congress' investigation of the IRS.

H.Res. 567:Providing for the Establishment of the Select Committee on
the Events Surrounding the 2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi
On September 11, 2012, four Americans-including our Ambassador- lost
their lives in a terrorist attack on the American consulate in
Benghazi, Libya. For almost two years the Obama Administration has
sought to obscure the truth of its failures before, during, and after
the attack. Establishing a select committee to investigate this matter
is an important step toward getting the American people the answers
they deserve. Watch my speech on the House Floor in support of this
resolution here

Engineers (ASPE)
Committee Spotlight
This week the Financial Services Committee
marked-up a number of bills
aimed
at eliminating excessive government regulation on small businesses,
which would help them to grow and create much needed jobs.
Additionally, the legislation would provide clarity to community banks
and credit unions who are struggling to serve customers as a result of
rules written by Washington bureaucrats. Following Financial Literacy
Month last month, the Financial Institutions Subcommittee held a
hearing to explore the potential for new technology such as smartphones
to
promote financial literacy. We also received testimony from Secretary
of the Treasury Jack Lew
on the
state of the international financial system. Many of my colleagues
questioned the Secretary on the regulatory excesses of the Obama
administration and how these regulations can harm even the smallest
community and hometown banks in Arkansas and across the country by
creating an uneven playing field.
We've had a busy few weeks in the Foreign Affairs Committee
. This week, the full committee held a hearing examining
the United States' response to Russia's recent actions in Ukraine
. The
committee heard from key State Department and Treasury Department
officials about Russia's actions and the Administration's strategy to
counter them. Similarly, the Terrorism, Non-proliferation, and Trade
Subcommittee held a hearing last week to examine how Russia's actions
in Ukraine will impact future attempts at nuclear arms treaties and
reductions. Earlier this week, the Middle East North Africa
Subcommittee also examined the recent peace negotiations between the
Palestinian Authority and Israel
which, yielded no positive results.
Regrettably, in the final days of negotiation, Palestinian Authority
signed a unity deal with Hamas, a widely recognized terrorist group
that is dedicated to the destruction of Israel. This development has
irretrievably undermined peace talks and made progress impossible.
Teacher Appreciation Week
This week, we marked National Teacher Appreciation Week. As you may
know, my mom, Avis, was a public school teacher and principal for 40
years. I saw firsthand the dedication and hard work she put into
teaching. For her, it was much more than just a job. I know most
teachers feel similarly. I am a proud product of Arkansas public
schools and was blessed to have many great teachers throughout my years
in the Dardanelle School District in Yell County. In particular, I
remember Mrs. Anna Collins, my high school history teacher. Mrs.
Collins was my teacher for 3 straight years and her passion for history
sparked an interest in the subject I still have today. She was always a
great teacher-even if I wasn't always the most well-behaved student in
the class! I want to extend my deepest thanks and appreciation to my
mom, Mrs. Collins, and all of the other teachers out there. Your
dedication to education is truly remarkable.

Spotlight: School Nutrition
Studies show that nutrition plays an important role in children's
development and child nutrition programs have played an important role
in achieving healthier options and outcomes for our children. I
recently met with several of Arkansas's school nutrition professionals
to discuss how federal regulation of school lunches is hurting Arkansas
school children. Their message was clear. These new regulations are
restricting child nutrition programs' ability to feed students. Since
implementation of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act began, 1.2 million
fewer kids per day are participating in the National School Lunch
Program
This is unacceptable. We must prioritize simplify the nutrition
standards and provide flexibility to local school districts. Recently,
I joined several of my colleagues in writing to Department of
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack expressing our concern over this
matter and asking the USDA to provide schools with increased
flexibility in implementing child nutrition program regulations. The
full letter can be found here. Rest assured I will continue to work to
ensure child nutrition programs remain accessible for all those in
Arkansas and across the country.
Fighting Back Against Obamacare: Healthcare Spending Grows
When Obamacare was passed into law 3 years ago, President Obama
promised, among many other things, that this law would "bend the cost
curve down", leading to lower healthcare spending in the years ahead.
Unfortunately, it seems we have another thing to add to the list of
broken Obamacare promises. A recent report by the Bureau of Economic
Analysis indicated that healthcare spending grew by 9.9 percent in the
first quarter of 2014 alone. That's the fastest increase in nearly 35
years and by all accounts it will continue to rise as Obamacare further
distorts the health care market. Take a look at the chart below, which
illustrates the quarterly changes in healthcare spending since 2009.
Obamacare hasn't and won't fix our debt crisis. In fact, as the chart
indicates, it will only make things worse. Increases in healthcare
spending puts additional pressure on family budgets and the taxpayer
subsidies paid by the federal government ultimately crowd out other
priorities like our national defense and social security. Rest assured,
I remain committed to repealing this unworkable law and protecting
Arkansans from its worst effects.
Around Arkansas
Last week, much of central Arkansas was devastated by severe storms. 16
people tragically lost their lives and many more saw their homes and
neighborhoods destroyed. The communities of Mayflower and Vilonia were
particularly hard hit. Last Tuesday, I spoke on the House Floor
asking
for prayers for those impacted by these terrible storms and was proud
to join my colleagues from Arkansas, Mississippi, and Kansas on the
House floor as fellow Arkansas Congressman Rick Crawford (AR-01) led
the House of Representatives in moment of silence
. The Arkansas Congressional delegation
also sent letters to Obama and FEMA Administrator Fugate supporting
Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe's request for a major disaster declaration
for Faulkner
,Pulaski, Randolph, and White
Counties
. Arkansans are strong, tough
people and I know together we will come out stronger. Please join me in
continuing to pray for Arkansas.
Don't Forget!
My staff will be holding several Veterans Assistance Sessions
throughout May and June. Additional details can be found by visiting my

We
also
received
testimony
from

on
the
state
of
the

how
these

can
harm
even
the

country
by
creating
an

We&#8217;ve
had
a
busy
few
weeks
in
the
Foreign
Affairs
Committee .
This
week,
the
full
committee
held
a
hearing
examining
the
United
States&#8217;
response
to
Russia&#8217;s

Department

actions
and
the
Administration&#8217;s

Similarly,
the
Terrorism,

and
Trade

held
a
hearing
last
week
to
examine
how
Russia&#8217;s
actions
in
Ukraine
will
impact
future
attempts
at
nuclear
arms
treaties
and
reductions.
Earlier
this
week,
the
Middle
East
North
Africa
Subcommittee
also
examined
the
recent
peace
negotiations
between
the
Palestinian
Authority
and
Israel
which,
yielded
no
positive
results.
Regrettably,
in
the
final
days
of
negotiation,
Palestinian
Authority
signed
a
unity
deal
with
Hamas,
a
widely
recognized
terrorist
group
that
is
dedicated
to
the
destruction
of
Israel.
This
development
has
irretrievably
undermined
peace
talks
and
made
progress
impossible.
Teacher

This

we
marked

In
particular,
I
remember

teacher.
Mrs.
Collins
was
my

for
3
straight

her

I

She
was

a

if
I
wasn&#8217;t
always
the
most

student
in

I
want
to
extend
my
deepest

out

Fighting
Back
Against
Obamacare:
Healthcare
Spending
Grows
When
Obamacare
was
passed
into
law
3
years
ago,
President
Obama
promised,
among
many
other
things,
that
this
law
would
"bend
the
cost
curve
down",
leading
to
lower
healthcare
spending
in
the
years
ahead.
Unfortunately,
it
seems
we
have
another
thing
to
add
to
the
list
of
broken
Obamacare
promises.
A
recent
report
by
the
Bureau
of
Economic
Analysis
indicated
that
healthcare
spending
grew
by
9.9
percent
in
the
first
quarter
of
2014
alone.
That&#8217;s
the
fastest
increase
in
nearly
35
years
and
by
all
accounts
it
will
continue
to
rise
as
Obamacare
further
distorts
the
health
care
market. Take
a
look
at
the
chart
below,
which
illustrates
the
quarterly
changes
in
healthcare
spending
since
2009.
Obamacare
hasn&#8217;t
and
won&#8217;t
fix
our
debt
crisis.
In
fact,
as
the
chart
indicates,
it
will
only
make
things
worse.
Increases
in
healthcare
spending
puts
additional
pressure
on
family
budgets
and
the
taxpayer
subsidies
paid
by
the
federal
government
ultimately
crowd
out
other
priorities
like
our
national
defense
and
social
security.
Rest
assured,
I
remain
committed
to
repealing
this
unworkable
law
and
protecting
Arkansans
from
its
worst
effects.
