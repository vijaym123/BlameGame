Dear Friend,
In case you missed a lot of the buzz
on
my
Rangel Resolution ,
I'm having fun promoting easy &amp; sustainable healthy habits: 1.
Replace all sugary beverages with water; 2. Eat breakfast every day; and
3. Eat at least one serving of fruits and
vegetables.
Last week, I kicked off my
health initiaive
at the
West Harlem Community Healthy Food Hub ,
and th is week, I visited a
spin
class
taught by Principal Jean McTavish of Edward A. Reynolds West
Side High School.
It was a lot of fun, but I definitely felt the
burn!
Here's me in
action:
Rangel Spins, Talks Food &amp; Life
Here's a video
of Congressman Charlie Rangel on an exercise
bike

for
I also hosted
a
#FoodFri Twitter Town Hall
with @MomsRising to discuss how
parents can encourage and teach their children to eat healthy.
We had a great turnout and many people sharing their favorite healthy
recipes with me.
You can do the same
here .
Sincerely Yours,
Congressman Charles B.
Rangel
