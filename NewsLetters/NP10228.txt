Dear Friend,

I'm doing in Washington and the 15th District. For more ways to stay in

Subcommittee To Continue Review Of Chemicals In Commerce Act
On Tuesday, the Subcommittee on Environment and the Economy, which I
chair, will continue its review of draft legislation, the Chemicals in
Commerce Act (CICA). We are continuing our work to reform and improve
the decades-old Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).
The subcommittee reviewed an initial draft of the legislation in March,
and members have since continued to work together on a bipartisan basis
to find common ground. This coming week, we will review a revised draft
of the legislation.
I've said from the beginning of the process that I've wanted to work in
a collaborative, bipartisan way to reform TSCA. This new draft reflects
suggestions from members on both sides of the aisle, as well as
stakeholders and the administration. We should be proud of what we have
accomplished so far, and I am hopeful members can continue to work
together as we move forward. Reforming TSCA is not only good for jobs
and the economy, but it is also needed to improve protections for
consumers and the environment.
District Discussions
My travels in the district this past week took me to Mahomet-Seymour
High School, where I spoke to honors students (above) and to Effingham,
where I took part in a discussion forum at a gathering of the Illinois
Realtors Association (with Collinsville realtor Doug Hartmann, Sr.,
right).
Announcements
