House Unanimously Approves Babin Amendments
Stopping Wasteful VA Program
I'm proud to report that the House unanimously approved my amendment on Wednesday to end the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)s abused Appraised Value Offer program. Under this program, the VA spent nearly $300,000 in taxpayer money to move a VA employee 140 miles
from Washington DC to Philadelphia. Thats $300,000 that could have been used to care for numerous deserving veterans who have served this nation in uniform, but instead was wasted on relocating a single VA government bureaucrat. To watch video of my floor speech, please

Putting the Brakes on Ill-Advised Iran Nuclear Deal
On Thursday, I offered an amendment to restrict federal funds from being used to enforce any Iran deal that falls short of terminating Irans nuclear program.
Our Amendment to require Irans total disarmament of its nuclear weapons was passed unanimously.
I am encouraged by the support we've received on this important topic. The Congress must use the power of the purse to stop a bad deal and my amendment is a part of this effort. Thats what I am fighting for! To watch video of the debate on these my amendment, please

House Passes VA Funding Bill
I supported this week House-passage of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act (H.R. 2029), which provides critical funding for our nations veterans, as well as military construction projects for our troops, their families, and our military bases. Our bill continues to hold the Administration accountable for its failures to care for our nations veterans.
Specifically the bill provides:
$68.7 billion for Veterans programs
$7.7 billion for military construction
$48.6 billion for VA medical services
$71 million for Arlington National Cemetery.
Babin Votes to Approve
Funding for Port of Houston
On Friday, the House passed an Energy and Water Appropriations Bill (H.R. 2028), which included an amendment I voted for to provide the Army Corps of Engineers with additional resources to fund harbor maintenance projects, including those at the Port of Houston. This legislation represents an important victory for the Port and our local economy. It provides our area with much needed resources to immediately be used for dredging and widening of the Houston Ship Channel. These funds will help strengthen the Port of Houstons competiveness and ensure our area remains a leader in the maritime industry.
House Science Committee
Approves NASA Authorization Bill
I was pleased to join my colleagues on Thursday in the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology in passing a responsible two-year NASA authorization bill that reprioritizes NASAs budget to ensure human spaceflight remains the agencys top priority. Learn more here: http://1.usa.gov/1c333SG
