Capitol Update
Congressman Cook on Iranian Sanctions
Congressman Cook participated in a House Foreign Affairs Committee
hearing on November 13 which examined the status of nuclear
negotiations with Iran. A bipartisan group of members raised serious
objections and concerns to any proposal to lift the sanctions imposed
on Iran and instead called for the Senate to join the House of
Representatives in tightening sanctions by passing H.R. 850, the
Nuclear Iran Prevention Act. This bill passed out of the House earlier
this year on an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 400-20.
Said Cook, "I'm gravely concerned about the administration's proposal
to lift sanctions without receiving any significant concessions from
the Iranian regime. Weakening sanctions on Iran while it continues to
pursue nuclear weapons is exactly the wrong approach to take. Existing
sanctions are the only reason that Iran has even come to the table to
negotiate, and loosening them just as they are beginning to work would
only encourage Iran to continue its pursuit of nuclear weapons. History
has shown that appeasing aggressors and trading concrete concessions
for a dictator's promise is dangerous. As we've seen with North Korea,
lifting sanctions without verifiable and irreversible nuclear
disarmament will do nothing to prevent the world's leading state
sponsor of terrorism from pursuing the world's most dangerous weapons.
"Less than a month ago, we remembered the 241 American servicemen
killed in a terrorist attack by Hezbollah, the Iranian Revolutionary
Guard's most dangerous terrorist proxy. President Rouhani was a senior
Iranian Defense official at the time of the bombing and since then has
helped lead some of the regime's most brutal crackdowns on student
activists. Rather than relaxing sanctions on this dangerous man and the
terrorist regime he represents, it's time for the Senate to join the
House in tightening sanctions by passing H.R. 850, the Nuclear Iran
Prevention Act of 2013. Senate passage of this bill, which had
overwhelming bipartisan support in the House, would tighten existing
sanctions and send a strong message that the United States will never
accept a nuclear Iran. If the administration insists on lifting
sanctions for reversible and largely cosmetic Iranian concessions, the
United States will be left with only two options: accept a
nuclear-armed Iran or take the United States into another war in the
Middle East."
Congressman Cook Votes to Keep Your Health Care Act
Last week, Congressman Cook voted for H.R. 3550, the Keep Your Health
Care Act of 2013. The bill, which passed by a vote of 261-157, allows
providers to continue to offer health insurance plans next year that
were in effect in the individual market as of January 1, 2013.
Across the nation, millions of Americans have been receiving notices of
cancelled health care plans. As recently as September 26, President
Obama claimed that Americans could keep their current health care plans
if they were happy with them. However, California Insurance
Commissioner Dave Jones has stated that approximately one million
Californians are set to lose their existing health care plans.
This plan will allow existing policies to qualify as "minimum essential
coverage" for purposes of meeting the individual mandate requirement.
Said Cook, "Too many people are being forced off their healthcare plans
and are facing premiums they simply can't afford. This bill makes good
on the President's broken promise and allows those receiving
cancellation notices to continue to be covered on the plans they like."
DATA Act
Yesterday, November 18, Congressman Cook voted to increase transparency
on the way tax dollars are spent. The DATA Act, H.R. 2061, passed with
overwhelming bipartisan support. H.R. 2061 creates common standards for
financial data provided by government agencies, and expands the amount
of data that agencies are required to make public on USASpending.gov.
It will make federal spending data more easily accessible.
Service Academy Nominations
The deadline for high school seniors who are interested in attending
one of the service academies is rapidly approaching. Students must

Force Academy, U.S. Military Academy, or U.S. Merchant Marine Academy

Capitol
Update
Congressman
Cook
on
Iranian
Sanctions Congressman
Cook
participated
in
a
House
Foreign
Affairs
Committee
hearing
on
November

which
examined
the

of
nuclear

with
Iran. A

to

in

by

the

Prevention
Act.
This
bill
passed
out
of
the
House
earlier
this
year
on
an
overwhelming
bipartisan
vote
of
400-20.
Said
Cook,
&#8220;I&#8217;m
gravely
concerned
about
the
administration&#8217;s
proposal
to
lift
sanctions
without
receiving
any
significant
concessions
from
the
Iranian
regime.
Weakening
sanctions
on
Iran
while
it
continues
to
pursue
nuclear
weapons
is
exactly
the
wrong
approach
to
take.
Existing
sanctions
are
the
only
reason
that
Iran
has
even
come
to
the
table
to
negotiate,
and
loosening
them
just
as
they
are
beginning
to
work
would
only
encourage
Iran
to
continue
its
pursuit
of
nuclear
weapons.
History
has
shown
that
appeasing
aggressors
and
trading
concrete
concessions
for
a
dictator&#8217;s
promise
is
dangerous.
As
we&#8217;ve
seen
with
North
Korea,
lifting
sanctions
without
verifiable
and
irreversible
nuclear
disarmament
will
do
nothing
to
prevent
the
world&#8217;s
leading
state
sponsor
of
terrorism
from
pursuing
the
world&#8217;s
most
dangerous
weapons.
&#8220;Less
than
a
month
ago,
we
remembered
the
241
American
servicemen
killed
in
a
terrorist
attack
by
Hezbollah,
the
Iranian
Revolutionary
Guard&#8217;s
most
dangerous
terrorist
proxy.
President
Rouhani
was
a
senior
Iranian
Defense
official
at
the
time
of
the
bombing
and
since
then
has
helped
lead
some
of
the
regime&#8217;s
most
brutal
crackdowns
on
student
activists.
Rather
than
relaxing
sanctions
on
this
dangerous
man
and
the
terrorist
regime
he
represents,
it&#8217;s
time
for
the
Senate
to
join
the
House
in
tightening
sanctions
by
passing
H.R.
850,
the
Nuclear
Iran
Prevention
Act
of
2013.
Senate
passage
of
this
bill,
which
had
overwhelming
bipartisan
support
in
the
House,
would
tighten
existing
sanctions
and
send
a
strong
message
that
the
United
States
will
never
accept
a
nuclear
Iran.
If
the
administration
insists
on
lifting
sanctions
for
reversible
and
largely
cosmetic
Iranian
concessions,
the
United
States
will
be
left
with
only
two
options:
accept
a
nuclear-armed

or
take
the
United
States
into
another
war
in
the
Middle
East.&#8221;
Congressman
Cook
Votes
to
Keep
Your
Health
Care
Act Last
week,
Congressman
Cook
voted
for
H.R.
3550,
the
Keep
Your
Health
Care
Act
of
2013.
The
bill,
which
passed
by
a
vote
of
261-157,
allows
providers
to
continue
to
offer
health
insurance
plans
next
year
that
were
in
effect
in
the
individual
market
as
of
January
1,
2013.
Across
the
nation,
millions
of
Americans
have
been
receiving
notices
of
cancelled
health
care
plans.
As
recently
as
September
26,
President
Obama
claimed
that
Americans
could
keep
their
current
health
care
plans
if
they
were
happy
with
them.
However,
California
Insurance
Commissioner
Dave
Jones
has
stated
that
approximately
one
million
Californians
are
set
to
lose
their
existing
health
care
plans.
This
plan
will
allow
existing
policies
to
qualify
as
&#8220;minimum
essential
coverage&#8221;
for
purposes
of
meeting
the
individual
mandate
requirement.
Said
Cook,
&#8220;Too
many
people
are
being
forced
off
their
healthcare
plans
and
are
facing
premiums
they
simply
can't
afford.
This
bill
makes
good
on
the
President&#8217;s
broken
promise
and
allows
those
receiving
cancellation
notices
to
continue
to
be
covered
on
the
plans
they
like.&#8221;
DATA

November
18,
Congressman
Cook
voted

on
the

dollars

The

H.R.

creates
