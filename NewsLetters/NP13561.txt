Dear David,
The House has just wrapped up its last legislative week before the
holidays, but we are hard at work in my Washington and district
offices.
On Wednesday, I participated in a live "teletownhall meeting" with my
constituents on the lower Eastern Shore. This event allowed me to speak
directly to constituents, addressing their questions and concerns on a
telephone call. We discussed a variety of topics, including Obamacare,
veterans' benefits, the federal budget, and agricultural issues.
It's no surprise that Obamacare was on the minds of many callers, as
its rollout in Maryland has been-to use Governor O'Malley's description
-"rocky." I think "disastrous" is the better word. Maryland residents
are struggling to sign up for health care on a malfunctioning website.
And now, with the Dec. 23 sign-up deadline looming, community groups
who had relied on paper applications because of problems with the
website are especially worried about people with critical medical
issues getting the coverage they need starting Jan. 1.
Obama's promise that "if you like your health care plan, you can keep
it"-recently dubbed "the lie of the year 2013" by the news website
PolitiFact.com-continues to harm Americans. In the year ahead, I will
continue to publicize problems with the health care law and its
implementation, and fight for my constituents.
For example, this week, I co-sponsored a bill that would exempt
volunteer fire companies from the President's health reform law. The
IRS has interpreted the President's law in a way that would make
volunteer firehouses provide ACA-compliant health insurance for all
volunteer firefighters or pay a fine. Our volunteers are just that:
volunteers, and not employees. The ACA mandate could force firehouses
to close because they won't be able to afford the penalty or provide
the insurance. In Maryland, almost 89 percent of firehouses rely
exclusively or almost exclusively on volunteers. We cannot allow
Obamacare to interfere with the work of our dedicated firefighters or
the safety of our citizens.
Thank you for your continued energy and enthusiasm, as reflected in
your letters and Facebook posts. If you haven't already, LIKE

Finally, I wish you and your families a very happy holiday season.
Here's to a healthy and productive 2014!
Sincerely,
Andy Harris, M.D.

Dear
David,
The
House
has
just
wrapped
up
its
last
legislative
week
before
the
holidays,
but
we
are
hard
at
work
in
my
Washington
and
district
offices.
On
Wednesday,
I
participated
in
a
live
&#8220;teletownhall
meeting&#8221;
with
my
constituents
on
the
lower
Eastern
Shore.
This
event
allowed
me
to
speak
directly
to
constituents,
addressing
their
questions
and
concerns
on
a
telephone
call.
We
discussed
a
variety
of
topics,
including
Obamacare,
veterans&#8217;
benefits,
the
federal
budget,
and
agricultural
issues.
It&#8217;s
no
surprise
that
Obamacare
was
on
the
minds
of
many
callers,
as
its
rollout
in
Maryland
has
been&#8212;to
use
Governor
O&#8217;Malley&#8217;s
description&#8212;&#8220;rocky.&#8221;
I
think
&#8220;disastrous&#8221;
is
the
better
word.
Maryland
residents
are
struggling
to
sign
up
for
health
care
on
a
malfunctioning
website.
And
now,
with
the
Dec.
23
sign-up
deadline
looming,
community
groups
who
had
relied

because
of
problems
with

people
with

Obama&#8217;s

&#8220;if

your
health

plan,
you
can
keep
it&#8221;&#8212;recently

the
news

to
harm
Americans.
In
the
year
ahead,
I
will
continue
to
publicize
problems
with
the
health
care
law
and
its
implementation,
and
fight
for
my
constituents.
For
example,
this
week,
I
co-sponsored
a
bill
that
would
exempt
volunteer
fire
companies
from
the
President's
health
reform
law.
The
IRS
has
interpreted
the
President&#8217;s
law
in
a
way
that
would
make
volunteer
firehouses
provide
ACA-compliant
health
insurance
for
all
volunteer
firefighters
or
pay
a
fine.
Our
volunteers
are
just
that:
volunteers,
and
not
employees.
The
ACA
mandate
could
force
firehouses
to
close
because
they
won't
be
able
to
afford
the
penalty
or
provide
the
insurance.
In
Maryland,
almost
89

of
firehouses
rely
exclusively
or
almost

on
volunteers.
We
cannot
allow
Obamacare
to
interfere
with
the
work
of
our
dedicated
firefighters
or
the
safety
of
our
citizens.
Thank
