News from Representative John Delaney
December 4, 2013
Dear Friend,
I hope that you had a wonderful Thanksgiving. I write to you today to
update you on the bicameral Budget Conference Committee and share my
views on how the committee should proceed. This week, CNN reported that
the talks are at a "critical point."
As you may know, as part of the deal to end the government shutdown in
October, leaders in the House and Senate agreed to appoint a conference
committee on next year's budget. Under October's agreement, the
government is funded through January 15, 2014, and the debt ceiling has
been raised through February 7. Both the House and Senate have passed
budgets for next year and the conference is designed to find a
compromise that both chambers can support.
I strongly believe that it is in the best interest of the country that
we reach a compromise before the deadline of December 13, 2013. First
and foremost, another government shutdown or default crisis would be
damaging to our economy, especially here in Maryland. Secondly, I
believe that good economic policy comes at the intersection of
principle and compromise. The budget conference is an opportunity for
Washington to work.
Recently, I outlined the details of my proposal in the Washington Post
. First, working in a bipartisan fashion, we should
invest in America's infrastructure. This will create jobs in the short
term and spur economic growth in the long term. Both help reduce the
deficit. My infrastructure bill, which currently has 25 Republican and
25 Democratic cosponsors, is a possible path forward.
Second, partially replacing the sequester and allowing agencies more
flexibility will also help, especially in key areas that impact our
global competitiveness, such as education, science, and research.
Finally, a budget deal should include a balanced approach to deficit
reduction, which includes additional revenues and appropriate reforms
to existing programs.
The truth is that both sides have good ideas and laudable goals. If we
make the right choices we can reduce the deficit, protect the least
fortunate, and continue to invest in our future.
Included in today's newsletter is a poll asking you what your budget
priorities are, please answer the poll
and send me your
feedback.
John

Representative
John
Delaney
December

Dear
Friend,
I
hope
that
you
had
a
wonderful
Thanksgiving.
I
write
to
you
today
to
update
you
on
the
bicameral
Budget
Conference
Committee
and
share
my
views
on
how
the
committee
should
proceed.
This
week,
CNN
reported
that
the
talks
are
at
a
&#8220;critical
point.&#8221;
As
you
may
know,
as
part
of
the
deal
to
end
the
government
shutdown
in
October,
leaders
in
the
House
and
Senate
agreed
to
appoint
a
conference
committee
on
next
year&#8217;s
budget.
Under
October&#8217;s
agreement,
the
government
is
funded
through
January
15,
2014,
and
the
debt
ceiling
has
been
raised
through
February
7.
Both
the
House
and
Senate
have
passed
budgets
for
next
year
and
the
conference
is
designed
to
find
a
compromise
that
both
chambers
can
support.
I
strongly
believe
that
it
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
country
that
we
reach
a
compromise
before
the
deadline
of
December
13,
2013.
First
and
foremost,
another
government
shutdown
or
default
crisis
would
be
damaging
to
our
economy,
especially
here
in
Maryland.
Secondly,
I
believe
that
good
economic
policy
comes
at
the
intersection
of
principle
and
compromise.
The
