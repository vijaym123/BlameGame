News from Representative Richard Nugent
Dear Friends,
Quick follow up from last week.
As most of you probably know, Congress
overwhelmingly passed the Ryan-Murray budget agreement before we broke
for the holidays.
I voted "no" on the budget and I laid out my reasons
for doing so in that week's SITREP. For those of you who missed that
installment of the SITREP, I voted against the budget deal because it
dramatically cut the pensions of all retired military men and women
under the age of 62.
To make matters worse, in my opinion, the same
people who negotiated that budget deal spent the days following its
passage shedding crocodile tears and vowing to "fix" their mistake.
Fast-forward to this past week when Congress took up the accompanying
appropriations bill, which funds the actual line item categories that
were laid out in that budget agreement. The appropriations bill that
passed this week did a number of positive things. But, frankly, in a
1,200+ page bill that's worth over $1.1 trillion, there better be some
positive things to point to (and I'll touch on a few of those in a
moment).
But first and foremost, one of the provisions that was the most
important to me was the temporary restoration of some of the pension
cuts for retired military - specifically the cuts to survivor benefits
and those who were injured during service and forced to retire because
of a medical issue.
That, as you may recall, was the breaking point
for me on the budget vote. However, most of the military pension cuts
were left intact and I was still faced with the basic question of
whether I could continue to look our service members in the eye and
tell them that I'd done all I could to advocate for them.
At the end
of the day, when the Pentagon itself is out there pushing for pay cuts
for active duty military, healthcare premium and fee increases for
their families, and pension cuts for those who have devoted their
careers to defending this nation, who exactly is there defending these
individuals?
In the end, I voted against the appropriations bill for the same reason
I voted against the budget deal.
In my opinion, I don't think having a
bunch of us politicians stand up and tell the troops, "We owe you a
debt that can never be repaid", and then turn around and take away the
pension offer we promised them is sending the right message.
Our
military is an all-volunteer force.
Nobody made them go out there and
risk life and limb for us.
They did that on their own.
Our end of the
bargain as a nation - at a minimum - is to follow through on the
promises we made.
If pension formulas need to be adjusted for new
folks coming in, then that's an honest conversation you can have with
those recruits.
They are grown men and women who can make their own
decisions and can do so with their eyes open.
But as a nation, we don't
break promises that have already been made to our troops.
It's not
just about the dollars, it's about the principle.
Now, I said at the outset that there were some positive provisions in
the appropriations bill and I want to make sure you know about some of
them.
Our discretionary spending levels are now back to where they
were when President Bush left office.
That's no small feat considering
the massive increases that started immediately after President Obama
came in.
In this bill, foreign aid has been cut - not as much as I'd like, but
cut nonetheless.
The IRS has been cut and slush funds cut off.
Agencies across the federal government are having to make tough choices
and find efficiencies that they haven't been forced to find in decades.
In the end, on this one, it was a matter of principle.
I couldn't
honestly cast a vote that said, "this is the best we can do here".
Restoring some of the cuts to our military retirees was an important
step and I'm grateful that they did that.
And I remain hopeful that
the Armed Services and Budget Committees can find the resources
necessary to pay for reversing the rest of the cuts.
But on this bill,
I think we could have done better and we didn't live up to that
responsibility.
That's just where I stand.
But as always, it's helpful for me to hear where you all stand - agree
or disagree.
I can't do this job in a vacuum.
I'm here to represent
each and every one of you and each and every one of you has a right to
weigh in.
So if you have some time, please drop me a line and let me
know your feelings - on this or any other issues we're facing.
Thanks again have a safe and restful weekend.
Sincerely,
Rich Nugent
Member of Congress

from
Representative
Richard
Nugent
Dear
Friends,
[if gte mso 10]>
<![endif]
Quick
follow
up
from
last
week&#8230;
As
most
of
you
probably
know,
Congress
overwhelmingly
passed
the
Ryan-Murray
budget
agreement
before
we
broke
for
the
holidays.
I
voted
&#8220;no&#8221;
on
the
budget
and
I
laid
out
my
reasons
for
doing
so
in
that
week&#8217;s
SITREP.
For
those
of
you
who
missed
that
installment
of
the
SITREP,
I
voted
against
the
budget
deal
because
it
dramatically
cut
the
pensions
of
all
retired
military
men
and
women
under
the
age
of
62.
To
make
matters
worse,
in
my
opinion,
the
same
people
who
negotiated
that
budget
deal
spent
the
days
following
its
passage
shedding
crocodile
tears
and
vowing
to
&#8220;fix&#8221;
their
mistake.
Fast-forward
to
this
past
week
when
Congress
took
up
the
accompanying
appropriations
bill,
which
funds
the
actual
line
item
categories
that
were
laid
out
in
that
budget
agreement.
The
appropriations
bill
that
passed
this
week
did
a
number
of
positive
things.
But,
frankly,
in
a
1,200+
page
bill
that&#8217;s
worth
over
$1.1
trillion,
there
better
be
some
positive
things
to
point
to
(and
I&#8217;ll
touch
on
a
few
of
those
in
a
moment).
But
first
and
foremost,
one
of
the
provisions
that
was
the
most
important
to
me
was
the
temporary
restoration
of
some
of
the
pension
cuts
for
retired
military
&#8211;
specifically
the
cuts
to
survivor
benefits
and
those
who
were
injured
during
service
and
forced
to
retire
because
of
a
medical
issue.
That,
as
you
may
recall,
was
the
breaking
point
for
me
on
the
budget
vote.
However,
most
of
the
military
pension
cuts
were
left
intact
and
I
was
still
faced
with
the
basic
question
of
whether
I
could
continue
to
look
our
service
members
in
the
eye
and
tell
them
that
I&#8217;d
done
all
I
could
to
advocate
for
them.
At
the
end
of
the
day,
when
the
Pentagon
itself
is
out
there
pushing
for
pay
cuts
for
active
duty
military,
healthcare
premium
and
fee
increases
for
their
families,
and
pension
cuts
for
those
who
have
devoted
their
careers
to
defending
this
nation,
who
exactly
is
there
defending
these
individuals?
In
the
end,
I
voted
against
the
appropriations
bill
for
the
same
reason
I
voted
against
the
budget
deal.
In
my
opinion,
I
don&#8217;t
think
having
a
bunch
of
us
politicians
stand
up
and
tell
the
troops,
&#8220;We
owe
you
a
debt
that
can
never
be
repaid&#8221;,
and
then
turn
around
and
take
away
the
pension
offer
we
promised
them
is
sending
the
right
message.
Our
military
is
an
all-volunteer
force.
Nobody
made
them
go
out
there
and
risk
life
and
limb
for
us.
They
did
that
on
their
own.
Our
end
of
the
bargain
as
a
nation
&#8211;
at
a
minimum
&#8211;
is
to
follow
through
on
the
promises
we
made.
If
pension
formulas
need
to
be
adjusted
for
new
folks
coming
in,
then
that&#8217;s
an
honest
conversation
you
can
have
with
those
recruits.
They
are
grown
men
and
women
who
can
make
their
own
decisions
and
can
do
so
with
their
eyes
open.
But
as
a
nation,
we
don&#8217;t
break
promises
that
have
already
been
made
to
our
troops.
It&#8217;s
not
just
about
the
dollars,
it&#8217;s
about
the
principle.
Now,
I
said
at
the
outset
that
there
were
some
positive
provisions
in
the
appropriations
bill
and
I
want
to
make
sure
you
know
about
some
of
them.
Our
discretionary
spending
levels
are
now
back
to
where
they
were
when
President
Bush
left
office.
That&#8217;s
no
small
feat
considering
the
massive
increases
that
started
immediately
after
President
Obama
came
in.
In
this
bill,
foreign
aid
has
been
cut
&#8211;
not
as
much
as
I&#8217;d
like,
but
cut
nonetheless.
The
IRS
has
been
cut
and
slush
funds
cut
off.
Agencies
across
the
federal
government
are
having
to
make
tough
choices
and
find
efficiencies
that
they
haven&#8217;t
been
forced
to
find
in
decades.
In
the
end,
on
this
one,
it
was
a
matter
of
principle.
I
couldn&#8217;t
honestly
cast
a
vote
that
said,
&#8220;this
is
the
best
we
can
do
here&#8221;.
Restoring
some
of
the
cuts
to
our
military
retirees
was
an
important
step
and
I&#8217;m
grateful
that
they
did
that.
And
I
remain
hopeful
that
the
Armed
Services
and
Budget
Committees
can
find
the
resources
necessary
to
pay
for
reversing
the
rest
of
the
cuts.
But
on
this
bill,
I
think
we
could
have
done
better
and
we
didn&#8217;t
live
up
to
that
responsibility.
That&#8217;s
just
where
I
stand.
But
as
always,
it&#8217;s
helpful
for
me
to
hear
where
you
all
stand
&#8211;
agree
or
disagree.
I
can&#8217;t
do
this
job
in
a
vacuum.
I&#8217;m
here
to
represent
each
and
every
one
of
you
and
each
and
every
one
of
you
has
a
right
to
weigh
in.
So
if
you
have
some
time,
please
drop
me
a
line
and
let
me
know
your
feelings
&#8211;
on
this
or
any
other
issues
we&#8217;re
facing.
Thanks
again
have
a
safe
and
restful
weekend.
