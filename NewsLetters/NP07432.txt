We Must
Continue Our Efforts to Restore a Culture
of Service at the VA
Dear
Friend,
Last month, an audit of Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) health facilities
found that more than 57,000 veterans are
still waiting for their first appointment.
The House of Representatives has taken
swift action to address the root of the
ongoing problems within the VA system of
care by initiating congressional oversight
hearings to delve into the issues and move
legislative solutions forward.
To address these glaring problems, the
House passed H.R. 4810,
the
Veteran Access to Care Act , with a
unanimous, bipartisan 426-0 vote. This bill
directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs
to contract with private health care
providers to allow veterans who have
experienced excessively long wait times or
live over 40 miles from a VA medical
facility to see physicians outside the VA
system. The Senate followed our lead and
passed a similar bill. House and Senate
leaders have been negotiating to reconcile
the differences between the two bills
andannounced completion this week of
a finalversion for House and Senate
consideration. I look forward to reviewing
the final package and hope that we can work
in a bipartisan, bicameral way to advance
the vital reforms our veterans need and
deserve.
The House adopted another important
measure, H.R. 4031,
the
Department of Veterans Affairs Management
Accountability Act , with a bipartisan
vote of 390-33. At present, removal of a
senior executive based upon poor
performance is a lengthy and cumbersome
process that frustrates efforts to hold
underperforming leaders accountable for
their failings. This measure would address
the severe mismanagement at the VA by
allowing for easier removal of ineffective
senior level officials at the agency.
Finally, the House has passed the
Demanding Accountability for Veterans Act
(H.R. 2072) to make several reforms to
ensure the VA is more accountable to the
Office of the Inspector General (IG), which
has made over 1,000 recommendations to the
agency that have been ignored. For example,
if the VA has not appropriately responded
to a report issued by the IG, Congress
would be notified and, within the next 15
days, the VA Secretary would be required to
provide a list of those responsible for the
issues cited in the report.
The problems within the VA are the
result of a broken system, and these
proposals are an important part of the
effort to meaningfully and structurally
reform the delivery of care to our
veterans. But we will not be successful in
this mission unless we also continue to
demand accountability and change from the
VA so it returns to a culture of duty and
service rather than one of bureaucracy and
paper-pushing. If we remain dedicated to
the solemn obligations we owe to the men
and women that have given life and limb for
our nation, we can provide a level of care
and service worthy of the tremendous
sacrifice our veterans made for the cause
of freedom.
