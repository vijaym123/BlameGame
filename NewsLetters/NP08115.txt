Friend,
I can&#39;t thank you enough.
Your response yesterday was legendary. We surpassed our fundraising goal and enjoyed our biggest end of quarter showing so far.
This means a few things - first, that we&#39;ll be able to combat the falsehoods that will soon be coming our way. Second, that we&#39;ll be able to fund a robust field program as Election Day draws closer. And third - and most importantly - that our grassroots team is strong and committed to success.
Thank you. Without you, we would be nowhere. But because of you, we&#39;re in an excellent position - and we&#39;re well on the way to having the resources we need to win this thing.
I&#39;m humbled daily by your support and the faith you place in me. Thank you. I am grateful.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
