Dear Friend,
From Westlake to Wooster, I consistently
hear that Ohioans are frustrated with the
slow pace of job creation. I, too, am
concerned about our stagnant economy and
Washingtons inability to come
together to jumpstart it. Last
months jobs report was one of the
worst we have seen in recent months; it
should serve as a wakeup call for my
colleagues in the Senate who have yet to
act on the dozens of House-passed jobs
bills. How much longer is the Senate going
to make Americans wait for the economic
growth that we need?
This past week, I was proud to see the
House of Representatives pass the Jobs for
America Act, a package of bills that
contains dozens of solutions that will help
get Americans back to work and lower costs
for Ohio families. Two of the bills
included in the package specifically
address the job-crushing effect of the
Presidents health care law. The Hire
More Heroes Act encourages small businesses
to hire more veterans because it exempts
veterans who receive health insurance
through the Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA) or TRICARE from being counted toward
the 50 full-time employee threshold to
provide insurance as required by the
employer mandate in the Presidents
health care law. This bill has strong
bipartisan support and will certainly
incentivize employers to hire those who
have served our country and are returning
to the workforce. I was also pleased to see
the Save American Workers Act pass the
House with strong support this past week.
This bill repeals the 30-hour definition of
full-time employment in the
Presidents health care law, allowing
small business owners the opportunity to
grow without fearing uncertainty and
increasing costs.
In addition to the bills that mitigate
the negative effects of the
Presidents health care law on our
workforce, the House passed legislation
that will reduce unnecessary federal
regulations on small businesses and help
them create the jobs that we need. One of
the bills, the Regulations from the
Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act, will
reduce additional burdensome regulations by
requiring Congress to approve any new major
regulation issued by a federal agency
before it takes effect. Another bill,
theSmall Business Capital Access and
Job Preservation Act, scales back
government mandates and provides small
businesses with greater access to the
capital they need so that they can more
easily create jobs. Lastly, the America's
Small Business Tax Relief Act makes section
179 expensing of our tax code permanent -
ensuring that our small businesses have the
predictability they need to grow their
business and plan for their financial
futures.
As a former small business owner for
nearly 30 years, I know that Washington is
part of the problem, not the solution, when
it comes to growing a business. The
legislation we passed last week empowers
our entrepreneurs, encourages innovation,
and incites investment so that we can turn
our economy around and get Ohioans back to
work. Im hopeful that my colleagues
in the Senate will carefully review this
legislation and reverse its pattern of
inaction. Americans cannot wait much
longer.
