Dear Friends,
The mental health and criminal justice systems in this country are not working. Our jails are de facto institutions for the mentally ill. We warehouse and ignore people instead of providing health care and healing.
All too often, I hear of individuals suffering from severe mental illness who are in jail or emergency rooms because no treatment options were available. This is simply unacceptable. We must invest in prevention, treatment and tools to keep individuals with mental illness in the community, with the necessary services and supports.
Recently, I worked with my colleagues to pass a measure to support an increase in funding to help state and local governments provide treatment to individuals with mental illness instead of inappropriately funneling them into the criminal justice system. By equipping police officers with additional tools to help recognize and respond to mental health crises, interactions between officers and people experiencing mental illness will result in treatment, not jail. Better training for law enforcement and first responders will help de-escalate potentially dangerous situations, and alleviate harm to the person in crisis.
Building on this momentum, I will continue to fight in Congress for better resources for our criminal justice and mental health systems.
These are issues that affect us all in our communities. It&rsquo;s far past time that we stop ignoring and find solutions that promote healing. I look forward to staying in touch.
Sincerely,
Earl Blumenauer
Member of Congress
