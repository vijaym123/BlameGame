Representative
Scott
Perry
January 1, 2015
The New Year is a hopeful time when we celebrate an end and hope for a great beginning. Please accept my sincere wishes for a happy, healthy, safe and prosperous New Year.
In 2015, America will continue to face serious challenges. Too many of our neighbors still seek good-paying jobs, and we continue to face increasing danger around the world.
Although 2015 will continue to bring serious challenges, it also marks a beginning of hope again. Restoring economic opportunities for everyone wont be easy, and our foreign threats seem to grow every day, but this country is no stranger to challenge. We need only to unleash the unlimited potential of our people and be guided by our convictions to strengthen our Nation, and ensure that the country we leave to future generations is stronger than the one we inherited.
On behalf of my family, Happy New Year!
