Stamping "Made In America" on U.S. Energy Pipelines
Dear Friend,
We cannot rebuild America's economy and infrastructure, create the
millions of good paying middle class jobs we need across Minnesota's
Iron Range, and protect ourselves from terribly destructive oil spills,
with energy pipeline made from inferior, accident prone foreign steel
dumped into U.S. markets by multi-national corporations whose only
interest is making money.
Joined by a contingent of local Steelworkers who mine iron ore and
taconite that go into American steel pipelines - the best and safest in
the world - that was my message in announcing The American Pipeline
Jobs and Safety Act of 2014 (H.R. 4441) last Thursday in Eveleth.
In a nutshell, the bill requires that for the very first time,
virtually all energy pipelines built and federally permitted in the
United States contain 100 percent American steel - steel from ore that
is mined, processed or reprocessed in America. The bill marks the first
time American iron ore and taconite workers are included in the federal
"Buy American" steel provisions. And the first time private
transactions are subject to American preference laws.
Moreover, the bill adds teeth to the pipeline inspection process by
providing the agency responsible for permitting pipelines - the
Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration - with funds and
authority to independently inspect pipeline before it's installed.
This is a "Buy America" jobs bill. As the energy boom continues,
imports of steel pipeline from South Korea, India, China, and Canada
have doubled in just the past two years. Experts tell us if that trend
continues, we could see the closing of 10 to 12 U.S. steel mills, and
the loss of more than 50,000 good paying, middle class American jobs.
And this is an environmental and safety bill. The timing is right. As
the U.S. imports more and more foreign steel and steel pipeline,
serious spills and life threatening accidents are increasing
exponentially. The TransCanada Pipeline, which is using almost 100%
steel produced in India, has already incurred some 30 major spills. In
the years I spent living and working in and near Middle East oil
fields, it was a widely accepted fact that American steel pipeline is
by far the safest and most reliable in the world.
I hope you will take time to read the Mesabi Daily News account of our
press conference and more details about the importance of the timing of
this bill by clicking the front page above. I will keep you informed as
progress continues. And as always, I welcome your good counsel. Just
contact me on my website. Have a great week.
Sincerely,

We Delivered - Teamsters, UPS, and Me
I rode shotgun on a UPS truck delivering packages with U.S. Army
Reserve Sergeant Jim Zahn, who has served three tours of duty - in
Bosnia, Kuwait and Iraq. Compared to those assignments, he said
teaching the UPS ropes to a Congressman was a piece of cake.
I worked my way through the University of Minnesota as a UPS employee
and proud member of Teamsters Local 638, so it was great to tour the
UPS facility in Duluth, enjoy rolls and coffee with fellow Teamsters,
and spend Friday morning on the route in UPS "browns" delivering
packages all over the city's west side.
As I told workers and managers, the decades old partnership between UPS
and the Teamsters is one of the best examples ever of union-management
cooperation. UPS is a truly great American success story where hard
work and efficient services are rewarded with good pay and employee
promotions from within the company. This policy creates good morale and
a smart management team that knows every aspect of the business, and
provides customers with world class "Make it in America" service. UPS
is especially proud of its expanding use of biofuels in its trucks, and
its policy of seeking out and hiring veterans who have served our
nation at home and abroad.

Duluth Airshow Features Raptor, Thunderbolt, and Lightning
Announcing the lineup for this summer's Duluth Airshow with its
President and founder, Ryan Kern.
Along with the 148th Fighter Wing, Cirrus Aircraft, and the beautiful
new Duluth International Airport, the Duluth Air Show (August 23-24 at
Duluth International Airport) highlights Duluth as a mecca for
aviation. With an estimated 70,000 viewers, it's the biggest spectator
event in northern Minnesota and the largest airshow anywhere in the
region. So as honorary chairman of this year's event, I was pleased to
join airshow President Ryan Kern on Friday to announce an all-star
lineup, including an appearance by the famed Navy Blue Angels flying
team and the rarely seen F-22 Raptor stealth fighter, along with the
Air Force's Heritage Flight, including two legendary WWII aircraft: the
P-47 Thunderbolt and the P-38 Lightning.
I am particularly proud to have helped secure participation this year
by the National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA). NASA will
present its interactive exhibit featuring equipment from the Space
Shuttle and will feature education programs for children ages 6-10. You

Minnesota Chippewa Set National Example for Elder Safety
Chief Executive of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe Melanie Benjamin and
Leech Lake Chairwoman Carrie Jones and I discussed efforts by the
Minnesota Chippewa Tribe to prevent elder abuse while they were in
Washington earlier this year as my guests for the President's State of
the Union Address.
The Minnesota Chippewa Tribe has established a national example for
excellence in providing Elders and their families with medical care,
nutrition, housing, education, and caregiver programs that promote a
sacred circle of mental, physical, spiritual, and emotional wellness.
So I was honored to deliver welcoming remarks to this year's Conference
on Elder Abuse in Walker, sponsored jointly by the Leech Lake, Boise
Forte, Fond du Lac, Grand Portage, Mille Lacs, and White Earth
reservations. The conference focused on innovative programs designed to
prevent Elders from being subjected to neglect, fraud, abuse and other
illegal activities. You can read more about the conference, as well as

Finally...
"Ruk-U" Rocks the Range
What a well-deserved honor! My dear friend and intrepid Iron Range
staffer, former Minnesota Representative Tom Rukavina, now has a
building named after him. The Tom Rukavina Engineering Center
(everybody's calling it "RUK-U") at Mesabi Range College in Virginia
was dedicated on Friday as testimony to Tom's work as a legislator to
secure funding for a four-year engineering degree at that fine
institution. In Tom's words: "It's a dream that I had and that a lot of
the students had, that they could get a four-year engineering degree,
go to work, and stay on the Range if they chose to do so. I'm really
happy that out of the fifty graduates, two-thirds of them are working
right here in Northeastern Minnesota." The program began in 2009, and
the first graduates got their degrees in 2011.

Report
from
Representative
Rick
Nolan
Stamping
"Made
In
America"
on
U.S.
Energy
Pipelines
Dear
Friend,
We
cannot
rebuild
America&#8217;s
economy
and
infrastructure,
create
the
millions
of
good
paying
middle
class
jobs
we
need
across
Minnesota&#8217;s
Iron
Range,
and
protect
ourselves
from
terribly
destructive
oil
spills,
with
energy
pipeline
made
from
inferior,
accident
prone
foreign
steel
dumped
into
U.S.
markets
by
multi-national
corporations
whose
only
interest
is
making
money.
Joined
by
a
contingent
of
local
Steelworkers
who
mine
iron
ore
and
taconite
that
go
into
American
steel
pipelines
&#8211;
the
best
and
safest
in
the
world
&#8211;
that
was
my
message
in
announcing
The
American
Pipeline
Jobs
and
Safety
Act
of
2014
(H.R.
4441)
last
Thursday
in
Eveleth.
In
a
nutshell,
the
bill
requires
that
for
the
very
first
time,
virtually
all
energy
pipelines
built
and
federally
permitted
in
the
United
States
contain
100
percent
American
steel
&#8211;
steel
from
ore
that
is
mined,
processed
or
reprocessed
in
America.
The
bill
marks
the
first
time
American
iron
ore
and
taconite
workers
are
included
in
the
federal
"Buy
American"
steel
provisions.
And
the
first
time
private
transactions
are
subject
to
American
preference
laws.
Moreover,
the
bill
adds
teeth
to
the
pipeline
inspection
process
by
providing
the
agency
responsible
for
permitting
pipelines
&#8211;
the
Pipeline
and
Hazardous
Materials
Safety
Administration
&#8211;
with
funds
and
authority
to
independently
inspect
pipeline
before
it&#8217;s
installed.
This
is
a
"Buy
America"
jobs
bill .
As
the
energy
boom
continues,
imports
of
steel
pipeline
from
South
Korea,
India,
China,
and
Canada
have
doubled
in
just
the
past
two
years.
Experts
tell
us
if
that
trend
continues,
we
could
see
the
closing
of
10
to
12
U.S.
steel
mills,
and
the
loss
of
more
than
50,000
good
paying,
middle
class
American
jobs.
And
this
is
an
environmental
and
safety
bill .
The
timing
is
right.
As
the
U.S.
imports
more
and
more
foreign
steel
and
steel
pipeline,
serious
spills
and
life
threatening
accidents
are
increasing
exponentially.
The
TransCanada
Pipeline,
which
is
using
almost
100%
steel
produced
in
India,
has
already
incurred
some
30
major
spills.
In
the
years
I
spent
living
and
working
in
and
near
Middle
East
oil
fields,
it
was
a
widely
accepted
fact
that
American
steel
pipeline
is
by
far
the
safest
and
most
reliable
in
the
world .
I
hope
you
will
take
time
to
read
the
Mesabi

News

of
our
press
conference
and

about
the
importance

the
timing
of
this
bill

as
progress
continues.

who
has
served
three
tours
of

&#8211;
in
Bosnia,
Kuwait
and
Iraq.
Compared
to
those
assignments,
he
said
teaching
the
UPS
ropes
to
a
Congressman
was
a
piece
of

I
worked
my

through
the
University
of
Minnesota

a
UPS
employee

of
Teamsters
Local

it
was

and
spend
Friday
morning
on
the

"browns"
delivering

all
over
the

west
side.
As
I
told
workers
and
managers,
the
decades
old
partnership
between
UPS
and
the
Teamsters
is
one
of
the
best
examples
ever
of
union-management
cooperation.
UPS
is
a
truly
great
American
success
story
where
hard
work
and
efficient
services
are
rewarded
with
good
pay
and
employee
promotions
from
within
the
company .
This
policy
creates
good
morale
and
a
smart
management
team
that
knows
every
aspect
of
the
business,
and
provides
customers
with
world
class
"Make

America"
service.
UPS
is
especially
proud
of
its
expanding
use
of
biofuels
in

and
its
policy
of
seeking
out

hiring
veterans
who
have
served
our

"Ruk-U"
Rocks
the
Range
What
a
well-deserved
honor!
My
dear
friend
and
intrepid
Iron
Range
staffer,
former
Minnesota
Representative
Tom
Rukavina ,
now
has
a
building
named
after
him.
The
Tom
Rukavina
Engineering
Center
(everybody&#8217;s
calling
it
"RUK-U")
at
Mesabi
Range
College
in
Virginia
was
dedicated
on
Friday
as
testimony
to
Tom&#8217;s
work
as
a
legislator
to
secure
funding
for
a
four-year
engineering
degree
at
that
fine
institution.
In
Tom&#8217;s
words:
"It's
a
dream
that
I
had
and
that
a
lot
of
the
students
had,
that
they
could
get
a
four-year
engineering
degree,
go
to
work,
and
stay
on
the
Range
if
they
chose
to
do
so.
I'm
really
happy
that
out
of
the
fifty
graduates,
two-thirds
of
them
are
working
right
here
in
Northeastern
Minnesota."
The
program
began
in
2009,
and
the
first
graduates
got
their
degrees
in
2011.
