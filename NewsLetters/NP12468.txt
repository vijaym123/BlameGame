SA to DC Trip a Success, Veterans Amendment Passes House, Farm Bill
Signed into Law
Dear Friend,
This week business leaders, elected officials and constituents from San
Antonio were in DC as part of the 20th annual "SA to DC" trip. During
the trip, San Antonio community members met with federal officials and
agencies in our nation's capital to leverage resources and projects
that create jobs in Texas. Here's a wrap up of the week.
SA to DC Visit a Success
I was glad to meet with many San Antonians on issues ranging from
tourism and commerce to higher education to small business ownership.
We talked about community support for our military troops and their
families relocating to San Antonio and surrounding areas. We also
talked about how we can all help each other. I always love visiting
with people from home - especially when talking about things that can
improve San Antonio's economy.
Thank you to Greater San Antonio &
Hispanic Chambers of Commerce for their efforts and willingness to stop
by to meet with us. We are already working on requests to help bring
more federal resources to Texas.
Veteran Amendment Included in Sportsmen Heritage and Recreation
Enhancement Act
The House recently passed the Sportsmen Heritage and Recreation
Enhancement Act. I was able to amend the bill during the process to
ensures that veterans are included as members of the Wildlife and
Hunting Heritage Conservation Council Advisory Committee. Recently,
programs around the country have initiated treatment for wounded
warriors using the great outdoors as part of the therapy.
This
amendment gives veterans a voice and vote on governmental issues -- the
men and women who served our country. The Advisory Council provides
recommendations to the government regarding the use of public lands.
The 23rd District of Texas is home to about 55,000 veterans, many of
whom enjoy outdoor activities. The district also contains vast federal
land along the Rio Grande. The bill passed the House on Wednesday and
moves to the Senate for consideration. To watch the Floor debate on the
amendment, click here

House Armed Service Committee Hearing
This week, I participated in a House Armed Services Committee hearing
where we heard testimony about threats our country and world face from
Al Qaeda, its affiliates and associated groups. As a member of the
Armed Services Committee, I take my job of helping to secure our
country from terrorist threats very seriously. Just as important, I
work to provide our service men and women the equipment and resources
they need to get the job done. We must work together - Democrats and
Republicans - for the well-being of our country, its people and our
national security - always. To watch me ask questions to the panel
during the House Armed Services Committee hearing, click here
.
Farm Bill Signed into Law
The Farm Bill was signed into law on Friday. I'm glad that Republicans
and Democrats came together on this important piece of legislation.
Miracles continue to happen in Congress. This is the third major piece
of legislation Congress has agreed on in the past weeks, setting a
record for as long as I've been serving. The bill keeps our agriculture
industry strong by allowing farmers and ranchers to better plan for
future seasons.
Presidio Post Office Open 24/7
We received the good news from the U.S. Postal Service that the
Presidio Post Office Lobby is now open 24 hours a day, seven days a
week, since Jan. 31. This new schedule makes it more convenient for
customers to pick up their mail and send letters and payments. I will
continue to work with the U.S. Postal Service to make mail service and
delivery more customer-centered.
Lastly, thanks for letting me be your congressman. If I can help you
with a federal agency or issue, please call on any of our offices. The
phone numbers and addresses are listed below.
I've never been a big
fan of politics, so doing things that help people is my favorite part
of the job.
Please put us to work for you.
Sincerely,
Pete P. Gallego

in
Texas.

our

face
from
Al

As

member
of
the

Committee,
I
take
my
job
of
helping
to
secure
our
country
from
terrorist
threats
very
seriously.
Just
as
important,
I
work
to
provide
our
service
men
and
women
the
equipment
and
resources
they
need
to
get
the
job
done.
We
must
work
together
&#8211;
Democrats
and
Republicans
&#8211;
for
the
well-being
of
our
country,
its
people
and
our

Miracles
