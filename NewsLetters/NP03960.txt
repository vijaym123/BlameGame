Expanding Pre-K In Virginia
Dear Friends,
Today, the U.S. Department of Education announced that Virginia will receive a $17.5 million Preschool Development Grant to increase access to early childhood education through the Virginia Preschool Initiative. In October, I wrote a letter to the Department of Education urging the department to award the grant to Virginia.
Investing in early childhood education helps close the achievement gap between children of all backgrounds. That&rsquo;s why as Governor I worked with members of both parties to improve the Virginia Preschool Initiative and increase enrollment by 40 percent. Virginia&rsquo;s early childhood education programs are a model for the nation and I am a proud supporter of their expansion.

Sincerely,
Senator Tim Kaine
