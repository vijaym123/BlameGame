Dear Friend,
Today the
President signed the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act, H.R. 3370
into law. This law will bring relief to millions of people across the
country and over 200,000 homeowners in Louisiana who have been
suffering from the rising flood insurance premiums over the past two years.
This legislation is an example of what we can accomplish when we work
together. Many of you have shared your compelling stories with me
about undue strain that exorbitant rates have placed on your homes and
businesses. As a result, I immediately got to work on meaningful
legislation that would address the issues you were facing. I co-authored this
bill and wrote in many of the new benefits mentioned below. With the
support of my colleagues in the House of Representatives, we garnered
bipartisan support in both the House and Senate.
Having the
President sign this bill into law is a clear demonstration of what we can
accomplish by setting aside partisan differences and working on behalf
of the American people.
When this law goes into effect you can
expect more affordable rates, more accurate flood maps, and more
accountability from FEMA. Before this legislation, FEMA had no limitations
on how high they could raise rates on individual policyholders. Moving
forward we established a cap on yearoveryear rate increases for
individuals, which before was unlimited, and brought the cap down to 18%.
The law ensures that the models FEMA uses to create new flood maps
are the best and use the most accurate data available. Furthermore, FEMA
must now keep track of how many businesses, non-profits, and churches
are policyholders within the program and monitor and report on
affordability for those policies. If FEMA finds detrimental effects on these
policyholders, it must provide recommendations to Congress that
address those effects, in order to guarantee accountability.
The
measures we have taken will be a real solution to a flawed flood
insurance system. The work we have done on this issue goes beyond party
affiliation and protects you and our community, which is the fundamental
purpose of Congress. As issues such as these arise, be assured I will
continue to heed your calls to action and be your voice in
Washington.
Sincerely,
Congressman
Cedric Richmond
