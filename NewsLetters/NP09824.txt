Rokita Readings
A clickable offering of books and articles that I've read recently and
highly recommend, as we strive together to "Keep the Republic."
Featured as a Rokita Reading in this edition, is a column that I
recently read in the Wall Street Journal by Nicholas Simmons titled
"What I've Learned Teaching Charter Students
."
I found this column particularly fitting because the House considered
and passed Charter School Program reform legislation this week.
Simmons tells his compelling first-hand report on his work as a math
teacher in a Harlem charter school.
I encourage you to give it a read
as you review the work the House did this week on charter schools and
to fully understand the amazing impact many charter schools are having
on our young students..

Reforming Education - Research and Charter Schools Bills Pass House
This week, the House passed two important bipartisan education bills
that I introduced in my role as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Early
Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education.
Strengthening Education through Research Act
H.R. 4366 will improve education research, ensuring teachers, students,
parents, and policymakers can access more useful information about
successful education practices.
Watch my remarks on the floor in support of this bill here
.
The legislation will take steps to streamline the education research
system and reduce overlap and duplicative research efforts.
The bill
will also require regular evaluation of research and review the
efficacy of federal education programs, ensuring taxpayer resources are
being put to good use.
The bill passed the House on Thursday night via
voice vote.
Click here for more information on the bill
.
Success and Opportunity through Quality Charter Schools Act
On Friday, the House considered and passed the bipartisan Charter
Schools bill I co-authored and helped lead passage of.
You can see my floor remarks in support of this bill here
.
This bill strengthens the Charter School Program and allows successful
charter school models to be replicated nationwide to support choice,
innovation, and excellence in education.
School choice is critical for
so many families as they determine the education needs of children.
Learn more about this Charter Schools Program reform bill here

Questioning Big Labor in College Sports
On Thursday, the full Education and the Workforce Committee held a
hearing titled "Big Labor on College Campuses: Examining the
Consequences of Unionizing Student Athletes
."
The
hearing was scheduled due to a recent decision by the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) that classified certain student athletes at
Northwestern University as "employees" for the purposes of collective
bargaining.
My questions focused on the possible consequences of the NLRB's
decision and the impact it would have on schools in the 4th District
like Purdue and St. Joseph's College.
You can watch my exchange with witnesses here
.

archived webcast, please visit the committee website

Fighting for the Truth - House Creates Benghazi Committee
On Wednesday, the House voted to form a Select Committee to expand the
investigation into the Benghazi terrorist attacks on the diplomatic
outposts in Libya that killed four Americans - U.S. Ambassador Chris
Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods, and Glen Doherty.
My good friend, Representative Trey Gowdy (R-SC)
has been selected to serve as chairman of the committee.
Reps. Rokita & Gowdy during a hearing in 2013
I fully support Speaker Boehner's decision to appoint Rep. Gowdy to
serve as Chairman.
Having been in private practice, and in serving
with Trey on the Education and Workforce Committee, I can say he is an
exceptional litigator and a talented leader who will give this
important matter the attention it deserves.
There are few in Congress
whom I spend more time with in Washington than Trey Gowdy, and now a
lot more of America will witness the service to country that he brings.
He will ensure that the memories of the four slain Americans are
respected and that the facts of the matter will be realized.
To date, several House committees have conducted investigations on the
Benghazi attacks as it relates to their specific jurisdiction.
The
select committee will centralize all aspects into one committee.
The
House created the committee in response to a court-ordered release of
White House emails regarding the attacks that the White House failed to
disclose to congressional committees requested via subpoena
.

Protecting America's Internet Interests - DOTCOM Clears Committee
On Thursday, the Energy and Commerce Committee advanced legislation I
introduced, H.R. 4342, the Domain Openness Through Continued Oversight
Matters (DOTCOM) Act of 2014.
The DOTCOM Act would prohibit the Department of Commerce's National
Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA) from turning over
its domain name system oversight responsibilities pending a Government
Accountability Office (GAO) report to Congress.It now awaits action by
the full House.
The internet is the single greatest economic machine created in the
last 50 years and it is a shining example of our American
Exceptionalism. It is against our own national economic interest to
relinquish control, especially without a clear path forward that will
protect internet freedom.

Questioning
Big
Labor
in
College
Sports
On
Thursday,
the
full
Education
and
the
Workforce
Committee
held
a
hearing titled
&#8220; Big
Labor
on
College
Campuses:
Examining
the
Consequences
of
Unionizing
Student
Athletes .&#8221;
The
hearing
was
scheduled
due
to
a
recent
decision
by
the
National
Labor
Relations
Board
(NLRB)
that
classified
certain
student
athletes
at
Northwestern
University
as
&#8220;employees&#8221;
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining.
My questions
focused
on
the possible
consequences
of
the
NLRB's
decision
and
the
impact
it
would
have
on
schools
in
the
4th
District
like
Purdue
and
St.
Joseph&#8217;s
College.

Fighting
for
the
Truth
-
House
Creates
Benghazi
Committee
On
Wednesday,
the
House
voted
to form
a
Select
Committee
to
expand
the
investigation
into
the
Benghazi
terrorist
attacks
on
the
diplomatic
outposts
in
Libya
that
killed
four
Americans
-
U.S.
Ambassador
Chris
Stevens,
Sean
Smith,
Tyrone
Woods,
and
Glen
Doherty .
My
good
friend,
Representative
Trey
Gowdy
(R-SC)
has
been
selected
to
serve
as
chairman
of
the
committee.
Reps.
Rokita
&amp;
Gowdy
during
a
hearing
in
2013
I
fully
support
Speaker
Boehner's
decision
to
appoint Rep.
Gowdy
to
serve
as
Chairman.
Having
been
in
private
practice,
and
in
serving
with
Trey
on
the
Education
and
Workforce
Committee,
I
can
say
he
is
an
exceptional
litigator
and
a
talented
leader
who
will
give
this
important
matter
the
attention
it
deserves.
There
are
few
in
Congress
whom
I
spend
more
time
with
in
Washington
than
Trey
Gowdy,
and
now
a
lot
more
of
America
will
witness
the
service
to
country
that
he
brings.
He
will
ensure
that
the
memories
of
the
four
slain
Americans
are
respected
and
that
the
facts
of
the
matter
will
be
realized.
To
date,
several
House
committees
have
conducted
investigations
on
the
Benghazi
attacks
as
it
relates
to
their
specific
jurisdiction.
The
select
committee
will
centralize
all
aspects
into
one
committee.
The
House
created
the
committee
in
response
to
a
court-ordered
release
of
White
House
emails
regarding
the
attacks
that
the
White
House
failed
to
disclose
to
congressional
committees
requested
via
subpoena .
