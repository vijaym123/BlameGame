Dear
Friend,
I supported the passage of the
bi-partisan and bicameral Omnibus Spending Bill yesterday because it does
away with the meaningless budget sequester that hurt American families
by indiscriminately slashing funding to important government programs
such as Head Start, new pre-K initiatives, infrastructure investments,
and funding for the Affordable Care Act. However, I did so with
reservations about its failure to address imminent flood insurance premium
increases, an issue exacerbated by Super Storm Sandy.
The Omnibus Spending Bill included an
amendment that will ensure grandfathered policies maintain their government
subsidies until 2015.
I spoke on the House Floor explaining that
this is a minimal win because the subsidies were supposed to be removed
gradually over 5 years.
Moreover, FEMA was not yet fully
implementing the gradual removal of subsidies for these policies because the
new flood maps are not yet ready.
The bigger problem that is
not addressed by this amendment is with newer policies, those not
grandfathered, or policies written for a property recently sold.
These
are the policies experiencing very high flood insurance premiums and
rate increases, which need to be protected.
To rectify the
issue, I am hopeful that Congress will pass the Home-Owner Flood Insurance
Affordability Act that I am a cosponsor of, which provides a
comprehensive delay of increasing flood insurance premiums.
