In May of this year, Lois Lerner, the former Director of the Internal Revenue Service's tax-exempt division, was held in contempt of Congress for her refusal to testify regarding her role in an IRS scandal where government officials targeted politically active conservative groups for increased scrutiny on applications for tax-exempt status.
As a part of ongoing Congressional probes, a formal request for Lerner's email records was made.
However, the IRS - responding to these requests - claimed a crash of Lerner's computer hard drive and the recycling of backup tapes as reasons for their inability to provide the records to Congress.
IRS Commissioner John Koskinen recently
testified
that he learned about a problem with Lerners computer in February and about the missing emails in April; however, the IRS did not notify Congress of the problem until June.
In response, Congressman Forbes
called
not only for an independent special counsel to lead the investigation, but also for independent computer forensics investigators to recover this critical information.
Question of the week:
Do you believe an independent special counsel should be appointed to lead the IRS investigation?
( ) Yes.
( ) No.
( ) I dont know.
( ) Other.
