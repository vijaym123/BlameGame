Dear Friend,
Far too many West Tennesseans are struggling to find jobs or the hours
they need to make ends meet. Which is why I am pleased to host a West
Tennessee Jobs Fair as an opportunity to help connect area employers
with potential new hires.
I encourage all residents of the 8th Congressional District to attend
my Jobs Fair and share this information with anyone they know looking
for work in this uncertain economy.
