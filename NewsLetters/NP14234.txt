Working to
Allow Americans to Keep Their Health
Plans
Dear Friend,
Last week, the House approved legislation
to allow Fifth District families to keep
their health care policies in 2014. H.R.
3350, the Keep Your Health Plan Act, passed
the House with bipartisan support.
Millions of Americans have received
notification that their health plans have
been cancelled as a result of the
Presidents health care overhaul. The
Administration has acknowledged that their
promise that Americans who like their health
care plans would be able to keep them has not
been fulfilled. Our office has received
thousands of messages pleading that we put an
end to this damaging law. One Fifth District
family in Franklin County saw its premium
double from $600 to $1,200. Another Fifth
District family in Danville saw its
deductible go from $500 to $1,750.
The President offered administrative
fixes to the legislation, which
were yet another instance of backtracking
because of the unsustainability of his health
care law. These clerical corrections will not
reverse the damaging effects of this law in
the end. That is why the House took action
last week to free Americans from the
expensive premiums brought on by this law for
another year. Not only does the Keep Your
Health Plan Act allow Americans to keep their
policies, but it also ensures that those who
choose to keep their health plans would not
face a penalty under the individual
mandate.
Ultimately, we must work toward full
repeal and replacement of the law, but until
we are able to achieve this, we must delay
its implementation. I am encouraged by last
weeks passage of the Keep Your Health
Care Act, as it brings us closer to freeing
Americans from the burdensome regulations of
the Presidents health care law.

Robert visited Meriwether Lewis Elementary
in Charlottesville to recognize them for
being named a National Blue Ribbon School by
the U.S. Department of Education for their
academic superiority and student
achievement.
Robert met with Jennifer Donovan Meyer of
the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in
Charlottesville.
