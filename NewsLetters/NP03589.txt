2014:
A Success,
But Still a Lot of Work to Do
Op-Ed by
Congressman Dan Lipinski
printed in
Southwest News-Herald
January 9,
2015
This is a time when a lot of people are reflecting on last
year and making goals for the new year.
While some of you may
have checked almost everything off your to do list last year, many
(probably most) of us have brought back a lot of the same goals for this
year.
Congress is certainly in the second group,
again.
But in spite of Congress lack of action, there were a few
important items that I was able to get done in 2014 that will help make 2015
and the future better for many Americans.
After many years
of hard work, my bipartisan legislation to boost domestic
manufacturing and American jobs by requiring a National Strategic Plan for
Manufacturing became law right before Christmas.
The bill requires that
at least every four years the president works with public and private
stakeholders to produce and publish a plan to promote American
manufacturing.
In addition, every year the presidents budget
blueprint will have to contain an explanation of how it promotes the most
recent manufacturing strategy.
This bill guarantees that Washington
has to pay attention to what can be done to help manufacturers and
workers.
Getting this provision into law can really make a
difference by leading to economic growth, increased American security, and
more middle class jobs that pay hard-working Americans a good wage.
I look forward to finding many more Made in USA labels on products
we see in our stores and online.
A much-needed major
Veterans Affairs Reform Bill was also passed earlier in the
year.
Having spent a lot of time hearing and reading vets personal
stories of the shameful care they received from the VA, I fought for this
bill that provides much-needed reform.
Another important
piece of legislation that became law in 2014 was the Water Resources
Reform and Development Act. The bill didnt get a lot of press coverage,
but it is vital for freight transportation and will help take traffic
off roads and rails. It also helps battle the spread of Asian carp that
threaten our Great Lakes.
Critical bipartisan legislation
that I first introduced back in 2010 that will increase the security of
federal cyber networks and information systems, improve the transfer
of cybersecurity technologies to the marketplace, train a
cybersecurity workforce, and coordinate and prioritize federal cybersecurity
research and development efforts has also finally passed through the
Congress.
Every day, we wake up to reports of more cyber
attacks.
Individuals are having their identities stolen while businesses and
their workers are being damaged daily by cyber espionage; thats why
it has been a priority of mine to get this bill onto the Presidents
desk to help America thwart cyber attacks.
Finally, thanks to
legislation that I recently got passed through Congress, Chicagos
Mount Greenwood Post Office will be renamed the Captain Herbert Johnson
Memorial Post Office Building, after Captain Herbie Johnson, who died
on November 2, 2012, at the age of 54, while battling flames in the
attic of a two-story home on Chicagos South Side.
Believe it or
not, last year there was a moratorium in the House of Representatives
on the naming of postal facilities.
Thankfully that policy was
reversed.
Naming a postal facility honoring Captain Johnson is not
just a tribute to him and his family, but all first responders who
bravely put their lives on the line every day, often for people they
dont even know.
2015 brings a new look to
Congress.
Hopefully, there will be a renewed focus from both sides of the
aisle to work together to pass a long term transportation bill, create an
economic environment that promotes the growth of high-quality jobs,
strengthen Social Security and Medicare, and, in keeping with a popular
New Years Resolution, trim some fat.
