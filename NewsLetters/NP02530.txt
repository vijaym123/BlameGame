Dear Friend, The latest act of the Keystone XL Kabuki theater has just played out, and there was no surprise plot twist.
President Obama vetoed a bill because it would have helped Canadian oil companies and the Koch brothers at the expense of the American economy and environment. Good, I say.
Here&rsquo;s what else I say:
can we get to work on something that has a chance of becoming law, please?
I understand that it&rsquo;s good political theater for Republicans to placate their Big Oil backers, or to hold yet another &ldquo;statement&rdquo; vote to mollify the Tea Party. But political theater rarely, if ever, does anything to help middle class families.
Democrats in the Senate have a number of ideas for how to grow the middle class. The president has come out in support of free community college, affordable child care, and a higher minimum wage. All of those ideas are good public policy.
What are the Republican-sponsored alternatives? Well, there aren&rsquo;t any.
They don&rsquo;t have any new ideas, because having new ideas would require admitting that some of their old ideas didn&rsquo;t work.
That&rsquo;s why, fifteen years into the 21st century, the Republican Senate tried to pump out one of the 20th century&rsquo;s dirtiest fossil fuels. The Senate needs to focus on policies that will grow the entire American economy, not just Big Oil. Help me keep fighting for a Senate that works -- contribute $5, or more if you can.
