Dear Friend, When the Tea Party took over the House, Washington ground to a halt.
Anything that would move the country forward became nearly impossible to accomplish.
Instead, we progressives had to play defense, so that Medicare didn&rsquo;t get turned into a voucher program and so our clean air and water protections weren&rsquo;t completely gutted. But this November, we get to play offense. There&rsquo;s a thin blue line keeping the Senate from falling to the Tea Party, and I&rsquo;m part of it. I need your help to keep the Senate blue -- can you contribute $5 toward our $20,000 goal for May?

Or donate another amount.
The Tea Party didn&rsquo;t take over the House on its own -- they had the Koch brothers and Karl Rove bankrolling them, and they&rsquo;re trying to replicate that victory in the Senate. In 2010, outside interests like the Koch brothers spent nearly $300 million.
That&rsquo;s a huge sum of money, but it&rsquo;s nothing compared to what they&rsquo;re going to spend this year. Just this month, the Koch brothers&rsquo; Americans for Prosperity announced that it&rsquo;s going to spend $125 million on this election --
and that&rsquo;s just one group.
We need to hold the thin blue line in the Senate. If Republicans can pick up six Senate seats, they&rsquo;ll control all of Congress. I am not going to let that happen, because their policies would be an absolute disaster for the middle class.
I need your help to make sure my seat doesn&rsquo;t get picked off by the Tea Party.
Please, dig deep and make a $5 donation to get us closer to our $20,000 goal.
Thank you for your help and for understanding how important this is.
