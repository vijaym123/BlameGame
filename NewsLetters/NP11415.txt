Friend,
It looks like spring is just around the corner here in Washington State
as well as in Washington D.C. You may have heard of the well-known
Cherry Blossom Festival, drawing thousands to D.C. from late March
through early April - we're expecting over 250 constituents in our
office alone. It's a terrific time (though murder on the allergies).
Please let me know if you and your family will be out visiting
Washington D.C. and my office will do all we can to make sure you enjoy
your visit.
As well as looking forward to much-needed warmer weather, I also want
to look back at a great couple of weeks we just had. I want to thank
each and every one of those who attended my "When Women Succeed,
America Succeeds" event last Friday, March 7th. In addition to Tacoma
Mayor Marilyn Strickland, over 80 community members attended to discuss
enhancing economic opportunities for women. We had great resources
available regarding financial security, food and nutrition, childcare,
job training, higher education, and housing. Thanks to all who
participated.
Ever hear the phrase, "There's an app for that?" There are now
applications for phones and computers that enable you to do nearly
everything - from counting calories to learning languages to playing
games to planning a trip. My daughters even have apps to let them dress
"virtual barbies" and work on their reading, spelling, and math. As we
look down the road, app development provides great career opportunities
for young people. This past Monday and Wednesday, we held two workshops
at UWT for students to learn more about app design, as the House App
Design Contest is now open for entries. I hope you spread the word to
any star students you know of interested in computer science or app
design and encourage them to participate. I can't wait to see the ideas
our students come up with - entries are due April 30th. More info:

An Interesting Science and Technology Committee Hearing
I attended a hearing in Science and Technology last week regarding the
use of technology to protect Americans from cyber-attacks. I heard some
interesting ideas about ways to encourage industry to have stronger
cyber security tactics. I found this information very timely as we head
toward the cyber summit next month in Tacoma. I've included a link to
the video of me asking questions in the hearing for you to check out:

The Supreme Court, Corporations, and You - Citizens United Event
Four years ago, the Supreme Court issued a decision called Citizens
United. That decision had serious ramifications on campaign finance
(allowing unlimited spending by Super PACs and mega-donors), and on our
democracy. On Tuesday, March 18th, I'll be discussing that decision and
how it affects you. Don't miss out on the opportunity to attend a
presentation at Olympic College next week where I'll be joined by David
Nelson, editor of the Kitsap Sun, and several other members of the
community to speak on various aspects of the issue. Please join us at
7pm on Tuesday, March 18th at the Bremer Student Center at Olympic
College, 1600 Chester Ave, Bremerton.
Service Academy Information Night
I also hope you can make it out to the Service Academy Information
Night I'm hosting next Wednesday, March 19th.
I'm excited to get the
word out about this exciting opportunity to students in our region who
are considering a top-tier education with service to our nation in our
armed forces. Service Academy representatives will be in attendance at
the event. It will be held from 6pm - 8pm at the Foss High School
Auditorium at 2112 S Tyler St in Tacoma
Thanks as always for reading and don't hesitate to reach out if I or my
office can be helpful to you. I'm honored to work for you.
Sincerely,
Derek Kilmer

It
looks
like
spring
is
just
around
the
corner
here
in
Washington
State
as
well
as
in
Washington
D.C.
You
may
have

of
the

As
well
as
looking

I
also
want
to
look

at
a

I
want
