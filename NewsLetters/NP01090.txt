Friend,
Last month, I came to you to ask how we can work together to solve our shared problems. Over 1,500 of your friends and neighbors took the time to share their thoughts. Many shared opinions on how to help Missouri&rsquo;s Fifth District, and how to help our entire nation. I still want to hear from you. I would like to share with you the early results, and let you know there is still time to make your voice heard.
A majority of you supported strengthening our economy and creating good jobs. I also heard many voices in support of reforming the tax code by cutting inefficient and unfair tax breaks, lowering the costs for healthcare, and defending the U.S. against threats of terrorism.
There were many of you who took the time to offer specific feedback. Let me share with you some comments that resonated:
I'm not alone in my belief that the best thing Congress can do is start working for the good of the people instead of wasting time on political infighting.
HONESTY-DO THE RIGHT THING! Not the Democrat or Republican thing - but the right thing for
ALL
concerned.
Fixing our broken political system.
I agree. Congress must get past the inaction, past our own petty factions, and past all the demagoguery and distractions. We have to create jobs, expand opportunity, and strengthen the middle class.
