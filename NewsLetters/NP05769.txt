Women in Contracting Workshop
Dear Friends,
Please join me and experts from the San Diego Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) for a free interactive discussion on contracting with the federal government.
Attendees will participate in a federal contracting 101 and Women Owned Small Business (WOSB) program workshop where they will receive contracting advice and learn about resources for county businesses.
The first hour of the event will focus on how to contract with the federal government, current procurement policy for WOSBs, and current legislative initiatives.
In the second hour, participants will hear from federal small business liaisons, including representatives from Space and Naval Warfare Systems Headquarters, Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest Division, Department of Homeland Security/Customs and Border Protection, and the General Services Administration.
There will also be plenty of time for questions and networking.
