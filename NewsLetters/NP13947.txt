House Votes to Let You #KeepYourPlan
In promoting the healthcare reform law, the President promised dozens
of times that "If you like your health care plan, you can keep your
health care plan." We now know that is not the case as nearly five
million Americans have unfortunately seen their health plans canceled
due to the Affordable Care Act. Last week, the House passed
, with my vote in support, the Keep Your Health Plan Act.
This bill allows the nearly 25,000 Nevadans whose health insurance
plans were canceled due to the Affordable Care Act to keep those plans
if they liked them.
I spoke on the House floor about a constituent whose plan was canceled
and the need to pass the Keep Your Health Plan Act. You can see my
remarks
by watching the brief video below.
JOLT Act Hits 100 Cosponsors
Increasing economic growth and setting the conditions for the private
sector to create jobs are my top priorities in Congress. One way we can
bring more jobs to Nevada is by increasing the number of international
travelers and tourists that visit the U.S. We know that when foreign
travelers visit they spend on average $4,000 a week. But right now, we
are losing the competition for global long haul travelers due to our
inefficient, bureaucratic Visa processing system.
A bill I introduced
- the JOLT Act
- would streamline this process while
maintaining national security and result in increased international
travel to the U.S. I am pleased to announce that this bill recently hit
the 100 cosponsor mark and the bipartisan support for JOLT is growing.

House are backing this job-creating bill.
House Education Committee Examines Career and Technical Education
Programs
Career and technical education (CTE) programs are critical to southern
Nevada's continued economic recovery because they allow students to
learn the skills necessary to find good paying jobs in fields like
health science, business management, and information technology.
Recently, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce held a
hearing to examine CTE programs and their importance. It is vital that
we maintain our commitment to these programs and the more than 58,000
high school and 30,000 college students around Nevada who enrolled in
one or more CTE courses last year. Unfortunately, a proposal put
forward by the Administration would result in drastic cuts to CTE
funding for Nevada. I introduced H.R. 3028
, the Career and Technical Education Equity Act, which ensures
states such as Nevada do not see more than a 10% cut in CTE funding in
a given year.
