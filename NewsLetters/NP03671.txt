Our
nation
faced many
challenges this year,
from abuses
uncovered
at the
Department
of Veterans
Affairs to
ongoing
strife in
the Middle
East. As
2014 comes
to a close,
I wanted to
update you
on some of
my work on
behalf of
our
community throughout the past year.
It is an
honor to
serve you
in Congress, and I look
forward to
championing
South
Florida's
priorities
in
2015.
Until then,
please
accept my
warmest
wishes for
a happy and
healthy New
Year!
- Ted
Deutch
In
2014,
Congressman
Ted
Deutch
continued
his
efforts
to defend the constitutionally-protected
rights
of
women from attacks on the House Judiciary Committee.
During
a hearing
on
legislation
aimed
at forbidding women
from
using
their own private
health
insurance
plans
for
abortion
services,
Ted
delivered
what
the
national
blog
ThinkProgress
called
a
"passionate
speech,"
in
defense
of
women's
rights.
During
his
remarks,
Ted
urged
his
colleagues
to put
aside
divisive
attacks
on
women's
health
and
instead
focus
on a
real
women's
agenda
that
includes
equal
pay for
equal
work
and
access
to
affordable
child
care.

Congressman
Ted
Deutch is the author of legislation
to fix
Social
Security's
broken
cost-of-living
adjustment
(COLA)
formula,
which
has
resulted
in
meager
and
often
non-existent
benefit
increases
for
Social
Security
recipients.
In
February,
Ted
scored
a major
victory
on
behalf
of
seniors when
President
Obama
dropped
a
controversial
proposal
known
as the
"chained-CPI"
from
his
2015
budget
plan.
The
chained-CPI
would
actually
make
the
COLA
problem
even
worse
by
shrinking
retirees'
benefits
as they
age.

On
March
18,
2014, Congressman Ted Deutch attended the White House ceremony in which President
Obama
presented
the
Medal
of
Honor
to 24
Army
veterans
who may
have
been
overlooked
due to previous prejudice
in the
military
against
their
race, religion, or national origin.
These
heroic
soldiers
were
discovered
during
a
review
of
Pentagon
records
mandated
by
Congress
in
response
to the
efforts
of
Mitch
Libman,
a South
Florida
man who
worked
for
decades
to find
out why
his
childhood
friend,
the
late
Private
First
Class
Leonard
Kravitz,
never
received
a Medal
of
Honor
for his
valor
during
the
Korean
War. In November 2013, Ted passed legislation enabling the 24 extraordinary soldiers identified during the review to finally receive the Medal of Honor they earned. In the
photo
above, Ted presents a congressional record to Mitch Libman commemorating his efforts at a town hall meeting in Coconut Creek, Florida.
Congressman
Ted
Deutch
is
committed
to advancing medical research and expanding services for families affected by autism and other developmental disorders. In
April,
Ted
recognized
World
Autism
Awareness
Day with
a visit
to
Rising
Tide
Car
Wash,
an
innovative
small
business
in
Parkland,
Florida
that
employs
individuals
with
autism
spectrum
disorders.
During
the
event,
Ted
discussed
the
ABLE
Act, a
bill he
co-introduced
to help
families
caring
for
disabled
children
better
manage
their
financial
needs.
In
December,
Ted had
the
opportunity
to join
a
majority
of his
colleagues
in the
House
and
Senate
to pass
the
ABLE
Act and
send it
to the
President's
desk
for
signature.
As a
member
of the
House
Judiciary
Committee
and
strong
proponent
of
privacy
rights,
Congressman
Ted
Deutch
was deeply disturbed to learn that the NSA had relied on secret laws never passed by Congress to justify abuses in its surveillance programs. In May, he voted
with a
bipartisan
majority
of his
colleagues
to pass
the USA
Freedom
Act,
which
stands
for
Uniting
and
Strengthening
America
by
Fulfilling
Rights
and
Ending
Eavesdropping Dragnet
Collection,
and
Online
Monitoring
Act.
Though the bill eventually fell victim to a Republican filibuster in the Senate, Ted remains determined to work across the aisle in 2015 to protect Americans' civil rights and liberties.
Congressman Ted Deutch became Ranking
Democrat
on the
House
Foreign
Affairs
Committee's influential Subcommittee on the Middle
East and North Africa at the start of the 113th Congress. This
June,
Ted was
on a
fact-finding
mission in the Middle East with
Subcommittee
Chariman Illeana
Ros
Lehtinen
(R-FL)
when
three
innocent
Israeli
teens,
Gilad
Shaar,
Naftali
Frankel
and
Eyal
Yifrac, were
murdered
by
Hamas
terrorists.
After
attending
the
funeral
of the
victims,
Ted
condemned
their
killings
as well
as the
murder
of a
Palestinian
teen in
the
days
thereafter. After Hamas launched a campaign of rocket
attacks aimed
at
killing
innocent
Israelis, the terrorist organization used Palestinian civilians as human shields in an effort to
incite
international
criticism
of
Israeli
Defense
Forces'
operations.
A
staunch
ally of
Israel,
upon
returning
to
Washington
Ted
introduced
a
resolution
condemning
the use
of
human
shields
by
Hamas
and
other
terrorist
groups.
The
resolution
passed
Congress
in the
weeks
that
followed.
In
July 2014,
Congressman
Ted
Deutch
unveiled
the
Democracy
for All
Amendment, a proposed amendment to the Constitution that would restore legitimacy to laws that limit the influence of money in politics. Ted's
constitutional
amendment
was crafted to unite members of the House and Senate behind a proposal to address the
explosion
of
outside
spending
unleashed
by the
Supreme
Court's
2010
Citizens
United
decision.
The
Democracy
for All
Amendment
would
also
overturn
the
Supreme
Court's
2014
ruling
in
McCutcheon ,
which
held
that
donors
have a
First
Amendment
right
to
exert
more
influence
over
public
officials
than
voters.
Since
its
introduction
in
July,
more
than
120
members
of
Congress
have
signed
on as
cosponsors
of the
Democracy
for All
Amendment.
Watch Rep. Deutch discuss the amendment here .
Championing
investments
in South
Florida's
infrastructure will
always be a
top
priority of
Congressman
Deutch.
In
August, Ted
had the
opportunity
to see how
some of
those
investments
are paying
off when he
visited the Fort
Lauderdale
Air Traffic
Control
tower,
which
was named
Air Traffic
Facility of
the Year by
the Federal
Aviation
Administration.
In the
photo
above, Ted
gets a look
at some of
the
state-of-the-art
communications,
weather,
and safety
technologies
that are
helping
keep the
Fort
Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport running
safely,
smoothly,
and
efficiently.
Earlier in
the summer,
Ted met
with local
officials
to discuss
additional
infrastructure
improvements
authorized
by the
Water
Resources
Reform and
Redevelopment
Act of
2014. The passage of this law authorized more funding for several South Florida projects related to Everglades
Restoration,
freshwater
supply,
flood
control,
and
environmental conservation.
While
at home
in
South
Florida,
Congressman
Ted
Deutch
has
pursued
unique
ways to
engage
students
of all
ages in
civic
life
and the
democratic
process.
In
September,
Ted
launched
his
2014-2015
Congressional
Youth
Cabinet,
made up
of high
school
students
from
throughout
Florida's
21st
district
with an interest
in
public service.
As one
of just
two
programs
of its
kind in
the
country,
the
Congressional
Youth
Cabinet
meets
regularly
to participate
in
legislative
simulations,
hear
from
guest
speakers,
and
explore
federal
policy
issues.
Ted
also
holds
"Congress
in the
Classroom,"
events
at
elementary,
middle
school,
and
high
schools
throughout
the
district
to walk students through the legislative process and provide a
firsthand
glimpse of what it is like to serve in Congress.
In October, Congressman Ted Deutch hosted Veterans Jobs Fairs in Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach to help local veterans polish their resumes and connect with employers throughout the area. During the event, Ted also updated our servicemen and women on the passage of the Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014. Congress passed these reforms in response to the widespread delays and abuse discovered within the VA health system. To meet the growing demand for care from veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and to better serve our aging veteran population, this law includes funding for the VA to recruit more doctors, nurses, therapists, and other medical professionals, open more service locations, and allow veterans dealing with long wait-times to seek community-based alternatives for care.
With
Medicare
fraud always a top concern
in
South
Florida,
this
November
Congressman
Ted
Deutch
introduced the
Stop
Schemes
and
Crimes
Against
Medicare
and
Seniors
Act
(Stop
SCAMS
Act) of
2014.
Cosponsored
by
Congressman
Peter
Roskam
of
Illinois,
this
bipartisan
legislation
aims to
stop
providers
with a
history
of
defrauding
Medicare
from
making
their
way
back
into
the
system.
Ted is
also
the
author
of the
bipartisan
Seniors
Fraud
Prevention
Act,
which
would
bolster
efforts
at the
Federal
Trade
Commission
to
protect
retirees
from
financial
fraud
that
targets
their
assets.
In
December,
President
Barack
Obama
signed
the
U.S.-Israel
Strategic
Partnership
Act
into
law.
This
bipartisan
legislation
introduced
by
Congressman
Ted
Deutch,
Ranking
Democrat
on the
Middle
East
and
North
Africa
Subcommittee,
and
Congresswoman
Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen,
Subcommittee
Chairman, establishes
Israel
as a
major
strategic
partner
of the
United
States
and
enhances
U.S.-Israel
cooperation
on a
multitude
of
fronts,
including
cybersecurity,
defense,
agriculture,
energy,
and
trade.
At a
time of
intense
volatility
in the
Middle
East,
Ted
will
continue
to
champion
a
strong
U.S.-Israel
relationship
in
Congress
grounded
in our
mutual
interests
and
shared
values.
