Dear Fellow Nevadan,
October is Filipino American
History Month, a time to celebrate Filipino culture, history, and the many
contributions of this community. The Filipino community is one of the
fastest growing populations in Nevada.
I am proud to
represent you in the Senate and to work on issues of importance to the
Filipino community. In the Senate, we are working on many important issues
including
comprehensive immigration reform ,
justice for Filipino veterans of World War II ,
equal pay for equal work ,
raising
the minimum wage , and
student loan
reform .
In 2009, Senator Daniel Inouye and I worked together to
ensure Filipino veterans who served during World War II were given the
recognition and reparation promised to them. As a result, Filipino
veterans that are U.S citizens were eligible for $15,000 and to date, more
than 18,000 claims have been approved. I am aware that some Filipino
veterans are being denied these claims and I have communicated with the
President asking him to ensure the remaining veterans receive the
compensation they deserve.
Last year, I urged the Department of
Homeland Security to grant temporary protected status to eligible
Filipino Nationals in the United States after the devastating effects of
Typhoon Haiyan. I also cosponsored the Philippines Charitable Giving
Assistance Act for the relief of victims affected by Typhoon Haiyan. In
March, the President signed this legislation into law.
I
hope you can join me in celebrating Filipino American History Month by
honoring this community for their contributions to our great state and
nation.
