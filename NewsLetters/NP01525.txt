Visiting with 7th District Farmers and Producers
I traveled across the 7th District this week meeting with local farmers and small businesses to discuss agriculture policy. In Jackson County, stops included Zenz Farms, Indian Brook Trout Farm, Gee Farms, and the Jackson County Farm Bureau. In Monroe County, I toured Secord Farms, Heck Farms, Matthes Greenhouse, Lennard Ag, Ottawa Lake Co-Op and met with members of the Monroe County Farm Bureau and Michigan Corn Growers Association.
