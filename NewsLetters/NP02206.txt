Wicker Applauds Bipartisan Effort in Congress to Stop Human
Trafficking
Needs of Victims Are Prioritized in Two Bills
Headed to Senate Floor
The fight against human trafficking is a
bipartisan battle.
The buying and selling of humans is not a
crime isolated to distant places but is happening in every U.S. state.
Although the exact number of exploited men, women, and children
nationwide is difficult to pinpoint, approximately 21 million people
are trafficked around the world.
Women and children are
particularly at risk.
Since the
"Trafficking Victims Protection Act" was first passed in 2000, Republicans
and Democrats have worked together to put policies in place that
punish offenders and protect victims.
This work continues with two
anti-trafficking bills that are set to come before the Senate in the
coming days.
I am a cosponsor
of both of these bills, which would target the needs of trafficking
victims in constructive ways.
The "Stop Exploitation Through
Trafficking Act," introduced by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), would
encourage states to adopt "safe harbor" laws ensuring minors who have been
exploited for sex are treated as victims and not criminals.
Likewise, the "Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act," introduced by Sen.
John Cornyn (R-Texas), would use fines levied against convicted
traffickers to start a fund for victim support programs. Each bill recognizes
the complex issues that surround trafficking and the rehabilitation
that its victims deserve.
Wicker Amendments Would Strengthen
Victim Outreach
I am encouraged that an open-amendment process is
expected to accompany this legislation when it comes to the Senate
floor.
This is a welcome change from recent years under Democratic
control, when Senators were prevented from submitting amendments
because of tactics used by then-Majority Leader Harry Reid
(D-Nev.).
I intend to introduce amendments
to enhance Sens. Cornyn and Klobuchar's bills. These ideas were part
of the "End Trafficking Act" that I authored last year.
One of my
proposals would encourage specialized court dockets and judicial
supervision for trafficking victims through a pilot program modeled after
the federal drug court system.
Another would create a Department
of Justice database for education and outreach to assist families,
advocates, crisis hotline personnel, law enforcement, and survivors.
A third would extend the statute of limitations for child victims
to sue up to 10 years after they reach the age of 18.
Mississippi Launches Anti-Trafficking Task
Force
It will take a comprehensive approach
to curb the drivers of trafficking and give survivors an opportunity
to restart their lives.
State and local governments play an
integral role in this fight by implementing strategies that crack down on
perpetrators and help facilitate access to counseling for victims.
Mississippi is working to find solutions with a new human
trafficking task force created by Gov. Phil Bryant.
The group, launched in
December 2014, brings together the expertise of representatives from
government, law enforcement, the legal system, the education system,
and social services.
They are expected to conduct research,
review Mississippi's laws, and submit recommendations by July of this
year.
Freedom is at the bedrock
of our national identity, yet there are innocent Americans who have
had this basic right taken away from them.
The fight continues to
restore their lives, punish those responsible, and keep our
communities safe.
