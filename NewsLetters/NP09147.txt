Hello
Friends!
May was quite a busy
month in Washington and back home. From recognizing both
Asian Pacific American Heritage Month
and
Jewish American Heritage Month
to
advocating for jobs , I was
fighting for you!
This month, we took the time to honor those who gave
the ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms and way of life. I was proud
to
celebrate Memorial Day
in
Milwaukee. Let us always honor those who
served.
We also said goodbye to one
of our greatest literary voices, Dr. Maya Angelou. Maya Angelou was
one of my idols, and I am deeply saddened by her passing. I wrote a poem
as my personal tribute to this incredible
woman.
Check out some of my favorite tweets and Facebook posts
from May!

It was
great to meet with the Boilermakers Union in late
April.
It was
wonderful celebrating the 25th anniversary of Home Instruction for
Parents of Preschool Youngsters (HIPPY) late last month. Thanks for the
photo!
