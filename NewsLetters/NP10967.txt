NOT A SUBSCRIBER?
Dear
Constituents,
In an op-ed printed in the March 26th edition of the
The Hill
newspaper, titled "Dont Overlook Potential of
Unlicensed Spectrum," I wrote about how the 49ers are maximizing the
potential of unlicensed spectrum and how the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) has an opportunity to fuel a next generation of innovation
using unlicensed spectrum.
Unlicensed spectrum are the
airwaves that innovators and entrepreneurs use freely (without a license
from the FCC) to develop new gadgetry and technology. Notable
technology using unlicensed spectrum include Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. The FCC has
historically allotted portions of wireless spectrum for unlicensed use
while auctioning the rest for private licensed use (i.e. wireless
spectrum used by the likes of AT&amp;T and Verizon to provide cellular
service).
An upcoming incentive auction of wireless spectrum
has the FCC under pressure to decide just how much should be allotted
for unlicensed use. Given developments like the mega Wi-Fi network at
the new 49ers stadium and the potential for far more, such as smart
grid networking and connected hospitals, I argue the FCC should allot
more spectrum for unlicensed use.
You can read my full
op-ed from
The Hill
here , and if you have
any questions or comments, let me hear from you.
Sincerely,
Anna G. Eshoo
Member of
Congress
