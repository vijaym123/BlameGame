Dear Friends,
President Obama , Attorney General Eric Holder and the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS) have now crossed a line that a Constitutional
Republic must not tolerate. This Administration is now allowing for the
inhumane smuggling of illegal aliens from Texas to Arizona.
The Administration is taking illegal aliens apprehended in Texas and
using taxpayer money to ship them by plane or bus to Arizona. Then, in
Arizona, the criminals are released at bus stations in 100 degree heat,
mostly without money, and in some cases, with no food, no water, and
nowhere to go.
Flooding our streets with illegal aliens who are being abandoned
without resources is not just inhumane and cruel, it is potentially a
crime. Federal law bans alien smuggling. Putting an illegal alien in a
car, bus or plane and transporting them to another location is deemed
"alien smuggling". See 8 USC
1324 (a)(1)(A).
If any other American were to duplicate these actions, they would be
prosecuted.
In my view no one is above the law.
If anyone in this Administration, from the President to Attorney
General Holder to any low-level bureaucrat, is orchestrating the
commission of felonies he or she should be indicted. I further believe
Mr. Holder's extremely incompetent legal advice and failure to uphold
the rule of law warrants impeachment. Please watch this short video of
me discussing these issues on Fox News HERE.
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (ICE) claim they do not have enough manpower to process all
the illegal aliens trying to enter the country at one region in South
Texas. Roughly 1,000 illegal immigrants are crossing the border at that
particular location each day, according to a CPB spokesman.
After an initial screening, they are being transferred and released
into the streets on the condition they "report" to a local ICE office
near their "final destination" within 15 days. Most will never report.
Selective enforcement of our nation's laws is inexcusable. Illegal
aliens are well aware of this flawed policy and the calls for movement
on comprehensive immigration reform. They are making a mad dash to the
border and there has been a surge in people trying to enter the country
illegally. Granting amnesty to people that knowingly break our laws and
come here illegally is unacceptable and I will not stand for it.
Continued Lack of Coordination Between State and Federal Agencies
To make matters worse, there are no mechanisms in place by which the
federal government shares its National Crime Information Center (NCIC)
databases of information relating to criminals with state authorities
while forbidding those very same states from enforcing current
immigration laws. And while federal authorities were able to
collaborate together and ship and release these illegal immigrants
across the country, they never even notified the Arizona Governor's
office, the Arizona Department of Public Safety or the Arizona
Department of Homeland Security informing them of this action which we
now know has been occurring for weeks.
So far this fiscal year, the Rio Grande Valley border sector has
apprehended more than 140,000 illegal immigrants. Additionally, today
on Capitol Hill in a staff briefing, officials from DHS were questioned
about their statutory authority to execute these procedures, and they
declined to cite the authority that exists.
I am absolutely appalled at the President, Mr. Holder's Justice
Department, and Homeland Security for acting in such a surreptitious
and foolish way. Rest assured that I am going to continue to press the
Administration for answers.
As always, you can follow everything I am working on in Arizona and
Washington, D.C. through my website (http://gosar.house.gov
) on Twitter @repgosar
, or through Facebook
at Representative Paul Gosar.
Sincerely,

Dear
Friends,
President
Obama
,
Attorney
General
Eric
Holder
and
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
(DHS)
have
now
crossed
a
line
that
a
Constitutional
Republic
must
not
tolerate.
This
Administration
is
now
allowing
for
the
inhumane
smuggling
of
illegal
aliens
from
Texas
to
Arizona.
The
Administration
is
taking
illegal
aliens
apprehended
in
Texas
and
using
taxpayer
money
to
ship
them
by
plane
or
bus
to
Arizona.
Then,
in
Arizona,
the
criminals
are
released
at
bus
stations
in
100
degree
heat,
mostly
without
money,
and
in
some
cases,
with
no
food,
no
water,
and
nowhere
to
go.
Flooding
our
streets
with
illegal
aliens
who
are
being
abandoned
without
resources
is
not
just
inhumane
and
cruel,
it
is
potentially
a
crime.
Federal
law
bans
alien
smuggling.
Putting
an
illegal
alien
in
a
car,
bus
or
plane
and
transporting
them
to
another
location
is
deemed
"alien
smuggling".
See
8
USC
&#167;
1324
(a)(1)(A).
If
any
other
American
were
to
duplicate
these
actions,
they
would
be
prosecuted.
In
my
view
no
one
is
above
the
law.
If
anyone
in
this
Administration,
from
the
President
to
Attorney
General
Holder
to
any
low-level
bureaucrat,
is
orchestrating
the
commission
of
felonies
he
or
she
should
be
indicted.
I
further
believe
Mr.
Holder&#8217;s
extremely
incompetent
legal
advice
and
failure
to
uphold
the
rule
of
law
warrants
impeachment.
Please
watch
this
short
video
of
me
discussing
these
issues
on
Fox
News
HERE.
Customs
and
Border
Protection
(CBP)
and
Immigration
and
Customs
Enforcement
(ICE)
claim
they
do
not
have
enough
manpower
to
process
all
the
illegal
aliens
trying
to
enter
the
country
at
one
region
in
South
Texas.
Roughly
1,000
illegal
immigrants
are
crossing
the
border
at
that
particular
location
each
day,
according
to
a
CPB
spokesman.
After
an
initial
screening,
they
are
being
transferred
and
released
into
the
streets
on
the
condition
they
"report"
to
a
local
ICE
office
near
their
"final
destination"
within
15
days.
Most
will
never
report.
Selective
enforcement
of
our
nation's
laws
is
inexcusable.
Illegal
aliens
are
well
aware
of
this
flawed
policy
and
the
calls
for
movement
on
comprehensive
immigration
reform.
They
are
making
a
mad
dash
to
the
border
and
there
has
been
a
surge
in
people
trying
to
enter
the
country
illegally.
Granting
amnesty
to
people
that
knowingly
break
our
laws
and
come
here
illegally
is
unacceptable
and
I
will
not
stand
for
it.
Continued
Lack
of
Coordination
Between
State
and
Federal
Agencies
To
make
matters
worse,
there
are
no
mechanisms
in
place
by
which
the
federal
government shares
its
National
Crime
Information
Center
(NCIC)
databases
of
information
relating
to
criminals
with
state
authorities
while
forbidding
those
very
same
states
from
enforcing
current
immigration
laws.
And
while
federal
authorities
were
able
to
collaborate
together
and
ship
and
release
these
illegal
immigrants
across
the
country,
they
never
even
notified
the
Arizona
Governor's
office,
the
Arizona
Department
of
Public
Safety
or
the
Arizona
Department
of
Homeland
Security
informing
them
of
this
action
which
we
now
know
has
been
occurring
for
weeks.
So
far
this
fiscal
year,
the
Rio
Grande
Valley
border
sector
has
apprehended
more
than
140,000
illegal
immigrants.
Additionally,
today
on
Capitol

officials
from
DHS
were
questioned
about
their
statutory

Mr.

Rest
