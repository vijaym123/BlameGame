Create Jobs: Build
the Keystone Pipeline Now
"It has been said that
people are entitled to their own opinions, but not to their own
facts.
This is especially true for the President of the United
States.
"I was amazed to hear President Obama dispute the facts
about the number of jobs that would be produced by construction of the
Keystone pipeline.
His own State Department has determined that
construction of this vital energy pipeline would create more than
42,000 jobs.
That same report also found that there was little
evidence that the pipeline would contribute to climate
change.
"Yet in a nationally televised interview, the President openly
denied the facts in that report, claiming the pipeline would create far
fewer jobs than his own State Department has
estimated.
"Its time that the administration put an end to its delaying tactics and
let the construction of the Keystone pipeline move forward.
I
urge all of my constituents who support jobs creation and energy
independence to call the White House at 202-456-1111 and urge the President
to green light the Keystone pipeline."

New Hope for Brain-injured Troops
Since
the year 2000, more than 280,000 American troops have suffered brain
injuries, many as a result of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The
Washington Post
recently reported
that research into better treatment for those suffering these
debilitating injuries is producing promising results.
The research,
carried out by DARPA
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
not only carries hope for wounded troops, it might also one day
benefit others suffering memory loss from such afflictions as dementia and
Alzheimer disease as well as athletes who have suffered a brain
injury.
As chair of the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee,
I am a strong supporter of the work DARPA does.
Its research
has made America stronger and safer.
The full article can be
found

eFile Your
Taxes for Free
The Internal Revenue Service has
recently announced a program that allows most taxpayers to
electronically file their tax returns for free.
Tax returns that
are filed electronically are processed faster than those submitted by
mail.
Thats especially useful for people expecting a
refund.
Filing electronically means you will receive your refund quicker
than you would if you file a paper return.

February is Heart Health
Month
Last week on Valentines Day, the emphasis was on
romantic matters of the heart.
Yet the entire month of February is
also dedicated to the heart
the physical health of the
heart.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States,
taking the lives of nearly 600,000 people annually.
Yet heart
disease can be prevented, and it can also be treated if
diagnosed.
During Heart Health Month, I encourage everyone to learn more about
the risks to heart health.
Visit the CDCs website to learn
some valuable information about how you can protect your heart
and
those of your loved ones:

Happy Birthday George
Washington!
Before Congress designated the third Monday in
February to honor all American presidents, February 22 nd
was set
aside to celebrate the birthday of our first president, George
Washington.
During the American Revolution General Washington
spent a great deal of time in New Jersey.
Did you know that more
battles of that war were fought in our state than in any
other?
While in New Jersey, Washington spent a great deal of his time in
todays 11 th
Congressional District.
He and his troops
spent the hardest winter on record in and around Morristown, with
Washington establishing his headquarters at the Ford Mansion, a private
home.
Washington also established headquarters on two occasions at
the Dey Mansion in Wayne.
I was proud to be the sponsor of
legislation that was included in the National Heritage Area Act of
2005, which established the Crossroads of the American Revolution
National Heritage Area.
New Jerseys critical role in winning the
Revolution is worth remembering!
A wonderful way to celebrate
Washingtons Birthday and to learn more about this important part of
American history
that took place in the 11 th
Congressional
District
is by visiting Washington-connected sites.

Also be sure to visit the
website
of
the Washington Association of New Jersey, which does a great job
preserving our heritage at Morristown National
Park.
