President Obamas trade deal is being
negotiated in secret by huge, multi-national corporations without
Congressional input, putting American manufacturing jobs and our public health
laws in jeopardy. Im fighting this bad deal but need to know where
you stand.
Considering the scope and importance of this deal, do you think Congress should
weigh in?
YES,
Congress should play a part to project American jobs. NO, the President should take unilateral
action. OTHER. *By
