Friends,
This week I had the
honor of awarding long overdue and well deserved military medals to one
of my constituents. U.S. Army veteran Donald G. Lingafelter fought
bravely to defend our country in World War II and earned the Army of
Occupation World War II Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal and the
World War II Victory Medal.
However, he had
never actually received them. So, after he reached out to our office, we
worked with him over the past few months to retrieve the medals
recognizing his service and bravery. As the son of a World War II veteran
myself, I was truly humbled and honored to be able to present Sgt.
Lingafelter these medals on Monday. You can read more about him and see
video from the ceremony
here.
Though it may not be the first thing you think about when you hear my
name or think of my office, constituent services is one of the most
important parts of my job. My staff and I work for you - and we strive
to serve you as best we can everyday.
If you
are having a problem, issue, or question about a federal government
agency, whether with the Social Security Administration, the IRS, or
the EPA for example, please do not hesisate to reach out to my office.
Our offices in Painesville (440-352-3939), Twinsburg (330-425-9291) and
DC (202-225-5731) are here to do whatever we can to help you. Sgt.
Lingafelter's story is just one of the many positive outcomes that we
are able to help our constituents achieve every
day.
As always, it is an honor to represent
you.
-Dave
