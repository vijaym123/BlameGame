Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
Thank you for the opportunity to update you on my work. I had a
wonderful week visiting with many of you across the Sixth Congressional
District.
Being as accessible and transparent as possible is very important to me
and has always been one of my top priorities.
Again, thank you for this opportunity to share exciting updates and
important information. It is an honor to represent you in Congress.
May is Arthritis Awareness Month
May has been recognized as Arthritis Awareness Month, giving us a
chance to bring attention to a disease that affects over 1 million
Kentuckians, including an estimated 3,900 children in Kentucky.
One of the "Faces of Arthritis" is Cameron Young. Cameron lives in
Versailles and was diagnosed with arthritis at the young age of 8 years
old. After he participates in the Lexington Walk to Cure Arthritis on
May 31, he looks forward to turning 13 this June.
And on Friday evening, I attended an Arthritis Foundation event and was
honored to meet McEwen Baker, a teenager from Versailles who also faces
daily challenges of living with arthritis.
Like Cameron and McEwen, my older sister, Emily, was stricken with
systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis as a young child. As I grew up,
I came to know the pain she faced, as well as the challenges my parents
fought so hard to overcome in order to give her the childhood she
deserved.
As a member of the Congressional Arthritis Caucus, I will continue to
advocate for people like Cameron, McEwen, my sister, and the millions
of Americans who are impacted by this crippling disease. It's time to
find a cure and stop the leading cause of disability in the United
States forever.
Around the District
On Monday, I enjoyed spending a Kentucky spring day on a gorgeous horse
farm. Thanks to Adena Springs Farm and Eric Hamelback for a great
discussion regarding my work as Chairman of the Congressional Horse
Caucus and for introducing me to two of their many accomplished
stallions, Ghostzapper & Point of Entry.
Thanks to brothers Ken & Art VanWingerden for a tour of their
family-owned agribusiness, Color Point, in Bourbon County. It was a
pleasure to tour their greenhouse that supplies plants and flowers to
over 90 Lowe's stores and learn more about this great employer for our
region!
I had the opportunity to meet with Chop Shop owner Johnathan Witt and
tour the meat processing facility in Wolfe County. This
state-of-the-art operation is the largest U.S. Department of
Agriculture inspected processing facility in eastern Kentucky. Most
importantly, Mr. Witt's commitment and vision has created 30 jobs in
eastern Wolfe County.
On Tuesday, I was honored to meet with Chief Johnson, Assistant Chief
Harris and Major Darrell Rogers with the Menifee County Volunteer Fire
Department.
I am glad to have helped introduce and pass H.R. 3685, the Protecting
Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act, which will simply
ensure once and for all that these departments will not fall victim to
the costly employer mandate in Obamacare.
I was also glad to inform them that I am a cosponsor of H.R. 1141, the
Federal Firefighter Flexibility and Fairness Act, which is legislation
that would amend federal employee labor law to allow firefighters to be
eligible to trade shift time.
Thank you to the Menifee County Volunteer Firefighters and all of
Kentucky's fire departments who work tirelessly to provide essential
safety services for our communities.
My meeting with Ramona Lawson, Christy Wayman, Frances Back, Sheriff
Coffee and Mayor Bryant at the Menifee County 911 Dispatch Center
reinforces the importance of the work that is done by our emergency
response personnel. The Menifee County 911 Dispatch Center has proven
to be of exceptional value to the community as seen in their handling
of the 2011 tornado. Thank you for your service and hospitality.
Thank you to Clark Energy President and CEO Paul Embs and the Board of
Directors for the great job they do and service they provide to 25,000
customers across Bath, Bourbon, Clark, Estill, Fayette, Madison,
Menifee, Montgomery, Morgan, Powell, and Rowan Counties.
On Wednesday, I spoke at a luncheon for individuals in the housing
industry. This was a great opportunity to share recent action in the
Financial Services Committee to help the housing market recover, and to
also discuss my legislation that passed the House on May 6, the HELP
Rural Communities Act, which helps correct an improper Washington
regulation that harmed the ability of individuals in rural communities
to purchase a home.
Before leaving Menifee County, I stopped by one of the hidden treasures
of the Sixth Congressional District, Broke Leg Falls. This beautiful
series of waterfalls was devastated by the 2011 tornado. Thanks to the
hard work of Menifee County and the numerous volunteers who have helped
in the cleanup efforts Broke Leg Falls maintains its beauty and
serenity. A great place for a family picnic!
While in Wolfe County, I met with Schools Superintendent Kenny Bell. We
talked about the work I have been doing in Washington to reduce the
impact of sequestration and roll back unfunded federal mandates on our
rural school systems.
Before leaving Wolfe County, I had to opportunity to meet the Wolfe
County Girls Softball Team practice. Wolfe County Schools Athletic
Director Robert Creech and Coach Campbell should be proud to have one
of the best softball teams the county has seen in years. I was honored
to congratulate the team on their success and offer words of
encouragement as they strive for excellence both on and off the field.
I had a wonderful time visiting with the bright children at
Athens-Chilesburg Elementary School in Lexington and sharing with them
how much I enjoy representing them in Congress.
Thanks to the Kiwanis Club of the Bluegrass for inviting me to speak at
their luncheon on Thursday! I appreciated the opportunity to provide an
update on my work for the Sixth District as well as the chance to take
questions from attendees.
On Thursday, I attended a celebration in honor of Lighthouse Ministries
10 Year Anniversary. I was glad to present a copy of my remarks in the
Congressional Record celebrating Lighthouse Ministries' decade of
service to men, women and children in central and eastern Kentucky. I
would also like to extend my personal gratitude to this organization
for all that they do to better our community and our Commonwealth.
Please continue to let me know your thoughts and concerns about issues
facing our community, and I hope you will forward my weekly newsletter
to your friends, family and neighbors.
You may also visit my website, Facebook and Twitter, where you can find
regular updates about my work at home in the Sixth District and in
Washington.
Thank you and have a great week!

Report
Dear
Friend,
Thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
update
you
on
my
work.
I
had
a
wonderful
week
visiting
with
many
of
you
across
the
Sixth
Congressional
District.
Being
as
accessible
and
transparent
as
possible
is
very
important
to
me
and
has
always
been
one
of
my
top
priorities.
Again,
thank
you
for
this
opportunity
to
share
exciting
updates
and
important
information.
It
is
an
honor
to
represent
you
in
Congress.
May
is
Arthritis
Awareness
Month
May
has
been
recognized
as
Arthritis
Awareness
Month,
giving
us
a
chance
to
bring
attention
to
a
disease
that
affects
over
1
million
Kentuckians,
including
an
estimated
3,900
children
in
Kentucky.
One
of
the
&#8220;Faces
of
Arthritis&#8221;
is
Cameron
Young.
Cameron
lives
in
Versailles
and
was
diagnosed
with
arthritis
at
the
young
age
of
8
years
old.
After
he
participates
in
the
Lexington
Walk
to
Cure
Arthritis
on
May
31,
he
looks
forward
to
turning
13
this
June.
And
on
Friday
evening,
I
attended
an
Arthritis
Foundation
event
and
was
honored
to
meet
McEwen
Baker,
a
teenager
from
Versailles
who
also
faces
daily
challenges
of
living
with
arthritis.
Like
Cameron
and
McEwen,
my
older
sister,
Emily,
was
stricken
with
systemic
juven ile
rheumatoid
arthritis
as
a
young
child.
As
I
grew
up,
I
came
to
know
the
pain
she
faced,
as
well
as
the
challenges
my
parents
fought
so
hard
to
overcome
in
order
to
give
her
the
childhood
she
deserved.
As
a
member
of
the
Congressional
Arthritis
Caucus,
I
will
continue
to
advocate
for
people
like
Cameron,
McEwen,
my
sister,
and
the
millions
of
Americans
who
are
impacted
by
this
crippling
disease.
It's
time
to
find
a
cure
and
stop
the
leading
cause
of
disability
in
the
United
States
forever.

day
on

Thanks
to
brothers
Ken
&amp;
Art
VanWingerden
for
a
tour
of
their

It

flowers
to
over

I
had
the
opportunity
to
meet
with
Chop
Shop
owner
Johnathan
Witt
and
tour
the
meat
processing
facility
in
Wolfe
County.
This
state-of-the-art
operation
is
the
largest
U.S.
Department
of
Agriculture
inspected
processing
facility
in
eastern
Kentucky.
Most
importantly,
Mr.
Witt&#8217;s
commitment
and
vision
has
created
30
jobs
in
eastern
Wolfe
County.
On
Tuesday,
I
was
honored
to
meet
with
Chief
Johnson,
Assistant
Chief
Harris
and
Major
Darrell
Rogers
with
the
Menifee
County
Volunteer
Fire
Department.
I
am
glad
to
have
helped
introduce
and
pass
H.R.
3685,
the
Protecting
Volunteer
Firefighters
and
Emergency
Responders
Act,
which
will
simply
ensure
once
and
for
all
that
these
departments
will
not
fall
victim
to
the
costly
employer
mandate
in
Obamacare.
I
was
also
glad
to
inform
them
that
I
am
a
cosponsor
of
H.R.
1141,
the

which
is
legislation
that
would

law

Thank
you
to
the
Menifee

and
all
of
Kentucky's
fire
departments
who
work
tirelessly
to
provide
essential
safety
services
for
our

has
proven
to
be
of
exceptional
value

of
the
2011
tornado.

you
for
your
service
and
hospitality.
Thank
you
to

customers
across
Bath,
Bourbon,
Clark,
Estill,
Fayette,
Madison,
Menifee,
Montgomery,
Morgan,
Powell,
and
Rowan
Counties.
On
Wednesday,
I
spoke
at
a
luncheon
for
individuals
in
the
housing
industry.
This
was
a
great
opportunity
to
share
recent
action
in
the
Financial
Services
Committee
to
help
the
housing
market
recover,
and
to
also
discuss
my
legislation
that
passed
the
House
on
May
6,
the
HELP
Rural
Communities
Act,
which
helps
correct
an
improper
Washington
regulation
that
harmed
the
ability
of
individuals
in
rural
communities
to
purchase
a
home.
Before
leaving
Menifee
County,
I
stopped
by
one
of
the
hidden
treasures
of
the
Sixth
Congressional
District,
Broke
Leg
Falls.
This
beautiful
series
of
waterfalls
was
devastated
by
the
2011
tornado.
Thanks
to
the
hard
work
of
Menifee
County
and
the
numerous
volunteers
who
have
helped
in
the
cleanup
efforts
Broke
Leg
Falls
maintains
its
beauty
and
serenity.
A
great
place
for
a
family
picnic!
While
in
Wolfe
County,
I
met
with
Schools
Superintendent
Kenny
Bell.
We
talked
about
the
work
I
have
been
doing
in
Washington
to
reduce
the
impact
of
sequestration
and
roll
back
unfunded
federal
mandates
on
our
rural
school
systems.
Before
leaving
Wolfe
County,
I
had
to
opportunity
to
meet
the
Wolfe
County
Girls
Softball
Team
practice.
Wolfe
County
Schools
Athletic
Director
Robert
Creech
and
Coach
Campbell
should
be
proud
to
have
one
of
the
best
softball
teams
the
county
has
seen
in
years.
I
was
honored
to
congratulate
the
team
on
their
success
and
offer
words
of
encouragement
as
they
strive
for
excellence
both
on
and
off
the
field.
I
had
a
wonderful
time
visiting
with
the
bright
children
at
Athens-Chilesburg
Elementary
School
in
Lexington
and
sharing
with
them
how
much
I
enjoy

them
in
Congress.

of
the

to
take

On
Thursday,
I
attended
a
celebration
in
honor
of
Lighthouse
Ministries
10
Year
Anniversary.
I
was
glad
to
present
a

celebrating
Lighthouse
