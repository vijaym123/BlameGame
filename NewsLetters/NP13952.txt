Friends,
In a rare instance of bipartisanship, Democrats and
Republicans from both chambers came together this week to discuss their
differences at the first WRRDA Conference Committee meeting.
The mood
of the meeting was optimistic and positivea welcome change after the
fall government shutdown.
I am proud
that, in this very tough legislative atmosphere, we passed a bill that
will directly support approximately 500,000 jobs and sustain the
millions of jobs that depend on our national water transportation system.
I am very proud of that and so is Sen. [David] Vitter [R-LA],
said Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairwoman Barbara
Boxer (D-CA).
At the Conference Committee
meeting, I explained the importance of South Carolina's Ports and how
vital water infrastructure is to American competitiveness.
From
the Peanut Farmer in Effingham to the automotive manufacturing giant in
Greer, our states transportation system greatly impacts our ability
to compete nationally and internationally.
I will continue to
update you on the ground we cover and the Committee's progress on getting
a Water Resources Bill to the Presidents desk.

Exposing the Impact of HOS
Regulations
Last week, the Small Businesses Subcommittee on
Contracting and Workforce held a hearing to expose the costly effects the
Hours of Service regulation is having on our nations truckers.
I
had the opportunity to question one of the Agency Administrators that
enforces this un-tested regulation.

Increasing Onshore Energy Production
Last
month, our country produced more oil than it imported for the first time
in nearly two decades. This milestone was only obtainable due to
onshore oil production on state-owned and privately-owned landnot
federally-owned land.
The House of Representatives passed three bills
last week that would increase oil and gas development on federally-owned
land by setting new permitting standards, cut red tape, and expanding
onshore energy production in the U. S.
Each of these
common-sense bills would make our country more competitive and more energy
independent.
