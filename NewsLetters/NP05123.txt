This is SHOCKING: Ruby-red GEORGIA is now the most competitive race in the country -- and Nate Silver believes it will determine who will win the Senate!
BREAKING: Nate Silver: Georgia is the new &ldquo;tipping-point state that would determine majority control.&rdquo;
Friend -- This is SHOCKING: Ruby-red GEORGIA is now the most competitive race in the country -- and Nate Silver believes it will determine who will win the Senate!
After Republican David Perdue got busted for outsourcing jobs and using offshore bank accounts, Democrat Michelle Nunn is leading 47-45 -- a 5 point polling surge!
But don&rsquo;t celebrate yet: The GOP is spending a whopping $1.2 million JUST THIS WEEK to wipe out Michelle&rsquo;s lead with vicious attacks. We NEED 5,968 more Democrats to step up today so we can answer every attack and WIN FORMERLY-RED GEORGIA and the Senate!

President Obama said,
&ldquo;If Michelle Nunn wins, that means that Democrats keep control of the Senate.&rdquo;
This is THE key race, and winning it would BLOW AWAY Republicans&rsquo; domination of the South!
So it COULD NOT be more important to answer every attack, turn out every voter, and make sure Michelle Nunn wins and we keep the Senate blue!
Please give today to our Emergency Media Campaign so we can hand the GOP a searing loss and WIN Georgia, the South, and the Senate! We&rsquo;ll match your gift until midnight!
