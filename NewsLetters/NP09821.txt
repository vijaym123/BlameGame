Dear
Friends
This week is Public
Service Recognition Week, a
time to honor and thank our
local, state, and federal
public servants who work hard
every day to keep our
communities, states and
nation running. In keeping
with the spirit of Public
Service Recognition Week, I
would like to take this time
to recognize one of
Delawares own
dedicated public
servants.
The First State National
Monument shares the story of
Delaware's early colonial
settlement and how our state
was integral to the birth of
this great nation. We
can thank Delawarean and
First State National Monument
Superintendant Russ Smith for
his hard work every day to
make our monument a place
people in and out of Delaware
want to visit. Russ is no
stranger to public service;
he is a 40-year veteran of
the U.S. Department of the
Interiors National
Park Service.
Hes also no stranger
to Delaware. Growing up
in northern Delaware, Russ
graduated from William Penn
High School, only two miles
away from the national
monuments headquarters
in Old New Castle. My wife
Martha and I had the
privilege of meeting Russ for
the first time over a year
ago during the declaration of
the First State National
Monument. His dedication to
Delaware and our park was as
evident then as it is
now.
I would like to thank
Russ, and all of
Delawares local,
state, and federal public
servants for the work they do
each and every day. It
is because of dedicated
Americans like them that our
nation is as great as it
is. I encourage all of
you to take some time this
week to show your gratitude
to a public servant and to
learn more about the
important work that he or she
does each day.
As always, I welcome
hearing your views on this
issue, or any other, through
