Dear Friend,
For over two centuries, American men and women have laid down their
lives in the defense of our country, serving our nation with honor and
distinction. We have a responsibility today to honor their legacy by
living up to the principles they fought for. This Memorial Day, I'm
proud to recognize those Americans who gave their lives for our country.
>From the Revolutionary War through our deployments in Iraq and
Afghanistan, Americans have placed themselves in harm's way to defend
our country and fight for our values. Their service, like that of
soldiers before them, is selfless and should never be forgotten.
This Memorial Day, our country will honor Americans who have fallen in
the line of duty through a National Moment of Remembrance. Scheduled
for 3:00 PM local time on Monday, May 26, I encourage you to join me in
reflecting on the sacrifices our veterans, service members and military
families have made.
I also plan to join our veterans later today for ceremonies in Barton,
MD, and at Rocky Gap. I look forward to spending time with the men and
women who have done so much to keep our country safe.
As the 113th Congress moves forward, I will continue my work to act as
a voice for our veterans and service members. As a Member of Congress,
I have worked to ensure that we keep our promise to veterans and meet
our obligation to the families of the fallen. I welcome your feedback
on how we can achieve this goal.
Sincerely,
John
