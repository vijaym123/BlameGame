HUGE NEWS! You just
WRECKED
Boehner and Rove&rsquo;s scheme:
This week, news broke that Boehner
AND
Rove are launching early August Obama-bashing attack ads.
Republican outside groups were already outspending us 3-to-1&hellip;
This week&rsquo;s ad blitz could&rsquo;ve completely knocked us out.
But then&hellip;
61,648 of you responded to President Obama's call to action. All together, you helped us raise $1,266,897 in just 3 days!
That's AMAZING! Especially considering the average gift was $20.
We're already putting your dollars to work fighting Republican attacks.
This week, we went on the air in our first 3 states: And we've put over 500 get-out-the-vote organizers on the ground all across the country -- with 133 more starting THIS MONTH!
Together, we can reach Michelle Obama's goal of registering, organizing, and mobilizing 1 million voters.
(watch Michelle&rsquo;s video) David -- We know we ask a lot. But we want you to know that your contributions are making a HUGE difference.
Thanks so much from all of us at DCCC HQ
