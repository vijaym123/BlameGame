Greetings,
It was quite the kick-off to the 114 th
Congress!
As part of the swearing in ceremony, we held an open house in the Washington D.C. office and had old and new Kansas friends stop by.
I always make sure WSU is well represented at the office!
We recognized Wichitas historic entrepreneurial spirit by providing Pizza Hut for lunch .
Visitors to our DC office during the open house.
Swearing in ceremony.
I am so privileged to continue to represent the great state of Kansas and serve for the next two years.
The new Congress is getting off to a quick start.
On day one, we passed an Obamacare fix;
well pass another this next week that gets rid of a rule that has forced many Kansans into part-time work when they wanted full-time jobs.
Next week we will vote on my legislation streamlining federal approval for natural gas pipeline applications.
I will continue to serve on the
Energy and Commerce Committee , which has wide jurisdiction over energy, healthcare, telecommunications, and interstate commerce.
As I work to lead the Republican conference to support serious limited government reforms, I am conscious of the real challenges facing our nation.
Government is too big, spends too much, and takes away too many freedoms.
That is the true challenge, and that is the fight I was elected to win.
I look forward to working hard for the people of Kansas over the next two years.
Sincerely,
Mike Pompeo
Member of Congress
