David -- This is TOO close: With less than 4 hours to go, we&rsquo;re
7,647
donations short of our
5OO,OOO
donation goal.
It's so critical we hit this goal (it's why we keep emailing you). We're being outspent 2-to-1 right now by
Republican outside groups... If we don&rsquo;t hit our 5OO,OOO online donation goal by midnight tonight, then consider all hope lost for a Democratic majority in November. David It may take a last second miracle to hit our goal tonight. If you&rsquo;re planning to chip in soon, we could really use your support before tonight&rsquo;s deadline.
MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: ALL GIFTS TRIPLE-MATCHED! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
