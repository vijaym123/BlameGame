Dear Friends,
Today you can read my Op-Ed in the Houston Chronicle on the prisoner
exchange the President unilaterally made
with the Taliban. The exchange of five dangerous
Taliban leaders from Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp for Sgt. Bowe
Bergdahl was a bad deal. We should all question the President's
judgment concerning this exchange because it put America on the same
footing as the Taliban. I also spoke about the dangerous precedent set
with Erin Burnett on CNN's "OutFront." You can watch my interview below.
I had the opportunity to question Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel at a
hearing the Armed Services Committee held on the release of the
detainees from Guantanamo Bay. You can watch the exchange below.
Following a news report this week by the Inspector General at the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) which found that more than 57,000
veteran patients have been waiting at least 90 days for their first VA
medical appointment, and an additional 64,000 veterans appear to have
been denied appointments after requesting them, the House acted quickly
to expand access to care for our veterans.
I voted in favor of the Veterans Access to Care Act
, which requires the VA to
enter into contracts with non-VA health care providers and allow VA
patients who have experienced extended waiting times for appointments
at VA facilities to get care at the medical setting of their choice and
with the doctor they trust.
The House also passed two bills to make permanently extend tax policies
that spur economic growth. America's Small Business Tax Relief Act
allows small business
to expense, or immediately deduct from income, a larger amount of costs
of business equipment including computer software.
The Permanent S Corporation Built-in Gains Recognition Period Act
permanently reduced
the recognition period for built-in gains of S corporations to five
years. It also permanently extends the charitable contributions tax
benefit to shareholders of S corporations that donate property.

Today
you

my

the
President
unilaterally
made
with
the
