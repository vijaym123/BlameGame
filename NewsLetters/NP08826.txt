Creating College Opportunity by Making Higher Education More Affordable
and Accessible
Utah has the nation's youngest population
and a dynamic, innovative, growing economy.
It has never been
more important for Utahns to be able to participate in an accessible and
affordable higher education system.
In an effort to address
this challenge, Governor Herbert and the state legislature have adopted
the aggressive goal that by the year 2020, 66% of Utah's adult
population will have earned a post-secondary degree or
certificate.
I support them in this challenge, and I intend to be a strong voice
in any debate in Washington to reform our higher education
system.
Over the past several weeks I have had the privilege of meeting
with large groups of students from many of Utah's universities.
The students I met were optimistic about their futures, and I am
hoping the best for them as they complete their degrees and move on to
make a difference in the world and start working to achieve the American
Dream.
Dining with Utah Students
This week, leaders in Washington
are turning their focus to alleviating the massive burden of student
loan debt that many Americans have accumulated.
As the week
unfolds, I look forward to
highlighting the Higher
Education Reform Act
that I have introduced to make higher education
more accessible and affordable.
By driving down the
costs and expanding the number of higher education institutions in the
system, the HERO Act would not only provide a sustainable solution to the
student-loan problem, but it would also expand college opportunity
for low-income and middle-class families. In an economy where upward
economic mobility increasingly depends on some form of secondary
education, the HERO Act is a moral and economic imperative.
It is also
just a small piece of a larger
conservative reform
agenda
that is designed to increase upward mobility, encourage
economic security, and fight against cronyist privilege.
I
would enjoy discussing the HERO Act and
my other
proposals
with you in more detail during my tele-townhall this
Wednesday night.
I hope you can make it:
