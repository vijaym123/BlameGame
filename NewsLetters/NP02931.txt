This week, I joined the Judiciary Committee to examine the Administrations enforcement of our nations immigration laws. Again and again, we have seen only arrogance and apathy on the part of the Administration in enforcing the laws passed by Congress.
I will continue to work to hold the Administration accountable, because I believe that
as we address immigration
the twin goals of
stopping executive amnesty and securing our border must be our top priority . Period.
Last year, I strongly supported a bill Congressman Trey Gowdy introduced, called the SAFE Act ( H.R. 2278 ), which would make securing our borders and enforcing our laws not just a priority, but a reality. As a senior member on the House Judiciary Committee, Im working with Chairman Goodlatte, Congressman Gowdy, and other Committee Members to build off the groundwork we laid last year.
The bottom-line is : until our border is secure, the work is not done.
I will keep you posted.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. Earlier this month, I cosponsored the Preventing Executive Overreach on Immigration Act ( H.R. 38 ), which prohibits the executive branch from exempting or deferring from removal
by executive order, regulation, or any other means
anyone who is here illegally.
This is important because it clarifies that the Presidents executive orders are unconstitutional, and only Congress has the authority to alter our immigration laws.
Read the text of the bill yourself,
