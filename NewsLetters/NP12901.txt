This is truly despicable. Last week, Bobby Schilling sent out an email calling those of us who support women&rsquo;s reproductive rights "disgusting" and accused choice advocates of supporting
genocide .
Not only is Schilling&rsquo;s email downright offensive, it&rsquo;s insulting, it&rsquo;s crude, and it&rsquo;s just one more reason we can&rsquo;t let him win in November.
Bobby Schilling is resorting to the same fear tactics that his beloved Tea Party thinks will scare up votes. We&rsquo;ve got to call him out. Chip in $3 or whatever you can right now to help Cheri fight back against ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling and his extremist views on women&rsquo;s rights &gt;&gt;
Cheri will stand up to Tea Party fear-mongers like Schilling as long as she&rsquo;s in office -- and she&rsquo;ll keep fighting for Illinois women every step of the way.
Will you chip in $3 right now to help keep Cheri in the fight? http://action.cheribustos.com/Stand-Up-For-Women
