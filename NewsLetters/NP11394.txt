Dear David,
A
constituent, Brandon P., recently called my office to explain how the
expansion of Medicaid in Ohio helped him following a serious
illness.
That's because Brandon enrolled! The deadline for individuals to
sign up for health insurance is March 31st.
More than 5 million
people nationwide and nearly 100,000 Ohioans have already signed up for
coverage on
Healthcare.Gov . Do
you know someone who needs to enroll?
Federal subsidies to
bring down the cost of healthcare premiums are available for many
people who apply.
The calculator below can illustrate how much an
affordable health plan will cost monthly.
Also included in this
newsletter is a tool to find local help when signing up for a health
plan and a toll-free phone number to get assistance enrolling by phone.
Explore the helpful tools included in this newsletter and share
Brandon's story to encourage everyone you know to get covered
too.
Do not hesitate to call any of my offices if you need additional
resources. Contact information is available at the end of the
newsletter.
Thank you,
Marcia L. Fudge
Member of
Congress
I am a recent college graduate who lives a
healthy lifestyle and does not drink or smoke.
But I understand
everyone needs a doctor, even before they are born, so I explored
Heathcare.Gov
the first day it was
available. It informed me that I qualified for Medicaid but
Benefits.Ohio.Gov
said I did not; I called
800-324-8689 and applied anyway.
A few months later, I began
to feel unbearable pain in my stomach.
I went to the emergency
room several times before I found out I had gallstones and needed
surgery to remove my gallbladder. My services totaled more than $40,000. I
could not afford to pay so my bills went into
collection.
Following surgery, I visited a
NEON Health Center
for low-cost care and they told me about
Human Arc , which expedited my
Medicaid application.
Earlier this month, I received a letter
saying I was covered by Medicaid due to the expansion and would receive
retroactive coverage for my surgery because I was proactive. Now my
only healthcare costs are the few emergency room visits I had before
signing up, which
Cuyahoga Health Access
Partnership
(CHAP) reduced from about $6,000 to
$500.
I am blessed the Affordable Care Act passed, Medicaid has
expanded in Ohio and helpful organizations like
NEON Health Centers ,
Human Arc
and
CHAP
exist.
It felt terrible to become unexpectedly ill and not have health
insurance. I feel a lot better now that I have Medicaid and I am grateful
other people can get covered too.
