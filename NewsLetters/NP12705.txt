I wanted to share with you
a recent article published by National Review , which details the increasingly apparent risks that Obamacare poses for small businesses. Below is a brief summary.
The Problem : Small business is thus likely to find itself in the same predicament as individuals, in which cancellation notices abound and immediate answers are unclear or unsatisfactory.
The Result:
Hundreds of thousands or even millions of small businesses and surely millions of their employees and dependents will have their health-insurance coverage seriously jeopardized.
In my view, this situation is unacceptable. I supported an alternative ( H.R. 3121 ) to Obamcare, and remain
committed to fighting
on behalf of our nations number one job creators: small businesses.
Yours in service,
Randy
