Dear
David,
Happy New Year and I hope you stayed warm during the
polar vortex!
Minnesota's cold weather did not slow me down and in
Monday's minus 22 degrees I began a full day by meeting with health
care providers, patients, and physicians about my legislation to use
technology and best practices to more efficiently provide patient-centered
care. You can read the Star Tribune article
here .
As always, please feel free to contact me if I can
assist you or your family in any way. Also, please join the conversation
online by visiting my
website ,
Facebook page ,
Twitter , and don't forget to
watch my weekly video,
Erik's Correspondence Corner .

Disappointing
Numbers on Jobs
The Joint Economic Committee, on which I
serve, reviewed and heard testimony on Friday about the disappointing jobs
report that was just released. Only 74,000 new jobs were created last
month (we need 130,000 just to keep up with population growth) . We
are still over a million jobs short of where we were in December of 2007
when the last recession started.
To build our economy I
will continue working on tax reform because a simpler, fairer, and more
competitive code will help employers and hardworking taxpayers. The
current tax code is too costly, too complex, and takes too much time to
comply with. Clearly, we have a long way to go to reach our economy's
full potential.
Ending Sex Trafficking in our
Communities
Did you know that approximately 300,000
children are at risk of being involved in sex trafficking in the United
States? Sadly, the average age of these young girls who are forced into
prostitution is only 13. Combating this problem is a top priority of mine
and I've authored multiple bipartisan legislative initiatives to
combat this problem (HR 2744
The Child Sex Trafficking Data and Response Act
and
HR 3610
The Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act ).
I
even participated in a sting operation to learn more and see firsthand
how our local police officers are tackling this issue.
The
good news is that the House Ways and Means Committee released draft
legislation to prevent and address sex trafficking of youth in foster
care which includes several provisions of the bills I am authoring. You
can read some of the local coverage regarding Minnesota's work to help
stop this crime from happening
here .
On Site For Local Business Tours
Earlier this week I
visited Lucid Brewing in Minnetonka. Lucid is a small brewery that
opened just a few years ago and is experiencing a lot of growth. They
also partner with and share resources with two other small brewers, Bad
Weather Brewing and Badger Hill Brewing. It's exciting to see these
young entrepreneurs growing their small businesses and adding and
creating jobs in our community.
During the visit, we discussed the
Small BREW Act (HR 494), which aims to reduce federal excise taxes on
start-up breweries like the ones I toured. The brewery owners see this
reduction in taxes as a way to further spur the growing Minnesota beer
industry and allow them to expand their facilities, workforce, and
distribution areas.
