Atchison Chamber of Commerce
On Saturday evening, I attended the Atchison Chamber of Commerce 96th
Annual Banquet where I had the honor of recognizing Karen Seaberg.
Karen - MGP Ingredients Chairman and executive travel agent with
Atchison Travel Center - was inducted in the Atchison Chamber of
Commerce Hall of Fame. She is involved in many civic activities and
plays a vital role in the Amelia Earhart Festival, which she has
chaired since its conception in 1997. Karen's induction is a
well-deserved honor. Her commitment and dedication to her community
have made a positive and lasting impact on the citizens of Atchison.
Thanks to Chamber President Jacque Pregont for the invitation to attend

Kansas Common Sense
January 26, 2015
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thank you for your continued interest
in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
State of the Union Address
The President previously indicated that the elections last November
were a referendum on his policies. Yet, rather than outlining a change
of direction in the State of the Union Address on Tuesday, he continued
to be more interested in higher taxes, overregulation and irresponsible
spending than in working with Congress to grow the economy, create jobs
and support the middle class. The goal of our economic policies should
not be increased reliance on government aid. Rather, the goal should be
fostering an environment that allows individuals to find jobs that can
support their families.
There is a real desire among Americans to see Congress and the
President work together on concrete solutions to the significant
challenges we face. Unfortunately, what we heard was not problem
solving, and I do not believe there is any real expectation by the
President that his proposals will actually foster cooperation between
Capitol Hill at the White House. Let's find common ground and try to
solve our country's problems. Click here
to view what I hoped to hear on Tuesday.
Participating in Senate Commerce Committee Hearing on Broadband
Regulation
On Wednesday, I participated in my first Senate Commerce Committee
hearing titled "Protecting the Internet and Consumers through
Congressional Action." The discussion focused on how Congress can
develop rules related to how companies manage their broadband networks.
Next month, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is expected to
approve network management rules that would regulate broadband like
other heavily-regulated utilities, despite Congress never granting them
the authority to do so. The new rules will likely face legal challenges
that could last years, as well as increase regulatory uncertainty for
broadband providers and consumers. I have real concerns that the FCC's
unilateral actions could impact millions of Americans and rural
providers who are working to expand broadband access to Kansans. My
questions at the hearing were related to making certain Kansans don't
lose access to broadband, as well as ensuring the next great Internet
entrepreneur is not stifled by an uncertain regulatory environment. I
look forward to working with my colleagues to approve a legislative
solution that protects consumers, promotes broadband expansion, and
encourages broadband adoption so that more Americans may realize the
many benefits of digital economy. To watch the hearing on this
important topic, please click here

Amendment to Delist the Lesser Prairie Chicken
I offered an amendment this week to remove the lesser prairie chicken
(LPC) from the threatened species list under the Endangered Species
Act. The amendment is considered pending to S.1, the Keystone XL
pipeline legislation, and votes on pending amendments are expected to
continue next week.
The LPC was listed at a time when much of Kansas was in a severe and
prolonged drought. In fact, during the 2013 annual aerial survey used
to assess the LPC population, every Kansas County that includes habitat
was experiencing a D3-Extreme or D4-Exceptional drought according to
the U.S. Drought Monitor. As the bird's habitat area has recently
received more rain and snow fall, its population has surged 20 percent.
This is one of the reasons that I believe the bird should not have been
listed in the first place. However, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
instead moved forward with the listing last spring, and now rural
Kansas is beginning to suffer the consequences.
Increased regulations due to the listing will continue to threaten the
livelihoods of farmers and ranchers, disrupt oil and gas exploration
and wind energy projects, and hurt the economies of many small towns
scattered across our state. The threatened listing of the LPC is one of
the most consistent items I hear about in Southwest Kansas. While the
fate of this particular amendment is uncertain, it has allowed me to
raise the profile of this important issue as a means to educate my
fellow Senators. As I told my colleagues, I'm convinced there are ways
to conserve the species without infringing on private property rights
and hindering economic opportunity in rural Kansas. I don't believe
listing the LPC as threatened is the solution, and I will continue to
fight to reverse the government's misguided decision. Click here

Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act Passes Senate
Veterans Affairs' Committee
This week, during the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee's first
official meeting for the 114th Congress, committee members passed
legislation intended to improve mental health care and increase suicide
prevention resources for American service members-the Clay Hunt Suicide
Prevention for American Veterans Act.
The invisible wounds of war plague thousands of veterans across our
country, and unfortunately some feel the only choice to deal with their
wounds is to take their own life. The average suicide rate among
veterans is a staggering 22 deaths each day. The Clay Hunt Suicide
Prevention for American Veterans Act would be instrumental in
developing a VA system capable of offering first-rate mental health
care services, as well as utilizing the expertise of outside
organizations to provide support for those struggling with the
invisible wounds of war. The Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American
Veterans Act passed the House of Representatives on Jan. 12, 2015, and
will now proceed to the full Senate for consideration.
The VA Must Use Common Sense to Help Veterans
On Wednesday, I introduced the Veterans Access to Community Care Act of
2015 (S. 207) to require the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to
utilize its current authority - granted through the Veterans Access,
Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 (VACAA) that passed Congress
last July - to offer health care to veterans who are unable to receive
the services they need from a VA medical facility within 40 miles of
where they live. Unfortunately, the VA continues to overlook rural
veterans as they implement VACAA by defining a VA medical facility as
any facility - a medical center or a Community-Based Outpatient Clinic
(CBOC) - even if a facility within 40 miles of where a veteran lives
doesn't provide the service that the veteran needs.
On Thursday, I spoke on United States Senate Floor to ask why the VA is
not bending over backwards to take care of our nation's veterans. The
agency that was created to serve veterans has the authority to avoid
this problem, yet remains unwilling to do what is in the best interest
of the veteran. In the absence of action by the VA to resolve these
failings, I am working on behalf of Kansas veterans and veterans across
the country by urging by colleagues in Congress to pass this
legislation. Click here

Supporting Military Families with the Military Spouses Job Continuity
Act
I introduced the Military Spouses Job Continuity Act this week, which
would help military spouses more easily re-enter the workforce by
offering a $500 tax credit to renew or transfer a professional license
due to a military Change of Station order. I led this bipartisan
legislation in the 113th Congress and am hopeful it will once again
receive significant support in the United States Senate.
Military spouses face various challenges when moving their families to
different installations across the country. With the frequency of
Change of Station orders, most military spouses experience difficulties
in pursuing their career of choice and are limited to career paths that
allow them to follow their spouse. These issues are exacerbated when a
spouse works in a field that requires a person to reapply for a
professional license when moving from one state to another.
Approximately 85 percent of military spouses either work, or desire to
work, outside the home and nearly 35 percent of these require licenses
or certification. I will continue to work on easing unnecessary
challenges placed on military families because our men and women in
uniform are only as strong as the families who support them.
March for Life
Each year on January 22, thousands of Americans come to Washington to
participate in the March for Life, held on the anniversary of the Roe
v. Wade decision in 1973. Once again, hundreds of Kansans made the
48-hour round-trip bus ride to walk in support of the inalienable right
to life. Every life matters, from conception to natural death, and I
look forward to Congress acting in defense of the unborn. I was pleased
to greet students from St. John Catholic School in Lawrence who came to
my office prior to the march.

Thank

State
of
the
Union
Address
The
President
previously
indicated
that
the
elections
last
November
were
a
referendum
on
his
policies.
Yet,
rather
than
outlining
a
change
of
direction
in
the
State
of
the
Union
Address
on
Tuesday,
he
continued
to
be
more
interested
in
higher
taxes,
overregulation
and
irresponsible
spending
than
in
working
with
Congress
to
grow
the
economy,
create
jobs
and
support
the
middle
class.
The
goal
of
our
economic
policies
should
not
be
increased
reliance
on
government
aid.
Rather,
the
goal
should
be
fostering
an
environment
that
allows
individuals
to
find
jobs
that
can
support
their
families.
There
is
a
real
desire
among
Americans
to
see
Congress
and
the
President
work
together
on
concrete
solutions
to
the
significant
challenges
we
face.
Unfortunately,
what
we
heard
was
not
problem
solving,
and
I
do
not
believe
there
is
any
real
expectation
by
the
President
that
his
proposals
will
actually
foster
cooperation
between
Capitol
Hill
at
the
White
House.
Let's
find
common
ground
and
try
to
solve
our
country's
problems.

Participating
in
Senate
Commerce
Committee
Hearing
on
Broadband
Regulation
On
Wednesday,
I
participated
in
my
first
Senate
Commerce
Committee
hearing
titled
"Protecting
the
Internet
and
Consumers
through
Congressional
Action."
The
discussion
focused
on
how
Congress
can
develop
rules
related
to
how
companies
manage
their
broadband
networks.
Next
month,
the
Federal
Communications
Commission
(FCC)
is
expected
to
approve
network
management
rules
that
would
regulate
broadband
like
other
heavily-regulated
utilities,
despite
Congress
never
granting
them
the
authority
to
do
so.
The
new
rules
will
likely
face
legal
challenges
that
could
last
years,
as
well
as
increase
regulatory
uncertainty
for
broadband
providers
and
consumers.
I
have
real
concerns
that
the
FCC's
unilateral
actions
could
impact
millions
of
Americans
and
rural
providers
who
are
working
to
expand
broadband
access
to
Kansans.
My
questions
at
the
hearing
were
related
to
making
certain
Kansans
don't
lose
access
to
broadband,
as
well
as
ensuring
the
next
great
Internet
entrepreneur
is
not
stifled
by
an
uncertain
regulatory
environment.
I
look
forward
to
working
with
my
colleagues
to
approve
a
legislative
solution
that
protects
consumers,
promotes
broadband
expansion,
and
encourages
broadband
adoption
so
that
more
Americans
may
realize
the
many
benefits
of
digital
economy.

Amendment
to
Delist
the
Lesser
Prairie
Chicken
I
offered
an
amendment
this
week
to
remove
the
lesser
prairie
chicken
(LPC)
from
the
threatened
species
list
under
the
Endangered
Species
Act.
The
amendment
is
considered
pending
to
S.1,
the
Keystone
XL
pipeline
legislation,
and
votes
on
pending
amendments
are
expected
to
continue
next
week.
The
LPC
was
listed
at
a
time
when
much
of
Kansas
was
in
a
severe
and
prolonged
drought.
In
fact,
during
the
2013
annual
aerial
survey
used
to
assess
the
LPC
population,
every
Kansas
County
that
includes
habitat
was
experiencing
a
D3-Extreme
or
D4-Exceptional
drought
according
to
the
U.S.
Drought
Monitor.
As
the
bird's
habitat
area
has
recently
received
more
rain
and
snow
fall,
its
population
has
surged
20
percent.
This
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
I
believe
the
bird
should
not
have
been
listed
in
the
first
place.
However,
the
U.S.
Fish
and
Wildlife
Service
instead
moved
forward
with
the
listing
last
spring,
and
now
rural
Kansas
is
beginning
to
suffer
the
consequences.
Increased
regulations
due
to
the
listing
will
continue
to
threaten
the
livelihoods
of
farmers
and
ranchers,
disrupt
oil
and
gas
exploration
and
wind
energy
projects,
and
hurt
the
economies
of
many
small
towns
scattered
across
our
state.
The
threatened
listing
of
the
LPC
is
one
of
the
most
consistent
items
I
hear
about
in
Southwest
Kansas.
While
the
fate
of
this
particular
amendment
is
uncertain,
it
has
allowed
me
to
raise
the
profile
of
this
important
issue
as
a
means
to
educate
my
fellow
Senators.
As
I
told
my
colleagues,
I'm
convinced
there
are
ways
to
conserve
the
species
without
infringing
on
private
property
rights
and
hindering
economic
opportunity
in
rural
Kansas.
I
don't
believe
listing
the
LPC
as
threatened
is
the
solution,
and
I
will
continue
to
fight
to
reverse
the
government's
misguided
decision.

Clay
Hunt
Suicide

Passes
Senate
Veterans

This
week,
during
the
Senate
Veterans'

mental
health
care
and
increase
suicide
prevention
resources
for
American
service
members&mdash;the
Clay
Hunt
Suicide
Prevention
for
American
Veterans
Act.
The
invisible
wounds
of
war
plague
thousands
of
veterans
across
our
country,
and
unfortunately
some
feel
the
only
choice
to
deal
with
their
wounds
is
to
take
their
own
life.
The
average
suicide
rate
among
veterans
is
a
staggering
22
deaths
each
day.
The
Clay

to
Community
Care
Act
of
2015
(S.
207)
to
require
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
to
utilize
its
current
authority
&ndash;
granted
through
the
Veterans
Access,
Choice,
and
Accountability
Act
of
2014
(VACAA)
that
passed
Congress
last
July
&ndash;
to
offer
health
care
to
veterans
who
are
unable
to
receive
the
services
they
need
from
a
VA
medical
facility
within
40
miles
of
where
they
live.
Unfortunately,
the
VA
continues
to
overlook
rural
veterans
as
they
implement
VACAA
by
defining
a
VA
medical
facility
as
any
facility
&ndash;
a
medical
center
or
a
Community-Based
Outpatient
Clinic
(CBOC)
&ndash;
even
if
a
facility
within
40
miles
of
where
a
veteran
lives
doesn't
provide
the
service
that
the
veteran
needs.
On
Thursday,
I
spoke
on
United
States
Senate
Floor
to
ask
why
the
VA
is
not
bending
over
backwards
to
take
care
of
our
nation's
veterans.
The
agency
that
was
created
to
serve
veterans
has
the
authority
to
avoid
this
problem,
yet
remains
unwilling
to
do
what
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
veteran.
In
the
absence
of
action
by
the
VA
to
resolve
these
failings,
I
am
working
on
behalf
of
Kansas
veterans
and
veterans
across
the
country
by
urging
by
colleagues
in
Congress
to
pass
this
legislation.

Supporting
Military
Families
with
the
Military
Spouses
Job
Continuity
Act
I
introduced
the
Military
Spouses
Job
Continuity
Act
this
week,
which
would
help
military
spouses
more
easily
re-enter
the
workforce
by
offering
a
$500
tax
credit
to
renew
or
transfer
a
professional
license
due
to
a
military
Change
of
Station
order.
I
led
this
bipartisan
legislation
in
the
113th
Congress
and
am
hopeful
it
will
once
again
receive
significant
support
in
the
United
States
Senate.
Military
spouses
face
various
challenges
when
moving
their
families
to
different
installations
across
the
country.
With
the
frequency
of
Change
of
Station
orders,
most
military
spouses
experience
difficulties
in
pursuing
their
career
of
choice
and
are
limited
to
career
paths
that
allow
them
to
follow
their
spouse.
These
issues
are
exacerbated
when
a
spouse
works
in
a
field
that
requires
a
person
to
reapply
for
a
professional
license
when
moving
from
one
state
to
another.
Approximately
85
percent
of
military
spouses
either
work,
or
desire
to
work,
outside
the
home
and
nearly
35
percent
of
these
require
licenses
or
certification.
I
will
continue
to
work
on
easing
unnecessary
challenges
placed
on
military
families
because
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
are
only
as
strong
as
the
families
who
support
them.
March
for
Life
Each
year
on
January
22,
thousands
of
Americans
come
to
Washington
to
participate
in
the
March
for
Life,
held
on
the
anniversary
of
the
Roe
v.
Wade
decision
in
1973.
Once
again,
hundreds
of
Kansans
made
the
48-hour
round-trip
bus
ride
to
walk
in
support
of
the
inalienable
right
to
life.
Every
life
matters,
from
conception
to
natural
death,
and
I
look
forward
to
Congress
acting
in
defense
of
the
unborn.
I
was
pleased
to
greet
students
from
St.
John
Catholic
School
in
Lawrence
who
came
to
my
office
prior
to
the
march.
My
