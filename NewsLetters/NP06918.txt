Friend,
First of all, thank you. After you saw the news about Karl Rove&#39;s $900,000 ad buy, you stepped up and helped us raise over $5,000. I&#39;m grateful.
That money helped us produce our first ad - now, we need another $10,000 this week in order to get it up and running.
Click here to watch our ad - then give $5, $10, or whatever you can to help us fight back against the Ose-Rove money machine.
We won&#39;t be able to match their $900,000 television ad buy, but that&#39;s ok. Our message is much more powerful than theirs. Doug Ose may have Karl Rove&#39;s money - but I have supporters like you.
Click here now to help us spread our message and get our ad running.
Thank you - talk again soon.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
PS - It&#39;s unheard of for outside attack ads to be up and running this early - but starting tomorrow, that&#39;s what we&#39;re facing.
Karl Rove&#39;s money machine will be spreading lies all over the district, and we need your help to fight back. Click here and give $5 or more, right now.
