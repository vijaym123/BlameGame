Citizens United
so much? Just look at this chart of non-committee outside spending. (the red bar is Republicans) Wonder why we&rsquo;re so thankful you&rsquo;re standing with us? Together, we&rsquo;re proving that a grassroots movement of supporters giving $5 and $50 can compete with Republicans&rsquo; secret money spending spree. Your donations have allowed our community organizers to reach out to more than 20 million(!) voters! So we just wanted to take a moment to say &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo; for all you do! Can we send you a FREE &ldquo;Fix Congress&rdquo; bumper sticker as a token of our appreciation? Just click here to tell us where to send it &gt;&gt; Get your free sticker:
