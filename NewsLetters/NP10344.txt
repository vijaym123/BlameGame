Dear Friend,
"We want him held without bail."
A young Assistant District Attorney, I had just walked into the
courtroom on a Friday morning to arraign an individual for larceny when
a couple stopped me. They were the parents of the defendant, and they
had a request I had never heard before.
They wanted me to ask the judge if their son could be held without bail
over the weekend, just so he could make it to a treatment bed they had
reserved for him on Monday.
Their son was a veteran who had just returned from fighting overseas.
But when he came back, he came back addicted to OxyContin. And when
this young veteran stood up in court that day to address the judge, he
did the most amazing thing.
He apologized. Then he echoed his parents'
plea and asked the judge to hold him in prison for the weekend, because
he didn't think he would make it to Monday otherwise.
The judge granted their request and - as far as I know - the young man
went off to treatment the following week to get the help he needed.
I told this story at an event during my first campaign, and a man came
up to me afterwards with tears in his eyes.
"That story you told could
have been my son's story," he said.
"Except he didn't make it."
At
twenty-nine years old, this man's son returned from serving his country
overseas and lost his life to opiate abuse.
It's hard to find a person in this Commonwealth who has not been
directly or indirectly affected by the rising tide of opiate and heroin
abuse in our state. According to the Governor's Office, opiate
overdoses in Massachusetts rose by 90 percent between 2000 and 2012.
Here's what many people don't know: addiction and abuse often start in
an unassuming place - the family medicine cabinet.
Over two-thirds of
people who abuse prescription medication obtain it through friends and
family. Approximately 4 out of 5 heroin users started with prescription
opioids before moving on to harder drugs.
This Saturday, April 26, is National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day.
It's an annual event sponsored by the Drug Enforcement Administration
where people can drop off unused or unwanted prescription drugs with
their local law enforcement agencies, no questions asked.
If you are a resident of the 4th Congressional District, click here to
visit my website
and find a drop-off location in your area. If
you live outside our district, visit the DEA website
for information about your
region.
As I've traveled across the 4th District this year, person after person
has asked me what they can do to help address this heartbreaking
epidemic.
My answer to them is this: clean out your medicine cabinet.
Find that bottle of unused painkillers that you were prescribed for
last year's sports injury or dental surgery. Take the 20 minutes to
safely discard it by driving down to the local police station.
The easiest addictions to treat are the ones that never start.
Dropping off our unused prescription drugs is one small step each of us
can take to prevent another Massachusetts family from having a painful
story to tell.
Sincerely,
Congressman Joe Kennedy

Dear
Friend,
&#8220;We
want
him
held
without
bail.&#8221;
A
young
Assistant
District
Attorney,
I
had
just
walked
into
the
courtroom
on
a
Friday
morning
to
arraign
an
individual
for
larceny
when
a
couple
stopped
me.
They
were
the
parents
of
the
defendant,
and
they
had
a
request
I
had
never
heard
before.
They
wanted
me
to
ask
the
judge
if
their
son
could
be
held
without
bail
over
the
weekend,
just
so
he
could
make
it
to
a
treatment
bed
they
had
reserved
for
him
on
Monday.
Their
son
was
a
veteran
who
had
just
returned
from
fighting
overseas.
But
when
he
came
back,
he
came
back
addicted
to
OxyContin.
And
when
this
young
veteran
stood
up
in
court
that
day
to
address
the
judge,
he
did
the
most
amazing
thing.
He
apologized.
Then
he
echoed
his
parents&#8217;
plea
and
asked
the
judge
to
hold
him
in
prison
for
the
weekend,
because
he
didn&#8217;t
think
he
would
make
it
to
Monday
otherwise.
The
judge
granted
their
request
and
&#8211;
as
far
as
I
know
&#8211;
the
young
man
went
off
to
treatment
the
following
week
to
get
the
help
he
needed.
I
told
this
story
at
an
event
during
my
first
campaign,
and
a
man
came
up
to
me
afterwards
with
tears
in
his
eyes.
&#8220;That
story
you
told
could
have
been
my
son&#8217;s
story,&#8221;
he
said.
&#8220;Except
he
didn&#8217;t
make
it.&#8221;
At
twenty-nine
years
old,
this
man&#8217;s
son
returned
from
serving
his
country
overseas
and
lost
his
life
to
opiate
abuse.
It&#8217;s
hard
to
find
a
person
in
this
Commonwealth
who
has
not
been
directly
or
indirectly
affected
by
the
rising
tide
of
opiate
and
heroin
abuse
in
our
state.
According
to
the
Governor&#8217;s
Office,
opiate
overdoses
in
Massachusetts
rose
by
90
percent
between
2000
and
2012.
Here&#8217;s
what
many
people
don&#8217;t
know:
addiction
and
abuse
often
start
in
an
unassuming
place
&#8211;
the
family
medicine
cabinet.
Over two-thirds
of
people
who
abuse
prescription
medication
obtain
it
through
friends
and
family.
Approximately
4
out
of
5
heroin
users
started
with
prescription
opioids
before
moving
on
to
harder
drugs.
This
Saturday,
April
26,
is
National
Prescription
Drug
Take-Back
Day.
It&#8217;s
an
annual
event
sponsored
by
the
Drug
Enforcement
Administration
where
people
can
drop
off
unused
or
unwanted
prescription
drugs
with
their
local
law
enforcement
agencies,
no
questions
asked.

As
I&#8217;ve

the
4 th
District
this
