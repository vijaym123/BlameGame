Dear Fellow Nevadan,
Today
we commemorate the legacy of a great
American hero who committed
his life to the pursuit of social justice and dignity in the
workplace. Cesar Chavez fought tirelessly to improve the lives of farm workers
and all American workers. He has become an icon for Latinos in Nevada
and around the country. Cesar Chavez encapsulated the Latino
communitys tenacity and optimism in his rallying cry, S, se puede, or Yes,
we can. This rallying cry embodies and unites us as Americans and
has inspired countless individuals to serve our great
country.
Motivated by his own experience working in the fields, Cesar Chavez
founded the National Farm Workers Associationnow United Farm Workersin
1962 in an effort to improve labor conditions for farm workers. For
the next thirty years, Chavez dedicated his life to the struggle of
working families, fighting for living wages, equal pay for equal work and
defending the right to organize.
I will continue fighting to
uphold the values Cesar Chavez fought for. I hope Senate Republicans
will put partisan politics aside and join me to pass legislation that
protects workers rights as well as the right to organize, grow
the middle class, ensure women receive equal pay for equal work and end
the separation of families by passing comprehensive immigration
reform.
