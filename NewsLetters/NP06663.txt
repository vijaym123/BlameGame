Dear Neighbor,
We received a tremendous amount of input from across the district listening to superintendents, teachers, parents, mental health and law enforcement personnel about ways to make schools safer. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re finalizing legislation now to put local school districts in a better position to access
School Resource Officers
and plan for upcoming school years. Our bill will reauthorize the COPS (Community Oriented Policing Services) program on a long-term, five-year basis with prioritization for law enforcement to apply for School Resource Officer grants.
RIDE-ALONG
Thanks Shawn, and UPS, for letting me join on your morning route!
This week the great folks at the UPS facility in Painted Post took us on a ride-along in the Southern Tier to hand-deliver packages to local businesses. After suiting up, we helped driver Shawn deliver packages in Corning, making stops at the Glass Menagerie, Market Street Chiropractic &amp; Nutrition, M&amp;T Bank and the
Corning Area Chamber of Commerce .
HONORING GREAT WOMEN
Speaking with Jeanne Giovannini, Vice President, Board of Directors (far right) and Hall of Fame volunteers and employees during the tour in Seneca Falls.
Last week we toured the
National Women&rsquo;s Hall of Fame , which was created in 1969 by residents of Seneca Falls. After a tour of the current gallery (where we saw exhibits featuring Lucille Ball and Elaine Collins), we walked over to the construction at the Seneca Knitting Mill, the building under rehabilitation to become the new National Women&rsquo;s Hall of Fame. The Hall of Fame is looking to have the building, which operated as a mill from 1844 until 1999, open to the public by 2018. With the skillful leadership of the board, employees and volunteers at the Hall of Fame, I have no doubt the rehabilitation will be a great addition to Seneca Falls and all those who travel to our area for a chance to see the museum and honor these impressive women.
KIDS AND CRITTERS
Speaking here with a group of campers at Camp Onseyawa in Ovid.
We recently had the opportunity to
tour Camp Onseyawa , a Rotary-supported camp that gives children with disabilities a great camping experience, while helping them grow in self-confidence and experience success in physical activities and relationships. It was great to meet the campers and staff at Camp Onseyawa, and learn about the important work they do to care for disabled children. These are the types of programs that make a real difference in our communities. During our visit, we met up with the folks from
Bridges For Brain Injury
and some of their very interesting wildlife friends.
With the folks from Bridges For Brain Injury, and Boca the gator!
WHAT&rsquo;S NEXT?
This Friday we'll be meeting with Gary Mervis from Camp Good Days.
Next week, we&rsquo;re headed back to Washington, after a great August in the district, having the opportunity to meet with and listen to so many of you. Visit our
website
to see more from the month.
Head over to our
Facebook
page to check out our recent stops such as our tour of the historic the Benjamin Patterson Inn Museum in Corning.
P.S. We&rsquo;ve got
office hours !
P.P.S. It&rsquo;s that time again!
Best,
Tom
