John Boehner must have just gone off the deep end when he saw this:
Last night we did something incredible&hellip; Something the Republicans could never even dream of&hellip;
That&rsquo;s right. We hit an unprecedented 3,OOO,OOO online donations to elect Democrats. That&rsquo;s a powerful grassroots movement for progress.
But we only have about 5 minutes to celebrate, because we have to get back to work right now. Boehner&rsquo;s allies just piled in another $4.7 million to steal this election.
David, election day is in just 12 days. We can&rsquo;t rest on our laurels. We&rsquo;re pleading with you to keep fighting with us. We need you in these final days. Will you answer President Obama&rsquo;s call-to action now?
