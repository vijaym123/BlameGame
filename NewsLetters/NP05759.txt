There are 3 things you need to know. David -- please pay attention: 1. In 72 hours, Tea Party ringleader Allen West is holding a MASSIVE fundraiser in our district. Every dollar he raises will be spent attacking Democrats like Cheri.
2. West isn't alone. Right now, Boehner's in the midst of a $4.8 MILLION assault on the Illinois airwaves.
3. Together, we CAN fight back against Boehner and West. In the last month, we&rsquo;ve received over 3,172 online donations. That&rsquo;s exactly the kind of grassroots effort we need to get out the facts to Illinois voters!!!
David, if we can raise $15,OOO for Cheri before Wednesday's big event, it&rsquo;ll be a MAJOR victory for us. But if we can&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;ll be a tragic conclusion to what could have been a great night.
$9,363 to go -- are you in? Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
