CONGRESSMAN CARTER SUPPORTS THE
FORT HOOD COMMUNITY
On April 2, Spc. Ivan Lopez opened fire on Fort Hood
killing three and wounding 16 before turning the gun on himself and
taking his own life. In disbelief that this could happen a second time
on Fort Hood, Congressman Carter immediately began finding ways to
support the Central Texas community in every way he could. Within hours he
was spreading awarness of the horrendous crime that took place to
news stations broadcasting all over the world and within the following
week, visited victims in the hospital and attended the
Fort Hood Memorial
service on April 9. Congressman
Carter will fight to ensure that the victims of the 2009 attack and
the April 2 attack are protected and helped. Please read the
statement
that was
released.
