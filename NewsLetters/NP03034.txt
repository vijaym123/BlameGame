Seniority pays off in Committee assignments - Because of overall election losses last November there are fewer Democrats allowed on the two committees where I sit
Natural Resources and Education and the Workforce. Nevertheless, because of my six years of seniority I was able to retain membership and even win promotion to Vice-Ranking Member for the entire Natural Resources Committee during this weeks organizational meetings. Democratic Ranking Member Ral Grijalva of Arizona explained that he had named me as Vice-Ranking Member in part "to highlight the insular areas as important to Democrats and important to the Resources Committee. I will also keep my seats on the Education Committees Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education Subcommittee and Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions Subcommittee. After Democratic losses in 2010 I had to give up membership on Education and move to the Agriculture Committee, but the Northern Marianas position is now protected by my built-up seniority.

LIHEAP topped off at $211,219 for FY15 - The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program grant to the Commonwealth was topped off with another $18,895 this month, bringing the fiscal year 2015 total to $211,219. This is four times more than the Commonwealth previously received. As a result, the number of households getting help with their CUC bill has gone up from 296 to 343 with a higher average monthly benefit of $58 per household, according to the CNMI Department of Community and Cultural Affairs, which manages the grant. The increase came after efforts by myself and other insular area representatives convinced HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius that more help was needed given that poverty levels in the islands are three to five times the national average and the price of electricity is two to four times more than most Americans pay.

How the Marianas High School Aeronautical Dolphins beat the odds to win the national Real World Design Challenge was the story I told at an award ceremony this week for leaders in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics
STEM
education. I helped the Dolphins find military surplus aviation textbooks when they were getting started, but America cannot afford to have schools where 16 students have to share 3 textbooks
or beg for books from the Pentagon," I told the assembled educators and business people. If we fail to invest everything we can in our students today, we wont have much of a nation tomorrow.
Congressional leaders in STEM education honored - Along with 10 other members of the House and the Senate, I was recognized this week for leadership in education by STEM4US!. This non-profit organization is dedicated to bringing more young people and adults into the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This week, I also became an original cosponsor of the Stepping Up to STEM Education Act, H.R. 565 , authored by my colleague Mike Honda, who represents parts of Californias high-tech Silicon Valley. Enactment of the bill would increase the availability and quality of STEM education for students across the nation and, especially, for minorities who remain underrepresented
in the workforces of Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and other industry leaders.

NMI shark fin ban not at odds with federal fishing laws - After months of discussion with the Commonwealth Government and input from myself and 60 other Members of Congress , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has agreed
that Northern Mariana Islands Public Law 17-27, banning the trade in shark fins, does not conflict with federal fishing laws. NOAA proposed an administrative rule in June 2013 that would have preempted bans on shark finning enacted in California, Maryland, the Northern Marianas, and other coastal jurisdictions. A federal court upheld the California law
last year and NOAA has been working with other states and territories to reach an understanding on the issue. Shark finning refers to the removal and retention of the shark fins and discarding the carcass at sea. This unsustainable practice is believed to be responsible for the deaths of millions of sharks each year.

Its time again for the Congressional Art Competition - High school artists from the Northern Mariana Islands are invited to enter their work in the 2015 Congressional Art Competition. The winning entry will be exhibited at the U.S. Capitol, alongside the works of students from each of the nations 441 congressional districts, for a year. Members of Congress, congressional staff, and tens of thousands of visitors view the often-striking and ever-varied art. Previous winners from the Northern Marianas were Hannah Alcordo, Krisna Balolong, Rosanna L. Camacho, Bryan Jose Obaldo Deleon Guerrero, and Su Jeong Kim of Marianas High School and Aaron Tomokane of Kagman High School. Their work has often depicted the life, history, or culture of our islands, but there is no limit on entrants artistic imaginations. Information packets with details about the 2015 Congressional Art Competition are being sent to all NMI high schools and are also available on the web at http://sablan.house.gov/sites/sablan.house.gov/files/documents/2015%20Congressional%20Art%20Competition%20Packet.pdf. The deadline for submission is Friday, April 10, 2015. Entries are judged by an independent panel of local artists.

While visiting relatives in Virginia, Bianca and Jeremiah Muna dropped by their congressional office to say hello and take a tour of the U.S. Capitol. I spoke with the couple about their life in Jacksonville, Florida and
let them know this is their office and we are here if they are ever in need of assistance. Thank you both for coming by.
