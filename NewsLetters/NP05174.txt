Greetings:
While traveling across North Dakota this month, I've enjoyed meeting
with many of you to discuss important issues facing our state. One of
those issues is Waters of the U.S. - a rule proposed by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
that would heavily burden farmers, ranchers and industry. I
have and will continue to work hard in the Senate Appropriations
Committee to de-authorize and de-fund this onerous rule.
Rail, energy and defense infrastructure are also issues important for
North Dakota, and below you can learn more about our efforts in these
areas, including our work with BNSF
, Canadian Pacific Railway
,
the Surface Transportation Board (STB)
and the Department of Transportation (DOT)
to
secure a real commitment to timely and safe rail transportation for our
agriculture and energy industries.
Sincerely,
John Hoeven
U.S. Senator

Waters of the United States
Hoeven Working to Prevent Implementation of EPA's Waters of the U.S.
Rule
BISMARCK, N.D. - Senator John Hoeven told members of the U.S.
Cattlemen's Association (USCA) and the Independent Beef Association of
North Dakota (I-BAND) that they are good stewards of the land and
water, and he is working on the Senate Appropriations Committee to
prevent the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of
Engineers from implementing the proposed Waters of the U.S. rule.
Hoeven discusses the Waters of the U.S. rule with members of USCA and
I-BAND
"North Dakota's ranchers and farmers have a long and successful history
of good stewardship of the land and water, as they provide Americans
with the highest quality of beef in the world. The Waters of the U.S.
rule is not only a violation of private property rights, but it
subjects our farmers and ranchers to a burdensome and costly new
regulation. To make matters worse, it will also impede our efforts to
build the housing, hotels, retail stores, roads and bridges necessary
to maintain our high quality of life and our dynamic economic growth."

Greetings:
While
traveling
across
North
Dakota
this
month,
I've
enjoyed
meeting
with
many
of
you
to
discuss
important
issues
facing
our
state.
One
of
those
issues
is
Waters
of
the
U.S.
&#8212;
a
rule
proposed
by
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(EPA)
that
would
heavily
burden
farmers,
ranchers
and
industry.
I
have
and
will
continue
to
work
hard
in
the
Senate
Appropriations
Committee
to
de-authorize
and
de-fund
this
onerous
rule.
Rail,

are
also
issues
important
for
North

and
below
you
can
learn
more
about
our
efforts
in
these
areas,
including
our
work
with
BNSF ,
Canadian
Pacific

the

and
the
Department

to
secure
a

for
our

with
members

&#8220;North

good

they
provide
Americans

The
Waters
of

is
not
only
a
violation
of
private
property
rights,
but
it
subjects
our
farmers
and
ranchers
to
a
burdensome
and
costly
new
regulation.
To
make
matters
worse,
it
will
also
impede
our
efforts
to
build
the
housing,
hotels,
retail
stores,
roads
and
bridges
necessary
to
maintain
our
high
quality
of
