This week,
I was honored to hear Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu speak to Congress. In his speech, he asked for
America's unwavering support for Israel, a country that has been a consistent
friend and ally in a tumultuous region. It's unfortunate the Prime
Minister felt that he even had to ask us for our support. Over the last
six years, I have watched this Administration's foreign policy failures
in the Middle East pile up and erode our relationship with Israel. I
will continue to support the United States' partnership and am
thankful for the Prime Minister's address to Congress on
Tuesday.
Monday, the independent Center for Health and Economy
released their analysis
of the
Patient Choice,
Affordability, Responsibility, and Empowerment (CARE) Act .
The Center for Health and Economy found that the Patient CARE Act would
lower premiums, improve access to providers, increase medical
productivity, and reduce the nations deficit by hundreds of billions of
dollars.
Better access, higher quality, and more affordability
these are the central tenets that any health care reform should strive
for, and they are precisely what the Patient CARE Act would achieve.
Americans continue to grapple with the messy fallout and broken
promises of Obamacare
including higher costs, inaccurate tax forms,
reduced choices, and increased difficulty finding a doctor. There is a
better way. This analysis confirms that empowering patients, not
Washington, leads to a stronger, more accountable and responsive health care
system. We look forward to continuing to work with our colleagues on
advancing health reforms that will protect Americans who are suffering
from Obamacares costly consequences as we move toward a system that puts
health care back in the hands of patients, families, and their
doctors, not Washington.

Economys analysis

This week, Blue
Cross and Blue Shield reported its first loss in 15 years due to
Obamacare. The "Affordable Care Act" continues to be unaffordable. You can
