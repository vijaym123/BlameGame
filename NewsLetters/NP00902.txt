 this week to prohibit states that receive federal transportation funding from engaging in unconstitutional profiling based on physical characteristics, such as race.
I hope that Members of Congress, regardless of our differences, will agree on the importance of restricting the use of federal funds that promote the unconstitutional practice of racial profiling.
Marching to Celebrate Success and Demand Progress for the LGBT Community
On June 7, I had a great time marching in the annual Capital Pride Parade
with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community, as I have every year since being elected to Congress.
We not only marched to celebrate the many advances the LGBT community has made, we also marched to demand progress on the many fronts that are still lagging behind for LGBT rights and equality.
Helping D.C. Small Businesses with Free Workshops and One-on-One Counseling
I am grateful that our annual Small Business Fair
on June 5 at the Convention Center was so successful.
District small businesses participated and learned how to develop and grow small businesses in a recovering economy.
Workshops on everything from writing a small business plan to financing a small business ran throughout the day, along with one-on-one counseling from small business experts, banks and government procurement officers.
Welcoming the Newest District Court Judge for D.C., Tanya Chutkan
On June 4, Tanya Chutkan's nomination
to become a judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia was confirmed by the Senate.
Chutkan, whom I recommended to President Obama, is now the second African American woman I have recommended for the district court here, only the third to ever serve, and the second currently on the bench.
Thanking Federal Employees as Fed Food Drive Begins
On June 2, I was pleased to speak
at the U.S. Department of Agriculture Feds Feed Families Food Drive National Kick-off Ceremony.
Federal employees deserve a huge thank you for stepping forward with this generosity for a fifth year in a row at a time when hundreds of thousands of them have faced furloughs and three years of pay freezes.
D.C. Students Impress at Congressional Art Competition Ceremony
On June 2, I announced the D.C. winners of the annual Congressional Art Competition

First place went to Michela Demas, a junior from St. John's College High School; second place went to Jadine Sonoda, a junior from Georgetown Day School; and third place went to Terrale Green, a senior at Duke Ellington School of the Arts.
All attendees received a variety of prizes, and the three winners were awarded college scholarships. I am especially grateful to the volunteer members of our Congressional Art Competition committee and our panel of distinguished artists, who have stepped forward with a valuable public service and continue to play an integral role promoting youth arts in the city.
