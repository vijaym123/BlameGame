I&rsquo;m asking you to donate $5.
Sorry to be blunt -- but we need 12,OOO donors to step up in the next 24 hours. David, if you opened this email, I&rsquo;m counting on you to be one of those: All Donations to this email
TRIPLE-MATCHED Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
There&rsquo;s just no reason to dance around it. The race for Congress is brutally close. 32 of our Democratic candidates are deadlocked in toss up races.
You and I know what&rsquo;s at stake in this election.
To hit our goal before tomorrow&rsquo;s final ad buy deadline, we need 6 Democrats from the 60659 zip code to step up and chip in. Please be one of those, David: https://action.dccc.org/Chip-In
Thanks,
Nancy
