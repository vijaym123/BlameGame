Republicans just held a hearing in Congress to sue President Obama for DOING HIS JOB!
David -- I&rsquo;ll get straight to the point:
We need a monumental response to this unprecedented Republican attack. We can&rsquo;t just stand by and let Boehner steamroll President Obama.
We're just 16,791 donations from hitting 200,000 strong since Boehner revealed his lawsuit. That would throw a serious wrench in Boehner&rsquo;s lawsuit plan.
If you&rsquo;ve been waiting to chip in, there is no better time than RIGHT NOW. Are you with me?
ALL GIFTS TODAY TRIPLE-MATCHED! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
Nancy
