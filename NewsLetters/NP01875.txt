Republicans in Congress are trying to undermine every bit of progress we&rsquo;ve made together.
They&rsquo;ve challenged my authority to take executive action. They&rsquo;ve tried to repeal reform. They&rsquo;ve even sued me.
So David, I&rsquo;m asking for a quick favor:
My friends at the DCCC are trying to take on the Republicans standing in our way -- but they still need 6 people from the 60659 zip code to chip in to their Republican Accountability Project.
David, I&rsquo;m counting on you to be one of those. Can you chip in $5 or more before the fundraising deadline hits in 48 hours?
All Donations Triple-Matched Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
The American people are with us on all of the big issues. They want to raise the minimum wage, pass equal pay laws, and close all those tax loopholes for millionaires.
But the Republican Congress is too married to obstruction to do what&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s why your activism is so crucial. It&rsquo;s up to all of us to expose how Republican inaction in Washington is hurting middle-class families all across this country.
So I&rsquo;m asking: can you chip in $5 before the deadline? https://secure.dccc.org/Chip-In
