Dear Friend,
Many times as I walk through or accompany constituents in the United States Capitol in Washington, DC, Im reminded of and encouraged by the great men and women of faith who sacrificed so much to help forge this nation. Devoted prayer was an important part of our their lives.
Today, the first Thursday of May, Americans of all faiths are invited to come together and pray for our great nation on a National Day of Prayer. This day gives us the opportunity to acknowledge the many blessings God has brought into our lives and to ask for his continued guidance for our country and for our families in the days to come. President Truman eloquently affirmed this purpose in 1952 by setting aside a day for prayer, understanding that from the earliest days of our history our people have been accustomed to turn to Almighty God for help and guidance.
Let us not forget to give thanks for a nation where we are free to pray, free to worship, free to speak, and free to believe as we choose.
I hope you will join me in especially praying for our men and women in the Armed Forces who continue to protect our nation at home and abroad and please pray for the continued guidance for all of our elected leaders as we seek to work for the good of our country. My hope is that the important role of prayer in our lives will continue to be a part of our countrys tradition.
2 Chronicles 7:14 reminds us, If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
God Bless,
