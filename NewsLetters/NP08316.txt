BREAKING NEWS: Boehner announces lawsuit against Obama
Just moments after President Obama emailed you, Boehner took a drastic step to take the President down:
Boehner&rsquo;s planning on using taxpayer money to sue President Obama.
Let&rsquo;s face it. Republicans will use every last dirty trick to throw a wrench in the spokes of progress. They shut down the government. They&rsquo;re blocking everything President Obama proposes. And now this.
It&rsquo;s a serious slap in the face to all of us. The single best thing we can do right now is respond to President Obama&rsquo;s call to action with an outpouring of support.
Let&rsquo;s hit 20,000 donations strong today to land a blistering blow to Boehner.
