VISITING DC
March 28, 2015
This week, the Senate
made good on a promise made this past fall
we passed the Republican
budget 52-46 after a thorough debate and amendment process. Over the
last few years, Washington has continued to rack up debt, without ever
checking to see whether we can pay governments bill. Passage of a
budget that balances in ten years is a critical step to getting our
country in the right direction without raising taxes on American families.
After hours of open debate on the issue, the Senate advanced a serious
proposal that puts our country on the path to fiscal responsibility.
North Carolinians understand the fundamental reality that you cant
spend more than you take in. Its time that Washington recognizes this
reality as well. We will now work with our House colleagues on a budget
to send to the Presidents desk.
During the
amendment process, I offered
Amendment 62
to
simplify repaying student loans, which passed with overwhelming support
on a voice vote. The amendment, based on
the Repay
Act,
helps students and their families find the right repayment
program, ultimately fixing the maze that Washington has built around the
student loan repay programs.
North
Carolinians are tired of seeing their hard-earned tax dollars go to
waste in a student loan program that serves neither their interests nor
those of the college students it is intended to help. You can hear
more about the Amendment 62 by watching by floor speech
below.

programs
Five years ago Monday, Obamacare was enacted. I warned then that
this law would be a disaster for our health care system, doctors, and
patients. This law has put our country on an unsustainable path of
increased costs, government mandates, and broken promises. North
Carolinians have seen their health insurance premiums increase, their existing
coverage cancelled, and lost access to their doctors. Our nations
health care system was broken before Obamacare, but because of it, things
are worse today than before. Obamacare is a failure and I will
continue to advocate to repeal and replace it because I believe there are
better alternatives that will fulfill the promise to lower health care
costs and empower patients in their health care decisionswhat
Obamacare fundamentally fails to do.
I joined Bill Hemmer on Americas Newsroom
this past Monday to discuss the situation in Yemen and Iran
you can
watch the clip below.
Chairman Burr joins Americas
Newsroom
We have
consistently been behind the curve as it relates to Iran nuclear [weapons].
I would love to say we know everything about Iran, but theres not as
much inside information that were able to gather. We rely on our
partners around the world. And Bill, this is why its so important, its
why the Congress speaks out. If we dont have those partners, we begin
to have hearing loss, sight loss. As we talk about cutting a bad deal
in Iran. That puts our partners in jeopardy from our standpoint of
their relationship with us. WE could be fueling an expansion of nuclear
proliferation in the Middle East, not a contraction.
Speaking of the situation in Yemen, Ill be
joining CBSs Face The Nation on Sunday at 10:30am to discuss on-going
developments. Please tune in!
Finally, starting Monday,
the Senate will be in a two week state work period. During that time I
will be in North Carolina visiting places across our state. Keep an
eye on
Twitter
and
Facebook
for updates and announcements.
Sincerely,
Richard Burr
