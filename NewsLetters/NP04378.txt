Hello!
I promised I
would keep you up-to-date on what is happening in Washington, so I
wanted to drop you a quick note. Many of you know that the biggest event
in the past several days was the President's speech, Thursday night,
regarding the actions he was taking to protect our border and allow
five million hardworking peope to come out of the shadows, and out from
under the constant weight of fear of
deportation.
Friday morning, I joined MSNBC's Morning Joe to
discuss the President's speech, and what it means for our nation and our
economy.

After my appearance on MSNBC, the conservative
Washington
Times
wrote a good summary of the points I made, and focused on an
important point: Congress has not done its job. That's why the President
acted.
I hope you'll check out the article
below, use the social media tools here to share my video and forward
this email to anyone you think needs to see it. They can sign up to

an incredibly important step taken by the
President.
Thanks for reading, and for your support!
WASHINGTON TIMES -- Tony
Cardenas:
Obama finally said, enough is enough
By
David
Sherfinski
- The Washington Times - Friday,
November 21, 2014
Rep. Tony Cardenas, California
Democrat, said Friday that President Obama's executive action to grant
temporary legal status to millions of illegal immigrants isn't about
what Congress didn't do, but about what Congress has refused to
do.
Mr. Cardenas pointed out that 68 senators voted in a
"tripartisan" manner
because there were two supportive independents
to pass a
broad bill in 2013 granting most illegal immigrants in the country an
eventual pathway to citizenship.
"Now it's been sitting in
our House, Republican-controlled House, for over 500 days," he said
on MSNBC's "Morning Joe." "So I think what happened is the president
finally said, 'Enough is enough. We need to take care of our economy. We
need to take care of business.' "
"It's not about the
president doing anything that Congress didn't do, it's about the president
doing something to help our economy forward that Congress refuses to
do," Mr. Cardenas continued.
He also said he'd "love" for
Republicans supportive of the Senate bill to take credit for
it.
"The 14 Republican senators should take credit
they helped pass
[a] bill," Mr. Cardenas said.
But the politics of
immigration are complicated for the GOP. Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican
and a member of the so-called "Gang of Eight" that crafted the bill,
has moved to distance himself from the measure after conservatives
objected to it.
National Republicans, particularly in the wake
of the 2012 presidential election, have said the GOP needs to make
more durable inroads with Latino voters if they hope to have long-term
electoral success.
But contenders for the 2016 GOP
presidential nomination are likely to face questions about whether they would
seek to reverse Mr. Obama's executive action should Congress not pass
legislation on the issue, with anything but a definitive "yes"
potentially alienating hardline conservative voters who comprise much of the
electorate in GOP primaries.
