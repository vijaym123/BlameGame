MAJOR UPDATE:
House Republicans held a closed-door meeting to discuss impeaching President Obama.
Reportedly, the secret meeting of Tea Party Republicans took place in Congress on Friday.
This news is a shocking confirmation of the White House's warning: Boehner&rsquo;s lawsuit could lead to impeachment hearings. There's no doubt now:
the fate of Obama's presidency is at stake. We need to throw everything we've got at this.
The vote to sue President Obama on the House floor is THIS WEEK. Will you help us hit our $2 million RED ALERT goal before midnight tonight?
