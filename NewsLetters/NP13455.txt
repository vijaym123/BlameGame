Starting next year, millions of Americans will start to see the benefits of affordable health care coverage made available through the Affordable Care Act. People across the country, some for the very first time in their life, will start to experience the peace of mind health care brings.
The Illinois health insurance marketplace is open and ready to help get you and your family covered. This marketplace was created by the Affordable Care Act and will expand coverage to more than 1.4 million in Illinois who currently are uninsured, while adding important consumer protections to those who already have insurance.
I&rsquo;ve signed up for my health care coverage through the marketplace and I hope you&rsquo;ll do the same. To ensure coverage by January 1st, you must sign up by December 23rd. So visit
www.getcoveredillinois.gov
or call (866) 311-1119 today.
Watch my message to those in Illinois who are currently uninsured or just looking for new health coverage options
