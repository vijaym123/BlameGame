Hello,
It was a busy and productive week in
Congress this week and I look forward to seeing my constituents
throughout the district in my upcoming week at
home.
Buy
American
This week, I introduced a bipartisan bill that will
strengthen Buy America laws which impact federal purchases when it
comes to transportation.
If we are
going to spend the tax dollars of our hard-working constituents, we
should at least do everything we can to spend them on American made
products and projects whenever possible.
Closing these loopholes means the competitive advantage goes to
American companies and will create American jobs, not foreign
ones.
Small Business
Symposium
I'll be participating in a Small Business Symposium on June 5th
and I hope you'll consider attending. The deadline to register is
Thursday 5/28.
Impressive High School
Students
I had a chance to meet
Zachary Bogorad from Solon High School yesterday, he's a member of the
U.S. Physics team. He is an impressive young man and is certainly making
us proud.
Appropriations
The House continues to get things done. This week we passed the
FY16 Legislative Branch Appropriations Bill to make sure legislative
branch operations can continue. Here are 7 things to like about the
bill:
Memorial
Day
Thank you to all of the men and women who have served
and sacrificed to make our nation the greatest on Earth. Let us
remember them on this Memorial
Day.
