Dear
Friend,
Continuing my work to investigate waste, fraud and abuse, this week I
conducted a review of the continued mismanagement and huge taxpayer
losses plaguing public housing in Sanford.
My work disclosed
that nearly all of the valuable Sanford Housing Authority property is
vacant or boarded up.
Taxpayers paid $860,000 last year to
manage just six remaining units.
Outrageous water and utility bills
for six families in one month topped $12,000.

I
am encouraging local, State and federal leaders to consolidate
operations at the Sanford Housing Authority to improve administration by
eliminating duplicative bureaucracies.
Additionally, we are looking
at partnering with the private sector to develop a plan to not only
save taxpayer money but also to provide quality housing on vacant
property without public cost.
This week, I have sent
letters to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Inspector
General of and the Department of Justice asking that they pursue
charges against those responsible for past mismanagement, possible fraud and
other legal violations and to hold them fully
accountable.
We must better utilize the vacant and boarded up property and get
these costs dramatically reduced for taxpayers and expand affordable
housing in our community.
I intend to ensure that we stop public
waste of hard-earned taxpayer money in public housing.

With my regards and
best wishes, I remain

respectfully,
