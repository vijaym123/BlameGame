Dear Friends:
This week, with Congress back in session in Washington, I wanted to make sure you knew about some of the work Im doing on your behalf.
One issue, in particular, is really important
Medicare Advantage (MA).
This program is so important to 15 million seniors across the country and more than 300,000 right here in Georgia.
Every day, they rely on MA for their health care needs.
Unfortunately, as with years in the past, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is proposing dangerous cuts that would jeopardize the benefits of our seniors right here in the 12th District.
Ive fought back against these cuts each time theyre proposed, and this year is no different.
Just this month, I joined my Republican colleague Congressman Bill Cassidy (R-La.) in working to prevent these cuts.
Together,
we built a coalition of more than 200 Republicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives
who are ready to stand up against CMS and protect these benefits.
The benefits this program provides to our seniors are too important.
Even more impressive, folks who use MA spend less time in the hospital because the program focuses on prevention and disease management, ultimately reducing their health care costs.
Rep. Barrow speaks about Medicare Advantage
These cuts mean a lot to our seniors whove worked their entire lives.
The proposed 5.9 percent cut could mean a reduction in benefits and increase in premiums.
I know we have serious financial problems in this country, but putting the burden of addressing those problems on the backs of our seniors is not the answer.
I spoke out on the House floor today about the need for us to protect this program, and Ill continue to work with my colleagues to make sure CMS takes our advice.
If you have any concerns about this or any other issue, please dont hesitate to contact me.
Im always happy to help and make sure folks in Washington dont make life any harder on you.
Sincerely,
John Barrow
Member of Congress
