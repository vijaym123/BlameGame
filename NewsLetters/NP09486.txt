Dear Friend,
This week the House of Representatives took serious steps in cracking
down on human trafficking by passing a package of bills aimed at
boosting resources for law enforcement and supporting victims. Read more
about the legislation here
.
With the recent abduction of 276 Nigerian girls by Boko Haram, the human
trafficking issue has garnered international attention. Sadly, it is not
an isolated case. On National Review
, Penny Nance and I wrote about a real War on Women: the rise of
jihadists worldwide who use violence and abuse of women and children to
perpetuate a radical ideology.
Energy Independence
I recently had the opportunity to visit southeast Louisiana with some of
my House colleagues on the 2014 Offshore Energy Tour, led by Congressman
Steve Scalise, R-La. While there we saw only a small view into an
overwhelmingly positive trend across America: the increase of
private-sector domestic energy production to create jobs and economic
growth.
It is no coincidence that the three cities with the lowest unemployment
rate in the country - Midland, Texas; Bismarck, N.D.; and Houma-Bayou
Cane-Thibodaux, La. - all have close ties to the energy industry.
In my op-ed on Investor's Business Daily
, I make
the case for an all-of-the-above energy policy so more Americans can
benefit from this impressive, pro-growth industry.
Foster Care, Cooking, Crafts, and More!
On Monday, I joined the hosts of Hallmark Channel's "Home & Family"
to talk about Foster Care Month, show off my napkin folding skills,
make my favorite apple pancakes (recipe posted here
),
and much more. I had such a great time with Mark Steines, Cristina
Ferrare and the rest of the crew at Hallmark. For more recipes, crafts,
and behind the scenes pictures, follow me on Pinterest
and Instagram
