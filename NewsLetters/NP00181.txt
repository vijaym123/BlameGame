Dear Friend:
Federal investments can help area businesses grow and create local jobs. I&#39;m working in Congress to protect funding for programs that fuel the Lower Hudson Valley&#39;s economic engines and to improve the quality of life in our region&#58;
&#8226;
Creating jobs in Pearl River
with smart federal investments
&#8226;
Strengthening
Social Security
&#8226;
Celebrating the
Equal Pay Act 52nd Anniversary
&#8226;
Supporting local Girl Scouts
and their service&#45;oriented mission
&#8226;

Creating jobs through smart federal investments
Smart federal investments result in local economic benefit. I was proud to recently
announce
a U.S. Food and Drug Administration &#40;FDA&#41; decision to grant a commercial manufacturing license for Protein Sciences&#39; Pearl River facility to produce Flublok influenza vaccine. FDA&#39;s approval not only enhances our ability to help families stay healthy during flu season&#44; the facility in Pearl River plans to hire upward of 70 new employees to support production&#44; which will ramp up this year. As Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee&#44; I worked to protect funding for programs that facilitated this groundbreaking flu vaccine&#44; and I will continue to fund critical priorities that safeguard public health and support engines of economic growth in Lower Hudson Valley.
I joined Protein Sciences Corporation&#39;s Dan Adams and Mireli Fino&#44; Rockland Business Association&#39;s Roger Scheiber&#44; and Rockland Economic Development Corporation&#39;s Michael DiTullo in Pearl River&#44; NY&#44; to announce FDA&#39;s decision to grant a commercial manufacturing license for Protein Sciences&#39; Pearl River facility to produce Flublok influenza vaccine.
Strengthening Social Security
For nearly 80 years&#44; Social Security has provided financial stability and retirement security to millions of Americans after a lifetime of hard work. However&#44; for many Americans&#44; Social Security has not improved to meet their needs&#44; including those who count on Social Security after the death of a loved one or due to their own physical disability. That&#39;s why I recently introduced legislation that would provide full benefits to disabled widows and widowers without regard to age&#44; allow widows and widowers to increase their benefits with delayed retirement based on their own workforce contributions&#44; repeal the seven&#45;year restriction for widows and widowers to receive disability&#44; and eliminate the two&#45;year waiting period for divorced spouses to receive benefits. I will continue working to strengthen Social Security&#44; protect benefits&#44; and ensure that seniors receive the retirement security they have earned.
Supporting local Girl Scouts and their service&#45;oriented mission
I was honored to join Girl Scouts Heart of the Hudson for their Operation Cookie Drop in Valhalla&#44; NY. At this event&#44; scouts send donated cookies to troops overseas&#44; in hospitals&#44; and in veterans homes. Last year alone&#44; more than 90&#44;000 boxes of cookies were donated. The Girl Scouts instills an important sense of service and leadership in our young girls so they can grow up to be strong women&#44; and I will continue to support local organizations whose missions seek to improve quality of life here in the Lower Hudson Valley and beyond.
I attended the Girl Scouts Heart of the Hudson Operation Cookie Drop in Valhalla&#44; NY.
Celebrating the Equal Pay Act 52nd Anniversary
I recently joined Americans across the country to celebrate the 52nd Anniversary of the Equal Pay Act&#44; which requires that men and women in the same workplace be given equal pay for equal work. Unfortunately&#44; 52 years later&#44; New York women are working hard in the same jobs for the same hours as men&#44; but are paid 86 cents on average for every dollar paid to their male coworkers. That&#39;s why I cosponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act in the House of Representatives to give real teeth to the Equal Pay Act. I will continue working as Ranking Member on the House Appropriations Committee to close the gender wage gap.
Helping a Chappaqua resident with a federal agency
A Chappaqua doctor contacted me because he was unable to submit an electronic application for a Medicare doctors&#39; incentive program due to a glitch in the system. He missed the deadline&#44; and Medicare told him nothing could be done. I contacted Medicare on his behalf and the agency conceded it had erred and accepted the application. If you are experiencing issues with a federal agency&#44; please contact my White Plains district office &#40;914&#45;428&#45;1707&#41;&#44; my New City district office &#40;845&#45;639&#45;3485&#41;&#44; or my website for help&#58; http://lowey.house.gov/contact-nita/.
