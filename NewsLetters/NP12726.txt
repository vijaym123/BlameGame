A Minute with Mike - January eNewsletter
Dear Friend,
We are one month into the current session of the 113th Congress, and
quite a bit has happened in Washington. It is with a great respect, but
a tinge of sadness, that we bid farewell to two prolific members of the
California delegation, Reps. George Miller and Henry Waxman. They have
left a legacy of fighting for policies that help all Americans achieve
their dreams, and I am proud to have counted them as colleagues. At the
same time, we have experienced a resurgence of bipartisanship in
Washington, at least temporarily. The House has passed a budget and
resumed the regular Appropriations process. As a senior member of the
Appropriations Committee, I am proud of the agreement we crafted. While
this bill does not give us everything we want, I'm glad we were able to
increase funding for important projects in transportation, technology,
veterans' health care and benefits, and education. These are important
for the future of Silicon Valley's innovation economy.
If you have not had the opportunity yet, please visit my website to
read my "2013 Year in Review
." Available for free on the iBooks
store or on Scribd, this document chronicles my work on behalf of the
residents of Santa Clara and Alameda Counties in the past year.
Again, thank you for your interest in the issues that matter to our
Congressional district. It is an honor representing you.
Sincerely,
Mike Honda
Member of Congress

Anti-Human Trafficking
Speaking at an Anti-Human Trafficking Training at San Jose Airport
January was Human Trafficking Awareness Month. Human trafficking is
nothing more than modern-day slavery, preying on the most vulnerable.
That is why I was proud to take part in an Anti-Human Trafficking
Training at San Jose Airport, which brought together local and national
law enforcement officials to teach transportation workers how to
recognize signs of trafficking. To combat this problem, I strongly
supported the bipartisan Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization
Act, which was included in the 2013 Violence Against Women Act. I will
continue fighting for the victims without a voice.

State of the Union
Last month, the President's State of the Union Address touched on many
issues that have been important to me since my first days in politics,
including overcoming income inequality, promoting early education,
enacting immigration reform, ensuring retirement security, and
promoting a 21st century economy through advanced manufacturing. We
finally have a President who knows that income inequality is real, and
knows the damage that it does to our economy and our families. With a
higher minimum wage, an extension of unemployment benefits, and
protection for the long-term unemployed against hiring discrimination,
Americans who need our help can take steps to get back on their feet.
It is time for the Republican leadership in Congress to let us do our
job, so we can do as the President asked and put bills on his desk that
he can sign.

Indian Republic Day
Meeting Consul General of India-San Francisco Shri N. Parthasarathi
I was honored to join the Consul General of India-San Francisco Shri N.
Parthasarathi, Congressman Ami Bera, Milpitas Mayor Jose Estevez, and
members of the Bay Area Indian American Community at the Celebration of
India's Republic Day in Milpitas. The friendship and partnership
between India and the US is indispensable. Representing ??CA-17?, I
have seen firsthand the vibrancy of Indian culture, the energy of
Indian American youth, and the strength and resilience of this
community. As the nation of India, and Indians around the world, marked
this joyous occasion, I joined in honoring Mahatma Gandhi and the
heroes of India, who proved that great change can be achieved through
nonviolent means.???

BART Berryessa Extension
Touring the BART Berryessa extension project with VTA general manager
Nuria Fernandez
I was pleased to tour key construction sites on the BART extension to
Berryessa and Milpitas with one of the crew and the new general manager
of VTA, Nuria Fernandez. Recently, I helped secure $150 million for the
next year of work on this project, which will alleviate traffic
congestion and enhance connectivity throughout the region. Thousands of
direct and indirect jobs are being created, and for every dollar spent
on construction and operations and maintenance, $4-$10 is invested in
our local economy.

41st Anniversary of Roe v. Wade
Standing up for a woman's right to choose
January marked the 41st anniversary of the landmark Roe v. Wade Supreme
Court ruling. For the past 41 years, this decision has protected women's
reproductive rights and saved women's lives. 41 years later, however,
we are still fighting to protect the right to choose. In Congress and
state legislatures across the country, Republicans are introducing an
unprecedented number of bills to remove women's right to choose, or
prevent their access to critical health care services.
As a feminist and father to my daughter, I am committed to protecting
and advancing women's rights. I will continue to fight to safeguard the
rights of all women, support programs that educate women on safe and
effective practices, and expand responsible sex education in schools.
Back to top
STEM Advisory Council Meeting
On January 22nd, I led a meeting of my STEM Advisory Council. This
Council builds relationships between educators, policymakers, and
industry leaders to provide a framework to improve STEM programming
locally and nationally; brings experts from the administration, and
national organizations to the Bay Area; and showcases local and
national STEM programs to help facilitate the sharing of resources and
uncover ways that tech industry leaders and government can support each
other's efforts. We continued the discussion about how, together, we
can leverage the innovation of Silicon Valley to empower teachers and
improve education for every child. I look forward to continuing our
work, and using our findings as a template for future policy actions.
Back to top
Korean American Day
I was glad to recognize Korean American Day with my colleagues. On
Korean American Day, we come together to celebrate the culture,
heritage and contributions of Korean Americans to our nation. I
continue to be inspired by the vibrant community of more than 16,000
Koreans and Korean Americans in CA-17.
One hundred and eleven years ago, the first Korean immigrants entered
the United States. Since their arrival, the Korean American community
has enriched our nation's society, culture, economy and arts in many
ways. The first Asian American to win an Olympic gold medal for the
U.S., and the first male diver to win back-to-back diving gold medals
was Korean American. Korean Americans served with distinction in the
U.S. Armed Forces during World Wars I and II, and the Korean Conflict.
They are making invaluable strides in entrepreneurship and medicine.
They help build the ties between U.S. and South Korea. Today, nearly 2
million Korean Americans contribute to the fabric and story of America.
I will continue the fight for equality and justice in Congress,
advocating for the rights of Korean Americans, and all Americans.

Legislative Work
Supporting Community Schools
In January, I introduced the Supporting Community Schools Act (H.R.
3873), which allows districts to use the Community Schools model in
education reform.
The Community School is a school improvement model that is effectively
transforming low performing schools across the country by improving
school readiness; parent involvement; academic support and success;
students' physical, social, and emotional well-being; and community
engagement. This model reflects the belief that we need to educate the
whole child and create communities where students, their families, and
their schools thrive.
The Supporting Community Schools Act creates a fifth option for schools
that are falling below national standards, as set by the Elementary and
Secondary Education Act. The Community Schools model encourages
involvement by every member of a community, including educators,
non-profit organizations, social service agencies, and State and
Federal governments.
Back to top
Farm Bill
I'm glad that the Farm Bill Conference Committee returned the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (?SNAP?), also known as food
stamps, to the Farm Bill. I do not, however, support the cutting of
more than $8 billion from the funding of the SNAP program, which is why
I opposed the Farm Bill conference report and voted 'nay' on this bill.
These cuts caused the elimination of food stamp benefits for 1.7
million people in 850,000 households across the country, at a time when
our nation's food bank and charity networks are already at their
breaking points. These cuts come directly after a cut of $5 billion in
SNAP last November, and more than $11 billion of cuts over the last
three years. I will continue to work to improve access to quality
nutrition for those who need it the most.???

State
of
the
Union
Last
month,
the
President&#8217;s
State
of
the
Union
Address
touched
on
many
issues
that
have
been
important
to
me
since
my
first
days
in
politics,
including
overcoming
income
inequality,
promoting
early
education,
enacting
immigration
reform,
ensuring
retirement
security,
and
promoting
a
21st
century
economy
through
advanced

We
finally
have
a
President
who
knows
that
income
inequality
is
real,
and
knows
the
damage
that
it
does
to
our
economy
and
our
families.
With
a
higher
minimum
wage,
an
extension
of
unemployment
benefits,
and
protection
for
the
long-term
unemployed
against
hiring
discrimination,
Americans
who
need
our
help
can
take
steps
to
get
back
on
their
feet.
It
is
time
for
the
Republican
leadership
in
Congress
to
let
us
do
our
job,
so
we
can
do
as
the
President
asked
and
put
bills
on
his
desk
that
he

Korean
American
Day
I
was
glad
to
recognize
Korean
American
Day
with
my
colleagues.
On
Korean
American
Day,
we
come
together
to
celebrate
the
culture,
heritage
and
contributions
of
Korean
Americans
to
our
nation.
I
continue
to
be
inspired
by
the
vibrant
community
of
more
than
16,000
Koreans
and
Korean
Americans
in
CA-17.
One
hundred
and
eleven
years
ago,
the
first
Korean
immigrants
entered
the
United
States.
Since
their
arrival,
the
Korean
American
community
has
enriched
our
nation&#8217;s
society,
culture,
economy
and
arts
in
many
ways.
The
first
Asian
American
to
win
an
Olympic
gold
medal
for
the
U.S.,
and
the
first
male
diver
to
win
back-to-back
diving
gold
medals
was
Korean
American.
Korean
Americans
served
with
distinction
in
the
U.S.
Armed
Forces
during
World
Wars
I
and
II,
and
the
Korean
Conflict.
They
are
making
invaluable
strides
in
entrepreneurship
and
medicine.
They
help
build
the
ties
between
U.S.
and
South
Korea.
Today,
nearly
2
million
Korean
Americans
contribute
to
the
fabric
and
story
of
America.
I
will
continue
the
fight
for
equality
and
justice
in
Congress,
advocating
for
the
rights
of
Korean
Americans,
and
all
Americans.

Legislative
Work
Supporting
Community
Schools
In
January,
I
introduced
the
Supporting
Community
Schools
Act
(H.R.
3873),
which
allows
districts
to
use
the
Community
Schools
model
in
education
reform.
The
Community
School
is
a
school
improvement
model
that
is
effectively
transforming
low
performing
schools
across
the
country
by
improving
school
readiness;
parent
involvement;
academic
support
and
success;
students&#8217;
physical,
social,
and
emotional
well-being;
and
community
engagement.
This
model
reflects
the
belief
that
we
need
to
educate
the
whole
child
and
create
communities
where
students,
their
families,
and
their
schools
thrive.
The
Supporting
Community
Schools
Act
creates
a
fifth
option
for
schools
that
are
falling
below
national
standards,
as
set
by
the
Elementary
and
Secondary
Education
Act.
The
Community
Schools
model
encourages
involvement
by
every
member
of
a
community,
including
educators,
non-profit
organizations,
social
service
agencies,
and
State
and
Federal
governments.

Farm
Bill
I&#8217;m
glad
that
the
Farm
Bill
Conference
Committee
returned
the
Supplemental
Nutrition
Assistance
Program
(&#8234;SNAP&#8236;),
also
known
as
food
stamps,
to
the
Farm
Bill.
I
do
not,
however,
support
the
cutting
of
more
than
$8
billion
from
the
funding
of
the
SNAP
program,
which
is
why
I
opposed
the
Farm
Bill
conference
report
and
voted
'nay'
on
this
bill.
These
cuts
caused
the
elimination
of
food
stamp
benefits
for
1.7
million
people
in
850,000
households
across
the
country,
at
a
time
when
our
nation&#8217;s
food
bank
and
charity
networks
are
already
at
their
breaking
points.
These
cuts
come
directly
after
a
cut
of
$5
billion
in
SNAP
last
November,
and
more
than
$11
billion
of
cuts
over
the
last
three
years.
I
will
continue
to
work
to
improve
access
to
quality
nutrition
for
those
who
need
it
the
most.&#8236;&#8236;&#8236;
