Dear Friend,
We&rsquo;ve seen real progress for our LGBT neighbors in recent years -- the end of DOMA, the end of &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Ask, Don&rsquo;t Tell,&rdquo; and the right to marry in state after state. Yet in 29 states, it is still legal to be fired on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.
That&rsquo;s unacceptable, and the Senate has passed the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, (ENDA) to ban employment discrimination. But the Republican-controlled House refuses to take up the Senate bill. With your help, we can change that. We&rsquo;re gathering signatures to demand that the House pass ENDA -- add your name to our petition.
LGBT people are our neighbors, our friends, our family, and our loved ones. In America, everyone should be treated equally under the law - that's the essence of our democracy. And no one should be afraid of being fired from their jobs because of who they are or whom they love.
I&rsquo;ve been a longtime advocate for the LGBT community. I was one of only a handful of members of Congress to vote against the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996 and have supported an end to workplace discrimination since 1994. Now, the Senate has spoken, passing ENDA with 64 votes and bipartisan support. The House must act to end workplace discrimination. Sign our petition and tell the House to stop standing in the way of progress.
Thank you for your help, and for supporting LGBT Americans.
