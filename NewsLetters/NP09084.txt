Dear Friend,
On Monday the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a 645-page
proposed rule to regulate greenhouse gas emissions on existing power
plants. This EPA regulation would mandate that the country's power
plants collectively reduce by 30 percent below 2005 levels their
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.
This proposed rule could have a serious economic impact on Texas. Under
the plan, Texas will have three years to cut the carbon footprint of
its power plants by 39 percent, which will be a costly process. The
rule primarily affects CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants.
Texas is the fifth largest producer of coal in the nation and six of
Texas' 10 largest power plants are coal-fired. My concern is that Texas
consumers will see their energy prices increase because of this climate
change regulation.
That is why in May I joined with 29 of my colleagues from the Texas
Congressional delegation, both Republicans and Democrats, in writing a
letter to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy expressing our shared
concerns with this proposed regulation.
In our letter to Administrator McCarthy we made the point that Texas
leads the nation in population growth and electricity demand. With a
robust manufacturing base -- and as the leading producer of oil, gas,
and petrochemical -- our state is an economic engine for the nation.
Given such growth and potential, we believe the EPA should recognize
that Texans require an all-of-the-above approach to power generation,
not one that will raise the cost of electricity by selectively
targeting certain types of fossil fuels.
Additionally, the EPA has circumvented Congress during this rule-making
process illustrating another example of executive branch overreach by
the current Administration. Members from both sides of the aisle agree
that major changes to environmental policy should be dealt with through
the legislative process, not an unelected bureaucracy in Washington.
Sincerely,
Kay Granger
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
On
Monday
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(EPA)
released
a
645-page
proposed
rule
to
regulate
greenhouse
gas
emissions
on
existing
power
plants.
This
EPA
regulation
would
mandate
that
the
country&#8217;s
power
plants
collectively
reduce
by
30
percent
below
2005
levels their
greenhouse
gas
emissions
by
2030.
This
proposed
rule
could
have
a
serious
economic
impact
on
Texas.
Under
the
plan,
Texas
will
have
three
years
to
cut
the
carbon
footprint
of
its
power
plants
by
39
percent,
which
will
be
a
costly
process.
The
rule
primarily
affects
CO2
emissions
from
coal-fired
power
plants.
Texas
is
the
fifth
largest
producer
of
coal
in
the
nation
and
six
of
Texas&#8217;
10
largest
power
plants
are
coal-fired.
My
concern
is
that
Texas
consumers
will
see
their
energy
prices
increase
because
of
this
climate
change
regulation.
That
is
why
in
May
I
joined
with
29
of
my
colleagues
from
the
Texas
Congressional
delegation,
both
Republicans
and
Democrats,
in
writing
a
letter
to
EPA
Administrator
Gina
McCarthy
expressing
our
shared
concerns
with
this
proposed
regulation.
In
our
letter
to
Administrator
McCarthy
we
made
the
point
that
Texas
leads
the
nation
in
population
growth
and
electricity
demand.
With
a
robust
manufacturing
base
--
and
as
the
leading
producer
of
oil,
gas,
and
petrochemical
--
our
state
is
an
economic
engine
for
the
nation.
Given
such
growth
and
potential,
we
believe
the
EPA
should
recognize
that
Texans
require
an
all-of-the-above
approach
to
power
generation,
not
one
that
will
raise
the
cost
of
electricity
by
selectively targeting
certain
types
of
fossil
fuels.
Additionally,
the
EPA
has
circumvented
Congress
during
this
rule-making
process
illustrating
another
example
of
executive
branch
overreach
by
the
current
Administration.
Members
from
both
sides
of
the
aisle
agree
that
major
changes
to
environmental
policy
should
be
dealt
with
through
the
legislative
process,
not
an
unelected
bureaucracy
in
Washington.

Kay
