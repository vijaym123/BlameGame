Friend
Do the names Amy and Vicky ring a bell? They are the victims of two of the most widely-distributed child pornography series in the world. When Amys case was reviewed by the Supreme Court in
Paroline v. United States
last year, it highlighted the need to reform the existing restitution statute in child sexual exploitation cases. Currently, the restitution statute doesnt adequately accommodate child pornography cases, where the harm to the victim can sometimes be more difficult to quantify
although no less real
than other sexual exploitation cases.
The Amy and Vicky Child Pornography Victim Restitution Improvement Act ( H.R. 595 ), which I am cosponsoring, helps to fix that problem. It changes the restitution statute to consider the total harm to the victim, and requires real and timely restitution.
The fact that this is an issue
and that some of the most vulnerable members of our society are so exploited
breaks my heart. Our children are precious and deserve our protection. I will continue fighting for their safety.
Yours in service,
Randy
