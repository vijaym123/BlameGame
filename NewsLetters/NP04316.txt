Dear Friend,
Last week, in what can only be described as a watershed moment in the fight for net neutrality, President Obama threw his support behind the free and open Internet.
I&rsquo;m thrilled that President Obama has joined the millions of Americans who&rsquo;ve spoken out in favor of net neutrality. Now, we need to finish what we&rsquo;ve started. Net neutrality is essential to a free, fair, and open Internet -- join me in supporting net neutrality.
This summer, I led a dozen of my colleagues in calling on the FCC to reclassify broadband as a telecommunications service. This change would put net neutrality on firm legal footing and give the FCC the power to prevent Internet service providers from setting up fast and slow lanes online. The President is on board with that proposal, as are hundreds of thousands of our fellow netizens -- but our work isn&rsquo;t done yet.
The Internet has become the world&rsquo;s most democratic medium because of net neutrality -- killing net neutrality would kill the golden goose that gave rise to innovative companies like Google, Hulu, and Facebook.
Sign our petition and help us keep the Internet a level playing field for all.
Thank you so much for your support on this. Net neutrality has been an important part of my work for years, and I&rsquo;m happy we&rsquo;re this close to a major victory. Let&rsquo;s get the job done.
Thank you.
