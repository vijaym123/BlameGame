Friend -
Have you ever wanted to keep your cell phone, but simply switch wireless carriers?
It seems like common sense, but until recently, it wasnt allowed.
Thats why I supported the Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act,
S.517 , to permit consumers to unlock their cell phones without the approval of their wireless provider.
Im pleased to tell you that the bill was signed into law by the President on August 1 st .
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.
