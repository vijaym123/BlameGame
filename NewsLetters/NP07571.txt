LEGISLATION
Dear David,
Creating Jobs in
Florida
This week,
the House passed my bill, H.R. 4450
the Travel Promotion,
Enhancement, and Modernization Act by a staggering bipartisan vote of 347
57.
Should this bill pass the Senate and be signed into law, it will
create jobs in Florida and across the country.I also hosted a briefing
highlighting the work of military dogs that serve alongside our brave men
and woman in the Armed Forces. Finally, I want to hear from you
answer the question at the bottom and
tell me what issue matters
most to you.
Brand USA
Tourism is an integral part of our economy
especially in
Florida. Increased tourism means more American and Floridian jobs. My
legislation means job growth without utilizing a dime of taxpayer
dollars. Millions of Americans across the country are still struggling, and
H.R. 4450 will help them get back to work. Brand USA reauthorization
is a jobs bill.
I am
proud that my colleagues have joined me in a bipartisan effort to pass
H.R. 4450 by an overwhelming vote of 347-57 in the House of
Representatives, continuing the Houses track record of passing meaningful,
impactful bills to help Americans across the country. It is my hope the
Senate will pass the companion bill
S. 2250
without
delay.

Rep. Bilirakis hosts a briefing to
discuss the importance of reuniting dogs that have served in Iraq or
Afghanistan with their human handlers
This week I hosted a briefing about some very special
heroes
the military dogs who keep our nation safe, and serve
alongside our service men and women
as well as their heroic
handlers.
The American Humane
Association is the countrys first humane organization, and they have been
heavily involved in bringing home and reuniting these remarkable
four-legged heroes with service members.
A bomb sniffing dog can save as many as 150 lives; many of
those are the lives of our women and men in the Armed Forces. These
dogs continue to provide benefits on the home front, like helping
Veterans who suffer from PTS.
