Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
This past week began with Veterans Day, and I had the privilege of honoring the men and women who have faithfully served and sacrificed for our country. On Monday morning, I walked in the Mount Dora Christian Home &amp; Bible Veterans Parade. I also was the keynote speaker at the Lake Alfred/Auburndale Veterans Day ceremony. At that event I presented a flag, flown over the US Capitol, to the Mayor of Lake Alfred. It was an honor to publicly recognize and express gratitude for the services that our veterans have given to our country.

On Wednesday, I met with Dr. George Hagerty, the President of Beacon College in Leesburg, to discuss the colleges vision for educating students with learning disabilities, and hear an update on the growth and expansion of the college. Earlier this year, I had the privilege of touring their campus, meeting faculty and students, and seeing firsthand the positive impact that Beacon College is having on individual students with learning disabilities.

Every year, I have the privilege of nominating outstanding young men and women for acceptance into our nations military service academies. Our district has many incredible young people who desire the high calling of military service to our country, and it is a pleasure to encourage them in this honorable endeavor. I am grateful for the dedicated members of our selection committee who carefully interview each applicant and provide recommendations on potential nominees for the U.S. Military Academy, the U.S. Naval Academy, the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, the U.S. Air Force Academy and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. To learn more about the nomination application process, you can go to my website here .

On Friday night, Sandy and I attended the 6th Annual Lake Eustis Area Chamber of Commerce Community Service and Business Awards event. I enjoyed talking with former NBA player Pat Burke again, and was honored to receive the Chambers Leadership Award for providing guidance and leadership that has impacted Lake County.
It is a pleasure serving you in Congress, and I was humbled by the presentation of this award.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Recently, a constituent from Winter Garden called concerning a problem she was experiencing with Social Security and the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS). Medicaid had her listed as a Qualified Medicare Beneficiary, and she believed that her Medicare payment should be covered by Medicaid and not deducted from her Social Security check. We contacted the Social Security Administration (SSA) and resolved the issue within a few days. The constituent expressed how grateful and relieved she was as a senior citizen to know that we cared and were so readily willing to look into her specific situation.
Share Your View:
Over the past few weeks, despite the President's repeated promises, millions of Americans have received cancellation notices of their current health insurance plans. Last week, President Obama tried to patch up this situation by postponing some of the regulations that Obamacare imposes on insurance companies.
Do you think this partial, temporary delay is sufficient?
Yes
No

Legislative Update:
Contrary to the Presidents repeated promises, millions of Americans have seen their health insurance plans cancelled due to Obamacare. Constituents all over Central Florida have shared their personal experiences about how these cancellations and exorbitant rate hikes have negatively affected their personal lives.
Last week, I supported a bill that will allow anyone who is currently satisfied with their health care plan, to keep it - just as the President promised. The Keep Your Health Plan Act of 2013 passed with a strong bipartisan vote, and I remain committed to protecting the freedom of individuals to keep their current health care plan.
