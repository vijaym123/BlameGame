Wisdom of the District: Iraq
In recent weeks, the world has witnessed the centuries-long sectarian conflict in Iraq escalate once again.
The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has advanced into Iraq moving toward the capital city of Baghdad, threatening to overthrow the al-Maliki government.
What
if any
do you think the United States next steps should be after securing the US embassy and ensuring the safety of American citizens in country?
( )
The President should put U.S. combat forces on the ground to push back the insurgent forces to protect American interests.
( )
The President should order U.S. air strikes against ISIS to support the Maliki-led Iraqi government.
( )
The United States should wait to act until it secures international partners who are willing to address the situation.
( )
It is too early to determine next steps militarily. We must wait for more intelligence from the ground in Iraq.
( )
The United States should have no role in this conflict. The Iraqis must stand on their own feet.
