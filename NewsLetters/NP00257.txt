A Weekly e-Newsletter from
Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA)
June 12, 2015
Dear Friends,
This week I made a personal announcement that I am in the early stages
of Parkinson's disease. My diagnosis has not impacted my ability to
represent the state of Georgia in the U.S. Senate.
I feel good, and I am facing this challenge
head on. I am busier and have more responsibility today than ever
before in my political career, and I couldn't be happier about that.
I felt it was important to share this news with you and to handle my
personal health challenge with the same transparency that I have
championed throughout my career. I remain devoted to public service, to
my state, to you and to all of my constituents
. I am eager to take my record of results
to the voters of Georgia as I run for re-election in 2016.
I have been overwhelmed, moved and more energized than ever by so many
of your positive and encouraging words this week. My wife Dianne and I
thank you.
Compensation to the American Victims of the Iran Hostage Crisis
I was thrilled this week by the unanimous passage of legislation that
would compensate the Americans who were held hostage in Iran for 444
days from 1979-1981
, out of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.
This been one of my top priorities as a public servant to see to it
that these Americans who were serving our country in Iran and were
forced to endure unimaginable fear, despair and torture receive overdue
compensation for their suffering and sacrifice. The Iran hostages
sacrificed mightily for our country, and I urge the Senate to swiftly
pass this legislation to demonstrate our support to the brave men and
women who represent our country abroad. Three of these former hostages
live in Georgia.
An End to South African Tariffs on American Poultry
Last Friday, after more than a year of negotiations, I was excited to
announce that an agreement was reached to end South Africa's tariffs on
U.S. poultry.
The agreement is welcome news for the
entire U.S. poultry industry, including the large poultry operations in
Georgia. American poultry products are expected to enter the South
African market before the end of 2015 after being blocked from that
market for the past 15 years. This is a huge win for our state!
Protecting our Sportsmen and the Environment
As a fisherman and one who seeks to preserve Georgia's outdoors for
recreation, I was pleased to co-sponsor the Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act
of 2015
. This legislation will protect and
strengthen opportunities for recreational hunting, fishing, and
shooting, while advancing efforts to conserve land and water.
Funding for Denver VA Hospital
Also this week, the Senate passed legislation that will allow the
construction of the new Department of Veterans' Affairs medical center
in Denver to continue.
The legislation authorizes the VA to use
$150 million in its existing fiscal year 2015 budget for the project
and avoid a looming shutdown on June 12, 2015.
This project is about making sure Colorado veterans get the care they
deserve. Congress has now done everything that it can to ensure the
continuation of this project, and it is now time for the VA and the
Obama administration to clean up the mess they've made with the
outrageous cost overruns on this project.
Providing Patient-Centered Care
On Thursday, Senator Mark R. Warner, D-Va., and I introduced The Care
Planning Act of 2015
, which would create a Medicare benefit for
patient-centered care planning for people with serious illness.
This legislation will provide individuals who have been diagnosed with
a serious or life-threatening illness and their loved ones an
opportunity to have face-to-face conversations with their doctors,
nurses and religious advisors to develop plan for care. I know from my
own experience with my parents that having a plan makes a world of
difference in ensuring a high quality of life during a loved one's last
days.
Come Visit D.C.
It was a pleasure to have so many visitors this week in my Washington,
D.C. office. I always enjoy
meeting with constituents, and I hope that
the next time you are in D.C. you will stop by, too
!
Open Office Day in Greene County
On June 29, 2015, my field representative Daniela Belton will hold an
open office day for Greene County and the surrounding area. Daniela
will be in the conference room of the Greene County Government Office,
1034 Silver Drive, Greensboro, Ga., 30642 from 11:00 a.m. until 1:00
p.m.
What's on Tap?
The Senate will continue consideration Fiscal Year 2016 Defense
Authorization Bill. This bill will provide a blueprint for defense
spending priorities to support our troops, and is critical to our
national security and our troops.
I hope everyone will take the time to wish the United States Military a
Happy 240th Birthday on June 14, 2015. I would like to express to our
brave soldiers and their dedicated families how very proud I am of
their loyalty and devotion to our country. May we never forget to be
grateful for the freedom made possible by our service members. On this
day and every day, may God bless our veterans and their families and
may God bless America!

2015
Dear
Friends,
This
week
I
made
a
personal
announcement
that
I
am
in
the
early
stages
of
Parkinson's
disease.
My
diagnosis
has
not
impacted
my
ability
to
represent
the
state
of
Georgia
in
the
U.S.
Senate.
I
feel
good,
and
I
am
facing
this
challenge
head
on.
I
am
busier
and
have
more
responsibility
today
than
ever
before
in
my
political
career,
and
I
couldn't
be
happier
about
that.
I
felt
it
was
important
to
share
this
news
with
you
and
to
handle
my
personal
health
challenge
with
the
same
transparency
that
I
have
championed
throughout
my
career.
I
remain
devoted
to
public
service,
to
my
state,
to
you
and
to
all
of
my
constituents .
I
am
eager
to
take
my
record
of
results
to
the
voters
of
Georgia
as
I
run
for
re-election
in
2016.
I
have
been
overwhelmed,
moved
and
more
energized
than
ever
by
so
many
of
your
positive
and
encouraging
words
this
week.
My
wife
Dianne
and
I
thank
you.
Compensation
to
the
American
Victims
of
the
Iran
Hostage
Crisis
I
was
thrilled
this
week
by
the
unanimous
passage
of
legislation
that
would
compensate
the
Americans
who
were
held
hostage
in
Iran
for
444
days
from
1979-1981 ,
out
of
the
Senate
Foreign
Relations
Committee.
This
been
one
of
my
top
priorities
as
a
public

to
see
to
it
that
these
Americans
who
were
serving
our
country
in
Iran
and
were
forced
to
endure
unimaginable

despair
and
torture
receive
overdue
compensation
for
their
suffering
and
sacrifice.
The
Iran
hostages
sacrificed
mightily
for
our
country,
and
I
urge
the
Senate
to
swiftly
pass
this
legislation
to
demonstrate
our
support
to
the
brave
men
and
women
who
represent
our
country
abroad.
Three
of
these
former
hostages
live
in
Georgia.
An
End
to
South
African
Tariffs
on
American
Poultry
Last
Friday,
after
more
than
a
year
of
negotiations,
I
was
excited
to
announce
that
an
agreement
was
reached
to
end
South
Africa's
tariffs
on
U.S.
poultry.
The
agreement
is
welcome
news
for
the
entire
U.S.
poultry
industry,
including
the
large
poultry
operations
in
Georgia.
American
poultry
products
are
expected
to
enter
the
South
African
market
before
the
end
of
2015
after
being
blocked
from
that
market
for
the
past
15
years.
This
is
a
huge
win
for
our
state!
Protecting
our
Sportsmen
and
the
Environment
As
a
fisherman
and
one
who
seeks
to
preserve
Georgia's
outdoors
for
recreation,
I
was
pleased
to
co-sponsor
the
Bipartisan
Sportsmen's
Act
of
2015 .
This
legislation
will
protect
and
strengthen
opportunities
for
recreational
hunting,
fishing,
and
shooting,
while
advancing
efforts
to
conserve
land
and
water.
Funding
for
Denver
VA
Hospital
Also
this
week,
the
Senate
passed
legislation
that
will
allow
the
construction
of
the
new
Department
of
Veterans'
Affairs
medical
center
in
Denver
to
continue.
The
legislation
authorizes
the
VA
to
use
$150
million
in
its
existing
fiscal
year
2015
budget
for
the
project
and
avoid
a
looming
shutdown
on
June
12,
2015.
This
project
is
about
making
sure
Colorado
veterans
get
the
care
they
deserve.
Congress
has
now
done
everything
that
it
can
to
ensure
the
continuation
of
this
project,
and
it
is
now
time
for
the
VA
and
the
Obama
administration
to
clean
up
the
mess
they've
made
with
the
outrageous
cost
overruns
on
this
project.
Providing
Patient-Centered
Care
On
Thursday,
Senator
Mark
R.
Warner,
D-Va.,
and
I
introduced
The
Care
Planning
Act
of
2015 ,
which
would
create
a
Medicare
benefit
for
patient-centered
care
planning
for
people
with
serious
illness.
This
legislation
will
provide
individuals
who
have
been
diagnosed
with
a
serious
or
life-threatening
illness
and
their
loved
ones
an
opportunity
to
have
face-to-face
conversations
with
their
doctors,
nurses
and
religious
advisors
to
develop
plan
for
care.
I
know
from
my
own
experience
with
my
parents
that
having
a
plan
makes
a
world
of
difference
in
ensuring
a
high
quality
of
life
during
a
loved
one's
last
days.
Come
