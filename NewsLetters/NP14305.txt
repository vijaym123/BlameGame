Congressman Andrews Announces Joint Base MDL Picked for New Energy
Venture
HADDON HEIGHTS, N.J. - Monday, Congressman Andrews announced that the
Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst has landed a new and exciting
opportunity to partner with private industry to produce a new energy
project that will help grow local jobs, generate revenue for the
federal government and help the military achieve its target of
decreasing its carbon footprint by 2025.
Three sites at the Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, a combined Army,
Air Force and Navy base, are being offered for development into energy
projects through an Enhanced Use Lease (EUL).
EULs are long-term
agreements between the Department of Defense and either public entities
or private developers to lease Federal land in exchange for cash or
in-kind services and can cover a broad range of development from
renewable and conventional energy to commercial use.
A group called
the Starwood Siemens team has been selected to evaluate several energy
sources that could be built at the Joint Base including a natural gas
plant, solar facilities and a bio-mass plant that would burn wood or
other material to produce usable electricity.
The electricity produced
from this project would be sold to the public as well as the military.
"An energy project of this magnitude could create hundreds of jobs and
be a boon to our local economy," said Congressman Andrews.
"Not only
would this project create jobs building and running the plant, but it
would also lower energy costs for South Jersey residents and make the
Joint Base more energy self-sufficient, which is a definite win-win."
As a member of the Armed Services Committee, Congressman Andrews is
committed to creating good jobs building the energy infrastructure
needed to put South Jersey on the course of long term economic growth
and energy independence. Nationwide, the Air Force has finalized eight
EUL projects worth more than $250 million in cash or services.
