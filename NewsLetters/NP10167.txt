News from Congressman Scott Peters
May 2, 2014
Dear Friend,
While Congress was out of session last month I took advantage of an
extended time in San Diego to visit local businesses and veterans
facilities, meet with constituents like you, and continue the dialogue
on how to get Congress functioning successfully again.
Supporting Military families
Often forgotten amidst discussions of military operations and
deployments are the spouses and children that our servicemembers leave
at home when they serve our country. Military families can be found in
every one of our communities. I recently learned that on average a
military child moves and changes school 6-9 times between Kindergarten
and High School graduation.
Visiting Serra HS in Tierrasanta with MCAS Miramar Commanding Officer
Col. John Farnam
I had the honor of talking with students at Serra High School in
Tierrasanta, many of whom come from military families, to hear their
perspectives. I also helped present grant funding to the San Diego
Unified School District to help get these students into more Advanced
Placement courses as they prepare for college.
Working with my Colleagues
For the first time in a long time, San Diego's entire Congressional
delegation is working together to promote our regional economic
interests. My four colleagues and I attended the San Diego Regional
Chamber of Commerce's annual forum to discuss our efforts to fund the
San Ysidro Port of Entry project
, which will expand the local
economy and reduce wait times.

Commerce forum
I also did an interview with former Mayor Jerry Sanders and Rep. Duncan
Hunter on NBC 7's 'Politically Speaking' about supporting our local
innovation economy and my fight to support scientific research funding
that is critical to local jobs and our national competitiveness. Click

Securing Constituent Medals
One of my constituents had been trying to get the military medals he
had been awarded but not yet received. After his tragic death, his wife
continued the effort and contacted my office for help. It was an honor
to present her, and her family, with the medals.
Funding Infrastructure and Fixing Potholes
Given the focus in San Diego on fixing our roads and filling the
potholes, it's no surprise that upgrading our nation's infrastructure
is necessary for growing the economy and creating jobs. I welcomed my
colleague Rep. John Delaney from Maryland to talk about our effort to
fund infrastructure programs
at no cost to taxpayers and the need
for comprehensive tax reform.

Improving Healthcare for our Veterans
Wireless technologies have the potential to change the way healthcare
is delivered for millions of Americans. Many San Diego companies are at
the forefront of developing these new devices and applications, which
will help deliver better and potentially less-costly care.
I visited the Aspire Center in Old Town that is working with veterans
in their rehabilitation efforts, including through the use of
telemedicine services.

In a stop on KUSI's morning show I discussed the Aspire Center and my
two pieces of legislation
aimed at increasing the use of
wireless technologies
in healthcare in Medicare, Tricare, and
the Veterans Administration.
Staying in Touch
I hope you'll stay connected with what I'm working on. Like my Facebook
page, follow me on Twitter, or visit my website for further information.
One of the most important jobs I have in Congress is providing a number
of constituent services. As always if you have any questions, are
having trouble with a federal agency, or want to weigh in on a
particular issue, feel free to email
or call either of my offices at
202-225-0508 or 858-455-5550.
