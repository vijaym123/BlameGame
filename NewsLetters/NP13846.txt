Dear Friend,
It is with a full heart that I wish you and your family a very Happy
Thanksgiving.
Today, we gather with our friends and families to rejoice in our
blessings and take time to reflect on the things and people that matter
most. Brian and I will be spending the day with our kids -- Cole,
Grace, and the newest addition to our family, Brynn Catherine
, our newborn baby girl. She has already filled
our days with boundless joy and reminded us that we have so much to be
thankful for this year.
As we come together with our loved ones, let us also take time to
remember our brave service members and their families. As Co-Chair of
the Military Family Caucus, I have seen firsthand the sacrifices
families make when someone close to them is not able to celebrate this
special holiday. Thank you to all the men and women in uniform who
serve and have served - without you, we would not be able to celebrate
today. Let us express our gratitude not just on Thanksgiving, but every
day.
Today let our hearts be filled with gratitude, hope and love for the
tremendous blessings in our lives - for, in the words of poet William
Wordsworth, "All that we behold is full of blessings."
May you and your family have a beautiful and blessed holiday.
Warm regards,
Cathy
