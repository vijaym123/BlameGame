Dear Friend,
On Saturday, it was great to be a part of Umatillas Cracker Christmas Parade as my family joined me to pass out candy and wish the North Lake community a merry Christmas. I also presented the Umatilla Womans Club with several copies of the Congressional Journal, in which I recognized their service.
The Umatilla Womans Club was founded in 1920 by a group of civic-minded women who established the first library in Umatilla. The group first organized informally, but recognizing the need for formal organization to better promote civic events, the Umatilla Womans Club became one of the original twelve Womans Clubs, which act as a unifying force to bring women together who will strengthen their local communities through volunteer service.
Howey-in-the-Hills and Groveland also held their Christmas parades on Saturday, and it was a pleasure to participate in both of these events. Sandy and I are grateful to be a part of Lake Countys Christmas festivities.

During my time in Washington, I had the opportunity to record a holiday video greeting for our troops overseas. Our brave men and women in the Armed Forces sacrifice so much to keep us safe and protect our freedoms, and I know that the holiday season is a difficult time for many of them and their families. It was an honor to thank them for their service and wish them a very merry Christmas.

Constituent Corner:
A few weeks ago, a constituent contacted my office requesting assistance in scheduling an appointment for his aunt in Colombia for a non-immigrant visa.
The constituents niece, who was also his aunts god-daughter, had her wedding planned for just before Thanksgiving and wanted to have her attend and participate.
Unfortunately, due to a miscommunication, the aunt had overstayed a previous non-immigrant visa over 10 years ago, and had been denied every visa application since that point. Our office reached out to the Embassy and followed up with the family multiple times as they worked through the visa process. Fortunately, we were happy to report to the family that the visa had been approved and issued.
During the aunts visit to the United States, the family stopped by the office to personally thank my staff that had been involved, and left a card from the aunt that said, Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Your help and support made my dream become a reality.
Words cannot express the appreciation I have for all of you who made this possible for me to attend my godchilds wedding.
God bless you all.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
The Senate Intelligence Committee released a report last week on the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) methods and process of gathering information following the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States. Do you believe the CIA's use of "enhanced interrogation methods" resulted in intelligence that ultimately kept Americans safer?
Yes
No

Legislative Update:
Last week, I voted against the spending package brought before the House of Representatives. The CRomnibus bill,
H.R. 83 , was over 1,600 pages long and was brought to the Floor with less than 48 hours allotted to read the actual text before voting on it.
A flawed process makes for a flawed product. While there were many good aspects of the spending bill, ultimately, the process used to craft the legislation resulted in something I could not support.
I am hopeful that the incoming Republican Majority in the Senate will prioritize passing appropriations bills more than the outgoing Democratic Majority did over the past four years, and that Congress will return to regular order.
