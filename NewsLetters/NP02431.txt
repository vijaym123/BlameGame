ICYMI: SCALISE ON FOX NEWS SUNDAY
Today, I appeared on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace to discussed how Republicans have acted to fund the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and fight the presidents illegal actions on immigration. We also discussed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming address before a joint session of Congress.

Below are some highlights from the interview.
On House Actions to Fund DHS
What we did is passed a bill that now forces the Senate to vote on going to conference. We actually passed a bill that pushes back on the president's illegal actions on immigration. [The Senate] made changes to that bill that we don't like, the way congress works when the House and Senate have a disagreement
you go to conference. So Monday the Senate will be taking that vote.
Let's go to conference and work out these differences and finally put a check on this president that he himself said 22 different times he doesn't have the authority to write his own immigration policies. We're going to keep fighting this battle.
I would urge Senate Democrats to stop blocking our actions, stand with the court, stand with the Constitution, and let's go enforce the rule of law.
On Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahus Address to a Joint Session of Congress
I welcome Prime Minister Netanyahu. I think it will be a critically important speech that not only people throughout America will be watching, I think people all throughout the world will be watching this because they understand the importance of the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran.
I'm prepared to continue doing what we need to do to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. There's strong bipartisan support in congress for increased sanctions against Iran.
It is an honor to represent you in Congress. For more information please visit my
