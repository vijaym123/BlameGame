Dear Friend,

continued interest and value this opportunity to share with you what
I'm doing in Washington and the 15th District. For more ways to stay in

Happy Easter!
All Are Welcome To Annual Congressional Prayer Breakfast April 28
It is appropriate that on this Easter Sunday, I remind everyone that
the 16th Annual Congressional Prayer Breakfast
will be held at Collinsville's
Gateway Center on Monday, April 28, beginning at 7:15 a.m. I am
co-hosting the event with Congressmen Rodney Davis (R, Illinois-13) and
Bill Enyart (D, Illinois-12).
This year's guest speaker is Steve Stipanovich, former All-American
basketball player for the University of Missouri and center for the
NBA's Indiana Pacers. Everyone is invited to share a morning of prayer,
good food, and reflection. For tickets or more information, call (618)
463-6850.
I participated in the ceremony marking a grant to Clark County first
responders at the home of the Marshall Fire Protection District
Tuesday.
Federal Grant Brings Life-Saving Defibrillators To Clark County
Sometimes the federal government gets in the way, but sometimes we do
it right. On Tuesday in Marshall, I helped celebrate one of those
positive times, the announcement of the awarding of 12 Automated
External Defibrillators (AEDs) to first responders in Clark County.
I was joined by representatives of Union Hospital and the Richard G.
Lugar Center for Rural Health in distributing a dozen AEDs to the Clark
County Sheriff's Department, the Casey Fire Protection District, the
Casey Police Department and the Clark County Park District.
The Lugar Center obtained a federal Rural Access to Emergency Devices
Grant
from the Office of Rural Health Policy,
Health Resources and Services Administration in the Department of
Health and Human Services. The grant will also be bringing AEDs to
Vermilion County in the near future.
As the sponsor of AED legislation,
I'm very excited to see their use
spread and make a difference in the 15th Congressional District.
FEMA Wants Americans To Be Prepared For The Next Disaster
With the frequency of disasters across the country increasing, the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is conducting America's
PrepareAthon! events each spring and fall. The next national day of
emergency preparedness action is April 30.
The focus for participants this spring will be to learn protective
actions, mitigation measures and emergency plans for a tornado,
hurricane, flood or wildfire. Go to www.ready.gov/prepare
to learn more about America's PrepareAthon!
District Work Period
My stops as I traversed the 15th Congressional District this past week
included Triad High School in Troy (above). I also joined Eastern
Illinois University President Bill Perry (center of picture at right)
for a tour led by James Gilbert (pointing) of the Renewable Energy
Center and the Center for Clean Energy Research and Education (CENCERE)
under construction at EIU in Charleston. In addition, I conducted Open
Office Hours in Greenville and traveled to Sullivan to speak to the
Rotary Club and at Sullivan High School.
