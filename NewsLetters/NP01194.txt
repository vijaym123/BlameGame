The reluctance by many in Washington to reign in federal spending and get our debt under control is extremely troubling.
One of my top priorities as your Congressman has been to stop the endless spending, taxing, and borrowing by those who support big government. To stop the culture of wasteful spending, we must fight tirelessly for systemic change to the way that Washington operates, said Schweikert.
We need to get our federal budget balanced and stop crippling future generations with insurmountable debt.
We can balance the federal budget and stop the borrowing, but we must be committed to making tough decision that reform Washington.
Congressman Schweikert and the District Office Staff will host a public Budget Presentation on Monday, May 4, 2015 at the Mustang Library in Scottsdale at 10101 North 90th Street, Scottsdale, Arizona 85258. The Congressman will present the current state of the national economy and share pending budget measures.
