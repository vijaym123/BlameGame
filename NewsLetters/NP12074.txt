ICYMI: Heller Speaks at Joint Hearing
for Disabled Veterans, Presses Shinseki on
Nevada Veterans' Issues
(Washington, D.C.)
U.S.
Senator Dean Heller (R-NV), member of the
Senate Committee on Veterans
Affairs, yesterday delivered remarks during
a joint hearing to receive the Disabled
American Veterans 2014 legislative
presentation.
In a meeting with the U.S. Department of
Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki
this afternoon, Heller spoke with the
Secretary about a number of issues,
including the need to address the veterans
claims backlog.
It was an honor to speak with
members of the Disabled American Veterans
at todays joint hearing. What they
have given for their country can never be
fully repaid. The least we can do is make
sure they are afforded the very best
treatment our nation can provide,
said Senator Dean Heller .
Following the hearing, I had the
privilege of sitting down with VA Secretary
Shinseki to discuss the upcoming year for
the more than 300,000 Nevada veterans. Our
discussion centered on the inexcusable
backlog of claims and the priorities within
the VAs budget. The bottom line is
gridlock in Washington must never impede
helping our veterans receive the benefits
they earned in service to this country. As
I continue my work on the Senate
Veterans Affairs Committee, I look
forward to working with Secretary Shinseki
to ensure that all heroes are taken care
of.
