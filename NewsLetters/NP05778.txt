URGENT: 4-WEEK AD BUY DEADLINE
With the election in just over 4 weeks, we&rsquo;re facing one of our last critical fundraising deadlines. Control of Congress is at stake.
We just received some great news:
NEW POLL: DEMOCRATS 45% - REPUBLICANS 44%
Yes, you&rsquo;re reading that right -- Democrats are UP by 1 point. That means we can shock the world and deliver a devastating defeat to Boehner! But first, we have a serious problem to fix.
Republican outside groups and SuperPACs are working day and night to derail our victory. And this week, they&rsquo;re on track to MASSIVELY outspend us.
David, we need to act now, or we will have no way to respond to Koch-fueled attacks. That is why we NEED to hit 25,OOO donations before tomorrow&rsquo;s critical ad buy deadline. That means we only have
24 hours.
David Johnson Suggested Support: $5.OO
Control of Congress is at stake. Will you chip in whatever you can today? Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Polls like this are inspiring, but we want to be crystal-clear about the race: it&rsquo;s still a toss-up. All it takes is one GIGANTIC wave of Republican attacks from outside groups to tilt the balance in their favor.
We need to take advantage of the opportunity we have now. That means falling short on this ad buy deadline is NOT an option.
Please -- help us stop Republicans from buying this election with their secret right-wing money.
We need 13 donations from 60659 zip code
