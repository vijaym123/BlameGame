Dear Friends,
Last week I voted in favor of the Ryan Budget
. It was a vote to get
America's fiscal house in order. With our current debt sitting at 17.5
trillion dollars, we must take the necessary steps to pay down this
debt and chart a new course for America. The health of our economy and
our national security depends on getting ourselves out from under this
crushing debt burden.
This budget will:
Make needed spending cuts ($5.1 trillion) that begin to put us
on a path to paying off our exploding 17 trillion dollar debt.
Reduce public debt from 73% of the GDP in 2015 to 56% of the GDP
by 2024.
Implement pro-growth tax and regulatory reforms that will help
our economy grow.
Strengthen the safety net for current and future generations. If
we do nothing, the safety nets that so many Americans depend on - due
to the under performing Obama recovery -
today will simply not be
there tomorrow.The Republican House has passed over a dozen jobs bills
that would grow our economy. However, Harry Reid refuses to bring them
up making our economy and the American people suffer.
Strengthen Medicare. It makes no changes for those in or near
retirement. For future generations, it will offer them a range of plans-
including traditional Medicare-from which they can choose. No senior
can be denied coverage. Every senior will have the support they need to
get the care they deserve.
Repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and clear the way for a
more patient-centered alternative.
You can have your own opinion about this budget proposal, but the
fiscal numbers we are facing do not lie. Is this plan perfect? No. No
plan is perfect, but it is a solid plan that deals with very serious
issues facing our country.
I agree with the words of Chairman Ryan during floor debate, "We've
offered a budget because we trust the American people. Unlike the
Senate Democrats who have once again punted and not even offered a
budget this year, we trust the people to make an honest assessment. We
trust them to make the right choice for their future.. You can boil the
differences down to one question: Who knows better? The people or
Washington? We have made our choice with this budget. I trust the
American people to make theirs."
I have an obligation to the people I represent, to be honest about our
current state of affairs and to vote for solutions that will remedy the
problems we face. I love America, as do all of you, and I want to see
her strong.
Thank you for taking the time to read this newsletter. I look forward
to speaking with you next week.
Sincerely,
Ted

From
The
Desk
Of
Congressman
Yoho
Dear
Friends,
Last
week
I
voted
in
favor
of
the
Ryan
Budget .
It
was
a
vote
to get
America&#8217;s
fiscal
house
in
order. With
our
current
debt
sitting
at
17.5
trillion
dollars,
we
must
take
the
necessary
steps
to
pay
down
this
debt
and
chart
a
new
course
for
America.
The
health
of
our
economy
and
our
national
security
depends
on
getting
ourselves
out
from
under
this
crushing
debt
burden.
This
budget
will:
&#183;
Make
needed
spending
cuts
($5.1
trillion)
that
begin
to
put
us
on
a
path
to
paying
off
our
exploding
17
trillion
dollar
debt.
&#183;
Reduce
public
debt
from
73%
of
the
GDP
in
2015
to
56%
of
the
GDP
by
2024.
&#183;
Implement
pro-growth
tax
and
regulatory
reforms
that
will
help
our
economy
grow.
&#183;
Strengthen
the
safety
net
for
current
and
future
generations.
If
we
do
nothing,
the
safety
nets
that
so
many
Americans
depend
on
-
due
to
the
under
performing
Obama
recovery
-
today
will
simply
not
be
there
tomorrow.The
Republican
House
has
passed
over
a
dozen
jobs
bills
that
would
grow
our
economy.
However,
Harry
Reid
refuses
to
bring
them
up
making
our
economy
and
the
American
people
suffer.
&#183;
Strengthen
Medicare.
It
makes
no
changes
for
those
in
or
near
retirement.
For
future
generations,
it
will
offer
them
a
range
of
plans&#8212;including
traditional
Medicare&#8212;from
which
they
can
choose.
No
senior
can
be
denied
coverage.
Every
senior
will
have
the
support
they
need
to
get
the
care
they
deserve.
&#183;
Repeal
the
Affordable
Care
Act
(ACA)
and
clear
the
way
for
a
more
patient-centered
alternative.
You
can
have
your
own
opinion
about
this
budget
proposal,
but
the
fiscal
numbers
we
are
facing
do
not
lie.
Is
this
plan
perfect?
No.
No
plan
is
perfect,
but
it
is
a
solid
plan
that
deals
with
very
serious
issues
facing
our
country.
I
agree
with
the
words
of
Chairman
Ryan
during
floor
debate,
&#8220; We&#8217;ve
offered
a
budget
because
we
trust
the
American
people.
Unlike
the
Senate
Democrats
who
have
once
again
punted
and
not
even
offered
a
budget
this
year,
we
trust
the
people
to
make
an
honest
assessment.
We
trust
them
to
make
the
right
choice
for
their
future&#8230;&#8230;
You
can
boil
the
differences
down
to
one
question:
Who
knows
better?
The
people
or
Washington?
We
have
made
our
choice
with
this
budget.
I
trust
the
American
people
to
make
theirs.&#8221;
I
have
an
obligation
to
the
people
I
represent,
to
be
honest
about
our
current
state
of
affairs
and
to
vote
for
solutions
that
will
remedy
the
problems
we
face.
I
love
America,
as
do
all
of
you,
and
I
want
to
see
her
strong.
Thank
you
for
taking
the
time
to
read
this
newsletter.
I
look
forward
to
speaking
with
you
next
