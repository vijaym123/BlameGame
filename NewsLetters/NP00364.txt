Hello,
Last week was busy at DC and at
home, and I'm gearing up for another packed week ahead as we tackle more
Appropriations bills in Congress. Here's a look at what I got
accomplished last week:
Great
Lakes
On Friday I
announced a Great Lakes Restoration Initiative grant of $250,000 that will be
going to projects in Mentor.
You can read
more about this grant
here .
The Great Lakes are a national treasure that
must be preserved and protected.
Ive been
doing everything I can to fight for this funding in Congress, and Im
proud to see these Great Lakes Restoration Initiative resources
coming directly to the shores of Lake Erie.
Appropriations
This was a big week for the committee that I serve on in Congress, the
Appropriations
Committee.
CJS
The whole House passed our FY16 Commerce,
Justice, Science Appropriations Bill, which
prioritizes law enforcement,
supports scientific research &amp; space
exploration.
Defense
We had a full committee markup of our FY16 Defense
Appropriations Bill, which gives our troops &amp; their families a raise - and
funds military operations, readiness, and health and safety
programs.
This is how we go through the nuts and bolts
of the bill to do that.
THUD
I spoke on the House floor this week during amendment debate for
the THUD
Bill.
What is "THUD"? It is the FY16 Transportation, Housing &amp;
Urban Development Appropriations Bill. I sit on that subcommittee and
for short, we call it THUD or
T-HUD.
Skin
Cancer
As Co-Chair of the Skin Cancer
Caucus in Congress, I chatted with former MLB pitcher, and for a brief
time Indians player, Derek Lowe, himself a skin cancer
survivor.
Ill
never forget the moment I found out that the brown freckle on my upper
chest was a melanoma.
Im proud to chair this effort in Congress to raise
awareness for sun safety and hopefully prevent countless others from ever
having that same feeling.
As you can see, we have been working hard in
Congress and I will continue to serve you to the best of my ability every
day.
