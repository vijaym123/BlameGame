Dear
Friend,
As your Congressman, I send out e-mail newsletters
to keep you informed on my work in Washington and throughout the
District.
To see a copy of our most recent
legislative update click

I want to inform you that due to U.S. House rules,
there will be a blackout period. During this time, my communications
will be limited.
To stay up to date, I encourage you to sign
up and opt-in to receive my e-mails. By opting-in, you will be able
to receive my newsletters even during the blackout
period.
Social Media is also a great way to share your thoughts and
communicate with my office through my
Twitter
and
Facebook
accounts.
I look forward to
keeping you informed of my efforts in the House to serve our
community.
Sincerely,
Congressman Cedric Richmond
2nd
Congressional District of Louisiana
