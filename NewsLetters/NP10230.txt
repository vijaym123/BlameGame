Friends,
This has been a great week in North
Carolina. Ive been traveling the district, visiting local tourist
attractions and discussing issues of importance with local stakeholders to
highlight the positive impact that tourism has on the Eighth Districts
economy by creating jobs and driving
commerce.
Tourism is such
an important industry to North Carolina and especially to the Eighth
District.
North Carolina ranks as the 6th most visited state in
the country. Tourism draws about $19 billion per year to our state,
supporting more than 40,000 of our businesses and nearly 200,000
jobs.
On Monday, I had the opportunity to tour one of our states most
popular attractions, the Uwharrie National Forest.
This forest
offers residents and tourists alike a beautiful retreat filled with green
trails, rivers and streams through the historic Uwharrie Mountains.
Unfortunately, it has been difficult for many to view the
mountains and forest for the lack of safe travel. I applaud the local staff
at the Forest Service for their dedication and the incredible work
they do to maintain this natural treasure. However, the roads through
this forest have experienced tremendous damage due to inclement weather
and the lack of resources coming from bureaucrats in Washington has
made it difficult to provide adequate maintenance.
I am fighting
to draw attention to this issue in Washington and preserve the needed
funding for these
roads.
I also had a chance to check out the
renovations at the Flintlock Shooting Range, which is the only public
shooting range on a national forest in the whole country. The range
has been closed, but will be opening back up sometime next
month!
I also
got to meet with stakeholders at Concord Mills on Monday to discuss
the incredible growth that this area has experienced.
As you
know, Concord Mills is North Carolinas largest tourist attraction,
attracting millions of visitors each year and contributing tremendously to
our local economies.
With Charlotte Motor Speedway just down
the road as well, Exit 49 has become a hotbed of economic activity. In
Cabarrus County, tourists spent $362 million in 2012 and there are
about 57,000 people employed in tourism throughout the Charlotte
region.
The economic engine of the Eighth District continued to move forward
this week.
I joined several community leaders to break ground
on the new Concord Airport Business Park which will bring new
businesses and jobs to the area.
We had a great conversation about the
importance of the I-85 construction to reduce traffic to make these
attractions more accessible and enjoyable. I will continue to work hard
with local, state, and federal officials to ensure that this
construction is completed smoothly and accomplishes our
goals.
Its no wonder
that this area receives so much traffic though
there are a lot of fun
opportunities for residents and visitors alike. I had a chance to do
a ride-along at the zMAX Dragway. To say this experience was a rush is
a drastic understatement.
Flying down a drag strip at 150 mph
was an absolute thrill that I encourage everyone to go
experience.
NASCARs presence in the Eighth District is so important. Not
only does this industry provide great entertainment and support our
economy, but they also are investing in our people to create a strong
workforce at the NASCAR Technical Institute. On Thursday, I had the
opportunity to speak at the 2014 NASCAR Tech Advanced Industries Skills
Summit.
The NASCAR Technical Institute and UTI are perfect
examples of successful job training programs.
These technical
training programs are exactly what we need to get our district back to work.
Ive supported the SKILLS Act to eliminate roadblocks that prevent
workers from accessing specialized job-training right now. This bill
consolidates and streamlines more than 30 separate federally funded
workforce development programs and protects taxpayer dollars by requiring
an independent evaluation of each training program every five
years.
Investing in our workforce ensures that as our district continues to grow
and create new jobs, our people will be ready and equipped to take
advantage of these
opportunities.
I am so grateful for all the
hard work that goes into supporting our local economy.
Having
the opportunity to see this first-hand this week was encouraging and
very
informative.
As we return to Washington next week, I will take what
Ive learned to find ways to support all of you and
get our
economy working again for
everyone .
Until next
week,
Richard

Constituent Success Story
Recently,
a constituent contacted my office because he was having difficulty
receiving his Social Security Disability. He contacted our office
because he could not wait 15 months to schedule a hearing due to his health
situation. My office reached out to SSA on his behalf to expedite the
process. The constituent was issued his check within 5 months
of contacting my office.
