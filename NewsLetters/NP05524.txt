Brad needs your urgent support.
Here&rsquo;s why:
--
Last month,
polls showed our race in a dead heat.
--
Last week,
Roll Call
named Brad one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the country.
--
Now,
Boehner&rsquo;s Super PAC dumped $1,000,000 on Chicago airwaves to distort Brad&rsquo;s record. Look, this race is TIED.
If we fall behind on this week&rsquo;s ad buy goal, Republicans will POUNCE.
That&rsquo;s not an option.
David, we&rsquo;ve never needed you more. 25 days to go -- are you in?
