Rep. Duckworth meeting with volunteers at the Red Cross Shelter in
Wheeling.
Dear Neighbors,
In April 2013, severe flooding devastated communities in the
8thDistrict. Our neighbors suffered a great deal from the flooding and
I want to make sure that we are all prepared in the event of future
flooding.
In order to make sure you stay safe during heavy rains and floods, my
office has made the following resources available to you:
Information for Property Owners
National Flood Insurance Program
NFIP Flood Hazard Mapping
FEMA Grant Information
Get Flood Smart
This year, I voted for H.R. 3370, the Homeowner Flood Insurance
Accountability Act, which passed the House of Representatives. The
bipartisan legislation helps protect homeowners from increasing flood
insurance premiums, allows
"grandfathered" flood insurance rates to
remain in place for certain residences, and calls for refunds to
individuals who have paid excess premium charges.
While we hope that flooding won't affect our communities this spring,
we need to make sure that we are prepared. In Washington, I am taking
steps to ensure that homeowners are protected and our communities have
the necessary infrastructure in place to combat floods. I encourage you
to reach out to my District Office at (847) 413-1959 if you have any
questions or concerns.
Sincerely,
Tammy Duckworth
Member of Congress

By

TD
style
by
adding
a
style

italic,

any
individual

and
it
will
take
priority
over
the
default

in
the
TD.

Things
to
Avoid:
Microsoft's

Do

both

COMMENT:
Avoid
tables
that
are
more
than
a
single
"page"

inches

because
they
will

You

Rep.
Duckworth
meeting
with
volunteers
at
the
Red
Cross
Shelter
in
Wheeling. Dear
Neighbors,
In
April
2013,
severe
flooding
devastated
communities
in
the
8 th District.
Our
neighbors
suffered
a
great
deal
from
the
flooding
and
I
want
to
make
sure
that
we
are
all
prepared
in
the
event
of
future
flooding.
In
order
to
make
sure
you
stay
safe
during
heavy
rains
and
floods,
my
office
has
made
the
following
resources
available
to
you:

This

I
voted
for
H.R.
3370,
the
Homeowner
Flood

Act,
which
passed
the
House

The

allows

for
certain

and

While
we
hope
that
flooding
won&#8217;t

our

this
spring,
we
need
to

we
are
