Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
It has been a great week traveling the Sixth District and meeting with
constituents across central and eastern Kentucky! Thanks to everyone
who made time to visit with me and I hope to see many more of you this
next week!
I am looking forward to celebrating Easter tomorrow with my girls, and
we wish a happy Passover to everyone celebrating the Jewish holiday.
Casework Corner: Ensuring Our Veterans Receive the Honors They Earn
It was a real privilege to meet Berea resident and World War II Veteran
Orville F. Boes last year while he visited the World War II Memorial in
Washington, D.C. with Honor Flight
.
When he shared with me that he was having trouble acquiring his Good
Conduct Medal, my office was more than happy to assist. Through
outreach with the Department of Veterans Affairs, we were able to
successfully locate and secure Mr. Boes' award.
I was honored to present Mr. Boes with his well-deserved Good Conduct
Medal at the Sixth District Veterans' Coalition Meeting on Monday in
Richmond.
Thank you to Eastern Kentucky University and the EKU Veterans Club for
allowing us to hold this meeting of the Sixth District Veterans
Coalition, which is a group of veteran's who reside in the Sixth
Congressional District that includes active, reserve, honorably
discharged and retired service members, as well as individuals whose
groups or associations work on behalf of the veteran community. They
work to address issues facing veterans and to provide me with feedback
on pending federal legislation impacting veterans.
We cannot thank these veterans enough for their service to our nation
and I remain humbled to represent these brave men and women in
Congress.
If you are interested in joining the Coalition, please contact my
District Office at 859-219-1366.
Around the District
It was my pleasure to attend the Georgetown Chamber Luncheon on Monday
in the Commonwealth's fastest growing county. Scott County has a lot to
be proud of!
Thank you to the team at Birtley for spending Monday morning discussing
issues impacting those in the coal business and walking me through
their clean coal manufacturing facility in Lexington.
On Tuesday, I had the opportunity to discuss our struggling economy and
job growth with the Winchester-Clark County Chamber of Commerce at
their Public Policy Luncheon at the Clark County Extension Office. I
was glad to share an update on the work I am doing to promote a better
environment for job creation, including reforming outdated regulations
that hurt private sector job creation through the REINS Act and getting
Americans the skills they need to re-enter the job market through the
SKILLS Act.

Barr speaks before Winchester-Clark County Chamber of Commerce
."
Thanks to Staci and Arthur Hancock for a wonderful tour of Stone Farm
in Paris. In 35 years, more than 100 stakes winners have been raised at
Stone Farm, including three Kentucky Derby winners, two Breeders' Cup
Classic winners, two Preakness Stakes winners, and a Belmont Stakes
winner. As chairman of the Congressional Horse Caucus, I look forward
to continuing to work with owners and breeders like the Hancocks to
ensure the safe, humane care of our horses.
On Wednesday, I enjoyed discussing the current legislative issues and
the importance of education with superintendents from across central
Kentucky at the monthly Central Kentucky Educational Cooperative
Superintendents' Board Meeting.
It was my pleasure to participate in the Georgetown City Hall
Rededication on Wednesday. Such a beautiful example of historic
restoration!
On Thursday, it was great to tour Schneider Electric and meet with Jim
Pauley and other members of their team to discuss my support for
encouraging greater energy efficiency in federal buildings as well as
their business model, which offers energy saving solutions.
Thank you to Eastern Kentucky University President Dr. Michael Benson
for the opportunity to co-teach a class called "Checks and Balances:
The U.S. Congress and the Evolution of the U.S. Presidency" this
semester. I enjoyed being back in the classroom with such an impressive
group of students!
Click here to watch WTVQ's story, "EKU: Class with a Congressman."
It was great to see friends and speak with so many inspiring women at
the National Association of Women Business Owners. I enjoyed hearing
Megan Smith's entrepreneurial story about her venture at Cake
&
Whiskey.
Later Thursday evening, I attended the Refuge for Women Gala. Refuge
for Women is a faith-based program championed by courageous and
committed residents of our district. This organization serves to
address important challenges faced by women who have been sexually
exploited or find themselves trapped in the sex industry. Programs like
Refuge for Women help bring attention to and combat the atrocities
forced upon women who find themselves victims of human trafficking.
That is why I am cosponsoring H.R. 4225, the Stop Advertising Victims
of Exploitation Act, which seeks to reduce the victimization of
vulnerable children, teens, and young adults in the United States by
closing down internet marketplaces that host advertisements for the
commercial sex trade. The internet has led to a dramatic increase in
human trafficking, now generating $9.5 billion yearly right here in the
United States. We must take strong action to end online sex
trafficking, and I hope that this legislation will be signed into law
soon.
Upcoming Sixth District Agriculture Coalition
As part of my ongoing effort to ensure that our agricultural
communities are represented in Congress, I will be hosting a meeting of
my Sixth District Agriculture Coalition on April 21 in Paris at 6:00 PM
at the Bourbon County Fairgrounds (30 Legion Drive, Paris, KY 40361).
This meeting provides an opportunity to hear directly from Kentucky's
agriculture community and discuss solutions to the issues facing the
farmers of central and eastern Kentucky. I also look forward to sharing
an update on my work to promote our signature agriculture industry at
the federal level.
Please continue to let me know your thoughts and concerns about issues
facing our community, and I hope you will forward my weekly newsletter
to your friends, family and neighbors.
You may also visit my website, Facebook and Twitter, where you can find
regular updates about my work at home in the Sixth District and in
Washington.
Thank you and have a great week!
Sincerely,
Andy Barr

like

the
safe,
humane
care
of
our

O n
Wednesday,
I
enjoyed
discussing
the
current
legislative
issues
and
the
importance
of
education
with
superintendents
from
across
central
Kentucky
at
the
monthly
Central
Kentucky
Educational
Cooperative
Superin tendents&#8217;
Board
Meeting.
It
was
my
pleasure
to
participate
in
the
Georgetown
City
Hall

on
Wednesday.
Such
a
beautiful
example
of
historic
restoration!
On
Thursday,
it
was
great
to
tour
Schneider
Electric
and
meet
with
Jim
Pauley
and

of
their
team
to
discuss
my
support
for
encouraging
greater
energy
efficiency
in
federal
buildings
as
well
as
their
business
model,
which
offers
energy
saving
solutions.
Thank
you
to
Eastern
Kentucky
University
President
Dr.
Michael
Benson
for
the
opportunity
to
co-teach
a
class
called
&#8220;Checks
and
Balances:
The
U.S.
Congress
and
the
Evolution
of
the
U.S.
Presidency&#8221;
this
semester.
I
enjoyed
being
back
in
the
classroom
with
such
an
impressive
group
of
students!
Click

to
watch
WTVQ's
story,
"EKU:
Class

It
was
great
to
see
friends
and
speak
with
so
many
inspiring
women
at
the
National
Association
of
Women
Business
Owners.
I
enjoyed
hearing
Megan
Smith's
entrepreneurial
story
about
her
venture
at
Cake
&amp;
Whiskey.
Later
Thursday
evening,
I
attended
the
Refuge
for
Women
Gala.
Refuge
for
Women
is
a
faith-based
program
championed
by
courageous
and
committed
residents
of
our
district.
This
organization
serves
to
address
important
challenges
faced
by
women
who
have
been
sexually
exploited
or
find
themselves
trapped
in
the
sex
industry.
Programs
like
Refuge
for
Women
help
bring
attention
to
and
combat
the
atrocities
forced
upon
women
who
fin d
themselves
victims
of
human
trafficking.
That
is
why
I
am
cosponsoring
H.R.
4225,
the
Stop
Advertising
Victims
of
Exploitation
Act,
which
seeks
to
reduce
the
victimization
of
vulnerable
children,
teens,
and
young
adults
in
the
United
States
by
closing
down
internet
marketplaces
that
host
advertisements
for
the
commercial
sex
trade.
The
internet
has
led
to
a
dramatic
increase
in
human
trafficking,
now
generating
$9.5
billion
yearly
right
here
in
the
United
States.
We
must
take
strong
action
to
end
online
sex
trafficking,
and
I
hope
that
this
legislation
will
be
signed
into
law
soon.
