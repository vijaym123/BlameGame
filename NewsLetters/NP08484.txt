Welcoming Home Our Post 9/11 Veterans
Dear Friends,
Every year, Veterans Day &ndash; November 11th &ndash; is the day for our nation to reflect on the service and sacrifice of every generation of veterans.
This year, after 13 years of war, I want to designate November 11, 2014, as a special "Welcome Home" commemoration for all who have served in the military since September 11th. Last week,
I introduced this as a bipartisan Senate resolution
with the strong support of veterans' organizations including the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) and the Vietnam Veterans of America.
The resolution
encourages communities across the United States to plan activities for Veterans Day 2014 with a special focus on honoring and supporting those who have served during this time. Our goal is to provide citizens throughout the country with a formal opportunity to recognize the sacrifices made by this generation of veterans.
It's time to welcome home our post-9/11 veterans, to shine a light on their honor and sacrifice, to celebrate with those who have borne the battle and to remember with affection those who will never return. While the combat mission may end, the sense of duty of our servicemembers, and our commitment to them, endures.
If you need assistance obtaining information about services available to veterans or communicating with a federal agency in regards to veterans&rsquo; issues, my office can help.
