WASHINGTON
Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.), today named Rep. Gregg Harper (R-Miss.), Vice Chair of the Environment and the Economy Subcommittee. The subcommittee is led by Chairman John Shimkus (R-Ill.).
Congressman Harper will play a key role as Vice Chairman of the Environment and the Economy Subcommittee, Upton said. During his tenure on the Energy and Commerce Committee, hes been a leader in promoting job growth, reducing burdensome regulations, and investigating wasteful government programs that hinder Americas small businesses and industry. I am confident Congressman Harper will continue to further our record of success in the 114th Congress and I welcome him into his new leadership role.
The subcommittee, with its oversight of key environmental laws and programs, focuses on the intersection of regulations and jobs. As a longtime advocate for American-made energy, Harper believes that Congress must advance ideas that safely promote and build a steady supply of American energy.
I am honored to be named Vice Chairman of the Environment and the Economy Subcommittee and I look forward to working closely with Chairman Shimkus, Harper said. At a time when our economy is still struggling to recover and accelerated job creation is needed, I look forward to working with my colleagues on the committee to promote common sense policies that will spur economic growth and innovations, achieve meaningful regulatory reform, and protect consumers and the environment.
