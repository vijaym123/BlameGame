Consumer Data Given to Obamacare Needs to be Protected
There is growing concern that data consumers provide to Obamacare programs could be vulnerable to hackers and identity thieves. Obamacare officials have been unable to provide assurances that end-to-end security testing has been completed on the website.

Next week, the House is likely to consider legislation requiring the government to inform consumers if their data has been stolen. If information is lost, then consumers need to know and protect themselves from identity theft.

For now, administration officials are recommending reporting changes directly to insurers. There is no word on when the government system will accept these type of changes.
