Keeping the Commuter Transit Benefit on Track
Dear Friend,
A tax benefit that helps thousands of people in Southeastern
Pennsylvania save money on their commute to work could be cut nearly in
half if Congress fails to act by the end of the year. That is why I am
urging Congressional leaders to extend this important benefit before it
expires and ensure that it is available equally to mass transit users
and those who drive to work.
Currently, employers can offer their employees the option of setting
aside up to $245 per month in pre-tax dollars to cover commuting and
parking expenses. While the maximum parking benefit is set to increase
to $250 in 2014, public transit commuters will see their maximum
benefit cut to $130 unless Congress acts before Dec. 31.

In these challenging economic times, transit agencies in Pennsylvania
and across the nation have been forced to raise fares as they struggle
to balance their budgets. Many Pennsylvania families simply cannot
afford the additional burden of a significant tax increase. If Congress
fails to act, 9,500 Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority
(SEPTA) riders in the Greater Philadelphia Area could see their taxes
increase by $300 or more next year.
The impact will reach beyond family budgets. Allowing the transit
benefit to expire could encourage more commuters to drive to work,
resulting in more congestion on our roads, increased air pollution,
greater dependence on foreign oil and even more strain on transit
agency budgets.
In Congress, I am a cosponsor of the Commuter Parity Act (H.R. 2288) to
make transit and parking benefits equal on a permanent basis. I will
keep fighting to ensure this important tax benefit stays on track for
Pennsylvania commuters next year.
Sincerely,
Allyson Y. Schwartz

extend
this
important
