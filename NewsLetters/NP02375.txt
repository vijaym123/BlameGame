Veterans Job and Resource Fair
On Monday, March 9th,
I will host a jobs and resources fair for
veterans and their families in the Lowcountry. There will be over 100
employers from across South Carolina, as well as 25 claims
representatives from the VA regional office in Columbia, in attendance.
The jobs and resources fair follows a series of workshops around the
state I hosted that focused on providing veterans with various skills
and information to help them land jobs. The fair is free and open to
all veterans and their families. A second fair will be held in
Greenville on March 25.
Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's Address to Congress
On Tuesday, I attended Prime Minister Netanyahu's address to Congress.
His speech underscored two significant points - the importance of our
nation's relationship with Israel and the critical need to stand
shoulder to shoulder with them to ensure Iran does not become a nuclear
power. Prime Minister Netanyahu's perspective is vital as we continue
to debate further sanctions against Iran and the appropriate American
response to Islamic extremist organizations operating in the Middle
East. The threats Israel faces are real and they have the right to
protect themselves during this time of volatility and growing extremism
in the Middle East. The stakes are too high for America not to fully
support one of our closest and most steadfast allies.
Floor Speech on NLRB
Earlier this week, I spoke about NLRB's dangerous Ambush Election rule,
which among other things requires an unprecedented amount of an
employee's personal information to be given to union representatives. I
addressed this issue on the Senate floor. Watch here:

Celebrating 50th Anniversary of 'Bloody Sunday' in Selma
As Senate Co-Chair of the Congressional Pilgrimage to Selma, Alabama, I
will attend the remembrance ceremonies that mark the 50th anniversary
of Bloody Sunday and the civil rights marches in Selma and Montgomery.
It is truly an honor to join Rep. John Lewis (D-GA), who is a civil
rights icon, in celebrating such an important part of history.
I will also appear on CBS's Face the Nation Sunday morning to discuss
the trip.
Thank you again for subscribing!
Sincerely,
Tim
