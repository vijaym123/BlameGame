Dear Friend,
I am writing to update you on some of my work in Washington. As always, if I can be of any help to you, do not hesitate to call my office at (513) 684-2723.
Best,
Steve Chabot
Tri-State Honor Flight
I recently had the privilege of visiting with Cincinnati-area Veterans during an Honor Flight to the nation's capital. These men defended freedom during some of its darkest hours. Never pass up the opportunity to thank them for their service. Click on the image below to look at more pictures from the day.
An Entrepreneurial Renaissance
As part of my continuing work to promote entrepreneurship and small business, I wrote a guest post for the
Kauffman Foundation's Entrepreneurship Policy blog . In it, I describe the steps we can take to create vibrant communities with more opportunity, more innovation, and greater prosperity.
A Friend, Champion, and Guardian
I was humbled to receive three separate distinctions over the last few weeks recognizing me as a Friend of the Taxpayer, a Champion of the Worker, and a Guardian of Small Business. So long as I am honored to serve Ohio's First District, I will continue to protect taxpayers against wasteful spending, promote sound labor policies, and advocate for pro-growth solutions that help America's small businesses.
