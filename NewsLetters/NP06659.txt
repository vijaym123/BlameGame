Dear Friend,
In exactly two months, voters across the country will go to the polls to participate in elections that will determine control of the Senate. We need to make the most out of every second between now and then.
If Republicans manage to pick up the six seats they need to take control, we can expect more shutdowns, more dysfunction, and even less progress for the middle class.
I need you to step up. I need every last one of our grassroots supporters engaged and keeping us going strong. Can you get us $5 closer to our $50,000 Primary Day Goal?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Time is short, and the stakes are high. If the Republicans take over the Senate, everything we&rsquo;ve worked so hard to achieve is at risk.
Does anyone believe that a Tea Party Senate would take meaningful action on climate change? Does anyone believe that a Tea Party Senate would support a clean energy revolution, rather than protecting the pockets of the big oil billionaire Koch brothers? Every moment, every voter contact, and every last red cent counts between now and Election Day. We have to make the most of our time, and hitting our fundraising goals helps us do that. Give $5 today.
Thanks for your ongoing support.
