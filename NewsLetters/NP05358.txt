Dear Friends,
Many of you have
been following the news closely regarding the latest on Ebola and the
federal government's response, and I'd like to share my thoughts with
you on how we can work to keep Americans safe from this devastating
disease.
One month ago, the president told the nation that the
odds of an Ebola outbreak in the United States were extremely
low. Since that time, Thomas Eric Duncan traveled from West Africa to
Texas, where he was diagnosed with Ebola and later died.
At
least two health care workers who treated Mr. Duncan have been
infected, and one reportedly flew on a commercial airline along with 132 other
passengers just hours before she was hospitalized and diagnosed with
Ebola. The Centers for Disease Control now says the patient should not
have flown after having an elevated temperature after treating
Duncan. As we have seen in recent weeks, just a handful of travelers
infected with Ebola have the potential to spread this gruesome illness
throughout the United States.
Our hearts go out to the nations
suffering from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and the United States
should provide humanitarian aid to help local governments and medical
professionals treat and contain Ebola.
However, we must
work to protect our homeland and the health of Americans, which is why
I've called on President Obama to protect the American people from this
devastating disease by banning travel to the United States from West
Africa for the duration of this crisis and establishing concrete
protocols to stop the transmission of Ebola within our
country.

WASHINGTON WORKS
Earlier this week, I visited the DuPont Washington Works plant near
Parkersburg. The plant employs about 1,500 people, and the materials made
in West Virginia are used in a wide range of products such as paint
brushes, toothbrushes and suspension fabrics. I met with employees in the
filament department and took their questions on issues such as
education, national security and government regulation. I also discussed
regional economic development opportunities that would be spurred by the
proposed ethane cracker, which would be located on property adjoining
the Washington Works facility.
Thank you for reading my
weekly
e-newsletter, and as always, you can join in the conversation on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Shelley
