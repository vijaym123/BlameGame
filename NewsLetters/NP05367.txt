Dear Friends,
Throughout
the past six years of the Obama Administration, we have seen firsthand
how critical it is for the United States to be unwavering in our
resolve to protect American interests and our national security from threats
across the world. Unfortunately, during this same time span,
President Obama has put into motion historically steep cuts -- more than $1
trillion -- to our nations defense budget. Time and again, I have
called it President Obamas Disarming of America, which has left a vacuum
of leadership throughout the world that is being filled by the likes
of ISIS, Russia, and Iran.
In 2014 alone:
ISIS is mounting a campaign of terror, savagely killing non-believers
including innocent men, women and children who stand in the way of an
Islamic caliphate;
Russia
is continuing to infringe on the sovereignty and territorial rights of
our ally Ukraine by arming the pro-Russian
separatists;
Syria is in the midst of a civil war
that has seen more than 200,000 deaths and created a humanitarian crisis
that is straining our allies ability to provide the necessary
assistance and security;
While
the Obama Administration has eased sanctions on Iran, there is no
evidence that Iran isnt still on track to developing a nuclear weapon and
delivery system that could hit the United States by
2015;
Terror groups like Boko Haram and
Al-Shabaab are establishing safehavens in North Africa from which they
train and carryout gruesome attacks;
And an outbreak of Ebola in West Africa in March, coupled with
an underwhelming response from the State Department early on, has led
to the urgent involvement of the U.S. military in the region and the
first case of the deadly disease reaching U.S.
soil.
The threats our country faces are
growing, but the budget to support it has been siphoned off to pay for the
Presidents misguided priorities. Please take a moment to read my
piece in Politico Magazine this week,
A bigger budget
for a bigger threat.
Our
military leaders have expressed their concern for the drastic budget
cuts time and again.
In
February 2013, even before our military was confronting the threats
they face today, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin
Dempsey declared that sequestration defense cuts put the military on a
path where the force may become
so degraded and so
unready,
it would be
immoral to use the
force.
That same
month, Vice Chairman Adm. Sandy Winnefeld stated that,
there
could be, for the first time in my career, instances where we may be
asked to respond to a crisis and we will have to say that we
cannot.
And to sum
things up, Defense Sec. Chuck Hagel stated in February of this year
that,
American dominance in the seas, sky and space can no
longer be taken for
granted.
President Obamas policies have degraded and
diminished the ability of the U.S. military to safely, securely protect the
United States and our interests.
In response, Congress gave the Defense Department a brief reprieve
from the sequester, but these historically steep cuts kick back into
full throttle in 2016.
In a little over a year, our military will
face a national security cliff that will cripple the readiness and
reliability of the U.S. Armed Forces and increase risk to our
all-volunteer force. Furthermore, unless President Obama can compromise to reverse
the defense cuts, our military will go over the cliff at a time when
they will be in the midst of a long war with ISIS -- the most
well-funded, well-networked terror group our nation has faced.
Ironically, President Obama visited the Pentagon
last week and urged Congress to find a solution to the defense budget
cuts that he put into motion. With the growing threats confronting the
United States and our allies, I urge President Obama to abandon his
tired efforts to tie repeal of defense cuts with tax hikes and
increased spending for his liberal interests.
We must return the
military budget to necessary levels that ensures our men and women in uniform
can carry out the mission asked of them and return home safely to
their loved ones.
Please take a
moment to complete the survey below to let me know how you feel about
the cuts to the Department of Defense budget, and what should be done
to ensure that our men and women in uniform have the support they need
and deserve.
Thank you for
taking an interest in what I am doing to best represent you in
Washington.
Sincerely,
Jim
Inhofe
