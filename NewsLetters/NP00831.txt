Friend
A quick heads up: There are currently two provisions in this years defense policy bill that deal with immigration. One of them urges the Secretary of Defense to review allowing DACA recipients (young illegal immigrants) to serve in the armed forces, while the other calls on the Pentagon to analyze how DACA recipients could expand the number of potential recruits.
Both of these provisions were offered as amendments by Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee.
I voted against both during the Committee markup; however, they narrowly passed and were included in the defense policy bill.
Thats why I am supporting new amendments that will strip these provisions from the final defense policy bill . Protecting and providing for our servicemembers and the United States military readiness should not be derailed by partisan agendas
on either side of the aisle
over other policy issues.
Yours in service,
Randy
