A Big Week
Tuesday, May 5, 2015
Dear Friend,
We recently had a very big week in Congress in our efforts to protect the environment.
On April 22, we celebrated Earth Day, a day established largely in response to the devastating 1969 oil spill off the Central Coast of California. That day I introduced a bill in Congress that would place a moratorium on offshore fracking in federal waters off the West Coast until a full environmental review of the controversial practice is completed.
While we still know very little about the impacts of onshore fracking, we know even less about impacts of offshore fracking. Until we can gain a better understanding of the scope and impacts of these activities, offshore fracking should be halted. We should not be putting the environment at risk because of inadequate oversight. I held a press conference to talk about the bill. You can watch KEYT&rsquo;s coverage

We also commemorated the fifth anniversary of the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Our economy and environment are both still paying the price for this disaster, which is why I spoke at a hearing on Capitol Hill about the need for strengthening safety standards in offshore oil drilling. You can watch video of my testimony
here .
Finally, as we all know, climate change is one of the most urgent and serious problems we face, which is why I spoke during an Energy and Commerce Committee hearing against deeply flawed legislation that would derail the EPA&rsquo;s efforts to regulate carbon emissions for the first time from power planets. You can watch that video
