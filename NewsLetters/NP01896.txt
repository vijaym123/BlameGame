In case you havent heard the news yet, the Veterans Administration (VA) recently
announced
that in order to expand the number of veterans eligible under the Veterans Choice Program, they are changing the way the distance between a veterans residence and the nearest VA medical facility is calculated. (This is the program that allows eligible veterans to receive access to non-VA providers, to ensure they get the care they need and deserve). The VA will now be calculating the 40-mile rule by driving miles instead of as the crow flies miles
thanks to feedback from veterans, their families, and others.
This policy change will occur through a regulatory action that may take a number of weeks, but the good news is that the VA estimates this change will
roughly double the number of veterans who will be eligible to participate in the Choice program.
The VA published a FAQ sheet on the change
here , and has said they will notify newly eligible veterans by mail.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. Our servicemembers didnt wait to answer the call of duty, and they should not have to wait to receive timely, quality medical care. I will continue working to ensure that is the case.
