CONSTITUENT SERVICES
VISITING DC
July 18, 2014
On Monday, the VA Office of the Inspector General (IG)
released a report on the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) two-year-old
claim initiative.
This initiative was purportedly started by the
Department to process long-pending claims more quickly.
I
requested this latest report, along with several other
Senators.
The IG report confirmed that VAs fix to its backlog process was just
smoke and mirrors-- another example of VA manipulating the data to
make it appear as if veterans are being well served.
It is
absolutely shameful that a department charged with the care of our nations
veterans would choose to resort to practices that negatively affect them
and inaccurately portray the VAs workload.
You can read a
summary of the reports findings
here .
The
IG report released Monday afternoon played a large role in the House
Committee on Veterans Affairs hearing that took place Monday
evening.
Linda Halliday, the witness from the VA Office of Inspector
General (IG), offered damaging testimony that outlined many troubling
issues at VA, including a high rate of errors in processing claims, as
mentioned above; work that does not fall under the Veterans Benefits
Administrations (VBA) backlog statistic increasing at alarming rates;
notable weaknesses in financial stewardship; and mis-management at
regional offices.
This testimony is particularly damning, as
it shows the utter dysfunction and deeply systemic problems at the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
I cannot see how VA can
continue to claim success in their claims backlog or caring for our
veterans.
Clearly, the VA has not been upholding its responsibilities
either to veterans or to taxpayers.
Despite Mondays events,
the VA chose to put out a press release on Tuesday to tout their
supposed backlog reduction.
This press release used the manipulated
data that was refuted by both the Inspector General and during the
House Committee hearing the night before.
Why the VA would choose
to ignore the recent events and send out this press release perplexed
me.
During Wednesdays Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs
hearing, I was able to ask acting Secretary Gibson if he approved the
press release and why publicizing suspect data would bring about
trust and integrity in his Department.
Unfortunately, I did not
receive a satisfactory answer from Secretary Gibson.

Next week the Presidents VA Secretary nominee, Robert McDonald,
will come before the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs for his
confirmation hearing.
I look forward to hearing Mr. McDonalds
thoughts on the Department and potential solutions to the VAs systemic
problems.
Sincerely,
Richard
Burr
