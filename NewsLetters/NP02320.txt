Last week, we introduced legislation, the Michael Davis, Jr. in Honor of State and Local Law Enforcement Act, to strengthen the interior enforcement of our immigration laws.
A college education unlocks a world of opportunities, but it is becoming increasingly difficult for families to afford it. The total amount of outstanding student loan debt in the U.S. now amounts to
$1.16 trillion .
We want to do everything we can to support hardworking families as they prepare for the future and save for education costs. For example, last week, the House passed bipartisan legislation, H.R. 529, to strengthen, expand and modernize 529 college savings accounts.
Families already use this tool to help save for college; there are now over 12 million plans nationwide.
My colleague and sponsor of the bill, Lynn Jenkins (R-KS), writes
Studies have demonstrated how the existence of any sort of college savings account substantially increases the chances of a child attending college.
As little as $500 in a savings plan sees children three times as likely to enroll, and four times as likely to graduate from college.
Rather than raise taxes on families utilizing this program, we hope the President will support this bipartisan legislation to strengthen 529 accounts. Learn more about this legislation

Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., said panel members knew Clinton used personal e-mail accounts during her tenure but didn't learn until recently that all of her State Department business was conducted outside normal government e-mail channels.
