Defending Energy
Research
The National Energy Technology Laboratory in
Morgantown is a vital part of our energy security. The research on fossil fuel
technology carried out there is important to achieving energy
independence and strengthening our national security.
That is why
NETL deserves full funding and certainty that its important mission
will be maintained. This week, the House took up a spending bill that
covers NETL and I offered a successful bipartisan amendment that ensures
NETL will not be closed, privatized, or relocated. Additionally, we
helped defeat five amendments to take funding from
NETL.

Energy Efficiency is Common
Sense
Energy efficiency was a central focus this week with a speech on
Tuesday, the introduction of comprehensive efficiency legislation on
Wednesday, and a White House signing ceremony for the Energy Efficiency
Improvement Act, which was introduced by myself and Rep. Welch
(D-VT).
While many of our energy challenges are complicated and wont
get solved overnight, efficiency is one area where we can find common
ground. This is not a Democratic idea or a Republican idea - its just
common sense. There are not many areas I agree with President Obama,
but we are pleased he understands we can find common ground on energy
efficiency.
We ought to be promoting building efficiency as
a way to save energy, save money, and create jobs. Energy independence
is a national security issue, and efficiency should be part of the
solution.
A Balanced
Budget
House Republicans have long said that, just like every day
Americans, Congress should balance its budget. This week, we passed a budget
that balances without raising taxes, strengthens Medicare and Social
Security, reduces the size of government, and repeals
Obamacare.
In the past, I broke with his party and voted against the House
budget because it negatively impacted seniors and rural communities.
After negotiations with the Senate, todays joint budget removed the
provisions with which I disagreed. Following consultation with AARP of West
Virginia and other senior organizations, I was comfortable supporting
this budget because it will protect seniors and rural
communities.
Voting For Jobs
In
numerous meetings across the First District throughout the past four years,
there has been one consistent concern
job creation. We need Congress
to come together and pass legislation that encourages private-sector
job growth. This week, one of our allies in that work, the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce, awarded me their Spirit of Enterprise Award for a
pro-jobs voting record.
Band on the March
The Pride of
West Virginia Marching Band has been selected to perform at the 2016
Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade. We wish them all the best and know they
will represent the state with dignity.
Have a great
week,
David McKinley
