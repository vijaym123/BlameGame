Dear
Friend,
There is no question that men and women who have worn the uniforms
of the United States of America are deserving of our appreciation for
their acts of commitment and heroism.
As a nation, we pause each
Memorial Day to reflect on the stories of bravery and brotherhood, of
sacrifice and service, and to thank troops from all branches of the
Armed Forces.
General Douglas MacArthur said, The soldier,
above all others, is required to practice the greatest act of
religious training
sacrifice. That is as true today as it was when
MacArthur spoke those words to West Point graduates in 1962. Then, as now, we
owe them a debt of gratitude.
Utahns have always answered
the call of duty.
Whether in Afghanistan or Iraq, the Persian
Gulf, Vietnam, Korea, in the Pacific, Europe or North Africa
our state
has sent its sons and daughters, and they have proudly represented our
country.
Many returned home to their families, and many too,
gave their last full measure for the freedoms we enjoy each
day.
Meeting some of Utah's veterans in
Taylorsville.
For those who have
made the ultimate sacrifice, today is an opportunity for us to pay
tribute.
We also remember that for every absent soldier, sailor,
airman and Marine, there are mothers and fathers, spouses and children,
friends and colleagues who love them, miss them and keep alive their
memory.
While there will never be adequate means to thank
our veteran members of the military for their bravery, or for their
sacrifice, I will always support provide legislation that provides for
our troops to accomplish their mission and to return home safely. It
is in their honor that I have supported:
-
H.R.32, Military Surviving Spouses
Equity Act, which would repeal the Widows Tax, wherein survivors and
dependents of veterans who were killed on active duty - or from a
service-connected cause - are forced to reduce their Survival Benefit
Plan (SBP) annuities by the amount in Dependency and Indemnity
Compensation (DIC) they receive on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
-
H.R.543, Blue Water
Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2013, which would provide the presumption of
exposure to Agent Orange to Navy and Marine veterans who served in
the off shore waters of Vietnam for the purposes of Veterans
Administration (VA) health benefits.
This would ensure that those Vietnam
veterans are able to receive the VA healthcare that they were promised
and deserve.
-
H.R.2590, 21st Century Health Care for Heroes Act, which would
direct the Department of Defense and the Veterans Administration to
develop a fully electronic and interoperable health records system
between the two agencies.
Too often veterans benefits are delayed
due to bureaucratic delays in the sending of medical records from the
Defense Department to the VA.
I thank our men and
women in uniform this Memorial Day, and throughout the year for
protecting the liberties we cherish as a nation.
Sincerely,
U.S.
Representative
4th District of Utah
