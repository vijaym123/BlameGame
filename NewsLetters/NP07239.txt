A
Huge Win for Federal Contract Workers Close to the ROSIE Act
On Thursday, President Obama issued an Executive Order (EO) that provides workplace protections for federal contract workers.
His EO includes key components
of my recently introduced Restore Opportunity, Strengthen, and Improve the Economy (ROSIE) Act, a bill I discussed at a rally at Union Station , the day I introduced it, with federal contract workers who work with Good Jobs Nation, a federal contract workers right advocacy group that came to me.
The ROSIE Act, much like the EO, requires employers seeking federal contracts to demonstrate compliance with workplace protection laws, including laws governing labor relations, wages and hours, and health and safety laws.
The President has done the right thing for the workers and the taxpayers by issuing his EO.
There is no reason that contractors, whose revenue comes from the federal government, should be continuously rewarded contracts by the federal taxpayers when they violate federal laws and cheat their workers.
More Action for Unaccompanied Minors from
Central America
Last week, I participated in the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) ad hoc hearing
that featured the first testimony from unaccompanied minors from Central America.
At the hearing, I also mentioned my letter
sent on Tuesday to District of Columbia Bar president Brigida Benitez, inquiring about the Bars efforts to help address the needs of unaccompanied minors from Central America both at the U.S. border and here in D.C.
Our Bar has a history of answering the call for pro bono legal help before elections to help prevent intimidation at the polls.
Perhaps they can help here in the District of Columbia, where already 187 unaccompanied minors have come, and at the border, to prevent a similar situation.
My Bill to Redevelop the SW Ecodistrict
I introduced on Tuesday the Department of Energy (DOE) Forrestal Complex Redevelopment Act , which provides for a modern DOE headquarters at 1000 Independence Avenue SW, mixed uses and amenities, and a possible location of a nationally significant museum or memorial.
My bill also directs the General Services Administration (GSA) to enter into public-private partnerships to complete the project and to further the completion of this area-endorsed Southwest Ecodistrict plan, approved by the National Capital Planning Commission.
Just as the GSA did not move to redevelop the Old Post Office Building until I got a bill passed, I am tired of waiting for the GSA to finally develop this extraordinary last site on time instead of the GSA proposal to develop only part of it.
No New FBI Headquarters in D.C., But We Still Benefit
On Tuesday, the General Services Administration (GSA) released a shortlist of potential sites for the new Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) headquarters , including the Greenbelt Metro Station Site and Landover Mall Site in Prince Georges County, MD, and the GSA Springfield/Franconia Warehouse Complex in Fairfax County, VA.
Although there were prior indications that the Districts site would not be selected, this city still stands to significantly benefit from the 6.7 acres of prime real estate that will soon become available, furthering the redevelopment of the Pennsylvania Avenue corridor to bring it alive with commercial amenities.
District Courts Decision on D.C. Handgun Ban
Dont try carrying handguns on D.C. streets just yet; the citys absolute ban is still in effect because the D.C. federal district court has issued a stay.
On July 26, U.S. District Judge Frederick J. Scullin, a New York federal district court senior judge sitting here by designation, ruled the District of Columbia's ban
on carrying a handgun outside of the home as unconstitutional.
However, the court gave the District the authority to regulate who may carry a gun and under what circumstances.
The D.C. Attorney General is considering an appeal and the Council is considering changes, such as tight regulations that could probably still result in few people taking handguns outside of the home.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the constitutionality of three of the Districts four major gun laws
the ban on assault weapons, the ban on large capacity ammunition feeding devices, and basic registration requirements for handguns.
