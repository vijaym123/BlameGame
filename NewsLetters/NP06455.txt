Friends,
I know many of you watched the president's address this week and I thank those who have contacted me to express your thoughts.
After receiving briefings from intelligence and military officials, I want to let you know where I stand.
The Islamic State is a clear threat to the United States and must be destroyed.
I am glad the president has outlined a strategy and announced his commitment to defeating these terrorists wherever they exist.
However, when the president speaks about a military campaign lasting years and spanning different countries,
C ongress needs to provide authorization and then follow up with the resources necessary to
win decisively .
As Congress prepares to act, I would like to see the Administrations plan for holding Syrian opposition fighters accountable if we give them weapons. I also believe we should explore every possible avenue to cut off the Islamic States financial resources.
I remain deeply concerned about the Islamic States threat to our homeland.
Congress should take action to strengthen border security and take away citizenship from any American who joins the Islamic State.
Know that my thoughts are with the many Americans whose lives have been forever changed by the evil of Islamic terrorismfrom the attacks of thirteen years ago to the murder that was broadcast last week. Our servicemembers and their families deserve unending gratitude and support for fighting this evil on our behalf.
