Sheridan Volunteers House Homeless Veterans
Dear Friends,
This week in Cattle Call, I wanted to highlight the good work being done at Sheridans Freedom Hall.
Supported by Volunteers of America (VOA) of the Northern Rockies, this transitional home has been working to not leave one veteran on the street.
I recently met with Heath Steel, the Executive VP of operations of the VOA there in Sheridan.
Freedom Hall houses up to 10 veterans in a transitional setting for up to two years and focuses on giving those who need it a hand up, instead of offering a hand out.
Please

for more info on the shelter or go to

Please
share your thoughts
with me on this and any other issues.
Sincerely,
