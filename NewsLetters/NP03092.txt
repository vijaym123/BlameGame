Statement on President Obama's Budget
Proposal
2/2/15
Today, in response to President Obama's
proposed Fiscal Year 2016 Budget, Congressman Doug Lamborn released the
following statement:
It
is true that President Obama has proposed an increase to our national
security spending. However, his draconian defense cuts over the last
few years caused the problem in the first place. Even his proposed DOD
increases come as something of a mixed bag since he is re-proposing
cuts to the DOD budget that the Congress firmly opposed last year. One
example is his proposal to cut the Veterans Choice program. This program
allows veterans to go to private sector doctors if they wait more
than 30 days or live more than 40 miles from a VA medical facility.
Unfortunately, the President is ignoring the will of the voters who sent
new majorities to Congress to shake up the way things are done in
Washington.
How can the
President expect his budget to be taken seriously when it is so far
out-of-step with the priorities the American people just voted for three
short months ago? More tax increases, more expensive government
programs, and unsustainable levels of new debt are not how to help the
hardworking taxpayers who live
paycheck-to-paycheck.
House Republicans will be proposing solutions
that work towards a balanced budget and grow our economy from the
ground up. Rather than borrowing money from our children and
grandchildren, President Obama should compromise with the people's representatives
to achieve a serious and fiscally sustainable budget for the next
fiscal year."

Budget
Committee)
Tax
Increases
Despite $2.1 trillion in new tax increases, President Obamas
budget never
balancesever.
Major proposed tax increases include higher levies on
savings and investment, small businesses, and increases in the costs of
hiring workers.
These tax hikes would stunt the economic growth
needed to get Americans back to work, and come on top of $1.7 trillion in
tax hikes already imposed by this
Administration.
Spending
Increases
The Presidents budget increases
annually-appropriated spending for next year by $74 billion relative to
current law. Over 5 years, he would increase such spending by $322
billion.
Next year alone, the Presidents budget would grow total federal
spending by $259 billion, or 7
percent.
Total spending will increase by 65 percent
($2.4 trillion) in 10 years under the Presidents
plan.
Interest Costs
Skyrocket
President Obamas plan
more than triples interest costs, which remain the fastest growing item
in the
budget.
Interest on the debt this year would be $229 billion, but would
rise to $785 billion in 2025 under his
plan.
At the end of Presidents plan,
annual interest costs would be larger than his proposed spending for
national defense, Medicaid or the combined total of all non-defense
agency
spending.
Debt
Climbs
Since 2009, weve added $7.5 trillion to the debt and
spent $21.1
trillion.
The Presidents budget plan would add $8.5 trillion to the
debt.
Cumulative deficits would amount to $5.7 trillion, and gross debt would climb
to $26.3 trillion in 2025.
