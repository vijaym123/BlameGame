One Million
Dollars
Last week I returned another
$108,289
to the treasury from my office budget for 2013,
bringing my five year total returned to
$1,010,050 . Our office has reduced spending every year since 2009.
Why is
this important?
These are your hard-earned tax
dollars and we try to watch every penny . Most years we operate our
offices on only 85 percent of the budget, returning the rest to the
treasury where it is used for deficit reduction.
We try to
operate our office like a business
efficiently, with strong
customer service.
We want to show other Washington
agencies that they can live below their budgets, too. Every one of our staff
watches the budget carefully. They are fully committed to spending
wisely, and I appreciate their efforts.
Keeping Our Promises
Last week
Congress voted to reverse the proposed cuts to the cost of living
adjustments for younger military retirees. We must keep Americas
promise to our veterans,
so I supported restoring the full
COLAs . Changing retirement benefits mid-career isnt fair to our
military men and women who serve us.
However, this
doesnt solve the $2.7 trillion shortfall in the military retirement
system.
Both parties in Congress cant keep kicking the can down
the road and ducking this issue. America owes it to our veterans to
find the right solution that guarantees them their retirement will be
there when they need it.
Living
Within Our Means
Democrat lawmakers in
Congress voted almost unanimously to suspend Americas debt ceiling
until March of next year
without any spending cuts or reforms.
With a national debt of over $17 trillion, I strongly opposed
the measure.
Its important that America pays its debts on time and in full, but
Washington must cut wasteful spending and begin to live within its means.
Republicans have successfully secured $2.2 trillion in real spending
cuts including the sequester savings.
The annual deficits have
been cut by nearly two-thirds from President Obamas record setting
high levels.
Much of the budget is now operating at below 2009
levels. The entire federal budget has actually shrunk two years in a
row.
Thats not nearly good enough. We need a budget not
only balances
but sets a clear pathway to a debt-free
America.
Stopping The
IRS
Last week my House Ways &amp; Means Committee passed
the
Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act of
2014
to suspend new IRS on certain non-profit
organizations.
Make no mistake, the goal of these new IRS rules is to
intimidate We the People.
The darkest days in Americas
history are when the government uses its immense power to silence the
voices of those who disagreed. We suffered under this intimidation
during the civil rights era, the anti-war era and now against citizens
and volunteers who are conservative, pro-Israel or
pro-life.
Whether you are Republican or Democrat, Tea Party or progressive, as
Americans we cannot allow any White House to target average citizens
who simply want to freely participate in our democratic process.
I t must be stopped now.
Another Day, Another Delay
When the White House recently announced yet another delay
of an Affordable Care Act mandate
this time for businesses with
50-99 workers - you would think that our local Texas businesses would be
relieved.
They are not.
They tell me
this doesnt solve the problem of higher health care costs theyre
facing.
It just creates more uncertainty and makes them less likely to
expand their business or hire new workers.
They believe the
Affordable Care Act mandate should be repealed for every business
large
or small - and every family, too!
I couldnt agree
more.

Make no mistake - this is the government
seeking to silence the voice of those who disagree.
The Economy is
Plodding Along
It is critical we preserve full-time jobs in
America and end this war on our workers.
Obama wants to close tax loop holes to spend
more; Republicans want to lower rates for
everybody.
Rep. Brady
and Amy Milstead talk about how ObamaCare is affecting her small
business in Texas.
What happens if we return to the 40 hour work week?
How does it impact the local
worker?
