Friends,
This month, I focused on a number of
efforts to protect American citizens from government overreach. I also
worked to cut the red tape, which is hurting our nation's job creators.
There was some good news to come out of Washington: Congress passed a
multi-year farm bill, which benefits Nebraska producers and consumers.
You can read more about these and other issues below.
As
Nebraska celebrates Statehood Day on March 1, I wanted to share with you a
special video illustrating why Nebraska is home to "the Good life."
Join me in celebrating our proud, shared heritage and traditions by
clicking below to watch the video!
Nebraska
Breakfast
Nebraska Breakfast kicked off its 71st year this week with a great
turnout on Capitol Hill. If you are a Nebraskan visiting DC, I hope
you'll join the delegation to discuss current issues in Washington.

Staff Local Office

Pushing Back Against IRS
Overreach
This week,
I
introduced two bills to protect Nebraskans and all Americans from IRS
overreach. Taxpayers have the absolute right to expect the IRS to treat all
citizens fairly, and the IRS has a long way to go to restore its
credibility. My legis lation will promote
accountability and transparency within the IRS and ensure the
constitutional rights of all American taxpayers are protected. Learn more

Keeping Promises
to Seniors
The Obama Administration announced plans to
make cuts to the Medicare Advantage program. Alarmingly, these cuts
would hurt more than 35,000 Nebraska seniors. Rather than receiving the
care they were promised, thousands of seniors will now lose access to
their benefits to support $308 billion in spending for ObamaCare. I
have called on President Obama to change course and keep his word to
senior citizens. Watch my speech on the Senate floor
HERE .
Protecting Jobs, Innovation, and Patient
Safety
Low-risk health information technology is a
growing sector of our economy that is creating jobs and helping improve
health care. However, federal regulations governing the industry haven't
been updated to reflect modern developments. I teamed up with Senator
Angus King, an Independent from Maine, to introduce the PROTECT Act to
offer regulatory certainty for health IT. My bill promotes innovation
and job creation, all while boosting patient safety. Find out more
HERE .
At Long Last, A Farm
Bill
Congress' long-awaited passage of a farm bill is welcome
news for Nebraska producers and consumers. The legislation offers
certainty and needed policy updates to strengthen our agriculture
industry, Nebraska's number one economic driver. Watch my speech on the
Senate floor expressing my support for the farm bill
HERE .
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT ... IN THE
NEWS

Today with Sen. Angus King (I-Maine)

our bill, the PROTECT Act, makes needed regulatory changes to promote
innovation in low-risk health IT ...

PHOTOS OF THE MONTH
While spending the day at STRATCOM
and the 55th Wing in Bellevue, I was able to visit with many of our
dedicated servicemembers about their ongoing missions .
Nebraska is blessed to serve as home for these fine military
installations.
I was
invited to speak to a political science class at UNL about the
privilege of working in public service and representing Nebraska in the U.S.
Senate. Nebraska's bright and talented young people give me so much
hope for our state's future.
As a proud
alumna of the Nebraska LEAD program, I was glad to welcome the
Nebraska LEAD Class 33 in Washington as they continue their education in
agricultural leadership.
