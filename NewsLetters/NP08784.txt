Dear Friends,
With Fathers Day quickly
approaching, I cherish the opportunity to pause and reflect on the true
meaning of this day.
This coming Sunday, let us honor the fathers in
our lives
appreciate their untold sacrifices, boundless love, and
enduring patience as we think of how fathers influence our families,
communities, and our society.
This Fathers Day, I
am reminded of the challenges that my own father overcame. My dad
Enrique Ros
took a courageous leap of faith when he led my family away
from the oppressive Castro regime and towards freedom in America.
Once in the United States, he worked tirelessly for our young family
and, alongside my mother, Amanda, they became owners of a small and
successful business.
I learned countless life lessons on the
importance of hard-work and determination from my dad.
Abu Kiki, as
we lovingly called him, was the center of our family, our foundation,
and the one person who kept us grounded and confident in the path of
our lives.
Fathers are not just our biggest
fans; they are our stable source of inspiration.
In addition to
working diligently to provide my family with a better life, my father
was equally devoted to a Cuba free from the repressive Castro
regime.
My fathers humanity was evident in all that he did.
His
wisdom and integrity afforded him the courage to act on his
convictions. As a Member of Congress, I look to his example as work for the
betterment of our community and our nation.
In every way possible, I
am a product of my fathers hard work, dedication, and
support.
On this Fathers Day, let us honor the men who have loved us,
inspired us, and guided us through their strength, their actions, and
their powerful presence. Thank you to all the fathers and grandfathers
who have made our community a better
place.
Sincerely,
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
Member of
Congress
