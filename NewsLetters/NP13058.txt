Wisdom of the District: Unemployment Insurance
Funding for the federal emergency unemployment insurance program ended in December, and leaders in Washington are debating extending the federal program on an emergency basis.
The Senate is currently considering legislation to extend the benefits.
Similar legislation could come to the House in the coming weeks.
Most states, including Virginia, provide up to 26 weeks of state-funded jobless benefits. The duration of federal emergency unemployment benefits is then based on each states unemployment rate.
For certain states the federal program provided up to 47 weeks of benefits (Virginians were eligible for 14 additional weeks because the Commonwealth has a lower than average unemployment rate).
Given the current state of the economy, do you believe federal unemployment insurance should be extended?
( ) Yes, but only with a budgetary offset or "pay for" to make up the cost and a commitment from Congress and the President to pass bills to create private sector jobs.
( ) Yes, even without a budgetary offset or "pay for".
Americans are still trying to recover from the recession and have lost critical benefits to provide for their families while they look for a job.
( ) No.
Extending federal unemployment insurance would hurt the economy and hurt job creation.
( ) No.
Even if extending unemployment insurance is a good idea, we simply cannot afford it.
( ) I have another answer.
