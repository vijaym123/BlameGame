FEMA Informational Meeting on Essex County Flood Maps - Tuesday, April 29th
Friday, April 25, 2014
Dear Friend,
Following a recent redrawing of the Essex County flood maps and statutory changes to the program, some local residents have been understandably confused and concerned when they learned their flood insurance costs will be rising. Having heard from and spoken to many local residents and business owners, I have been in constant contact with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which has jurisdiction over such matters. Families and small businesses who may still see increases despite the recent changes to flood insurance legislation deserve the opportunity to ask questions, learn about FEMA&rsquo;s decisions, and find out about available options.
That&rsquo;s why I asked FEMA to come to Essex County, answer your questions, and listen to your feedback. The meeting will take place on
Tuesday, April 29th from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. in Newbury . I encourage you and your neighbors to take this opportunity to speak directly with FEMA representatives who will focus on addressing your specific concerns. Representatives from my office will also be in attendance.
I will continue working in Congress to press House and Senate Leadership to immediately address these issues by urging them to remedy these unintended consequences of recent flood insurance reform legislation. Should you have questions about the meeting, please contact David Coleman in my office at 978-531-1669.
