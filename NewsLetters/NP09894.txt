News from Representative Richard Nugent
Dear Friends,
It's been a particularly busy week for me up in Washington, so I'll try
to get through everything as swiftly as possible.
First order of business - I was asked to bring the resolution to the
House floor holding Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress for her refusal
to testify regarding her role in the IRS targeting scandal.
For anybody who may not remember the chronology, over a year ago, Ms.
Lerner (a senior official at the IRS), became aware that an IRS
Inspector General report citing numerous instances of inappropriate
targeting of conservative groups was about to be released. Ms. Lerner,
speaking at an industry conference allegedly planted somebody in the
crowd to ask her about the situation. In response to that question, Ms.
Lerner acknowledged that inappropriate behavior had taken place and
that the issue had been addressed. in other words, 'nothing to see
here'.
Well, that set off a firestorm. Sure enough, a few days later the IG's
report came out and the nation found out that numerous employees within
the IRS had been screening applications for groups with Tea Party
sounding names and subjecting them to unbelievable levels of scrutiny.
Some were allegedly even asked for the minutes of their meetings and so
forth. All told, dozens and dozens of conservative leaning groups were
subjected to months of delays and so forth. The key takeaway - a
powerful federal agency, perhaps the most feared out of them all, used
its power to punish critics of the President.
The shock and outrage were widespread. The loss of trust among the
American people was even broader. Adding insult to injury, the Justice
Department then selected an attorney who'd donated over $6,000 to
Obama's campaign and the DNC to head the investigation. For somebody
like me, that is wholly unacceptable. I don't care which party was
targeted, or whose administration did the targeting. In a free country,
this kind of behavior cannot and will not be tolerated.
The specific issue with Ms. Lerner is that she was subpoenaed and
ordered to appear before the House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee. When Ms. Lerner appeared, she offered an opening statement
in which she asserted her innocence, made seventeen separate factual
assertions and the refused to answer any questions, citing her 5th
Amendment protections from self-incrimination.
To be sure, the 5th Amendment is a sacred right in this country.
According to the Constitution, you cannot be forced to incriminate
yourself. That is a fundamental and important tenant of our legal
system. But you can't use that protection selectively. You can't make
factual assertions professing your innocence and then refuse to allow
questions about those assertions. Over the course of a year, Ms.
Lerner's refusal to answer those questions (despite talking to two
other government agencies) resulted in a resolution holding her in
contempt of Congress.
Personally, I think the American people have been done a disservice
over the course of this whole process. Both sides, in my opinion, have
let partisan bickering cloud the deeper issue. What happened was
shockingly unacceptable. Both sides should be focused on finding out
what happened, who was responsible, and holding them to account. This
kind of thing can never be allowed to happen. If we let it slide, it
opens the door to a form of government abuse that I don't think any
Americans want to see.
So that's that. The House found Ms. Lerner in contempt. What happens
next, including potential jail time will be up to a Grand Jury and the
courts. For now, the House has stated its findings.
The second thing I wanted to flag from this week is the establishment
of a Special Committee to investigate what happened in Benghazi. As has
been the case with the IRS targeting scandal, Fast and Furious, and a
handful of other high profile scandals, the White House has refused to
provide documents, witnesses, corrections for the record, and so forth.
Here again, when we had a United States ambassador and three other
American personnel killed, one would think this would be a bipartisan
issue. But I think Democrats in Congress feel like digging into these
issues is a direct attack on President Obama. I don't view my role as a
member of Congress that way - and neither does the Constitution.
I frankly don't care which party is in charge, Congress has a
responsibility to be a check on the Executive Branch. If the President
oversteps his bounds or fails the country in some way, it is the
responsibility of the Legislative Branch to conduct oversight and to
hold the President accountable to the people. This was pretty
fundamental to the Founders. So when a party - either party - decides
that personal and political loyalty is more important than effective
oversight, we have a big problem. Both sides have been guilty of that
over time.
But take a situation like what happened in Benghazi, or the IRS
targeting, or what's been going on with the wrongful deaths at the VA.
When a tragedy like that occurs, we have a responsibility to pursue the
facts and to shine a light on what happened so that it never, ever
happens again. All of us are accountable to the citizens of this
country. Whether you hold elected office, are appointed by the
president, or are a career civil servant, we are all accountable to the
people. Period. So when things like this happen and nobody is
disciplined and documents are withheld from the people's
representatives, further steps must be taken. We cannot let things like
this go unanswered. If we do, things like this will keep happening.
So if it takes a contempt citation, so be it. If it requires a Special
Committee to investigate, we'll do that too. Do I think it should have
ever come to this? I certainly do not. And I sincerely wish it hadn't
come to this. But when push comes to shove, our responsibility is to
the American people and that's where the discussion starts and stops.
That's about it for now. I've got more to report on the Defense
Authorization that the House Armed Services Committee marked up this
week as well as a few other items, but we should have some time next
week to discuss that.
As always, if there is anything my staff or I can do to be of service,
please let me know.
Thanks again.
Sincerely,
Rich Nugent
Member of Congress

News
from
Representative
Richard
Nugent
Dear
Friends,
It&#8217;s
been
a
particularly
busy
week
for
me
up
in
Washington,
so
I&#8217;ll
try
to
get
through
everything
as
swiftly
as
possible.
First
order
of
business
-
I
was
asked
to
bring
the
resolution
to
the
House
floor
holding
Lois
Lerner
in
contempt
of
Congress
for
her
refusal
to
testify
regarding
her
role
in
the
IRS
targeting
scandal.
For
anybody
who
may
not
remember
the
chronology,
over
a
year
ago,
Ms.
Lerner
(a
senior
official
at
the
IRS),
became
aware
that
an
IRS
Inspector
General
report
citing
numerous
instances
of
inappropriate
targeting
of
conservative
groups
was
about
to
be
released.
Ms.
Lerner,
speaking
at
an
industry
conference
allegedly
planted
somebody
in
the
crowd
to
ask
her
about
the
situation.
In
response
to
that
question,
Ms.
Lerner
acknowledged
that
inappropriate
behavior
had
taken
place
and
that
the
issue
had
been
addressed&#8230;
in
other
words,
&#8216;nothing
to
see
here&#8217;.
Well,
that
set
off
a
firestorm.
Sure
enough,
a
few
days
later
the
IG&#8217;s
report
came
out
and
the
nation
found
out
that
numerous
employees
within
the
IRS
had
been
screening
applications
for
groups
with
Tea
Party
sounding
names
and
subjecting
them
to
unbelievable
levels
of
scrutiny.
Some
were
allegedly
even
asked
for
the
minutes
of
their
meetings
and
so
forth.
All
told,
dozens
and
dozens
of
conservative
leaning
groups
were
subjected
to
months
of
delays
and
so
forth.
The
key
takeaway
-
a
powerful
federal
agency,
perhaps
the
most
feared
out
of
them
all,
used
its
power
to
punish
critics
of
the
President.
The
shock
and
outrage
were
widespread.
The
loss
of
trust
among
the
American
people
was
even
broader.
Adding
insult
to
injury,
the
Justice
Department
then
selected
an
attorney
who&#8217;d
donated
over
$6,000
to
Obama&#8217;s
campaign
and
the
DNC
to
head
the
investigation.
For
somebody
like
me,
that
is
wholly
unacceptable.
I
don&#8217;t
care
which
party
was
targeted,
or
whose
administration
did
the
targeting.
In
a
free
country,
this
kind
of
behavior
cannot
and
will
not
be
tolerated.
The
specific
issue
with
Ms.
Lerner
is
that
she
was
subpoenaed
and
ordered
to
appear
before
the
House
Oversight
and
Government
Reform
Committee.
When
Ms.
Lerner
appeared,
she
offered
an
opening
statement
in
which
she
asserted
her
innocence,
made
seventeen
separate
factual
assertions
and
the
refused
to
answer
any
questions,
citing
her
5th
Amendment
protections
from
self-incrimination.
To
be
sure,
the
5th
Amendment
is
a
sacred
right
in
this
country.
According
to
the
Constitution,
you
cannot
be
forced
to
incriminate
yourself.
That
is
a
fundamental
and
important
tenant
of
our
legal
system.
But
you
can&#8217;t
use
that
protection
selectively.
You
can&#8217;t
make
factual
assertions
professing
your
innocence
and
then
refuse
to
allow
questions
about
those
assertions.
Over
the
course
of
a
year,
Ms.
Lerner&#8217;s
refusal
to
answer
those
questions
(despite
talking
to
two
other
government
agencies)
resulted
in
a
resolution
holding
her
in
contempt
of
Congress.
Personally,
I
think
the
American
people
have
been
done
a
disservice
over
the
course
of
this
whole
process.
Both
sides,
in
my
opinion,
have
let
partisan
bickering
cloud
the
deeper
issue.
What
happened
was
shockingly
unacceptable.
Both
sides
should
be
focused
on
finding
out
what
happened,
who
was
responsible,
and
holding
them
to
account.
This
kind
of
thing
can
never
be
allowed
to
happen.
If
we
let
it
slide,
it
opens
the
door
to
a
form
of
government
abuse
that
I
don&#8217;t
think
any
Americans
want
to
see.
So
that&#8217;s
that.
The
House
found
Ms.
Lerner
in
contempt.
What
happens
next,
including
potential
jail
time
will
be
up
to
a
Grand
Jury
and
the
courts.
For
now,
the
House
has
stated
its
findings.
The
second
thing
I
wanted
to
flag
from
this
week
is
the
establishment
of
a
Special
Committee
to
investigate
what
happened
in
Benghazi.
As
has
been
the
case
with
the
IRS
targeting
scandal,
Fast
and
Furious,
and
a
handful
of
other
high
profile
scandals,
the
White
House
has
refused
to
provide
documents,
witnesses,
corrections
for
the
record,
and
so
forth.
Here
again,
when
we
had
a
United
States
ambassador
and
three
other
American
personnel
killed,
one
would
think
this
would
be
a
bipartisan
issue.
But
I
think
Democrats
in
Congress
feel
like
digging
into
these
issues
is
a
direct
attack
on
President
Obama.
I
don&#8217;t
view
my
role
as
a
member
of
Congress
that
way
&#8211;
and
neither
does
the
Constitution.
I
frankly
don&#8217;t
care
which
party
is
in
charge,
Congress
has
a
responsibility
to
be
a
check
on
the
Executive
Branch.
If
the
President
oversteps
his
bounds
or
fails
the
country
in
some
way,
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
Legislative
Branch
to
conduct
oversight
and
to
hold
the
President
accountable
to
the
people.
This
was
pretty
fundamental
to
the
Founders.
So
when
a
party
&#8211;
either
party
&#8211;
decides
that
personal
and
political
loyalty
is
more
important
than
effective
oversight,
we
have
a
big
problem.
Both
sides
have
been
guilty
of
that
over
time.
But
take
a
situation
like
what
happened
in
Benghazi,
or
the
IRS
targeting,
or
what&#8217;s
been
going
on
with
the
wrongful
deaths
at
the
VA.
When
a
tragedy
like
that
occurs,
we
have
a
responsibility
to
pursue
the
facts
and
to
shine
a
light
on
what
happened
so
that
it
never,
ever
happens
again.
All
of
us
are
accountable
to
the
citizens
of
this
country.
Whether
you
hold
elected
office,
are
appointed
by
the
president,
or
are
a
career
civil
servant,
we
are
all
accountable
to
the
people.
Period.
So
when
things
like
this
happen
and
nobody
is
disciplined
and
documents
are
withheld
from
the
people&#8217;s
representatives,
further
steps
must
be
taken.
We
cannot
let
things
like
this
go
unanswered.
If
we
do,
things
like
this
will
keep
happening.
So
if
it
takes
a
contempt
citation,
so
be
it.
If
it
requires
a
Special
Committee
to
investigate,
we&#8217;ll
do
that
too.
Do
I
think
it
should
have
ever
come
to
this?
I
certainly
do
not.
And
I
sincerely
wish
it
hadn&#8217;t
come
to
this.
But
when
push
comes
to
shove,
our
responsibility
is
to
the
American
people
and
that&#8217;s
where
the
discussion
starts
and
stops.
That&#8217;s
about
it
for
now.
I&#8217;ve
got
more
to
report
on
the
Defense
Authorization
that
the
House
Armed
Services
Committee
marked
up
this
week
as
well
as
a
few
other
items,
but
we
should
have
some
time
next
week
to
discuss
that.
As
always,
if
there
is
anything
my
staff
or
I
can
do
to
be
of
service,
please
let
me
know.
Thanks
again.
Sincerely, Rich
Nugent Member
of
Congress
