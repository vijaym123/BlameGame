Dear friend,
This week, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral
arguments in a landmark case that will help decide the future of
religious freedom in America.
The justices are weighing the
constitutionality of one of the most controversial aspects of Obamacare - the
requirement that employers must provide birth control and abortifacients
to their employees, even if doing so violates their deeply-held
religious beliefs.
The main case
centers around Hobby Lobby, an arts-and-crafts chain based in Oklahoma
City that is run on biblical principles.
For example, they
close on Sundays and refuse to sell shot glasses.
They object to the
life-terminating drugs and devices required under the Obamacare
mandate (better known as the HHS mandate) on religious grounds. And yet,
if they dont follow the mandate, they are facing annual fines of
$36,500 per employee, which comes out to nearly $657 million per year. A
lower court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby.
Now, the U.S. Supreme
Court will make the final call.
Their ruling is expected in
June.
Of all the horrendous aspects
of Obamacare, the HHS mandate is one of the worst.
Where does the
federal government get the nerve to tell people they must spend money
on something they find morally objectionable, such as
abortifacients?
There is nothing in the Constitution
not even in the
much-abused Commerce Clause
that would lead someone to that
conclusion.
This is the madness of
Obamacare: Not only is the federal government requiring people to buy
something for the first time in American history, they are requiring
businesses and individuals to buy specific types of insurance, even if it
violates their conscience.
No
American should be forced to choose between following their faith and
submitting to unlawful and unnecessary government mandates.
Those of us who support Hobby Lobby
and the
scores of other companies that have challenged the mandate in court
simply want to reestablish what was
up until recently
the status quo
in America: freedom of conscience, and more specifically, the freedom
to live according to our religious values, without being penalized by a
power-mad government.
Americans dont give up their freedom
when they open a family business.
Every day, Obamacare is unraveling before our eyes.
Just this
week, the President announced another major delay in the laws
implementation.
Were now at 10 major delays since the law took effect
all of them done without Congressional approval (a full list of the
delays can be found
here ).
I will continue to
oppose Obamacare because its one of the most economically and
socially destructive laws in U.S. history.
And I will continue to stand
for religious freedom, because it is truly the first freedom and
one of the key pillars of the American Dream.
I expect the Supreme Court will see it that way
too.
