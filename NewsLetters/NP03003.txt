The State of the
Union
(Click on image to
play)
Comprehensive fiscal reforms and
economic growth should top the list of priorities for the President
and Congress over the next two years.
The debt crisis is the most
pressing issue currently facing the nation, and the next two years
present an opportunity for the President to work with Congress to
implement much-needed fiscal reforms.
There is no question that our
nations burgeoning debt crisis continues tostrain the economy and the
countrys fiscal future.
Our national debt, now surpassing a
staggering $18 TRILLION, has grown close to 70 percent since the President
assumed office.
Absent action, this dangerous and unsustainable
level of debt poses a threat to our national security.
Over
time, the interest payments on the debt, which provide no benefits or
services toany Americans, will soon threaten the federal governments
ability to meet its most basic functions.
The President proposed several initiatives
during his sixth State of the Union address which would further increase
federal spending.
These proposals lacked specifics on how to pay
for these programs without adding to the deficit or increasing taxes
on hard-working Americans.
Idahoans and Americans overwhelmingly
want leaders who are committed to free enterprise and limited
government, not a continuation of the last six years irresponsible tax and
spend policies.
We must prioritize fundamental tax reform focused
on growth through lowering overall rates and compliance costs that
will enable job creation.
We would be hard-pressed to create a more
expensive system to comply with, unfair, inefficient and
anti-competitive tax code than our current code.
At the same time, we must
also address the impending insolvency of our entitlement programs,
which remain the biggest drivers of our national
debt.
Areas that are ripe for bipartisan action include
job creation, improving our economic outlook, reducing the regulatory
burden on small businesses and finding fixes for our broken health
care system.
It is long past time for the President to deliver on
his promise to work with Congress in meaningful ways to confront the
many serious challenges facing our
nation.
Stop Federal Education
Mandates
On January 9, I introduced the
Local Leadership in Education Act, which amends the federal
Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA).
This common-sense
legislation will prohibit curriculum, testing and standards (among others)
overreach by the Federal Government into the important work of educating
students.
The removal of these requirements would permit states
to choose how and when to measure student performance and
growth.
The federal government must not be a national school board.
Too often, state and local educators spend too much time dealing with
federal mandates when it is local leaders who know whats best for their
students.
Decisions closer to the classroom are more focused on
the specific circumstances and needs of individual students rather
than a one-size-fits-all approach promulgated by bureaucrats in
Washington, D.C.
The federal government can be a willing partner in
funding education; however, it should not pressure states through
funding and relief from outmoded federal policies to adopt academic
standards.

Hot
Topics: 114 th
Congress
Federal Regulations:
I
joined my colleague Senator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) to introduce
legislation to curb the explosive growth of federal regulations coming out of
Washington.
Estimates are that burdens on small businesses to
comply with existing bureaucratic red tape come in at around $2 trillion
per year.
S. 226, the Regulations from the Executive In Need of
Scrutiny (REINS) Act, would require proposed rules and regulations
put out by federal agencies to carry an estimated bill of at least $100
million if put into effect; congressional approval is needed before
that happens.
Current law exempts many agency regulations from
congressional oversight, which means that Congress has to overturn the
rule with a joint resolution of disapproval, which the President can
veto.
This should be flip-flopped for the benefit of all.
The
REINS Act would require a joint resolution of approval before any
major rule could be finalized, increasing much-needed transparency in the
federal rulemaking process.
Currently, the federal rulemaking
structure lets federal agencies operate with tremendous autonomy withno
real congressional oversight.
The result is that agencies
propose and finalize thousands of regulations each year--many of them
controversial--without a full public discussion or involvement, or
disclosure of the data supporting a rule.

National Monuments:
In advance of the President acting unilaterally to designate new
national monument over the course of the next two years, I introduced
legislation to limit presidential power related to the designation of
national monuments.
S. 228, the National Monument Designation
Transparency and Accountability Act, would require congressional
approval before any new national monument designations are finalized.
The measure also requires that any state in which a proposed monument
is located pass authorizing legislation on the designation.
Important land management decisions, especially those with the potential to
have significant impact on our communities, must have local support
and input.
Top-down national monuments designations can result in
severe restrictions on access to public lands and economic disruption
to surrounding communities.
It is critical that states and
affected stakeholders where a monument could be located play a key role
and have a voice in the decision-making process.

Second Amendment
Rights:
This week, I introduced legislation to
reaffirm the Second Amendment rights of Idahoans.
The legislation
makes firearm regulations consistent across all federal lands by
allowing law-abiding citizens to carry firearms on U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (Corps) property.
Under current law, a person may carry a
concealed weapon in a National Park or Refuge as long as individuals
comply with the firearm laws of the parks home state.
However, the
same rights are not extended to Americans who hunt, camp or fish on
Corps lands, effectively denying them of their Second Amendment
freedoms guaranteed under the Constitution when on Corps lands.
