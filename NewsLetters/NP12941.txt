Dear Friend,
On Wednesday, I voted against the massive $1.1 trillion Omnibus
Spending Bill.
I was sent to Congress to cut spending and work toward a balanced
budget, not increase spending and balloon our national debt, as this
bill does. Your share of the national debt is already more than
$54,000.00, so voting against this bill was a no-brainer.
This bill was conceived in a flawed process that exemplifies
dysfunctional Washington. Its 1,582 pages were written behind closed
doors and we were given just 48 hours to read it. It is irresponsible
to vote on enormous bills no one had time to read. When it comes to
rushing bills through Congress, ObamaCare taught us an important
lesson: we must demand time to air out legislation and have a
conversation with you, the people who elected us.
This bill also screws Western states, which depend on PILT (Payment in
Lieu of Taxes) resources for schools and infrastructure in rural areas,
as well as police and fire operations. Since federally owned lands are
non-taxable, the PILT program was established to replace the property
tax revenue local governments would receive were the lands privately
owned. There is no solution in this bill; there is only a nonbinding
promise that somehow, someway Western states will receive this vital
funding in the future. This is bad for the West and bad for Arizona.
Finally, I am troubled by the priorities in this bill. It cuts
resources to border enforcement and embassy security - two of the few
areas where we need increased funding - yet increases funding to
wasteful and controversial programs.

You Have a Right to Know What's Happening With Your Healthcare
On Thursday, I voted in favor of the Exchange Information Disclosure
Act, legislation that requires the Administration to submit weekly
reports that detail the performance of healthcare.gov.
Americans have a right to know what's happening with their healthcare
system and Congress has a constitutional duty to oversee the
administration. Congress and the American people have received only a
trickle of information about ObamaCare, and only the information the
Obama Administration chose to share with us. We must have access to all
of the facts so that we can make informed decisions on how to mitigate
the damage this disastrous law is inflicting. Click HERE

Protecting Unborn Children
There were two developments this week in regard to abortion.
First, on Thursday I announced my sponsorship of the No Taxpayer
Funding for Abortion Act, legislation that would make the Hyde
Amendment, which prohibits taxpayer-funded abortions, a permanent law
and end funding for abortion insurance coverage in ObamaCare.
This bill permanently protects unborn babies from death by
taxpayer-funded abortion. I am proud to co-sponsor this life-saving
legislation. Click HERE
to
read more.
Second, the Supreme Court on Monday decided not to review the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling that held unconstitutional an Arizona
law protecting the lives of babies 20 weeks and older, effectively
striking down the law.
The spurious legacy of Roe continues unabated. This is more than a
legal issue; it's an issue of life or death for unborn babies. This law
struck a balance that protected women who wanted to terminate their
babies' lives, while also keeping older babies from feeling the
excruciating pain of death by abortion. I am appalled and dismayed that
the Supreme Court of the United States is blocking Arizona's ability to
protect its children. Click HERE

Meeting with Students
On Friday, students of the East Valley Institute of Technology (EVIT)
interviewed me on a range of topics, from the FARRM Bill to genetically
modified organisms (GMOs). They are a smart group and will have great
futures.
(Rep. Gosar meeting with EVIT students, January 17, 2014)
ObamaCare Malady of the Week
28,000: the number of Arizonans who signed up for health insurance on
the ObamaCare exchange from October 1 to December 31. To put that
number in perspective, Arizona has 6.5 million residents, which means
that just four-tenths of one percent of Arizonans signed up for
ObamaCare. Click HERE

more.
Did You Know?
Bagdad, AZ is one of the only company towns left in Arizona. All of the
homes and businesses are owned by Freeport-McMoRan, which also owns the
nearby copper mine. Though the source of the town's name is unknown,
one theory holds that it comes from a father-son team of gold miners.
When the son was finished filling a bag, he would pass it to his dad by
saying, "Bag, Dad." Others think it is just a misspelling of Baghdad,
Iraq.

Dear
Friend,
On
Wednesday,
I
voted
against
the
massive
$1.1

Omnibus
Spending
Bill.
I
was
sent
to
Congress
to
cut
spending
and
work
toward
a
balanced
budget,
not
increase
spending
and
balloon
our
national
debt,
as
this
bill
does. Your
share
of
the
national
debt
is
already
more
than
$54,000.00,
so
voting
against
this
bill
was
a
no-brainer.
This
bill was
conceived
in
a
flawed
process
that
exemplifies
dysfunctional
Washington.
Its
1,582
pages
were
written
behind
closed
doors
and
we
were
given
just
48
hours
to
read
it. It
is
irresponsible
to
vote
on
enormous
bills

When
it
comes

ObamaCare

we
must
demand

This
bill
also
screws
Western
states,
which

resources
for
schools

as
well
as

Since

non-taxable,
the
PILT
program
was
established
to
replace
the
property
tax
revenue
local
governments

This
is
bad

Finally,
I
