Walberg Gets to Work in New Congress
This week I was sworn in for a 4th term. I'm honored the people of Michigan's 7th District have once again entrusted me with the opportunity to be their voice in Congress. We immediately got to work voting on legislation that will boost job creation, provide relief from Obamacare, increase Americas energy security, and create more job opportunities for veterans.
