Back Away from Our C-130Js
Today marks a great victory for Keesler Air Force Base and South Missisippi.
After many strong efforts, the Air Force has now abandoned any and all plans to deactivate the 815th Tactical Airlift squadron and transfer the squadron's C-130Js to another state.
For more than three years, I have fought the Air Force on their decision to remove the 10 C-130Js from Keesler Air Force Base.
Upon finding out about their plans to do so, I began working tirelessly alongside Senator Cochran and Senator Wicker to ensure that this would never become a reality.
From the very beginning, the decision to move these aircrafts made no sense, fiscally or otherwise. Time and time again, I demanded the Air Force provide adequate justification for relocating our C-130Js. Through support of language within the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act, we were able to halt the plan to move forward with the relocation until a detailed explanation could be provided.
Today the Air Force made the right decision to keep our C-130Js at Keesler Air Force Base in South Mississippi, right where they belong.
