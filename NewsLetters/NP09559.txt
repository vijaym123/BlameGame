Recapping another
successful Offshore Energy Tour
Offshore energy is a
vital part to both Louisianas economy
and our national security. American energy exploration incorporates
unparalleled safety standards, ingenuity in implementing these
massive-scale projects, and cutting-edge technology involved in producing
energy from the deep waters.
The offshore energy industry also
provides hard workers with good paying jobs.
Last week, I took four
of my Congressional colleagues, Michele Bachmann, Susan Brooks, Mark
Sanford and Steve Womack, to south Louisiana to get an up-close and
personal look at how American energy is produced on
my fifth annual offshore energy tour.
The delegation met with industry leaders, toured a
deepwater production platform, flew over Port Fourchon, discussed revenue
sharing along with its important role in coastal restoration, and met
employees and business owners involved in offshore production.
Ill continue fighting to promote an all-of-the-above energy strategy,
not just in the thriving oil and gas industry the Gulf of Mexico, but
also in other parts of the country.

Volunteering and honoring our
heroes
After the Offshore Energy Tour, I had
the privilege of visiting the Greenwalt Center in Kenner, which is run
by Catholic Charities' PACE program.
Volunteering is such a
rewarding experience for me, and I had the opportunity to learn about how
Catholic Charities serves seniors in the First District.
I
admire the work they do day-in and day-out on behalf of those who need a
helping hand.
I also attended the opening ceremonies for the
Vietnam Memorial's "Moving Wall" at Veterans Park, also in Kenner.
This tribute to our fallen heroes is an important way to commemorate the
ultimate sacrifice they made for the freedoms we enjoy
today.
It is an honor to represent you in
Congress. For more information please visit my
