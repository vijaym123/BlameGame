The Hill Report
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of January 20 - 24, 2014
This week, I enjoyed spending time in North Texas during the District
Work Week.
As always, I value the opportunity to discuss the important
issues facing our nation and community with the people of the 32nd
Congressional District.
I participated in several events and
constituent meetings this week, a few of which I have highlighted
below.
F-35 Demonstration in Wylie
On Tuesday, I attended Lockheed Martin's F-35 Lightning II mobile
cockpit demonstrator at Savage Precision Fabrication, Inc. in Wylie.
Savage Precision Fabrication operates a 60,000 square foot
manufacturing facility in North Texas that produces materials that play
a critical role in providing our military with the most capable and
superior technology in the world.
Congressman Sessions visiting the
Savage Precision Fabrication facility
The F-35 program has made more than a $5.3 billion impact across Texas
and has created over 40,000 direct and indirect jobs in our state.
I
was glad to receive an update on the status of the program and to learn
more about the North Texas suppliers, like Savage Precision
Fabrication, that are instrumental to the F-35 program.
Greater East Dallas Chamber of Commerce
Also on Tuesday, I attended the Greater East Dallas Chamber of Commerce
luncheon to discuss the current state of the economy and my work in
Congress to support job creation, entrepreneurship, and the free
enterprise system. This Congress, House Republicans have passed dozens
of jobs bills that would help spur economic growth, such as building
the Keystone XL Pipeline and reducing burdensome red-tape.
Unfortunately, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid continues to ignore
our pro-growth ideas and refuses to allow votes on these bills in the
Senate.
Congressman Sessions with the past chairmen of the
Greater East Dallas Chamber of Commerce
In addition to my remarks at the event, I was honored to present the
Chamber's "Pete Sessions Leadership Award" to Roger Perry, who served
as the Chairman from 2011-2013. Roger has displayed an extraordinary
level of volunteerism through his work with the Chamber and he is a
great example of a leader.
Health Care Meetings
One of my top priorities in Congress is to repeal ObamaCare because it
is bad for our economy, bad for job creation, and bad for our health
care system.
After ObamaCare is repealed, I believe we should replace
it with common-sense reform that actually reduces costs, increases
access to quality care, and restores the sanctity of the doctor-patient
relationship.
Congressman Sessions meeting with the Dallas - Fort Worth Hospital
Council
I regularly visit with doctors and medical professionals to hear their
ideas for health care reform and the challenges they face due to
ObamaCare's new rules and regulations.
This week I was delighted to
meet with the Dallas-Fort Worth Hospital Council and medical staff from
Methodist Richardson Medical Center to learn their views on ObamaCare
and learn about the effect it has had on hospitals, doctors, and
patients.
Sachse High School Visit
Today, I had the opportunity to speak to a senior government class at
Sachse High School.
After my remarks, I took questions from the
students regarding my work as a Member of Congress, the role of the
federal government, and other issues they are learning about in their
class. It is always great to hear from young people in our community
and listen to their thoughts and views on the important policy debates
occurring on a local, state, and national level.
Congressman Sessions speaking with the Sachse High School
Senior Government class
Have a good weekend.
Sincerely,
Pete Sessions
Member of Congress

Greater

Also
on
Tuesday,
I
attended
the
Greater

luncheon
to
discuss
the
current
state
of
the
economy
and
my
