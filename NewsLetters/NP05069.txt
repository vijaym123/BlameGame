CHICAGO BREAKING NEWS: Right-wing Super PAC launches last-minute ad campaign against Brad Schneider
David -- this could change EVERYTHING.
We just learned a SEVENTH outside group -- run by another Dold billionaire backer -- has launched a MASSIVE last-minute ad buy against Brad. Here&rsquo;s the deal:
Polls say we&rsquo;re TIED. There&rsquo;s only 8 days left. And if this final barrage of attacks works, we will lose.
Period.
Our FINAL WEEK ad buy deadline is TOMORROW -- it&rsquo;s our last chance to set the record straight for Brad.
So David, stop what you&rsquo;re doing, chip in for Brad, and help keep the Tea Party agenda out of Illinois --
for good.
