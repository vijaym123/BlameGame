Promising Valley Fever Drug on Fast
Track
Wonderful news has made its way to my office
and I couldn't be more thrilled to share it with
you!
The University of Arizona's request to designate
the antifungal drug Nikkomycin Z (NikZ) as a qualifying infectious
disease product (QIDP) for use in treating Valley Fever has been granted by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). NikZ is a promising
potentially curative anti-Valley Fever drug. Clinical trials will
begin in late 2015, years earlier than previously estimated.
This is truly a remarkable
accomplishment for the entire Arizona community as well as Valley Fever researchers
and advocates.
Thank you to all of
the individuals who have made this progress possible. Dr. John
Galgiani and the team at Valley Fever Solutions have played a huge role
in pushing this development to the forefront of Valley Fever
research.
You can read
more about their work and this
news, here.
If you have any questions about the
Congressional Valley Fever Task force or my team's work with the GAIN Act, please
call my Washington D.C. staff at (202)
