Rep. Lipinski Accepting Service
Academy Applications
Congressman Lipinski with 2014s service
academy nominees.
Congressman Dan Lipinski is currently
accepting nomination request letters from young men and women in the
Third Congressional District who want to enter one of the U.S. Service
Academies in 2015.
"One of my congressional duties that I cherish the
most is helping young men and women pursue their goal of serving our
nation by entering one of our military service academies," Rep.
Lipinski said.
"It is an honor and privilege to be able to nominate
outstanding young leaders who want to serve others.
I encourage
those who are interested to begin a process that could truly change
their lives and the future of our
nation."
The service academies include:
Air Force Academy ,
Colorado Springs, CO
Naval Academy , Annapolis,
MD
West Point Military
Academy , West Point, NY
Merchant Marine Academy , Kings Point,
NY
Coast Guard Academy
admissions are based on a
nationwide competition with no Congressional
nominations.
Potential candidates must have reached their 17th birthday and not
passed their 23rd birthday on July 1st of the year they would enter the
academy, be a United States citizen, have graduated from high school, be
unmarried, have taken the ACT and/or SAT, and have met the stringent
entrance requirements of their preferred
academy.
The selection of nominees is based upon a whole person
evaluation.
Although nominations will not be made until January of 2015, all
interested persons are encouraged to submit their written requests as
soon as possible.
The deadline for completed files is December 1,
2014.
Nomination requests can be submitted to Rep. Lipinskis
office at 6245 S. Archer Ave., Chicago, IL, 60638.
The phone
number is 312-886-0481.
Rep. Lipinski Leads Effort that
Halts
Administration Proposal that Would Have Been
Harmful to
American Manufacturers
"Sometimes Washington does things that seem so crazy you wonder
if people making these decisions are simply out of touch with reality
or whether they are purposely trying to make life more difficult for
most Americans," stated Congressman Dan Lipinski.
"The latest
example comes from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
Earlier this year, the OMB came out with a proposal to create a new
classification for some American businesses.
These businesses were now
going to be labeled as 'factoryless goods producers.'
How does a
company produce goods without a factory?
Simple, they contract
out their production to factories outside of the country.
Apple,
for example, contracts with FoxConn to manufacture the iPhone in
massive plants in China.
If this nonsensical idea from the OMB was
implemented, it would mean that Apple was counted a 'factoryless goods
producer,' and all these iPhones would likely have been counted as
American made.
This would have had a great impact on government
data, distorting the number of American manufacturing jobs, and could
have put real American manufacturers
the ones with American factories
employing American workers
at a further disadvantage in competing
with foreigners."
