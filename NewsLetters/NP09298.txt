June Town Hall Meetings
Dear Friend,
Starting next week, I am holding eight town hall meetings across
Oregon's First Congressional District. You are all invited to attend
and bring friends and neighbors to discuss issues of importance.
At the meetings, I will talk about my work in D.C. and in Oregon, and
I'll answer your questions. Members of my staff will be available to
meet individually with anyone who is experiencing problems with federal
agencies.
I look forward to hearing from you and discussing how I can best help
Oregon's First Congressional District grow and succeed. A full list of
the town hall meetings is below. You can also find it on my website
and Facebook
page.

COMMENT:
To
allow

this
template
is
built
with
a
series
of
tables
stacked
upon
each
other
without
a
wrapper
or

COMMENT:
The
font
declarations
include
fonts
that
are
compatible
with
Linux,
Apple
and
Windows
operating
systems
COMMENT:
This
table
is
here
for
the
soul
purpose
of
explaining
the
template
components.
COMMENT:
You
should
(or
-
you
may
wish
to)
remove
this
table
before
publishing.
It
is
here
to
offer
suggestions
on

COMMENT:
If
tables
have
borders,
they
are
visible
only
as
a
mechanism
to
make
them
easier
to
see
or
for
demonstration
purposes.
Use
borders
sparingly
in
your
design.
COMMENT:
Table
borders
do
not
always
align
well
and
should
be
set
to
zero
before
publishing
unless
the
design
is
very
simple
and
is
pleasing
with
borders.
COMMENT:
This
template
used
tables
instead
of
DIVs
(Divisions)
so
that
it
is
compatible
with
all
browsers
new,
old
and

A
table
is
arranged
in
the
following
order...
COMMENT:
TABLE
COMMENT:
TBODY
-
optional
(table
body
is
used
to
group
the
parts
of
a
table
with
a
header,

you

COMMENT:
TR

this

COMMENT:
Style
concepts:
Tables
carry
NO
style
declarations.
Only
declare
border,
cellspacing,
width,
bgcolor
(background
color)
and
alignment
attributes
to
a
table.
Think
of
the
table
as
providing
the
boundary
for
the
enclosed
content
you
place
within
it.
COMMENT:
Style
can
be
added
to
the
TD
tag
(table
data)
or
"cell/column"
within
a
table.
COMMENT:
This
will
help
simplify
the
styling
of
the
content
within
the
table.
COMMENT:
The
TD
is
where
you
can
declare
a
default
font-family,
font-size,
color
(this
applies
to
the
font
only),
text-alignment
(left/right/centered)
and
a
valign
(alignment
of
the
content
from
top/middle/bottom
of
the
TD
cell.
COMMENT:
By
declaring
a
default
style
on
the
TD,
you
avoid
the
need
to
apply
a
style
to
every
paragragh,
DIV
(Division),
header,
or
other
text
in
your
content.
COMMENT:
You
can
override
the
default
TD
style
by
adding
a
style
(bold,
italic,
etc)
to
any
individual
item
(header,
paragraph,
text)
and
it
will
take
priority
over
the
default
style
in
the
TD.
COMMENT:
If
you
examine
the
HTML
code
of
this
COMMENTS
table
you
will
see
how
these
concepts
are
being
applied.
COMMENT:
Things
to
Avoid:
Microsoft's
Outlook
mail
client
in
particular
has
a
variety
of
style,
size
and
table
attributes
that
it
will
not
render.
COMMENT:
Do
not
use
Table
"cellpadding"
or
Style
"margin-padding"
as
both
are
stripped
out
by
Outlook
2007
and
2010.
COMMENT:
Avoid
tables
that
are
more
than
a
single
"page"
(22
inches
or
1500
pixels)
in
height
because
they
will
leave
mysterious
horizontal
gaps
or
blank
areas
between
content
that
otherwise
should
be
above
and
below
in
relation
to
each
other.
COMMENT:
You
can,
however,
stack
shorter
tables
on
top
of
each
other
to
form
one
very
long
series
of
tables
and
avoid
the
page
breaking
problem
in
Outlook.

Things
to
Remember:
Design
for
multiple
platforms
(Windows,
Apple,
Linux,
Mobile).
COMMENT:
This
means
you
design
narrow
tables

less)
to
accommodate
mobile
devices.
COMMENT:
Declare
fonts
with
the

likely

more
common
