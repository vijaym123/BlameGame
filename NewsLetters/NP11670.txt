VIDEO: All Hardworking Americans Deserve Relief From The President's
Health Care Law
This week, the House passed the Simple Fairness Act, a bill that would
afford individuals the same advantage the Administration is giving to
businesses by delaying the individual mandate. It's simply common
sense. I am hopeful that my colleagues in the Senate recognize the
importance of this bill and send it to the President to be signed into
law. Watch the video HERE

VIDEO: The Electricity Security and
Affordability Act
This week I voted in favor of the Electricity Security and
Affordability Act, a bill that would offer a reasonable alternative to
the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) proposed greenhouse gas
standards for new power plants and the agency's planned regulations for
existing power plants. The Electricity Security and Affordability Act
specifically would require that any greenhouse gas standards set by EPA
for new coal-fired plants are able to be achieved by commercial power
plants operating in the real world, including highly efficient plants
that utilize the most modern, state-of-the-art emissions control
technologies. Additionally, this bill would specify that Congress set
the effective date for EPA's expected regulations for existing plants.

Statement Following Ways & Means Committee Hearing With Treasury
Secretary Lew
The President's budget proposal perpetuates the federal government's
record of abiding by a different set of rules than the average
American, in this case, by running up the country's credit card without
regard for the growing balance. It taxes more, spends more, and plunges
our country further into debt. It fails to strengthen our Social
Security and Medicare programs and though it addresses corporate tax
reform, it leaves our small businesses and families behind. I thank
Secretary Lew for testifying before the Committee today, and I am
hopeful that he too recognizes that all hardworking American families
are forced to live within their budgets, it's time that the federal
government does the same.

Weekly Column: It's Time For Tax Reform
Few Americans will dispute that an overhaul of our tax code is long
overdue. According to the National Taxpayer Advocate at the IRS,
Americans collectively spend more than 6 billion hours and
approximately $168 billion each year to file their returns. As a
Certified Public Accountant and former business owner for nearly 30
years, I can attest that our tax code is broken. It is too complex,
contains too many loopholes, and serves as a barrier to job growth.
