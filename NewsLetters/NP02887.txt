Friend
Wanted to share
this great story
with you
about Samantha Jones, a high school senior in New Jersey who successfully fought under God in the pledge at her school. Its important to remember that sometimes the battle isnt won in one mighty blow, but in tiny, measured steps towards victory.
I will keep fighting for the constitutionally protected right to free exercise of religion until every American is confident that they can follow their conscience without fear of consequences.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. I have defended keeping under God in the Pledge of Allegiance in the past, including joining 38 other Members in submitting an
amicus curiae
brief
before the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, urging the Court to uphold the words under God in the Pledge of Allegiance as constitutional.
