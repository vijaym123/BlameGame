This is NOT the email we wanted to send you today.
Yesterday was the final major fundraising deadline of the election.
And we fell short.
As a result, we are making an emergency extension of the triple-match
TODAY ONLY.
**EMERGENCY EXTENSION**
TRIPLE-MATCH STATUS: ACTIVE UNTIL 11:59pm (today only)
It wasn&rsquo;t for lack of trying: we received over 14O,OOO online donations since President Obama emailed you on Friday. That would&rsquo;ve smashed our original goal. But yesterday, we received last-minute news that Republican outside groups were reserving $12 MILLION worth of new television ads to defeat us. There just wasn&rsquo;t enough time to make up that gap.
David -- THIS COULD NOT BE MORE CRITICAL.
We still need 11 donors from 60659 zip code
to make a TRIPLE-MATCHED gift by midnight if we want any chance of victory in this election.
We're pleading. Can you step up right now?
1-DAY MATCH EXTENSION: All Donations Today
Triple-Matched! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
