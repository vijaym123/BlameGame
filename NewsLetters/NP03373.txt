Dear
David,
Recently, I secured
a seat on the House Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure.
As a California Central Coast community, Ventura County has
unique transportation needs that not only impact our quality of life,
but are vital to the regions economic vitality. Thats why I fought so
hard to be able to bring this unique perspective to the highly sought
after Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure.
Ventura Countys diverse transportation infrastructure serves as a
microcosm for the nation. With the only deep water port between Los Angeles
and San Francisco, two small community airports, commuter and freight
rail, a Coast Guard station, and both urban and rural highway and
transit needs, Ventura County transportation needs are not only integral to
the economic vitality of Californias 26th Congressional District
the port and harbors alone account for nearly $1 billion in economic
impact in the region
but to the entire state of
California.
It is an honor and privilege to serve as your voice in
Congress.
Sincereley,
JULIA BROWNLEY
Member of Congress
