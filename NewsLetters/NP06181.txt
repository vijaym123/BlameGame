Dear Fellow
Nevadan,
I am pleased to announce that the Small Business Administration
(SBA), the Department of Health Human and Services, and Small Business
Majority have teamed up for a free weekly webinar series. Any small
business owner or interested party can join these webinars, which will be
hosted on Thursdays.
During each webinar, small business
owners will learn the basics of the Affordable Care Act and what the law
means for their company and employees. Topics of interest
include:
The small business health care tax
credit
The Health Insurance Marketplaces and the Small Business Health
Options Program (SHOP)
Shared responsibility
provisions
Each week, SBA representatives will walk through the
key pieces of the law so that small business owners can understand
the facts to make informed decisions about providing health insurance
for their employees. Below are the registration links for the next six
presentations.
