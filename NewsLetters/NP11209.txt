Passing the farm bill was the first step. The second step is Congressional oversight, which is very important because the bill needs to be implemented as Congress intended.
I told all the farmers and participants at this year's All Ag Celebration in Bird Island, located in Renville County, that I will be working closely with Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack to make sure the programs written in the farm bill are carried out as planned.

Expediting Disability Benefits for Veterans
When our servicemen and women return home, our service to them begins. Every Veteran deserves access to quality care and assistance. That is why I am happy to announce that as of March 17, 2014, veterans who have a VA compensation rating of 100% permanent and total (P&T;) are eligible for expedited processing of applications for Social Security disability benefits. To receive expedited processing, you must identify yourself as a Veteran rated 100% P&T; when applying for Social Security disability benefits and provide your VA Notification letter which verifies you are P&T.;

Specially Adaptive House Grant Eligibility Change
The Department of Veterans Affairs announced that veterans and active-duty military with service-connected amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, are now medically eligible for grants up to $67,555 to adapt their homes. This change will let Servicemembers adapt their homes to match their unique needs. Caring for our Veterans and active-duty soldiers should always be our top priority, so it is good to see the VA make positive steps like this.

West Point Coat of Arms
On March 16th, 1802, Congress founded the United States' first Military Academy for the purpose of training young men in military science. The site of the new academy was West Point, New York. Today, it is simply known as West Point. When the threat of another war with Great Britain started to grow, which became the War of 1812, Congress expanded the military academy's capabilities. During the Civil War, former West Point graduates fought against one another to defend their native states. Today, the academy is under the supervision of the U.S. Army and has an enrollment of more than 4,600 students.
Application to become nominated to a military academy.

NEWSLETTER-MN07: Updates
Marshall Sunday vs. Tuesday
Dear Friends,
While the 2014 Farm Bill has been signed into law, there is still work to do, and I intend to make sure that USDA implements the bill correctly. This week, I spoke with corn
growers in Chippewa County and farmers at the All Ag Celebration in Renville County about how the farm bill will affect their industry. I also visited Northland College to meet with innovators who are making advancements in agriculture technology.
I had a
productive discussion with Bemidji airport commission members on the progress of their expansions and sat down with Litchfield&#8217;s First District Board. In military news, Veterans who are service-connected have two important updates which can be found below.
Sincerely,
[if gte vml 1]>
