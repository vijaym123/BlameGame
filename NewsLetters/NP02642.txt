Bringing 21st Century Cures to Southwest Michigan
Dear Friend,
This week as I was home, I visited Perrigo Company and Stryker Instruments to discuss my 21 st
Century Cures initiative. Launched last year, the 21 st
Century Cures initiative began with the goal of getting cures and treatments to patients more quickly.
21 st
Century Cures also aims to help employers in areas like Southwest Michigan continue to compete and be global leaders in medical innovations
and to keep jobs here at home.
My Democrat colleague, Diana DeGette (D-Colorado), and I spent the past year hosting numerous roundtable discussions and hearing from patients, innovators, researchers, caregivers, and other experts on how to reshape the research and approval process of new cures, treatments, and devices.
Among the meetings held was a bipartisan roundtable at the new Western Michigan University Homer Stryker M.D. School of Medicine. This bipartisan roundtable included an all-star panel of experts including Dr. Francis Collins, Director of the National Institutes of Health. We heard from companies right here in Southwest Michigan about how heavy-handed government regulations are making it harder for them to innovate. As a result, were losing business and talent overseas to places like China.
21 st
Century Cures has the potential to impact not only families around the country, but right here in Southwest Michigan as well. As I saw first-hand at Perrigo and Stryker, it also has the potential to positively impact local-employers and to ensure that Southwest Michigan remains on the cutting edge of medical innovations and breakthroughs.
Ive pledged to continue an aggressive schedule to introduce 21 st
Century Cures legislation and ultimately send a bill to President Obama by the end of the year. Southwest Michigan cannot wait.
