Delay, deny, until you die.
Thats how
one veteran in Missouri
described the frustration veterans experience when they go to the VA for care.
Sadly, he is not alone.
CNN reported last week that at
least
40 patients died while waiting for
appointments
at the Phoenix VA after being placed on a
secret waiting
list
created to hide the fact that 1,400-1,600 veterans were
forced to wait months for appointments. This was not an isolated case:
The House Veterans Affairs Committee has
launched an
investigation
and already uncovered dozens of recent, preventable
deaths at VA hospitals across the country.
I have also
heard from veterans in Floridas 17th district who have faced delayed and
denied treatment.
This week, as a member of the House
Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee and a veteran myself,
I took two significant actions to end the practice of secret waiting
lists, ensure veterans get the care they earned, and hold the VA
accountable.
First, I
wrote a
letter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder
and the state
attorneys general in all 50 states urging them to work
together
to
investigate preventable deaths at VA facilities across the
country and determine appropriate criminal
charges.
For these veterans, treatment delayed is treatment denied, and the
consequences have proved fatal. Any incident of a veteran dying after
being denied care by the VA is unacceptable and shameful, and those
responsible must be held accountable
including through
possible criminal prosecutions .
My
full letter is available here.
Second,
I voted in favor of the VA Appropriations bill for
2015 . Our bipartisan bill, which passed the House
overwhelmingly, includes strict new reporting requirements for VA facilities,
and gives Congress new oversight authority, in order to
hold
the VA accountable for delivering better results for our veterans.

bill .
