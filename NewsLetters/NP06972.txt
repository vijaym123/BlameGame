Reinvigorating American manufacturing is crucial to the economic future of our country. We need to create a national manufacturing strategy that strengthens U.S. companies by reducing burdensome taxes and regulations, and preserves the rich manufacturing heritage of this country.

We discussed creating an economic environment that encourages growth and competitiveness for U.S. companies. To learn more, visit my website

Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. - I cosponsored the
Bring Jobs Back to America Act , which seeks to bring outsourced overseas jobs back to the United States in order to encourage job creation, by taking a few common sense steps. Learn more,
