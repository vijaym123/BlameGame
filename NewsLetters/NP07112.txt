David --
Speaker Boehner didn&rsquo;t bargain for this!
Since his dire prediction, more than SIX HUNDRED supporters have pitched in for Brad to help prevent a GOP takeover in Illinois. NICE WORK, David!
BUT -- Boehner&rsquo;s already shelled out $2.2 MILLION in the Land of Lincoln. If we don&rsquo;t close the gap and get out the facts to voters, Illinois Democrats could be in serious jeopardy.
David, your grassroots support is the key to victory.
Will you chip in before midnight and help us reach 1,000 donations for Brad?
