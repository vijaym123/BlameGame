Dear David,
The VA is still standing
between veterans and their ability to receive the quality medical care they
deserve. Just this week, KSPR-TV
reported
on a
veteran in Southwest Missouri who has stage 3 cancer, but has not
received treatment due to the VA's flawed system.
I'm working
to help this veteran and his family cut through the red tape - but
unfortunately, his story is one example of a persistent, national
problem.
We cannot stand for this kind of treatment for any
of America's heroes.
Last year I co-sponsored the VA reform bill, and I'm very
proud to
co-sponsor
the bipartisan
Veterans Access to Community Care Act
to give these heroes the
flexibility they need to receive the best care available as soon as
possible.
If you or someone you know needs help, I urge you
to contact my
office . I'll continue fighting to
fix this system and work to ensure our veterans receive the treatment
they need and deserve.
As always, I also invite
you to join the conversation online by sharing your thoughts with me on
Facebook ,
Twitter , on
Instagram , and by subscribing to my
YouTube
channel.
Sincere regards,
Washington
