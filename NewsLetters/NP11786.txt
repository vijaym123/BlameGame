H.R. 3826, the Electricity Security and Affordability
Act:
Passed by a bipartisan majority of 229 to 183. This bill,
cosponsored by Congressman Lamborn, would prohibit the Administrator
of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from issuing,
implementing, or enforcing any proposed or final rule under the Clean Air Act
that establishes a performance standard for greenhouse gas emissions from
any new source that is a fossil fuel-fired electric utility
generating unit unless the rule meets specified requirements of this
Act.
H.R. 2641, the
Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Development Act:
Passed by a bipartisan majority of 229 to 179. This bill allows for
expedited review of construction projects paid for fully or partially with
federal funds or that require federal regulatory agencies to grant
permits or approval of the projects. The bill specifically expedites the
review process established by the National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) by setting maximum deadlines for an Environmental Impact
Statement (36-months) and an Environmental Assessment
(18-months).
