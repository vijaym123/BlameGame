Town Hall Meetings In Idaho During
October
Please join me in
the coming weeks to share your views.
I have announced a series
of town hall meetings across the Idaho Panhandle and Southwest Idaho
during October.
These town hall meetings provide opportunities to
hear directly from Idahoans on a wide range of federal issues that
impact Idaho citizens.
The commonsense approach that Idahoans have
to solving issues is valuable, and I welcome Idahoans to visit with
me at one of these town hall
meetings.

13 th
Anniversary of September 11,
2001
Earlier this month, the American people paused to
remember and honor the victims, first responders and men and women of our
armed forces on the 13 th
anniversary of September 11,
2001.
The terrorist attacks that day heightened our national awareness
of the external threats that our nation faces and our democratic
values.
We honor the memory of those who lost their lives, including
two Idahoans, Ronald Vauk of Nampa and Brady Howell of Sugar City,
both of whom were at the Pentagon at the time of the attack.
We
express our sincere gratitude to all of those who continue to fight today
to keep us safe.

Its Time To Bring Pastor Saeed Abendini
Home
For two long years, Boise Pastor
Saeed Abedini has been unjustly imprisoned by the Iranian government and
persecuted for spreading his Christian faith.
Saeeds focus on
human rights and dignities has touched the hearts of many, and we
continue to press for his immediate release whenever possible.
This
month, I joined congressional colleagues in participating in the Its
Time campaign to raise awareness and again call for Pastor Abedinis
release and safe return home.

Operation Choke
Point
Late last summer, news reports surfaced regarding a U.S.
Department of Justice-led (DOJ) initiative that targets certain
industriesability to access banking services without first showing that the company
is breaking the law.
Rather than targeting bad actors for
illegal activity, this effort, known as Operation Choke Point, is causing
banks to deny or terminate credit lines due to fear of DOJ subpoenas or
unjustified regulatory action by federal banking
regulators.
In Idaho, I have heard from business owners involved in the guns
and ammunition business who experienced difficulty finding essential
banking services as a result of this fear and uncertainty.
The
message back from the banks was that while they have been very supportive
and liked the business plans, they were concerned that if they
accepted the loan, they would be audited the next day.
Other banks
believed that if they did business with industries considered high-risk,
they would face heavy regulatory scrutiny, potentially be penalized
in banking examinations, and receive a follow-up subpoena from the
Department.
We have already seen the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) target local tea party and conservative groups, and we must not
let Operation Choke Point become an end run around the Second
Amendment by threatening the financial security of gun and ammunition
manufacturers.
This week, Republican senators joined me in opposing
Operation Choke Point and demanded answers from the DOJ regarding this
operation.
The Department must stop politicizing its enforcement
policies by seeking to use subpoenas and legal actions to unfairly
impose liability on parties not involved in fraud, and to put merchants
engaged in legal and legitimate commerce that DOJ disfavors out of
business.

Government Watchdog Confirms CFPB Massive Data
Collection
When I discovered that a new government agency was
spending millions of dollars to collect information on millions of
Americans personal credit card, banking, mortgage and student loan
information, I began asking this agencythe Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau, or CFPBexactly what the scope and purpose of its data
collection was.
When the CFPB repeatedly failed to provide the
information, I turned to the non-partisan Government Accountability Office
(GAO) to investigate, requesting an official review of this data
collection effort.
This month, the GAO released the results of this
comprehensive study, confirming that the CFPB is collecting financial data
on up to 600 million consumer credit card accounts in addition to
massive amounts of other personal financial information.
Further, the
report recommended that the Bureaus privacy and security controls
for the sensitive information should be enhanced to reduce the risk of
improper collection, use, or release of the consumer financial
data.
This data collection effort is an unwelcome, unwarranted intrusion
into the private financial lives of millions of Americans.
The
report that was released this month confirms what the CFPB would
notthat it has been collecting information on up to 600 million American
financial accounts, and that it does not have the
proper
safeguards in place to protect the information it is collecting.
I
consider these to be very serious concerns at the very agency that was
designed to watch out for consumers, not watch them.
I will continue
to press for accountability and transparency at federal agencies like
the CFPB to ensure that our privacy rights are
protected.
