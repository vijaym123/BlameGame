Congratulations to the 2015 graduates from Kennebec Valley Community
College
! They can make a bright future
for themselves and for the state of Maine.
I had a very moving meeting with these three young women from Maine:
Sarah Caldwell, Katie Ferrara, and Karen Patterson who are all working
to raise awareness about ALS, a terrible disease that has affected each
of their families.
Katahdin Valley Health Center and other regional health centers deliver
invaluable services
in rural Maine. Here I am in Houlton
with KVHC staff in front of telemedicine equipment.
At Capitol Coffee thanking Matthew Pennington, a veteran from Dexter,
for his service in Iraq.
I toured Acme Monaco in Presque Isle in early May, a global leader in
orthodontic manufacturing. The company is doing great things in
Aroostook County.
As I told the crowd at the New England Council congressional
roundtable, working in Congress is both frustrating and exhilarating.
Honoring Our Fallen Heroes on Memorial Day
Each Memorial Day, we pay tribute to those who gave their lives to
preserve and protect this great Nation. I marched in the annual
Brunswick-Topsham Memorial Day Parade, and you can read my full
Memorial Day statement HERE
.
Report from Maine
Earlier this month, I introduced the Free Market Energy Act
to help foster individual energy
independence and promote cutting-edge technologies. One group in Maine
that is already taking control of their energy future is the Friends
School of Portland, which is currently building this new school in
Cumberland
that will produce its own energy from distributed resources
like solar panels.
At Veterans Inc. in Lewiston, I sat down with members of the Maine
veterans community where we talked about ending veteran homelessness
and better
helping veterans transition back into civilian life. Those who have
served our Nation and risked their lives to defend our freedom should
never have to go without a roof over their heads.
Report from Washington
Congratulations to Thornton Academy for winning the President's E Award
for their
dedication to international education! Thornton Headmaster Rene Menard
and Director of Admissions Mark Powers came by my office after the
award ceremony at the Department of Commerce.
Last Saturday morning after a string of late-night votes, I caught a 6
a.m. flight out of Reagan National Airport and made it back to Maine
just in time for the Bowdoin graduation. Boy, was I ready to get back
to Maine. Be sure to check out my Instagram
to get an inside look at what I'm up to.
Policy Update
*
As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I secured a
provision in the committee
markup of the National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA) that would improve the HUBZone program
and help create jobs and economic growth in areas
affected by recent military base closures.
*
By passing a short-term extension of the Highway Trust Fund
, Congress has once again kicked the can
down the road and failed to find a long-term solution. We cannot leave
this problem for our children and grandchildren to fix. If we don't act
soon, there won't even be a road to kick the can down.
*
The Senate voted last Friday to give President Obama Trade
Promotion Authority (TPA) to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership
and other looming trade agreements. I've long been skeptical of
free-trade and its impact on American workers, and I opposed TPA
because it basically approves major trade deals that have
substantial stakes for Maine when we haven't even seen them.
