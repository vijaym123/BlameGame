Dear David Johnson,
In the past decade, a number of new technologies have emerged,
including smartphones, tablets, and social networks. Among these are
technologies that enable "spoofing," which is the scrambling of caller
identification numbers. Through spoofing, one's identity can be
disguised when making calls.
A hacker or swindler can pretend to call
from the number of a friend, a favorite restaurant, or even a bank.
Spoofing is often used to defraud anyone who gets a phone call or text
message; it is on the rise and it is damaging the lives of many of our
friends and neighbors.
I first learned of spoofing from constituents, many of whom have
been plagued by the practice. Research shows that two of the largest
groups in our community, immigrants and seniors, are among the most
vulnerable to spoofing attacks.
I thus recently introduced the bipartisan Anti-Spoofing Act. The
bill will ensure that spoofing is prohibited where it is done to
defraud or otherwise cause harm; it will hold ostensibly legitimate
spoofing service providers responsible for their actions; and it will
ensure that the long arm of the law extends to those who spoof "into"
the United States from outside the country. The bill also takes direct
aim at new technologies that are behind the rise in spoofing, such as
text messaging and new internet-based VoIP services that enable callers
to make outgoing-only calls from computers and tablets to mobile and
landline phones.
I am committed to breaking through the Washington gridlock and
partisanship, and finding practical solutions for the people of Queens.
With the Anti-Spoofing Act, I'm working to do just that.
Thank you for taking the time to read this note; it's important
that we stay informed and work together to protect our community from
the pervasive scourge of spoofing. If you have been a victim of
spoofing or would like to discuss this issue further, please do not
hesitate contact me.
Sincerely,
Grace Meng
Member of Congress

Dear
David Johnson,
In
the
past
decade,
a
number
of
new
technologies
have
emerged,
including
smartphones,
tablets,
and
social
networks.
Among
these
are
technologies
that
enable
&#8220;spoofing,&#8221;
which
is
the
scrambling
of
caller
identification
numbers.
Through
spoofing,
one&#8217;s
identity
can
be
disguised
when
making
calls.
A
hacker
or
swindler
can
pretend
to
call
from
the
number
of
a
friend,
a
favorite
restaurant,
or
even
a
bank.
Spoofing
is
often
used
to
defraud
anyone
who gets
a
phone
call
or
text
message;
it
is
on
the
rise
and
it
is
damaging
the
lives
of
many
of
our
friends
and
neighbors.
I
first
learned
of
spoofing
from
constituents,
many
of
whom
have
been
plagued
by
the
practice.
Research
shows
that
two
of
the
largest
groups
in
our
community,
immigrants
and
seniors,
are
among
the
most
vulnerable
to
spoofing
attacks.
I
thus
recently
introduced
the
bipartisan
Anti-Spoofing
Act.
The
bill
will
ensure
that
spoofing
is
prohibited
where
it
is
done
to
defraud
or
otherwise
cause
harm;
it
will
hold
ostensibly
legitimate
spoofing
service
providers
responsible
for
their
actions;
and
it
will
ensure
that
the
long
arm
of
the
law
extends
to
those
who
spoof
&#8220;into&#8221;
the
United
States
from
outside
the
country.
The
bill
also
takes
direct
aim
at
new
technologies
that
are
behind
the
rise
in
spoofing,
such
as
text
messaging
and
new
internet-based
VoIP
services
that
enable
callers
to
make
outgoing-only
calls
from
computers
and
tablets
to
mobile
and
landline
phones.
I
am
committed
to
breaking
through
the
Washington
gridlock
and
partisanship,
and
finding
practical
solutions
for
the
people
of
Queens.
With
the
Anti-Spoofing
Act,
I&#8217;m
working
to
do
just
that.
Thank
you
for
taking
the
time
to
read
this
note;
it&#8217;s
important
that
we
stay
informed
and
work
together
to
protect
our
community
from
the
pervasive
scourge
of
spoofing.
If
you
have
been
a
victim
of
spoofing
or
would
like
to

this
issue
further,
please
do
not
hesitate
