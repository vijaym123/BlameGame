This week the House passed legislation to help modernize and improve our nations workforce development system and help put Americans back to work. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (H.R. 803) is the latest effort in the House to focus on Americans top priority
finding real solutions to bolster job creation and strengthen our economy.
One of the most frustrating experiences during my service in Congress has been the pervasive skills gap facing workers and employers. At the same time that millions of Americans remain unemployed, countless local employers have told me about their difficulty finding qualified workers. This is a clear reminder that effective education and workforce development opportunities are critical to making the American economy healthy again. This legislation will prepare workers for the 21st century workforce, while helping businesses find the skilled employees they need to compete and create jobs in the 4th District and across America.
H.R. 803 reforms and modernizes federal workforce training programs by: eliminating 15 duplicative programs; applying a single set of outcome metrics to federal workforce programs; aligning workforce development programs with local economic development and education initiatives; and enabling businesses to identify in-demand skills and connect workers with the opportunities to build those skills. H.R. 803 first was adopted by the House in March 2013 as the SKILLS Act. A House-Senate Conference Committee drafted this compromise agreement that was approved by the Senate in late June, and it is expected to be signed into law by President Obama.
This week I also had the opportunity to introduce a bipartisan amendment to the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act that would have restored $20 million in hydropower research development. The spending would have been offset by reducing Department of Energy administrative costs that, in the end, actually would have saved hardworking taxpayers $8 million.

Hydropower is vitally important to reducing our dependence on foreign oil. Unlike some other renewable energy sources, hydropower is available in every region of the country. Currently, 2,200 hydropower plants provide Americas most abundant source of clean, renewable electricity; it accounts for 67% of domestic renewable generation and 7% of total electricity generation.
According to the Department of Energy, of the 80,000 dams in the U.S., 600 have the ability to immediately produce energy. We easily could more than double the total electricity generation from hydropower, which is why we should be looking at ways to harness Americas hydropower potential. It's a reliable, proven, and domestic technology that can expand in environmentally friendly ways, and it can be put to work in rivers, harbors, and coastal areas to capture energy from currents and tides. Harnessing this energy will create a truly renewable and green source of energy.
Sincerely,
Scott G. Perry
