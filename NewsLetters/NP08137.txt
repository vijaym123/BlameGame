Dear Friend &ndash;
Orange County is a diverse, exciting place and we all experience it in our own way.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m holding my first-ever Facebook Cover Photo Competition to see what YOU see when you think of our home .
From now until July 31 st , I invite you to submit your favorite high quality photos taken in Orange County to be considered for the cover photo on my Facebook page.
To submit, please send the photo, along with your name and where the photo was taken, to sanchezphotocontest@gmail.com.
Photos will be posted on my Facebook page and the winner of the contest will be announced on Friday, August 1st, 2014.
Please note:
- Photos must be high-quality.
- Photos must be taken by the person submitting the photo.
