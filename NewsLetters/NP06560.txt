Friend-
There are many in the Fourth District who dont get thanked enough for the faithful work they do. Our farmers are among these. So today, I want to say thank you to the hardworking farmers of Virginia for all that they contribute to our communities and this country.
I am proud to stand up in your support.
Yours in service,
Randy
