Friend,
They&rsquo;re opening offices, running online ads, and gaining the endorsements of national interest groups.
Our opponents are building out their campaigns quickly, and now we must ask ourselves&mdash;are we ready?
We&rsquo;re only a month into 2014, but there&rsquo;s no time to waste.
In the last few weeks, two of our opponents have had major office openings in our district.
And, to round out the group, the other is planning to open his office later this week.
With our opponents launching their ground games earlier than expected, we need to raise an additional $5,000 by February 10 th
to counter their efforts and expand our team.
This is a test of our momentum.
Can you pitch in $5 or more to help us reach our goal?
We have to raise $5,000 in the next six days to hit our target.
We&rsquo;re getting there, but we need to hit this goal in order to make strategic decisions about mobilizing our volunteers and opening our own offices.
This race is going to come down to the grassroots power of each campaign.
They may have opened their offices early, but they&rsquo;re still no match for our team.
Let&rsquo;s show them what we&rsquo;ve got.
Please click here to pitch in $5 now.
Thank you for all you do.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&rsquo;s 7 th
District
P.S.
How we respond depends on whether or not we hit this goal.
Can you give a few dollars towards our $5,000 goal and show our opponents that we&rsquo;re ready for them?
