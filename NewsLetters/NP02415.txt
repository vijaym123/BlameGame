David -- You were there for us when we needed it most last election. Thank you! But now, only 7 weeks into Cheri&rsquo;s second term, Boehner's already plotting her defeat.
David Johnson FOUNDING MEMBER?
NO DONATION
We have a tough campaign ahead of us, so it&rsquo;s critical we get to work right away. That means missing our February budget goal is NOT an option
-- no ifs, ands or buts. Will you donate $5 or more to become a Founding Member of Cheri&rsquo;s re-election campaign?
$5 &gt;&gt;
$35 &gt;&gt;
$50 &gt;&gt;
$100 &gt;&gt;
$250 &gt;&gt;
Other &gt;&gt;
We can do this, but only if we start now.
