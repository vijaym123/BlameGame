Dear
David,
Today, our nation celebrates 238 years of
independence.
During this celebration it is important to reflect how
far we have come as a country. We must remember the service
members, past and present, who have served to ensure our American
freedom.
I hope everyone has the opportunity to enjoy this time with their
friends and family and has a safe holiday weekend.
Happy Fourth
of July!
Respectfully,
Gloria Negrete
McLeod
