Dear Friend,
The kickoff for the special election was back in February 2013. Since then, you&rsquo;ve helped power us to victory once -- but this has really been a two-year-long campaign, and now, we&rsquo;re approaching the homestretch.
You&rsquo;ve been by my side for every step of this journey. Today, with the election just over a month away, I need to ask you to redouble your efforts so we can stay strong right through the end. The election is 39 days away, but our FEC deadline is in just 3 days. We need to raise $145,OOO by midnight on Tuesday -- get us $5 closer to our goal right now.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:

Or donate another amount.
In the post- Citizens United
era, outside groups can change the momentum of a race overnight. We need to mount a strong defense so we&rsquo;re ready for whatever is thrown at us.
We&rsquo;ve come too far to turn back now, and we&rsquo;ve accomplished too much to rest on our laurels. Our two-year campaign is going to draw to a close soon. The question is, will we have put in the work we need to win? Our team is on the ground in Massachusetts and gearing up for the final weeks of the campaign. Your support before the FEC deadline will help us win in November -- give $5 before it&rsquo;s too late.
Thank you for helping me start this journey. With your help, we&rsquo;ll finish what we set out to do.
Sincerely,
Ed
