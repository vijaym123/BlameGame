CONSTITUENT SERVICES
ISSUES AND LEGISLATION
January 18, 2015
House Votes To Protect
Constitution:
President Obamas unconstitutional
power grabs to rewrite our immigration laws are dangerous and
threaten the separation of powers set forth by the Constitution. These
actions must be stopped and it is our duty as a House to protect and uphold
the Constitution.
In response, this week the House
passed, with my support, the
FY2015 Department of Homeland Security
Appropriations Act . This bill included 5 amendments to deny any funds
that could be used to implement or carry out the Presidents unlawful
acts. It also fully funds the Department of Homeland Security,
further secures our borders, and protects our workers here at home. The
American people deserve an open and honest debate on a permanent solution
to fix our broken immigration system, and today was an important step
in the efforts to modernize legal immigration and reward those who
come here legally, not those who have broken the law.
Leadership
Meeting at the White House:
This week, I joined
Congressional leaders at the White House to meet with President Obama
and Vice President Biden. I believe there was a consensus to find
solutions to stop the ever-emerging cyber-attacks, while still protecting
your privacy. Increasing cyber-security must be a high priority and the
House stands ready to work with the President to help keep our
homeland safe. We discussed the need to update the Authorization for the Use
of Military Force in order to destroy and eliminate
ISIL.
We also continued to urge the President to work with Congress
instead of threatening to veto bipartisan legislation
and act on the
recent House-passed bills to get folks back to work. There will be
opportunities to expand trade and fix our broken tax code in the near future
and after todays meeting I hope these will be issues we can work
together on and find sensible solutions to grow our
economy.
Protecting Volunteer Firefighters From Healthcare Law's
Mandate:
This week, the House passed the
Protecting
Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act
to prevent our
volunteer firefighters and EMTs from being penalized under the Presidents
health care law. This legislation is identical to a bill that passed
the House with full support last year, however the Senate chose not to
act.
As the daughter of a former Kansas State Fire
Marshall, I understand how important these volunteers are to our communities.
In Kansas, there are 550 volunteer fire departments that are staffed
by 13,000 volunteer firefighters, and the Presidents healthcare law
threatens to penalize them by counting them as full-time employees and
possibly subjecting their departments to the employer mandate tax. It
is my hope that the new Republican Senate will quickly pass this bill
and send it to the Presidents desk.
Last January I spoke
on the House Floor about this important issue, and I encourage you to
take a look
here .
