Kansas Common Sense
April 27, 2015
Hello,
Welcome to Kansas Common Sense. It was a productive week on Capitol
Hill. Thank you for your continued interest in receiving my weekly
newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and
friends if it would interest them.
Voting in Favor of Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act
This week, the Senate finally had the opportunity to vote on the
bipartisan Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. This legislation had
been blocked from moving forward on the Senate floor despite being
unanimously approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee. I voted in
support of the legislation, which passed the Senate by a vote of 99 to
0.
Human trafficking is a serious and too-often invisible problem that
affects the lives of tens thousands of women and children, and this
legislation protects those individuals and punishes those who enslave
them. More than 200 victims rights and law enforcement groups support
this legislation, and have called it the most comprehensive and
thoughtful piece of anti-trafficking legislation currently pending.
For the victims of modern slavery who suffer such horrible abuse at the
hands of human traffickers, the Senate could not afford to wait any
longer to vote on the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. I am
pleased the Senate was able to move forward in a bipartisan fashion to
pass this important piece of legislation.
Consideration of New Attorney General
Reviewing the Presidents nominees for executive and judicial
appointments is one of my most serious responsibilities as a United
States Senator. President Obamas nominee for Attorney General, Loretta
Lynch, has failed to demonstrate in her testimony a willingness to
exert independence from the White House when applying the laws of the
land. On issues ranging from gun rights to immigration, this White
House has habitually sought to ignore the law when it posed
inconvenient limits on executive power. This troubling trend must come
to an end.
The Attorney General is Americas most senior law enforcement official,
and Americans must be certain that the rule of law will be applied
consistently and fairly by the Department of Justice. After careful
consideration, I am unconvinced that Ms. Lynch meets this standard and
was unable to support her confirmation for Attorney General.
Questioning HHS Secretary Burwell About Dietary Guidelines at Senate
Appropriations Hearing
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, formulated every five years by
USDA and HHS, provide a blueprint for how Americans can have a healthy,
nutritious diet. The guidelines also form the basis for our federal
nutrition policy and food assistance programs. Recently, a report
issued by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, meant to provide
unbiased dietary recommendations based on nutritional science,
contained a number of concerning and inappropriate recommendations.
The report relegates the role of lean meat in a healthy diet to a
footnote in the 500-plus page report, instead recommending that
Americans eat a heavily plant-based diet. The report also factors in
environmental sustainability into its dietary recommendations
a field
outside the committee members background or expertise. Not only does
the potential harm to Kansas beef producers greatly concern me, but we
are left to wonder if the committee simply ignored the extensive,
peer-reviewed research that shows lean red meat as part of a healthy
diet, as well as the statutory framework by which the HHS Secretary and
USDA Secretary are instructed to develop the guidelines.
This week, I expressed my concerns to HHS Secretary Burwell about the
Dietary Guidelines at a Senate Appropriations Hearing. While Im
pleased USDA and HHS heeded our call for an extension of the comment
period last month, I was disappointed to learn that she had yet to read
the statute framework which inform how the guidelines should be
developed. As the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee
Chairman and as a member of the Senate Labor-HHS Appropriations
Subcommittee, I will continue to be diligent in my oversight as the
agencies finalize the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
Sponsoring Legislation to Reduce Food Waste and Feed the Hungry and
Visiting Harvesters Community Food Network in Topeka
As Senate Hunger Caucus Co-Chair, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the
Good Samaritan Hunger Relief Tax Incentive Act of 2015 (S.390). The
bill would permanently extend the same tax incentives available to
corporations to donate surplus food to local food banks to small
businesses, farmers, ranchers and restaurant owners. In the years since
the 2008 financial collapse and the economic recession that followed,
demand on food banks across the country has risen dramatically.
According to a 2012 study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 49
million Americans are living in food insecure households and one-third
of these individuals are children. Despite this, more than 30 percent
of the food that is produced, grown and transported in the United
States will never be used as some businesses find it too costly to
donate the excess food. This bipartisan, commonsense bill intends to
direct food resources currently being wasted to the people in Kansas
who need assistance the most.
This week I had the opportunity to tour Harvesters Community Food
Network, a regional food bank serving a 26-county area of northwestern
Missouri and northeastern Kansas. Harvesters provides food and related
household products to more than 620 not-for-profit agencies including
food pantries, community kitchens, homeless shelters, childrens homes
and others. They also offer education programs to increase community
awareness of hunger and teach about good nutrition. I am proud of the
important work food banks such as Harvesters play in solving hunger
issues in communities across Kansas. Here, I'm pictured with volunteers
from Washburn Rural High School.
Introducing Legislation Focused on Cyber-Security Information Sharing
I chair the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection,
Product Safety, Insurance and Data Security. This week I joined Senator
Kirsten Gillibrand of New York in introducing legislation to address
critical cyber security vulnerabilities by helping to create a network
of trusted partnerships across the public and private sectors aimed at
detecting, preventing and mitigating cyber threats through information
sharing. Consumers, businesses, and our nations critical
infrastructure face constant and evolving threats from cyber criminals
who seeks to do us harm. When it comes to detecting and preempting
these threats and protecting American consumers from cybercrimes,
information sharing within trusted industry networks has proven to be a
valuable tool across numerous sectors of our economy. The Cyber
Information Sharing Tax Credit Act will make participation in vital
sector-specific information sharing organizations, known as Information
Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs), more accessible for all companies
especially those who may not fully understand their risk of
cyber-attack or who would not otherwise have the resources to
participate in an information sharing organization. As more industries
and businesses participate, these networks will help businesses
understand and improve their cyber posture and ensure the timely
dissemination of information on increasingly sophisticated cyber
threats. Click here

Introducing the CLEAR Relief Act and CLEAR Relief Plus Act
Kansans understand the vital role community financial instutitions play
in serving rural America and supporting our economy. Unfortunately,
Washington regulators have all too often applied a one-size-fits-all
regulatory structure that ignores the unique service of our community
banks. Because smaller financial institutions have less capacity to
absorb the compliance costs of increasingly burdensome regulation, it
greatly diminishes their ability to serve their communities and support
the local economy.
In order to improve the playing field and enhance the special role of
our community financial institutions, I have introduced the Community
Lending Enhancement and Regulatory (CLEAR) Relief Act (S. 812) and the
CLEAR Relief Plus Act (S. 927). By stripping away outdated or
unnecessary regulation, the CLEAR Relief Act will strengthen the
ability of community banks to support the housing recovery and make
certain small businesses have access to much-needed capital. Working in
tandem with the CLEAR Relief Act, the CLEAR Plus Act will allow savings
and loan holding companies to benefit from the JOBS Act, and provide
certain healthy financial institutions with relief from complex and
costly paperwork requirements.
Striking the right regulatory balance is vital as we seek to support
our fragile housing recovery and create an environment for businesses
to grow and thrive. Together, the CLEAR Relief Act and CLEAR Relief
Plus Act will help support a healthy banking system and foster a strong
rural America. I will continue working with my colleagues in the Senate
toward passing these important pieces of legislation. Click here

Protecting Kansas Defense Communities
I serve as the Senate Defense Communities Caucus Co-Chair and am a
member of the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee. This week I
called on the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee to consider legislative language in the Fiscal Year 2016
Defense Authorization Bill that protects the current troop levels of
our Armed Forces. Despite a dangerous world with increasing demands on
the service members and military families who call Kansas home,
Department of Defense resources to protect our country and its citizens
from conventional threats and terrorist attacks are dwindling. The
Armed Services, particularly the Army, are facing potential force
reductions that could put our nations defense at risk.
Fort Leavenworth is the Intellectual Center of the Army
an
irreplaceable entity that educates, trains and develops our military
commanders. The Army and our national defense
today and for
generations to come
would be degraded by losing personnel at Fort
Leavenworth who carry out the critical mission of creating future
leaders. Fort Riley is also at risk, potentially losing thousands of
soldiers who serve in the Big Red One
the Army 1st Infantry Division.
Fort Leavenworths unparalleled professional military education and
Fort Rileys vast training capability are essential to the Army when
developing the American soldier. I have been working to make certain
the Army understands the defense community in Kansas is committed to
supporting Fort Leavenworth and Fort Riley as well as the Army as a
whole. I will continue to work on maintaining troop levels at our bases
in Kansas and across the country so that our nations defense and those
who serve are ready and equipped to safeguard Americans from terrorists
who attempt to destroy and attack our way of life. Click here

Member.
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Passes Iran Nuclear Agreement Review
Act
This week I cosponsored the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015
(S. 615). This legislation has earned the full support of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee and would provide Congress with the power
to review a final nuclear deal with Iran. As I have stated before, I am
concerned about the consequences of these nuclear negotiations and
worry about the danger a weak or unverifiable deal would bring about.
It is critical that American leadership guide these efforts in the
safest possible direction.
Over the years, Congress has passed a series of sanctions that brought
Iran to the negotiating table. Included in those statutory sanctions
are national security waiver authorities and other provisions that the
President can use to suspend sanctions
without Congressional approval
on Iran as part of any final nuclear deal. The Iran Nuclear Agreement
Review Act has emerged as one of the few pieces of legislation that
would require Congressional review and limit the Presidents ability to
act unilaterally.
Congress has faced significant opposition from the President amid
Congressional attempts to restrain the existing executive authorities
that could result in a nuclear deal being agreed to without review or
consent from the Legislative Branch. The President has threatened to
veto just about any piece of legislation that might restrict his
authority to waive sanctions or limit his ability to make a deal with
Iran.
After the presumed passage of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act,
and in the case a deal is ultimately struck by the June 30 deadline,
Congress would have 30 days to review any potential accord with Iran.
Congress, Americans and people around the world must use that time to
carefully examine the result of these nuclear negotiations and ask if
it puts the world on a path toward peace. Humanity has too much at
stake to permit the existence of a path leading elsewhere.
Visiting Community Memorial Healthcare
On Saturday afternoon, I traveled to Marshall County to visit Community
Memorial Healthcare (CMH) in Marysville. CMH is a Critical Access
Hospital that has been serving Marysville and the surrounding
communities since 1958. A few years ago, CMH opened a new facility with
the goal of improving and modernizing patient care. CMH offers a
wide-range of essential health care services at the hospital, and also
operates outpatient care clinics in Wymore, Blue Rapids and Marysville.
During my time representing Kansans in Washington, D.C., I have had the
opportunity to visit each of the 127 community hospitals in Kansas. As
a member of the Senate Appropriations Health Subcommittee, which has
funding jurisdiction over most agencies within the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS) that impact hospitals and providers,
meeting with Kansas hospital administrators, physicians, nurses and
other staff gives me important insight on the challenges they face
caring for patients.
My discussion with CMH administrators and staff spanned various topics
including concerns with proposed changes in Medicare reimbursements and
the consequences to CAHs, and the challenges of providing quality
patient care under regulations that don't account for the realities of
delivering care in a rural setting. It is important that the federal
government allow rural providers the flexibility necessary to
adequately care for their patients, many of whom are older and live
across wide areas. I will continue to oppose federal policies that
would disproportionately affect health care access in Kansas and other
rural states. Thanks to CMH CEO Curtis Hawkinson for hosting my visit.
Flipping Pancakes at the Combat Air Museum
On Saturday, I started my day by flipping pancakes at the Forbes Field
Combat Air Museums 22nd Annual Celebrity Pancake Feed benefiting the
Combat Air Museum. The Combat Air Museum has served as an educational
institution and tourism destination for more than thirty years. It is
one of only a few major aviation museums in the United States located
on an active air field. The event had a great turnout and was a lot of
fun. Thanks again to Gene Howerter for the invitation to participate.
Honored to Serve You
It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many
Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts
and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the
words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook
comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard.

enforcement
groups
support
this
legislation,
and
have
called
it
&#147;the
most
comprehensive
and
thoughtful
piece
of
anti-trafficking
legislation
currently
pending.&#148;
For
the
victims
of
modern
slavery
who
suffer
such
horrible
abuse
at
the
hands
of
human
traffickers,
the
Senate
could
not
afford
to
wait
any
longer
to
vote
on
the
Justice
for
Victims
of
Trafficking
Act.
I
am
pleased
the
Senate
was
able
to
move
forward
in
a
bipartisan
fashion
to
pass
this
important
piece
of
legislation.
Consideration
of
New
Attorney
General
Reviewing
the
President&#146;s
nominees
for
executive
and
judicial
appointments
is
one
of
my
most
serious
responsibilities
as
a
United
States
Senator.
President
Obama&#146;s
nominee
for
Attorney
General,
Loretta
Lynch,
has
failed
to
demonstrate
in
her
testimony
a
willingness
to
exert
independence
from
the
White
House
when
applying
the
laws
of
the
land.
On
issues
ranging
from
gun
rights
to
immigration,
this
White
House
has
habitually
sought
to
ignore
the
law
when
it
posed
inconvenient
limits
on
executive
power.
This
troubling
trend
must
come
to
an
end.
The
Attorney
General
is
America&#146;s
most
senior
law
enforcement
official,
and
Americans
must
be
certain
that
the
rule
of
law
will
be
applied
consistently
and
fairly
by
the
Department
of
Justice.
After
careful
consideration,
I
am
unconvinced
that
Ms.
Lynch
meets
this
standard
and
was
unable
to
support
her
confirmation
for
Attorney
General.
Questioning
HHS
Secretary
Burwell
About
Dietary
Guidelines
at
Senate
Appropriations
Hearing
The
Dietary
Guidelines
for
Americans,
formulated
every
five
years
by
USDA
and
HHS,
provide
a
blueprint
for
how
Americans
can
have
a
healthy,
nutritious
diet.
The
guidelines
also
form
the
basis
for
our
federal
nutrition
policy
and
food
assistance
programs.
Recently,
a
report
issued
by
the
Dietary
Guidelines
Advisory
Committee,
meant
to
provide
unbiased
dietary
recommendations
based
on
nutritional
science,
contained
a
number
of
concerning
and
inappropriate
recommendations.
The
report
relegates
the
role
of
lean
meat
in
a
healthy
diet
to
a
footnote
in
the
500-plus
page
report,
instead
recommending
that
Americans
eat
a
heavily
plant-based
diet.
The
report
also
factors
in
environmental
sustainability
into
its
dietary
recommendations
&#150;
a
field
outside
the
committee
members&#146;
background
or
expertise.
Not
only
does
the
potential
harm
to
Kansas
beef
producers
greatly
concern
me,
but
we
are
left
to
wonder
if
the
committee
simply
ignored
the
extensive,
peer-reviewed
research
that
shows
lean
red
meat
as
part
of
a
healthy
diet,
as
well
as
the
statutory
framework
by
which
the
HHS
Secretary
and
USDA
Secretary
are
instructed
to
develop
the
guidelines.
This
week,
I
expressed
my
concerns
to
HHS
Secretary
Burwell
about
the
Dietary
Guidelines
at
a
Senate
Appropriations
Hearing.
While
I&#146;m
pleased
USDA
and
HHS
heeded
our
call
for
an
extension
of
the
comment
period
last
month,
I
was
disappointed
to
learn
that
she
had
yet
to
read
the
statute
framework
which
inform
how
the
guidelines
should
be
developed.
As
the
Senate
Agriculture
Appropriations
Subcommittee
Chairman
and
as
a
member
of
the
Senate
Labor-HHS
Appropriations
Subcommittee,
I
will
continue
to
be
diligent
in
my
oversight
as
the
agencies
finalize
the
Dietary
Guidelines
for
Americans.
Sponsoring
Legislation
to
Reduce
Food
Waste
and
Feed
the
Hungry
and
Visiting Harvesters
Community
Food
Network in
Topeka
As
Senate
Hunger
Caucus
Co-Chair,
I
am
proud
to
be
a
cosponsor
of
the
Good
Samaritan
Hunger
Relief
Tax
Incentive
Act
of
2015
(S.390).
The
bill
would
permanently
extend
the
same
tax
incentives
available
to
corporations
to
donate
surplus
food
to
local
food
banks
to
small
businesses,
farmers,
ranchers
and
restaurant
owners.
In
the
years
since
the
2008
financial
collapse
and
the
economic
recession
that
followed,
demand
on
food
banks
across
the
country
has
risen
dramatically.
According
to
a
2012
study
by
the
U.S.
Department
of
Agriculture,
49
million
Americans
are
living
in
food
insecure
households
and
one-third
of
these
individuals
are
children.
Despite
this,
more
than
30
percent
of
the
food
that
is
produced,
grown
and
transported
in
the
United
States
will
never
be
used
as
some
businesses
find
it
too
costly
to
donate
the
excess
food.
This
bipartisan,
commonsense
bill
intends
to
direct
food
resources
currently
being
wasted
to
the
people
in
Kansas
who
need
assistance
the
most.
This
week
I
had
the
opportunity
to
tour
Harvesters
Community
Food
Network,
a
regional
food
bank
serving
a
26-county
area
of
northwestern
Missouri
and
northeastern
Kansas.
Harvesters
provides
food
and
related
household
products
to
more
than
620
not-for-profit
agencies
including
food
pantries,
community
kitchens,
homeless
shelters,
children&#146;s
homes
and
others.
They
also
offer
education
programs
to
increase
community
awareness
of
hunger
and
teach
about
good
nutrition.
I
am
proud
of
the
important
work
food
banks
such
as
Harvesters
play
in
solving
hunger
issues
in
communities
across
Kansas.

I'm

Introducing
Legislation
Focused
on
Cyber-Security
Information
Sharing
I
chair
the
Senate
Commerce
Subcommittee
on
Consumer
Protection,
Product
Safety,
Insurance
and
Data
Security.
This
week
I
joined
Senator
Kirsten
Gillibrand
of
New
York
in
introducing
legislation
to
address
critical
cyber
security
vulnerabilities
by
helping
to
create
a
network
of
trusted
partnerships
across
the
public
and
private
sectors
aimed
at
detecting,
preventing
and
mitigating
cyber
threats
through
information
sharing.
Consumers,
businesses,
and
our
nation&#146;s
critical
infrastructure
face
constant
and
evolving
threats
from
cyber
criminals
who
seeks
to
do
us
harm.
When
it
comes
to
detecting
and
preempting
these
threats
and
protecting
American
consumers
from
cybercrimes,
information
sharing
within
trusted
industry
networks
has
proven
to
be
a
valuable
tool
across
numerous
sectors
of
our
economy.
The
Cyber
Information
Sharing
Tax
Credit
Act
will
make
participation
in
vital
sector-specific
information
sharing
organizations,
known
as
Information
Sharing
and
Analysis
Centers
(ISACs),
more
accessible
for
all
companies
&#150;
especially
those
who
may
not
fully
understand
their
risk
of
cyber-attack
or
who
would
not
otherwise
have
the
resources
to
participate
in
an
information
sharing
organization.
As
more
industries
and
businesses
participate,
these
networks
will
help
businesses
understand
and
improve
their
cyber
posture
and
ensure
the
timely
dissemination
of
information
on
increasingly
sophisticated
cyber
threats.

Introducing
the
CLEAR
Relief
Act
and
CLEAR
Relief
Plus
Act
Kansans
understand
the
vital
role
community
financial
instutitions
play
in
serving
rural
America
and
supporting
our
economy.
Unfortunately,
Washington
regulators
have
all
too
often
applied
a
one-size-fits-all
regulatory
structure
that
ignores
the
unique
service
of
our
community
banks.
Because
smaller
financial
institutions
have
less
capacity
to
absorb
the
compliance
costs
of
increasingly
burdensome
regulation,
it
greatly
diminishes
their
ability
to
serve
their
communities
and
support
the
local
economy.
In
order
to
improve
the
playing
field
and
enhance
the
special
role
of
our
community
financial
institutions,
I
have
introduced
the
Community
Lending
Enhancement
and
Regulatory
(CLEAR)
Relief
Act
(S.
812)
and
the
CLEAR
Relief
Plus
Act
(S.
927).
By
stripping
away
outdated
or
unnecessary
regulation,
the
CLEAR
Relief
Act
will
strengthen
the
ability
of
community
banks
to
support
the
housing
recovery
and
make
certain
small
businesses
have
access
to
much-needed
capital.
Working
in
tandem
with
the
CLEAR
Relief
Act,
the
CLEAR
Plus
Act
will
allow
savings
and
loan
holding
companies
to
benefit
from
the
JOBS
Act,
and
provide
certain
healthy
financial
institutions
with
relief
from
complex
and
costly
paperwork
requirements.
Striking
the
right
regulatory
balance
is
vital
as
we
seek
to
support
our
fragile
housing
recovery
and
create
an
environment
for
businesses
to
grow
and
thrive.
Together,
the
CLEAR
Relief
Act
and
CLEAR
Relief
Plus
Act
will
help
support
a
healthy
banking
system
and
foster
a
strong
rural
America.
I
will
continue
working
with
my
colleagues
in
the
Senate
toward
passing
these
important
pieces
of
legislation.

Protecting
Kansas&#146;
Defense
Communities
I
serve
as
the
Senate
Defense
Communities
Caucus
Co-Chair
and
am
a
member
of
the
Senate
Appropriations
Defense
Subcommittee.
This
week
I
called
on
the
Chairman
and
Ranking
Member
of
the
Senate
Armed
Services
Committee
to
consider
legislative
language
in
the
Fiscal
Year
2016
Defense
Authorization
Bill
that
protects
the
current
troop
levels
of
our
Armed
Forces.
Despite
a
dangerous
world
with
increasing
demands
on
the
service
members
and
military
families
who
call
Kansas
home,
Department
of
Defense
resources
to
protect
our
country
and
its
citizens
from
conventional
threats
and
terrorist
attacks
are
dwindling.
The
Armed
Services,
particularly
the
Army,
are
facing
potential
force
reductions
that
could
put
our
nation&#146;s
defense
at
risk.
Fort
Leavenworth
is
the
Intellectual
Center
of
the
Army
&#150; an
irreplaceable
entity
that
educates,
trains
and
develops
our
military
commanders.
The
Army
and
our
national
defense
&#150;
today
and
for
generations
to
come
&#150; would
be
degraded
by
losing
personnel
at
Fort
Leavenworth
who
carry
out
the
critical
mission
of
creating
future
leaders.
Fort
Riley
is
also
at
risk,
potentially
losing
thousands
of
soldiers
who
serve
in
the
Big
Red
One
&#150; the
Army
1st Infantry
Division.
Fort
Leavenworth&#146;s
unparalleled
professional
military
education
and
Fort
Riley&#146;s
vast
training
capability
are
essential
to
the
Army
when
developing
the
American
soldier.
I
have
been
working
to
make
certain
the
Army
understands
the
defense
community
in
Kansas
is
committed
to
supporting
Fort
Leavenworth
and
Fort
Riley
as
well
as
the
Army
as
a
whole.
I
will
continue
to
work
on
maintaining
troop
levels
at
our
bases
in
Kansas
and
across
the
country
so
that
our
nation&#146;s
defense
and
those
who
serve
are
ready
and
equipped
to
safeguard
Americans
from
terrorists
who
attempt
to
destroy
and
attack
our
way
of
life.

Senate
Foreign
Relations
Committee
Passes
Iran
Nuclear
Agreement
Review
Act
This
week
I
cosponsored
the
Iran
Nuclear
Agreement
Review
Act
of
2015
(S.
615).
This
legislation
has
earned
the
full
support
of
the
Senate
Foreign
Relations
Committee
and
would
provide
Congress
with
the
power
to
review
a
final
nuclear
deal
with
Iran.
As
I
have
stated
before,
I
am
concerned
about
the
consequences
of
these
nuclear
negotiations
and
worry
about
the
danger
a
weak
or
unverifiable
deal
would
bring
about.
It
is
critical
that
American
leadership
guide
these
efforts
in
the
safest
possible
direction.
Over
the
years,
Congress
has
passed
a
series
of
sanctions
that
brought
Iran
to
the
negotiating
table.
Included
in
those
statutory
sanctions
are
national
security
waiver
authorities
and
other
provisions
that
the
President
can
use
to
suspend
sanctions
&#150;
without
Congressional
approval
&#150;
on
Iran
as
part
of
any
final
nuclear
deal.
The
Iran
Nuclear
Agreement
Review
Act
has
emerged
as
one
of
the
few
pieces
of
legislation
that
would
require
Congressional
review
and
limit
the
President&#146;s
ability
to
act
unilaterally.
Congress
has
faced
significant
opposition
from
the
President
amid
Congressional
attempts
to
restrain
the
existing
executive
authorities
that
could
result
in
a
nuclear
deal
being
agreed
to
without
review
or
consent
from
the
Legislative
Branch.
The
President
has
threatened
to
veto
just
about
any
piece
of
legislation
that
might
restrict
his
authority
to
waive
sanctions
or
limit
his
ability
to
make
a
deal
with
Iran.
After
the
presumed
passage
of the
Iran
Nuclear
Agreement
Review
Act,
and
in
the
case
a
deal
is
ultimately
struck
by
the
June
30
deadline,
Congress
would
have
30
days
to
review
any
potential
accord
with
Iran.
Congress,
Americans
and
people
around
the
world
must
use
that
time
to
carefully
examine
the
result
of
these
nuclear
negotiations
and
ask
if
it
puts
the
world
on
a
path
toward
peace.
Humanity
has
too
much
at
stake
to
permit
the
existence
of
a
path
leading
elsewhere.
Visiting
Community
Memorial
Healthcare
On
Saturday
afternoon,
I
traveled
to
Marshall
County
to
visit
Community
Memorial
Healthcare
(CMH)
in
Marysville.
CMH
is
a
Critical
Access
Hospital
that
has
been
serving
Marysville
and
the
surrounding
communities
since
1958.
A
few
years
ago,
CMH
opened
a
new
facility
with
the
goal
of
improving
and
modernizing
patient
care.
CMH
offers
a
wide-range
of
essential
health
care
services
at
the
hospital,
and
also
operates
outpatient
care
clinics
in
Wymore,
Blue
Rapids
and
Marysville. During
my
time
representing
Kansans
in
Washington,
D.C.,
I
have
had
the
opportunity
to
visit
each
of
the
127
community
hospitals
in
Kansas.
As
a
member
of
the
Senate
Appropriations
Health
Subcommittee,
which
has
funding
jurisdiction
over
most
agencies
within
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
(HHS)
that
impact
hospitals
and
providers,
meeting
with
Kansas
hospital
administrators,
physicians,
nurses
and
other
staff
gives
me
important
insight
on
the
challenges
they
face
caring
for
patients.
My
discussion
with
CMH
administrators
and
staff
spanned
various
topics
including
concerns
with
proposed
changes
in
Medicare
reimbursements
and
the
consequences
to
CAHs,
and
the
challenges
of
providing
quality
patient
care
under
regulations
that
don't
account
for
the
realities
of
delivering
care
in
a
rural
setting.
It
is
important
that
the
federal
government
allow
rural
providers
the
flexibility
necessary
to
adequately
care
for
their
patients,
many
of
whom
are
older
and
live
across
wide
areas.
I
will
continue
to
oppose
federal
policies
that
would
disproportionately
affect
health
care
access
in
Kansas
and
other
rural
states.
Thanks
to
CMH
CEO
Curtis
Hawkinson
for
hosting
my
visit.
Flipping
Pancakes
at
the
Combat
Air
Museum
On
Saturday,
I
started
my
day
by
flipping
pancakes
at
the
Forbes
Field
Combat
Air
Museum&#146;s
22nd
Annual
Celebrity
Pancake
Feed
benefiting
the
Combat
Air
Museum.
The
Combat
Air
Museum
has
served
as
an
educational
institution
and
tourism
destination
for
more
than
thirty
years.
It
is
one
of
only
a
few
major
aviation
museums
in
the
United
States
located
on
an
active
air
field.
The
event
had
a
great
turnout
and
was
a
lot
of
fun.
Thanks
again
to
Gene
Howerter
for
the
invitation
to
participate.
Honored
