Rep. Lipinski Invites
Third District Residents
to Upcoming Town Hall Meeting and Senior
Fairs
Rep. Lipinski addresses
constituent concerns at a Town Hall Meeting in Willow Springs.
In the coming weeks, Congressman Dan Lipinski (IL-3) will be
hosting a Town Hall Meeting in Countryside and Senior Fairs in
Stickney and Lemont.
At the Town Hall Meeting, Third
District residents will be able to hear from Rep. Lipinski about his work on
their behalf at home and in Washington, as well as ask questions and
voice their opinions about federal issues.
Staff from the
Congressmans office will be available beginning one hour prior to the start
of the meeting to provide assistance with Medicare, Social Security,
veterans benefits, and other federal matters.
The Senior
Fairs will give seniors from the Third District an opportunity to get
assistance with a variety of issues from the Congressmans expert staff,
as well as local organizations, agencies, and businesses that provide
services to seniors.
I encourage residents of the Third District to come to my upcoming
Town Hall Meeting and Senior Fairs, said Rep. Lipinski.
As your
representative in Washington and someone who strives to improve the
quality of life in the communities I serve, it is critical that I hear
from you.
In addition, these events will be great opportunities
for you to get assistance with federal issues and learn about the wide
array of constituent services my office provides.
It is my
privilege to serve
you.
And always remember
that if you are not able to make it to these events you can always call
or stop by any of my offices in Chicago, Lockport, Oak Lawn, or Orland
Park.
