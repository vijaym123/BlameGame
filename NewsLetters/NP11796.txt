Greetings from the 19th
Dear Friend,
After a busy week of district meetings and votes in Washington, I wanted to take a few moments to update you on my work on my efforts to address a few important local issues.
On Monday, I shared my comments with EPA officials regarding the discharge of treated wastewater into the Kinderhook Creek from the Dewey Loeffel landfill Superfund site in Nassau.
Nearly 100 residents of Columbia and Rensselaer Counties
were on hand at St. Pauls Church in Kinderhook, where I reiterated my concerns about the lack of a comprehensive public health study on the contents of the discharged water. We have a right to know what is being discharged into our waterways and whether this water poses a threat to our communities or the ecosystem of the creek and Hudson River.
Last week, in a similar vein,
I joined members of Protect Ghent and the Preservation League of New York State
at the Art Omi facility to renew calls on state regulators to ensure new power lines proposed for Columbia County are planned and constructed with the utmost respect for our rural landscape, farms, and historic properties. I believe this project, and similar upgrades to our infrastructure, need to employ technologies that safeguard the character of the small towns of the Hudson Valley.
In legislative news, I am pleased to report that the House overwhelmingly passed H.R. 3370, the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act. This bipartisan bill seeks corrective action to address skyrocketing flood insurance rates initiated by FEMA without Congressional consent. This constituent-driven reform will bring relief to thousands of New York homeowners, many of whom have never experienced flooding but were subjected to insurance premium increases in the thousands of dollars.
Another consumer-friendly bill passed the House this week, H.R. 4076, the Home Heating Emergency Assistance Through Transportation (HHEATT) Act. This bipartisan bill seeks to lower the cost of home heating oil and propane during these cold winter months by granting emergency exemptions to fuel companies to make deliveries for longer hours. I will continue to advocate for regulatory improvements that lower energy costs and make it easier to run a small business.
You can track my votes on every piece of legislation on my official
website . I also urge you to connect with me via
Twitter .
I look forward to two important community events this weekend, as I join families at the Sullivan County Boys &amp; Girls Club Dinner in Callicoon and firefighters at the Pawling Fire Department Installation dinner at the Trinity Pawling School. I am honored to help recognize citizens who give so much back to their communities.
As always, please contact me or my office if we can be of assistance.
With warm regards and thanks,
Chris Gibson
Member of Congress
P.S. Please forward this on to any other veterans you think may be interested in attending!
