This morning, Jan Schakowsky issued an inspiring call to action to Illinois Democrats.
And your response has been nothing short of I-N-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E!!! 206 people and counting
have stepped up for Brad -- just in the last 6 hours!!!
If we can hit
500 strong
by midnight, it&rsquo;ll be a
SERIOUS setback
for all the right-wing groups trying to drag Brad&rsquo;s record through the mud. David Johnson According to our records, it looks like you haven&rsquo;t answered Jan&rsquo;s call to action. But don&rsquo;t worry -- there&rsquo;s still time!!!
