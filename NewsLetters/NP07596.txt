Making Life Work for All
Americans
Growing the economy and creating good paying jobs is still
my top legislative priority in Washington. Over the past months, the
House has passed more than forty bipartisan jobs bills to help jump
start our economy and make life work a little better for
Americans.

opportunities and making life work for all
Kansans.
That is why I'm proud to announce our 4th
annual 3rd District Job Fair. If you are looking for work, or know
someone who is, tell them about our upcoming job fair on Thursday, August

veterans only. Then from 10:00am until 1 in the afternoon, the job fair will
be open to everyone. Plus, it's completely free to
attend.

Achieving a Better Life Experience
I'm very encouraged that
needed legislation is gaining overwhelming bipartisan support in both
chambers of Congress, and I'm hopeful the
ABLE Act
(Achieving a Better Life
Experience Act)
will become law very soon. Americans with
Down syndrome and other developmental disabilities and their families
have every right to enjoy their lives to the fullest, including
available education and job
opportunities.
Please

here
to read an important article from
National Journal
about the progress of the ABLE Act - legislation of which I am a proud
cosponsor.
Thank you to Rachel Mast, speaking
with me at last year's Step Up for Down Syndrome event at Arrowhead
Stadium, for her steadfast advocacy of this important legislation, those
with Down syndrome, and all Americans living with a
disability.
Visiting About Kansas Agriculture
I appreciated meeting
with several members of the
Kansas Grain and Feed
Association
and the
Kansas Agribusiness Retailers
Association
in my Washington, DC office. We had a great conversation and
they updated my on several important issues to the agriculture
community, including transportation needs for Kansas ag producers,
implementation of the farm bill, and a numbers of proposed regulations that
will make the Kansas agriculture way of life more
difficult.
As Vice Chair of the House
Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, I thank these Kansas agriculture
leaders for their feedback and for visiting with
me.
3rd District Medical Student Visits Washington
I
really enjoyed meeting with Marcus Rushing last week in Washington,
DC. Marcus is a
2014 United Health Foundation Diverse Scholars
Initiative Forum
attendee, and he's from Overland Park. He's
one of only 100 scholar students from across the country who have
earned the opportunity to attend the forum this year. Congratulations on
this well deserved recognition,
Marcus.
Congratulations to Marcus for this outstanding achievement and
best of luck to him in his future studies.
Sen. Dole Celebrates
91st Birthday
I took a moment on the House floor last week
to wish Russell, Kansas native
Senator Bob Dole
a
happy birthday. Sen. Dole turned 91 last Tuesday, and has spent a
remarkable life in the service of his fellow Kansans, and our
country.
Sen. Dole has always been a great role model of mine. I join
Kansans from across the Sunflower State in thanking him for his
leadership, and I wish him many more happy and healthy birthdays ahead. You can

floor.
Member of Parliament Visits
Washington
I had the opportunity to meet with
British Member of
Parliament Andrew Bridgen
from North West Leicestershire. He
visited Washington, DC along with several other MPs to shadow Members
of Congress for the afternoon to observe various meetings and see the
House debate and vote.
I enjoyed meeting
with MP Bridgen and discuss the similarities and differences between
our two bodies of government.
Meeting Future Kansas
Leaders
It was a pleasure to address participants of the
Youth
Leadership Institute
in Overland Park last week. I surprised
these high school leaders with a civics pop quiz and we discussed the
mechanics of the federal government; including Congress, and issues
ranging from our national debt, student loans, and immigration to
foreign affairs.
Thank you to the
Overland Park Rotary Club
for
providing this great leadership opportunity for high school students in our
area.
