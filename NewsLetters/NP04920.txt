This morning, Joe Kennedy issued an
inspiring
call-to-action to Illinois Democrats. And your response has been...
814 people and counting
have stepped up for Brad -- that&rsquo;s JUST SINCE 9 AM!!! (Talk about real grassroots power!)
If we can hit
1,000 strong
by midnight, it&rsquo;ll send a
BLISTERING message
to Boehner:
Illinois wants NO part of your Tea Party agenda.
Our records show you haven&rsquo;t yet had a chance to answer Joe Kennedy&rsquo;s call-to-action.
