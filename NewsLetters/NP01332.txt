Friend
We must stand with our brothers and sisters in the Middle East who are being persecuted for their faith.
Recently, I cosponsored
H.Res. 139
to condemn violence against minorities in the Middle East, and any actions limiting the free expression and practice of faith. The resolution also reaffirms the U.S. commitment to promoting religious freedom and tolerance, and urges President Obama to appoint a Special Envoy to Promote Religious Freedom of Religious Minorities in the Middle East (a position which Congress created last year, and the Administration has yet to fill).
I will keep you posted on the Resolutions progress in the House.
Yours in service,
Randy
