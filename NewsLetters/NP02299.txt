Thank you for reading The Conaway Chronicle, a review of my activities in Congress.
ATF Backs Down on Ammunition Ban
Tuesday, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives responded to pressure from Congress and the American people and announced that they would be halting their attempt to ban certain types of ammunition, such as .223 M855 green tip bullets.
I joined more than half of the Members of the House of Representatives to send a letter to the ATF Director opposing any ammunition ban of this nature. The second amendment rights of the American people must not be infringed upon by the Obama Administration.
Visiting Meals on Wheels of Odessa
Earlier in the week, I had the opportunity to tour Meals on Wheels of Odessa and meet with the director of the program, Margaret Burton. Meals on Wheels of Odessa serves approximately 450 meals each day to seniors and the disabled thanks to the generosity of volunteers.
Our communities thrive when we come together and volunteer our time and resources with those who need it most. Meals on Wheels of Odessa is one of many great organizations in the 11th district. A big thank you to Margaret for taking the time to share all the remarkable work you are doing with me.
Buffalo Trail Council's Recognition Banquet
I recently had the honor of being the guest speaker at the Buffalo Trail Council's Recognition Banquet. In 2014, twenty-one young men from eighteen counties in West Texas earned the designation of Eagle Scout. Attaining this rank in Boy Scouts requires a lot of time, work, and effort, and I could not be more proud.
Angelo State, Tarleton State Start Tournament Play
Tomorrow, the Angelo State University Rams make their fifth NCAA Division II South Central Championship appearance. Even though they are playing my alma mater, good luck to the Rams! Tarleton State University also made the tournament as the number one seed, and are set to play St. Mary's later on in the day.
As always, you can follow me on

Sincerely,
Rep. Mike Conaway, 11th District
