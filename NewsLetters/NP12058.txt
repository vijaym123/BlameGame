Dear Friends,
We remember the past. We look to the future. And we must never stop moving forward. February is Black History Month and this year we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. There is no question that it changed the way we live, and the world we live in. Together, we must continue to defend the defenseless, speak for those who are silent, and stand up for justice and peace.
