Dear Friend,
It was a beautiful morning on Saturday to break ground for the next West Orange Habitat for Humanity home in Winter Garden. Noemi Carbajal and her children, Griselda and Joel, will be the new owners of this home, and I am looking forward to having them as part of our community.
Earlier last week, Sandy joined me for the first annual West Orange Habitat for Humanity breakfast. Habitat for Humanity is a great organization that provides a hand up to low income families who are willing to invest in building a better future. It has been my pleasure to join Habitat volunteers in putting on a hardhat, nailing nails, building walls, and participating in the numerous groundbreaking and home dedication ceremonies like the one we just celebrated on Saturday.

Last Wednesday, I spent the day in Tavares, where Tammey Rogers and Bill Neron took me on a tour of the new Tavares Pavilion on the Lake. Tammey was the chief interior designer for their beautiful new facility that was built in the heart of Americas Seaplane City, and is already booked for evening events, weddings, and special occasions. Jutted out on Lake Dora, the pavilion is a beautiful addition to Lake County.
Some of the other visits I made in Tavares this week included:
-	Cornerstone Hospice and Palliative Care
-	Quality Design and Print
-	Tavares Chamber of Commerce
-	Brookdale at Tavares, formerly Sterling House
-	Tavares Chamber Monthly Luncheon

A few weeks ago, the Leesburg Partnership recognized several business leaders and community members for their dedication and service to the city. This week, I was privileged to meet many of those individuals and personally thank them for their investment into North Lake County. I stopped by Sellar Sewell Russ Saylor &amp; Johnson, P.A. and Frugals, two locations in Leesburg where the award recipients gathered so that I could meet them, see their business, and share my appreciation for their service.
During my time in Leesburg, I also spoke to members of the Optimist Club of Leesburg, stopped by Hunt Industrial Park to meet several small business owners, and hosted my largest listening session so far, located in the Royal Highlands community.

Last weekend, I was privileged to be a part of celebrating the 10 year anniversary of the Caribbean American Association of Lake County (CAALC). It was a pleasure meeting the president of the association, seeing several of our local Caribbean leaders, and thanking the CAALC members for their economic and personal contributions to our community.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Recently, a constituent from Leesburg contacted my office regarding his pending passport application. The constituent had requested and paid for expedited processing, but was concerned that he had not heard anything on his application. His traveling date was quickly approaching, so he called my office to see if he could get a status update. We reached out to the National Passport Center (NPC) and they were able to confirm that the application had been received and approved. After it was printed and sent, the NPC provided the tracking number and the passport was delivered the next day.
The constituent enthusiastically expressed his gratitude and appreciation for the help and information that we were able to provide.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
In my last newsletter, I shared the encouraging news that the deficit has continued to shrink over the last four years since I have been in Congress. However, we are still running an annual deficit and have trillions of dollars of debt that I refuse to simply ignore and pass on to my children and grandchildren.
Should the federal government continue on this path of reducing the deficit and balance our budget within the next ten years, even if it means making difficult decisions?
Yes
No

Legislative Update:
The Community Foundation of South Lake sponsored the First Annual South Lake Philanthropy Day this week, and asked me to provide an update regarding federal legislation related to charitable giving.
We live in a charitable country. In 2013, total contributions amounted to $335.17 billion, with 72% of that given by American individuals.
Currently, the tax system provides a series of benefits for tax-exempt and charitable organizations with the estimated largest and most widely discussed being the deduction for charitable contributions. The estimated charitable deductions for 2014 amounts to $46.4 billion
This year, the House passed HR 4719, the
America Gives More Act , which included several key
provisions to encourage charitable giving. The legislation:
-	made permanent the expanded charitable deduction for contributions of food inventory
-	made permanent the tax-free distributions from IRAs for charitable purposes
-	made permanent an increased 50% deduction of conservation easement contributions
-	allows charitable contributions made up to April 15 of each year to be included on the previous years tax return
-	reduced from 2% to 1% the excise tax on net investment income of private foundations and certain charitable trusts
I was grateful to be a part of South Lake Countys Philanthropy Day, and appreciate the generosity and personal commitment that so many members of our community have given to meet our local needs.
