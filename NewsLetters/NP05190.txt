David -- Early this morning,
The Cook Political Report
named Cheri one of the MOST vulnerable Democrats in the entire country.
Here&rsquo;s the bottom line: the election is 10 days out and our race is in a dead heat. If we don&rsquo;t get the facts out to voters, Cheri will lose.
David, this is an all-hands-on-deck-moment. According to our records, you haven&rsquo;t chipped in online to Cheri&rsquo;s Democratic campaign for Illinois.
Can we count on you to make a donation before the election?
