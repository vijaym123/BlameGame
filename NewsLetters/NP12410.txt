Yet Another Delay in
the Affordable Care Act
The announcement by the
White House that yet another major element of the Affordable Care Act
(ACA) was being delayed is yet another astonishing admission by the Obama
Administration that the Act is completely unworkable.
This is
at least the 23 rd
time White House has unilaterally delayed
parts of his own health care law.
Although I am pleased
that small businesses will be spared from the mandate for another year,
at some point the Administration must realize that the ACA is a policy
disaster.
The inability of the Administration to implement
its most important priority suggests one of two things.
Either
the law is so hopelessly complex that it is impossible to implement or
the Administration is utterly incapable of carrying out its job.
Either way, it is just adds to the growing mountain of evidence that
the ACA is bad public policy.
The
Wall
Street Journal
weighed in on this latest action with an
insightful
editorial .
Job
and
Wage Growth Still Stagnant
The economy
continues remains stuck in the doldrums, with just 113,000 new jobs being
created last month, considerably below what most economists
expected.
If thats not bad enough, last week the
New York Times
reported that wages are also
stagnant:
Wages are stuck, and
barely rose at all in 2013. They were up 1.9 percent last year, or a mere
0.4 percent after accounting for inflation. Not only was that increase
even smaller than the one recorded in 2012, it was half the normal
rate of wage gains in the two decades before the last
recession.
For more than five years now, the Presidents economic
policies have failed to ignite strong economic growth.
It is time for
the President to work with the Congress to reduce the disincentives
that are keeping the economy from growing and create an environment that
stimulates job and wage growth.

Happy Valentines Day to Our
Vets
For more than a decade, I have invited the schools across
the 11 th
Congressional District to create Valentines for
Veterans at the East Orange and Lyons Veterans Administration health
care facilities.
This year the response was again
overwhelming
students from more than 40 elementary schools created thousands of
cards to brighten the day of some of the men and women who have
served so faithfully in our Armed Forces.
I salute the
teachers and students who responded to my request with such enthusiasm
and originality.
They recognize that we owe our veterans an
unending debt of gratitude.
To see some photos and read the list
of participating schools, please visit my Facebook
page .
And while youre there, I hope youll Like the
page.
That way you can follow some of what Im up to, both in
Washington and around the District.
Celebrating
Presidents Day
As America commemorates on Monday the 43
men who have served as president of the United States, I recommend
this interesting and informative
article
from the
American Legion Magazine
about the
four great presidents
George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham
Lincoln, and Teddy Roosevelt
who are immortalized on Mount
Rushmore.
