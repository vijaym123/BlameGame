Dear
Friends,
Earlier this week, I
chaired
the
first ever Congressional
hearing
on virtual
currencies, like Bitcoin.
Like many of you, I had never
heard of Bitcoin until a few
months ago. To this day, I
wont profess to be an
expert, but
I
am trying to learn as much as
I can .
At Mondays hearing
I learned that this
technology has, at times,
been
co-opted
by some criminals as a way to
finance illegal activities
online .
I also gathered,
though, that this new
technology has a tremendous
amount of
potential.

Opening statements at the
virtual currencies
hearing.
One way I like to think of
the current state of virtual
currencies is to think of the
internet itself. At the
beginning, many people were
concerned that the internet
would be nothing more than a
meeting place for tech savvy
criminals. Since then,
though, it has proven to be
so much more. The internet
has become a hub of
innovation and ingenuity, it
has made our everyday lives
simpler, it has grown our
economy and served as an
equalizer to those with
access. On Monday, I learned
that Bitcoin and other
virtual currencies may have
that same user-driven value
that should be cultivated,
not feared.
Mondays
hearing taught me that we
have to approach digital
currencies with a level
head.
We need to
make sure that our government
does not overreact and harm
this potentially
revolutionary technology. At
the same time, though, it is
critical that we make sure
Bitcoin and other digital
currencies are being used
responsibly and within the
framework of the law.
By bringing Bitcoin
out of the shadows, we can
help it to grow
responsibly.
Mondays hearing was a
great first step.
This is a formative time
for this technology; how the
government, and Congress,
react now may affect whether
Bitcoin, and the economic
benefits that may come along
with it, thrive here in the
United States.
For now, I think we
all need to learn more and
see what the future has in
store.
