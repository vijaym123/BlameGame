Dear Friend,
I can't believe 2013 has come to a close. The year flew by.
Although it had its ups and downs, last year was very productive.
In 2013, the House of Representatives voted to repeal and replace
ObamaCare, reign in the executive branch, and prevent wildfires, among
many other accomplishments.
I want to share some of the highlights with you.
Scrapping ObamaCare
We did more than you may realize to scrap ObamaCare. The media will
have you believe we did not make any real progress but it's simply not
true. We made 15 major changes. Seven different bills were signed into
law that directly repealed or rescinded funding from at least eight
different Obamacare provisions. While this is not the end of the story,
it gets us closer to our ultimate goal of full repeal. Click HERE
to read more about the changes Congress made.
Conservatives recognize that patient-centered reforms rooted in free
markets are the best way to lower costs and solve problems in our
health care system. That is why I joined a group of my Republican
colleagues last year to bring forward a pragmatic, practical and
portable free-market alternative to the current health care system, the
American Health Care Reform Act.
(Rep. Gosar speaks at a press conference unveiling the bill, September
18, 2013)
The bill fully repeals ObamaCare, spurs competition by allowing
Americans to purchase health insurance across state lines, reforms
medical malpractice laws, provides tax reform that allows families and
individuals to deduct health care costs, expands access to Health
Savings Accounts, and safeguards individuals with pre-existing
conditions from being discriminated against. Simply put, our bill is a
better way forward. Click HERE
to read more about the
American Health Care Reform Act.
The Broken Promise
Americans from Arizona to Alaska, California to Connecticut have lost
their current health-care plans despite the President's repeated
promise: "if you like your plan, you can keep it." Whether folks have
lost their plans due to cancellation, premium spikes or a shrinking
health-provider network, what Americans are learning now is something
the administration has known all along.
For too long, this darker side of the Affordable Care Act was hidden
from Congress and the American people. As a member of the House
Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (OGR), I was proud to
participate in an OGR hearing in Apache Junction on December 6. This
hearing offered me an opportunity to hear testimony directly from my
constituents about how ObamaCare is affecting them. I knew before the
hearing that ObamaCare was a terrible law, and the witnesses who
testified proved that. For example, Juli Dalton from Prescott told us
about how she will face a monthly premium increase of $800. As a
result, her family might have to sell their home and cars and may not
be able to afford the travel to visit her elderly father.
This law is a trainwreck full of broken promises. It is increasing
health care costs and interfering with the doctor-patient relationship.
ObamaCare must be repealed and, most importantly, REPLACED.
The Short-Cut King
Last year, I reintroduced my Resolution of No Confidence in Attorney
General Eric Holder. The resolution states "that it is the sense of the
House of Representatives that Congress has lost confidence in the
Attorney General of the United States and thereby requests his
immediate resignation." It currently has 139 cosponsors.
(Rep. Gosar's op-ed in The Washington Times, July 25, 2013)
I will continue calling for Mr. Holder's resignation until he steps
down. Then, it is my hope that President Obama will appoint someone who
will help restore trust in our justice system. Click HERE
to read my op-ed in The Washington Times about Attorney General
Holder's flagrant abuse of power through the Justice Department.
Holding the Feds Accountable
More than 550 people showed up in Mesa on August 22 to attend the
Congressional Field Hearing I held with fellow Arizona Congressmen
Franks (AZ-08), Salmon (AZ-05) and Schweikert (AZ-06) concerning IRS
abuse and EPA overreach. It is important, now more than ever, that we
hold the federal government responsible for its invasive actions
against its citizens, our state and our local governments.
Actions taken by activist bureaucrats are increasingly egregious.
Arizonans across the state are furious about the abuse and overreach
they see coming out of Washington. It's time to rein the federal
government back into its constitutional role.
(Rep. Gosar speaks to the media after the hearing, August 22, 2013)
By working together, our government can again be "of the people, by the
people and for the people." Click HERE
to read more about the
hearing in The Arizona Republic.
Creating Arizona Jobs
One of my top priorities remains my bipartisan jobs bill, the Southeast
Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act. It facilitates a federal
land exchange that will open the third-largest undeveloped copper
resource in the world, located near Superior, Arizona. Last year it
passed through the House Natural Resources Committee and awaits action
by the full House of Representatives.
(Rep. Gosar rallies thousands to fight for jobs, October 29, 2013)
This legislation would create more than 3,700 local jobs, generate
approximately $61.4 billion in economic activity and supply 25 percent
or more of the nation's domestic copper demand. I am optimistic this
legislation will be enacted this year.
Congress Can Help Prevent Wildfires
When it comes to wildfires, recent years have proven devastating to
Arizona and many of the western states. The tragic Yarnell Hill Fire,
which claimed the lives of 19 elite Hotshot firefighters, is still a
fresh and painful wound throughout Arizona. Fires in other western
states like Colorado's Black Forest wildfire and California's Rim Fire
also caused great destruction.
We must ensure that we are doing everything we can to prevent future
tragedies.
(Memorial service in Prescott for the 19 fallen Hotshot firefighters,
July 9, 2013)
My bipartisan wildfire prevention legislation, the Catastrophic
Wildfire Prevention Act, passed the House last year as part of a larger
forest health package and the Senate has already held a hearing on it.
The bill eliminates red tape, streamlines wildfire-prevention projects,
improves local coordination and brings more accountability to the
process. It will expedite the review and approval process for thinning
and grazing projects, so that wildfire-prevention projects can move
forward quickly when the public is at risk. It also gets the government
out of the way and empowers the private sector to create rural jobs by
resurrecting the timber industry, as loggers thin millions of acres of
overgrown forests.
I'm optimistic the President will sign forest health legislation into
law this year that will help prevent destructive wildfires as well as
stimulate our rural economies.
Honoring Those Who Served Us
Arizona's Fourth District is home to many brave men and women who
served our nation in the Armed Forces. One of my top priorities is
ensuring they receive the benefits they earned through their honorable
service.
(Rep. Gosar presenting a flag flown over the US Capitol to honor
veterans at the Margaret T. Morris Center in Prescott, December 19,
2013. Photo courtesy of the Prescott Daily Courier)
Last year I supported a number of bills to help Veterans and their
families, including the American Heroes COLA Act and the Veterans
Economic Opportunity Act. I also voted to improve the processing of
disability claims by the Department of Veterans Affairs, which will
make great strides in reducing the current VA backlog.
America's brave men and women who serve in the military deserve our
utmost respect and appreciation. They risked their families, their
comforts, and their lives in order to protect the freedoms of their
fellow countrymen. For that sacrifice I am eternally grateful and will
continue to support veterans legislation.
As always, you can follow everything I am working on in Arizona and
Washington, D.C. through my website (http://gosar.house.gov

Dear

to

The

it's

We
made 15
major

The
Broken
Promise
Americans
from
Arizona
to
Alaska,
California
to
Connecticut
have
lost
their
current
health-care
plans
despite
the
President&#8217;s
repeated
promise:
&#8220;if
you
like
your
plan,
you
can
keep
it.&#8221;
Whether
folks
have
lost
their
plans
due
to
cancellation,
premium
spikes
or
a
shrinking
health-provider
network,
what
Americans
are
learning
now
is
something
the
administration
has
known
all
along.
For
too
long,
this
darker
side
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act was
hidden
from
Congress
and
the
American
people. As
a
member
of
the House
Committee
on
Oversight
and
Government
Reform
(OGR),
I
was proud
to
participate
in
an
OGR hearing
in
Apache
Junction
on
December
6.
This
hearing
offered
me
an
opportunity
to
hear testimony
directly
from
my
constituents
about
how
ObamaCare
is
affecting
them.
I
knew
before
the
hearing
that
ObamaCare
was
a
terrible
law,
and
the
witnesses
who
testified proved
that.
For
example,
Juli
Dalton
from
Prescott told
us
about
how
she
will face
a
monthly
premium
increase
of
$800. As
a
result, her
family might
have
to
sell
their
home
and
cars
and
may
not
be
able
to
afford
the
travel
to
visit
her
elderly
father.
This
law is
a
trainwreck
full
of
broken
promises. It
is
increasing
health
care
costs
and
interfering
with
the
doctor-patient
relationship.
ObamaCare
must
be
repealed
and,
most
importantly,
REPLACED.
The
Short-Cut
King
Last year,
I
reintroduced
my Resolution
of
No
Confidence
in
Attorney
General
Eric
Holder.
The
resolution
states
&#8220;that
it
is
the
sense
of
the
House
of
Representatives
that
Congress
has
lost
confidence
in
the
Attorney
General
of
the
United
States
and
thereby
requests
his
immediate
resignation.&#8221;
It currently
has 139
cosponsors.
(Rep.
Gosar's
op-ed
in
The
Washington
Times ,
July
25,
2013)
I
will
continue
calling
for Mr.
Holder's resignation
until
he steps
down.
Then, it
is
my hope
that President
Obama
will
appoint
someone
who
will
help
restore
trust
in
our
justice
system.

Accountable
More
than
550
people
showed
up
in
Mesa on
August 22 to
attend
the
Congressional
Field

I
held

fellow
Arizona
Congressmen

It
is
important,
now
more
than

that
we
hold
the
federal
government
responsible
for
its
invasive
actions
against
its
citizens,
our
state
and
our
local
governments.
Actions
taken
by
activist
bureaucrats
are
increasingly
egregious.
Arizonans
across
the
state
are
furious
about
the
abuse
and
overreach
they
see
coming
out
of
Washington.
It&#8217;s
time
to
rein
the
federal
government
back
into
its
constitutional
role.
(Rep.

This

would
create
more
than

in
economic
activity
and
supply
25

I
am
optimistic
this

will
be
enacted this

Congress
Can
Help
Prevent
Wildfires
When
it
comes
to
wildfires,
recent
years
have
proven
devastating
to
Arizona
and
many
of

The
tragic
Yarnell

which
claimed

Hotshot

is
still
a
fresh
and

throughout
Arizona.
Fires
in
other
western
states
like
Colorado's
Black
Forest
wildfire
and
California&#8217;s
Rim
Fire
also
caused
great
destruction.
We
must
ensure
that
we
are
doing
everything
we
can
to
prevent
future
tragedies.
(Memorial

My
bipartisan

the
Catastrophic

passed
the
House last
year
as
part
of
a
larger
forest

It
will
expedite

for
thinning

so
that
wildfire-prevention
projects
can
move
forward
quickly
when
the
public
is
at

It
also
gets
the

and
empowers
the
private
sector
to
create
rural
jobs
by
resurrecting
the
timber
