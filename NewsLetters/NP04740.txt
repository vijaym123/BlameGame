Dear Friends,
In our democracy, your voice matters. I value the opportunity to remind you that
today is Election Day . Don&rsquo;t forget to vote! Polls will be open from 7:00am to 8:00pm. To find your polling place, please

Decisions are made by those who show up. No matter who you vote for, I encourage you to take the time to exercise your right to vote tomorrow.
Remember that if you received a vote-by-mail ballot, you must return your ballot to the local county elections office by 8:00pm today. You can find your local county elections office by

Free and fair elections are essential to our democracy. If you witness or suspect election fraud, you may contact the California Secretary of State Voter Hotline at (800) 345-VOTE.
Sincerely,
Jim Costa
