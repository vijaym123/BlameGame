On January 14, the House passed a bill to defund
President Obamas unconstitutional executive amnesty and ensure the
Department of Homeland Security has the necessary resources to protect
American families.
The legislation that passed the House by a
vote of 236 to 191 appropriates $47.771 billion for the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS) while defunding the presidents executive
amnesty.
The legislation requires DHS to submit to Congress a plan
for situational awareness along the Southwest Border within 180 days,
and provides $382 million for border security fencing, infrastructure,
and technology.
The legislation also prohibits funds from being
used to transfer or release prisoners from Guantanamo.
Not
only does this legislation include a provision requiring the Secretary
of Homeland Security to enforce all existing immigration laws, it
defunds the presidents executive amnesty.
Immigration needs to be
reformed, but we still have rule of law in this country and the
Executive Branch does not get to unilaterally make this decision.
The
president is required by the Constitution to work with both Houses of
Congress and he must.
This bill prohibits any user fees or
appropriated funds made available to any federal agency, by any Act,
for any Fiscal Year, including specifically the USCIS Immigration
Examinations Fee Account, to implement, administer, enforce, or carry out
the Morton Memos and the executive actions announced in November
2014.
The legislation also prohibits federal funding from being used by
any agency to consider or judge any new, renewal or previously denied
application to President Obamas Deferred Action for Childhood
Arrivals program.
As a former constitutional law professor the
president knows that he must work with Congress if he desires a change
to a law and he does not have the power to act
unilaterally.
