Faces of
the Unemployed
As
May came to a close more than 2.9 million unemployed Americans,
including 153,400 Illinoisans, have lost their unemployment insurance
benefits even though they still cant find a job. Failing to renew
unemployment insurance has already costs our state economy $300 million, and it
has cost the American economy more than $5 billion!
I have consistently stood up for the unemployed,
I am a co-sponsor on the Senate-passed Renew UI Bill and I have signed
what is called a
discharge petition , to try to
make sure we get a vote on it in the House this year. If 218 members
of the House of Representatives sign the petition, we are guaranteed a
vote. So far 193 members have signed the
Renew UI
petition . A majority of Americans families support renewing UI. I
believe most of us feel this way because we have either been unemployed
ourselves or know someone who has. However, the House has not brought
Renew UI to a vote yet.
And that
is why I need your help. We have launched the
Faces of the Unemployed project .
Heres how it works.

unemployment has impacted your life or the lives of people you know. I
will gather your stories, and with your permission, share them with my
Congressional colleagues and the greater public. Too many families
are struggling. We have to keep up the fight to Renew UI.

ACA Enrollment Still Open to Some
As you probably know the general open enrollment period
for private health plans under the Affordable Care Act has closed, but
you may still be eligible to apply through special enrollment. If you
have had a Qualifying Life Event, like moving to a new state, certain
changes in your income, or changes in your family size including
marriage, divorce, or childbirth you can enroll today. Also, if you had
complex issues that kept you from enrolling before the March 31 deadline
you may still be able to enroll. These issues include delayed
Medicaid denials, system errors related to immigration status, domestic
abuse, misinformation and other enrollment errors. Individuals eligible for
Medicaid and Childrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP) can enroll
any time during the year. For more information please visit,
