Dear Friend:
Now that winter is officially behind us I, like most Floridians, am
looking forward to enjoying the longer and warmer days ahead.
To
celebrate the start of spring, I had the honor of participating in a
true North Florida tradition, the 46th Annual Springtime Tallahassee
Grand Parade.

I am also excited to share with you some of the latest news and notes
from Washington and Florida's Second Congressional District.
As
always, if you have not yet done so, please be sure to connect with me
on Facebook
and Twitter
so we can continue our discussion on the issues that
matter most to North and Northwest Florida.
Restoring Wages and Promoting Job Creation
This week a bipartisan majority of the House joined me in passing H.R.
2575, the Save American Workers (SAW) Act, by a vote of 248 - 179.
This important legislation will restore the traditional 40-hour work
week in order to protect millions of Americans from seeing their hours
cut as a result of the President's unworkable health care law. Due to
Obamacare's 30-hour work week definition, 2.6 million workers are
currently at risk of seeing reduced hours and lost wages.
By repealing
this definition, the SAW Act will provide much-needed relief to
struggling families across Florida while removing another barrier to
job creation.
Empowering Florida on Water Quality Management
This week the EPA, which had in 2009 singled Florida out for stricter
numeric nutrient criteria standards than the rest of the country,
reversed course due to overwhelming evidence that Florida's water
quality standards have been tremendously successful in strengthening
the health of our waterways.
I have worked closely with state lawmakers and business leaders to
ensure that Floridians spoke with one voice in opposing the EPA's
intrusion into our waterways. I believe the EPA was shortsighted in
imposing an unfair standard on Florida alone, and I am pleased that the
agency has recognized the tremendous progress that state officials have
already made in strengthening the health of our streams, lakes, and
canals.
Fighting for Northwest Florida Military
I was proud to recently join Congressman Jeff Miller (R-FL) in
welcoming local civic leaders to Washington for the annual Northwest
Florida Defense Fly-In.
The Northwest Florida Defense Coalition and
Bay Defense Alliance make the trip each year to advocate on behalf of
our local military bases.
Their passion for and commitment to
protecting our military instillations is critical to ensuring Northwest
Florida retains these important missions.
Standing up for Democracy
I was honored to recently visit with former Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice prior to the House voting on the Ukrainian aid
package.
Dr. Rice is an expert on Russian politics and she made clear
that freedom loving nations must stand up for fledgling democracies in
the region in the face of Russian aggression.
Supporting Higher Education
I recently had the privilege of serving as commencement speaker at the
ITT Technical Institute's graduation in Tallahassee.
I could not have
been more impressed with the people I met and the stories they shared
with me about pursing their goals in higher education.
I continue to
be committed to supporting all types of higher education to create more
opportunities for people seeking to advance their education.
Sincerely,
Steve Southerland, II
