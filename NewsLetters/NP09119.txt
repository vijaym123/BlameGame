Dear Friends,
This week marks National
Hurricane Preparedness Week,
which means its time
for us to get ready for the
2014 Atlantic hurricane
season that begins on Sunday,
June 1st.
Delawareans are no stranger
to the wrath of severe
tropical weather. In 2012,
Superstorm Sandy prompted
evacuations up and down the
state and tens of millions of
dollars worth of
damage to communities along
the East Coast. While
Delaware escaped the real
brunt of Sandy, it is
essential that we Delawareans
recognize the threats
associated with living in a
coastal state and take the
precautions necessary now to
keep our families, homes and
business safe during
hurricane-related
hazards.
Here are some ways to be
prepared:
Get a Kit .
Being prepared means being
equipped with the proper
supplies you may need in the
event of an emergency or
disaster. Keep your supplies
in an easy-to-carry emergency
preparedness kit that you can
use at home or take with you
in case you must
evacuate.
Make a Plan .
It is important to make sure
that the entire family is
prepared and informed in the
event of a disaster or
emergency. You may not always
be together when these events
take place and should have
plans for making sure you are
able to contact and find one
another.
Be Informed .
Learn the types of disasters
or emergencies that may
likely occur in your area.
These events can range from
those affecting only you and
your family, like a home fire
or medical emergency, to
those affecting your entire
community, like a hurricane,
tornado or flood.
Stay safe, be ready and
have a great start to the
summer.
