Dear Friend,
On July 4, 1776, the
Continental Congress officially adopted a document penned by Thomas
Jefferson declaring the American colonies independence from England and
the rule of King George III. In the following days, the document was
distributed throughout the colonies, printed in newspapers, and read
publicly in front of celebratory crowds. One year later, Philadelphia
marked the day with bonfires, bells, and fireworks. This became an
annual celebration that spread across the United States and came to include
parades, military displays, speeches, and picnics.
In his
last letter ever written, Thomas Jefferson wrote of the
50 th
anniversary of the Declaration of Independence: May it be to the
world, what I believe it will be
the signal of arousing men to burst
the chains
and to assume the blessings and security of
self-government. That form, which we have substituted, restores the free right to
the unbounded exercise of reason and freedom of opinion. All eyes are
opened, or opening, to the rights of man. For ourselves, let the annual
return of this day forever refresh our recollections of these rights,
and an undiminished devotion to them.
As we celebrate the
birth of our nation, let us remember the sacrifices of the many
Americans who came before us.
I wish you a happy and safe
Independence Day!
Best,
Rochester
