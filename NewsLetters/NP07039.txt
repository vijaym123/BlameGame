For 79 years, Social Security has provided millions of Americans the opportunity to retire with dignity. But some extremist Republicans want to dismantle this critical program.

David --
For generations, we&rsquo;ve made a promise to our seniors:
If you work hard and play by the rules, we&rsquo;ll make sure you get the retirement security you deserve.
Social Security has kept that promise. Unfortunately, despite its time-tested benefits, some Republicans want to gut this critical program. Cheri&rsquo;s proud to oppose their radical plan.
If you agree we&rsquo;ve got to protect Social Security, now&rsquo;s the time to say it: Click here to sign your name to demand Congress protect Social Security for generations to come &gt;&gt;
