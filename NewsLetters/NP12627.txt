Affordable Care Act will drive 2 million people from
workforce
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
issued a chilling report earlier this week on the affect of the
Affordable Care Act on American workers.
As the
Washington Post
reported in a front page story:
The
CBO predicts that the economy will have the equivalent of 2.3 million
fewer full-time workers by 2021 as a result of the law
nearly three
times previous estimates.
As the disastrous roll-out
of this program continues, it seems there is no end of bad news about
the ramifications of this ill-conceived law.

Why President Obama Needs Republicans to Increase Trade, Create
Jobs
Increasing international trade creates jobs in New
Jersey and across the country by opening overseas markets to U.S.
goods and services.
President Obama knows it, as do clear
bipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate.
But because
the Senate Majority Leader opposes giving the President Trade
Promotion Authority (TPA), it is going to be difficult to move this
legislation through the Senate.
Writing in the
Wall
Street Journal , William Galston of the Brookings
Institution (and a former Clinton White House domestic policy staffer),
makes the case for presidential leadership in forging a bipartisan
majority to get this important legislation to the Presidents desk for
signature.
Currently, negotiations are underway for
three
new free trade agreements :
The Trans Pacific
Partnership with Pacific-Rim countries (Australia, Brunei Darussalam,
Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore,
and Vietnam);
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment
Partnership with the European Union (EU); and
The Trade in
Service Agreement, a service only agreement with 23 World Trade
Organization signatories including the EU, Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan
and Mexico to name a few.
You can find Galstons
piece

Saluting Monument Man Harry
Ettlinger of Rockaway Township
When the motion
picture, Monuments Men, opens in theaters today, audiences will surely be
inspired by the story of the Allied heroes who found and returned to
their rightful owners many of the millions of paintings, sculptures, and
other works of art and culture that had been stolen and hidden away
by the Nazis during their brutal subjugation of Europe.
What
moviegoers will not know, however, is that one of the men whose story
is portrayed in the movie is alive and well and living in the
11 th
Congressional District of New Jersey.
Harry Ettlinger
of Rockaway Township is, at 88 years old, one of the few surviving
members of what was officially known as U.S. Armys Monuments, Fine Arts
and Archives Section.
His incredible story is portrayed in what
deserves to be a blockbuster hit.
Mr. Ettlinger is an old
friend and advisor.
Heres a link to a heartwarming article that
tells his remarkable
story .
Rodneys Tele-Town-Hall Meeting: I am
listening!
This past Tuesday, thousands of constituents joined me for a
Tele-Town-Hall meeting.
I was delighted to be able to speak directly
with callers, answering their questions on such diverse topics as
jobs, immigration, taxes, and food stamps and listening to their opinions
and advice.
These Tele-Town-Halls are a great way for me
to stay in touch with what the people in the 11 th
District
are thinking.
I also enjoy hearing from people through letters
and email.
