Rubio Introduces Bill Preventing
Taxpayer-Funded Bailouts Of Insurance
Companies Under ObamaCare
On Thursday, Marco introduced
The
ObamaCare Taxpayer Bailout Prevention
Act , a bill that would eliminate a
provision of ObamaCare that allows for
taxpayer-funded bailouts of insurance
companies at the Obama
Administrations sole discretion.
This is the first piece of legislation
introduced by Marco in the 114
th
Congress.
The bill would repeal section 1342 of
ObamaCare, which establishes a risk
corridor program to distribute money from
exchange plans that earned profits to
exchange plans that suffered losses.
However, the risk corridor program was
not designed to be budget neutral, and
section 1342 of ObamaCare puts the
American taxpayer at risk of a taxpayer
bailout if insurers systematically lose
money on exchange plans. By repealing
Section 1342, the legislation would force
the administration to come back to
Congress to request appropriations to
cover any losses in the program.
One of the biggest threats to
the American Dream is the rising cost
of living, which ObamaCare is making
worse through rising health care costs
and loss of coverage,
said
Rubio . Taxpayers should
not have to fund massive bailouts to
protect the profits of the insurance
companies that helped
writeObamacare, which is why
Ive been fighting for over a
year to protect taxpayers from yet
another bailout that puts them on the
hook for Washingtons
mistakes.
Under Decembers
omnibus spending bill, taxpayers are
protected from bailing out insurance
companies until September 30, but now
Congress has the opportunity to take
the possibility of a bailout off the
table for good,
added Rubio . By passing
this bill, Congress will ensure that no
bailout will occur, in 2016 or
ever.
Rubio Joins Bipartisan Push To
Reform Student Loan Repayment
Programs
Marco joined U.S. Senators Angus King
(I-ME) and Richard Burr (R-NC), along
with Senators Mark Warner (D-VA), Susan
Collins (R-ME) and Lamar Alexander
(R-TN), in introducing legislation to
reform federal student loan repayment
programs.
The
Repay Act
, which Senators King and Burr
originally introduced last Congress,
would simplify the complex maze of
federal student loan repayment
programs by consolidating many of
the benefits of current repayment
programs into two plans: a fixed
repayment plan, based on a 10-year
period, and a single, simplified
income-driven repayment option.
Helping more people achieve
the American Dream requires equipping
them with the education and training
necessary to do the jobs of the 21st
century,
Rubio said . The Repay Act
would help modernize the income-based
repayment system for student loans,
which Senator Warner and I have also
been working on for the past year.
We need reforms like this to
ensure that the burden of student loans
is more manageable to discourage
overborrowing,
Rubio added . I believe
this bills requirement for the
GAO to study the best way enroll,
verify income and facilitate
income-based repayment programs will
ultimately help build momentum for
other initiatives I will continue
working on as the Senate considers
higher education reform later this
year.
This is Marcos latest effort to
reform student loan repayment programs.
In July 2014, Marco and Warner introduced
The
Dynamic Student Loan Repayment Act
to
consolidate, simplify and improve
income-based repayment options for
federal student loans.With the
bipartisan Rubio-Warner proposal, all
federal student loan payments would be
automatically adjusted based upon income.
Borrowers will be able to repay loans at
a more affordable pace and with more
manageable and easily-facilitated
payments, providing relief to those who
worry about how they will repay their
debt just as they are getting started in
the workforce.
Rubio Comments On Recent Cuban
Prisoner Releases, Date Set For
Normalization Talks
On Friday, Marco issued the following
statement regarding reports of political
prisoners who have recently been released
in Cuba, as well as the Obama
Administrations announcement that
Assistant Secretary of State for Western
Hemisphere Affairs Roberta Jacobson will
lead a delegation to Havana on January
21-22 to discuss normalizing
relations:
The recent Cuban prisoner
releases and the Obama
Administrations announced trip
to Havana on January 21 for
normalization talks raise many
troubling questions and are proof that
President Obama negotiated a bad
deal.
As Ive said before,
its a mistake for the
administration to proceed with
legitimizing and enriching the Castro
regime as part of the one-sided deal
President Obama announced last month.
Nonetheless, the very least they can do
now is ensure that the 53 political
prisoners that the administration and
regime agreed would be freed are
actually released unconditionally.
Its a good thing that
these Cuban activists who have
reportedly been released in recent days
will not have to spend another day in
Castros political prisons. No
one should ever ignore the fact that
these individuals should never have
been imprisoned in the first place.
However, there are reports of
conditions being placed on these
political prisoners release and
threats made against them if they
decide to re-continue their efforts in
support of freedom for the Cuban
people. Thats not freedom, and
the administration must answer if these
conditional, potentially short-lived
releases are, in fact, what it agreed
to with the regime and why it took so
long for them to be released.
As a whole, the Obama
Administration needs to be more
transparent about all aspects of its
secret deal with the Castro regime,
starting with these 53 political
prisoners. Im very concerned by
the White Houses suggestion that
being transparent about these 53
political prisoners is
counterproductive because it would put
even bigger targets on them. On the
contrary, knowing the prisoners
names, conditions and whereabouts is
critically important in order for the
U.S. to hold the regime accountable and
for the American people to hold the
administration accountable for its
deal. So far, the only reason we know
about these prisoner releases is
because of the work of civil society
groups in Cuba, not because the Obama
Administration has been transparent and
forthcoming about this information.
The Administration has a lot
of questions to answer, and Im
looking forward to giving them an
opportunity to do so in upcoming
hearings this Congress. Congress should
not support changes to Cuba policy that
do not result in more freedom for the
Cuban people.
Given all this air of secrecy
surrounding the administrations
deal with Cuba as well the White
Houses suggestion that even freed
prisoners will still be targeted, the
President is wrong to move forward with
normalization talks in Havana later this
month.
