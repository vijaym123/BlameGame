How best to solve the various immigration issues faced by employers, employees, and parolees in the Northern Marianas was the topic of discussion with Ms. Carolyn Muzyka, Director for the Western Region of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, this week. Director Muzyka is responsible for Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii, Guam and the NMI. I also used the opportunity to thank her for all the hard work that USCIS staff in the Northern Marianas, Guam, and California have done to help our community through the immigration transition period.

Senate passes Territories Act, extending key immigration policies
The U.S. Senate passed the Omnibus Territories Act by unanimous consent on Wednesday night. The bill, S.1237 , extends until 2019 key policies of the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 that eases the transition to federal immigration in the Northern Mariana Islands. One policy, the CW foreign worker program, was already extended administratively by Labor Secretary Thomas Perez earlier this month. But three others will expire at the end of the year unless Congress acts. The remaining three policies:
*
Exempt Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands from the national limit on the number of H visas. The exemption was initially intended to provide labor during the military buildup on Guam, but could be important to fill the short-term need for skilled workers on expected hotel construction in the NMI over the next five years.
*
Continue to grandfather foreign investor visas originally granted under Northern Marianas immigration law. Allowing the 261 E-2C visa holders to remain in the Northern Marianas fulfills the promise made by the Commonwealth government that non-citizens who invested here could stay, as long as they maintained their investment.
*
Prohibit claims of political asylum in the Northern Marianas. Barring claims of asylum may be important to the decision by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to allow tourists from China to enter the Marianasand those tourists are critical to our economic recovery.
The bill is also intended to improve training for local workers to take over jobs in our economy. It requires the Governor to submit a plan to the U.S. Secretary of Labor for the $150 fee employers pay for each CW worker hired. The plan will spell out who gets the money$1.4 million in 2013, how the money will be used, and how many local workers we can expect to be hired as a result of the training. And each year the Secretary must report to Congress on whether those hiring goals are being met.

This year, Delta Airlines celebrated 25 years of being an integral part of our community.
I was honored to present this statement in honor of their accomplishments and commitment to the Northern Marianas.
I was joined by Sales Account Executive Mr. Chris A. Concepcion and Station Supervisor Mr. Karl Reyes for Delta Airlines on Saipan.
House passes Defense spending bill
Pay for our men and women in uniform will go up 1.8 percent under terms of the FY15 Department of Defense Appropriations Act
the House approved on Friday. The bill, H.R. 4870, increases defense spending to $491 billion, $4.1 billion more than in FY14. Despite the overall increase, the Formerly Used Defense Sites program, which is used to clean up areas where the military has left hazardous materials, was cut $54 million, a 20 percent reduction. The Northern Marianas was allotted $4 million in FY14 for FUDS projects. Other spending approved in this weeks defense appropriation include programs important for our service members to address suicide and to prevent and respond to sexual assault.

Whats good for the farmer
is good for everyone
That is the theme of the workshop that the United States Department of Agriculture is hosting at the Kagman Community Center on Wednesday, June 25, 6:30 p.m. Farming has been gaining momentum in the Northern Mariana Islands in the past few years, as evidenced by the increasing number of representatives that USDAs Food and Nutrition Service has been sending here to talk about grants, financing, risk management, technical assistance, and other opportunities for our local farmers. Your congressional office has encouraged this outreach by working with the Guam and Hawaii regional offices of FNS. This months visit is especially well timed, coinciding with the opening of the Garapan Public Market, where fishermen and farmers will be able to sell their products. The Garapan Public Market was paid for in part with a $200,000 congressional earmark I obtained for us in fiscal year 2010.
