Blaine's Bulletin
Bunnies, dyed eggs, and family traditions are just a couple of images that come to mind when many think of Easter Sunday.
However, we all know that Easter means so much more than chocolate filled eggs. Following the reflection and penance of the Lenten season, Easter Sunday represents a celebration of the resurrection of our Lord and the many sacrifices he made for us. Easter commemorates our Saviors triumph over sin, and we take joy in spending this day with our loved ones and reflecting on the many blessings we are given.
The House is in its district work period and it has been great getting in the car and traveling around the 3 rd
District to visit with many of you. One issue in particular that many have brought up is the sustainable growth rate. By way of background, for years, Medicare reimbursement rates have been tied to overall economic growth by a complicated formula known as the sustainable growth rate. Under this formula, payouts increase with inflation. The problem with this is the cost of delivering or administering health care tends to rise faster than inflation and, as a result, amounts to a pay cut that has forced doctors to make tough decisions for many years.
I am pleased to say the House of Representatives worked together to produce a bipartisan piece of legislation that will provide certainty for millions of Americans. The House passed with my support, and 396 of my colleagues, the repeal of the sustainable growth rate. Since 2002, Congress has been working on a solution to the sustainable growth rate and I am proud to say that permanent action has finally been taken. Congress has spent billions of dollars in short-term patches to avoid unsustainable cuts imposed by this flawed system and now stability and certainty will be returned to Medicare physician payments. Also included in this legislation, among other things, is the extension of Community Health Centers which play a critical role in the 3 rd
District and it extends the Childrens Health Insurance Program.
While the House has been in busy, it is always nice to take a step back and enjoy time with my family and grandchildren. This holiday is an opportunity for me to take my grandchildren to church and then watch the young children enjoy themselves as they search for filled eggs scattered around the lawn. And later we will all go home and look forward to the warmer weather and all the great things that springtime brings in central Missouri.
However not all of us are fortunate to be with loved ones on Easter Sunday. Let us also remember our brave men and women serving in uniform who are separated from their families. And let us pray for their safety and their strength and a quick return home.
I look forward to visiting with many more of you and heading back to Washington to continue to capitalize on our efforts prior to the district work period. On behalf of myself, my wife, and my staff, I want to send everyone greetings to those celebrating the joyful holiday of Easter.
