Dear Friend,
I spent a lot of
time on the road across the 9th District of Georgia last week and
wouldn't have had it any other way.
Talking to Northeast Georgians,
hearing what they have to say, and taking that back to Washington
isn't just the best part of my job, it's the most important
part.
Last week I spent time with some of my
youngest
constituents, and one of the
oldest .
From
schools
to
local group meetings to office visits, there are all kinds of ways we can
keep up with each other.
If you've got a group or a
business or a class you'd like us to highlight with a visit, please
let me know
here .
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of Congress
