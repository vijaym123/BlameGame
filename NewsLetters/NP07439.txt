Dear
Friends:
Today, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
announced that they will grant my request to keep the Lake Baldwin veterans
clinic and medical care facility open.
VA Acting Secretary Sloan
Gibson sent a letter informing me of his decision just prior to an
oversight hearing that I was about to Chair focusing on vacant and
underutilized federal properties.
I specifically highlighted at that
investigative hearing, the astounding 282 VA properties that sit idle,
including hospitals, veterans care facilities and veterans
housing.

Keeping the Lake
Baldwin VA clinic open is a victory for our Veterans.
VA estimates
confirm our belief that the growing Central Florida veteran population
warrants keeping this facility open.
I extend a special thank you
to veterans and community leaders who joined in supporting this
effort.
When Central Florida comes together in one voice, anything
and everything is possible.
With my regards and best wishes,
I remain
Sincerely,
John L. Mica
