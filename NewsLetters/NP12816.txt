This week, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio
continued efforts to prevent a potential
taxpayer-funded bailout of health insurance
companies under ObamaCare. As the ranking
member of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committees East Asian and Pacific
Affairs Subcommittee, Marco pressed the
Obama Administration on its approach to
human rights in China. He also commented on
President Obamas State of the Union
Address, and marked National Slavery and
Human Trafficking Prevention Month by
urging Congress to pass legislation to
combat sex and labor trafficking in child
welfare systems.

Rubio: We Should Not Be Bailing Out A
Failure
In this weeks installment of
Marcos Constituent Mailbox video
series, Marco revisited the likelihood of a
potential taxpayer-funded bailout of health
insurance companies under ObamaCare. He
read and responded to constituent letters,
addressing their concerns with the health
care laws flaws. You can watch the
video message
here
. An excerpt of his response is
below:
Rubio said
, What the law says is:
Now, the federal government,
meaning you and your taxpayer dollars,
will have to come in and bail these
companies out. To me, that is
absolutely wrong on two fronts. Number
one: government should not be
participating in using taxpayer funds to
bail out private companies. And number
two, the second problem is if
youve got to bail out ObamaCare
with federal funds, it tells you the law
is a failure. We should not be bailing
out a failure.
Rubio added
, Interestingly enough,
Im starting to receive, at this
point, quiet, bipartisan interest in the
issue. But I think in the months to come,
as we get closer and closer to the
reality that all of you are going to have
to be seeing your taxpayer dollars going
towards bailing out private companies at
a time when our national debt is at $17
trillion and growing, I think
youre going to see a growing
amount of support for that
position.
Along with Congressman Tim Griffin
(R-AR), Marco also welcomed new signs of
growing momentum against a bailout. In a
recent
letter
to Marco and Griffin, 33 national
groups and leaders, representing the views
of millions of Americans, formed a
coalition in support of legislation to
eliminate ObamaCare risk corridor
payments.
Rubio Presses Obama Administration On
Human Rights Approach To China
Marco, the ranking member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committees East
Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee,
sought clarity from the Obama
Administration on how it prioritizes human
rights and religious freedom as it relates
to China.
During a confirmation hearing for U.S.
Senator Max Baucus (D-MT), President
Obamas nominee to be U.S. ambassador
to China, Marco asked Baucus whether the
U.S. embassy and consulates in China would
be islands of freedom for
pro-democracy leaders. He also questioned
Baucus on his willingness, should he be
confirmed, to demonstrate his commitment to
religious freedom by attending religious
services of religions not officially
recognized by the government.
Rubio
: I hope that it is clear that
we want a good relationship with China,
but not at the expense of the fundamental
human rights that define us as a nation
and as a people.

Rubio Comments On State Of The Union
Address
On Tuesday, Marco issued the following
statement regarding President Obamas
State of the Union Address:
Rubio
: Americans deserve more
opportunities to achieve a better life,
and thats going to require a free
enterprise economy thats creating
more middle class jobs and a government
with less debt. While the President
discussed some areas of common interest,
the heart of his 2014 agenda is clearly
more about working alone than with the
American peoples representatives
on the major reforms we need.
President Obama missed an
opportunity on several fronts, especially
by insisting that Washington keep
spending more money than it takes in,
keep dictating to entrepreneurs how to
run their businesses, and failing to
level with the American people about how
we can save our retirement programs. We
need a real opportunity agenda that helps
people seize the enormous potential that
the coming years hold.

Credit. Listen

Rubio Marks National Slavery &amp;
Human Trafficking Prevention Month,
Pushes For Reforms In Child Welfare
Systems
Marco marked National Slavery and Human
Trafficking Prevention Month and urged
Congress to pass
The Strengthening
the Child Welfare Response to Human
Trafficking Act
, a bill he and U.S. Senator Kay Hagan
(D-NC) introduced last month to combat sex
and labor trafficking in child welfare
systems.
Watch his
video message at an
anti-human trafficking event
hosted by Free The Slaves at Broward
College. An excerpt of the message is
below:
In South Florida, our community
knows all too well how much of a problem
this is. Just this month, a human
trafficking ring was busted at a Miami
Beach strip club. Their victim was a
13-year old girl. 13 years old,
Rubio said.
It seems unconscionable that
anyone would target and exploit our
precious children like this. But they do,
and we need to do more to stop it,
Rubio continued . Last year,
Congress took an important step to combat
human trafficking by reauthorizing
landmark legislation. But significant
gaps remain.
Thats why Ive
introduced The Strengthening the
Child Welfare Response to Human
Trafficking Act
a bill to
combat sex and labor trafficking in child
welfare systems across the country. And
we need your support to pressure Congress
to get it passed and signed into law this
year,
Rubio added .

Constituent Casework Corner
Kathleen and her husband, who is a legal
permanent resident, live in North Florida
and are in the process of adopting a child
in the U.S. For several months they were
waiting for the results of their background
investigation to be completed so they could
move forward with the process. Kathleen
contacted Senator Rubios office for
assistance. A member of the staff contacted
the Federal Bureau of Investigations and
learned that because her husband is not an
American citizen, the FBI was waiting on
information from other authorities outside
of the United States. However, after our
caseworker contacted them, the FBI
collected the information they needed
within a few days and the investigation was
completed. The couple was able to move
forward with the adoption proceedings.
