Ted Cruz is going to HATE this:
Just moments ago, he was riling up Tea Party activists with promises to wipe out Democrats in this election. He even called Democrats an &ldquo;extremist radical party.&rdquo;
Well, we&rsquo;ve got some shocking news for Cruz: Since President Obama&rsquo;s call-to-action this morning, over 11,664 of you have chipped in to defeat Ted Cruz&rsquo;s Tea Party buddies. That&rsquo;s EXACTLY the news we needed.
If we can bring in 8,336 more donations, it will be a CRUSHING blow to Cruz&rsquo;s plans to wreck President Obama&rsquo;s second term.
