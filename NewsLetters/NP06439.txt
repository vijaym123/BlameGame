We will #NeverForget
Dear Friend:
Thirteen years ago this morning, our nation was shaken as nearly three thousand innocent men, women, and children lost their lives in the September 11th terrorist attacks. We will never forget the horrific events of that fateful day, nor will we forget those lives lost and the countless loved ones they abruptly left behind.
This Patriot Day, flags across the country will be displayed at half-staff as we remember the thousands of innocents tragically lost and honor those heroes who bravely answered the call to duty when their fellow Americans needed them.
We also keep in mind those who have continued to work around the clock to keep our nation safe and secure from future terrorist attacks
from our local emergency responders to the members of our Armed Forces. They put their lives on the line and take risks every day for us
we owe them and their families a tremendous debt of gratitude.
The world as we knew it was forever changed that morning through the acts of violent extremism. The brutal destruction, heartbreak, and bloodshed that most of us only recognized from overseas news reports, history books, or the movies became a reality upon our shores.
Ongoing instability in the Middle East and elsewhere reminds us that those who would use terror and violence against others to achieve their goals still exist. The terrorist organization ISIS poses a very serious and credible threat to the world and here at home. There is no question that we must destroy that radical threat before its terrors reach our shores. The United States should be part of a broad coalition of forces to get that job done, and I look forward to hearing the specific details of such a strategy in the days ahead.
We live in a much different world today than we did before the terrorist attacks of September 11th. While much has changed, our American values and resolve remain strong.
God bless,
Fred Upton
