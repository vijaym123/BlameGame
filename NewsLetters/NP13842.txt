Over fifty years ago, one
important decision was made that changed the entire course of my life: my
parents adopted me as an infant and brought me home as their own.
Their decision to bring home a child in need of a home made a world of
difference for me, and I am reminded of that blessing more so now as a
grandfather of three beautiful grandchildren. My parents laid the
foundation for these blessings and as Thanksgiving nears, I couldnt ask
for another blessing that gives as much as they did on that day years
ago.
The season is upon us where families and friends gather,
count their blessings and enjoy the company of others, but many
children remain in the care of the state rather than at home with a loving
family, and there are many families that wait for the opportunity to
give a child a permanent loving home. I am also thankful to my birth
mother for choosing adoption, which is why I continue to advocate for
birth mothers to know that adoption is an option. As a Member of the
U.S. House of Representatives, I am grateful for the opportunity to
continue to work on these issues at the federal level. November is also
National Adoption Month.
As a leader on adoption issues in the
U.S. House I have introduced and managed efforts impacting
adoption:
The Adoption Information Act (H.R. 3062): Domestic
adoptions are more important now than ever as countries like Russia are
closing their doors to American adoptions (sentence verbatim from Dear
Colleague). I authored this legislation to ensure that birth mothers are
aware of adoption as an option during pregnancy, and for family planning
service providers to present pamphlets containing a list of adoption
centers to any individual who requests abortion services or inquiries
about any related information. I believe it is vital that women have
all the necessary tools and opportunities to make the most informed
decision regarding their health and their unborn baby. This legislation
would truly enable women facing an unplanned pregnancy to be aware of
the option of adoption and to help families who are longing to have a
child of their own to have that chance.
The Protecting
Adopted Children Act (H.R. 3423): Recent media reports highlighted the
issue of re-homing, where adoptive families have unfortunately
transferred adopted children into the homes of strangers, in an unregulated and
underground process. This bill directs resources for states to assist
adoptive families, to help provide a more stable home environment and
prevent children from entering the foster care system or other
less-regulated networks through the provision of pre- and post-adoptive
support services.
Congress can and must take action to help the
women, children and families affected by these issues.
My
best to you, your family and friends on Thanksgiving and all during
this holiday season.
