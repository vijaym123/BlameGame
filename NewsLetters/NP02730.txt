Dear Friend,
Many of my constituents are concerned about the impact of the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) proposed re-definition of "waters of the United States." As a farmer, I share their concerns.
That is why I questioned EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy in a joint committee hearing with the Senate about this very issue.
Although the EPA claims the new rules are based on science, the vague rules lack numbers and units.
Furthermore, the EPA Administrator testified that the new rules would save money, but then went on to say the rules would cost our economy an additional $100 to $200 million. That sounds like Washington, D.C. doublespeak to me.
Watch my line of questioning in the
video
below and decide for yourself.
Congressman Massie questions the EPA Administrator about the new proposed definition of "waters of the United States" in a joint committee hearing with the Senate.
Last year, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the bipartisan Waters of the United States Regulatory Overreach Protection Act of 2014 (H.R. 5078), 262-152, but the Senate did not vote on the bill. I supported the legislation, which prohibits the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers from implementing the proposed rule. The bill also requires that before the EPA would be able to implement any new rule, it would first have to consult with state and local officials.
In Liberty,
Congressman Thomas Massie
