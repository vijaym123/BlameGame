Dear Friend,
As your
Member of Congress, my focus has always been and will always be ensuring
that every American, regardless of their race, gender, religious
beliefs, sexual orientation or socio-economic status, has a fair shot at
making it in this
country.
Unfortunately, Republicans continue to ignore legislation in Congress that
would safeguard this essential element of the American Dream.
Instead, they have chosen to double-down on political stunts and partisan
gridlock.
Meanwhile, the American middle class remains on the
losing end.
Democrats in Congress,
however, have proposed a legislative initiative
called the Middle
Class Jumpstart
that addresses the challenges facing the middle
class with a three-prong
strategy:
Providing
tax incentives for creating good-paying jobs here at home, as well as
authorizing the repair and modernization of Americas roads, rails,
bridges and broadband
technology
Guaranteeing both women and men get equal pay for equal work, as well as
strengthening the Violence Against Women Act and expanding access to
comprehensive health care and family
planning
Making college more affordable and allow students to
refinance their college loans to new, lower rates, as well as increasing
access to effective early childhood
learning
I remain committed to passing these bills and revitalizing
our middle class to ensure our nation remains prosperous and rich
with opportunity for all Americans.
Which part of "the Middle Class Jumpstart" initiative do you support the
most? Providing tax
incentives to keep jobs in the United States Repairing and modernizing America's roads, rails,
