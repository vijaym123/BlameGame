Walberg Comments on Ebola and Visits New Health Facility in Adrian
Rep. Walberg on Ebola:
Recent health and safety related incidents in the US surrounding the Ebola crisis have made it beyond clear the Administrations current procedures are not working. Not only do we need to reassess our prevention and response systems and give approval of effectively used drugs, but a temporary travel ban is needed on travel to the US from countries severely impacted by the virus.
My thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families during this time.
