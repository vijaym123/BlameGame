Rep Renacci Weekly Column: A Year In Review
It is a great honor to represent Ohio's 16th district in Congress, and
I thank you for allowing me the opportunity to serve you. Though we
have much work ahead, I wanted to take this opportunity to highlight my
work on behalf of Ohioans this past year.
I take my position very seriously, and I know that it is critical that
we are as accessible and responsive to you as possible. In January, we
opened our office in Wadsworth in order to make our location more
convenient for our constituents. Whether you need help with a federal
agency or are planning a trip to Washington, our office can help. You
may find more information about how we can assist you on our website or
by calling our Wadsworth office. Read more HERE
