Friend,
Did you see Ami&#39;s email
on Thursday ? It&#39;s true - yet another outside group has stepped into our race. As soon as Karl Rove&#39;s ads stopped running, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce jumped in with negative attack ads of their own.
Now, they&#39;ve upped their ad buy to over $300,000.
We have to fight back immediately. Click here and give $5 or more.
As of now, we have $5,345 left to go to hit our goal.
Ami told you that we need to hit
$10,000 by
next Tuesday
- now let us tell you why. Running television ads costs money - and the ads that have been running against us, funded by outside interests with extremely deep pockets,
CANNOT
go unanswered. We don&#39;t have outside funders running ads for us like our opponent does - we&#39;re relying on you.
C lick here and give whatever you can right now. Only with your help will we be able to respond to these attacks.
Thanks. Talk soon.
Best,
Team Bera
PS - This $10,000 goal isn&#39;t arbitrary. We face a hard budgeting deadline on Tuesday, and it&#39;s what we need to keep our ad running to beat back the lies. We need your immediate help. Click here and give $5 or $10 now.
