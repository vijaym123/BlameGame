Rokita Readings
A clickable offering of books and articles that I've read recently and
highly recommend, as we strive together to "Keep the Republic."
Featured in this week's Rokita Readings is an article I read by Terry
Miller titled "America's Dwindling Economic Freedom
."
For the first time since the Heritage Foundation and Wall Street
Journal began measuring the economic freedom of countries, the United
States has dropped out of the Top 10.
At number 12, the United States is placed between Estonia and Bahrain
in the "mostly free" category.
Although we have been slipping for
quite some time, (see prior Rokita Readings
for the reasons why) there has been a recent
increase in this decline.
The reason is the President's failed
economic and regulatory policies.
The President and his administration
continue "to shackle entire sectors of the economy with regulations
including health care, finance and energy.
The intervention impedes
both personal freedom and national prosperity."
This study demonstrates the tangible consequences of excessive
regulation - the loss of our freedom.
To stop excessive regulations, I created the Red Tape Rollback
program.
Through this
program we have secured victories against burdensome regulations and I
have had the privilege to share these victories with you in past Rokita
Reports.
Many of the countries making great strides are those that suffered
under communism in Eastern Europe, or those like Denmark and Canada
that have experimented with socialism and seen the disastrous results.
As these countries recognize the errors of excessive government, I will
continue to stand up to the President and his partners who want to
drive our country over the same cliff at high speed.

Education and Workforce Committee Hearings
This week, the Education and Workforce Committee held two hearings that
I participated in.
On Wednesday, the full committee held a hearing on "Raising the Bar:
The Role of Charter Schools in K-12 Education
."
On
Thursday, the Workforce Protections Committee held a hearing on "H.R.
3633, the Protecting Health Care Providers from Increased
Administrative Burdens Act
."
Video
from both of these hearings can be found on my YouTube
page and in the Recent Videos section of this
Rokita Report.
Raising the Bar: The Role of Charter Schools in K-12 Education
As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and
Secondary Education, I have heard about the success stories of charter
schools.
Charter schools receive public funding but are able to
operate independently, without the intrusion of many bureaucrats and
teachers' union leaders.
Many charter schools are producing better results than other schools,
even though they receive 80 percent of the funding that those schools
receive.
H.R. 3633, the Protecting Health Care Providers from Increased
Administrative Burdens Act
The Workforce Protections Subcommittee held a hearing on "H.R. 3633,
the Protecting Health Care Providers from Increased Administrative
Burdens Act.
"
This
legislation would prevent the Department of Labor from continuing its
unprecedented attempts to exert jurisdiction over health care providers.
This hearing and the question of whether or not health care providers
can be considered federal contractors if they work for a program
receiving federal funds have a heightened importance given President
Obama's recent executive orders adding further rules and requirements
on federal contractors.

Protecting Volunteer Firefighters from ObamaCare
This week, the House passed H.R. 3979, the Protecting Volunteer
Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act of 2014 by unanimous vote.
H.R. 3979 protects volunteer firefighters and emergency responders by
ensuring certain emergency services volunteers are not counted when
determining the number of full-time employees for the purposes of the
employer mandate in ObamaCare.
Volunteer firefighters and emergency responders are part of our
American Exceptionalism.
The communities throughout Indiana, and our
nation, who depend on volunteer fire departments and emergency services
every day should not suffer due to ObamaCare's employer mandate that
would prevent the many volunteers from continuing to provide lifesaving
services.
The need for this legislation is another indication that
ObamaCare is an ill-advised and poorly conceived plan, and it should be
repealed in its entirety and replaced with free market reforms to lower
costs, improve access to health insurance, and give consumers more
choices.
_____
The ENFORCE the Laws Act
On Tuesday, I joined my colleagues in the House of Representatives in
standing up to President Obama and passing H.R. 4138, the ENFORCE the
Laws Act.
This legislation would give Congress greater power to ensure
that the President is enforcing existing laws.
President Obama routinely disregards the law by picking and choosing
what parts of laws to enforce and what parts not to enforce.
ObamaCare
is a great example.
According to the Galen Institute
, the President has
chosen to unilaterally delay portions of ObamaCare 37 times.
The
Constitution is very clear that the President is to implement the law,
not pick and choose what laws, or what portions of laws, he will
enforce.
We live in a nation of laws, not a nation of men.
To that
end, this legislation provides Congress with another tool to hold the
executive branch accountable for clear cut cases of ignoring the law.
_____
Permanently Repealing the Sustainable Growth Rate
On Friday, March 14th I voted in favor of H.R. 4015, legislation which
provides a permanent repeal to the Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate
(SGR).
I supported this legislation because our doctors are the
necessary ingredient in maintaining a quality health care system and
the looming 24 percent cut to doctors' reimbursement rates is
unacceptable.
By passing H.R. 4015, the House preserves seniors'
access to health care services and protects doctors so they can
continue to treat patients who use the publicly assisted health care
system called Medicare.
This bill permanently repeals the SGR and implements a 0.5 percent
payment increase each year for the next five years while an alternative
formula is developed to pay Medicare physicians.
To prevent expanding
the federal deficit and adding to our $17 trillion national debt, this
legislation is fully paid for by delaying the implementation of
ObamaCare's individual mandate tax through 2019.

Featured
in
this
week's
Rokita
Readings
is
an
article
I
read
by
Terry
Miller
titled
" America's
Dwindling
Economic
Freedom ."
For
the
first
time
since
the
Heritage
Foundation
and
Wall
Street
Journal
began
measuring
the
economic
freedom
of
countries,
the
United
States
has
dropped
out
of
the
Top
10 .
At
number
12,
the
United
States
is
placed
between
Estonia
and
Bahrain
in
the
"mostly
free"
category.
Although
we
have
been
slipping
for
quite
some
time,
(see
prior
Rokita
Readings
for
the
reasons
why)
there
has
been
a
recent
increase
in
this
decline.
The
reason
is
the
President's
failed
economic
and
regulatory
policies.
The
President
and
his
administration
continue
"to
shackle
entire
sectors
of
the
economy
with
regulations
including
health
care,
finance
and
energy.
The
intervention
impedes
both
personal
freedom
and
national
prosperity."
This
study
demonstrates
the
tangible
consequences
of
excessive
regulation
- the
loss
of
our
freedom.
To
stop
excessive
regulations,
I created
the
Red
Tape
Rollback
program.
Through
this
program
we
have
secured victories
against
burdensome
regulations
and
I
have
had
the
privilege
to
share
these
victories
with
you
in
past
Rokita

Many
of
the countries
making
great
strides are
those
that
suffered
under
communism
in
Eastern
Europe,
or those
like
Denmark
and
Canada
that have
experimented
with
socialism
and
seen
the
disastrous
results.
As
these
countries
recognize
the
errors
of
excessive
government,
I
will
continue
to
stand
up
to
the
President
and
his
partners
who
want
to

our
country
over
the

cliff
at

Education
and
Workforce
Committee
Hearings
This
week,
the
Education
and
Workforce
Committee
held
two
hearings
that
I
participated
in.
On
Wednesday,
the
full
committee
held
a
hearing
on
" Raising
the
Bar:
The
Role
of
Charter
Schools
in
K-12
Education ."
On
Thursday,
the
Workforce
Protections
Committee
held
a
hearing
on
" H.R.
3633,
the
Protecting
Health
Care
Providers
from
Increased
Administrative
Burdens
Act ."
Video
from
both

these
hearings
can

YouTube

and
in
the Recent
Videos section of
this
Rokita
Report.
Raising
the
Bar:
The
Role
of
Charter
Schools
in
K-12
Education
As
Chairman
of
the
Subcommittee
on
Early
Childhood,
Elementary,
and
Secondary
Education,
I
have
heard
about
the
success
stories
of
charter
schools.
Charter
schools
receive
public
funding
but
are
able
to
operate
independently,
without
the
intrusion
of
many
bureaucrats
and
teachers'
union
leaders.
Many
charter
schools are
producing
better results
than
other
schools,
even
though
they
receive
80
percent of
the
funding
that
those
schools
receive.
H.R.
3633,
the
Protecting
Health
Care

The
Workforce
Protections
Subcommittee
held
a
hearing
on
" H.R.
3633,
the
Protecting
Health
Care
Providers
from
Increased
Administrative
Burdens
Act. "
This
legislation
would
prevent
the
Department
of
Labor
from
continuing
its
unprecedented
attempts
to
exert
jurisdiction
over
health
care
providers.
This
hearing
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
health
care
providers
can
be
considered
federal
contractors
if
they
work
for
a
program
receiving
federal
funds
have
a
heightened
importance
given
President
Obama's
recent
executive
orders
adding
further
rules
and
requirements
on
federal
contractors.

House
passed H.R.
3979,
the

H.R.

volunteers
are
not

Volunteer

The

who

On

of
H.R.
4015,
legislation which
provides
a
permanent

to
