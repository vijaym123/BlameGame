The Koch Brothers want you to think they can't be beat. Do not be fooled.
It&rsquo;s true that right-wing Koch-funded groups are viciously attacking Democrats across the country. But as Margaret Mead famously put it,
"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.&rdquo;
David -- I truly believe that.
We will win this fight against petro-chemical billionaires and corporate special interests. We just need to get the ball rolling in the right direction. And that starts right now.
The midterm elections are only 11 days away -- and right now, there are Democrats facing Koch-funded attacks who could use our help. Whether it&rsquo;s $5 or $50, every little bit helps. Can you chip in today -- while your donation can make the difference?
