Hagel Defense Plan Will Go Under Microscope
Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel this week unveiled the Administration's
ideas for defense spending for the coming fiscal year - a plan that
will placed under the microscope at the Defense Appropriations
Subcommittee before anything is set in stone.
Here's my bottom line defense philosophy: Congress must have an
unwavering commitment to national security.
Defense decisions must be
based on strategic needs, NOT on how many dollars the Administration
thinks should be cut to fund its own priorities. To approach our
national security any other way is foolish: We live in dangerous times
and fewer forces only mean higher risk.
Secretary Hagel's plan does not put the importance of Naval Station
Mayport and Naval Air Station Jacksonville in danger, but I would say
that it places our overall national security at risk.
Regarding ship placement at Mayport, the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) is
a key part of the Navy's future, and its ability to handle
multi-purpose missions makes it an important part of the Navy fleet. We
can't afford one ship that can do it all. Numbers matter, and we need
ships that can meet the Navy's diverse needs. The LCS does that and
makes common and strategic sense.
I'll be fighting to make that case
from my seat on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.
Regarding proposed National Guard cuts, I am well aware of the
importance of Florida National Guard to both the Guard's mission in our
state and around the globe, and that budget will be closely reviewed as
well.
In the end, the Defense Subcommittee will write a defense
appropriations bill for fiscal year 2015. I think I can confidently
predict it will not be a direct reflection of Defense Secretary Hagel's
initial request.
Holding the IRS Accountable
No time of the year turns a focus on how much hard-earned money
Americans are sending to Washington more than tax season.
As
individuals, families, and businesses calculate how much money they are
sending to the IRS, Congress must do its part to make sure this agency
is effectively using taxpayer dollars.
That's why, as Chairman of the Financial Services and General
Government Appropriations Subcommittee, I called an Internal Revenue
Service oversight hearing on Wednesday. There, I questioned IRS
Commissioner John Koskinen about how we can further protect Americans
from the abuse we have seen in the past year. Singling out taxpayers
based on political belief and spending millions of dollars on lavish
conferences. Neither has a place in our society in this day and age.
Following a series of 2013 subcommittee hearings, recommendations were
made to correct this behavior, but Congress can and should do more.
This week, I also voted for common-sense legislation that will provide
citizens with the security, transparency, and accountability they
deserve. The following pieces of legislation passed the House with my
support.
Taxpayers Right to Know Act (H.R. 1423): Requires the federal
government to provide taxpayers with an annual report disclosing the
cost and performance of government programs with a goal of reducing
areas of duplication.
Taxpayer Transparency and Efficient Audit Act (H.R. 2530): Requires
the IRS to disclose to taxpayers when it has shared tax information
with another government agency. The measure also limits audits to a
one-year time period.
Protecting Taxpayers from Intrusive IRS Requests Act (H.R. 2531):
Prevents the IRS from inquiring about an individual's religious,
political, or social beliefs.
Any change to the policy would require
Congressional approval.
Taxpayer Transparency Act of 2014 (H.R. 3308
as amended): Requires
that Executive Branch agencies disclose that advertisements are paid
for at taxpayer expense in mediums including printed mailers,
brochures, television and radio advertisements, billboards, and e-mail.
Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act of 2014 (H.R.
3865): Prevents the ability of the IRS and the Department of Treasury
from legalizing the targeting of conservative groups. Specifically, the
bill puts a hold on a proposed IRS rules change restricting the
operations of
501(c)(4) organizations until the House Ways and Means
Committee completes its investigation of IRS targeting based on
political belief.
Stressing the importance that IRS must protect taxpayer rights with IRS
Commissioner John Koskinen at Wednesday hearing.
Thanks, NDSS! Together We'll Pass the ABLE Act
Great to see representatives from the Down Syndrome Association of
Jacksonville on Capitol Hill at the National Down Syndrome Society
(NDSS) Awards ceremony. At the event, Jacksonville Association Director
Debbie Revels presented me with a 2014 NDSS Champion of Change Award
for my work to advance the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act
(ABLE Act) - legislation to create tax-free savings accounts for
individuals with disabilities.
What an honor, but its people like Debbie, the folks at her
organization, the National Down Syndrome Society, and disability
advocacy groups around the country who deserve to take a bow.
They know that individuals with disabilities should have access to the
same financial planning tools as other Americans. And, they fanned out
across Capitol Hill during Buddy Walk 2014 to encourage more Members of
Congress to co-sponsor ABLE and pass the legislation. Great work
everyone. Working together, we'll pass ABLE!

Revels and NDSS Board Member Steve Beck at Thursday award ceremony.

Hagel
Defense
Plan
Will
Go
Under
Microscope
Secretary
of
Defense
Chuck
Hagel
this
week
unveiled
the
Administration&#8217;s
ideas
for
defense
spending
for
the
coming
fiscal
year
&#8211;
a
plan
that
will
placed
under
the
microscope
at
the
Defense
Appropriations
Subcommittee
before
anything
is
set
in
stone.
Here&#8217;s
my
bottom
line
defense
philosophy:
Congress
must
have
an
unwavering
commitment
to
national
security.
Defense
decisions
must
be
based
on
strategic
needs,
NOT
on
how
many
dollars
the
Administration
thinks
should
be
cut
to
fund
its
own
priorities.
To
approach
our
national
security
any
other
way
is
foolish:
We
live
in
dangerous
times
and
fewer
forces
only
mean
higher
risk.
Secretary
Hagel&#8217;s
plan
does
not
put
the
importance
of
Naval
Station
Mayport
and
Naval
Air
Station
Jacksonville
in
danger,
but
I
would
say
that
it
places
our
overall
national
security
at
risk.
Regarding
ship
placement
at
Mayport,
the
Littoral
Combat
Ship
(LCS)
is
a
key
part
of
the
Navy&#8217;s
future,
and
its
ability
to
handle
multi-purpose
missions
makes
it
an
important
part
of
the
Navy
fleet.
We
can&#8217;t
afford
one
ship
that
can
do
it
all.
Numbers
matter,
and
we
need
ships
that
can
meet
the
Navy&#8217;s
diverse
needs.
The
LCS
does
that
and
makes
common
and
strategic
sense.
I&#8217;ll
be
fighting
to
make
that
case
from
my
seat
on
the
Defense
Appropriations
Subcommittee.
Regarding
proposed
National
Guard
cuts,
I
am
well
aware
of
the
importance
of
Florida
National
Guard
to
both
the
Guard&#8217;s
mission
in
our
state
and
around
the
globe,
and
that
budget
will
be
closely
reviewed
as
well.
In
the
end,
the
Defense
Subcommittee
will
write
a
defense
appropriations
bill
for
fiscal
year
2015.
I
think
I
can
confidently
predict
it
will
not
be
a
direct
reflection
of
Defense
Secretary
Hagel&#8217;s
initial
request.
Holding
the
IRS
Accountable
No
time
of
the
year
turns
a
focus
on
how
much
hard-earned
money
Americans
are
sending
to
Washington
more
than
tax
season.
As
individuals,
families,
and
businesses
calculate
how
much
money
they
are
sending
to
the
IRS,
Congress
must
do
its
part
to
make
sure
this
agency
is
effectively
using
taxpayer
dollars.
That&#8217;s
why,
as
Chairman
of
the
Financial
Services
and
General
Government
Appropriations
Subcommittee,
I
called
an
Internal
Revenue
Service
oversight
hearing
on
Wednesday.
There,
I
questioned
IRS
Commissioner
John
Koskinen
about
how
we
can
further
protect
Americans
from
the
abuse
we
have
seen
in
the
past
year.
Singling
out
taxpayers
based
on
political
belief
and
spending
millions
of
dollars
on
lavish
conferences.
Neither
has
a
place
in
our
society
in
this
day
and
age.
Following
a
series
of
2013
subcommittee
hearings,
recommendations
were
made
to
correct
this
behavior,
but
Congress
can
and
should
do
more.
This
week,
I
also
voted
for
common-sense
legislation
that
will
provide
citizens
with
the
security,
transparency,
and
accountability
they
deserve.
The
following
pieces
of
legislation
passed
the
House
with
my
support.
&#8226;
Taxpayers
Right

(H.R.
1423):

the
federal

The
measure
also
limits
audits
to
a
one-year
time
period. &#8226;
Protecting

(H.R.

Prevents
the

religious,
political,

Any
change
to
the
policy
would
require
Congressional
approval. &#8226; Taxpayer
Transparency
Act

(H.R.

Requires

Executive
Branch
agencies
disclose
that

are
paid
for
at
taxpayer
expense
in
mediums
including
printed
mailers,
brochures,
television

radio
advertisements,

and
e-mail.
&#8226;
Stop
