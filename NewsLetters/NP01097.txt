Dear
F riends,
Just a reminder, I&#8217;m hosting three town hall meetings throughout the Fourth Congressional District this week &#8211; &shy;May 5-7 and a small business forum on Friday, May 8. It&#8217;s a busy week, and I want to hear from you. While district and national
issues will be front and center, I especially want to hear what&#8217;s on people&#8217;s minds and give constituents the opportunity to express their thoughts and concerns.
