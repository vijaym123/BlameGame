On Jan. 1, 2014, millions
of Americans and thousands of
Delawareans will have access
to affordable health
insurance. Will you be one of
them?
The deadline to sign up
for insurance
has been extended to Dec.
23, 2013,
for coverage
beginning on Jan. 1, 2014. If
you havent already,
the time is now to review
options and determine what
plans work best for you and
your family. In Delaware,
visit
www.choosehealthde.com
for more information on
available health insurance
plans and to enroll.
Right here at home,
folks are signing up for
high-quality health insurance
every day, many for the first
time in their
lives. This
month, I joined hundreds of
thousands of Americans and
many of my staff in enrolling
in health insurance on the
health insurance
marketplace.
Make sure you don't miss
this important deadline and
be left without coverage in
2014!
Stay well,
