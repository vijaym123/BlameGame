Dear Friend,
This was an in-district work week for Members of the U.S. House
- an
opportunity for representatives of the people to spend time visiting
citizens in their districts. I want to share a couple of my visits in
Missouri's Fourth District this week.
I was invited to visit the Caterpillar High Performance Molded Products
plant in Boonville and met with several of the good people who work
there. The facility, which opened its doors in March of 1992, provides
employment for citizens of Cooper County, employing more than 200
people. The skilled workers at this Caterpillar plant produce multiple
product lines consisting of power transmission, suspension, vibration
isolation, and sealing application components. Caterpillar is
environmentally conscious, as well. The company is one of the world's
largest remanufacturers with its facilities recycling 97-99 percent of
material that comes through the door.
Congresswoman Hartzler with Caterpillar Facility Manager Steve Peters
America's manufacturing industry is crucial to kick-starting our
economy. I am committed to helping companies like Caterpillar to cut
through the burdensome government red tape that stifles businesses and
to help reduce government obstacles that stand in the way of
manufacturers and small businesses expanding their markets. The simple
truth is that by opening new markets for American-made goods we help
lower prices for consumers and create higher-paying jobs for American
workers. This begins with addressing job-destroying government
overregulation.
I also visited Central Methodist University in Fayette to meet CMU
President Dr. Roger Drake, who became the 26th President of Central
Methodist in July of this year.

Dr. Drake is committed to providing each CMU student with a quality
learning experience. With Dr. Drake's academic and business experience,
I am confident Central Methodist and its faculty, staff, and students
will be well served for years to come.
Other education-related stops this week included a visit to Columbia
College, where I met with Interim President Dr. Terry B. Smith to tour
a new science facility, and a visit to Boonslick Technical Education
Center in Boonville.
My travels also took me to the Howard County Electric Co-Op in Fayette,
where I heard first hand of some of the concerns of electric
cooperatives in our district and in our state. Federal government
regulations are creating onerous burdens for these companies. The
people at the Howard County Electric Co-Op want to continue providing
electricity to the citizens they serve and are hoping they will be
allowed to do so without counter-productive federal government
overregulation.
On a related note, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) held an
important listening post in Lenexa, Kansas, to hear input from citizens
of EPA Region 7 - which includes Missouri - on the EPA's proposed rule
on source performance standards for new power plants.
While I was unable to attend this meeting, I submitted a statement
outlining my concerns regarding what I see as a government overreach
that will cripple the coal industry and will lead to higher energy
costs for hard-working citizens and businesses in Missouri's Fourth
Congressional District. As I stated in my comments to the EPA, the
proposed rule would create a de facto ban on building any new coal
fired power plants in the U.S. by requiring the use of Carbon Capture
and Storage technology. This technology has not been commercially
proven in any state, and the small pilot projects that have taken place
are in states and parts of the world with drastically different
geological formations than the state of Missouri. The EPA must set
realistic expectations and standards that can be met by states in a way
that is not economically damaging to local ratepayers and small
businesses.
The fact is that Missouri derives more than 80 percent of its energy
from coal. With this in mind, I would encourage the EPA to work with
utilities to provide standards based on realistic expectations and
provide states with a great amount of flexibility when meeting EPA
standards. It is wrong for a federal government agency to force its
unrealistic standards and added costs on the people the agency is
supposed to serve. I will continue to fight for citizens of Missouri's
Fourth District against what amounts to an unreasonable government
attack on an industry that affords our district with affordable energy
to keep people warm in the winter and cool in the summer months.
Have a great week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler
Member of Congress

Dear

This

U.S.
House
&#8211;
an

I
want

this

With

experience,
I
am
confident
Central
Methodist
and
its

staff,
and
students
will
be
well
served
for
years
to
come.
Other
education-related
stops
this
week
included
a
visit
to
Columbia
College,
where
I
met
with
Interim
President
Dr.
Terry
B.
Smith
to
tour
a
new
science
facility,
and
a
visit
to
Boonslick
Technical
Education
Center
in
Boonville.
My
travels
also
took
me
to
the
Howard
County
Electric
Co-Op
in
Fayette,
where
I
heard
first
hand
of
some
of
the
concerns
of
electric
cooperatives
in
our
district
and
in
our
state.
Federal
government
regulations
are
creating
onerous
burdens
for
these
companies.
The
people
at
the
Howard
County
Electric
Co-Op
want
to
continue
providing
electricity
to
the
citizens
they
serve
and
are
hoping
they
will
be
allowed
to
do
so
without
counter-productive
federal
government
overregulation.
On
a
related
note,
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(EPA)
held
an
important
listening
post
in
Lenexa,
Kansas,
to
hear
input
from
citizens
of
EPA
Region
7
&#8211;
which
includes
Missouri
&#8211;
on
the
EPA&#8217;s
proposed
rule
on
source
performance
standards
for
new
power
plants.
While
I
was
unable
to
attend
this
meeting,
I
submitted
a
statement
outlining
my
concerns
regarding
what
I
see
as
a
government
overreach
that
will
cripple
the
coal
industry
and
will
lead
to
higher
energy
costs
for
hard-working
citizens
and
businesses
in
Missouri&#8217;s
Fourth
Congressional
District.
As
I
stated
in
my
comments
to
the
EPA,
the
proposed
rule
would
create
a
de
facto
ban
on
building
any
new
coal
fired
power
plants
in
the
U.S.
by
requiring
the
use
of
Carbon

and
Storage
technology.
This
technology
has
not
been
commercially
proven
in
any
state,
and
the
small
pilot
projects
that
have
taken
place
are
in
states
and
parts
of
the
world
with
drastically
different
geological
formations
than
the
state
of
Missouri.
The
EPA
must
set
realistic
expectations
and
standards
that
can
be
met
by
states
in
a
way
that
is
not
economically
damaging
to
local
ratepayers
and
small

The
fact
is
that
Missouri
derives
more
than
80
percent
of
its
energy
from
coal.
With
this
in
mind,
I
would
encourage
the
EPA
to
work
with
utilities
to
provide
standards
based
on
realistic
expectations
and
provide
states
with
a
great
amount
of
flexibility
when
meeting
EPA
standards.
It
is
wrong
for
a
federal
government
agency
to
force
its
unrealistic
standards
and
added
costs
on
the
people
the
agency
is
supposed
to
serve.
I
will
continue
to
fight
for
citizens
of
Missouri&#8217;s
Fourth
District
against
what
amounts
to
an
unreasonable
government
attack
on
an
industry
that
affords
our
district
with
affordable
energy
to
keep
people
warm

Have
a
