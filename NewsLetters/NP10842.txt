Dear Friend,
One of my top priorities is eliminating waste, fraud and abuse whenever
I can find it. My efforts are paying off!
My legislative request to ban life-size pictures printed on scrims that
conceal scaffolding successfully cleared a House subcommittee Thursday
and was included in the Fiscal Year 2015 Appropriations Bill. These
pictures cost thousands of taxpayer dollars and serve no legitimate
purpose. The Architect of the Capitol justified this lavish practice by
asserting that it is 'used extensively in Europe.' This is America and
we should not be wasting taxpayer money in this manner. Click HERE

Repairing Our Sacred Trust Relationship
On Thursday, I introduced a bill called the American Indian Trust
Responsibility Review Act. This bipartisan legislation will, for the
first time since the 1970s, provide a comprehensive overview of and
help us improve the unique trust relationship between the United States
and American Indian tribes. Over the years, this trust relationship has
eroded. The comprehensive review established by my legislation will
help us start to repair this sacred relationship. Click HERE

Fighting for Rural Arizona
On Friday, I led two legislative efforts to bring vital resources to
rural Arizona communities through the Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT)
program and the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP).
The PILT program was established to offset local governments' loss of
property and sales tax revenue due to the fact that federally owned
lands cannot be taxed. This program's resources are used by local
governments to fund vital programs like police and fire services, road
construction and maintenance, and construction of public schools. SCAAP
is a grant program that reimburses states and local governments for the
cost of incarcerating undocumented immigrants convicted of crimes.
The federal government needs to either give us our land or give us our
PILT. Since it frequently falls on our local governments to provide
safety operations on federal lands, they should be reimbursed for
performing this critical work. Likewise, if our local governments are
incarcerating illegal immigrants convicted of crimes, the federal
government should offset the cost.
Save the 40-Hour Work Week!
I also voted on Thursday in favor of the Save American Workers Act,
which passed the House by a bipartisan vote of 248 to 179. It falls on
Congress to protect the American people from the disastrous effects of
ObamaCare. One of its tragic consequences is the demise of the
traditional 40-hour work week. ObamaCare's 30-hour rule is forcing
single mothers, recent college graduates and low income families to
pick up second jobs just to make ends meet.
All this bill does is change the definition of a full-time work week
back to 40 hours. It provides middle class families with greater
financial security, allows hardworking Americans to keep more of their
money and prevents them from being forced to take on another job just
to make the equivalent amount that they made under a 40-hour work week.

Not on Your Dime
On Wednesday, I appeared on Fox Business's Varney & Co. to discuss my
legislative effort to stop members of Congress from flying first class
on the taxpayer dime. Click HERE

Conservative, and Proud of It
I was proud to receive the American Conservative Union's Conservative
Award for 2013 on Thursday. This award is given to members of Congress
who scored 80 percent or higher on issues important to grassroots
conservatives.
(Rep. Gosar is presented his award by Carly Fiorina and Al Cardenas,
Chairman of the American Conservative Union, April 3, 2014)
Honoring World War II Vets
I had the privilege of speaking to World War II veterans at the annual
Honor Flight Arizona dinner in Washington, D.C on Wednesday night. I
told them that after all of the missions they undertook and all of the
sacrifices they made in the name of freedom and liberty, they have one
last duty to fulfill. That duty is to ensure that the stories of their
heroism and commitment to this nation are not lost on future
generations. I urged them to pass along their stories to their children
and grandchildren.
(Rep. Gosar speaking with World War II Vets, April 2, 2014)
Protecting Our Economy from Political Ploys
The Shutdown Windfall Reimbursement Act, of which I'm an original
co-sponsor, was introduced on Tuesday. This legislation is a
no-brainer. It simply reimburses states for the expenses they incurred
during President Obama's government shutdown last October.
After the Administration, in an attempt to score cheap political
points, closed National Parks across the country, I worked with Mayor
Bryan of Tusayan and Governor Brewer to get the Park Service out of the
way and let the state step in to open and operate Grand Canyon National
Park and others across Arizona. States like Arizona that had to reopen
the parks on their own accord should absolutely be reimbursed for doing
the federal government's job.
Although Congress has provided the funds to reimburse the states, the
Park Service has failed to do so and is holding on to roughly $2
million that belongs to the states. I have urged my colleagues to
swiftly pass this legislation, so that states can finally be reimbursed
for doing the job the federal government should have done in the first
place. Click HERE

Helping Downwinders
On Monday, April 14, I will hold a field hearing in Kingman that will
focus on the "downwinders" of Mohave County. As you may know,
downwinders are people who developed cancer due to radiation exposure
from U.S. nuclear weapons testing in the 1950s and 1960s. We will
discuss the history of nuclear weapons testing in Nevada and the bill
that I introduced to make all affected residents of Mohave County
eligible for benefits. Currently, only the part of Mohave County north
of the Grand Canyon is eligible. You can find the details of the
hearing in the "Mark Your Calendar" section below or by clicking HERE

hearing in the Kingman Daily Miner by clicking HERE

Repairing
Our
Sacred
Trust
Relationship
On
Thursday,
I
introduced
a
bill
called
the
American
Indian
Trust
Responsibility
Review
Act.
This
bipartisan legislation
will,
for
the
first
time
since
the
1970s,
provide
a
comprehensive
overview
of
and
help
us
improve
the
unique
trust
relationship
between
the
United
States
and
American
Indian
tribes.
Over
the
years,
this
trust
relationship
has
eroded.
The
comprehensive
review
established
by
my
legislation
will
help
us
start
to
repair
this
sacred
relationship.

Fighting
for
Rural
Arizona
On
Friday,
I
led
two
legislative
efforts
to
bring
vital
resources
to
rural
Arizona
communities
through the
Payments
in
Lieu
of
Taxes
(PILT)
program and
the
State
Criminal
Alien
Assistance
Program
(SCAAP).
The
PILT
program
was
established
to offset local
governments' loss
of
property
and
sales tax
revenue
due
to
the
fact
that
federally
owned
lands
cannot
be
taxed. This
program's
resources
are
used
by
local
governments
to
fund
vital
programs
like police
and
fire
services,
road
construction
and
maintenance,
and
construction
of
public
schools.
SCAAP
is
a
grant
program
that
reimburses
states
and
local
governments
for
the
cost
of
incarcerating
undocumented
immigrants
convicted
of
crimes.
The
federal
government
needs
to
either
give
us
our
land
or
give
us
our
PILT.
Since
it
frequently
falls
on
our
local
governments
to
provide
safety
operations
on
federal
lands,
they
should
be reimbursed
for performing
this
critical
work.
Likewise,
if
our
local
governments
are
incarcerating
illegal
immigrants
convicted
of
crimes,
the
federal
government
should
offset
the
cost.
Save
the
40-Hour
Work
Week!
I
also voted
on
Thursday
in
favor
of
the
Save
American
Workers
Act,
which
passed
the
House
by
a
bipartisan
vote
of
248
to
179.
It
falls
on
Congress
to
protect
the
American
people
from
the
disastrous
effects
of
ObamaCare.
One
of
its
tragic
consequences
is
the
demise
of
the
traditional
40-hour
work
week.
ObamaCare's
30-hour
rule
is
forcing
single
mothers,
recent
college
graduates
and
low
income
families
to
pick
up
second
jobs
just
to
make
ends
meet.
All this
bill does
is
change
the
definition
of
a
full-time
work
week
back
to
40
hours.
It
provides
middle
class
families
with
greater
financial
security,
allows
hardworking
Americans
to
keep
more
of
their
money
and
prevents
them
from
being
forced
to
take
on

Protecting

Economy
from
Political
Ploys
The
Shutdown
Windfall
Reimbursement
Act,
of
which
I'm
an
original
co-sponsor,
was
introduced
on
Tuesday.
This
legislation
is
a
no-brainer.
It
simply
reimburses
states
for
the
expenses
they
incurred
during
President
Obama's
government
shutdown
last
October.
After
the
Administration,
in
an
attempt
to
score
cheap
political
points,
closed
National
Parks
across
the
country,
I
worked
with
Mayor
Bryan
of
Tusayan
and
Governor
Brewer
to
get
the
Park
Service
out
of
the
way
and
let
the
state
step
in
to
open
and
operate
Grand
Canyon
National
Park
and
others
across
Arizona.
States
like
Arizona
that
had
to
reopen
the
parks
on
their
own
accord
should
absolutely
be
reimbursed
for
doing
the
federal
government's
job.
Although
Congress
has
provided
the
funds
to
reimburse
the
states,
the
Park
Service
has
failed
to
do
so
and
is
holding
on
to
roughly
$2
million
that
belongs
to
the
states.
I
have
urged
my
colleagues
to
swiftly
pass
this
legislation,
so
that
states
can
finally
be
reimbursed
for
doing
the
job
the
federal
government
should
have
done
in
the

place.
