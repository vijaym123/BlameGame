Update from Senator Bob Corker

No Sacrifice for Iran in Interim
Deal
During a Senate Banking Committee hearing on negotiations over Irans
nuclear program, Senator Corker, ranking member of the Foreign Relations
Committee, said the interim agreement requires no sacrifice of Iran
and that the sanctions relief being offered by the U.S. risks creating
a rush to do business with Iran.

Once you begin
loosening sanctions, and people begin to see that Iran is now going to become
not a rogue country but part of the international communitythere is a
rushto do business with them. And I think thats why were all
concerned that we did an interim deal that has no sacrifice on their part
whatsoever, said Corker. Obviously, were disappointed but hopeful
that somehow you can put the genie back in the bottle and end up with
some type of agreement that averts warfare. Because of all of us do want
this to succeed. We just dont know how we get there with an interim
deal framed in this way.
On November 21, Corker introduced
legislation, the Iran Nuclear Compliance Act of 2013, to keep the
pressure on Iran during the negotiations and prevent an interim agreement
from becoming the final deal. The bill requires Iran to fully comply
with any interim deal and meet the basic conditions for an acceptable
final agreement before the president of the United States could waive
additional sanctions. It further requires an immediate snapback of all
sanctions after confirmation of Irans noncompliance at any point or
if an acceptable final deal isnt reached within six
months.
Key provisions of the legislation are available
here . Full text of the bill and an additional summary are available
