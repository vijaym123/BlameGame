Yesterday, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio), along with Senator Jeanne
Shaheen (D-N.H.), joined President Obama in the Oval Office for the
signing ceremony of their bipartisan legislation, The Energy Efficiency
Improvement Act of 2015
. This is the first energy bill to be
signed into law this Congress. Text of the legislation can be found
here
.
"I'm pleased the President has signed my bill into law because it is
good for the economy and good for the environment," said Portman. "This
is an important part of our energy plan for America that can help bring
jobs back, help make our manufacturers more competitive, and actually
help to protect the environment. I'll continue to work for passage of
my larger bill and a national energy strategy that boosts American
workers while protecting the environment at the same time."

Also yesterday, Portman and Senator Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), the
Chairman and Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee
on Investigations (PSI), wrote Attorney General Loretta Lynch
concerning monitoring of multibillion-dollar settlements entered into
between the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Bank of America, Citigroup,
and JPMorgan Chase arising out of the sale of mortgage backed
securities before the financial crisis of 2008.
With approximately $13
billion in settlement funds slated to go to third parties, Portman and
McCaskill urged the adoption of effective oversight to ensure the
settlements are used to help those hurt by the housing market downturn,
and not misdirected to inappropriate purposes. The letter asks for
details regarding the banks' compliance with the consumer relief
provisions of the settlements and safeguards to ensure the settlement
funds are well-spent.
"Ohio was hard hit by the housing crisis, and many homeowners and
communities continue to struggle with its effects-including the blight
caused by abandoned properties," Portman said. "The Department of
Justice has a duty to ensure that funds secured through these
settlements are used to address genuine, high-priority needs, such as
land-banking and foreclosure relief in Ohio, rather than being diverted
for inappropriate uses."
In addition to billions of dollars in direct fines and payments to
governmental entities, the financial crisis settlements call for the
banks to provide several billion dollars in direct and indirect
consumer relief.
Third party organizations are eligible to receive a
significant share of these settlement dollars.
Portman and McCaskill note that with such large sums at stake, there is
a need for effective oversight to ensure those funds are used to help
homeowners and neighborhoods hurt by the housing crisis, but the
oversight framework appears to be deficient.
The Department of Justice
has told Congress that specially-appointed monitors - generally,
private law firms - are responsible for ensuring that settlement funds
are allocated and spent appropriately.
But the monitors' own public
reports regarding the Citigroup, Bank of America, and JPMorgan
settlements suggest that the monitors' role is more limited.
According
to those reports, the monitors are responsible for reviewing whether
the banks have paid out funds or forgiven debt in accordance with the
terms of their settlement agreements.
They make no mention, however,
of any responsibility for overseeing how third parties actually deploy
resources received through the settlements.

On Monday, Portman, co-chair of the Senate Caucus to End Human
Trafficking, commended The University of Toledo
on the opening of the Human Trafficking and Social Justice
Institute, which will serve as an on-campus home for research on human
trafficking.
"Human trafficking is a heinous crime, and UT is leading the way to
find better ways to protect the vulnerable among us," Portman stated.
"It's critical that we're working together on all levels of government,
as well as in our local communities, to address this issue. I was
pleased last week when my measures allowing us to improve the way we
find missing children, strengthen the prosecution against buyers of sex
acts from trafficking victims, rightly define victims of child sex
trafficking as victims of child abuse and ensure that children who are
sex trafficked or sexually exploited are treated as victims, not
criminals, passed the Senate, but there is more work to be done. I
commend UT on their important work and look forward to continuing my
efforts with the Toledo community to end this form of modern-day
slavery."
Last week, Portman announced that the Senate passed two of his bills to
combat human trafficking, the Bringing Missing Children Home Act and
the Ensuring a Better Response for Victims of Child Sex Trafficking.
The Senate also passed key provisions of his Combat Human Trafficking
Act. These passed the Senate as part of the Justice for Victims of
Trafficking Act, a bipartisan and comprehensive trafficking bill.
On Tuesday, Portman, co-chair of the Senate Ukraine caucus,met with
Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv, Ukraine
.
Portman and Klitschko discussed the continued Russian aggression in
eastern Ukraine and ways to help Ukraine cope with some of the social
consequences of the conflict such as difficulties in caring for
veterans recently discharged from service.
Portman reiterated his
continued support for the Ukrainian people.
"I appreciated the opportunity to meet with Mayor Klitschko and
reiterate my support for the Ukrainian people as they continue to
defend themselves against Russian aggression," said Portman. "During my
recent visit to Ukraine, I had the chance to see firsthand the severity
of the situation and gain insight into the long-term consequences of
the conflict such as the large number of recently-discharged Ukrainian
veterans transitioning to civilian life. Mayor Klitschko and I
discussed the U.S. technical assistance for the Ukrainian government's
initiative to provide effective care and rehabilitation services for
veterans, an issue I'm familiar with due to my work with U.S.
servicemembers. I look forward working with Mayor Klitschko on this and
other issues important to the U.S.-Ukrainian relationship."
Recently, Portman traveled to Ukraine to meet with Ukrainian President
Petro Poroshenko and other government officials. Portman has repeatedly
called
for
increased U.S. military assistance to Ukraine as they continue to face
Russian aggression.
Also on Tuesday, Portman and Senator Mark Warner (D-Va.) introduced
bipartisan legislation, the Go To High School, Go To College Act
, which
will increase college access for low-income students by incentivizing
them to earn college credits in high school through the Pell Grant
program. By providing students the opportunity to simultaneously pursue
a high school diploma while earning college credits tuition-free up to
an associate's degree, this bill will maximize the efficiency of
federal student aid and therefore improve secondary and postsecondary
outcomes for students. U.S. Representatives Marcia Fudge (D-OH-11) and
Chris Gibson (R-NY-19) introduced an identical version of this
legislation in the House.
"Too many low-income students face obstacles when deciding whether to
pursue a college education," Portman stated. "Our legislation will
allow these students to get a head start on college courses in high
school, therefore improving their chances of completing a college
degree. It also provides more flexibility within the Pell Grant
program, allowing more students to graduate from college. I'm pleased
to introduce this legislation and look forward to continuing my work to
increase access to and affordability of college."
More than 300 early college high schools across the country have
improved college readiness and college completion rates of low-income
students who have traditionally been underrepresented in postsecondary
education. These schools provide students the opportunity to
simultaneously pursue a high school diploma while earning college
credits up to an associate's degree, tuition-free. A 2013 American
Institutes for Research evaluation of early college high schools found
significant increases in college enrollment and completion among early
college students. Specifically, the study found that 81 percent of
early college students enrolled in college, compared with 72 percent of
comparison students.
During the evaluation period, 25 percent of early
college students earned an associate's degree, as compared with only 5
percent of comparison students.
Expanding access to early college high schools will increase college
completion rates and ultimately reduce the time and cost of earning a
college degree. Growth of early colleges has been stifled by rising
tuition costs that are unaffordable for students and too great to be
assumed by sponsoring high school and college partners. The federal
government should allow greater flexibility within the need-based Pell
grant program to increase opportunities for students to earn college
credits and degrees.

On Wednesday, Portman announced that bipartisan legislation he
cosponsored to strengthen 529 college savings plans has passed the
Senate Finance Committee
. This legislation modernizes an
important savings tool for college education by allowing plan funds to
be spent on computers and related expenses, by reducing the paperwork
burden for such plans, and by allowing beneficiaries who receive a
refund from an educational institution to contribute the refund back to
the plan without penalty. Portman is a cosponsor of this legislation
which was introduced by U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).
"I'm pleased to support this commonsense legislation that will make
college more affordable and accessible for students," Portman stated.
"Ohio has a strong College Advantage program, yet in talking to
families across the state, it is clear that more can and should be
done. By modernizing this section of the tax code, we can help expand
educational opportunities while letting young people just starting out
keep more of their own hard-earned money."
Over the past 40 years, college tuition rates have been consistently
increasing at two to three times the rate of inflation each year. Ohio's
529 college savings program, College Advantage, is the fifth largest of
any state, supporting over 640,000 beneficiaries. A recent College
Savings Plan Network study found that 70% of 529 college savings
accounts are held by households with income below $150,000. Concerned
by the mounting financial strain placed on young professionals, states
began to develop programs designed to help families and students save
for their college education. This legislation would modify the tax
treatment of college savings plans authorized under section 529 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
The House of Representatives passed an
identical measure on February 25, 2015, by a bipartisan, veto-proof
majority of 401-20.
Also on Wednesday, Portman applauded a U.S. International Trade
Commission (ITC) ruling protecting Ohio steel manufacturers and the
jobs they support
. The senators worked closely on two
related OCTG cases on 2014 that resulted in important victories for
Ohio workers.
Yesterday's unanimous ITC ruling maintains the current
duties on Oil Country Tubular Goods (OCTG) imports from China.
"I'm pleased with this unanimous ruling reaffirming that American
manufacturing workers deserve to compete on a level playing field,"
Portman stated. "Ohio pipe and tube workers are among the best in the
world, but we must stand up to foreign competitors who break trade
rules at the expense of Ohio workers."
Oil Country Tubular Goods are used for domestic oil exploration,
especially shale. Steel produced for the U.S. energy market, such as
OCTG, accounts for approximately 10 percent of domestic steel
production and nearly 8,000 American jobs nationwide. U.S. producers,
however, are increasingly losing sales to foreign competitors because
imports of OCTG have doubled since 2008 and increased by 61 percent
thus far in 2014 compared to 2013. By some accounts, OCTG imports
represent 50 percent of the pipes used for gas and oil drilling in the
United States.
Portman has led the fight on supporting OCTG workers from illegal
imports and has visited several Ohio steel manufacturers including U.S.
Steel Lorain, Vallourec Star in Youngstown, and TMK IPSCO in
Brookfield, Ohio.
On Social Media:
President Obama signs Sen. Rob Portman's energy-efficiency bill
Measures to improve the country's energy efficiency got a boost this
afternoon with President Barack Obama signing a bill that could reduce
energy use in commercial buildings and government offices.
U.S. Sens. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, and Jeanne Shaheen, a New
Hampshire Democrat, sponsored the bill. It was a pared down version of
a broader measure that Portman has pursued for four years. He said he
still intends to push the other provisions.
None of the provisions in today's bill force the private sector to do a
thing, Portman said. But the bill will establish a voluntary "Tenant
Star" program, similar to the Energy Star label for appliances, for
commercial buildings that reduce their energy consumption.
That could create an incentive for businesses looking to lease space,
as building owners and tenants become more conservation-minded, Portman
said.
"Based on the studies that have been done, we believe this is going to
have a large impact on energy efficiency, because one of the great
areas for savings is in the commercial buildings, many of which are not
properly insulated" or lack other efficiencies, Portman said. "And so
this will result in a lot of upgrades and improvements to commercial
buildings, which will then get the Tenant Star designation, which will
then be more attractive to tenants."
Another provision will require the government to collect and disclose
energy usage data for federally leased buildings.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the
Department of Energy, will start developing standards for the Tenant
Star designation within 180 days, according to Portman's office and the
bill's language.

Ohio lawmakers help fight against trafficking
It's good to see the overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress for
greater aid to human-trafficking victims, with the Justice for Victims
of Trafficking Act passing the Senate by unanimous vote on Wednesday.
This is another way to address a scourge that has been receiving more
attention both locally and nationally in recent years.
The bill, which strengthens penalties against traffickers and provides
funds to aid victims, now goes back to the House after being reworked
by the Senate.
The legislation had strong backing from Ohio's congressional
delegation, including U.S. Rep. Joyce Beatty, D-Columbus, Ohio
Republican Sen. Rob Portman and Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. The
Senate measure incorporated two bills and an amendment advanced by
Portman and included three amendments by Brown.
("Ohio lawmakers help fight against trafficking," Editorial. Columbus
Dispatch
. April 27, 2015.)
Promoting trade
Congress will vote as soon as this week whether to authorize President
Obama to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That critical trade
agreement would serve America's economic and political interests in
Asia.
Lawmakers are proposing all sorts of amendments to the controversial
deal, which opponents wrongly fear would harm American workers. But an
amendment sponsored by Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) aimed at curbing
currency manipulation - an anti-competitive practice by other countries
that damages the U.S. economy - deserves lawmakers' and the President's
support.
Many nations have manipulated their exchange rates by deliberately
buying up foreign currencies; that makes their own exports cheaper and
enables them to sell more goods abroad. Historically, the U.S. dollar
has been a particularly popular target of manipulators. Detroit
automakers, who have been hit especially hard by Japanese currency
intervention, voice strong support for curbing the practice.
Senator Portman's measure, like the proposed trade agreement's
fair-labor, environmental, and copyright standards, would ensure that
all parties to the deal play by the same rules, and that American firms
can compete fairly abroad.
Mr. Portman, who served as U.S. trade representative in the George W.
Bush administration, asserts that curbing currency manipulation would
level the playing field for American firms. "All of the advances we
would make in the [trade] agreement, opening up more markets for
exports, would be devastated by currency manipulation that makes our
exports more expensive," he told The Blade's editorial page last week..
The practice demonstrably harmed auto workers in Ohio and Michigan, and
created much of the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. That deficit has
narrowed in recent years, after Japan stopped devaluing its currency,
but the trade deal should ensure it isn't allowed to do such things
again.
Including the currency provision in the trade deal could help it gain
support from Democratic lawmakers, Mr. Portman said. Many of the
President's usual Democratic allies, including Sen. Sherrod Brown (D.,
Ohio), are reluctant to grant the White House fast-track authority -
which would allow Congress to approve or reject the trade agreement,
but not to amend or filibuster it - because union leaders oppose that
mechanism.
A Senate committee narrowly defeated Mr. Portman's amendment last week.
But he said he plans to submit it again when the trade bill reaches the
Senate floor. .
Free, fair trade arrangements arise not by accident, but as a result of
deliberate regulation that limits anti-competitive practices while
keeping markets open and reducing barriers to trade.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership and the proposed limits on currency
manipulation would serve those goals. Both deserve bipartisan support.

Portman to meet Netanyahu in Israel to talk Iran nuclear deal
Sen. Rob Portman plans to meet this weekend with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior Israeli officials as he travels to
Israel for the first time since the summer of 2012.
Portman, R-Ohio, said today the meetings will deal with the proposed
deal between the Obama administration and Iran, which is designed to
delay Tehran's plans to build a nuclear weapon.
Netanyahu has sharply objected to the proposed deal, while Portman has
voiced concerns. The pact could be completed by the middle of the
summer.
In particular, Portman said today that "it's very difficult to have the
negotiations" with Iran limited to just "nuclear weapons. One of our
grave concerns about Iran getting the nuclear weapon capability is the
fact they are the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism in the world."
Portman, who met with Netanyahu during his 2012 trip, will leave this
afternoon and return to the United States Monday.

Portman, Warner push Pell for early college credits
As Congress considers rewriting No Child Left Behind and the Higher
Education Act, Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Mark Warner (D-Va.) are
aiming at the intersection of the two: Today they'll unveil a new bill
that would encourage high schools to offer college coursework to
students by allowing them to fund it with Pell grants.
The bill, the Go to High School, Go to College Act, would allow Pell
grant funds to flow to low-income high school students taking courses
that earn them transferable college credits. The high schools would be
reimbursed with Pell funds for the student's tuition and fees after the
student completes the credit. Reps. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio) and Chris
Gibson (R-N.Y.) will introduce a companion measure in the House.
"This, in our view is, one way not just to get kids college-bound but
to keep them in high school," Portman said. "For very little money, it's
a lot of bang for the buck."
Portman and Warner hope the approach will encourage more so-called
"early college" high schools by reducing the tuition and fees high
schools often pick up when they offer such coursework. And students who
attend some early college high schools have been shown to have better
high school completion and college attendance rates. And they'd face
fewer semesters in college if and when they do attend, giving them a
leg-up on paying for a two- or four-year degree.

I&#8217;m
familiar
with
due
to
my
work
with
U.S.
servicemembers.
I
look
forward
working
with
Mayor
Klitschko
on
this
and
other
issues
important
to
the
U.S.-Ukrainian
relationship.&#8221;
Recently,
Portman
traveled
to
Ukraine
to
meet
with
Ukrainian
President
Petro
Poroshenko
and
other
government
officials.
Portman
has
repeatedly
called
for
increased
U.S.
military
assistance
to
Ukraine
as
they
continue
to
face
Russian
aggression.
Also
on
Tuesday,
Portman
and
Senator
Mark
Warner
(D-Va.)
introduced
bipartisan
legislation,
the
Go
To
High
School,
Go
To
College
Act ,
which
will
increase
college
access
for
low-income
students
by
incentivizing
them
to
earn
college
credits
in
high
school
through
the
Pell
Grant
program.
By
providing
students
the
opportunity
to
simultaneously
pursue
a
high
school
diploma
while
earning
college
credits
tuition-free
up
to
an
associate&#8217;s
degree,
this
bill
will
maximize
the
efficiency
of
federal
student
aid
and
therefore
improve
secondary
and
postsecondary
outcomes
for
students.
U.S.
Representatives
Marcia
Fudge
(D-OH-11)
and
Chris
Gibson
(R-NY-19)
introduced
an
identical
version
of
this
legislation
in
the
House.
&#8220;Too
many
low-income
students
face
obstacles
when
deciding
whether
to
pursue
a
college
education,&#8221;
Portman
stated.
&#8220;Our
legislation
will
allow
these
students
to
get
a
head
start
on
college
courses
in
high
school,
therefore
improving
their
chances
of
completing
a
college
degree.
It
also
provides
more
flexibility
within
the
Pell
Grant
program,
allowing
more
students
to
graduate
from
college.
I&#8217;m
pleased
to
introduce
this
legislation
and
look
forward
to
continuing
my
work
to
increase
access
to
and
affordability
of
college.&#8221;
More
than
300
early
college
high
schools
across
the
country
have
improved
college
readiness
and
college
completion
rates
of
low-income
students
who
have
traditionally
been
underrepresented
in
postsecondary
education.
These
schools
provide
students
the
opportunity
to
simultaneously
pursue
a
high
school
diploma
while
earning
college
credits
up
to
an
associate&#8217;s
degree,
tuition-free.
A
2013
American
Institutes
for
Research
evaluation
of
early
college
high
schools
found
significant
increases
in
college
enrollment
and
completion
among
early
college
students.
Specifically,
the
study
found
that
81
percent
of
early
college
students
enrolled
in
college,
compared
with
72
percent
of
comparison
students.
During
the
evaluation
period,
25
percent
of
early
college
students
earned
an
associate&#8217;s
degree,
as
compared
with
only
5
percent
of
comparison
students.
Expanding
access
to
early
college
high
schools
will
increase
college
completion
rates
and
ultimately
reduce
the
time
and
cost
of
earning
a
college
degree.
Growth
of
early
colleges
has
been
stifled
by
rising
tuition
costs
that
are
unaffordable
for
students
and
too
great
to
be
assumed
by
sponsoring
high
school
and
college
partners.
The
federal
government
should
allow
greater
flexibility
within
the
need-based
Pell
grant
program
to
increase
opportunities
for
students
to
earn
college
credits
and
degrees.

On
Wednesday,
Portman
announced
that
bipartisan
legislation
he
cosponsored
to
strengthen
529
college
savings
plans
has
passed
the
Senate
Finance
Committee .
This
legislation
modernizes
an
important
savings
tool
for
college
education
by
allowing
plan
funds
to
be
spent
on
computers
and
related
expenses,
by
reducing
the
paperwork
burden
for
such
plans,
and
by
allowing
beneficiaries
who
receive
a
refund
from
an
educational
institution
to
contribute
the
refund
back
to
the
plan
without
penalty.
Portman
is
a
cosponsor
of
this
legislation
which
was
introduced
by
U.S.
Senator
Chuck
Grassley
(R-Iowa).
&#8220;I&#8217;m
pleased
to
support
this
commonsense
legislation
that
will
make
college
more
affordable
and
accessible
for
students,&#8221;
Portman
stated.
&#8220;Ohio
has
a
strong
College
Advantage
program,
yet
in
talking
to
families
across
the
state,
it
is
clear
that
more
can
and
should
be
done.
By
modernizing
this
section
of
the
tax
code,
we
can
help
expand
educational
opportunities
while
letting
young
people
just
starting
out
keep
more
of
their
own
hard-earned
money.&#8221;
Over
the
past
40
years,
college
tuition
rates
have
been
consistently
increasing
at
two
to
three
times
the
rate
of
inflation
each
year.
Ohio&#8217;s
529
college
savings
program,
College
Advantage,
is
the
fifth
largest
of
any
state,
supporting
over
640,000
beneficiaries.
A
recent
College
Savings
Plan
Network
study
found
that
70%
of
529
college
savings
accounts
are
held
by
households
with
income
below
$150,000.
Concerned
by
the
mounting
financial
strain
placed
on
young
professionals,
states
began
to
develop
programs
designed
to
help
families
and
students
save
for
their
college
education.
This
legislation
would
modify
the
tax
treatment
of
college
savings
plans
authorized
under
section
529
of
the
Internal
Revenue
Code.
The
House
of
Representatives
passed
an
identical
measure
on
February
25,
2015,
by
a
bipartisan,
veto-proof
majority
of
401-20.
Also
on
Wednesday,
Portman
applauded
a
U.S.
International
Trade
Commission
(ITC)
ruling
protecting
Ohio
steel
manufacturers
and
the
jobs
they
support .
The
senators
worked
closely
on
two
related
OCTG
cases
on
2014
that
resulted
in
important
victories
for
Ohio
workers.
Yesterday&#8217;s
unanimous
ITC
ruling
maintains
the
current
duties
on
Oil
Country
Tubular
Goods
(OCTG)
imports
from
China.
&#8220;I&#8217;m
pleased
with
this
unanimous
ruling
reaffirming
that
American
manufacturing
workers
deserve
to
compete
on
a
level
playing
field,&#8221;
Portman
stated.
&#8220;Ohio
pipe
and
tube
workers
are
among
the
best
in
the
world,
but
we
must
stand
up
to
foreign
competitors
who
break
trade
rules
at
the
expense
of
Ohio
workers.&#8221;
Oil
Country
Tubular
Goods
are
used
for
domestic
oil
exploration,
especially
shale.
Steel
produced
for
the
U.S.
energy
market,
such
as
OCTG,
accounts
for
approximately
10
percent
of
domestic
steel
production
and
nearly
8,000
American
jobs
nationwide.
U.S.
producers,
however,
are
increasingly
losing
sales
to
foreign
competitors
because
imports
of
OCTG
have
doubled
since
2008
and
increased
by
61
percent
thus
far
in
2014
compared
to
2013.
By
some
accounts,
OCTG
imports
represent
50
percent
of
the
pipes
used
for
gas
and
oil
drilling
in
the
United
States.
Portman
has
led
the
fight
on
supporting
OCTG
workers
from
illegal
imports
and
has
visited
several
Ohio
steel
manufacturers
including
U.S.
Steel
Lorain,
Vallourec
Star
in
Youngstown,
and
TMK
IPSCO
in
Brookfield,
Ohio.
On

President
Obama
signs
Sen.
Rob
Portman's
energy-efficiency
bill
Measures
to
improve
the
country's
energy
efficiency
got
a
boost
this
afternoon
with
President
Barack
Obama
signing
a
bill
that
could
reduce
energy
use
in
commercial
buildings
and
government
offices.
U.S.
Sens.
Rob
Portman,
an
Ohio
Republican,
and
Jeanne
Shaheen,
a
New
Hampshire
Democrat,
sponsored
the
bill.
It
was
a
pared
down
version
of
a
broader
measure
that
Portman
has
pursued
for
four
years.
He
said
he
still
intends
to
push
the
other
provisions.
None
of
the
provisions
in
today's
bill
force
the
private
sector
to
do
a
thing,
Portman
said.
But
the
bill
will
establish
a
voluntary
"Tenant
Star"
program,
similar
to
the
Energy
Star
label
for
appliances,
for
commercial
buildings
that
reduce
their
energy
consumption.
That
could
create
an
incentive
for
businesses
looking
to
lease
space,
as
building
owners
and
tenants
become
more
conservation-minded,
Portman
said.
"Based
on
the
studies
that
have
been
done,
we
believe
this
is
going
to
have
a
large
impact
on
energy
efficiency,
because
one
of
the
great
areas
for
savings
is
in
the
commercial
buildings,
many
of
which
are
not
properly
insulated"
or
lack
other
efficiencies,
Portman
said.
"And
so
this
will
result
in
a
lot
of
upgrades
and
improvements
to
commercial
buildings,
which
will
then
get
the
Tenant
Star
designation,
which
will
then
be
more
attractive
to
tenants."
Another
provision
will
require
the
government
to
collect
and
disclose
energy
usage
data
for
federally
leased
buildings.
&#8230;
The
U.S.
Environmental
Protection
Agency,
in
consultation
with
the
Department
of
Energy,
will
start
developing
standards
for
the
Tenant
Star
designation
within
180
days,
according
to
Portman's
office
and
the
bill's
language.

Ohio
lawmakers
help
fight
against
trafficking
It&#8217;s
good
to
see
the
overwhelming
bipartisan
support
in
Congress
for
greater
aid
to
human-trafficking
victims,
with
the
Justice
for
Victims
of
Trafficking
Act
passing
the
Senate
by
unanimous
vote
on
Wednesday.
This
is
another
way
to
address
a
scourge
that
has
been
receiving
more
attention
both
locally
and
nationally
in
recent
years.
The
bill,
which
strengthens
penalties
against
traffickers
and
provides
funds
to
aid
victims,
now
goes
back
to
the
House
after
being
reworked
by
the
Senate.
&#8230;
The
legislation
had
strong
backing
from
Ohio's
congressional
delegation,
including
U.S.
Rep.
Joyce
Beatty,
D-Columbus,
Ohio
Republican
Sen.
Rob

and
Ohio

The

Promoting
trade
Congress
will
vote
as
soon
as
this
week
whether
to
authorize
President
Obama
to
negotiate
the
Trans-Pacific
Partnership.
That
critical
trade
agreement
would
serve
America&#8217;s
economic
and
political
interests
in
Asia.
Lawmakers
are
proposing
all
sorts
of
amendments
to
the
controversial
deal,
which
opponents
wrongly
fear
would
harm
American
workers.
But
an
amendment
sponsored
by
Sen.
Rob
Portman
(R.,
Ohio)
aimed
at
curbing
currency
manipulation
&#8212;
an
anti-competitive
practice
by
other
countries
that
damages
the
U.S.
economy
&#8212;
deserves
lawmakers&#8217;
and
the
President&#8217;s
support.
Many
nations
have
manipulated
their
exchange
rates
by
deliberately
buying
up
foreign
currencies;
that
makes
their
own
exports
cheaper
and
enables
them
to
sell
more
goods
abroad.
Historically,
the
U.S.
dollar
has
been
a
particularly
popular
target
of
manipulators.
Detroit
automakers,
who
have
been
hit
especially
hard
by
Japanese
currency
intervention,
voice
strong
support
for
curbing
the
practice.
&#8230;
Senator
Portman&#8217;s
measure,
like
the
proposed
trade
agreement&#8217;s
fair-labor,
environmental,
and
copyright
standards,
would
ensure
that
all
parties
to
the
deal
play
by
the
same
rules,
and
that
American
firms
can
compete
fairly
abroad.
Mr.
Portman,
who
served
as
U.S.
trade
representative
in
the
George
W.
Bush
administration,
asserts
that
curbing
currency
manipulation
would
level
the
playing
field
for
American
firms.
&#8220;All
of
the
advances
we
would
make
in
the
[trade]
agreement,
opening
up
more
markets
for
exports,
would
be
devastated
by
currency
manipulation
that
makes
our
exports
more
expensive,&#8221;
he
told
The
Blade&#8217;s
editorial
page
last
week.&#8230;
The
practice
demonstrably
harmed
auto
workers
in
Ohio
and
Michigan,
and
created
much
of
the
U.S.
trade
deficit
with
Japan.
That
deficit
has
narrowed
in
recent
years,
after
Japan
stopped
devaluing
its
currency,
but
the
trade
deal
should
ensure
it
isn&#8217;t
allowed
to
do
such
things
again.
Including
the
currency
provision
in
the
trade
deal
could
help
it
gain
support
from
Democratic
lawmakers,
Mr.
Portman
said.
Many
of
the
President&#8217;s
usual
Democratic
allies,
including
Sen.
Sherrod
Brown
(D.,
Ohio),
are
reluctant
to
grant
the
White
House
fast-track
authority
&#8212;
which
would
allow
Congress
to
approve
or
reject
the
trade
agreement,
but
not
to
amend
or
filibuster
it
&#8212;
because
union
leaders
oppose
that
mechanism.
A
Senate
committee
narrowly
defeated
Mr.
Portman&#8217;s
amendment
last
week.
But
he
said
he
plans
to
submit
it
again
when
the
trade
bill
reaches
the
Senate
floor.
&#8230;
Free,
fair
trade
arrangements
arise
not
by
accident,
but
as
a
result
of
deliberate
regulation
that
limits
anti-competitive
practices
while
keeping
markets
open
and
reducing
barriers
to
trade.
The
Trans-Pacific
Partnership
and
the
proposed
limits
on
currency
manipulation
would
serve
those
goals.
Both
deserve
bipartisan
support.

Portman
to

Iran
nuclear
deal
Sen.
Rob

plans
to
meet
this
weekend
with
Israeli
Prime
Minister
Benjamin
Netanyahu
and
other
senior
Israeli
officials
as
he
travels
to
Israel
for
the
first
time
since
the
summer
of
2012.
Portman,
R-Ohio,
said
today
the
meetings
will
deal
with
the
proposed
deal
between
the
Obama
administration
and
Iran,
which
is
designed
to
delay
Tehran&#8217;s
plans
to
build
a
nuclear
weapon.
Netanyahu
has
sharply
objected
to
the
proposed
deal,
while
Portman
has
voiced
concerns.
The
pact
could
be
completed
by
the
middle
of
the
summer.
In
particular,
Portman
said
today
that
&#8220;it&#8217;s
very
difficult
to
have
the
negotiations&#8221;
with
Iran
limited
to
just
&#8220;nuclear
weapons.
One
of
our
grave
concerns
about
Iran
getting
the

capability
is
the
fact
they
are
the

Portman,

push
Pell
for
early
college
credits
As
Congress
considers
rewriting
No
Child
Left
Behind
and
the
Higher
Education
Act,
Sens.
Rob
Portman
(R-Ohio)
and
Mark
Warner
(D-Va.)
are
aiming
at
the
intersection
of
the
two:
Today
they&#8217;ll
unveil
a
new
bill
that
would
encourage
high
schools
to
offer
college
coursework
to
students
by
allowing
them
to
fund
it
with
Pell
grants.
The
bill,
the
Go
to
High
School,
Go
to
College
Act,
would
allow
Pell
grant
funds
to
flow
to
low-income
high
school
students
taking
courses
that
earn
them
transferable
college
credits.
The
high
schools
would
be
reimbursed
with
Pell
funds
for
the
student&#8217;s
tuition
and
fees
after
the
student
completes
the
credit.
Reps.
Marcia
Fudge
(D-Ohio)
and
Chris
Gibson
(R-N.Y.)
will
introduce
a
companion
measure
in
the
House.
&#8220;This,
in
our
view
is,
one
way
not
just
to
get
kids
college-bound
but
to
keep
them
in
high
school,&#8221;
Portman
said.
&#8220;For
very
little
money,
it&#8217;s
a
lot
of
bang
for
the
buck.&#8221;
Portman
and
Warner
hope
the
approach
will
encourage
more
so-called
&#8220;early
college&#8221;
high
schools
by
reducing
the
tuition
and
fees
high
schools
often
pick
up
when
they
offer
such
coursework.
And
students
who
attend
some
early
college
high
schools
have
been
shown
to
have
better
high
school
completion
and
college
attendance
rates.
And
they&#8217;d
face
fewer
semesters
in
college
if
and
when
they
do
attend,
giving
them
a
leg-up
on
paying
for
a
two-
or
four-year
degree.
