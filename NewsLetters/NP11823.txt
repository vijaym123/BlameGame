Dear Friend,
I want to share a few important updates about my work in Washington
with you, but first I would like to remind you that on March 17th I
will be hosting a Neighborhood Conversation in Providence. This is an
opportunity for me to connect directly to you to hear about your
concerns and I hope you will be able to attend.
Forcing a Vote on the Minimum Wage
No one in America should work full time and live in poverty. That is
why this week I signed a discharge petition - a legislative move to
bring a bill to the House Floor, even over the objection of the Speaker
of the House, so long as a majority of members sign the petition - to
force a vote on raising the minimum wage. Right now a full-time minimum
wage worker makes $14,500 a year, which leaves too many families
struggling just to make ends meet. After years of growing income
inequality, it is time to close this gap, promote economic opportunity,
and give hardworking Americans the raise they deserve.
Cracking Down on Health Care Fraud and Abuse
This week the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services
announced a recording breaking $4.3 billion in fiscal year 2013
healthcare fraud and prevention recoveries for taxpayers. The
Affordable Care Act provided agencies new tools to crack down on fraud
and over the last five years a total of $19.2 billion in fraudulent
payments in Medicare and related programs have been recovered for the
benefit of U.S. taxpayers. These results speak for the themselves and I
will continue my work to implement the health reform law to expand
affordable care access and ensure that federal agencies continue to
aggressively pursue instances of fraud and abuse in Medicare.
Republican Assault on Consumer Protections
Instead of taking action to raise the minimum wage and renew
unemployment benefits, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives
this week introduced legislation to undermine consumer protections.
Four years after the passage of the Wall Street reform bill, my
colleagues on the other side are attempting to weaken the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau - the government watchdog that is working
to curb abuses by big banks, payday lenders, debt collectors, credit
card companies, mortgage servicers and other financial institutions.
Many consumer, senior, civil rights, and labor groups stand opposed to
this legislation and I am pleased that the president's senior advisers
have already recommended that he veto this bill should it make it to
his desk.
As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns,
call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at
David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov.
My best always,
David Cicilline

Dear
Friend,
I
want
to
share
a
few
important
updates
about
my
work
in
Washington
with
you,
but
first
I
would
like
to
remind
you
that
on
March
17th
I
will
be
hosting
a
Neighborhood
Conversation
in
Providence.
This
is
an
opportunity
for
me
to
connect
directly
to
you
to
hear
about
your
concerns
and
I
hope
you
will
be
able
to
attend.
Forcing
a
Vote
on
the
Minimum
Wage
No
one
in
America
should
work
full
time
and
live
in
poverty.
That
is
why
this
week
I
signed
a
discharge
petition
&#8211;
a
legislative
move
to
bring
a
bill
to
the
House
Floor,
even
over
the
objection
of
the
Speaker
of
the
House,
so
long
as
a
majority
of
members
sign
the
petition
&#8211;
to
force
a
vote
on
raising
the
minimum
wage.
Right
now
a
full-time
minimum
wage
worker
makes
$14,500
a
year,
which
leaves
too
many
families
struggling
just
to
make
ends
meet.
After
years
of
growing
income
inequality,
it
is
time
to
close
this
gap,
promote
economic
opportunity,
and
give
hardworking
Americans
the
raise
they
deserve.
Cracking
Down
on
Health
Care
Fraud
and
Abuse
This
week
the
Departments
of
Justice
and
Health
and
Human
Services
announced
a
recording
breaking
$4.3
billion
in
fiscal
year
2013
healthcare
fraud
and
prevention
recoveries
for
taxpayers.
The
Affordable
Care
Act
provided
agencies
new
tools
to
crack
down
on
fraud
and
over
the
last
five
years
a
total
of
$19.2
billion
in
fraudulent
payments
in
Medicare
and
related
programs
have
been
recovered
for
the
benefit
of
U.S.
taxpayers.
These
results
speak
for
the
themselves
and
I
will
continue
my
work
to
implement
the
health
reform
law
to
expand
affordable
care
access
and
ensure
that
federal
agencies
continue
to
aggressively
pursue
instances
of
fraud
and
abuse
in
Medicare.
Republican
Assault
on
Consumer
Protections
Instead
of
taking
action
to
raise
the
minimum
wage
and
renew
unemployment
benefits,
Republicans
in
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives
this
week
introduced
legislation
to
undermine
consumer
protections.
Four
years
after
the
passage
of
the
Wall
Street
reform
bill,
my
colleagues
on
the
other
side
are
attempting
to
weaken
the
Consumer
Financial
Protection
Bureau
&#8211;
the
government
watchdog
that
is
working
to
curb
abuses
by
big
banks,
payday
lenders,
debt
collectors,
credit
card
companies,
mortgage
servicers
and
other
financial
institutions.
Many
consumer,
senior,
civil
rights,
and
labor
groups
stand
opposed
to
this
legislation
and
I
am
pleased
that
the
president&#8217;s
senior
advisers
have
already
recommended
that
he
veto
this
bill
should
it
make
it
to
his
desk.
As
always,
if
you
or
someone
you
know
has
any
questions
or
concerns,
call
my
office
at
729-5600
or
send
me
an
email
at
David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov .
