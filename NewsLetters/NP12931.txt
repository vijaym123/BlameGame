To the Editor:
After five years of anemic economic growth, President Obama still
doesn't have an answer for one of the biggest questions facing
hardworking families in America: Where are the jobs?
With more than 10 million Americans unemployed and millions more living
paycheck to paycheck, the president has created a "new normal" in
America.
His new normal involves taking more of your hard-earned money and
redistributing it to pay for others' cost of living. Your money is
going to pay for skyrocketing health care costs, more unemployment
checks, higher energy costs and growing the size and scope of the
federal government.
This president continues to take more of your hard-earned money while
offering no solutions for upward mobility and good-paying jobs.
Just ask any family in the 2nd District and they will tell you that
they're just one broken water heater or car repair away from not paying
their bills on the 15th and 30th of every month.
Over the last five years, the president's new normal has taken away the
American Dream and has forced families to settle for less. That is not
only unacceptable, it's un-American. We can't allow mediocrity to
become the new normal in America.
Time and time again, the House has passed job-creating solutions that
will increase upward mobility and restore the American Dream.
In fact, the House has passed 171 bills that are stuck in Harry Reid's
do-nothing Senate.
Republicans have passed bills authorizing the Keystone XL pipeline,
which will lower energy costs, create tens of thousands of good-paying
jobs and begin a new era of energy independence.
We have also passed common sense policies like the Skills Act, which
helps the long-term unemployed by giving them the training they need to
find good-paying jobs in this tough economy.
Without real leadership from President Obama and Harry Reid on
job-creating solutions like these, our nation will continue to struggle
and that's not fair to the American people.
As your Representative, I pledge to you that I will keep fighting to
increase the size of your paychecks, restore your individual liberties
and lower costs on everyday items that you depend on like groceries,
gasoline and the cost of your health care.
Rather than starting yet another year with the same old failed
policies, it's time we turn the page and begin a new era focused on
finding solutions and making your lives just a little bit easier.

To
the
Editor:
After
five
years
of
anemic
economic
growth,
President
Obama
still
doesn&#8217;t
have
an
answer
for
one
of
the
biggest
questions
facing
hardworking
families
in
America:
Where
are
the
jobs?
With
more
than
10
million
Americans
unemployed
and
millions
more
living
paycheck
to
paycheck,
the
president
has
created
a
&#8220;new
normal&#8221;
in
America.
His
new
normal
involves
taking
more
of
your
hard-earned
money
and
redistributing
it
to
pay
for
others&#8217;
cost
of
living.
Your
money
is
going
to
pay
for
skyrocketing
health
care
costs,
more
unemployment
checks,
higher
energy
costs
and
growing
the
size
and
scope
of
the
federal
government.
This
president
continues
to
take
more
of
your
hard-earned
money
while
offering
no
solutions
for
upward
mobility
and
good-paying
jobs.
Just
ask
any
family
in
the
2nd
District
and
they
will
tell
you
that
they&#8217;re
just
one
broken
water
heater
or
car
repair
away
from
not
paying
their
bills
on
the
15th
and
30th
of
every
month.
Over
the
last
five
years,
the
president&#8217;s
new
normal
has
taken
away
the
American
Dream
and
has
forced
families
to
settle
for
less.
That
is
not
only
unacceptable,
it&#8217;s
un-American.
We
can&#8217;t
allow
mediocrity
to
become
the
new
normal
in
America.
Time
and
time
again,
the
House
has
passed
job-creating
solutions
that
will
increase
upward
mobility
and
restore
the
American
Dream.
In
fact,
the
House
has
passed
171
bills
that
are
stuck
in
Harry
Reid&#8217;s
do-nothing
Senate.
Republicans
have
passed
bills
authorizing
the
Keystone
XL
pipeline,
which
will
lower
energy
costs,
create
tens
of
thousands
of
good-paying
jobs
and
begin
a
new
era
of
energy
independence.
We
have
also
passed
common
sense
policies
like
the
Skills
Act,
which
helps
the
long-term
unemployed
by
giving
them
the
training
they
need
to
find
good-paying
jobs
in
this
tough
economy.
Without
real
leadership
from
President
Obama
and
Harry
Reid
on
job-creating
solutions
like
these,
our
nation
will
continue
to
struggle
and
that&#8217;s
not
fair
to
the
American
people.
As
your
Representative,
I
pledge
to
you
that
I
will
keep
fighting
to
increase
the
size
of
your
paychecks,
restore
your
individual
liberties
and
lower
costs
on
everyday
items
that
you
depend
on
like
groceries,
gasoline
and
the
cost
of
your
health
care.
Rather
than
starting
yet
another
year
with
the
same
old
failed
policies,
it&#8217;s
time
we
turn
the
page
and
begin
a
new
era
focused
on
finding
solutions
and
making
your
lives
just
a
little
bit
easier.
