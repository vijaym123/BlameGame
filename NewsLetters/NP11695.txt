A Message from Representative Sean Duffy
March 9, 2014
Dear Friends,
Any week that includes spending time with my family, working on
legislation that directly impacts the 7th District, and introducing a
wider audience to some of our distinctly Wisconsin traditions is a good
week in my book. Keep reading for the week that was.
Take a little time to enjoy "The View": It was my privilege to join
guest co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy and the ladies of "The View" this
week. We talked about the joys of raising our growing family in
Wisconsin and educated the ladies about our Wisconsin lumberjack
tradition. Click on the image to watch:
Warm-Up Wisconsin: We are still battling a tough Winter in Wisconsin.
To go with the record low temperatures, thousands of constituents have
experienced record high propane and energy bills.
I worked directly
with the USDOT to obtain an extension of Hours of Service trucking
waiver through the end of February. This week, the House acted to
extend this waiver through the end of the spring. I co-sponsored that
bill, and was glad it passed. The Senate should act on this bill
immediately.
This week I also met with National Propane Gas
Association Director, and Wausau resident, Gary France. He told me that
without this waiver, some supplies could have been cut by up to 30%!
During our meeting, Mr. France and I also discussed concerns that I've
heard from many constituents regarding exports causing an increase in
prices and allegations of price gauging.
While propane production is
at all time highs, exports are outpacing our ability to produce propane
at home. We must have a mechanism in place that ensures that when a
propane crisis hits home, we're able to ensure Americans have access to
the propane first. I was encouraged to hear that Mr. France agreed and
he and the Propane Gas Association will continue to work with the
government and industry to make sure these concerns are addressed and
answered.
Artistic Discovery: Our office is again collecting submissions for the
2014 Congressional Art Competition. The competition is open to all high
school students. Click on the image for more details.
Again, thank you for the continued privilege of Representing Wisconsin's
7th District. and bragging about it as well.
Have a great week,
Sean
