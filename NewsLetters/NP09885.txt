Dear Friend,
This was a busy week on Capitol Hill. First and foremost, my House
Armed Services Committee colleagues and I approved a fiscal year 2015
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) which included several
provisions I worked on including saving the A-10 "Warthog."
I remain concerned about the long-term effects of cutting our force
levels to the lowest we have seen since World War II, but feel the bill
we passed takes steps to address a scarcity of funding while still
making sure our men and women in uniform have what they need to protect
our nation. This legislation does well to provide for the common
defense while keeping in mind difficult economic realities.
Some key provisions impacting our national security and Missourians
include:
A-10 "Warthog" - The Department of Defense proposed the
divestment of the A-10 airframe, which would create a critical gap in
the Air Force's close air support capability that will put the lives of
our ground troops at risk. Simply put, the A-10 is the nation's best
close air support platform and has proven itself time and time again in
combat. This legislation includes an amendment that I co-sponsored,
that will fully fund the maintenance, operation, and upgrading of the
A-10 fleet for FY15, providing our troops the vital close air support
that has saved numerous American lives.
AH-64 "Apache" Helicopter - Under the proposed Army Aviation
Restructuring Initiative, National Guard units like the 1-135th
Attack/Reconnaissance Battalion at Whiteman Air Force Base would see
all of its Apaches transferred to active duty units. I co-sponsored
legislation included in this bill that would prevent this initiative
and keep the Apache helicopters with these highly trained units.
Congress and the Army have invested billions of dollars training the
National Guard to be interchangeable with the Army; this legislation
will allow that investment to pay off.
Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) - At a time when the
final force structure of our military is still undecided, it makes
little sense to approve a new round of BRAC. That is why my colleagues
and I rejected the President's request for another round of BRAC.
As a
member of the Readiness Subcommittee, I believe that the Administration
needs to provide detailed information on its proposed savings and
efficiencies before a new round of BRAC is considered.
EA-18G "Growler" - The Navy has an unfunded requirement for
airborne electronic attack aircraft. If allowed to go unfunded, as the
President's budget suggests, the Navy would lose its only airborne
electronic attack platform. This bill includes a plan I proposed to
provide funding to keep the program and production line alive. The
Growler is the nation's only full spectrum tactical airborne electronic
attack aircraft, and controlling the electromagnetic spectrum is
paramount to strike capability in contested environments. This funding
will allow the St. Louis Boeing plant to continue the F/A-18 production
line, which supports 60,000 jobs and accounts for $3 billion in
economic impact.
Long-Range Strike Bomber - This legislation continues funding
for long-range strike bomber research and development. The bill invests
in the future of long-range strike capabilities and a long-range strike
bomber by tripling previous investments.
TRICARE, Military Pay, and Benefits - This bill rejects the
President's proposed cuts to military health benefits, commissaries,
and basic housing allowance, providing our veterans, war fighters, and
their families with the care and support they have earned. The
combination of these cuts could have resulted in thousands of dollars
of out-of-pocket costs for military families. The legislation has no
fundamental changes to the TRICARE benefit and it does not include the
request for military retirees to pay more for health care. Instead, it
keeps benefits the same and requires a complete analysis from the
Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission to
Congress before any changes can be made.
The FY15 NDAA next goes before the full House for a vote.
I am hopeful
these positive provisions will remain intact and move to the senate
soon.
Another major issue this week was the vote by the House on legislation
I co-sponsored to set up the House Select Committee on the Events
Surrounding the 2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi. The creation of this
panel reflects the seriousness of what happened in addition to the
Obama Administration's failure to work with Congress to tell the whole
story to the families of the four Americans who were killed on
September 11, 2012 and to all Americans who want to know the truth
about this act of terrorism.
In the more than 20 months since that terrible event at the U.S.
Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, the White House has deliberately and
consistently obstructed efforts by Congress to learn the truth about
the Obama Administration's reaction to this attack. And, recently
disclosed White House emails indicate the facts might have been
intentionally altered to create a false narrative of the tragic events.
It is time for the truth to come out. The American people will accept
nothing less.
On another matter, the House approved a resolution, this week, finding
former Internal Revenue Service (IRS) official Lois Lerner in contempt
of Congress for failing to tell the truth about IRS targeting of
conservative non-profit groups seeking tax-exempt status. The House
also passed a resolution calling on Attorney General Eric Holder to
appoint a special counsel to investigate the targeting of those
non-profit groups.
The truth about the targeting of conservative groups wishing to
exercise their First Amendment right to free speech has been covered up
since America first learned of this disgraceful act. Lois Lerner was at
the heart of this scandal and owes the American people answers. It is
time for her to come clean. If she is the one who ordered the
targeting, she must stand and accept responsibility for her actions. If
she knows of others who were responsible, she must stop covering up and
tell what she knows. The IRS must never be allowed to limit the free
speech rights of hardworking Americans.
Finally, this week marked a victory for religious freedom and
expression as the U.S. Supreme Court issued its historic ruling in a
case involving prayer at public meetings in cities and towns.
The town of Greece, New York, had traditionally opened its council
meetings with a prayer delivered by a volunteer from the community.
Plaintiffs filed suit, arguing the Constitution was violated as the
prayers were overwhelmingly Christian. A lower court agreed. However,
the Supreme Court ruled the prayers did NOT violate the Constitutional
prohibition against government establishment of religion - as NO ONE
was forced to participate - and ALL faiths were free to offer prayers.
This ruling is best summed up by David Cortman, senior counsel for the
Alliance Defending Freedom, which was involved in this landmark case:
"Opening public meetings with prayer is a cherished freedom that the
authors of the Constitution themselves practiced. Speech censors should
have no power to silence volunteers who pray for their communities just
as the Founders did."
Amen!
Have a great week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler

Dear
Friend,
This
was
a
busy
week
on
Capitol
Hill.
First
and
foremost,
my
House
Armed
Services
Committee
colleagues
and
I
approved
a
fiscal
year
2015
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
(NDAA)
which
included
several
provisions
I
worked
on
including
saving
the
A-10
&#8220;Warthog.&#8221;
I
remain
concerned
about
the
long-term
effects
of
cutting
our
force
levels
to
the
lowest
we
have
seen
since
World
War
II,
but
feel
the
bill
we
passed
takes
steps
to
address
a
scarcity
of
funding
while
still
making
sure
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
have
what
they
need
to
protect
our
nation.
This
legislation
does
well
to
provide
for
the
common
defense
while
keeping
in
mind
difficult
economic
realities.
Some
key
provisions
impacting
our
national
security
and
Missourians
include:
&#183;
A-10
&#8220;Warthog&#8221;
&#8211;
The
Department
of
Defense
proposed
the
divestment
of
the
A-10
airframe,
which
would create
a
critical
gap
in
the
Air
Force&#8217;s
close
air
support
capability
that
will
put
the
lives
of
our
ground
troops
at
risk. Simply
put,
the
A-10
is
the
nation&#8217;s
best
close
air
support
platform
and
has
proven
itself
time
and
time
again
in
combat. This
legislation
includes
an
amendment
that
I
co-sponsored,
that
will
fully
fund
the
maintenance,
operation,
and
upgrading
of
the
A-10
fleet
for
FY15,
providing
our
troops
the
vital
close
air
support
that
has
saved
numerous
American
lives.
&#183;
AH-64
&#8220;Apache&#8221;
Helicopter
&#8211;
Under
the
proposed
Army
Aviation
Restructuring
Initiative,
National
Guard
units
like
the
1-135 th
Attack/Reconnaissance
Battalion
at
Whiteman
Air
Force
Base
would
see
all
of
its
Apaches
transferred
to
active
duty
units.
I
co-sponsored
legislation
included
in
this
bill
that
would
prevent
this
initiative
and
keep
the
Apache
helicopters
with
these
highly
trained
units.
Congress
and
the
Army
have
invested
billions
of
dollars
training
the
National
Guard
to
be
interchangeable
with
the
Army;
this
legislation
will
allow
that
investment
to
pay
off.
&#183;
Base
Realignment
and
Closure
(BRAC)
-
At
a
time
when
the
final
force
structure
of
our
military
is
still
undecided,
it
makes
little
sense
to
approve
a
new
round
of
BRAC.
That
is
why
my
colleagues
and
I
rejected
the
President&#8217;s
request
for
another
round
of
BRAC.
As
a
member
of
the
Readiness
Subcommittee,
I
believe
that
the
Administration
needs
to
provide
detailed
information
on
its
proposed
savings
and
efficiencies
before
a
new
round
of
BRAC
is
considered.
&#183;
EA-18G
&#8220;Growler&#8221;
&#8211;
The
Navy
has
an
unfunded
requirement
for
airborne
electronic
attack
aircraft.
If
allowed
to
go
unfunded,
as
the
President&#8217;s
budget
suggests,
the
Navy
would
lose
its
only
airborne
electronic
attack
platform.
This
bill
includes
a
plan
I
proposed
to
provide
funding
to
keep
the
program
and
production
line
alive. The
Growler
is
the
nation&#8217;s
only
full
spectrum
tactical
airborne
electronic
attack
aircraft,
and
controlling
the
electromagnetic
spectrum
is
paramount
to
strike
capability
in
contested
environments.
This
funding
will
allow
the
St.
Louis
Boeing
plant
to
continue
the
F/A-18
production
line,
which
supports
60,000
jobs
and
accounts
for
$3
billion
in
economic
impact.
&#183;
Long-Range
Strike
Bomber
&#8211;
This
legislation
continues
funding
for
long-range
strike
bomber
research
and
development.
The
bill
invests
in
the
future
of
long-range
strike
capabilities
and
a
long-range
strike
bomber
by
tripling
previous
investments.
&#183;
TRICARE,
Military
Pay,
and
Benefits
&#8211;
This
bill
rejects
the
President&#8217;s
proposed
cuts
to
military
health
benefits,
commissaries,
and
basic
housing
allowance,
providing
our
veterans,
war
fighters,
and
their
families
with
the
care
and
support
they
have
earned.
The
combination
of
these
cuts
could
have
resulted
in
thousands
of
dollars
of
out-of-pocket
costs
for
military
families.
The
legislation
has
no
fundamental
changes
to
the
TRICARE
benefit
and
it
does
not
include
the
request
for
military
retirees
to
pay
more
for
health
care.
Instead,
it
keeps
benefits
the
same
and
requires
a
complete
analysis
from
the
Military
Compensation
and
Retirement
Modernization
Commission
to
Congress
before
any
changes
can
be
made.
The
FY15
NDAA
next
goes
before
the
full
House
for
a
vote.
I
am
hopeful
these
positive
provisions
will
remain
intact
and
move
to
the
senate
soon.
Another
major
issue
this
week
was
the
vote
by
the
House
on
legislation
I
co-sponsored
to
set
up
the
House
Select
Committee
on
the
Events
Surrounding
the
2012
Terrorist
Attack
in
Benghazi.
The
creation
of
this
panel
reflects
the
seriousness
of
what
happened
in
addition
to
the
Obama
Administration&#8217;s
failure
to
work
with
Congress
to
tell
the
whole
story
to
the
families
of
the
four
Americans
who
were
killed
on
September
11,
2012
and
to
all
Americans
who
want
to
know
the
truth
about
this
act
of
terrorism.
In
the
more
than
20
months
since
that
terrible
event
at
the
U.S.
Consulate
in
Benghazi,
Libya,
the
White
House
has
deliberately
and
consistently
obstructed
efforts
by
Congress
to
learn
the
truth
about
the
Obama
Administration&#8217;s
reaction
to
this
attack.
And,
recently
disclosed
White
House
emails
indicate
the
facts
might
have
been
intentionally
altered
to
create
a
false
narrative
of
the
tragic
events.
It
is
time
for
the
truth
to
come
out.
The
American
people
will
accept
nothing
less.
On
another
matter,
the
House
approved
a
resolution,
this
week,
finding
former
Internal
Revenue
Service
(IRS)
official
Lois
Lerner
in
contempt
of
Congress
for
failing
to
tell
the
truth
about
IRS
targeting
of
conservative
non-profit
groups
seeking
tax-exempt
status.
The
House
also
passed
a
resolution
calling
on
Attorney
General
Eric
Holder
to
appoint
a
special
counsel
to
investigate
the
targeting
of
those
non-profit
groups.
The
truth
about
the
targeting
of
conservative
groups
wishing
to
exercise
their
First
Amendment
right
to
free
speech
has
been
covered
up
since
America
first
learned
of
this
disgraceful
act.
Lois
Lerner
was
at
the
heart
of
this
scandal
and
owes
the
American
people
answers.
It
is
time
for
her
to
come
clean.
If
she
is
the
one
who
ordered
the
targeting,
she
must
stand
and
accept
responsibility
for
her
actions.
If
she
knows
of
others
who
were
responsible,
she
must
stop
covering
up
and
tell
what
she
knows.
The
IRS
must
never
be
allowed
to
limit
the
free
speech
rights
of
hardworking
Americans.
Finally,
this
week
marked
a
victory
for
religious
freedom
and
expression
as
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
issued
its
historic
ruling
in
a
case
involving
prayer
at
public
meetings
in
cities
and
towns.
The
town
of
Greece,
New
York,
had
traditionally
opened
its
council
meetings
with
a
prayer
delivered
by
a
volunteer
from
the
community.
Plaintiffs
filed
suit,
arguing
the
Constitution
was
violated
as
the
prayers
were
overwhelmingly
Christian.
A
lower
court
agreed.
However,
the
Supreme
Court
ruled
the
prayers
did
NOT
violate
the
Constitutional
prohibition
against
government
establishment
of
religion
&#8211;
as
NO
ONE
was
forced
to
participate
&#8211;
and
ALL
faiths
were
free
to
offer
prayers.
This
ruling
is
best
summed
up
by
David
Cortman,
senior
counsel
for
the
Alliance
Defending
Freedom,
which
was
involved
in
this
landmark
case:
&#8220;Opening
public
meetings
with
prayer
is
a
cherished
freedom
that
the
authors
of
the
Constitution
themselves
practiced.
Speech
censors
should
have
no
power
to
silence
volunteers
who
pray
for
their
communities
just
as
the
Founders
did.&#8221;
Amen!
Have
a
great
week.
