As a Senator, President Obama was a fierce critic of executive overreach, stating in 2008:
One of the most important jobs of the Supreme Court is to guard against the encroachment of the Executive Branch on the power of the other branches.
And, I think [the Chief Justice] has been a little bit too willing and eager to give an administration, whether its mine or George Bushs, more power than I think the Constitution originally intended.
Whats changed? Last week the week the House passed H.R. 4138 the ENFORCE the Law Act, which gives Congress the authority to defend the legislative branch of as the Framers and our fellow citizens would expect.
