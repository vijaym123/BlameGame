Wisdom of the District: Ammunition Ban
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) recently proposed a regulation that would ban the manufacture and sale of 5.56 mm/.223 caliber M855 green tip, a popular ammunition used in the AR-15 for hunting and target shooting.
More than 230 members of the House of Representatives, including Representative Rigell, are sending a letter to the Director of the ATF protesting the new regulation.
