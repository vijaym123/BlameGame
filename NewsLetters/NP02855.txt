Friend ,
Thank you for standing together to keep our communities healthy.
I appreciate your attentiveness to this issue.
Though this is being debated in the public forum, the science is clear-- vaccines save lives.
And, over the last week,
more than 800 people signed in support of protecting our children through the use of vaccinations.
Your thoughts on this matter are valued, and your voice was strong: this is a serious issue and pubic health is a priority.
Thank you for sharing your stories and engaging with our campaign.
Be well,
Ami
