Due to technical issues I was
unable to send this email over
the weekend. I hope you'll take a few moments to read my Father's Day
message.
Dear Friend,
As I did with Mother's Day,
I thought I'd take a break from updating
you on my work in Congress to recognize and wish a very happy Father's
Day to all the dads who get my eNewsletter.
As a father of three, I know well the trials, tribulations, and
triumphs of being a dad. I still remember the thrilling yet terrifying
feeling that hit me when "I am a father" sunk in. No matter what type
of job you've had in the past, have now, or may have in the future,
there is no job that comes with the kind of responsibility of being a
father. I've been fortunate in my life to have some interesting jobs
that have come with pretty big responsibilities. But none of them
compare to the sense of responsibility I feel to be a good father to my
three children and a good husband to my wife. I have always felt that
if I could do what is right by them, the rest will fall into place.
My own dad has been one of the greatest guiding forces in my life. He
taught me lessons in perseverance, fortitude, and work ethic. When I
was struggling with school, especially the demands of medical school,
he believed in me that I would get it done. When I was considering
entering public life, he believed in me that I would be successful. And
when I was ready to face the challenges that come with being a father,
I believed that he had shown me the way to meet them.
I know all of you dads are passing down lessons that are just as
important to your children. And believe me, no matter what they may say
or think today, they will be better for it.
So, dads, I thank you for all you do to make our families stronger and
our communities better places to live. Happy Father's Day.
Sincerely,
DR. JOE HECK
Member of Congress

Due
to
technical
issues I
was
unable
to send
this
email
over
the
weekend.
I
hope
you'll
take
a
few
moments
to
read
my
Father's
Day
message.
Dear
Friend,
As
I
did
with
Mother's
Day,
I
thought
I'd
take
a
break
from
updating
you
on
my
work
in
Congress
to
recognize
and
wish
a
very
happy
Father's
Day
to
all
the
dads
who
get
my
eNewsletter.
As
a
father
of
three,
I
know
well
the
trials,
tribulations,
and
triumphs
of
being
a
dad.
I
still
remember
the
thrilling
yet
terrifying
feeling
that
hit
me
when
"I
am
a
father"
sunk
in.
No
matter
what
type
of
job
you've
had
in
the
past,
have
now,
or
may
have
in
the
future,
there
is
no
job
that
comes
with
the
kind
of
responsibility
of
being
a
father.
I've
been
fortunate
in
my
life
to
have
some
interesting
jobs
that
have
come
with
pretty
big
responsibilities.
But
none
of
them
compare
to
the
sense
of
responsibility
I
feel
to
be
a
good
father
to
my
three
children
and
a
good
husband
to
my
wife.
I
have
always
felt
that
if
I
could
do
what
is
right
by
them,
the
rest
will
fall
into
place.
My
own
dad
has
been
one
of
the
greatest
guiding
forces
in
my
life.
He
taught
me
lessons
in
perseverance,
fortitude,
and
work
ethic.
When
I
was
struggling
with
school,
especially
the
demands
of
medical
school,
he
believed
in
me
that
I
would
get
it
done.
When
I
was
considering
entering
public
life,
he
believed
in
me
that
I
would
be
successful.
And
when
I
was
ready
to
face
the
challenges
that
come
with
being
a
father,
I
believed
that
he
had
shown
me
the
way
to
meet
them.
I
know
all
of
you
dads
are
passing
down
lessons
that
are
just
as
important
to
your
children.
And
believe
me,
no
matter
what
they
may
say
or
think
today,
they
will
be
better
for
it.
So,
dads,
I
thank
you
for
all
you
do
to
make
our
families
stronger
and
our
communities
better
places
to
live.
Happy
Father's
Day.
Sincerely,
DR.
