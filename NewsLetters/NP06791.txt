President Obama and our staff at Democratic Headquarters have sent you a lot of emails.
But we don't want you to get the wrong idea...
What you've already done is truly historic: $5 and $35 at a time, you've built a record-breaking grassroots movement. So thank you. You make our campaigns possible.
So why all the emails?
To be blunt, we're getting trounced on the airwaves. And it's getting worse. If we can't fight Karl Rove's Obama-bashing ad blitz now, we will lose everything we've built together.
