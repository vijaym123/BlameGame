Happy Holidays!
As we come together as friends
and family during this holiday season, may we
all take a moment to express appreciation for
the blessings that surround us; and the
freedoms we hold dear.
In keeping with the spirit of
love and celebration, I want to express my
gratitude to the people of Utah who have
entrusted me to represent them in our
nations capital during these
challenging times. I also want to pay tribute
to the men and women in our nations
military who sacrifice greatly
so
that we can remain free.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower
once said: freedom has its life in the
hearts, the actions, and the spirit of men
and so it must be daily earned and refreshed
else like a flower cut from its
life-giving roots, it will wither and
die.
One of the greatest privileges
I have as a Senator is to meet with brave
Utahns who choose to put on the uniform of
our country and defend our freedoms. These
soldiers inspire me with their willingness to
sacrifice and incredible spirit to
serve.
The Son, whose birth we
celebrate this season, was the supreme
messenger of peace. He instilled goodness in
the hearts and minds of those who sought for
truth, and inspired freedom through good
works and charity.
His ministry has continued to
cultivate peace and hope, particularly at
this time of year when all stop for a moment
to reflect and celebrate.
Christmas is more than a day;
it is a season of forgiveness, a desire for
peace, and a celebration of new hope. As we
leave 2013 and enter into a new year
it is my desire that we might all feel a
renewed desire to respect each other, to
forgive others, and honor those who sacrifice
for our continued freedom and joy.
So as the Christmas bells ring
in the day, may they peal in tribute to our
nation and the goodness of its people. And,
may the spirit of the season fill your souls;
and bring peace and a renewed hope for the
future ahead.
Elaine and I want to send our
very best wishes to you for a Merry Christmas
and a Joyous New Year!
