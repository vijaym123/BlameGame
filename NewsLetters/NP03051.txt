Dear Friend,
On Monday, I
hosted a Telephone Townhall with Northeast Georgians. I'd been looking
forward to telling you all about the new Congress, where I've
introduced bills to defund the President's unconstitutional amnesty, help
independent and community pharmacists cope with complex federal drug
programs, and extend care to military moms at VA hospitals -- to name just
a few of my efforts to bring Ninth District values to the
capital.
That's what I heard on our call,
when your most pressing questions concerned President Obama's power grabs
and soft approach to national security. You want the freedom to work
and save for your families. You want jobs and income, not more
government programs. But where government
should
act, you want it
done right.
I was struck by your kindness
and strength of conviction, fuel for my fire in Congress. I've helped
to pass conservative bills that cut federal spending and taxpayer
funding
for abortion. Our youngest should enjoy the
same inalienable rights and liberty we do.

Those ideas are less common in Washington, D.C. than in our
proud, patriotic Ninth District. So I was glad for every call on Monday
and especially to get back home to give my constituents the latest news
in person. Right now, my House colleagues and I are working to repeal
and replace Obamacare with true health care reform that increases
choice and lowers cost.

all.
