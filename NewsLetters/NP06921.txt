Dear Friend,
In todays technological world, threats to our personal identity and businesses are around every corner. In 2013, there was a 62 percent increase in the number of data breaches, costing hardworking Americans almost $113 billion. The good news, though, is that awareness and preventive steps can go a long way in protecting yourself and your business.
Please join me for an informational cybersecurity seminar I am hosting in conjunction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Findlays CentraComm tomorrow from 9:30 a.m.
12:30 p.m. at the Defiance College Schomberg Auditorium, located at 701 North Clinton Street, Defiance, Ohio 43512.
The event, which is free and open to the public, will include presentations that provide measures to prevent theft of intellectual property, phishing and spear phishing, social network attacks, mobile device attacks, and data leakage.
Residents do not need to RSVP to attend, but should contact my District Office at 1 (800) 541-6446 if they have any questions.
As your Representative, I am committed to helping Ohio's Fifth Congressional District residents better protect themselves against cyber threats, and I hope to see you at tomorrow's event.
Sincerely,
Congressman Bob Latta
