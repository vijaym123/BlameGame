Dear
friend,
One of the best ways I can represent you in Congress is to
know your views on the most important issues facing Idaho and America.
There are many issues before Congress, including the economy, the
budget, the debt ceiling, and the implementation of the new health care
law.
Please take my official 2014 congressional
questionnaire so your voice can be heard.
Thank you in advance. It's
an honor to represent you in Congress.
1. I believe growing the economy is the most important issue
facing our country. What do you think is the most important
issue? Economy National Debt Healthcare Homeland Security Immigration Energy Moral Values Other/Unsure 2. I believe the best way to grow the
economy is to get government out of the way so that families, businesses,
and individuals can prosper. What do you think is the best way to
grow the economy? Get government out of the way. Government investment in key industries and a strong
safety net. Other/Unsure 3.
I voted against a bill to raise the debt ceiling because it did not
include cuts to government spending. The debt ceiling will be back on
February 7. What should we do? Raise the debt ceiling without any
conditions. Raise the debt ceiling,
but only if it contains spending cuts. Don't raise the debt ceiling. Other/Unsure 4. I voted to repeal the
Affordable Care Act because it has forced millions of Americans to lose
their health coverage, while forcing millions of others to pay higher
premiums. What should we do now? Keep the law the way it is. Reform the law to make it work
better. Repeal the entire
law and replace it with a market-driven health care
system. Other/Unsure 5. I believe the NSA's
surveillance of the American people has gone too far. The NSA should
not be allowed to collect our phone and computer records unless they
have a warrant. What do you think we should do? Curtail the NSA's surveillance
programs. Let the NSA's
surveillance programs continue. Other/Unsure *By answering this survey, you are
