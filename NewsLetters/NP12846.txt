3RD DISTRICT
ISSUES &amp; LEGISLATION
NEWSROOM
January 24, 2014
This was a district
work week, and I was able to take full advantage of my time by visiting
all four corners of the Third District.
Heres a recap of my
travels:
Monday
Refle cted on the words, courage
and sacrifice of Martin Luther King,
Jr.
Tuesday
Fort
Smith
My day in Fort
Smith began with a visit by Fort Smith Regional Airport Director John
Parker and Fort Smith Airport Commission Chairman Scott Archer.
Fort Smith has a fantastic regional airport that serves the River Valley
well, due in no small measure to the leadership of these two
men.
I then had the opportunity to meet with the administrative
team at OK Foods
one of the largest employers in the River Valley area
before speaking at the Fort Smith Southside Rotary.
As a
former Rotarian and Paul Harris Fellow, it was an honor to serve as a
judge in the Four-Way Test Scholarship Contest.
The day concluded
with the opportunity to receive an update from the Fort Smith Regional
Healthcare Foundation about their interest to open a new osteopathic
center in Fort Smith to train
physicians.
Wednesday
Marion
County
I had the pleasure of being joined by State Senator Johnny
Key and State Representative Kelley Linck for visits to two Flippin
schools.
At Flippin Elementary School, I presented a U.S. flag to
students and spoke about its symbolism while Rep. Linck did the same
with the Arkansas state flag.
At Flippin High School, I had the
opportunity to speak with students participating in a business program
and meet the teacher who started it.
After a visit
with Bull Shoals Rotarians, I met with Bull Shoals city leaders.
They have a significant need to replace the citys existing wastewater
treatment plant, and I appreciated the opportunity to view it in
person.
The city is working on a plan to make that happen, and they
have my support with the project.
The day concluded with a visit
to Yellvilles elementary school where Rep. Linck and I once again
made flag presentations.
Thursday
Pope
County
My day began in Russellville visiting St.
Marys Regional Medical Center administrators at their new Millard Henry
Clinic.
It was followed by a tour of Aqua Contour Cutting,
Inc., where I had the opportunity to view their waterjet and laser
cutting operation.
Then it was off to ConAgra Foods.
ConAgra
has been in Russellville since 1965, and I enjoyed the opportunity to
tour the plant.
The day concluded with visits north of
Russellville.
First, I had a chance to speak to the 9th grade civics class
at Hector High School.
I then had the opportunity to meet with
community and business leaders in Dover for a roundtable
discussion.
Friday
Springdale
As the week concluded, I was able to spend Friday afternoon in
Springdale.
I first met with Bill and Walter Mathews, the management
team behind McDonald's of Northwest Arkansas.
Then, I had a great
visit with local entrepreneur James Smith when I stopped by his
business, James+James, where they make handmade furniture.
The day
concluded with a meeting of civic and business leaders pulled together by
the Springdale Chamber of Commerce.
It is a privilege to
represent a district so full of life and activity.
Next week, its
back to Washington, D.C., as Congress
reconvenes.
