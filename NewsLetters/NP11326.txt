Secretary Kerry testifies to Appropriations
Committee about Foreign Policy
The State and Foreign
Operations Appropriations Subcommittee held a hearing last week in which
Secretary of State John Kerry testified. During his testimony,
Secretary Kerry asked for $46 Billion to fund his foreign policy efforts next
year. I share the concerns of many Americans who feel that our country
is backing away from Ronald Reagan's policy of peace through strength
and adopting a policy of retreat. It was with those concerns in mind
that I asked Secretary Kerry what this administration's overall
foreign policy is, and how it can be more effective with stemming the
influence and rise of Russia and threats to peace and security through a
nuclear armed Iran.

response.
Receiving U.S. Chamber Spirit of Enterprise
Award
Last week, I received an award from the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce in recognition of my consistent support of pro-jobs and
pro-growth policies during the first session of the 113th Congress. Members
who support the Chambers position on at least 70% of those votes
qualify to receive the award. I'm proud to have received an 85% rating
with the Chamber in 2013 and have a cumulative rating of 90% during my
tenure in Congress. That ties me for highest cumulative score in the
Kansas Congressional delegation.
Our economy is still not growing fast enough to keep pace with
the number of Americans who want to get to work. Im proud to receive
this award from the U.S. Chamber because it represents my focus on
helping small businesses and entrepreneurs recognize and achieve their
American Dream. Ill continue my efforts to help the Kansas economy
grow.

Secretary of Agriculture Vilsack
With record setting
deficits over the past few years, Congress has worked diligently to
reduce spending in agriculture and food policy, making reforms to many
programs including the elimination of direct payments to farmers and
closing a loophole that allowed people to get food stamps (SNAP) that
didn't qualify. The farm bill that passed the House recently contained a
7% reduction to agriculture support to Kansas farmers and yet only a
savings of 1% in SNAP benefits. 80% of the farm bill is food stamp or
SNAP benefits.
After this lopsided
compromise was passed,
many
news agencies are now reporting
that even the small
savings to be achieved in food stamps by closing the loophole will not
mature after all. To ensure that we use our scarce resources on those who
need our help the most, we must close the loopholes that allow people
who don't qualify for government subsidies to continue to receive
them. This week I pressed Secretary Vilsack on what our government can do
to reduce the fraud and abuse of the
system.

here , or on either of the images above, to hear my questions to
Secretary
Vilsack, as well as his
response.
In addition, I also
questioned Secretary Vilsack about an issue that is troubling to many
Kansas farmers. Fish and Wildlife Services is about to issue a ruling on
the endangered species status of the Lesser Prairie Chicken. This
decision will greatly impact Kansas farmers, especially those in western
and southern Kansas, and particularly those participating in
Conservation Reserve Programs
(CRP).

listen to my questions to Secretary Vilsack, as well as his
response.
These are important issues
to the Kansas agriculture community and I appreciated hearing from
Sec. Vilsack as I continue meeting with agriculture groups from
Kansas. I want to thank Secretary Vilsack for testifying last
week.
