Recognizing
the Sacrifice of our Nations
Veterans
Dear Friend,
This past week, as our nation came
together on Veterans Day to honor those who
have served our country, I had the honor of
traveling across the Fifth District and
talking with many of Virginias brave
veterans. At Hampden Sydney Colleges
16th Annual Veterans Day Ceremony, I spoke
with Longwood and Hampden Sydneys
ROTC cadets, members of Charlotte County
American Legion Post 260, and other Fifth
District Virginians to commemorate the
great sacrifices of all our nations
veterans. On Tuesday, I was honored to
participate in American Legion Post
74s Veterans Day Ceremony in
Charlottesville and pay tribute to all of
the veterans who attended, including three
D-Day veterans.
As we take time to reflect on the
liberties we all hold so dear, it is
important to remember that it was our
veterans, throughout the generations, who
fought to preserve our way of life.
Throughout American history, our soldiers
have courageously fought to preserve our
freedoms, and for that, we will be forever
grateful. Their sacrifices, and the
sacrifices of their families, have allowed
us to enjoy a way of life we often take for
granted.
As we work to address our nations
challenges, we do so with their sacrifices
in mind and also the duty that we owe them
for their service and sacrifice.
Unfortunately, we learned earlier this year
that the promise we made to care for our
veterans has, in many instances, not been
kept. To address several of the issues
related to the Department of Veterans
Administrations (VA) failure to care
for our veterans, in August, the President
signed the
Veterans
Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of
2014
into law to address structural
problems within the VA. This was an
important first step, but I, along with my
colleagues in the House, have continued our
work to ensure that our bravest citizens
receive the care they have earned and
deserve.
This fall, the House also passed the
VA
Construction Assistance Act
to address
the VAs failures regarding
construction of major medical centers, and
require the VA to implement important
construction reforms for major medical
facilities. The House also passed the
Veterans
Traumatic Brain Injury Improvement Act
to ensure the success and transparency of a
critical program involving assisted living
services for veterans with traumatic brain
injury (TBI). These are vital reforms aimed
at correcting the national shame that
thousands of our nations veterans
have suffered due to the gross
mismanagement at the VA, and I urge my
colleagues in the Senate to consider these
good bills. I will continue to work with my
colleagues to ensure that our veterans
receive the medical care they have earned
and deserve.
We have also looked for other ways to
improve the treatment our veterans receive.
As part of the Jobs for America Act, the
House passed the
Hire
More Heroes Act , which incentivizes
businesses to hire veterans by excluding
them from the Presidents healthcare
laws employer mandate threshold. In
September, the President signed the
Veterans
Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment
Act
into law, which directs the
Secretary of Veterans Affairs to increase
the rates of veterans disability
compensation, additional compensation for
dependents, and compensation for surviving
spouses and children. I was proud to
support all of these measures, and I remain
fully committed to ensuring that our
citizens who have given the most receive
the benefits they have earned and
deserve.
I am humbled by the opportunity to serve
Virginias Fifth District veterans,
and I hope that you will join with me in
continuing to thank all of those who have
and continue to serve this great
nation.
