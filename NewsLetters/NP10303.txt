Good evening--
Yesterdays severe weather devastated many communities across our state, including areas of Lee, Rankin, and Winston counties.
Sidney and I grieve for the families who have lost loved ones. Mississippi families continue to mourn with those who directly experienced this tragic loss of life and property and extensive damage to homes and businesses.
We owe our first responders and local officials a great deal of gratitude. Our brave leaders at the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, the Mississippi National Guard, and the Mississippi State Department of Health
along with the University of Mississippi Medical Centers MEDCOM unit
have demonstrated enormous courage in quickly dispatching area response coordinators and medical teams to care for folks who were injured.
If you or your neighbors need immediate assistance, I urge you to visit MEMAs website
www.msema.org . They have already established shelters at the following locations:
Columbus : Southside Baptist Church, 100 Nashville Ferry Road East
Louisville : First Methodist Church, 300 W. Main Street
Louisville : First Baptist Church, 305 S. Church Avenue
Pearl : Pearl Community Center, 2420 Old Brandon Road
Tupelo : BancorpSouth Building, 375 E. Main Street
My staff and I have begun coordinating with federal, state, and local officials who are organizing disaster assistance efforts. And while the rebuilding and the healing of our communities will continue for months and years to come, I will not rest until we do everything in our power to help restore the lives that were so tragically disrupted in yesterdays storms.
God Bless,
