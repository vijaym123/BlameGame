Inviting Instability
When hes leading from behind, President Obamas foreign policy has
done tremendous harm to Americas credibility. It has given our enemies
and our allies reasons to question this administrations ability to
react competently to the instability and violence spreading across many
parts of the world today. Taken alone, that would be enough to feed
the American peoples concern and
consternation.
But this administration has gone even further to
alienate Americas allies. This past week it was reported that a member of
the Obama administration used foul language to directly insult
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Expressing this kind of open
hostility toward Israel
our greatest ally in the Middle East
will do
nothing to help quell the violence or restore order in that part of the
world. We ought to be cultivating stronger relationships with those
who share our values, not insulting
them.
The presidents failing foreign policy is having remarkably
dangerous consequences. We are seeing how the world can become more
chaotic when America fails to lead.
#TimeforChoosing
This past Monday marked the
50 th
anniversary of Ronald Reagans
A Time for
Choosing
speech. With the tremendous economic and foreign policy
challenges facing America today, it is important to revisit Reagans words.
They offer wise counsel as we work toward positive solutions that will
help strengthen and secure our communities and our nation. I encourage
you to take a few moments to watch his speech, by
