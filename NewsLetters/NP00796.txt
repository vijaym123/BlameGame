Friend,
Today, I wanted to drop you a note as a very proud father.
This evening, Janine and I will watch our daughter graduate from high school.
The foundation of the American dream is rooted in a strong education.
Having access to a world class education is the driving force of my own story-- I attended public schools from kindergarten through medical school, graduated with less than $10,000 in debt, and was given the practical background to be successful in my career.
Having that opportunity set the course for the rest of my life.
I worked hard to get where I am today, but it was made possible because of the investment this country made in my future in the form of a strong educational system.
Now, we must make sure that future generations are given the same opportunity and that education remains a top priority in our communities and our nation.
Congratulations to the Class of 2015.
My generation&#39;s legacy will be measured in the success of your generation.
Go make us proud.
Be well,
Ami
