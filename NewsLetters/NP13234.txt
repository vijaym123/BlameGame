The Webster Wire
Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Despite the arctic weather that permeated the eastern seaboard last week, we had good news in our congressional district. Another of our outstanding high school students was accepted by the U.S. Naval Academy. It was not only a privilege to nominate Patrick McMahan, but also to congratulate him, his family, his friends, and the leadership and teachers at Bishop Moore Catholic High School.

Last weekend, I was on Channel 13s Political Connections show with Ybeth Bruzua, where we discussed the budget process, the importance of cutting waste in Washington, Obamacare and the economy, constituent services, and several other key issues. You can access
segments of the interview on my website here.

Last Wednesday, JoAnn Newman, the President and CEO of Orlando Science Center, and Kellen Nixon, the Director of Educational Development, came by my office while in Washington to discuss their initiatives supporting STEM programs. I have had the privilege of joining the Orlando Science Center at some of their local events, and enjoyed hearing an update on the progress and vision they have of encouraging the next generation to pursue science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

Also on Wednesday, I sat down with the Florida Hospital Association, including a representative from Baycare Hospital in Winter Haven, which is located in our district.
We discussed the importance of renewing our states federal Medicaid waiver that allows the State of Florida to continue to offer true cost saving flexibility in our Medicaid program, enabling Florida to best match health care services with the needs of our citizens.
Dr. Debashish Bose from Orlando Health also met with me last Thursday. Dr. Bose is the Director for the Gastrointestinal Malignancies Section of the Pancreas Center at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Orlando. I appreciated hearing the update on Orlando Healths new partnership with the cancer research scientists at the University of Florida and the great success they are experiencing in pancreatic cancer treatment
Your servant,

Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
After meeting one of our Community Relations Representatives, a constituent contacted our office about her recent denial
of disability benefits from the Social Security Administration (SSA).
We submitted a Congressional Inquiry requesting additional review of the constituents case. After careful review, the constituent was deemed disabled, and received her first benefit check last month.
Constituent Services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
Do you believe the federal government should be required to promptly inform citizens when their private information such as their Social Security number or medical history is stolen by internet hackers?

Legislative Update:
During the holiday season, news broke that hackers had compromised the security of millions of customers from a major American retail store. Fortunately, the retailer immediately alerted their customers, giving them the opportunity to monitor their credit cards and make any personal changes they deemed necessary to protect their finances.
Rather than mandating the same accountability for themselves, the Department of Health and Human Services has refused to commit to promptly notifying Obamacare enrollees if their personal information has been compromised. From the beginning, the Obamacare online health exchange has been a catastrophe and Americans deserve to know without undue delay if their personal data is at risk.
Our government should not have the option to disclose breaches or hide them from the public based on an undefined determination or convenience, especially when participation in the program is mandatory for many Americans and there isnt an option to simply shop somewhere else.
