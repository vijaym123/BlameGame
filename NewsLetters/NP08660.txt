Friends,
As a Marine veteran of the Persian Gulf War and a member of the Mississippi National Guard, one of my top priorities is ensuring South Mississippi veterans receive the best service possible.
Our veterans have been subjected to careless and shameful treatment at the hands of the very government they fought to protect. In the House, we've taken action to address some of these systemic problems within the Department of Veterans Affairs. I'm also specifically focused on improving the service our veterans receive at local VA facilities in South Mississippi.
That's why I'm inviting veterans and their loved ones to join me for the following upcoming events.
