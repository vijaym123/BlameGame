I&rsquo;m emailing you again because it&rsquo;s the single most important day of the entire election. The last-ever end-of-month fundraising deadline strikes at midnight tonight -- and it will decide everything.
Friend -- I&rsquo;m emailing you again because it&rsquo;s the single most important day of the entire election. The last-ever end-of-month fundraising deadline strikes at midnight tonight -- and it will decide everything.
And this is major news:
The DSCC could hit a record $1 MILLION in grassroots contributions today for the first time EVER.
That&rsquo;s astounding -- it would SHATTER every record in history!
If we hit $1 million by the deadline in just four hours, we&rsquo;ll be able to plug the $170,023 hole in our Final Weekend Get Out The Vote Push budget!
We&rsquo;ll send that money immediately to deadlocked battlegrounds, WIN this election, and keep the Senate safe from Tea Party extremists!
Will you pitch in to help us meet our CRITICAL $1 million single-day goal and WIN the Senate? We&rsquo;ll triple-match your gift!
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
I have a good feeling about today.
Thanks,
Harry Reid
Senate Majority Leader
