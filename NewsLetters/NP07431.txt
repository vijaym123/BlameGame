$1,064,781
and counting has come in to Democratic Headquarters since President Obama sent you his call to action yesterday.
That&rsquo;s
$1,064,781
to fight back against Boehner&rsquo;s lawsuit. That&rsquo;s
$1,064,781
to defend President Obama. That&rsquo;s
$1,064,781
to fire Boehner&rsquo;s Republicans this November.
So many of you have stepped up (over 50,000!), and we couldn&rsquo;t be more thankful. But there&rsquo;s one man who this really upsets:
Now, Boehner is planning to sue the President TOMORROW. There&rsquo;s never been a more important time to defend President Obama. There&rsquo;s never been a better reason to defeat John Boehner&rsquo;s Republicans this November.
