Recently, the Washington Examiner published an
article
that talks about my fight to stop the federal government from collecting sensitive personal financial information from you and your family. The
article
reveals that up to 227 million Americans may be required to disclose their personal financial information for a federal database established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The database will include information such as: a mortgage owners name, address, Social Security number, all credit card and other loan information and account balances. I sent a letter with Senator Mike Crapo (R-ID) to the FHFA and CFPB stating that this represents an unwarranted intrusion into the private lives of ordinary Americans. I would like to hear your thoughts about this. Please complete this brief
survey
to express your views about this intrusion into citizens privacy by unelected government bureaucrats in Washington.
Yours respectfully,
