Remembering MLK's legacy
Dear Friend:
This past Monday, Michiganders and folks across the country paused to observe and reflect on the life and legacy of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
Weve hit some important milestones recently. Last year was the 50 th
Anniversary of the Civil Rights Act that made segregation illegal. This spring will mark the 50 th
Anniversary of the fateful marches from Selma to Montgomery. And next year, well celebrate the 50 th
Anniversary of the Voting Rights Act that prohibited racial discrimination in voting.
While I am proud to recognize these steps for equality that occurred half a century ago, I know challenges remain.
I attribute one of my all-time favorite quotes to Ralph Waldo Emerson.
He said,
Do not follow where the path may lead.
Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.
I try to follow this guidance with the decisions I make and in my role as a civic leader. Put simply: I try to do what is right,
not
what is easy.
Every day I work to forge a path that will leave behind a worthy legacy. And every day, I consciously work to avoid the route of accepting the status quo.
We have had a tumultuous year, but I hope that we will all remember Dr. Kings message of peace and nonviolence. As Americas new Congress gets underway and we begin the task of governing, now more than ever its important to remember Dr. Kings words: The time is always to do what is right.
God bless,
Fred Upton
