Dear Friend,
Elections are about people, which is why Ed has always built his campaigns around the people he serves.
Last year, we proved the power of grassroots organizing by sending Ed to the Senate. Everything we did in last year&rsquo;s campaign -- phone banking, door knocking, spreading Ed&rsquo;s message -- was fueled by grassroots energy from people like you. This year, we need your help again. We won in 2013 by setting -- and hitting -- our goals. And this month, we need your help to reach our $36,000 goal before the FEC filing deadline -- can you kick in $5?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Ed&rsquo;s fighting for us in Washington. We need you to give his campaign the resources it needs to win this November. Every goal from now until election day is critical -- please contribute $5, $10, or more.
Thanks for your help.
Colleen
