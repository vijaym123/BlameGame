Thune: Going After Traffickers Must Be a Priority
VIDEO:
Watch
Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) discuss the horrors of human trafficking and
highlight the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, which will
strengthen law enforcements anti-trafficking efforts and help trafficking
victims.
Today, Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) took to the senate floor
to urge his colleagues to pass the Justice for Victims of Trafficking
Act (S. 178), of which Thune is a co-sponsor. This is an important
piece of legislation necessary to strengthen U.S. efforts to eradicate
trafficking and help victims.
The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act would give law
enforcement additional resources to target traffickers and focus on
providing assistance to victims as they seek to regain their lives. If
enacted, the bill would create a domestic trafficking victims fund to
increase federal support available to trafficking victims. This legislation
would also create a new grant program to help state and local
governments develop and implement victim-centered
programs.
Sen. Thune believes the sooner the senate is
able to pass this legislation to get these tools into the hands of law
enforcement, the better. He is hopeful that this legislation will help
advance the fight against trafficking in America and help promote the
healing of human trafficking
victims.
