Thank you for reading The Conaway Chronicle, a review of my activities in Congress.
Introducing Legislation to stop Operation Choke Point
This week, I and nine of my colleagues introduced a bill that would shut down the President's Operation Choke Point. This bill, The Firearms Manufacturers and Dealers Protection Act, stops all funding for Operation Choke Point and prevents any other similar program from being put in place. The President's war against our second amendment rights must be stopped.
National Ag Day
On Wednesday, I met with Texas Future Farmer of America Officers, Zach and Katie, at a National Agriculture Day event. I really enjoyed talking to them about their work on behalf of the National FFA Organization to develop leaders through agricultural education.
I also wrote a column for the San Angelo Standard times discussing the importance of Texas' farmers and ranchers. To read the column, please

The Granbury Opera House
The Granbury Opera House first opened its doors in 1886 as one of the top performance destinations in the area. It closed in 1911, but was renovated and reopened in 1975 as the Opera House we all know it as today. Just a few years back, the Opera House underwent another series of renovations, including adding more seats, a brand new lobby, and building additional room backstage for rehearsals, set construction, and costume design. Below is a picture taken inside the Opera House just after the renovations were completed. The restoration project didn't go unnoticed, either. Last year, the Texas Downtown Association awarded the Opera House with the "Best Renovation/Rehabilitation" award. Granbury, Texas is lucky to have such a great space for the arts.
