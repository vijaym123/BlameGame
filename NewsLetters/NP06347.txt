There&rsquo;s nothing left to say.
We&rsquo;ve already told you how the Koch Brothers&rsquo; spending has been crushing Democrats all year.
We&rsquo;ve already told you we don&rsquo;t have the resources we need to fight back.
We&rsquo;ve already told you that our biggest deadline of the election hits in 24 hours. David, what else can we say?
If we want to win, we can&rsquo;t afford to fail ONCE between now and election day. And right now, we&rsquo;re dangerously close to failing.
We still need 13,658 more donations in the next 24 hours if we want any shot at giving President Obama a Democratic House for his final two years.
David Johnson Suggested Support: $5.OO
We're pleading, David. Can you step up for the President right now?
