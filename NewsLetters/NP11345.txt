Friend,
Our grassroots effort is officially underway.
I can&#39;t tell you how much it means to me that so many of you supported our office opening. You stepped up in a big way, and I&#39;m grateful.

My team has already told you how important our volunteers are going to be to this campaign, but let me say it again - they are vital. The only way to win this election is to engage with our community voter by voter, and that&#39;s what we plan to do. Because of your help, we can begin that effort now.
Now let&#39;s get out there and win this thing.
Thanks again - and I hope you enjoy the pictures!
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
