The State of Our Opportunity
For
generations of Americans, a sense of opportunity has long defined the
promise of our nation.
This
opportunity to succeed embodies the
American Dream.
However, in recent years, a growing federal government
and weak economy have threatened
this opportunity.
Just a few days ago,
Members of Congress gathered in the House Chamber to hear President
Obama deliver his State of the
Union address.
While I listened to the
speech with hope that I would hear a new, viable plan for job creation
and economic growth, I was
disheartened that, yet again, I heard many of
the same failed promises.
I was also alarmed by
the President&rsquo;s brazen announcement that he intends to act on his own
where he
cannot work with Congress.
The Constitution does not confer
upon the President the &ldquo;executive authority&rdquo; to disregard the
separation
of powers by unilaterally waiving, suspending, or revising the laws.
Circumventing Congress, the people&rsquo;s branch, to enact
his bad policies
is completely unacceptable.
I will continue to pay very close attention
to any executive actions and will continue my efforts
as Chairman of
the House Judiciary Committee to conduct strong oversight of what he
does, and does not do, as President. I remain committed to
enacting policies that would
advance prosperity for families and
businesses.
This is the Administration&rsquo;s chance to work
with
Congress
to
preserve the American Dream for generations to come.

Each year I
have the privilege of nominating a limited number of students to our nation's service academies. It is my honor to nominate these young men and women

I wish them the best and thank them for their willingness to
serve our great nation.
