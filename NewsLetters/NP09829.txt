Rubio Pushes Bill To Impose Sanctions
On Human Rights Violators In
Venezuela
Marco, a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, argued for the need to
impose sanctions on individuals responsible
for the grotesque human rights violations
occurring in the midst of Venezuelas
ongoing political crisis. During
the
Committee hearing , Marco listed the
names of 23 people he believes are
candidates for these sanctions.
Marco is an original sponsor of the
Venezuela
Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society
Act of 2014 , which authorizes sanctions
on people involved in serious human rights
violations against peaceful demonstrators
in Venezuela. Excerpts from the hearing are
below.
We are calling on identifying
human rights violators in Venezuela,
naming them by name, and sanctioning them
for what theyve done. And I just
dont understand how we can sit
here and say that the time isnt
right to do that. I dont
understand how we can say we should wait
for some point in the future, when the
timing might be right to do that,
Rubio said . Because by
admission, what youre saying is
that, If the Venezuela government
does certain things over the next few
months. That day may never come.
And I just dont understand how
that can be our foreign
policy.
The future of Venezuela belongs
to the people of Venezuela. They must
determine the direction of that country,
and what sort of system of government and
economics they want. But what we also
want them to understand is that the
United States will not stand by and idly
watch as the rights of people, with whom
we share this hemisphere, are
systematically violated by an
anti-American government
to top
it all off
and ignore their
plight,
Rubio added . And we will
endeavor to use, and I think in a
bipartisan way I hope
and I know
in this Committee that will be the case
in a bipartisan way, to use the
influence and the power of the United
States of America to firmly line up on
the side of those who aspire to liberty,
to freedom, and to respect of human
rights.

sanctions on the Maduro regime in English

ICYMI: Rubio: Ukraine Needs A
LifelineNow
On Tuesday, Marco wrote on op-ed for
The Wall Street Journal , weighing in
on the situation in Ukraine. An excerpt of
the piece is below.
Ukraine's future as a sovereign nation
is under threat as Russia continues to
behave aggressively in the region.
President Obama and European leaders are
considering imposing broader economic
sanctions to punish Vladimir Putin for
unlawfully annexing Crimea. They should
do it quickly.
This would make it clear to the
Kremlin, which is deeply involved in
managing Russia's economy and military,
that belligerent behavior has
consequences. But in addition to hurting
Russia with sanctions, the U.S. should
strengthen Ukraine economically. This
will help the country withstand Mr.
Putin's attempted takeover.
One way to increase the chances of a
prosperous future in Ukraine is to
strengthen the nation's currency, the
hryvniafor a stable monetary
foundation is necessary for economic
growth. Even as the value of the Russian
ruble has fallen almost 9% against the
dollar in 2014, Mr. Putin takes comfort
in knowing that the hryvnia is doing
worse: It has plummeted 35% against the
dollar since January. The currency's
weakness is part of his plan to bring
Ukraine to its knees.

Rubio Welcomes Supreme Court Decision
Upholding Legislative Prayer
On Monday, Marco released the following
statement regarding the Supreme
Courts decision in
Town of Greece v. Galloway
to uphold
legislative prayer:
I welcome todays Supreme
Court decision upholding the long
American tradition of legislative prayer.
The Town of Greeces practice of
allowing guest chaplains
who
could be of any faith, or none at all
to lead invocations reflects
Americas long tradition of
religious freedom.
I filed
a
friend-of-the-Court brief in this
case , and personally attended the
Supreme Court arguments, because I
believed that important principles that
make America a unique and vibrant country
were directly at stake. This decision is
an important vindication of what
defenders of religious liberty have long
known: we are enriched, not threatened,
by the open and free expression of
religion.
Unlike so many other countries
around the world, America always has been
a place where religion brings people
together. In times of war and peace,
tragedy and triumph, prayer has united
us. Prayer has inspired many of the great
reforms that have strengthened and
delivered on the promises of liberty made
in 1776.
Legislative prayer, in
particular, is a practice that goes back
to the very Founders of the Republic. It
has enriched my career as a public
servant, both in the Florida legislature
and now in the U.S. Senate. That
tradition hung in the balance in this
case. If the lower courts decision
had been allowed to stand, we would have
taken a dangerous turn away from the
vision of our Founders. We would have
moved one step further toward the
naked public square where
religion is stigmatized, feared, and
something best kept private.
Defenders of religious freedom
at home and abroad should be encouraged
by todays ruling.
Constituent Casework Corner
Jack, an active duty military member
residing in Tampa, was served with an
eviction notice just weeks before he was
scheduled to deploy. The home he was
renting with his wife and child went into
foreclosure when the landlords short
sale was not approved. Jack signed a
one-year lease before the house was
foreclosed. In his attempts to find out
what entity to pay rent to, he was put in
touch with a realtor who put him in touch
with a property manager for Fannie Mae.
Shortly after he was served with an
eviction notice, he contacted Senator
Rubios office for assistance. A
member of the staff contacted Fannie Mae
and was informed that the eviction had been
closed, the lease execution was pending and
repairs had been authorized to allow
Jacks family to remain in the home
while he was deployed.
