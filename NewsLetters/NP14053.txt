Dear Neighbors,
Learning by doing is one of the fastest and most effective ways to
acquire a new skill. I've seen this in my own business experience, and
I've heard it from employers. That's why today I introduced the LEARN
Act to expand our nation's On-the-Job training programs.
The LEARN Act helps businesses invest in people, hiring and training
new employees to grow their business and provide quality jobs. As our
economy continues to recover and workers adjust to a rapidly-changing
marketplace, On-the-Job training is a win-win.
Businesses have the ability to train workers with precise skills for
the 21st Century, but too many find the cost of hiring and training
prohibitive-the LEARN Act helps offset these costs and can help
businesses expand and help workers gain necessary experience.
On-the-Job training is a way for businesses to grow quickly, and I'm
excited about the new opportunities the LEARN Act can create in our
communities.
Thank you,
Brad Schneider

Dear
Neighbors,
Learning
by
doing
is
one
of
the
fastest
and
most
effective
ways
to
acquire
a
new
skill.
I&#8217;ve
seen
this
in
my
own
business
experience,
and
I&#8217;ve
heard
it
from
employers.
That&#8217;s
why
today
I
introduced
the
LEARN
Act
to
expand
our
nation&#8217;s
On-the-Job
training
programs.
The
LEARN
Act helps
businesses
invest
in
people,
hiring
and
training
new
employees
to
grow
their
business
and
provide
quality
jobs.
As
our
economy
continues
to
recover
and
workers
adjust
to
a
rapidly-changing
marketplace,
On-the-Job
training
is
a
win-win.
Businesses
have
the
ability
to
train
workers
with
precise
skills
for
the
21st
Century,
but
too
many
find
the
cost
of
hiring

prohibitive&#8212;the
LEARN
Act
helps
offset
these
costs
and
can
help
businesses
expand
and
help workers
gain
necessary
experience.
On-the-Job
training
is
a
way
for
businesses
to
grow
quickly,
and
I&#8217;m
excited
about
the
new
opportunities
the
