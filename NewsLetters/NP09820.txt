Ann's Weekly Update
Dear Friend,
I've always been told sunlight is the best disinfectant.
But for
nearly two years, the Obama Administration has cast a dark shadow over
the Benghazi terrorist attacks where four Americans lost their lives.
And for nearly two years, the Administration has corroded the trust of
the public by withholding documents and refusing to cooperate with the
ensuing investigations by Congress.
Unfortunately, we are left with more questions than answers.
Our
system of government depends on transparency and trust.
On Thursday, I
voted to create a Benghazi Select Committee, which aims to restore
trust in government by seeking the facts surrounding the attacks in
Benghazi in a bipartisan and respectful manner.
This investigation
will and must always be about honoring the lives of our four fallen
heroes, and making sure that justice is served.
Kidnappings by Boko Haram
As a mother of three children, I can't even imagine the pain and
anguish these families are going through in Nigeria.
For far too long,
terrorist groups like Boko Haram have participated in human
trafficking, where innocent children are dragged into the dark abyss of
sex slavery.
While I commend President Obama for taking steps to
address this issue, we must do more to stop these vile terrorists.
As a result, I authored a bipartisan letter with Congresswoman Ann
McLane Kuster and all the House Women Representatives condemning the
abduction of nearly 300 girls by the terrorist group Boko Haram in
Chibok, Nigeria.
The letter urges the U.S. government to push the
United Nations Security Council to add Boko Haram to the Al-Qaida
Sanctions List, resulting in more comprehensive financial sanctions
against the terrorist organization.
I look forward to working with the Administration and our colleagues in
Congress to stop the horrors of human trafficking both at home and
abroad.
Text of the letter can be found here.
Financial Services Legislation
This week, I introduced the Small Business Freedom to Grow Act, which
would allow smaller companies to have access to many of the
capital-raising advantages enjoyed only by larger companies.
Small businesses are the engines of a vibrant economy. Yet, during one
of the slowest economic recoveries in modern history, Washington's
outdated policies are hurting the very people responsible for creating
good-paying jobs.
That's why I authored the Small Business Freedom to
Grow Act, which would help create an environment for smaller public
companies to raise more capital and hire more workers.
This
legislation would level the playing field currently enjoyed by larger
companies, and strengthen investor protections.
For far too long, Washington has made it harder for smaller businesses
to thrive in this tough economy.
I look forward to working with my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance this legislation out
of the Financial Services Committee.
As always, it is an honor to serve you and I look forward to speaking
with you again soon.
Sincerely,
Ann Wagner
Member of Congress

Ann's

Dear

I&#8217;ve
always
been
told
sunlight

But

nearly
two
years,
the
Obama
Administration
has
cast

Benghazi
terrorist
attacks
where
four
Americans

lives.
And
for
nearly
two
years,
the
Administration
has
corroded
the
trust
of
the
public
by
withholding
documents
and
refusing
to

with
the
ensuing

by
Congress.
Unfortunately,
we
are
left
with
more
questions
than
answers.
Our
system
of
government
depends
on
transparency
and

On
Thursday,
I

to
create
a
Benghazi

which
aims
to
restore
trust
in
government
by
seeking
the
facts
surrounding
the
attacks
in
Benghazi
in

This
investigation
will
and
must
always
be
about
honoring
the
lives
of
our
four
fallen

and
making
sure
that
justice
is
served.
Kidnappings
by
Boko

As
a
mother
of
three
children,
I
can&#8217;t
even

the
pain
and
anguish
these
families
are
going

Council
to
add
Boko

to
the
Al-Qaida

I
