Dear Friend,
I was honored to speak on Thursday at the dedication of the new John M.
Roll U.S. Courthouse in Yuma. I joined former Congresswoman Gabby
Giffords, Senators McCain and Flake, Mayor Nicholls of Yuma and others
at the ceremony.
(Rep. Gosar speaking at the dedication, April 24, 2014)
I was able to take a tour of this new courthouse and it is remarkable.
It is filled with natural light and the carpets look like an aerial
view of Yuma County's agricultural fields. It's fitting that this
impressive U.S. Courthouse is named after an impressive man, one who
dedicated his life to justice and to upholding the rule of law.
(Rep. Gosar touring a courtroom in the new courthouse, April 24, 2014)
U.S. District of Arizona Chief Judge John Roll, who was killed by Jared
Loughner at Gabby Giffords's event outside Tucson in 2011, served
Arizona and our nation honorably for four decades. He was a wise and
gracious man, who not only talked the talk but walked the walk. I hope
that all those who work in the courthouse in the years to come will
honor the legacy of Chief Judge Roll by executing the law with Lady
Justice in mind: impartially, fairly and objectively - just as Chief
Judge Roll did.
ObamaCare is a Complete Disaster
I've said all along that ObamaCare is a complete disaster. Now we've
learned it's so bad that Secretary Sebelius attempted to solicit
donations from an industry that her department is supposed to regulate
in order to persuade folks to sign up. The evidence couldn't be more
clear that ObamaCare just doesn't work. It's time for patient-centered,
market-based health care reform along the lines of a bill I helped
draft, the American Health Care Reform Act. Click HERE

We Must Responsibly Develop Our Resources
This week was National Parks week, giving us the opportunity to reflect
on our country's natural beauty. Growing up in Wyoming and living in
Arizona for most of my adult life has taught me that we must protect
our environment while responsibly developing our natural resources.
This is crucial to growing our economy and getting folks back to work,
which is why I've called on President Obama to, among other things,
approve the Keystone XL pipeline and end his administration's war on
energy.
Around Arizona
My travels across Arizona continued this week. I enjoyed having the
opportunity to meet new people, hear new ideas and learn new things.
Below are a few pictures from my travels.

This

Growing

This
is
crucial
to
growing

and
getting
folks
back
to
work,
which
is
why
I&#8217;ve
called
on
President
Obama
to,
among

things,
approve
the
Keystone

pipeline
and
end
his
administration&#8217;s
