Rep. Andrews Nominates Thirty-Five to Military Service Academies
HADDON HEIGHTS, NJ -Thursday, Congressman Andrews proudly nominated
thirty-five outstanding young men and women to attend our nation's
military service academies. These individuals have demonstrated a
commitment to their country and to excellence by fulfilling their
academic, extracurricular and community responsibilities with merit. As
a result, these individuals have been chosen to represent the First
Congressional District and their country with pride and distinction, a
designation they richly deserve.
Our nation's service academies play an integral role in building and
maintaining the strength of our military by serving as an incubator for
the future commanders of each branch of the Armed Forces. For
generations, these institutions have produced the best and brightest
leaders in the world. Today, many graduates are leading the way in our
military's efforts to defend America against terror, while countless
other graduates continue to excel beyond their call of duty as
successful leaders in civilian life.
Following an extensive review of dozens of applicants from throughout
our community, Congressman Andrews is proud to announce that the

academies to represent the First Congressional District:
