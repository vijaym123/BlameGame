Dear
Friend,
Last week, I was able to
connect with local veterans and members of the defense industry here
in Colorado Springs. I also attended a very important field hearing of
the House Veterans Affairs Committee that took place in New
Mexico.
I always enjoy any time I am
able to spend in the Fifth Congressional District. We live in the most
beautiful location in the country and I will continue to work hard to
represent you in Washington. If you are having an issue with a
federal agency, please do not hesitate to contact my Colorado Springs office
at (719) 520-0055. We will do everything possible to assist
you.

Logic
It is an honor to serve you in
Congress.
Sincerely,
Policy
Recap
As Hamas terrorists continue
their attacks against Israel, it's important to remember that the Iron
Dome is one of the most important keys to the safety and security of
Israeli civilians. This missile defense system has saved thousands of
lives and has provided the United States with data and information for
use in our own missile defense systems. Israel is our most important
ally in the region, and the Iron Dome and other missile defense systems
are saving lives today and preventing further conflict.
Thats
why, when the most recent funding requests came forward, I offered the
amendment to the Defense Authorization Act that doubled the funding
level requested by the Obama Administration. This funding increase
allowed more defensive missile batteries to be constructed. Israel's
missile defense systems not only protect our friends, the technology also
provides practical applications and field-tested understanding that is
applicable to America's missile defense network. Our crucial missile
partnership with Israel is a two-way street of information, technology,
and experience that provides tremendous benefits when it comes to
defending the United States of
America.

ADDRESSING IMPORTANT VETERANS
ISSUES

was pleased to meet with the team from Angels Of America's
Fallen. This great local non-profit works to mentor and stand with the
children of fallen military and first responders. Please join me in
thanking them for their work!
I was
honored to
meet with military widow Chris
Kinnard. She shared with me important information on legislation regarding
surviving military spousal
benefits.
I spent a significant portion of
my latest interview with AM 740 KVOR's Richard Randall discussing the
VA Reform legislation recently passed by Congress.

On Wednesday,
August 6th, Deputy VA Secretary Sloan Gibson visited Denver. Thanks
to Dale Anderson for attending from my staff. Between the Field Hearing
on access to care for rural veterans that I attended and this
meeting, we received many important pieces of information that we'll soon be
sharing with our veterans.
THE IRS
SCANDAL
Thanks to
Jonathan Jergensen, a constituent from Teller County, for meeting
with me to discuss the IRS Scandal. Jonathan shared some great insight,
that I can take back to Washington, based on his 25 years of data
recovery experience.
