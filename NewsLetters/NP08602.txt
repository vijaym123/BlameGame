Dear Friend,
Over the past month, you have probably heard a lot of people, including
myself, talking about the ongoing problems with the Department of
Veterans Affairs, and with good reason. As a nation, we should all
pledge to serve our veterans, once they return home, just as they
served to protect us. However, in these tumultuous times for the VA, I
believe it is important to remember and honor those who have shown
exemplary service and dedication to our nation's veterans.
House Approves Gosar Bill to Name Prescott Vet Center After Dr. Cameron
McKinley
On Tuesday this past week, the House of Representatives unanimously
passed my sponsored legislation, H.R. 1216, which will designate the
Department of Veterans Affairs Vet Center in Prescott, Arizona, as the
"Dr. Cameron McKinley Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Center".

I am proud to see the House recognize the distinguished life and career
of Dr. Cam McKinley. Dr. McKinley demonstrated extraordinary service
both as a U.S. Marine and as a veteran advocate. Much of his career was
spent as Chief Psychologist at the Prescott Veterans Affairs Hospital,
a facility in which he played an integral role in having opened. His
medical service was nothing short of groundbreaking, improving the
lives of countless Arizona veterans while specializing in treating post
traumatic stress disorder.
Dr. McKinley strove for exemplary service to his veteran colleagues. We
should all follow in his footsteps and challenge ourselves to serve
others as he did. The challenge before us as a nation is to provide
timely, quality, patient-centered, and patient-friendly care to each
and every veteran, just as Dr. McKinley did every day. Naming the
Prescott Vet Center after him will remind us of that vital mission. You
can watch my comments on the House floor honoring Dr. McKinley HERE

Arizona 4th Congressional District Constituents Inspire Idea Behind
Gosar Passed Amendment
This week, the House continued the annual process of appropriating
federal funds to various government agencies and departments. We
focused this week on Department of Defense Appropriations for fiscal
year 2015. I was able to pass three amendments targeted at cutting
wasteful spending out of the defense budget. However, I am particularly
proud of one of those amendments.
I always say that I rely on my constituents to be my eyes and ears on
the ground looking for ways that we can cut spending and make the
federal government more efficient and effective. My actions this week
are a testament to that principle. On Thursday June 19, the efforts and
ideas of a group of constituents in the Fourth Congressional District
were included in an amendment that the House unanimously agreed upon.
My amendment saves the U.S. Army around $5 million a year by switching
back to a previous aviation flight uniform that has proven to be safer
and more cost effective. Given the safety and practicality
applications, combined with the fact that the United States is not
exactly running a budget surplus right now, saving a few million here
and there in the name of safety and practicality is something we should
all agree upon.
This is how the legislative process is meant to work!
I represent YOUR interests and ideas. I am constantly inspired by
working with Arizona's constituents in order to take action and make
progress in the name of limiting government waste and abuse. I hope
that everyone reading this will continue to connect with my office so
that we can work together to build a freer, more prosperous nation. You
can read more about the amendment HERE
.
My other two House-passed amendments are outlined here:
Amendment 2: Prohibiting Funds for Unused Afghanistan Patrol Boats:
This amendment prohibits the Department of Defense from wasting more
money on storage for eight patrol boats which have already cost
taxpayers more than $3 million. These boats have never been used and
have been sitting in storage in Virginia for almost four years. Read
more HERE
.
Amendment 3: Prohibiting Funds from Going to Terrorists: This
amendment will further hold accountable foreign terrorist organizations
(FTOs), in addition to those foreign governments who support their
efforts. Giving assistance to FTOs is generally outlawed in the U.S.
Code, but the Obama Administration time and time again has failed to
enforce the laws of this nation. My amendment checks both the
President's lawless behavior in addition to his listless and dangerous
foreign policy agenda. Read more HERE

House GOP Elects New Leadership
If you follow the national political news scene, then you probably
already know that last week House Majority Leader, Eric Cantor (R-VA),
became the first sitting Majority Leader to lose in a primary election
in the history of the House of Representatives. It was a shocking
result that will have a big impact on the direction of Congress.
While media pundits spent the past week franticly analyzing the results
and predicting what is next in store for the House, Rep. Cantor's loss
reminded me of one simple truth. Our elected leaders cannot forget that
they serve the people that elect them. Period. If members of Congress
forget that important fact, and fail to remember that they represent
the ideas and opinions of their constituents, then they will not be
members of Congress for long. That is why I will continue to listen to
your ideas and concerns and engage with you on finding solutions to our
nation's biggest challenges.
Rep. Cantor made the decision to step down from his position as
Majority Leader and on Thursday June 19, the House GOP elected Rep.
Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) to be the new Majority Leader and Rep. Steve
Scalise (R-LA) as the new Majority Whip to replace Kevin McCarthy. Our
new leadership has a difficult challenge ahead but I remain optimistic
that they can effectively lead the House and I look forward to working
with them in order to better hold our elected leaders accountable for
their actions.
Majority Leader Elect - Kevin McCarthy (R-CA)
Majority Whip Elect - Steve Scalise (R-LA)
Government Waste - Fact of the Week:
Federal tax revenues continue to run at a record pace in 2014, as the
federal government's total receipts for the fiscal year closed at an
unprecedented $1,934,919,000,000. Despite record revenue, the federal
government still ran a deficit of $436.382 billion in the first eight
months of 2014.

I

This

the

We

for
ways
that

and
make

My
actions
this
week
are
a
testament
to
that
principle.
On
Thursday
June
19,
the
efforts
and
ideas
of
a
group
of
constituents
in
the
Fourth

District
were
included
in
an
amendment
that
the
House

My
amendment
saves
the

that

saving

My
other
two

amendments

This
amendment
prohibits
the
Department
of

from
wasting
more
money
on

for
eight
patrol
boats
which
have
already
cost
taxpayers
more
than
$3

These
boats
have
never
been
used
and
have
been
sitting
in

in
Virginia
for
almost
four
years.

Amendment
3:
Prohibiting
Funds
from
Going
to
Terrorists:
This
amendment
will
further
hold
accountable
foreign
terrorist
organizations
(FTOs),
in
addition
to
those
foreign
governments
who
support
their
efforts.
Giving
assistance
to
FTOs
is
generally
outlawed
in
the
U.S.
Code,
but
the
Obama
Administration
time
and
time
again
has
failed
to
enforce
the
laws
of
this
nation.
My
amendment
checks
both
the
President&#8217;s
lawless
behavior
in
addition
to
his
listless
and
dangerous
foreign
policy
agenda.

House
GOP
Elects
New
Leadership
If
you
follow
the
national
political
news
scene,
then
you
probably
already
know
that
last
week
House
Majority
Leader,
Eric
Cantor
(R-VA),
became
the
first
sitting
Majority
Leader
to
lose
in
a
primary
election
in
the
history
of
the
House
of
Representatives.
It
was
a
shocking
result
that
will
have
a
big
impact
on
the
direction
of
Congress.
While
media
pundits
spent
the
past
week
franticly
analyzing
the
results
and
predicting
what
is
next
in
store
for
the
House,
Rep.
Cantor&#8217;s
loss
reminded
me
of
one
simple
truth.
Our
elected
leaders
cannot
forget
that
they
serve
the
people
that
elect
them.
Period.
If
members
of
Congress
forget
that
important
fact,
and
fail
to
remember
that
they
represent
the
ideas
and
opinions
of
their
constituents,
then
they
will
not
be
members
of
Congress
for
long.
That
is
why
I
will
continue
to
listen
to
your
ideas
and
concerns
and
engage
with
you
on
finding
solutions
to
our
nation&#8217;s
biggest
challenges.
Rep.
Cantor
made
the
decision
to
step
down
from
his
position
as
Majority
Leader
and
on
Thursday
June
19,
the
House
GOP
elected
Rep.
Kevin
McCarthy
(R-CA)
to
be
the
new
Majority
Leader
and
Rep.
Steve
Scalise
(R-LA)
as
the
new
Majority
Whip
to
replace
Kevin
McCarthy.
Our
new
leadership
has
a
difficult
challenge
ahead
but
I
remain
optimistic
that
they
can
effectively
lead
the
House
and
I
look
forward
to
working
with
them
in
order
to
better
hold
our
elected
leaders
accountable
for
their
actions.
