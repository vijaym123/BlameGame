Dear Friends,
On Monday, I held a roundtable in Charleston
to bring together stakeholders to examine how to protect seniors
against financial scams and abuse.
Elder Financial Abuse:
Keeping West Virginias Seniors Safe at the Tiskelwah Center brought
together a diverse group of law enforcement, financial services and
seniors' advocates, including representatives from the West Virginia Attorney
Generals office, the Kanawha County Sheriffs Office, AARP, the West
Virginia Health Care Association, Kanawha Valley Senior Services,
City National Bank and Star Federal Credit Union.
West
Virginias seniors have worked hard to ensure that they have sufficient
financial resources to live through retirement, and the last thing they
should have to worry about is protecting themselves from fraud and scams.
Unfortunately, the cruel reality is that there are individuals that
prey on the most vulnerable, including our seniors.
This
roundtable highlighted the impact that fraud and scams have on the
financial and mental wellbeing of our seniors and their caretakers. As a
senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, I will continue
to work in Congress to ensure that the earnings our seniors have
worked their whole lives for are safe from scams, fraud and
theft.
Some simple tips from the American Bankers Association can help
keep your information safe or protect your parents from
scams:
Keep personal information private.
Shred,
shred, shred!
Check your credit
report.
Lock up your checkbook when others are in your home.
Never
pay a fee or send money to collect sweepstakes or lottery
"winnings."
Pay with checks or credit cards, not cash, to keep a
paper trail.
Trust your
instincts.
INVESTING
IN INFRASTRUCTURE
This afternoon, I joined Mason
County residents in Hartford to celebrate the completion of much-needed
upgrades to the town's wastewater collection and treatment
system.
I helped secure funding for these system improvements through
the Central West Virginia Environmental Infrastructure Fund, section
571 of the Water Resources Development Act. In February 2012, I
joined Colonel Robert Peterson in Hartford for the signing of a
partnership between the town of Hartford and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
for $171,000. These funds were used to improve the systems pump
stations, water treatment and manholes.
Numerous other
dignitaries also attended today's celebration, including Hartford Mayor and
Chief of Police Sam Anderson, New Haven Mayor Charles Yonker and Hartford
City Council members.
WEST VIRGINIA OIL
REFINERY
On Wednesday, I had the privilege to visit Newell
and tour Ergon, the only oil refinery in West Virginia. I visited four
production areas in the plant: maintenance shop fabrication, the
fuels truck loading rack, the central control building, and the refinery
barge dock to see the transport systems that the plant
uses.

My newsletter will return Aug. 22. Thank you
for reading my
weekly
e-newsletter, and as always, you
can join in the conversation on
Facebook
and
