Dear Friend,
Last week at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C., President Obama made insensitive remarks about Christianity that deeply disappointed me and many other Christians across the nation. While rightly criticizing the atrocious violence by the Islamic State, the president wrongly compared this behavior to the Christian faith to make a political point. His remarks oversimplified history and did not acknowledge the real threat radical Islam poses to all faiths.
The Christianity I know spreads a message of love and hope that we see throughout southeast and southern Missouri.
In Cape Girardeau, La Croix Church collects money to build clean wells for villages in Africa and supports Feed My Starving Children.
In Rolla, volunteers from Grace Fellowship Church and churches around the area feed more than 5,000 needy families each year.
Farmington Ministerial Alliance is a group of local churches that run thrift stores to fund food pantries and provide financial assistance for those who need help paying utility and medical bills.
The group Young Faith in Christ provides mentors to children in schools, and the Centenary United Methodist Church in Bonne Terre offers new basic school supplies for students each August in their &#147;Free Stuff for School&#148; program.
The Christian Clinic in West Plains helps those without health insurance by providing no&#45;cost access to preventive medicine and medical care.
In Mountain View, the volunteers at Good Samaritan Care Clinic offer the uninsured valuable medical and dental services.
This is the Christianity I know. The president is not a theologian or a historian, he is the Commander&#45;in&#45;Chief. Our president should be talking about how to best protect Americans and encouraging the good works of Christians here at home, not inflaming tensions of division and offending Christians.
THIS WEEK&#39;S HIGHLIGHTS
The House passed
H.R. 644 Fighting Hunger Incentive Act
to fix the tax code to make charitable giving easier, and also to make the tax deduction for donating to food pantries permanent. On Tuesday, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, and I stopped by the D.C. Central Kitchen to discuss how the change will benefit charities.
Fixing the tax code will give pantries in our area more certainty to provide meals for individuals in need.
A bill I proudly co&#45;sponsored,
H.R. 636 America&#146;s Small Business Tax Relief Act , passed the House this week. This bill will make Section 179 of the tax code permanent. As a farm owner from southern Missouri, I know how important it is to make Section 179 expensing permanent. This will give all of the farmers and small businesses in our area the certainty they need to plan for the year.
This week I made good on my bet with Representative Bradley Byrne &#40;AL&#150;01&#41;. I hate losing, but I love any chance to share a caramel pecan apple pie from the Blue Owl Restaurant and Bakery, and Dexter BBQ ribs and brisket&#33;
The Smith family from Rolla stopped by my office this week and received a tour of the Capitol building from my staff. It was a great way to celebrate President Lincoln&#146;s birthday! If you are planning a trip to Washington, please contact our office for tour information.
Sincerely,
Jason Smith
Member of Congress
