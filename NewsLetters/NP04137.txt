Dear Friends,
On Thanksgiving, we gather
with friends and family and give thanks for the many blessings we
enjoy
including the constitutional rights bestowed by our
Creator.
Every American has the right to freedom of speech, freedom of
religion, freedom of assembly, the right to vote and participate in our
democracy
freedoms that are scarce in many parts of the
world.
The origin of those liberties runs back to the first
Thanksgiving.
In the fall of 1621, Pilgrims who left England to escape
religious persecution marked their first harvest after much
hardship.
Nearly half of the 102 passengers on the Mayflower had
died. But with the help of Native Americans with whom they celebrated
that first Thanksgiving, the settlement at Plymouth, Mass.,
continued.
In time, the Pilgrims prospered and their new-found freedoms
inspired others to start new lives in the New World.
For my
family, Thanksgiving is about togetherness and
gratitude.
My wife comes from a large family
11 siblings plus spouses and
children. We talk, we share, we play, we pray.
One of the best
parts of Thanksgiving comes before we eat. Every person takes a moment
to express their gratitude for the blessings they have received during
the year. It takes a while, but its wonderful to hear from everyone
especially the younger children.
No matter the size of
your gathering, on behalf of my family, Id like to wish you and your
family the happiest of Thanksgivings and pray that God will continue to
bless the United States of America.
Thank
you ,
