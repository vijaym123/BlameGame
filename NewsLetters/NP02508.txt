Kansas Common Sense
February 23, 2015
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thank you for your continued interest
in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them. I have enjoyed my
conversations with Kansans during this state work period when there
were no votes or hearings in the Senate; however, I'm anxious to return
to Washington, D.C., to continue to work on the numerous critical
issues facing our state and nation.
Kansas Listening Tour Stops in Southwest Kansas
Thanks to the Southwest Kansas communities-Dodge City, Meade, Lakin,
Ulysses, Hugoton, Rolla, Johnson and Syracuse-for the warm welcome this
week. I appreciate everyone who took time to visit with me about issues
affecting Kansas and the country. For upcoming town hall meetings,
visit my website
Ford County
About 35 Dodge City-area residents asked questions and shared concerns
about quality health care for veterans, the cost of higher education,
agriculture, and the lesser prairie chicken. Thanks to Dodge City
Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Dan Schenkein and Dodge City
Rotary Club President Jeff Forrest for hosting my visit.
Meade County
Our conversation focused on the regulatory burdens placed on
agriculture due to the lesser prairie chicken listing and the proposed
rule to define waters of the United States. We also discussed social
security, health care and the future of the Affordable Care Act, ISIS
and the Authorization for Use of Military Force. Thanks to all the
folks who came to the town hall meeting and to Meade County Hospital
CEO Mickey Thomas for hosting.
Kearny County
Great listening tour stop in Lakin-area residents came out to discuss
concerns with access to quality health care for our veterans and rural
Kansans, the threat of ISIS, Farm Bill implementation, immigration, and
the newly functioning Senate. Thanks to Cindy Sprunger for helping to
coordinate the visit.
Grant County
Thanks to the nearly 50 Ulysses area residents who attended my Grant
County town hall meeting in conjunction with Rotary Club on Tuesday. We
discussed the lesser prairie chicken listing, executive actions, and
federal government regulatory burdens. Thanks also to Mike Andrusak for
the invitation to speak.
Stevens County
I visited with 40 Stevens County residents on Tuesday about a number of
issues including immigration, education, the threat of ISIS, VA reform
and prioritizing federal spending. Below, I'm pictured with Moscow High
School Students Bryce Valdez, Zach Pierson and Vance Thompson. Thanks
to Ruth Van Horn with the local chamber for organizing the meeting. It
was also nice to catch up with Sharon Concannon, USD 210 Superintendent
Marc Crawford, Hugoton Mayor Neil Gillispie and County Commissioner Joe
D. Thompson.
Morton County
Rolla area residents expressed concern with the postal service, Farm
Bill implementation, sequestration, the lesser prairie chicken, tax
reform and the transportation bill. Thanks to City Clerk Jean Hull for
helping to organize the meeting. I also appreciated former state
representative Bill Light and longtime County Commissioner Ron DeGarmo
for joining me. Below, I'm pictured with Steve Hittle.
Stanton County
Thanks to the 30 folks who came out to my town hall meeting in Johnson
to discuss numerous issues of importance to Kansas and the country.
Below, I'm pictured with Stanton Deputy County Appraiser Katie Denney
who shared a story about her son's military service in Afghanistan.
Other area residents discussed reining in federal agency regulations,
preserving Critical Access Hospitals, immigration, ISIS and the
Keystone XL Pipeline. Thanks to Stanton County Clerk Sandy Barton for
organizing the meeting. Thanks also to Suzette Gerber for bringing the
senior high school government class, Stanton County Hospital
Administrator Jay Tuston, Chamber of Commerce Director Karla Dimitt,
Stanton County Commissioner John Smith, County Attorney Dave Black and
Judge Vernon Butt for taking time to attend.
Hamilton County
Syracuse residents shared concerns with me about education, the Farm
Bill, tax reform, the importance of a functioning Congress and the
threat of ISIS. Thanks to the Hamilton County Farm Bureau for hosting
and providing refreshments. It was great to see the local elementary
school principal Beck Clark, Syracuse High School Principal Paul
Zuzelski and Syracuse High students in attendance. Thanks also to
Hamilton County Commissioners Randy Braddock, Keith Puckett and Nikki
Schwerdfeger, as well as Syracuse City Councilman Steve Schell and
Syracuse Economic Development Director Leslie Carlholm for taking time
to participate.
Redeployment Ceremony for 1st Brigade
This week, it was a real honor to welcome the 1st Armored Brigade
Combat Team home to Fort Riley from their recent deployment in Kuwait.
There is nothing more patriotic than seeing 300 soldiers welcomed home
by family, friends and fellow soldiers after serving their country
overseas for nine months. Moments like this are a reminder of the
difficulties military families face that many Americans fortunately
never have to experience. The sacrifice of these soldiers is
incredible, responding to their country's call anywhere, anytime in
order to protect our nation.
Liberal Pancake Feed
On Tuesday, I had the honor of speaking to hundreds of attendees to
Liberal's annual Pancake Day Breakfast. The community hosts a variety
of events over the course of a week in conjunction with the
International Pancake Race-a competition between Liberal, Kansas, and
Olney, England, with women running down the streets of each town
flipping pancakes. This is a tradition that has been held in both
communities for more than 60 years. Thanks to Mayor Joe Denoyer for the
invitation to attend.
Conestoga Energy Visit in Garden City
On Monday afternoon, I stopped by Conestoga Energy's Bonanza BioEnergy
Plant in Garden City. We discussed the facilities operations, current
employment levels, and ways the United States can become more energy
independent. In addition to the plant in Garden City, Conestoga has
facilities in Liberal, Kansas, and Levelland, Texas. I appreciated the
time given by CEO Tom Willis for the productive conversation. (photo by
Garden City Telegram's James Dobson)
Meeting with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack
This week I am scheduled to meet with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack
to discuss issues important to farmers, ranchers and others in rural
Kansas. As chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee,
which oversees the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) budget, my
goal is to work with Secretary Vilsack to make certain we are
prioritizing spending on policies that are important to Kansans. My
subcommittee will also be taking a hard look at spending in areas of
the budget and programs that are not working, and sometimes even
harming our farmers and ranchers.
As I travel across the state and conduct town hall meetings, I hear
many concerns that I will bring up in our meeting. If you have a
particular issue that you would like for me to discuss with the
Secretary of Agriculture, please contact my office at 785-539-8973. I
look forward to a productive meeting with Secretary Vilsack and the
opportunity to convey the importance of agriculture to our state.
Agriculture drives our state's economy and provides a special way of
life for many Kansans. It's critical that we work to protect and
preserve our agricultural heritage for the next generation of producers.
A VA Worthy of Veterans' Service - Tell Your Story
Veterans deserve a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that is worthy
of their service and sacrifice for our nation. When the Senate and
House came together to pass the Choice Act last summer, there was a
sense of hope among veterans, their families and the American people
that it was the start of dramatic change at the VA. Six months later,
many veterans are still unable to access the care they need because of
numerous problems with Choice Act implementation.
It is clear that we are not prepared for the servicemen and women who
are returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan, and we are not capable of
caring for our aging veterans - particularly those from the Vietnam era
- as we promised we would and as every American knows we should.
Unfortunately, common sense is not prevailing and the VA continues to
operate in the same bureaucratic fashion.
To veterans and their families - I want to hear about your experience
with the Choice Act Program. Too often the personal story of a veteran
who is struggling to get the help he or she deserves goes unheard. I
want to make certain the VA listens and commits to transformation of a
bureaucracy that is a disservice to our veterans. Click here
to share your experience.
I will do my best to respond in a timely fashion and make certain the
VA hears your story.
Wamego High School Visit
On Friday morning, I traveled to Wamego to visit with students and
staff at Wamego High School. My visits to Kansas schools help me to
learn more about the successes and challenges educators face in
providing Kansas students opportunities to a quality education. These
visits provide me valuable insight as Congress works on reauthorization
of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act - the primary source of
federal aid for K-12 education - a reauthorization which is urgently
needed and long overdue.
During my visit, I briefly visited with students in a World History
class, and met with three students--Aaron Pachta, Ethan Artzer and
Anthony Klecan-who interviewed me as part of a project for Future
Business Leaders of America. I discussed with them the importance of
business education and entrepreneurialism, and my efforts in Congress
to advance policies that promote the creation of new businesses and
increase job opportunities for Americans. Our country benefits from
having young people like those I met with at Wamego High School who
take an interest in the issues facing our country. Thanks to Principal
Tim Winter for taking the time to visit with me about various issues
impacting education in Kansas, and for guiding me on my tour of the
school.
Manhattan Chamber Meeting and Banquet
On Friday evening, I joined a big crowd at the Manhattan Chamber of
Commerce 90th Annual Banquet. Congratulations to Dan Yunk for being
named Lud Fiser Citizen of the Year and to Mark Knackendoffel for being
named the 2014 Volunteer of the Year. Your commitment to Manhattan is
vital to the community. During the meeting the chamber also inaugurated
Lucy Williams as the new board chairman. I have no doubt Lucy will lead
the board through a successful year.
Kansas Lions District 17-A Convention
Saturday, I was invited to speak at the Kansas Lions District 17-A
Convention in Manhattan. The special guest was International Director
Michael Molenda from Hastings, Minn. This photo is with him, his wife,
Linda, and Past International Director Ernest Young, Jr., from Lansing.
As a long-time member of the Hill City Lions Club, I was honored for
the invitation to speak. The Lions are strongly committed to service
and a desire to make the world a better place through humanitarian
efforts. Thanks to District Governor Bev Greenwood for inviting me.
Meeting with 27 Committee
It was helpful for me to meet with members of the 27 Committee over the
weekend to discuss Ft. Leavenworth. They are a civic organization that
supports and advocates for Ft. Leavenworth. We discussed the new
command structure with Army University, which offers opportunities for
Ft. Leavenworth to remain the "Intellectual Center of the Army,"
equipping our soldiers with the professional education they need to
become capable Army leaders.
Applications Available for Summer 2015 Internships
I am currently accepting internship applications for my Washington,
D.C. and Kansas offices for summer 2015. An internship, either

Meeting
with
Agriculture
Secretary
Tom
Vilsack
This
week
I
am
scheduled
to
meet
with
Agriculture
Secretary
Tom
Vilsack
to
discuss
issues
important
to
farmers,
ranchers
and
others
in
rural
Kansas.
As
chairman
of
the
Agriculture
Appropriations
Subcommittee,
which
oversees
the
U.S.
Department
of
Agriculture
(USDA)
budget,
my
goal
is
to
work
with
Secretary
Vilsack
to
make
certain
we
are
prioritizing
spending
on
policies
that
are
important
to
Kansans.
My
subcommittee
will
also
be
taking
a
hard
look
at
spending
in
areas
of
the
budget
and
programs
that
are
not
working,
and
sometimes
even
harming
our
farmers
and
ranchers.
As
I
travel
across
the
state
and
conduct
town
hall
meetings,
I
hear
many
concerns
that
I
will
bring
up
in
our
meeting.
If
you
have
a
particular
issue
that
you
would
like
for
me
to
discuss
with
the
Secretary
of
Agriculture,
please
contact
my
office
at
785-539-8973.
I
look
forward
to
a
productive
meeting
with
Secretary
Vilsack
and
the
opportunity
to
convey
the
importance
of
agriculture
to
our
state.
Agriculture
drives
our
state's
economy
and
provides
a
special
way
of
life
for
many
Kansans.
It's
critical
that
we
work
to
protect
and
preserve
our
agricultural
heritage
for
the
next
generation
of
producers.
A
VA
Worthy
of
Veterans'
Service
&ndash;
Tell
Your
Story
Veterans
deserve
a
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
that
is
worthy
of
their
service
and
sacrifice
for
our
nation.
When
the
Senate
and
House
came
together
to
pass
the
Choice
Act
last
summer,
there
was
a
sense
of
hope
among
veterans,
their
families
and
the
American
people
that
it
was
the
start
of
dramatic
change
at
the
VA.
Six
months
later,
many
veterans
are
still
unable
to
access
the
care
they
need
because
of
numerous
problems
with
Choice
Act
implementation.
It
is
clear
that
we
are
not
prepared
for
the
servicemen
and
women
who
are
returning
home
from
Iraq
and
Afghanistan,
and
we
are
not
capable
of
caring
for
our
aging
veterans
&ndash;
particularly
those
from
the
Vietnam
era
&ndash; as
we
promised
we
would
and
as
every
American
knows
we
should. Unfortunately,
common
sense
is
not
prevailing
and
the
VA
continues
to
operate
in
the
same
bureaucratic
fashion.
To
veterans
and
their
families
&ndash;
I
want
to
hear
about
your
experience
with
the
Choice
Act
Program.
Too
often
the
personal
story
of
a
veteran
who
is
struggling
to
get
the
help
he
or
she
deserves
goes
unheard.
I
want
to
make
certain
the
VA
listens
and
commits
to
transformation
of
a
bureaucracy
that
is
a
disservice
to
our
veterans.

share
your
experience.
I
will
do
my
best
to
respond
in
a
timely
fashion
and
make
certain
the
VA
hears
your
story.
Wamego
High
School
Visit
On
Friday
morning,
I
traveled
to
Wamego
to
visit
with
students
and
staff
at
Wamego
High
School.
My
visits
to
Kansas
schools
help
me
to
learn
more
about
the
successes
and
challenges
educators
face
in
providing
Kansas
students
opportunities
to
a
quality
education.
These
visits
provide
me
valuable
insight
as
Congress
works
on
reauthorization
of
the
Elementary
and
Secondary
Education
Act
&ndash;
the
primary
source
of
federal
aid
for
K-12
education
&ndash;
a
reauthorization
which
is
urgently
needed
and
long
overdue.
During
my
visit,
I
briefly
visited
with
students
in
a
World
History
class,
and
met
with
three
students&mdash; &mdash;Aaron
Pachta,
Ethan
Artzer
and
Anthony
Klecan&mdash; who
interviewed
me
as
part
of
a
project
for
Future
Business
Leaders
of
America.
I
discussed
with
them
the
importance
of
business
education
and
entrepreneurialism,
and
my
efforts
in
Congress
to
advance
policies
that
promote
the
creation
of
new
businesses
and
increase
job
opportunities
for
Americans.
Our
country
benefits
from
having
young
people
like
those
I
met
with
at
Wamego
High
School
who
take
an
interest
in
the
issues
facing
our
country.
Thanks
to
Principal
Tim
Winter
for
taking
the
time
to
visit
with
me
about
various
issues
impacting
education
in
Kansas,
and
for
guiding
me
on
my
tour
of
the
school.
Manhattan
Chamber
Meeting
and
Banquet
On
Friday
evening,
I
joined
a
big
crowd
at
the
Manhattan
Chamber
of
Commerce
90th
Annual
Banquet.
Congratulations
to
Dan
Yunk
for
being
named
Lud
Fiser
Citizen
of
the
Year
and
to
Mark
Knackendoffel
for
being
named
the
2014
Volunteer
of
the
Year.
Your
commitment
to
Manhattan
is
vital
to
the
community.
During
the
meeting
the
chamber
also
inaugurated
Lucy
Williams
as
the
new
board
chairman.
I
have
no
doubt
Lucy
will
lead
the
board
through
a
successful
year.
Kansas
Lions
District
17-A
Convention
Saturday,
I
was
invited
to
speak
at
the
Kansas
Lions
District
17-A
Convention
in
Manhattan.
T he
special
guest
was
International
Director
Michael
Molenda
from
Hastings,
Minn.
This
photo
is
with
him,
his
wife,
Linda,
and
Past
International
Director
Ernest
Young,
Jr.,
from
Lansing.
As
a
long-time
member
of
the
Hill
City
Lions
Club,
I
was
honored
for
the
invitation
to
speak.
The
Lions
are
strongly
committed
to
service
and
a
desire
to
make
the
world
a
better
place
through
humanitarian
efforts.
Thanks
to
District
Governor
Bev
Greenwood
for
inviting
me.
Meeting
with
27
Committee
It
was
helpful
for
me
to
meet
with
members
of
the
27
Committee
over
the
weekend
to
discuss
Ft.
Leavenworth.
They
are
a
civic
organization
that
supports
and
advocates
for
Ft.
Leavenworth.
We
discussed
the
new
command
structure
with
Army
University,
which
offers
opportunities
for
Ft.
Leavenworth
to
remain
the
"Intellectual
Center
of
the
Army,"
equipping
our
soldiers
with
the
professional
education
they
need
to
become
capable
Army
leaders.
