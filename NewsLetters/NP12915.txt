28 January 2014
2013 was a year dominated by big government abuse. From the IRS
targeting political groups to the NSA spying scandal, to disastrous
Obamacare -- big government overreached into our daily lives at every
turn.
In 2014, I'm working harder than ever to hold Washington accountable
for its big government failures.
Which is why I'll be live-tweeting the State of the Union tonight using
the hashtag #SOTU -- making sure you have the FACTS about all of the
issues the President brings up. Feel free to join the conversation at
@RepFincherTN08
around 6:00 p.m. CT. I'll be looking for some of
the best tweets to RT, as well as taking questions throughout the
evening.
Help fight big government with the click of a button
The IRS violated America's trust when it targeted conservative groups
for political gain. It's extremely important that this never happens
again. That's why I introduced H.R. 3074, the IRS Abuse Protection Act.
This bill would require the IRS to inform taxpayers when they access
their information. Right now, I'm trying to make more people aware of
this bill and need your help to spread the word.
