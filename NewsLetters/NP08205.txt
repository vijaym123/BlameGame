Dear friend,
This week marked one year since the U.S.
Supreme Court Struck down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act
(DOMA). That was a big step for LGBT rights and equal recognition by the
federal government. Unfortunately, one year later there is still
much work to do .
Last week, we heard from
the
Department of Justice
(DOJ) that some federal
agencies including the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are unable
to offer benefits to some same sex-couples because of discriminatory
language that is still in the U.S. code. Thats why we must pass the
Charlie Morgan Military Spouses Equal Treatment Act
- so that the VA can offer married same-sex military spouses and
their families the care and benefits they have earned and
deserve.
The Charlie Morgan Act is named after Chief Warrant Officer
Charlie Morgan of the New Hampshire National Guard who last year
passed away after battling breast cancer. Sadly, Charlies wife and
daughter have not been eligible for certain survivors benefits because of
the discriminatory language still in the U.S. code. Charlie was
courageous in her military services, in her fight against cancer and in her
battle for LGBT equality.
We cannot stand for a system
in which some veterans receive benefits and others dont simply based
on geography. We owe it to Charlie and all military couples to pass
the Charlie Morgan Act and make sure everyone receives the benefits
theyve earned.
Sincerely,
Jeanne
Shaheen
