Hello,
I hope you had a good week. Here's
what I was up to:
Fast Track -
Again
I again voted against giving
President Obama Trade Promotion Authority this week, when the House
leadership brought it back for a vote. A trade deal could be bad for
Northeast Ohio, and I heard overwhelmingly from you that you don't want
this.
More
Appropriations
My Appropriations Committee is moving along at
the fastest rate in recorded history.
A couple big things
happened this week:
The
FY16 Interior &amp; Environment Appropriations
Bill
passed out of
our full Appropriations Committee. This legislation
will fight job-crushing
regulations, protect the nations natural resources, and promote safe and
sustainable American energy.
Importantly, this bill includes $300 Million for
the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. That's huge for region because
these funds will go directly to programs in our area that help
protect our Great Lakes. If you read my Weekly Wrap 2 weeks ago, you may
recall the city of Mentor, in Lake County, was awarded a $250,000 grant
with these funds.
The House also passed the
FY16 Financial Services
&amp; General Government Appropriations Bill , which funds our
U.S. judicial system, law enforcement, and programs to bolster small
businesses while targeting IRS and other underperforming agencies for
cuts.
If agencies
aren't spending your tax dollars appropriately, my committee has the
jurisdiction to hold them accountable. That's what we did with the IRS
in this bill, when we cut their budget by $838 million. That's a step
forward.
Akron Children's
Hospital
I met
with a great young man names Chase Flaherty and representatives from
Akron Children's Hospital this week to discuss the reauthorization the
Children's Health Insurance Program, better known as "CHIP". Recently,
the House reauthorized CHIP and I was proud to support a program that
helps kids like Chase
succeed.
Universal Metal
Products
When I was back on Friday, I had a chance to tour
Universal Metal Products in Wickliffe. There are over 1,500
manufacturers and 65,000 manufacturing jobs in Ohio's 14th Congressional District,
making products and parts for different industries all across the
world.
Getting out
to see these companies and chat with these employees about what's on
their mind is crucial to helping me understand how I can best serve
you.
As I hope you can tell, we have been working hard
in Congress and I will continue to serve you to the best of my
ability every
day.
