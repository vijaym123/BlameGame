Dear Friends,
I am excited to share with you two updates about two Congressional Competitions for high school students. We announced the winner of the 2014 Congressional Art Competition at a reception in my District Office on Wednesday, April 23. Jessica Qui, a student at Ruth Asawa School of the Arts, won the first prize for her drawing &ldquo;Gestalt.&rdquo;
Jessica Qui with her art teacher Phyllis Ciment and Congresswoman Speier.
The Art Competition is a wonderful opportunity for students to gain national recognition for their creative talents. So if you are a high school student living in my district, I urge you to participate next year. You can find more information on
my website .
Secondly, the competitors in the first annual Congressional STEM Academics Competition have more time to create an app. We extended the deadline from April 30 to May 31. I hope you will take advantage of that and enter the contest!
The House App Contest is designed to engage high school students&rsquo; creativity and encourage participation in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math. Representing Silicon Valley &ndash; a hotbed of innovation &ndash; has convinced me of the importance of such initiatives that promote investment in STEM education, as well as legislation like H.R. 2426, the Educating Tomorrow&rsquo;s Engineers Act, of which I am a proud cosponsor. I want to do my part to
prepare you for employment in the high-tech industry.
If you are a student eligible to enroll in high schools located in the 14th District, you can enter by yourself or with a team of up to four if at least two of you live in the 14th District. You need to register at
StudentAppChallenge.house.gov
and create an account at
ChallengePost.com
by noon on Saturday, May 31, 2014 . You can visit
ChallengePost
any time before then to submit your contact information, completed release form, and final app entry. You can learn more about the competition and find resources for students and teachers on my
website . For any additional information, contact Kenneth Dowling at

All the best,
