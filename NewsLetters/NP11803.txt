Paying for College
Resources for Students and Families
Dear Friend,
With the cost of higher education soaring nationwide, it is important
for students and their families to understand the range of financial
aid options available to help them pay for college. The financial aid
landscape can be confusing and in too many cases resources are hard to
find. I wanted to share with you information about the financial aid
process and the available resources to make college as affordable as
possible.
Getting Started
It is important for both students and parents to prepare for college
during the 11th-grade year. This helpful college preparation checklist
can help you
stay on track.
The Free Application for Federal Student Aid
(FAFSA) is used to determine how much a family or
student is expected to contribute to the cost of attending
post-secondary schooling. It is also used to determine eligibility for
federal Stafford loans and Pell Grants, as well as work study and other
financial aid. Be sure to complete this application
completely and on time.
For specific questions, you can contact the Federal Student Aid
Information Center at 1-800-433-3243.
Federal Student Aid
The U.S. Department of Education publishes a great deal of information
regarding access to financial aid. Visit Student Aid on the Web
for information about different federal loan programs,
including:
Loans
, the most common federal aid, must be repaid
when you graduate or leave college:
*	Federal Stafford Loans
*	Federal PLUS Loans
(parental loans), not need-based
*	Perkins Loans
(campus-based aid) for low-income
students; offered through participating schools
Scholarships/grants are mostly need-based and require no repayment:
*	Pell Grants
*	Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants
(FSEOG)
*	Scholarships
Other grants, scholarships, and fellowships, mostly graduate level:
search the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance
(CFDA) by beneficiary, such as "Student or Trainee" or "Graduate
Student."
Work study programs allow you to earn money while in school:
*	Federal Work Study Program
: college campus jobs
*	Student Educational Employment
: jobs with the federal government
Tax Credits
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provides tax benefits for education
. For example, the American Opportunity
Tax Credit (AOTC) allows you to claim up to $2,500 per student per year
for the first four years of school as the student works toward a degree
or similar credential.
I am committed to ensuring that a college education must not be beyond
any American's reach solely due to the cost. That is why I have fought
to strengthen and streamline existing higher education tax credits,
such as the AOTC, so that they work more efficiently for students and
families. I have also pushed to ensure that student borrowers know
about the financial advantages of lower cost federal loans before they
borrow in the more expensive private market.
Please visit my website
and Facebook page
to learn more about my work to expand
access to affordable higher education.
