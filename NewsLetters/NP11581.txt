Friend,
We hope you had a chance to read Danny&#39;s email earlier this week - we&#39;re opening our first office!
Launching a grassroots campaign is always incredibly exciting. There&#39;s nothing like starting fresh with all the clipboards, campaign signs, and unlimited coffee. Volunteers are fired up and ready to get out there and connect with voters. There&#39;s an undeniable buzz in the air. (Then again, we&#39;re campaign staffers, so this is the kind of stuff we live for.)
We can&#39;t sustain this early momentum without you.
Can you click here to give $5 or more to help us purchase necessary supplies for our volunteers?
Danny already mentioned it, but here&#39;s a reminder of how the costs of keeping a campaign office running can add up:
-
$5:
a clipboard for a volunteer to knock on doors
-
$35:
a box of paper to print out our targets
-
$50:
snacks and water for our volunteers to fuel their work
-
$75:
keeping the internet up and running for one month
-
$200:
one month of phone lines for volunteers to use to call voters
It&#39;s not cheap, but we can do it with your help -
click here to help out our awesome volunteers and to help us keep our energy up so we can continue to fight the good fight.
Thanks!
Team Bera
P.S. Even $5 can go a long way - can we count on you today? We look forward to sharing pictures of our office opening early next week!
