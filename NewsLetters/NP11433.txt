Issues in Focus
Executive Overreach : The Constitution created three equal
branches of government, and Congress is solely responsible for making the
laws while the President enforces them.
No President should be
able to bypass Congress or selectively enforce the laws.
Unfortunately, time and time again we are seeing the Administration pick and
choose which laws, or parts of laws, it will enforce.
This attempt
to bypass Congress and govern by executive order or directive
undermines Congress, which the Founders intended to be most responsive to the
people.
On March
12, the House passed H.R. 4138, the ENFORCE Act, so the House or
Senate can
utilize the third branch of government -- the Judicial
Branch -- to
bring a lawsuit against the Executive Branch for
failing to execute the laws.
The following day, the House took up
another bill, H.R. 3973, the Faithful Execution of the Law Act, to hold
government officials accountable for enforcing the laws passed by
Congress.
No president,
regardless of party, should be able to act unilaterally, and these bills
would go a long way in restoring checks and balances.
Unfortunately,
the President has unsurprisingly promised to veto these
bills.
Highway
Funding : The House Highways and Transit Subcommittee, where I serve
as Chairman, is responsible for reauthorizing the nation's surface
transportation law later this year, and the task will not be easy.
Each year, the Highway Trust Fund requires additional funding because
of a growing shortfall in the amount of gas tax revenue versus the
amount required to maintain our infrastructure.
Many would like to
see a long-term solution so that we have an adequate funding mechanism
to support our country's roads and bridges.
Unfortunately, it is
estimated that the Highway Trust Fund will need over $100 billion
over the next six years in addition to the revenue coming in from the gas
tax.
My
colleagues and I on the House Transportation Committee are looking at all of
the options in order to make sure our infrastructure is maintained.
My subcommittee has held a series of hearings on the upcoming
reauthorization and we expect to have a bill later this summer.
At our last hearing on March 12
I questioned the
Administration about the so-called "voluntary" roadside stops that are
conducted across the country to research drunken and drugged driving.

I also
questioned Anne Ferro, Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Administration, about concerns I have heard from constituents in Wisconsin
about the safety rating system for trucking companies that appears to
be unfair to the operator or company in certain circumstances.

Regulatory
Burden : A certain level of regulation is often welcomed by individuals
and businesses.
Most individuals I imagine enjoy traffic
regulations for our roads to ensure they are safe and efficient, just as many
businesses welcome some standards and regulations to prevent other
businesses from exploiting workers or receiving an unfair advantage over
others.
However, recent reports indicate that federal regulations
alone cost the economy $1.8 trillion annually and require businesses
to spend over 10.38 billion hours on paperwork.
These figures
are nothing short of
astounding.
The House voted on several bills in February and March to
increase transparency in federal rulemaking and ensure regulations
are written with the least impact on the economy.

Ukraine : The situation in Ukraine is
troubling for several reasons.
Russia's presence in Crimea is unlawful
and sets a dangerous precedent for future international conflicts.
Many argue that Crimea has deep roots with Russia and many of its
citizens would prefer to be a part of Russia.
This will be put to
a vote on Sunday when Crimeans will hold a referendum on whether to
separate from the Ukraine.
One of the most important issues at
hand is assessing the United States' standing in the world and our
ability to leverage power.
President Obama appears to be scrambling
for a foreign policy position, while the House has passed legislation
authorizing the President to use loan guarantees to Ukraine and the
Senate appears stalled on an aid package.
Speaker Boehner has
supported some of the limited sanctions the President has taken, but has
pressed the Administration to expedite exports of U.S. natural gas to
Ukraine to free Russia's stranglehold on the nation's energy
source.

Port Washington Breakwater
Receives Critical Funding
On March 4, the Army Corps of Engineers
informed me that it would fund a short-term repair of the breakwater in
Port Washington that has been crumbling and has been deemed "unsafe for
use."
On March 8, I traveled to Port Washington to celebrate with
Mayor Tom Mlada.
The Corps said it was because of our
outreach
efforts
to
them about the state of the breakwater that they knew of its
urgency
