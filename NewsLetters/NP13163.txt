10, 2014
Last
year, I embraced a number of
new challenges, including my
role as Chairman of the
Senate Committee on Homeland
Security &amp; Governmental
Affairs. This position
has provided me with the
opportunity to more deeply
engage in and learn about a
wide range of issues.
If
youve been following
this newsletter, you know
Ive spent a lot of
time working on these issues.
As always, though, my primary
focus here in the Senate has
been working on behalf of the
First State and serving the
Delawareans that I am proud
to call friends and
neighbors.Over the next
year, I am going to continue
working to improve the lives
of all Delawareans and all
Americans. Specifically, some
of the goals I am working to
achieve in 2014 include:
Getting
Delawareans back to
work
Protecting
our nation from threats
at home and
abroad
Ensuring
the success of the
Affordable Care Act in
the First State
Passing
a balanced federal
budget for our
nation
Reducing
waste, fraud and abuse
in the government and
finding ways to get
better results for less
money
Passing
a Farm Bill
Working
to secure a National
Park in Delaware
Reforming
the Uinted States
Postal Service
Enacting
a comprehensive
immigration reform bill
that enhances our
national and economic
security

cybersecurity issues
facing our
nation
Implementing
federal IT reform and
improving efficiency of
government
contracting

technologies like
