Carper's Connection
November 7, 2014
Dear Friends,
Since its founding in 1791, Delaware has practiced a culture of
civility that has taken hold throughout our villages, towns, cities and
government. Each year, thousands of Delawareans gather in Georgetown on
the Thursday after Election Day for Return Day - a 223-year-old
political tradition that is unique to the First State.
On Return Day, Delawareans put aside our differences and
recommit to the common goal of building a better Delaware for
generations to come. Some refer to this display of civility as the "The
Delaware Way," and it echoes the First State's strong sense of
community, carrying with it a message of unity for mutual progress.
This Return Day, I realized our nation has a lot to learn - and even
more to gain - by working together in The Delaware Way. When the 113th
Congress returns to Washington next week, I urge my colleagues to
embrace the same core value of togetherness that we Delawareans embody
back home. Republican or Democrat or Independent - we must renew our
shared commitment to moving our nation forward.
Dutifully Yours,
