Let me get this out of the way, David. I&rsquo;m e-mailing for $5.
Here&rsquo;s why: -- Boehner&rsquo;s spending a staggering $4,8OO,OOO on Illinois T.V.
-- Poll after poll shows Cheri Bustos&rsquo; race in single-digits -- and Cheri&rsquo;s in serious danger of falling behind The only way we can stand up to Boehner&rsquo;s cash is if every Democrat reading this chips in for Cheri today. So David, I don&rsquo;t need you to hand over your life&rsquo;s savings -- but I do need you to chip in $5 (or more if you can) to Cheri&rsquo;s campaign for Illinois.
$5
$35
$50
$100
$250

If we don&rsquo;t step up for Cheri today, we&rsquo;ll pay the price on November 4th. So don&rsquo;t wait, chip in right now: http://action.cheribustos.com/donate I&rsquo;m so grateful you&rsquo;re standing with us. Nancy
