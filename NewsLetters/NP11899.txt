My Conservative Voting Record
Two of our country's leading advocates for conservative policies
recently released their Congressional rankings for 2013.
The Family
Research Council
named its True Blue
legislators based on pro-family, pro-life
votes.
And the American Conservative Union
named a select group of legislators as Defenders of Liberty
based on our
votes for constitutionally limited government, individual liberty, free
markets, a strong national defense, and traditional American values. I
was honored to be named both a True Blue legislator and a Defender of
Liberty, not just because these organizations support my voting record,
but because it shows that I've been a consistent advocate of West Texas
values in Washington.
We Texans are independent, hard-working, caring people who value our
liberty and our families.
Yesterday we celebrated the anniversary of
Texas Independence Day
, which is a great
reminder of the characteristics that make our state so exceptional.
I'm
proud to be a Texan, I'm honored to represent you in Congress, and I'm
committed to advocating for these values in every vote I take.
Same-Sex Marriage in Texas
Last week, a federal judge in San Antonio ruled that Texas's ban on
same-sex marriage is unconstitutional
.
He put a stay on the ruling,
however, meaning the ban won't be struck down immediately, but will
stay in place until higher courts can review the decision.
Attorney
General Greg Abbott has already pledged
to appeal the decision to a higher
court.
I applaud Abbott for his action, and I will support him in this
case.
Marriage is a sacred union between one woman and one man.
It's not the
place of federal judges to overturn this historic value.
Moreover, it's
not the federal government's place to overturn our state's right to
support traditional marriage.
Texans have voiced our values on this
loud and clear.
We overwhelmingly voted to support both the 2003 law
against same-sex unions and the 2005 state constitutional amendment
defining marriage as a union between one man and one woman.
I disagree
with this federal judge's definition of marriage and his attempt to
overrule Texas' state rights.
I'll continue to be a strong advocate
for traditional marriage and states' rights in Washington.
Action Item: Honoring Exceptional Local Students
Today, I had the privilege of meeting with some talented high school
students in Lubbock.
I visited Trinity Christian High School, where I
presented senior Daniel Kale Wilsford with his appointment to the
Military Academy at West Point.
Every year, dozens of smart, athletic,
and dedicated students apply for a nomination to one of our nation's
military academies.
Once nominated, they compete against the best and
brightest in the country for acceptance at West Point, the Air Force
Academy, and the Naval Academy.
And of course-that's just the
beginning of the challenge.
Kale and his peers will go on to complete
four intense years of scholarship, physical training, and military
leadership.
When they graduate, they will be prepared to join the
ranks of our military's officers, becoming true heroes that have
volunteered their service to our country.
I'm incredibly proud of Kale
and all the students in our area that have earned acceptance at our
military academies.
If you or a student you know is interested in
applying, visit my website
.
I also had the chance to honor the Lubbock High School Science Bowl
Team on winning the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Science
Bowl
's
regional competition.
The Science Bowl is a
nationwide academic competition that tests students' knowledge in all
areas of science and mathematics.
The Lubbock High School team will be
among among 24 teams that will go on to compete in the finals in
Washington, DC this April.
They'll face other regional champs in a
question-and-answer quiz on subjects ranging from biology to physics,
and chemistry to math.
They've already won $1,000 for the Lubbock High
School science department, and I'm incredibly proud of all the hard
work they've put in.
We need students to engage in science,
technology, engineering, and math if our country is going to continue
leading innovation in the world economy.

My
Conservative
Voting
Record
Two
of
our
country&#8217;s
leading
advocates
for
conservative
policies
recently
released
their
Congressional
rankings
for
2013.
The
Family
Research
Council
named
its
True
Blue
legislators
based
on
pro-family,
pro-life
votes.
And
the
American
Conservative
Union
named
a
select
group
of
legislators
as
Defenders
of
Liberty
based
on
our
votes
for
constitutionally
limited
government,
individual
liberty,
free
markets,
a
strong
national
defense,
and
traditional
American
values.
I
was
honored
to
be
named
both
a
True
Blue
legislator
and
a
Defender
of
Liberty,
not
just
because
these
organizations
support
my
voting
record,
but
because
it
shows
that
I&#8217;ve
been
a
consistent
advocate
of
West
Texas
values
in
Washington.
We
Texans
are
independent,
hard-working,
caring
people
who
value
our
liberty
and
our

Yesterday
we
celebrated
the
anniversary
of
Texas
Independence

which
is
a

of
the
characteristics
that
make
our
state

I&#8217;m

I&#8217;m
honored
to
represent
you
in
Congress,
and
I&#8217;m
committed
to
advocating
for
these
values
in
every

Same-Sex
Marriage
in
Texas
Last
week,
a
federal
judge
in
San
Antonio
ruled
that
Texas&#8217;s
ban
on
same-sex
marriage
is
unconstitutional .
He
put
a
stay
on
the
ruling,
however,
meaning
the
ban
won&#8217;t
be
struck
down
immediately,
but
will
stay
in
place
until
higher
courts
can
review
the
decision.
Attorney
General
Greg
Abbott
has
already
pledged
to
appeal
the
decision
to
a
higher
court.
I
applaud
Abbott
for
his
action,
and
I
will
support
him
in
this
case.
Marriage
is
a
sacred
union
between
one
woman
and
one
man.
It&#8217;s
not
the
place
of
federal
judges
to
overturn
this
historic
value.
Moreover,
it&#8217;s
not
the
federal
government&#8217;s
place
to
overturn
our
state&#8217;s
right
to
support
traditional
marriage.
Texans
have
voiced
our
values
on
this
loud
and
clear.
We
overwhelmingly
voted
to
support
both
the
2003
law
against
same-sex
unions
and
the
2005
state
constitutional
amendment
defining
marriage
as
a
union
between
one
man
and
one
woman.
I
disagree
with
this
federal
judge&#8217;s
definition
of
marriage
and
his
attempt
to
overrule
Texas&#8217;
state
rights.
I&#8217;ll
continue
to
be
a
strong
advocate
for
traditional
marriage
and
states&#8217;
rights
in
Washington.
