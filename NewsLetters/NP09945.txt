Dear Friend:
Today the Senate unanimously passed the resolution Senator Mary Landrieu (D-LA) and I introduced condemning the abduction of more than 200 Nigerian school girls by the terrorist group Boko Haram and urging the United States to assist in the rescue efforts.

Kidnapping has no place in any village, in any region, in any country.
We cannot stay silent in the face of these unspeakable crimes.
As a mother and a grandmother, my heart is with all of the mothers and fathers in Nigeria who want their daughters to come home safely.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
