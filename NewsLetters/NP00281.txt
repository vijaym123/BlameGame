Dear Friend, Earlier today, the House of Representatives voted on
the Trade Act of 2015
(H.R. 1314), which would 1.) enact Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), an important policy partnership between the legislative and executive branches for negotiating trade agreements, and 2.) reauthorize Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA), a program that provides federal support to dislocated workers, farmers, and firms that have been
adversely affected by international trade.
The legislation, which was already passed by the Senate last month as one major bill, was considered today by the House in two separate pieces.
The first part was to reauthorize TAA, which I voted for, but did not get enough votes overall to pass. This is because not enough members of President Obama's party came forward to support it.
The second part was to establish TPA, which I also voted for, and which
did
successfully pass by a vote of 219-211. (Despite some misconceptions, TPA is not the same thing as TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a future trade deal which is still being negotiated.)
In order for the Trade Act to be signed into law by the president, both parts of it must be passed. That is why the House plans to re-vote next week on the TAA provision in order to complete the bill. With all the acronyms and bill numbers being tossed around, I fully understand that this whole process can be quite confusing to follow. But the most important thing to remember is that passing and enacting TPA is the only means for guaranteeing strong free trade agreements with our partners overseas that will create jobs, increase wages, and protect workers here at home.
The full text of the legislation to enact TPA is available online for public viewing. You can read all of it
here .
It is my hope that both Republicans
and
Democrats will ultimately come together to pass this historic legislation and help send a signal to the entire world that the United States intends to keep writing the rules of the global economy.
Sincerely,
Rep. Kelly
Applauds
House Passage
of Defense Appropriations Bill
Includes language requested by Kelly to continue ban on funding
for UN Arms Trade Treaty
Defense Department to fund research on pediatric brain tumors following letter co-signed by Kelly
Rep. Kelly issued the following statement on Thursday after the House of Representatives passed
the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2016
by a bipartisan vote of 278-149. The bill includes language
requested
by Rep. Kelly to prohibit any funding by the Department of Defense (DoD) for the implementation of the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) unless the treaty receives the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate. The legislation also
directs
the "Peer-Reviewed Cancer Research Program" (part of the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs administered by DoD) to fund research on pediatric brain tumors, a result of
a bipartisan letter
to the chairman and ranking member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense co-signed by Rep. Kelly.
"I am very pleased that the House has passed today's bill to fund our national defense, provide support for our military's missions abroad, and give our troops and their families a well-deserved pay raise. I am particularly glad that this legislation contains two provisions that my office fought to include. First, the bill continues the ban on federal funding for the UN ATT, which will help keep our sovereignty secure and our Constitutional rights protected from this dangerous treaty. Second, the bill ensures that the Pentagon will once again fund critical research on pediatric brain tumors in order to one day eradicate this horrendous, heart-breaking disease for good."
BACKGROUND:
Rep. Kelly is a national leader of the movement to stop the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). On March 15, 2013, he
introduced
H. Con. Res. 23, a
bipartisan concurrent resolution
expressing opposition to the treaty on behalf of members of Congress. The resolution earned 149 co-sponsors in the House and 36 supporters in the Senate.
On May 30, 2013,
Rep. Kelly submitted
a
bipartisan letter
with 130 co-signers from Congress to both President Obama and Secretary Kerry urging them to reject the treaty. He sent
a similar bipartisan letter
to the president following Secretary Kerry's signing of the treaty on October 15, 2013, which was signed by 181 members of Congress, including multiple committee chairmen. A
follow-up letter was sent to the White House
on April, 20, 2014.
On September 5, 2014, Rep. Kelly submitted
a letter
to President Obama voicing opposition to the planned First Conference of State Parties (CSP) to the ATT - a UN-backed gathering to shape the treaty's future - due to its exclusion of any organizations critical of the treaty.
On December 16, 2014, President Obama signed into law
the Omnibus Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2015 , which includes a ban on federal funding for the ATT's implementation. The president signed the final version of
the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2015
(H.R. 3979) on December 19, 2014, which included a similar ban.
On March 2, 2015, Rep. Kelly sent
a letter to President Obama co-signed by 34 new members of Congress
elected in 2014 to express unified opposition to the ATT and a firm commitment to deny any federal funding for the treaty's implementation.
On March 25, 2015, Rep. Kelly
authored and submitted four separate letters
to the bipartisan leaders of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, the Subcommittee on Homeland Security, the Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs, and the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies requesting updated language prohibiting federal funding for the ATT in each of the subcommittees' respective appropriation bills. Each letter was co-signed by 90 members of Congress.
