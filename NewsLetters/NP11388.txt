Dear
Friend,
Taxpayers with a 2013 Adjusted Gross Income of $58,000 or less, are
eligible to prepare, complete, and file their taxes online at no cost through
the IRS Free File program. Since 2003, this service has saved
taxpayers an estimated 1.2 billion dollars.
Please click here to learn more about the IRS Free File
program.
If you or someone you know needs
assistance filing their taxes, the
Volunteer Income Tax
Assistance
(VITA) program or
Tax Counseling for
the Elderly
(TCE) service, may be able to help. The VITA Program
offers tax counseling to those earning an Adjusted Gross Income of
$52,000 or less, while TCE provides tax support to those 60 years of age
and above.
To locate a VITA and TCE site near you,

. Each program is staffed by IRS-certified
volunteers and many will be open until the IRS filing deadline on April
15 th .
As always, if you have any questions or
need help with a federal agency, feel free to contact my office at
801-486-1236. I am honored to serve in Congress on behalf of Utah families
like yours. As your representative, I always appreciate hearing from
you on current topics and issues affecting you and our community.
Please
let me know
areas you find especially
interesting or where I can provide you with additional information. I value
your ideas and look forward to hearing from
you.
Sincerely,
U.S. Representative
4th
