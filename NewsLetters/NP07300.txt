Addressing Important Veterans
Issues
8/6/14
This week, Congressman Doug Lamborn has been focused on
issues important to our brave veterans.
"It was honor to dialogue with so many veterans this week. I
remain committed to doing everything possible to ensure that our brave
veterans receive the care and respect they have earned. The reforms
recently passed in Congress are an important first step on the road to
reform. I encourage any veteran experiencing difficulties with the
federal government to please contact my office, we will do everything
possible to assist you." - Congressman Doug
Lamborn
The Congressman spent a significant portion
of his latest interview with AM 740 KVOR's Richard Randall discussing
the VA Reform legislation recently passed by
Congress.

Congressman Lamborn attended a
House
Veterans Affairs Committee Field Hearing in New Mexico. The hearing discussed
the challenges rural veterans face in accessing VA care and mental
health care.

On Wednesday, August 6th, Deputy VA
Secretary Sloan Gibson visited Denver. Thanks to Dale Anderson for
attending from my staff. Between the Field Hearing on access to care for
rural veterans that I attended and this meeting, we received many
important pieces of information that we'll soon be sharing with our
veterans.
I met this week
with the team from Angels of America's Fallen. This great local
non-profit works to mentor and stand with the children of fallen military
and first responders.
It was an honor to meet with military
widow Chris Kinnard. She shared with me important information on
legislation regarding surviving military spousal
benefits.
