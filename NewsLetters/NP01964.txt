Forbes: Will Administration Risk American Lives Against Terrorists Exchanged for Bergdahl?
Washington, D.C.
- Congressman J. Randy Forbes (VA-04), Chairman of the House Armed Services Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, released the following statement on the desertion charges filed against Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl:
As the charges against Sgt. Bergdahl move forward in our military justice system, the question remains whether this Administration is prepared to put more American lives at risk to pursue the terrorists who were released from our custody in exchange for Sgt. Bergdahl? I find it unconscionable that this Administration was willing to release five sworn enemies of this country and potentially place more American lives at risk when these terrorists inevitably resume their war against the United States. That more American military personnel will likely be in jeopardy because of this prisoner exchange is simply a tragedy.
Congressman Forbes
raised
this issue with then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel at a House Armed Services Committee hearing on June 11, 2014.
