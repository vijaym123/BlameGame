Dear Friends,
The past five
years have brought dramatic changes to West Virginia's energy
economy, and on Thursday, I spoke about the future of West Virginia energy at
the governor's West Virginia: Committed to a Sound Energy Future
Summit in Roanoke, W.Va.
Coal jobs are threatened by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, which is finalizing its new greenhouse
gas rule on existing coal-fired power plants. With this unprecedented
rule, the EPA has gone far beyond requiring existing coal plants
operate as efficiently as possible. Instead, the very framework for this
rule is built around shifting the country away from
coal.
The federal government has no business picking winners and losers in the
energy economy, but thats exactly what the EPAs new rule would
do.
President Obamas energy policies have serious consequences
for our economy. First, the policies destroy direct jobs in the
mining industry. We have seen thousands of layoffs as mines close here in
West Virginia and in our neighboring states.
Second, the
policies increase energy prices for individuals, inflating electric bills
for seniors on fixed incomes and others who can least afford the
added expense.
Finally, increased energy prices will make
American manufacturers less competitive in the global
market.
West Virginia energy holds the promise of American energy independence,
but we need policies that embrace an all-of-the-above energy strategy.
With the turmoil in the Middle East, now is not the time to be saying
no to abundant American energy like that produced in West
Virginia.
One of the keys to American energy independence is natural
gas, which has transformed Northern West Virginia. The transport and
export of liquefied natural gas opens up new markets for West Virginia
natural gas and creates jobs here at home.
In order to
secure West Virginia's energy future, we must implement policies that
create jobs, produce affordable energy here at home, and embrace available
energy sources.
As I continue to serve as your
representative in Washington, I will keep up the fight to pass legislation that
will protect the good jobs in this important West Virginia industry. I
will fight for American energy production that keeps electricity
affordable for our families and our small businesses.
And I will
continue to make West Virginias voice heard during the important
debates on energy policies that will shape our state and our nation for
years to come.
HONORING OUR FIRST RESPONDERS
The
Charleston Public Safety Councils Salute to Public Safety awards honor
police, firefighters, EMS and 911 operators for outstanding public
service. It was my privilege to attend Tuesday's lunceon celebration,
congratulate each of the winners and thank them for their work to keep our
community safe.
HEROES OF MAIN STREET
AWARD
On
Thursday, I was honored to receive the Heroes of Main Street award from
the West Virginia Retailers Association.
David Broyles,
vice president of Calvin Broyles Jewelers, and Bridget Lambert,
president of the West Virginia Retailers Association, presented the award on
behalf of the National Retail Federation.
Small businesses
on Main Streets across West Virginia provide good jobs, invest in our
communities and keep our downtowns alive. Shopping at small businesses
helps keep dollars in West Virginia and supports homegrown shops and
enterprises. As a member of Congress, I have always fought for policies
that help small Main Street businesses thrive and grow, and I will
continue to work to preserve West Virginias tradition of
entrepreneurship and local investment .
Thank you for reading my
weekly
e-newsletter, which will resume on Nov. 14. In the
meantime, you can join in the conversation on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Shelley
