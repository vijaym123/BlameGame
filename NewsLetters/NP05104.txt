-- Key Senate races are beginning to break toward Democrats with just 7 days left. But
PBS
reports the races are SO close: &ldquo;10 are still within 5 points in the polls and 5 of those are within just 3 points.&rdquo;
Here&rsquo;s the most important piece of this email:
&ldquo;A good turnout operation can add one or two points, and in a tight race... that could make the difference.&rdquo; -

With YOUR help, we can fund our enormous FINAL Get Out The Vote Weekend and win the Senate! But if you don&rsquo;t help and we can&rsquo;t fund our massive, unprecedented turnout operation, we&rsquo;re looking at 2 years or more of a Mitch McConnell-led Republican Senate.

The Senate battle will be so close, but with your help, we can squeak out a victory.
Imagine this: McConnell could actually be gone in exactly one week. His ability to filibuster our progress would be OVER. But to make it happen, we need YOU to step up before the end-of-month deadline.
TRIPLE-MATCH: Will you pitch in before the LAST end-of-month deadline of the election in 72 hours?
Let&rsquo;s do this!
