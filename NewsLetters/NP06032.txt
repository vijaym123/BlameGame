Congressman Lamborn Supports Call
for Independent VA Audit
9/24/14
Today, House
Speaker John Boehner released a letter he has sent to VA Secretary Bob
McDonald calling for action on an independent audit of the VA healthcare
system.
I commend Speaker
Boehner for reaching out directly to the VA Secretary on behalf of
the strong VA reform legislation that I supported last month. Sadly, the
trust between veterans and the VA has been placed in serious
jeopardy. Thats why it is so critical to have an independent audit of our VA
healthcare system. This audit is required by law and the VA needs to
stop delaying in implementing this important step. We cannot make
progress toward real VA reform without
it.

Text of the Speaker's
Letter
September 22,
2014
The
Honorable Bob McDonald
Secretary
of Veterans Affairs
810
Vermont Avenue, Northwest
Washington, DC
20420
Dear Mr.
Secretary:
Veterans across the country deserve
access to timely, quality health care. Transforming the Department of
Veterans Affairs from an outdated government bureaucracy to a 21st
Century model of service and responsiveness is essential to achieving that
goal. With this objective in mind, I write to express my support for
the independent assessment required under the legislation that recently
passed both the House and Senate, and to emphasize the importance of
providing veterans with an evaluation that is both effective and truly
independent.
As I and other House leaders told President Obama in a letter
earlier this year, the VA is a system that needs to be fundamentally
transformed in order to meet its mandate of service and care to our
nations veterans. I am encouraged the president has chosen as the new
VA secretary a strong leader with decades of experience in the private
sector, which is necessary to oversee the kind of dramatic change that
is needed and long
overdue.
As I know you are aware, the Veterans Access,
Choice, and Accountability Act (H.R. 3230) requires an independent
assessment of the health care delivery systems and management processes
at the VA. This top-to-bottom audit requires you to enter into a
contract with one or more entities to examine every aspect of hospital care
and medical services provided by the VA. The audit is a critical
component of the new law and will help identify long-term reforms to
improve the quality and access to care for our
veterans.
The intent of the
independent assessment is to gain valuable feedback that can be used to
help transform the VA into an effective, 21st Century model of service.
Accordingly, it is critical that the review rely not on traditional
government consultants, but on private sector entities with experience
in the successful delivery of modern, quality health
care.
Including
private sector health care entities who may collectively benchmark
their health systems with the VA will help identify variances between the
strengths and weaknesses of the existing systems. The entities
should, of course, be recognized leaders of excellence in quality and timely
health care
delivery.
Congress acted to provide the VA with additional
resources and the authority to hold senior officials accountable in the
wake of the VA scandal.
But passage of this law is just the
beginning. The independent assessment is a step toward fully understanding
the systemic problems and ultimately transforming the VA from top to
bottom and into the system veterans deserve.
It must be
conducted by individuals who are both truly independent of the existing system
and versed in the knowledge of how effective, modern health care
delivery systems are
run.
I look forward to your response as we work to
improve the care and services our veterans
deserve.
Sincerely,
John
Boehner
Speaker
