Demand economic security for women &gt;&gt;
Simply put, many of our economic policies are doing more harm than good for women and families.
It&rsquo;s time for us to step up and demand more economic opportunity and security. It&rsquo;s good for women, it&rsquo;s good for families, and it&rsquo;s good for communities in Illinois and across the country.

David --
When families are strong, our communities are strong. But many of our economic policies regarding women and working families are outdated and backwards.
Cheri is leading the fight for change. She believes families should have access to affordable, quality child care and paid sick leave, earn a living wage, and get equal pay for equal work.
Will you stand with Cheri and expand economic opportunity for women and all working families?
David, it&rsquo;s 2015. It&rsquo;s time for women and families to have the opportunities and security they not only need, but deserve. http://act.cheribustos.com/economic-opportunity
