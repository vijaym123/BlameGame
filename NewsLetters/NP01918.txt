Dear Friend, Spring is finally here!
As a parent, I know it can sometimes be a challenge to find rewarding and safe activities for our children during the warmer months.
That&rsquo;s why I am pleased to join with the Marion County Commission on Youth (MCCOY) to make it easier for Indianapolis families to find these opportunities. Please join us on April 8, 2015 for the second annual Youth Opportunities Fair.
It will take place from 4-7 p.m. at Shortridge Magnet High School, and is free and open (no registration required) to anyone who wants to attend.
The goal of the Youth Opportunities Fair is to present students and parents with a variety of summer options so they can explore different possibilities before the end of the school year.
In addition to job opportunities for our youth, this event will feature local service providers and other groups that offer youth summer programs, internships and volunteer opportunities.
For two decades, MCCOY has been working to help empower every young person in Marion County to be successful. It&rsquo;s a privilege to partner with them for this event. I hope you&rsquo;ll join us on April 8 at Shortridge Magnet High School to find out more about what Indianapolis has to offer our young people this summer &ndash; and how they can give back to our great city.
