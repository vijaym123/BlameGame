Rep. Lipinski Invites Third District
Residents
to Upcoming Town Hall Meeting in Countryside on
4/23
and Senior Fair in Lemont on 4/27
Rep.
Lipinski addresses constituent concerns at a Town Hall Meeting in Willow
Springs.
In the next week, Congressman Dan
Lipinski (IL-3) will be hosting a Town Hall Meeting in Countryside and
a Senior Fair in Lemont.
At the Town Hall Meeting,
Third District residents will be able to hear from Rep. Lipinski about
his work on their behalf at home and in Washington, as well as ask
questions and voice their opinions about federal issues.
Staff from
the Congressmans office will be available beginning one hour prior to
the start of the meeting to provide assistance with Medicare, Social
Security, veterans benefits, and other federal
matters.
The Senior Fair will give seniors from the Third District an opportunity
to get assistance with a variety of issues from the Congressmans
expert staff, as well as local organizations, agencies, and businesses
that provide services to seniors.
I encourage residents of the Third District to come to my
upcoming Town Hall Meeting and Senior Fair, said Rep. Lipinski.
As
your representative in Washington and someone who strives to improve the
quality of life in the communities I serve, it is critical that I
hear from you.
In addition, these events will be great
opportunities for you to get assistance with federal issues and learn about the
wide array of constituent services my office provides.
It is my
privilege to serve
you.
And always remember
that if you are not able to make it to these events you can always
call or stop by any of my offices in Chicago, Lockport, Oak Lawn, or
