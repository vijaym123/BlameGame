WEEK IN REVIEW
I spent the first two days of this week in
Little Rock, where on Monday, I joined the Northwest Arkansas Chapter of
the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Association to tour the J.
Thomas May Center for ALS Research at the University of Arkansas for
Medical Sciences (UAMS). While there is currently no cure for ALS, I
was very impressed by the research being done at UAMS and the steps
they are taking to find one. Thanks to the NWA Chapter for inviting me to
come with you!
My
Tuesday started off bright and early with a visit to the 96.5 The Voice
studio to join guest host and my longtime friend, Rex Nelson, live on
the Alice Stewart Show. Afterwards, I headed to Arkansas Lighthouse for
the Blind (ALB), where I toured the facility, met many of the ALB
employees, and was presented with the AbilityOne Champion Award, which I
proudly accepted. This national award is given to members of Congress
in recognition of their support for the AbilityOne program and
community-based agencies, like ALB. Thank you to the tremendous team at ALB,
as well as the staff with National Industries for the Blind, for this
exceptional honor. I commend them for providing invaluable employment
and training opportunities that enable blind or visually impaired
Americans to gain economic and personal independence.
I wrapped up my visit to Arkansass
capital city by joining Arkansas Independent Producers and Royalty
Owners (AIPRO) at their annual meeting to give a legislative update and
speak about energy policy. Arkansas is an energy state. Since
Arkansass first natural gas well was drilled in 1889, oil and gas has
played a dominant role in our economy. Today, one-third of our
counties produce oil or natural gas, and the industry directly and
indirectly supports 92,000 jobs. By 2030, we have the potential to add
94,000 more if we capitalize on Americas energy renaissance and support
an all-of-the-above energy policy. But doing so will require
reducing and eliminating the duplicative and costly regulatory burdens
getting the federal government out of the way
so our independent
producers can increase energy production, paving a path to greater U.S.
energy and national security and lower energy prices for hardworking
Americans, and I will continue to support policies that make this
possible. Thanks to AIPRO for inviting me to speak to you, and thank you to
my friend, Representative James Lankford (OK-5), who joined me at the
meeting during his trip to Little Rock that day.
On Wednesday, I welcomed John
Ogden and the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors
(NAIFA) to my Rogers office. NAIFA represents more than 70,000 insurance
and financial advisors nationwide, and I appreciate hearing from a
few of them from the Northwest Arkansas Chapter. Thanks for coming
by!
I spent Thursday
in North Carolina at Fort Bragg to attend my sister-in-law's Army
retirement ceremony.
LTC Sherry-Lynn Womack is an Army medic
specifically, an Army Physicians Assistant (PA)
retiring after 33 years
of service. Her accolades include a Bronze Star and a Meritorious
Service Medal, and she served two tours of combat during Operation Enduring
Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Sherry-Lynn has been
memorialized in the U.S. Army Women's Museum for being the first female PA to
accompany Special Forces soldiers into theater, where she laid the
foundation for the Army's attention and sensitivity to cultural constraints
in the region by gathering intel through her relationships with the
Afghan women and children. Thank you for your service, LTC Womack, and
happy retirement!
Today, Im back in the Third District and will be heading to Tiger
Stadium to cheer on Bentonville High and Rogers High in tonights
game. Go Tigers, and go Mounties!
