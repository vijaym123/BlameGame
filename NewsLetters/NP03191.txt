Joining a
Bipartisan Movement to Protect U.S. Waters From Federal
Overreach
1/29/15
This week, Congressman Doug Lamborn joined a
bipartisan list of over one hundred Members of Congress in cosponsoring H.R.
594, the Waters of the United States Regulatory Overreach Protection
Act. This legislation, introduced by Congressman Paul Gosar
(AZ-04), prohibits the EPA from drastically expanding their power by using a
new rule to expand the current definition of navigable waters. This
rule would hurt family farms, small businesses, energy production,
commercial development and substantially interfere with the ability of
individual landowners to use their property.

594, please click

"It is not
the role of the Obama Administration to arbitrarily expand the
regulatory mandate of the EPA. This bipartisan legislation prevents the EPA
from using the Clean Water Act to assert rule-making authority over
virtually any body of water in the United States. Despite the fact that
the Supreme Court has ruled against the power hungry desires of the
EPA, the Obama Administration is still moving forward. This is a
dangerous overreach that will have numerous adverse economic impacts if
allowed to proceed. I applaud Congressman Gosar for his leadership and I
look forward to passing this legislation in the near
future."
