Wicker
Challenges Internet Rules, White House
Overreach
FCC Decision Joins Litany of Excessive Bureaucratic Actions
Threatening Jobs,
Innovation
Costly regulations often make news headlines when related to
Obamacare and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
two major
examples of onerous bureaucratic overreach.
However, the power grabs do
not stop there, as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
recently demonstrated.
Late last month, the independent agency ruled
that the Internet should be treated like a public utility, laying the
groundwork for widespread federal
regulation.
Forcing Consumers
to Pay the Price
The
FCC's 400-page ruling follows public pressure from the Obama
Administration to take a heavy-handed and unnecessary approach toward Internet
service.
The Internet has flourished for years with minimal
government interference.
Now, the so-called "net neutrality" rules
would apply outdated regulation
originally designed for telephone
monopolies
to 21st-century cyberspace.
Many fear that the
controversial move could severely discourage innovation and investment, which
have long energized the tech economy.
Even Democrats appointed
to the commission raised concerns with the ruling's
process.
I anticipate that the FCC's actions will
be challenged in court, involving years and years of litigation and
uncertainty for job creators and innovators.
A better response
might be a bipartisan legislative solution involving a set of broad
guidelines and a "light touch" regulatory approach.
This would help
consumers avoid unnecessary regulations, taxes, and fees.
As
Chairman of the Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation, and
the Internet, I will remain actively involved in the FCCs
oversight.
Removing Barriers to Economic
Growth
There are already efforts in Congress
to examine the economic impact of intrusive government regulation in
general.
With the size of the U.S. workforce at a historic low and
the economy still weak, removing barriers to growth is a sensible,
job-creating strategy.
We should not underestimate the negative
effects of the Administration's extreme regulatory agenda.
So far
this year, the government has imposed more than $30 billion in
compliance costs and 13.5 million paperwork hours on the U.S. economy.
A survey by the National Small Business Association revealed that
small businesses spend on average more than $15,000 a year complying with
the President's health-care law alone.
Weighing
Costs and Benefits
One
bill I have cosponsored, introduced by Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.),
would require federal agencies to conduct cost-benefit analyses on new
regulations.
Proposed EPA rules on ground ozone levels, for
example, threaten to slash economic growth by trillions of dollars and cost
millions of jobs without yielding substantial environmental benefits.
Under Sen. Roberts's "Regulatory Responsibility for Our Economy
Act," the agency would have to assess these actions, justify the
economic costs, and allow for stakeholder input.
Another bill I support, titled the "Regulatory
Improvement Act," would create a commission to review outdated regulations
and contradictory government mandates.
The bipartisan measure,
introduced by Sens. Angus King (I-Maine) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), would
help pinpoint red tape that can be streamlined, consolidated, or
repealed.
These reviews would give special consideration to regulations
that affect small
businesses.
Unleashing the U.S. workforce and encouraging ingenuity will
require an honest assessment of government regulatory overreach, which
continues to be a major obstacle to job creation.
It is staggering
to think that 80 of the 3,500 finalized rules last year would each have
an annual economic impact of at least $100 million.
Minimizing
these economic burdens can make a big difference in Americans' lives,
empowering entrepreneurs
not the government
to be the drivers of
our continued success.
