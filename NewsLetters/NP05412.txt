Kansas Common Sense
October 14, 2014
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thanks for your continued interest in
receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them. Due to a software
update, I was unable to distribute the newsletter yesterday. Thank you
for your patience.
Ebola Screening Boosted
The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is a health crisis of massive
proportions. With no proven vaccine or treatment currently available
and with the outbreak continuing to escalate, fear and concern have
risen across the globe. The death Wednesday of the patient who was the
first diagnosed case of Ebola in the United States reiterates the need
to heighten coordination and vigilance to address this health crisis.
While Ebola is not easily transmitted, it is important that we fully
utilize our public health infrastructure to detect possible infections,
as well as safely screen, isolate and treat any patients who may need
care. Our health care providers have the training and equipment needed
to control infections and protect themselves and others when caring for
Ebola patients.
The West African Ebola outbreak is devastating and unprecedented, but
it can be stopped now by helping Africans before it seriously threatens
our country. The single most important thing that can be done to
protect Americans is to stop Ebola at its source. But, as we fight
Ebola abroad, we need to make certain our homeland is protected as
well. On Monday, I called on the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention
(CDC) Director Dr. Tom Frieden to implement
Ebola-specific screenings at U.S. airports. I was pleased that the
Administration announced on Wednesday that enhanced screening measures
will be implemented at high-traffic U.S. airports. Given Ebola's long
incubation period, entry screenings are not the full solution, but this
is a step in the right direction.
Additionally, this week I urged President Obama to designate a single,
senior administrator
to be responsible for coordinating all U.S. agencies and
policies involving the international and domestic response to Ebola. My
letter to the President included several questions regarding the
interagency coordination involved in the response efforts. As a member
of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I want to make certain
resources are being allocated efficiently across the agencies
responsible for the Ebola response in West Africa and disease control
activities at home. I am also concerned that a clear organizational
structure and chain of command for this interagency mission have not
been sufficiently established by the Administration and communicated to
the American people.
Ebola can be stopped, but to do so requires both effective containment
action and basic medical care. With the right international response
and coordination, appropriate patient care can be provided efficiently
and the spread of infection can be halted. Ebola does not have to be a
death sentence, but leadership and global cooperation are required to
meet this serious challenge. Early Saturday morning, Dr. Tom Frieden
called me to discuss the current situation and U.S. efforts. I will
continue working with the CDC and other agencies to monitor the
national and international responses to this outbreak.
Administration Needs to Consider Impact of Regulations on Rural Health
Care Providers and Visiting Decatur Health Systems in Oberlin
On Thursday, I expressed concern to the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) Director Marilyn Tavenner
along with a bipartisan group of 33 senators that federal
regulations for health care facilities do not adequately consider their
impact on rural communities. CMS is the division of the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services (HHS) responsible for administering
Medicare and Medicaid. As Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations
Health Subcommittee, I included language in the 2014 omnibus
appropriations bill directing HHS to better account for the realities
of delivering rural health care in its regulatory rulemaking. Since
that time, I remain concerned with a number of regulations that have
created problems for rural health care providers. In the letter, I
pressed CMS for details about how the agency is incorporating rural
health care experts in the regulatory rulemaking process. I also called
on CMS to explain its process for accounting for the rural impact of
such regulations as well as its engagement with rural health
stakeholders during rulemaking. HHS must allow rural providers the
flexibility necessary to adequately care for their patients, many of
whom are older and live across wide areas.
On Tuesday morning I was in Oberlin to visit Decatur Health Systems
(DHS). DHS is a 24-bed Critical Access Hospital (CAH) with a rural
health clinic and 37-bed extended care unit. The hospital provides a
wide-range of services to residents of Decatur County and the
surrounding area. During my time representing Kansans in Washington,
D.C., I have had the pleasure of visiting each of the 128 community
hospitals in Kansas. Meeting with Kansas hospital administrators,
physicians, nurses, and other providers gives me insight on the unique
challenges they face caring for patients in rural settings across our
state.
My discussion with DHS administrators and staff spanned various topics
including concerns with the increasing federal regulatory burden on
providers, proposed changes in Medicare reimbursements and the
consequences to CAHs. Any policies that threaten the survival of these
hospitals endanger Kansans' access to health care in their own
communities and could severely ration care in rural America. I continue
to oppose these and other policy proposals that would
disproportionately affect health care access in Kansas and other rural
states. Thanks to DHS CEO Johnathan Owens for hosting my visit.
Questioning the Department Of Justice's Operation Choke Point
This week, I, along with several of my colleagues on the Senate
Banking Committee, called on the Department of Justice (DoJ)
to demand answers regarding a DoJ-led effort that is
negatively impacting law-abiding and legitimate businesses by choking
them off from the banking sector, known as "Operation Choke Point."
Late last summer, I was made aware of reports regarding Operation Choke
Point and how it has been targeting certain industries' ability to
access banking services and the payments system without first
demonstrating that a company is breaking the law. The effort is causing
banks to deny or terminate credit lines, close bank accounts, and
prevent payment processing due to fear of DoJ subpoenas or unjustified
regulatory action by federal banking regulators.
We raised continuing concerns that the DoJ operation is inappropriately
targeting certain business models and is politicizing the payment
system and access to credit markets. The Obama Administration's use of
financial regulators to harass industries it dislikes sets a troubling
precedent. Rather than discussing the underlying concerns that led the
DoJ to launch Operation Choke Point, this Administration has chosen to
circumvent the process, using its tremendous power to pursue what looks
to be a political agenda. It is time for our questions to be answered
so that lawful American businesses can get back to working without fear
of an unaccountable federal bureaucrat.
Big Red One Deployment to Iraq
On Tuesday, I called on Department of Defense (DoD) Secretary Chuck
Hagel
to explain operations and the authorization of military
force in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria
(ISIS) in Iraq. With the deployment of 500 soldiers from the 1st
Infantry Division headquarters - The Big Red One - of Fort Riley, Kan.,
I expressed my concern about their safety and security in an undefined
campaign that does not appropriately recognize their participation and
service in these operations. I requested that the Secretary provide
concrete answers by October 21, 2014, pertaining to the roles and
missions for Big Red One soldiers and other U.S. military forces
serving in the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.
In addition, the DoD has made conflicting statements about this
untitled campaign against ISIS. The back-and-forth messaging clearly
draws attention to the Administration's haphazard planning, which
wrongs our U.S. forces who deserve proper credit and recognition when
they readily serve our country. When sending soldiers into harm's way,
a clear path and plan should be defined for their service. Their desire
to serve should be matched by the Administration's desire to define
their roles and missions against a legal framework that authorizes
their service in defense of our country. I will continue to press DoD
and the Administration for an explanation on the use of military force
in Iraq and Syria because our nation's bravest and their families
deserve an honest understanding of what their loved ones must face on
behalf of our nation.
Montgomery County Meeting to Discuss Closing Amazon Operation
Thursday afternoon, I joined Governor Brownback and members of his
cabinet, State Senator Jeff King, Rep. Rich Proehl, Rep. Jim Kelly,
Rep. Virgil Peck, Montgomery County Action Council Director Aaron
Heckman, and an organized group of concerned civic and elected
officials from across Montgomery County to discuss how to handle last
week's announcement that Amazon is moving their operation from
Southeast Kansas. It was a standing-room only crowd of about 150 area
residents. Governor Brownback pledged his commitment to recovery, and
members of his cabinet offered programs to help with job placement and
training. I have reached out to the U.S. Department of Labor and the
U.S. Department of Commerce, and will continue to look for ways to
assist and help this rural community persevere. Thanks to Governor
Brownback and State Senator Jeff King for inviting me to take part in
the meeting.
Joining Kansas City Entrepreneurs for "Rise of the Rest" Tour
On Thursday, I joined entrepreneurs from the Kansas City area as they
hosted AOL Founder Steve Case and the Rise of the Rest Tour. In an
effort to highlight entrepreneurial activity and encourage more
collaboration in communities across the Midwest, Steve Case embarked on
a five-day tour. He visited Kansas City on Thursday and he opened the
day's activities with a round table discussion. My message to the
participants is that we should work to foster entrepreneurship and
innovation in Kansas City. With the power of technology and a broadband
connection, entrepreneurs can pursue their ideas anywhere, not just in
places most Americans traditionally think of startups existing like
Boston, Austin, or Silicon Valley. Following the discussion, the group
visited the Kansas City Startup Village, the Sprint Accelerator, and
the Kauffman Foundation. The finale of the day's activities culminated
in a pitch competition where Kansas City startups presented their ideas
for a chance to win prizes. Congrats to search-based startup Leap.it
for taking home the grand prize and a trip to SXSW 2015. To view photos
from the Kansas City events, please click here
. Thank you to
Ryan Weber of KCNext for helping to arrange the visit, and to Steve
Case for his endless support of helping entrepreneurs achieve success.

Kansas Listening Tour Stops Continue
On Monday and Tuesday, I hosted six town hall meetings in Western
Kansas including Logan, Wallace, Cheyenne, Rawlins, Decatur and
Sheridan Counties. On Saturday, I also hosted a town hall meeting in
Lyon County. See below a summary and photos from each stop. Thanks to
all the area residents who came out to share their feedback on how to
improve Kansas and the nation. For a full listing of my upcoming Kansas
Listening Tour stops, visit my website
.
Logan County
My first stop was in Oakley at the Northwest Kansas Educational
Services Center. We had a good discussion about overregulation, the
threat of ISIS, the legislative process and the Ebola response. Thanks
to Tricia Runkle for coordinating my visit.
Wallace County
In Sharon Springs, we discussed the need for a functioning Senate,
veterans' issues and the importance of Critical Access Hospitals.
Thanks to Jayne Pearce for helping to coordinate my visit.
Cheyenne County
In Saint Francis, we discussed a number of issues including
agriculture, the Clean Water Act rule, education and costly EPA
regulations. Thanks to Kale Dankenbring and Heidi Plumb for allowing me
to host the event at their coffee shop, Fresh Seven Coffee.
Rawlins County
The conversation in Atwood centered around immigration, Medicare,
dysfunction in the Senate, overregulation, transportation, and keeping
our freedoms alive and well. I appreciated Lee Skiles for allowing me
to host the conversation with about 25 area residents at Mojo Espresso
& Bistro.
Decatur County
In Oberlin at the Gateway Civic Center, the nearly 70 attendees
included students from Decatur Community Junior/Senior High School. We
discussed a number of issues facing Kansas and the nation, but the
focus was the importance of education and affordable student loans.
Thanks to John Sater for the hosting my visit. Here, I'm pictured with
Sarah Fredrickson (upper right), Ralph and Norma Unger (upper left) and
Decatur Community Junior/Senior High School Seniors who are members of
Student Council. Thanks again to John Sater for the hosting my visit.

Sheridan County
My last stop in Western Kansas was in Hoxie at JD's. We discussed the
lesser prairie chicken, agriculture, transportation, access to health
care, keeping rural America alive and the tax code. Thanks to Terry
Feldt for helping to coordinate my visit.
Lyon County
On Saturday, I hosted a town hall meeting at PraireLand Partners in
Emporia. Nearly 30 Lyon County area residents joined me to discuss
important issues like education, rural broadband, health care, Ebola
and the ISIS threat. We also shared an update on the progress of
restoring Reading's post office. Thanks to PrairieLand Partners' Paul
du Toit for hosting the meeting. Here, I'm pictured with Lyon County
Commissioner Scott Briggs and State Senator Jeff Longbine.
Oberlin Rotary Club
On Tuesday over the noon hour, I spoke to members of Oberlin Rotary
Club at the Gateway Civic Center and thanked them for their service to
the community. I believe service organizations like Rotary Club improve
Kansas communities. Thanks to John Sater for the hosting my visit.
Parsons Noon Rotary Club
I was in Southeast Kansas on Thursday where I visited with the Noon
Rotary Club in Parsons. My keynote address touched on the importance of
keeping rural communities thriving and my efforts to make certain
veterans have access to health care. Thanks to Parsons Rotary Club
President Peter Cook for allowing me to speak, Ann Charles of Great
Plains Industrial Park for the kind introduction, and to Dr. Wayne
Gilmore for setting up my visit.
Congratulating Six New Eagle Scouts
More than 115 million boys have participated in Boy Scouts over its
100 year history, but only about four percent of them have become Eagle
Scouts. I had the privilege of congratulating six of the newest Eagle
Scouts over the weekend during an Eagle Scout ceremony in Leawood. To
become an Eagle Scout, a scout must demonstrate his leadership, service
and outdoor skills. He must earn a minimum of 21 merit badges, take on
a leadership role in his Boy Scout troop and develop and complete a
service project for his local community.
A recent Gallup survey of Eagle Scouts, former Boy Scouts and men who
never joined scouting, found that America's Eagles are far more engaged
with the world around them in almost every way-in community service,
club membership, attending church, outdoor recreation, and in the
fields of education and health. That is precisely what the Boy Scouts
of America aims - to develop responsible and engaged citizens. Through
the Boy Scouts, young men are being equipped with skills that will help
them become successful in life. I enjoyed being a part of this special
ceremony and want to congratulate Isaac, William, Andrew, Calvin, Jacob
and Dane on a tremendous and impressive achievement.
Now Accepting Spring 2015 Internship Applications
I am now accepting applications for paid congressional internships in
my Washington, D.C., and Kansas offices for spring 2015. An internship
in my office - either legislative or communications - provides a unique
opportunity to work closely with Senate staff on behalf of the state of
Kansas. Legislative interns will gain a better understanding of the
legislative process in the U.S. Congress, and develop knowledge and
professional skills valuable to future career pursuits. Communications
internships offer an intern the chance to learn about how political
communications and the legislative process intersect, and gain
practical knowledge about the inner workings of a fast-paced press
office.
The application deadline for spring 2015 is November 1, 2014.
Applications may be obtained and completed under the "Services" section
of my website at www.moran.senate.gov
. Applicants should submit a completed application form, resume,
academic transcript, two letters of recommendation, and a cover letter
explaining their interest in public service and addressing a policy
issue of personal importance and a suggested recommendation to resolve
that issue. Please submit required materials to:
internships@moran.senate.gov.

Kansas
Common
Sense
October
14,
2014
Hello,
Welcome
to
"Kansas
Common
Sense."
Thanks
for
your
continued
interest
in
receiving
my
weekly
newsletter.
Please
feel
free
to
forward
it
on
to
your
family
and
friends
if
it
would
interest
them.
Due
to
a
software
update,
I
was
unable
to
distribute
the
newsletter
yesterday.
Thank
you
for
your
patience.
Ebola
Screening
Boosted
The
Ebola
outbreak
in
West
Africa
is
a
health
crisis
of
massive
proportions.
With
no
proven
vaccine
or
treatment
currently
available
and
with
the
outbreak
continuing
to
escalate,
fear
and
concern
have
risen
across
the
globe.
The
death
Wednesday
of
the
patient
who
was
the
first
diagnosed
case
of
Ebola
in
the
United
States
reiterates
the
need
to
heighten
coordination
and
vigilance
to
address
this
health
crisis.
While
Ebola
is
not
easily
transmitted,
it
is
important
that
we
fully
utilize
our
public
health
infrastructure
to
detect
possible
infections,
as
well
as
safely
screen,
isolate
and
treat
any
patients
who
may
need
care.
Our
health
care
providers
have
the
training
and
equipment
needed
to
control
infections
and
protect
themselves
and
others
when
caring
for
Ebola
patients.
The
West
African
Ebola
outbreak
is
devastating
and
unprecedented,
but
it
can
be
stopped
now
by
helping
Africans
before
it
seriously
threatens
our
country.
The
single
most
important
thing
that
can
be
done
to
protect
Americans
is
to
stop
Ebola
at
its
source.
But,
as
we
fight
Ebola
abroad,
we
need
to
make
certain
our
homeland
is
protected
as
well.
On
Monday,
I
called
on
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
(CDC)
Director
Dr.
Tom
Frieden
to
implement
Ebola-specific
screenings
at
U.S.
airports.
I
was
pleased
that
the
Administration
announced
on
Wednesday
that
enhanced
screening
measures
will
be
implemented
at
high-traffic
U.S.
airports.
Given
Ebola's
long
incubation
period,
entry
screenings
are
not
the
full
solution,
but
this
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction.
Additionally,
this
week
I
urged
President
Obama
to
designate
a
single,
senior
administrator
to
be
responsible
for
coordinating
all
U.S.
agencies
and
policies
involving
the
international
and
domestic
response
to
Ebola.
My
letter
to
the
President
included
several
questions
regarding
the
interagency
coordination
involved
in
the
response
efforts.
As
a
member
of
the
Senate
Appropriations
Committee,
I
want
to
make
certain
resources
are
being
allocated
efficiently
across
the
agencies
responsible
for
the
Ebola
response
in
West
Africa
and
disease
control
activities
at
home.
I
am
also
concerned
that
a
clear
organizational
structure
and
chain
of
command
for
this
interagency
mission
have
not
been
sufficiently
established
by
the
Administration
and
communicated
to
the
American
people.
Ebola
can
be
stopped,
but
to
do
so
requires
both
effective
containment
action
and
basic
medical
care.
With
the
right
international
response
and
coordination,
appropriate
patient
care
can
be
provided
efficiently
and
the
spread
of
infection
can
be
halted.
Ebola
does
not
have
to
be
a
death
sentence,
but
leadership
and
global
cooperation
are
required
to
meet
this
serious
challenge.
Early
Saturday
morning,
Dr.
Tom
Frieden
called
me
to
discuss
the
current
situation
and
U.S.
efforts.
I
will
continue
working
with
the
CDC
and
other
agencies
to
monitor
the
national
and
international
responses
to
this
outbreak.
Administration
Needs
to
Consider
Impact
of
Regulations
on
Rural
Health
Care
Providers
and
Visiting
Decatur
Health
Systems
in
Oberlin
On
Thursday,
I
expressed
concern
to
the
Centers
for
Medicare
and
Medicaid
Services
(CMS)
Director
Marilyn
Tavenner
along
with
a
bipartisan
group
of
33
senators
that
federal
regulations
for
health
care
facilities
do
not
adequately
consider
their
impact
on
rural
communities.
CMS
is
the
division
of
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
(HHS)
responsible
for
administering
Medicare
and
Medicaid.
As
Ranking
Member
of
the
Senate
Appropriations
Health
Subcommittee,
I
included
language
in
the
2014
omnibus
appropriations
bill
directing
HHS
to
better
account
for
the
realities
of
delivering
rural
health
care
in
its
regulatory
rulemaking.
Since
that
time,
I
remain
concerned
with
a
number
of
regulations
that
have
created
problems
for
rural
health
care
providers.
In
the
letter,
I
pressed
CMS
for
details
about
how
the
agency
is
incorporating
rural
health
care
experts
in
the
regulatory
rulemaking
process.
I
also
called
on
CMS
to
explain
its
process
for
accounting
for
the
rural
impact
of
such
regulations
as
well
as
its
engagement
with
rural
health
stakeholders
during
rulemaking.
HHS
must
allow
rural
providers
the
flexibility
necessary
to
adequately
care
for
their
patients,
many
of
whom
are
older
and
live
across
wide
areas.
On
Tuesday
morning
I
was
in
Oberlin
to
visit
Decatur
Health
Systems
(DHS).
DHS
is
a
24-bed
Critical
Access
Hospital
(CAH)
with
a
rural
health
clinic
and
37-bed
extended
care
unit.
The
hospital
provides
a
wide-range
of
services
to
residents
of
Decatur
County
and
the
surrounding
area.
During
my
time
representing
Kansans
in
Washington,
D.C.,
I
have
had
the
pleasure
of
visiting
each
of
the
128
community
hospitals
in
Kansas.
Meeting
with
Kansas
hospital
administrators,
physicians,
nurses,
and
other
providers
gives
me
insight
on
the
unique
challenges
they
face
caring
for
patients
in
rural
settings
across
our
state.
My
discussion
with
DHS
administrators
and
staff
spanned
various
topics
including
concerns
with
the
increasing
federal
regulatory
burden
on
providers,
proposed
changes
in
Medicare
reimbursements
and
the
consequences
to
CAHs.
Any
policies
that
threaten
the
survival
of
these
hospitals
endanger
Kansans'
access
to
health
care
in
their
own
communities
and
could
severely
ration
care
in
rural
America.
I
continue
to
oppose
these
and
other
policy
proposals
that
would
disproportionately
affect
health
care
access
in
Kansas
and
other
rural
states.
Thanks
to
DHS
CEO
Johnathan
Owens
for
hosting
my
visit.
Questioning
the
Department
Of
Justice's
Operation
Choke
Point
This
week,
I,
along
with
several
of
my
colleagues
on
the
Senate
Banking
Committee,
called
on
the
Department
of
Justice
(DoJ)
to
demand
answers
regarding
a
DoJ-led
effort
that
is
negatively
impacting
law-abiding
and
legitimate
businesses
by
choking
them
off
from
the
banking
sector,
known
as
"Operation
Choke
Point."
Late
last
summer,
I
was
made
aware
of
reports
regarding
Operation
Choke
Point
and
how
it
has
been
targeting
certain
industries'
ability
to
access
banking
services
and
the
payments
system
without
first
demonstrating
that
a
company
is
breaking
the
law.
The
effort
is
causing
banks
to
deny
or
terminate
credit
lines,
close
bank
accounts,
and
prevent
payment
processing
due
to
fear
of
DoJ
subpoenas
or
unjustified
regulatory
action
by
federal
banking
regulators.
We
raised
continuing
concerns
that
the
DoJ
operation
is
inappropriately
targeting
certain
business
models
and
is
politicizing
the
payment
system
and
access
to
credit
markets.
The
Obama
Administration's
use
of
financial
regulators
to
harass
industries
it
dislikes
sets
a
troubling
precedent.
Rather
than
discussing
the
underlying
concerns
that
led
the
DoJ
to
launch
Operation
Choke
Point,
this
Administration
has
chosen
to
circumvent
the
process,
using
its
tremendous
power
to
pursue
what
looks
to
be
a
political
agenda.
It
is
time
for
our
questions
to
be
answered
so
that
lawful
American
businesses
can
get
back
to
working
without
fear
of
an
unaccountable
federal
bureaucrat.
Big
Red
One
Deployment
to
Iraq
On
Tuesday,
I
called
on
Department
of
Defense
(DoD)
Secretary
Chuck
Hagel
to
explain
operations
and
the
authorization
of
military
force
in
the
fight
against
the
Islamic
State
of
Iraq
and
Greater
Syria
(ISIS)
in
Iraq.
With
the
deployment
of
500
soldiers
from
the
1st
Infantry
Division
headquarters
&ndash;
The
Big
Red
One
&ndash;
of
Fort
Riley,
Kan.,
I
expressed
my
concern
about
their
safety
and
security
in
an
undefined
campaign
that
does
not
appropriately
recognize
their
participation
and
service
in
these
operations.
I
requested
that
the
Secretary
provide
concrete
answers
by
October
21,
2014,
pertaining
to
the
roles
and
missions
for
Big
Red
One
soldiers
and
other
U.S.
military
forces
serving
in
the
fight
against
ISIS
in
Iraq
and
Syria.
In
addition,
the
DoD
has
made
conflicting
statements
about
this
untitled
campaign
against
ISIS.
The
back-and-forth
messaging
clearly
draws
attention
to
the
Administration's
haphazard
planning,
which
wrongs
our
U.S.
forces
who
deserve
proper
credit
and
recognition
when
they
readily
serve
our
country.
When
sending
soldiers
into
harm's
way,
a
clear
path
and
plan
should
be
defined
for
their
service.
Their
desire
to
serve
should
be
matched
by
the
Administration's
desire
to
define
their
roles
and
missions
against
a
legal
framework
that
authorizes
their
service
in
defense
of
our
country.
I
will
continue
to
press
DoD
and
the
Administration
for
an
explanation
on
the
use
of
military
force
in
Iraq
and
Syria
because
our
nation's
bravest
and
their
families
deserve
an
honest
understanding
of
what
their
loved
ones
must
face
on
behalf
of
our
nation.
Montgomery
County
Meeting
to
Discuss
Closing
Amazon
Operation
Thursday
afternoon,
I
joined
Governor
Brownback
and
members
of
his
cabinet,
State
Senator
Jeff
King,
Rep.
Rich
Proehl,
Rep.
Jim
Kelly,
Rep.
Virgil
Peck,
Montgomery
County
Action
Council
Director
Aaron
Heckman,
and
an
organized
group
of
concerned
civic
and
elected
officials
from
across
Montgomery
County
to
discuss
how
to
handle
last
week's
announcement
that
Amazon
is
moving
their
operation
from
Southeast
Kansas.
It
was
a
standing-room
only
crowd
of
about
150
area
residents.
Governor
Brownback
pledged
his
commitment
to
recovery,
and
members
of
his
cabinet
offered
programs
to
help
with
job
placement
and
training.
I
have
reached
out
to
the
U.S.
Department
of
Labor
and
the
U.S.
Department
of
Commerce,
and
will
continue
to
look
for
ways
to
assist
and
help
this
rural
community
persevere.
Thanks
to
Governor
Brownback
and
State
Senator
Jeff
King
for
inviting
me
to
take
part
in
the
meeting.
Joining
Kansas
City
Entrepreneurs
for
"Rise
of
the
Rest"
Tour
On
Thursday,
I
joined
entrepreneurs
from
the
Kansas
City
area
as
they
hosted
AOL
Founder
Steve
Case
and
the
Rise
of
the
Rest
Tour.
In
an
effort
to
highlight
entrepreneurial
activity
and
encourage
more
collaboration
in
communities
across
the
Midwest,
Steve
Case
embarked
on
a
five-day
tour.
He
visited
Kansas
City
on
Thursday
and
he
opened
the
day's
activities
with
a
round
table
discussion.
My
message
to
the
participants
is
that
we
should
work
to
foster
entrepreneurship
and
innovation
in
Kansas
City.
With
the
power
of
technology
and
a
broadband
connection,
entrepreneurs
can
pursue
their
ideas
anywhere,
not
just
in
places
most
Americans
traditionally
think
of
startups
existing
like
Boston,
Austin,
or
Silicon
Valley.
Following
the
discussion,
the
group
visited
the
Kansas
City
Startup
Village,
the
Sprint
Accelerator,
and
the
Kauffman
Foundation.
The
finale
of
the
day's
activities
culminated
in
a
pitch
competition
where
Kansas
City
startups
presented
their
ideas
for
a
chance
to
win
prizes.
Congrats
to
search-based
startup
Leap.it
for
taking
home
the
grand
prize
and
a
trip
to
SXSW
2015.

support
of
helping
entrepreneurs
achieve
success.

to
members
of
Oberlin
Rotary

at
the
Gateway
Civic
Center
and
thanked
them
for
their

the

Parsons
Noon
Rotary
Club
I
was
in
Southeast
Kansas
on
Thursday
where
I
visited
with
the
Noon
Rotary
Club
in
Parsons.
My
keynote
address
touched
on
the
importance
of
keeping
rural
communities
thriving
and
my
efforts
to
make
certain
veterans
have
access
to
health
care.
Thanks
to
Parsons
Rotary
Club
President
Peter
Cook
for
allowing

Congratulating
Six
New
Eagle
Scouts
More
than
115
million
boys
have
participated
in
Boy
Scouts
over
its
100
year
history,
but
only
about
four
percent
of
them
have
become
Eagle
Scouts.
I
had
the
privilege
of
congratulating
six
of
the
newest
Eagle
Scouts
over
the
weekend
during
an
Eagle
Scout
ceremony
in
Leawood.
To
become
an
Eagle
Scout,
a
scout
must
demonstrate
his
leadership,
service
and
outdoor
skills.
He
must
earn
a
minimum
of
21
merit
badges,
take
on
a
leadership
role
in
his
Boy
Scout
troop
and
develop
and
complete
a
service
project
for
his
local
community.
A
recent
Gallup
survey
of
Eagle
Scouts,
former
Boy
Scouts
and
men
who
never
joined
scouting,
found
that
America's
Eagles
are
far
more
engaged
with
the
world
around
them
in
almost
every
way&mdash;in
community
service,
club
membership,
attending
church,
outdoor
recreation,
and
in
the
fields
of
education
and
health.
That
is
precisely
what
the
Boy
Scouts
of
America
aims
&ndash;
to
develop
responsible
and
engaged
citizens.
Through
the
Boy
Scouts,
young
men
are
being
equipped
with
skills
that
will
help
them
become
successful
in
life.
I
enjoyed
being
a
part
of
this
special
ceremony
and
want
to
congratulate
Isaac,
William,
Andrew,
Calvin,
Jacob
and
Dane
on
a
tremendous
and
impressive
achievement.
