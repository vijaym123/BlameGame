Rubio Introduces Legislation To Curb
Unnecessary Federal Regulations That Hurt
Economic Growth
On Tuesday, Marco introduced
legislation, the
National
Regulatory Budget Act of 2014 , which
establishes a new independent agency that
would be required to assess and report on
the economic costs of existing and new
federal regulations. The legislation also
provides for a regulatory budget process
where Congress would establish caps for
each federal agency and require federal
agencies compliance with the caps.
Antiquated and unnecessary
regulations stand in the way of
innovation, economic growth and
opportunities for people to achieve the
American Dream,
said Rubio . Free enterprise
works when job creators and consumers
have a reasonable regulatory system that
ensures safety and encourages
competition.
The federal government should
be spelling out just how much regulations
cost our economy, and then put itself on
a regulatory diet that brings greater
transparency, accountability and control
to our regulatory code,
added Rubio . The purpose of
regulations should be to protect
consumers and keep people safe, not to
needlessly prevent innovation, economic
growth and new job opportunities from
happening.
On Monday, Marco visited Ubers
Washington, D.C. headquarters for a
discussion on the importance of American
innovation.Following the visit, he
discussed regulatory impediments to
innovation on
CNBCs
Squawk Box.

Rubio Delivers Floor Speech On Crisis
In Venezuela
On Thursday, Marco delivered a Senate
floor speech regarding the ongoing human
rights crisis plaguing Venezuela as a
result of President Nicols
Maduros repressive regime, calling
on Congress to move on
bipartisan
legislation
that would impose targeted
sanctions and provide support to
Venezuelas besieged democratic
movement.
Rubio: I hope we can get
passage of [the legislation]here on
the floor so we can senda clear
signal to the people of Venezuela: The
peopleof the United States of
Americaare on your side, we
supportyour cause, we will not
forgetwhat you are going through,
wewill not abandon
youraspirations.We stand for
the liberty andthe freedom of all
people, includingthose who do not
live here withus.

Rubio, Senate, House Colleagues
Introduce Resolution On Russian Violation
Of Arms Control Agreement
Marco, a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee and Select Committee on
Intelligence,and Senators Kelly
Ayotte (R-NH), David Vitter (R-LA), Jim
Inhofe (R-OK), John Cornyn (R-TX), and
Roger Wicker (R-MS)introduced a
resolution concerning Russias
violation of the 1987 Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty. A companion
resolution is being introduced in the House
by Congressman Mike Rogers (R-AL), Chairman
of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on
Strategic Forces; Congressman Joe Heck
(R-NV), Chairman, House Intelligence
Subcommittee on Technical and Tactical
Intelligence; and Congressman Ted Poe
(R-TX), Chairman, House Foreign Affairs
Subcommittee on Terrorism,
Nonproliferation, and Trade.
In introducing the resolution, Marco and
his House colleagues issued the following
statement:
Fresh off the invasion of
asovereignstate,Russian
cheating cannot beinterpreted in
anything but the most sinister terms.
Cheating is not aseparate issue,
but is rather recognized as an equal part
of President Putins long term plan
for a resurgent Russia.
We have introduced this
resolution because the viability of
future arms control agreements depends on
the reliability of current ones. The INF
treaty is the central arms control accord
of the nuclear era. We must treat it
seriously and pursue violations
relentlessly. There is simply no point in
having treaties unless both sides treat
them with the utmost fidelity, and act in
a manner binding to the
agreement.
Rubio Marks 4
th
Anniversary Of Failed
Obamacare Law
On Sunday, Marco marked the fourth
anniversary of ObamaCares passage in
Congress, noting the failed health care
laws adverse effect on millions of
Americans.
In
a
video message , he highlights
Americans disapproval with
ObamaCare, citing rising health care costs,
dropped coverage, loss of access to current
doctors and the administrations
excessive delays to implement various key
components of the law as proof ObamaCare
should be repealed and replaced.
But what has happened and has changed
about ObamaCare is its no longer
something people are hearing about on the
news, its something that
theyre now feeling in their
lives,
Rubio said . ObamaCare has
gone from being something political, to
something personal.
Personal because now people can
no longer continue to see the doctors
theyve been seeing for a long
time. They can no longer continue to go
to the specialty center that is caring
for them. Theyve lost the health
insurance they were happy with.
Theyre paying higher premiums, or
a much higher deductible. Maybe
its cost them their job, maybe
its cost them hours at work or
maybe theyre suffering from all of
the above,
Rubio added . Thats
why we cannot give up on our efforts, not
just to completely repeal ObamaCare, but
to replace it with real market-based
solutions that allow every single
American to have the ability to buy
affordable health insurance that meets
their needs, and to buy it from any
company in America that will sell it to
them. Were going to have a chance
to achieve that soon. We cannot give
up.
Constituent Casework Corner
June is a 90 year old widow living in an
assisted living facility in South Florida.
Her husband was a veteran so she applied
for widows pension benefits in early
2013. Since her application was still
pending, she contacted Senator
Rubios office for assistance. A
member of the staff contacted the Veterans
Administration (VA) and found out that they
needed a copy of the late veterans
discharge, which the family misplaced.
Senator Rubios staff then contacted
the National Personnel Records Center
(NPRC) to obtain the document. Once
received, it was faxed to the VA and her
application was approved.
