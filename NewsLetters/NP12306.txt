Join me for a Career and Opportunities Fair!
Hi Everyone!
I am hosting a Career and Opportunities Fair
tomorrow to
help connect local residents with jobs and employment opportunities
throughout the Granite State. The event will be held from 10:00 am to
1:00 pm on Thursday, February 20th, at the Holiday Inn at 172 N. Main
St. in Concord. It will feature employers from the manufacturing,
recreation, energy, transportation, and health care industries, among
others.
My top priority in Congress is helping create jobs and opportunity for
New Hampshire's middle class families. That's what this job fair is all
about - connecting local job seekers with a wide variety of New
Hampshire employers who are looking to grow their businesses and hire
new workers. Job seekers wishing to attend the Career and Opportunities
Fair can register here
.
Thanks for everything you do to make New Hampshire such a wonderful
place to live. I hope to see you tomorrow!
