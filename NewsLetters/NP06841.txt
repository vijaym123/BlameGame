Fast and Furious
Update :
We are one step closer to getting the truth about the
botched gun-running operation known as Fast and Furious that resulted
in the death of border agent Brian Terry.
On Wednesday,
a federal judge ordered
the Justice Department to
turn over a list of Fast and Furious documents to Congress. The House
of Representatives is hopeful these documents will help us discover
why the Department of Justice was misleading about their reckless
conduct and will allow us to give the American people the truth they
deserve.
Around the
District :
On Wednesday, members of the Midwest ALS Association came by my
office to discuss ALS Research programs and the importance of raising ALS
awareness in our communities. Thank you to Nancy Lindquist for all your
hard work, and a special thanks to Bob Davis and his wife, Evelyn
Davis for sharing their personal struggles with this disease.
I had a great discussion with folks in Holton on at my Coffee with
Your Congresswoman event. Thanks to everyone who stopped by City Hall to
share their ideas and concerns.
On Wednesday
afternoon, I met with Mayor Tim Lentz at Horton City Hall to hear more about
the Reinventing Horton projects. It is exciting to see a town come
together and organize a great project like Reinvent Horton to improve
their community. I hope other communities in Kansas will follow their
lead and I know I will encourage others to look to Horton as an
example.
It was an honor to speak at the dedication ceremony for a
new sign that will welcome visitors to the city of Horton. The new sign
recognizes the growing economic partnerships between the City of
Horton and the Kickapoo Nation.
It was also a privilege to attend the
Childrens Mercy Hospitals Discover Childrens Mercy event in
Kansas City this week. Childrens Mercy is one of highest ranked childrens
hospitals in the nation and are the only facility within a 250-mile
radius to have neonatal intensive care with a level 4 facility. They
are doing extraordinary work for the Kansas City area and I want to
especially thank Dr. Thomas Tryon and their staff for taking me around
today.
This week I also had the opportunity to meet with
folks in Southeast Kansas and tour a number of businesses including Post
Rock Energy in Chanute, SEKTAM, Inc. in Coffeyville and TranSystems in
Independence.
