Hi David,
Out on the campaign trail, I get this one a lot: &ldquo;Brad, why are you doing this?"
I share with them a simple, yet, powerful idea: The future can be better than the present; and that all of us have an individual responsibility to make it so.
David, it&rsquo;s a privilege working with you in common cause to fight for people here in Illinois and around the country.
And with your help, I&rsquo;d like to keep fighting. It&rsquo;ll take a big effort. In fact, we&rsquo;ve set a $250,000 online goal for October. So I&rsquo;m asking you to dig deep. Will you pitch in $5 or more to help me keep fighting for Illinois?
$5
$35
$50
$100
$250

My sincerest thanks,
Brad
