Friend,
Today, is the 70 th
anniversary of the Servicemans Readjustment Act of 1944, better known as the GI Bill.
Toward the end of WWII, the GI Bill was signed in order to provide returning veterans with a wide range of benefits, including tuition and living expenses to attend college, low-interest loans and mortgages, and other veteran assistance programs designed to assist veterans of subsequent wars as well as peacetime service.
Since taking office I have worked hard to introduce legislation that benefits our nation's veterans and service members.
This congress, I introduced the Veterans Mental Health Accessibility Act which would make any veteran, regardless of the dates of service, eligible for mental healthcare through the VA so long as the issue is service connected.
I also introduced the Military Family Leave Act, to allow those whose family members have received notification of impending active military duty to spend time with and support their family members by giving two weeks un-paid leave in the event of a deployment.
This legislation would create two work weeks of unpaid military family leave for employees of all stripes.
I remain committed to making our nation's veterans and service members a top priority and ensuring that they and their families receive the benefits and recognition they've earned and deserve.
