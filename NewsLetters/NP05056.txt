David -- Everyone who thinks Democrats CANNOT win this election needs to take 60 seconds to read this:
It&rsquo;s true. Republicans will outspend us in this election. The right-wing puppet masters -- the Koch Brothers and Karl Rove -- are doing everything in their power to buy this election with corporate cash. Check out this scary chart:

So how do we compete with that?
We&rsquo;ve invested early
in key battleground districts.
We&rsquo;ve invested heavily
in our communities with an unprecedented get-out-the-vote operation.
We&rsquo;ve invested smartly
with micro-targeting technology to reach the right voters with the right message.
In short, we&rsquo;re taking the lessons we learned from both of Barack Obama&rsquo;s presidential campaigns. We run smarter, more focused, and downright better campaigns than Boehner&rsquo;s Republicans ever could. And where has that gotten us?

But here&rsquo;s the bad news -- we don&rsquo;t have the funds we need to get us through Election Day:
Our smart, focused campaign is running on all cylinders. But since we invested early, we knew we&rsquo;d be relying on a late surge of grassroots support to fund these final days.
In other words, we&rsquo;re putting this campaign on your shoulders, David. Here&rsquo;s what we need to do now:
We need to pull together another $171,000 today, or we&rsquo;ll have to make tough decisions about which programs we have to slash. We&rsquo;ve come too far to slow down now.
So when we say we&rsquo;re pleading for you to make a donation, we&rsquo;re not kidding. We really need your help.
