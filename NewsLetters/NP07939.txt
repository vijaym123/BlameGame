Dear friends,
This
week, I introduced a new, common-sense bill to empower the people of
Idaho: the
Idaho County Shooting Range Land
Conveyance Act .
This bill would convey approximately
31 acres of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land to Idaho County for
use as a gun range.
The gun range would provide accessible
firearms training for Idaho County residents, recreational opportunities for
families and a convenient training facility for the Idaho County
Sheriffs Department.
For years, the Idaho County Commission has
been ready to install a gun range in the Riggins Area, but theyve been
prevented from building it because of cumbersome BLM
regulations.
Therefore, a legislative solution is necessary.
What my bill
does is transfer the appropriate BLM land to Idaho County where it
will benefit Idahoans, both economically and
recreationally.
Ive been working on this issue with BLM and the country since
2011.
The bill I introduced is a product of several years of
communication and teamwork between my office and the most relevant
stakeholders. Idaho County Sheriff Doug Giddings said my bill would have a
direct and positive impact on the people of our county.
Suzanne
Endsley, public affairs officer for the BLMs Coeur dAlene and Spokane
districts, said were supportive of the effort.
The Idaho
County Commission is ready to manage the parcel of BLM land.
In a
letter sent to the Idaho delegation on March 25, the County
Commissioners noted, In addressing environmental concerns, thousands of dollars
have been spent by the BLM and the location has been found suitable
for the described use as a gun range.
In addition, the
Commissioners have agreed to hold responsibility for all necessary maintenance
and operation of the land.
To learn more about my bill,
please read these articles about
it:

This bill is a high priority for
me, and I am always on the lookout for new legislation that empowers
the people of Idaho.
If you have any ideas for future bills,
please
send them my way .
