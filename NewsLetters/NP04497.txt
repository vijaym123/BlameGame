Support Keystone
On Friday,
the House of Representatives voted once again to authorize the
construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. It is hard to find an idea these
days that garners as much broad, bipartisan support as Keystone. A
strong majority of the American people are in favor of moving forward on
this project because they know it will
create more
jobs
and economic opportunity. That is why the House of
Representatives has voted on multiple occasions to approve its construction, and
its why President Obamas stubborn refusal to act really defies common
sense.
The Keystone XL
pipeline has survived years of bureaucratic scrutiny and politically driven
delays by the Obama Administration. Its approval and construction are
long overdue. The House has done its part once again. The Senate
ought to do the same, and President Obama ought to finally put politics
aside and do whats right on behalf of the American
people.
Johns
Creek Veterans Memorial Walk
On the Friday before Veterans Day, I joined Johns Creek Mayor Bodker,
Consul General of the Republic of Korea, Seong-jin Kim and a number of
our communitys veterans at the dedication of the Johns Creek Veterans
Memorial Walk. It was an honor to take part in this ceremony. If you
have the opportunity, I encourage you to stop by and enjoy the
memorial as it honors the selfless and courageous veterans who keep our
country safe and free.
