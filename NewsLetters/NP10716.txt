Friend,
Today, as we mark Equal Pay Day, more needs to be done to close the wage gap that still exists between women and men
including passage of the critical Paycheck Fairness Act.
Equal Pay Day symbolizes when, more than three months into the year, womens wages finally catch up to what men were paid in the previous year.
According to a report from the American Association of University Women, the women in Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District make 76 cents for every dollar earned by men.
Nationwide women earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men, despite the fact that the Equal Pay Act will mark its 51st anniversary in June.
The Paycheck Fairness Act is a central pillar of the House Democrats
When Women Succeed, America Succeeds:
An Economic Agenda for Women and Families.
The bill strengthens and closes loopholes in the 1963 Equal Pay Act.
It provides effective remedies to women who are not being paid equal pay for equal work.
Equal pay is not simply a womans issue
its a family issue.
Families increasingly rely on womens wages to make ends meet.
When women bring home less money each day, it means they have less for the everyday needs of their families
groceries, rent, child care, doctors visits.
In this 21 st
century, in order to strengthen the American family and ensure fairness in the workplace, we should all be working together until we have achieved an America where women are truly paid equal pay for equal work.
