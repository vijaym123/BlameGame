Happy Pioneer Day!
As Utahns gather today for celebration and
fun, let us never forget the wonderful men and
women who sacrificed greatly to pave the way for
us to live in the most beautiful and truly
remarkable place in the country.
I am proud of my pioneer heritage and the
legacy of faith and fortitude my ancestors
demonstrated. It has had a tremendous
impact on my life and the lives of my family, and
I know many in Utah feel the same about their
familys history.
My great-grandfather Jeremiah Hatch was one of
the first white settlers to arrive in the Ashley
Valley, which we now know as Vernal, Utah.
Jeremiah quickly became friends with the Native
Americans living there and became known as
Uncle Jerry to many for the hand of
friendship and warmth he extended. He
worked hard to cultivate the land and establish
the wonderful valley that exists today.
Utahs history is replete with examples
of thousands of men, women and children who
walked a challenging path, often burying loved
ones along the way, to come to the valley of
promise.
The story of the Mormon pioneers is very much
an American story. It is the story of a
quest for freedom and liberty. It is the
story of those who made the most of the
opportunities around them
those who
built, and those who planted. It is the
story of those who saw and cultivated the
potential of this state.
The Utah pioneers were ordinary people who
were called upon to meet extraordinary
challenges. Let us always remember and
honor their quiet courage, unshakable devotion,
and their lives of humility and
devotion.
Although the original path has now been paved
by many generations of Utahns, we are still on a
trek to find a better future for our families,
communities, state and nation. I not only
honor and sincerely appreciate my forefathers who
sacrificed so much for a place to call their own;
I want to pay tribute to the many men and women
across our state who still strive each day to
make our state and nation a better place for
all.
Thank you for your devotion to the ideals that
have defined Utah for almost 170 years. May
God continue to bless our wonderful state and its
citizens.
Sincerely,
Orrin Hatch
