Our
Veterans Deserve Better From The
VA
Dear Friend,
Last month marked one year since we
learned of the gross mismanagement at the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that
resulted in tragic outcomes for those who
have made countless sacrifices to protect
our nations freedoms. The problems
within the VA are the result of a broken
system, and though our work is far from
over, the House has worked to implement
meaningful, structural reforms to ensure
our veterans have the care they
deserve.
Last year, the Veterans Access, Choice,
and Accountability Act created the Veterans
Choice Program to allow veterans unable to
obtain appointments at VA medical
facilities within 30 days, or residing over
40 miles from the nearest VA medical
facility, to receive care outside the VA
system. While this program did help many
veterans, it calculated the 40 mile
distance using as the crow
flies parameters, excluding many
veterans who live far more than 40 driving
miles from a VA care center. After pressure
from Congress, the VA appropriately revised
the rule to designate driving distance as
the form of measurement, allowing more
veterans to be included in this
boundary.
While this is a step in the right
direction, Fifth District veterans who live
more than 40 miles from a VA hospital are
still being forced to drive excessive
distances to receive the care they need
because Community Based Outreach Clinics
are included in this criteria even though
they often do not provide the type of care
a veteran may need. My constituents have
also expressed frustration about the
outrageous amount of time they must spend
on hold to talk with someone at the VA, and
in some cases, they are unable to speak
with anyone. And to make matters even
worse, it typically takes several months to
process their reimbursement for travel
costs.
In the 114th Congress we have passed
several pieces of legislation to further
improve the treatment our veterans receive.
The Clay Hunt SAV Act, which the President
has signed into law, improves
veterans access to mental health
care resources. Another bill passed by the
House allows the Secretary of Veterans
Affairs authority to rescind all or part of
the amount of any award or bonus paid to an
employee of the VA. The Long-Term Care
Veterans Choice Act authorizes the VA to
enter into contracts with certified medical
foster homes to expand the options
available for the long-term care needs of
our veterans.
While these bills are vital steps to
meaningfully and structurally reform the
delivery of care to our veterans, they are
not enough. Congressional oversight is
essential to effectively implement these
necessary reforms. Next week, the House
Veterans Affairs Committee is scheduled to
hold a hearing to evaluate the progress of
the Veterans Access, Choice, and
Accountability Act.
We will not be successful in this
mission unless we also continue to demand
accountability and change from the VA so it
returns to a culture of duty and service
rather than one of bureaucracy and
paper-pushing. If we remain dedicated to
the solemn obligations we owe to the men
and women that have given life and limb for
our nation, we can provide a level of care
and service worthy of the tremendous
sacrifice our veterans made for the cause
of freedom.
We take our responsibility to serve all
Fifth District Virginians very seriously,
and we encourage all veterans having issues
with the VA to contact our office if we may
be of help in any way. I am humbled by the
opportunity to serve Virginias Fifth
District veterans, I remain fully committed
to ensuring that our citizens who have
given the most receive the benefits they
have earned and deserve.
