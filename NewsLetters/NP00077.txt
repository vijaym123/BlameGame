Forbes Announces New Congressional Prayer Caucus
Initiative, #FaithitForward
Washington, D.C.
Congressman Randy Forbes, Founder and Co-Chairman of the Congressional Prayer Caucus, announced a new initiative today, Tuesday, June 23rd.
The purpose of the initiative, called #FaithitForward, is to unite the country around celebrating the positive impact of faith in local communities. Members of Congress across the nation are participating by highlighting inspiring stores of how people of faith in their districts are a force for good in their communities.
Policies are often generated because of real life stories of how those policies impact the lives and direction of a nation, said Congressman Forbes. Perhaps no group of stories have had a greater impact on our country than stories of faith. Unfortunately, amidst policy debates, we sometimes lose sight of those stories. The goal of #FaithitForward is to tell these stories in a central place for policymakers and the world to see.
