Exposing Middle School Students to Career Exploration
Dear Friend,
Today, I introduced the Middle School Technical Education Program (Middle STEP) Act that would expose middle school students to Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs focused on career exploration. The Middle STEP Act would establish a pilot program for middle schools to partner with postsecondary institutions and local businesses to develop and implement CTE programs that give students access to apprenticeships or project-based learning opportunities traditionally not available to students until high school or postsecondary programs.
Middle school is an important time for students to explore their own strengths, likes, and dislikes, and CTE exploration programs are great tools to educate them about the type of coursework or training that goes into a career field that matches their interests.
You can learn more about the Middle STEP Act

Sincerely,
Senator Tim Kaine
