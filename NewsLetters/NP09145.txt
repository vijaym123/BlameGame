Dear Friend,
This week, the House passed my amendment to provide an extra $5 million
to help eliminate the backlog of untested rape kits in America, on the
House Floor I highlighted the importance of making sure our veterans
receive the care they deserve, and an impressive Memphian was
interviewed by Katie Couric for her work to help foster youth. Keep

Helping Eliminate the Memphis Rape Kit Backlog
This week, the United States House of Representatives debated the
Fiscal Year 2015 Commerce, Justice and Science (CJS) Appropriations
bill, which determines funding levels for a large number of federal
programs and agencies. I am pleased that yesterday, my colleagues voted
to pass an amendment that I introduced
to provide more federal resources to
local law enforcement agencies working to reduce their backlogs of
untested rape kits. Of roughly 400,000 untested rape kits sitting in
evidence rooms nationwide, an estimated 12,000 remain untested in
Memphis-more than anywhere else in the country. Untested rape kits
prevent law enforcement from apprehending violent criminals, increase
the risk of additional crimes, and rob victims of the justice they
deserve.
Absolutely no one should be a victim of sexual assault, but it is a
travesty when communities are terrorized and innocent people are
victimized simply because evidence that could be used to prevent these
crimes sits untested on a shelf somewhere. We know that these untested
rape kits, if they had been properly processed, could have led to the
capture of perpetrators and prevented additional attacks and more
victims, and we must do everything in our power to eliminate a rape kit
backlog that is worse in Memphis than anywhere else in the country.
Adding federal funding to help cut down the nation's backlog improves
the chances that Memphis will receive the resources it needs to do the
same. It's the least we can do to give victims the justice they deserve
and it is an imperative if we want to keep our communities safe from
predators. You can watch my interview with News Channel 3 about my
amendment here
.
Working to Ensure that our Veterans Receive High-Quality Care
Over Memorial Day weekend, I participated in three different events
around Memphis. I also spoke about the importance of keeping our
promises to those who bravely served our country by ensuring they
receive the care they deserve-something both President Obama and I are
committed to doing. With more and more of our nation's veterans
returning from combat suffering from PTSD and other serious conditions,
I will continue working with President Obama to make sure they are
treated with the utmost respect and receive timely, high-quality care
at the Memphis VAMC or any other VAMC.
Unfortunately, we know for many veterans, our commitment to them has
not been fulfilled. Veterans and their families have suffered. Earlier
today, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki, chose to resign.
While I join with President Obama in applauding Secretary Shinseki for
his service, I also commend him on stepping down, knowing that the
Department of Veterans Affairs needs a new beginning with the focus
firmly placed on our veterans. While his resignation will not solve the
systemic and severe problems at the VA that have called into question
the care provided to our nation's heroes, I hope that it will convince
some in Congress that not every solution begins with spending cuts.
Before Secretary Shinseki resigned, I spoke about my efforts to support
Memphis veterans on the US House Floor. You can watch my remarks here
. Whether fighting to ensure the VA has
the resources necessary to reduce its backlog or working to bring
senior Administration officials to Memphis to assess the best way to
improve care, I will do everything I can-as I always have-to support
the dedicated Memphians who put their lives on the line and to see that
they are treated with dignity and respect and that they receive the
finest medical care possible.
Finding Justice for the Unfairly Incarcerated
>From my first day in Congress, advocating for fairer sentencing laws
and realistically examining sentencing disparities has been a
centerpiece of my legislative agenda. That's why I offered another
amendment to the CJS Appropriations bill that would provide additional
resources to the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Office of the Pardon
Attorney to help President Obama's Administration more fully realize
the goals of its newly-expanded criteria for executive clemency
. My amendment, had it passed, would have provided an additional
$2 million in funding to help ensure that the Office of the Pardon
Attorney has a sufficient number of attorneys to adequately review the
expected influx of clemency applications soon-to-be-submitted by
non-violent offenders as a result of the new criteria.
In 2010, the President signed the Fair Sentencing Act into law, which
dramatically reduced the mandatory minimum sentencing disparity between
crack and cocaine. That was a major achievement but, because it wasn't
made retroactive, the people who were sentenced prior to that law are
now sitting in prison serving sentences that Congress has found void
against public policy. For these men and women, every day that they
continue to sit in prison, separated from their families and their
communities, is an injustice-and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s "fierce
urgency of now" demands that we help them immediately. I also spoke
about the unfairness of mandatory minimum sentences that keep these
people in prison at an Over-Criminalization Task Force hearing this
morning.
While the President expanding the criteria for clemency applications is
encouraging, the good it will do is limited by the number of attorneys
available to process those applications. Congress must act to ensure
that we give deserving non-violent drug offenders a true second chance
at freedom, improve our justice system, and save taxpayers money.
An Inspiring Memphians Making A Difference for Foster Children
Every year, around 26,000 young people age out of the foster care
system in our country without ever being reunited with their families
or finding permanency through adoption. They are more likely to become
homeless and very unlikely to attend college. Some of our nation's
foster youth, including Memphian Darrah Hall, are trying to do
something to change that. I met Darrah last month when she visited my
Capitol Hill office during a visit to Washington representing Youth
Villages at a White House event with the First Lady. Youth Villages is
a non-profit organization that has partnered with the Tennessee
Department of Children's Services to offer comprehensive services to
every foster youth who ages out of state custody. I'm proud that our
state is becoming a national model for how to best help these
vulnerable young people.
Youth Villages' transitional living program began in 1999 through the
generosity of the late Clarence Day, a Memphis philanthropist, and has
since expanded to help more than 6,000 young adults. Darrah is a very
impressive young woman, and I am pleased that Katie Couric recognized
her accomplishments in an interview on her show this week. I hope you'll
take a few minutes to watch the interview here
.
Promoting Sanity in our Criminal Drug Sentencing Laws
Late Wednesday night, I participated in an all-too-rare genuine debate
on the Floor of the United States House of Representatives on the
merits of our nation's failed War on Drugs and our continued federal
prohibition on marijuana. The entire floor debate is available to watch
here
, and I recommend that you take a few
minutes to do so. At one point, a Republican Congressman tried to argue
that marijuana isn't culturally acceptable while at the same time
defending bourbon being legal because alcohol is occasionally used in
religious ceremonies.
I also joined Representatives Dana Rohrabacher, Sam Farr and others in
offering a bipartisan amendment to respect the states that have enacted
medical marijuana laws. Our amendment, which passed by a strong
bipartisan vote, prohibits the Justice Department from interfering with
state medical marijuana laws, including Tennessee's new law allowing
research on cannabis oil. After fighting for many years to protect
patients with multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, glaucoma and other diseases
who rely on medical marijuana to ease their suffering, I was pleased
that our amendment was successful.
Helping Ensure Everyone Has a Fair Shot in our Justice System
I also offered an amendment to the CJS Appropriations bill this week
that would reverse devastating cuts to the Legal Services Corporation
(LSC), which helps those who cannot afford high-priced attorneys
navigate the justice system. Whether helping victims of domestic
violence who need protective orders from abusive partners, homeowners
facing foreclosure, or helping seniors who've been victimized by
fraudulent lenders, the LSC is vital to ensuring that everyone gets a
fair shot.
That's why I've been such a big champion for the Legal Services
Corporation, which helps fund legal aid programs throughout the
country. If it had passed, my amendment would have restored $15 million
that was cut from its budget by Republicans this year-and even that
would be more than $200 million less than what its budget would be if
it had just kept pace with inflation over the last 2 decades.
In our city, Memphis Area Legal Services lost 5% of its funding due to
sequestration. When you add in state and local funds lost over recent
years because of budget cuts, its funding was reduced by more than
$300,000 and its staff was reduced from 50 to 38. The attorneys there
do heroic work, but to further reduce its funding will have serious
consequences for their ability to serve those in need.
The rights we're guaranteed under the law mean little if we don't have
the expertise needed to protect them. And with no money to hire a
lawyer and no ability to navigate the court system on their own, too
many people are effectively left without access to justice. Unless we
ensure legal assistance, we effectively shut the courthouse doors to
Americans who rely on attorneys to protect their rights.
Make Sure to Claim Unclaimed Property
The State of Tennessee maintains a searchable database of unclaimed
property, which can include bank accounts, stocks and dividends, wages,
refunds, insurance payments, gift certificates, credit balances and
overpayments, and a number of other things. There is no cost for
accessing the database, and you may find that you are owed money or
property. If you have not searched the database yet or if you haven't
searched in a while, you can visit https://www.claimittn.gov
and see for yourself whether the state is holding
any property or assets for you. And you may pass this information along
to your friends and family as well!
As always, I remain.
Most sincerely,

the

House
of

debated
the
Fiscal
Year
2015
Commerce,
Justice
and
Science
(CJS)
Appropriations
bill,
which
determines
funding
levels
for
a
large
number
of
federal
programs
and
agencies.
I
am
pleased
that
yesterday,
my
colleagues
voted
to
pass
an
amendment
that
I
introduced
to
provide
more
federal
resources
to
local
law
enforcement
agencies
working
to
reduce
their
backlogs
of
untested
rape
kits.
Of
roughly
400,000
untested
rape
kits
sitting
in
evidence
rooms
nationwide,
an
estimated
12,000
remain
untested
in
Memphis&#8212;more
than
anywhere
else
in
the
country.
Untested
rape
kits
prevent
law
enforcement
from
apprehending
violent
criminals,
increase
the
risk
of
additional
crimes,
and
rob
victims
of
the
justice
they
deserve.
Absolutely
no
one
should
be
a
victim
of
sexual
assault,
but
it
is
a
travesty
when
communities
are
terrorized
and
innocent
people
are
victimized
simply
because
evidence
that
could
be
used
to
prevent
these
crimes
sits
untested
on
a
shelf
somewhere.
We
know
that
these
untested
rape
kits,
if
they
had
been
properly
processed,
could
have
led
to
the
capture
of
perpetrators
and
prevented
additional
attacks
and
more

and
we
must
do
everything
in
our
power
to
eliminate
a
rape

backlog
that
is
worse
in
Memphis
than
anywhere
else
in
the
country.
Adding
federal
funding
to
help
cut
down
the
nation&#8217;s
backlog
improves
the
chances
that
Memphis
will
receive
the
resources
it
needs
to
do
the
same.
It&#8217;s
the
least
we
can
do
to
give
victims
the
justice
they
deserve
and
it
is
an
imperative
if
we
want
to
keep
our
communities
safe
from
predators.

Working
to
Ensure
that
our
Veterans
Receive
High-Quality
Care
Over
Memorial
Day
weekend,
I
participated
in
three
different
events
around
Memphis.
I
also
spoke
about
the
importance
of
keeping
our
promises
to
those
who
bravely
served
our
country
by
ensuring
they
receive
the
care
they
deserve&#8212;something
both
President
Obama
and
I
are
committed
to
doing.
With
more
and
more
of
our
nation&#8217;s
veterans
returning
from
combat
suffering
from
PTSD
and
other
serious
conditions,
I
will
continue
working
with
President
Obama
to
make
sure
they
are
treated
with
the
utmost
respect
and
receive
timely,
high-quality
care
at
the
Memphis
VAMC
or
any
other
VAMC.
Unfortunately,
we
know
for
many
veterans,
our
commitment
to
them
has
not
been
fulfilled.
Veterans
and
their
families
have
suffered.
Earlier
today,
Secretary
of
Veterans
Affairs
Eric
Shinseki,
chose
to
resign.
While
I
join
with
President
Obama
in
applauding
Secretary
Shinseki
for
his
service,
I
also
commend
him
on
stepping
down,
knowing
that
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
needs
a
new
beginning
with
the
focus
firmly
placed
on
our
veterans.
While
his
resignation
will
not
solve
the
systemic
and
severe
problems
at
the
VA
that
have
called
into
question
the
care
provided
to
our
nation&#8217;s
heroes,
I
hope
that
it
will
convince
some
in
Congress
that
not
every
solution
begins
with
spending
cuts.
Before
Secretary
Shinseki
resigned,
I
spoke
about
my
efforts
to
support
Memphis
veterans
on
the
US
House
Floor.
You
can
watch
my
remarks
here .
Whether
fighting
to
ensure
the
VA
has
the
resources
necessary
to
reduce
its
backlog
or
working
to
bring
senior
Administration
officials
to
Memphis
to
assess
the
best
way
to
improve
care,
I
will
do
everything
I
can&#8212;as
I
always
have&#8212;to
support
the
dedicated
Memphians
who
put
their
lives
on
the
line
and
to
see
that
they
are
treated
with
dignity
and
respect
and
that
they
receive
the
finest
medical
care
possible.
Finding
Justice
for
the
Unfairly
Incarcerated
From
my
first
day
in
Congress,
advocating
for
fairer
sentencing
laws
and
realistically
examining
sentencing
disparities
has
been
a
centerpiece
of
my
legislative
agenda.
That&#8217;s
why
I
offered
another
amendment
to
the
CJS
Appropriations
bill
that
would
provide
additional
resources
to
the
Department
of
Justice&#8217;s
(DOJ)
Office
of
the
Pardon
Attorney
to
help
President
Obama&#8217;s
Administration
more
fully
realize
the
goals
of
its
newly-expanded
criteria
for
executive
clemency .
My
amendment,
had
it
passed,
would
have
provided
an
additional
$2
million
in
funding
to
help
ensure
that
the
Office
of
the
Pardon
Attorney
has
a
sufficient
number
of
attorneys
to
adequately
review
the
expected
influx
of
clemency
applications
soon-to-be-submitted
by
non-violent
offenders
as
a
result
of
the
new
criteria.
In
2010,
the
President
signed
the
Fair
Sentencing
Act
into
law,
which
dramatically
reduced
the
mandatory
minimum
sentencing
disparity
between
crack
and
cocaine.
That
was
a
major
achievement
but,
because
it
wasn&#8217;t
made
retroactive,
the
people
who
were
sentenced
prior
to
that
law
are
now
sitting
in
prison
serving
sentences
that
Congress
has
found
void
against
public
policy.
For
these
men
and
women,
every
day
that
they
continue
to
sit
in
prison,
separated
from
their
families
and
their
communities,
is
an
injustice&#8212;and
Dr.
Martin
Luther
King,
Jr.&#8217;s
&#8220;fierce
urgency
of
now&#8221;
demands
that
we
help
them
immediately.
I
also
spoke
about
the
unfairness
of
mandatory
minimum
sentences
that
keep
these
people
in
prison
at
an
Over-Criminalization
Task
Force
hearing
this
morning.
While
the
President
expanding
the
criteria
for
clemency
applications
is
encouraging,
the
good
it
will
do
is
limited
by
the
number
of
attorneys
available
to
process
those
applications.
Congress
must
act
to
ensure
that
we
give
deserving
non-violent
drug
offenders
a
true
second
chance
at
freedom,
improve
our
justice
system,
and
save
taxpayers
money.
An
Inspiring
Memphians
Making
A
Difference
for
Foster
Children
Every
year,
around
26,000
young
people
age
out
of
the
foster
care
system
in
our
country
without
ever
being
reunited
with
their
families
or
finding
permanency
through
adoption.
They
are
more
likely
to
become
homeless
and
very
unlikely
to
attend
college.
Some
of
our
nation&#8217;s
foster
youth,
including
Memphian
Darrah
Hall,
are
trying
to
do
something
to
change
that.
I
met
Darrah
last
month
when
she
visited
my
Capitol
Hill
office
during
a
visit
to
Washington
representing
Youth
Villages
at
a
White
House
event
with
the
First
Lady.
Youth
Villages
is
a
non-profit
organization
that
has
partnered
with
the
Tennessee
Department
of
Children's
Services
to
offer
comprehensive
services
to
every
foster
youth
who
ages
out
of
state
custody.
I'm
proud
that
our
state
is
becoming
a
national
model
for
how
to
best
help
these
vulnerable
young
people.
Youth
Villages'
transitional
living
program
began
in
1999
through
the
generosity
of
the
late
Clarence
Day,
a
Memphis
philanthropist,
and
has
since
expanded
to
help
more
than
6,000
young
adults.
Darrah
is
a
very
impressive
young
woman,
and
I
am
pleased
that
Katie
Couric
recognized
her
accomplishments
in
an
interview
on
her
show
this
week.
I
hope
you&#8217;ll
take
a
few
minutes
to
watch
the
interview
here .
Promoting
Sanity
in
our
Criminal
Drug
Sentencing
Laws
Late
Wednesday
night,
I
participated
in
an
all-too-rare
genuine
debate
on
the
Floor
of
the
United
States
House
of
Representatives
on
the
merits
of
our
nation&#8217;s
failed
War
on
Drugs
and
our
continued
federal
prohibition
on
marijuana.
The
entire
floor
debate
is
available
to
watch
here ,
and
I
recommend
that
you
take
a
few
minutes
to
do
so.
At
one
point,
a
Republican
Congressman
tried
to
argue
that
marijuana
isn&#8217;t
culturally
acceptable
while
at
the
same
time
defending
bourbon
being
legal
because
alcohol
is
occasionally
used
in
religious
ceremonies.
I
also
joined
Representatives
Dana
Rohrabacher,
Sam
Farr
and
others
in
offering
a
bipartisan
amendment
to
respect
the
states
that
have
enacted
medical
marijuana
laws.
Our
amendment,
which
passed
by
a
strong
bipartisan
vote,
prohibits
the
Justice
Department
from
interfering
with
state
medical
marijuana
laws,
including
Tennessee&#8217;s
new
law
allowing
research
on
cannabis
oil.
After
fighting
for
many
years
to
protect
patients
with
multiple
sclerosis,
epilepsy,
glaucoma
and
other
diseases
who
rely
on
medical
marijuana
to
ease
their
suffering,
I
was
pleased
that
our
amendment
was
successful.
Helping
Ensure
Everyone
Has
a
Fair
Shot
in
our
Justice
System
I
also
offered
an
amendment
to
the
CJS
Appropriations
bill
this
week
that
would
reverse
devastating
cuts
to
the
Legal
Services
Corporation
(LSC),
which
helps
those
who
cannot
afford
high-priced
attorneys
navigate
the
justice
system.
Whether
helping
victims
of
domestic
violence
who
need
protective
orders
from
abusive
partners,
homeowners
facing
foreclosure,
or
helping
seniors
who&#8217;ve
been
victimized
by
fraudulent
lenders,
the
LSC
is
vital
to
ensuring
that
everyone
gets
a
fair
shot.
That&#8217;s
why
I&#8217;ve
been
such
a
big
champion
for
the
Legal
Services
Corporation,
which
helps
fund
legal
aid
programs
throughout
the
country.
If
it
had
passed,
my
amendment
would
have
restored
$15
million
that
was
cut
from
its
budget
by
Republicans
this
year&#8212;and
even
that
would
be
more
than
$200
million
less
than
what
its
budget
would
be
if
it
had
just
kept
pace
with
inflation
over
the
last
2
decades.
In
our
city,
Memphis
Area
Legal
Services
lost
5%
of
its
funding
due
to
sequestration.
When
you
add
in
state
and
local
funds
lost
over
recent
years
because
of
budget
cuts,
its
funding
was
reduced
by
more
than
$300,000
and
its
staff
was
reduced
from
50
to
38.
The
attorneys
there
do
heroic
work,
but
to
further
reduce
its
funding
will
have
serious
consequences
for
their
ability
to
serve
those
in
need.
The
rights
we&#8217;re
guaranteed
under
the
law
mean
little
if
we
don&#8217;t
have
the
expertise
needed
to
protect
them.
And
with
no
money
to
hire
a
lawyer
and
no
ability
to
navigate
the
court
system
on
their
own,
too
many
people
are
effectively
left
without
access
to
justice.
Unless
we
ensure
legal
assistance,
we
effectively
shut
the
courthouse
doors
to
Americans
who
rely
on
attorneys
to
protect
their
rights.
Make
Sure
to
Claim
Unclaimed
Property
The
State
of
Tennessee
maintains
a
searchable
database
of
unclaimed
property,
which
can
include
bank
accounts,
stocks
and
dividends,
wages,
refunds,
insurance
payments,
gift
certificates,
credit
balances
and
overpayments,
and
a
number
of
other
things.
There
is
no
cost
for
accessing
the
database,
and
you
may
find
that
you
are
owed
money
or
property.
If
you
have
not
searched
the
database
yet
or
if
you
haven&#8217;t
searched
in
a
while,
you
can
visit
https://www.claimittn.gov
and
see
for
yourself
whether
the
state
is
holding
any
property
or
assets
for
you.
And
you
may
pass
this
information
along
to
your
friends
and
family
as
well!
As
always,
I
remain.
Most
sincerely,
