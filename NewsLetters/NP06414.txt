Last year's shutdown affected businesses and families all across our district. At Naval Station Great Lakes alone, more than 2,500 workers were sent home.
Once again, some Tea Partiers in Congress are threatening a new government shutdown. We can&rsquo;t let that happen.
Please sign our petition to say no to another government shutdown:
What a GREAT response!
So far, more than 60,000 people have signed our petition calling on the Republicans to take yet another government shutdown off the table.
Why? Because the last one cost our economy billions and hurt hardworking families. In our district, Naval Station Great Lakes alone had to send more than 2,500 workers home.
David, we can&rsquo;t let that happen again. Help us get 100,000 strong standing with Brad to demand Republicans stop threatening another government shutdown. Click here to automatically sign your name calling on the Republicans to stop threatening another government shutdown &gt;&gt;
Thanks,
Team Brad
