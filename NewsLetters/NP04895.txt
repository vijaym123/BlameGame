David --
President Obama has done so much for so many people. And he&rsquo;s done it against unprecedented Republican obstruction.
It hasn&rsquo;t been easy. But President Obama kept fighting for us.
So we owe this to him: we have to do everything we can to give President Obama a Congress he can work with for his final 2 years.
David, every dollar you give today helps us get one more Obama voter to the polls. This election is teetering on a knife&rsquo;s edge. If we&rsquo;re going to give President Obama a Democratic victory, we need as much help as we can get in these final days. Can you help?
