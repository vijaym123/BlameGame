Rep. Cuellar Announces Night at the Museum Events at Smithsonian Museums in Washington
Dear Friend,
If you and your family are planning a visit to Washington, I want you know that my office can help. My office can help you
request a tour of the United States Capitol, the White House, the Supreme Court, and much more.
I would like to inform you of a new opportunity for families with young children visiting Washington.
The Smithsonian Museum will be hosting "Night at the Museum" events at the National Museum of American History and the National Museum of Natural History.
These overnight events are a great opportunity for families visiting Washington to provide an eye-opening experience for young children.
Children between the ages of 8-12 have the option of choosing a night of fun that features tours, games, crafts, a film, and more at either museum.
There must be at least one adult (21 and over) for every three children in any registered group. 2014 Sleepover dates for the Museum of American History are May 9, June 20, July 18, August 1, and August 15 and June 28, July 12, July 26, August 8, and August 22 for the Museum of Natural History.
Rep. Cuellar speaks to visiting students on the Capitol Steps about the importance of education and ways his office can help students learn more about the nation's Capitol.
For more information about the Sleepover Events, visit the Smithsonian's website
HERE
or call (202) 633-3030 Monday through Friday between 9am-5pm EST.
Also, make sure to read more about the
Museum of American History
or the
Museum of National History
on their official websites.

for more and remember to request any tour at least three weeks in advance of travel.
Sincerely,
Henry Cuellar
