Dear Friends,
This Saturday is February 14th - Happy Valentine's Day! While I'm
confident you have a special day planned for your Valentine, don't fret
if you've forgotten. I have a tip that can save the day, and perhaps a
lot more than that.
This Valentine's Day, I'd like to propose a more thoughtful gift.
Consider helping your loved ones Get Covered at ChooseHealthDE.com! Now
is the perfect time to help your Valentine(s) enroll in a health care
plan as this Sunday, February 15th marks the end of Open Enrollment for
2015. If you miss the deadline, you'll likely have to wait until next
year to get covered.
More than 19,000 Delawareans have enrolled in a health plan in 2015
already and about 83 percent of them were determined eligible for
financial assistance to lower the cost of their monthly premiums. In
fact, 8 in 10 people across the country could choose a plan with a
premium of $100 or less after financial assistance, based on available
options.
If you or your loved ones are without health insurance, then I urge you
to visit ChooseHealthDE.com and choose a health care plan for this
year. If you'd prefer to sign-up in person or over the phone, then
there are marketplace guides who can help. Find out more information
