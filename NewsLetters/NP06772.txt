Dear Friend,
My job is to get the most bang out of every buck that comes into Ed&rsquo;s campaign. And as we get closer to election day, more and more dollars go out the door -- to the vendors who print our campaign leaflets, to the organizers who put fuel in their cars, and to the phone companies that help us call prospective voters. Spending always ramps up in the last few weeks of an election, and that&rsquo;s certainly true on our campaign. That&rsquo;s why we
have
to hit our $55,000 goal before midnight tonight. Can you chip in $5?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
I take a lot of pride in running an efficient operation, and I&rsquo;m always looking for new cost-saving measures. But there are limits to the magic I can perform.
The money going out the door is basically a fixed cost. That means that there isn&rsquo;t much flexibility on the other side of our balance sheet.
Simply put, we have to hit our fundraising goals, or else we can&rsquo;t run the campaign Massachusetts deserves. You can help make that happen. By contributing $5 before midnight, you&rsquo;ll get us closer to our $55,000 goal and keep us on track for victory in November.
Thanks for helping Ed&rsquo;s campaign.
