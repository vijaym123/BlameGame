Welcoming
Caroline Lucille
Brooke and I are elated to share with
you the exciting news of the birth of our first baby, a beautiful little
girl named
Caroline Lucille . Caroline was born on
Thursday, November 7th at Shawnee Mission Medical Center. Both baby and
mom are healthy and at home
resting.
Someone once told us that having a baby is the one chance we get
to help God perform a miracle. Were so fortunate and blessed to add
Caroline into our lives and thankful of Gods miracle of life that
brought her into our family.
On behalf of Brooke, Caroline and I, we appreciate your support
and kind words of encouragement as we start this amazing new chapter in
our lives.
Honoring Vets on Veterans
Day
I was honored to attend a couple of events in the 3rd
District to show support and to celebrate the courage and sacrifice of
veterans in our communities. To all those who have bravely served in
our military, a grateful nation says "Thank you" for your service and
the sacrifices you and your families have made so that we may all live
in freedom.
Monday afternoon, I
was pleased to join many veterans and their families in attending the
Veterans Day ceremony at the
City of Shawnee Veterans Memorial . It was a privilege to
speak a few thankful words to all the veterans who attended. Thank you
to Neal Sawyer, City of Shawnee Council Member, for the invitation to
speak.
A special thank
you to Richard Soetaert for being the Master of Ceremonies for the past
10 years. He's decided to pass the reins on to new leadership.
Thank you for your service,
Richard.
I also had the great honor of attending a special
presentation of World War II medals to Rev. Oliver Lindeblad - receiving
his medals for the first time since his service in
WWII.
Rev. Lindeblad, 95, earned several
medals for his service and efforts during WWII in Italy but had not yet
received them. I was pleased my office helped achieve the much deserved
recognition for his many years of dedication. The medals Rev.
Lindeblad received include the
World War II Victory Medal
(pinned on his sweater), and left-to-right on the board: the
European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal , the
American Campaign Medal , and the
Good Conduct
Medal . The small gold pin on the board is the
World War II
Honorable Discharge
lapel
pin.
I was honored to attend and be with Rev. Lindeblad. Thank you also
to his son Bob for his service to our country, and for the invitation
to join them at their home on such a special
occasion.
We cannot say it too often, thank you again to
all our veterans.
Medicare Open Enrollment
Event
I was recently joined by the Kansas Commissioner on Aging,
Craig Kaberline, and his team of dedicated enrollment counselors to
assist people with their Medicare questions at our second Medicare Open
Enrollment Assistance event at the Matt Ross Community Center in
Overland Park. We had a great turnout and numerous Kansas seniors received
face-to-face help from Medicare benefit counselors.
Medicare
Open Enrollment lasts until December 7th .
Thank you to
Commissioner Kaberline and his outstanding team for all their
help.
Each year there are new health plan and prescription drug
coverage choices to consider and it is our goal to make this decision
process as easy as we can for you. If you missed the opportunity to meet
with one of these trained community counselors, you still have time
to make necessary changes. I encourage you to call
1-800-860-5260
to schedule a free, confidential counseling
session.
Thank you to all the seniors who
attended the event.
