IRS LOSES CRITICAL EMAILS IN CONSERVATIVE
TARGETING CASE
I was a bit stunned to read last week the IRS lost emails
crucial to the IRS targeting probe in a computer
crash. That's not what IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told me last
March when he testified before the Oversight Committee. In the video
of my
questioning, Koskinen tells me Lerner's emails are stored on servers.
He then said, "We can find Lois Lerner's emails." Even Twitchy
picked up on the story. When I specifically
asked him, "Are you or are you not going to provide this committee ALL
of Lois Lerner's emails," he answered, "Yes." Last night I told Sean
Hannity
we need to bring in the nerds to testify about
how and if those emails were lost. Earlier this week, I spoke about it
to Fox News on Special Report
and America's Newsroom
.
This morning, my colleague Paul Ryan got to address Koskinen about the
email losses, telling him, "I don't believe you." The video
is
worth catching.
HOUSE LEADERSHIP CHANGES
Congratulations to my colleagues who were elected
to new leadership positions on
Thursday. California Rep. Kevin MacCarthy will replace Rep. Eric Cantor
as the new House Majority Leader. Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise will
take MacCarthy's place as House Majority Whip. Both men bring
tremendous talents and energy to their respective positions. You can
learn more about Kevin MacCarthy here
.
MISMANAGEMENT BY OBAMA APPOINTEE
AT US CHEMICAL SAFETY BOARD
Dysfunctional leadership, delayed investigations and allegations of
retaliation against whistleblowers were among the many issues dealt
with
in a this week's Oversight Committee hearing of the
Chemical Safety Board. Watch this brief clip
of my questioning to Rafael Moure-Eraso, who was nominated by President
Obama in 2010 to lead the agency. A longer version can be found here
.
The Center for Public Integrity reported
that high profile chemical spill
investigations have taken 4 years to complete under Eraso's
questionable leadership.
A CASINO IN YOUR SMARTPHONE
I am sponsoring legislation to restore America's Wire Act, which would
reverse a recent Obama Administration decision to essentially impose
online gambling on all states. I spoke about this legislation
on CNBC this
week.
TWEET OF THE WEEK
IRS Commissioner testified in March Lois Lerner emails were archived.
