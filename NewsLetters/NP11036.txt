Help With a Federal Agency
Dear Friend-
This week, I had the pleasure of meeting with the leadership and
midshipmen from the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis. My thanks to the
USNA Superintendent, Vice Admiral Michael Miller, USN, and to the
Commandant of Midshipmen, Captain William Byrne, USN, for their
hospitality.
During the visit, I was able to meet with some of the midshipmen from
central and northeast Florida, including from Ormond Beach, Interlachen
and Ponte Vedra Beach. With all the problems we see around us, it is
good to know that many of our best and brightest are willing to place
service above self. I salute these midshipmen for answering the call to
service, and I am grateful that we have institutions like the Naval
Academy that not only foster academic achievement, but also instill
guiding principles such as honor, courage and commitment that are
prerequisites for effective leadership in both the military and
civilian spheres.
On Tuesday, the Supreme Court heard arguments in Hobby Lobby v.
Sebelius, which presents the issue of whether it violates the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act for the government to force the owners of a
family-run business to violate their religious beliefs by making them
pay for abortifacients for their employees, or else face severe
monetary fines.
The administration has granted exemptions from statutory mandates
affecting employer-provided insurance writ large, enumerating minimal
benefit requirements, and forcing individuals to buy
government-directed insurance. The HHS mandate is an executive branch
regulation which, unlike the above, can actually be lawfully amended by
the administration to accommodate religious freedom. Yet, the Obama
administration is even litigating against the Little Sisters of the
Poor, a group of Catholic nuns who care for the sick and elderly. How
can the administration grant exemptions to powerful interests as a
matter of course but refuse to accommodate the religious freedom of the
Little Sisters or Hobby Lobby?
This case does not concern the availability or legality of
contraceptives, and individuals can obtain and use these as they see
fit. The question is simply whether the government can force the owners
of Hobby Lobby to pay for abortifacients in violation of their faith.
Religious freedom is our first freedom which founders such as George
Washington knew that government had a duty to preserve.
Lastly, this week IRS Commissioner John Koskinen testified before the
House Oversight & Government Reform Committee about the lack of
cooperation by the IRS regarding the partisan targeting done by the
agency in the 2009-2012 time period.
The IRS needs to comply with the Committee's subpoena and turn over all
of Lois Lerner's emails. Lerner is at the center of the controversy and
the American people deserve to know the breadth of her misconduct. If
the IRS continues to drag its feet, Americans will wonder what,
exactly, the IRS is trying to hide. Click here to share a graphic on
Facebook
if you want the
truth about the IRS' targeting of conservative groups.

Dear
Friend&#8211;
This
week, I
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
with
the
leadership
and
midshipmen
from
the
U.S.
Naval
Academy
in
Annapolis.
My
thanks
to
the
USNA
Superintendent,
Vice
Admiral
Michael
Miller,
USN,
and
to
the
Commandant
of
Midshipmen,
Captain
William
Byrne,
USN,
for
their
hospitality.
During
the
visit,
I
was
able
to
meet
with
some
of
the
midshipmen
from
central
and
northeast
Florida,
including
from
Ormond
Beach,
Interlachen
and
Ponte
Vedra
Beach.
With
all
the
problems
we
see
around
us,
it
is
good
to
know
that
many
of
our
best
and
brightest
are
willing
to
place
service
above
self.
I
salute
these
midshipmen
for
answering
the
call
to
service,
and
I
am
grateful
that
we
have
institutions
like
the
Naval
Academy
that
not
only
foster
academic
achievement,
but
also
instill
guiding
principles
such
as
honor,
courage
and
commitment
that
are
prerequisites
for
effective
leadership
in
both
the
military
and
civilian
spheres.
On
Tuesday,
the
Supreme
Court
heard
arguments
in
Hobby
Lobby
v.
Sebelius,
which
presents
the
issue
of
whether
it
violates
the
Religious
Freedom
Restoration
Act
for
the
government
to
force
the
owners
of
a
family-run
business
to
violate
their
religious
beliefs
by
making
them
pay
for
abortifacients
for
their
employees,
or
else
face
severe
monetary
fines.
The
administration
has
granted
exemptions
from
statutory
mandates
affecting
employer-provided
insurance
writ
large,
enumerating
minimal
benefit
requirements,
and
forcing
individuals
to
buy
government-directed
insurance.
The
HHS
mandate
is
an
executive
branch
regulation
which,
unlike
the
above,
can
actually
be
lawfully
amended
by
the
administration
to
accommodate
religious
freedom.
Yet,
the
Obama
administration
is
even
litigating
against
the
Little
Sisters
of
the
Poor,
a
group
of
Catholic
nuns
who
care
for
the
sick
and
elderly.
How
can
the
administration
grant
exemptions
to
powerful
interests
as
a
matter
of
course
but
refuse
to
accommodate
the
religious
freedom
of
the
Little
Sisters
or
Hobby
Lobby?
This
case
does
not
concern
the
availability
or
legality
of
contraceptives,
and
individuals
can
obtain
and
use
these
as
they
see
fit.
The
question
is
simply
whether
the
government
can
force
the
owners
of
Hobby
Lobby
to
pay
for
abortifacients
in
violation
of
their
faith.
Religious
freedom
is
our
first
freedom
which
founders
such
as
George
Washington
knew
that
government
had
a
duty
to
preserve.
Lastly,
this
week
IRS
Commissioner
John
Koskinen
testified
before
the
House
Oversight
&amp;
Government
Reform
Committee
about
the
lack
of
cooperation
by
the
IRS
regarding
the
partisan
targeting
done
by
the
agency
in
the
2009-2012
time
period.
The
IRS
needs
to
comply
with
the
Committee's
subpoena
and
turn
over
all
of
Lois
Lerner's
emails.
Lerner
is
at
the
center
of
the
controversy
and
the
American
people
deserve
to
know
the
breadth
of
her
misconduct.
If
the
IRS
continues
to
drag
its
feet,
Americans
will
wonder
what,
exactly,
the
IRS
is
trying
to
hide.
