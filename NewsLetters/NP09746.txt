Please
join me this
Thursday, May 15
for a discussion on
ways we as a community can put an end to human trafficking. This
summit will focus on ways to reduce human trafficking in our local
communities while providing necessary assistance to victims. We will hear
from a panel of local activists, including a law enforcement officer,
nonprofit groups, a UNC Charlotte professor and a survivor of human
trafficking.
As a member of our community, I encourage you to attend so
that we can work together to protect our children and the most vulnerable
from this horrible crime. I look forward to seeing you on Thursday,
May 15!
Please
