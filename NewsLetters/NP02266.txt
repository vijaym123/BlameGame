Dear Friend &ndash;
Did you recently learn about the tax penalty for being uninsured?
Don't panic! Covered California is offering a time-limited opportunity to enroll during special enrollment for consumers who did not realize there was a tax penalty in 2014 or learned they may face a penalty in 2015. From now until April 30, 2015, consumers are eligible to apply for health coverage during special enrollment. Applicants must attest to the fact that they did not realize there was a tax penalty by selecting &ldquo;Informed of Tax Penalty Risk&rdquo; on the drop-down menu.
To start the process and for more information, visit my website at: http://lorettasanchez.house.gov/issues/health-care
Very truly yours,
Loretta Sanchez
Member of Congress
