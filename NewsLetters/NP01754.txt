David -- THANK YOU!
Last week, John Boehner and his corporate cronies raised $17.5 million dollars in one night. We asked you to fight back, and something AMAZING happened. In a single week, 54,741 grassroots supporters like you stepped up to fight back. You just proved that Democratic grassroots supporters truly can stand up to Republican millionaires.
Because of your support, we're holding Republicans accountable!
We just unleashed new ads targeting vulnerable Republicans on their disgusting budget.
We couldn&rsquo;t have done it without your unwavering support. Thank you.
Talk soon,
Nancy Pelosi
P.S. David, Congress comes back from its spring recess in two weeks. What priorities do you want us to focus on? We want your opinion! Take our quick one-question survey &gt;&gt;
