Honoring Montana's heroes on Memorial Day
Folks across Montana gathered today to honor America's fallen heroes - the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation.
I joined hundreds of Montanans in Laurel to dedicate the Yellowstone National Cemetery.
We honor the sacrifices of so many by making sure future generations know their accomplishments.
We honor them by strengthening the freedoms that they died for.
And we honor them by making sure those who live on - their families, their children and their fellow service members - get the care they earned.
Montanans take pride in our state's military tradition. Service is a part of who we are.
And when our loved ones answer the call of duty, we make a promise to take care of them and their famil ies when they return home.
That's why we must do everything we can to improve care at the VA.
That's why we must continue to reduce the disability claims backlog so that veterans can get in the door to receive the high-quality care they earned and be compensated for injuries suffered in service to our country.
And it's why we must make sure service men and women have the tools they need to get good-paying jobs so they can provide for themselves and their families.
Living in a country where we enjoy unparalleled freedom means we have a responsibility to support those who guarantee that freedom.
We must continue to honor our heroes, not only on Memorial Day, but also tomorrow and the day after.
It's an honor to serve you and our military men and women as your Senator.
