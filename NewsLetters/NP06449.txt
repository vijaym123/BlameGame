Dear
Friends,
Thirteen years ago, our
nation was shocked to witness
the terrorist attacks of
September 11th. Americans
across the country, and the
others around the world,
watched these tragic events
unfold before their eyes. In
the days, weeks and months
following these attacks, we
mourned the loved ones we
lost, but we also became
stronger as a nation in our
resolve to move forward and
rebuild in the memory of
those we lost. Today, the
friends and families of 9/11
victims have shown us how to
do this by channeling their
grief and using it as a force
for good, inspiring all of us
to keep the memory of the
victims alive.
On that day, our nation
fundamentally changed. We
asked ourselves what lessons
we could learn to make our
country and the world a safer
place.
Today, we can say that the
mastermind of the attacks has
been brought to justice for
his heinous actions and that
our nations security
and emergency response
efforts are stronger.
However, we still live in a
dangerous world and in
complicated and challenging
times. We cant rest on
our laurels. As chairman of
the Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs
Committee, it is my priority
to assess the threats to our
national security and make
sure the government has the
ability to stop them before
they can bring harm to our
shores.
On Wednesday, I held a
hearing to examine evolving
national security threats
with officials from the
Department of Homeland
Security, the National
Counterterrorism Center, and
the Federal Bureau of
Investigations. From cyber
security threats to
terrorists abroad, there is
much to do when it comes to
securing the homeland. But
that is why, more than ever,
we need to work together and
recapture the sense of unity
that swept over the country
in the aftermath of 9/11.
This anniversary provides
us with an important
opportunity to think about
all the efforts and
sacrifices we have taken to
secure our country since that
fateful day, as well as the
challenges that lie ahead. We
must remain vigilant and
remember that our nation
still faces great challenges
that threaten our safety at
home. In this spirit, I urge
my colleagues in Congress,
Delawareans, and all
Americans to remember those
we lost 13 years ago and to
renew their commitment to
that spirit of unity.
Dutifully yours,
Stay Connected with
