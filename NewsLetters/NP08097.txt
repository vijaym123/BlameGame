What Would You Add to this
List?
This Wednesday, I will be hosting my July Tele-townhall.

Caring for our Veterans
Over the last few weeks,
my staff and I have been busy maintaining an open dialogue with Utah's
veterans and those who have been entrusted to their care.
As
the Senate works on reforms aimed at helping our veterans, I want to
make sure that the lines of communication are open between my office and
Utah's veteran community:

Immigration Reform
I am hearing from many
Utahns about their concerns with how immigration law is being
enforced and with the efforts in Congress to reform immigration policy.
I recently participated in two interviews on this subject to share my
thoughts on this issue that is on the minds of many
Americans:
Lee Responds
to President's Threat to Bypass Congress on Immigration Reform
Sen. Lee urges the president to work with Congress
on immigration
Supreme Court Rulings
The Supreme
Court released their rulings on several important cases during the final
week of June.
These rulings set precedents related to the privacy
of our personal electronic information, overreach of executive power,
and the protection of religious freedom.
I released statements
on three of these rulings:
Riley v. California
NLRB v. Noel
Canning
Burwell v.
Hobby Lobby
Criminal Justice Reform
I
have co-sponsored a bill with Senator Durbin to give judges more
discretion in deciding sentences for criminal activity.
I discussed
this bipartisan effort with Rod Decker in this interview:
Mike
Lee co-sponsoring bill to reduce over-crowded
prisons
Conservative Reform
Agenda
My
conservative reform agenda
is a series of
proposals that I have introduced to apply conservative principles to
increase economic opportunity to lower-income Americans, create economic
security to the middle-income Americans, and to create a level
playing field in the areas of our economy where cronyism and policy
privilege distort and threaten the free market economy.
Fortunately,
many of my colleagues are joining me in this effort:
Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, and the
new era of conservative policy ideas
Regulatory Reform
- Protecting Local Water Rights
Last week I joined over
200,000 Americans and 9 other senators to share our concerns about the
EPA's proposed "Waters of the United States" rule that would give the
EPA vast new jurisdictional oversight over waters traditionally
regulated by states and local governments.
You can read the letter we
sent to EPA Director Gina McCarthy here:
EPA vs. The Fourth of
July
Another Great Teletownhall!
I am looking forward to another
great tele-townhall.
This list hopefully provides a useful
update for some of the issues that have been a top focus of mine, however,
I look forward to hearing what is on your mind as we continue our
open conversation about how we can fix our broken government, protect our
freedoms, and create breathing space for the institutions of civil
society that have always made America work.
