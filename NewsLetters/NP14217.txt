Friends,
Over the last few weeks I have been asking those across Alabama to tell
me their stories about how ObamaCare is affecting them, their families,
or their place of business. Last week, I took to the House floor to
share some of the stories
.
There's Allyson, a wife and homeschooling mother of three from Dothan,
whose family premium doubled from $420 to $940. Shaun, a married father
of two from Montgomery told me that not only did his premiums go up,
but his individual deductible rose to $6,350 and family deductible to
$12,700.
Chris from Montgomery said his premiums doubled as well, saying he "will
not qualify for nor do I want a subsidy." Angela from Greenville said
her family's premiums will go from $417 to $765 a month. Leigh from
Montgomery said her family's premium rose to a whopping $1,374.
And Jim from Prattville shared with me a story that has become all too
familiar in the wake of ObamaCare: the family doctor they have depended
on for decades decided to retire rather than deal with all the new
bureaucratic regulations associated with ObamaCare.
These individuals and families aren't statistics. They are real people
from Alabama's Second Congressional District whose lives are being made
more difficult because of ObamaCare. Not only have Alabamians seen
their plans cancelled, but the disastrous roll out of the ObamaCare
website has made it nearly impossible for those affected to search for
alternatives.
Please take a minute to read this National Journal article
which explains why telling personal
stories about the impact of ObamaCare is so important if we are going
to be successful going forward. Take a moment to share the clip above
with your friends and family on social media
.
Keep Your Health Plan Act Passes
On Friday, the House passed the "Keep Your Health Plan Act"
by a vote of 261 to
157, with 39 Democrats voting for the measure. The President made a
promise to the American people, and now the House of Representatives
has moved to provide legislative reassurance that if Americans like
their health care plans, they will truly be able to keep them.
The "Keep Your Health Plan Act" won't fix every problem with ObamaCare,
but it will offer real choices and peace of mind to Americans affected
by these changes. Similar legislation also has broad bipartisan support
in the Senate, and I urge Majority Leader Harry Reid to bring the bill
forward for a vote right away.
There's no question our efforts to tell the stories of what real people
are going through
has put pressure on the Obama Administration to act,
evidenced by its move to try a so-called "administrative fix" to the
problem. While it is good news that President Obama is finally waking
up and acknowledging this law is hurting people,
ObamaCare can't be
fixed through executive orders.
What we are seeing now is just the beginning. I believe it is going to
get worse. We need to start over and build a health care system that
works. There are many areas of health care policy that Republicans and
Democrats can probably agree on, including guaranteeing access for
those with pre-existing conditions and enhancing competition across
state lines.
But, we don't need a government-run health care system that drives up
health care costs, drags down our economy, and runs doctors out of
business.
Fort Rucker Receives Honors
We are so fortunate to have two outstanding military installations in
Alabama's Second District: Fort Rucker in the Wiregrass and
Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base in Montgomery. Last week, a ceremony was
held at Fort Rucker to recognize the post for receiving two prestigious
honors
:
the 2013 Commander in Chief's (CINC) Award for Installation Excellence
and the 2013 Chief of Staff Army Communities of Excellence (ACOE) Gold
Award.
These honors are a testament to all of the people who work in and
around Fort Rucker. It is particularly important how local communities
rally around our military installations and help support them. I know
it means so much to our men and women in uniform.
I hope you will join me in congratulating all those who played a part
in Fort Rucker receiving these remarkable honors.
The Week Ahead
As a member of the Farm Bill Conference Committee, my staff and I
continue to work toward passing a final bill that will give our Alabama
farmers the certainty they deserve while also achieving long term
fiscal reforms.
The Senate is soon expected to begin debate on its version of the
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the annual bill that
authorizes military programs and sets policy for the Department of
Defense. The House passed our version of the NDAA earlier this year,
and a Conference Committee will be necessary to iron out the
differences. I am optimistic we can pass this important legislation
before the end of the year.
Finally, this week in the House our focus will be on a number of energy
related bills that are designed to lower energy costs and increase
domestic energy production. Specifically, the House will consider:
- H.R. 1900
: Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform Act;
- H.R. 1965
: Federal Lands Jobs and Energy Security Act
of 2013, and;
- H.R. 2728
: Protecting
States' Rights to Promote American Energy Security Act.
As is always the case, if you have questions about this or any
legislation, please do not hesitate to contact my office
. It is an honor to be your voice in Washington.

Over

And
Jim

a

the

Keep

On

the

the
&#8220;Keep

by
a

261

the

The
President
made
a

to
the
American

and
now
the
House

has
moved
to
provide
legislative
reassurance
that
if
Americans
like
their
health
care
plans,
they
will
truly
be
able
to
keep
them.
The
&#8220;Keep
Your
Health
Plan
Act&#8221;
won&#8217;t
fix
every
problem
with
ObamaCare,
but
it
will
offer
real
choices
and
peace
of
mind
to
Americans
affected
by
these
changes.
Similar
legislation
also
has
broad
bipartisan
support
in
the
Senate,
and
I
urge
Majority
Leader
Harry
Reid
to
bring
the
bill
forward
for
a
vote
right

There&#8217;s
no
question
our
efforts
to
tell
the
stories
of
what
real
people
are
going
through
has
put
pressure
on
the
Obama
Administration
to
act,
evidenced
by
its
move
to
try
a
so-called

the
problem.
While
it
is
good
news
that
President
Obama
is
finally
waking
up
and
acknowledging
this
law
is
hurting
people,
ObamaCare
can&#8217;t
be
fixed
through
executive
orders.
What
we
are
seeing
now
is
just
the
beginning.
I
believe
it
is
going
to
get
worse.
We
need
to
start
over
and
build
a
health
care
system
that
works.
There
are
many
areas
of
health

policy
that
Republicans
and
Democrats
can
probably
agree
on,
including
guaranteeing
access
for
those

But,
we
don&#8217;t
need
a
government-run
health

that
drives
up
health
care
costs,
drags
down
our
economy,
and
runs

out

Fort
Rucker
Receives
Honors
We
are
so
fortunate
to
have
two
outstanding
military
installations
in
Alabama&#8217;s
Second
District:
Fort
Rucker
in
the
Wiregrass
and
Maxwell-Gunter
Air

Base
in
Montgomery.
Last
week,
a
ceremony
was
held
at
Fort
Rucker
to
recognize
the
post
for
receiving
two
prestigious
honors :
the
2013
Commander

(CINC)
Award
for
Installation
Excellence
and
the
2013
Chief

Staff
Army
Communities

(ACOE)
Gold
Award.
These
honors
are
a
testament
to
all
of
the
people
who
work
in
and
around
Fort
Rucker.
It
is
particularly
important
how
local
communities
rally
around
our
military
installations
and
help
support
them.
I
know
it
means
so
much
to
our
men
and
women
in
uniform.
I
hope
you
will
join
me
in
congratulating
all
those
who
played
a
part
in
Fort
Rucker
receiving
these
remarkable
honors.
The
Week
Ahead
As
a
member
of
the
Farm
Bill
Conference
Committee,
my
staff
and
I
continue
to
work
toward
passing
a
final
bill
that
will
give
our
Alabama
farmers
the
certainty
they
deserve
while
also
achieving
long
term
fiscal
reforms.
The
Senate
is
soon
expected
to
begin
debate
on
its
version
of
the
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
(NDAA),
the
annual
bill
that
authorizes
military
programs
and
sets
policy
for
the
Department
of
Defense.
The
House
passed
our
version
of
the
NDAA
earlier
this
year,
and
a
Conference
Committee
will
be
necessary
to
iron
out
the
differences.
I
am
optimistic
we
can
pass
this
important
legislation
before
the
end
of
the
year.
Finally,
this
week
in
the
House
our
focus
will
be
on
a
number
of
energy
related
bills
that
are
designed
to
lower
energy
costs
and
increase
domestic
energy
production.
Specifically,
the
House
will
consider:
-
H.R.
1900 :
Natural
Gas
Pipeline
Permitting
Reform
Act;
-
H.R.
1965 :
Federal
Lands
Jobs
and
Energy
Security
Act
of
2013,
and;
-
H.R.
2728 :
Protecting
States&#8217;
Rights
to
Promote
American
Energy
Security
Act.
As
is
always
the
case,
if
you
have
questions
about
this
or
any
legislation,
please
do
not
hesitate
to
contact
my
office .
It
is
an
honor
to
be
your
voice
in
Washington.
