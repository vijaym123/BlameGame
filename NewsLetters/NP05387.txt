Combatting the Spread of Ebola
I am deeply saddened by the tragic impact the Ebola virus has had on
hundreds of people across the globe. In recent weeks we learned that
Ebola has made its way to the United States. While I have the utmost
respect for our medical professionals and a tremendous amount of
confidence in the U.S.'s ability to ultimately find a cure for this
terrible ailment, I am disappointed by the uncoordinated response we've
seen thus far.
This week, I joined many of my colleagues in Congress and called for a
moratorium on travel from the affected nations to the U.S. The U.S.
must take a more aggressive and comprehensive approach to stopping the
spread of Ebola -- starting with restricting travel to eliminate any
further risk. For a full list of Members of Congress joining me in
calling for flight restrictions, go here

Grand Opening of GE Aviation Plant
This week, GE Aviation, a leader in jet engine and aircraft system
production, opened its new advanced composites factory in Asheville.
I'm grateful to GE Aviation for their continued investment in Buncombe
County. The factory will provide hundreds of jobs in the coming years
to Western North Carolinians.

Visiting Local Schools
This past week, I had the pleasure of visiting with students, teachers,
and faculty at North Canton Elementary School, Brevard High School, and
Balfour Education Center. I enjoyed seeing so many smiling faces. If
you are interested in having me visit your school, don't hesitate to
contact my office here

Assisting Western North Carolina's Veterans

Seminars throughout the 11th District to provide practical assistance

country selflessly is a top priority of mine. For more information, go
