Capitol Update November 19, 2013
Bipartisan support for helping you keep the health plan you like
More Americans have lost their insurance coverage than have enrolled in federal health insurance exchanges, according to
figures released last week
by the Obama administration.
Just 2,200 Pennsylvanians have selected a plan through the federal insurance exchange while as many as 225,000 of our neighbors, relatives and co-workers in the Keystone State have lost their coverage, according to
this report
in the
Citizens Voice
newspaper in Wilkes-Barre.
Those lopsided numbers might help explain why legislation that would allow you to keep your insurance plan if you like it received bipartisan support on Friday.
The House passed
H.R. 3350, the proposed Keep Your Health Plan Act , with 39 Democrats voting in favor of the legislation. I co-sponsored this bill, which passed by a 261-157 margin ( Roll Call #587 ). It now goes to the U.S. Senate for consideration.
I voted for the "Keep Your Health Plan Act" in hopes of stemming the flood of cancellation notices, which have been piling up in mailboxes and causing unexpected financial hardship for far too many people in my District and across our country.
People should be allowed to keep their insurance even if the President can't keep his word. The only way to accomplish that goal in a way that passes Constitutional muster is to have Congress pass legislation and have the President sign that legislation into law. Unilateral declarations by the President simply undermine the rule of law and erode the public's confidence in their elected leaders.

Paying tribute to our veterans
Last week, I had the privilege of joining those in communities and organizations throughout the 6th District in paying tribute to our veterans and their families during Veterans Day ceremonies in West Chester, Exton and Valley Forge National Historical Park.
The selfless service of these men and women has secured and preserved our liberty. The tremendous sacrifices of those in our Armed Forces shall always be remembered.

I was pleased to support passage of several bills in recent weeks that would provide greater assistance to our veterans and their families and ensure that our commitment to all those who answered the call of duty never wavers.
Specifically, the House has passed legislation that would:
Improve Housing Assistance :
H.R. 1742, the proposed Vulnerable Veterans Housing Reform Act of 2013, would provide much-needed assistance to our veterans who are struggling to obtain or maintain housing by reforming the calculation for utility allowance payments, as well as excluding any expenses related to a veterans aid and attendance benefits from consideration of income by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Eliminate the Backlog of Disability Claims :
In order to continue efforts to eliminate the backlog in veterans disability claims, the House passed H.R. 2189, which would establish a commission or task force to evaluate this backlog at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
In addition to launching a formal investigation into the backlog, H.R. 2189 would require the production of a report to the Secretary of the VA detailing solutions to the backlog and then require the Secretary to implement appropriate solutions in that report.
Coordinate Economic Opportunity Programs : H.R. 2481, the proposed Veterans Economic Opportunity Act of 2013, would consolidate all economic opportunity programs offered through the VA within a newly created Veterans Economic Opportunity Administration (VEOA).
The VEOA would be responsible for the administration of
such programs including vocational rehabilitation and employment programs, educational assistance programs, veterans housing loan programs, and the Veterans Small Business Program. In addition, H.R. 2481 would create an Undersecretary position to coordinate administration of these important programs.
All of the above-mentioned bills await consideration by the U.S. Senate.

150th Anniversary of Gettysburg Address
Today marks the 150th anniversary of President Lincoln's eloquent tribute to the 10,000 Union and Confederate soldiers who gave their lives during the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863.
Few places in the U.S. rival the hallowed ground at Gettysburg -- the site of the bloodiest fighting during the Civil War.
The National Park Service
has done an outstanding job throughout the year coordinating events to commemorate this most solemn anniversary and to allow all of us to reflect on how the events that took place in Gettysburg affected the course of our history.
Dignitaries from the Commonwealth and the federal government will observe the anniversary by gathering today at the Soldiers' National Cemetery where Lincoln delivered his 272-word address 150 years ago.
President Obama, who used the Lincoln Bible during his first inauguration, will not travel to Pennsylvania this morning to mark the anniversary.
