Dear Friends,
I invite all high-school-aged women in my Congressional District to join me for an inspirational morning to learn empowering communication, meet role models working in STEM professions and get practical money management advice. This FREE event on the Facebook campus will give you ideas and tools to become tomorrow&rsquo;s leaders and innovators!
We will have great speakers and workshops focusing on Science, Technology, Engineering and Math education and smart financial planning for the future. Space is limited to the first 200 high school students, so
sign up early ! Also, please note that if your parents want to join you, they must
