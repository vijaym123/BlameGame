Meeting with Veterans from Across NH
Hi All!
I hope you all had a terrific weekend. On Monday, I joined a number of
veterans' advocates in Concord to discuss many of the issues facing the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Last week, I visited Taylor Rental
in Concord, where I announced my new bill to support growth and job
creation for small businesses.
Hearing from the Veterans Community about Issues at the VA
On Monday, I had the opportunity to meet with a number of veterans'
advocates, representatives from Veteran Service Organizations, and
state veterans agencies to discuss the ongoing issues at the VA. As a
member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, I take great honor in working
on behalf of the men and women that serve our country. An essential
part of fighting for veterans is finding out exactly what they need,
and I am grateful to the Granite State veterans' community and the
roundtable participants for sharing their experiences and suggestions
on how to move forward.
In the wake of the troubling revelations concerning wait times at the
VA and Secretary Shinseki's resignation, it is critical that we plot a
course forward together to ensure that every veteran is taken care of
and has access to the health care and services he or she needs. On
Monday, we discussed a number of approaches to increasing health care
access for New Hampshire veterans, including expanding high-demand
specialty services at VA medical centers, contracting with private
sector hospitals, and collaborative partnerships between veteran
organizations and agencies. I look forward to working with veterans
from across the Granite State to improve care and services for the
courageous men and women who have sacrificed so much to protect our
great country.
Visiting with Taylor Rental President Mark Dartnell
Working for Entrepreneurs in the Granite State
I recently visited Taylor Rental in Concord to announce the
introduction of my new bill, H.R. 4501, the Small Business Growth and
Investment Act, which provides a tax break for small businesses like
Taylor. I introduced the bill on the company's behalf, after Taylor
Rental President and Owner Mark Dartnell explained how the tax credit
would help the company save tax dollars that could then be used for
hiring and job creation.
Small businesses like Taylor are the backbone of our state's economy,
and as a member of the House Small Business Committee, I have long
fought for tax incentives that will help our local companies succeed. I
urge my colleagues to immediately pass this legislation, which will
free up thousands of dollars in funds for companies like Taylor to hire
more Granite State workers and contribute to our state's economic
success.
My Staff is Here to Help
Earlier this year, I was contacted by retired federal employee David
Duncan who was having trouble changing his Medicare deduction from his
personal bank account to his federal pension benefit. After struggling
with this issue for almost a year, David contacted me and my staff was
able to expedite the process and helped resolve the issue. If my office
may ever be of assistance with a problem you are facing, please contact
us at 603-226-1002 so we may help you resolve your problem or get you
the information you need.
Have a good week and thanks for everything you do to make New Hampshire
such a wonderful place to live!

Meeting
with
Veterans
from
Across
NH
Hi
All!
I
hope
you
all
had
a
terrific
weekend. On
Monday,
I
joined
a
number
of
veterans&#8217;
advocates
in
Concord
to
discuss
many
of

issues
facing
the
Department
of
Veterans

small

On

I
had
the
opportunity
to
meet
with
a
number
of
veterans&#8217;
advocates,
representatives
from
Veteran
Service
Organizations,
and
state
veterans
agencies
to
discuss
the
ongoing
issues
at
the
VA.
As
a
member
of
the
Veterans
Affairs
Committee,
I
take
great
honor
in
working
on

of
the
men
and
women
that
serve
our
country.
An
essential

of

is
finding

and
I

community
and
the
roundtable
participants
for
sharing
their
experiences
and
suggestions
on
how
to
move
forward.
In
the
wake
of
the
troubling

concerning
wait
times
at
the
VA
and

resignation,
it
is
critical
that
we

to
ensure
that
every
veteran
is
taken
care
of
and
has
access
to
the
health

he
or
she
needs. On

we
discussed
a

the
courageous

who
have
sacrificed
so
much
to
protect
our
great
country.
