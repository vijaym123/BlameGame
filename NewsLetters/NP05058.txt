Dear Friend,
All across the Commonwealth, organizers and volunteers are working long hours to get out the vote in this year&rsquo;s elections.
Those organizers are giving their blood, sweat, and tears to this campaign. We need to support their efforts, and doing that takes money. Our success or failure in this year&rsquo;s elections will come down to our GOTV operation. Our organizers need resources -- you can help them get out the vote by getting us $5 closer to our final $16O,OOO monthly goal.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Contributing to our campaign isn&rsquo;t just an investment in this election -- it&rsquo;s also an investment in the policies we&rsquo;ve been fighting for.
Many of our progressive priorities are still works in progress, and we&rsquo;re not going to raise the minimum wage or guarantee equal pay for equal work with Republicans in control of the Senate. This is our last deadline goal before the election. This is when your contributions can do the most good. Give $5, $10, more if you can, and help us win this race.
Thank you.
Ed
