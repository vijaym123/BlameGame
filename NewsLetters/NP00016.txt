Flexibility
Dear Friend,
There has been a robust debate recently surrounding H.R. 465, the
Working Families Flexibility Act of 2015 , of which I am a cosponsor.
This legislation provides a choice for private sector workers that public sector workers have enjoyed for nearly 30 years. There are some misconceptions this bill would eliminate overtime pay for workers. Lets be clear: This bill does not overturn or alter the
Fair Labor Standards Act
and it does not replace overtime pay. I would not support any measure that denies hardworking folks
whether here in Michigan or across the country
their hard-earned pay.
Under the
Working Families Flexibility Act of 2015 , if an employee would like their overtime work to be compensated by taking time off from work (flex time) rather than receiving monetary compensation, it is their choice to do so. Congress has worked to protect workers right to be justly compensated, and the choices provided by this legislation maintain all protections under current law. This legislation specifically prohibits intimidation or coercion by employers who do not follow the law, and it allows the Department of Labor to intervene just as they have while enforcing the
Fair Labor Standards Act
for more than 70 years.
The
Working Families Flexibility Act of 2015
is designed to help employees have time in lieu of money to, for example, take care of a sick family member at home without sacrificing a days pay, save up some extra time in anticipation for the arrival of a new baby, or earn some extra days off for a family vacation. This legislation assures that any time worked is compensated in the form that fits the employees needs.
At any time, an employee can cash out their flex-time hours and receive the same overtime pay in place. At the end of the year, all unused flex-time must be paid in full to the employee.
Bottom line: If an employee wants overtime pay, they receive it. If they want extra time off, it is there as an option
no questions asked. Employees and employers should have the freedom to negotiate a mutually agreeable work schedule. This legislation offers exactly what it says: Fair compensation for working families to have the flexibility to choose time or money in exchange for their hard work.
