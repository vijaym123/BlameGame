Keep Your Health Plan
Act Passes
House
Click here to watch my remarks on the House
floor .
To the more than 473,000 hardworking
North Carolinians receiving insurance policy cancellation notices,
President Obamas promise that "if you like your health care plan, youll
be able to keep your health care plan" is ringing hollow. Last
Thursday, the President announced his intention to allow insurers to keep
offering cancelled plans for one year. Unfortunately, a one-year delay
does not make good on his promise. To fix his flawed law, the President
should be working with Congress rather than around us.
Many Democrats have claimed Republicans are only pushing to
repeal the health care law rather than trying to fix it, but that is just
not true. So far this Congress, Republicans have introduced 102 bills
designed to remedy the broken areas of Obamacare that are harming
American families. In contrast, Democrats have introduced a mere 17.
On Friday, Republicans brought
another fix to the House floor. I am pleased that 39 of our Democratic
colleagues joined us in supporting the Keep Your Health Plan Act,
which allows families across the country to keep their policies without
penalty. For every one person who enrolls in Obamacare, 50 more are
receiving cancellation letters. The House of Representatives came
together to put our constituents first and protect them from one of the many
negative consequences of President Obamas health care
law.
H.R. 3350 passed the House in a vote of
261157.
Oversight Hearing on
Healthcare.gov
Click here to watch my preview of the Oversight hearing with
Greta Van Susteren .
At last week's Oversight and
Government Reform hearing, I questioned White House chief technology
officer Todd Park and other administration officials about their
responsibility to the American people to fix the disastrous rollout of
Healthcare.gov. According to Mr. Parks testimony, the website can
currently only handle 17,000 accounts per hour. When I later inquired how
many people the website will eventually be able to accommodate at any
given time, the officials stated 30,000. There is a problem with that
number: With 50 million people currently uninsured, the system must
actually be able to handle a minimum of 43,000 people per hour if all
uninsured Americans plan to enroll by January 1,
2014.
Enrollment numbers released by the Obama
administration last week reflect Obamacares wide-reaching problems. The
administration initially projected enrolling 800,000 people in the exchanges
within the first two months, a figure that was later scaled back to
500,000. In reality, the numbers show that 106,185 people have enrolled in
health insurance plans, and only one-fourth of those enrollments have
come through Healthcare.govs federal exchanges. The administrations
enrollment figure also includes people who have selected a plan but
not yet purchased it.
The hearing
highlighted the administrations disappointing decision to once again
put politics ahead of the American people by launching the website far
before it was ready. The fact that Henry Chao, Healthcare.govs chief
project manager and the man in charge of recommending the website for
launch, was not included on a memo by the agencys chief information
officer outlining the sites high-risk security failures demonstrates
just how chaotic the entire Healthcare.gov development process has
been. As constituents across my district face premium spikes and lost
coverage due to President Obamas broken promises, the last hurdle they
should have to face is a broken website. You deserve better.
