Dear Friends,
You've seen the headlines --
thousands of coal miners in West Virginia are losing their jobs and are
struggling to find new employment. That's why I introduced the Coal Jobs
Protection Act -- to stand up for our jobs, for our economy, for our
way of life.
I'm so pleased to share with you that the House
Transportation &amp; Infrastructure Committee -- of which I am a
senior member -- voted 28-24 this week to report out my bill, which would
push back on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys overreach in
the coal permitting process.
The reason why our mines are
closing, why our miners are now in the unemployment line is clear
regulations impacting both the production and use of coal are crippling the
markets for this West Virginia commodity. This legislation is of
utmost importance to West Virginia, to West Virginians who depend on the
paychecks that coal produces, and to West Virginia communities that
rely on the tax dollars they bring.
The Coal Jobs Protection
Act would also prevent the EPA from dragging its feet in deciding on
permits, ending delays that cost West Virginia jobs. Regulators would be
given clear deadlines for action on permit applications. It would
also add transparency and efficiency to the regulatory process by
stopping the EPA from enacting guidance that has not been open to public
notice and comment.

bill.
INVESTING IN OUR
INFRASTRUCTURE
More than 700,000 jobs and 6,000 road and bridge projects nationwide
could be in jeopardy if payments from the federal Highway Trust Fund
are delayed. In West Virginia alone, more than 200 highway projects
currently receive federal funding.
Our nation needs
well-maintained roads and bridges to ensure safe drives for families and
to promote interstate commerce. However, the current Highway Trust
Fund crisis
threatens the future of these projects and the jobs they
create.
The House of Representatives joined together this
week to pass bipartisan legislation to
avert this crisis and fund highway
projects through May 2015 -- without raising or creating new taxes.
Highway investment is crucial to West Virginia, and I
hope the Senate will follow the House in passing a common-sense highway
bill and investing in our nations transportation
future.
I spoke on the House floor about the importance of funding our
nation's road projects.

SUPPORTING
SCOUTING
I
was interviewed Thursday by a West Virginia Girl Scout, Carolyn Park of
Ranson, about the role Girl Scouts played in my life and how girls can
learn leadership skills. Thank you, Carolyn!
REINING IN THE
IRS
On Wednesday, I voted yes on legislation that
would prevent the Internal Revenue Service from spending any money to
infringe on the rights of Americans
no funds to target groups for
scrutiny based on ideology, no funds to target people for exercising their
First Amendment rights, no funds for the IRS to destroy records
(including emails) in violation of the Federal Records Act, and no funds for
the IRS to implement an individual insurance mandate.
Congress
and Americans
simply wont stand for the conduct weve seen from the
IRS.
The legislation would also ban transferring
funds from the Health and Human Services Department to the IRS to
implement Obamacare, pay raises for the vice president and senior political
appointees, and funds for the Executive Office of the President to
prepare any signing statements or executive orders that contradict
existing law.
Thank you for reading my
weekly
e-newsletter, and
as always, you can join in the conversation on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Shelley
