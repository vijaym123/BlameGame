This week, reports indicate that
Home Depot
may be the latest target of a data breach, following attacks on companies like Target and Supervalu.
In August, the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service issued an
advisory
encouraging all companies to check their systems for malware infections, and noted that over 1,000 businesses have been infected.
In line with that warning, a recent
survey
found that 62% of online users are worried about financial fraud.
In addition to retailers, it was
reported
that large financial institutions, like JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., have also been targets of hackers seeking access to consumer data.
Question of the week :
What steps do you support in order to protect personal consumer information?
(multi-answer)
( ) Enact a federal data breach notification law, because there is no comprehensive federal law governing the protection of data held by private companies.
( ) Increase penalties on businesses that fail to adequately protect consumers' personally identifiable information.
( ) Move to a Chip and PIN system, which authenticates an individuals identity through a computer chip embedded in a credit card and includes a personal identification number.
( ) Ensure that financial institutions and retailers are held to the same standards.
( ) I dont know.
( ) Other.
