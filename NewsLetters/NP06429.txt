NEW POLL: SCHNEIDER 47% -- DOLD 42%
We just got the news:
A brand new poll shows Brad up FIVE points against Republican Bob Dold.
Make no mistake, this is a
big
deal -- but it&rsquo;s anything but a
done
deal. Brad&rsquo;s lead is BARELY outside the margin of error.
If we let up, even for a second, our opponents will pounce at the opportunity to attack.
This is when we need you most. Keep our momentum going by chipping in $5 or more immediately.
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Eight weeks left. No regrets.
