Dear
Friend:
We have had a busy couple of weeks in
Washingtonas Republicans work to restore
the Senate to its role as the
worlds greatest deliberative
body.
Each year at least 100,000 American children
fall victim to the brutal reality of human
trafficking.I took to the Senate Floor to
advocate forabill that both helps law
enforcement better target perpetrators and
assists victims by creating a deficit-neutral
fund to provide for their needs.(You can
see my speech
here .)Unfortunately,
Senate Democrats have chosen to politicize
thisimportant effortinstead of
supporting it as a real means to help victims. I
will continue to work with my colleagues to do
what's right for those who most need our
help.
I recently spoke with Fox's Neil Cavuto
about why Americans see government as the
problem
I also recently spoke out about the
President's proposal for defeating the Islamic
State. In my remarks I said, When America
fights, we should fight to win. I
expressed the historical importance of including
Congress in the proposal, and the importance of
providing our forces with the flexibility and
tools they need to destroy our enemies
abroad.You can view my speech on ISIS and
the Presidents plan
here .
It was an honor to preside during Prime
Minister Netanyahu's speech
Please know that I am equally committed to
defending our freedoms here at home as I am
abroad. To that end, I joined House Ways and
Means Chairman Paul Ryan (R-WIS) in demanding
that the IRS surrender all communications between
the agency and the Executive Office of the
President since January 1, 2010. The Obama
Administration has continually refused to release
communications between the IRS and the White
House. Americans should feel confident that their
private financial information is secure and
protected, and I will continue my efforts until
we get to the bottom of this mess.
Iamcommittedto keeping you
apprised of these and other important issues
affecting Utah and our nation. Thank you for your
continued interest. I encourage you to send me
your suggestions and comments by visiting

Sincerely,
Orrin Hatch
