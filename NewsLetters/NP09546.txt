When Women Succeed, America Succeeds
Click the image above for WDIO's local coverage of our
"When Women Succeed, America Succeeds" economic forum in Duluth.
Dear Friend,
Some of the most successful women I know - including my wife, Mary -
had a clear message for me and my colleagues in Congress at our "When
Women Succeed, America Succeeds" economic forums last week in Chisago
City, Brainerd, and Duluth: women need solid, everyday support systems
in place to help them, and their families, succeed - and to help
America succeed.
We heard great success stories. Alicia Overby began her Cambridge-based
company, Baby Elephant Ears, at home, sewing unique headrests for
babies - and grew the enterprise to become the 2014 U.S. Small Business
Administration's Exporter of the Year. Carol Anderson, Morrison County's
Community Development director, helped take a small business from near
bankruptcy to success after discovering that the company was losing
$100,000 a month by underpricing just one product.
Both of them cited the value of connecting and networking with business
resources, and other experienced women who understand the ups and downs
of starting a business, and emphasized the value of tapping into
existing resources like SBA for advice.
It was said women need a federal minimum wage that is also a living
wage - at least $10.10 an hour, regularly adjusted for inflation.
Two-thirds of all minimum wage earners are women. And many of those
women are principle family breadwinners.
It was said women and families need affordable child care. At today's
minimum wage a woman will earn about $14,000 a year - about the same
annual cost to send a child to daycare. When you account for taxes and
withholding, you're actually paying to go to work. Nobody should be
losing money by working.
It was said women need affordable college tuition and college loan
interest rates, because education is key to a good job and advancement
in the workplace, whether it be for them or their children.
And speaking of the workplace, virtually all of the women on our panels
and in our audiences spoke of the need for fair workplace policies to
assure equal pay for equal work - policies that provide time off for
working mothers to care for sick children, and allow them to see the
doctor themselves when the need arises.
Our final "When Women Succeed, America Succeeds" forum is set for
Hibbing Community College on Thursday, June 5th from 11:30 to 1:00 p.m.
I would love to see you there.
Meanwhile, if you're interested in starting your own business, I hope
you'll make my office your first call. We can direct you to a host of
resources to help you succeed, or you can peruse more resources here
. For starters, our state's Small
Business Development Centers offer professional expertise and guidance
for entrepreneurs at every stage of starting a business - click here

Sincerely,

A Thank You to Our Yellow Ribbon Families & Communities
With COL Frank Stokes of the 148th Fighter Wing, recognizing Mary Linda
Sather, author of "Boo Boo Bears Mission," for being an outstanding
volunteer for Duluth's local Beyond the Yellow Ribbon Program last
Saturday at the University of Minnesota - Duluth campus.
We have a moral obligation to protect and serve the men and women - and
their families - who protect and serve us, both at home and abroad. On
Saturday, I had the great fortune of recognizing Lori Moe of Wells
Fargo and Mary Linda Sather for their outstanding volunteer work with
Duluth's local Beyond the Yellow Ribbon Program - a volunteer program
of community-based support for our Army and Air National Guard troops.
Yellow Ribbon is a remarkable and important program, helping not only
to ease the transition of soldiers to civilian life by providing job
training, counseling, and support services to our returning
service-members and military families - but also to ease the minds of
troops currently serving abroad, and are concerned about the wellbeing
of the family they left behind. Yellow Ribbon volunteers will mow the
lawn, give them a ride across town, or take out the trash. It's by
providing small, everyday services like these that remarkable
volunteers like Lori and Mary Linda demonstrate the thanks and
appreciation of an entire grateful nation.

Statement on Veterans Affairs Deaths in Arizona
We must leave no stone unturned in getting to the bottom of these
serious and disturbing reports regarding the atrocious wait times at
certain Veterans Affairs (VA) clinics in Arizona, in some cases leading
to veterans dying while awaiting care.
However, it is important to understand that the deeper problems at the
Veterans Administration, and the continued unconscionable backlog in
processing disability claims, stem from long-term, chronic, and severe
underfunding in modernizing and digitizing their record-keeping and
electronic communication systems. Last year, the Republican majority
voted down an amendment I and many others worked hard to pass that
would have doubled funding to hire more VA personnel to help eliminate
the backlog.
The good news is we are making progress on the backlog, and on funding
a wide range of health, transportation, education, and housing programs
for vets. In fact, this year's bipartisan veterans bill increases
funding to attack the backlog and expand veterans programs here at home
by $1.5 billion. The point is, those funds, and more, should have been
allocated a long time ago, to help assure that the brave men and women
who put themselves in harm's way to protect and serve us are properly
rewarded, recognized, and cared for with all the resources a grateful
nation has to give, and I will continue to do everything in my power to
direct as much funding as possible to these necessary improvements.

Curtains for Invasive Carp!
The Water Resources Reform and Development Act will come up for a vote
as early as tomorrow (Tuesday). The bill includes:
.
(1) my amendment to protect the entire Mississippi
watershed, along with most all of our northern Minnesota lakes, rivers,
and streams, from invasive carp - also known as Asian carp - by closing
the St. Anthony Lock and Dam in Minneapolis.
.
(2) A companion amendment that redefines "invasive species"
to include animals well as plants - providing the Army Corps of
Engineers with money and authorization to do research and abatement on
zebra mussels and hundreds of other forms of animal life that threaten
the Mississippi watershed, the Great Lakes, and waterways throughout
our nation.
.
(3) An amendment to prevent raids on the Harbor Trust Fund
for purposes unrelated to critical maintenance of our harbors and
waterways. This measure will drive commerce and jobs by helping
alleviate a 10-year dredging and maintenance backlog that now forces
cargo ships on Lake Superior to operate at just 80 percent of capacity -
limiting the amount of iron ore, timber, agricultural, and manufactured
goods we can move through Duluth Harbor during the shipping season.

Our Week in Pictures
At our Chisago County women's forum, topics ranged from overcoming
obstacles to starting your own business, to finding affordable child
care while working full time. Panelists included Sarah Anderson of
Schlagel Incorporated, Marie Rivers of Svens Clogs, Alicia Overby of
Baby Elephant Ears, Becky Lourey of Nemadji Research Corporation, and
Nancy Hoffman, the Executive Director of the Chisago County Economic
Development Authority.
At our Brainerd forum, we invited Don Hicknam of the Initiatives
Foundation, Karen Kirt, Carol Anderson, Morrison County Director of
Community Development, my wife Mary Nolan, Meg Thoreson, Women's
Business Center Director with the Entrepreneur Fund, and Janelle Riley
of Syvantis Technologies.
Karen Kirt told the Brainerd panel that as she was starting her own
business, she often thought of Eleanor Roosevelt's quote, "Do one thing
every day that scares you." She started to do just that - and now, as
she explained, nothing scares her.
Speaking with a constituent at our "When Women Succeed, America
Succeeds" forum in Duluth, where we discussed what federal policy
changes would make it easier for women to go into business for
themselves. I was joined onstage by female entrepreneurs like Lucie
Amundsen of Locally Laid Eggs, Karen Haedtke of UMD's Center for
Economic Development, Briana Von Elbe of Pearson & VonElbe Advertising,
and Lynn Burbank of UMD's Continuing Education.

Coming Up in Washington
.
Later this week, the House will consider the National
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) - which may include my amendment to
prevent future waste, fraud, and abuse of American taxpayer's money in
Afghanistan. My amendment requires that Defense Department officials
submit a plan for proper oversight before they issue a new construction
contract - ensuring that our tax dollars are either spent appropriately
or not at all.
.
The full House of Representatives is expected to consider
several bills next week, including one of which I am an original
cosponsor - the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. This would
create a budget-neutral fund for the young victims of sex trafficking
to ensure these survivors receive the medical services and counseling
they need.
.
I and other members from the House Transportation &
Infrastructure Committee will sit down with Secretary of
Transportation, Anthony Foxx, to discus reauthorization of our federal
highway and transit programs, to ensure America's roads are smooth and
our bridges are safe.
_____
Coming Up in Minnesota
.
We've just announced Congress Comes to You meetings
throughout Minnesota's 8th District - from Little Falls, Royalton, and
Walker to Askov, Milaca, and Mora, my staff will be available for you
to stop by and share your ideas or concerns. A few of these meetings
will be "Senior Dining" events, focused solely on seniors issues, such
as Social Security disability claims, Medicare, or veterans' benefits.
Check my website for the full listing:

Finally...
We've Got an Art Contest Winner!
Nate Choi, a senior at Duluth Marshall, poses with his 1st-place piece,
"Topper Hockey Pride," honoring the Duluth Marshall "Hilltoppers"
hockey team, last week in my Duluth Office.
A huge congrats to Nate Choi, a 12-grader at Duluth Marshall, for
coming in 1st place in our 2014 Congressional Arts Contest! Each
spring, as a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives, I sponsor a
district-wide high school arts competition to recognize and encourage
the terrific artists we have in Minnesota's 8th District. Nate's
winning piece, "Topper Hockey Pride," in honor of the Duluth Marshall
hockey team, the Hilltoppers, will be displayed for one year in the
halls of the U.S. Capitol, and Nate will receive a trip for himself and
a parent or guardian to come to Washington for the unveiling.
Runner-ups' submissions will be proudly hung in our Duluth office.

Thank you to all our very talented 8th District artists who
participated! We received some truly remarkable submissions this year -
you should all be immensely proud of yourselves.

Dear

Some of
the
most

I
know &#8211;
including
my

Mary
&#8211;
had
a
clear

Congress
at
our

&#8211;
and

Alicia
Overby

her
Cambridge-based

Baby
Elephant
Ears,
at
home,
sewing
unique
headrests
for
babies
&#8211;
and
grew
the
enterprise
to
become
the
2014
U.S.
Small
Business
Administration&#8217;s
Exporter
of
the
Year.
Carol
Anderson ,
Morrison
County&#8217;s
Community
Development
director, helped
take a
small
business
from
near
bankruptcy
to
success
after
discovering
that
the
company
was
losing
$100,000
a
month
by
underpricing
just
one
product.
Both
of
them
cited
the
value
of
connecting
and
networking
with
business
resources,
and
other
experienced
women
who
understand
the
ups
and
downs
of
starting

and
emphasized
the
value
of
tapping

It
was
said
women
need
a
federal
minimum
wage
that
is
also
a
living
wage
&#8211;
at
least
$10.10
an
hour,
regularly
adjusted
for
inflation.
Two-thirds
of
all
minimum
wage
earners
are
women.
And
many
of
those
women
are
principle
family
breadwinners.
It
was
said
women
and
families
need
affordable
child
care .
At
today&#8217;s
minimum
wage
a
woman
will
earn
about
$14,000
a
year
&#8211;
about
the
same
annual
cost
to
send
a
child
to
daycare.
When
you
account
for
taxes
and
withholding, you're
actually
paying
to
go
to
work.
Nobody
should
be
losing
money
by
working.
It
was
said
women
need
affordable
college
tuition
and
college
loan
interest
rates ,
because
education
is
key
to
a
good
job
and
advancement
in
the
workplace,
whether
it
be
for
them
or
their
children.
And
speaking

virtually
all

Statement
on
Veterans
Affairs
Deaths
in
Arizona
We
must
leave
no
stone
unturned
in
getting
to
the
bottom
of
these
serious
and
disturbing
reports
regarding
the
atrocious
wait
times
at
certain
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
clinics
in
Arizona,
in
some
cases
leading
to
veterans
dying
while
awaiting
care.
However,
it
is
important
to
understand
that
the
deeper
problems
at
the
Veterans
Administration ,
and
the
continued
unconscionable
backlog
in
processing
disability
claims ,
stem
from
long-term,
chronic,
and
severe
underfunding
in
modernizing
and
digitizing
their
record-keeping
and
electronic
communication
systems.
Last
year,
the
Republican
majority
voted
down
an
amendment
I
and
many
others
worked
hard
to
pass
that
would
have
doubled
funding
to
hire
more VA personnel to help
eliminate
the
backlog.
The
good
news
is
we
are
making
progress
on
the
backlog ,
and
on
funding
a
wide
range
of
health,
transportation,
education,
and
housing
programs
for
vets.
In
fact,
this
year&#8217;s
bipartisan
veterans
bill
increases
funding
to
attack
the
backlog
and
expand
veterans
programs
here
at
home
by
$1.5
billion.
The
point
is,
those
funds,
and
more,
should
have
been
allocated
a
long
time
ago,
to
help
assure
that
the
brave
men
and
women
who
put
themselves
in
harm&#8217;s
way
to
protect
and
serve
us
are
properly
rewarded,
recognized,
and
cared
for
with
all
the
resources
a
grateful
nation
has
to
give,
and
I
will
continue
to
do
everything
in
my
power
to
direct
as
much
funding
as
possible
to
these
necessary
improvements.
Curtains
for
Invasive
Carp!
The
Water
Resources
Reform
and
Development
Act
will
come
up
for
a
vote
as
early
as
tomorrow
(Tuesday).
The
bill
includes:
&#8226;
(1)
my
amendment
to
protect
the
entire
Mississippi
watershed ,
along
with
most
all
of
our
northern
Minnesota
lakes,
rivers,
and
streams,
from
invasive
carp
-
also
known
as
Asian
carp
-
by
closing
the
St.
Anthony
Lock
and
Dam
in
Minneapolis.
&#8226;
(2)
A
companion
amendment
that
redefines
" invasive
species "
to
include
animals
well
as
plants
-
providing
the
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
with
money
and
authorization
to
do
research
and
abatement
on
zebra
mussels
and
hundreds
of
other
forms
of
animal
life
that
threaten
the
Mississippi
watershed,
the
Great
Lakes,
and
waterways
throughout
our
nation.
&#8226;
(3)
An
amendment
to
prevent
raids
on
the
Harbor
Trust
Fund
for
purposes
unrelated
to
critical
maintenance
of
our
harbors
and
waterways.
This
measure
will
drive
commerce
and
jobs
by
helping
alleviate
a
10-year
dredging
and
maintenance
backlog
that
now
forces
cargo
ships on Lake
Superior to
operate
at
just
80
percent
of
capacity
&#8211;
limiting
the
amount
of
iron
ore,
timber,
agricultural,
and
manufactured
goods
we
can
move
through
Duluth
Harbor
during
the
shipping
season.
Our
Week
in
Pictures
At
our
Chisago
County
women's
forum,
topics
ranged
from
overcoming
obstacles
to
starting
your
own
business,
to
finding
affordable
child
care
while
working
full
time .
Panelists included
Sarah
Anderson
of
Schlagel

Marie
Rivers
of
Svens
Clogs,
Alicia
Overby
of
Baby
Elephant

Becky
Lourey
of
Nemadji

and
Nancy
Hoffman,
the
Executive
Director
of
the
Chisago
County
Economic
Development
Authority.
At
our
Brainerd
forum,
we
invited
Don
Hicknam
of
the
Initiatives

Karen
Kirt,
Carol
Anderson,
Morrison
County
Director
of

Mary
Nolan,
Meg
Thoreson,
Women's
Business
Center
Director
with
the
Entrepreneur
Fund,
and
Janelle
Riley
of
Syvantis
Technologies.
Karen
Kirt
told
the
Brainerd panel
that
as
she
was
starting
her
own
business,
she
often
thought
of
Eleanor
Roosevelt's
quote,
"Do
one
thing
every
day
that
scares
you."
She
started
to
do
just that
-
and
now,
as
she
explained,
nothing
scares
her.
Speaking
with
a
constituent
at our
"When
Women
Succeed,
America
Succeeds"
forum
in
Duluth,
where
we
discussed
what
federal
policy
changes
would
make
it
easier
for
women
to
go
into
business
for
themselves.
I
was
joined
onstage
by
female

Coming
Up
in
Washington
&#8226;
Later
this
week,
the
House
will
consider
the
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
(NDAA )
-
which
may
include
my
amendment
to
prevent
future
waste,
fraud,
and
abuse
of
American
taxpayer's
money
in
Afghanistan . My
amendment
requires
that
Defense
Department
officials
submit
a
plan
for
proper
oversight
before
they
issue
a
new
construction
contract -
ensuring
that
our
tax
dollars
are
either
spent
appropriately
or
not
at
all.
&#8226;
The
full
House
of
Representatives
is
expected
to
consider
several
bills
next
week,
including
one
of
which
I
am
an
original
cosponsor -
the
Justice
for
Victims
of
Trafficking
Act.
This
would
create
a
budget-neutral
fund
for
the
young
victims
of
sex
trafficking
to
ensure
these
survivors
receive
the medical
services
and
counseling
they
need.
&#8226;
I
and
other
members
from
the House Transportation
&amp;
Infrastructure
Committee
will
sit
down
with
Secretary
of
Transportation,
Anthony
Foxx ,
to
discus
reauthorization
of
our
federal
