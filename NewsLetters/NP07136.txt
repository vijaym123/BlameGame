Mourning the Loss of Joan Bramhall
I am saddened
by the tragic passing of my friend Joan Bramhall. Joan was a much
beloved leader in Morris County and across the State of New Jersey.
An exceptional mother and grandmother, Joan was also second to none as
a public servant.
A former chair of the Morris County
Republican Party, onetime Freeholder and longtime County Clerk, Joan gave
so much of herself serving others. She was also an early role model for
women in politics and government, inspiring countless others by her
leadership and example. My thoughts and prayers are with Joan's family
at this heartbreaking time.
House Addresses the
Border Crisis
Last Friday, the House of
Representatives passed legislation to address the humanitarian crisis on our
southern border.
The bill will allow the children who have been
brought to the United States to be promptly reunited with their families in
their home countries and provides resources to ensure that they are
well cared for during their short stay in the United States. The bill
also provides for increased efforts to secure the border.
Details about the bill can be found
here .

Washington Post
Former State
Department Counsellor, Eliot Cohen,
writing
in the
Washington Post ,
draws on the lessons of
history to explain President Obamas reluctance to support our allies as
they fight to protect their people and their national sovereignty.
Its a must read.
Sen. Joe Lieberman: We Must Support
Our Allies
Former US Senator and Democratic Vice
Presidential nominee Joe Lieberman confirms once again that the
Presidents conduct of United States foreign policy continues to damage
Americas standing in the world and encourages extremists to carry out
further acts of terror.
In his compelling
piece , Leaving US Allies Adrift as Chaos Rises, Senator Lieberman
asserts that strong and consistent support of our allies must be a
foundation of U.S. foreign policy in this unstable and unpredictable
worldfor America's good and the world's.
Salute:
NJ National Guard Unit Begins Deployment to Persian
Gulf
I am honored to salute the New Jersey National Guards
Alpha Company, 2-113th Infantry Battalion, which left this past
Saturday for Bahrain for a one-year deployment. Some 170 troops will be
providing security for a U.S. Navy facility in that Persian Gulf
nation.
These citizen soldiers serve willingly, but at great
sacrifice to their families and careers, as this
article
in the
Record ,
reporting on
their departure, makes clear. They, and their families, deserve our
thanks and gratitude for their selfless service to our nation. They have
my best wishes for a successful
and safe
deployment.
Salute: National Council of Jewish Women, Essex Chapter,
Back 2 School Store
Many thanks to the Essex
Chapter of the National Council of Jewish Women (NCJW/Essex)
for
their annual back to school
event
for children in
need! This remarkable effort gives girls and boys brand new clothes
and school supplies, purchased or donated by NCJW/Essex and its
partners. Although the start of the new school year is still several weeks
away, these students are ready to start in style!
This years highly successful Back 2 School Store was held on
August 3 at Temple B'nai Shalom in West Orange. I salute the National
Council of Jewish Women, Essex Chapter for this generous outreach to needy
students!
