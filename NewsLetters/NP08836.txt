70th
Anniversary of D-Day Renews Our Profound
Commitment to Our Veterans
Dear Friend,
Last week, we commemorated the 70th
Anniversary of the largest seaborne
invasion in our history, which took place
on D-Day. In honor of the anniversary of
this fateful day, I participated in the
National
D-Day Memorial Commemoration in Bedford
to commemorate the Anniversary of the
Allied invasion of occupied France.
The memorial is a lasting and fitting
tribute recognizing the unparalleled
courage that so many American soldiers
exhibited on that historic day. No
community in our country bore a greater
burden on June 6, 1944, than did Bedford,
Virginia, as 19 of its sons gave their
lives to help the Allies secure a pivotal
victory that day against near-impossible
odds. Even though Bedford is separated by
thousands of miles from the beaches of
Normandy, France, its memorial reminds us
that the men who fought and died that day
put all they had at risk for the sake of
freedom and our American way of life.
As we solemnly reflect on the heavy
price our soldiers paid to stop the spread
of tyranny and oppression in our world 70
years ago, let us renew our commitment to
care for those who have served and pledge
to maintain that commitment for those who
will answer the call in the future. Our
servicemen and women represent the best our
nation has to offer, and we owe them our
eternal gratitude.
In addition to commemorating D-Day, I
also spent the past week traveling the
Fifth District,
meeting
with veterans organizations
to gain a
better perspective on the level of care
they are receiving from the Department of
Veterans Affairs.
As we work to address the challenges
facing our nation, we do so with the
sacrifices of our military and our veterans
in mind. That is why we must work to
address the recent reports of severe
mismanagement at the Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA), which has provided service to
our veterans that has fallen woefully
short. We have passed legislation to
address this crucial issue, and it is my
sincere hope that we can implement
meaningful reforms that will provide our
veterans with the service and benefits they
have earned. I stand committed to working
toward this vital goal, which must be
resolved immediately.

While
attending the National D-Day Memorial
Foundation's 70th Anniversary Commemoration
in Bedford, Robert spoke with Bob Sales.
Mr. Sales served with the Virginia National
Guard, 116th Infantry Regiment, 29th
Division Co. B. He landed on Omaha Beach on
June 6, 1944 and was the only survivor of
the 30 men on his landing craft.
Robert
spoke with Brigadier General Stuart W.
Risch, the Commander of The Judge Advocate
General's Legal Center and School, when he
visited the Center in
Charlottesville.
Sincerely,
Washington, DC
