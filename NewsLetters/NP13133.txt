Friend,
Thank you for joining me in sending a message to Speaker Boehner.
By uniting our voices to urge the Speaker to extend emergency unemployment benefits, we are holding him accountable - not just to the extreme wing of his party, but to America as a whole.
Over 35,000 people have signed on to call on Congress to extend long-term unemployment benefits, which sends a strong message about our priorities nationwide.
If you haven&#39;t added your voice, it&#39;s not too late.
Please sign on here .
Your voice matters. Thank you for speaking up. Together, we will make Washington listen.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
P.S.
If you haven&#39;t signed our petition yet,
you can still do so here .
Or, forward this to three friends to encourage them to join us.
