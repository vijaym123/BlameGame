Highlights of the
Legislation
Increases the
flexibility for VA leadership to fire incompetent VA
employees
Provides more ability for
veterans to obtain outside, private sector
care
Will lead to the hiring of more
doctors and the construction of more facilities, in order to lower wait
times for our
veterans
"Nothing is more important than providing
our veterans with the care and respect that they have earned. It was a
privilege to serve as a chief negotiator on the VA Reform Conference
Committee. I am pleased that we were able to come to a bipartisan
solution. These reforms expand the private sector care options available to
our veterans, ensuring that wait times are lower, and convenience is
increased. However, this alone will not fix the cultural problems that
plague the department so as to guarantee quality care for our veterans
in the long run.
That's why I worked hard to ensure that the
bill included measures that will hold bureaucrats accountable for
failing to put our veterans first. These are important steps in the process
of rebuilding the trust that has been broken between our brave
veterans and the VA that should serve them. The corrupt culture at the VA
won't be purged overnight and there is still a lot of work to do.
I
will continue to work with local veterans on individual cases and on
the Veterans Affairs Committee to address systemic problems that
remain."
- Congressman Doug
Lamborn
