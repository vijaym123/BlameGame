Dear Fellow
Nevadan,
On Monday, the Senate took up the Clay Hunt Suicide
Prevention for American Veterans Act. This important piece of legislation
would bolster resources to address the devastating trend of suicide
among our nation's veterans. Unfortunately, this legislation has been
blocked by one Republican in the Senate. But I will continue fighting
to pass the Clay Hunt SAV Act to ensure our veterans have access to
mental health services.
Watch Senator Reid on the Senate Floor calling for the
passage of the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention
Act
As many of you may know, suicide is very
personal with me. In 1972, I received the shocking news that my father had
taken his own life. I know firsthand of the heartbreak caused by the
needless, preventable death of a loved one. Having lost my father to
suicide, working to improve mental health services has been a cause I have
worked on throughout my career.
The reason Clay Hunts
name is attached to this legislation is because of his outstanding
record. Clay Hunt was a Marine. He served two tours of duty in Iraq and
Afghanistan and received the Purple Heart. He was a wonderful human being.
After he got out of the military he went to Haiti and helped with the
earthquake response there. But, ultimately, he was unable to overcome
what happened to him on his combat missions, and eventually committed
suicide.
This is an important bill for our veterans.
Twenty-two veterans commit suicide every day. The Clay Hunt SAV Act is
bipartisan legislation and would commit resources to reverse that trend. I
thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their work to
prevent veteran suicide.
