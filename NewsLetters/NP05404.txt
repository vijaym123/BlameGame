Update on the Ebola Outbreak
Earlier today, the House Energy &amp; Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight &amp; Investigations conducted a hearing with witnesses from several government agencies about the
U.S response to the Ebola outbreak . Hearing included discussion on U.S. travel restrictions to and from the affected countries in West Africa, which I support, and what healthcare protocols should be enacted and followed in our own country.
Because we cannot monitor or adequately screen individuals coming from the countries where the disease is prevalent,
I believe that it is in the interest of our nations safety and security to temporarily discontinue travel into the United States
of foreigners or flights originating from the affected countries
until the outbreak is under control .
What do you think?
If you are a resident of the Fourth District and havent already participated in my poll, please share your thoughts on the following question
here .
Do you support restricting travel to the United States from West Africa in order to prevent the spread of the Ebola virus?
You can also share your opinion with me in the comments of my Facebook page
