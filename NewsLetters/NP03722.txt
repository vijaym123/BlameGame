Comments On Change In U.S. Policy Toward
Cuba, Release Of Alan Gross
On Wednesday, Marco issued the following
statement regarding President Obamas
announcement to dramatically change U.S.
policy toward Cuba following the release of
Alan Gross, an American who was held
hostage by the Castro regime in Cuba for
five years:
Todays announcement
initiating a dramatic change in U.S.
policy toward Cuba is just the latest in
a long line of failed attempts by
President Obama to appease rogue regimes
at all cost.
Like all Americans, I rejoice
at the fact that Alan Gross will be able
to return to his family after five years
in captivity. Although he is supposedly
being released on humanitarian grounds,
his inclusion in a swap involving
intelligence agents furthers the Cuban
narrative about his work in Cuba.In
contrast, the Cuban Five were spies
operating against our nation on American
soil. They were indicted and prosecuted
in a court of law for the crimes of
espionage and were linked to the murder
of the humanitarian pilots of Brothers to
the Rescue. There should be no
equivalence between the two, and Gross
should have been released
unconditionally.
The Presidents decision
to reward the Castro regime and begin the
path toward the normalization of
relations with Cuba is inexplicable.
Cubas record is clear. Just as
when President Eisenhower severed
diplomatic relations with Cuba, the
Castro family still controls the country,
the economy and all levers of power. This
administrations attempts to loosen
restrictions on travel in recent years
have only served to benefit the regime.
While business interests seeking to line
their pockets, aided by the editorial
page of The New York Times, have begun a
significant campaign to paper over the
facts about the regime in Havana, the
reality is clear. Cuba, like Syria, Iran,
and Sudan, remains a state sponsor of
terrorism. It continues to actively work
with regimes like North Korea to
illegally traffic weapons in our
hemisphere in violation of several United
Nations Security Council Resolutions. It
colludes with Americas enemies,
near and far, to threaten us and
everything we hold dear. But most
importantly, the regimes brutal
treatment of the Cuban people has
continued unabated. Dissidents are
harassed, imprisoned and even killed.
Access to information is restricted and
controlled by the regime. That is why
even more than just putting U.S. national
security at risk, President Obama is
letting down the Cuban people, who still
yearn to be free.
I intend to use my role as
incoming Chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committees Western
Hemisphere subcommittee to make every
effort to block this dangerous and
desperate attempt by the President to
burnish his legacy at the Cuban
peoples expense. Appeasing the
Castro brothers will only cause other
tyrants from Caracas to Tehran to
Pyongyang to see that they can take
advantage of President Obamas
naivet during his final two years
in office. As a result, America will be
less safe as a result of the
Presidents change in policy. When
America is unwilling to advocate for
individual liberty and freedom of
political expression 90 miles from our
shores, it represents a terrible setback
for the hopes of all oppressed people
around the globe.

Welcomes Signing Of Venezuela Sanctions
Bill Into Law
On Thursday, Marco welcomed the signing
of
S.
2142, the Venezuela Defense of Human Rights
and Civil Society Act of 2014 , into law
by President Obama.
Marco, one of the bills sponsors,
issued the following statement:
After almost a year of trying
to achieve this important measure as a
response to Nicolas Maduros
violent crackdown on innocent
Venezuelans, I'm glad these sanctions
against corrupt human rights violators in
Venezuela are finally the law. Now
its important that the sanctions
be swiftly implemented to help send a
message to the Venezuelan people that the
American people are on their side as they
seek democracy, freedom and respect for
human rights.
Marco Wishes You and Your Family A
Merry Christmas
