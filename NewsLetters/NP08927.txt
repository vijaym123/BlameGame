CONSTITUENT SERVICES
VISITING DC
June 06, 2014
This week the Senate began moving forward on
legislative solutions to address the crisis at the Department of Veteran
Affairs (VA). On Tuesday, Senators McCain, Coburn, Flake, and I introduced
the
Veterans Choice Act .
This targeted, commonsense
legislation would address the most pressing issues raised by the
continuing VA scandal by providing veterans with greater choice and
flexibility in health care providers and increasing accountability and
transparency at the VA.
The
Veterans Choice Act
was endorsed
by
American Legion ,
Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA ),
AMVETS , and
Concerned Veterans for America
(CVA).
Using the
Veterans Choice Act
as a
starting point, Senator McCain met with Senator Sanders and was able to
negotiate a bipartisan agreement on legislation.
I am pleased we
were able to reach such an agreement -- veterans should not have the
care they deserve and need waylaid by partisan bickering.
The
issues at the VA are systemic and deeply rooted in the agency's culture
-- it will take both parties working together, along with VSOs, VA
officials, and veterans themselves to get VA back to its core mission,
serving veterans.
I would like to thank Senator McCain and Senator
Coburn for their hard work and contributions to this agreement. To

Today holds special meaning for our nation and our
veterans
this Friday marks the 70 th
anniversary of
D-Day.
On June 6, 1944, tens of thousands of Americans and allied
soldiers stormed the beaches of Normandy and fought the battles that
liberated France.
The sacrifices that those men and women made on
D-Day and in the campaign that followed changed the course of
history.
I recently had the chance to visit the Normandy American
Cemetery and Memorial.
The day was bright and the beauty of the
hallowed grounds belied the chaos and struggle that took place on
Normandy's wild beaches and bluffs.
Despite the seemingly
insurmountable odds, freedom prevailed.
Today, we remember those
whose lives were lost during that invasion and we honor all those who
served.
Please take a minute to thank a veteran that you know for
his or her service to our country.
They willingly and unselfishly
put their lives on the line to protect our country and our
freedom.
The legacy of the Greatest Generation has inspired and
sustained the young men and women currently serving our country
abroad.
Today we also remember we still have work to do on behalf of all of
our veterans who return home from the battlefield.
We must
remain unwavering in our commitment to provide for those who were fortunate
enough to come home and who now face their own challenges as they
continue to contribute to the success of this great
nation.
Sincerely,
Richard Burr
