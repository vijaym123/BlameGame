Dear Friend,
Is ObamaCare hurting you? Is it hurting your family or friends? Are you
one of the millions who lost their insurance policy or saw their
premiums skyrocket?
Let your voice be heard at a Congressional Field Hearing in Arizona's
4th District.
The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, of which I am a
member, is holding a field hearing in Apache Junction on Friday,
December 6. The title of the hearing is "ObamaCare Implementation, The
Broken Promise: If You Like Your Current Plan You Can Keep It."
It's a public hearing that will focus on taking testimony from
witnesses whose healthcare plans were cancelled as a result of
ObamaCare. Because this hearing is hosted by the government's primary
watchdog - the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform -
it's a perfect opportunity for you to share how ObamaCare is hurting
you and Congressional District 4.
Please attend this hearing and let your voice be heard. The details are
below:
Friday, December 6, 2013
"ObamaCare Implementation, The Broken Promise: If You Like Your Current
Plan You Can Keep It"
Time: 10:00AM
Location: Council Chambers, City of Apache Junction
300 E. Superstition Blvd,

for more information.
As the hearing approaches, it's more important than ever to share your
ObamaCare story.
Millions of Americans are losing the insurance coverage that President
Obama falsely promised they could keep and their premiums are
skyrocketing. I want to know how this terrible law is hurting you
personally so that we can show President Obama and Senate Democrats the
damage ObamaCare is inflicting on my constituents in Arizona.
