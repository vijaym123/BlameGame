Lawmakers ask State
Department for clarification of space arms policy theyve seemed to develop
secretly without informing the Defense Department,
Congress
(Washington,
D.C.)
U.S. Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) and U.S. Rep. Doug Lamborn
(R-Colo.) urged the U.S. State Department to clarify the
Administrations outer space arms control policy, particularly how it could
negatively impact the United States missile defense capabilities and
anti-satellite weapon purposes.
A
major part of our national security and infrastructure revolves around
outer space, and our continued ability to use satellites and various
missile capabilities, Vitter said. We need to make sure were not
restricting ourselves, especially when China or Russia are pursuing access
to weapons that could destroy U.S. satellites
putting us a greater
national security risks.
Any
proposal for a space code of conduct or an outer space arms control
treaty should only be considered by the United States if it clearly
improves our national security and does not limit our own freedom of
action in space. I am particularly concerned by the potential that State
Department officials may be proposing agreements without any
consideration for the national security implications of their proposals, Lamborn
said.
The Administration has
seemingly embraced the European Unions approach to outer space arms,
which top national security officials have said is too restrictive and
could put the U.S. at an unfair national security risk by not
protecting the U.S.s ability to fully develop missile
defenses.
Vitter and Lamborns letter highlights the
State Department failure to consult with the defense agencies or
relevant key committees. Previously, on Feb. 2, 2011, Vitter along with 37
U.S. Senators warned former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of the
European Unions approach and requested their reasoning for moving
towards adopting the more restrictive
approach.
A copy of Vitter and Lamborns
letter is below.

Mr. Frank Rose
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Space and Defense
Policy
U.S. Department of
State
2201 C Street
NW
Washington, DC
20520
Dear Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
Rose,
We write to ask for your
clarification regarding the Administrations space arms control posture.
Like you, we are deeply concerned by the rising threats of
anti-satellite weapons in the hands of states like the Peoples Republic of
China.
That said, we believe the Administration would do better to
focus on real solutions to these threats, as opposed to more feel good
measures like the European Unions (EU) Code of Conduct for Outer Space
activities or other similar
measures.
We are concerned by proposals for outer space arms control,
including the EU Code of Conduct for Outer Space activities, which the
Administration has embraced.
We see no advantage to such a Code
for the United States; according to assessments by the uniformed
military, implementation of this code would result in real world
operational impacts.
The product of this equation demands the opposition
of the entire United States
government.
With the languishing of that Code, we fear a new
threat to our ability to protect U.S. outer space capabilities, and,
perhaps even to develop our missile defenses.
We seek your
understanding of the Administrations position on space arms control,
specifically, the debris-generating kinetic energy ASAT testing moratorium
which, as we have been informed, you proposed to U.S. allies.
We are
unfamiliar with any such proposal having been coordinated with the
Department of Defense or the uniformed military, and therefore we ask
for your answers to the following
questions:
1)
Please indicate the date, and by which Department
official, the State Department Circular 175 request was signed.
What was the scope of this Circ-175 and has the Department determined
if this moratorium would be submitted to the Senate for its advice and
consent?
2)
If this Circ-175 will not be
submitted to the Senate, on what basis would such an international
agreement be negotiated and to what end?
3)
Please detail the potential implications for United States space and
missile defense activities.
How would such an agreement protect our
ability to fully develop our missile defenses, including our test and
targets program?
4)
Please further
detail how such agreement will ensure full freedom of action for the United
States to take needed defensive and other action in
space.
5)
Please provide the Joint Staff assessment of
impacts to military operations you obtained before discussing this
moratorium with our allies.
6)
Please
detail the specific allies with which you have discussed this moratorium
and the respective dates of discussion.
Please further detail
which State Department official authorized these
discussions.
We appreciate your prompt responses to these
questions.
Sincerely,
CC:
