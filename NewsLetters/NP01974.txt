Friends,
Yesterday, I voted for the House Republican Budget, which passed by a vote of 228 to 199. Our budget puts America on a secure and prosperous path for generations to come. It balances within 10 years, cuts $5.5 trillion in spending and does not raise taxes. Our budget repeals Obamacare entirely and ends its raid on Medicare. It also includes the resources the military needs to defend our country today and prepare for the battles of tomorrow. This is critically important to Georgias many military installations and their communities.
Additionally, by passing a budget, we took the first step in a legislative process called reconciliation. This is important because the House Republican Majority has passed many bills to repeal Obamacare, but the Senate has never passed one. Under reconciliation, a bill repealing Obamacare can pass the Senate and be sent to the presidents desk for the first time. We must show America that the Republican-led Congress will deliver an Obamacare repeal bill to the president.
Freedom First,
Congressman Tom Graves
