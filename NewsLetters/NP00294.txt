WEEK IN REVIEW

Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and the Caple family of
Hackett. Safe travels back home!
On Tuesday, we started this
busy legislative week with the consideration of two important bills. The
first bill, the Commodity End-User Relief Act ( H.R. 2289 ), was passed by a
vote of 246-171 ( Roll Call
#309 ). The bill reauthorizes the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, ensuring that businesses can effectively use the
derivatives market to manage their risk, enhance consumer protections,
and protect job creators from unfair regulations. The second bill, the
Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act, 2016 ( H.R. 2577 ), passed by a vote of 216-210 ( Roll Call #329 ).
H.R. 2577 provides $55.3 billion in discretionary budget authority for
the Departments of Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and
related agencies for fiscal year (FY) 2016. This is an increase of $1.5
billion above FY 2015 and $9.7 billion below the Presidents budget
request. However, given reduced offsets
primarily caused by a $1.1
billion decline in the scoring of Federal Housing Administration
receipts
the bill actually represents an increase of only $25 million above
the current level.
Also on Tuesday, Senator Boozman (R-AR), Senator
Cotton (R-AR), and Senator Alexander (R-TN), Congressman Crawford
(AR-1), Congressman Hill (AR-2), Congressman Westerman (AR-4), and I
sent a letter to the Department
of Energy (DOE)
requesting an extension of the
comment period for the need and feasibility review of the Plains &amp;
Eastern Clean Line Transmission Project, citing
inadequate
communication to let stakeholders know they can submit input on this
project. The
full letter can be
found here . On Thursday, the DOE announced a 30-day
extension. Stakeholders who wish to submit comments by July 13, 2015,
should address written comments as follows: U.S. Department of Energy,
Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE-20), 1222
Program, 1000 Independence Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20585. Electronic
comments can be emailed to
plainsandeastern@hq.doe.gov . The DOE will make
comments available as they are received. Additional information from the
DOE is
available
here .
On Wednesday, the
House passed the Country of Origin Labeling Amendments Act of 2015
( H.R. 2393 )
by a vote of 300-131 ( Roll
Call #333 ). H.R. 2393 brings the U.S. into
compliance with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules that, without immediate
action, would leave businesses from every sector of the economy open
to retaliation from Canada and Mexico that could cost the U.S. economy
billions.
Yesterday, the House passed the Department of Defense
Appropriations Act, 2016 ( H.R. 2685 ) by a
vote of 278-149 ( Roll Call
#358 ). The bill provides the Department of
Defense (DoD) $490.2 billion in discretionary funding and $88.4 billion for
the Global War on Terror (GWOT) for fiscal year 2016. From ISIL to
Boko Haram, America faces new and growing threats daily. Now is not the
time to weaken our military. That is why I was proud to support this
thoughtful, well-crafted piece of legislation, which provides our troops
with the equipment and training they require and the benefits and
services they deserve, while also contributing to the GWOT account and
providing our combatant commanders with the intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance capabilities they need to fight the ongoing war on
terror and keep Americans safe at home.
To wrap up the week, today we began consideration of the
Senate
Amendment
to Trade Act of 2015 ( H.R. 1314 ). The House passed
the Part II (Title I
Trade Promotion Authority; TPA) of Motion to
Concur in the Senate Amendment to H.R. 1314
Trade Act of 2015 by a
vote 219-211 ( Roll Call
#362 ). Part I (Title II), Trade Adjustment
Assistance failed by a vote of 126-302 ( Roll Call #361 ). In order for the package to
be signed
into
law, the House will need to reconsider
Part I (Title II), Trade Adjustment Assistance. I was proud to vote in
support of TPA, which will expand trade relations and create new
opportunities for Arkansans
and all Americans
while demanding
accountability from the Administration throughout the trade negotiation
process. I look forward to TPA being signed into law after continued
consideration of the Senate Amendment to H.R. 1314, which is
expected next week.

Front...
