Rogers Votes to Block EPA Water Rule
Applauds House Passage
WASHINGTON, D.C.
- U.S. Rep. Harold 'Hal' Rogers (KY-05) cosponsored and voted for the
Regulatory Integrity Protection Act of 2015
( H.R. 1732 ) as the bill passed the full House on Tuesday, May 12. The bill reverses a rule proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in April 2014 to redefine the "Waters of the United States" through the Clean Water Act, expanding the agency's jurisdiction to include dry beds and other areas that are "seasonal or rain-dependent."
"This bill will block one of the EPA's biggest efforts to gain power in the US, keeping this rouge agency from taking over every hollow and valley that may have a stream running through it when it rains," said Rogers. "The EPA's rule threatens jobs and our economy. It also restricts landowners and local governments from moving forward with important development projects, so H.R. 1732 is critical to reversing the costly impact of this rule across the country, putting the decisions regarding our nation's waters back into the hands of those who know best."
The bill requires the Secretary of the Army and the Administrator of the EPA to withdraw the 2014 proposed rule to redefine "Waters of the United States" within 30 days of enactment. The legislation holds the EPA and the U.S. Corps of Engineers accountable by requiring that when developing a new rule, the agencies must consider public comments, economic analysis, and must jointly consult with State and local officials about redefining the term "waters of the United States." This will ensure that Kentucky farmers, miners, small business owners, and entrepreneurs have the ability to create jobs and grow the local economy.
Rogers urged the Senate to move swiftly in reversing the EPA's proposed rule.
