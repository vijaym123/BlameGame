Dear
Friend,
This weekend, please pause with your family to
reflect on the Fourth and the Declaration of Independence that it
memorializes. Its the idea that free people can govern themselves, and that
our rights and liberties are inherent to us and do not come from the
government. Governments, instead, are instituted by us to secure those
rights and liberties.
These ideals remain
very much worth the fighting for. Many more Americans than we can
count have worn the uniform to uphold these rights and fallen in their
defense, having mutually pledged to each other their lives, fortunes and
sacred honor. This Fourth, let us keep their sacrifice in mind, and
make it count.
Happy and safe
Fourth,
Pat
