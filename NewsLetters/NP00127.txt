Kansas Common Sense
June 15, 2015
Hello,
Welcome to Kansas Common Sense. Thank you for your continued interest
in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
Consideration of the National Defense Authorization Act
This week the U.S. Senate considered various amendments to the Fiscal
Year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act. I am pleased about the
full, open discussion that has taken place in the Senate this past week
regarding this legislation, which will authorize programs and funding
to support our nations Armed Forces for the upcoming fiscal year 2016.
The bipartisan effort to debate policies relevant to the strength of
our Armed Forces is encouraging, and I am hopeful we will come to an
agreement as we continue to discuss and vote on amendments to the bill
this week.
As part of the effort to strengthen our Armed Forces, I spoke on the
Senate Floor in support of an amendment that I sponsored to make
certain our U.S. Army is able to maintain the current number of Brigade
Combat Teams (BCTs) to prevent further reductions to the total Army
force structure. In the midst of the evolving threats to our national
security, it is more important than ever to ensure our Army remains
ready and resilient. This particular amendment is especially important
to Kansas, where bases like Fort Leavenworth and Fort Riley could face
reductions if the Army is forced to make tough decisions to the
increased budget constraints. It is important that my colleagues in the
Senate support this amendment and understand the real impact on defense
communities, and the morale of the families and soldiers who safeguard
our freedom. Those who call Kansas home and serve in the Big Red One at
Fort Riley and the Intellectual Center of the Army at Fort Leavenworth
deserve to continue their careers serving in the Army and protecting
our nation.
I am also a sponsor of an amendment offered by Senator Mike Lee of Utah
to safeguard the use of military training ranges from the potential
impact of listing the Lesser Prairie Chicken under the Endangered
Species Act (ESA). Its listing could have major consequences on the
availability and use of training ranges, costs of managing impacted
military lands, restrictions of the use of certain weapons and
equipment within training ranges, and prohibit future military
development and modernization. Potentially disrupting activities at
military installations located in the Lesser Prairie Chicken habitat
area is yet another example of the uncertainty and havoc caused by the
decision to list the bird as a threatened species. I will continue to
make the case that more regulations hindering the economy from the
federal government and increased intrusion into lives and businesses of
stakeholders is not the answer for conserving the bird.
Welcome back to Kansas, Major General Grigsby
This week I had the opportunity to meet with Major General Wayne
Grigsby, the incoming Commanding General to lead the 1st Infantry
Division at Fort Riley. Maj. Gen. Grigsby will assume command following
Maj. Gen. Funk, who is currently serving in Iraq. Grigsby is returning
to Kansas after numerous deployments overseas, where he proved to be an
effective warrior and leader. Prior to his deployments he spent time at
Fort Leavenworth
first while attending the Command and General Staff
College, and then years later to pursue a masters degree in military
arts and sciences through the Advanced Military Studies Program. I am
pleased to welcome Maj. Gen. Grigsby and his family back to Kansas to
lead the Big Red One.
Announcing Northrop Grumman New Supplier Symposium
As U.S. Senate Aerospace Caucus Co-Chair, it was a pleasure to announce
that Northrop Grumman Corporation, the Greater Wichita Economic
Development Coalition (GWEDC) and I will co-host a Northrop Grumman New
Supplier Symposium at the National Center for Aviation Training (NCAT)
in Wichita on July 2, 2015. The supplier conference will help
facilitate business between Kansas companies and Northrop Grumman, and
will enable suppliers to meet one-on-one with representatives from
Northrop Grumman.
Given Kansas reputation as the national leader in aviation
manufacturing and job creation, its no wonder global aviation
manufacturers like Northrop Grumman are eager to tap into the talents
of Kansans. Wichita is the Air Capital of the World for good reason
it is the only place in the world that offers 90-years of experience in
aviation manufacturing, access to the worlds largest supplier base,
and aircraft workers and training that are second to none. Because
exports are so vital to Kansas economy and Kansas jobs, our state must
continue to build quality products in order to stay competitive in the
global marketplace. I am proud to host the Northrop Grumman New
Supplier Symposium, which will help make certain that when Northrop
Grumman looks for new U.S. suppliers, it looks to Kansas companies.
There are more than 450 companies in Kansas aerospace industry,
accounting for more than 32,000 direct jobs. Northrop Grumman makes an
important contribution to our states economy, as it currently partners
with more than 180 Kansas businesses. Over the past three years, the
company has committed more than $132 million with suppliers in Kansas,
including more than $30 million in 2014. In addition, Northrop Grumman
employs more than 640 Kansans at facilities in Olathe and Fort
Leavenworth (providing training programs for the U.S. Army, Army
National Guard and Department of State) and Topeka (providing depot
repair for the U.S. Postal Service).Click here
to learn more about the symposium.
Walmart Distribution Center
This week, I toured the Walmart Distribution Center in Ottawa to learn
more about their economic impact on the community. The facility employs
more than 800 individuals making it Franklin Countys largest employer.
The 1.4 million square foot distribution center and warehouse has been
part of the Ottawa community for 20 years and fills orders in support
of both Walmart super stores and smaller market stores.
There are many job opportunities for Kansans at the distribution
center, and Walmart strongly supports hiring our nations veterans. In
addition, Walmart initially projected hiring 100,000 veterans by 2018
regardless of when they left active service. However, in just two
years, they have already hired more than 92,000 veterans
many within
their first 12 months off active service. Walmart is now projecting to
hire 250,000 veterans between 2013 and 2020. I commend the companys
commitment to employing our nations service men and women. Thanks
again to General Manager Tina Albers for the tour and to Mayor Mike
Skidmore, Chamber President John Coen, and Franklin Co. Development
Council Executive Director Jeff Seymour for joining us.
Osawatomie Rotary Club
After my tour of the Walmart Distribution Center in Ottawa I traveled
to Osawatomie, where I visited with members of the Osawatomie Rotary
Club at their weekly meeting. We discussed a number of important local,
state and national issues including the need for banking regulatory
reform and the overreach of the EPA in their interpretation of the
waters of the U.S. We also discussed concerns about the Osawatomie
State Hospital. Thanks to Miami County Commissioner George Pretz for
joining us, and to the several guests of School Superintendent Gary
French. It was also great to see Tim Long, Mike Moon, and the other
Rotarians who were there to meet with me. Special thanks to Ivy Witt
Cole for her welcome and introduction.
Visiting Miami County Medical Center
On Monday, I was in Paola to visit Miami County Medical Center (MCMC).
MCMC is a 39-bed hospital offering a wide range of health care services
to the citizens of Paola and surrounding communities in Miami County.
Recently, MCMC was recognized by the Joint Commission
a health care
accrediting organization
as a top performing hospital in the
treatment of conditions such as heart attack, heart failure, pneumonia
and stroke. The hospital is also designated as an Emergent Stroke Ready
hospital by the American Heart Association, and was awarded a top
rating by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for
patient satisfaction.
When I visit Kansas hospitals and other health providers, I often hear
concerns about the burdens Washington policies place on health care
providers as they work to provide quality care for their patients. My
discussion with MCMC administrators and staff covered various topics
including unnecessarily burdensome and flawed Medicare audit
regulations. Many Kansas hospitals have been forced to divert
significant resources away from caring for patients to appeal incorrect
audit decisions that are ultimately overturned through the appeal
process. This broken Medicare audit program places an unreasonable
burden on providers, and has created a two-year appeals backlog within
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). I raised
concerns about CMS RAC audits in a meeting with HHS Secretary Sylvia
Burwell following her appointment last year, and I continue to dialogue
with the Department on this issue. Also, I included language in the
Senate Fiscal Year 2015 Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill
requiring HHS to account for improving the Medicare audit appeals
process and addressing the current backlog. In April, I submitted
questions to Secretary Burwell on this topic in conjunction with the
Senate Appropriations Health Subcommittees hearing on HHS Fiscal Year
2016 budget request.
I will continue to advocate for regulatory flexibility for rural
hospitals and other health providers to deliver the care that is
essential to Kansas communities. Thanks to MCMC Vice President of
Operations Paul Luce for hosting my visit, and to Inpatient Nursing
Manager Aubree Slayman and Rehab Services Manager Ty McBride for
guiding my tour of the hospital. Thanks also to Miami County
Commissioner Rob Roberts for joining me on the tour.
Cuba Trade Act of 2015
I introduced legislation this week to restore trade with Cuba. The Cuba
Trade Act of 2015 (S. 1543) would grant the private sector the freedom
to export U.S. agricultural commodities and other goods to Cuba while
protecting U.S. taxpayers from any risk or exposure associated with
such trade. Cuba is only 90 miles from our border, making it a natural
market for our nations farmers and ranchers. By lifting the embargo
and opening up the market for U.S. agricultural commodities, we will
not only boost the U.S. economy but also help bring about reforms in
the repressive Cuban government. I am hopeful that increasing the
standard of living among Cuban citizens will enable them to make
greater demands on their own government to increase individual and
political rights.
I have long fought for commonsense changes to U.S. trade policy with
Cuba, which must import the vast majority of its food. In July 2000, an
amendment I offered to allow food, medicine and agriculture products to
be sold to Cuba overwhelmingly passed in the House. This bill will
build on those reforms by rolling back harmful regulations that
continued to hinder trade and by further opening Cubas market to our
commodities and products. The unilateral embargo that has been in place
for more than five decades has failed to effect regime change or lift
up the Cuban people. For the benefit of both agriculture producers and
the people living in Cuba, I believe it is finally time for a new
direction in our Cuba policies. Click here

USDA to Implement Crop Insurance Provision for Winter Wheat
I was pleased to learn this week that USDA will implement the Actual
Production History (APH) Yield Exclusion for winter wheat planted this
fall. The provision, included in the 2014 Farm Bill, is designed to
provide relief for farmers suffering from multiple years of severe
drought. USDA implemented the APH Yield Exclusion for crops planted
this spring, but did not have it ready in time for winter wheat
producers.
Many Kansas farmers have seen significant decreases in their insurable
yields due to failed or very low-yielding crops during the drought.
This provision will ensure crop insurance remains a viable risk
management tool for our farmers by allowing them to exclude certain low
yields from their APH due to severe weather. As chairman of the Senate
Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, which oversees Farm Bill
implementation and crop insurance, I urged Secretary Vilsack at a
hearing earlier this year to prioritize implementing this provision for
winter wheat producers. Its imperative we continue to strengthen crop
insurance to protect the livelihoods of farmers facing the devastation
of damaged or destroyed crops due to severe weather.
Reading Post Office Ribbon Cutting
I joined more than 70 Lyon County area residents on Friday for a ribbon
cutting ceremony to reopen a United States Post Office in Reading. It
has been more than four years since a devastating tornado destroyed
much of the community, including the building where the post office was
located. Since that time, local officials and residents have done an
outstanding job of rebuilding their community
even better and
stronger than before.
There are a number of individuals who deserve recognition including
Jaret Moyer; Lyon County Commissioner Scott Briggs; and Mayor Kevin
Sorensen and City Council Members members Jenifer Hanneman, Todd
Hensley, Heather Jones, Bill Paige and David Siler. Special thanks also
to Jeanine McKenna, director of the Emporia Area Chamber of Commerce
and Cynthia Wilson, representing Reading Community Development, Inc.,
for their involvement in this event.Click here

Consideration
of
the
National

Act
This
week
the
U.S.
Senate
considered
various
amendments
to
the
Fiscal
Year
2016
National
Defense
Authorization
Act.
I
am
pleased
about
the
full,
open
discussion
that
has
taken
place
in
the
Senate
this
past
week
regarding
this
legislation,
which
will
authorize
programs

to
support
our
nation&#146;s
Armed

for
the
upcoming

2016.
The
bipartisan
effort
to
debate
policies
relevant
to
the
strength
of
our
Armed
Forces
is
encouraging,
and
I
am
hopeful
we
will

to
an
agreement
as
we
continue
to
discuss
and
vote
on
amendments
to
the

As
part
of
the
effort
to
strengthen
our
Armed
Forces,
I
spoke
on
the
Senate
Floor
in
support
of
an
amendment
that
I
sponsored
to
make
certain
our
U.S.
Army
is
able
to
maintain
the
current
number
of
Brigade
Combat
Teams
(BCTs)
to
prevent
further
reductions
to
the
total
Army
force
structure.
In
the
midst
of
the
evolving
threats
to
our
national
security,
it
is
more
important
than
ever
to
ensure
our
Army
remains
ready
and
resilient.
This
particular
amendment
is
especially
important
to
Kansas,
where
bases
like
Fort
Leavenworth
and
Fort
Riley
could
face
reductions
if
the
Army
is
forced
to
make
tough
decisions
to
the
increased
budget
constraints.
It
is
important
that
my
colleagues
in
the
Senate
support
this
amendment
and
understand
the
real
impact
on
defense
communities,
and
the
morale
of
the
families
and
soldiers
who
safeguard
our
freedom.
Those
who
call
Kansas
home
and
serve
in
the
Big
Red
One
at
Fort
Riley
and
the
Intellectual
Center
of
the
Army
at
Fort
Leavenworth
deserve
to
continue
their
careers
serving
in
the
Army
and
protecting
our
nation.
I
am
also
a
sponsor
of
an
amendment
offered
by
Senator
Mike
Lee
of
Utah
to
safeguard
the
use
of
military
training
ranges
from
the
potential
impact
of
listing
the
Lesser
Prairie
Chicken
under
the
Endangered
Species
Act
(ESA).
Its
listing
could
have
major
consequences
on
the
availability
and
use
of
training
ranges,
costs
of
managing
impacted
military
lands,
restrictions
of
the
use
of
certain
weapons
and
equipment
within
training
ranges,
and
prohibit
future
military
development
and
modernization.
Potentially
disrupting
activities
at
military
installations
located
in
the
Lesser
Prairie
Chicken
habitat
area
is
yet
another
example
of
the
uncertainty
and
havoc
caused
by
the
decision
to
list
the
bird
as
a
threatened
species.
I
will
continue
to
make
the
case
that
more
regulations
hindering
the
economy
from
the
federal
government
and
increased
intrusion
into
lives
and
businesses
of
stakeholders
is
not
the
answer
for
conserving
the
bird.
Welcome
back
to
Kansas,
Major
General
Grigsby
This
week
I
had
the
opportunity
to
meet
with
Major
General
Wayne
Grigsby,
the
incoming
Commanding
General
to
lead
the
1st
Infantry
Division
at
Fort
Riley.
Maj.
Gen.
Grigsby
will
assume
command
following
Maj.
Gen.
Funk,
who
is
currently
serving
in
Iraq.
Grigsby
is
returning
to
Kansas
after
numerous
deployments
overseas,
where
he
proved
to
be
an
effective
warrior
and
leader.
Prior
to
his
deployments
he
spent
time
at
Fort
Leavenworth
&#150;
first
while
attending
the
Command
and
General
Staff
College,
and
then
years
later
to
pursue
a
master&#146;s
degree
in
military
arts
and
sciences
through
the
Advanced
Military
Studies
Program.
I
am
pleased
to
welcome
Maj.
Gen.
Grigsby
and
his
family
back
to
Kansas
to
lead
the
Big
Red
One.
Announcing
Northrop
Grumman
New
Supplier
Symposium
As
U.S.
Senate
Aerospace
Caucus
Co-Chair,
it
was
a
pleasure
to
announce
that
Northrop
Grumman
Corporation,
the
Greater
Wichita
Economic
Development
Coalition
(GWEDC)
and
I
will
co-host
a
Northrop
Grumman
New
Supplier
Symposium
at
the
National
Center
for
Aviation
Training
(NCAT)
in
Wichita
on
July
2,
2015.
The
supplier
conference
will
help
facilitate
business
between
Kansas
companies
and
Northrop
Grumman,
and
will
enable
suppliers
to
meet
one-on-one
with
representatives
from
Northrop
Grumman.
Given
Kansas&#146;
reputation
as
the
national
leader
in
aviation
manufacturing
and
job
creation,
it&#146;s
no
wonder
global
aviation
manufacturers
like
Northrop
Grumman
are
eager
to
tap
into
the
talents
of
Kansans.
Wichita
is
the
&#145;Air
Capital
of
the
World&#146;
for
good
reason
&#150;
it
is
the
only
place
in
the
world
that
offers
90-years
of
experience
in
aviation
manufacturing,
access
to
the
world&#146;s
largest
supplier
base,
and
aircraft
workers
and
training
that
are
second
to
none.
Because
exports
are
so
vital
to
Kansas&#146;
economy
and
Kansas
jobs,
our
state
must
continue
to
build
quality
products
in
order
to
stay
competitive
in
the
global
marketplace.
I
am
proud
to
host
the
Northrop
Grumman
New
Supplier
Symposium,
which
will
help
make
certain
that
when
Northrop
Grumman
looks
for
new
U.S.
suppliers,
it
looks
to
Kansas
companies.
There
are
more
than
450
companies
in
Kansas&#146;
aerospace
industry,
accounting
for
more
than
32,000
direct
jobs.
Northrop
Grumman
makes
an
important
contribution
to
our
state&#146;s
economy,
as
it
currently
partners
with
more
than
180
Kansas
businesses.
Over
the
past
three
years,
the
company
has
committed
more
than
$132
million
with
suppliers
in
Kansas,
including
more
than
$30
million
in
2014.
In
addition,
Northrop
Grumman
employs
more
than
640
Kansans
at
facilities
in
Olathe
and
Fort
Leavenworth
(providing
training
programs
for
the
U.S.
Army,
Army
National
Guard
and
Department
of
State)
and
Topeka
(providing
depot
repair
for
the
U.S.
Postal
Service). Click

the
symposium.
Walmart
Distribution
Center
This
week,
I
toured
the
Walmart
Distribution
Center
in
Ottawa
to
learn
more
about
their
economic
impact
on
the
community.
The
facility
employs
more
than
800
individuals
making
it
Franklin
County&#146;s
largest
employer.
The
1.4
million
square
foot
distribution
center
and
warehouse
has
been
part
of
the
Ottawa
community
for
20
years
and
fills
orders
in
support
of
both
Walmart
super
stores
and
smaller
market
stores.
There
are
many
job
opportunities
for
Kansans
at
the
distribution
center,
and
Walmart
strongly
supports
hiring
our
nation&#146;s
veterans.
In
addition,
Walmart
initially
projected
hiring
100,000
veterans
by
2018
regardless
of
when
they
left
active
service.
However,
in
just
two
years,
they
have
already
hired
more
than
92,000
veterans
&#150;
many
within
their
first
12
months
off
active
service.
Walmart
is
now
projecting
to
hire
250,000
veterans
between
2013
and
2020.
I
commend
the
company&#146;s
commitment
to
employing
our
nation&#146;s
service
men
and
women.
Thanks
again
to
General
Manager
Tina
Albers
for
the
tour
and
to
Mayor
Mike
Skidmore,
Chamber
President
John
Coen,
and
Franklin
Co.
Development
Council
Executive
Director
Jeff
Seymour
for
joining
us.
Osawatomie
Rotary
Club
After
my
tour
of
the
Walmart
Distribution
Center
in
Ottawa
I
traveled
to
Osawatomie,
where
I
visited
with
members
of
the
Osawatomie
Rotary
Club
at
their
weekly
meeting.
We
discussed
a
number
of
important
local,
state
and
national
issues
including
the
need
for
banking
regulatory
reform
and
the
overreach
of
the
EPA
in
their
interpretation
of
the
&#147;waters
of
the
U.S.&#148;
We
also
discussed
concerns
about
the
Osawatomie
State
Hospital.
Thanks
to
Miami
County
Commissioner
George
Pretz
for
joining
us,
and
to
the
several
guests
of
School
Superintendent
Gary
French.
It
was
also
great
to
see
Tim
Long,
Mike
Moon,
and
the
other
Rotarians
who
were
there
to
meet
with
me.
Special
thanks
to
Ivy
Witt
Cole
for
her
welcome
and
introduction.
Visiting
Miami
County
Medical
Center
On
Monday,
I
was
in
Paola
to
visit
Miami
County
Medical
Center
(MCMC).
MCMC
is
a
39-bed
hospital
offering
a
wide
range
of
health
care
services
to
the
citizens
of
Paola
and
surrounding
communities
in
Miami
County.
Recently,
MCMC
was
recognized
by
the
Joint
Commission
&#150;
a
health
care
accrediting
organization
&#150;
as
a
top
performing
hospital
in
the
treatment
of
conditions
such
as
heart
attack,
heart
failure,
pneumonia
and
stroke.
The
hospital
is
also
designated
as
an
Emergent
Stroke
Ready
hospital
by
the
American
Heart
Association,
and
was
awarded
a
top
rating
by
the
Centers
for
Medicare
and
Medicaid
Services
(CMS)
for
patient
satisfaction.
When
I
visit
Kansas
hospitals
and
other
health
providers,
I
often
hear
concerns
about
the
burdens
Washington
policies
place
on
health
care
providers
as
they
work
to
provide
quality
care
for
their
patients.
My
discussion
with
MCMC
administrators
and
staff
covered
various
topics
including
unnecessarily
burdensome
and
flawed
Medicare
audit
regulations.
Many
Kansas
hospitals
have
been
forced
to
divert
significant
resources
away
from
caring
for
patients
to
appeal
incorrect
audit
decisions
that
are
ultimately
overturned
through
the
appeal
process.
This
broken
Medicare
audit
program
places
an
unreasonable
burden
on
providers,
and
has
created
a
two-year
appeals
backlog
within
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
(HHS).
I
raised
concerns
about
CMS
RAC
audits
in
a
meeting
with
HHS
Secretary
Sylvia
Burwell
following
her
appointment
last
year,
and
I
continue
to
dialogue
with
the
Department
on
this
issue.
Also,
I
included
language
in
the
Senate
Fiscal
Year
2015
Labor-HHS-Education
appropriations
bill
requiring
HHS
to
account
for
improving
the
Medicare
audit
appeals
process
and
addressing
the
current
backlog.
In
April,
I
submitted
questions
to
Secretary
Burwell
on
this
topic
in
conjunction
with
the
Senate
Appropriations
Health
Subcommittee&#146;s
hearing
on
HHS&#146;
Fiscal
Year
2016
budget
request.
I
will
continue
to
advocate
for
regulatory
flexibility
for
rural
hospitals
and
other
health
providers
to
deliver
the
care
that
is
essential
to
Kansas
communities.
Thanks
to
MCMC
Vice
President
of
Operations
Paul
Luce
for
hosting
my
visit,
and
to
Inpatient
Nursing
Manager
Aubree
Slayman
and
Rehab
Services
Manager
Ty
McBride
for
guiding
my
tour
of
the
hospital.
Thanks
also
to
Miami
County
Commissioner
Rob
Roberts
for
joining
me
on
the
tour.
Cuba
Trade
Act
of
2015
I
introduced
legislation
this
week
to
restore
trade
with
Cuba.
The
Cuba
Trade
Act
of
2015
(S.
1543)
would
grant
the
private
sector
the
freedom
to
export
U.S.
agricultural
commodities
and
other
goods
to
Cuba
while
protecting
U.S.
taxpayers
from
any
risk
or
exposure
associated
with
such
trade.
Cuba
is
only
90
miles
from
our
border,
making
it
a
natural
market
for
our
nation&#146;s
farmers
and
ranchers.
By
lifting
the
embargo
and
opening
up
the
market
for
U.S.
agricultural
commodities,
we
will
not
only
boost
the
U.S.
economy
but
also
help
bring
about
reforms
in
the
repressive
Cuban
government.
I
am
hopeful
that
increasing
the
standard
of
living
among
Cuban
citizens
will
enable
them
to
make
greater
demands
on
their
own
government
to
increase
individual
and
political
rights.
I
have
long
fought
for
commonsense
changes
to
U.S.
trade
policy
with
Cuba,
which
must
import
the
vast
majority
of
its
food.
In
July
2000,
an
amendment
I
offered
to
allow
food,
medicine
and
agriculture
products
to
be
sold
to
Cuba
overwhelmingly
passed
in
the
House.
This
bill
will
build
on
those
reforms
by
rolling
back
harmful
regulations
that
continued
to
hinder
trade
and
by
further
opening
Cuba&#146;s
market
to
our
commodities
and
products.
The
unilateral
embargo
that
has
been
in
place
for
more
than
five
decades
has
failed
to
effect
regime
change
or
lift
up
the
Cuban
people.
For
the
benefit
of
both
agriculture
producers
and
the
people
living
in
Cuba,
I
believe
it
is
finally
time
for
a
new
direction
in
our
Cuba
policies.

USDA
to
Implement
Crop
Insurance
Provision
for
Winter
Wheat
I
was
pleased
to
learn
this
week
that
USDA
will
implement
the
Actual
Production
History
(APH)
Yield
Exclusion
for
winter
wheat
planted
this
fall.
The
provision,
included
in
the
2014
Farm
Bill,
is
designed
to
provide
relief
for
farmers
suffering
from
multiple
years
of
severe
drought.
USDA
implemented
the
APH
Yield
Exclusion
for
crops
planted
this
spring,
but
did
not
have
it
ready
in
time
for
winter
wheat
producers.
Many
Kansas
farmers
have
seen
significant
decreases
in
their
insurable
yields
due
to
failed
or
very
low-yielding
crops
during
the
drought.
This
provision
will
ensure
crop
insurance
remains
a
viable
risk
management
tool
for
our
farmers
by
allowing
them
to
exclude
certain
low
yields
from
their
APH
due
to
severe
weather.
As
chairman
of
the
Senate
Agriculture
Appropriations
Subcommittee,
which
oversees
Farm
Bill
implementation
and
crop
insurance,
I
urged
Secretary
Vilsack
at
a
hearing
earlier
this
year
to
prioritize
implementing
this
provision
for
winter
wheat
producers.
It&#146;s
imperative
we
continue
to
strengthen
crop
insurance
to
protect
the
livelihoods
of
farmers
facing
the
devastation
of
damaged
or
destroyed
crops
due
to
severe
weather.
Reading
Post
Office
Ribbon
Cutting
I
joined
more
than
70
Lyon
County
area
residents
on
Friday
for
a
ribbon
cutting
ceremony
to
reopen
a
United
States
Post
Office
in
Reading.
It
has
been
more
than
four
years
since
a
devastating
tornado
destroyed
much
of
the
community,
including
the
building
where
the
post
office
was
located.
Since
that
time,
local
officials
and
residents
have
done
an
outstanding
job
of
rebuilding
their
community
&#151;
even
better
and
stronger
than
before.
There
are
a
number
of
individuals
who
deserve recognition
including
Jaret
Moyer;
Lyon
County
Commissioner
Scott
Briggs;
and
Mayor
Kevin
Sorensen
and
