David --
I&rsquo;m in this race for many reasons -- fighting for the people of Illinois comes first and foremost.
That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s incredibly inspiring to see so many supporters backing our campaign. In fact, we&rsquo;ve received over 786 donations just since yesterday. Thanks, David!
I want to keep fighting for Illinois --
and for you
-- but I can&rsquo;t get across the finish line without your help. Will you help us reach 1,000 strong? Whether you give $5 or $50, please make sure to get in your donation immediately.

Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks everyone!
Brad
P.S. We&rsquo;re only 89 days out from the Election. Don&rsquo;t wait until it&rsquo;s too late to make a difference.
