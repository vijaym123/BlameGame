David --
I need your help.
Barack needs your help.
And we need it TODAY because this is urgent:
House Republicans voted TODAY to advance their lawsuit against President Obama. It&rsquo;s their most brazen attempt to obstruct our agenda yet.
Together -- Barack, You, and I -- we&rsquo;ve already accomplished so much to expand health care, promote equal rights, and lift up the middle class. Now they&rsquo;re trying to bring that all crashing down. We still need 1,387 Democrats to step up and chip in today. If we don&rsquo;t hit this goal, Republicans win.
I have to ask you one more time: Can you step up right now? ALL GIFTS TODAY TRIPLE-MATCHED! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
Joe
