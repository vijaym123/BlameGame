Dear Friend,
Tune in to
WFTV Channel 9 tonight at 5:45 to watch me work with Vanessa Welch to
investigate deadbeats who live in public housing but fail to meet
community service requirements. The investigation found that, in Central
Florida and around the country, able bodied individuals living in
public housing have failed to comply with a law that requires them to
provide service to their communities in exchange for this benefit.

I look forward to
updating you again as our investigation proceeds and as the legislative
session continues.
As always, do not hesitate to contact my office
if you have any questions or concerns or if you need any
assistance.
With my regards and best wishes, I
remain
Sincerely,
John L.
Mica
Member of
Congress
