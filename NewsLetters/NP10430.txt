Dear
Friend,
This Easter weekend, I
reflected on how truly blessed I am to live in this great country, where
we enjoy so many freedoms. As my family and I celebrated the
resurrection of our Savior, Jesus Christ, I was reminded of the numerous
families worldwide who face religious persecution and are unable to freely
practice their faith.
Last week I traveled
to Guantanamo Bay with a congressional delegation. The sobering
experience reminded me that we are a blessed nation that has enjoyed great
protection--but it was also a reminder that there are some who seek to
destroy the freedoms we enjoy to worship as we
please.
Debbie and I extend our deepest gratitude to the men and
women who serve our nation in the armed forces for their dedication in
this great fight against evil.
May we
always be a country in whom God We Trust.
Happy
Easter to you and your family,
Congressman
Mark Meadows
