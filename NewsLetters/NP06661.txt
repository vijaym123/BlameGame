Friend,
Doug Ose is relying on shadowy outside groups to take us down. Just this morning we learned that yet ANOTHER shady special interest group has launched a smear campaign in our district. The US Chamber of Commerce is back -
they&#39;re running $250,000 worth of attacks in the next week alone.
We need your help, quickly. Click here and give $5 or more right now.
First Karl Rove, now this. Like my good friend Olga told you yesterday, we have our own ad to run - and unlike Doug Ose, we&#39;re relying on individual supporters to keep it on the air.
We need to hit $10,000 by our budgeting deadline next Tuesday.
Your support is absolutely vital to our success - please, click here and give, right now.
Let&#39;s fight together and beat the lies of these outside interests.
This is OUR district, not theirs.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
PS - The only way we&#39;ll win this election is with your continued support. Doug Ose has outsiders, and I have you. Let&#39;s show him that the grassroots matter. We need to hit $10,000 by next Tuesday in order to fight back - click here and give $5 or more to fight against the outsiders that are attacking us.
