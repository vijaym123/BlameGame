No One Is Above the
Law
There are a lot of
questions surrounding the recent trade the White House made,
exchanging
five Taliban leaders
who were being held in
Guantanoma Bay for American soldier, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.
Did he leave
the base willingly?
Many of the soldiers who served with Bergdahl
claim that he deserted his post in Afghanistan.
Will these freed
Taliban leaders be a danger to American soliders?
The White House
assures us they won't, but
I don't believe
they can
make that promise.
Were the actions of the White House legal?
This is a hotly disputed issue, as Republicans and Democrats in
Congress have both
questioned the legality
of the decision.
And most importantly,
has this action set a dangerous
precedent which our enemies will take advantage of in the
future?
These are serious
questions that deserve answers. The House committees that have
jurisdiction over this issue will investigate it thoroughly until we get some
solid answers and can take action to hold those involved accountable.
I'll keep you
updated.
Our Veterans Deserve the
Best
When it
comes to the care our veterans are receiving from Veterans Affairs, I'm
sure you'll agree that
'enough is enough' .
The House acted last month to make the VA more accountable and more
transparent. I know there are dedicated workers at the Veterans
Administration because I see them caring for our local veterans.
But
there are some bad apples, too,
who have been negligent and
derelict in their duty to protect
veterans.
To make sure these bad apples are
held accountable and removed without delay, we passed legislation
which allows the VA Secretary to circumvent
months of red
tape
and fix this unconscionable behavior of some workers who have
jeopardized the lives of veterans who served our nation. I'll keep you
updated on this.
Holding
Lerner in Contempt
Last month the House also voted to hold former IRS
official, Lois Lerner,
in contempt of Congress . The
action is based on her appearance at a congressional hearing where she
waived her Fifth Amendment right when she gave an opening statement before
the Oversight Committee in May of 2013,
refused further directives
to testify before Congress and ultimately failed to comply with a
Congressional
subpoena.
We had to take this step, otherwise Lois
Lerner will
never be held accountable for violating the civil
rights of Americans , and the American people may never learn
the full truth behind the government targeting citizens based on their
beliefs. If she has clean hands as she claims, there is no need to
hide the truth. The bottom line -
no government should try to
silence the voices of its citizens
merely because they disagree
with that government. Thats un-American and a dangerous new
power.
Benghazi: Getting
to the Truth
Americans deserve answers about Benghazi.
Those families who lost loved ones deserve answers. And those who lost
their lives that day in service to our nation, deserve justice. The
terrorists who are guilty of planning and carrying out these murders are
still free and perhaps planning more attacks against our nation, but
the
families are still grieving
and wondering when
the White House will hold true to its promise to bring these terrorists
to justice.
That's
why I voted last month to create a select committe focused on learning
the truth about the attack in Benghazi.
Every member of
Congress should be outraged
that key documents were deliberately
withheld from investigating committees and from the American
people. Every member of Congress should want to know the truth, and I
challenge those who oppose this committee to
look the victims
families in the eyes
and tell them that getting to the truth
doesnt matter.
