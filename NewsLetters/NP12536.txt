Dear David Johnson,
Diesel engines are dirty. There's no question about that. But
through a unique federal program we can reduce diesel emissions and the
damage caused to our environment and our health. Whether in freight
locomotives or school buses, upgrading these engines are a step toward
cleaner transportation.
After I was sworn in as your Congresswoman a year ago, I quickly
took notice of the Diesel Emission Reduction Act grant program, which
helps upgrade old and dirty diesel engines to newer and cleaner ones. I
was dismayed last year when the President requested only $6 million for
the program. I teamed up with my Congressional colleagues, and was able
to increase the funding to $20 million in legislation we passed earlier
this month.
To improve our community, New York State has an opportunity to
apply for these grants. Seven of my New York City and Long Island
colleagues and I have sent a letter urging the Department of
Transportation Commissioner to apply for these important grants. We
asked that the money go toward improving the locomotives that are owned
by the Long Island Railroad, and operated by New York & Atlantic
Railway. This would help improve the air quality for everyone who lives
near freight rail tracks in Queens, Brooklyn, Nassau and Suffolk.
Keeping our air breathable and reducing incidences of asthma are
common sense.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which administers these
grants, notes that, since 2008, it "has funded nearly 60,000 pieces of
clean diesel technology through the National Clean Diesel Campaign.
These technologies include emissions and idle control devices,
aerodynamic equipment, engine and vehicle replacements, and alternative
fuel options. The projects meet critical local air quality needs by
deploying both proven and emerging technologies much earlier than would
otherwise occur."
I'm hopeful that together we can work toward a cleaner
environment and reduce unnecessary pollution. As always, please don't
hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns.
Sincerely,
Grace Meng
Member of Congress

Dear
David Johnson,
Diesel
engines
are
dirty.
There&#8217;s
no
question
about
that.
But
through
a
unique
federal
program
we
can
reduce
diesel
emissions
and
the
damage
caused
to
our
environment
and
our
health.
Whether
in
freight
locomotives
or
school
buses,
upgrading
these
engines
are
a
step
toward
cleaner
transportation.
After
I
was
sworn
in
as
your
Congresswoman
a
year
ago,
I
quickly
took
notice
of
the
Diesel
Emission
Reduction
Act
grant
program,
which
helps
upgrade
old
and
dirty
diesel
engines
to
newer
and
cleaner
ones.
I
was
dismayed
last
year
when
the
President
requested
only
$6
million
for
the
program.
I
teamed
up
with
my
Congressional
colleagues,
and
was
able
to
increase
the
funding
to
$20
million
in
legislation
we
passed
earlier
this
month.
To
improve
our
community,
New
York
State
has
an
opportunity
to
apply
for
these
grants.
Seven
of
my
New
York
City
and
Long
Island
colleagues
and
I
have
sent
a
letter
urging
the
Department
of
Transportation
Commissioner
to
apply
for
these
important
grants.
We
asked
that
the
money
go
toward
improving
the
locomotives
that
are
owned
by
the
Long
Island
Railroad,
and
operated
by
New
York
&amp;
Atlantic
Railway.
This
would
help
improve
the
air
quality
for
everyone
who
lives
near
freight
rail
tracks
in
Queens,
Brooklyn,
Nassau
and
Suffolk.
Keeping
our
air
breathable
and
reducing

of
asthma
are
common

The
U.S.
Environmental
Protection
Agency,
which
administers
these
grants,
notes
that,
since
2008,
it
&#8220;has
funded
nearly
60,000
pieces
of
clean

through
the
National
Clean

These
technologies
include
emissions

aerodynamic

engine
and
vehicle
replacements,
and
alternative
fuel
options.
The
projects
meet
critical
local
air
quality
needs
by
deploying
both
proven
and
emerging
technologies
much
earlier
than
would
otherwise
occur.&#8221;
I&#8217;m
hopeful
that
together
we
can
work
toward
a
cleaner
environment
and
reduce
unnecessary
pollution.
As
always,
please
don&#8217;t
hesitate
to
contact
my
office
if
you
have
any
questions
or
concerns.
