Friend,
The primary is one week away. One. Week. Away. Even typing it out gives me an adrenaline rush.
We&#39;re all a bit on edge - but here&#39;s what&#39;s keeping me sane. We just got word of some local donors who are so frustrated with the outside money pouring into our race, they&#39;ve pledged to match all donations dollar for dollar between now and the primary - up to $10,000 dollars.
Here&#39;s the deal with the primary donations - after the primary on
June 3rd , we lose the ability to raise into our primary account.
That means that the amount we can raise from each individual is cut in half.
BUT - whatever money we DO raise into the primary account, we can use for the duration of the election. All that to say -
the time for &quot;I&#39;ll give later&quot; has passed - we need your help, and we need it now.
These local donors understand the sense of urgency - that&#39;s why they&#39;ve agreed to match all donations up to $10,000 dollars.
Can you give $5 and double your impact? If you help us reach our $10,000 goal by
midnight on June 3rd, you will have helped us raise $20,000
- click here now.
Thank you for taking action.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
PS - Full disclosure - you&#39;re going to be hearing from our team a lot between now and the primary.
But it&#39;s because this is serious - after
June 3rd , we lose half our ability to fundraise.
Plus, with the dollar for dollar match, this is the perfect time to get involved.
