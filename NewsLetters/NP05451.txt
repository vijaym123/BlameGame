Friend -- President Obama emailed you.
Elizabeth Warren emailed you.
Every Democrat under the sun has emailed you because it&rsquo;s the single most critical day of the entire election -- the FINAL FEC deadline is in 10 hours.
A poll shows &ldquo;Democrat Michelle Nunn -- for the first time -- opening up a small lead,&rdquo; 48 - 45, in ruby red Georgia!
We could win FIVE Southern states total -- that would END McConnell&rsquo;s Senate takeover chances!
NBC News
reports, &ldquo;Democrats could be in store for a better-than-expected Election Night&hellip; a stronger turnout could benefit their candidates.&rdquo; But as of today, this election is TIED.
We only have 20 days left &ndash; an alarmingly short amount of time -- but we can TAKE THIS ELECTION AWAY from the GOP.
But tonight is our LAST chance to fund the Get Out The Vote Campaign that will be crucial to our win.
Pitch in before the final FEC deadline in 10 hours and we&rsquo;ll get our GOTV folks out in the field immediately. Triple-match ends at midnight!
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;

Or donate another amount.
If we don&rsquo;t raise another $150,000 by midnight, we&rsquo;re seriously worried that we&rsquo;ll lose this at the last second. But if you pitch in now, we&rsquo;ll go on the ATTACK -- and hand them an electoral disaster on Election Night.
Remember: Your gift will be triple-matched until midnight because this is the most important day of the election.
