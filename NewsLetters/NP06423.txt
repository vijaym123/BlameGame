More Obstruction from the Obama
Administration
9/10/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn took U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe to task for his
department's obstruction and hampering of lawful information requests from the
House Natural Resources
Committee.
"Obama Administration bureaucrats give more information to
the press than they give to a Congressional Committee that has served
them with a lawful subpoena. It is the constitutional duty of
Congressional committees to oversee executive branch agencies, and for the
agencies to be accountable and transparent. The time for obstruction and
endless runarounds is over. Officials from these and other agencies
need to be fired if they feel that they can willfully ignore subpoenas
from the people's Representatives in
Congress."

Examples of
Document Redaction
Background information from the House Natural
Resources Committee
The hearing specifically examined examples of this stonewalling from the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
The Service has failed to comply with two subpoenas for
documents.
One related to the Whitebluffs Bladderpod, the second on the
Administrations approach for enforcing wildlife laws, including the
Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection
Act.
Despite the issuance of
subpoenas, the Department continues to withhold and redact
documents.
Even worse, the Department is going out of its way to provide even
less information to Congress than it is to
others.
Here are three distinct
examples:
In December 2013, the Service provided
the Committee copies of about 1,000 pages of documents. These were
exact duplicates of what the Service had already provided to the
Associated Press under the Freedom of Information Act.
Some of these
documents were redacted while others were released in full to both the
AP and the Committee.
In March of this
year, the Committee issued a subpoena seeking 55 specific unredacted
documents and categories of other documents. In response, the Service
issued another large document production.
It included the same
January 2013 email.
Except this time it was redacted in several
places, even though an unredacted version had already been provided to
the news media and the Committee almost six months
earlier.
Either the Administration is incompetent or it is going
out of its way to expend time and money to withhold information from
Congress.
In a third example, a
document was released to a bird conservation group under FOIA.
Only
the bottom part was redacted.
When the Service provided the same
document to the Committee in June
almost the entire document was
redacted.
In addition, the Service
has released documents to this same bird group last year under FOIA
that have NEVER been provided to the Committee
even though it was
specifically covered in the parameters of the
subpoena.
