Perry
September 1, 2014
Each year, we set aside the first Monday of September to commemorate Labor Day
a day to celebrate the achievements of our Nation's workers
whose sweat, toil, and ingenuity as individual Americans have insured the success of our great country.
Workers are the heart and soul of America. But today we still see far too many Americans seeking meaningful, full-time employment. I regularly hear how many employers have job openings, yet they cant find workers with the skills that match the needs of their openings.

This is why we need to streamline job training programs to help workers get the skills they need for a brighter future. Its also why we need to encourage companies to stay or relocate to America with economic policies that make sense. Looking ahead, well continue to see a very competitive global economy and a landscape transformed by technology. But America's working men and women are up to the challenge.
Please enjoy a safe and great Labor Day weekend.
Sincerely,
Scott G. Perry
