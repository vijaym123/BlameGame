It&rsquo;s been only eight weeks since Brad announced he&rsquo;s running to take back Illinois&rsquo;s 10th district for Democrats. And since then, we&rsquo;ve seen a PHENOMENAL outpouring of grassroots support!!
So far, 3,776 people have stood up to become online Founding Members of Brad&rsquo;s progressive campaign. THAT'S FANTASTIC NEWS!
BUT -- we know our race is going to go down to the wire. To stay on track, it&rsquo;s absolutely crucial we reach 4,000 strong before our May 31st deadline.
