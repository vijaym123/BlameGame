BREAKING: Obamacare-Killing Budget Passes in House
David -- The bad news keeps rolling in:
Boehner&rsquo;s mega-fundraiser raked in $17.5 MILLION in one single night. That&rsquo;s an eye-popping number. How did Boehner re-pay his millionaire donors?
Last night, House Republicans passed a budget that hands the wealthy MASSIVE tax breaks. And to pay for it, Medicare and Obamacare are destroyed.
Frankly, if we can&rsquo;t respond to the Republicans&rsquo; wave of corporate cash, they could actually pass their agenda. You can&rsquo;t let that happen.
Suggested Action for David Johnson
Donate $5 to stop the Republicans' budget
Before the Senate votes TONIGHT on this disgusting budget, we need 5,000 more strong Democrats to fight back. Can we count on you?
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
