Team Bera,
Well, there you have it.
The differences between my opponent and I could not be more clear. I'm focused on standing up to Wall Street and fighting for the middle class - Doug Ose struggled to name even three votes he's taken against Wall Street interests. I'm for comprehensive immigration reform - Doug Ose is against it. And what's most shocking - he actually stands by his ill-advised vote to take us into the Iraq war, and is an advocate for putting more boots on the ground in the Middle East.
We CANNOT let someone who is this misguided and indecisive represent our district.But if we aren't able to respond to the MASSIVE amounts of outside spending we're facing, Doug Ose WILL be representing us as a Member of Congress.Click here and give, right now, to ensure that doesn't happen. secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/aclearcontrast

Friend,
Wanted to make sure you saw Ami&#39;s email from last night. We were all so proud of his performance in the debate -
but also terrified at the notion of Doug Ose replacing him in Congress.
After what we saw last night, it&#39;s clear that we CANNOT let that happen.
Please click here and give $5 or more, right now, so that Ose doesn&#39;t drown out the truth with his money.
If you&#39;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Keep Doug Ose out of Congress: $10
Keep Doug Ose out of Congress: $25
Keep Doug Ose out of Congress: $50

Keep Doug Ose out of Congress: $2600
Or donate another amount.
Thanks,
Team Bera
PS - We need to keep moving forward, and it&#39;s clear that Ose&#39;s policies would set us back. But if we don&#39;t respond to the $7 million worth of ad buys against us, Ose WILL bring his policies to Congress.
Click here and give $5 or more right now.
