Senate Playing Politics with Volunteer Firefighters
Visiting Union Fire Company No.1 on my Carlisle Main Street Tour.
On March 11, 2014, the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed
legislation I authored to protect volunteer firefighters and emergency
responders from the unintended consequences of the Affordable Care Act
(ACA), also known as Obamacare.
H.R. 3979, the Protecting Volunteer
Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act, ensures that emergency
services volunteers are not counted as full-time employees under the
Employer Mandate of the ACA, thereby shielding fire departments from
crippling new health care costs, which would cause many to close their
doors.
The bill passed the House by a vote of 410 to 0, marking a
tremendous victory for both the volunteers and anyone who lives and
works in an area that depends on volunteer firefighters and emergency
first responders for their safety.
However, on April 7, 2014 the Senate passed legislation to extend
emergency unemployment compensation benefits by attaching such language
to my bill.
I am extremely disappointed in the Senate's passage of
H.R. 3979, originally my Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and
Emergency Responders Act.
Since this unemployment compensation extension package is extremely
controversial, it is unlikely to see a vote on the House floor.
Therefore, this effort could effectively kill the Protecting Volunteer
Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act, ensuring volunteer
firefighters and emergency responders across the country will not have
legislative protection from the Affordable Care Act's Employer Mandate
Provision.
This is nothing but a political stunt by Harry Reid.
He is playing
politics at the expense of the brave men and women who protect our
communities each and every day.
I find it deplorable that the Senate
finds it acceptable to use volunteer firefighters and emergency
responders as pawns in their political game; thereby, jeopardizing the
public safety of our communities.
Attaching any language to my
legislation, unemployment compensation or not, is just plain wrong.
I
will continue to support full passage of my bill and its original,
bipartisan intent.
From Washington...
REINING IN EXECUTIVE OVERREACH
During the second week of March, I voted for passage of two bills
designed to rein in executive overreach and promote transparency and
honesty among government officials expected to obey laws passed by
Congress.
The ENFORCE the Law Act (H.R. 4138) creates a procedure
under which the House or Senate may authorize a lawsuit against the
Executive Branch for failure to faithfully execute laws.
The Faithful
Execution of the Law Act (H.R. 3973) requires federal officials who
implement policies to explain to Congress why they have chosen not to
enforce particular laws.
Both bills passed the House.
The Constitution is pretty clear on some basic points, namely, Congress
passes laws and the Executive Branch enforces them.
It's disappointing
we have to actually pass legislation to remind people of these
responsibilities - which should be obvious.
PROTECTING HARDWORKING AMERICANS AND JOB CREATORS
On April 3, 2014, the House passed the Save American Workers Act of
2014 (H.R. 2575), which I cosponsored, by a bipartisan vote of 248-179.
This legislation changes a provision of the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act's (PPACA) Employer Mandate that defines a full-time
employee as someone who works 30 hours per week, to an employee who
works 40 hours per week.
Under the president's health care law,
employers with more than 50 full-time employees are required to offer
health care coverage or be subject to a substantially high tax penalty
per employee.
H.R. 2575 is a critical step in helping to protect our nation's
employees and employers from a potentially devastating redefinition of
workforce status.
For over 40 years, America's workforce has used the
traditional 40 hour work week to define full-time employees, and I
firmly believe that if it's not broken, don't fix it.
The 30 hour definition would force businesses to choose between
reducing growth and employee hours or going bankrupt from substantial
penalties, resulting in less business expansion and more part-time
workers.
With already 7.2 million Americans working part-time, we
should not be adding to this number.
Even more alarming is the fact that 2.6 million Americans are at risk
of having their wages cut by 25 percent.
This means that someone who
currently earns $10 an hour and works 40 hours a week will lose $110
each and every week.
That's over $5,000 less per year for many people
who are already living paycheck to paycheck.

Homeland Security Committee Hearing
On March 13, I had the opportunity to question Department of Homeland
Security Secretary Jeh Johnson as to why the federal government is not
doing its job in enforcing immigration laws, resulting in local
governments footing the bill to house illegal immigrants in local
jails.
I also criticized President Obama's proposed budget, which
would eliminate funding for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program
(SCAAP), which is designed to offset some of the costs of incarcerating
illegal immigrants locally.

I was honored to receive the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's annual Spirit
of Enterprise Award which is given to members of Congress based on
their votes on critical business legislation.

Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management
Subcommittee Hearing
On April 3, I held a hearing in my subcommittee on disaster mitigation
to reduce costs and save lives. While my subcommittee does not have
jurisdiction over flood insurance policies and premiums, there are real
practical steps communities and individuals can take to protect their
homes and families from floods, while also reducing their costs and
insurance premiums.

MAIN STREET TOURS:
On March 18, I had the pleasure of visiting Elizabethville and getting
to know many of the local residents and business owners.
After a
fantastic lunch at The Special Place Restaurant, I stopped by several
local establishments including the Elizabethville Fire Department and
Swab Wagon.
Just a few days later, I traveled to Plymouth.
After a filling lunch
at Alpine Deli, I visited Goodwill Hose Co. #2, Today's Treasures
Antiques, and Bednarski Furniture to hear more about the concerns of
local residents.
On April 11, I toured Carlisle area businesses and spoke to owners and
residents about many economic issues.
I was honored to begin my day
with the Carlisle Chamber of Commerce breakfast, followed by a great
lunch at North Hanover Grille and visits to Union Fire Company No. 1,
The Greatest Gift, Market Cross Pub, Sadler Health Center, and Carlisle
Bakery.
The following week, I spent the day in Danville and met with the
hardworking citizens who live and work in this town.
My morning
started at Geisinger Medical Center, followed by a delicious lunch at
the Pine Barn Inn, and stops at several places including Friendship
Fire Co. #1, Chef Willies Creamery, Eclectic Envy, and Beiters.
I believe we need to do everything possible in Washington to cut red
tape and ensure small business owners are given the tools they need to
drive their local economies and create jobs for Pennsylvanians across
the 11th Congressional District.
I will continue to fight to ensure
the prosperity of towns like these in our district.

New Outreach Schedule
I am pleased to unveil a new outreach schedule that will take effect
immediately and remain in effect throughout 2014. The new schedule is
designed to better serve constituents across Pennsylvania's 11th
District, which is comprised of nine counties, spanning from Wyoming
County to Cumberland County.
Staff members at each location will be
available to aid constituents with federal casework and legislative
concerns.
To view the new schedule, click here.
Legislative Update
COSPONSORED LEGISLATION:
*	Drug Free Commercial Driver Act (H.R. 3403), which proposes the
Department of Transportation recognize hair testing as a valid drug
test.
*	Personal Health Investment Today (PHIT) Act (H.R. 956), which
would allow for a health care tax deduction for up to $1,000 ($2,000
for families) of qualified sports and fitness expenses, such as gym
memberships, physical exercise programs, and exercise equipment.
*	H.Res. 231, which would establish a House Select Committee on
POW and MIA Affairs to conduct a full investigation into unresolved
matters relating to any U.S. personnel unaccounted for from the Vietnam
era, the Korean conflict, World War II, Cold War Missions, Persian Gulf
War, Operation Iraqi Freedom, or Operation Enduring Freedom, including
MIAs and POWs missing and captured.
*	Transparent Airfares Act of 2014 (H.R. 4156), which would
return transparency to U.S. airfare advertising by allowing
advertisements for passenger air travel to state the base airfare and
separately disclose any government imposed taxes and fees and the total
cost of travel.
This bill ensures that airfare advertisements are not
forced to hide the costs of government fees from consumers.
*	H.J.RES.50, which would add a parental rights amendment to the
Constitution stating that the liberty of parents to direct the
upbringing, education, and care of their children is a fundamental
right.
*	Military Surviving Spouses Equity Act (H.R. 32), which would
repeal certain provisions which require the offset of amounts paid in
dependency and indemnity compensation from the Survivor Benefit
Program. This change would affect the annuities for the surviving
spouses of former military personnel who are entitled to military
retired pay.
LETTERS SENT TO:
*	Department of the Army Secretary John McHugh and Environmental
Protection Agency Administrator (EPA) Gina McCarthy regarding the EPA's
dramatic expansion of federal regulations of water, also referred to as
the navigable waters rule.
*	Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator
Tavenner requesting that CMS refrain from further action regarding the
Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies
(DMEPOS) Competitive Bidding Program until the findings of the Health
and Human Services Office of Inspector General investigation into the
program is completed.
*	Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Tom Wheeler
urging the FCC to postpone a rule change concerning how joint service
agreements (JSAs) are used to calculate television station ownership.
*	Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel urging the Department of
Defense (DOD) to fully obligate the funding already appropriated by
Congress for Fiscal Year 2014 and continue to support the Warfighter
Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T) program and the Handheld Manpack
Small Form Factor Radio (HMS).
*	Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack and U.S.
Trade Representative (USTR) Michael Froman urging the USDA and USTR to
place a high priority on removing the various tariff and nontariff
barriers that our dairy industry confronts when shipping to the
European Union.
IMPORTANT VOTE: PASSAGE OF THE HOUSE FISCAL YEAR 2015 BUDGET
On April 10, I supported and the House passed the fiscal year 2015
(FY15) House budget resolution.
This legislation, authored by House
Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, sets appropriations levels for
FY15, and then lays out a "framework" for FY16 through FY24.
Chairman Ryan's budget proposal responsibly reduces our nation's debt,
which is 17 trillion dollars and growing; simplifies our nation's tax
code; repeals the president's misguided and unworkable health care law;
ensures our men and women in uniform have the support they need; and
balances our nation's budget.
Importantly, the budget recognizes that
we must reform our nation's important entitlement programs to ensure
that they are around for current and future beneficiaries like our
children and grandchildren.
Like the bipartisan Ryan Murray budget agreement, I do not agree with
everything included in this budget framework, and I will work to
improve any future legislation that may be considered as a result of
its adoption.

PROTECTING
HARDWORKING
AMERICANS
AND
JOB
CREATORS
On
April
3,
2014,
the
House
passed
the
Save
American
Workers
Act
of
2014
(H.R.
2575),
which
I
cosponsored,
by
a
bipartisan
vote
of
248-179.
This
legislation
changes
a
provision
of
the
Patient
Protection
and
Affordable
Care
Act&#8217;s
(PPACA)
Employer
Mandate
that
defines
a
full-time
employee
as
someone
who
works
30
hours
per
week,
to
an
employee
who
works
40
hours
per
week.
Under
the
president&#8217;s
health
care
law,
employers
with
more
than
50
full-time
employees
are
required
to
offer
health
care
coverage
or
be
subject
to
a
substantially
high
tax
penalty
per
employee.
H.R.
2575
is
a
critical
step
in
helping
to
protect
our
nation&#8217;s
employees
and
employers
from
a
potentially
devastating
redefinition
of
workforce
status.
For
over
40
years,
America&#8217;s
workforce
has
used
the
traditional
40
hour
work
week
to
define
full-time
employees,
and
I
firmly
believe
that
if
it&#8217;s
not
broken,
don&#8217;t
fix
it.
The
30
hour
definition
would
force
businesses
to
choose
between
reducing
growth
and
employee
hours
or
going
bankrupt
from
substantial
penalties,
resulting
in
less
business
expansion
and
more
part-time
workers.
With
already
7.2
million
Americans
working
part-time,
we
should
not
be
adding
to
this
number.
Even
more
alarming
is
the
fact
that
2.6
million
Americans
are
at
risk
of
having
their
wages
cut
by
25
percent.
This
means
that
someone
who
currently
earns
$10
an
hour
and
works
40
hours
a
week
will
lose
$110
each
and
every
week.
That&#8217;s
over
$5,000
less
per
year
for
many
people
who
are
already
living
paycheck
to
paycheck.

IMPORTANT
VOTE:
PASSAGE
OF
THE
HOUSE
FISCAL
YEAR
2015
BUDGET
On
April
10,
I
supported
and
the
House
passed
the
fiscal
year
2015
(FY15)
House
budget
resolution.
This
legislation,
authored
by
House
Budget
Committee
Chairman
Paul
Ryan,
sets
appropriations
levels
for
FY15,
and
then
lays
out
a
&#8220;framework&#8221;
for
FY16
through
FY24.
Chairman
Ryan&#8217;s
budget
proposal
responsibly
reduces
our
nation&#8217;s
debt,
which
is
17
trillion
dollars
and
growing;
simplifies
our
nation&#8217;s
tax
code;
repeals
the
president&#8217;s
misguided
and
unworkable
health
care
law;
ensures
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
have
the
support
they
need;
and
balances
our
nation&#8217;s
budget.
Importantly,
the
budget
recognizes
that
we
must
reform
our
nation&#8217;s
important
entitlement
programs
to
ensure
that
they
are
around
for
current
and
future
beneficiaries
like
our
children
and
grandchildren.
Like
the
bipartisan
Ryan
Murray
budget
agreement,
I
do
not
agree
with
everything
included
in
this
budget
framework,
and
I
will
work
to
improve
any
future
legislation
that
may
be
considered
as
a
result
of
its
adoption. How
