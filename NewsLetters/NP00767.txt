David -- we CANNOT keep up!!
Since we told you how close we are to 1,OOO online donations in May, SO MANY of you stepped up! We can hardly take our eyes off of ActBlue!
We weren&rsquo;t sure we&rsquo;d do it...but now we have a chance at reaching our goal before TONIGHT&rsquo;S critical budget deadline.
David, this is when we need you most. Can you chip in $5 or more to help put us over the top?
