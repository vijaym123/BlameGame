Dear Fellow Coloradan,
President John F. Kennedy famously said that when the rights of one are threatened, the rights of all are diminished. Fifty years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 &mdash; our nation&rsquo;s landmark legislation outlawing discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin &mdash; these words continue to ring true.
The Civil Rights Act was a victory for all Americans &mdash; one that would not have been possible without the resolve of leaders who devoted their lives to end discrimination and promote equal opportunity for all. During a time of deeply rooted segregation and discrimination, this landmark legislation helped pave the way for a better America. The Civil Rights Act led to other steps toward protecting the rights and freedoms for all Americans, including the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

While we&rsquo;ve made tremendous progress over the past 50 years to ensure equality in America, our work to fight oppression is far from finished. We still have a lot more to do to expand access to opportunity, to ensure a fair and livable wage, and to protect Americans&rsquo; basic right to vote. The U.S. Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision to roll back the Voting Rights Act&rsquo;s ability to protect voters from discriminatory laws is a setback I will continue working to address with my colleagues in the Senate, as well as community leaders and voting rights advocates. It&rsquo;s a foundational premise: We must safeguard the voting rights of all Americans.
There will always be new challenges for our nation and obstacles to overcome, but our Colorado values of equality and freedom will always prevail. As we mark the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, I hope you&rsquo;ll join me in redoubling our efforts to ensure that all Coloradans are treated equally regardless of their race, creed or sexual orientation. We all have a role to play in building a more perfect union.
Warm regards,
Offices
