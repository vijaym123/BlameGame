Dear Friend -
You cannot go far in Washington, D.C. without being reminded of our
nation's history, those who came before us, and the men and women who
made great sacrifices for our country. I recently visited the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial on the National Mall to pay my respects to the more
than 58,000 Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice while wearing the
uniform in that conflict and to film a brief video about what Memorial
Day means to me.
I hope you will take a few moments to watch this short video
by clicking the image below.
Memorial Day is widely considered to mark the beginning of summer.
School is getting out, the weather is getting warmer, and the Las Vegas
Valley springs to life with various activities. Memorial Day itself is
packed with parades, barbecues, little league games, and trips out to
Lake Mead or up Mount Charleston. But we must never lose sight of the
true meaning of Memorial Day.
I hope tomorrow, before you head out to enjoy the day, you fly your
flag and take a few moments to honor those who laid down their lives in
the defense of our nation and freedom itself. Teach your children why
it is they have off from school on Monday and if you see a man or woman
in uniform, take a moment to extend a hand and offer a word of thanks
to those who are prepared to, if necessary, give their lives so our way
of life can continue.
Never Forget.
Sincerely,
DR. JOE HECK
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend
-
You
cannot
go
far
in
Washington,
D.C.
without
being
reminded
of
our
nation's
history,
those
who
came
before
us,
and
the
men
and
women
who
made
great
sacrifices
for
our
country.
I
recently

the
Vietnam
Veterans

on
the
National

my

to
the
more

I

you

Memorial
Day
is
widely
considered
to
mark
the
beginning
of
summer.
School
is
getting
out,
the
weather
is
getting
warmer,
and
the
Las

springs
to
life
with
various
activities.
Memorial

But
we
must
never
lose

of
the
true
meaning
of
Memorial
Day.
I
hope
tomorrow,
before

head
out
to

the

you

and
take
a
few

to
honor
those

T each
your

why
it
is
they
have
off
from
school
on
Monday
and
if
you
see
a
man
or
