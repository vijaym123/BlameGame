Victory for Religious
Liberty
6/30/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn released the following statement after the
Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood
Specialties, holding that closely held corporations still have a right to
religious freedom and to act accordingly to their
conscience.
Todays Supreme Court Ruling
was a victory for religious liberty and yet another rebuke for an
administration that has shown continuous disregard for our
Constitutional protections in its efforts to impose a radical liberal
agenda. The Obamacare mandate that was overturned would have forced
for-profit businesses into a terrible dilemma, choosing between violating
their deeply held religious beliefs or paying crippling fines that would
have put the future of their businesses into serious jeopardy."
Freedom of religion
is one of the foundational pillars of Americas greatness. Every
American, including those who create jobs and employ citizens, should be
free to live and work according to the principles of their faith.
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
(CO-05)
Congressman Lamborn
signed an
amicus brief
urging the Supreme
Court to strike down the HHS Mandate that required employers to subsidize
coverage of potentially life-terminating drugs and devices.
Congressman Lamborn is also a cosponsor of the Health Care Conscience
Rights Act, a bill that includes protections regarding insurance coverage
and protects health care providers who refuse to provide or refer for
abortion services in violation of their consciences.
