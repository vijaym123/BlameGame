Supporting America's Job
Creators
6/12/14
Today in Congress, the focus was on American jobs. Congressman
Doug Lamborn chaired a hearing of his Energy and Mineral Resources
Subcommittee on jobs and innovations in the American energy sector.
"Our
country has always been a nation of innovators
pushing the limits of
technology to effect positive change both at home and abroad.
In
the energy sector in particular, innovation is the life blood of
progress.
The science and engineering behind these operations is
astounding and so are the innovators
forging new frontiers of American
engineering. One of the most intriguing innovations in energy
development is a new almost waterless hydraulic fracturing technique developed
by ATK that would revolutionize enhanced oil and gas development in
Colorado."

Also in the House today,
Congressman Lamborn voted for H.R. 4457, the American Small Business Tax
Relief Act and H.R. 4453, the S Corporation Permanent Tax Relief
Act.
In
this uncertain economy, H.R. 4457 makes it easier for businesses to
comply with the American tax code. This bipartisan legislation allows
businesses to immediately deduct the cost of purchasing new equipment or
property and the bill makes this change
permanent.
H.R. 4453 allows S
Corporations, including many of the small businesses across America, an
easier path to accessing capital without tax penalties. These important
and permanent changes will allow small businesses to hire more people
and make more investments in themselves and their
communities.
"The
government must always take every opportunity to make economic and
financial rules and regulations easier and more practical for American
businesses. When businesses prosper, the whole nation prospers. When more of
our friends and neighbors are working and experiencing the benefits
that come with the dignity of working, our broader economy becomes
stronger and healthier. Supporting H.R 4457 and 4453 is just the latest
example of my long record of supporting tax relief for Americans."
