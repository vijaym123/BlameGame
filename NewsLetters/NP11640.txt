Dear
Friends,
Motivated by her
courageous aid relief work on
the front lines of Civil War
battlefields, Clara Barton
founded the American Red
Cross in 1881. This March, we
honor this remarkable
organization that has been an
integral part of our history
and community for over 100
years.
The American Red Cross is
dedicated to providing
humanitarian aid in the form
of disaster relief, support
for Americas military
families, lifesaving blood
donations, and health and
safety training for the
public. Additionally,
the American Red Cross is
part of the larger
International Red Cross
network of over 13 million
volunteers in 187 countries
around the world. The
Committee on Homeland
Security and Governmental
Affairs, which I chair, as
well as the Department of
Homeland Security, are
important government partners
in the American Red
Cross efforts to
prepare for and respond to
disasters of all kinds.
Here in Delaware, we know
firsthand the damage a
natural disaster can do to
families and
communities. When
Superstorm Sandy hit our
shores in October 2012,
Delawareans from all walks of
life pulled together to
volunteer for the American
Red Cross relief
efforts in our state, from
handing out meals to staffing
shelters. It is this
sense of hope, compassion,
and resilience that embodies
the spirit of the American
Red Cross and all its
dedicated volunteers.
This March, I encourage you
to show your appreciation for
the American Red Cross and to
explore the ways in which you
can get involved in its
humanitarian relief
efforts.
As always, I look forward
to hearing from you on this
topic, or any other,
through
email
or by contacting me
