Finally Honoring a Fallen Hero
69 years ago, Cleveland County native Franklin Hugh Peeler lost his life while fighting with the United States Army to liberate Europe during World War II.
This past Friday, I had the distinct privilege of presenting Franklin's brother Charles with the medals his brother earned while defending our freedom.
While 69 years late, I was truly honored to present these medals to Charles and his family.

Recognizing NC-10's Blue Ribbon School
Earlier this year, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan named Kings Mountain's West Elementary School a 2014 Blue Ribbon School.
One of only five public schools in North Carolina to be recognized as a Blue Ribbon School, West Elementary earned this honor for the high learning standards achieved by their students.
On Monday of this week,
I visited West and spoke during a ceremony
celebrating this tremendous achievement.
During the ceremony, I also presented West Elementary with a flag that had recently been flown above the United States Capitol to recognize their great accomplishment.
Below is a photo of me presenting the certificate accompanying the flag to West Principal Heather Pagan.

Happy 96th Reverend Graham!
This past Friday also marked the
96th birthday
of one of Western North Carolina's finest sons, the Reverend Billy Graham.
Reverend Graham has devoted his life to traveling the world to spread the Gospel of our lord and savior Jesus Christ.
A Montreat resident, I had the honor of meeting with Reverend Graham just a couple years ago and although he is older, his mind is still sharp as can be.
It was a truly wonderful experience to sit with Reverend Graham and receive his counsel.
