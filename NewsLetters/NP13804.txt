Dear Friend,
I hope you had a good first week of the Christmas season. I was busy in
Washington fighting for you. The House took up and passed a bill that
will help provide some comfort to members of our military and their
families who are spending time in airports. The TSA Loose Change Act,
H.R. 1095, which I co-sponsored, would require the Transportation
Security Administration (TSA) to turn over all loose change collected
from airport checkpoints and airport facilities to fund lounges for
members of the military and their families.
Under current law, money collected from security checkpoints is spent
on civilian aviation security. That loose change, according to the
House Homeland Security Committee, adds up to an average of $465,000
per year. As things currently stand, airport lounges for members of the
military and their families are operated only by the United Services
Organizations (USO). Our bill will have the TSA use loose change to
have additional groups provide these lounges for our service members.
Members of our military and their loved ones deserve a place to spend a
few minutes of precious family time. This loose change, small though it
may be, adds up, and can provide our men and women in uniform with a
rest zone they have earned. I urge the Senate to quickly take up this
legislation and pass it.
This week I also attended a classified briefing on the Iran "deal" with
Ambassador Wendy Sherman, Under Secretary of Political Affairs at the
State Department. I am highly concerned that this "deal" is no deal at
all, but allows Iran to continue enriching uranium while loosening
sanctions. Additionally, the deal does not address Iran's imprisonment
of American pastor Saeed Abedini. I strongly believe that any deal with
Iran must demand the immediate release of Pastor Abedini and other
Americans being held in Iranian prisons because of their religious
beliefs. I remain undeterred in my opposition to this deal and the
Administration's call to not pass more sanctions. I cosponsored H.R.
850, the Nuclear Iran Prevention Act of 2013. This bill passed the
House this July in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote. This week, I
signed on to a letter urging the Senate to take action on this vital
piece of legislation. It is my hope that the Senate will take action,
and we can force Iran to the table and craft a true deal that frees
Pastor Abedini and prevents a nuclear Iran.
Another bill passed by the House this week addresses some of the
excessive and unnecessary regulations that hurt our economy, increase
costs, and restrict access to private sector capital needed by job
creators in their effort to hire American workers and grow the economy.
The Small Business Capital Access and Job Preservation Act, H.R. 1105,
changes a regulatory burden imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, requiring
advisers to private equity funds, which are private projects supported
by private investors with no government funds, with more than $150
million under management to register with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC). These new registration requirements have forced
advisers to private equity to undergo a process that costs millions of
dollars in initial and annual compliance costs, imposing an undue
burden on small and mid-sized private equity firms. Our fix to this
problem exempts many of these advisers from registration requirements -
allowing them to spend less time on red tape and more time and effort
investing in small businesses across the country. Dodd-Frank was a
response to the financial crisis of the last decade - but went too far.
The simple truth is that private equity funds neither caused nor
contributed to the financial crisis and are not a source of systemic
risk. Furthermore, private equity-backed companies employ more than 7.5
million people nationwide in more than 17,700 U.S. companies and have
invested more than $3.6 trillion in companies over ten years. The
federal government should be helping job creators to put Americans back
to work - not standing in the way.
On another matter, as we head into the final weeks of the year, I want
to share an update on the progress of the Farm Bill. Negotiators for
the House and Senate are still huddling to iron out the differences in
the two chambers' versions of this important legislation. As a member
of the House Agriculture Committee, I remain committed to producing a
Farm Bill that is fair for both consumers and farmers, and ensures a
safe, plentiful, and affordable supply of food for our country. I am in
daily contact with the Conferees, urging progress and exploring
solutions.
Finally, this is a huge week for Mizzou football as our Missouri Tigers
take on Auburn in the SEC Championship Game this weekend in Atlanta. My
colleague, Congressman Mike Rogers of Alabama, represents the district
that is home to Auburn. I am proud to represent my alma mater, Mizzou.
Congresswoman Hartzler and Congressman Mike Rogers of Alabama display
their true colors prior to Mizzou's win over Auburn in Saturday's SEC
Championship Game
We got together this week to talk football, among other things, and
made a friendly "bragging rights" wager on the outcome of the game. I
look forward to discussing Mizzou's big win with him next week and
sharing in the pizza he will have to provide to our office! Go,
MizzouRah!
Have a great week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler

Dear
Friend,
I
hope
you
had
a
good
first
week
of
the
Christmas
season.
I
was
busy
in
Washington
fighting
for
you.
The
House
took
up
and
passed
a
bill
that
will
help
provide
some
comfort
to
members
of
our
military
and
their
families
who
are
spending
time
in
airports.
The
TSA
Loose
Change
Act ,
H.R.
1095,
which
I
co-sponsored,
would
require
the
Transportation
Security
Administration
(TSA)
to
turn
over
all
loose
change
collected
from
airport
checkpoints
and
airport
facilities
to
fund
lounges
for
members
of
the
military
and
their
families.
Under
current
law,
money
collected
from
security
checkpoints
is
spent
on
civilian
aviation
security.
That
loose
change,
according
to
the
House
Homeland
Security
Committee,
adds
up
to
an
average
of
$465,000
per
year.
As
things
currently
stand,
airport
lounges
for
members
of
the
military
and
their
families
are
operated
only
by
the
United
Services
Organizations
(USO).
Our
bill
will
have
the
TSA
use
loose
change
to
have
additional
groups
provide
these
lounges
for
our
service
members.
Members
of
our
military
and
their
loved
ones
deserve
a
place
to
spend
a
few
minutes
of
precious
family
time.
This
loose
change,
small
though
it
may
be,
adds
up,
and
can
provide
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
with
a
rest
zone
they
have
earned.
I
urge
the
Senate
to
quickly
take
up
this
legislation
and
pass
it.
This
week
I
also
attended
a
classified
briefing
on
the
Iran
&#8220;deal&#8221;
with
Ambassador
Wendy
Sherman,
Under
Secretary
of
Political
Affairs
at
the
State
Department.
I
am
highly
concerned
that
this
&#8220;deal&#8221;
is
no
deal
at
all,
but
allows
Iran
to
continue
enriching
uranium
while
loosening
sanctions.
Additionally,
the
deal
does
not
address
Iran&#8217;s
imprisonment
of
American
pastor
Saeed
Abedini.
I
strongly
believe
that
any
deal
with
Iran
must
demand
the
immediate
release
of
Pastor
Abedini
and
other
Americans
being
held
in
Iranian
prisons
because
of
their
religious
beliefs.
I
remain
undeterred
in
my
opposition
to
this
deal
and
the
Administration&#8217;s
call
to
not
pass
more
sanctions.
I
cosponsored
H.R.
850,
the
Nuclear
Iran
Prevention
Act
of
2013.
This
bill
passed
the
House
this
July
in
an
overwhelmingly
bipartisan
vote.
This
week,
I
signed
on
to
a
letter
urging
the
Senate
to
take
action
on
this
vital
piece
of
legislation.
It
is
my
hope
that
the
Senate
will
take
action,
and
we
can
force
Iran
to
the
table
and
craft
a
true
deal
that
frees
Pastor
Abedini
and
prevents
a
nuclear
Iran.
Another
bill
passed
by
the
House
this
week
addresses
some
of
the
excessive
and
unnecessary
regulations
that
hurt
our
economy,
increase
costs,
and
restrict
access
to
private
sector
capital
needed
by
job
creators
in
their
effort
to
hire
American
workers
and
grow
the
economy.
The
Small
Business
Capital
Access
and
Job
Preservation
Act ,
H.R.
1105,
changes
a
regulatory
burden
imposed
by
the
Dodd-Frank
Act ,
requiring
advisers
to
private
equity
funds,
which
are
private
projects
supported
by
private
investors
with
no
government
funds,
with
more
than
$150
million
under
management
to
register
with
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
(SEC).
These
new
registration
requirements
have
forced
advisers
to
private
equity
to
undergo
a
process
that
costs
millions
of
dollars
in
initial
and
annual
compliance
costs,
imposing
an
undue
burden
on
small
and
mid-sized
private
equity
firms.
Our
fix
to
this
problem
exempts
many
of
these
advisers
from
registration
requirements
&#8211;
allowing
them
to
spend
less
time
on
red
tape
and
more
time
and
effort
investing
in
small
businesses
across
the
country.
Dodd-Frank
was
a
response
to
the
financial
crisis
of
the
last
decade
&#8211;
but
went
too
far.
The
simple
truth
is
that
private
equity
funds
neither
caused
nor
contributed
to
the
financial
crisis
and
are
not
a
source
of
systemic
risk.
Furthermore,
private
equity-backed
companies
employ
more
than
7.5
million
people
nationwide
in
more
than
17,700
U.S.
companies
and
have
invested
more
than
$3.6
trillion
in
companies
over
ten
years.
The
federal
government
should
be
helping
job
creators
to
put
Americans
back
to
work
&#8211;
not
standing
in
the
way.
On
another
matter,
as
we
head
into
the
final
weeks
of
the
year,
I
want
to
share
an
update
on
the
progress
of
the
Farm

Negotiators

the

Senate
are

in
the
two

As

I
remain
committed
to
producing
a
Farm
Bill
that
is
fair
for
both
consumers
and
farmers,
and
ensures
a
safe,
plentiful,
and
affordable
supply
of
food
for
our

I

the
Conferees,

this

as
our

Auburn
in
the
SEC

My

Alabama,
represents
the
district

I

We
