week:
Rubio: Attack On Florida School Choice
Scholarship Is An Attack On The American
Dream
Marco issued the following statement
regarding a liberal coalitions
lawsuit against a 13-year-old school choice
scholarship program that assists over
67,000 of Floridas most economically
disadvantaged schoolchildren:
This frivolous lawsuit
attacking Floridas school choice
scholarship program is an attack on the
American Dream. We cannot continue to be
an exceptional nation and our children
cannot fully realize their American Dream
as long as government policies condemn
them to failing schools. That is exactly
what this lawsuit is trying to do.
Parents of economically
disadvantaged students who want a better
future for their kids should have the
choice of sending them to better schools,
and tuition assistance like this is a vital
way they can make it work. This lawsuit
will trap our poorest students in
under-performing schools and give them no
options to help them achieve their highest
potential.
Rubio Comments On Continued Russian
Aggression Against Ukraine
On Thursday, Marco issued the following
statement regarding Russias
continued aggression against Ukraine:
Russias ongoing
violations of Ukraines sovereignty
are reprehensible and should be
concerning to all freedom loving people
around the globe. Russias actions
in support of separatists in eastern
Ukraine will only prolong the conflict,
resulting in more loss of innocent life
and further setbacks for the people of
Ukraine.
For months, I have repeatedly
called for the United States to impose
broad-based sectoral sanctions against
Moscow, including against the Russian
energy sector, and to provide much-needed
lethal assistance to the Ukrainian
military, which has performed admirably
under difficult circumstances.
The time for hollow rhetoric from
Washington and European capitals passed
long ago. Russias continued
aggression against Ukraine is yet another
instance of Moscows undermining of
the post-World War II international order.
All who seek to uphold that system must now
stand with Ukraine in its hour of need and
pressure Putin to change
course.
Rubio To Obama: Unilateral Action Will
Close The Door To Real Immigration Reform
As the Obama administration considers
sweeping executive action to grant legal
status to millions of people residing in
the U.S. illegally, Marco called on
President Obama to reject any unilateral
action and work with Congress to achieve
realistic, sequential immigration
reform.
In
a
letter to the President , Marco
highlighted the adverse impact unilateral
action will have on any progress toward
real reform, and laid out the steps
necessary to achieve immigration reform,
including the need to first address border
security and protect American workers.
Excerpts of the letter are below:
It is my sincere belief that if
we can bring illegal immigration under
control and modernize our legal
immigration system, then the American
people and a majority of their
representatives in Congress would be
willing to reasonably and responsibly
address the issue of millions of people
currently in this nation illegally. It
will not be easy. And it will not be
unanimous. But if we can make real
progress on stemming the tide of illegal
immigration, I am convinced we will have
the support necessary to address this
serious issue once and for all,
wrote Rubio . All of this is
why I have grown increasingly alarmed by
news that your administration is
considering sweeping executive action to
give work permits to millions of people
here illegally. If indeed you move
forward on such a decision, I believe it
will close the door to any chance of
making progress on immigration reform for
the foreseeable future.
I know you are receiving
tremendous political pressure from
certain activists to grant another
unilateral, temporary and uncertain legal
status to millions of additional
undocumented immigrants,
added Rubio . But to do so,
without first taking any serious steps to
address the border or protect American
workers, will increase the perception of
ambiguity in our laws, incentivize more
people to immigrate here illegally, and
significantly set back the prospects of
real reform.
As someone who believes
sincerely in the need for reform, is the
son of immigrants, and lives in a
community of immigrants, I still reserve
some optimism that youll reject
the politics of the moment and remember
that the decisions you make will impact
the people at the heart of this issue
long after your duty to serve them has
come to an end,
continued Rubio .

Constituent Casework Corner
Theo, a veteran residing in Central
Florida, contacted Senator Rubio when his
retroactive pension benefit payment was not
received from the Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA). A member of the staff
contacted the VA and learned that although
Theo had provided the VA with a direct
deposit when he originally filed his claim
10 months prior, he had since changed
banks. Consequently, his payment bounced
back to the VA. Once the correct
information was provided, the payment was
restored to Theo.
