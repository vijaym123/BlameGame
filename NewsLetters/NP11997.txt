Dear Friend,
This week, the GOP-led House of Representatives took action to curb
government abuses that are impacting the daily lives of Americans
across the country.
Whether its burdensome regulations, wasteful spending, government
overreach or a lack of transparency and accountability, more must be
done to ensure these types of issues are addressed.
The House voted on several bills to tackle many of these problems. For
example, the House voted on HR 899, a bill that will enhance
transparency of federal mandates and increase consideration about their
impact on the private sector. We continued our efforts to hold the IRS
accountable by voting on legislation that will ensure the practice of
political targeting is stopped once and for all.
We also voted on the Taxpayers Right-To-Know Act, which would require
every federal agency to provide taxpayers an annual report card on all
of its programs, including administrative costs, expenditures for
service and number of program recipients. Along the same lines, a vote
was held on the Taxpayer Transparency Act. This bill would require
executive branch agencies to include a disclaimer to alert the public
to any communication such as mailers, TV/radio ads, etc. that are paid
for at the taxpayer expense.
To see a full list of the legislation the House voted on this week,

. I hope the Senate will join the House in supporting these
commonsense pieces of legislation.
Sincerely,
Kay Granger
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
This
week,
the
GOP-led
House
of
Representatives took
action
to curb
government
abuses
that
are
impacting
the
daily
lives
of
Americans
across
the
country.
Whether
its
burdensome
regulations,
wasteful
spending,
government
overreach
or
a
lack
of
transparency
and
accountability,
more
must
be
done
to
ensure
these
types
of
issues
are
addressed.
The
House
voted
on
several
bills
to
tackle
many
of
these
problems.
For
example,
the
House voted on
HR
899,
a
bill
that
will
enhance
transparency
of
federal
mandates
and
increase
consideration
about
their
impact
on
the
private
sector.
We
continued our
efforts
to
hold the
IRS
accountable
by
voting
on
legislation
that
will
ensure
the
practice
of
political
targeting
is
stopped
once
and
for
all.
We
also
voted
on
the
Taxpayers
Right-To-Know
Act,
which
would
require
every
federal
agency
to
provide
taxpayers
an
annual
report
card
on
all
of
its
programs,
including
administrative
costs,
expenditures
for
service
and
number
of
program
recipients.
Along
the
same
lines,
a
vote was
held
on
the
Taxpayer
Transparency
Act.
This
bill
would
require
executive
branch
agencies
to
include
a
disclaimer
to
alert
the
public
to
any
communication
such
as
mailers,
TV/radio
ads,
etc.
that
are
paid
for
at
the
taxpayer
expense.

the

I
hope
the
Senate
will
join
the
House
in
supporting
these
commonsense
pieces
of
legislation.
