LEGISLATIVE
December 18, 2014
Dear Friends,
Congress recently
finished work for the 113th Congress after a prolonged fight over the
Fiscal Year 2015 Appropriations bill. There is no such thing as a
perfect bill, but the so-called cromnibus was deeply flawed. I weighed
the good against the bad, and in the end I voted against
it.
The cromnibus breaks promise
after promise that we have made to the American people. It leaves
taxpayers vulnerable to another bank bailout, guts campaign finance reform,
reduces promised pension benefits for retirees, and cuts Pell Grants
for students.
Taxpayers were badly burned by the 2008 financial meltdown. Gambling in the
derivatives market was a major contributor to the crisis that wrecked
the job market and drove the global economy to the brink of collapse.
Big banks invested money from government-insured bank accounts in
risky derivatives, and when they could not afford to cover their bad bets,
we had to bail them out.
I voted for the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act in 2010 to protect us from this sort of reckless behavior on
Wall Street. One of its most important provisions stopped banks from
gambling with depositors money. By rolling back that firewall, the
cromnibus leaves taxpayers liable for another potential
bailout.
Additionally, our
democracy should not be at the mercy of special interests that have the means
to promote their narrow political agenda. I have long advocated for a
constitutional amendment that would overturn Citizens United and
restore federal limits for campaign contributions. The cromnibus further
erodes the trust that the public has placed in our electoral system by
loosening restrictions on campaign donations to the national parties.
Individual donors can now contribute up to $324,000 a year, a tenfold
increase. We need sensible limits so that the voices of the majority
are not silenced by voices of a select few.
The appropriations bill also contains too many
cuts that hurt the middle class. Pension benefits for current retirees
74 years old and younger will be cut
a first in 40 years. We should
not balance the budget on backs retirees who have worked and
contributed to their retirement years, only to have their promised benefits
cut.
Nor should we
break our promise to students by scaling back our investment in higher
education. The cromnibus cuts $303 million in funding for the Pell
Grants, thereby raising the cost of college for millions of students.
My priority is
with the hard working Americans and their families whose contributions
have enabled our nation to grow and prosper. That is my promise to
you, and one that has not been broken in the 26 years that I have had the
privilege to serve you in the U.S. House of
Representatives.
Sincerely,
Eliot L.
Engel
MEMBER OF CONGRESS
Our nation deserves more than a last-minute appropriations bill that
undercuts the middle class. I voted against the Fiscal Year 2015
Appropriations bill because the bad far outweighed the
good.
