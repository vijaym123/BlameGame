Are you done? Have you quit?
Because if you&rsquo;ve given up on this election, then we should just quit now. But we don&rsquo;t want to quit.
It&rsquo;s the last election of Barack Obama&rsquo;s Presidency. Do we really want the final result to be Boehner winning the biggest Republican majority since the 1940s? According to our records, you haven&rsquo;t answered President Obama&rsquo;s latest call-to-action:
