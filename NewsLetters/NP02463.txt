Where Texas Became
Texas
It all started in a small town nestled between the
Barrington Farm and the Jordan Creek along the banks of the Brazos River
thats where the early seeds of the Lone Star State were
planted.
If youre from Texas, youre probably familiar with names
like Davy Crockett, Sam Houston, and Steven F. Austin.
It would
be hard to grow up here without repeatedly hearing the story of how
our ancestorsbeat oppression, won the Texas Revolution, and declared
independence as the Republic of Texas.
Certainly, you
Remember the Alamo.
For two weeks, Mexican soldiers
had been launching attacks at Texas southern border in attempts to
squander our budding independence.
They quickly drained our
resources and numbers.
But they could never drain our
spirit.
In the midst of the fight, five newly-elected Texas delegates
hunkered down along the Brazos banks and rushed to put pen to paper.
Time was of the essence.
Messengers reported that just 350 miles
south, the number of remaining Texan soldiers had dwindled into the
double-digits.
They were desperate to defend the Alamo against an
onslaught of
thousands
of fresh Mexican soldiers, and they
were failing.
The five delegates burned the midnight oil
literally
jotting down ideas that would soon change
history.
The next morning, the other 54 delegates returned to what we now call
Independence Hall to make it official.
It was March
2 nd , 1836, and the first lone star had just been hoisted into the sky as
a symbol of Texas freedom and the now independent Republic of
Texas.
For ten years, the Republic thrived on the same ideals that
still drive our state: freedom, personal responsibility, and plain old
hard work.
On December 29, 1845, Texas became the
28 th
state to join the United States
the first state with history as
its own independent nation.
Although the Republic of Texas
was short-lived, the Texas spirit lives on.
Look around, and
youll see were still Texans undeterred, working hard to provide for our
families. Our states employment boasts the fastest growth rate of all
50 states, and creates the most international trade of all 50 states.
And we still fight just as hard to protect our ideals and our
neighbors.
County Commissioner Ben Perry hit the nail on the
head when he told me what we Texans know too well: Being a Texan
doesnt describe where youre from, it describes who your family is.
So as spring comes along and
we celebrate new beginnings of all kinds, I know across Texas well
all be celebrating the beginnings of our great state, right here in
Washington-on-the-Brazos, nestled between the Barrington Farm and the
Jordan Creek.
Thats where Texas became
Texas.
