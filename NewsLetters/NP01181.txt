Wisdom of the District: Estate Taxes
Legislation signed into law in 2013 allows an individual to pass on $5.43 million without paying an estate tax.
A couple can pass on $10.86 million tax free.
However, for estates worth more than this, a 40% estate tax is collected by the government.
This applies to approximately 5,400 American families.

Do you believe the estate tax should be repealed entirely?
( )
No, do not repeal the estate tax
this revenue is needed to fund government programs, and the wealthiest Americans can afford to pay more.
( )
Yes, this is an unfair tax
regardless of a familys wealth and even if the change adds to our debt, this is money that has already been taxed and should not be taxed again when passed to the next generation.
( )
Yes, philosophically, this is an unfair tax and should be eliminated, but ONLY if we can find reasonable spending reforms to offset the lost revenue.
Otherwise we will be adding to our already historic debt.
( )
I dont know or I have another answer.
