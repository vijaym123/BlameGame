Dear Friends,
I invite you to join me for
Ready, Set, SUCCEED :
A Women&rsquo;s Small Business Seminar to be held on Friday, June 13, 2014 in San Francisco.
The Seminar is designed to assist current and aspiring business owners in the Bay Area overcome potential roadblocks.
Women entrepreneurs are the fastest growing segment in the small business community. However, while women have made great strides to reach economic parity with men in the world of business, major challenges still persist. This seminar is designed to help women overcome these challenges.
At the Seminar you can participate in workshops designed to help women entrepreneurs kick start their small business, practice their pitch, network with Bay Area lenders and small business organizations, discuss motherhood &amp; entrepreneurship and learn about the benefits of crowd funding and micro-lending. We&rsquo;ll also hear inspiring words of wisdom from
co-founder and president of Eventbrite, Julia Hartz .
When women succeed, America succeeds. There are more than 8.9 million women-owned businesses in the United States employing almost 8 million people. At $1.3 trillion in sales annually, their economic impact is significant and should be celebrated, supported and recognized. We need our women business owners to be successful to drive economic growth. To register for this FREE event, click
