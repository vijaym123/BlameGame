Dear
David,
California is in a historic drought. We are in the fourth
straight year of exceptionally dry conditions. With the wet season drawing
to a close, snowpack in the Sierra Nevada stands at five percent of
the historical average, creating dangerously low water levels in rivers,
reservoirs, and lakes across the state. The lack of rainfall is also
straining Ventura Countys local groundwater supply, which serves many
of our areas urban and agricultural areas.
This is a
crisis. For the first time in California history, Governor Brown has
directed the State Water Resources Control Board to implement mandatory
water use reductions in cities and town across California to reduce
water usage by 25 percent. Everyone has a part to play in helping
California conserve water, and I believe that all stakeholders, including
our local, state, and federal government agencies, need to work
together to increase Californias water recycling, storage, and
sustainability.
But I want to hear from you! Take the survey below
to express your thoughts on the California
Drought.
Do you agree with Governor Brown's
Executive Order to address the drought? 25% is about right 25% is too high 25% is too low Other If you believe other measures should
be taken to address the drought, what do you think should be
done? *By answering this survey, you are

Please be assured that I will keep in mind your viewpoint as I work
towards serious solutions that meet the water needs of stakeholders and
consumers across California. It is with your input that I can most
effectively advocate for our community in Congress.
Sincerely,
JULIA BROWNLEY
Member of
Congress
