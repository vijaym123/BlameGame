Dear Fellow Nevadan,
Our children and youth
should always be a priority, as they represent our most important
investment in the future of our state and the nation. The presence of
positive role models is pivotal in helping our children discover their full
potential and the enormous wealth of opportunities before them. This
January, we celebrate National Mentoring Month by honoring those
individuals who have devoted their time, wisdom, and love to inspire and
embolden Nevada's youth.
Every child can benefit from having a
mentor in his or her life. When I was a young man, attending Basic
High School, I met Mike O'Callaghan, who would later become my teacher,
my boxing coach, and my best friend. The first time I ever saw this
remarkable man in action, he was defending a classmate from a bully,
which really made him my kind of guy. One of the many things he taught me
was that the little guy was always worth fighting for.
Mike
entered Democratic politics and served as Nevadas Governor for eight
years. I was lucky to have the privilege of seeing him take on
more bullies than I could count as governor. Mike continued to be my
mentor for many years; after I got to Washington, I would talk to him at
least once a week.
Many of the opportunities I have had
would not have been possible without Mike's support. This month, I
encourage you to reach out to anyone who has made a positive impact on
your life. More importantly, reach out to Nevada organizations, such as
the organizations listed below, to find ways you can mentor Nevada's
youth and make a positive impact on our state's
future.
100 Black Men of Las Vegas
takes an intergenerational approach to mentoring by connecting their
members with young men at several local elementary schools and community
centers.
Purple
W.I.N.G.S.
offers a unique approach to mentoring by catching young girls
and women at various ages and stages with a specific outreach to
young women in the criminal justice system. This program encourages these
young women to see beyond their current situation to the future that
is available to them.
Nevada
Partners Inc .
is currently spearheading a number of
mentoring programs under the
My Brothers Keeper
Initiative , including a partnership with
Big
Brothers Big Sisters of Southern
Nevada
piloting an evidence-based mentoring program for high
school students at West Preparatory Academy, aiming to provide support
through their first two years of college. This program recognizes
that mentoring is necessary in order to achieve goals and seeks to
support struggling students as they work towards high school graduation and
college attendance. Additionally, the My Brothers Keeper
Collaborative, in partnership with local elected officials, held a community-wide
summit to identify the local continuum of mentoring programming to
ensure local youth have many opportunities for mentoring support. The
summit resulted in a capacity-building effort that now includes training
local mentoring organizations.
Big Brothers Big Sisters of Northern Nevada
connects
mentors with young boys and girls to help them develop the confidence
they need to do well in school and lead successful
lives.
