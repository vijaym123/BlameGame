WEEK IN
REVIEW
Thank you to all of the
Arkansans who braved the impeding weather and came by my office this week,
including the Arkansas Prosecuting Attorneys Association, Jack
Mitchell of HealthSouth, representatives with the Pulp and Paperworkers
Resource Council, Eric Willinghan with the American Association of Food
Safety Veterinarians, the American Federation of Government Employees,
the Arkansas Fraternal Order of Police, Bill Wilde with the Taxpayer
Advocate Service, Dr. Steven Gates, Dr. Evelyn Jorgenson, Ric Clifford,
and Dan Shewmaker from NWACC, the Arkansas Rural Water Association,
Dr. John English and Dr. Eric Sandgren from the University of Arkansas
system, Arkansass Secretary of State Mark Martin, and Arkansas Habitat
for Humanity.
On Tuesday, the House passed an amendment to S. 25. The
amendment extends the mandatory spending sequester set forth in the
Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 for an
additional year, fiscal year 2024. It also fixes the annual cost-of-living
adjustment (COLA) for working-age military retirees who are 62 years
old or younger that was lowered by the Bipartisan Budget Act. This was
one of my biggest concerns with that deal.
I believe there
is a better way to reform military compensation and am glad Congress
addressed the issue. Now, Congress and the military community turn to
looking at broader compensation reforms that
make no mistake
must
be made. Like the nation as a whole, mandatory spending on pensions,
health care, and the like will consume an increasingly-larger
percentage of the Department of Defenses (DOD) budget, will have a long-term
impact on its operational needs, and will undoubtedly affect our
ability to project power and support our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and
marines down range.
On Tuesday evening, I voted against an
amendment to S. 540, the Temporary Debt Limit Extension Act, which the
House passed by a vote of 221-201. The amendment suspends the debt
ceiling through March 15, 2015, and continues to allow the secretary of
the Treasury to employ extraordinary measures; it was passed by the
Senate on Wednesday.
I recognize that failing to raise the
debt ceiling has extremely serious consequences, but raising it
without making a single spending reform is equally as irresponsible, and
thats what this vote was. I simply could not support a clean debt
ceiling increase.
From the
Front...
