A
MESSAGE FROM CONGRESSMAN STENY H. HOYER
Last
November, President Obama took action to keep families together and to
start to fix our nations broken immigration system. On Wednesday,
April 15, I will be hosting an immigration services event and rally to
raise awareness about the President's executive actions on immigration
and to provide information about the expansion of the Deferred Action
for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and the new Deferred Action for
Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) program
before applications become available. Im proud to host these events
with my friend and colleague, Congressman Luis Gutirrez (D-IL), who
has been a leader in Congress on immigration reform, and I hope that
you can join us.
More than 70% of Americans support
comprehensive immigration reform that keeps families together, secures our
borders, and strengthens our economy.
I will continue to work
with Rep. Gutirrez and my Democratic colleagues in Congress to
fight for comprehensive immigration reform that will help families
who want nothing more than to make Maryland and our nation
stronger.
