Dear Friend,
It&rsquo;s 5pm in Boston on the last day of June, which means we have exactly 7 hours to blow past our $36,000 goal before the FEC filing deadline.
We&rsquo;ve had a good month -- but I&rsquo;m not satisfied with a good month. I want a
great
month to give a
great
Senator the resources he needs to keep fighting. Please, if you can, give $5, $10, $25, or whatever makes sense for you.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Your contribution will make the difference as our campaign heads into the home stretch. And in a year when the Tea Party is only six seats away from controlling the Senate, even the smallest advantage could have huge consequences. We have to hit our $36,000 goal, and we have to do it before midnight. Chip in $5 to help make it happen.
Thank you.
Colleen
