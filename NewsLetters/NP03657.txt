A New Year,
A New Congress
Dear Friend,
As this year comes to a close, so too
does the 113th Congress. I believe that we
as a country have much to look forward to
as a new year and a new 114th Congress
begin.
Over the course of the last year, we
have faced great challenges -- high
unemployment rates, rising costs for
healthcare, ever-increasing national debt,
and stifled job growth as a result of
misguided and outdated federal government
policies. All of these challenges have
stood in the way of a robust economic
recovery and greater opportunities for all
Virginians.
In fact, over the course of the last
year, the House of Representatives has
remained laser-focused on advancing a
pro-growth jobs agenda to address these
challenges and to get our economy moving.
During this past 113th Congress, we in the
House passed 742 bills, while the Senate
only passed 437 bills. In addition, the
House passed seven appropriations bills
through regular order, while the Senate did
not pass any such appropriations bills. It
has been very frustrating to work to pass
legislation in the House that would make it
easier for working Americans to succeed,
only to watch most those same bills die in
the Senate.
Now that the American people have given
us new leadership in the Senate, we will
have a new opportunity to get our work
done, and I believe our future is bright.
We as Americans live in the freest and most
prosperous country in the world, and we
have the ability to choose which path we
will take for our future. We recognize
that, like those before us, we have a duty
to leave this country a better place for
our children and grandchildren.
As we begin a new year and commence a
new 114th Congress, we must re-commit
ourselves to the promises we have made to
work every day to make this place better
than we found it, and we must re-commit
ourselves to the founding constitutional
principles that have made this country
great
principles of freedom,
self-government, and opportunity. We must
work every day to promote policies that
will make it easier for our farmers, our
Main Street businesses, and our working
families to succeed. I believe that if we
keep the promises we have made, we will
indeed build a stronger America for our
children and grandchildren.
As we commence 2015, it is my greatest
hope that the new Senate and President
Obama will join us in this commitment.
In closing, let me say once again, it is
a great honor to serve the people of
Virginias Fifth District, and I look
forward to working with my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle and on both sides
of the Capitol to address the challenges
that we face.
