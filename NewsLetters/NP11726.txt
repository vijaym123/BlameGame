Capitol Update
Opinion Article from Congressman Cook: Mr. President, Don't Gut Our
Military
We are at a unique point in our nation's history and must stand ready
to defend against those who threaten our security. The Al-Qaeda network
continues spreading through North Africa and the Middle East, Russia is
threatening former Soviet territories, China continues clashing with
Japan and Taiwan over the South China Sea, and North Korea and Iran
continue to illicit nuclear programs in violation of international
agreements. The world is an increasingly dangerous place, but our brave
men and women in uniform stand ready to meet these challenges.
Unfortunately, the President and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel are
refusing to stand with them by not providing our military with the
support it needs to accomplish its mission.
It is unacceptable that the President refuses to cut wasteful domestic
spending while demanding that our military do more with less. As the
President threatens to shrink the Army to the smallest level since
World War II, close crucial military bases, and reduce military pay
raises and benefits, we face a very real threat that our armed services
will be left without the resources they need to carry out large-scale
military actions. Because the President is abdicating his
responsibility to ensure America's Armed Forces are ready to meet any
challenge, Congress must act. This year's bipartisan budget agreement
granted temporary sequestration relief for 2015 and 2016, but it did
not negate the Budget Control Act's bottom line of $487 billion in
defense cuts over ten years.
This massive hit to national security will have an enormous effect on
California and the Eighth Congressional District. It could cost the
Army roughly $615 million in California alone. Up to $60 million of
those cuts could come from Fort Irwin, while the Marine Corps estimates
a $126 million dollar hit to Twentynine Palms and a $16 million loss by
the Marine Corps Logistics Base at Barstow. This will impair research
and development, personnel accounts, and modernization accounts.
Additionally, Secretary Hagel's threat of carrying out a new round of
base closures, would put all of our local bases at risk.
In order for America's Armed Forces to remain the premier fighting
force in the world, we must recognize that even small budgetary
reductions can have a huge impact on capabilities. General Raymond
Odierno, the Army's Chief of Staff, has stated that the active
component of the Army adequately cannot respond to threats around the
world if its end-strength is cut below 450,000 soldiers. The Navy is
facing an early decommissioning of the USS George Washington just as
naval tensions are rising in the Persian Gulf and the Western Pacific
due to budgetary pressure from the White House. Secretary Hagel's
proposed reductions in military pay and benefits could also lead to a
loss of mid-level officers. This would leave our military with less
experienced leaders, significantly increasing the risk to our men and
women serving abroad.
I will continue pushing Congress to oppose the President's hollowing
out of our military. I will continue the fight in this year's National
Defense Authorization Act to guarantee that when our sons and daughters
commit to fight for their country, they know their country is fighting
for them.
Congressman Paul Cook Announces Award of Military Aircraft to Logistics
Airport in Victorville
Congressman Paul Cook congratulated the 163rd Air Reconnaissance Wing
on the award of six new MQ-9 Reaper remotely piloted aircraft.
The MQ-9 aircraft will replace the MQ-1 aircraft currently stationed
and maintained at the Southern California Logistics Airport -
Victorville (SCLA). The recapitalization solidifies the mission of the
163rd Air Reconnaissance Wing. These new aircraft will also bring much
needed jobs to the Victor Valley area. The Department of Defense is one
of the largest regional employers in the Eighth Congressional District
and this will keep it invested in the area and protect high paying
jobs. The accompanying MQ-9 training program will make SCLA the only
training base for MQ-9s in the western United States.
Said Cook, "I'm excited that the Logistics Airport in Victorville will
be hosting these new military aircraft. I fought for this in last year's
National Defense Authorization Act because it will bring jobs and help
the High Desert economy to grow. I believe that the talented men and
women of the 163rd make Victorville the natural choice for the
recapitalization of MQ-9s."
San Bernardino County First District Supervisor Robert Lovingood
commented, "Our region has played a role in America's defense since
World War II and the creation of George Air Force Base. Today, General
Atomics is located right here in the High Desert building the next
generation of unmanned aerial vehicles. So it is fitting that these
MQ-9s will fly and be maintained right here at home."
Major General David Baldwin, the Adjutant General of California said,
"The protection of our men and women in harm's way is paramount to our
nation's continued success, both here in California fighting fires and
other disasters, and overseas in defense of our country. Representative
Cook's support for this vital, lifesaving air asset at Southern
California Logistics Airport highlights his experience as a former
Marine Colonel who knows that giving our men and women the tools they
need for success is absolutely critical."
Congressman Cook Votes to End IRS Harassment of Americans
Congressman Paul Cook voted for H.R. 3865, "Stop Targeting of Political
Beliefs by the IRS Act of 2014." This important legislation will end
the targeting of conservative organizations by the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS).
The IRS proposed changes to section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 2986 which aimed to restrict organizations from performing
grassroots activity by expanding the definition and scope of
"candidate-related political activity." This bill prohibits the IRS
from modifying that section.
Said Cook, "The administration's attempts to use the IRS to harass
groups it disagrees with must end. The first amendment to our
Constitution guarantees free speech, and I'm absolutely dedicated to
protecting the constitutional rights of our citizens. Today's vote will
help stop this lawless administration's attempts to intimidate and
silence Americans who disagree with it."
Congressman Cook Meets with Representatives from California State
University San Bernardino
Last week, Congressman Cook had a productive meeting with
representatives from California State University, San Bernardino in his
Capitol Office. He met with Trustee Lou Monville, University President
Toms Morales, Student Body President Anthony Ochoa, and Student
Government Director of External Affairs Juan Herrera.

Congressman Cook In The News
Treatment of Graves at Riverside National Cemetery Shocks Marine's
Family
On the seventh anniversary of the death of her son - a 25-year-old
Marine killed when his helicopter was shot down in Iraq - Laura
Landaker visited his grave at Riverside National Cemetery to find
solace and mark his passing.
The Landaker family was shocked by landscaping work at the Riverside
National Cemetery on Feb. 7, 2014.
Instead, she found a construction zone.
Graves were being run over with heavy machinery, and the grass was
pulled up to reveal raw dirt. Workers flipped over flat headstones with
pick-axes.
"I was very upset at the sight of it . I felt as if I was starting from
the beginning again with just dirt, no grass," Landaker wrote in a
Facebook post
.
"Each one of those precious markers represents a loved one and their
last resting place and they deserved more," she wrote in a separate
post
.
"Where is the respect that we should show them each day?"
Her son, Marine Lt. Jared Landaker, was one of a crew of seven who were
killed when a U.S. military helicopter was fired upon and went down
during a flight to Fallujah in 2007. The service members had only a
week left in Iraq.
Jared Landaker, a Big Bear City native a University of La Verne
graduate, was buried at Riverside National Cemetery about two weeks
later, according to the Seven Stars Foundation
, which was founded by
his family to honor him and the other crew members.
At the cemetery on Feb. 7, as Jared Landaker's friends and family were
upset, seeing the gravesites so disturbed by workers.
"It was hard," childhood friend Stacie Hernandez said. "It was already
an emotional day, but to encounter that at the same time, it was very
hard for all of us."
The construction work was part of a multiyear renovation meant to
beautify the site, a cemetery administrator told the San Bernardino Sun
. The project was expected to be
finished by Memorial Day.
The Landakers said that family members should be notified about the
work so they're not shocked when they arrive to visit loved ones'
graves. But the administrator said that with more 200,000 buried there,
it's not feasible for families to be informed, the Sun reported.
The family has called for change, asking their Congressman, Rep. Paul
Cook for help. Cook, a Republican, said the family sent him "very, very
graphic" photos.
Cook and Rep. Mark Takano, a Democrat whose district includes
Riverside, has asked the Department of Veterans Affairs for a "dignity
clause" for all national cemeteries - a way for cemetery administrators
to be held accountable.
"That is one of the main responsibilities of the administrator. You
can't just pass it off to the contractor and say go ahead and do what
you want to do and not pay attention to that very, very special thing,"
Cook said.
His office did not immediately return a request for more information on
Monday.
The Landaker has a "huge sense of relief" knowing others may never have
to go through what they went through, Hernandez said.
For her part, Laura Landaker said that as she sat by her son's grave
after others left on Feb. 7, he spoke to her.
"I bet you would not expect to see my resting place in this condition
today," Landaker wrote
,
explaining what she heard from her son.
"But there is a reason you were meant to see it today more than any
other day . You and I are closing the door on the last seven years of
pain, being lost, and feeling so vulnerable and starting on a new
journey together. You stand here a stronger, more confident woman, one
I knew was always there. All the pain and joys of the last seven years
are your foundation to the next seven years."

Capitol
Update
Opinion
Article
from
Congressman
Cook:
Mr.
President,
Don&#8217;t
Gut
Our
Military
We
are
at
a
unique
point
in
our
nation&#8217;s
history
and
must
stand
ready
to
defend
against
those
who
threaten
our
security.
The
Al-Qaeda
network
continues
spreading
through
North
Africa
and
the
Middle
East,
Russia
is
threatening
former
Soviet
territories,
China
continues
clashing
with
Japan
and
Taiwan
over
the
South
China
Sea,
and
North
Korea
and
Iran
continue
to
illicit
nuclear
programs
in
violation
of
international
agreements.
The
world
is
an
increasingly
dangerous
place,
but
our
brave
men
and
women
in
uniform
stand
ready
to
meet
these
challenges.
Unfortunately,
the
President
and
Secretary
of
Defense
Chuck
Hagel
are
refusing
to
stand
with
them
by
not
providing
our
military
with
the
support
it
needs
to
accomplish
its
mission.
It
is
unacceptable
that
the
President
refuses
to
cut
wasteful
domestic
spending
while
demanding
that
our
military
do
more
with
less.
As
the
President
threatens
to
shrink
the
Army
to
the
smallest
level
since
World
War
II,
close
crucial
military
bases,
and
reduce
military
pay
raises
and
benefits,
we
face
a
very
real
threat
that
our
armed
services
will
be
left
without
the
resources
they
need
to
carry
out
large-scale
military
actions.
Because
the
President
is
abdicating
his
responsibility
to
ensure
America&#8217;s
Armed
Forces
are
ready
to
meet
any
challenge,
Congress
must
act.
This
year&#8217;s
bipartisan
budget
agreement
granted
temporary
sequestration
relief
for
2015
and
2016,
but
it
did
not
negate
the
Budget
Control
Act&#8217;s
bottom
line
of
$487
billion
in
defense
cuts
over
ten
years.
This
massive
hit
to
national
security
will
have
an
enormous
effect
on
California
and
the
Eighth
Congressional
District.
It
could
cost
the
Army
roughly
$615
million
in
California
alone.
Up
to
$60
million
of
those
cuts
could
come
from
Fort
Irwin,
while
the
Marine
Corps
estimates
a
$126
million
dollar
hit
to
Twentynine
Palms
and
a
$16
million
loss
by
the
Marine
Corps
Logistics
Base
at
Barstow.
This
will
impair
research
and
development,
personnel
accounts,
and
modernization
accounts.
Additionally,
Secretary
Hagel&#8217;s
threat
of
carrying
out
a
new
round
of
base
closures,
would
put
all
of
our
local
bases
at
risk.
In
order
for
America&#8217;s
Armed
Forces
to
remain
the
premier
fighting
force
in
the
world,
we
must
recognize
that
even
small
budgetary
reductions
can
have
a
huge
impact
on
capabilities.
General
Raymond
Odierno,
the
Army&#8217;s
Chief
of
Staff,
has
stated
that
the
active
component
of
the
Army
adequately
cannot
respond
to
threats
around
the
world
if
its
end-strength
is
cut
below
450,000
soldiers.
The
Navy
is
facing
an
early
decommissioning
of
the
USS
George
Washington
just
as
naval
tensions
are
rising
in
the
Persian
Gulf
and
the
Western
Pacific
due
to
budgetary
pressure
from
the
White
House.
Secretary
Hagel&#8217;s
proposed
reductions
in
military
pay
and
benefits
could
also
lead
to
a
loss
of
mid-level
officers.
This
would
leave
our
military
with
less
experienced
leaders,
significantly
increasing
the
risk
to
our
men
and
women
serving
abroad.
I
will
continue
pushing
Congress
to
oppose
the
President&#8217;s
hollowing
out
of
our
military.
I
will
continue
the
fight
in
this
year&#8217;s
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
to
guarantee
that
when
our
sons
and
daughters
commit
to

they

their

is
fighting
for
them.
Congressman
Paul
Cook
Announces
Award
of
Military
Aircraft
to
Logistics
Airport
in
Victorville
Congressman
Paul
Cook
congratulated
the
163rd
Air
Reconnaissance
Wing
on
the
award
of
six
new
MQ-9
Reaper
remotely
piloted
aircraft.
The
MQ-9
aircraft
will
replace
the
MQ-1
aircraft
currently
stationed
and
maintained
at
the
Southern
California
Logistics
Airport
-
Victorville
(SCLA).
The
recapitalization
solidifies
the
mission
of
the
163rd
Air
Reconnaissance
Wing.
These
new
aircraft
will
also
bring
much
needed
jobs
to
the
Victor
Valley
area.
The
Department
of
Defense
is
one
of
the
largest
regional
employers
in
the
Eighth
Congressional
District
and
this
will
keep
it
invested
in
the
area
and
protect
high
paying
jobs.
The
accompanying
MQ-9
training
program
will
make
SCLA
the
only
training
base
for
MQ-9s
in
the
western
United
States.
Said
Cook,
&#8220;I&#8217;m
excited
that
the
Logistics
Airport
in
Victorville
will
be
hosting
these
new
military
aircraft.
I
fought
for
this
in
last
year&#8217;s
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
because
it
will
bring
jobs
and
help
the
High
Desert
economy
to
grow.
I
believe
that
the
talented
men
and
women
of
the
163rd
make
Victorville
the
natural
choice
for
the
recapitalization
of
MQ-9s.&#8221;
San
Bernardino
County
First
District
Supervisor
Robert
Lovingood
commented,
&#8220;Our
region
has
played
a
role
in
America&#8217;s
defense
since
World
War
II
and
the
creation
of
George
Air
Force
Base.
Today,
General
Atomics
is
located
right
here
in
the
High
Desert
building
the
next
generation
of
unmanned
aerial
vehicles.
So
it
is
fitting
that
these
MQ-9s
will
fly
and
be
maintained
right
here
at
home.&#8221;
Major
General
David
Baldwin,
the
Adjutant
General
of
California
said,
&#8220;The
protection
of
our
men
and
women
in
harm&#8217;s
way
is
paramount
to
our
nation&#8217;s
continued
success,
both
here
in
California
fighting
fires
and
other
disasters,
and
overseas
in
defense
of
our
country.
Representative
Cook&#8217;s
support
for
this
vital,
lifesaving
air
asset
at
Southern
California
Logistics
Airport
highlights
his
experience
as
a
former
Marine
Colonel
who
knows
that
giving
our
men
and
women
the
tools
they
need
for
success
is
absolutely
critical.&#8221;

Americans
Congressman
Paul
Cook
voted
for
H.R.
3865,
&#8220;Stop
Targeting
of
Political
Beliefs
by
the
IRS
Act
of
2014.&#8221;
This
important
legislation
will
end
the
targeting
of
conservative
organizations
by
the
Internal

(IRS).
The
IRS
proposed
changes
to
section
501(c)(4)
of
the
Internal
Revenue
Code
of
2986
which
aimed
to
restrict
organizations
from

the
definition
and
scope
of
&#8220;candidate-related
political
activity.&#8221;
This
bill
prohibits
the
IRS
from

that
section.
Said
Cook,
&#8220;The
administration&#8217;s
attempts
to
use
the
IRS
to
harass
groups
it
disagrees
with
must
end.
The
first

to
our
Constitution
guarantees
free

and
I&#8217;m
absolutely
dedicated
to
protecting
the
constitutional

Today&#8217;s

attempts
to
intimidate
and

Americans
who
disagree
with
it.&#8221;

Congressman
Cook
In
The
News Treatment
of
Graves
at
Riverside
National
Cemetery
Shocks
Marine&#8217;s
Family
On
the
seventh
anniversary
of
the
death
of
her
son
&#8212;
a
25-year-old
Marine
killed
when
his
helicopter
was
shot
down
in
Iraq
&#8212;
Laura
Landaker
visited
his
grave
at
Riverside
National
Cemetery
to
find
solace
and
mark
his
passing.
The
Landaker
family
was
shocked
by
landscaping
work
at
the
Riverside
National
Cemetery
on
Feb.
7,
2014.
Instead,
she
found
a
construction
zone.
Graves
were
being
run
over
with
heavy
machinery,
and
the
grass
was
pulled
up
to
reveal
raw
dirt.
Workers
flipped
over
flat
headstones
with
pick-axes.
&#8220;I
was
very
upset
at
the
sight
of
it
&#8230;
I
felt
as
if
I
was
starting
from
the
beginning
again
with
just
dirt,
no
grass,&#8221;
Landaker
wrote
in
a
Facebook
post .
&#8220;Each
one
of
those
precious
markers
represents
a
loved
one
and
their
last
resting
place
and
they
deserved
more,&#8221;
she
wrote
in
a
separate
post .
&#8220;Where
is
the
respect
that
we
should
show
them
each
day?&#8221;
Her
son,
Marine
Lt.
Jared
Landaker,
was
one
of
a
crew
of
seven
who
were
killed
when
a
U.S.
military
helicopter
was
fired
upon
and
went
down
during
a
flight
to
Fallujah
in
2007.
The
service
members
had
only
a
week
left
in
Iraq.
Jared
Landaker,
a
Big
Bear
City
native
a
University
of
La
Verne
graduate,
was
buried
at
Riverside
National
Cemetery
about
two
weeks
later,
according
to
the
Seven
Stars
Foundation ,
which
was
founded
by
his
family
to
honor
him
and
the
other
crew
members.
At
the
cemetery
on
Feb.
7,
as
Jared
Landaker&#8217;s
friends
and
family
were
upset,
seeing
the
gravesites
so
disturbed
by
workers.
&#8220;It
was
hard,&#8221;
childhood
friend
Stacie
Hernandez
said.
&#8220;It
was
already
an
emotional
day,
but
to
encounter
that
at
the
same
time,
it
was
very
hard
for
all
of
us.&#8221;
The
construction
work
was
part
of
a
multiyear
renovation
meant
to
beautify
the
site,
a
cemetery
administrator
told
the
San
Bernardino
Sun .
The
project
was
expected
to
be
finished
by
Memorial
Day.
The
Landakers
said
that
family
members
should
be
notified
about
the
work
so
they&#8217;re
not
shocked
when
they
arrive
to
visit
loved
ones&#8217;
graves.
But
the
administrator
said
that
with
more
200,000
buried
there,
it&#8217;s
not
feasible
for
families
to
be
informed,
the
Sun
reported.
The
family
has
called
for
change,
asking
their
Congressman,
Rep.
Paul
Cook
for
help.
Cook,
a
Republican,
said
the
family
sent
him
&#8220;very,
very
graphic&#8221;
photos.
Cook
and
Rep.
Mark
Takano,
a
Democrat
whose
district
includes
Riverside,
has
asked
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
for
a
&#8220;dignity
clause&#8221;
for
all
national
cemeteries
&#8212;
a
way
for
cemetery
administrators
to
be
held
accountable.
&#8220;That
is
one
of
the
main
responsibilities
of
the
administrator.
You
can&#8217;t
just
pass
it
off
to
the
contractor
and
say
go
ahead
and
do
what
you
want
to
do
and
not
pay
attention
to
that
very,
very
special
thing,&#8221;
Cook
said.
His
office
did
not
immediately
return
a
request
for
more
information
on
Monday.
The
Landaker
has
a
&#8220;huge
sense
of
relief&#8221;
knowing
others
may
never
have
to
go
through
what
they
went
through,
Hernandez
said.
For
her
part,
Laura
Landaker
said
that
as
she
sat
by
her
son&#8217;s
grave
after
others
left
on
Feb.
7,
he
spoke
to
her.
&#8220;I
bet
you
would
not
expect
to
see
my
resting
place
in
this
condition
today,&#8221;
Landaker
wrote ,
explaining
what
she
heard
from
her
son.
&#8220;But
there
is
a
reason
you
were
meant
to
see
it
today
more
than
any
other
day
&#8230;
You
and
I
are
closing
the
door
on
the
last
seven
years
of
pain,
being
lost,
and
feeling
so
vulnerable
and
starting
on
a
new
journey
together.
You
stand
here
a
stronger,
more
confident
woman,
one
I
knew
was
always
there.
All
the
pain
and
joys
of
the
last
seven
years
are
your
foundation
to
the
next
seven
years.&#8221;
