National
FFA Week Highlights the Importance of
Agricultural Education
Dear
Friend,
This past week, I spent time traveling
throughout our district, with a particular
focus on visiting schools to talk with
young people about the importance of
becoming informed citizens. The decisions
made in Washington will have a profound
impact on their lives, and I enjoyed the
opportunity to hear from these students
about issues of importance to them. I
visited students in government classes in
Albemarle and Forest, and I had the
opportunity to meet with Future Farmers of
America (FFA) chapters in Appomattox,
Campbell, and Nelson Counties, as this past
week was National FFA Week. National FFA
Week began in 1947 and is celebrated each
year in conjunction with George
Washingtons birthday in recognition
of his legacy as a farmer.
FFA clubs are critical to preserving and
maintaining the long and rich history of
agriculture both in Virginia and across the
country, as their mission is to promote
agricultural education among young people
the next generation of farmers. FFA
chapters use a hands-on approach to getting
students interested and involved in
agriculture. Their members then share with
other students and members of their
communities about farming, ranching, and
forestry, inspiring others to learn more
about these vital industries.
Our nation owes much of its prosperity
to its deeply rooted history of
agriculture, and we continue to rely
heavily on its significant contributions to
our economy and our country. Agriculture
and forestry represents the largest segment
of Virginias economy, accounting for
nearly $80 billion in annual economic
output according to the Virginia Farm
Bureau.
Preserving and growing our great legacy
of family farming in Virginia is one of my
top priorities. When I talk to farmers
across our district, it remains clear that
the federal government is often out of
touch with the needs of our family farmers
and small agribusinesses. Agricultural
producers are substantially impacted by the
tax, energy, and regulatory policies
promulgated in Washington. That is why I
have promoted policies that make it easier
for family farms to succeed, such as my
bipartisan bill, the Preserving Rural
Resources Act, which seeks to ease
regulatory burdens that negatively impact
farmers.
Agriculture is the backbone of our
economy in Virginia, and it is vital that
we advance policies that support, not hurt,
our family farmers. I commend the FFA and
its members in our communities for
advancing agricultural education so that
the industry can grow and prosper in the
hands of our future generations.
