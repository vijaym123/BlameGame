David --
We&rsquo;re up against a whole lot more than ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling this election.
We&rsquo;re up against his big money backers -- backers determined to block any chance for the middle class to succeed. David, with a brand new poll showing our race in single-digits,
we need a surge of grassroots support to stop them.
Will you pitch in to our Middle Class Action Fund by midnight tomorrow to help shift the balance of power in Congress back to real people?
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
After tomorrow's deadline, we&rsquo;ll have a record of the dedicated supporters who stepped up and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to stop rigging the game and put the middle class first.&rdquo;
Don&rsquo;t miss out, David -- please chip in right now: http://action.cheribustos.com/Founding-Member
