Dear Friends,
There is an informative report on the Benghazi investigation currently featured in the Weekly Standard. Click here to read the report .
An excerpt follows:
After a long day on November 13, 2013, Speaker of the House John Boehner walked down the marble hallways of the Longworth House Office Building to the personal office of Representative Devin Nunes...But Boehner's visit was not a social call. He was there to see three CIA officers who had fought in Benghazi, Libya. Their identities were unknown to all but a small group of U.S. government officials with high-level security clearances, and the details of their harrowing stories were unknown to virtually everyone who was not a colleague or relative.
Thanks for your interest.
Sincerely,
[Description: image003 (3).jpg]
Devin Nunes
MEMBER OF CONGRESS
