Dear Friend,
There isn&rsquo;t much time to spare, so I&rsquo;ll be brief: I&rsquo;m writing to ask for your help in reaching our $25,OOO goal before Election Day -- can you chip in $5?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Your contributions will help us turn out Democratic voters for candidates up and down the ballot. If you can help, I&rsquo;d appreciate it.
Thank you.
Ed
