Friend -- We&rsquo;re sorry to absolutely FLOOD your inbox.
It&rsquo;s because the next 48 hours are critically important.
Please read this email start to finish:
The Koch brothers are already gearing up their right-wing money machine. Their hand-picked, extremist candidates will be flush with cash -- and it could rob us of our White House and Senate chances.
But this is absolutely JAW-DROPPING:
39,012 Democrats have already renewed their memberships!! If we can get to 50,000 gifts before the FEC deadline in just 48 hours, we&rsquo;ll stand toe-to-toe with the Republicans.
ALL GIFTS MATCHED: Will you pitch in to renew your DSCC membership before the FEC deadline in 48 hours?

The first three weeks of a Republican Congress have been a TRAIN WRECK:
While the Senate tried to slash Social Security AND abortion rights,
Speaker Boehner and the House are gearing up for yet ANOTHER wasteful lawsuit against President Obama.
That&rsquo;s why you need to answer the Republicans&rsquo; ultra-conservative billionaire financiers immediately! We NEED to hold the GOP accountable. Everyone is watching right now to see if we can raise enough before the first FEC deadline of the year in 48 hours.
Will you pitch in before the FEC deadline in 48 hours? Your gift will be matched, meaning it will have an even bigger impact!
