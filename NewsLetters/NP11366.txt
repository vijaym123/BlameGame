Welcoming a Manufacturing Expert from Windham
Hi Everyone!
I hope you all had a terrific weekend.
I spent last week pushing for
veteran-owned small businesses and fighting for Granite State workers.
With Shirley in the Small Business Committee
The Manufacturing Renaissance: "Reshoring" Middle Class Jobs in America
On Thursday, I had the pleasure of introducing Windham resident Shirley
Mills at a Small Business Subcommittee hearing, where Mills testified
on the importance of American-made manufacturing.
Shirley is a
business analyst at the Boston Company who has done extensive research
on how American-made manufacturing can strengthen our economy.
During
her testimony, she highlighted companies' efforts to bring
manufacturing jobs back from overseas, a practice commonly referred to
as "reshoring."
She argued that bringing these jobs back home is not
only a smart financial move for American companies, but it will also
support badly needed job creation across the United States.
By supporting New Hampshire companies that are bringing jobs home from
overseas, we can continue to grow our manufacturing sector and create
good, middle class jobs for years to come.
At Thursday's hearing, I
was thrilled to introduce Ms. Mills, whose clear research demonstrates
how American-made manufacturing can strengthen New Hampshire businesses
and improve America's economy overall.
Ms. Mills highlighted how the "clustering" of industrial infrastructure
can encourage manufacturers to bring jobs back to the United States.
In an effort to support clustering and improve the competitiveness of
American manufacturing, I am a cosponsor of the Revitalize American
Manufacturing and Innovation Act, bipartisan legislation to authorize a
network of centers of manufacturing innovation.
Speaking at the Agriculture Committee Hearing
Celebrating Agriculture in New Hampshire
On Thursday, the House Committee on Agriculture unanimously passed H.
Con. Res. 86, a resolution celebrating the centennial of the founding
of the Cooperative Extension System.
The Cooperative Extension System
was established by the Smith-Lever Act of 1914 in order to bring the
expertise of land-grant universities out to rural farmers in their own
communities.
In New Hampshire, the Cooperative Extension is
administered by the University of New Hampshire, and provides field
specialists to all 10 New Hampshire counties.
I was proud to join Republicans and Democrats on the Agriculture
Committee to pass a resolution celebrating the 100th anniversary of
this great program, which ensures that our farmers and rural
communities have access to locally-tailored, practical information from
land-grant universities.
The on-the-ground expertise provided by
Cooperative Extension specialists is instrumental in helping our local
farmers succeed, and I am committed to supporting this program.
Pushing for NH Veterans
At a Veterans' Affairs Hearing on Thursday, I followed up on my recent
conversation with VA Secretary Eric Shinseki and asked him about how
the VA plans to meet the growing need for mental health and other
services for survivors of sexual assault in the military.
The hearing
addressed the Department of Veterans Affairs budget request for fiscal
year 2015, with emphasis on access to mental health care. Sexual
assault continues to plague our military and leave lasting wounds on
many of the brave men and women who serve our country.
Last year, I
was proud to partner with Congresswoman Jackie Walorski (IN-02) to pass
improved protections for individuals who blow the whistle on these
crimes.
I also followed up on my earlier discussion with Secretary Shinseki on
procurement wait times at the National Acquisition Center (NAC) and the
huge delays in procuring high-tech medical imaging devices.
I recently
sent him a letter regarding Gamma Medica, a medical device company in
Salem, NH that produces bone density imaging devices that help with the
early detection of breast cancer.
Many VA health facilities in the New
England region have requested this life saving device but because of
over 2-year long delays at the NAC many veterans seeking early breast
cancer detection are not receiving the treatment they need.
Helping Granite Staters
In January, I was contacted by a constituent about an issue with the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
Helen Brody is the President of New
Hampshire Farms Network, an organization devoted to connecting small
farms across the Granite State with one another in order to share
information and expertise.
Helen had encountered delays in NH Farms
Network's application for 501(c)(3) tax exempt status and requested
help from my office in expediting the process.
My staff was able to
work with Helen and the IRS to resolve the issue and in the first week
of March, the request was approved!
If my office may ever be of
assistance with a problem you are facing, please contact my staff at
603-226-1002 so we may help you resolve your problem or get you the
information you need.
Have a fantastic week and thanks for everything you do to make New
Hampshire such a great place to live!

Welcoming
a
Manufacturing
Expert
from
Windham
Hi
Everyone!
I
hope
you
all
had
a
terrific
weekend.
I
spent
last
week
pushing
for
veteran-owned
small
businesses
and
fighting
for
Granite
State
workers.
With
Shirley
in
the
Small

Middle

America
On
Thursday,
I
had
the
pleasure
of
introducing
Windham
resident
Shirley
Mills
at
a Small
Business
Subcommittee
hearing,
where
Mills
testified

only
a
smart
financial
move
for
American
companies,
but
it
will
also

across
the
United

By
supporting
New

companies
that
are
bringing
jobs
home
from
overseas,
we
can
continue
to
grow
our
manufacturing
sector
and
create
good,
middle
class
jobs
for
years
to
come.
At
Thursday&#8217;s
hearing,
I
was
thrilled
to
introduce
Ms.

demonstrates
