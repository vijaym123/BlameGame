Ann's Weekly Roundup
Dear Friend,
Time and time again - President Obama promised the American people that
'if you like your health care plan, you can keep it.' We now know this
was a blatant falsehood in order to win an election, and the victims
are the millions of Americans who have lost their health care coverage
due to Obamacare through no fault of their own.
On Thursday, President Obama announced that he was going to make
"administrative" changes that would attempt to allow individuals to
keep their health plan.
Yet by his own admission, it will not do
enough to fulfill the campaign promise he repeatedly made.
This
announcement came after the fact that only 751 Missourians have been
able to sign up for ObamaCare, while over 800,000 Missourians remain
uninsured.
What the President fails to realize is that no matter how
many unconstitutional administrative fixes he plans to offer, there is
no Band-Aid big enough to stop ObamaCare from destroying our economy,
lowering the quality of our care, increasing costs, and putting the
Federal Government between you and your doctor.
While the Administration claims this is just a minor setback, these
absurdly low enrollment numbers are emblematic of a much larger
problem:
ObamaCare is unworkable, unsustainable, and unaffordable for
the American people.
It is time we realize that no matter how many
tech experts and phony administrative "fixes" the President makes - it
will never stop ObamaCare from hurting the American people.
U.S. Posts Low Number of Health Care Signups
Every day I hear from hardworking families around the 2nd District who
have had their health insurance changed or cancelled, been forced to
change their doctors, had their hours cut back at work, and have seen
their premiums skyrocket. These hardworking families don't care about
partisan politics; they are simply concerned about how they are going
to make it to the 15th and 30th each month and pay their bills on time.
In recent weeks, I've received far too many heartbreaking stories from
the people of Missouri's 2nd District about how government-run
healthcare is impacting their lives.
That is why I took to the floor
to put a face on the victims of ObamaCare and tell their stories.
As your Representative, I will never stop fighting for the people of
Missouri's 2nd District until ObamaCare is replaced with free-market
based solutions that expand access without destroying our economy and
lowering the quality of our care.
Sincerely,
Ann Wagner
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
Time
and
time

-
President
Obama
promised
the
American
people
that
&#8216;if
you
like
your
health
care
plan,
you
can
keep
it.&#8217; We
now
know
this
was
a

and
the
victims
are
the
millions

Americans
who
have
lost
their
health

due
to
Obamacare

no

On
Thursday,
President
Obama
announced
that
he
was
going
to
make
&#8220;administrative&#8221;
changes
that
would
attempt
to
allow
individuals
to
keep
their
health
plan.
Yet
by
his
own
admission,
it
will
not
do
enough
to
fulfill
the
campaign
promise
he
repeatedly
made.
This
announcement
came
after
the
fact
that
only
751
Missourians
have
been
able
to
sign
up
for
ObamaCare,
while
over
800,000
Missourians
remain

What
the
