Dear David,
As the 114th Congress convenes
today, I was proud to reintroduce an important bill to ensure America's
veterans and their families have every opportunity to
succeed.
The
"Hire More Heroes Act"
- which
was also reintroduced in the House today - encourages businesses to hire
more American veterans, while giving job creators critical relief
from the burdensome ObamaCare employer mandate.
Our
military heroes who have selflessly served to protect America deserve a
chance to find good-paying jobs when they come home. As a member of
the bipartisan Congressional Veterans Job Caucus, I'll keep fighting to
pass the "Hire More Heroes Act" and other important bills to create
more opportunity for our veterans and all Americans.
As
always, I invite you to join the conversation online by sharing your
thoughts with me on
Facebook , on
Instagram , by using the hashtag #HireMoreHeroes on
Twitter , and by subscribing to my
YouTube
channel.
Sincere regards,
Washington D.C.
