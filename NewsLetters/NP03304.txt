Another Term as a Natural Resources
Leader
1/15/15
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn has been named as
the Chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee's Subcommittee
on Energy and Mineral Resources. He has also been named to serve on
the Oversight and Investigations
Subcommittee.
It is a tremendous honor to once again be
entrusted to serve as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral
Resources. Overseeing energy production on federal lands, both onshore
and off, is an extremely important responsibility that I take very
seriously. I will continue to be a strong voice leading my subcommittee
toward an all-of-the-above energy approach designed to expand our
energy independence and create an environment for new American jobs. I am
also pleased to be appointed to serve on the new Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations where I can continue to rein in this out of
control Administration and prevent government waste, fraud and
abuse.
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
(CO-05)
