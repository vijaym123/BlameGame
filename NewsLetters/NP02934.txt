Wanted to provide you with a brief bill spotlight on H.R. 527,
the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act of 2015,
which is a positive piece of legislation for our small business community and the economy as a whole. The text of the legislation is available
here , and below is a brief summary:
What it does:
H.R. 527 requires federal agencies to consider the economic effects of regulations on small businesses before imposing overly burdensome mandates that prevent growth and job creation.
More detailed analysis will be required before implementing regulations, including describing the projected reporting, recordkeeping, and other compliance requirements with which the proposed regulation will burden small businesses; as well as reporting on the number of regulations, which may duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the proposed rule; and estimating the cumulative economic impact of the proposed rule on small businesses, among other things.
Why its important:
Requiring this level of analysis before imposing new regulations on our small businesses will help prevent unnecessary, duplicative, or overly burdensome mandates from being placed on the backs of our job creators. We will only be able to light up our economy and spur growth when our small businesses are free to expand, innovate, and add new jobs.
Im pleased that the House passed H.R. 527 today, with my support, and its now heading to the Senate for consideration.
Yours in service,
Randy
