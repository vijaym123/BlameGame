CONSTITUENT SERVICES
VISITING DC
May 02, 2014
Earlier this week, I introduced the No Bonuses for
Tax Cheats Act with Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia.
This
legislation is in response to the news that
the IRS
awarded $2.8 million in bonuses
to employees who participated in
illegal behavior -- including fraud, drug use, and failing to pay their
taxes.
The No Bonuses for Tax Cheats Act would bar the IRS
from paying out bonuses to bureaucrats who are delinquent on their taxes
or were found to have engaged in misconduct.
Government
employees who choose not to follow the law they are entrusted to enforce
are a threat to the integrity and mission of the IRS, and they should
not be sheltered or rewarded in any way.
It is my hope that the
Senate will swiftly adopt this commonsense, bipartisan piece of
legislation so that misconduct is no longer rewarded at taxpayer expense.

On Wednesday,
Senator Begich,
Senator Sanders, and I introduced bipartisan
legislation to increase benefits to veterans to keep up with the cost of
living.
Our nations veterans selflessly gave themselves to defend
our freedoms, and it is our responsibility to ensure that we provide
them with the benefits and services they need and deserve.
The
bill would make a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) available to veterans
at the same level as the increase provided to Social Security
beneficiaries -- this is one way we can help make sure we are keeping true to
our promise to our nations veterans and their families.

The Senate voted on the Democrats
40 percent minimum wage hike this week.
After
Wednesdays release of first quarter GDP numbers , it should be
plenty obvious why it is reckless for Senate Democrats to continue to
pursue job-killing policies.
A study by the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office showed that the Democrats minimum wage
hike
would result in the loss of 1 million American jobs and increase the cost
of goods and services for families all across our nation. Its time
to get people back to work, not killing jobs with bad
policies.
The Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs held a hearing on
Overmedication: Problems and Solutions.
You can watch the full
hearing

or read my opening statement
here .
I did not have a chance to share this at
this weeks hearing but I would just like to express my frustration and
deepest concerns regarding the serious allegations that have been made
about the VAs Phoenix Healthcare System.
It is extremely
critical that the Department take these allegations seriously and that the
Office of Inspector General conducts a thorough investigation of any
departmental wrongdoing or delays that cost veterans their lives.
I will continue to insist on information on the progress of these
investigations and the steps that must be taken to ensure this does not
happen again.
The Senate may have been in recess last week,
but it was busy in the state. To see my full public schedule, you can

Concerned Veterans
for America invited me to join them for their Defend &amp; Reform series
in Raleigh last Wednesday.
Our panel included Stephen Hayes

Division of Veterans Affairs, Darin Selnick, Advisor for Concerned

Veterans Affairs and making sure that our nations veterans are receiving
the care they deserve.

Bill LuMaye and I sat down in-studio last

Keystone XL, and Ukraine.

the pleasure of visiting Athens Drive High School and meeting the
schools bright young men and women.

Thursday of last week, I joined
U.S. Global Leadership Coalition in Charlotte as their keynote speaker.
