Dear David,
Recently, President Obama asked Congress for $3.7 billion in
emergency funding to deal with the increase in unaccompanied children coming
to the United States from Central America. Roughly half of the funds
would pay for food, housing, and medical care for the children while
they await formal legal proceedings before a federal immigration judge.
The remaining portion would provide for increased border enforcement,
transportation, immigration court costs, and State Department
programs to address the root causes of the influx of children. The President
has also requested $615 million for wildfire suppression
activities.
Please take this brief survey to express whether you support
this measure. It is with your input that I can best advocate for
Ventura County in Congress.
I am honored to serve
you.
Sincerely,
JULIA
BROWNLEY
Member of Congress
