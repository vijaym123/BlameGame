Rep. Bob Goodlatte
Secret Service Response a 'Comedy of Errors'
Everything that could go wrong did according to the Department of Homeland Security's review of the
mid-September security breach at the White House when Omar Gonzalez scaled the north fence and ran through the unlocked doors of the White House. This
report confirms that fundamental reform is needed to improve both the security of the White House grounds and staff training.
Inadequate training,
poor communication, and lax physical security at the White House led to this breach. The Secret Service's mission is critically important, and we must
ensure that the Secret Service has all of the tools, training, and resources necessary to protect the President, White House personnel, and the
historic grounds.

This review underscores the need for a thorough analysis of the
agency&rsquo;s protective
mission and makes next week&rsquo;s House Judiciary
Committee oversight hearing on the Secret Service even more critical. I
am anxious to
get to
the bottom of these problems at the agency so that we prevent
such security lapses from happening again in the future.

Time to Build Keystone XL
You&rsquo;ve probably heard the old phrase, &ldquo;good things come to those who
wait.&rdquo; Well, the American people have been waiting over six years for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s
long enough, wouldn&rsquo;t you?
With Congress back in session, the
House of Representatives kicked things off this week by considering legislation to approve the long-awaited Keystone XL pipeline. H.R. 5682 passed the
House by a strong vote of 252 to 161. Unfortunately, this is not the first time the House has acted on legislation to unlock North American energy
sources and make the Keystone XL pipeline a reality. Despite the support of a majority of Americans, the White House continues to block construction.
Even though this bill passed the House with bipartisan support and the Senate is expected to take up similar legislation in the coming days, the
President has said that his position on Keystone has not changed, and White House officials have indicated that he would likely veto this bill. How
much longer will American jobs and energy security have to wait?
There
are numerous issues that Congress must address before the end of the year and many opportunities for both parties to work together. Keystone XL is a
good starting point. The American people have been waiting for this common sense energy solution. It&rsquo;s time for Congress and the White House to
listen and work together on behalf of the American people.

I enjoyed several great visits around the Sixth District when I was not in
Washington for votes this week. This includes a stop at Signal Knob Middle School in Shenandoah County to congratulate Virginia's Teacher of the Year,
Jaclyn Roller Ryan; attend the re-dedication of the Argonne Circle WWI Memorial in Roanoke; and, tour FreightCar America's Roanoke facility.
