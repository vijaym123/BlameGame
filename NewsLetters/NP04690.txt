Photo of the Week:
It is such an
honor to represent so many veterans from North Carolina's Second
District in the United States
Congress.
This week was certainly an exciting one. Im really looking
forward to working with the newly-elected Senate, as it will mean
reduced taxes, less spending, more jobs, and long-awaited energy
independence. Americans are looking for a change of pace in the way our
government functions, and they made that very clear
Tuesday
night. Now that the American people
have spoken, both chambers will work diligently to make the peoples
priorities our own.
This
Tuesday
is Veterans Day, and I hope each of you will take a moment to
thank a veteran for their service. We are so fortunate to live in a
country where freedom has been guaranteed by the sacrifice of brave men
and women who served in our nations armed forces. I had a staff member
attend an Annual Raleigh Heroes Luncheon this past week, where we
had the opportunity to thank many of these everyday heroes. I hope
everyone will check out the photos below.
It is an absolute honor to be your voice in
Washington, and I want to thank you for placing your trust and
confidence in me. I truly believe our best days are ahead of us, and I look
forward to returning to Washington this week to hit the ground
running.
Across the District:
A member of my staff attended the Annual Raleigh Heroes Lunch on the
WakeMed Raleigh Campus, where attendees had the opportunity to hear
from Gen. (US. Ret.) Dan McNeill, former Commander of the Coalition
Forces in Afghanistan.
A member of my staff
participated in the Harnett County Veterans and Community Stand Down
this week. This great event helps veterans, active duty military and
their families who need assistance in dealing with federal agencies.
We are so grateful for the people who participated in the
clothing drive held during the Harnett County Veterans Stand
Down.
A member of my staff joined
stakeholders at N.C. State's Hunt Library for N.C. Research and
Education Network Community Day. This event was used to plan our statewide
network, bandwith and discuss other technology issues.
Video of the
Week:
In my interview with Mid-Point on Newsmax TV, I
talked about the House GOP plan of action for Congress to hit the ground
running when we return to Washington. It is imperative that we
continue our work on the issues that the American people have told us they
want addressed.
