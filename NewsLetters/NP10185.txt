Dear Friends,
Today, nearly 20 months after the terrorist attack on our special
mission in Benghazi on September 11, 2012 Speaker Boehner announced the
house will vote on establishing a Select Committee on Benghazi.
Congress must continue to investigate what happened in Libya
leading up to the attack and in the aftermath. Tragically, we still do
not have answers as to how it could have happened, what exactly
occurred in the critical response hours, and why the White House was so
quick to blame the attack on a video. We owe it to the victims, their
families and the American people to find out the truth. We must have
justice, and we must have accountability. It is my hope a Select
Committee will produce both.
This week the Homeland Security Committee unanimously passed
legislation I introduced along with Congressman Pat Meehan, H.R. 4007,
the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) Authorization
and Accountability Act.
Following the tragic explosion in
West, Texas the committee became aware that several chemical plants
throughout the country were "off the grid" and potential targets for
terrorists. This bill ensures first responders are properly trained to
deal with emergency incidents, including terrorist attacks, at chemical
facilities. It is my hope that this bill will provide piece of mind to
those who work at these facilities or live in towns where they are
located that the facilities are secure.
The House of Representatives passed, and I supported, t
he
Military Construction/Veterans Affairs (MilConVA) funding bill
. Our
nation's veterans served America with honor; this legislation will help
our nation keep its promise to care for our veterans once their service
has ended. The bill includes $45 billion in support of medical
treatment for veterans, including traumatic brain injuries, suicide
prevention, mental health, homeless support, rural health initiatives
and funding to help end the backlog. The legislation also included
language I introduced to ban any new facility, highway, or other
project that receives federal funding from being named after a sitting
member of Congress.
The National Taxpayer Union, a non-partisan advocate for taxpayers,
endorsed my amendment
to
the Legislative Branch funding bill that Congress passed this week. My
amendment, which passed, institutes important reforms in the
Congressional printing process that would reduce unnecessary spending
on printing government products as we live in an increasingly digital
world.
I also met with the Israeli Ambassador this week to discuss our
bilateral relationship, Israel's security and the Iranian nuclear
threat. It was a productive and informative conversation ahead of my
trip to the region later this month. The picture to the right is of me
and the Ambassador in my office following our meeting.

Dear

Today,
