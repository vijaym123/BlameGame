The wall is making a special stop in Hattiesburg for the purpose of Vietnam veteran Bonds medal ceremony, and will only be available for viewing during the hour listed above.
The public and all local veterans are invited to attend. The Traveling Memorial is a 3/5 scale replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC. It travels throughout the country to allow people the opportunity to visit the Memorial who otherwise may not be able to make the trip to Washington. It stands six feet tall and stretches almost 300 feet from end to end.
