Friend -- I&rsquo;m emailing for the third time in three days.
It&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re at a critical moment. I REALLY need EVERY SINGLE COMMITTED DEMOCRAT to STOP -- and read this:
Six races will decide control of the Senate&hellip; and they&rsquo;re all tied.
Republicans only need to win three to take control.
Those are 50-50 odds -- much too close!
I&rsquo;m not about to let us lose in the last 12 days. Are you?
Our voter turnout operation can rip away the Senate from the GOP -- but only if we can fund it fully.
So I need to you step up:
Help us get the vote out -- it&rsquo;s the only way we&rsquo;ll win, and time is running out! Pitch in before midnight and we&rsquo;ll MATCH it.
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
Mark my words:
If we can fully fund our aggressive, one-of-a-kind voter turnout program, the Republicans don&rsquo;t stand a chance.
And you can do it! But we need the funds to call every voter and canvass every neighborhood.
Karl Rove and the Koch brothers will be devastated when we tear victory away from them in the final moment of this election.
Remember, we can do it -- but there are only 12 days until the election! Please give TODAY. Your donation will go further if you give sooner!
Thank you,
Harry Reid
Senate Majority Leader
