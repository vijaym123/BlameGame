Dear
F riends,
The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) announced last week a special enrollment period for individuals and families who did not have health coverage in 2014 and are subject to the fee or &#8220;shared responsibility payment&#8221; when
they file their 2014 taxes in states that use the federally facilitated marketplaces.
This special enrollment period will allow those individuals and families who were unaware or didn&#8217;t understand the implications of this new requirement to enroll in 2015 health insurance coverage through the marketplace exchanges.
For those who were unaware or didn&#8217;t understand the implications of the fee for not enrolling in coverage, CMS will provide consumers with an opportunity to purchase health insurance coverage from
March 15 to April 30 .
If consumers do not purchase coverage for 2015 during this special enrollment period, they may have to pay a fee when they file their 2015 income taxes.
Those eligible for this special enrollment period live in states with a federally facilitated marketplace (including Georgia) and:
n
Currently are not enrolled in coverage through the FFM for 2015,
n
Attest that when they filed their 2014 tax return they paid the fee for not having health coverage in 2014, and
n
Attest that they first became aware of, or understood the implications of, the Shared Responsibility Payment after the end of open enrollment (February 15, 2015) in connection with preparing their 2014 taxes.
The special enrollment period announced last week will begin on March 15, 2015, and end at 11:59 p.m. EST on April 30, 2015.
If a consumer enrolls in coverage before the 15th of the month, coverage will be effective on the first day of
the following month.
This year&#8217;s tax season is the first time individuals and families will be asked to provide basic information regarding their health coverage on their tax returns. Individuals who could not afford coverage or met other conditions may be
eligible to receive an exemption for 2014. To help consumers who did not have insurance last year determine if they qualify for an exemption, CMS also launched a health coverage tax exemption tool on HealthCare.gov and CuidadodeSalud.gov.
If you have questions about your taxes, need to download forms, or want to learn more about the fee for not having insurance, you can find information and resources at
www.HealthCare.gov/Taxes
or
www.IRS.gov .
Constituents can also call the Marketplace Call Center at 1-800-318-2596. Consumers who need assistance filing their taxes can visit IRS.gov/VITA or IRS.gov/freefile.
Consumers seeking to take advantage of the special enrollment period can find out if they are eligible by visiting
https://www.healthcare.gov/get-coverage . Consumers can find local help at: Localhelp.healthcare.gov. TTY users should call 1-855-889-4325. Assistance is available in 150 languages. The call is free.
