Shared Concerns of Local Veterans with House Committee
I submitted testimony for a House Armed Services Committee hearing that included
concerns brought to my attention by Veterans and active duty servicemembers from Central Florida .
Fighting for Middle Class Families
I voted to repeal Obamacares 30-hour rule which states that employers must provide health insurance for those working 30 hours or more per week. There are employers who can afford to pay their employees to work more hours but cannot financially afford to provide health insurance for them. Obamacares "30-hour rule" forces these employers to cut back the number of hours an employee may work, therefore decreasing an employees take-home pay.
Obamacare has made it so that now, instead of not having health insurance, these employees dont have health insurance and make less money . Its not often that I agree with Teamsters President James Hoffa, but we are in agreement on this. He said that the rule will "destroy the foundation of the 40-hour work week that is the backbone of the American middle class." The last thing the government should be doing is encouraging employers to decrease their employees incomes.
Protecting Consumers' Ability to Save for the Future
39 of our colleagues joined Rep. Delaney and I in urging Secretary Lew to be careful when it comes to potentially (and incorrectly) changing the classification of asset management companies.
If they are incorrectly classified, it could hinder Floridians ability to invest their money and save for the future with the help of an asset manager .
