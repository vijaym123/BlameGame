Fellow Illinoisans:
I am happy to announce that Ive launched a
new and improved
website.
It is more user-friendly so you can view it on
your cell phone or tablet and expands the services
available to people across the state of Illinois.
I want to know how I can help you. Whether you need help
with Social Security, are a veteran looking for support, or
need assistance with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration
Services, the
Federal
Agency Assistance page
is the place for you.
Representing this great state is an honor and a
privilege. I want to keep you informed about what issues
Im working on, what bills Im sponsoring, and
how Im voting on the Senate Floor. Visit the
Issues
page
for more information.
Do you want to watch video from the Senate Floor, see
whos stopping by my office for meetings or keep up
with the latest Congressional news? Visit the
Newsroom
page
to find out what my press office is up to.
This new website should serve as a one stop shop for
your needs. I encourage all Illinoisans visit it and let me
know what I can do to continue to serve your interests on
behalf of our great state.
Sincerely,
Dick Durbin
United States Senator
