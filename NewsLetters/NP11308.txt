Rep. Kinzinger's efforts to reduce veteran unemployment and get
returning veterans back to work. Kinzinger's bill, the Veteran Emergency
Medical Technician Support Act (H.R. 235), streamlines the certification

and passed the House of Representatives unanimously on February 12,
2013. It currently awaits action by the

House passes legislation to reign in executive branch
abuse
This week, the House of Representatives voted on two
bills to reign in the executive branch and restore the proper balance of
power enshrined in the Constitution. The legislation, the Faithful
Execution of the Law Act (H.R. 3973) and the ENFORCE the Law Act (H.R.
4138), promotes transparency and honesty in government and restores
balance to our government by:
requiring all federal
officials who decide to refrain from enforcing a federal law to report to
Congress on the reason for the non-enforcement
and,
putting in place a procedure permitting Congress to authorize an expedited
lawsuit against the executive branch for failure to faithfully execute
the law.
Since President Obama took office, the House
has documented over 50 instances when the executive branch decided to
refrain from enforcing federal law or unilaterally changed the law
without Congress consent, on issues such as immigration enforcement and
health care to domestic energy policy and education standards. For
the full report on executive branch abuse and to become a citizen
cosponsor of H.R. 3973 and H.R. 4138, click
