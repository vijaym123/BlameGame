David Johnson
TODAY: All Gifts TRIPLE-MATCHED
This week, President Obama asked for your help.
And now, a group of Democratic supporters has agreed to TRIPLE-MATCH ALL GIFTS.
FIRST:
The
New York Times
released a poll showing Democrats
LOSING
the race for Congress.
&ldquo;A deeply unpopular Republican Party is nonetheless
gaining strength
heading into the midterms&hellip;.&rdquo;
- - NY Times, Tuesday
THEN:
NPR reported that a single right-wing donor gave
$1O,OOO,OOO.OO
to Rove&rsquo;s group.
&ldquo;Republican Party leaders are urging big donors to start writing checks&hellip;&rdquo;
-- NPR, Thursday
Bottom line is that right-wing megadonors are purchasing Republicans an advantage in this election -- despite their widely hated policies. David, there&rsquo;s still time to turn this around before Election Day -- but our window of opportunity is narrowing.
