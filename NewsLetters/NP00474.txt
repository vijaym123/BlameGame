Dear David,
Here are a few highlights from May:
1.
Completed my second Missouri County
tour.
I recently
completed
my second tour of our state since being sworn into the
U.S. Senate. I've
learned
a great deal by hearing
about the issues that matter most to Missourians in every corner of
our state. Click the links for more photos from my #MOCountyTour on
Twitter ,
Facebook ,
and
Instagram .
2.
Delivered the
commencement address at my alma mater.
It was an honor to
deliver
the commencement address to the 2015 graduates of my
alma mater, Southwest Baptist University in Bolivar - where I spent
four great years as president. Good luck to all of this year's graduates.

3.
Took questions from students from across Missouri on
Skype.
When votes and work kept me in Washington, I enjoyed talking with bright
students on Skype from
Edgar Road Elementary
School
in Webster Groves,
Exeter Junior High
School ,
Ozark High School ,
Hazelwood
North Middle School
in Florissant, and
Truman
Scholars
during their orientation at William Jewell College in
Liberty.
4.
Heard from veterans in
Ava.
Heard
from veterans in Ava at the American Legion Post 112
about the important issues facing veterans in our state.
5.
Introduced the "Affordable Reliable Energy Now Act" with my
colleagues.
Bad energy policies hit middle and low-income families
the hardest. I
joined
Senator Shelley Moore
Capito as an original co-sponsor of the bipartisan "Affordable Reliable
Energy Now Act (ARENA)" to protect workers and families from the Obama
Administration's burdensome energy regulations.

at a press conference introducing the
bill.
6.
Traveled to Ozark County to meet with
educators.
Met
with Ozark County educators and
members of the community at Gainesville High School to hear about education
issues they're facing.
7.
One of my favorite
stops: Porter's Cafe.
Always have to stop by
Porter's
Cafe
whenever I'm near Squires for Theta Porter's famous rhubarb
pie.
As always, I invite you to join the conversation online
by sharing your thoughts with me on
Facebook ,

Instagram , and by

Sincere regards,
