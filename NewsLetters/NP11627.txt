Dear Friend,
With April 15 right around the corner, folks all across Georgia are getting ready to file their federal and state tax returns.
There is no question that filing your taxes can be difficult, and I wanted to take a minute to let you know about a few resources that could help you save some time and money.
First, this month I will be holding two tax clinics for folks in the 12 th
District.
We will have tax experts on hand to help answer questions, review returns, and give advice on the most efficient way to file.
These events are free and open to the public and no appointment is necessary.
I encourage anyone with questions to stop by one of the following locations:
Tuesday, March 18
10:00 a.m. - 3:00 p.m.
30901 Development Corporation
1446 Lee Beard Way
Augusta, GA
Thursday, March 20
9:00 a.m. - 3:00 p.m.
Statesboro Bulloch Library
124 South Main Street
Statesboro, GA
If you arent able to make it out to one of these events, here are a few other resources that could be helpful.
