-- Boehner&rsquo;s Super PAC launched a MASSIVE ad blitz against Brad
TODAY.
-- and now, another outside group has dumped $100,000.00 on Chicago T.V. to defeat Brad. It&rsquo;s a potentially devastating combo of bad news:
in fact, Republican spending in Illinois&rsquo;s 10th district just passed a staggering $6 MILLION.
But there&rsquo;s good news too: at 10:52 pm last night, we received a $25 donation to UNLOCK THE MATCH.
David, the fate of Brad&rsquo;s reelection is at stake. Please don&rsquo;t waste this opportunity.
