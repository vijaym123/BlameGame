The Longest
Day
"For these men are lately drawn from the ways of
peace. They fight not for the lust of conquest. They fight to end conquest.
They fight to liberate. They fight to let justice arise, and
tolerance and good will among all Thy people. "
Franklin D. Roosevelt, June
6, 1944
Seventy years ago today, more than
150,000 troops from the United States, Britain, and Canada landed on
beaches in Normandy, France on what will always be known as D-Day.
June 6, 1944 will forever live in memory as the day on which the
forces of freedom, united in a common cause, began to beat back the terror
of Nazi tyranny that had enveloped Europe.
In announcing
the beginning of the invasion, President Franklin Roosevelt took to the
radio, as he had so many times before, to speak with the American
people.
But this time he did something different.
He didnt
give a speech.
Instead, at that solemn moment, with so much
hanging in the balance, he offered a prayer, which can be heard in this
recording .
The
National Archives
and the
U.S.
Army
have assembled outstanding online exhibits that draw on historic
photographs, film, and documents to mark this historic
anniversary.
Let us pause to remember the sacrifice of all those who
participated in the D-Day invasion, especially those who gave the ultimate
sacrifice in the cause of peace and freedom, and to their families and
loved ones.
Taliban Terrorists Given Get Out of Jail
Free Card
President Obamas decision to give a
Get of Jail Free card to five of the most dangerous Taliban leaders in
custody at Guantanamo has increased the threat to long-range
stability in Afghanistan and the Middle East and puts American lives and
interests at much greater risk.
In its lead
editorial
yesterday, the
Wall Street
Journal
clearly and concisely explains why President Obama's
decision to swap five Taliban killers for the return of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl
has morphed from a debatable policy decision into the Administration's
latest political fiasco.
The Presidents troubling
decision to circumvent the law by failing to consult with Congress before
releasing five senior Taliban leaders has raised serious questions about
his true foreign policy goals and his understanding of the very real
threat our country faces from global terrorism and its
supporters.
Must Read: Michael Gersons Column on Obamas global
war on straw men
Michael Gerson, a
Washington Post
columnist and former speechwriter
for President George W. Bush, penned an excellent
column
this week analyzing President Obamas speech last week at West
Point.
It is a must read for all those who are concerned at
the erosion of American leadership in the world.
The
Pen is Mightier than the Pixel
The increasing
reliance on electronic forms of written communication is threatening to
render handwriting obsolete.
As someone who values handwritten
communication for the personal touch it conveys (I still personally sign
every letter that leaves my office and pen handwritten notes by the
dozens every week) I found this
article
about the
benefits of handwriting to be of great interest.
I hope you will
too.
Salute: John Harrigan of Sussex County, A
Veterans Best Friend
Along with many veterans, and
an especially large number of my fellow Vietnam veterans, I had the
honor last weekend to
attend
the groundbreaking for
the new Northern New Jersey Veterans Memorial Cemetery in
Sparta.
This new, non-profit cemetery will eventually provide
the final resting place for more than 14,000 American veterans from
Sussex, Warren, Morris, and Passaic counties.
No one
deserves more credit for the creation of cemetery than Sussex Countys
John Harrigan.
As this
article
explains, John
has been working for years on this project.
He and his
Association, with the major assistance of the Sussex County Board of Chosen
Freeholders and of many other supporters and contributors, are ensuring
that the veterans who will one day rest here will be accorded the
honor they are due for their service to our country.
I salute
John for all that he does for our fellow veterans.
He truly is a
veterans best friend!
Salute: Bill Koch, Great
Swamp Refuge Manager
After 43 years of faithful and
dedicated service conserving the nature of America as a valued leader
at the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, including 30 years as
refuge manager at the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, Bill Koch
is preparing to enjoy a well-earned retirement.
Anyone who
has enjoyed visiting the Great Swamp has seen the results of Bills
dedicated work.
His vision, leadership, commitment, and
perseverance helped transform the Great Swamp into one of the premier wildlife
refuges in the world.
Although his day-to-day presence
will be missed, I was very pleased to learn that Bill intends to remain
involved in the Great Swamp.
I salute Bill for all he
has done to ensure that this natural treasure is preserved for
generations to come!
