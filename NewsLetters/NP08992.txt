Friends,
This morning the Montgomery Advertiser is exclusively reporting more
details about the ongoing scandal at the Department of Veterans
Affairs. An update from the Inspector General is expected to be
released this week naming which VA facilities are being investigated
for wrongdoing in the scheduling process. The Central Alabama Veterans
Health Care System is among those named. In fact, Central Alabama will
be categorized as among the most serious cases.
I encourage you to pick up a Montgomery Advertiser today or go online
to the Advertiser's website
to read the full
exclusive story.
I hear from area veterans everyday who experience difficulty dealing
with the VA. Their stories and this report confirm what we've suspected
for some time about the pattern of neglect and mismanagement within the
VA. It is disgusting and infuriating to know that the cruelty, neglect
and malfeasance we have heard about elsewhere has been happening right
here in Central Alabama.
I met on Friday with Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System
Director James Talton to discuss this disturbing report. To his credit,
Director Talton said he immediately fired employees responsible for
wrongdoing once became aware of it. He also informed the Inspector
General of Montgomery's discrepancies instead of trying to sweep it
under the rug.
I appreciate Director Talton for taking responsibility and holding bad
actors accountable. But, this isn't over. Anyone found to have
mistreated veterans, altered wait list documents, or been complicit in
such behavior should be immediately terminates and possibly prosecuted.
More than anything we must find ways to fix the problems that have led
to these outrageous wait times. I'm deeply involved in VA reform
efforts in Congress, seeking commonsense, bi-partisan changes that will
get our veterans the care they deserve.
More on the VA
WSFA did a special report this week on the ongoing problems at the VA.
I sat down with Jennifer Oravet to discuss ways to streamline care and
cut down on these outrageous wait times by utilizing local providers
through Patient Centered Community Care. Watch a clip of one of their
reports by clicking the image below:
A "whipped up" controversy?
This week details have emerged about the plan to release five former
Taliban commanders from U.S. custody in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba in
exchange for Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl.
President Obama expressed surprise when the exchange was met with
widespread, bi-partisan criticism, rather than the universal
celebration the White House first tried to project. He called it a
"whipped up" controversy based in politics.
Actually, there are good reasons why the way the White House went about
this exchange has upset many Americans, including lawmakers from both
parties, national security experts - some who have served in his
Administration, and military families.
I discussed these reasons and more in my weekly column, which you can
read online at Yellowhammer news
.
Reaction to the Taliban prisoner negotiation isn't a "whipped up"
controversy. It is a genuine response from concerned Americans who don't
understand why the President would make such an ill-advised decision,
much less attempt to celebrate it.
District Travel
While Congress was out of session last week, I spent time meeting with
constituents throughout Alabama's Second Congressional District.
Visiting with constituent groups, touring local businesses, and
listening to the concerns of Alabamians is key to my ability to
represent your interests and priorities in Congress.
On Wednesday I held meetings in and around Dothan. Whenever I'm in town
I love being able to sit down on the "front porch" with my friend,
Charlie Platt for his Top of the Morning show.
On Thursday I was in Troy, and first had the opportunity to visit with
the Troy chapter of the National Active and Retired Federal Employees
Association. There were a lot of good questions about the VA scandal,
the Bowe Bergdahl prisoner exchange, and some of the upcoming
legislation in the House.
Later on, I met with a group of local bankers organized by the Alabama
Bankers Association to talk about the impact of Dodd-Frank legislation
in Alabama. Local bankers are facing crippling regulations that affect
their ability to make loans and support job growth within their
communities. I enjoyed the opportunity to listen to their stories and
discuss reform efforts underway
in Congress.
I also had the opportunity Thursday to tour Southern Classic Food Group
in Brundidge. I appreciate CEO Chuck Caraway and Brundidge Mayor Jimmy
Ramage for hosting me. Read more about my visit to Pike County in this
write-up
from the Troy Messenger.
Friday, I was honored to be on hand at Fort Rucker to attend the
promotion ceremony
for Lieutenant General Tony
Crutchfield. Lt. Gen. Crutchfield is the former Commanding General from
Fort Rucker, and he and his wife, Kim hold a special place in the
hearts of the Rucker family.
Later Friday afternoon I took several constituent meetings, and spoke
to a group of international military officers that are in Montgomery
attending the Air War College at Maxwell Airforce Base.
The Week Ahead
Next week, the House is expected to begin consideration of
appropriations bills with a significant impact on Alabama. The
Transportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill,
which will provide critical dollars for Alabama roads and development,
will be a part of our schedule on Monday.
Later in the week, the Agriculture, Rural Development, and Food and
Drug Administration appropriations bill is expected to be on the floor.
The bill provides crucial federal funding for one of Alabama's most
important industries. Representative Robert Aderholt of North Alabama
is the chairman of the subcommittee that managed the bill and I am
confident that it is a good bill for our state.
Additionally, the House is expected to consider:
*
H.R. 2072, the Demanding Accountability for Veterans Act
*
H.R. 3211, the Mortgage Choice Act,
*
H.R. 4457, America's Small Business Tax Relief Act
As always, please do not hesitate to reach out to me or member of my
staff if we can ever be of help to you. It is an honor to serve as your
representative in Congress.
Sincerely,
Washington DC

I
held

Whenever
I&#8217;m
in
town
I
love
being
able
to
sit
down
on
the
&#8220;front
porch&#8221;
with
my
friend,
Charlie
Platt
for
his
Top
of
the
Morning
show.
On
Thursday
I
was
in
Troy,
and
first
had
the
opportunity
to
visit
with
the
Troy
chapter
of
the
National
Active
and
Retired
Federal
Employees
Association.
There
were
a
lot
of
good
questions
about
the
VA
scandal,
the
Bowe
Bergdahl
prisoner
exchange,
and
some
of
the
upcoming
legislation
in
the
House.
Later
on,
I
met
with
a
group
of
local
bankers
organized
by
the
Alabama
Bankers
Association
to
talk
about
the
impact
of
Dodd-Frank

in
Alabama.
Local

facing
crippling
regulations
that

I

I
also
had
the

Thursday

Brundidge.
I

Friday,
I
was
honored
to
be
on
hand
at
Fort
Rucker
to
attend
the
promotion
ceremony
for
Lieutenant
General
Tony
Crutchfield.
Lt.
Gen.
Crutchfield
is
the
former
Commanding
General
from
Fort
Rucker,
and
he
and
his
wife,
Kim
hold
a
special
place
in
the
hearts
of
the
Rucker
family.
Later
Friday
afternoon
I
took
several
constituent
meetings,
and
spoke
to
a
group
of
international
military
officers
that
are
in
Montgomery
attending
the
Air
War
College
at
Maxwell
Airforce
Base.
The
Week
Ahead
Next
week,
the
House
is
expected
to
begin
consideration
of
appropriations
bills
with
a
significant
impact
on
Alabama.
The
Transportation,
Housing
and
Urban
Development
appropriations
bill,
which
will
provide
critical
dollars
for
Alabama
roads
and
development,
will
be
a
part
of
our
schedule
on
Monday.
Later
in
the
week,
the
Agriculture,
Rural
Development,
and
Food
and
Drug
Administration
appropriations
bill
is
expected
to
be
on
the
floor.
The
bill
provides
crucial
federal
funding
for
one
of
Alabama&#8217;s
most
important
industries.
Representative
Robert
Aderholt
of
North
Alabama
is
the
chairman
of
the
subcommittee
that
managed
the
bill
and
I
am
confident
that
it
is
a
good
bill
for
our
state.
Additionally,
the
House
is
expected
to
consider: H.R.
2072,
the
Demanding
Accountability
for
Veterans
Act H.R.
3211,
the
Mortgage
Choice
Act, H.R.
4457,
