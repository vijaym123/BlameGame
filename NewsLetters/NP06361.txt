. The hearing, entitled Equality for the District of Columbia: Discussing the Implications of S. 132, the New Columbia Admission Act, will be held today. You can watch the hearing live at 3:00 p.m. by visiting http://1.usa.gov/1tIuXWt.
Every year since 1993, I have been re-introducing the New Columbia Admission Act in hopes of it gaining the traction that we have witnessed over this past year.
The bill has now broken the record
of both House and Senate cosponsors.
With President Obamas endorsement of statehood in July, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reids cosponsorship last year, and now this historic hearing, we must continue this momentum and run with it to build more public support in Congress and in the city. This is why I took to the House floor last week to make the case for equal representation
for the residents of D.C.
The Continuing Resolution: Protecting D.Cs Gun and Marijuana Laws, Shutdown Prevention
Last Tuesday, the House released the fiscal year 2015 short-term continuing resolution.
I was successful in keeping out the House-passed
prohibitions on the District of Columbia from enforcing its own gun safety laws and decriminalizing or legalizing marijuana.
And even if the federal government shuts down at the start of
the fiscal year (October 1), or at any other point during fiscal year 2015, the District, for the first time ever, is fully protected, will stay open, and have full access to its local funds.
Supporting the Next Generation of Disability Rights Advocates
On Saturday, I had the warm pleasure to give the keynote address
at a graduation ceremony for the DC Advocacy Partners, a leadership training program whose graduates are trained in advocacy for disability rights
a cause which I have been championing for many years, both as co-chair of the Congressional Down Syndrome Caucus and as the mother of a daughter with Down Syndrome.
