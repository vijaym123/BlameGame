QUOTE OF THE WEEK: Ed on the passage of the Veterans Access to Care
Act: Whitfield stated, "Our country owes an enormous debt to those who
have served in uniform. Veterans should have the care they have rightly
earned, and should not have to endure the delays and backlogs that have
chronically plagued VA facilities across the country. I was absolutely
appalled when I learned veterans in and around my District are
experiencing these problems first hand, and I felt the need for
immediate action in Congress. I am pleased the House of Representatives
moved quickly to ensure our veterans are provided with outside care
when they need it. It is now time for the Senate and the President to
act so we can fix this problem that has plagued our brave men and women
for too long."
