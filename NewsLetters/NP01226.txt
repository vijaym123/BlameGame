Remembering the War to End All Wars
As I have shared with you before, I am passionate about remembering the nearly five million American soldiers who served overseas during World War I. That is why I authored a bipartisan, bicameral compromise to designate the Liberty Memorial at the National World War I Museum as the National World War I Museum and Memorial. This truly gives Kansas City the distinction of leading the nation in marking the centennial anniversary, honoring the great sacrifices made, and lessons learned, during World War I.
You can watch my interview on my efforts to support the National WWI Museum and Memorial below.
July 28th of 2014 marked the 100th anniversary of the beginning of World War I and the day Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. On April 6, 1917, the United States declared war against Germany and entered the Great War. In November of 1918, the citizens of Kansas City banded together to raise $2.5 million dollars in 10 days to raise a memorial to the Nation&rsquo;s soldiers. When adjusted for inflation, that would be a sum of over $28 million dollars today.
The Liberty Memorial opened on November 1, 1921 to a crowd of 200,000 people. Included among the guests where all five Allied Commanders, including General John J. Pershing, the Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in World War I.
In the crowd that day was also the Captain of Army Company D, Harry Truman. Over time, a total of three United States Presidents have dedicated the memorial. President Coolidge laid the cornerstone in 1918. Presidents Truman and Eisenhower rededicated the Memorial in 1961.
