Dear
Friends:
Late this afternoon, the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced approval of the Orlando
International Airports request for approval of an economic development
plan to construct the new intermodal center and people mover connection
to the new facility and future airport expansion.
This approval
will allow the airport to collect passenger revenues to pay for the
project, generating over $396 million.
This will be one of the most significant transportation and
development projects in the history of our region.
Approval of this
plan will also prepare and equip our region for business, tourism and
commercial activity for decades to
come.
Without this FAA approval, there would be no airport
expansion, nor would we be able to connect future transportation links.
The airport, which was originally constructed to handle 24 million
passengers, and now accommodates nearly 35 million annually, would be
left in a holding pattern without this
approval.
This project will create thousands of jobs and
unlimited future economic opportunities for our
region.
With my regards and best wishes, I
remain
John L. Mica
