Happy Independence Day
Today we celebrate the birth of our nation and the birth of a dream
that a people dedicated to individual freedom and to a limited and
accountable form of government could achieve unmatched success and
prosperity. For over two centuries, through turmoil and war at home and
abroad, political and civil upheaval, the character of America has endured
and with it the dreams of millions have been
realized.
As friends and families gather to enjoy
fellowship and pride on our Independence Day, let us remember the
principles that have made America the greatest nation the world has ever seen.
In doing so, let us also honor and thank the brave men and women who
throughout our nations history have done what was necessary to
protect and preserve our precious freedoms.
My family and I wish you and yours a safe and happy
Independence Day!
