Government Funding Bills Receive Strong Bi-Partisan Support
Last week the House passed two appropriations bills with strong,
bi-partisan support: the FY15 Military Construction and Veterans
Affairs Appropriations Act and the FY15 Legislative Branch
Appropriations Act. These are the first two appropriations bills that
the House has passed this year, and I expect the Senate to work on
these bills and send them to the President's desk.

Georgians often remind me that Congress has the "power of the purse,"
and I'm happy to say that in support of our veterans, we're using it.
Instead of just talking about supporting our veterans, the House is
working together to make sure that the VA makes it as easy as possible
for any veterans to go to any VA medical facility in the world and
receive the best health treatment available.

Gwinnett Chamber of Commerce Brings Georgia Know-How to Washington, D.C.
On Wednesday and Thursday of last week the Gwinnett Chamber of Commerce
was in Washington, D.C., for its annual visit.
I was delighted to
spend time with so many friends and neighbors.
Together, we met with a
number of important legislators, including House Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bill Shuster (R-PA), House Judiciary
Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security Chairman Trey Gowdy
(R-SC), House Financial Services Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and
Trade Chairman John Campbell (R-CA), Georgia Senators Saxby Chambliss
and Johnny Isakson, and Representative Hank Johnson (D-GA) who
represents the southern portion of Gwinnett County.
In all these meetings, our local business leaders had the opportunity
to question these Congressional leaders about those issues that are
critical to our state's economic prosperity -- water resources,
transportation funding, immigration policy, monetary policy and the
Federal Reserve, international trade, and more, as well as offer their
insight about how federal policies are affecting boots on the ground in
Georgia. Their visit was extremely valuable for me, and I thank
everyone who attended for taking the time to share their knowledge with
my colleagues.

Celebrating Charter Schools in Our Community
Last Friday I visited with students at the Gwinnett School of
Mathematics, Science and Technology (GSMST). GSMST is a point of pride
for our community, and I thank the school for hosting me. This charter
school is educating some of the best and brightest young minds in the
Seventh District, and it's been recognized nationally for its
accomplishments.
Rep. Rob Woodall speaks with students at GSMST on May 2nd.
The students that I spoke with in the AP Government class were truly
exceptional and brought up some of the most salient issues facing our
country - a dominant one being immigration reform. As a community with
so many first generation families who believe in America, the
opportunity she provides, and the rule of law that keeps her safe,
working together with this generation of leaders, we can lead America
forward.
Health Care Update
The House passed an extremely important measure last week that fixes a
major flaw in Obamacare. Under current law, American health insurance
companies that sell policies to Americans living abroad or foreigners
legally living and working in the U.S. are subject to all the
provisions of Obamacare. The problem with this is that foreign
insurance companies are exempt from Obamacare. As such, Obamacare puts
American companies at a significant disadvantage, and this will cost
American jobs. Republicans and Democrats came together in the House to
fix the problem, and now we need the White House and the Senate to work
with us to make this change in the law.
*
Huffington Post. Republicans and Democrats pass bill to save
American jobs from Obamacare.
We learned last week that healthcare.gov is in even deeper trouble than
we thought. Not only is the back-end of the website inoperable at the
moment, but it's going to cost $121 million to fix!
*
Washington Times. Healthcare.gov will cost $121 million more to
fix.
While we still don't know how many of the 8 million folks who HHS tells
us have signed up for the plans were those who lost their insurance
because of Obamacare and have now chosen a different plan, or how many
of those folks have actually paid for their plans, but we do know the
law is failing the very people it was intended to help -- the
uninsured.

Obamacare.

Oversight Subcommittee Examines America's Energy Export Policy
On Wednesday, my subcommittee held a hearing on liquefied natural gas
(LNG) exports wherein we featured two witnesses from the Department of
Energy (DOE) and the Department of State.
Our domestic energy
producers have succeeded in spite of the Obama Administration's war on
American energy, and I took this opportunity to ask a DOE official
what the
Administration's plan was to ensure the necessary infrastructure keeps
pace with demand so that we're able to fully take advantage of this
historic and potentially transformative energy opportunity for our
nation.

Oversight Continues Search for Answers on Benghazi
Like many of you, I have been concerned about the obstruction and
deception of the Obama Administration regarding the events of September
11, 2012.
The revelation that a key email was omitted
from the documents turned over to
Congress until this week further undermined the Administration's
credibility on this issue.
Speaker John Boehner weighed in on the
issue and even called on Secretary of State John Kerry to testify
on why the Administration failed to properly comply with a
congressional subpoena.
The intolerable stonewalling of the Obama
Administration over even the most basic details and information on
Benghazi is driving Congress toward a special Select Committee to
investigate.

wasn't a spontaneous protest.

War on Poverty Hearing
Georgia's poverty rate is nearly three percentage points higher than
the national average.
On Wednesday, the House Budget Committee invited
three guests who have worked tirelessly to reduce poverty, and I
applaud Chairman Paul Ryan's effort to meet with members of communities
where our government programs are being most frequently utilized.
What
was clear from talking with these folks is that funding is not the cure
to addressing economic mobility -- it is just part of a broader effort
to change how people view work, government dependency, and education.

The Week Ahead
This week is National Charter Schools Week
. As you saw
above, I had the pleasure of visiting the Gwinnett School of
Mathematics, Science, and Technology (GSMST) last week, and this week I
am happy that the House is going to consider a bill - H.R. 10, the
"Success and Opportunity Through Quality Charter Schools Act"
- that will help innovative charter
schools like GSMST to thrive.
The House will also be considering a very important, though very
unfortunate issue - a resolution holding Ms. Lois Lerner in contempt of
Congress for her failure to testify about the IRS tax-exempt
organization targeting scandal.

matter.
