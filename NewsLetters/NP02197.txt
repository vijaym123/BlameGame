OUR DISTRICT
March 17, 2015
Friend,
Several weeks ago my office opened our annual
Congressional Art Competition , which gives all 10th district
high school students the opportunity to submit their original artwork
to hang on the walls of the U.S. Capitol
building.
Have you sent me your
submission yet?
Do you know any
students who might be interesting in
participating?
Pieces are due this Friday by 5 p.m. PT. We accept any
and all artwork, as long as it's 2D. Photographs, paintings, drawings,
collages, you name it.
You can find a full list of
submission requirements here .
The first place winner
will have his or her artwork sent to Washington, D.C. where it will be
displayed for the next year in the national exhibition in the Cannon
Tunnel, a pedestrian walkway leading to the United States Capitol.
Additionally, a scholarship may also be offered to the winner to fly to
Washington, D.C. for the reception and announcement of the National
Winner. Second and third place winners will have the opportunity to
display their art in my Modesto district office.
This year,
you'll have the opportunity to participate in voting for your favorite
piece on
my Facebook page . We'll upload each
submission we receive on behalf of each student. Starting Monday,
please visit my page and "Like" your favorite
to tell me
which piece you think should win!
I hope you'll join me
in celebrating the talent of Central Valley students.
And if
you know an interested student, please forward this
message.
