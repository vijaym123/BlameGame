Congressional Report
Dear Friends,
Please take a moment to read my latest update from this week in Washington and Texas Congressional District 28. You can stay connected by signing up for my weekly email
here.
114th Congress Begins
I was sworn in to the 114th Congress, which is my sixth term in the U.S. House of Representatives, by Speaker of the House John Boehner and my wife Imelda on Jan. 6 in Washington.
This past Tuesday, I was officially sworn in to the 114th Congress in Washington, D.C. As the new Congress begins, Im ready to get right to work on the issues that are important to the 28th District like creating jobs, and making sure every Texan has access to quality, affordable healthcare and education.
Texans know how to work hard and work together to get things done, and its my hope that in this new Congressional session, my colleagues in Washington are as ready as I am to adopt that philosophy in Congress.

Meeting with Rep. Latta
My wife Imelda and I met with Rep. Bob Latta and his family on Jan. 6 after our swearing in to discuss our priorities for the new Congress.
It was great to discuss our goals for the new Congress with fellow House member Rep. Bob Latta (R-OH5). I had the pleasure of meeting his wonderful family while they were in D.C. for his swearing in.
My office hosted an open house after I was sworn in, where I got to speak with constituents and colleagues about the issues affecting Texas and our country.

My Outreach Coordinator for Bexar County, Gilbert Lafuente met with new Bexar County Commission for Precinct 4, Tommy Calvert, Jr. during his swearing in on Tuesday, Jan. 6 in San Antonio to discuss how our offices can further work together to provide services to the Bexar County residents.
