Carper's Connection
January 9, 2015
Dear Friends,
Earlier this week, I joined Representative John Carney and Senator
Chris Coons to highlight the passage of legislation that makes a
common-sense fix to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and helps protect
hundreds of jobs in the First State.
When the ACA became law, an unintentional provision put American
insurance companies who provide expatriate, or international, health
insurance plans at a serious disadvantage while competing with foreign
insurance companies abroad. These plans provide health insurance to
Americans and other international workers in foreign countries. The
American insurance companies offering these plans, faced with financial
and legal restraints that did not apply to their foreign competitors,
had to consider laying off employees to cover the costs. Hundreds of
those employees in Delaware faced the prospect of losing their job.
My colleagues and I in the Delaware congressional delegation, as well
as other members of Congress in both parties, were committed to making
sure our hardworking constituents could keep their jobs. Congressman
Carney was a tenacious leader in getting the fix passed first in the
House of Representatives and then Sen. Coons and I worked across the
aisle to pass the bill in the Senate. This bipartisan piece of
legislation, which has now been signed into law, will help protect
hundreds of American jobs in Delaware and even more across the country.
As we worked
on this issue for more than three years, I was reminded of some of my
core principles.
I like to say, "If it isn't perfect, make it better,"
and this is a good start toward doing that with the Affordable Care
Act. We also didn't give up when we felt in our hearts this was the
right thing to do, even though we hit many roadblocks along the way.
Together, Congressman Carney, Senator Coons, and I will continue to
work hard for our fellow Delawareans and jobs in our state. I'm
particularly proud of what we were able to accomplish in this effort.
As the News Journal wrote
, "Every once in awhile that
persistence and hard work of legend actually pays off."
Sincerely,
