February 15, 2014
Dear Friend,
I want to share with you some of the things I've been working on in
Washington on your behalf and invite you to neighborhood conversation I
will be hosting in the First District.
Upcoming Event
I will be holding a Neighborhood Conversation with constituents this
Tuesday to discuss federal policies that impact Rhode Islanders and
provide an update of my work in Washington. I invite you to participate
in this conversation and join me at Hope High School on 324 Hope Street
in Providence this Tuesday, February 18th at 5:30 PM.
During my Neighborhood Conversation I will talk about my efforts to get
Rhode Islanders back to work, renew unemployment benefits, and other
issues. Most importantly this is an opportunity for me to hear directly
from you about the issues most important to you.
I hope you will be able to join me at Hope High School and please click

if
you would like to learn more about this event or call my office at
729-5600 to RSVP.
Continuing to Fight to Extend Unemployment Benefits
Our economy is still recovering from a deep recession and far too many
Rhode Islanders are unemployed and continue to face a challenging job
market. These folks are our neighbors and friends struggling to make
ends meet. Without unemployment insurance they will have to make very
difficult decisions to pay their bills, like cutting back on groceries,
home heating, and even rent or mortgage payments.
That's why it is so critical to renew emergency unemployment benefits,
which expired on December 28th.
I am asking for you to fill out this survey
and share
your story
about how unemployment insurance
impacts you and your family.
Thank you for sharing your views, and please be assured that I will do
everything I can to advance legislation in Congress to create American
jobs and support unemployed workers while they look for new jobs.
Raising the Minimum Wage
In the United States, if you work hard and play by the rules you should
be able to provide a decent quality of life for yourself and your
family. But, over the past four years, the federal minimum wage has
remained stagnant and lost value. This doesn't reflect our values as
Americans.
I was pleased President Obama signed an executive order increasing the
minimum wage for federal contractors earlier this week. That is why I
am a cosponsor of the Fair Minimum Wage Act, which would bump the
minimum wage up to $10.10 over three years and include annual increases
tied to the rate of inflation. Building from the middle class out is a
strategy that will move our economy forward, and I am committed to
working with my colleagues to enact this legislation.
As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns,
call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at
David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov.
My best always,
David Cicilline

Raising

In

if

be
able
to

the

has
remained

This
doesn&#8217;t

our

as
Americans.
I
was
pleased
President
Obama
signed
an
executive

increasing
the
minimum
wage
for
federal
contractors
earlier
this
week.
That

why
I
