Friend,
The President&#39;s State of the Union Address provides an opportunity to reflect on the past year and to look towards the progress we can make in the year to come.
Last night, Congressman Chris Gibson and I responded to the State of the Union as members of the No Labels Problem Solvers, a bipartisan group of nearly 100 Members of Congress working to get past party politics and move our country forward.
We have committed to the No Labels campaign to create a national strategic agenda&mdash;to develop and agree to shared goals&mdash;as an important step in creating a vision for our country.
You can view the video below:
It&rsquo;s critical that we find common ground to guide us past partisan gridlock in Washington. If we start from a position of unity, rather than division, we&#39;ll be much more effective.
It&rsquo;s time to take action&mdash;Congress has wasted far too much time fighting instead of solving problems. Together, we can stop business as usual in Washington and start addressing the many challenges we face.
Please take a moment to watch our video here.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&rsquo;s 7th District
