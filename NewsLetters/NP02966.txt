Dear Friend,
This week, Republicans voted for
the
56th time
to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
I spoke on the
House floor against the repeal because t his is just another failed gimmick to dismantle a law that is
working for the American people.
In just one year, thanks to the
ACA, we have reduced the total number of uninsured adults by 26
percent.
To date, 370,451 New Yorkers have enrolled in a Marketplace
exchange plan.
I urge you to sign up for a plan before the February
15th deadline if you haven't already done so.
Every February our nation celebrates Black History Month to honor the
many contributions Blacks have made to our shared history.
I
commemorated the occasion on the House floor with remarks, which you can
watch
here .
Harlem was the epicenter
of the Black cultural movement of the 1920's known as the Harlem
Renaissance, and was home to luminaries such as Langston Hughes, Madame
C.J. Walker, and Duke Ellington.
I am proud that it continues to be
a bastion of Black social, political, and artistic development.
Share your favorite Black History Month fact from our District with
me on
Facebook , or you can tweet your favorite
picture of our district @cbrangel using #NY13 #BHM.
Your opinion is valuable to me. So please visit

honor serving you.
Best
regards,
Charles B. Rangel

Chairman (FCC) Tom Wheeler recently announced his plans to enforce open
Internet protections. I am committed to ensuring open access to the

support
of a common regulatory framework
for both wireline and mobile devices.
Should the Internet be open to
everyone? Yes No I don't know If you are having trouble, click
