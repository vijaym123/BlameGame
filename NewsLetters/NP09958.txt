Dear Fellow Coloradan,
More than three years ago, I was proud to lead the successful bipartisan effort to end the wasteful and unnecessary process of congressional earmarks. Earmarking, while a small part of the federal budget, put too much focus on narrow, local priorities and didn&rsquo;t emphasize enough transparency and oversight to ensure taxpayer funds were being used efficiently.
Convincing other lawmakers to give up earmarks wasn&rsquo;t easy, but my efforts paid off after I worked with my colleagues on both sides of the political aisle. In 2011, the
Senate implemented my idea of a moratorium on earmarks .
I&rsquo;ve been proud to put pork-barrel spending behind us, but some of my colleagues in Congress recently have talked about bringing earmarks back to Washington. That's an unwise idea, for Colorado and for our country.
Sens. Udall and Coburn appear on Fox News to discuss their bipartisan effort to quash any earmark revival.
That's why
I&rsquo;m partnering with Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.)
again to urge congressional leaders to keep our ban on earmarks in place. An earmark ban has had bipartisan support, and now is not the time to step backward.
This isn&rsquo;t a red or blue idea, it's simply what's right &mdash; and that's why editorial pages from
The Denver Post
to the
Washington Examiner
are standing shoulder-to-shoulder with me in this fight.
Tell Congress you support my push to keep pork-barrel spending a thing of the past. Washington should spend wisely and not be beholden to pork .
Maintaining our ban on earmarks sends a signal to Coloradans, to businesses that want to invest in the United States and to our global allies that we are serious about making the tough choices that will help us regain our fiscal health. Weeding out wasteful spending is also crucial for responsibly spending taxpayer dollars and holding our government accountable.
Warm regards,
Offices
