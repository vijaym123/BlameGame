A top member of Congress called on President Obama on Monday to deploy the National Guard
to the southwest border to help the Border Patrol handle the surge of illegal immigrant children.

subcommittee, sent a letter saying that Border Patrol agents need to be put back on patrol duty rather than processing or babysitting for the children who have been caught trying to enter.
"This diversion away from normal patrol responsibilities will result in an increase of drugs and migrants illicitly crossing our border," she said.

spurred rumors of legal status for new arrivals back in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador - the three countries sending most of the young children that make up the surge.
