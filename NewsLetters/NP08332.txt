This week, the Supreme Court ruled to limit the Administrations regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from cars, which opponents said would cost billions to implement and cut thousands of jobs. However, the EPAs new regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants still need to be addressed as well.
Background : On June 2 nd , the EPA released its proposed rule cutting emissions from existing power plants. In January of this year, the EPA issued a proposed rule setting carbon emission standards for newly established natural gas and coal-fired power plants. Concerns have been raised that the new performance standards, which mandate the use of carbon capture technology which has yet to be successfully employed in commercial energy production, set an impractical benchmark, and will end up eliminating jobs and stunting economic growth. Last week,
nine governors wrote to the President
asking him to withdraw the proposed rule, saying it would cost millions of jobs and billions of dollars.
Action:
I am co-sponsoring the Protection and Accountability Regulatory Act,
H.R. 4813 . This bill does two important things:
Nullifies these EPA rules on emissions from power plants.
Prohibits the EPA from issuing anything similar unless specifically authorized to do so by Congress.
I also cosponsored the REINS Act ( H.R. 367 ), which requires Congressional approval for regulations that cost over $100 million. Its just common sense that we ought to have more than unelected bureaucrats writing rules that the businesses in our communities have to follow.
Yours in service,
Randy
