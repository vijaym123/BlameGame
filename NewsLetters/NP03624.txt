Dear
Friends,
Once again, it is time to deck the halls; celebrate with
friends family and loved-ones; reflect on the past and create
resolutions for the future. I enjoy this time of year not only because the
anniversary of the day that I married my wonderful wife Kay falls on
December 19, and this year we are celebrating 55 years, but also I enjoy
spending quality time and celebrating with family, friends
and Oklahomans.
This year, I was proud to finally end my four-year hiatus from the
Tulsa Christmas Parade and celebrate with 30,000 Oklahomans the reason
for the season
Jesus Christ.
It was an honor not
only to return to my 30-year tradition of riding horseback in the
parade, but also to see the excited faces of all of the children and
families at the parade as they enjoyed this free, historical event
for the Tulsa community.
I hope that in all of our celebrations, we also remember the
sacrifices of the service members that are abroad defending our country
and protecting our freedom. In Oklahoma, we are surrounded by military
and their families with five military bases. Please say a prayer or
reach out to those families in our communities who
are
serving our country and are apart from their loved ones this Christmas
season. At Fort Sill, a tradition took place
on Wednesday called "The Exodus" where the base helped roughly 4,000
soldiers, station in Oklahoma for training, reunite with family and
friends for Christmas.
KSWO-TV has a wonderful story about the event that
you can watch by clicking

In closing, I want to leave you with these two passages my
wife Kay picked out for our family's Christmas card this
year:
We are to patient in
adversity,
Grateful in the midst of
blessing,
And to trust our faithful God and Father for the
future,
Assured that no creature shall separate us from His
love,
Since all creatures are so completely in His
hand
That without His will, they cannot even
move.
- Heidelberg Catechism
1563
"And she shall bring forth a son, and thou
shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins."
-- Matthew 1:21 KJV
From my family to yours, we
wish you all wonderful Christmas and a fulfilling new
year.
Sincerely,
