House Passes Small Business Tax Relief Bills
Last Thursday, the House passed two important bills providing tax
relief for American small businesses.
These bills -- H.R. 4453
and H.R. 4457
-- provide much needed certainty and capital to one of the greatest
engines of economic growth in our nation.
Almost half of all private
sector workers are employed by small businesses -- that's nearly 60
million Americans.
Instead of growing employment, roughly 90 percent
of small businesses are sending profits to tax preparers; an amount
that totals nearly $18 billion per year in tax compliance costs.
This
is money that isn't working for America.
The two bills that the House
passed last week will help to change that.
These bills will help
entrepreneurs, will grow jobs, and will help us expand our economy
.
I hope that the Senate will act on them expeditiously.
Water Resources Reform and Development Act Signed into Law
On Tuesday, President Obama signed the Water Resources Reform and
Development Act (WRRDA) into law. As I've told you many times in the
past, this water infrastructure bill is critical to Georgia's economic
future as it authorizes funding to deepen the Savannah Harbor and bring
more goods in and out of this bustling port that supports so many jobs
in Georgia and the entire southeastern U.S. I am so proud of the work
that the Georgia congressional delegation did in getting this bill
across the finish line.

The Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet is Growing
Monetary policy discussions are usually only interesting to bankers,
economists, and finance professionals. That's unfortunate because what
happens at the Federal Reserve affects every American - and in fact,
the entire world. The Fed went on a spending spree during the recent
recession, but by 2014, it was supposed to be selling off its assets
and returning its balance sheet to normal. That just isn't happening.

I spent some time on the House floor last Wednesday and Thursday
discussing this issue and how it affects American taxpayers. Please

The Week Ahead
This week the House is expected to finish consideration of the FY15
Agriculture and Food and Drug Administration Appropriations Act
, begin
consideration of the FY15 Department of Defense Appropriations Act
, and
pass a bill addressing the funding shortfall in the Highway Trust Fund.
The truth of the matter is that the Federal gasoline tax is not keeping
pace with the needs of our transportation system, and experts estimate
that by the end of July, the Trust Fund will need an influx of cash -
roughly $12 billion - to remain solvent for another year. Without
additional funds, road projects across the United States will stop
moving forward, putting road construction workers and heavy equipment
manufacturers off the job.
We have to have a serious discussion about
our transportation sector, and this bill will start that important
conversation.

Member of Congress
