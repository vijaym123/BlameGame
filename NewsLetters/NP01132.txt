Dear Friend,
Anyone who has heard me speak for more than five minutes has probably heard me express my deep concern about the United States falling behind our global competitors in STEM fields. I am particularly worried about
China, which graduates seven times as many engineers as we do here in America. In many technical fields, more than half the degrees awarded in America are earned by students here on temporary visas. They then return home and use their American education to
compete against the American economy.
I had the opportunity last week to visit with the high school robotics team at McDonogh School, located in my district. These young students built, wired and programmed a 120-pound robot named &#8220;Romulus&#8221; from
scratch in 45 days and entered it in two competitions against teams from around the world. After full school days, they often worked in the robotics lab until 9 p.m. before heading home to do their homework!
The visit was a breath of fresh air. These students are gaining real-world experience in mechanical and electrical engineering, computer science, business, construction, and teamwork. They are learning the skills
necessary to land the jobs of tomorrow and keep our economy competitive while having fun in the process.
I pledged to the students to continue doing my part to promote STEM education, like providing incentives to retired STEM professionals to pursue teaching as a second career. You can check out
