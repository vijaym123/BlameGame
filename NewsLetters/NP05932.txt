Friends,
Being back in
Northeast Ohio has been refreshing but busy. This week I traveled all
around the district, from Burton to Conneaut to Chagrin Falls to Mentor,
meeting many great people along the way. Here are a few
highlights:
Standing with our
Seniors
This week, I had the opportunity to visit with seniors around the 14th
District and hear their thoughts on the issues that matter most to them.
I believe our current seniors truly are the Greatest Generation, and
we must make sure their retirement needs are met.
September is
World Alzheimer's Month. Having experienced the pain of watching a close
family member face Alzheimers disease, Ive made it a point during my
time in Washington to stand with other families facing the same
challenges. Integrating Silver Alert plans nationwide is a crucial step to
keep our seniors safe, and I am glad to join my colleague Congressman
Patrick Murphy in
introducing the
National Silver
Alert Act
to assist families and law enforcement in
protecting those most vulnerable.
Supporting Local
Entrepreneurs
Monday was a great morning at Kent State
Geauga for the Small Business Seminar, hosted by the Geauga Growth
Partnership. Small businesses account for about 70% of new job creation
in the United States, so its imperative that we provide the resources
to help them do what they do best.
It was an honor
to recently be
named a 'Guardian of Small
Business' by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) , and
I will keep fighting against unnecessary regulations that inhibit
their growth.
On Tuesday, I stopped by Lowes in Mentor for
a tour. Thanks to Store Manager Richard Bruinsma for showing me around
and for a great discussion on the issues businesses like these are
facing.
Advocating for Health Care
Professionals
University Hospitals Conneaut Medical Center
provided a great tour of their facility on Thursday morning. As co-chair of
the House Nursing Caucus and the proud husband of a nurse, I remain
committed to addressing the needs of our health care professionals who
play such a pivotal role in the lives of their
patients.
