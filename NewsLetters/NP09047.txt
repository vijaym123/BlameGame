David,
Right now, Americans owe over $1 trillion in student loan debt, and that number is rapidly increasing by the second.
TODAY
at 3:30pm Senators Tammy Baldwin, Elizabeth Warren and I will be discussing, via video chat, our efforts to give more Americans a Fair Shot at a more affordable education, and a fair shot at success.
Click here, and sign up to join us.
We know the real impacts of student loan debt: just 36% of
millennials
own homes, the lowest since 1982. Parents are struggling to put food on the table as they work to pay off both their loans and their children&rsquo;s loans.
Senate Democrats like myself, Senators Baldwin and Warren are working to get borrowers a better deal by pushing for the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act: legislation that would allow current borrowers to refinance loans at a more affordable rate.
We want to discuss this legislation, hear your questions, and talk about other ways we can help relieve families of suffocating student loan debt.
Will you join us for a video chat TODAY at 3:30pm?

Thanks,
Richard Blumenthal
