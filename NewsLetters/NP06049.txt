Dear Friend,
Its no secret that, following the 2007-2009 recession, we found our economy in a hole.
Im sure youve all heard the saying when you are in a hole, stop digging.
Unfortunately, in many respects, the Senate needs to put down the shovel.
As you settle back into your fall routines, I want to bring some very troubling reports to your attention.
According to
the U.S. Department of Labor , there are 32 states that have yet to recover the jobs lost during the recession.
New Jersey is one of them.
At the current pace, the jobs gap wont close until 2018, according to research done by
the Hamilton Project .
Consequently, it should come as no surprise that six out of ten Americans say the
American Dream is out of reach .
But our future doesnt need to continue down this path.
My colleagues and I continue to fight for the middle class, for the men and women who are working 9 to 5 jobs, and for those who are living paycheck-to-paycheck.
In the last 18 months, the House of Representatives has passed more than
45 jobs bills almost every one of them with bipartisan support.
Weve repeatedly worked across party lines to help restore our lost jobs, rebuild our economy, and, ultimately, revive the American Dream.
Unfortunately, each of the above mentioned jobs bills sit idle in the United States Senate.
This is unacceptable.
Theres no reason why we cannot work together to reduce taxes on all Americans, eliminate burdensome government red tape, and advance policies that make it easier for businesses to innovate and expand.
Simply put, we must work together to advance legislation that makes your lives easier.
The hole we are in is not inescapablewe can and we will get out of it.
The first step on the road to recovery is for the Senate to take up the more than 45 jobs bills the House has passed.
Sincerely,
Scott Garrett
