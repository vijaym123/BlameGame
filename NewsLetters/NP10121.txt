2015 Budget
Congressman McClintock is a member of the House Budget Committee.
This
month he participated in floor and committee debate in support of the
2015 budget bill.
In remarks delivered on the House floor the
Congressman discussed the importance of balancing the budget.
He also
discussed the prosperity, security and future of the nation:
2015 Budget
In August of 2010, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs warned that the
greatest threat to our national security was our national debt.
That
was $4 trillion of debt ago.
In fact, since Inauguration day, 2009, we have accumulated more total
government debt than we had run up from the first day of the Washington
Administration through the third year of the George W. Bush
Administration.
We were told this would jump-start the economy.
It hasn't.
Instead, it has deprived markets of capital that would otherwise be
loaned to businesses seeking to expand jobs, to consumers seeking to
make purchases and to homebuyers seeking to re-enter the housing market.
I would remind the House that before we can provide for the common
defense and promote the general welfare we have to be able to pay for
them, and the ability of our government to do so is being slowly,
surely destroyed by our debt.
Balancing this budget and ultimately paying down the national debt is a
national security imperative; it is an economic imperative; and it is a
moral imperative.

In related remarks the Congressman discussed a pro-growth budgeting
bill designed to better anticipate economic consequences of major
actions:
H.R. 1874
Pro-Growth Budgeting Act
The question before the House is whether we are going to continue to
ignore the economic consequences of the major actions we take - or
start recognizing that incentives matter and that the legislation we
pass has profound economic consequences that must be taken into account.
Why does Amsterdam have the narrowest houses on earth?
It is because
they tax by street frontage.
Incentives matter.
What would happen to our revenue if we taxed all of a person's $100,000
income?
Static scoring upon which we currently depend says that we
will raise $100,000.
But we all know the correct answer is that we will raise ZERO dollars,
because that person now has no incentive to work at all.
Macroeconomics gives us tools to anticipate the real-world affect of
major policy changes, and we ought not to be blind to them.

The Congressman also supported passage of a baseline budgeting reform
bill.
In debate remarks the Congressman noted how often existing
budget baselines hide the many tough decisions that a budget requires:
H.R. 1871
Baseline Reform Act
Our Constitution assigns the principle responsibility over the public
purse to the House of Representatives.
Under that Constitutional
doctrine, a dollar can't be spent by this government unless the House
says it gets spent.
Yet today, spending increasingly seems to be out of our hands - driven
automatically by a variety of provisions and practices that thwart the
very design of the Constitution.
Roughly 2/3 of our spending is for legal entitlements, over which we
have lost any direct control in the appropriations process.
That's the
big problem.
But there are other problems as well that this bill
addresses.
One of them is the current process by which we calculate the baseline
from which we start our annual budget.
Any family would begin its budget process by asking, for example, "What
did we spend for groceries last year?"
Once it has that baseline, then
it would begin to adjust for changing circumstances.
The price of milk
is going up - should we cut back or look for substitutes?
Or should we
cut back on something else to afford that increase?
That's the rational process known to every reasonably well-managed
family.
This process gives budgeters - whether they are a Household or a House
of Representatives -- the ability to adjust for changing priorities,
needs and conditions.

District Events
On April 5th Congressman McClintock helped break ground for a new home
in Loomis for wounded Marine Corporal Joshua Hotaling. Corporal
Hotaling was on his first deployment when he suffered the traumatic
amputations of his legs and severe hand injuries in an IED blast in
Sangin, Afghanistan. The home project is being led by Homes for Our
Troops, a non-profit organization that builds specially adapted homes
for wounded warriors. Some 200 people attended the event, and many are
helping by donating money and materials to create a new home and
beginning for Joshua.

The Congressman met with the Auburn Chamber of Commerce Forum on April
15th, speaking about regional issues and federal policies.
On April 23rd the Congressman participated in the Sustainable Forest
Action Coalition.
The coalition meetings are an opportunity for U. S.
Forest Service representatives, forestry professionals, advocates,
members of Congress and local officials to review the impacts of
federal policy on forestry issues, including fire, logging, cattle
grazing and recreation.
On the evening of April 23rd the Congressman held a town hall meeting
in Oakhurst, where topics included federal policies affecting the
national and local economy.
Oakhurst Town Hall
On April 24th the Congressman visited Minarets High School in O'Neals.
He presented certificates to the school's Future Farmers of America
teams.
The teams were winners in the California State Natural
Resources Competition and will compete in October at the Future Farmers
of America National Convention.
The Congressman also spoke to the
students about government and the importance of participating in the
political process.
Minarets High School
On April 25th Congressman McClintock spoke to more than 150 students at
Roseville High School, answering questions about current issues and
discussing government.
Roseville High School
On April 26th Congressman McClintock spoke at a ceremony marking the
arrival of new gates for Folsom Dam's auxiliary spillway, which will
provide better and more efficient flood control.
The Congressman noted
that a "few months ago, Folsom Lake was almost empty.
The drought was
the catalyst, but the reason was unnecessary water releases from this
dam and a lack of additional water storage upstream.
For three days
this past week, knowing we are still facing a potentially devastating
water shortage this summer, water releases out of the dams on this
river tripled to meet environmental mandates that place the interests
of fish above those of people.
We cannot ask our people to scrimp and
save and stretch and ration every drop of water they use, while the
government treats that same water supply so recklessly and wastefully."

Budget
Congressman
McClintock
is
a
member
of
the
House
Budget
Committee.
This
month
he
participated
in
floor
and
committee
debate
in
support
of
the
2015
budget
bill.
In
remarks
delivered
on
the
House
floor
the
Congressman discussed
the
importance
of
balancing
the
budget.
He
also
discussed
the
prosperity,
security
and
future
of
the
nation:
2015
Budget
In
August
of
2010,
the
Chairman
of
the
Joint
Chiefs
warned
that
the
greatest
threat
to
our
national
security
was
our
national
debt.
That
was
$4
trillion
of
debt
ago.
In
fact,
since
Inauguration
day,
2009,
we
have
accumulated
more
total
government
debt
than
we
had
run
up
from
the
first
day
of
the
Washington
Administration
through
the
third
year
of
the
George
W.
Bush
Administration.
We
were
told
this
would
jump-start
the
economy.
It
hasn&#8217;t.
Instead,
it
has
deprived
markets
of
capital
that
would
otherwise
be
loaned
to
businesses
seeking
to
expand
jobs,
to
consumers
seeking
to
make
purchases
and
to
homebuyers
seeking
to
re-enter
the
housing
market.
I
would
remind
the
House
that
before
we
can
provide
for
the
common
defense
and
promote
the
general
welfare
we
have
to
be
able
to
pay
for
them,
and
the
ability
of
our
government
to
do
so
is
being
slowly,
surely
destroyed
by
our
debt.
Balancing
this
budget
and
ultimately
paying
down
the
national
debt
is
a
national
security
imperative;
it
is
an
economic
imperative;
and
it
is
a

imperative.

H.R.

The

before
the

is
whether
we
are
going
to
continue
to
ignore
the
economic
consequences
of
the

we

&#8211;
or
start
recognizing
that

that
the

What

1871 Baseline

Our
Constitution
assigns
the
principle
responsibility
over
the
public
purse
to
the
House
of
Representatives.
Under
that
Constitutional
doctrine,
a
dollar
can&#8217;t
be
spent
by
this
government
unless
the
House
says
it

Yet
today,
spending
increasingly
seems
to
be
out
of
our

&#8211;
driven
automatically
by
a
variety
of
provisions
and

that
thwart

Roughly
2/3

over
which

That&#8217;s
the
big
problem.
But
there
are
other
problems
as
well
that
this
bill
addresses.
One
of
them
is
the
current
process
by
which
we
calculate
the
baseline
from
which
we
start
our
annual
budget.
Any
family
would
begin
its
budget
process
by
asking,
for
example,
&#8220;What
did
we
spend
for
groceries
last
year?&#8221;
Once
it
has
that
baseline,
then
it
would
begin
to
adjust
for
changing
circumstances.
The
price
of
milk
is
going
up
&#8211;
should
we
cut
back
or
look
for
substitutes?
Or
should
we
cut

on
something
else
to
afford
that
increase?
That&#8217;s
the

This
