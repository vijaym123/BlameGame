This week, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio
continued his fight to protect Americans
from the adverse effects of ObamaCare. He
highlighted a Florida woman who faces
higher healthcare costs after losing her
doctors under her Medicare Advantage
plan. Marco and his colleagues sent a
letter to President Obama stating their
concerns with the ongoing negotiations in
Geneva regarding Irans illicit
nuclear program. The Senate Foreign
Relations Committee also approved a bill
that calls for increased accountability
of foreign aid. Marco hosted a
Constituent Coffee in his D.C. office
where he spent the morning visiting with
his constituents. For this and other news

Rubio Highlights Destin Woman Who
Lost Her Medicare Advantage Plan, Faces
Higher Costs
Marco delivered remarks on the Senate
floor highlighting the case of Michelle
Hatley, a Destin constituent who was
forced to change her Medicare Advantage
plan because ObamaCare regulations
resulted in her insurer removing a
medical center from her network. Ms.
Hatley is now paying more money on a new
plan that allows her to continue seeing
her six doctors.
Marco read some of her story on the
Senate floor:
Rubio: I wanted to
read briefly if I could a letter I
received from a constituent of mine
named Michelle Hatley who lives in
Destin, Florida, which is in Northwest
Florida. It is a letter she [sent us]
regarding her existing doctors. She
also got a letter from one of her
providers that talks about the changes.
Let me read you the e-mail. She sent
this:
My Medicare Advantage
plan was the Medicare Completer through
AARP and United Health Care. Three of
my doctors are with White Wilson and 3
are with Sacred Heart. My
rheumatologist, who directs my care for
treatment of two auto-immune conditions
is with Sacred Heart and the only
rheumatologist in Destin. Im
legally blind, so transport to another
doctor out of town is difficult to
arrange and expensive. Of the plans
that are available that will allow me
to keep my doctors, the annual
out-of-pocket is significantly higher
as well as the co-payments and
deductibles for patient visits,
prescription drugs, and inpatient care.
My choice has been reduced to finding
all new doctors or enrolling in a
different Medicare Advantage plan,
which will cost more. I wanted the
senator to be aware that Medicare
clients are experiencing negative
consequences from the ACA as
well.
This is a real life
story of a Medicare Advantage recipient
in this country whose out-of-pocket
costs are going up because of
ObamaCare. It is wrong. It is unfair.
It should not stand.

Rubio Comments On ObamaCare
Enrollment Numbers
Marco issued the following statement
regarding Wednesdays announcement
of ObamaCares enrollment
numbers:
Rubio: The abysmal ObamaCare
enrollment numbers are another early
warning sign that this legislation is
deeply flawed and ultimately cannot be
fixed. Only full repeal and replacement
can begin undoing the damage this law
has done to people who have lost their
health plans and doctors, and are
paying higher out of pocket costs.
There is a better way to help people
obtain high quality health care and
control costs, but ObamaCare is not
it.
Rubio, Colleagues Highlight Key
Concerns Over Iran Nuclear Offer
Marco and fellow U.S. Senators Mark
Kirk (R-IL), John Cornyn (R-TX) and Kelly
Ayotte (R-NH) sent a letter to President
Obama highlighting their specific
concerns with the current proposal being
negotiated in Geneva with regard to
Irans illicit nuclear program.
Senators on Current Geneva Offer:
In short, the American people
will facilitate the payment of $20
billion in hard currency to the
worlds leading sponsor of
terrorism and in return accept a more
advanced and dangerous Iranian nuclear
infrastructure.
A copy of the letter sent to the
President can be found
here .
As a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee and Select Committee
on Intelligence, Marco issued this
statement regarding Iran:
Rubio: No one who is serious
about preventing a nuclear-armed Iran
should be comforted by what transpired
this weekend in Geneva. After ten years
of talks that have been multilateral,
bilateral, secret and open, we should
expect more than just inconsequential
interim measures from Iran.
The urgency of the situation
and the significant progress Iran has
made in its nuclear efforts over the
last decade demand much more than what
the Obama administration appears
willing to accept. Iran continues to
refuse to meet the requirements of
multiple U.N. Security Council
resolutions and abandon its nuclear
weapons program. None of the steps Iran
reportedly has proposed will do much to
significantly postpone the possibility
of a nuclear-armed Iran even as the
U.S. and our partners would give up key
economic leverage with Tehran.
I am also concerned that in
our haste to endorse a flawed
arrangement with Iran, this
administration appears willing to
ignore the concerns of some of our
closest allies. We should be learning
from our experiences with other nuclear
rogues, such as North Korea, and not
repeat the same mistakes, which I fear
is the case here.
Given that Iran still
refuses to give up its enrichment and
reprocessing capabilities, I intend to
work with my colleagues in Congress to
pass additional sanctions as soon as
possible to continue to increase
pressure on Iran until it completely
abandons its nuclear weapons
program.
Foreign Relations Committee
Unanimously Approves Rubio Bill To
Increase Accountability Of Foreign
Aid
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee
unanimously approved S. 1271, The Foreign
Aid Transparency and Accountability Act
of 2013, a bill sponsored by Marco and
Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD). Among other
measures, the bill requires regular
evaluations of foreign assistance
programs to be made publicly available to
the American people.
The bill is now pending further action
by the full Senate.
As we see the ongoing
devastation in the Philippines, we are
again reminded of how important an
engaged America is for the
world,
said Rubio .
Foreign aid is a key pillar of
our nations foreign policy that
can advance our national interests. The
American people deserve more
information and answers about whether
these commitments abroad are worth the
sacrifice given our own domestic
challenges.
Now more than ever, these
programs need to include strong
accountability measures that would give
the American people confidence that
their money is being put to good use in
advancing American interests
abroad,
Rubio added .
The Foreign Aid Transparency and
Accountability Act of 2013 directs the
President to establish goals,
performance, and evaluation guidelines
for U.S. foreign assistance programs,
country assistance plans, and
international and multilateral assistance
programs.
Rubio: OAS Should Investigate
Venezuelas Detainment Of Miami
Herald Journalist As Chilling Effort
Against Press Freedom
Marco condemned the Venezuelan
government for its recent detainment of
Miami Herald reporter Jim Wyss, and
called on the Organization of American
States (OAS) to investigate the incident
as part of Venezuelas continued
violations of press freedom.
He issued the following statement:
Rubio: The Venezuelan
government is a chronic violator of
press freedom that must be held
accountable. Jim Wyss is now safely
home in the United States, but he
should never have been detained in the
first place.
Venezuela has routinely
violated the Inter-American Democratic
Charter to which it is a signatory, and
the OAS has a responsibility to hold
them accountable for it. The OAS should
begin an official investigation into
Jim Wysss case, and make clear
to all journalists in Venezuela and
across the western hemisphere that any
government that impedes their work will
have to answer for it.
At the end of the day,
Venezuelas inept leaders are
responsible for the countrys
rotten economy, rampant corruption and
its dubious distinction as one of the
murder capitals of the Americas.
Journalists simply inform the world
about whats going on, and we
should demand that they be able to work
freely and safely
everywhere.
This Week, Marco Enjoyed His Morning
Coffee With Constituents
On Thursday, Senator Rubio met with
more than 50 of his constituents who
signed up to join him for coffee and
snacks at his D.C. office. We thank them
for venturing to the nations
capital and spending some time discussing
issues of interest to them with the
Senator, his staff and fellow
Floridians.

Constituent Casework Corner
Yolanda applied for a passport and
paid the expedited fee for quick
processing. When she failed to hear from
the agency after three weeks, she
contacted Senator Rubio for assistance. A
member of the staff contacted the
National Passport Center and was told
they tried sending her several e-mails to
submit additional documentation that was
required to complete the process. Once
she complied with the request, Yolanda
received her passport one day later.

Agency Updates
IRS Warns of Pervasive Telephone
Scam
The Internal Revenue Service is warning
consumers about a sophisticated phone
scam targeting taxpayers, including
recent immigrants, throughout the
country. Victims are told they owe money
to the IRS and it must be paid promptly
through a pre-loaded debit card or wire
transfer. If the victim refuses to
cooperate, they are then threatened with
arrest, deportation or suspension of a
business or drivers license. In
many cases, the caller becomes hostile
and insulting.
Other characteristics of this scam
include:
Scammers use fake names and IRS
badge numbers. They generally use
common names and surnames to identify
themselves.
Scammers may be able to recite the
last four digits of a victims
Social Security Number.
Scammers spoof the IRS toll-free
number on caller ID to make it appear
that its the IRS calling.
Scammers sometimes send bogus IRS
emails to some victims to support their
bogus calls.
Victims hear background noise of
other calls being conducted to mimic a
call site.
After threatening victims with jail
time or drivers license
revocation, scammers hang up and others
soon call back pretending to be from
the local police or DMV, and the caller
ID supports their claim.
If you get a phone call from someone
claiming to be from the IRS, heres
what you should do:
If you know you owe taxes or you
think you might owe taxes, call the IRS
at
800-829-1040 .
The IRS employees at that line can help
you with a payment issue
if
there really is such an issue.
If you know you dont owe
taxes or have no reason to think that
you owe any taxes (for example,
youve never received a bill or
the caller made some bogus threats as
described above), then call and report
the incident to the
Treasury
Inspector General for Tax
Administration
at
800-366-4484 .
If youve been targeted by
this scam, you should also contact the
Federal Trade Commission and use their
FTC
Complaint Assistant
at
FTC.gov. Please add "IRS Telephone
Scam" to the comments of your
complaint.
Taxpayers should be aware that there
are other unrelated scams (such as a
lottery sweepstakes) and solicitations
(such as debt relief) that fraudulently
claim to be from the IRS. The IRS
encourages taxpayers to be vigilant
against phone and email scams that use
the IRS as a lure. The IRS does not
initiate contact with taxpayers by email
to request personal or financial
information. This includes any type of
electronic communication, such as text
messages and social media channels. The
IRS also does not ask for PINs, passwords
or similar confidential access
information for credit card, bank or
other financial accounts. Recipients
should not open any attachments or click
on any links contained in the message.
Instead, forward the e-mail to
phishing@irs.gov .

report
phishing scams
