A Message from Representative Sean Duffy
March 2, 2014
Dear friend,
While you work hard on the home front to provide for your family and
support our 7th District community, you have entrusted me to be your
voice in Congress. I do not take this task lightly, and this week, as
much as any other, I was very honored to do it. From standing-up for
our Veterans to protecting your right to privacy, keep reading for a
wrap-up of the week that was.
Our Veterans deserve better service from the country they proudly
served: Currently, many Veterans seeking assistance from the Department
of Veterans Affairs are waiting nearly a year for their claim to be
addressed and often more than two years for their appeals to be
resolved. This is absolutely unacceptable.
This week I hosted a bipartisan roundtable with our Wisconsin
delegation and representatives from the VA to find out what exactly is
going on within the VA, why these claims are not being processed more
quickly and what we can do to resolve this problem. I discussed the
issue and the meeting with Fox's Brian Kilmeade on his radio program.

A bipartisan vote to protect your privacy: In a strong bipartisan vote
of 232-182, on Thursday the House passed my bill, H.R. 3193, the
Consumer Financial Freedom and Washington Accountability Act, and sent
a strong message to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
(CFPB)
that is it time to rein in this dangerously powerful and unaccountable
agency.
During debate, I argued that this is a bill about accountability and
transparency. CFPB Director Richard Cordray claims that in order for
the agency to do their job, they must monitor 80% of all credit cards
in circulation, or nearly one billion credit cards! One provision in
this bill would require the CFPB to first ask the American people's
permission before accessing their personal information. This is the
right thing to do. This bill will empower Congress and the American
people, reform the CFPB and actually make it work. Click on the image

continued privilege of being your voice in Congress.
Have a great week,
Sean

Dear
friend,
While
you
work
hard
on
the
home
front
to
provide
for
your
family
and
support
our
7 th
District
community,
you
have

Congress.
I
do
not
take
this

and
this
week,
as
much
as
any
other,
I
was
very
honored
to
do
it.
From
standing-up

our
Veterans
to
protecting
your
right

privacy,
keep
reading
for
a

was&#8230;

deserve
