Subject: agonizing defeat
It&rsquo;s been a
rough
few days:
-- first, a right-wing Super PAC launched a deceptive ad campaign targeting Cheri.
-- then, ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling piled on with a MASSIVE television ad buy.
But today, things got even worse: -- Boehner just began a
$2,24O,OOO
assault against Illinois Democrats.
David, there&rsquo;s no time to lose.
We can get back on track -- and hand Boehner an agonizing defeat -- but only if we hit our ad buy goal before midnight tomorrow.
Will you chip in $5 or $10 to help close the gap?
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks,
