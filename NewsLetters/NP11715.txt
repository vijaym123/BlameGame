Video Address Text
Hi, Im Robert Hurt. Thank
you for tuning into our Monthly Video
Address.
As always, it is an honor to
represent the people of Virginias
Fifth District, and I appreciate the
opportunity to share with you some of what
we have been working on during the month of
February.
In February, we saw the release
of a Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
report that revealed a number of troubling
findings on our economy, our
governments finances, and,
ultimately, the future for our children and
grandchildren. The report found that the
Presidents health care law will have
a significant and negative impact on our
economy over the next ten years by
encouraging Americans not to work,
estimating that it will result in the
equivalent of 2.5 million Americans leaving
the full-time workforce. The CBO report
also informs us that our deficit and debt
problems remain very serious. Though
revenues have been higher, the days of
trillion dollar deficits will return if we
do not change course. In fact, at the
current pace our debt will grow to $27
trillion in the next ten years. Now is the
time to come together to forge solutions to
ensure the financial stability of our
nation and future generations.
In addition, the Obama
administration announced a delay of the
employer mandate for a second year, proving
once again that the presidents
health care law is bad for the American
people. While this delay provides relief
for small and mid-sized businesses,
unfortunately, individuals and families
that do not receive healthcare through
their employers remain on the hook for the
laws mandates. Working Americans
should be given the same reprieve from the
presidents healthcare law that
businesses will receive.
On a positive note, I am pleased
to report that I had the opportunity to
travel throughout our district as a part of
National Future Farmers of America (FFA)
Week. I spent the FFA Week visiting FFA
chapters throughout the Fifth District,
hearing from students about issues of
importance to them. National FFA week is
celebrated annually in conjunction with
George Washingtons birthday and
honors his legacy. Agriculture is the
backbone of our economy in Virginia, and it
was a pleasure to have the opportunity to
meet with these future leaders about the
future of agriculture.
We also had the opportunity to
attend a ceremony at Fort Myer where Arthur
Ordel of Albemarle County and Robert Sales
of Amherst County received the French
Legion of Honor as a token of gratitude for
helping liberate France from Nazi German
occupation. They were among six World War
II veterans awarded this medal by the
President of France. I extend sincere
congratulations to Mr. Ordel and Mr. Sales,
and I am grateful for the sacrifices they
and so many others have made in service of
our country.
I look forward to continuing to
work to put forth policies that will grow
our economy, create jobs, and provide for a
brighter future for our nation, and I am
grateful for the opportunity to represent
you in Washington.
As we close, I encourage you to
sign up for frequent updates at our website
at
hurt.house.gov
and join the conversation on our social
media pages. Again, thank you for tuning in
to our monthly video address.
Robert met with Margrete Stevens (left),
Karen Blair (center), and Carol Carter (far
right) of the Albemarle chapter of the
National Garden Club of America.
Robert met with Matthew Reilly of
Palmyra, who won the Trout Unlimited Essay
Contest with his piece on the value of
public lands for fishing and
hunting.
Sincerely,
Washington, DC
