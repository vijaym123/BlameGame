Dear Friend:
I&#39;m working hard in Congress to address important safety issues facing families in the Lower Hudson Valley. Here&#39;s how I&#39;ve been fighting for you&#58;
&#8226;
Investing in our nation&#39;s
transportation infrastructure
&#8226;
Working to
remove highly&#45;volatile crude oil
from our railway networks
&#8226;
Calling for
increased safety at Indian Point
&#8226;
Preventing sexual assault
on college campuses
Investing in our nation&#39;s transportation infrastructure
My heart aches for families who lost loved ones in the fatal Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia&#44; and I pray for the swift recovery of those injured in the accident. It&#39;s clear we need to invest more in rail safety. The day after the accident&#44; I voted for an amendment that would reverse reckless cuts that prevent Amtrak from implementing safety upgrades that could have prevented this accident according to NTSB investigators&#44; and I was successful in passing an amendment that would increase federal funding for
rail grade crossing improvements
. Failure to invest in road and rail infrastructure is not just unwise &#45; it is plainly a public safety hazard. As Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee&#44; I will continue fighting to improve our nation&#39;s transportation infrastructure.
Working to remove highly-volatile crude oil from our railway networks
No one should have to live with dangerously explosive materials rumbling through their back yards. With upwards of 80 tank cars carrying crude oil through Rockland County each day&#44; it&#39;s more important than ever to improve safety for homes&#44; schools&#44; and businesses near the tracks. That&#39;s why I announced in West Nyack a new bill that would
immediately ban interstate shipment
of the most volatile forms of crude oil. As Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee&#44; I will continue fighting to ensure the safe transport of hazardous materials via rail.
I was joined by William Barbera from the Rockland County Sheriff&#39;s Office&#44; Riverkeeper President Paul Gallay&#44; concerned West Nyack parent Sarah McTasney&#44; Elijah Reichlin-Melnick from Orangetown Supervisor Andy Stewart&#39;s office&#44; Town of Clarkstown Supervisor Alex Gromack&#44; and Scenic Hudson Environmental Advocacy Attorney Hayley Carlock in West Nyack to announce my legislation that would ban interstate rail shipment of high&#45;volatility crude oil.
Calling for increased safety at Indian Point
The long list of concerns at Indian Point weighs heavily on the minds of families and businesses in the Lower Hudson Valley. When a transformer fire caused a shutdown of one of the facility&#39;s reactors&#44; I called on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission &#40;NRC&#41; to
not renew Indian Point&#39;s license
for their reactors&#44;
conduct an investigation of the fire&#44;
and release information pertaining to fire safety exemptions provided to the facility. I also re&#45;introduced
two pieces of legislation
that would create an emergency preparedness grant program and stringent criteria for re&#45;licensing old nuclear power plants. It is vital that everything possible be done to ensure the safety of the surrounding area.
Preventing sexual assault on college campuses
No student should have to fear sexual assault on a college campus&#44; and parents deserve peace of mind that children away at college are as safe as possible. We must work together to make sure that institutions of higher learning have the resources to protect students. I was at Pace University with New York Lt. Governor Kathy Hochul and Pace University administrators and students for a roundtable discussion on Governor Andrew Cuomo&#39;s &#34;Enough is Enough&#34; campaign&#44; where I
announced
my co&#45;sponsorship of the Campus Accountability and Safety Act in the House. I will fight to increase resources for federal initiatives to support survivors and prevent sexual crimes and to ensure that students have the ability to study in safe environments.
I joined Pace University Interim Dean of Students Rachel Carpenter&#44; New York Lt. Governor Kathy Hochul&#44; and Pace University administrators and students for a roundtable discussion on Governor Cuomo&#39;s &#34;Enough is Enough&#34; campaign&#44; where I announced
actions I&#39;m taking
at the federal level to prevent sexual assault among college students.
