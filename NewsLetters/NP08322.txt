David,
We had an amazing time this Sunday!
Congresswomen Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Jan Schakowsky took time out of their busy schedules to join more than 300 supporters for our fourth Women for Brad event.
It was our biggest and best Women for Brad so far, helping build tremendous support for my re-election campaign. David, if you weren&rsquo;t able to attend and would like to make a donation, or if you&rsquo;d like to boost your support, please use this personalized link to send a contribution of any amount. http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/Women-for-Brad
Thanks again to everyone who made this event such a big success.
Brad
