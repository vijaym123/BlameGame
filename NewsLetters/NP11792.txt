Background:
In July, Senators Heller and Casey
announced the formation of the
VA Backlog Working
Group . The Working Group provides a
forum for lawmakers, veterans, and Veterans
Service Organizations (VSOs) to tackle the
disability claim backlog. The March 2014
Report is a product of input from these
groups, and provides a broad guideline for
areas of improvement that can help shape a
more efficient system. Senators Jerry Moran
(R-KS) and Martin Heinrich (D-NM) are also
cosponsors of the 21st Century Veterans
Benefits Delivery Act.
Details of the 21st Century Veterans
Benefits Delivery Act:
Whereas the VA Backlog Working Group
March 2014 Report identifies problems in
current processes, the 21
st
Century Veterans Benefits
Delivery Act aims to provide a
comprehensive solution. The bill is divided
into three sections:
Title I
Benefits Claims
Submission.
This section is designed to
encourage, assist, and educate veterans on
the benefits of submitting a completed
claim, when possible, as well as reinforce
the services available to help a veteran
complete a claim.
Includes proposals to improve
veterans access to information
about the claims process;
Provides Veterans Service
Organizations and veterans
preferred secondary contact with better
access to information;
Authorizes monetary benefits to
incentivize developed claims
submission.
Title II - Reforming Practices of
Regional Offices.
Personnel and
management must be given tools to perform
efficiently. This section requires the
Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) to
make structural changes that increase
accuracy and efficiency at the regional
office level in the following ways:
Calls for audit of regional offices
of the Veterans Benefits
Administration;
Ensures improved accountability and
oversight of VARO management;
Provides resources to VBA employees
and implements changes in process that
allows VBA employees to move claims
through the electronic benefits awards
structure more efficiently;
Improves transparency to the public
on the size and scope of the current
backlog.
Title III - Government Response.
This section holds the government
accountable and helps to ensure the claims
process is a priority.
Demands greater cooperation from
federal agencies to transfer requested
information;
Presses VBA employees to process
information it receives from these
agencies in a timely fashion.
