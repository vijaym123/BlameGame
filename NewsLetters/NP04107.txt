Immigration
Action
Last week, President Barack Obama unveiled a number
of steps his Administration is taking to address our nations broken
immigration system.
I strongly support the Presidents decision,
and I wanted to provide you with information about the two changes that
will impact the greatest number of people.
For each of these
changes, successful applicants will be granted relief from deportation
for three years, in addition to other
benefits.
A.
Deferred Action for Parents
(DAP)
Deferred Action
for Parents would allow
on a case-by-case basis
temporary relief for
parents of U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident children.
The cost of applying for DAP status will be $465
a $380 filing fee
and an $85 fee for biometric services (fingerprints and
photo).
Generally, applicants for DAP must
meet the following criteria:
1.
Must be present in the U.S. on
November 20 th , 2014 and on the date DAP status is
requested.
2.
Must have continuously resided in the U.S. since before January
1 st , 2010.
3.
Must have a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident
child as of November 20 th , 2014.
4.
Must not have a record
of a prior felony conviction, significant or multiple misdemeanor
convictions, or otherwise pose a threat to national security or public
safety.
The Obama
Administration intends to begin accepting applications for DAP status within 180
days.
I will work to provide you with additional information
about the application process as soon as I receive
it.
B.
Deferred Action for
Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Expansion
The DACA expansion would provide temporary relief for
individuals brought into the U.S. as children.
As with DAP status,
these determinations will be made on a case-by-case basis, and the
total cost will be $465
a $380 filing fee and an $85 fee for biometric
services.
Generally,
applicants for expanded DACA must meet the following criteria:
1.
Must have
arrived in the U.S. as a child under 16 years of age.
2.
Must have
continuously resided in the U.S. since January 1 st ,
2010.
3.
Must
be currently enrolled or have graduated from or obtained a certificate
of completion from high school, have obtained a G.E.D., or have been
honorably discharged by the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United
States.
4.
Must not have a record of a prior felony conviction,
significant or multiple misdemeanor convictions, or otherwise pose a threat to
national security or public safety.
The Obama Administration intends to begin accepting
applications for expanded DACA status within 90 days.
I will be sure to
provide you with details about how to apply once I have additional
information.
C.
BEWARE OF NOTARIO FRAUD &amp; OTHER IMMIGRATION
SCAMS
Only a licensed lawyer or
accredited representative can assist you with immigration paperwork in
the United States.
However, some scammers have tried to take
advantage of confusion over the term notario publico, which in Latin
American countries indicates special legal credentials.
In the
United States, notary publics are not authorized to give legal advice or
provide immigration services.
Do not pay a notary to assist you
or your family with immigration paperwork.
To learn more about
this and other common immigration scams, please visit
http://www.uscis.gov/avoid-scams/common-scams .
It is
important to note that neither DAP nor DACA provide immigration status or
a pathway to citizenship.
The policies provide a temporary
shield to deportation so that Congress has the ability to pass real
comprehensive immigration reform that includes a pathway to citizenship for
undocumented persons.
I will work closely with other
members of Congress to pass meaningful reform, and I will provide
additional detail on other changes to our immigration policy in future
newsletters.
If you have questions about these new policies or
about how to apply for relief when the time comes, I encourage you to
contact my district office at (773)506-7100,or visit
