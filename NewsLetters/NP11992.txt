Members of the National Barley Growers Association (NBGA) visited with me about farm safety net provisions in the Farm Bill, as well as other issues that impact their producers.

Senators Klobuchar, Heitkamp, Hoeven, and Franken
Senator Heitkamp hosted a meeting with the representatives of the Red River Valley to discuss the Fargo Moorhead Diversion project. In attendance from Minnesota were Senators Klobuchar and Franken, Moorhead Mayor Del Rae Williams, and Moorhead City Administrator Mike Redlinger. North Dakota was represented by Senators Hoeven and Heitkamp, Congressman Cramer, Mayor Mahoney, Fargo City Administrator Pat Zavoral, Cass County Administrator Keith Berndt and Cass County Commissioner Darrell Vanyo.
During the meeting we discussed the stalled Water Resources Development Act, FEMA flood insurance problems, and other water-related concerns. I think everyone left the meeting understanding the hurdles this project must overcome in order to move forward.

Rep. Peterson&#8217;s Newsletter 2/28/2014
Dear Friends,
Congress is back in session this week and I was honored to meet with barley growers, potato farmers, and sugarbeet growers from Minnesota who traveled to Washington, D.C. I joined Minnesota
Senators Klobuchar and Franken, North Dakota Senators Hoeven and Heitkamp, and Moorhead/Fargo local elected officials for a meeting about the Fargo Moorhead Diversion project. Access to public television is important for rural Minnesotans, and I met with Prairie
Public Television to talk about increasing accessibility. I also met with Natural Resources Conservation Service Chief Jason Weller about the implementation of the Farm Bill. The CEO of 4-H came by to talk about the active youth organization, and the Peace
Corps is celebrating its 53rd Anniversary.
Sincerely ,
