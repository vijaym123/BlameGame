Dear Friend, Each month, I record a
video address that recaps what we've been
working on the previous month. Video and text
of April's Monthly Video Address are
available below. You may view the video by

Hi, Im Robert Hurt. Thank
you for tuning into our Monthly Video Address
for the month of April.
Today, I am at the Jefferson
Memorial in Washington. On April 13th, we
recognized what would have been the 272nd
anniversary of the birth of Thomas Jefferson.
Jefferson was not only our third president,
but was also the author of our Declaration of
Independence and Virginia's Statute for
Religious Freedom, and he was the founder of
the University of Virginia. Jefferson was an
indispensable leader in the founding of this
great nation and left his mark on nearly
every foundational element of our republic.
He promoted religious freedom and public
education, believing both were fundamental to
the success of our newly minted democracy. I
would encourage all of my constituents --
especially our students -- to visit the
Jefferson Memorial in the near future. You
will not be disappointed.
As for Fifth District news, during
the month of April, I was pleased to travel
across the district and meet with nearly
300
local elected officials . It was good to
touch base with those who share the
responsibility in representing the two
cities, 21 counties, and 39 towns that make
up Virginias Fifth District. Thomas
Jefferson believed government works best when
it is closest to the people, and we are
fortunate to be represented by dedicated
public servants at the state and local level.
It is an honor to work alongside these local
leaders to serve the fine people we
represent, and I thank them for their
service.
Additionally this month,
Fifth
District Virginians filed their tax
returns
and were again reminded just how
complex and outdated our current tax code is.
Indeed, a perfect example of how Washington
is making life unnecessarily difficult and
standing in the way of economic growth. On
April 15,
the
House of Representatives passed several
bipartisan bills
to make the IRS more
transparent and accountable. I was proud to
support each of these measures and pleased to
see them pass the House with wide bipartisan
support.
Also, in April the Obama
administration, and the nations of China,
France, Germany, Russia, and the United
Kingdom, reached a preliminary agreement with
Iran relating to its nuclear program. The
prospect of Iran attaining the capability to
produce a nuclear weapon is one of the most
grave threats we face as a nation, and it
must be our policy to do everything within
our power to prevent this from happening.
Given its nuclear ambitions and history,
I
am skeptical that Iran will act in good
faith
and adhere to any of the terms of a
deal. I will continue to monitor this
situation as we approach the June 30
deadline, and I remain committed to working
with my colleagues to ensure that Congress is
a meaningful participant in any final
agreement that is reached.
Finally, in April,
I
introduced the Small Company Disclosure
Simplification Act , which would
streamline regulations for small public
companies and thereby remove dis-incentives
for companies to access capital in the public
markets. Over-regulation of small businesses
undoubtedly stands in the way of job creation
across Virginia. The costs associated with
our current regulatory climate have a
negative effect on small companies -- our
most dynamic job creators. I look forward to
working with my colleagues on the Financial
Services Committee to pass this bill so that
we may remove unnecessary, bureaucratic red
tape and allow small businesses to strengthen
our economy.
As we close, let us remember Thomas
Jefferson for his great contributions to the
Commonwealth of Virginia and our great
nation, and please let us know if we may ever
be of assistance to you in planning a visit
to our nation's capital.
If we may ever be of service to you
in any other way, I encourage you to contact
us at
one
of our district offices
or at our
Washington office. We can always be reached
at our website at
hurt.house.gov
-- where you can also sign up for regular
legislative updates. And don't forget to join
the conversation on our social media
pages.
Once again, thank you for tuning in
to our monthly video address.
Sincerely,
Washington, DC
