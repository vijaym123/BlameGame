Dear Friend,
On Wednesday, my beautiful wife of more than 50 years, Alma, and I attended the 92nd Street Y's weekly Ballet for Older Dancers Class to promote the 22nd annual National Senior Health &amp; Fitness Day.
Unfortunately, I couldn't dance because they didn't have shoes in my size, but I was more than happy to encourage Alma and other dancers to continue staying fit.

Honoring Sgt. Henry Johnson, Medal of Honor Recipient
Sergeant Henry Johnson epitomizes a true American hero. As a black soldier, he never saw the accolades he deserved. I thank President Obama for awarding him the nation's highest honor posthumously, and am honored to belong to the 369th Harlem Helllfighter Veterans' Association, which proudly bears his regiment's name.
Moratorium on Luxury Housing
On Friday May 29, 2015, I led a rally with local elected officials and community leaders at City Hall in NYC to demand the creation of affordable housing units. Ensuring all of New York City's citizens have a comfortable and safe place to live has always been my priority. That's why I am calling for a moratorium on new luxury housing developments. We most focus more resources on making sure our City is a place in which everyone can live, not just the few.
