LEGISLATION
May 31, 2015
Dear
David,
Last week
on Memorial Day, America honored our fallen heroes, those who paid
the ultimate sacrifice. Each and every one of us is indebted to these
men and women and their families for the freedom we enjoy. While we can
never repay them for their sacrifice, we can make the necessary
reforms to take care of our veterans and their families.
The
House recently passed several measures to improve services to veterans.
One measure,
H.R. 474 , would
reauthorize an important program that assists homeless veterans. During the
last couple of years the number of homeless veterans has been
declining thanks to programs like HUD-VASH, a joint effort between the
Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development. This
program provides homeless veterans with housing assistance and a
caseworker to help them identify other VA benefits that they may be eligible
for, and has directly assisted veterans in Chico and Redding. I am proud
to support this bill and will always advocate for smart and effective
programs that help our veterans.
Below are some recent
highlights from DC and around our district. To stay in touch with me
throughout the week and to share your thoughts with me, follow me on
Facebook
and email me via my
website .
Sincerely,
