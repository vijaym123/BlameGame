Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinens OpEd Featured in
the Washington Times:
Congress must counter efforts
to delegitimize Israel
Every nation
has the right and the obligation to defend itself and its citizens
against unwarranted and unprovoked attacks. If the United States were
being hit with rockets from our neighbors, we would expect the president
to respond appropriately to defend us.
Yet there is this double standard when it comes
to
Israel .
When
Israel
is attacked, its
Israel
that
is met with international
opprobrium.

Miami Herald
-- Cuba escapes UN sanctions in North
Korean weapons transport scheme
Its unacceptable
that even as the (UNSC) sanctioned the North Korean firm that
operated the vessel carrying illegal arms from Cuba, it failed to similarly
hold the Cuban regime accountable for its role in this flagrant
violation of U.N. sanctions, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen said in a statement
Tuesday.

Miami
Herald
-- U.S. imposes travel restrictions on Venezuelan
officials
U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) called
Wednesdays sanctions long overdue but said they need to be
tougher.
Not only should we deny visas to [President Nicols]
Maduros cronies but we should also expand those visa restrictions to
immediate family members of human rights violators and freeze their assets
and property in the U.S., she said in a statement. Only by hitting the
thugs of the Maduro regime in their pocketbooks will there be a real
opportunity to help foster a new era in
Venezuela.

The Hill
--
House passes resolution to condemn Hamas for Israel rocket
attacks
Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), the bill's sponsor, said the
resolution would demonstrate U.S. support for Israel in light of the
United Nations report.
"So if
the U.N. Security Council will not act and not use its voice, that is
why it is so important for the House of Representatives to pass this
resolution, to not only stand up for the Palestinian people who have
been made pawns in Hamas mission to destroy Israel, to their detriment,
but for Israel, in the face of this biased anti-Israel agenda,"
Ros-Lehtinen said.

Miami New
Times
--
I leana Ros-Lehtinen on Neglect Scandal: Miami VA Needs to
Stop "Shifting Blame"
Yesterday, New
Times published the second part of our series Hell on the Home
Front, a profile of Iraq War vet Nicholas Cutter and the poor treatment
he received at the Miami Veterans Affairs
hospital.
The story of how Cutter's death inside the VA was allegedly covered up
has touched a nerve in a nation still reeling from news of secret VA
waiting lists. As politicians in D.C. try to pass legislation to solve
the VA crisis, several lawmakers have told New Times of
their outrage over Cutter's death.
"Our veterans deserve
a better VA than one that is satisfied with piecemeal solutions and
shifts blame to external factors," said Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. "None
of that matters to veterans who have to wait for appointments and
who, at times, encounter an indifferent staff."

Ros-Lehtinen: Visa Denials of Venezuelan Officials Responsible for
Human Rights Violations is Not Enough; Administration Must Enact Full
Penalties Against Maduro Thugs
(Washington, DC)
U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Chairman of the Middle East and
North Africa Subcommittee, made the following statement on the
announcement by the State Department that Venezuelan regime officials will be
denied visas to enter the United States. Statement by
Ros-Lehtinen:
"Denying visas to Venezuelan officials is a good step
forward but this action is long overdue and does not go far enough. Not only
should we deny visas to Maduros cronies but we should also expand
those visa restrictions to immediate family members of human rights
violators and freeze their assets and property in the U.S. In the
aftermath of the Venezuelan regime pulling out all the stops to protect and
give a safe haven to a notorious narco-trafficker.

Working to Improve Veteran Care, Ros-Lehtinen Supports VA Reform
Bill
(Miami, Florida)
Congresswoman Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen announced her support of the Veterans Access, Choice and
Accountability Act of 2014.
While this bill is a positive step
forward for our veterans, it is unfortunate that any reform package,
especially one full of commonsense reforms, was needed in the first
place. After years of mismanagement, I am pleased the VA will have the
power to fire deficient employees and ensure veterans have an
alternative to longer than 30 day wait times for an appointment. However, we
must ensure that the Miami VA and the national VA are consistently held
accountable for their failure in care and leadership. Our veterans
have sacrificed so much for our nation, the very least we can do is
ensure our heroes receive the care they
deserve.

House of
Representatives Passes Resolution Denouncing the Use of Human Shields
by Hamas, Stands in Solidarity with
Israel
(Washington, DC)
U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Chairman of the
Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee, made the following
statement regarding the passage of H. Con. Res. 107, denouncing the use of
civilians as human shields by Hamas and other terrorist organizations in
violation of international humanitarian law. The measure was passed by
unanimous consent by the House of Representatives. Statement by
Ros-Lehtinen:
Hamas stores its rockets and weapons underneath
the homes of Palestinians and in now at least three schools run by
the UN Relief and Works Agency and it has been using the Palestinian
men, women and children as human shields, in violation of international
humanitarian law, by placing its missile batteries in densely populated
areas and near schools, hospitals and mosques.

United Nations Security Council Failure to Hold Cuban
Officials Accountable for Their Role in Illegal Chong Chon Gang Arms
Shipment is Spineless
(Washington, DC)
U.S. Rep. Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Chairman of the Middle East and North Africa
Subcommittee, made the following statement on the failure of the UN
Security Council to hold Cuban officials accountable for their role in the
illegal Chong Chon Gang arms shipment despite overwhelming evidence
that Cuba assisted North Korea in an attempt to circumvent several UN
Security Council resolutions. Ros-Lehtinen urged U.S. Ambassador to the
UN Samantha Power to work to ensure that Cuban officials are designated
sanctions violators. Statement by
Ros-Lehtinen:
Its unacceptable that even as the UN Security Council sanctioned the
North Korean firm that operated the vessel carrying illegal arms from
Cuba, it failed to similarly hold the Cuban regime accountable for its
role in this flagrant violation of UN sanctions. The Panel of Experts
responsible for investigating this violation, as well as Ambassador
Power, have made clear that Cuba had an integral role in this
transgression.

USAID Programs Seek to Promote
Democracy in Cuba While Castro Regime Continues to Deny Cuban People Basic
Human Rights, Says
Ros-Lehtinen
"The fact that USAID is using measures to promote
democracy in Cuba is no secret. We must continue to pressure the Castro regime
and support the Cuban people, who are oppressed on a daily basis. I
wish the press would dedicate more of their time to reporting the
rampant human rights abuses in Cuba perpetrated by the Castro regime
instead of manipulating the coverage of programs promoting freedom of
expression and justice on the island."
