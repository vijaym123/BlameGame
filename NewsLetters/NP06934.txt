Helping Kansans Get Back to Work
The
Fourth Annual 3rd District Job Fair and
Resource Expo
was a great success with a remarkable turnout from
both employers and potential employees.
More than 100
employers turned out to fill hundreds of job openings
at the Great
Mall of the Great Plains in Olathe on Thursday. A wide range
of
job opportunities
were available in dozens of
industries including health care, education, engineering, freight and
trucking, information technology, finance, military service and law
enforcement, hospitality, and many more. A special
thank you
to
all the employers who participated and met with hundreds of
interested job seekers.

after
their service to our country and I applaud the participating
employers for hiring veterans.
Thank you to
Workforce
Partnership
for coordinating with my office, the
Olathe Chamber of
Commerce , and to the

location and space for everyone to meet.
Kansas Hospital Association Roundtable
Thank you to Ken
Bacon, President and CEO,
Shawnee Mission
Health , and Tom Bell, President,
Kansas Hospital Association , for hosting a
roundtable discussion with hospital leaders from across the metro area on

Tomorrow - Town Hall Forum Focusing on
Federal Funding for Critical Research
Join me at my town
hall forum
tomorrow, August 19 at 10 a.m. in Overland
Park . The discussion will take place in
Regnier Hall
Auditorium at the KU Edwards campus
and focus on the importance
of
critical federal funding for life-saving
research .
The event is
open to the
public
and I encourage everyone to attend and join the
conversation with national, regional, local experts including
Dr.
Christopher Austin, M.D., and Director of the National Center for Advancing
Translational Sciences from the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) , who will highlight the role of the NIH and the impact NIH
research efforts have in Kansas.
The
discussion will emphasize the role, value, and importance of federal
biomedical and scientific research , as well as the
impact of this research on the local economy and Kansans fighting
life-altering disease and disability.
As a strong supporter and
advocate for biomedical research , I believe the NIH research-taking
place at the
University of
Kansas Hospita l and by local entrepreneurs is having a
positive impact on the health and life of Kansans across the
state.
I hope this forum will allow everyone
a chance to weigh in on the value of federal research in our efforts
to improve and save lives.

3 rd
District Veterans
Advisory Committee
Listening to
veterans
in the 3 rd
District is extremely
important to me.
Tuesday, at
VFW Post #846
in
Overland Park, I heard from my
Veterans Advisory Committee
about the issues they are facing with the VA.
We discussed the
Veteran's
Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014
that I
supported and was recently signed into law. This new law represents major
reforms to improve access to quality care for our veterans. Protecting
the hard earned benefits the brave men and women who served our
country fought for is one of my top priorities.
A special thank you to these vets for their
service to our country and for informing me about their issues with the VA.
I look forward to our next meeting.
Fairfax
Industrial Association Meeting in KCK
I
appreciated the opportunity to visit with the
Fairfax Industrial Association (FIA)
Thursday
afternoon in Kansas City, KS.
We discussed the unfunded
mandates being pushed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that
would increase a typical Wyandotte citizens electric bill nearly 20
percent and force the BPU to spend $250 million.
I talked about
the legislation I introduced,
H.R. 4654 the Lower Electric Bill Act of 2014 , which
would delay these new rules for 5 years so we can study the economic
impact these regulations. Read more about what I discussed during my visit
here .

efforts to stop harmful regulations that would hinder businesses and
job growth to the

Industrial Association (FIA)

General Motors Fairfax Assembly Plant

Chamber of Commerce
Updates Around the 3rd District
It is always nice
to be home and listen to
small businesses and local
leaders
in our community. Last week I addressed the
Overland Park Chamber of Commerce
and the
Shawnee Chamber of
Commerce . Both meetings had great conversations focused
on the many issues facing Congress from
transportation funding
and the illegal immigration crisis, to the
need
for
entitlement reform.
I enjoyed our discussions
on
the need for long-term solutions
and look forward
to working together to
improve and grow the
economy.

Letter to the Editor - NIH
Forum
Read my
letter to the
editor
on the importance of federal funding for critical
research from Sunday's
Kansas
City Star .
Health care
forum
I invite you to join me for a town hall forum on
Tuesday at the University of Kansas Edwards Campus for a discussion on the
importance of critical federal funding for lifesaving
research.
As a congressman, I frequently meet
with patients and groups fighting for scientific breakthroughs to
ease their suffering. As they advocate for solutions, its my job to
advocate for them.
Each year, we
spend less than 1 percent of our federal budget on funding for the
National Institutes of
Health.
These precious resources come back to our communities and employ
world-class researchers at KU and other universities around the
country.
As our nation is challenged with
how to combat rising health-care costs, funding for disease
prevention and treatment is critical to future health-care savings. In an
effort to juggle deficit reduction with investments in our future, our
government must reprioritize spending away from wasteful bureaucracy in
Washington and toward spending on critical biomedical research that can
make a difference in each of our
lives.
Visit my website for more information:
www.yoder.house.gov . I hope you can
attend.

Yoder

Autism CARES Act Signed into Law
The Autism CARES Act of 2014
was signed
into law last Friday.
Im a proud
original
cosponsor
of this legislation that authorizes increased research,
treatment, and training programs and services through the National Institutes
of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Over the last
eight years, the prevalence of autism has increased more than 100
percent. Im glad the Senate passed the legislation and the President signed
the
Autism CARES Act
into law
before the current law expires September 30.
