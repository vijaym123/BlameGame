Leading Others to
Success
Edwards most memorable experience took place in Washington D.C.
where she attended the annual Job Corps Policy Forum. She had the honor
of meeting U.S. Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. When the
Congresswoman walked into the room it instantly got brighter. I got an
unbelievable spark of energy from her presence remembered Edwards. Walking

Fighting For Our
Children, Ros-Lehtinen Supports Bills That Work To Keep Our Kids
Healthy
September 9, 2014
"I'm proud to support these important bills
that work to keep our children healthy by ensuring medical attention is
available to those who most desperately need it and by trying to
understand the root cause of early death. Only by working to ensure our
children are healthy can we ensure a bright future for our nation. No
child should have to endure terrible illness without recourse nor have
their life cut traigcally short by
disease."

Ros-Lehtinen Will Present Bill Today, September 8th,That Honors
Local Hero Killed in Afghanistan While Serving Our
Country
September 8, 2014
I am proud to dedicate a post
office for our local hero, Christian A. Guzman Rivera, who made
the ultimate sacrifice for us all. Christians selfless dedication to
our country shows the commitment that he had to ensuring we live in
freedom and we will forever be indebted to him for his service. His
example of dedication to his country during one of our most trying times is
one that every young person should seek to emulate. While it
would have been easier to choose a life closer to home, Christian sought
to make a difference in this world and served his country honorably.
For his intentions and sacrifices, we are forever grateful. Dedicating
a post office for him will not bring this hero back; it is but a small
measure of gratitude from a thankful community for the ultimate
sacrifice Christian made for all of us.

House panel urged to probe Turkish, Qatari support of
Hamas
In an initial statement to the House Foreign
Affairs joint subcommittee, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) criticized
Turkey for providing financial, material and political support for
Hamas, a US-designated foreign terrorist organization, complaining
that it has been doing so for years, without
repercussions.
She also critiqued Qatar
the very same Qatar
that the administration entrusted to monitor the Taliban 5, who were
swapped for Sergeant [Bowe] Bergdahl, and which it recently agreed to an
$11 billion arms sale with as also having been known to be perhaps
Hamas largest financial patron.

Not Much Debate As Congress Girds For War With
ISIS
"I support a very vigorous action against [the Islamic State] because,
if not, our U.S. national security interests are at stake," said Rep.
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), who chairs the House Foreign Affairs
Subcommittee on Middle East and North
Africa.

Islamic State takes pressure off
Iran
"For all that we know of the relationship between
Iran and these terrorist groups, the administration has ignored all of
this in pursuit of its weak nuclear deal with Iran," Middle East panel
chairwoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., said in her opening
comments
at
the hearing. "In fact, the Iranian regimes support for terror, its
ballistic missile program or its human rights record arent even on the
table in these negotiations, so while we continue to give away the
store, we strengthen and legitimize Iran and embolden other actors who see
just how naive we truly are being to this
threat."

As
Long As Hamas Remains a Terrorist Organization, There Can Be No Peace;
In Order to Achieve Peace, We Must Go After Hamas Network of Terror
and Cut Off its Support
September 9, 2014
"Some of our allies no longer trust us, and
our enemies no longer fear us; if we dont take immediate and
decisive action against those nations that support terror and undermine our
national security
especially those that are supposed allies
then we
put our interests and our citizens at greater
risk."
