News from Representative John Delaney
June 7, 2014
Dear Friend,
This week, I traveled through every county in our district, meeting
with constituents to hear from them on the issues facing our nation.
With appropriations bills and new environmental regulations under
consideration in Washington, DC, it was important to hear local input.
As a Member of Congress, bringing our district's concerns to the House
of Representatives is a top priority, and I was happy to hear feedback
from so many constituents.
One of my first stops this week was at Empower Energies, a business in
Frederick which provides renewable energy technologies to help
companies meet their sustainability objectives while achieving energy
savings. As countries around the world look to reduce their carbon
footprint, investments in the renewable energy industry and
technologies that make the United States a leader in clean energy are
critical to maintaining American economic competitiveness.
During my visit at Empower Energies, I had the chance to hear from
employees on forthcoming environmental regulations announced this week
by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This Monday, the EPA
released new standards for reducing carbon pollution from power plants,
the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. As
a strong supporter of US leadership in alternative energies, I released
my own legislation, the State's Choice Act
, that would build on the EPA's
proposal by offering additional, market-friendly ways for states to
comply with the new regulations.
In Oakland, I hosted a morning coffee at Trader's Coffee House, and got
the chance to talk more with constituents about the EPA's new emissions
standards. Having worked for twenty years in the private sector, I
understand that American businesses rely on stable, market-based forces
to plan for the future. I was happy to use my experience as an
entrepreneur in drafting legislation to improve the efficiency and
flexibility of the EPA's regulations.
To learn more about the State's Choice Act and my commitment to
encouraging US leadership in the clean energy industry, watch my
interview with Bill Loveless on Platts Energy Week
.
Also in Garrett County, I had a chance to visit FireFly Farms, a
locally owned and operated business in Accident. FireFly Farms uses
fresh milk from surrounding family farms to produce cheeses which have
received both national and international awards. During my time in
Congress, I've worked hard to support small and growing businesses like
FireFly Farms through legislation that encourages investment and
infrastructure development.
This week, I also visited the Maryland School for the Deaf (MSD) in
Frederick. As a member of the Congressional Deaf Caucus, I was
interested to talk with the school's Superintendent about the needs of
deaf students and teachers in our district. For more than a century,
MSD has been a leader in education, and I was pleased to learn more
about a school that has provided strong learning opportunities for so
many deaf and hard of hearing children and youth.
As the House considers appropriations bills funding government programs
through the coming fiscal year, it's important to me to hear from
constituents about their top priorities. Please take a moment to answer
my survey and let me know what you would like to see Congress take a
stand on
.
If you have
input on my work in Congress or on any of my meetings this week, please
feel free to contact my office
.
Sincerely,
John

Dear
Friend,
This
week,
I
traveled
through
every
county
in
our
district,
meeting
with
constituents
to
hear
from
them
on
the
issues
facing
our
nation.
With
appropriations
bills
and
new
environmental
regulations
under
consideration
in
Washington,
DC,
it
was
important
to
hear
local
input.
As
a
Member
of
Congress,
bringing
our
district's
concerns
to
the
House
of
Representatives
is
a
top
priority,
and
I
was
happy
to
hear
feedback
from
so
many
constituents.
One
of
my
first
stops
this
week
was
at
Empower
Energies,
a
business
in
Frederick
which
provides
renewable
energy
technologies
to
help
companies
meet
their
sustainability
objectives
while
achieving
energy
savings.
As
countries
around
the
world
look

investments

energy
industry
and
technologies
that
make
the
United

American
economic
competitiveness.
During
my

I
had
the

forthcoming
environmental
regulations
announced
this

by
the
Environmental

This

the

released
new
standards
for
reducing
carbon
pollution
from
power
plants,
the
largest
source
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
in
the
United
States.
As
a
strong
supporter
of
US
leadership
in
alternative
energies,
I
released
my
own
legislation,
the
State&#8217;s
Choice
Act ,
that
would
build
on
the
EPA&#8217;s
proposal
by

and
got

about
the

Having
worked
for
twenty
years
in
the

I
understand
that
American
businesses
rely
on
stable,
market-based
forces
to

the

I
was

to
use
my
experience
as
an

the
efficiency
and

of
the
EPA&#8217;s

To
learn

encouraging
US
leadership

the
clean
energy

watch

interview
with
Bill
Loveless

Also
in
Garrett
County,
I
had
a

FireFly

Accident.
FireFly
