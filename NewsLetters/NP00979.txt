This week I had the opportunity to host Service Academy Nights in Camp Hill and Dallastown for students interested in applying to a United States Service Academy. My staff, Academy Liaison Officers, and I outlined the process for applying for a Congressional Nomination, presented an overview of the history and traditions of each academy and provided insight into the application process.
The U.S. Military Academy, the U.S. Naval Academy, the U.S. Air Force Academy, and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy all require students seeking admission to obtain a nomination from a Member of Congress or from the Vice President of the United States.
The United States Coast Guard Academy does not accept Congressional Nominations.

Students interested in receiving information about the application process can call one of our District Offices. Students in Adams County may call (717) 338-1919; students in Cumberland and Dauphin County may call (717) 635-9504; and students in York County may call (717) 600-1919.
On Thursday, I had the opportunity to meet with Voith Hydros senior leadership, including Voith GmbH Corporate Board of Management President and CEO Dr. Hubert Lienhard and Chairman of Voith GmbHs Supervisory Board Dr. Hans-Peter Keitel, and then take a tour of the factory floor.
Voith is a significant employer in York County and one of the leading producers of hydropower equipment in the world.
I recently sponsored an amendment to H.R. 2028, the Energy-Water Appropriations bill for FY2016 that would restore funding for hydropower. Hydropower is the largest source of clean, renewable energy in the U.S., creating thousands of jobs (including many in the 4th District) and providing power to millions of Americans at low cost.

This bipartisan amendment increased funding for hydropower development - without adding to our debt.
Hydropower is vitally important to reducing our dependence on foreign oil and unlike some other renewable energy sources; its reliable and available in every region of the country.
In addition to touring Voith Hydro, I had the opportunity to visit General Dynamics Ordinance and Tactical Systems in Red Lion. This company produces cutting edge equipment for our US Military, including manufacturing tank ammunition for our US Armed Forces.

Finally, I had the opportunity to attend an event at Biglerville Elementary School in Adams County to participate in the ACES Program, which stands for All Children (&amp; Staff) Exercise Simultaneously. I had a great time bending, stretching and jumping with over 500 students in grades K-3 to promote the importance of physical fitness and a healthy lifestyle.
Sincerely,
Scott Perry
