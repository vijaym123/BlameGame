Rep. Candice Miller Praises Turkish Parliament Vote to Join Military Coalition Against ISIL
Washington
&#8211; Today, U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10),
Vice Chair of the House Homeland Security Committee and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security,
issued the following statement on today&#8217;s vote (298-98) by the Turkish Parliament to allow their military
forces to enter Iraq and Syria to fight ISIL:
&#8220;The threat of ISIL is spreading across the Middle East, particularly in Syria and Iraq, which poses a grave threat to vital United States interests and those of our allies.
The nation of Turkey, a NATO ally of the United States, borders
both Iraq and Syria, and its porous border with those two nations has allowed many foreign fighters to join the battle with ISIL and provided a possible route for ISIL fighters to travel to carry out attacks against our allies in Europe, or even to the United
States.
&#8220;Today, Turkey took a very positive step forward when its parliament voted 298-98 in favor of allowing its military to join the fight against ISIL in both Syria and Iraq.
The United States also has a vital air base at Incirlik, Turkey,
which is very close to the border with Syria, but previously the United States Air Force had been denied the ability to use that base for offensive operations against ISIL by the Turkish government, which demanded that it only be used for humanitarian missions.
It is my hope that today&#8217;s decision by Turkey allows for those restrictions to be lifted so that the full weight of United States air power can be brought to bear against ISIL.
&#8220;It is heartening that the coalition to take on ISIL continues to grow, particularly from Muslim nations like Turkey, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Iraq and Qatar.
We must remain steadfast and vigilant against the threat
posed by ISIL, and today&#8217;s development is another step in the right direction.&#8221;
