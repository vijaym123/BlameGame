Dear Friend,
This was my first week back in Washington after my hip-replacement
surgery. My doctor gave me the go-ahead to fly, but I still have to do
a bit of physical therapy.
(Rep. Gosar doing physical therapy in his Washington, D.C. office,
March 26, 2014)
It was an extremely busy week in Washington. We voted on several
important pieces of legislation and I also participated in a few key
committee hearings.
Protecting Jobs and Preventing Waste
On Tuesday, I voted in favor of the Preventing Government Waste and
Protecting Coal Mining Jobs in America Act. This legislation would save
coal mining jobs and prevent government waste by putting an end to the
Obama Administration's efforts to develop new coal regulations that
would destroy jobs and waste taxpayer money on a faulty rule-making
process.
Mining is a vital industry in Arizona, as it is in many states
throughout our nation. In Arizona, coal mining alone supports
approximately 4,000 jobs. The loss of these jobs would devastate
families in rural communities where mining is a prevalent part of the
economy. The Obama Administration's love affair with unnecessary
regulation is costing jobs and wasting hard-earned taxpayer money on
the development of economically catastrophic regulations. It's time for
the Administration to focus on creating jobs, not choking them off
through burdensome regulations. Click HERE
to read more.
Giving You a Say
On Wednesday, I voted in favor of the Ensuring Public Involvement in
the Creation of National Monuments Act. This legislation would modify
the Antiquities Act, which currently gives presidents the authority to
unilaterally create National Monuments, to require public input before
a president creates a National Monument.
National Monuments can be powerful symbols of our nation's historical
and natural heritage. But presidents shouldn't have the authority to
unilaterally create National Monuments by executive fiat. Public input
should be sought first. It is, after all, the people living near these
National Monuments who will be the most affected by their creation.
These folks deserve a strong voice when it comes to what happens on
federal lands near their communities. Click HERE
to read more.
Holding the IRS Accountable
The Oversight and Government Reform Committee, on which I serve, held
an important hearing on Wednesday. We questioned the Commissioner of
the IRS, John Koskinen, about the IRS's illegal targeting of
conservative groups. I will continue to fight to hold the responsible
IRS officials accountable. I won't stop until we discover the whole
truth.
Shielding Jobs From Obama Regulations
During the Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water and Power hearing on
Tuesday, the Acting Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation admitted
that the Navajo Generating Station (NGS) is "critical." This frank
admission comes as the Obama EPA is fixated on destroying the coal
industry, including NGS. I will do everything I can to shield the
"critical" work NGS performs from President Obama's job-killing
regulatory assault. Click HERE
or below to
watch my questioning of the Acting Commissioner and other witnesses.
Balance the Budget!
I also testified in front of the Budget Committee on Tuesday. I told
the committee what I would like to see prioritized in the Fiscal Year
2015 budget. First and foremost, we must balance our budget so that we
aren't burdening future generations with even more debt. This starts by
eliminating waste, fraud and abuse within the bloated federal
bureaucracy. Click HERE
or below to
see my testimony.
Gaining Momentum
My efforts to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse in the federal
government are gaining momentum. On Wednesday, Katie Pavlich of
TownHall appeared on Fox Business Network to talk about my effort to
prohibit members of Congress from flying first class on the taxpayer's
dime. Click HERE
or below to watch the segment.
Rebuilding Our Trust Relationship
It was an honor to speak to the Midwest Alliance of Sovereign Tribes
(MAST) on Tuesday. We discussed Native American health issues, my jobs
legislation - the Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act
- and a bill I'll be introducing that will help improve the United
States' trust relationship with Native American tribes.
(Rep. Gosar speaking to MAST, March 25, 2014)
Religious Freedom Doesn't End at the Shop Door
The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Tuesday concerning ObamaCare's
contraceptive mandate. This mandate is yet another example of the
federal government overstepping its constitutional bounds. The
government cannot impose a mandate on business owners that requires
them to choose between their religion and their livelihood.
Americans' constitutional and God-given right to religious freedom
doesn't end at the shop door; a business owner who believes that paying
for contraceptives that can potentially put an end to human life is
immoral shouldn't be forced to do so. I call on the Supreme Court to
protect the sanctity of the First Amendment by striking down this
appalling mandate. Click HERE
to read more.
Helping Downwinders
On Monday, April 14, I will hold a field hearing in Kingman that will
focus on the "downwinders" of Mohave County. As you may know,
downwinders are people who developed cancer due to radiation exposure
from U.S. nuclear weapons testing in the 1950s and 1960s. We will
discuss the history of nuclear weapons testing in Nevada and the bill
that I introduced to make all affected residents of Mohave County
eligible for benefits. Currently, only the part of Mohave County north
of the Grand Canyon is eligible. You can find the details of the
hearing in the "Mark Your Calendar" section below or by clicking HERE
.
It Was a Privilege
Yesterday, I was honored to present World War II veteran Jack D.
Shippey with his lost dog tags. Mr. Shippey had donated his dog tags,
among other items, to the museum at the Air Force's Non Commissioned
Officers school in 1981. But, when the museum moved locations, his dog
tags were lost. After eight years of searching for the missing dog tags
to no avail, the Shippey family contacted my
office for help and my
staff worked with the museum curator to successfully locate and acquire
Mr. Shippey's dog tags.
Like so many from the Greatest Generation, he served our nation
honorably during World War II and then came home to start a family and
build a life, including a successful career. Mr. Shippey exemplifies
the qualities that make our nation great: loyalty, bravery, integrity
and valor. He is a true American hero.
(Rep. Gosar shakes hands with Mr. Shippey after presenting him with his
dog tags, March 28, 2014)

Dear
Friend,
This was
my
first
week
back
in
Washington
after
my
hip-replacement
surgery.
My
doctor gave
me
the
go-ahead
to
fly,
but
I
still
have
to
do
a
bit
of
physical
therapy.
(Rep.
Gosar
doing

therapy
in
his
Washington,
D.C.
office,
March
26,
2014)
It
was
an
extremely busy
week
in
Washington.
We
voted
on
several
important
pieces
of
legislation
and
I
also
participated
in
a
few
key
committee hearings.
Protecting
Jobs
and
Preventing Waste
On
Tuesday, I
voted
in
favor
of the
Preventing
Government
Waste
and
Protecting
Coal
Mining
Jobs
in
America
Act.
This
legislation
would
save
coal
mining
jobs
and
prevent
government
waste
by
putting
an
end
to
the
Obama
Administration's
efforts
to
develop
new
coal
regulations
that
would
destroy
jobs
and
waste
taxpayer
money
on
a
faulty
rule-making
process.
Mining
is
a
vital
industry
in
Arizona,
as
it
is
in
many
states
throughout
our
nation.
In
Arizona,
coal
mining
alone
supports
approximately
4,000
jobs.
The
loss
of
these
jobs
would
devastate
families
in
rural
communities
where
mining
is
a
prevalent
part
of
the
economy.
The
Obama
Administration's
love
affair
with
unnecessary
regulation
is
costing
jobs
and
wasting
hard-earned
taxpayer
money
on
the
development
of
economically
catastrophic
regulations.
It&#8217;s
time
for
the
Administration
to
focus
on
creating
jobs,
not
choking
them
off
through
burdensome
regulations.

Giving
You
a

On
Wednesday, I
voted
in
favor
of the
Ensuring
Public
Involvement
in
the
Creation

Act.
This
legislation
would
modify
the
Antiquities
Act,
which
currently gives
presidents
the
authority
to
unilaterally
create
National
Monuments, to
require
public
input
before
a
president
creates
a
National
Monument.
National
Monuments
can
be
powerful
symbols
of
our
nation&#8217;s
historical
and
natural
heritage.
But
presidents
shouldn&#8217;t
have
the
authority
to
unilaterally
create
National
Monuments
by
executive
fiat.
Public
input
should
be
sought
first.
It
is,
after
all,
the
people
living
near
these
National
Monuments
who
will
be
the
most
affected
by
their
creation.
These
folks
deserve
a
strong
voice
when
it
comes
to
what
happens
on
federal
lands
near
their
communities.

Holding
the
IRS
Accountable
The
Oversight
and
Government
Reform
Committee,
on

an
important hearing
on
Wednesday.
We
questioned
the
Commissioner
of
the
IRS,
John
Koskinen,
about
the
IRS's
illegal
targeting
of
conservative
groups.
I
will
continue
to
fight
to
hold
the
responsible
IRS
officials accountable.
I
won't
stop
until
we
discover
the
whole
truth.
Shielding

Regulations
During

on
Tuesday,
the
Acting
Commissioner
of
the
Bureau
of
Reclamation
admitted
that
the
Navajo

(NGS)
is
"critical."
This
frank
admission
comes
as
the
Obama
EPA
is
fixated
on
destroying
the
coal

including
NGS.
I
will
do
everything
I
can
to shield the

Religious
Freedom
Doesn&#8217;t
End
at
the
Shop
Door
The
Supreme
Court
heard
oral
arguments
on
Tuesday
concerning
ObamaCare&#8217;s
contraceptive
mandate.
This
mandate
is
yet
another
example
of
the
federal
government
overstepping
its
constitutional
bounds.
The
government
cannot
impose
a
mandate
on
business
owners
that
requires
them
to
choose
between
their
religion
and
their
livelihood.
Americans&#8217;
constitutional
and
God-given
right
to
religious
freedom
doesn&#8217;t
end
at
the
shop
door;
a
business
owner
who
believes
that
paying
for
contraceptives
that
can
potentially
put
an
end
to
human
life
is
immoral
shouldn&#8217;t
be
forced
to
do
so.
I
call
on
the
Supreme
Court
to
protect
the
sanctity
of
the
First
Amendment
by
striking
down
this
appalling
mandate.

Helping
Downwinders
On
Monday,
April
14,
I
will
hold
a
field
hearing
in
Kingman
that
will
focus
on
the
"downwinders"
of
Mohave
County.
As
you
may
know,
downwinders
are
people
who developed
cancer
due
to
radiation
exposure
from
U.S.
nuclear
weapons
testing
in
the
1950s
and
1960s.
We
will
discuss
the
history
of
nuclear
weapons
testing
in
Nevada
and
the
bill
that
I
introduced
to
make
all
affected
residents
of
Mohave
County
eligible
for
benefits.
Currently,
only
the
part
of
Mohave
County
north
of
the
Grand

is
eligible. You

It
Was
a
Privilege
Yesterday,
I
was
honored
to
present
World
War
II
veteran
Jack
D.
Shippey
with
his
lost
dog
tags.
Mr.
Shippey
had
donated
his
dog
tags,
among
other
items,
to
the
museum
at
the
Air
Force&#8217;s
Non
Commissioned
Officers
school
in
1981.
But,
when
the
museum
moved
locations,
his
dog
tags
were
lost.
After
eight
years
of
searching
for
the
missing
dog
tags
to
no
avail,
the
Shippey
family
contacted
my
office
for
help
and
my
staff
worked
with
the
museum
curator
to
successfully
locate
and
acquire
Mr.
Shippey's
dog
tags.
Like
so
many
from
the
Greatest
Generation,
he
served our
nation
honorably
during
World
War
II
and
then
came
home to
start
a
family
and
build
a
life,
including
a
successful
career.
Mr.
Shippey
exemplifies
the
qualities
that
make
our
nation
great:
loyalty,
bravery,
integrity
and
valor.
He
is
a
true
American
hero.
