Rubio Calls On Prime Minister Of
Turkey To Stop Hateful Rhetoric Against
Israel, Prevent Confrontation
On Wednesday, Marco called on the Prime
Minister of the Republic of Turkey, Recep
Tayyip Erdogan, to halt his hateful
anti-Israel rhetoric, and prevent
organizations operating in Turkey from
provoking a confrontation with Israeli
forces.
In
a letter to
Erdogan
, Marco expressed concern over
Erdogans recent anti-Israel
comments, and urged him to take any
necessary preventable measures regarding
reports that organizations operating in
Turkey are attempting to breach
Israels naval blockade of
Hamas-controlled Gaza.
In response to thousands of
rocket attacks on Israel launched by
Hamas and other terrorist organizations
from Gaza, Israel instituted a naval
blockade to prevent items that could be
used to support these attacks from
entering Gaza by sea. The intent of the
measures is to protect Israel, while
still allowing humanitarian aid into
Gaza.
wrote Rubio . I encourage
you to take all appropriate measures to
keep these organizations from provoking a
confrontation with Israeli forces and
violating this blockade. A publicity
stunt by Turkish organizations in 2010
led to the regrettable loss of life, and
it would be irresponsible for your
government not to take measures to avoid
a similar outcome this time.
I was thus deeply troubled by
your comments at a campaign event on
August 3rd comparing Israels
recent actions to Nazi Germanys
genocidal campaign against Jews and other
minorities with the statement Just
like Hitler, who sought to establish a
race free of all faults, Israel is
chasing after the same
target,
added Rubio . Such
deplorable comments and anti-Israel views
have become increasingly common among
senior Turkish officials and severely
undermine our mutual interest in
collaboration to address the common
challenges our nations face.

Rubio: New RESTORE Act Rule Long
Overdue, But Continued Need To Closely
Examine Implementation
Marco welcomed a long-awaited rule under
the Resources and Ecosystem Sustainability,
Tourist Opportunities, and Revived
Economies of the Gulf Coast States
(RESTORE) Act, but he cautioned that its
implications must be closely analyzed in
the days ahead.
On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury
Department announced that a new rule has
been published in the Federal Register for
Gulf Coast states and municipalities to
receive funding for environmental
restoration and economic development
projects under the RESTORE Act.
Without a rule, Gulf states
like Florida have been held back from
being made whole again after the damage
inflicted by the Deepwater Horizon
disaster,
said Rubio . Its
unacceptable that its taken the
Obama Administration this long to issue a
rule that people actually need and that
is 20 months late.
However, with rules like this,
the devil is always in the details, so I
will be examining it closely and
consulting with Florida stakeholders to
ensure our people are not being
short-changed as we continue
implementation of the Act,
added Rubio .
Last month,
during a
hearing
of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on
Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries and Coast
Guard, Marco highlighted the problems
associated due to the lack of this critical
final rule under the RESTORE Act.
Constituent Casework Corner
Michael, an Army
veteran living in South Florida needed his
passport to travel for work. After he
submitted his passport application, the
National Passport Center notified him that
his naturalization certificate was missing
a signature and a stamp. He filed an
application with the U.S. Citizenship and
Immigration Services (USCIS) to correct the
certificate, but it was not approved in
time and his passport application was
denied. Since his certificate was issued
overseas while he was serving in the U.S.
Army
and it was due to the
agencys error
a member of
the staff asked USCIS to expedite the
certificate. They agreed, and once issued,
the National Passport Center approved his
application. Michael was issued the
passport book in time to travel for
work.
