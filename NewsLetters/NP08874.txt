Veterans Deserve Better Care
Americans across the country are rightly outraged by reports that VA
employees doctored medical records to conceal long wait times for sick
veterans in need of care. According to a nationwide audit
released by the Department of Veterans Affairs, schedulers at 76% of VA
facilities have engaged in the practice of misreporting appointment
requests.
As a result, 57,000 veterans nationwide are waiting for care.
In San
Antonio alone, 837 veterans are stuck in a wait list limbo.
This is
inexcusable.
America's veterans deserve the best care possible, as
soon as possible.
I recently met with Secretary Sloan Gibson
to discuss what the VA is doing to help San
Antonio veterans who are stuck on long waitlists. I was reassured that
he sincerely wants to fix the problem. But we need more than just
sincerity; we need swift action to protect the health and well-being of
our veterans.
That's why I have supported the Veterans Access to Care Act
to give veterans stuck on waitlists immediate access to
healthcare, including care outside the VA system. I also supported the
VA Management Accountability Act
,
which allows the Secretary of the VA to fire employees found to have
engaged in misreporting of medical records.
America's veterans have made tremendous sacrifices to protect and
defend our freedoms. They deserve the best health care, not delayed
health care. I am committed to continuing to fight to ensure that
America's veterans get the care that they need and deserve.
Negotiating With Terrorists
Endangers Americans
The President's decision to release five terrorists at Guantanamo Bay
has serious national security consequences.
It's dangerous for any president to negotiate with terrorists because
it only encourages them to take more hostages. It's a troubling
precedent that puts Americans serving overseas at even greater risk.
We know President Obama has long opposed holding terrorists at
Guantanamo Bay.
But if this is a backdoor way to achieve his political
goal of closing Gitmo, it comes at a high price to our national
security. Of the five terrorists released by President Obama, two are
responsible for thousands of deaths.
This is not the kind of decision that the Commander-in-chief should
make unilaterally. The law clearly states that the administration must
give Congress 30-days' notice before transferring prisoners out of
Gitmo. But no such notice was given to the people's representatives in
Congress.
The President should have followed the law and consulted with Congress
before releasing five dangerous terrorists back onto the battlefield.
The House of Representatives is planning to hold hearings and we will
get to the bottom of the Administration's decision to transfer
dangerous terrorists out of Gitmo.
Fighting EPA's Expansion of Power
Two new regulations issued by the EPA represent the largest expansion
of power by the federal government in our nation's history. The EPA's
new water rule
would allow the federal government to regulate all man-made
and natural bodies of water, including those on private property. The
rule allows the federal government into our backyards, regulating
private and public lakes, ponds and streams.
And the recent power plant rule
is all pain and no gain for American families and workers. By imposing
strict carbon regulations on existing power plants, the Obama
administration will force many power plants to close down costing
thousands of jobs and driving up electricity prices.
And for what? U.S. emissions have already declined nine percent from
2008 to 2012. Studies show that dramatically cutting carbon emissions
in the U.S. will have little impact on global temperatures in the
future.
Rather than more regulation, we should focus on technological
innovations that cut energy costs, create jobs and can be used
worldwide. This would help other countries, like China and India,
reduce their carbon footprint as well without costing American jobs.

and Technology Committee and our efforts to hold the EPA accountable,

Veterans
Deserve
Better
Care
Americans
across
the
country
are
rightly
outraged
by
reports
that
VA

doctored
medical

to
conceal
long

times
for

But
we

That&#8217;s

I

stuck

immediate

Negotiating
With
Terrorists
Endangers
Americans
The
President&#8217;s
decision
to
release
five
terrorists
at
Guantanamo
Bay
has
serious
national
security
consequences.
It&#8217;s
dangerous
for
any
president
to
negotiate
with
terrorists
because
it
only
encourages
them
to
take
more
hostages.
It&#8217;s
a
troubling
precedent
that
puts
Americans
serving
overseas
at
even
greater
risk.
We
know
President
Obama
has
long
opposed
holding terrorists
at
Guantanamo
Bay.
But
if
this
is
a
backdoor
way
to
achieve
his
political
goal
of
closing
Gitmo,
it
comes
at
a
high
price
to
our
national
security.
Of
the
five
terrorists
released
by
President
Obama,
two
are
responsible
for
thousands
of
deaths.
This
is
not
the
kind
of
decision
that
the
Commander-in-chief
should
make
unilaterally. The
law
clearly
states
that
the
administration
must
give
Congress
30-days&#8217;
notice
before
transferring
prisoners
out
of
Gitmo. But
no
such
notice
was
given
to
the
people&#8217;s
representatives
in
Congress.
The
President
should
have
followed
the
law
and
consulted
with
Congress
before
releasing
five
dangerous
terrorists
back
onto
the
battlefield.
The
House
of
Representatives
is
planning
to
hold
hearings
and
we
will
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
Administration&#8217;s
decision
to transfer dangerous
terrorists
out
of
Gitmo.
Fighting EPA's
Expansion
of
Power
Two
new
regulations
issued
by
the
EPA
represent
the
largest
expansion
of
power
by
the
federal
government
in
our
nation&#8217;s
history.
The
EPA&#8217;s
new
water
rule
would
allow
the
federal
government
to
regulate
all
man-made
and
natural
bodies
of
water,
including
those
on
private
property.
The
rule
allows
the
federal
government
into
our
backyards,
regulating
private
and
public
lakes,
ponds
and
streams.
And
the
recent
power
plant
rule
is
all
pain
and
no
gain
for
American
families
and
workers.
By
imposing
strict
carbon
regulations
on
existing
power
plants,
the
Obama
administration
will
force
many
power
plants
to
close
down
costing
thousands
of
jobs
and
driving
up
electricity
prices.
And
for
what?
U.S.
emissions
have
already
declined
nine
percent
from
2008
to
2012.
Studies
show
that
dramatically
cutting
carbon
emissions
in
the
U.S.
will
have
little
impact
on
global
temperatures
in
the
future.
Rather
than
more
regulation,
we
should
focus
on
technological
innovations
that
cut
energy
costs,
create
jobs
and
can
be
used
worldwide.
This
would
help
other
countries,
like
China
and
India,
reduce
their
carbon
footprint
as
well
without
costing
American
jobs.
