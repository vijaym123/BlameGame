Rep. Fattah
Dear
Friend,
The latest edition of
A
Capitol Idea with Chaka Fattah
delves into the student experience
of GEAR UP, the college readiness program I created and helped pass
into law in 1998. Now, 15 years later, GEAR UP has served more than 13
million students nationwide.
This
episode
features two
of these students, Jakala Reese and Hector Araujo, who explore the
spectacular ways in which GEAR UP educated, motivated, and guided them
to life-changing success in both high school and college. Jakala and
Hector have considerably different backgrounds, but attest to the
universal benefits GEAR UP offers.
I invite you to click below to hear their amazing
stories and learn more about GEAR UP.
By

to my
YouTube

events, and appearances.
Thanks for
watching,
Chaka
