Congressman
Bill
Foster
Representing the 11th District
December 14, 2013
Dear Friend,
Last Monday, more than five thousand members of the community
joined me for a special live telephone town hall meeting to discuss one of
my top priorities in Congress -- immigration reform. I believe
the time is now to pass comprehensive immigration reform which secures
our borders, improves our legal immigration system and provides a path
to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants who are currently stuck
in limbo.
Participants from our
community had the opportunity to ask questions and voice their
opinions. We discussed what is included in the comprehensive immigration
reform bill and why these reforms are so badly needed.
We also took
surveys throughout the course of the discussion and found that the
majority of participants support comprehensive immigration reform with 67%
saying they support reform and 33% saying they
oppose.
What do you think? If you werent able to join
the conversation, you can voice your opinion
here .
As a scientist and
businessman, I know how valuable immigrants are to innovation and economic
growth in our country.
Immigrants are more than twice as likely
to open small business as native-born Americans. In fact, in a 2012
report, the Partnership for a New American Economy found that in 2011,
immigrants started 28% of all new U.S. businesses. Collectively,
immigrant run-businesses employ more than 4.7 million people.
Comprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy by bringing in skilled
workers who further American innovation.
It would also reduce
our debt
according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office,
the comprehensive immigration reform bill in the Senate would reduce the
deficit by $158 billion over 10 years.
