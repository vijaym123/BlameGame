LEGISLATION
Dear David,
Taking Care of Our
Veterans at Home &amp; Condemning Hamas
Abroad
This week the House passed the
Conference report to H.R. 3230. The Veterans Access, Choice and
Accountability Act of 2014 is a positive first step towards reforming the VA.
While working to keep the faith with our hero Veterans, the U.S. House
also expressed solidarity with our allies, like Israel, and passed a
resolution condemning Hamas for violating international
law.
Ensuring Timely Access to
Care
This week
the House passed the Conference report to H.R. 3230. This agreement will
help Veterans get more timely access to quality care, and will
authorize leases for critical new VA clinics, including a single,
consolidated clinic in Pasco County. Pascos Veterans deserve the best access to
care, and it was important that the Pasco lease was included in the
final compromise between the House and Senate.
The VA has systemic failures that promote a
culture of mediocrity and discourage transparency and accountability,
which has resulted in a backlog of Veterans claims and excessive wait
times to receive care. This bill, which will help Veterans get access
to care and reduce the backlog, is the first step toward fully
reforming the VAs culture so that it serves the Veteran, not the
bureaucrat.

Condemning
Hamas
Throughout the
ongoing conflict in Gaza, Hamas has used Palestinian citizens
men,
women, and children
as human shields. They hide in bunkers under
hospitals and store weapons under civilian areas.
The House passed H.Con. Res. 107 this week. It
strongly condemns Hamas for using human shields, but it also expresses
Congress support for the Palestinian people
and
Israel.
Innocent civilians are being put into harms way by Hamas, a terrorist
organization that refuses to accept ceasefires and continues to fire
rockets at civilian targets in Israel. Israel faces an existential crisis
these organizations
literally
believe Israel does not have
a right to exist, and her people do not have a right to live. Israel
has the right to defend itself against such hostility. I was proud to
support legislation that condemned Hamas, while supporting Israel and
the Palestinian people.
Sincerely,
Gus Bilirakis
Member of
Congress
