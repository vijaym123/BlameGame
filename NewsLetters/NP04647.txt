District
The American people sent a message Tuesday,
putting Republicans in control of the Senate and boosting our majority
in the House. Now, it is our job to show that we can govern so we can
restore the shaken confidence of our constituents and put the
greatest country in the world on the right track.
Americans are
weary of both congressional gridlock and executive branch incompetence.
By working with willing partners in the House and Senate, we can send
President Obama legislation that will heal our country and grow our
economy.
For example, I have two bills to boost the timber
and ranching industries in Idaho and the West that have already passed
the House. Harry Reid and the Democrats refused to even give them a
hearing. Im optimistic they will now get serious consideration in the
Senate.
These bills are a good first step in our effort to
lift the regulatory burden slowing growth in the public lands states.
Our national forests have been mismanaged for too long, dropping timber
harvests by 80 percent in 30 years. I believe state and local
governments can do a better job.
My Self-Sufficient Community Lands
Act would establish pilot community forest projects of about 200,000
acres, totaling up to 4 million acres nationwide. Local governments
would manage the land in accordance with state laws. The result would be
responsible production, creation of rural jobs and reduced wildfire
risk. My hope is demonstrating the benefit of guardianship closer to
the people will prompt management transfer of millions more acres in
coming years.
The Grazing Improvement Act would extend
livestock grazing permits on federal lands from 10 to 20 years, giving
ranchers the certainty to boost operations and local economies. The bill
addresses a backlog in processing renewals by extending permits under
existing terms. It also offers regulatory relief and would discourage
frivolous lawsuits.
More broadly, the GOP change in the Senate
means Congress should pass a free-market alternative to Obamacare. It
means tax reform, which lowers rates, eliminates corporate welfare
and tax loopholes, and raises additional revenue through growth. It
means cutting our $18 trillion debt now, not down the road. It means
regulatory reform and step-by-step immigration reform. It means legislation
to protect religious freedom, check spying on Americans and shield
citizens from IRS abuse.
Republicans should act swiftly, in
the first 100 days of the new Congress. We need to prove that limited
government can work efficiently and effectively.
My hope is
the president, heeding the message of the American people and mindful
of his legacy, would work with us in Congress. Unfortunately, in his
post-election news conference, he seemed reluctant to acknowledge the
scale of the GOP wave and the need for change. Im especially troubled
that he repeated his vow to move ahead with a provocative executive
order on immigration before Congress has time to act.
But
even if the president fails to work with us, a Republican Congress can
pass a common sense agenda that will show exactly what we want to do to
improve the lives of all of our constituents.
Millions of
Americans are unemployed, underemployed or simply so discouraged
theyve left the workforce. We must make every effort to revive President
Reagans brilliant conception of America as "a shining city on a hill,"
blessed with boundless promise.
The new Republican majority
can unleash the pent-up energy of millions of Americans ready to go
to work in an economy that restores fiscal sanity and assures a level
field in tax and regulatory policy.
In January, the Senate
logjam will break. Republicans must not take the responsibility
lightly. The American people want results. Its our duty to
deliver.
