Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA)
March 13, 2015
Dear Friends,
This week, the Senate debated legislation to help bring an end to
modern-day slavery and human trafficking and to protect the victims of
this heinous crime. I urged my colleagues to vote in favor
of the Justice for
Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015
because U.S. leadership is essential for this
movement to grow. This piece of legislation will improve law
enforcement's ability to prosecute sex trafficking offenders and
require offenders to pay a fine. These fines will be used to establish
a fund to raise money for the victims as well as to help fund private,
municipal and state efforts to establish anti-trafficking law
enforcement units and task forces, and a Computer Forensics Unit and a
Child Exploitation Investigations Unit within the Cyber Crimes Center.
Modern-day slavery in all its forms must be stopped, and I hope the
Senate will act quickly to pass this important legislation.
Fighting for our Second Amendment Rights
I am committed to protecting our Second Amendment rights.
Therefore when the Obama administration
proposed a
regulation that
would effectively ban certain ammunition used in AR-15-style rifles and
other firearms, I signed on to a letter demanding they withdraw this
unconstitutional proposal.
The letter states, "Second Amendment rights require not only access to
firearms but to bullets. If law-abiding gun owners cannot obtain rifle
ammunition, or face substantial difficulty in finding ammunition
available and at reasonable process because government entities are
banning such ammunition, then the Second Amendment is at risk."
Fortunately, the administration got our message and has abandoned this
ill-conceived plan.
IRS and Executive Amnesty
The president's action last year to grant amnesty to millions here
illegally also opened the door for those individuals to be eligible for
the Earned Income Tax Credit, which helps low- to moderate-income
American workers. On Tuesday, I co-sponsored legislation to prevent
these millions of individuals benefitting from the president's 2014
executive amnesty action from collecting this tax credit
based on work performed while in this
country illegally. It is incomprehensible and unacceptable to reward
these individuals for coming to our country illegally.
I will continue to do all that I can to stop this executive immigration
overreach and will fight to prevent the IRS from doling out hundreds of
millions of taxpayer dollars to those who broke our immigration laws.
Time for Answers from Colorado VA Hospital
This week, I sent a letter to Veterans Affairs' Secretary Robert
McDonald
asking him to address the ongoing problems
that have plagued construction of a replacement for the Denver VA
Medical Center hospital, including mismanagement that has led to
hundreds of millions in cost overruns and repeated delays.
It is crucial that we hold Secretary McDonald accountable about his
plans to address these issues surrounding the construction cost
overruns and serious schedule delays at the Denver VA Medical Center.
We must ensure the veterans of Colorado are provided for, and
completion of the project is critical in providing necessary care and
support.
It is my intention to make Denver one of the next in a series of VA
site visits and field hearings conducted by the Senate VA committee.
Stronger Commitment to Defeat ISIL
On Wednesday, I questioned Secretary of State John Kerry about the use
of military force to degrade and destroy the Islamic State of Iraq and
Levant, or ISIL, and its affiliates.
I also raised
concern over the president's
proposed time limitation, or three-year "sunset" provision, on U.S.
military engagement that was included in the authorization the
president sent to Congress last month. We should be sending a clear
signal that America has no intention of surrendering our fight against
ISIL until we win the victory.
Iran Nuclear Capabilities
Last week I attended Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech
to a Joint Session of Congress, where I listened as one of our nation's
closest allies discussed the critical and mutually important goal of
stopping Iran from achieving a nuclear weapons capability. Iran is the
world's leading sponsor of terrorism and a nuclear-armed Iran is an
existential threat to Israel and a threat to the United States as well.
We should not relax sanctions against Iran until Iran ends its efforts
to obtain these weapons.
This week I also joined my Senate colleagues in sending a cautionary
warning to Iranian leaders that any nuclear deal not approved by the
Senate may be revoked when a new president is elected. I respect the
office of the president and the responsibility he has to negotiate with
Iran on behalf of the entire country. However, I worry about this
president's foreign policy. It's a dangerous situation when you have an
administration that appears to be nearing such a critically important
deal with Iran without providing Congress with any information or
opportunity for input.
Student Loans and College Costs
Georgia Tech students and guests listened to President Obama on Tuesday
during his visit to campus to discuss the investment of higher
education. Higher education is vitally important, but the cost has
become burdensome on both students and colleges.
To help our students, I have co-sponsored FAST Act
, this bill would reduce the number of
questions some 20 million Americans must answer to apply for federal
financial aid down to a single postcard-called the "Student Aid Short
Form" - and high school students would be informed in their junior year
the amount of federal aid for which they are eligible. It also
addresses the problem of some students taking on too much debt by
limiting the amount a student can borrow based on enrollment.
I am also a co-sponsor of the Supporting Academic Freedom through
Regulatory Relief Act, S.599
, which would repeal burdensome and
unnecessary regulations that have been enacted over the last six years
that restrict choice and increase costs in higher education. This
legislation would help prevent future federal overreach in
postsecondary education.
Georgia Students at U.S. Senate Youth Program
It was exciting to meet Georgia's student
delegates, Kylon Harris of Americus, Ga., and Jacob Pierce, of Atlanta,
Ga., when I spoke to the 53rd annual United States Senate Youth Program
Wednesday evening. I am delighted that I
had the opportunity to co-chair this program.
What's on Tap
Next week, the Senate will continue consideration of the
anti-human-trafficking measure, S.178. Also, the Senate will consider
Carlos A. Monje, Jr., of Louisiana, to be an assistant secretary of
Transportation and Manson K. Brown, of the District of Columbia, to be
an assistant secretary of Commerce.

Dear
Friends,
This
week,
the
Senate
debated
legislation
to
help
bring
an
end
to
modern-day
slavery
and
human
trafficking
and
to
protect
the
victims
of
this
heinous
crime.
I
urged
my
colleagues
to
vote
in
favor
of
the
Justice
for
Victims
of
Trafficking
Act
of
2015
because
U.S.
leadership
is
essential
for
this
movement
to
grow.
This
piece
of
legislation
will
improve
law
enforcement's
ability
to
prosecute
sex
trafficking
offenders
and
require
offenders
to
pay
a
fine.
These
fines
will
be
used
to
establish
a
fund
to
raise
money
for
the
victims
as
well
as
to
help
fund
private,
municipal
and
state
efforts
to
establish
anti-trafficking
law
enforcement
units
and
task
forces,
and
a
Computer
Forensics
Unit
and
a
Child
Exploitation
Investigations
Unit
within
the
Cyber
Crimes
Center.
Modern-day
slavery
in
all
its
forms
must
be
stopped,
and
I
hope
the
Senate
will
act
quickly
to
pass
this
important
legislation.
Fighting
for
our
Second
Amendment
Rights
I
am
committed
to
protecting
our
Second
Amendment
rights.
Therefore
when
the
Obama
administration
proposed
a
regulation
that
would
effectively
ban
certain
ammunition
used
in
AR-15-style
rifles
and
other
firearms,
I
signed
on
to
a
letter
demanding
they
withdraw
this
unconstitutional
proposal.
The
letter
states,
"Second
Amendment
rights
require
not
only
access
to
firearms
but
to
bullets.
If
law-abiding
gun
owners
cannot
obtain
rifle
ammunition,
or
face
substantial
difficulty
in
finding
ammunition
available
and
at
reasonable
process
because
government
entities
are
banning
such
ammunition,
then
the
Second
Amendment
is
at
risk."
Fortunately,
the
administration
got
our
message
and
has
abandoned
this
ill-conceived
plan.
IRS
and
Executive
Amnesty
The
president's
action
last
year
to
grant
amnesty
to
millions
here
illegally
also
opened
the
door
for
those
individuals
to
be
eligible
for
the
Earned
Income
Tax
Credit,
which
helps
low-
to
moderate-income
American
workers.
On
Tuesday,
I
co-sponsored
legislation
to
prevent
these
millions
of
individuals
benefitting
from
the
president's
2014
executive
amnesty
action
from
collecting
this
tax
credit
based
on
work
performed
while
in
this
country
illegally.
It
is
incomprehensible
and
unacceptable
to
reward
these
individuals
for
coming
to
our
country
illegally.
I
will
continue
to
do
all
that
I
can
to
stop
this
executive
immigration
overreach
and
will
fight
to
prevent
the
IRS
from
doling
out
hundreds
of
millions
of
taxpayer
dollars
to
those
who
broke
our
immigration
laws.
Time
for
Answers
from
Colorado
VA
Hospital
This
week,
I
sent
a
letter
to
Veterans
Affairs'
Secretary
Robert
McDonald
asking
him
to
address
the
ongoing
problems
that
have
plagued
construction
of
a
replacement
for
the
Denver
VA
Medical
Center
hospital,
including
mismanagement
that
has
led
to
hundreds
of
millions
in
cost
overruns
and
repeated
delays.
It
is
crucial
that
we
hold
Secretary
McDonald
accountable
about
his
plans
to
address
these
issues
surrounding
the
construction
cost
overruns
and
serious
schedule
delays
at
the
Denver
VA
Medical
Center.
We
must
ensure
the
veterans
of
Colorado
are
provided
for,
and
completion
of
the
project
is
critical
in
providing
necessary
care
and
support.
It
is
my
intention
to
make
Denver
one
of
the
next
in
a
series
of
VA
site
visits
and
field
hearings
conducted
by
the
Senate
VA
committee.
Stronger
Commitment
to
Defeat
ISIL
On
Wednesday,
I
questioned
Secretary
of
State
John
Kerry
about
the
use
of
military
force
to
degrade
and
destroy
the
Islamic
State
of
Iraq
and
Levant,
or
ISIL,
and
its
affiliates.
I
also
raised
concern
over
the
president's
proposed
time
limitation,
or
three-year
"sunset"
provision,
on
U.S.
military
engagement
that
was
included
in
the
authorization
the
president
sent
to
Congress
last
month.
We
should
be
sending
a
clear
signal
that
America
has
no
intention
of
surrendering
our
fight
against
ISIL
until
we
win
the
victory.
Iran
Nuclear
Capabilities
Last
week
I
attended
Israeli
Prime
Minister
Benjamin
Netanyahu's
speech
to
a
Joint
Session
of
Congress,
where
I
listened
as
one
of
our
nation's
closest
allies
discussed
the
critical
and
mutually
important
goal
of stopping
Iran from
achieving
a
nuclear
weapons
capability.
Iran
is
the
world's
leading
sponsor
of
terrorism
and
a
nuclear-armed
Iran
is
an
existential
threat
to
Israel
and
a
threat
to
the
United
States
as
well.
We
should
not
relax
sanctions
against
Iran
until
Iran
ends
its
efforts
to
obtain
these
weapons.
This
week
I
also
joined
my
Senate
colleagues
in
sending
a
cautionary
warning
to
Iranian
leaders
that
any
nuclear
deal
not
approved
by
the
Senate
may
be
revoked
when
a
new
president
is
elected.
I
respect
the
office
of
the
president
and
the
responsibility
he
has
to
negotiate
with
Iran
on
behalf
of
the
entire
country.
However,
I
worry
about
this
president's
foreign
policy.
It's
a
dangerous
situation
when
you
have
an
administration
that
appears
to
be
nearing
such
a
critically
important
deal
with
Iran without
providing
Congress
with
any
information
or
opportunity
for
input.
Student

Georgia

President
Obama

Tuesday

his

of
higher

Higher
education
is
vitally
important,
but
the

has
become
burdensome
on
both
students
and
colleges.
To
help
our
students,
I
have
co-sponsored
FAST
Act ,
this
bill
would
reduce
the
number
of
questions
some
20
million
Americans
must
answer
to
apply
for
federal
financial
aid
down
to
a
single
postcard&mdash;called
the
"Student
Aid
Short

&ndash;
and
high
school
students
would
be
informed
in
their
junior
year
the
amount
of
federal
aid
for
which
they
are
eligible.
It
also
addresses
the
problem
of
some
students
taking
on
too
much
debt
by
limiting
the
amount
a
student
can
borrow
based
on
enrollment.
I
am
also
a
co-sponsor
of
the
Supporting
Academic
Freedom
through
Regulatory
Relief
Act,
S.599
,
which would
repeal
burdensome
and
unnecessary
regulations
that
have
been
enacted
over
the
last
six
years
that
restrict
choice
and
increase
costs
in
higher
education.
This
legislation
would
help
prevent
future
federal
overreach
in
postsecondary
education.
