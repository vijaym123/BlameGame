Roads and bridges
we all use them, and they are
deteriorating with each passing day.
Our transportation system was
once the envy of the world, but we now find ourselves dodging potholes
and crossing deficient bridges.
This week, the House passed
H.R. 2577, the
Transportation, Housing and Urban
Development Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2016 , to invest in our
infrastructure and
dedicate funds
for high-priority
programs to make Americas transportation system reliable, safe and
efficient.
Transportation funding is an issue from the local
level all the way to the federal level. We, in southwest Missouri,
will soon see the policy implications of a prolonged transportation
debate, where dwindling state funds could clash with uncertainty
surrounding federal transportation funding.
At the heart of the debate is
the Federal Highway Trust Fund (HTF), which since 1956 has provided
states assistance with transportation construction and maintenance
project costs and is primarily funded with federal gas tax revenue.
HTF covers approximately 80 percent of state project costs.
Without certainty for highway funds moving forward, state transportation
departments, such as MoDOT, cannot plan to fix critical infrastructure
problems or maintain the existing system.
They can only
plan for short-term, low-cost maintenance
and minimal
safety improvements.
Twenty-two percent of Missouris major
roadways have a poor rating and 23 percent of bridges need to be
repaired, improved or replaced.
This leads to bad roads, which are
costly for drivers.
As a result, an
April 2015
study
shows Springfield metro area drivers lose $1,134 annually due
to additional vehicle operating costs, congested-related delays and
crashes.
Our nations economy is built on
our infrastructure
whether it is the roadways, railways and tarmacs
to get goods to markets or providing jobs for those who build.
If
our infrastructure crumbles, so goes our economy.
We need to
have a solid plan to continue HTF and prevent further deterioration of
infrastructure.
H.R. 2577 provides HTF with $40.25 billion next
fiscal year, pending Congress reauthorization of the program in
July.
I look forward to lively debate on long-term HTF
reauthorization, providing states with certainty on a path forward before the program
expires at the end of the summer.
