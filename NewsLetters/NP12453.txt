As the son of a Marine, I know that caring for our veterans when they
transition to civilian life is critically important. And though we can
never fully repay the debt that we owe, we need to uphold the promises
we made to our servicemen and
women.
These promises are not only to protect the benefits our veterans
have earned, but also to ensure that opportunities for employment,
education and job training are available to them upon their return.
That's why I strongly supported the recent house passage of the
GI
Tuition Fairness Act . This bipartisan legislation, sponsored by
Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller (R-FL), requires
states to charge in-state tuition rates for veterans, regardless of what
state they live. Unfortunately, current law only provides guaranteed GI
benefits to veterans attending schools in their state
forcing many
of our veterans to find additional means to fund education if they
choose to attend a school outside of their state, or to delay the start of
their education
altogether.
Asking our veterans to put their lives on hold after they have served our
country is simply unacceptable, and this change will provide veterans
with the resources they need to continue their education without
delay.
As your voice in
Washington, it is not only my priority, but also my job to represent you and
your interests, and I want to hear your thoughts on this proposal.
Please take a moment to answer the question below so I can better serve
you.
Do you believe veterans should receive in-state tuition rates
regardless of which state they choose to attend school? Yes - Our veterans' service should afford
them the ability to attend any public university of their choosing
without delay No - Public
universities should not be forced to change their in or out-of-state
policies for veterans Unsure *By answering this survey, you are subscribing to my

hear from you in the
future.
