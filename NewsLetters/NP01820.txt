[cid:image003.jpg@01D068B6.EE296050]
Alfonso Masga, David Attao, and Floyd Masga visited their congressional office this week. David is the Northern Marianas College Dean of Administration and Resource Development. Floyd is the Director of the Community Development Institute at NMC. They were in Washington to attend the Association of University Centers on Disabilities Directors meeting. Alfonso, Floyd's brother, currently resides in Baltimore. Thank you all for visiting.
Community Health Centers, CHIP benefit from House-passed "doc fix" bill - Community Health Center funding expands by $7.2 billion and the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, continues for another two years under terms of H.R. 2 , which passed the House Thursday on a bipartisan vote of 392-37. Although the Senate still must act on the bill, the White House has said that President Obama is in support. In the Northern Mariana Islands, the Kagman Community Health Center is receiving $887,173 in the current fiscal year. NMI CHIP, which provides health insurance for children from low-income families, receives about $999,756 this year and is expected to increase to $1,403,241 in fiscal 2016 in accordance with the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. H.R. 2 also fixes a long-standing problem with the reimbursement rates for doctors who treat patients on Medicare, the federal health insurance program for seniors.
Medicaid and CHIP Territory Transparency and Information Act introduced - Data for the insular areas is often in short supply; and without data it can be difficult to build a case for changes in federal law to benefit us. That is why I am an original cosponsor of the Medicaid and CHIP Territory Transparency and Information Act, introduced this week by Rep. Gus Bilirakis (R-Florida). The bill, H.R. 1570 , requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to publish online information on how Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, are carried out in American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Both Medicaid and CHIP provide medical care for those who cannot afford it. Currently, data for the 50 states and the District of Columbia is posted at the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services website, http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-State/By-State.html. H.R. 1570 requires that data from the insular areas be collected and posted, including the number and incomes of people enrolled in the two programs and the federal and local share of spending. Information will also be required about the Medicaid and CHIP plans in each insular area. Mr. Bilirakis is a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee to which H.R. 1570 has been referred.

Saipan resident Jose P. Mafnas, Jr. visited the congressional office while in DC for the 18th Annual Thurgood A. Marshall Memorial Moot Court Competition. Jose, a second year student at the University of California Davis School of Law, is part of a two-person team chosen to represent the school in this year's event. Congratulations, Mr. Mafnas, for being selected to represent UC Davis at this national competition, and thank you for visiting.
Making bank deposits more quickly available - A bill that requires funds deposited in Northern Mariana Islands banks be available within at least six business days received the okay from the House Financial Services Committee this week. H.R. 1367 , introduced by Congresswoman Amata Aumua Coleman Radewagen (R-American Samoa) and which I cosponsored, adds both American Samoa and the Northern Marianas to the areas covered by the Expedited Funds Availability Act. Currently, banks may hold funds for up to 21 days, a relic of the time when banking transactions were conducted by mail. Today, electronic data transmission significantly shortens the amount of time needed for deposits to clear. Congratulations to first-term Congresswoman Radewagen for moving her bill quickly through committee. In the last Congress, a similar bill H.R. 1679 , which I also cosponsored, passed the House, but was not taken up by the Senate. For a full explanation of this history see http://sablan.house.gov/press-release/house-approves-bill-speed-bank-deposits.

General Robinson briefed the office on the progress of the Air Force's Exercise and Divert Airfield Environmental Impact Statement. The Final EIS is expected to be released this summer. General Robinson took command in October and is responsible for over 46,000 Air Force personnel and all Air Force activities in the Pacific.
$410,831 for preserving our historic and cultural places in the Northern Marianas - The National Park Service announced today that the Commonwealth Division of Historic Preservation is receiving $410,831 in Historic Preservation Grant funding. The funds will be used to help preserve important historic and cultural places as well as providing technical assistance to private and public interests that seek to preserve and protect historic resources. Congratulations to the Division of Historic Preservation.

Ms. Eileen Sobeck, Assistant Administrator for the National Marine Fisheries Service, briefed the congressional office this week about the President's Fiscal Year 2016 budget proposal for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's fisheries program. Many of NOAA's fishery programs support local projects and programs in the Northern Mariana Islands such as fishery data collection, protection of sea turtles, and research in the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument. Accompanying Ms. Sobeck were Dr. Paul Doremus, Deputy Assistant Administrator for Operations for Fisheries, and Dr. Sunny Snider, Congressional Affairs Specialist.
