Over the last couple of months, I've been hearing a lot of concern from
back home about the changes to flood insurance as a result of the
Biggert-Waters Act of 2012. Given recent action on this front, I wanted
to write and update you on what is happening.
Last week the House passed H.R. 3370, the Homeowner Flood Insurance
Affordability Act, which I voted for and cosponsored. Similar
legislation has already passed the Senate, so the next step will be to
merge the House and Senate bills, in what is called a conference
report, before it goes to the President. While we wait to see what that
final bill looks like, I want to share several thoughts on what the
House passed legislation does, and the way it impacts individuals who
were hit with sudden cost increases from Biggert-Waters.
First, H.R. 3370 repeals the automatic insurance rate increase that
comes with selling a property under Biggert-Waters. Basically
Biggert-Waters said you couldn't sell a home and maintain the current,
or grandfathered, insurance rate, meaning buyers suddenly had to absorb
the new full rate which in many cases was a 10 or 15 fold increase.
H.R. 3370 fixes this problem by mandating that the insurance policy
stays with the property, regardless of the homeowner. Many people have
flagged this as a needed fix to me because the rate hikes at time of
sale were scaring off homebuyers.
Second, this bill fixes the problem with Biggert-Waters where
individuals would see premium increases based off flood maps that hadn't
yet been drawn. I ultimately decided to co-sponsor the Homeowner Flood
Insurance Affordability Act because the Biggert-Waters legislation that
passed last year, while well intended, was flawed in this regard. I
wasn't there during its passage, but in this case you had a bill that
put the cart before the horse. It allowed government to set new
premiums now and charge more without disclosure of how they were
deriving their new rates.
The frequency and size of storms, and even details like whether or not
they anticipate a high or low tide at landfall make for real
differences in calculating hypothetical damage that go straight to
impacting premiums that will be charged. As a conservative it seems
reasonable to say why and how, when government just says 'trust me,'
and the degree to which the original bill was flawed was highlighted by
the fact that even Rep. Maxine Waters cosponsored this bill that
amended her bill. A 'time-out' and delaying implementation of
Biggert-Waters accordingly made sense to me.
H.R. 3370 instead uses current flood maps to gauge increases. This
seems reasonable since they are the flood maps that now exist, and for
primary residences premium increases are limited to between 5 and 18%
per year. This change, which amounts to a delay, will allow individuals
to see why and how their premium is being calculated and also gives
them more time to adjust to their changing insurance premiums. For
second homes and businesses the increases will be limited to 25% a
year, again based on the current maps. Some I have talked to wish it
was less, and to this I would say it is much less than the several
hundred or thousand percent increases some folks were already seeing in
flood insurance premiums.
Third, it refunds those policyholders who paid the increases from
Biggert-Waters right off the bat. Those that bought a home and took on
large premium increases will be refunded the difference between the
higher amount they paid and the previous flood insurance rate. The same
situation applies for people that kept their homes and chose to pay the
higher rates to keep their coverage. Additionally, those who allowed
their flood insurance policies to lapse will be able to pick them back
up again at the previous rate.
Lastly, H.R. 3370 covers the costs of fixing Biggert-Waters, in
comparison with the Senate version of the bill, which has no offset to
pay for these changes. This means that taxpayers far from flood zones
are not on the hook for a slower approach to reforming the National
Flood Insurance Program in the way they would be with the Senate bill.
The bill covers the cost by charging ratepayers a $25 yearly fee for
primary residences and a $250 yearly fee for second homes and
businesses. Concurrently, the increases in premiums are intended to
help in moving the system to a rate that is closer to actuarially
sound, and thereby not add to the National Flood Insurance Program's
$24 billion liability.
While change is certain to come for the flood insurance program, it
needs to be done in a manner that gives markets and people the ability
to respond and plan. As Governor, my administration worked to reform
government so that it was less burdensome on the taxpayer, whether at
the Department of Transportation, the Department of Motor Vehicles, the
Department of Corrections or others, so I certainly hear and understand
the voices of those calling for changes to the National Flood Insurance
Program. But you can't solve the problem overnight, especially when it
involves considerable financial exposure for the individual who,
through no fault of their own, has relied on promises government has
made in the past. I think H.R. 3370 strikes a balance in the way it
helps correct some of the unintended problems that have resulted from
Biggert-Waters and still begins the process of reform.
Please forgive the long winded nature of this email, but given all I
have heard from folks along the coast on this I wanted to relay what I
have come to learn on this measure. I hope this information is helpful.

Over
the
last
couple
of
months,
I&#8217;ve
been
hearing
a
lot
of
concern
from
back
home
about
the
changes
to
flood
insurance
as
a
result
of
the
Biggert-Waters
Act
of
2012.
Given
recent
action
on
this
front,
I
wanted
to
write
and
update
you
on
what
is
happening.
Last
week
the
House
passed
H.R.
3370,
the
Homeowner
Flood
Insurance
Affordability
Act,
which
I
voted
for
and
cosponsored.
Similar
legislation
has
already
passed
the
Senate,
so
the
next
step
will
be
to
merge
the
House
and
Senate
bills,
in
what
is
called
a
conference
report,
before
it
goes
to
the
President.
While
we
wait
to
see
what
that
final
bill
looks
like,
I
want
to
share
several
thoughts
on
what
the
House
passed
legislation
does,
and
the
way
it
impacts
individuals
who
were
hit
with
sudden
cost
increases
from
Biggert-Waters.
First,
H.R.
3370
repeals
the
automatic
insurance
rate
increase
that
comes
with
selling
a
property
under
Biggert-Waters.
Basically
Biggert-Waters
said
you
couldn&#8217;t
sell
a
home
and
maintain
the
current,
or
grandfathered,
insurance
rate,
meaning
buyers
suddenly
had
to
absorb
the
new
full
rate
which
in
many
cases
was
a
10
or
15
fold
increase.
H.R.
3370
fixes
this
problem
by
mandating
that
the
insurance
policy
stays
with
the
property,
regardless
of
the
homeowner.
Many
people
have
flagged
this
as
a
needed
fix
to
me
because
the
rate
hikes
at
time
of
sale
were
scaring
off
homebuyers.
Second,
this
bill
fixes
the
problem
with
Biggert-Waters
where
individuals
would
see
premium
increases
based
off
flood
maps
that
hadn&#8217;t
yet
been
drawn.
I
ultimately
decided
to
co-sponsor
the
Homeowner
Flood
Insurance
Affordability
Act
because
the
Biggert-Waters
legislation
that
passed
last
year,
while
well
intended,
was
flawed
in
this
regard.
I
wasn't
there
during
its
passage,
but
in
this
case
you
had
a
bill
that
put
the
cart
before
the
horse.
It
allowed
government
to
set
new
premiums
now
and
charge
more
without
disclosure
of
how
they
were
deriving
their
new
rates.
The
frequency
and
size
of
storms,
and
even
details
like
whether
or
not
they
anticipate
a
high
or
low
tide
at
landfall
make
for
real
differences
in
calculating
hypothetical
damage
that
go
straight
to
impacting
premiums
that
will
be
charged.
As
a
conservative
it
seems
reasonable
to
say
why
and
how,
when
government
just
says
&#8216;trust
me,&#8217;
and
the
degree
to
which
the
original
bill
was
flawed
was
highlighted
by
the
fact
that
even
Rep.
Maxine
Waters
cosponsored
this
bill
that
amended
her
bill.
A
&#8216;time-out&#8217;
and
delaying
implementation
of
Biggert-Waters
accordingly
made
sense
to
me.
H.R.
3370
instead
uses
current
flood
maps
to
gauge
increases.
This
seems
reasonable
since
they
are
the
flood
maps
that
now
exist,
and
for
primary
residences
premium
increases
are
limited
to
between
5
and
18%
per
year.
This
change,
which
amounts
to
a
delay,
will
allow
individuals
to
see
why
and
how
their
premium
is
being
calculated
and
also
gives
them
more
time
to
adjust
to
their
changing
insurance
premiums.
For
second
homes
and
businesses
the
increases
will
be
limited
to
25%
a
year,
again
based
on
the
current
maps.
Some
I
have
talked
to
wish
it
was
less,
and
to
this
I
would
say
it
is
much
less
than
the
several
hundred
or
thousand
percent
increases
some
folks
were
already
seeing
in
flood
insurance
premiums.
Third,
it
refunds
those
policyholders
who
paid
the
increases
from
Biggert-Waters
right
off
the
bat.
Those
that
bought
a
home
and
took
on
large
premium
increases
will
be
refunded
the
difference
between
the
higher
amount
they
paid
and
the
previous
flood
insurance
rate.
The
same
situation
applies
for
people
that
kept
their
homes
and
chose
to
pay
the
higher
rates
to
keep
their
coverage.
Additionally,
those
who
allowed
their
flood
insurance
policies
to
lapse
will
be
able
to
pick
them
back
up
again
at
the
previous
rate.
Lastly,
H.R.
3370
covers
the
costs
of
fixing
Biggert-Waters,
in
comparison
with
the
Senate
version
of
the
bill,
which
has
no
offset
to
pay
for
these
changes.
This
means
that
taxpayers
far
from
flood
zones
are
not
on
the
hook
for
a
slower
approach
to
reforming
the
National
Flood
Insurance
Program
in
the
way
they
would
be
with
the
Senate
bill.
The
bill
covers
the
cost
by
charging
ratepayers
a
$25
yearly
fee
for
primary
residences
and
a
$250
yearly
fee
for
second
homes
and
businesses.
Concurrently,
the
increases
in
premiums
are
intended
to
help
in
moving
the
system
to
a
rate
that
is
closer
to
actuarially
sound,
and
thereby
not
add
to
the
National
Flood
Insurance
Program&#8217;s
$24
billion
liability.
While
change
is
certain
to
come
for
the
flood
insurance
program,
it
needs
to
be
done
in
a
manner
that
gives
markets
and
people
the
ability
to
respond
and
plan.
As
Governor,
my
administration
worked
to
reform
government
so
that
it
was
less
burdensome
on
the
taxpayer,
whether
at
the
Department
of
Transportation,
the
Department
of
Motor
Vehicles,
the
Department
of
Corrections
or
others,
so
I
certainly
hear
and
understand
the
voices
of
those
calling
for
changes
to
the
National
Flood
Insurance
Program.
But
you
can&#8217;t
solve
the
problem
overnight,
especially
when
it
involves
considerable
financial
exposure
for
the
individual
who,
through
no
fault
of
their
own,
has
relied
on
promises
government
has
made
in
the
past.
I
think
H.R.
3370
strikes
a
balance
in
the
way
it
helps
correct
some
of
the
unintended
problems
that
have
resulted
from
Biggert-Waters
and
still
begins
the
process
of
reform.
Please
forgive
the
long
winded
nature
of
this
email,
but
given
all
I
have
heard
from
folks
along
the
coast
on
this
I
wanted
to
relay
what
I
have
come
to
learn
on
this
measure.
I
hope
this
information
is
helpful.
