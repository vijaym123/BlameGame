Dear Fellow Hoosier,
In our last survey, a majority of you indicated Congress should focus
on job creation in 2014.
Over the last year, the House has passed
dozens of bills that would create jobs and stimulate economic growth.
One of those bills is the Northern Route Approval Act (H.R.3), which
would allow for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.
It's
estimated its construction would create tens of thousands of American
jobs and pump nearly a million barrels of oil to U.S. refineries each
day, helping to lower gas prices, boost economic growth, enhance our
energy security and revitalize manufacturing.
Now, I want to know what
you think about building the Keystone XL pipeline.
Please, take a few
minutes to answer this important survey.
Your opinion matters to me.
And, as always, if I can help you with any Federal matter, do not
hesitate to reach out to my offices in Shelbyville, Richmond, Muncie or
D.C.
Sincerely,
Luke Messer
Member of Congress

Things
to
Avoid:
Microsoft's
Outlook
mail

a

COMMENT:
Do
not
use
Table
"cellpadding"
or
Style
"margin-padding"

both

stripped

by
Outlook
2007

2010.
COMMENT:
Avoid
tables
that
are
more
than
a
single
"page"
(22
inches
or
1500
pixels)
in
height
because
they
will
leave
mysterious
horizontal
gaps

blank

between

otherwise
should
be
above

below
in

to
each
other.
COMMENT:
You
may
however
stack
shorter
