Help With a Federal Agency
Dear Friend-
This month, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee examined
waste in the federal government.
Needless to say, the picture is not
pretty - government has spent taxpayer money studying how Americans
view the filibuster, examining online romance, providing loan
guarantees for purchasing homes in Hawaii, subsidizing profitable
corporations, creating a health care website that didn't work, studying
how wives behave when arguing with their husbands, providing pay and
allowances to the Fort Hood shooter, having NASA study the operation of
Congress, running television ads with money supposedly meant for
hurricane relief, and by giving a grant to a company to develop a math
game based on the zombie apocalypse.
Even though various government
oversight agencies have recommended a number of programs that should be
streamlined, consolidated, or eliminated, Congress has consistently
failed to implement pro-taxpayer reforms.
Congress needs to take on
this problem; no other institution in American life would be able to
get away with this kind of waste.
Last weekend, I had the honor of presenting 35 candidates with
nominations to the four United States service academies: the United
States Military Academy, the United States Naval Academy, the United
States Air Force Academy, and the United States Merchant Marine
Academy. The ceremony was attended by attended by service academy
candidates and their families, the nominating board, Junior Reserve
Officers' Training Corps instructors, school officials, and other
members of the community.
The academy nomination process is rigorous and I know that these
candidates are among the best and brightest that Florida's sixth
district has to offer. I am very proud that so many dedicated students
want to serve our nation in the military!

This week, Congressman Thomas Massie introduced HR 3894, The Senior
Citizens Tax Elimination Act
to eliminate income taxes on Social Security
benefits. I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of this bill.
Congressman Massie's bill blows the whistle on the federal government
for double taxing the Social Security benefits of senior citizens.
Individuals already pay taxes to support Social Security, so there is
no reason why these earned benefits should be taxed on the back end.
Lastly, on Tuesday, President Barack Obama will address a joint session
of Congress, giving his State of the Union. With so many pressing
issues facing our nation, what topics do you hope the President will
speak on? Please like my Facebook page
or follow me on Twitter
and share your thoughts!
I look forward to hearing from you; please do not hesitate to contact
my Washington, Port Orange, or St. Augustine office should you need any
assistance.
Sincerely,
Congressman Ron DeSantis

Dear

This

the
Oversight
and
Government
Reform
Committee
examined
waste
in
the
federal
government.

the
picture
is
not
pretty
&#8211;
government
has
spent
taxpayer
money
studying
how
Americans
view
the
filibuster,
examining
online
romance,
providing
loan
guarantees
for
purchasing
homes
in
Hawaii,
subsidizing
profitable
corporations,
creating
a
health
care
website
that
didn&#8217;t
work,
studying
how
wives
behave
when
arguing
with
their
husbands,
providing
pay
and
allowances
to
the
Fort
Hood
shooter,
having
NASA
study
the
operation
of
Congress,
running
television
ads
with
money
supposedly
meant
for
hurricane
relief,
and
by
giving
a
grant
to
a
company
to
develop
a
math
game
based
on
the
zombie
apocalypse.
Even
though
various
government
oversight
agencies
have
recommended
a
number
of
programs
that
should
be
streamlined,
consolidated,
or
eliminated,
Congress
has
consistently
failed
to
implement
pro-taxpayer
reforms.
Congress
needs
to
take
on
this
problem;
no
other
institution
in
American
life
would
be
able
to
get
away
with
this
kind
of
waste.
Last

I
had
the
honor
of
presenting
35
candidates
with

to
the
four
United

service
academies:
the
United

Military
Academy,
the
United

the
United

Academy,
and
the
United

Merchant

Academy.
The
ceremony
was

by
attended
by
service
academy
candidates
and
their
families,
the
nominating
board,
Junior
Reserve
Officers'
Training
Corps
instructors,
school
officials,
and
other
members
of
the
community.
The
academy
nomination
process
is
rigorous
and
I
know
that
these
candidates
are
among
the
best

brightest
that
Florida's
sixth

I

very
proud
that

our
nation
in
the
military!

Ron

Congressman
Thomas
Massie

HR
3894,
The

Act
to
eliminate

Social

benefits.
I
am

this

Congressman
Massie's

blows
the
whistle
