Fixing a Broken System for
Seniors and Healthcare
Professionals
3/26/15
Today,
Congressman Doug Lamborn issued the following statement after his vote
supporting H.R. 2:
"Permanently solving the Sustainable Growth Rate problem that has plagued
Washington for over a decade and a half is the appropriate and
conservative thing to do, plain and simple.
Through a series of reforms to Medicare and
entitlements, this legislation prevents tens of billions of dollars from being
wasted on temporary yearly "fixes" that wreak havoc on the ability of
medical professionals to plan and anticipate their budget needs from year
to year. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has calculated
that H.R. 2 will save hundreds of billions of dollars over the next
twenty years. Indeed, these Medicare and entitlement reforms are so
distasteful to liberals that Harry Reid has already voiced opposition to
this plan.
Accomplishing this in a bipartisan fashion, without raising taxes, is a real
accomplishment. Solving the problems that hold back private sector
professionals is exactly why the American people sent us to
Washington."
