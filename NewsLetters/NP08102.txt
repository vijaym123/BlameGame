Grow it here, make it here!
New Biobased Manufacturing Plant Opens in Southwest Michigan
Marrone Bio Innovations Inc. (MBI), which is headquartered in
California, opened their new, state-of-the-art manufacturing facility
in Bangor last week.
Senator Stabenow recruited the company to come to
Michigan to join in the state's growing biobased manufacturing
industry. MBI is manufacturing innovative products at its new plant to
protect fruits and vegetables from pests and disease and to control
invasive zebra and quagga mussels, which have been a serious problem in
the Great Lakes.
"Today's grand opening of the Marrone Michigan
Manufacturing facility is great news for Southwest Michigan and our
entire state," said Stabenow. "We know how to grow things and make
things, so it's no surprise that MBI chose to invest right here in
Michigan. It's exciting to be back at MBI and see new biobased products
being manufactured that are supporting new jobs, helping our farmers,
and protecting our Great Lakes."

Senate Passes Measure to Improve Job Training, Give Workers Rights
Skills for New Jobs
The U.S. Senate passed a measure that will make job training more
efficient and responsive so that American workers can get training for

Innovation and Opportunity Act includes many provisions championed by
Senator Stabenow, including designing worker training based on the
requirements for jobs in high-growth sectors, strengthening youth
training programs, and increasing accountability to ensure that
taxpayer dollars are being spent responsibly. Additionally, the
legislation reduces red tape, improves oversight, and gives local
agencies more flexibility to meet the needs of local employers and job
seekers. "Michigan workers can compete with anyone in the world, but
they need the right skills and training opportunities to match the
needs of local businesses. This bill will help Michigan workers get the
training they need to land a good-paying job and build a better life
for their families," said Stabenow.
