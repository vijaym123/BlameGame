Utah Veterans Photo Gallery
#HonorUtahVeterans
Utah is home to over 150,000 veterans.
While each veteran
has their own unique experience in serving our country, our
appreciation for their service is universal.
As we approach Veterans Day
on November 11, I am creating a photo gallery display in my Senate
office memorializing the service of Utahs veterans.
If you are one
of the brave Americans who has served or is serving, or if you are the
friend or family member of a veteran - you are invited to share a
photograph on Instagram that captures their commitment to country and
their willingness to sacrifice. (Photos may be historical from their
period of active duty or a present day picture showcasing their spirit,
pride, honor and legacy.)
Please help me remember and
honor those who have stood tall for freedom and inspire the next
generation of Americans to do the same.
--Senator Mike
Lee
How to Participate
Based
on the number of submissions, photographs will be arranged in a gallery
in Senator Mike Lees DC and Utah offices, so that those who visit
these office can reflect on the great sacrifice made by our
veterans.
Here is how you can participate in this
event:
Share your photo that highlights a veterans service on
Instagram using this tag: #HonorUtahVeterans
We
will select at least one photo for the gallery from each user who
submits a photo using the designated hashtag.
If
you dont use Instagram, you can send an electronic version of your
photograph to photo_contest@lee.senate.gov.
Photos that are
submitted this way will be shared on Senator Lees Instagram account at the
discretion of Senator Lees office.
It is not
required, but we recommend that you follow @SenMikeLee on Instagram for
updates related to the Utah veteran photo
gallery.
On November 11 the gallery will be displayed in the offices of
Senator Lee, and entrants will be notified.
The
Submission period begins on 9/17/2014 and ends on
11/07/2014.
