Conaway Chronicle: National School Choice Week, Town Hall Meetings, Combating Human Trafficking, Local Chamber of Commerce Awards
__________________________________________
Thank you for reading The Conaway Chronicle, a review of my activities in Congress.
National School Choice Week
Thursday morning, I visited a social studies class at Midland Academy Charter School and had a great time talking with them about how Congress works. This week is National School Choice Week, and I believe it is important that we empower students, parents, and educators to make decisions that are right for each individual student. A one-size-fits-all approach to education is not in the best interest of any student.
Town Hall Meetings in Llano, Mason, San Saba, and Brady
I held two town hall meetings with constituents in Llano and Mason this morning, and this afternoon I will hold two more, one in San Saba and one in Brady. To join me at future town hall meetings in the district, please

Combating Human Trafficking
Human trafficking is sadly becoming more and more prevalent in todays society. Each year, 800,000 women, men, and children fall victim to human trafficking, making it the fastest growing business of organized crime in the world. This week, the House of Representatives voted on 12 pieces of legislation to protect survivors of human trafficking, help free those currently enslaved, and prevent future attempts to traffic humans. Many of these bills were passed by the House of Representatives last Congress, but languished in the Senate under then Majority Leader Reid. Im hopeful that under new Majority Leader McConnell, these bills to stop trafficking and create a safer world for our children will finally receive the attention they so desperately need.
Constituents Receive Local Chamber of Commerce Awards
At this year's Dublin, Texas Chamber of Commerce awards presentation, many local businesses were honored for their contributions to the community. Colin and April Thomson of Thomson Services, pictured below, were presented with the Faith in the Future award. It's been a great year for them- they were also named the Texas Rural Challenge "Texas Strong" Business of the Year! Luke Wade, a Dublin, Texas native and a contestant on the last season of The Voice, also made a special appearance at the event to help present the awards.
Later in the week I had the pleasure of attending the San Angelo Chamber of Commerce awards ceremony, where Dr. Carol Ann Bonds was named the 2014 Citizen of the Year. She has served as Superintendent of San Angelo Independent School District since 2006, and has made immeasurable contributions to the San Angelo community during that time.

Rep. Mike Conaway, 11th District
