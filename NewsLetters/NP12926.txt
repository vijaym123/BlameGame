State of the Union Address
The
president spoke tonight and outlined many serious issues facing our
country, including our still stagnant economy, a suffocating national debt,
low wages for hardworking Americans, the education of our students, and
more.
I agree with the
president
the challenges we face are
great.
Click here , or on the image above to watch my full
response to the State of the Union Address.
But the president and I
disagree about how we can best achieve the positive results we need to move
our country forward. Many of the Presidents ideas require bigger
government involvement with more spending, higher taxes and larger and
more burdensome mandates and regulations.
A growing
government means shrinking opportunities.
