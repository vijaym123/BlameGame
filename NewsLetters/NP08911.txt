Heller Statement to Honor Bravery,
Sacrifice of Americas Armed Forces
on 70th Anniversary of D-Day
(Washington, D.C.)
Seventy
years ago, on June 6, 1944, Allied forces
began their invasion of Normandy. One of
historys largest seaborne attacks,
the D-Day battle began as 156,000 American,
British and Canadian forces landed on five
heavily-fortified beaches.
Heller offered this statement in honor
of the bravery of those who battled and the
great sacrifices made on that day:
Today, we honor the brave
Nevadans and all Americans who risked their
lives defending our liberty on the beaches
of Normandy, France 70 years ago. The
sacrifices our brave Armed Forces made on
this day set America and the world on a
path to peace, freedom, and liberty that
all Americans enjoy today.
What is known as D-Day marked the
beginning of the demise of one of the worst
enemies that the Unites States has ever had
to face. The brave men that stormed Omaha
Beach sacrificed their lives, their
ambitions, and their relationships with
loved ones to liberate those who were
enslaved by the Nazis.
Their courage demonstrated that
America would not sit idly by as countries
across the Atlantic suffered, reaffirming
Americas belief that violations of
basic human rights will not be tolerated.
Their unwavering service is what has made
this country so great and a beacon of
democracy. These men believed that freedom
was worth fighting for and that reflects
what is most inspiring about the United
States of America.
Our service members
commitment to this country, as well as
their dedication to their families and
communities, exemplified why the legacy of
all World War II veterans must be preserved
for generations to come. These heroes
truly are the Greatest
Generationselflessly serving not for
recognition, but because it was the right
thing to do.
Today, 70 years ago, Americans
stood against tyranny and persevered. The
brave men and women who risked everything
to come to the aid of others deserve our
respect and appreciation. It is extremely
humbling to be able to be in France today
on behalf of my fellow Nevadans as we
commemorate the brave actions that allowed
the Allied troops to defeat tyranny,
said Senator Dean Heller.
In honor of the 70
th
anniversary, Senator Dean
Heller joined with Senator Patrick Leahy
(D-VT) to lead a Senate delegation to
attend ceremonies at sites of the D-Day
landings.
