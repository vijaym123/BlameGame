A Major Step Toward Equality For All
Dear Friend,
Today, the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision not to review same-sex marriage cases in Virginia and four other states cleared the way for same-sex marriages to begin taking place in the Commonwealth.
In letting the Fourth Circuit's decision stand, the Supreme Court has given loving couples across the Commonwealth the freedom to marry. I join countless Virginians in celebrating the end of the discriminatory constitutional ban that has denied same-sex couples this fundamental right. Today, we have taken a major step toward Jefferson&rsquo;s ideal that &ldquo;all men are created equal.&rdquo;
I invite you to join the conversation on
Twitter

Sincerely,
Senator Tim Kaine
