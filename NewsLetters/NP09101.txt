Friends,
I'm sure you have heard by now that Department of Veterans Affairs
Secretary Eric Shinseki has resigned
.
I believe President Obama made the right decision in accepting his
resignation. Secretary Shinseki has a distinguished military record and
has served his country honorably. However, accountability has been
severely lacking at the VA, and it is important to send a message that
failing our veterans will not be tolerated.
I'm less interested in who gets the blame and more interested in what
we can do to fix the problems. I believe there are three ways that
Congress, President Obama, and the VA leadership can immediately work
together toward resolving this current crisis:
1.) Increase Accountability. Last week the House passed the VA
Management Accountability Act, which removes legal barriers for swiftly
firing senior-level VA bureaucrats who aren't getting the job done.
This is a bi-partisan bill that passed with overwhelming support in the
House. Now the Senate needs to fast track its passage and the President
should then sign it into law.
2.) Priority funding. The Senate should quickly approve its VA
appropriations bill. In the House, we passed our appropriations bill
for the VA last month. The bill increases funding for veterans health
services, with special funding directed toward mental healthcare,
suicide prevention, and fixing the electronic record problems that have
contributed to the backlog. The Senate should act swiftly so we can
work out any differences and send a final bill to President Obama.
3.) Utilize non-VA resources. The Department of Veterans Affairs must
utilize its Patient Centered Community Care program
, which allows VA medical centers to contract with local
hospitals or clinics to get veterans care quickly and efficiently. We
know there is increased demand, probably more than current VA resources
can handle. So why not utilize this existing program to contract with
local providers and get veteran patients the care they need, especially
when the alternative is putting a veteran on a waiting list?
Time is of the essence. Our nation's military operates under the
premise of leaving no man behind. Right now, too many American veterans
are being left behind. The change in leadership is a positive first
step, yet it is just one step toward getting our veterans the care they
deserve.
Military Academy Appointments
One of the highlights of my job is being able to nominate young men and
women for an appointment to our nation's military academies. I have the
utmost respect for any individual who signs up to serve their country
in the armed forces. These students have shown academic, leadership and
character qualities that make them excellent candidates for a military
academy.
I hope you'll join me in congratulating the following students:
*	Joshua Aaron Alseben. A Dothan native, Joshua is the son of
Stephen and Vivian Alsleben. He is currently enrolled at Houston
Academy in Dothan. Alsleben received an official appointment to the
United States Air Force Academy.
*	Timothy Aaron Brown. A Midland City native, Timothy is the son
of Dr. Bryan and Donna Brown. He is currently attending Providence
Christian School in Dothan. Brown received an official appointment to
the United States Air Force Academy.
*	Joseph Elwood Flemming. A Prattville native, Joseph is the son
of Robert and Dawn Flemming. He is currently attending school at
Prattville Christian Academy. Flemming received an official appointment
to the United States Naval Academy.
*	Nicholas James Godeke. An Ozark native, Nicholas is the son of
Robert and Virginia Godeke. He is a student at Carroll High School in
Ozark. Godeke received an official appointment from the United States
Military Academy (West Point).
*	Robert Preston Kennedy. A Montgomery native, Robert is the son
of Robert and Claire Kennedy. He is currently attending Ezekiel Academy
in Montgomery. Kennedy received an official appointment to the United
States Military Academy (West Point).
*	Thomas Edward Lambert. Also a Montgomery resident, Thomas is
the son of Stephen and Laura Lambert. He is a student at Loveless
Academic Magnet Program (LAMP) in Montgomery. Lambert received an
official appointment to the United States Naval Academy.
*	Kenneth Wayne Levens. Another Prattville native, Kenneth is the
son of Cathy Levens and the late Kenneth Levens. He is a student at
Prattville High School. Levens received an official appointment to the
United States Naval Academy.
*	Richard E. McCant. Another Montgomery native, Richard is the
son of Kazumi McCant. He is also a student at Loveless Academic Magnet
Program (LAMP). McCant received an official appointment to the United
States Air Force Academy.
*	Ryan Christopher Seamands. An Enterprise resident, Ryan is the
son of Tammy and Greg Seamands. He is currently a student at Enterprise
High School. Seamands received an official appointment to the United
States Military Academy (West Point).
*	Zachary John Willis. Also a Prattville native, Zachary is the
son of Jeff and Rachel Jones. He is currently also in school at
Prattville Christian Academy. Willis received an official appointment
to the United States Air Force Academy.
I know I join their families, teachers and friends in congratulating
these students on such a momentous accomplishment. I wish them all the
best in the next chapter of their lives.
Change of Command at Maxwell
Our area is fortunate to be home to two outstanding military
installations, but sometimes that means we see a number of strong
commanders come and go. This week the 42ndAir Base Wing at Maxwell Air
Force Base saw a change in command
. Colonel
Trent Edwards, who I had the pleasure of working closely with during my
time in Congress, relinquished control to new commander Colonel Andrea
Tullos.
I think Montgomery Mayor Todd Strange is right to call Col. Edwards the
"Mayor of Maxwell."
He has played a very
important role in our local community and helped to grow our area's
sense of pride even more. His leadership at Maxwell will be sorely
missed, but I know he will continue to provide exemplary service to our
nation.
While I know we will miss Col. Edwards, I am excited to work with and
get to know Col. Tullos. She previously served as the Chief of the
Arabian Peninsula and Iraq Division in the Strategic Plans and Policy
and Policy Directorate on the Joint Staff and comes to Maxwell with
prior command service.
While votes in Washington prevented me from attending the Change of
Command ceremony, I was glad members of my staff were there on behalf
of our office. I know I speak for all of us in welcoming Col. Tullos to
Maxwell and the River Region!
The Week Ahead
Next week marks another District Work Week, dedicated time for Members
of Congress to meet with their constituents back in the district. We
have visits planned in Montgomery, Dothan, Troy, Brundidge, Ozark, and
on post at Fort Rucker. You can keep up-to-date on my travel throughout
the district on Facebook
and Twitter
.
As always, please let me know
if I can do anything for you or your family. My staff
and I are always here to help.

EMAIL
UPDATE
By
subscribing
to
my
email updates,
you
are
authorizing
me
to
send
regular
email
updates
from
my
office
to
your
email
account. Friends,
I&#8217;m
sure
you
have
heard
by
now
that
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
Secretary
Eric
Shinseki
has
resigned .
I
believe
President
Obama
made
the
right
decision
in
accepting
his
resignation.
Secretary
Shinseki
has
a
distinguished
military
record
and
has
served
his
country
honorably.
However,
accountability
has
been
severely
lacking
at
the
VA,
and
it
is
important
to
send
a
message
that
failing
our
veterans
will
not
be
tolerated.
I&#8217;m
less
interested
in
who
gets
the
blame
and
more
interested
in
what
we
can
do
to
fix
the
problems.
I
believe
there
are
three
ways
that
Congress,
President
Obama,
and
the
VA
leadership
can
immediately
work
together
toward
resolving
this
current
crisis:
1.)
Increase
Accountability .
Last
week
the
House
passed
the
VA
Management
Accountability
Act,
which
removes
legal
barriers
for
swiftly
firing
senior-level
VA
bureaucrats
who
aren&#8217;t
getting
the
job
done. This
is
a
bi-partisan
bill
that
passed
with
overwhelming
support
in
the
House.
Now
the
Senate
needs
to
fast
track
its
passage
and
the
President
should
then
sign
it
into
law.
2.)
Priority
funding .
The
Senate
should
quickly
approve
its
VA
appropriations
bill.
In
the
House,
we
passed
our
appropriations
bill
for
the
VA
last
month.
The
bill
increases
funding
for
veterans
health
services,
with
special
funding
directed
toward
mental
healthcare,
suicide
prevention,
and
fixing
the
electronic
record
problems
that
have
contributed
to
the
backlog.
The
Senate
should
act
swiftly
so
we
can
work
out
any
differences
and
send
a
final
bill
to
President
Obama.
3.)
Utilize
non-VA
resources .
The
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
must
utilize
its
Patient
Centered
Community
Care
program ,
which
allows
VA
medical
centers
to
contract
with
local
hospitals
or
clinics
to
get
veterans
care
quickly
and
efficiently.
We
know
there
is
increased
demand,
probably
more
than
current
VA
resources
can
handle.
So
why
not
utilize
this
existing
program
to
contract
with
local
providers
and
get
veteran
patients
the
care
they
need,
especially
when
the
alternative
is
putting
a
veteran
on
a
waiting
list?
Time
is
of
the
essence.
Our
nation&#8217;s
military
operates
under
the
premise
of
leaving
no
man
behind.
Right
now,
too
many
American
veterans
are
being
left
behind.
The
change
in
leadership
is
a
positive
first
step,
yet
it
is
just
one
step
toward
getting
our
veterans
the
care
they
deserve.

Change
of
Command
at
Maxwell
Our
area
is
fortunate
to
be
home
to
two
outstanding
military
installations,
but
sometimes
that
means
we
see
a
number
of
strong
commanders
come
and
go.
This
week
the
42 nd Air
Base
Wing
at
Maxwell
Air
Force
Base
saw
a
change
in
command .
Colonel
Trent
Edwards,
who
I
had
the
pleasure
of
working
closely
with
during
my
time
in
Congress,
relinquished
control
to
new
commander
Colonel
Andrea
Tullos.
I
think
Montgomery
Mayor
Todd
Strange
is
right
to
call
Col.
Edwards
the
&#8220;Mayor
of
Maxwell.&#8221;
He
has
played
a
very
important
role
in
our
local
community
and
helped
to
grow
our
area&#8217;s
sense
of
pride
even
more.
His
leadership
at
Maxwell
will
be
sorely
missed,
but
I
know
he
will
continue
to
provide
exemplary
service
to
our
nation.
While
I
know
we
will
miss
Col.
Edwards,
I
am
excited
to
work
with
and
get
to
know
Col.
Tullos.
She
previously
served
as
the
Chief
of
the
Arabian
Peninsula
and
Iraq
Division
in
the
Strategic
Plans
and
Policy
and
Policy
Directorate
on
the
Joint
Staff
and
comes
to
Maxwell
with
prior
command
service.
While
votes
in
Washington
prevented
me
from
attending
the
Change
of
Command
ceremony,
I
was
glad
members
of
my
staff
were
there
on
behalf
of
our
office.
I
know
I
speak
for
all
of
us
in
welcoming
Col.
Tullos
to
Maxwell
and
the
