Confirmed: Two Judges For PA's Eastern District
Watch video
This week, the Senate confirmed Gerald McHugh and Edward Smith as federal judges for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Sen. Bob Casey and I recommended these judges to President Obama. Gerald McHugh will join our talented jurists in Philadelphia, while Edward Smith will sit in Easton, which has gone without a federal judge for a decade.

Judge Gerald McHugh, Sen. Pat Toomey, and Judge Edward Smith.
Sen. Casey and I have worked together to select qualified jurists to fill vacancies on the bench in Pennsylvania. The approval of these two excellent candidates demonstrates the strength and effectiveness of our bipartisan system, which has led to the confirmation of 10 highly qualified men and women to the federal bench in Pennsylvania since I joined the Senate in 2011.
Honoring Philly's Legendary WWII Vet "Wild Bill" Guarnere
Philly's William "Wild Bill" Guarnere
Senator Bob Casey and I have introduced a bipartisan resolution honoring the life and heroism of
William "Wild Bill" Guarnere
and the members of Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division.
You might know them as the "Band of Brothers."
Easy Company parachuted into Normandy, held fast in Bastogne, and liberated Dachau. They are a symbol of the incredible American effort in Europe in World War II.
Philly's "Wild Bill" Guarnere, who passed away on March 8 th , was one of the last of them. He came home without a leg, eschewed the term "hero," and served as an advocate for veterans once they returned from war. All Americans can be proud of this magnificent unit, which counted 12 original members from Pennsylvania.

Welcoming The American Legion
It was my pleasure to host representatives of the

Discussing Delaware River Dredging With The Army Corps Of Engineers
I met with Lt. Col. Chris Becking, Philadelphia District Commander of the Army Corps of Engineers, to discuss ongoing projects to deepen the Delaware River. The Delaware River is critical to the economy of our entire region, supporting jobs across sectors and industries. It's especially vital for our exporters and refiners in the Commonwealth. I was glad to get Lt. Col. Becking's update on how to deepen this vital waterway in an environmentally responsible fashion.
Hosting Pittsburgh &amp; Philly's Hispanic Chambers Of Commerce
It was my pleasure to host representatives from the
Pittsburgh Metropolitan Area Hispanic Chamber of Commerce
and the
Greater Philadelphia Hispanic Chamber of Commerce . We met just outside the Senate chamber in the U.S. Capitol.
Pittsburgh Metropolitan Area Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Chairman Ron Alvarado, President and CEO of the Greater Philadelphia Hispanic Chamber Varsovia Fernandez, and Sen. Pat Toomey.
