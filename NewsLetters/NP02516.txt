The Threat
of ISIL Requires Clear and Bold
Action
Dear Friend,
It has been more than six months since
President Obama addressed the nation about
the growing threat of the Islamic State in
Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and commenced
air strikes against its forces. This
radical Islamic organization has
deliberately perpetrated unspeakable acts
of terror against innocent people over
these months. This includes the heinous
murder of American, Japanese, and Jordanian
hostages, as well as the occupation of vast
territory in Iraq and Syria, forcing tens
of thousands of Iraqis and Syrians into
refugee status.
Last week, we learned that an ISIL
offshoot in Libya brutally murdered 21
Egyptian Christians and has occupied
territory along the Egyptian border,
demonstrating that the reach of this
radical organization is spreading outside
Iraq and Syria. Clearly, the dangers ISIL
presents are extending beyond isolated,
despicable acts of violence and becoming a
more significant threat to the Middle East
at large.
Our allies need bold and clearly-defined
leadership from the United States, as the
strength and safety of our friends in the
region are vital to our own national
security. We cannot tolerate the
proliferation of violent Islamic extremism
in the Middle East and open the door to
institutional terror spreading beyond the
region.
While long overdue, I was pleased that
the President finally began the process of
seeking the appropriate congressional
authorization to combat ISIL. The
Constitution requires the President to
obtain authorization from Congress to wage
war, and the American people and their
representatives in Congress must be
afforded the opportunity to engage in an
honest and candid debate on the scope of
any military action before sending our
brave men and women in uniform into
harms way.
This week, the House Armed Services
Committee will hold the first in a series
of hearings on the Presidents
Authorization for Use of Military Force
request. It is my hope that through these
hearings, we will explore exactly what will
be required of the American people and of
our brave men and women in uniform if we
expand the scope of our engagement.
Congressional oversight provides a critical
opportunity for the President and his
Administration to provide greater detail
about strategy for engagement, troop
levels, and end goals of the conflict.
I am hopeful that these and future
hearings will give the American people a
clearer picture of the strategy and tactics
we will deploy along with our coalition
allies to stop the evil force that is
ISIL.
