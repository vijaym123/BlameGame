Congressman Lamborn Works to Protect the Sanctions Against
Iran
5/15/14
On Thursday, May 15th, in response to news reports
indicating that companies with U.S. government contracts are
participating in a business expo in Iran, Congressman Doug Lamborn sent
official correspondence to Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew. Congressman
Lamborn is urging the Secretary to implement the appropriate measures
that will ensure that doing business with Iran will disqualify
companies from future business with the U.S. government.
Congressman Lamborn has been the Congressional
leader on this issue. During last week's markup process with the 2015
National Defense Authorization Act, he inserted language requiring that
the Secretary of Defense provides a report to Congress detailing the
DOD contractors that have conducted business with Iran. The Congressman
has also brought this issue to the attention of Secretary of Defense.
Congressman Lamborn serves
as the Co-Chair of the Republican Israel Caucus and the Bipartisan
Israel Allies Caucus and is one of the strongest voices in Congress for
standing firm against the Iranian government.
