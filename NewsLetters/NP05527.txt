Rep. Bob Goodlatte
Ditch the
Rule
The EPA under the Obama Administration has carried out an aggressive regulatory agenda. In April, the EPA and
the Army Corps of Engineers issued a proposed rule to expand the scope of the term &ldquo;waters of the United States,&rdquo; which are those waters
that are regulated under the
Clean Water Act . This move would seem to dramatically expand the EPA&rsquo;s authority over regulating waterways
and place even more small streams, creeks, manmade ponds, and seasonally-wet areas under the agency&rsquo;s control.
Congress intended the states and federal government to implement the
Clean Water Act
as a
federal-state partnership, but this rule would hinder that partnership and expand regulatory overreach. Plus, the EPA cannot re-write the law,
expanding their jurisdiction at a whim. Only Congress can grant that authority.
The Waters of the U.S. rule would have an impact on numerous industries and jobs and has drawn criticism from many groups. Interestingly
enough, just last week, the Small Business Administration&rsquo;s Office of Advocacy even asked the EPA to withdraw the pending rule stating concerns
that the rule will have &ldquo;a direct and potentially costly impact on small businesses.&rdquo;
The economic impacts and uncertainty caused by the Waters of the U.S. rule made it clear that Congress must act to stop the
EPA from expanding the scope of the law. In response, the House of Representatives passed
H.R. 5078 , the
Waters of the United States Regulatory Overreach
Protection Act , with overwhelming bipartisan support. This legislation, which I cosponsored, also upholds the federal-state partnership and
requires that federal agencies consult with state and local officials to put together recommendations for a regulatory proposal.
The impact of the Waters of the U.S. rule on farmers, landowners, local economies, and jobs is
very real. Protecting America&rsquo;s waterways is critical, but continued power grabs by the EPA is not the solution. It&rsquo;s time to ditch this
rule.

Roanoke Couple Named 'Angels in Adoption'
As a member of the Congressional Coalition on
Adoption, each year I have the opportunity to celebrate individuals, couples, or organizations in the Sixth District that have made an extraordinary
contribution on behalf of children in need of homes. Patrick and Judy Wheeler have a passion for adoption and a true heart for children in need. It is
my honor to recognize them as this year&rsquo;s &quot;Angels in Adoption.&quot; Mrs. Wheeler recently said that &quot;most people were thinking of
retirement, but our hearts are with these children.&quot; Despite many challenges and long adoption processes, the Wheelers have blessed 11 young
children with the loving home and opportunities they deserve. I am thankful for their willingness to bring these children into their family. This
selfless act is truly to be commended. I was honored to meet Patrick and Judy, as well as several of their children, at a
ceremony in Washington recently .
The Wheelers, who reside in Roanoke, have adopted seven children from China and three from Vietnam
as well as one child from the Roanoke area. Eight of their adopted children are cleft affected and the Wheelers have ensured that these children
receive the surgeries, treatment, and loving care that they need. They also have two biological children and four grandchildren.
Is the President Sacrificing the Constitution &amp; National Security for his Agenda?
This week, the
Wall Street Journal
reported
that President Obama is considering plans to override
the law and transfer detained terrorists from Guantanamo Bay to the United States. Over the years, President Obama has repeatedly sought to close
federal facilities in Guantanamo Bay and bring detained terrorists to the United States but both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have
consistently rejected the President&rsquo;s plan over and over again. Although the law is explicit that the President cannot transport these detained
terrorists into the United States, President Obama once again seems willing to ignore the law to achieve his objectives.
The President&rsquo;s pattern of ignoring the law poses a
danger not only to our Constitution and individual liberty, but also to national security. At a time when the Islamic State is killing innocent
civilians, including Americans, how can the President even justify contemplating such a plan? President Obama has shown that he is willing to
sacrifice both the Constitution and the security of the United States for his own agenda.
