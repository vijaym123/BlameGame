Protecting Energy
Jobs
On Monday, I attended a hearing with
Senator David Vitter on the EPAs efforts to increase the ozone pollution
standard imposed on businesses.
The EPAs proposal would do
little to help our environment and could cost Louisiana
up to 116,983 jobs .
I will work to protect Louisiana jobs
from the EPA.
You can watch my interview with WBRZ on this
subject
here .
Ending Illegal Immigration
Alongside Louisiana Congressmen Charles Boustany, John Fleming,
Vance McAllister and Steve Scalise,
I urged Harry
Reid
to call the Senate back in session and address the immigration
crisis.
Its disappointing that Senate Democrats chose to
leave town without addressing the problems at the border.
I urge
the Senate to pass the House bill, which secures our border and stops
President Obama's executive amnesty.
Fixing the VA
I am
pleased that the Veterans Affairs reform bill passed by Congress
was signed into law .
It authorizes
clinics in Lafayette and Lake Charles and includes my proposal for a
three-year extension of a pilot program that helps veterans suffering from
traumatic brain injury.
This is good news for Louisiana
veterans.
