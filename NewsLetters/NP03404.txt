[Surrounded by friends, family members, and staff, and alongside Speaker of the House John Boehner, I placed my hand on the Holy Bible provided for taking the oath of office by the Rt. Reverend Tomas Camacho, formerly Bishop of Chalan Kanoa. Holding the Bible is my wife Andrea. Also pictured are Martha and Eric Sablan and their children Kamaryn, Kaylee and Jon Ethan, Mr. Craig Cabrera, Ms. Patricia Sablan, Mr. Robert Schwalbach, Ms. Jude Marfil, and Ms. Erika Webb.]

114th Congress convenes - Along with the other members of the 114th U.S. House of Representatives, I took the oath of office on Tuesday, beginning my fourth term representing the people of the Northern Mariana Islands. Even after six years the responsibility I feel to improve the lives of everyone in our islands has not faded, nor has the humility I feel when I stand in the House chamber, where so much of our nations history has taken place, knowing that you, the people of the Northern Marianas, have chosen me to speak in Congress on your behalf. In this first day the House also selects a Speaker. John Boehner (R-Ohio) will continue to serve, as he has in the preceding two Congresses. The House adopts its rules, too. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-District of Columbia) offered a motion to refer the rules to a select committee to report on whether there is any reason to deny the representatives from the non-State areas of America, such as the District or the Northern Mariana Islands, the right to vote in the Committee of the Whole House. The Committee is where most legislation is debated and amended and when the House has been controlled by Democrats, the non-State representatives have been allowed to vote. Republicans voted down Ms. Nortons motion, so non-State areas will continue to be denied the vote in the 114th Congress.

[The new, 114th Congress began on Tuesday, January 6, 2015. Our Opening Day Open House was packed with constituents from the nearby areas, friends we have made over the last six years from the Labor Department, Homeland Security, and Defense, and other Members of Congress, including Hawaiis senior Senator Mazie K. Hirono, pictured lower left. Thanks to all who took the time to attend and thanks to the people of the Northern Mariana Islands who have entrusted me to represent them here in Congress for another two years.]
16% NAP benefit increase for Saipan takes effect - Food stamp beneficiaries on Saipan were scheduled to receive a 16 percent increase in their benefits beginning January 1, 2015. The Saipan increase followed a 28 percent increase for Tinian and 62 percent for Rota and the Northern Islands that took effect in May of last year. Once again, I want to congratulate Mr. Walter Macaranas and all of the Nutritional Assistance Program personnel who did the hard work of collecting data to ensure that these increases do not exceed the funding that Congress provides for the nutrition assistance program. I also want to thank Ms. Audrey Rowe, Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service at the Department of Agriculture, who made the final decision to authorize the increases on all of our islands to help needy families afford nutritious meals. Below is a table showing the new benefit levels for all islands. Beginning in the next fiscal year, a pilot program is scheduled to begin that will move the Northern Marianas closer to the national Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The pilot program was approved and funded in the Agricultural Act of 2014, crafted while I was a member of the Agriculture Committee. Beginning in October of this year another $30.5 million will also become available to further increase benefits in the Northern Marianas. 7 out of every 8 persons we are feeding is a child, a senior, or a person who is mentally or physically disabled.
