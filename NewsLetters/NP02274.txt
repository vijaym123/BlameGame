Rep. Bob Goodlatte
ATF Abandons Second Amendment Attack
The United States Constitution is not a document of suggestions for how the U.S. should be governed. It&rsquo;s not a
&ldquo;choose your own adventure&rdquo; novel where you can pick which portion to follow and ignore the rest. The Constitution is the framework for
our entire system of government and provides for the protection of our rights and liberties as Americans. Actions by the Executive Branch to
unilaterally change our laws are in direct contradiction with the separation of powers outlined by the Constitution.
Unfortunately, President Obama recently attempted to use his pen and phone to stretch his authority to
implement more policies that Congress has refused to enact, this time to deprive Americans of their Second Amendment rights. Sadly, we&rsquo;ve seen
this before from the President regarding our immigration and drug laws as well as Obamacare changes.
Under the Administration&rsquo;s command, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) made a move to
change a longstanding exemption to ban a popular, affordable bullet used for the AR-15. Americans own more than five million AR-15s, which are the
most commonly used rifles for shooting sports as well as home protection. This backdoor attempt to ban the production and sale of M855 ammunition
would have impacted many law-abiding gun owners and restricted the American people&rsquo;s ability to legally and responsibly exercise their Second
Amendment rights.
Folks in the Sixth District are fed up with actions
like these, and 239 bipartisan Members of Congress &ndash; a clear, sizeable majority of the House &ndash; agree that this attack on the Second
Amendment is wrong and should be stopped immediately. In response to the Administration&rsquo;s actions,
on March 4th I led a letter to the ATF , signed by this bipartisan
group of Members, in firm opposition to this ban.
After much
pressure from Congress and Second Amendment supporters,
on March
10th the ATF announced
that it would abandon its attack on the Second Amendment. While this is good news, we must continue to steadfastly protect
the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens. I respect the Second Amendment, and urge the President to halt any future actions that would
infringe upon the rights afforded to all Americans.

Another
Secret Service Scandal
- Agents' Actions
Unacceptable
News
reports this week
revealed another scandal within the Secret
Service. The Secret Service is tasked with protecting the White House, but once again another incident makes the agency look more like it&rsquo;s
partying in &quot;Animal House.&quot; Not only did the two agents endanger their own lives and innocent civilians by potentially choosing to drink and
drive, they also imperiled the entire White House complex by disrupting an active bomb investigation. Such poor judgement warrants severe consequences
and also raises questions that the Secret Service has not learned the tough lessons it should have following other recent scandals.
The House Judiciary Committee has conducted aggressive oversight of the Secret Service and
will continue to do so. Incidents like this are completely unacceptable and must stop. At the Committee&rsquo;s oversight hearing last year, Director
Clancy pledged to make necessary improvements at the agency to rein in abuses and ensure professionalism. I intend to hold him to this promise and
work with him to ensure the President, White House personnel, and innocent civilians are protected from threats from outside entities and now from
within the agency itself.
Don't forget about Open Door Meetings held by staff each month in Sixth District
communities!
