Dear
Friend,
...weve
seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by
two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care
inflation at its lowest rate in fifty years.
- President Barack Obama, 2015 State of the Union
Address
Last night President Obama addressed the
country and laid out his plan to focus the nations policies on
middle-class economics. Below are a few of the highlights from the Presidents
address that I felt would be particularly relevant to you. You can
also
follow my social media
responses .
The President reminded us of the substantial progress
our economy has made during his time in office. More importantly, he
recognized that while our economy has come back strong, there are too
many Americans who work hard every day but have not seen the benefits
of our economic progress in their daily
lives:
Its now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next fifteen
years, and for decades to come. Will we accept an economy where only a
few of us do spectacularly well?
Or will we commit ourselves to
an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who
makes the effort?
Today, we have new tools to
stop taxpayer-funded bailouts, and a new consumer watchdog to protect
us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices.
And
in the past year alone, about ten million uninsured Americans finally
gained the security of health coverage.
So
the verdict is clear.
Middle-class economics works.
Expanding opportunity works.
And these policies will continue to work,
as long as politics dont get in the way.
We cant slow down
businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal
showdowns.
College affordability as well as
expanding higher education was a core component of the Presidents plan.
The President stressed the need to reduce the student loan burden on
students and graduates so that they are not deprived of economic
security due to onerous debt. Additionally, he presented his plan to make
two years of community college free to all American students willing to
put in the hard work:
We still live in a
country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the
education they need.
Its not fair to them, and its not smart for
our future.Thats why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to
lower the cost of community college
to
zero.
I want to spread that idea all across America, so that two years of
college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is
today.
President Obama spoke on our national
security, particularly our preparedness against cyber
attacks:
No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut
down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of
American families, especially our kids.
We are making sure our
government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have
done to combat terrorism.
In closing, the
President discussed two of my legislative priorities for this Congress
renewal of the Voting Rights Act and the need for criminal justice
reform:
We may go at it in campaign season, but
surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred; that its being
denied to too many; and that, on this 50th anniversary of the great march
from Selma to Montgomery and the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we
can come together, Democrats and Republicans, to make voting easier
for every single American.
Surely we can agree its
a good thing that for the first time in 40 years, the crime rate and
the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a
starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law
enforcement, to reform Americas criminal justice system so that it
protects and serves us all.
