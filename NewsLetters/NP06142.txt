&ldquo;New Senate Forecast Predicts a Nail-Biter&rdquo; --
Huffington Post , 9/2/2014
Dear Friend,
Control of the Senate hangs in the balance. And the Koch brothers, Karl Rove, and other special interests are doing their best to put their thumbs on the scale.
Most pundits see Republicans picking up the six seats they need to take control, and with so much outside money pouring into races, it&rsquo;s easy to see why. Over the next few weeks, we need to deploy our best defense against special interest spending -- a strong grassroots network of people like you. Right now, we need to reach our $145,000 fundraising goal before the FEC deadline. Can you give $5 to support our campaign?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
With competitive races from North Carolina to Alaska, I have a feeling we&rsquo;re all going to be up late on November 4th, watching the results and waiting. The work we do now determines what that night will look like.
If we execute our game plan, we&rsquo;ll come out on top. But if we get sloppy, or lazy, or complacent, we run the risk of handing the Senate to the Tea Party. Let&rsquo;s stay sharp. Give $5 and help us reach our $145,000 goal before the FEC deadline.
Thanks,
Ed
