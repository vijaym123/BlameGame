We will fail to hit our goal tonight.
David, we&rsquo;ve tried everything.
-- President Obama has emailed you.
-- Hillary Clinton has emailed you.
-- I&rsquo;ve emailed you more than I can count.
But with this new Republican outside spending, we&rsquo;ll still need 28,OOO more online donations to be able to compete.
It&rsquo;s hard to see that happening with just 4 hours until the deadline.
We have a meeting set to figure out how we&rsquo;ll slash our campaign plan. But for right now, we have to ask one more time:
Can you please donate to President Obama&rsquo;s call-to-action, and help us limit the damage?
