Congressman Lamborn Creates Independent Oversight of the Quadrennial
Veterans Review
2/12/15
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn
offered an amendment to H.R. 216, the Department of Veterans Affairs
Budget Planning Reform Act of 2015.
This legislation proposes
that the VA submit a five year budget and conduct quadrennial reviews of
their strategy for meeting every programs commitments to our
veterans.
Congressman Lamborns amendment provides a critical level of
additional oversight by calling for an Independent Veterans Review
Panel to review the VA produced quadrennial review.
Modeled after
the National Defense Panel, this panel will insure VA leadership is
held accountable and is properly stressing the importance of long-term
thinking to address the challenges facing the
VA.
"My amendment will
allow for greater independent oversight and outside perspectives in the
proposed quadrennial review process. It is extremely important that
these proposals are reviewed by an expert, outside group that does not
become caught up in bureaucratic micromanagement and groupthink. The
quadrennial veterans review must not be merely a carbon copy of the VAs
budget request. Our veterans deserve to have plans from the VA vetted
by an impartial third party and my amendment creates exactly
that."
