Dear Friend,
What do the Kochs want? That&rsquo;s simple --
they want a Senate that will do their bidding.
Which means they want to see devoted Democrats that fight against Koch-backed interests -- Democrats like ME -- defeated in November.
But that won&rsquo;t happen as long as
grassroots supporters like you fight beside me.
We only have a little more than one week left to reach $20,000. Can you give $5 or more to help?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
The Koch brothers&rsquo; special interest group Americans for Prosperity plans on spending
$125 million to buy the 2014 elections.
And Friend, some of that spending will likely make its way to Massachusetts.
I&rsquo;m working to pass a plan to counteract the damaging effects of climate change on our Earth. I&rsquo;m fighting for stricter gun safety laws and against big powerful interests like the NRA. I&rsquo;m standing up to protect Medicare, not turn it into a voucher system. I am against everything the Koch brothers stand for -- and that puts me right at the top of their enemies list.
I don&rsquo;t care if the Kochs like me or not.
Because I know I have you fighting with me. Help us hit our May goal of $20,000 before the month ends. Give $5 or more right now to fight against the Kochs .
Thank you for your support.
