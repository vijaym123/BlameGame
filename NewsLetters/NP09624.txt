Dear Neighbor,
First, two pieces of good news for businesses on either end of the district. In Chautauqua County, we were able to
secure a minimum $1.5 million dollar purchase order for RHI Monofrax in Falconer
by partnering with employees, plant leadership and union representatives. On the other side of the district in Tioga County,
Lockheed Martin will maintain 200-plus jobs
as a result of the $1.2 billion Presidential Helicopter contract it was awarded. Both updates are further confirmation our local workforce is second to none.
TOM REED PUSHES FOR ASSISTANCE IN YATES COUNTY FLOODING
In Penn Yan, we visited some of the spots hit hardest by flooding Tuesday and Wednesday.
Seeing the damage firsthand and hearing from affected individuals and business owners, we encouraged the Governor's office to seek assistance for the county so that it gets the resources it needs to get back up and running safely.
We will be following through to make sure if the local need exceeds the state and county's ability, the Governor seeks federal assistance.

Following severe flooding this week in parts of Yates County, we were in Penn Yan with Penn Yan Academy and Keuka College students who spent the day helping with clean up efforts. The community is lucky to have these students rolling up their sleeves and getting to work helping their neighbors.
