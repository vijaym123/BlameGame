Southwest Missourians never wanted Obamacare.
The Seventh District
first let their voices be heard loud and clear in August 2010 when more
than 80 percent in the district voted against Obamacare and supported
passage of Proposition C.
In the time since, I have heard
countless stories from constituents sharing far more negative than positive
impacts the law has had on their lives
from skyrocketing premiums
and deductibles to business owners holding back on expansion to prevent
added costs of mandated insurance coverage.
These stories
are exactly why I again voted with the House this week to repeal
Obamacare, which passed by a 239
186 vote.
The bill awaits action in
the Senate, where movement is more likely now than any time since
Obamacare was signed into law.
In this repeal bill, Congress
is required to replace Obamacare with affordable health care
measures.
Congress will work on solutions to end Obamacares job-killing
policies and regulations to promote economic growth, increase insurance
market competition to improve quality service and diminish costs,
allow Americans to keep their health plans if desired, and ensure those
with pre-existing conditions access to coverage.
This
bill shows the American people that Congress is not solely focused on
pure dismantlement of the unpopular law, but also assures a
conservative, constructive framework for replacement is in place.
As a
member of the House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee, I will be
directly working to promote patient-centered policies to actually
improve the American health care system. I will continue efforts to make
health care truly more affordable and accessible for all, while making
sure Southwest Missouri values are heard throughout the
process.
