FEATURED STORY
Farm Bill Delivers $40 Million for Critical Great Lakes Restoration
Senator Stabenow announced a historic $40 million investment in
critical conservation projects across Michigan and the Great Lakes
Region supported by over 130 local partners. This major investment is a
direct result of the Regional Conservation Partnership Program, created
in Senator Stabenow's 2014 Farm Bill, to protect our Great Lakes and
invest in water, land, and wildlife conservation across the country.
Three Michigan projects were awarded that will address water quality
concerns in Western Lake Erie, Saginaw Bay, and the St. Joseph River.
One project will address wildlife habitat in Michigan's Upper Peninsula
forests and another will improve forest health throughout the state.
"Today's announcement is historic and marks one of the largest single
federal investments ever in water quality conservation in Michigan and
the Great Lakes," said Stabenow. "Our Michigan projects bring together
hundreds of partners already working hard to protect our water, land,
and wildlife habitat for future generations. This first-of-its-kind
commitment to conserving our natural resources is truly unprecedented
and will have a lasting impact on the health of our Great Lakes," she
added.

WHAT YOU MAY HAVE MISSED
Open Country Award Recognizes Stabenow's Commitment to Outdoor
Recreation and Conservation
Senator Stabenow, a member of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, was
honored with the Open Country Award in the January 15th edition of
Outdoor Life Magazine for being an ally of hunters and anglers in the
passage of the 2014 Farm Bill. Outdoor Life is a national sportsmen's
magazine that supports hunting and fishing in the U.S. She received the
award today. "Men and women who hunt and fish spend their time in the
outdoors and know first-hand the critical importance of land and water
conversation," said Stabenow. "As someone who grew up in Northern
Michigan where hunting and fishing is part of our way of life, I am
very appreciative of this recognition." Outdoor Life's Open Country
program honors those who are making a real difference in creating
access to public lands for those who hunt, fish and trap. The Magazine
noted that the Farm Bill authored by Stabenow "condensed 23 previous
conservation programs into 13, saving taxpayers $6 billion while
maintaining the majority of the key conservation programs we value."
