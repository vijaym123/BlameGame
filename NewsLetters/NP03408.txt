Starting the New Congress by Helping our Veterans
After being sworn in on the opening day of the 114th Congress,
the House of
Representatives immediately started its work and passed the Hire More
Heroes Act (H.R. 22) with Congressman Tim Murphy's support. This bill
will encourage small businesses to hire veterans without being punished
by Obamacare mandates.
Murphy joined with 401 of his colleagues in supporting the measure,
which passed the House in March 2014, but died in the Senate.
Nearly nine million veterans are eligible to receive healthcare through
the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Even though these individuals have
qualified health insurance, they count toward the Obamacare "employer
mandate," creating a perverse disincentive for businesses to hire
veterans, even in an economy where according to some veteran service
organizations as many as 25-30% of veterans returning from the Middle
East are unable to find work.
"Veterans should not be penalized because they receive a benefit they
earned while honorably serving their country. Small businesses
nationwide will benefit from hiring team-oriented, highly-skilled and
dedicated veterans under this law."
The Hire More Heroes Act has now been referred to the Senate where the
new majority leadership will likely fast-track the bill for
consideration.

Sensational Headlines And 'the Rest of the Story' on Mental Illness
Click here
to hear 'the rest of the story.'
Representative Murphy kicked off the 114th Congress this week
announcing plans to reintroduce his comprehensive mental health reform
bill, the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act
, in a speech to his
new colleagues on the House floor [click here
to watch].
In his address, Murphy described how sensational news headlines about
family killings often leave unreported the details about the
perpetrator's mental illness. While those with mental illness are no
more violent than anyone else, there is an increased risk of violent
behavior for someone diagnosed with severe schizophrenia or bipolar
disorder if they are not in treatment. Most of the violence is
self-directed in the form of suicide.
But in Florida last month, a 23-year old man committed a gruesome
murder of his mother after she allegedly nagged him to finish his
household chores. But "the rest of the story" was the man's history of
mental illness, his past commitments to psychiatric hospitals, and his
decision to go without treatment for schizophrenia. Murphy also pointed
to New York City where a 30-year-old man has been charged with killing
his hedge-fund father over a cut in his allowance. "The rest of the
story" was the man's declining mental health.
"Sadly, in all the cases I've mentioned today, the families knew there
was something wrong with their mentally ill loved one. But they were
ignored, frustrated or turned away by a broken system and state and
federal laws that create walls and barriers instead of access to care,"
said Murphy.
In related news, the Huffington Post published a call to action
in support of the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act by a
mental healthcare "consumer" who has been diagnosed with an illness and
is currently in treatment.
"Importantly, this bill tackles the inconvenient nature of serious
mental illness: denial and 'treatment-resistant behavior,' " wrote
Dustin DeMoss.
"The legislation reforms privacy laws to allow caretakers access to
critical HIPAA information in a crisis situation. This is a necessary
and innovative measure because "treatment-resistant behavior" is a
problem with serious mental health issues. I know, because I was once
'treatment-resistant.'"
He continued, "I didn't want to recognize that I was ill. If my mother
had been able to exercise more control over my treatment, I wouldn't
have been able to get as ill as I allowed myself to get." Click here to

The New Orleans Times-Picayune also published a column
by a local mental health advocate praising Dr. Murphy's legislation for
increasing the number of long-term psychiatric beds available to those
in crisis. Since Hurricane Katrina, Louisiana has reached a point where
inpatient treatment facilities for mental illness are in dangerously
low supply.
The Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act ends a severe shortage
of psychiatric hospital beds. It also promotes inexpensive and
innovative models of outpatient care, such as Assisted Outpatient
Treatment, for those who are capable of receiving medical care while
living in the community. AOT is designed to help severely mentally ill
individuals for whom the alternative has been a revolving door of jail,
homelessness, victimization, and violence when not in treatment.

House Moves Swiftly to Approve Keystone Pipeline
At the very start of a new session of Congress and with a new majority
in the Senate, the House of Representatives passed for the tenth time
to advance the Keystone Pipeline after six years of White House delays.
The bipartisan Keystone XL Pipeline Act passed on a bipartisan vote of
266-153 with Congressman Murphy's support.
The construction of the pipeline would move America towards greater
energy independence. According to the Department of Energy, the
Pipeline's completion would allow the U.S. to process 830,000 barrels
of oil per day, which represents about half of all oil imported from
the Middle East. In addition, the State Department has estimated the
project would support over 42,000 American jobs and contribute at least
$2 billion to the U.S. economy.
The pipeline would also dramatically improve rail safety. Six years
ago, 10,000 carloads of crude oil traveled by rail. Just four years
later, rail traffic had grown to 400,000 carloads - a 40-fold increase.
The dramatic growth in transporting Canadian oil to US refineries has
led to rail congestion, delays, and higher costs for other
manufacturing sectors that rely on the railroads. It has also resulted
in increased rail accidents. Last February, 21 cars derailed in
Vandergrift, Westmoreland County, causing more than 3,500 gallons of
crude oil to leak
near the Kiski River.
Even as the new Congress advanced the Keystone Pipeline project with
broad bipartisan support, the President announced his intention to veto
the Keystone bill. Repeated studies have proven the pipeline to be
completely environmentally-safe and that it would not result in an
increase of global greenhouse gas emissions. While the President was
calling for litigation to resolve the pipeline's future, the Nebraska
Supreme Court issued a ruling on Friday that cleared the way for the
project to move forward.
In spite of the veto threat, the Senate is expected to take up the
House-passed Keystone bill next week, where it will also likely enjoy
wide-bipartisan support.

House
Moves
Swiftly
to
Approve
Keystone
Pipeline
At
the
very
start
of
a
new
session
of
Congress
and
with
a
new
majority
in
the
Senate,
the
House
of
Representatives
passed
for
the
tenth
time
to
advance
the
Keystone
Pipeline
after
six
years
of
White
House
delays.
The
bipartisan
Keystone
XL
Pipeline
Act
passed
on
a
bipartisan
vote
of
266-153
with
Congressman
Murphy's
support.
The
construction
of
the
pipeline
would
move
America
towards
greater
energy
independence.
According
to
the
Department
of
Energy,
the
Pipeline's
completion
would
allow
the
U.S.
to
process
830,000
barrels
of
oil
per
day,
which
represents
about
half
of
all
oil
imported
from
the
Middle
East.
In
addition,
the
State
Department
has
estimated
the
project
would
support
over
42,000
American
jobs
and
contribute
at
least
$2
billion
to
the
U.S.
economy.
The
pipeline
would
also
dramatically
improve
rail
safety.
Six
years
ago,
10,000
carloads
of
crude
oil
traveled
by
rail.
Just
four
years
later,
rail
traffic
had
grown
to
400,000
carloads
&mdash;
a
40-fold
increase.
The
dramatic
growth
in
transporting
Canadian
oil
to
US
refineries
has
led
to
rail
congestion,
delays,
and
higher
costs
for
other
manufacturing
sectors
that
rely
on
the
railroads.
It
has
also
resulted
in
increased
rail
accidents.
Last
February,
21
cars
derailed
in
Vandergrift,
Westmoreland
County,
causing
more
than
3,500
gallons
of
crude
oil
to
leak
near
the
Kiski
River.
Even
as
the
new
Congress
advanced
the
Keystone
Pipeline
project
with
broad
bipartisan
support,
the
President
announced
his
intention
to
veto
the
Keystone
bill.
Repeated
studies
have
proven
the
pipeline
to
be
completely
environmentally-safe
and
that
it
would
not
result
in
an
increase
of
global
greenhouse
gas
emissions.
While
the
President
was
calling
for
litigation
to
resolve
the
pipeline's
future,
the
Nebraska
Supreme
Court
issued
a
ruling
on
Friday
that
cleared
the
way
for
the
project
to
move
forward.
In
spite
of
the
veto
threat,
the
Senate
is
expected
to
take
up
the
House-passed
Keystone
bill
next
week,
where
it
will
also
likely
enjoy
wide-bipartisan
support.
