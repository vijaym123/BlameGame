Rubio Opposes House-Senate Budget
Deal
Marco issued the following statement
announcing his opposition to the
House-Senate budget deal:
We need a government with less
debt and an economy with more good paying
jobs, and this budget fails to accomplish
both goals, making it harder for more
Americans to achieve the American
Dream.Instead, this budget
continues Washingtons
irresponsible budgeting decisions by
spending more money than the government
takes in and placing additional financial
burdens on everyday Americans.
In the short run, this budget
also cancels earlier spending reductions,
instead of making some tough decisions
about how to tackle our long-term fiscal
challenges caused by runaway Washington
spending. Ivoted against
sequestration because of its effect on
key programs, including the defense
budget, but higher spending and more
revenue are not the appropriate ways to
address that problem.
The American people should not
be asked to choose between a strong
military and responsible budgets that
encourage job creation and reduce debt.
They deserve better than this.

Rubio, Hagan Introduce Legislation To
Combat Human Trafficking In Child Welfare
Systems
Along with Senator Kay Hagan (D-NC),
Marco introduced
The Strengthening the Child Welfare
Response to Human Trafficking Act,
a
bill to combat sex and labor trafficking in
child welfare systems across the country by
providing their employees with tools to
identify, document, educate and counsel
child victims. In a statement Rubio
said:
Earlier this year, Congress
took an important step to combat human
trafficking by reauthorizing landmark
legislation, but significant gaps remain
regarding human trafficking that targets
innocents in our child welfare
systems,
said Rubio . While the vast
majority of prospective foster and
adoptive parents are well intentioned and
eager to love these children, sadly,
there are those who seek to exploit our
children. For children, adoptions
and foster care should be a lifeline to a
better future, not a path to hell as
trafficking victims.
Rubio Comments On Reauthorization Of
The Undetectable Firearms Act
Marco issued the following statement
regarding
The Undetectable Firearms Act , which
cleared the U.S. Senate and was passed by
the U.S. House of Representatives:
Rubio: I supported reauthorizing
the existing common sense law banning
undetectable firearms, which are intended
to avoid metal detectors and jeopardize
public safety. I am glad gun control groups
failed in their attempts to use this vote
as an opportunity to further regulate the
lawful ownership of firearms, a right
protected by the 2nd Amendment to the
Constitution.
I continue to believe that the
answer to gun-related violence is vigorous
enforcement of existing criminal laws and
enhanced efforts to address mental health
problems.This is not the first time
weve seen gun control advocates
seize any opportunity to advance federal
regulations, but I will continue to fight
for the rights of law-abiding Americans to
bear arms.
Constituent Casework Corner
David, a disabled veteran residing in
South Florida, contacted the Senator
Rubios office a few months ago
regarding his pending claim with the
Veterans Administration for increased
disability. He recently lost his job due to
kidney failure and his claim has been
pending for over 15 months. A member of the
staff contacted the agency and requested an
expedited review of his application due to
his dire health condition. Within weeks, VA
officials approved his claim and sent him a
retroactive check in the amount of
$24,103.00. In addition, he will be
receiving a monthly compensation check in
the amount of $3,561.00.
