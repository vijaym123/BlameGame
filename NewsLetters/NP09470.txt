ICYMI:
Rockefeller States Opposition to Obamacare is Racist; Johnson
Responds
Watch Senator Johnson
respond to Senator Rockefeller
here.
Senator Johnson took
exception Wednesday to a Democrat senators characterization of opposition to
the Affordable Care Act as being motivated by
racism.
Senator Jay Rockefeller, chairman of the
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, opined that Republicans who
oppose Obamacare do so for suspect reasons. He complained about people
who email their senators to tell how Obamacare has made their health
care situations worse, characterizing opposition as from people whove
made up their mind that they dont want it to work, because they
dont like the president. Maybe hes of the wrong color, something of that
sort. Read more

why it makes a difference that the administration lied to America about
the al-Qaida-linked attack on our diplomats in
Benghazi.
PolitiFact summed it up this way: We rate Johnsons statement

If you like your employer-sponsored coverage,
well...
Suppose youre not worried about the
problems with the Obamacare exchanges, the government-controlled
websites at which you buy government-mandated health insurance. Four
states exchanges have failed already, and the federal exchange that serves
Wisconsin is only partially functional, but youre confident because
