Removing
Burdensome Obamacares Taxes
Obamacare was
funded on the backs of seniors by cutting their care and hiking taxes on
the life-saving devices they rely on. This week, the House voted to
repeal a destructive Obamacare tax on medical devices.
The
medical device tax will cripple a growing manufacturing industry that
invents the life-saving prosthetics, pacemakers, and hi-tech devices to
treat the sick. When businesses face tougher times, research
investments and employees are the first areas cut. The device tax is already
responsible for an estimated 33,000 jobs lost, and the more than 400,000
workers in the industry could be threatened. The tax will also stifle
innovation in one of Americas most successful
industries.
Repealing this tax is just a small step toward our larger goal
the
full repeal of Obamacare and replacing it with patient-centered health
reforms that give you choice and better
care.
The State of West Virginias Economy
Last week,
the Department of Commerce announced West Virginia was the
third-fastest growing state in the country at 5.1% GDP growth. One thing all the
top states share? A booming oil and natural gas industry. Read the
story
here .
We need to nurture this
growth, but I am concerned many are not seeing it yet. We still have
empty storefronts, struggling families, and a high state unemployment
rate. Have you felt this growth? Please take the survey in this email and
let me know what you think.
The EPAs Latest
Destructive Regulation
The EPA is back at it
they are proposing to significantly lower the level of ozone in the air
across the United States. Their one-size-fits-all regulation would set
the same ozone levels for New York City as Doddridge
County.
What does this mean for you? Areas which are considered in
compliance today will face crippling economic costs to change how businesses
and farms operate, people travel and drive, and families run their
homes. Initial estimates are that 15 of 20 counties in the First District
will be deemed out of compliance, meaning economic development will be
limited. This rule will have real consequences for our area. That is
why I intend to fight it at every turn.

WVU Students Win NASA
Award
A team of WVU engineering students won a NASA award for
$100,000 by building the best robot to play fetch with. The robot, named
Cataglyphis after a desert ant, is similar to the Mars Rover and is a
big step forward in robotics. Read more about it
here .
The WVU Alumni held a luncheon this week and
President Gee delivered an upbeat and optimistic message about our state
universitys future. Awards like this are a good sign of things to
come.
West Virginias

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter The Department of Commerce recently announced that West
Virginia's economy grew by 5.1% last year - the third-fastest growing country
in the state. Meanwhile, our unemployment rate has increased to 7.2%
over the past 5 months. What do you think of these two facts - WV is growing,
but employment is down? *By
