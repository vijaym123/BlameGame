The Webster Wire
Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
As we finished the legislative year in Washington last week, I welcomed a constituent from Mount Dora that came for a meeting with the Florida Bankers Association. We discussed the current financial situation facing both consumers and lenders, as well as concerns and insights that the group had relating to the banking industry. Last week, I also met with the Broward County Mayor Barbara Sharief and a couple of other groups concerning the conference committee I am serving on for the water infrastructure bill.

On Saturday, several of our grandkids joined Sandy and me for the Umatilla Cracker Christmas Parade. It was a pleasure to ride down Highway 19 in my pick-up truck and wish the City of Umatilla a very blessed Christmas season. I am honored to represent Congressional District 10, and it has been a privilege to participate in so many community Christmas events this year.

Later on Saturday, I was privileged to deliver the commencement address for graduates of the ITT Technical Institute in Orlando. Focused on technology-oriented fields and specialty programs, ITT Tech is a system of private colleges with a mission to provide career-focused degrees that facilitate student success regardless of their current position in life. It was a pleasure to congratulate these students on their academic accomplishments and wish them great success in the future.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Several years ago, a constituent began receiving Social Security benefits, but recently was informed that she had been overpaid thousands of dollars. The constituent submitted a waiver request, and called my office to follow up with the Social Security Administration (SSA) regarding her waiver request. My office reached out to SSA, and after they reviewed her case, notified the constituent that the overpayment amount had been waived.

Legislative Update:
Last week, I opposed the trillion dollar budget deal that was brought before the House of Representatives. The bipartisan effort put into this budget was admirable, but all of the savings will come way down the line
in some cases more than 10 years from now
when they are less likely to be fully realized.
During the last round of negotiations, the Congress and President agreed on $2.4 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years. Now, a little over a year into the implementation of that plan, this budget proposal circumvents that agreement by raising spending levels back to over a trillion dollars every year.
The simple fact is that our government spends too much. Our country remains in a crisis of excessive spending, and we cannot return to this path of trillion dollar budgets .
