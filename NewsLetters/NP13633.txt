December 16, 2013
Friends,
Last week was the final legislative week of 2013.
It is hard
to believe that an entire year has passed.
While the
partisanship in Washington has been troublesome at best, we did take a small step
forward by passing a budget plan last week that makes small
reductions in our deficit without raising taxes and replaces some of the
sequestration cuts for two years.
While this plan was not a perfect
plan, it is a step in the right direction.
Our economy is poised to accelerate.
The main thing
holding it back is Washington. This budget plan will help restore some
economic certainty, because lurching from crisis to crisis every three
months is not a sustainable path.
Since this is the first budget in
years, I am hopeful it will encourage our countrys businesses to
grow and expand, ultimately creating more American jobs.
STOP Resolution
Many
of you have contacted my office to express your concern about this
Presidencys actions and limitations clearly outlined in Article II,
Section 3 of our Constitution. I have listened, and after carefully
researching the issue, I introduced a resolution last week that would allow
the U.S. House of Representatives to sue the President. This is not a
Tea Party action. This is not Republican vs Democrat. This is not about
personal animosity. I simply believe that the President, like
everyone else, should abide by the law. Play

Last Wednesday, the
House passed the
Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act , which
prioritizes some of the funding set aside for political campaigns for
medical research for kids.
Specifically this money would fund
scientific research of pediatric diseases and disorders such as cancer,
autism, and Fragile X.
