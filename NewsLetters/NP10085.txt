Dear Friends:
Last week, I had the
privilege of meeting with visitors from Camp Sunshine, a Georgia-based
organization dedicated to children and teens fighting cancer. Camp Sunshine
aims to provide opportunities, promote individual growth, and bring
people together who share similar experiences. Camp Sunshine was founded
in 1982, and since then has flourished into a community with over 375
campers and 200 volunteers.
Camp Sunshine offers a variety
of outings and programs throughout the year, including an annual
excursion to Washington, D.C. which I help to arrange. This year, the
participants visited the F.B.I. Academy, Arlington National Cemetery, and
several museums. I provided a U.S. Capitol tour and other educational
experiences for them to enjoy. I also had the honor of hosting a
special luncheon for Camp Sunshine on Capitol Hill and arranged for
lawmakers to speak to the group during the lunch. Special guests included
Sens. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., Tom Coburn, M.D., R-Okla., Joe Manchin,
D-W.Va., and John McCain, R-Ariz.
As a survivor of cancer myself,
I have cherished working with this wonderful organization for the past
ten years. Some parts of my job I am not going to miss, but there are
some parts that I will miss. Camp Sunshine and meeting with these
kids is one of those things. John, a Camp Sunshine participant, flew on
his first airplane since he was one year old to get here. Caitlin, who
is visiting D.C. for the first time, said she was most excited to see
the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National
Cemetery.
Ten years ago this month, I was diagnosed. When the doctor called
me, I told him he had the wrong number. I am stronger than ever
today, and I know the same will come for these kids.
If you
would like to get involved with this organization, visit their website at

Very Truly Yours,
If you are planning a visit
to D.C., I hope you will stop by my office and say hello, or pick up
a pack of Georgia peanuts. You can also
