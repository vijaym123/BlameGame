Dear Friend,
This week, the House passed my amendment to help prevent children from
going hungry, President Obama moved to help more than 100,000
Tennesseans burdened with student loan debt, and a new report showed
that 60,000 Ninth District citizens will receive a raise if Congress
increases the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour. Keep reading to learn
more about what happened this week.

Working to Prevent Childhood Hunger in Memphis and Around the Country
For many young people in Memphis and around the nation, one of their
most exciting days is the last day of school before it lets out for the
summer. But for others-like the less fortunate children in our country-
school letting out has a more negative consequence: hunger. More than
16 million children in America, or one in 5 of all children in the
wealthiest nation in the world, are at risk of going hungry. That isn't
right.
One of the wealthiest nations in the world should not send its children
to bed hungry. Last week, I joined the Summer Food Kickoff at Emerald
Square in support of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Summer
Food Service Program. The program provides free, nutritious meals and
snacks to help children get the nutrients they need to learn, play, and
grow throughout the summer months when free school lunches are not
provided to them.
And I am pleased to tell you that on Wednesday the House passed my
amendment to the Agriculture appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2015
to add $3 million in funding to the Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer
for Children program, which allows the USDA to study alternative
approaches to provide food assistance to low-income children in urban
and rural districts during the summer months. My amendment will help
prevent hunger and make sure that children in Memphis and throughout
the United States are able to lead happy and healthy lives. You can
watch a video of me offering the amendment on the House Floor here
.
Ensuring Veterans Receive the Timely, High-Quality Treatment They
Deserve
On Monday, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs released a new
access audit showing that a significant number of veterans have been
forced to wait too long to receive the treatment they deserve at VA
Medical Centers around the nation, including at the Memphis VA. Any
delay in providing care to the brave men and women who risked their
lives for our safety is unacceptable, and I have consistently pushed to
give the VA the resources and personnel needed to provide timely care.
While the Memphis VA, under the leadership of Director C. Diane Knight,
has implemented the recommendations of the VA Inspector General, this
report is disappointing and underscores that more still needs to be
done-not only in Memphis but around the country-to fulfill our
commitment to our veterans. I will continue working with President
Obama and members of both parties in Congress to fix these problems and
make sure that everyone who has served this country in uniform receives
timely, high-quality care at the Memphis VA or any other VA Medical
Center.
Banking on Students
This week, President Obama acted to give borrowers of student loans the
ability to cap their student loan payments at 10% of their monthly
income. As the father of the Tennessee Education Lottery Scholarship,
I've always worked hard to ensure that higher education remains
affordable for students and families.
I agree with President Obama that we need to do more to bank on our
students, and I support his move to help reduce costs for more than
100,000 Tennesseans with student loan debt. This week, I also met with
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to discuss our efforts to
make college more affordable through the "Bank on Students Emergency
Loan Refinancing Act" that I have cosponsored. Senator Warren's
legislation would allow borrowers to refinance their student loans at
lower rates, a change that the U.S. Department of Education estimates
that 25 million Americans could take advantage of to save roughly
$2,000 over the lifetime of their loans.
I am disappointed that Republicans in the Senate blocked the chamber
from even considering Senator Warren's bill, but I will continue
working with my colleagues in the House to pass this legislation and
provide more relief to nearly half a million hard-working, responsible
Tennesseans.
Preventing Diabetes in Memphis
This morning, I joined an open house for Methodist South Hospital's
Diabetes Wellness and Prevention Center to discuss the rising tide of
diabetes diagnoses in Memphis. As a member of the Congressional
Diabetes Caucus, earlier this year I hosted a forum-part of my "Building
a Healthier Memphis" series on wellness in the Ninth District-to
discuss this disease, which impacts our minority community more than
any other population, and to highlight ways to help reduce this
disparity. Thanks to President Obama's Affordable Care Act, insurers
are now required to cover preventive care services without charging
co-pays or deductibles and insurance plans cannot discriminate against
people with pre-existing conditions like diabetes.
Giving Tennessee Students Better Opportunities
This week, a Tennessee Lottery player in Knoxville won an almost $260
million Powerball jackpot. This is obviously great news for the winner,
who has not yet come forward, but also good news for students
throughout our state. I am proud of my decades of work as a State
Senator to create the Tennessee Education Lottery Scholarship program,
which since its inception has provided more than $3 billion to help our
state's young people attend college. As college costs skyrocket and
college degrees become more important, it is critical that we do
everything we can to keep college affordable for hard-working students
and families. Every dollar spent on lottery tickets in Tennessee
directly helps students and their families attend high-quality
colleges, and that is good for our state and our economy.
Helping Small Businesses and Minority-Owned Businesses Succeed
Memphis is home to many well-qualified small-business owners who do
great work. They are the heart of the Memphis economy and play a
critical role in our nation's economic recovery. After years of hard
work, my persistence paid off when the U.S. Department of Commerce
awarded a $1 million grant to start the Minority Business Development
Agency (MBDA) Business Center in Memphis. The MBDA is the only federal
agency created specifically to foster the establishment and growth of
minority-owned businesses, and the Memphis Business Center has helped
our minority businesses secure loans and expand. Earlier this year, I
was happy to announce that the MBDA Business Center in Memphis had won
an additional $250,000 of federal funding.
Today, I am pleased to invite small business owners and entrepreneurs
from the Ninth District to this year's Federal Procurement Fair, which
I've hosted annually since 2010 to help give our city's minority-owned
businesses and small businesses the expertise they need to navigate the
federal contracting process and an opportunity to gain a competitive
edge as they work to grow their businesses and create good-paying jobs
right here in Memphis. My Federal Procurement Fair will be held at the
FedEx Institute of Technology at the University of Memphis on Monday,
June 30th, beginning at 9am. If you plan to attend, please RSVP by
emailing cohen.procurement@mail.house.gov.
Raising the Minimum Wage for Hardworking Memphians
This morning, I highlighted a new report from Oxfam America showing
that an estimated 60,000 Ninth District citizens will receive a raise
if Congress increases the national minimum wage to $10.10 per hour. The
organization's new report also showed that roughly 548,000 Tennesseans,
or about 22% of our state's workforce, stand to benefit from an
increased national minimum wage.
Throughout my career, I have always fought to ensure that hard-working
Memphians can earn a living wage and won't have to struggle to provide
for themselves and their families. No one who works hard and plays by
the rules should have to raise their family in poverty. When I came to
Congress in 2007, I was proud to vote for an increase in the federal
minimum wage, but since then the cost of basic necessities has risen
and the minimum wage has become less valuable. I am disappointed that
Republicans continue to block a vote to increase the minimum wage and
give 60,000 Ninth District residents a much-deserved and long-overdue
raise. I will continue working to force Speaker John Boehner to let us
vote on this important legislation.
Righting the Injustices of Outdated, Racially-Biased Laws
On Tuesday, I joined Attorney General Eric Holder in urging the U.S.
Sentencing Commission to make certain non-violent drug offenders
eligible for reduced sentences if they are incarcerated in federal
prisons serving sentences that no longer apply under current law.
Earlier this year, the Commission approved sentencing guideline changes
that are estimated to reduce prison sentences for new non-violent drug
offenses by an average 23 months, but it must still vote to make
currently-incarcerated individuals eligible to have their sentences
retroactively reduced.
Throughout my career, I've fought for fairer sentencing laws and worked
to eliminate racially-biased sentencing disparities. After years of
advocating on behalf of Americans who are unfairly incarcerated, I am
pleased that our nation's policies are beginning to bend further
towards justice-but that justice has not yet reached many of those who
most need it. The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 that I helped pass marked
a step towards addressing a fundamentally unfair policy moving forward,
but it did not address the injustice of-or the wasteful spending
necessitated by-keeping Americans in prison longer than current law
mandates. I stand with President Obama's Administration in urging the
U.S. Sentencing Commission to move swiftly and make these new
sentencing guidelines retroactive for current non-violent offenders.
Grants for Memphis
Yesterday, I announced more than $4.6 million in funding for several
research projects at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital as well as
for the hospital's Comprehensive Cancer Center. The funding will be
used to continue important work at St. Jude, one of the world's finest
health care institutions. You can read more about the research projects
being funded here
.
Medicare Basics Workshop
The Aging Commission of the Mid South will host a Medicare Basics
Workshop at 4pm on July 8th at Whitehaven Library (4120 Millbranch
Road). The workshop is designed to help those who are new to Medicare
clearly understand their benefits and will cover several topics
including enrollment, the different parts of Medicare, the difference
between Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans, and several others. If
you are planning to attend, please be sure to bring your "Medicare and
You" handbook with you.
President Obama Seeking Mentors for Young People
It is important that all children have caring adults who are engaged in
their lives, but too many young people lack this important support.
That's why President Obama is calling on Americans to sign up as
long-term mentors to young people through his new "My Brother's Keeper"
initiative. The President is seeking people from all walks of life who
want to develop sustained and direct mentoring relationships that will
play vital roles in the lives of young people in Memphis and around the
country. If you are interested in signing up to help young adults in
our city stay on track, you can do so here
.
Make Sure to Claim Unclaimed Property
The State of Tennessee maintains a searchable database of unclaimed
property, which can include bank accounts, stocks and dividends, wages,
refunds, insurance payments, gift certificates, credit balances and
overpayments, and a number of other things. There is no cost for
accessing the database, and you may find that you are owed money or
property. If you have not searched the database yet or if you haven't
searched in a while, you can visit https://www.claimittn.gov
and see for yourself whether the state is holding
any property or assets for you. And you may pass this information along
to your friends and family as well!
I hope you have an enjoyable Father's Day on Sunday.
As always, I remain.
Most sincerely,

Working

in

and
Around

Country
For
many
young
people
in
Memphis
and
around
the
nation,
one
of
their
most
exciting
days
is
the
last
day
of
school
before
it
lets
out
for
the
summer.
But
for
others&#8212;like
the
less
fortunate
children
in
our
country&#8212;school
letting
out
has
a
more
negative
consequence:
hunger.
More
than
16
million
children
in
America,
or
one
in
5
of
all
children
in
the
wealthiest
nation
in
the
world,
are
at
risk
of
going
hungry.
That
isn&#8217;t
right.
One
of
the
wealthiest
nations
in
the
world
should
not
send
its
children
to
bed
hungry.
Last
week,
I
joined
the
Summer
Food
Kickoff
at
Emerald
Square
in
support
of
the
U.S.
Department
of
Agriculture&#8217;s
(USDA)
Summer

The

provides

to
help
children
get
the

they
need
to
learn,
play,
and
grow
throughout

months
when

lunches
are
not
provided
to

And
I
am
pleased
to
tell
you
that
on
Wednesday
the
House
passed
my

to
the
Agriculture
appropriations

for
Fiscal

and
throughout
the

able
to
lead happy

Ensuring
Veterans
Receive
the
Timely,
High-Quality
Treatment
They
Deserve
On
Monday,
the
U.S.
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
released
a
new
access
audit
showing
that
a
significant
number
of
veterans
have
been
forced
to
wait
too
long
to
receive
the
treatment
they
deserve
at
VA
Medical
Centers
around
the
nation,
including
at
the
Memphis
VA.
Any
delay
in
providing
care
to
the
brave
men
and
women
who
risked
their
lives
for
our
safety
is
unacceptable,
and
I
have
consistently
pushed
to
give
the
VA
the
resources
and
personnel
needed
to
provide
timely
care.
While
the
Memphis
VA,
under
the
leadership
of
Director
C.
Diane
Knight,
has
implemented
the
recommendations
of
the
VA
Inspector
General,
this
report
is
disappointing
and
underscores
that
more
still
needs
to
be
done&#8212;not
only
in
Memphis
but
around
the
country&#8212;to
fulfill
our
commitment
to
our
veterans.
I
will
continue
working
with
President
Obama
and
members
of
both
parties
in
Congress
to
fix
these
problems
and
make
sure
that
everyone
who
has
served
this
country
in
uniform
receives
timely,
high-quality
care
at
the
Memphis
VA
or
any
other
VA
Medical
Center.
Banking
on
Students
This
week,
President
Obama
acted
to
give
borrowers
of
student
loans
the
ability
to
cap
their
student
loan
payments
at
10%
of
their
monthly
income.
As
the
father
of
the
Tennessee
Education
Lottery
Scholarship,
I&#8217;ve
always
worked
hard
to
ensure
that
higher
education
remains
affordable
for
students
and
families.
I
agree
with
President
Obama
that
we
need
to
do
more
to
bank
on
our
students,
and
I
support
his
move
to
help
reduce
costs
for
more
than
100,000
Tennesseans
with
student
loan
debt.
This
week,
I
also
met
with
Senator
Elizabeth
Warren
of
Massachusetts
to
discuss
our
efforts
to
make
college
more
affordable
through
the
&#8220;Bank
on
Students
Emergency
Loan
Refinancing
Act&#8221;
that
I
have
cosponsored.
Senator
Warren&#8217;s
legislation
would
allow
borrowers
to
refinance
their
student
loans
at
lower
rates,
a
change
that
the
U.S.
Department
of
Education
estimates
that
25
million
Americans
could
take
advantage
of
to
save
roughly
$2,000
over
the
lifetime
of
their
loans.
I
am
disappointed
that
Republicans
in
the
Senate
blocked
the
chamber
from
even
considering
Senator
Warren&#8217;s
bill,
but
I
will
continue
working
with
my
colleagues
in
the
House
to
pass
this
legislation
and
provide
more
relief
to
nearly
half
a
million
hard-working,
responsible
Tennesseans.
Preventing
Diabetes
in
Memphis
This
morning,
I
joined
an
open
house
for
Methodist
South
Hospital&#8217;s
Diabetes
Wellness
and
Prevention
Center
to
discuss
the
rising
tide
of
diabetes
diagnoses
in
Memphis.
As
a
member
of
the
Congressional
Diabetes
Caucus,
earlier
this
year
I
hosted
a
forum&#8212;part
of
my
&#8220;Building
a
Healthier
Memphis&#8221;
series
on
wellness
in
the
Ninth
District&#8212;to
discuss
this
disease,
which
impacts
our
minority
community
more
than
any
other
population,
and
to
highlight
ways
to
help
reduce
this
disparity.
Thanks
to
President
Obama&#8217;s
Affordable
Care
Act,
insurers
are
now
required
to
cover
preventive
care
services
without
charging
co-pays
or
deductibles
and
insurance
plans
cannot
discriminate
against
people
with
pre-existing
conditions
like
diabetes.
Giving
Tennessee
Students
Better
Opportunities
This
week,
a
Tennessee
Lottery
player
in
Knoxville
won
an
almost
$260
million
Powerball
jackpot.
This
is
obviously
great
news
for
the
winner,
who
has
not
yet
come
forward,
but
also
good
news
for
students
throughout
our
state.
I
am
proud
of
my
decades
of
work
as
a
State
Senator
to
create
the
Tennessee
Education
Lottery
Scholarship
program,
which
since
its
inception
has
provided
more
than
$3
billion
to
help
our
state&#8217;s
young
people
attend
college.
As
college
costs
skyrocket
and
college
degrees
become
more
important,
it
is
critical
that
we
do
everything
we
can
to
keep
college
affordable
for
hard-working
students
and
families.
Every
dollar
spent
on
lottery
tickets
in
Tennessee
directly
helps
students
and
their
families
attend
high-quality
colleges,
and
that
is
good
for
our
state
and
our
economy.
Helping
Small
Businesses
and
Minority-Owned
Businesses
Succeed
Memphis
is
home
to
many
well-qualified
small-business
owners
who
do
great
work.
They
are
the
heart
of
the
Memphis
economy
and
play
a
critical
role
in
our
nation&#8217;s
economic
recovery.
After
years
of
hard
work,
my
persistence
paid
off
when
the
U.S.
Department
of
Commerce
awarded
a
$1
million
grant
to
start
the
Minority
Business
Development
Agency
(MBDA)
Business
Center
in
Memphis.
The
MBDA
is
the
only
federal
agency
created
specifically
to
foster
the
establishment
and
growth
of
minority-owned
businesses,
and
the
Memphis
Business
Center
has
helped
our
minority
businesses
secure
loans
and
expand.
Earlier
this
year,
I
was
happy
to
announce
that
the
MBDA
Business
Center
in
Memphis
had
won
an
additional
$250,000
of
federal
funding.
Today,
I
am
pleased
to
invite
small
business
owners
and
entrepreneurs
from
the
Ninth
District
to
this
year&#8217;s
Federal
Procurement
Fair,
which
I&#8217;ve
hosted
annually
since
2010
to
help
give
our
city&#8217;s
minority-owned
businesses
and
small
businesses
the
expertise
they
need
to
navigate
the
federal
contracting
process
and
an
opportunity
to
gain
a
competitive
edge
as
they
work
to
grow
their
businesses
and
create
good-paying
jobs
right
here
in
Memphis.
My
Federal
Procurement
Fair
will
be
held
at
the
FedEx
Institute
of
Technology
at
the
University
of
Memphis
on
Monday,
June
30th,
beginning
at
9am.
If
you

Raising
the
Minimum
Wage
for
Hardworking
Memphians
This
morning,
I
highlighted
a
new
report
from
Oxfam
America
showing
that
an
estimated
60,000
Ninth
District
citizens
will
receive
a
raise
if
Congress
increases
the
national
minimum
wage
to
$10.10
per
hour.
The
organization&#8217;s
new
report
also
showed
that
roughly
548,000
Tennesseans,
or
about
22%
of
our
state&#8217;s
workforce,
stand
to
benefit
from
an
increased
national
minimum
wage.
Throughout
my
career,
I
have
always
fought
to
ensure
that
hard-working
Memphians
can
earn
a
living
wage
and
won&#8217;t
have
to
struggle
to
provide
for
themselves
and
their
families.
No
one
who
works
hard
and
plays
by
the
rules
should
have
to
raise
their
family
in
poverty.
When
I
came
to
Congress
in
2007,
I
was
proud
to
vote
for
an
increase
in
the
federal
minimum
wage,
but
since
then
the
cost
of
basic
necessities
has
risen
and
the
minimum
wage
has
become
less
valuable.
I
am
disappointed
that
Republicans
continue
to
block
a
vote
to
increase
the
minimum
wage
and
give
60,000
Ninth
District
residents
a
much-deserved
and
long-overdue
raise.
I
will
continue
working
to
force
Speaker
John
Boehner
to
let
us
vote
on
this
important
legislation.
Righting
the
Injustices
of
Outdated,
Racially-Biased
Laws
On
Tuesday,
I
joined
Attorney
General
Eric
Holder
in
urging
the
U.S.
Sentencing
Commission
to
make
certain
non-violent
drug
offenders
eligible
for
reduced
sentences
if
they
are
incarcerated
in
federal
prisons
serving
sentences
that
no
longer
apply
under
current
law.
Earlier
this
year,
the
Commission
approved
sentencing
guideline
changes
that
are
estimated
to
reduce
prison
sentences
for
new
non-violent
drug
offenses
by
an
average
23
months,
but
it
must
still
vote
to
make
currently-incarcerated
individuals
eligible
to
have
their
sentences
retroactively
reduced.
Throughout
my
career,
I&#8217;ve
fought
for
fairer
sentencing
laws
and
worked
to
eliminate
racially-biased
sentencing
disparities.
After
years
of
advocating
on
behalf
of
Americans
who
are
unfairly
incarcerated,
I
am
pleased
that
our
nation&#8217;s
policies
are
beginning
to
bend
further
towards
justice&#8212;but
that
justice
has
not
yet
reached
many
of
those
who
most
need
it.
The
Fair
Sentencing
Act
of
2010
that
I
helped
pass
marked
a
step
towards
addressing
a
fundamentally
unfair
policy
moving
forward,
but
it
did
not
address
the
injustice
of&#8212;or
the
wasteful
spending
necessitated
by&#8212;keeping
Americans
in
prison
longer
than
current
law
mandates.
I
stand
with
President
Obama&#8217;s
Administration
in
urging
the
U.S.
Sentencing
Commission
to
move
swiftly
and
make
these
new
sentencing
guidelines
retroactive
for
current
non-violent
offenders.

President
Obama
Seeking
Mentors
for
Young
People
It
is
important
that
all
children
have
caring
adults
who
are
engaged
in
their
lives,
but
too
many
young
people
lack
this
important
support.
That&#8217;s
why
President
Obama
is
calling
on
Americans
to
sign
up
as
long-term
mentors
to
young
people
through
his
new
&#8220;My
Brother&#8217;s
Keeper&#8221;
initiative.
The
President
is
seeking
people
from
all
walks
of
life
who
want
to
develop
sustained
and
direct
mentoring
relationships
that
will
play
vital
roles
in
the
lives
of
young
people
in
Memphis
and
around
the
country.
If
you
are
interested
in
signing
up
to
help
young
adults
in
our
city
stay
on
track,
you
can
do
so
here .
Make
Sure
to
Claim
Unclaimed
Property
The
State
of
Tennessee
maintains
a
searchable
database
of
unclaimed
property,
which
can
include
bank
accounts,
stocks
and
dividends,
wages,
refunds,
insurance
payments,
gift
certificates,
credit
balances
and
overpayments,
and
a
number
of
other
things.
There
is
no
cost
for
accessing
the
database,
and
you
may
find
that
you
are
owed
money
or
property.
If
you
have
not
searched
the
database
yet
or
if
you
haven&#8217;t
searched
in
a
while,
you
can
visit
https://www.claimittn.gov
and
see
for
yourself
whether
the
state
is
holding
any
property
or
assets
for
you.
And
you
may
pass
this
information
along
to
your
friends
and
family
as
well!
I
hope
you
have
an
enjoyable
Father&#8217;s
Day
on
Sunday.
As
always,
I
remain.
