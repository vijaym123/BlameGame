Dear David,
It is privilege to
represent you in Congress.
As your Representative, I value your
thoughts and opinions on the key issues affecting our country and our local
Inland Empire community.
I created an
Annual Report to the Community
highlighting all the work we
accomplished together in 2013. I hope you take the time to download it,
read it, and share it with friends and neighbors.
As 2014
begins, this Congress has one more year to get to work on a wide range
of important matters. I hope you take a moment to let me know what
issues you think we as a nation should focus on in the upcoming
year.
You can always share your thoughts through
Facebook
or
Twitter .
I welcome
hearing from you on these and any other issues, and hope that you will
stay in touch.
Respectfully,
Gloria Negrete
McLeod
