WATCH:
Rep. Garrett introduces amendment to
increase funding to rail safety and operations
Dear Friend,
The number of train accidents is a growing concern among all Americans.
To help increase the safety of passenger and freight railroads operating in New Jersey's communities, I recently introduced an amendment to the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Appropriations Act to add nearly $17 million to the Federal Railroad Administrations Safety and Operations Account.
By reducing funding to the program that gives grant money to transit agencies for new projects by just 4 percent, Congress could have fully funded our nation's rail safety and operations. At a time when our federal debt is more than $18 trillion, we must prioritize the maintenance and safety of our current infrastructure before taking on new projects.
As I wrote in a recent op-ed in the
The Record
about the need to prioritize safety over new transit projects:
"In New Jersey alone, we have more than 1,000 miles of commuter railroad tracks and 2,400 miles of freight railroad tracks. Furthermore, New Jerseyans travel more than 100 million miles on commuter trains every year. Americans both here and across the nation need assurance that Congress and the rail industry are taking the appropriate steps to ensure rail safety. "
I am disappointed that the House ignored the call of our constituents by voting against this commonsense amendment, but I will continue to fight for the safety of our train passengers and North Jersey communities.
Sincerely,
Scott Garrett
