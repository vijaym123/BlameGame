Merry Christmas
Christmas is a
time of faith and fellowship; a time to share with family and loved
ones; a time to pause before what will certainly be a busy new year to
come.
It is also a good time to remember how important it is to
give back to our communities and serve our fellow citizens in whatever
way possible.
Because ours is a nation richly blessed, we must
never forget our obligation to be good stewards of the opportunities
we have and to seek out solutions to the challenges we face with
courage and principle.
This past year
has shown that we are still a nation that looks for opportunity even
in the face of adversity.
Theres been improvement to be found
in our economy thanks to the ingenuity and hard-work of the American
people.
However, the current state of our economy must not become
the new normal.
There are far too many families and small
businesses that are still struggling to make ends meet.
On their
behalf and on behalf of generations to come, we remain committed to
producing positive solutions in the new year to address our most pertinent
challenges
whether it be our nations economy, the debt and/or the
broader challenge of an inefficient and too often unaccountable
government.
As always, I believe that
there are positive solutions to answer all of our challenges.
Working together, we can make our nation stronger than ever
before.
At this special time, may you and
your family have a safe and joyful holiday.
For those families
and their loved ones who are serving this nation in uniform and in
dangerous places around the world, thank you and God bless you for all that
you do to protect our freedom each and every day.
May God
continue to bless our nation.
