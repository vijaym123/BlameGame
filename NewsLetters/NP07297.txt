ON THE ISSUES
LEGISLATIVE
August 06, 2014
D e ar
Friends,
Its hard to believe that we are more than halfway
through the year.
Congress only
has four months to tackle the issues most important to Americans, and
I am deeply disappointed that the House hasnt yet addressed the need
to extend unemployment insurance or fix our broken immigration
system.
The gridlock in Washington is among
the worst that I have seen in my 26 years serving in Congress, but I
have continued to push for meaningful
legislation.
Superstorm Sandy showed little mercy as it swept
through parts of the 16th Congressional
District.
Flood insurance premiums were set to skyrocket -- and
in some cases soar as high as an extra $10,000 a year -- unless
Congress took some sort of corrective action.
I cosponsored the
" Homeowners Flood Insurance Affordability Act ," which delayed
price increases for flood insurance premiums and reinstated
grandfathered rates for properties that were remapped into higher-risk areas. In
March, the President signed the bill into
law.
I have also worked hard to secure federal funding for
communities in our District to help offset rebuilding costs, and cosponsored
the " Hurricane Sandy Tax Relief
Act ."
I recognize the need to have a coordinated federal response
in the event of a nuclear disaster, and introduced the " Nuclear
Disaster Preparedness Act " to help achieve this goal. With a
district so closely located to the Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant, I am
keenly aware of how important it is to be prepared and I am committed to
doing everything I can to protect our citizens in the event of a
nuclear emergency.
I am equally committed
to safeguarding our environment. I sponsored the " Open Fuel
Standard Act " which requires 80 percent of new cars sold in the United
States to run on any combination of ethanol, methanol or gasoline by
2016, and introduced legislation that would prevent repeat polluters
from benefiting from certain tax
breaks.
As a senior member of the Subcommittee on Health of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee, I wrote legislation to reauthorize
funding for poison center programs and for Muscular Dystrophy
research.
The " Poison Center Network Act "
reauthorizes grants to fund the national toll-free phone number,
poison control centers and a national media campaign. New York has two
poison centers that field over 164,000 calls a
year.
Hundreds of thousands of children and adults
currently suffer from various forms of Muscular Dystrophy in the United
States. The " MD CARE Act " ensures that we are able to better
respond to the changing needs of people living with MD by updating the
current law to reflect scientific gains, among other
things.
I encourage you to stay current on
important legislation that impacts you and your community, by signing up for
my newsletter.
I enjoy hearing
from each of you, and look forward to keeping you informed of my
efforts to serve our community.
Sincerely,
Eliot L. Engel
