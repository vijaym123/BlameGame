Capitol Update
Warrior Caucus
Congressman Cook and Congressman Mark Takano (D-Riverside) have worked
together to establish the Work for Warriors Caucus. This bipartisan
caucus will promote and increase awareness of California's extremely
successful Work for Warriors program, with the eventual goal of
expanding the program in California and seeing it replicated in other
states.
The Work for Warriors Program (WFW) was established in 2012 using state
funding. Its mission is to reduce unemployment in the California
National Guard (CNG) by 25 percent. Due to the success of the program,
earlier this year the Department of Defense provided $1 million to
maintain and expand WFW.
Said Cook, "The Work for Warriors Caucus will promote the Work for
Warriors program which has been tremendously successful in helping
California National Guard members find employment in the civilian job
market. It's one of the most effective programs of its kind. I hope
that our caucus can help to make the program even more successful and
expand it to other states."

A Special Message from Congressman Cook on the American Health Care
Reform Act
The implementation of Obamacare continues to leave millions of
Americans uncertain about where they will find their healthcare
coverage on January 1. Individuals have seen higher premiums,
discontinued healthcare plans, and confusion over where and how to sign
up. Doctors remain worried about the fees and resources needed to
handle the expected influx of new patients. As I traveled across the
Eighth District last week, I listened to my constituents, and it was
clear to me that it's not enough to simply repeal Obamacare. We need a
real market-based solution.
Recently, I cosponsored the American Health Care Reform Act (AHCRA),
H.R. 3121. This reform bill decouples insurance from employment by
providing the same standard tax deductions for individuals that
businesses currently receive. It ensures that healthcare is accessible
to all through a Standard Deduction for Health Insurance (SDHI) for
both individuals and families. The SDHI encourages Americans to obtain
health insurance of their own choosing through creative market-driven
solutions.
Current tax law strongly favors employer-sponsored coverage, which
hurts and undermines the self-employed and small business owners of
America. The standard deductions of $7,500 per individual and $20,000
per family each year, allows for individuals and community associations
to maintain the same buying power exclusively held by employers. H.R.
3121 levels the playing field between individuals and businesses by
re-establishing a consumer-driven individual marketplace as opposed to
a government-driven model.
H.R. 3121 safeguards individuals with pre-existing conditions by
creating high-risk pools. These high-risk pools are capped at 200
percent of the average premium of the state. This plan extends existing
health privacy guaranteed availability protections, and improves
insurance portability.
Every day, I hear from more constituents who are losing their current
healthcare plans. H.R. 3121 honors the commitment the federal
government made during the Obamacare debate when Americans were
promised that if they like their current healthcare insurance, they
could keep it.

District Update
California Retired Teachers Association
This past Thursday, November 7, Congressman Cook met with the
California Retired Teachers Association Division 74 in Barstow. He had
a great time speaking and meeting with teachers who have dedicated
their lives to educating California students.
Informational Forum on Veterans' Benefits
On Friday, November 8, Congressman Cook hosted an informational forum
on veterans' benefits. The event provided important information
regarding government benefits and services provided to active-duty
service members, veterans, and dependents. In addition, representatives
from agencies provided veterans' services answered questions from
attendees.
Lewis Center Gym Opening
Congressman Cook was honored to speak with students at the Lewis
Educational Center on November 8. He was in attendance to recognize the
opening on the gym at the Lewis Center. He enjoyed meeting with
students who represent the future of our nation.
Victorville Veterans Day Parade
Congressman Cook participated in Victorville's Parade and Ceremony this
past Veteran's day. The event celebrated servicemen and women past and
present. He was honored to meet Lt. Col. Tony Marshall, USAF, a Vietnam
POW along with many other service members.
Veterans Corner
This past Monday, November 11, Americans came together to celebrate our
men and women in uniform who have valiantly served our nation. It is
that commitment to honor and serve that makes our great nation truly
the best in the world. The House Veterans Affairs committee is charged
with keeping our promises to our veterans.
Since he took office last January, Congressman Cook has worked
diligently to expand and protect the benefits that should be provided
to our Veterans. When sequester threatened military tuition assistance,
Congressman Cook cosponsored legislation to restore military tuition
assistance. Education allows our service members to acquire the skills
they need to better serve our nation and get good jobs after they
serve. Congressman Cook and the Committee worked together to protect
education assistance for veterans.
The Committee has also worked to pass the "Homeless Veterans
Reintegration Program Reauthorization Act (HVRP)." It reauthorizes a
program that offers grants to organizations that assist veterans with
job training and placement. The Government Accountability Office found
that 63 percent of homeless veterans enrolled in HVRP programs were
able to find employment.
The "Prioritizing Urgent Claims for Veterans Act," a measure
Congressman Cook has fought for, recently passed the House unanimously.
This legislation will help solve the claims backlog that is preventing
veterans from receiving the services we promise. It will prioritize
claims to veterans who meet certain criteria such as having attained
the age of 70, are terminally ill, or have a life-threatening illness.
There are too many veterans that can't get access to the healthcare
they deserve. This is a step in the right direction towards ensuring
those most in need get the care they deserve.
Our veterans fought for our country, now Congressman Cook will make
sure that Congress fights for them.

A
Special
Message
from
Congressman
Cook
on
the
American
Health
Care
Reform
Act
The
implementation
of
Obamacare
continues
to
leave
millions
of
Americans
uncertain
about
where
they
will
find
their
healthcare
coverage
on
January
1.
Individuals
have
seen
higher
premiums,
discontinued
healthcare
plans,
and
confusion
over
where
and
how
to
sign
up.
Doctors
remain
worried
about
the
fees
and
resources
needed
to
handle
the
expected
influx
of
new
patients.
As
I
traveled
across
the
Eighth
District
last
week,
I
listened
to
my
constituents,
and
it
was
clear
to
me
that
it&#8217;s
not
enough
to
simply
repeal
Obamacare.
We
need
a
real
market-based
solution.
Recently,
I
cosponsored
the
American
Health
Care
Reform
Act
(AHCRA),
H.R.
3121.
This
reform
bill
decouples
insurance
from
employment
by
providing
the
same
standard
tax
deductions
for
individuals
that
businesses
currently
receive.
It
ensures
that
healthcare
is
accessible
to
all
through
a
Standard
Deduction
for
Health
Insurance
(SDHI)
for
both
individuals
and
families.
The
SDHI
encourages
Americans
to
obtain
health
insurance
of
their
own
choosing
through
creative
market-driven
solutions.
Current
tax
law
strongly
favors
employer-sponsored
coverage,
which
hurts
and
undermines
the
self-employed
and
small
business
owners
of
America.
The
standard
deductions
of
$7,500
per
individual
and
$20,000
per
family
each
year,
allows
for
individuals
and
community
associations
to
maintain
the
same
buying
power
exclusively
held
by
employers.
H.R.
3121
levels
the
playing
field
between
individuals
and
businesses
by
re-establishing
a
consumer-driven
individual
marketplace
as
opposed
to
a
government-driven
model.
H.R.
3121
safeguards
individuals
with
pre-existing
conditions
by
creating
high-risk
pools.
These
high-risk
pools
are
capped
at
200
percent
of
the
average
premium
of
the
state.
This
plan
extends
existing
health
privacy
guaranteed
availability
protections,
and
improves
insurance
portability.
Every
day,
I
hear
from
more
constituents
who
are
losing
their
current
healthcare
plans.
H.R.
3121
honors
the
commitment
the
federal
government
made
during
the
Obamacare
debate
when
Americans
were
promised
that
if
they
like
their
current
healthcare
insurance,
they
could
keep
it.

Veterans
Corner
This
past
Monday,
November
11,
Americans
came
together
to
celebrate
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
who
have
valiantly
served
our
nation.
It
is
that
commitment
to
honor
and
serve
that
makes
our
great
nation
truly
the
best
in
the
world. The
House
Veterans
Affairs
committee
is
charged
with
keeping
our
promises
to
our
veterans.
Since
he
took
office
last
January,
Congressman
Cook
has
worked
diligently
to
expand
and
protect
the
benefits
that
should
be
provided
to
our
Veterans.
When
sequester
threatened
military
tuition
assistance,
Congressman
Cook
cosponsored
legislation
to
restore
military
tuition
assistance.
Education
allows
our
service
members
to
acquire
the
skills
they
need
to
better
serve
our
nation
and
get
good
jobs
after
they
serve.
Congressman
Cook
and
the
Committee
worked
together
to
protect
education
assistance
for
veterans.
The
Committee
has
also
worked
to
pass
the
&#8220;Homeless
Veterans
Reintegration
Program
Reauthorization
Act
(HVRP).&#8221;
It
reauthorizes
a
program
that
offers
grants
to
organizations
that
assist
veterans
with
job
training
and
placement.
The
Government
Accountability
Office
found
that
63
percent
of
homeless
veterans
enrolled
in
HVRP
programs
were
able
to
find
employment.
The
&#8220;Prioritizing
Urgent
Claims
for
Veterans
Act,"
a
measure
Congressman
Cook
has
fought
for, recently
passed
the
House
unanimously.
This
legislation
will
help
solve
the
claims
backlog
that
is
preventing
veterans
from
receiving
the
services
we
promise.
It
will
prioritize
claims
to
veterans
who
meet
certain
criteria
such
as
having
attained
the
age
of
70,
are
terminally
ill,
or
have
a
life-threatening
illness.
There
are
too
many
veterans
that
can&#8217;t
get
access
to
the
healthcare
they
deserve.
This
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
towards
ensuring
those
most
in
need
get
the
care
they
deserve.
Our
veterans
fought
for
our
country,
now
Congressman
Cook
will
make
sure
that
Congress
fights
for
them.
