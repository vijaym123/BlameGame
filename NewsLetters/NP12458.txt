Dear Friend,
I hope you had a good week. Below is a brief summary of what I've been
up to.
Improving Access to Health Care
For the last year, I've been working to improve the Affordable Care Act
and ensure that thousands of Granite Staters have access to quality,
affordable health care.
After news broke that only Anthem would offer health insurance plans
through the Marketplace in 2014, and that it decided to offer a narrow
network
of hospitals and doctors, I worked to ensure that people who had
individual policies with Anthem could keep their doctors and hospitals
for 2014 as long as they renewed their plans early.
This week, New Hampshire received two good pieces of news. The first
piece of good news
came on Tuesday, when the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) responded to my requests to strengthen network adequacy standards
. For months, I've requested
that HHS review network adequacy in New Hampshire because I believe
Anthem's network is too narrow. After first rubber-stamping the ACA
Marketplace network in New Hampshire, HHS will now require insurers to
provide comprehensive lists of health care providers in their networks,
and it will actively evaluate whether they provide reasonable access to
hospitals, primary care doctors, and other essential services.
This is welcome news for Granite State families, but it doesn't change
the fact that the public deserves answers this year to questions about
Anthem's network adequacy. That's why I am also calling on Anthem
to allow the New Hampshire
Insurance Department to release the results of its Market Conduct Exam
before a public hearing in Concord on Feb. 10. The Market Conduct Exam
indicates the strength and adequacy of Anthem's narrow network. The
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not require a Market
Conduct Exam before it approved Anthem's narrow network last year, but
the New Hampshire Insurance Department recently requested the exam.
The second positive development happened on Thursday, when New
Hampshire state leaders reached a bipartisan agreement to expand
Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act
. This
decision will improve the health and financial security of
approximately 50,000 Granite Staters. One of the reasons I voted for
the Affordable Care Act was because I believe that no one in New
Hampshire should suffer because they can't afford health care. By
ensuring coverage for thousands of New Hampshire individuals and
families, we will improve access to healthcare and strengthen our
state's economy.
I am grateful to our NH leaders on both sides of the
aisle in Concord for finding agreement. They deserve a lot of credit
for this effort.
As most of you know, I support the Affordable Care Act, especially
provisions to help people with preexisting conditions get coverage,
save seniors money
, and prevent women from
being charged more than men, but I've also been disappointed by the
rollout of the bill and Anthem's narrow network in New Hampshire.
During a meeting at the White House on Tuesday, I spoke with President
Obama about these issues, and I told him that I believe some people
should tender their resignations due to these problems. While it was a
private meeting, it got leaked to the press. I stand by my comment.
Standing up for Veterans
On Monday, the House passed H.R. 357, the GI Bill Tuition Fairness Act
of 2013
. This bill, which I
cosponsored, would ensure that veterans can attend state-run higher
education institutions at in-state tuition rates regardless of their
residency status. My father was a World War II veteran who went to
college on the GI Bill, and as a member of the House Armed Services
Committee, I've consistently supported tuition assistance programs for
veterans. I was a cosponsor of the Post 9/11 GI Bill, which gave
service members who were on active duty after September 11, 2001 up to
four academic years of education benefits, including stipends for
housing and books.
On Tuesday, I joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers to introduce the
Wounded Veterans Recreation Act of 2014
. This bill would ensure
that service-disabled veterans have a lifetime pass to the 2,000
national parks and federal recreational lands managed by the National
Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
Bureau of Land Management, and Bureau of Reclamation. There are 3.5
million veterans living with a service-connected disability, and this
bill is a good way to show our nation's gratitude.
Expanding Access to Heating
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced that it will
release $3.384 million in Low Income Home Energy Assistance (LIHEAP)
funds for Granite State residents. The entire NH Delegation requested
LIHEAP funds in Congress, and I am very glad that the most vulnerable
in New Hampshire will have more access to heating assistance this
Winter. You can read more
about it in the Union
Leader.
President Obama's State of the Union Address
Last Tuesday, I attended the State of the Union Address in Washington.
President Obama's speech focused on the struggles of the middle class.
Congress and the White House should stay focused on finding bipartisan
solutions to the problems facing the middle class and the poor, and
work together to jumpstart the American Dream.
Women's Hearts and Women's Wages
On Thursday, I joined the American Heart Association and its Go Red For
Women movement to raise awareness about heart disease. Heart disease is
the leading cause of death in America. About 600,000 people
die of heart disease in the United States
every year - that's 1 in every 4 deaths. Last week, I visited
Homemakers Health Services in Rochester, and we talked about our shared
commitment to fighting heart disease through research, preventive care,
exercise, and a healthy diet.
I was also on a panel with Lilly Ledbetter, discussing the importance
of passing the Paycheck Fairness Act and raising the minimum wage.
It's
been seven years since I saw Lilly testify before our Education and
Labor Committee, and working women and families are still waiting for
paycheck fairness. When women succeed, families succeed, and our
economy grows stronger.
Helping Granite State Farms and Businesses
Last week, I voted for the Farm Bill. Like many of you, I was disgusted
by some of the bill's provisions. It is outrageous that this
legislation gave away millions of dollars in subsidies while reducing
funding for SNAP. But I supported this bill because the good (barely)
outweighed the bad.
The Republican House had first voted to cut SNAP by $40 billion, so $8
billion limits the pain. Nobody in New Hampshire will see their food
stamps cut because of this, but other states will and it's awful.
I heard overwhelmingly from Granite State farmers and small businesses
that this legislation would help NH. I also heard from anti-hunger
advocates who told me that they support this bill because it would
reduce the proposed level of SNAP cuts and increase funding for
emergency food assistance programs. It also doubled the value of food
stamps if recipients used them at local farmers markets, which will
help promote New Hampshire farms and good nutrition. The bill also had
new environmental initiatives for farm land.
Now, Congress needs to support emergency unemployment benefits to 1.7
million Americans who lost their jobs through no fault of their own.
Speaker Boehner needs to let the House vote on this before too many
lose the roof over their heads. There is only one job for every three
job seekers, and we must help those who cannot find work.
Thanks for reading.
Best Wishes,
Carol

Dear
Friend,
I
hope
you
had
a
good
week.
Below
is
a
brief
summary
of
what
I&#8217;ve
been
up
to.
Improving
Access
to
Health
Care
For
the
last
year,
I&#8217;ve
been
working
to
improve
the
Affordable
Care
Act
and
ensure
that
thousands
of
Granite
Staters
have
access
to
quality,
affordable
health
care.
After
news
broke
that
only
Anthem
would
offer
health
insurance
plans
through
the
Marketplace
in
2014,
and
that
it
decided
to
offer
a
narrow
network
of
hospitals
and
doctors,
I
worked
to
ensure
that
people
who
had
individual
policies
with
Anthem
could
keep
their
doctors
and
hospitals
for
2014
as
long
as
they
renewed
their
plans
early.
This
week,
New
Hampshire
received
two
good
pieces
of
news.
The
first
piece
of
good
news
came
on
Tuesday,
when
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
(HHS)
responded
to
my
requests
to
strengthen
network
adequacy
standards .
For
months,
I&#8217;ve
requested
that
HHS
review
network
adequacy
in
New
Hampshire
because
I
believe
Anthem&#8217;s
network
is
too
narrow.
After
first
rubber-stamping
the
ACA
Marketplace
network
in
New
Hampshire,
HHS
will
now
require
insurers
to
provide
comprehensive
lists
of
health
care
providers
in
their
networks,
and
it
will
actively
evaluate
whether
they
provide
reasonable
access
to
hospitals,
primary
care
doctors,
and
other
essential
services.
This
is
welcome
news
for
Granite
State
families,
but
it
doesn&#8217;t
change
the
fact
that
the
public
deserves
answers
this
year
to
questions
about
Anthem&#8217;s
network
adequacy.
That&#8217;s
why
I
am
also
calling
on
Anthem
to
allow
the
New
Hampshire
Insurance
Department
to
release
the
results of
its
Market
Conduct
Exam
before
a
public
hearing
in
Concord
on
Feb.
10.
The
Market
Conduct
Exam
indicates
the
strength
and
adequacy
of
Anthem&#8217;s
narrow
network.
The
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
did
not
require
a
Market
Conduct
Exam
before
it
approved
Anthem&#8217;s
narrow
network
last
year,
but
the
New
Hampshire
Insurance
Department
recently
requested
the
exam.
The
second
positive
development
happened
on
Thursday,
when
New
Hampshire
state
leaders
reached
a
bipartisan
agreement
to
expand
Medicaid
under
the
Affordable
Care
Act .
This
decision
will
improve
the
health
and
financial
security
of
approximately
50,000
Granite
Staters.
One
of
the
reasons
I
voted
for
the
Affordable
Care
Act
was
because
I
believe
that
no
one
in
New
Hampshire
should
suffer
because
they
can&#8217;t
afford
health
care.
By
ensuring
coverage
for
thousands
of
New
Hampshire
individuals
and
families,
we
will
improve
access
to
healthcare
and
strengthen
our
state&#8217;s
economy.
I
am
grateful
to
our
NH
leaders
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
in
Concord
for
finding
agreement.
They
deserve
a
lot
of
credit
for
this
effort.
As
most
of
you
know,
I
support
the
Affordable
Care
Act,
especially
provisions
to
help
people
with
preexisting
conditions
get
coverage,
save
seniors
money ,
and
prevent
women
from
being
charged
more
than
men,
but
I&#8217;ve
also
been
disappointed
by
the
rollout
of
the
bill
and
Anthem&#8217;s
narrow
network
in
New
Hampshire.
During
a
meeting
at
the
White
House
on
Tuesday,
I
spoke
with
President
Obama
about
these
issues,
and
I
told
him
that
I
believe
some
people
should
tender
their
resignations
due
to
these
problems.
While
it
was
a
private
meeting,
it
got
leaked
to
the
press.
I
stand
by
my
comment.
Standing
up
for
Veterans
On
Monday,
the
House
passed
H.R.
357,
the
GI
Bill
Tuition
Fairness
Act
of
2013 .
This
bill,
which
I
cosponsored,
would
ensure
that
veterans
can
attend
state-run
higher
education
institutions
at
in-state
tuition
rates
regardless
of
their
residency
status.
My
father
was
a
World
War
II
veteran
who
went
to
college
on
the
GI
Bill,
and
as
a
member
of
the
House
Armed
Services
Committee,
I&#8217;ve
consistently
supported
tuition
assistance
programs
for
veterans.
I
was
a
cosponsor
of
the
Post
9/11
GI
Bill,
which
gave
service
members
who
were
on
active
duty
after
September
11,
2001
up
to
four
academic
years
of
education
benefits,
including
stipends
for
housing
and
books.
On
Tuesday,
I
joined
a
bipartisan
group
of
lawmakers
to
introduce
the
Wounded
Veterans
Recreation
Act
of
2014 .
This
bill
would
ensure
that
service-disabled
veterans
have
a
lifetime
pass
to
the
2,000
national
parks
and
federal
recreational
lands
managed
by
the
National
Park
Service,
U.S.
Forest
Service,
U.S.
Fish
and
Wildlife
Service,
Bureau
of
Land
Management,
and
Bureau
of
Reclamation.
There
are
3.5
million
veterans
living
with
a
service-connected
disability,
and
this
bill
is
a
good
way
to
show
our
nation&#8217;s
gratitude.
Expanding
Access
to
Heating
The
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
announced
that
it
will
release
$3.384
million
in
Low
Income
Home
Energy
Assistance
(LIHEAP)
funds
for
Granite
State
residents.
The
entire
NH
Delegation
requested
LIHEAP
funds
in
Congress,
and
I
am
very
glad
that
the
most
vulnerable
in
New
Hampshire
will
have
more
access
to
heating
assistance
this
Winter.
You
can
read
more
about
it
in
the
Union
Leader.
President
Obama&#8217;s
State
of
the
Union
Address
Last
Tuesday,
I
attended
the
State
of
the
Union
Address
in
Washington.
President
Obama's
speech
focused
on
the
struggles
of
the
middle
class.
Congress
and
the
White
House
should
stay
focused
on
finding
bipartisan
solutions
to
the
problems
facing
the
middle
class
and the
poor,
and
work
together
to
jumpstart
the
American
Dream.
Women&#8217;s
Hearts
and
Women&#8217;s
Wages
On
Thursday,
I
joined
the
American
Heart
Association
and
its
Go
Red
For
Women
movement
to
raise
awareness
about
heart
disease.
Heart
disease
is
the
leading
cause
of
death
in
America.
About
600,000
people
die
of
heart
disease
in
the
United
States
every
year
&#8211;
that&#8217;s
1
in
every
4
deaths.
Last
week,
I
visited
Homemakers
Health
Services
in
Rochester,
and
we
talked
about
our
shared
commitment
to
fighting
heart
disease
through
research,
preventive
care,
exercise,
and
a
healthy
diet.
I
was
also on
a
panel
with
Lilly
Ledbetter,
discussing
the
importance
of
passing
the
Paycheck
Fairness
Act
and
raising
the
minimum
wage.
It&#8217;s
been
seven
years
since
I
saw
Lilly
testify
before
our
Education
and
Labor
Committee,
and
working
women
and
families
are
still
waiting
for
paycheck
fairness.
When
women
succeed,
families
succeed,
and
our
economy
grows
stronger.
Helping
Granite
State
Farms
and
Businesses
Last
week,
I
voted
for
the
Farm
Bill.
Like
many
of
you,
I
was
disgusted
by
some
of
the
bill&#8217;s
provisions.
It
is
outrageous
that
this
legislation
gave
away
millions
of
dollars
in
subsidies
while
reducing
funding
for
SNAP.
But
I
supported
this
bill
because
the
good
(barely)
outweighed
the
bad.
The
Republican
House
had
first
voted
to
cut
SNAP
by
$40
billion,
so
$8
billion
limits
the
pain.
Nobody
in
New
Hampshire
will
see
their
food
stamps
cut
because
of
this,
but
other
states
will
and
it&#8217;s
awful.
I
heard
overwhelmingly
from
Granite
State
farmers
and
small
businesses
that
this
legislation
would
help
NH.
I
also
heard
from
anti-hunger
advocates
who
told
me
that
they
support
this
bill
because
it
would
reduce
the
proposed
level
of
SNAP
cuts
and
increase
funding
for
emergency
food
assistance
programs.
It
also
doubled
the
value
of
food
stamps
if
recipients
used
them
at
local
farmers
markets, which
will
help
promote
New
Hampshire
farms
and
good
nutrition.
The
bill
also
had
new
environmental
initiatives
for
farm
land.
Now,
Congress
needs
to
support
emergency
unemployment
benefits
to
1.7
million
Americans
who
lost
their
jobs
through
no
fault
of
their
own.
Speaker
Boehner
needs
to
let
the
House
vote
on
this
before
too
many
lose
the
roof
over
their
heads.
There
is
only
one
job
for
every
three
job
seekers,
and
we
must
help
those
who
cannot
find
work.
Thanks
for
reading.
