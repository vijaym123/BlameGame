Four Steps You Can
Take If Your Credit or Debit Card Data Was
Hacked
As has been widely reported,
computer hackers stole credit card and personal information during the
holidays from over 100 million Target and Neiman Marcus customers.
It is likely that this trend will continue as other stores
acknowledge similar cyber thefts of their customers personal data.
These
data breaches expose millions of payment card accounts to potential
fraud.
The Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has published an
advisory
to help consumers protect themselves.
The advisory also
contains information on where to get help if consumers suspect their
information has been
compromised.
House Votes to Limit Womens
Health Care Choices
On January 28, a divided House of Representatives voted 227 to 188
to pass a controversial bill [H.R. 7] that would place restrictions
on how women with private insurance can spend private dollars in
purchasing health insurance.
Supporters of the bill falsely claim that
all they are doing is ensuring that no government funds are used to
fund abortions.
But that is already the law of the land, and has
been for decades.
What H.R. 7 actually does is deny
comprehensive health coverage to millions of women who work for small businesses
if their employee health coverage includes abortion services.
Currently, 87 percent of employer-provided insurance plans include
coverage for abortion.
Fliers to FCC: No In-Flight Phone
Calls!
As if air travel was
not already stressful enough, the Federal Communication Commission
(FCC) has proposed to allow in-flight cellphone use on commercial
flights.
In-flight cell phone use has been banned since 1991 on safety
grounds, but also because the vast majority of Americans cringe at the
idea of being trapped on a long flight next to someone who is
shouting into their cell phone.
The FCC is accepting public comment on its in-flight cell phone
proposal through February 14. Hundreds of consumers have already weighed
in with the FCC in opposition to in-flight cell calls.
Rep.
Levin recently joined 60 other members of Congress in writing a
letter
to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, asking the FCC to keep
its ban on cell phone calls on
planes.
U.S. Humane Society Gives
Rep. Levin a Perfect 100+ Score
The Humane Society just released its annual
scorecard
which reports on how Members of Congress
measure up on animal protection issues in 2013.
Rep. Levin earned a
perfect 100+ score.
