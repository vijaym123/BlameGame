Friend,
A lot of folks have been asking us about our opponents lately - who are these people already attacking Ami?
Well - here&#39;s the deal. We have three Republican opponents, and each one is more frightening than the next.
One is anti LGBT rights, supported Don&#39;t Ask Don&#39;t Tell and
stood against expanding hate crime laws to protect gays and lesbians
Another wants to
roll back the clock on women&#39;s rights , and thinks politicians should be able to interfere in women&#39;s health care choices
And last but not least, the third is an avowed Tea Party member,
endorsed by Tea Party groups and PACs funded by the Koch Brothers
Elections matter. These aren&#39;t the kind of people we want representing our community, but all three of them are dead set on being your voice in Congress.
Today we&#39;re kicking off our end of quarter fundraising drive. This will be the first fundraising report since our opponents opened their offices and kicked off their ground games, so it&#39;s crucial that we show our strength.
We need to raise $10,000 by our deadline on March 31st. Can you give $5 or more now to help us reach our goal?
The entire time he&#39;s been in Congress, Ami has been fighting for commonsense solutions. He is a co-chair of No Labels Problem Solvers, he led the effort to pass No Budget No Pay in Congress, and he consistently works across the aisle to find pragmatic solutions on our behalf. Would any of our opponents take the same steps? We can&#39;t risk finding out.
Our opponents and the political pundits will judge our momentum based on this first fundraising report of 2014. Our deadline is March 31st, and we must hit our $10,000 goal in order to send Ami back to Congress.
We need you now. Click here to give $5 or more to stand with Ami.
Thanks for all you do.
Team Bera
P.S. Our opponents are extreme and working hard to take back this seat. This is our first head to head test this year -
