Friends,
It is an honor to
represent you and your family in Congress and work on the significant needs of
the Seventh District.
As your Congressman, I am able to
help you in a variety of ways.
My offices are here to
assist you; whether you will be visiting Washington D.C. and would
like to tour the Capitol, or if you need assistance with a federal
agency.
Below are just a few of the ways in which I can
help:
Casework:
One of the most important jobs of
congressional offices is helping you with federal issues. Although I cannot
override the decisions made by a federal agency, I can often intervene on a
constituent's behalf to answer questions, find solutions, or just cut
through the red tape.
If you need assistance with a federal
agency please
complete the privacy authorization
form
and submit it to our nearest district office.
Tours:
We are able to request a variety of tours on your
behalf, including tours of the U.S. Capitol and the White House.
White
House tour requests must be submitted at least 21 days in advance of
the requested dates.
If you are planning on visiting the
Washington, D.C. area, visit
my website
for
areas of interest and contact my Washington office to request a
tour.
Veterans:
I am
forever grateful to America's veterans who have served our country with
pride and who have fought for the freedoms we enjoy.
As your
Congressman, it's an honor to
help veterans
receive the benefits that they have earned through their service.
This also includes obtaining lost or missing medals.
If you
would like help with a VA issue, please contact our nearest district
office.
Passports:
We may be able to help you expedite your passport application in
an emergency, report lost passports, and monitor overseas travel
restrictions.
Please contact one of the district offices listed below
for assistance.
Flag Requests:
If you would like to have a flag flown over the
Capitol to commemorate a special occasion, please
fill out this form .
Requests to have a flag flown may
only be requested for future dates.
For more information on flag
requests and other constituent services, visit my
website.
Internships:
My office is always
accepting applications
from college students and young professionals
interested in interning in my Washington or district offices.
If
you would like to apply for an internship, please fill out
this application
and submit the requested
materials.
Academy Nominations:
I have the honor of
nominating up to ten qualified students per year to each of our nations
Military Service Academies.
All interested students must submit
their
application packets
by October 13,
2014.
For a list of supporting documentation that is required to
complete an application packet, visit my website.
Should you
have any additional questions, please call my Grand Strand District
Office.
Commu nication:
Please stay connected
so you can receive the most current information. I encourage you to
follow me on
Twitter
and on
Facebook
by liking' my page.
Since I'm not always
able to travel back to the Grand Strand and Pee Dee during the week, I
will occasionally host telephone townhall meetings and post video
updates.
You can also read press releases on
my website .
I appreciate and value your input and
encourage you to write me about legislation issues that are important to
you.
As always, it
is an honor to serve you in the 113th Congress.

do not hesitate to contact one of the Seventh District Offices if I
can assist you in anyway:
