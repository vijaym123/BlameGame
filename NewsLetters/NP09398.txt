Wishing You a Safe, Happy Memorial Day
A sentinel stands guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier
during Memorial Day weekend of 2014.
Dear Friend,
I hope this beautiful Memorial Day finds you enjoying friends and
family while you remember the heroes of every generation who have
served and sacrificed for our great nation.
There's an old saying - "America will remain the land of the free - so
long as it is the home of the brave." This is a day to give thanks for
our freedom, honor the bravery and patriotism of those who have fought
to preserve it - and give a special salute of thanks to all our
veterans and their families.
Look for your regular Monday Report tomorrow. And have a great week.
Sincerely,
Washington, D.C.
