The Innovation Act: promoting &amp; protecting American innovation. What does this mean for you?
The patent system in the United States is a vital part of what makes our job creators competitive in the global market place. In fact, the patent system was so important to our Founding Fathers that protection provisions for authors
and inventors were included within the Constitution.
&#8220;The Congress shall have Power ... To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.&#8221;
ARTICLE I, SECTION 8,
CLAUSE 8
The threats to businesses occur when the patents being issued end up being weak, vague or poorly-granted, allowing for numerous patents infringement lawsuits against American businesses with the hopes of securing a quick payday.
This
abusive patent litigation causes a drag on our economy.
For example, in the early 1900s
Ford Motor Company was faced with a type of patent infringement lawsuit which very well could have jeopardized the production of the Model-T, enabling Americans to experience a new and affordable form of transportation.
For future economic security, being able to protect our citizens&#8217; inventions, their opportunity to create jobs and grow capital is of the upmost importance.
Today, the House of Representatives passed H.R.3309, the Innovation Act, a
measure dedicated to enacting commonsense patent litigation reforms that will level the playing field for small businesses and providing greater clarity when dealing with patent laws.
