Dear Friend, The final FEC quarterly deadline before the election is almost here.
That goal is important for all the reasons Ed mentioned this morning, so I won&rsquo;t list them again. But I will ask you to contribute if you&rsquo;re able. Give $5 before midnight tomorrow and help us blow past our FEC filing deadline goal.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
If you want your campaign contributions to have an effect on this year&rsquo;s elections, please give soon -- every dollar counts, and with a heavy schedule for October, we need your help to finance our operations.
Your contributions put gas in our organizers&rsquo; cars and coffee in our phone bankers&rsquo; cups. By
giving $5 before the FEC deadline , you&rsquo;ll ensure that our field team has the resources necessary to spread Ed&rsquo;s message and turn out our voters on election day.
So give $5. Give $10. If you can, give more.
And thank you for helping Ed&rsquo;s campaign.
Colleen
