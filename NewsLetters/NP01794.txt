Warm Wishes to You and Yours
In my Christian faith tradition, we are approaching the holy days of our Easter season. Our Jewish brothers and sisters are preparing to celebrate Passover.
Due to these busy and blessed occasions, EC from DC will return next week.
For all those celebrating, I wish you and your family health, hope, and happiness.
Warmly,
Emanuel
