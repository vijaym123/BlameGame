David -- we&rsquo;re running out of time, so I&rsquo;ll get right to it:
After tonight, we&rsquo;ll have a permanent record of all the Founding Members of our Middle Class Action Fund.
That means we&rsquo;ll know exactly who stepped up to fight for a higher minimum wage, equal pay for equal work, and to give Illinois&rsquo; families a fair shot. According to our records it looks like you haven&rsquo;t registered as a Founding Member.
