I&rsquo;ve been around politics for a long time, and even I can&rsquo;t believe what just happened:
FRIDAY:
In a closed-door meeting, some House Republicans discussed impeaching President Obama.
YESTERDAY:
One of Boehner&rsquo;s top deputies went on Fox News and REFUSED to take impeachment off the table.
TODAY:
Boehner penned a USA TODAY op-ed threatening President Obama with a lawsuit
This is no laughing matter. These are the same Tea Party Republicans that managed to shut down the government last year. They&rsquo;re going to keep coming up with new ways to sabotage Barack Obama&rsquo;s presidency. And for these guys, impeachment would be the pinnacle of Republican sabotage.
My friends at the DCCC are doing all they can to take on the Tea Party -- but they&rsquo;re in a bind. They need 78,321 more to meet their 100,000 donation goal before Republicans vote THIS WEEK to sue the President. I&rsquo;m pleading: can you rush a donation now? All Gifts Today Triple-Matched!
