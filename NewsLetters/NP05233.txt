I'm really disappointed --
and worried .
I've been counting on a massive showing of grassroots support to defeat Boehner&rsquo;s Tea Party Republicans. President Clinton AND President Obama
have both taken the time to contact you and ask for your support.
But at last count, we&rsquo;re still a whopping 37,OOO donations short of our goal.
The biggest ad buy deadline of the election is tomorrow. There are only 2 weeks until Election Day. I'm not sure what else to do.
David -- I know you don&rsquo;t want to see a Republican wave destroy President Obama&rsquo;s last two years. Can you make a donation of any size before it&rsquo;s too late? UPDATE: All donations now Triple-Matched through midnight! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
Nancy
