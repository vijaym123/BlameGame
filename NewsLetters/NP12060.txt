Capitol Update
Congressman Cook Votes to Stop Government Abuse
Today, Congressman Paul Cook voted on legislation to stop government
abuse. With scandals in the IRS, NSA, and numerous other government
agencies, the House of Representatives has taken up legislation
designed to protect citizens from this government fraud and abuse.
The following bills included in today's vote series were:
H.R. 1211, the "Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Oversight and
Implementation Act of 2014," which directs federal agencies to process
FOIA requests with a presumption of openness. This will place the
burden on the government to justify withholding information, rather
than on the private citizens requesting information. Additionally it
creates a pilot FOIA online program. This will allow the American
people to submit requests at one location online, and for agencies to
publicly respond.
H.R. 1423, the "Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act," requires every federal
agency to provide taxpayers an annual report card on all of its
programs. These must provide information about administrative costs and
staffing, expenditures for services, and the number of program
recipients.
H.R. 2531, the "Protecting Taxpayers from Intrusive Internal Revenue
Service's (IRS) Requests Act," prevents the IRS from inquiring about an
individual's religious, political, or social beliefs.
Cook said, "Government needs to be open and act honestly with taxpayers
about what's on the books. I'm fighting to end IRS targeting of
citizens for their religious and political beliefs, to eliminate
excessive government regulations, and to empower citizens to get timely
answers from their government. Sluggish job growth, soaring health care
costs, and an out-of-control government are not what hardworking
Americans deserve."
2014 Congressional Art Competition
Each spring, a nationwide high school arts competition is sponsored by
members of the U.S. House of Representatives. The Artistic Discovery
Contest is an opportunity to recognize and encourage the artistic
talent in each congressional district.
The Artistic Discovery Contest is open to all high school students in
the 8th District. Students will work through the art teachers at their
high school to submit works to the competition. The winning artwork
will be displayed in the U.S. Capitol complex for one year. In
addition, second place will be displayed in the Congressman's Capitol
Office, and the third place selection will be on display in the Apple
Valley District Office.
All artwork must be submitted by April 3, 2014. Art work entered in the
contest may be up to 28 inches by 28 inches (including the frame) and

The Congressional Art Competition began in 1982 to provide an

artistic talents of their young constituents. Since then, more than
700,000 high school students have been involved with the nationwide
competition.

District Update
A Special Honor
Mr. Stephen Taylor is a U.S. Air Force Veteran who served during the
Vietnam War. During his time in the Air Force, he earned several medals
including the Air Force Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service
Medal, Vietnam Service Medal with One Bronze Service Star, the Republic
of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm and Republic of Vietnam Campaign
Medal. Mr. Taylor contacted Congressman Cook's office to request
assistance in obtaining his service medals from the Dept. of the Air
Force. Congressman Cook was able to office expedite the receipt of
these service medals as well as assist Mr. Taylor with his approval for
Social Security benefits. On February 22, Congressman Cook's Field
Representative, Jan Leja, attended an event to honor Mr. Taylor for his
service to our country and present him with his service medals.
Congressman Cook is honored to have a hero like Mr. Taylor in his
district.
Congressman Cook is happy to assist constituents with help on similar
issues. Please contact his Apple Valley District Office with any
questions or concerns at (760) 247-1815.
Education Summit
On February 20, Congressman Cook hosted an education summit and met
with educators from across the 8th District to discuss ways to improve
our education system. They had a productive conversation about reducing
federal overreach into local education decisions and returning power
back to educators.
Veterans' Corner
The California Department of Veterans' Affairs recently estimated that
just over 20 percent of former service members are using their health
care benefits. The Department said an even lower percentage of
California veterans claim the compensation or pension they are entitled
to. Those rates are lower than the national average.
If you are a veteran in need of help accessing or understanding your
benefits, please contact Congressman Cook's Apple Valley District
Office at 760-247-1815.
