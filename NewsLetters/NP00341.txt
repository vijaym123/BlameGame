A Weekly e-Newsletter from
Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA)
June 5, 2015
Dear Friends,
This week, the Senate began debating the Fiscal Year 2016 Defense
Authorization Bill, a blueprint for defense spending priorities to
support our troops. This
legislation is critical to our national
security and our troops.
In the Preamble of the United States Constitution, one of the primary
duties for our government is to provide for the common defense. We
need to get our priorities in order when it comes to giving our men and
women in uniform the very best support possible to accomplish their
missions and return home safely.
Reining in Washington Regulations and the EPA
Newspapers from around the state
agree with me that a new rule from the Environmental
Protection Agency that would expand the government's regulation to
nearly all private and state waters in the United States, including
thousands of streams, creeks, wetlands, ponds and ditches, is yet
another power grab by the Obama administration that is harmful to our
state. This waters of the U.S. rule harms not only landowners, but
our entire agriculture industry in Georgia. Click here to read more
about how I am fighting this latest regulation from Washington.
Increasing Benefits for our Veterans
As the cost of living continues to rise, I am working to ensure that
our men and women in uniform who have sacrificed so much receive the
compensation they deserve. This week I introduced legislation to
increase veterans' disability benefits from the Department of Veterans
Affairs.
The Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2015
(S.1493)
would increase the rates of VA disability
compensation, dependency compensation for surviving children and
spouses, and the clothing allowance for veterans based on rising costs
of living.
I also discussed four key health legislation pieces at the Senate
Committee on Veterans' Affairs this week. These bills will assist women
veterans in receiving the quality care they deserve, help prevent our
veterans from becoming homeless, and assist as they return home from
military service.
Watch the full hearing here.
Protecting our National Security
The threats to our security here at home and throughout the world are
growing at an alarming rate. At a time when the current
administrations foreign policy has left a void in leadership around
the world, we cannot afford to create intelligence gaps that could
limit our capabilities to fight terrorism. I could not support the USA
FREEDOM Act that passed the Senate and was signed into law this week
because I believe that, in its current form, this measure downgrades
our ability to track the movements and contacts of known terrorists and
fails to provide our intelligence agencies with the tools and the time
they need to stand up a new counterterrorism program.
Keeping Things Private
There has been a lot of debate in the Senate recently over concerns
about the government collecting minimal phone call data to protect our
national security through the National Security Authority Agency (NSA);
however, I believe we should be more concerned about the recent data
breach at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
That's why I questioned IRS Commissioner
John Koskinen and Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J.
Russell George about this terrible breach of security during a Finance
Committee hearing on Tuesday that you can watch here
.
The information taxpayers are required to give the IRS is a lot more
private, personally identifying, and dangerous in the hands of the
wrong person than what is collected by the NSA for the purpose of
looking out for our national security. We need more protection
mechanisms in place to prevent the hundreds of thousands cases of tax
fraud and data and security breaches that occur at the IRS each year.
Educating our Students
This week, I brought attention again to the rising cost of higher
education and student debt, and I discussed the obligation universities
have to teach students about their debt during a Health, Education,
Labor and Pensions Committee hearing.

Around Georgia
I am delighted that I was able to help 37 high school seniors from
across Georgia receive appointments to United States military
academies, and I appreciate
each of these students' willingness to serve
our nation. My office honored these students and their families at my
annual Academy Appointees Salute last weekend.
I want to congratulate Ms. Sara Lepkofker and her team at Northview
High School for receiving a 2015 Toshiba/National Science Teachers
Association ExploraVision Award. It was a pleasure to meet with them
when they were in D.C. this week!
What's on Tap?
The Senate will resume consideration of the Fiscal Year 2016 Defense
Authorization Bill.

Dear

This

the
Senate
began
debating
the
Fiscal

2016
Defense
Authorization
Bill,
a
blueprint
for
defense
spending
priorities
to
support
our
troops.
This
legislation
is
critical
to
our
national
security
and
our
troops.
In
the
Preamble
of
the
United

Constitution,
one
of
the
primary

for
our

is
to
&#147;provide
for
the

We

Reining

Washington
Regulations
and
the

Newspapers

agree
with
me
that
a
new
rule
from
the

that
would
expand
the
government's
regulation
to
nearly
all
private
and
state
waters
in
the
United

including
thousands
of

creeks,
wetlands,
ponds
and
ditches,
is
yet
another
power
grab
by
the
Obama
administration
that
is
harmful
to
our
state.
This
&#147;waters
of
the
U.S.&#148;
rule
harms
not
only
landowners,
but
our
entire
agriculture
industry
in
Georgia.

Increasing
Benefits
for
our
Veterans
As
the
cost
of
living
continues
to
rise,
I
am
working
to
ensure
that
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
who
have
sacrificed
so
much
receive
the
compensation
they
deserve.
This
week
I
introduced
legislation
to
increase
veterans'
disability
benefits
from
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs.
The
Veterans'
Compensation
Cost-of-Living
Adjustment
Act
of
2015
(S.1493)
would
increase
the
rates
of
VA
disability
compensation,
dependency
compensation
for
surviving
children
and
spouses,
and
the
clothing
allowance
for
veterans
based
on
rising
costs
of
living.
I
also
discussed
four
key
health
legislation
pieces
at
the
Senate
Committee
on
Veterans'
Affairs
this
week.
These
bills
will
assist
women
veterans
in
receiving
the
quality
care
they
deserve,
help
prevent
our
veterans
from
becoming
homeless,
and
assist
as
they
return
home
from
military
service.
Watch
the
full
hearing
here.
Protecting
our
National
Security
The
threats
to
our
security
here
at
home
and
throughout
the
world
are
growing
at
an
alarming
rate.
At
a
time
when
the
current
administration&#146;s
foreign
policy
has
left
a
void
in
leadership
around
the
world,
we
cannot
afford
to
create
intelligence
gaps
that
could
limit
our
capabilities
to
fight
terrorism.
I
could
not
support
the
USA
FREEDOM
Act
that
passed
the
Senate
and
was
signed
into
law
this
week
because
I
believe
that,
in
its
current
form,
this
measure
downgrades
our
ability
to
track
the
movements
and
contacts
of
known
terrorists
and
fails
to
provide
our
intelligence
agencies
with
the
tools
and
the
time
they
need
to
stand
up
a
new
counterterrorism
program.
Keeping
Things
Private
There
has
been
a
lot
of
debate
in
the
Senate
recently
over
concerns
about
the
government
collecting
minimal
phone
call
data
to
protect
our
national
security
through
the
National
Security
Authority
Agency
(NSA);
however,
I
believe
we
should
be
more
concerned
about
the
recent
data
breach
at
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
(IRS).
That's
why
I
questioned
IRS
Commissioner
John
Koskinen
and
Treasury
Inspector
General
for
Tax
Administration
J.
Russell
George
about
this
terrible
breach
of
security
during
a
Finance
Committee
hearing
on
Tuesday
that
you
can
watch
here .
The
information
taxpayers
are
required
to
give
the
IRS
is
a
lot
more
private,
personally
identifying,
and
dangerous
in
the
hands
of
the
wrong
person
than
what
is
collected
by
the
NSA
for
the
purpose
of
looking
out
for
our
national
security.
We
need
more
protection
mechanisms
in
place
to
prevent
the
hundreds
of
thousands
cases
of
tax
fraud
and
data
and
security
breaches
that
occur
at
the
IRS
each
year.
Educating
our
Students
This
week,
I
brought
attention
again
to
the
rising
cost
of
higher
education
and
student
debt,
and
I
discussed
the
obligation
universities
have
to
teach
students
about
their
debt
during
a
Health,
Education,
Labor
and
Pensions
Committee
hearing.

Around
Georgia
I
am
delighted
that
I
was
able
to
help
37
high
school
seniors
from
across
Georgia
receive
appointments
to
United
States
military
academies,
and
I

My
office

these

Salute
last
weekend.
I
want
to
congratulate
Ms.
Sara
Lepkofker
and
her

at
Northview
High

for

It
