Dear Neighbor,
We had a lot of productive meetings and roundtables this week at home in the district centered on jobs. Whether it was talking about how to create thousands of construction and manufacturing jobs through our new roofing efficiency bill or the engineering jobs sustained in the district by a new Air Force contract, we&rsquo;re on the ground listening to how best we can support job growth in the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes.
TOM REED COMBINES ENERGY EFFICIENCY, JOBS AND COMMON SENSE IN NEW ROOFING EFFICIENCY BILL
At Evans Roofing Company in Elmira we talked about the common sense fix our
Roofing Efficiency Jobs Act
brings to the unfair and outdated depreciation schedule for roof replacements. The bill is estimated to create 40,000 construction and manufacturing jobs, improve energy efficiency and save small businesses millions each year in energy costs. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to put off money-saving upgrades. Watch a video from the meeting
here .

REED MEETS WITH HIGHWAY, TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS FOR INPUT AHEAD OF HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION BILL REAUTHORIZATION
We gathered input from local highway and transportation officials on the biggest challenges they face when making road and bridge upgrades. With the reauthorization of a major highway construction bill coming up in just a few short months, we need to be listening to experts on the ground to make sure we put together a fair bill. It&rsquo;s important we&rsquo;re constantly caring and looking out for our rural roads and bridges in need of repair.
LOCAL LOCKHEED MARTIN TO BENEFIT FROM AIR FORCE CONTRACT
In Owego yesterday, we celebrated the new contract for the Air Force&rsquo;s Combat Rescue Helicopter Program Lockheed Martin was recently awarded with Sikorsky. Once again, our local workforce is recognized as vital to the operation of some of our country&rsquo;s most high-tech, complex missions. Hundreds of manufacturing and engineering jobs sustained by this contract will ultimately support the brave men and women of our Armed Forces.
CORNING POST OFFICE ONE STEP CLOSER TO BEING NAMED AFTER SPECIALIST RYAN JAYNE
Our bill that passed the House last month
to name the Post Office in Corning after Army Specialist Ryan Jayne recently passed out of the Senate committee. Next step: a vote on the Senate floor. Specialist Jayne, an Elmira native, died in 2012 while serving in Afghanistan. His sacrifice will not be forgotten and I am honored to be a part of recognizing Specialist Jayne and his legacy in this lasting way.
Wishing you and your family a safe, enjoyable Fourth of July,
Tom
Driving around the district this week we were lucky enough to stop at this lemonade stand in Little Valley for a break &ndash; many thanks to these Cattaraugus students enjoying their summer vacation!
