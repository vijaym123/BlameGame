FORWARD TO A FRIEND

Dear Friend,
To wrap up my 30-day health initiative, the " Rangel Resolution ," I published an
e-Cookbook
this week. The e-cookbook is a compilation of recipes collected during the month of March from participants of the Rangel Resolution.
Included are my signature smoothie, breakfast recipes, as well as my wife's
famous crab cakes.
It's been getting a lot of buzz and I wanted to share it with you.
I encourage you to try at least one new recipe from the e-Cookbook at home, and add it to your repertoire.
Constituent Service Day
Thursday, I hosted my first
Constituent Service Day
at the Bronx Library Center where my staff made themselves available to help with Social Security, Immigration, Veterans Benefits, and a variety of other Federal Agency cases.
Also participating were SingleStop and IRS Tax advocates to provide free tax assistance to those in need.
Dozens attended and I plan on hosting another soon.
Please stay tuned for updates about upcoming Constituent Service Days.
Sincerely,
Charles Rangel
