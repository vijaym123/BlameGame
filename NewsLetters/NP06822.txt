Sorry to email you on a Saturday -- but this can&rsquo;t wait:
News just broke that Boehner&rsquo;s lieutenants have poured in
$1O,OOO,OOO.OO
to attack President Obama and defeat Democrats nationwide. Frankly, it&rsquo;s infuriating.
Republicans in Congress hand out tax breaks to millionaires, pick up massive checks from corporate interests&hellip; and then use all that cash to buy control of Congress.
But we don&rsquo;t have time to whine about it. We need to fight back -- and win. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re launching the
Shut Down the Tea Party
Project.
You&rsquo;ve been pre-selected to become a Founding Member. David Johnson Founding Member?
Not yet. Suggested Gift: $5.OO
David, you&rsquo;re one of our strongest supporters. So we&rsquo;re asking you to join this project. We need 10,000 members to be able to fight Boehner&rsquo;s millions --
just one person from 60659 zip code needs to step up.
Will you chip in any amount now to become a founding member?
