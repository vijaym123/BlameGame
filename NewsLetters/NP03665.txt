Dear
Friend,
As this congressional session and year comes to a
close, I want to share with you an update on the issues Ive been working
on as your representative in
Congress.
With more than 115 bipartisan cosponsors, my
Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, which was endorsed by the
Wall Street Journal
and countless families,
has finally taken mental illness out of the shadows and placed it
into the
bright light of hope
for millions. Two of
the bills main provisions aimed at helping the severely mentally ill
even
became
law .
My Oversight and Investigations
Subcommittee revealed that the Administration knew well in advance of the
rollout about the
fatal flaws
in Healthcare.gov.
Meanwhile, the House passed
legislation
to block a
taxpayer bailout of the insurance industry and allow families who liked
their health plan to keep
it.
Congressmen Mike Doyle, Keith Rothfus and I
partnered to ensure those VA officials who oversaw the deadly Legionnaires
outbreak were
held accountable , and that no
Pittsburgh area veteran would have to wait for medical care under the new
Veterans Access to Care through Choice,
Accountability, and Transparency Act , which resulted from our oversight work
in the House.
To push back against the EPAs War on Coal that has taken a toll
on local
miners , electricians, welders,
boilermakers, and
factory workers , I worked with my
colleagues to pass the
Coal Jobs Protection Act
(H.R.
5077).
Our
regions military retirees, active duty families, guardsmen and
reservists have reason to celebrate the new
Post
Exchange
(PX) and commissary in Moon Township, which ensures the 168,000
eligible military families in Southwestern Pennsylvania will continue
getting affordable groceries and
goods.
Motorists, pedestrians, business owners,
and residents in Carnegie, Scott Township, and Heidelberg
cheered
the completion of the tri-community route 50
infrastructure revitalization
project.
The failures of both the federal National Highway
Transportation Safety Administration and General Motors, which waited
nearly ten years
before issuing a recall of its
defective Chevy Cobalt. Our tense Oversight hearings gained nationwide
TV coverage from CNN to
Saturday Night
Live .
Over 150
lawmakers joined me in successfully pressuring the Administration to
stand up for steel and stop illegally-dumped imports of oil and gas
pipe from
South Korea
and other
countries.
Together, our
community celebrated the contributions of the nations oldest
Eagle Scout , a Vietnam War hero from Bethel Park who earned
the
Purple Heart , and a distinguished
Pennsylvania
state
trooper .
Through Oversight Committee meetings,
revealed how the Administrations amnesty policies contributed to the
surge of unaccompanied minors across the US-Mexico border this
past summer .
Im looking forward to an exciting new session of Congress as I
continue to advance these issues on behalf of Southwestern Pennsylvania
families in 2015. Ill keep you updated each week in my weekly email
newsletter. As always, I welcome your
feedback and
thoughts
and I extend to you and your family a prosperous, safe and
happy New Year.
Sincerely,
Tim
Murphy
Member of Congress
