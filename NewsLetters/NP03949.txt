Friend
Wanted to let you know that I just
cosponsored a new anti-amnesty amendment
to prevent funding to implement the Administrations executive amnesty.
The amendment was filed with the House Rules Committee this morning, as they meet to discuss the spending bill for the federal government.
It is crucial that Congress uses all tools available to rein in the Presidents overreach, and uphold the rule of law. Giving the power of the purse to Congress was not an accident, and it is time the Administration understands that adhering to the Constitution is not optional.
Yours in service,
Randy
