Invitation to a Unique Town Hall
On Monday, September 15th, I will be participating in a "Transatlantic Town Hall" with a group of German Members of Parliament who are visiting the United States.
The event will be held at Muhlenberg College, 2400 W Chew Street, Allentown, PA 18104 in the Seegers Union Building.
It begins at 3 PM and will last until 4 PM. The public is invited to attend.
We will be discussing our nations' mutual security, along with trade and energy policy. I hope you can join us.
Best regards,
CHARLIE
