VISITING DC
January 24, 2015
This week the President gave his State of the Union
speech
it was filled with words about working together and
bipartisanship and yet, in the two weeks leading up to the State of the Union, he
threatened to veto multiple bipartisan initiatives without ever seeing
legislative text.
The President
began the year with an opportunity to work with Congress on policies
that would help restore economic prosperity to our nation but chose
instead to double-down on more taxes, more debt, and more spending and
expanding the size and scope of the federal
government.
However, I know Congress will continue to propose
legislation that promotes economic growth, job creation, and a strong
national defense.
Finally, the
last several weeks have proven that Al-Qaeda is not decimated. It is
time for the President and his Administration to admit that and to
seriously attack the threat that radical Islamic terrorists present to us
and the rest of the world.
This
past Sunday, I joined Jim Scuitto on CNNs show State of the Union to
discuss terror threats. You can watch the interview below, along with
clips from my interviews with Wolf Blitzer, Lou Dobbs, and Martha
MacCallum.

On Wednesday , I introduced legislation
to help American families to address their dependent care needs
care
for both children and elderly relatives. The Child and Dependent Care
FSA Enhancement Act, would strengthen dependent care flexible
spending accounts (FSAs) for American families by increasing the amount of
pre-tax dollars that families can put into these accounts from $5,000 to
$7,500.
The bill will also index this new cap to inflation so
that the value of dependent care FSAs keeps up over time as the cost of
child care continues to increase.
Quite simply, this bill is one way to help
American families stretch their dollars further in meeting their dependent
care needs, whether it's for their kids or their elderly parents. The
cost of child care is increasing, and by increasing the amount Americans
can put into a dependent care FSA and indexing it to inflation, we
will help ensure that these accounts continue to be a meaningful option
for families. Read more about The Child and Dependent Care FSA
Enhancement Act

That same day, I also joined with a group of
bipartisan Senators to introduce legislation to reauthorize and improve
the Older Americans Act Act.
The Older Americans Act has been an important law to
millions of senior citizens. In addition to continuing programs like Meals
on Wheels, the bill we introduced this week aims to take additional
steps to protect vulnerable elders from abuse by increasing existing
abuse screening and prevention efforts. Read more about the Older
Americans Act

On Thursday, I, along with a bipartisan group of colleagues,
introduced Amendment 92 to permanently reauthorize the Land and Water
Conservation Fund (LWCF), which would fully realize LWCFs promise to conserve
parks, open spaces, and wildlife habitat for the benefit of hunting,
fishing, and outdoor recreation.
I have seen firsthand the role that the Land and Water Conservation
Fund plays in acquiring land and maintaining North Carolina's reputation
as one of the most scenic and unique states in the country. While our
efforts to fully fund LWCF are ongoing, todays amendment seeks to
simply reauthorize the program permanently and before it expires at the
end of this fiscal year. Our nations scenic treasures should not be
put into jeopardy on a yearly basis for a simple
reauthorization.
It should be noted that rather than
using taxpayer money, LWCF receives a small portion of the billions of
dollars in annual oil and gas royalties gained from exploration on
federally owned land and water. These funds ensure that there are parks,
open spaces, and wildlife habitats for hunting, fishing, and outdoor
recreation for future generations without adding to our debt. Read more

Speaking of amendments, in the past three weeks the new Republican
majority has voted on 25 amendments, 10 amendments more than what the
Democrat-led Senate allowed in the whole of last year. Check out this
graphic that the Senate GOP released:

Richard
