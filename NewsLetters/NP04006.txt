I hope that you and yours had a joyous, relaxing Thanksgiving. All Americans have much to be grateful for, especially our
troops away from their families so that we can be safe with ours.
As a Congressman, I am grateful every day to have the opportunity to assist local members of our Armed Forces and veterans
who need help cutting through government red tape. Recently, Parkville resident and retired Chief Master Sergeant Scott Wallace was one such constituent. Chief Wallace is a civil engineer who deployed with the Air National Guard to Forward Operating Base
Sharana , Afghanistan, for 6 months back in 2008. While there, he and the other members of his team earned Bronze Star Medals, which is the fourth-highest military award that recognizes acts of heroism or merit in a combat zone. But,
while every other member of his team received their medals upon their return home in 2009, Chief Wallace&#8217;s was lost in transit.
After 5 years of trying to get his medal, Chief Wallace connected with Gerald Connor, a top-notch caseworker in my Timonium
office. A veteran himself, Gerald quickly got on the case. Last month,
just one day before Veterans Day, I was honored to finally pin the Bronze Star Medal on Chief Wallace&#8217;s lapel. At last, his service, sacrifice &#8211; and extraordinary patience &#8211; received its
due recognition.
If you are or know of a veteran who lives in the Second District and could use our services, please remember that my door
is always open.
