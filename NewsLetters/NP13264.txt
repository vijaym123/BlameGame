Dear Friend,
Happy New Year! I hope you and your loved ones had a wonderful holiday
season and are looking forward to good things to come this year. You
can learn what I have done in the last few weeks and some information
about upcoming events below.

2014 District Issues Meeting
On Monday morning from 10 AM to 12 noon, I will host a public meeting
to discuss issues facing the Ninth District in my office in the
Clifford Davis/Odell Horton Federal Building at 167 North Main Street
(Suite 369). Hearing what Memphians have to say about the issues like
the Affordable Care Act and the economy helps me do a better job
representing the Ninth District in Washington. If you are able to make
it, I'd like to invite you to join me and my staff on Monday morning-all
you need to do to RSVP is give my Memphis office a call at (901)
544-4131. Please note that attendees are asked to enter from Front
Street.
Councilman Lowery's 23rd Annual Prayer Breakfast
On New Year's Day, I was glad to have the chance to speak to nearly 300
Memphians about my hopes for the coming year at City Councilman Myron
Lowery's 23rdannual prayer breakfast. After the partisan bickering of
the last year that ultimately led to a shutdown of the federal
government, I look forward to more of us in Congress finding a way to
work together to get things done, to help grow the economy, and to
fight for the middle class. One of the ways we can do that is by making
sure that everyone who works hard earns a decent, livable wage. I will
work with my colleagues to increase the minimum wage.
Restoring the Public's Faith in Our Elections
When the public doesn't have faith in the election process, that faith
needs to be restored-and that means replacing Shelby County elections
administrator Richard Holden. In his tenure as elections administrator,
he has made several "mistakes" including giving voters the wrong ballot
(that led to a race for school board being overturned), and was
recently suspended and placed on probation by a unanimous and
bipartisan vote of the Election Commission. It's time that the
Commission dismiss Holden and replace him with someone better suited to
the job-someone who the public can trust.
Protecting Americans from Harassment
There was a very powerful story
on the front page of yesterday's New York Times about the
predatory methods used by a company called Educational Credit
Management Corporation to recover student loan debt for the federal
government. The tactics they use on Americans who are just trying to
get by in difficult circumstances are shameful, and in some cases they
even border on abusive. I believe that people should pay the debts they
owe, but the federal government shouldn't be paying companies to harass
them when they can't. We simply have to hold them to a higher standard.
Helping Memphians Get Covered
All Memphians should have quality health insurance and the President's
landmark Affordable Care Act-also known as Obamacare-is making
affordable, higher-quality coverage available to people who have not
had access to it in the past. Luckily, many who have been unable to
afford quality coverage in the past are now eligible to enroll in
Tennessee's Health Insurance Marketplace
. Open enrollment for coverage in 2014 will continue until March
31st. And if you do not have health insurance coverage, you may also be
eligible to save money on your health care premiums
in the
Marketplace.
If you are on Medicare or your employer is going to offer qualified
health insurance next year that you will enroll in, you're already
covered and won't need to enter the Marketplace for your health
coverage. If you aren't sure whether or not you will need to use the
Marketplace to get insurance, call the Marketplace Hotline at
1-800-318-2596 or visit www.HealthCare.gov
. You can also call my office or the Marketplace Hotline to
find out if TennCare (Tennessee's Medicaid program) is a coverage
option for you. If you are one of the millions of Americans who need
health insurance, you can sign up
for coverage for 2014 until the open enrollment period
closes on March 31st, 2014. Visit www.healthcare.gov
today to look at your options.
The Affordable Care Act is already working for families across the
Ninth District and the recent government shutdown didn't change that.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 147,000
individuals in the district now have health insurance that covers
preventive services without co-pays, $3.1 million in insurance premiums
have been returned to consumers, and more than 5,000 seniors on
Medicare paid a total of $5.9 million less for their prescription
medications as we continue to close the 'donut hole.' Also, health
insurance companies can no longer discriminate against patients with
pre-existing conditions and young adults up to age 26 can now stay on
their parents' insurance plan.
Many of the Marketplace website issues that have been in the news
recently have been resolved. However, the Marketplace website is only
one tool that you can use to sign up for coverage. If you are having
trouble accessing the website, please do not hesitate to call the
Marketplace Hotline at 1 (800) 318-2596 or visit the Seedco Mid-South
office at 22 North Front Street (Suite 900) for in-person help. Seedco
can also be reached by phone at (901) 528-8341, and if you have any
other questions, you should feel free to call my office at (901)
544-4131.
Also, on January 20th, I will be celebrating Martin Luther King, Jr.'s
Day of Service by hosting an education and volunteer training event for
Memphians to learn more about the Affordable Care Act and help their
communities get enrolled and take advantage of the law's many benefits.
I hope you will join me and representatives from Seedco at the New
Olivet Baptist Church (3084 Southern Avenue) from 10 a.m. to noon on
the 20th to get trained as a volunteer so that you can help make
affordable healthcare a reality for more citizens of the Ninth
District! If you can make it, please RSVP to my Memphis office by
calling (901) 544-4131.
2014 U.S. Capitol Historical Society Calendars Are Available
My office currently has a limited number of 2014 U.S. Capitol
Historical Society calendars available. If you would like to receive a
calendar, please complete this short form on my website
. Due to the rules of
the House of Representatives, I am only able to mail calendars to
residents of Tennessee's Ninth District. Please feel free to share this
email with other citizens of the Ninth District who may be interested
in receiving one but who do not receive my eNewsletter.
White House Internships
The White House Internship Program is currently accepting applications
from young people who are interested in government and devoted to
public service. If you-or anyone you know-would like to spend some time
working at the White House, gaining valuable professional experience
and building leadership skills, I would like to take this opportunity
to urge you to apply. The application deadline is Sunday, January 5th,
2014. Click here
for more information.
Grant Announcements
I regularly release a list of grant announcements from federal agencies
like the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, and others. These
federal funding opportunities are available to faith-based and
neighborhood associations, nonprofits and other community organizations
in the 9th District. The announcements are updated regularly on my
website
.
As always, I remain.
Happy New Year,

Councilman
Lowery&#8217;s
23 rd
Annual
Prayer
Breakfast
On
New
Year&#8217;s
Day,
I
was
glad
to
have
the
chance
to
speak
to
nearly
300
Memphians
about
my
hopes
for
the
coming
year
at
City
Councilman
Myron
Lowery&#8217;s
23 rd annual
prayer
breakfast.
After
the
partisan
bickering
of
the
last
year
that
ultimately
led
to
a
shutdown
of
the
federal
government,
I
look
forward
to
more
of
us
in
Congress
finding
a
way
to
work
together
to
get
things
done,
to
help
grow
the
economy,
and
to
fight
for
the
middle
class.
One
of
the
ways
we
can
do
that
is
by
making
sure
that
everyone
who
works
hard
earns
a
decent,
livable
wage.
I
will
work
with
my
colleagues
to
increase
the
minimum
wage.
Restoring
the
Public&#8217;s
Faith
in
Our
Elections
When
the
public
doesn&#8217;t
have
faith
in
the
election
process,
that
faith
needs
to
be
restored&#8212;and
that
means
replacing
Shelby
County
elections
administrator
Richard
Holden.
In
his
tenure
as
elections
administrator,
he
has
made
several
&#8220;mistakes&#8221;
including
giving
voters
the
wrong
ballot
(that
led
to
a
race
for
school
board
being
overturned),
and
was
recently
suspended
and
placed
on
probation
by
a
unanimous
and
bipartisan
vote
of
the
Election
Commission.
It&#8217;s
time
that
the
Commission
dismiss
Holden
and
replace
him
with
someone
better
suited
to
the
job&#8212;someone
who
the
public
can
trust.
Protecting
Americans
from
Harassment
There
was
a
very
powerful
story
on
the
front
page
of
yesterday&#8217;s
New
York
Times
about
the
predatory
methods
used
by
a
company
called
Educational
Credit
Management
Corporation
to
recover
student
loan
debt
for
the
federal
government.
The
tactics
they
use
on
Americans
who
are
just
trying
to
get
by
in
difficult
circumstances
are
shameful,
and
in
some
cases
they
even
border
on
abusive.
I
believe
that
people
should
pay
the
debts
they
owe,
but
the
federal
government
shouldn&#8217;t
be
paying
companies
to
harass
them
when
they
can&#8217;t.
We
simply
have
to
hold
them
to
a
higher
standard.
Helping
Memphians
Get
Covered
All
Memphians
should
have
quality
health
insurance
and
the
President&#8217;s
landmark
Affordable
Care
Act&#8212;also
known
as
Obamacare&#8212;is
making
affordable,
higher-quality
coverage
available
to
people
who
have
not
had
access
to
it
in
the
past.
Luckily,
many
who
have
been
unable
to
afford
quality
coverage
in
the
past
are
now
eligible
to
enroll
in
Tennessee&#8217;s
Health
Insurance
Marketplace .
Open
enrollment
for
coverage
in
2014
will
continue
until
March
31st. And
if
you
do
not
have
health
insurance
coverage,
you
may
also
be
eligible
to
save
money
on
your
health
care
premiums
in
the
Marketplace.
If
you
are
on
Medicare
or
your
employer
is
going
to
offer
qualified
health
insurance
next
year
that
you
will
enroll
in,
you&#8217;re
already
covered
and
won&#8217;t
need
to
enter
the
Marketplace
for
your
health
coverage.
If
you
aren&#8217;t
sure
whether
or
not
you
will
need
to
use
the
Marketplace
to
get
insurance,
call
the
Marketplace
Hotline
at
1-800-318-2596
or
visit
www.HealthCare.gov .
You
can
also
call
my
office
or
the
Marketplace
Hotline
to
find
out
if
TennCare
(Tennessee&#8217;s
Medicaid
program)
is
a
coverage
option
for
you.
If
you
are
one
of
the
millions
of
Americans
who
need
health
insurance,
you
can
sign
up
for
coverage
for
2014
until
the
open
enrollment
period
closes
on
March
31st,
2014.
Visit
www.healthcare.gov
today
to
look
at
your
options.
The
Affordable
Care
Act
is
already
working
for
families
across
the
Ninth
District
and
the
recent
government
shutdown
didn&#8217;t
change
that.
According
to
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services,
147,000
individuals
in
the
district
now
have
health
insurance
that
covers
preventive
services
without
co-pays,
$3.1
million
in
insurance
premiums
have
been
returned
to
consumers,
and
more
than
5,000
seniors
on
Medicare
paid
a
total
of
$5.9
million
less
for
their
prescription
medications
as
we
continue
to
close
the
&#8216;donut
hole.&#8217;
Also,
health
insurance
companies
can
no
longer
discriminate
against
patients
with
pre-existing
conditions
and
young
adults
up
to
age
26
can
now
stay
on
their
parents&#8217;
insurance
plan.
Many
of
the
Marketplace
website
issues
that
have
been
in
the
news
recently
have
been
resolved. However,
the
Marketplace
website
is
only
one
tool
that
you
can
use
to
sign
up
for
coverage.
If
you
are
having
trouble
accessing
the
website,
please
do
not

to

the
Marketplace

Also,
on
January
20th,
I
