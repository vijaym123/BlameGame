Dear Friends,
Recently, I had the opportunity to participate in the Delaware
Principal for a Day program at Lake Forest Central Elementary in
Felton. This Kent County school is led by Principal Bridget Amory and
for a few hours one morning, I was her shadow.
The Delaware Principal for a Day program began in 1993 by the Delaware
State Chamber of Commerce,
and it connects business and community leaders with Delaware school
principals. The goal is to help us all better understand how to educate
our future workforce. This year, more than 100 schools opened their
doors to host a guest principal.
Principal Amory led me through her 4th and 5th grade school, where I
observed teacher meetings, met with a few parents, visited classrooms
and even stepped behind the counter of the school cafeteria to see how
the staff incorporates local fresh fruits and vegetables into
their daily menu.
The 600 students at Lake Forest Central are lucky to have Principal
Amory leading their school. At the end of the day, I went back to my
job and she to hers, and I had a greater appreciation for the hard work
that goes into educating our students.
Always learning,
