Friend,
I can&#39;t thank you enough. Your generosity helped my campaign raise over $10,000 in honor of my 49th birthday. I am humbled.
I had a wonderful time celebrating my birthday with family and friends, and I look forward to everything that the coming year will bring, even though they tell me I&#39;m turning 50 at the end of it.
The fact that you honored my birthday in this way means a lot, and I&#39;m energized by your support.
Thanks again.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
