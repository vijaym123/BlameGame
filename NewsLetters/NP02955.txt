Celebrating the 104th Birthday of
President Reagan
2/6/15
Congressman Doug Lamborn as
released a statement commemorating the 104th birthday of President Ronald
Reagan.
"President Reagan
remains an awe-inspiring and influential figure in American life. His
exemplary leadership skills and his peerless ability to communicate a
positive vision for our nation continue to inspire millions of Americans
to serve their country in ways both large and small. His policies on
everything from taxes to national security shape and guide the
national conversation to this day. President Reagan is my personal hero and I
know that I join millions of Americans in reflecting fondly off him
on this, the 104th anniversary of his
birth."
