Rubio, Petri Legislation Would Give
Students Access To Innovative College
Financing Option
On Wednesday, Marco and U.S.
Representative Tom Petri (R-WI) introduced
legislation to expand access to a new and
innovative private financing option to help
students to pay for postsecondary
education.
The bill, entitled the Investing in
Student Success Act, would create a legal
framework where individuals or
organizations can provide students with
money for school in exchange for the
student agreeing to make payments linked to
their income for a set period of time after
graduation.Students would have no
loan balance to repay, so some students
might end up paying less than the amount
given to them and others more.These
plans would serve as an alternative to
student loans.
In the 21st century, higher
education is no longer an option for
Americans, it has become a necessity. But
a complex and confusing student loan
system makes it increasingly difficult
for millions of people trying to meet the
challenges of our economy,
Rubio said . Allowing
private investment groups to invest
directly in an individual student is an
alternative to student loans that helps
make higher education more affordable and
more accessible.
By clarifying the lawfulness of
income share agreements, this bill
incentivizes the free enterprise system
and allows people to access the skills
needed to take advantage of the
opportunities created by the free
market,
added Rubio . Fostering more
choice for students to fund their
education guarantees opportunity and
equips people with the tools needed to
achieve the American Dream.
Marco pushed the legislation on
CNBCs
Squawk
on the Street .
Marco and Representative Petri also
wrote an op-ed on their vision for
reforming student loans on
CNBC.com .
Rubio Calls On Kerry To Provide
Administrations Full Assessment Of
Venezuela Crisis
Marco, a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, called on Secretary of
State John Kerry to provide Congress and
the American people a full assessment of
the political, economic, and security
crisis provoked by the incompetence of the
Nicols Maduro regime in
Venezuela.
In
a
letter to Kerry , Rubio asked the
administration to provide answers and
information regarding the violent
repression of Venezuelan demonstrators, the
Cuban regimes involvement, the
independence of Venezuelas
government institutions, and the Venezuelan
National Guards links to drug
trafficking operations, among other
topics.
Rubio: [I]t is more important
than ever for the American public and
lawmakers to clearly understand the
nature of the situation in Venezuela and
its repercussions for American interests
and the Western Hemisphere.
It is
vital that the U.S. government stand with
those Venezuelans who have bravely called
out the brutality and dishonesty of the
Maduro government.
Marco questioned Kerry on issues
involving Venezuela and Cuba during a
Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Watch
the exchange
here .
He also met with
Foreign
Minister of Panama
Francisco
lvarez de Soto on Tuesday evening to
discuss the ongoing political crisis in
Venezuela, its negative consequences for
the hemisphere, and Panamas efforts
to ensure that inclusive organizations,
such as the Organization of American
States, continue to be the
hemispheres main forum to address
issues of regional interest.
Commerce Committee Approves Rubio
Commercial Space Industry Bill To
Encourage Innovation
On Wednesday, the Senate Committee on
Commerce, Science, and Transportation
approved
S.
2140 , legislation which would fix
outdated laws to allow for more advancement
in the commercial spaceflight industry. The
legislation, introduced by U.S. Senators
Marco Rubio (R-FL), Martin Heinrich (D-NM),
and Tom Udall (D-NM) last month, changes
current laws that are slowing development
and progress for the reusable launch
vehicle industry to ensure space companies
can continue to test and innovate their
vehicles.
Todays vote reaffirms
that encouraging innovation is key to
America achieving its potential in the 21
st
century,
said Senator Rubio .
Innovative industries like
commercial spaceflight are advancing
rapidly, and we cant allow
outdated laws to stifle progress.
Unfortunately thats exactly
whats happening.
These laws did not anticipate
what commercial companies are now doing
with vehicle testing and commercial
spaceflights, and therefore have caused
progress to slow,
added Rubio . Thats
why we need this bill to help update and
streamline federal laws so they are more
in line with todays commercial
spaceflight operations and can allow for
this cutting edge industry to thrive.
Removing outdated, burdensome federal
laws will not only allow for further
advancement in commercial spaceflights,
but also encourage more innovation, job
creation, and economic growth.
Rubio: U.S. Should Do More To Promote
Internet Freedom In Cuba
Marco, a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, highlighted the
importance of Internet freedom in Cuba,
defending the United States Agency for
International Developments (USAID)
role in ZunZuneo, a social media network
created for the Cuban people. During a
Committee hearing, Rubio questioned Rajiv
Shah, the Administrator of the USAID, and
stressed the need for programs that promote
democracy, human rights and other goals of
U.S. foreign policy.
Rubio: What do we need to do to
start, not just this program, but expand
it, so that people in Cuba can do what I
just did? And that is speak freely to the
world, and to each other, about the
reality of Cuban life, and about anything
else they want
During
the
hearing , Rubio illustrated the
importance of freedom of speech in the 21
st
century by live-tweeting,
demonstrating a basic freedom that is not
allowed in Cuba and would result in
imprisonment. Rubios tweet is

Constituent Casework Corner
Maria is a resident of South Florida and
her son, Cristian, was recently admitted to
the hospital and diagnosed with cancer. Her
other son, Juan, lives in Cuba and applied
for his visa, but was still pending
approval. Maria contacted Senator
Rubios office for assistance. A
member of the staff reached out to the U.S.
Interests Section in Havana, Cuba to
request an expeditious review of the
application. The family supplied a letter
from the hospital to prove the urgent
medical situation and Juan was subsequently
issued the visa.
