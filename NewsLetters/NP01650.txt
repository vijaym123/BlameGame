Dear
Friend,
I hope that you enjoyed restful and inspirational Easter
weekend with family and loved ones. During this District Work Period,
I was able to make stops in Teller, Chaffee, Fremont, and El Paso
Counties. As I made my way around the District, I reflected on what a
beautiful and special place we live in, filled with people who are
committed to making our region the best place to live in
America.
My staff and I remain dedicated to providing
you with the best, most responsive service possible. You deserve
nothing less.
Please let me know if you
require any assistance with a federal government agency by contacting my
local office at (719) 520-0055.
I am honored to
serve as your Representative in
Washington.
Sincerely,
Panning for Gold with constituent Randy Witham in Buena
Vista
APRIL DISTRICT WORK

Thank you to Dee Sabol and the entire team at Library 21c
in Colorado Springs for putting on a top-notch Congressional Art
Competition and for running such a world class facility. I appreciated

I enjoyed meeting with constituents in Teller
and Chaffee counties. Of particular note was the time I spent meeting
with Brett Mitchell. We discussed the need to protect existing water
and grazing rights and to ensure local and state involvement in
developing the management plan for Browns Canyon. All items that are up in the
air since the President circumvented an open and public process.
Next up, I joined Randy Witham to experience a small example of his
business Gold Adventures, LLC. My staff and I were able to sample the
experience that he offers in Buena
Vista.
Thank you to Broadmoor Chairman
Steve Bartolin and President and CEO Jack Damioli for the tour of the
Broadmoor's new property The Ranch at Emerald Valley. This
breathtaking setting is another example of why the Broadmoor is a premier
destination, not just in the Fifth Congressional District, but in the entire
nation.
Thank you to
the team at Harris Corporation in Colorado Springs for the informative
briefing and tour. Harris is an international IT and communications
company serving government and commercial contracts in over 100
countries.
I enjoyed my visit out to Schriever Air Force Base to
see TENCAP (Tactical Exploration of National Capabilities) and the 527th
Space Aggressor Squadron. [insert

It was a pleasure
joining KVOR's Richard
Randall for our monthly interview. We
discussed multiple topics including the
budget, illegal
immigration, standing with Israel, and
more.

LEGISLATIVE
UPDATE
I
introduced H.R. 1649, The Partnering to Detect and Defeat Tunnels Act.
This legislation is designed to bring high-level leadership and
resources to address a problem facing America and
Israel.
We must be able to defend against illicit
tunnels, whether on our southern border today or against terrorist attacks
in the future. The terrorist group Hamas used tunnels against Israel
to devastating effect; we have already seen rebels using tunnels
against the Syrian regime. Sadly we know that terrorists are quick to
learn, so it is likely only a matter of time before we see a terrorist
group attack a U.S. or allied facility with tunnels. Detecting and
defeating tunnels is not an easy task. That's why the government has
already established an interagency tunnel working group and I am hopeful
that my bill will aid in their efforts to protect ourselves and our
allies.
What this bill does
1.
Directs the Secretary of
Defense to enter into a partnership agreement with Israel to develop
technology to detect and counter tunnels.
2.
Allows the Secretary of
Defense to enter into similar partnerships with other allied
countries.
3.
Requires the designation of a lead federal agency for the
development of tunnel detection technology.
4.
Requires the designation of a
lead intelligence officer for tactical tunnels.
5.
Requires an annual
report to Congress on tunnel threat proliferation.
6.
Doubles current
funding for existing U.S. government tunnel detection efforts (the Army
Corps of Engineers and the Combating Terrorism Technical Support
Office)
I partnered with Senator Cory Gardner and
Congressman Mike Coffman (CO-06) on the VA Hospital Construction,
Accountability, and Reform Act. This legislation is designed to address the
failures plaguing the construction of a new VA Hospital in Aurora,
Colorado.
The Colorado
Congressional Delegation is deeply troubled by the mismanagement and waste
that has gone on during the VA Hospital fiasco. We are dedicated to
finding solutions that bring this much needed resource to completion.
That's why I'm pleased to partner with Senator Gardner and Congressman
Coffman on good legislation designed to move beyond the failures of the
past on put us on the pathway to state of the art healthcare for the
brave veterans who have earned this
benefit.
Legislative
Information
Increases the cap on the Aurora, Colorado VA replacement medical
facility.
This measure would prevent another abrupt work stoppage
which will add as much as $100M to the final cost.
The authorized
spending cap on the project will be reached in
mid-May.
Prohibits VA from awarding any bonuses
until the project is completed.
This measure offers enough
funding to offset the budget should supplemental appropriations be
necessary.
Additionally, freeing up these funds would enable the VA to
fund the hospital without seeking substantial reprogramming from other
construction projects, a move that could delay hospital construction in
other states.
Strips
VAs authority to build medical facilities costing more than $10
million.
The VA will never again be placed in a position to waste over
$1 billion of Americans tax dollars on a mismanaged construction
project ever again.
Moreover, the Associated General Contractors of
America recently announced their position that VAs construction
program should be moved to a more capable federal
agency.
Requires the GAO to review VAs internal
Administrative Investigation Board on the project for thoroughness and
accuracy. The review will also look into when senior VA officials knew
about the substantial cost overruns and why that information was
withheld from
Congress.
I joined my Congressional
colleagues in expressing our sincere disappointment with the recent
actions of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee
(DGAC).
Rather than sticking to the
science and preparing recommendations designed to educate the American
people on the variety of foods available in our nation, the DGAC has
instead decided to take an ill-advised foray into a kind of social
engineering. The American people must have the freedom to make their own
dietary decisions. We do not need the heavy hand of government
attempting to centrally plan the types of food we can or cannot eat. This
report is so far off base that it even contradicts years of scientific
research on the health benefits of lean beef. I join my colleagues in
strongly urging the Agriculture and Health and Human Services Departments
to revisit this DGAC
report.

Let's get him back to a leadership roll with an extra
rank with a letter of apology. and whatever commander tried to do this to
him needs to be relieved of command. He/She is not fit for command
for not sticking up for their own.

So, let me get this
straight... A chaplain is being threatened with discharge for
advocating the beliefs of his religion? Makes me wonder what the point is of
even having chaplains if that's not
acceptable.
