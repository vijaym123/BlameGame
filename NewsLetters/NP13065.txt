Good afternoon! I wanted to touch base with you today, as the
House just passed bipartisan legislation to fully fund the government
through FY2014. While the bill is not perfect, I supported it because
the agreement finally begins the process of prioritizing how our tax
dollars are spent.
I would have liked to see an even smaller budget number with more
reforms, but the bill still cuts spending for the fourth year in a row,
which hasn't happened since the Korean War. Additionally, it reduces
funding to the lowest point since President Obama took office.
In total, the bill reduces discretionary spending by more than $21
billion from last year's levels. Even with the savings, many provisions
important to South Dakota were prioritized, including funding for Lewis
& Clark in the southeastern part of the state and the Sanford
Underground Research Facility in Lead. Additionally, it includes an
impact aid provision, which helps school districts like
Mobridge-Pollock that have been consolidated.
As I said before, this bill doesn't make as much progress as me and
many members in the House would have liked, but all-in-all, I believe
that passing the agreement was good for South Dakota.
If you have any other questions about this bill, please don't hesitate
to reach out to my office. Have a wonderful rest of the week.

Good
afternoon!
I
wanted
to
touch
base
with
you
today,
as
the
House
just
passed
bipartisan
legislation
to
fully
fund
the
government
through
FY2014.
While
the
bill
is
not
perfect,
I
supported
it
because
the
agreement
finally
begins
the
process
of
prioritizing
how
our
tax
dollars
are
spent.
I
would
have
liked
to
see
an
even
smaller
budget
number
with
more
reforms,
but
the
bill
still
cuts
spending
for
the
fourth
year
in
a
row,
which
hasn&#8217;t
happened
since
the
Korean
War.
Additionally,
it
reduces
funding
to
the
lowest
point
since
President
Obama
took
office.
In
total,
the
bill
reduces
discretionary
spending
by
more
than
$21
billion
from
last
year&#8217;s
levels.
Even
with
the
savings,
many
provisions
important
to
South
Dakota
were
prioritized,
including
funding
for
Lewis

in
the

Additionally,
it
includes
an

which

Have
