Friend -- Nate Silver reports the Senate is still ANYONE&rsquo;S to take.
If Democrats win, Silver predicts a scenario &ldquo;where they win squeakers in a number of the closest races and Republicans fall just short of a majority.&rdquo;
YOU are increasing our chances to win: With 2 hours left until the final end-of-month deadline of the election,
we could have our first one million dollar grassroots fundraising day in history.
That&rsquo;s absolutely REMARKABLE!
First thing tomorrow, every cent of that cash will be sent DIRECTLY to deadlocked battlegrounds for our Final Weekend Get Out The Vote Push.
This plan will be absolutely crucial to our victory, and we&rsquo;re SO SO close to hitting $1 million and fully funding it.
We&rsquo;re just $42,000 short.
