Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
I hope you are enjoying this lovely spring weather! As I travel across
the Sixth District to meet with constituents, I am continually blown
away by the beauty of central and eastern Kentucky. We are truly
blessed!
Announcing the Winner of the Congressional Art Competition
On Thursday evening, I was glad to announce that Bryan Station High
School student Salvador Hernandez was the winner of the 2014
Congressional Art Competition, An Artistic Discovery, for Kentucky's
Sixth Congressional District. His winning photography piece, "Colors in
Ice," will be displayed in the halls of the United States Capitol along
with winning art from other congressional districts across the country
for the next year.
I am honored to highlight all of our students' artistic work through
this year's Artistic Discovery art competition. This year's submissions
reflect the unbelievable talent of the students in the Sixth District.
Congratulations to all the students who participated and thank you to
the Living Arts & Science Center for their help with the competition.
Last year, Gabriel M. Baczkowski's piece, "Atticus," was selected to
represent the Sixth District.
Each time I walk past Gabe's artwork on my way to vote in the Capitol,
I am reminded of the creativity and skill that Kentucky's young artists
possess. It is always a point of pride to show visitors the winning
piece from my district. "Colors in Ice" will be a welcome addition to
the halls of the Capitol, and I look forward to hosting Salvador in
Washington, D.C. for the national reception.
I was once again pleased to work with Heather Lyons and her team at the
Living Arts & Science Center (LASC). Thank you to LASC Gallery Director
and nationally recognized artist, Jeffrey Nichols, and LASC Art
Education Coordinator Sarah Campbell for serving as judges for the
competition.

Casework Corner: Ensuring the IRS Meets Obligations to Constituents
Recently, my office was contacted by a constituent from Scott County
who was having trouble with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Over a
year after filing the proper paperwork, the IRS had failed to issue a
refund owed to the constituent. The constituent contacted the IRS
multiple times with no response.
After making an inquiry with the IRS, my office was able to
successfully facilitate payment of the refund, as well as interest owed
to the constituent for the failure to process the return on time.
If you are having trouble with a federal agency, please contact my
Lexington office at (859) 219-1366, as we may be able to provide
assistance!
Meeting with the Sixth District Agriculture Coalition to Promote
Kentucky's Signature Industry
As part of my ongoing effort to ensure that our agricultural
communities are represented in Congress, on Tuesday, I hosted a meeting
of the Sixth District Agriculture Coalition in Bourbon County.
I appreciate so many people taking the time out of their busy schedule
to attend. Special thanks to the members of the Nicholas County Future
Farmers of America who joined us for the meeting!
These meetings are important opportunity to hear directly from
Kentucky's agriculture community and discuss solutions to the issues
facing the farmers of central and eastern Kentucky. I also appreciated
the chance to update the coalition on my work to promote our signature
agriculture industry at the federal level.
Around the District
On Tuesday I met with Terence Clemons and the Wildcat Leadership
Council, students from Bath County High School who were selected to be
a part of a new leadership program currently being piloted in Bath
County. This program is designed to guide young people through the
intricacies of local and state government and introduce them to the
importance of entrepreneurship to their local economy. I was inspired
by their energy and commitment to promoting youth civic engagement and
enjoyed hearing about their ideas for a brighter future.
Thank you to the Anderson County Rotary Club for inviting me to join
them for their meeting Thursday in Lawrenceburg. It is always great to
discuss the important issues facing local business and ways we can
improve our communities.
I greatly enjoyed my afternoon with Austin Simms, the team at the
Lexington Housing Authority and community partners. They did an
excellent job of showing me the various housing options for low-income
families in Lexington.
During our tour, the team and I discussed a variety of topics including
the prioritization of affordable housing dollars, tax credits, the role
that public housing plays in providing upward mobility to individuals,
and innovative programs like Moving to Work (MTW). MTW is a
demonstration program for public housing authorities that provides them
the opportunity to design and test innovative, locally-designed
strategies that use federal dollars more efficiently, help residents
find employment and become self-sufficient, and increase housing
choices for low-income families.
On Friday, I was honored to participate in the groundbreaking ceremony
to celebrate a new location for Bevins Motor Company in Georgetown.
Bevins Motor Company has been a family owned business and fixture in
Scott County since 1946. The region will benefit greatly from its new
location expected to open later this year and I was honored to attend
the groundbreaking.
On Tuesday, I joined community leaders in Menifee and Montgomery
Counties for the Gateway Area Development District board meeting. I was
glad to hear the news that there will be an additional 60 jobs at
Custom Foods in Bath County.
Thanks to the realty team at Sotheby's for having me on Tuesday. We had
a great discussion and I enjoyed hearing their insights about improving
the housing market in Lexington.
Signature Industry Spotlight: Growing Kentucky Proud "Farm to Campus"
Program
I was glad to join Agriculture Commissioner Jamie Comer to welcome
Georgetown College to the Kentucky Proud Farm to Campus Program on
Friday.
As I travel across central and eastern Kentucky and meet with members
of my Agriculture Coalition, it is clear that the farm-to-table
movement is alive and well. I commend Georgetown College President Dr.
Dwaine Greene and Board of Trustees Chair Mr. Earl Goode for
recognizing the importance of this Kentucky Proud program and the
benefits it provides not only to our local farmers, but the students
across campus who will receive food that's fresher, healthier, and
grown in their own backyard.
Under the Farm to Campus program, the Kentucky Department of
Agriculture will partner with the college and Sodexo to put more
farm-fresh Kentucky Proud products in the college's food service
system.
The addition of the Farm to Campus program reiterates Georgetown
College's commitment to providing the very best campus life experience
possible. I am glad to see another college campus choosing to
"buy-local" and look forward to seeing this great partnership grow.
Please continue to let me know your thoughts and concerns about issues
facing our community, and I hope you will forward my weekly newsletter
to your friends, family and neighbors.
You may also visit my website, Facebook and Twitter, where you can find
regular updates about my work at home in the Sixth District and in
Washington.
Thank you and have a great week!
Sincerely,

As
part

on
Tuesday,
I
hosted
a

I
appreciate
so

Special
thanks
to
the

to
the
issues

Around
the
District
On
Tuesday
I
met
with
Terence
Clemons
and
the
Wildcat
Leadership
Council,
students
from
Bath
County
High
School
who
were
selected
to
be
a
part
of
a
new
leadership
program
currently
being
piloted
in
Bath
County.
This
program
is
designed
to
guide
young
people
through
the
intricacies
of
local
and
state
government
and
introduce
them
to
the
importance
of
entrepreneurship
to
their
local
economy.
I
was
inspired
by
their
energy
and
commitment
to
promoting
youth
civic
engagement
and
enjoyed
hearing
about
their
ideas
for
a
brighter
future.
Thank
you
to
the
Anderson
County
Rotary
Club
for
inviting
me
to
join
them
for
their
meeting
Thursday
in
Lawrenceburg.
It
is
always
great
to
discuss
the
important
issues
facing
local
business
and
ways
we
can
improve
our
communities.
I
greatly
enjoyed
my
afternoon
with
Austin
Simms,
the
team
at
the
Lexington
Housing
Authority
and
community
partners.
They
did
an
excellent
job
of
showing
me
the
various
housing
options
for
low-income
families
in
Lexington.
During
our
tour,
the
team
and
I
discussed
a
variety
of
topics
including
the
prioritization
of
affordable
housing
dollars,
tax
credits,
the
role
that
public
housing
plays
in
providing
upward
mobility
to
individuals,
and
innovative
programs
like
Moving
to
Work
(MTW).
MTW
is
a
demonstration
program
for
public
housing
authorities
that
provides
them
the
opportunity
to
design
and
test
innovative,
locally-designed
strategies
that
use
federal
dollars
more
efficiently,
help
residents
find
employment
and
become
self-sufficient,
and
increase
housing
choices
f or
low-incom e
families.
On
Friday,
I
was
honored
to
participate
in
the
groundbreaking
ceremony
to
celebrate
a
new
location
for
Bevins
Motor
Com pany
in
Georgetown.
Bevins
Motor

been
a

and
fixture
in
Scott
County
since
1946.
The
region
will
benefit
greatly
from
its
new
location
expected
to
open
later
this
year
and
I
was
honored
to
attend
the
groundbreaking.
On
Tuesday,
I
joined
community
leaders
in
Menifee
and
Montgomery
Counties
for
the
Gateway
Area

m eeting.
I
was
glad
to
hear
the
