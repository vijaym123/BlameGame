Our District
Resources
Dear Friend,
It was a busy week this past week in Arizona and throughout our nation.
The House of Representatives was in recess for a district work week
which meant I got to travel all around District 4 and meet with
constituents. It is always a pleasure to spend more time in our great
communities.
Illegal Alien Smuggling by Obama Administration
However, the enjoyment of being home quickly faded when I learned that
the Obama Administration has been implementing a policy where illegal
aliens apprehended in Texas are being shipped by plane or bus to
Arizona utilizing taxpayer money. Officials from DHS confirmed in a
briefing with my staff this week that at least 7 flights transporting
illegal aliens to other states have already occurred at a price of
$53,000 per flight.
These illegal aliens are then dumped at Arizona bus stations in 100
degree heat, and in some cases with no food or water. Flooding our
streets with illegal aliens who are being abandoned without resources
is not just inhumane and cruel, it is a crime and federal law bans
alien smuggling. To make matters worse, when this Administration
decided to dump these illegal immigrants in Arizona communities, they
failed to notify the Arizona Governor's office, the Arizona Department
of Public Safety and the Arizona Department of Homeland Security of
this new policy.
President Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder and the Department of
Homeland Security have crossed a line that a Constitutional Republic
must not tolerate. This Administration is now facilitating the inhumane
smuggling of illegal aliens from Texas to Arizona.
This is the most lawless administration in the history of this great
country and Eric Holder should have resigned or been fired a long time
ago.
Impeachment Proceedings for Attorney General Eric Holder
While it is hard to discern which of Eric Holders previous trespasses
are most egregious, this is one scandal for which he cannot retain his
job. It starts at the top with Eric Holder and if the chief law
enforcement officer of the United States is not going to enforce the
laws of this land, then he should be impeached.
I went on America's Newsroom on Tuesday to discuss this issue. You can
watch a video of that interview HERE
.
Additionally, this past Monday I sent a letter to the House Oversight
and Government Reform Committee Chairman and Ranking Member requesting
an official investigation into this issue. As a member of that
Committee, I plan on taking a lead role in seeking accountability for
those individuals responsible for this violation of the Rule of Law,
should the Committee favorably respond to my request. You can read that
letter HERE
.
Joint Field Hearing on EPA Water Rule
On Monday, I was proud to host a joint field hearing with some of my
House colleagues at the Arizona State Capitol on the proposed EPA rule
for expanding the definition of navigable waters in the United States.
Resounding testimony from Arizona witnesses confirmed that the EPA's
proposed water grab runs contrary to state and tribal water laws and
would have devastating economic consequences for farmers, ranchers,
small businesses, and water users in Arizona and throughout the
country.
Arizonans can't afford more economic hurdles and thieveries of precious
water supplies from an overzealous, unaccountable federal government
operating in hyper mode.
(Rep. Gosar, second from the left, with other leaders of the EPA Joint
Field Hearing)
(Audience members looking on at the EPA Joint Field Hearing)
Stefanie Smallhouse, testifying on behalf of the of the Arizona Farm
Bureau probably said it best:
"The newly proposed EPA rule for the Waters of the U.S. would be
devastating to my family's farming operation, as well as hundreds of
others in agriculture in Arizona.This proposed rule is an economic
disaster, and a dream killer for my kids. There is no way a family farm
such as ours would be able to withstand the hefty fines which would be
enforced as a result of this rule."
I want to thank everyone who came out and participated in making this
event possible. You can read more about the proposed water rule HERE
and the corresponding study
released with the rule HERE
.
You can watch the testimony from the 1st half of the field hearing HERE

New EPA Proposed Mandate for Existing Power Plants
Does it feel like there is a common theme here?
On Monday the Obama Administration announced new regulations from the
EPA with a goal of reducing carbon emissions over the next 15 years.
The new regulations impose significant restrictions on power plants
already in existence, including natural gas plants.
The President continues to unlawfully direct the EPA to impose strict
limits on coal plants in order to appease environmental extremists
within his own party. Congress has repeatedly rejected previous
cap-and-tax energy plans proposed by the President and his
big-government allies. Knowing he can't lawfully enact a carbon-dioxide
tax plan, President Obama has chosen to circumvent Congress and impose
these new regulations by executive fiat. Congress, not EPA bureaucrats
at the behest of the President, should dictate our country's climate
change policy.
The bottom line is that this new rule will kill good-paying jobs in
rural communities throughout the country. In Arizona, this proposal
will likely force the Navajo Generating Station to close its doors,
which will mean the permanent loss of nearly a 1,000 good-paying jobs.
I will continue to fight for jobs, oppose this overreach and be a voice
of reason for the American people.

Meeting with Acting Veterans Affairs Secretary Sloan Gibson
On Thursday, Representatives Salmon, Sinema, and I met with Acting
Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Sloan Gibson, to discuss ongoing issues
within the Department of Veterans Affairs. Our conversation was
constructive and I am hopeful that future actions will make vast
improvements to the current processes. I urged the Acting Secretary to
make immediate reforms such as contracting with non-VA health care
providers in order to get the necessary care to Veterans waiting for
treatment. Additionally, I stressed the importance of reforming the
performance pay system for VA employees so that bureaucrats are not
rewarded for failed performances.

Congress will take immediate steps to oversee reforms and work with
Acting Secretary Gibson in doing so. But the government must listen
first, and then act. It must not dictate to those who have already
given so much only to later suffer so much at the hand of the very
government they served.
Government Waste - Fact of the Week:
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is spending almost $200,000 to
study how transgender women use social media such as Facebook to
determine how their use affects their chances of contracting HIV.
Congressional District 4: Did You Know?
Arizona is known as the Copper State as more than 60 percent of
domestic copper is produced in Arizona. While that is good news, the
U.S. still imports more than 30% of our copper.
If enacted, my
Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act would make us less
dependent on foreign countries for our mineral resources and the
Superior mine alone should meet 25% of current U.S. copper demand.

Dear
Friend,
It
was
a
busy
week
this
past
week
in
Arizona
and
throughout
our
nation.
The
House
of
Representatives
was
in
recess
for
a
district
work
week
which
meant
I
got
to
travel
all
around
District

and
meet
with
constituents.
It
is

Illegal
Alien

Obama
Administration
However,
the
enjoyment
of
being
home
quickly
faded
when
I
learned
that
the
Obama

has
been
implementing
a
policy
where
illegal

apprehended
in
Texas
are
being
shipped
by
plane
or

Officials
from
DHS
confirmed
in
a

with
my
staff
this
week
that
at
least
7
flights
transporting
illegal

to
other
states
have
already
occurred
at
a
price
of
$53,000
per
flight.
These
illegal

are
then
dumped
at
Arizona
bus

in
100

and
in
some

Flooding

is
not
just
inhumane
and
cruel,
it
is

To
make
matters
worse,
when
this

decided
to

in
Arizona
communities,
they
failed
to
notify
the
Arizona
Governor's
office,
the
Arizona
Department
of
Public

and
the
Arizona
Department
of
Homeland
Security
of
this
new
policy.
President
Obama,
Attorney
General
Eric
Holder
and
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
have
crossed
a
line
that
a

This

is
now

This
is
the

and
Eric
Holder
should
have
resigned
or
been
fired
a

it

which

most
egregious,
this
is
one
scandal
for
which
he
cannot

It
starts
at

officer
of

not

then
he
should

New
EPA
Proposed
Mandate
for
Existing
Power
Plants
Does
it
feel
like
there
is
a
common
theme
here?
On
Monday
the
Obama
Administration
announced
new
regulations
from
the
EPA
with
a
goal
of
reducing
carbon
emissions
over
the
next
15
years.
The
new
regulations
impose
significant
restrictions
on
power
plants
already
in
existence,
including
natural
gas
plants.
The
President
continues
to
unlawfully
direct
the
EPA
to
impose
strict
limits
on
coal
plants
in
order
to
appease
environmental
extremists
within
his
own
party.
Congress
has
repeatedly
rejected
previous
cap-and-tax
energy
plans
proposed
by
the
President
and
his
big-government
allies.
Knowing
he
can&#8217;t
lawfully
enact
a
carbon-dioxide
tax
plan,
President
Obama
has
chosen
to
circumvent
Congress
and
impose
these
new
regulations
by
executive
fiat.
Congress,
not
EPA
bureaucrats
at
the
behest
of
the
President,
should
dictate
our
country&#8217;s
climate
change
policy.
The
bottom
line
is
that
this
new
rule
will
kill
good-paying
jobs
in
rural
communities
throughout
the
country.
In
Arizona,
this
proposal
will
likely
force
the
Navajo
Generating
Station
to
close
its
doors,
which
will
mean
the
permanent
loss
of
nearly
a
1,000
good-paying
jobs.
I
will
continue
to
fight
for
jobs,
oppose
this
overreach
and
be
a
voice
of
reason
for
the
American
people.

Congress
