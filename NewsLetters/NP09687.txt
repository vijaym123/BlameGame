This week, I held a news conference in Manchester at Mussers Farm and Pond with the National Federation of Independent Business Pennsylvania Chapter, the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau and the Pennsylvania Builders Association to address concerns about the EPAs attempt to expand its authority under the Clean Water Act. The EPA currently has jurisdiction over navigable waters. A new proposed rule, introduced in April, would extend its authority to include man-made ditches, farm ponds, irrigation streams, and even areas that collect water for only few days a year
such as your backyard.
Speaking at press conference about an unnecessary proposed EPA rule
I recently took part in a House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee field hearing in Altoona to question the EPAs attempt to dramatically expand the definition of navigable waters.
We can find common sense ways to protect our environment and waterways without unnecessarily expanding the reach of the federal government. Government regulations cost the average American family more than $15,000 each year and Im concerned this proposal will just add to those costs.
This week I also honored to meet with over one hundred students and family members at my annual U.S. Service Academy Night in Dallastown. At the event, students had the opportunity to review the application process for each military academy and discuss the educational opportunities the academies offer. They also learned about the application process for a Congressional Nomination for an academy appointment.

Sincerely,
Scott G. Perry
