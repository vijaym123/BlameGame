Dear David,
Over the last few months, I&rsquo;ve
heard from many folks
in Northwest Washington who have benefitted from the Affordable Care Act. Several people have found better coverage at a lower price through Washington Healthplanfinder. Others with preexisting conditions are able to get quality coverage to help manage chronic conditions. And some younger residents have been able to stay on their parents&rsquo; insurance for a bit longer.
Nearly half a million people in Washington state have signed up for health insurance, many of them for the first time in years, or ever. Thousands of families can breathe easier now knowing they have insurance that covers preventive care like check-ups and cancer screenings without co-pays or coinsurance. Not familiar with these new health care opportunities? Check out this short video:
Open enrollment ends on March 31, so don&rsquo;t delay signing up for coverage.
Visit

to find and compare health plans, see if you&rsquo;re eligible for help with your premiums, and apply for coverage.
