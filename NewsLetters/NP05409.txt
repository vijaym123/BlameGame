Port of Savannah
This past
Wednesday, an
agreement was signed
by Governor
Deal and local officials that paves the way for the Savannah Harbor
Expansion Project. After years, the Port of Savannah deepening will now
move ahead and construction can begin
shortly.
The Port of Savannah is a vital part of our state's
economy. That is why I have worked alongside my colleagues at the local,
state and federal level to support this expansion project so that we
can make necessary upgrades and improvements. It is a sensible
solution that will create jobs and promote economic opportunities for Georgia
families. It will help our state and the Southeast grow and prosper
in the years to come.
Realistic
Scoring
In April of this year, the House of Representatives
passed H.R. 1874, the
Pro-Growth Budgeting Act . This is a bill I
introduced that would require the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
to provide Congress with a more realistic analysis of legislation that
could have a significant long-term, macro-economic impact. It's often
call "dynamic scoring," and it's part of a larger budget process
reform effort to change the way Congress develops and enacts policies that
will affect our nations economic and fiscal
well-being.
Surprisingly, some folks are opposed to
giving Congress these types of analytical tools. There's still those who
would prefer policymakers not have a more accurate and complete
understanding of how bold solutions like tax reform or changes to the nations
health and retirement programs might affect our economy, job creation
and the federal debt. But that's why it's vital we continue to fight
for reforms to the budget process just as we work to enact solutions
to balance the budget and create economic
opportunities.
For those who are still skeptical
about the benefits of dynamic scoring, they don't have to take my word for
it.

Holtz-Eakin.
A more realistic
understanding and analysis of the impact of proposed policies will help
Congress and the country as a whole make better decisions to balance our
budget and grow our economy.
