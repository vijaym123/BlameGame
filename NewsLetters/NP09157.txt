News from Representative Richard Nugent
Dear Friends,
It's been a short week in Washington, so just a couple items for you.
The House moved another one of the twelve appropriations bills. This
time, it was the Commerce, Justice, and Science bill, which funds
several departments. Despite opening the bill up to unlimited
amendments, we managed to move through the bill and pass it in a little
over 48 hours. Feel free to read into that that there is no reason the
Senate can't get its work done.
In any case, obligatory do-nothing Senate mention behind us, I wanted
to flag one particular program for you that has been a key legislative
priority of mine for over a year. Long story short, I saw first-hand
when I was in law enforcement, that the jail system has become a sort
of warehousing facility for people suffering mental health issues.
Individuals with certain mental illness issues have a tendency to run
afoul of the law in many different ways, and like everybody else, they
end up in jail. But jail is a catastrophically bad place to try to
treat those illnesses. As such, many of these same individuals tend to
keep getting rearrested. To give you some idea of the scale we're
talking about.
According to the Florida Mental Health Institute, over five years, 97
individuals in Miami-Dade County accounted for 2,200 bookings in the
county jail, 27,000 days in the jail, and 13,000 days in crisis units,
state hospitals and emergency rooms. The cost to the state and local
taxpayers was nearly $13 million. for just 97 individuals!
However, there are programs available that seek to divert people with
mental health issues into treatment instead of just throwing them into
a cell block. In Pinellas County - for instance - a mental health jail
diversion program showed an 87 percent reduction in re-arrests for the
nearly 3,000 offenders who were enrolled.
Many of these kinds of programs receive federal grants under the
Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Act, of which yours truly is
the sponsor. I've been working with the Judiciary Committee for the
better part of a year on the reauthorization, but this week, we were
working on the appropriation component. I offered an amendment to the
CJS appropriation bill which would boost funding for these programs,
including a separate version of the mental health courts designed
specifically for veterans.
As many people already know, veterans suffer disproportionately from
mental health and in many cases, those issues are a direct result of
their service. To simply throw these guys and gals in jail and forget
about them would be completely unacceptable in my opinion, so I was
pleased to be able to get my amendment passed and into the final
version of the bill.
For those fiscal hawks out there, I want you to know that I covered the
cost of the increased funding by reducing a corresponding amount from
the Census Bureau's bloated budget. In my view, responsible budgeting
isn't just about cutting everything, it's about prioritizing spending.
It's about looking at each line item and seeing how much benefit the
taxpayer gets out of the investments we make. In the case of mental
health programs within the justice system, we're talking about making
our communities safer while saving the taxpayers money. That's about as
obvious as it gets.
In any case, consider another one of the twelve appropriations bills
done. The other main news obviously was that Secretary Shinseki stepped
down as the head of the VA. I've written about it pretty extensively in
recent weeks, so I won't rehash it all here again. Suffice it to say, I
think Shinseki is a good man, a decorated veteran, and a true patriot,
but those things do not cancel out the tragedy that has happened on his
watch. General Shinseki was at the head of the VA for five years - in
my opinion, clearly long enough to change the culture within the
department. He failed to do that and I think stepping down was the
right thing to do. If you are interested, here is a link to the full
statemen
t I put out following his resignation.
Sincerely,
Rich Nugent

from
Representative
Richard
Nugent
Dear
Friends,
It&#8217;s
been
a
short
week
in
Washington,
so
just
a
couple
items
for
you.
The
House
moved
another
one
of
the
twelve
appropriations
bills.
This
time,
it
was
the
Commerce,
Justice,
and
Science
bill,
which
funds
several
departments.
Despite
opening
the
bill
up
to
unlimited
amendments,
we
managed
to
move
through
the
bill
and
pass
it
in
a
little
over
48
hours.
Feel
free
to
read
into
that
that
there
is
no
reason
the
Senate
can&#8217;t
get
its
work
done.
In
any
case,
obligatory
do-nothing
Senate
mention
behind
us,
I
wanted
to
flag
one
particular
program
for
you
that
has
been
a
key
legislative
priority
of
mine
for
over
a
year.
Long
story
short,
I
saw
first-hand
when
I
was
in
law
enforcement,
that
the
jail
system
has
become
a
sort
of
warehousing
facility
for
people
suffering
mental
health
issues.
Individuals
with
certain
mental
illness
issues
have
a
tendency
to
run
afoul
of
the
law
in
many
different
ways,
and
like
everybody
else,
they
end
up
in
jail.
But
jail
is
a
catastrophically
bad
place
to
try
to
treat
those
illnesses.
As
such,
many
of
these
same
individuals
tend
to
keep
getting
rearrested.
To
give
you
some
idea
of
the
scale
we&#8217;re
talking
about&#8230;
According
to
the
Florida
Mental
Health
Institute,
over
five
years,
97
individuals
in
Miami-Dade
County
accounted
for
2,200
bookings
in
the
county
jail,
27,000
days
in
the
jail,
and
13,000
days
in
crisis
units,
state
hospitals
and
emergency
rooms.
The
cost
to
the
state
and
local
taxpayers
was
nearly
$13
million&#8230;
for
just
97
individuals!
However,
there
are
programs
available
that
seek
to
divert
people
with
mental
health
issues
into
treatment
instead
of
just
throwing
them
into
a
cell
block.
In
Pinellas
County
&#8211;
for
instance
&#8211;
a
mental
health
jail
diversion
program
showed
an
87
percent
reduction
in
re-arrests
for
the
nearly
3,000
offenders
who
were
enrolled.
Many
of
these
kinds
of
programs
receive
federal
grants
under
the
Justice
and
Mental
Health
Collaboration
Act,
of
which
yours
truly
is
the
sponsor.
I&#8217;ve
been
working
with
the
Judiciary
Committee
for
the
better
part
of
a
year
on
the
reauthorization,
but
this
week,
we
were
working
on
the
appropriation
component.
I
offered
an
amendment
to
the
CJS
appropriation
bill
which
would
boost
funding
for
these
programs,
including
a
separate
version
of
the
mental
health
courts
designed
specifically
for
veterans.
As
many
people
already
know,
veterans
suffer
disproportionately
from
mental
health
and
in
many
cases,
those
issues
are
a
direct
result
of
their
service.
To
simply
throw
these
guys
and
gals
in
jail
and
forget
about
them
would
be
completely
unacceptable
in
my
opinion,
so
I
was
pleased
to
be
able
to
get
my
amendment
passed
and
into
the
final
version
of
the
bill.
For
those
fiscal
hawks
out
there,
I
want
you
to
know
that
I
covered
the
cost
of
the
increased
funding
by
reducing
a
corresponding
amount
from
the
Census
Bureau&#8217;s
bloated
budget.
In
my
view,
responsible
budgeting
isn&#8217;t
just
about
cutting
everything,
it&#8217;s
about
prioritizing
spending.
It&#8217;s
about
looking
at
each
line
item
and
seeing
how
much
benefit
the
taxpayer
gets
out
of
the
investments
we
make.
In
the
case
of
mental
health
programs
within
the
justice
system,
we&#8217;re
talking
about
making
our
communities
safer
while
saving
the
taxpayers
money.
That&#8217;s
about
as
obvious
as
it
gets.
In
any
case,
consider
another
one
of
the
twelve
appropriations
bills
done.
The
other
main
news
obviously
was
that
Secretary
Shinseki
stepped
down
as
the
head
of
the
VA.
I&#8217;ve
written
about
it
pretty
extensively
in
recent
weeks,
so
I
won&#8217;t
rehash
it
all
here
again.
Suffice
it
to
say,
I
think
Shinseki
is
a
good
man,
a
decorated
veteran,
and
a
true
patriot,
but
those
things
do
not
cancel
out
the
tragedy
that
has
happened
on
his
watch.
General
Shinseki
was
at
the
head
of
the
VA
for
five
years
&#8211;
in
my
opinion,
clearly
long
enough
to
change
the
culture
within
the
department.
He
failed
to
do
that
and
I
think
stepping
down
was
the
right
thing
to
do.
If
you
are
interested,
here
is
a
link
to
the
full
statemen t
I
put
out
following
his
resignation.

Nugent Member
