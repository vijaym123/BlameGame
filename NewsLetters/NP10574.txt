Dear Neighbors,
I invite all of our local veterans and military families to take part
in the Veterans Resource Fair that I am hosting on Saturday, April 26,
between 9:30 am and 12:30 pm at the Grayslake Park District.
>From health care to vocational training to finding employment, there
are myriad resources and potential opportunities available to returning
veterans. Unfortunately, too many veterans either do not know where to
look or have trouble accessing these resources. I hope you will join me
at this fair for the chance to interact directly with the organizations
and employers who can offer services and opportunities to veterans and
military families.
In attendance will be representatives from various state and local
agencies, prospective employers, community organizations and more. My
casework team will also be there to answer any questions and assist
you. I am also pleased to welcome special guest State Representative
Sam Yingling.
To RSVP, please visit this page
or call my District Office at (847)
793-0625 with any questions or for more information.
I am committed to expanding opportunities for our veterans and military
families and helping them directly access the resources and benefits
they've earned.
I hope to see you on April 26.
Thank you,
Brad Schneider
