January 4, 2015
Greetings from Washington D.C. -
It&rsquo;s been a busy end to the year in Washington! As the 113 th
Congress winds down, I&rsquo;ve been working hard on a number of issues, including normalizing relations with Cuba, addressing the serious issues in our criminal justice system, and protecting patient access to medical marijuana.
I was deeply honored to be named &ldquo;Most Valuable House Member&rdquo; in
The Nation
magazine&rsquo;s 2014 progressive honor roll.
Please take a few minutes to see all that I have been working on these past few weeks and my priorities headed into the new Congress:
