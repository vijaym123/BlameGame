WEEK IN
REVIEW
Monday was
Memorial Day, a day we set aside to honor the great Americans who have
made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our freedoms.
In observance
of Memorial Day and in remembrance of our fallen heroes, I joined the
American Legion Post 25 for their Memorial Day program at Hillcrest
Cemetery in Gravette.
In my remarks, I paid tribute to the men
and women of the United States Armed Forces who have died in service to
this nation and shared the story of the Morenci Nine, nine members of
Morenci, Arizonas Class of 1966, who enlisted in the Marine Corps as
the war in Vietnam was raging.
They were emblematic of rural
America; they played sports together, rode horses and hunted together,
and committed their lives to our nation in the most selfless of ways.
Six of those Marines were killed in action.
The little town
of Morenci, like hundreds of other rural communities, have endured
the pain and hardship of losing loved ones to combat.
The Gravette
community is no stranger to this kind of grief
with the 2005 death
of Gravette native Sergeant Arthur McGill, killed by a roadside blast
in Iraq, while serving with 1st Battalion, 9th Field Artillery
Regiment, 2nd BCT, 3rd Infantry Division, Fort Stewart,
GA.
We owe no greater debt than to these brave men
and women in uniform who put themselves in harms way to defend
liberty.
I have the utmost admiration and respect for our veterans, and
I am forever grateful for their unwavering
heroism.
On Wednesday, Northwest Arkansas welcomed its
500,000th resident!

Also on Wednesday, Knesek Guns, Inc. of
Van Buren, which was selected to receive the Presidents
E Award
for Exports in recognition of the companys
achievement in making significant contributions to the increase of U.S. exports,
was in town for the award ceremony at Commerce yesterday.
I was
glad to be there to help present this award.
Congrats!
The Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) is getting ready to finalize the 2014 Renewable Volume Obligations
(RVOs) to meet the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), and on Thursday, I
joined Representatives Bob Goodlatte (VA-6), Jim Costa (CA-16), and
Peter Welch (VT-AL) to announce that 218 Members of the House of
Representatives have expressed concerns regarding the current ethanol mandate.
There is one
thing a bipartisan majority of Members of the House can agree upon
there
is a serious problem with the RFS.
It is telling that 218
members from both sides of the aisle, representing communities across the
nation, have spoken out against the current RFS and called for reform.
The flawed ethanol mandate has a real impact on the American
economy, and legislation in the House to reform the RFS has drawn the
support of more the 50 organizations representing a diverse range of
issues.
There is clearly a growing appetite to reform the
ethanol mandate, and it is time for the EPA to address lawmakers concerns.
Any day now, the EPA is expected to announce the final rule
governing 2014 RFS levels.
As the final rule is written, we urge
Administrator McCarthy to carefully consider the concerns of a majority
of House lawmakers in any decision and take action to reduce the
burden of the RFS for 2014.
In April 2013, Reps. Goodlatte, Costa, Welch, and I introduced
H.R. 1462, the RFS Reform Act, which eliminates corn-based ethanol
requirements, caps the amount of ethanol that can be blended into
conventional gasoline at 10 percent, and requires the EPA to set cellulosic
biofuels levels at production levels.
In October, we sent a
letter
signed by 169 Members of the House to the EPA
requesting a reduction of RFS levels for this
year.
Thursday evening, the House passed
H.R. 4660 , the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related
Agencies Appropriations Act of 2015.
H.R. 4660 funds the
Department of Commerce, Department of Justice (DOJ), the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA), the National Science Foundation
(NSF), and other related agencies.
This legislation provides $51.2
billion in total discretionary funding, $398 million below the fiscal
year 2014 enacted level.
The bill also eliminates 33 programs,
resulting in savings of more than $250 million, and rescinds $469 million
in unused prior-year funding.
On Friday, General Eric Shinseki, U.S. Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA) Secretary, resigned as more and more details about
mismanagement at the VA come to light.
There are tremendous problems plaguing the VA
and its ability to carry out one of the most important missions of our
government
caring for our veterans.
It's been determined that
the VAs problems are systemic, and while Im encouraged that the
administration is beginning to take responsibility for them, Secretary
Shinsekis resignation alone isnt going to right the ship.
I hope
Acting Secretary Gibson will promptly get to the bottom of this, hold
all involved accountable, and do everything in his power to repair
the lack of trust our nation and veterans have in their health
system.
Also on Friday, the House passed
H.R. 4681 , the Intelligence Authorization Act
for Fiscal Years 2014 and 2015.
H.R. 4681 authorizes
appropriations for all U.S. intelligence activities, including CIA personnel and
activities, support to combat units in Afghanistan, monitoring of
foreign militaries, analysis of international political and economic events,
and research and technology.
In light of the recent
unauthorized disclosures of classified information, H.R. 4681 provides for
continuous evaluation of individuals authorized to access classified
information.
The bill also requires a declassification review of
documents collected during the mission that killed Obsama bin Laden.
As always, thank you to the
Neil family of Bentonville, Pat and Fred Rugel of Bella Vista, Buster
Pray and his grandson, Noah, from Rogers, and Devin Riley and Stephanie
Hogan from Bentonville for stopping by my office during your visit to
D.C.!
Safe travels back to
Arkansas.
Next week, the House will not be in session.
I hope
to see you around the Third District!
From the
Front...
