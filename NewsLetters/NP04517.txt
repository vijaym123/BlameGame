Dear
Friend,
Nestled in the valley cut by Dunkard Creek along the
southern Pennsylvania-West Virginia border is the small village of
Jollytown in Greene County. The gas station and general store closed long ago,
but what remains is an inspiration to all Americans this Veterans
Day.
Standing sentry at the villages entrance is a statute
of Private Jesse Taylor, the first casualty in the Civil War from
Greene County. And just a mile and a half down the winding unmarked road
from Private Taylors statute is the town named for him:
Hero.
I learned about Private Taylor and his familys loyalty to our
country this past weekend during a Veterans Day ceremony at the nearby
Rogersville Methodist Church. Private Taylors grandfather was a
Revolutionary War veteran and both are now interred at a nearby small
cemetery just outside of Hero.
During the Rogersville service,
I heard similar stories of patriotism. Local resident Captain Wesley
Cranmer, who is a member of the 911 th
Airlift Wing, told me
about generations of his family who have served. Members of the Roupe
family told me about Lieutenant Colonel Cephus Lee Roupe, a native of
Waynesburg, who served our country with honor during a 36 year career
in the Army. Lt. Col. Roupe never shied away from a deployment, having
seen combat duty in the first and second Iraq wars, Bosnia, and in
Afghanistan. Roupe died in 2012, shortly after he submitted his
retirement papers. The community named a Route 18 bridge over Fish Creek in
Freeport Township after Lt. Col. Roupe.
There are stories
just like these passed down by families all across Southwestern
Pennsylvania. On Veterans Day, I hope to see you as I
travel across our
region to pay to tribute to the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and
marines who inspire us every day. Join me in thanking those who have
valiantly served and continue to serve our country. We owe them our eternal
gratitude for the price of freedom is marked by their
sacrifice.
May God Bless America and Our
Troops,
Tim Murphy

Congress
