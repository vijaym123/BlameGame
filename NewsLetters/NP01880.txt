House Passes A Balanced Budget for a Stronger America
After an open and honest debate last week, the House of
Representatives passed a balanced budget that would hold Washington
accountable, protect our nation, grow our economy, and empower individuals,
families, job creators and our local communities. It's a positive
vision for the future and stands in stark contrast to the President's
budget that never, ever balances.
Right now, failed
Washington policies are contributing to an unsustainable growth in the
nations debt, stagnant wages for hard-working taxpayers and the worst
economic recovery in the modern era. Our budget will build a stronger
America by creating more opportunity, saving and improving Medicare
and Medicaid, making government more efficient and effective and our
tax code simpler and fairer.
In the days and weeks
to come, we look forward to working with our colleagues in the Senate
to continue the path forward towards a balanced budget and a
healthier economy.
Anniversary of Obamacare
On last weeks anniversary of
Obamacare, the House passed a budget that repeals the President's
health care law in full
including all taxes, regulations, and
mandates.
We ought to start over with
patient-centered reforms that promote freedom of choice, affordability, and put
individuals, families and physicians back in charge of health care
decisions.
The Medicare
Patient Empowerment Act
On Thursday, I
introduced the Medicare Patient Empowerment Act (H.R. 1650) - the same day
that the House passed bipartisan legislation to replace Medicares
Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula and make additional reforms to the
Medicare program.
H.R. 1650 is a common sense
proposal that gives our seniors the opportunity to make health care
decisions with their physicians without Washington interference. It
will increase the number of doctors who are able to see Medicare patients
and is part of our ongoing effort to expand access to quality,
affordable and innovative health care for seniors and all
Americans.
