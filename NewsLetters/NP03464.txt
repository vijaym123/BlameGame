America's New Congress
Congressman Yoder signing his Oath of Office.
I want
to make sure that your priorities at home are my priorities in
Washington. Please take a moment to let me know what issues you believe the
new Congress should be addressing.
Click here
to take my 2015 Issues Survey.
First and foremost,
I believe those priorities should be founded in the
Constitution.
A great tradition began in 2011 after Republicans took control of
the majority in the House of Representatives. Never before in history
had the Constitution been read aloud on the House floor. Since then,
we have spent a day in the first week of each session taking turns
reading aloud provisions of the document we swear an oath to
uphold.
I was honored to take part in the reading for the third time in
history last Friday.

Yoder read the Constitution on the House
floor.
Restoring the Balance of Power in Government
Tomorrow, the House of Representatives is poised to take up
legislation to defund the Presidents executive order, prevent any
future money from being used to grant federal benefits to illegal
immigrants, and secure our border.
I am please to see action
on this issue so quickly, as it is one of my top priorities for this
new Congress.
The
Fiscal Year 2015 Department of Homeland Security
Appropriations Act, HR 240 , includes funding for Customs and Border
Protection to support the largest operational force level in history. It
ensures an around-the-clock land, sea, and air surveillance of the
border by requiring at least 95,000 operational flight hours. Immigration
and Customs Enforcement gets increased funding for domestic and
international investigations on human trafficking and drug
smuggling.
The bill directs the Administration to stop
putting the interests of immigrants who have come here within the
appropriate legal framework behind those who have come illegally.
I have always said that the
best approach to tackling the problems with our immigration system is to
enforce the laws we have on the books and secure our
border.
This legislation takes exactly that
approach, which is why I plan to vote yes
tomorrow.
Restoring the 40-Hour Work Week in America
Last week, the House
passed Representative Todd Youngs important legislation restoring the
40-hour work week. I am a proud cosponsor of the
Save American Workers Act, HR 30,
which restores
certainty to as many as 2.6 million Americans at risk of having their hours
cut to 29 per week under
Obamacare.
In an era where incomes remain stagnant, Americans are struggling
enough. They do not need an additional 25% pay cut if their hours are
cut from 39 to 29 per week under this Administrations
policies.
Full repeal of Obamacare must
remain the goal. As we continue that work, we must also begin to repeal its
most onerous provisions. This bill is a good first step towards doing
that, which is why it has my full support.
Helping
Veterans and the Economy
Another way the
House moved to roll back Obamacare during its first week in session was
to pass
HR 22, the Hire More Heroes
Act . This bill exempts veterans who are covered under the VA or
TRICARE health care systems from the employer mandate in the President's
health care law.
Those who have sacrificed for our
country should not have their employment options limited.This bipartisan
proposal will not only allow veterans to have access to better paying
jobs, but it will also allow businesses to grow their workforce. It's
no surprise this bill passed by a vote of 412-0, and I urge the Senate
to swiftly act to send it to the President's desk for signature into
law.
Recognizing the Victims of Terrorist
Attacks in France
Click here to watch a video of the House
observing a moment of silence for the
victims.
Last week, we were given a sad and tragic reminder that we continue to
face the threat of terrorism at home and
abroad.
While I was disappointed to see that the Administration
neglected to send any senior officials to stand arm-in-arm with world
leaders during the march in Paris over the weekend, I was proud to stand
with my colleagues in the House of Representatives last week as we
recognized the victims with a moment of
silence.
Now more than ever, we must stand united as free and
democratic nations against those who would wish to destory
us.
March for
Life

is next week. I am excited that many of you are making the trip from

Fact of the
Week
The 30-hour work week rule in Obamacare puts as many as
2.6 million Americans in danger of losing hours and getting as much
as a 25 percent pay cut.
