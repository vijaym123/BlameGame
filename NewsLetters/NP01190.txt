Taking Care of Our Veterans
This week the House passed bipartisan legislation to ensure our military has the necessary infrastructure, boost funding for veterans programs, and to make the Department of Veterans Affairs more accountable. The bill reflects our unwavering commitment to providing Americas troops and veterans with the resources they need while on active duty and when they return to our communities. I'm also proud to report that the legislation included an amendment I offered to provide veterans with more resources for job training and other services to help them transition into the civilian sector.
