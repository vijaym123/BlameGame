Dear Friend,
This past week, the House of
Representatives passed a good, bipartisan
bill that could help many middle class
families.
Like many of you, I was the first in my
family to go to college. Ours was a working
class union family so I had to pay my own
way through school. To do that, I worked
any number of jobs: truck driver, mechanic,
a road crew, you name it.
As an accountant, Ive seen
countless parents struggle with putting
away money for their kids tuition.
You know how it is: you want to make sure
they have it better than you do. But at a
time when the cost of just about everything
is going up and incomes are barely moving,
that jobs only gotten harder.
So last month, when President Obama
proposed taxing 529 plans, people were
understandably outraged. Why would we make
saving for college even harder? We talk all
the time about rewarding people who work
hard and play by the rules
well,
thats what 529 plans are. They
empower families to set up accounts for
their children
right from when
theyre born
and then down
the line they can use that money
tax-free
on books, fees, tuition,
and room-and-board.
All told, there are nearly 12 million of
these accounts open in all 50 states.
Thats up from 1 million accounts in
2001. Why would we stop that growth? So the
government can take even more of the money
weve worked so hard to put away?
Thankfully, after a public outcry, the
president was forced to drop the idea.
But we can do more. With all the
challenges middle-class families are facing
right now, we need to make it easier
not harder
to save.
Thats why the House acted this past
week to expand and modernize 529 plans.
Our plan will do a few simple things.
First, to adapt to the times, we clarify
that computers are qualified expenses under
529 accounts. Second, we remove unnecessary
paperwork burdens for the administrators of
these plans. And third, we allow families
to re-deposit refunds from colleges without
taxes or penalties. This might be useful if
something happens and a student has to
withdraw early for an illness. Its
just good peace of mind to have. Im
pleased to report that the bill passed with
more than 400 votes. Now we just need
President Obama to help us get this
done.
Together, lets make sure that 529
plans will be there for middle-class
families for years to come. Lets
take this step to make college more
affordable and easier to plan, because we
all know that a good education leads to
greater opportunity and a stronger
economy.
