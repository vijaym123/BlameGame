Wicker: President Plays
Politics
With Power Grab on Immigration
Executive
Action to Bypass Congress
Undermines Democratic
Process
Less than three weeks after
the midterm elections, President Obama addressed the nation with a new
plan on immigration.
Rather than building bipartisan support in
Congress and the nation for comprehensive immigration reform, he
announced he would use sweeping executive action to grant legal status to
nearly five million illegal
immigrants.
I oppose amnesty for illegal immigrants and continue to be a
strong supporter of measures to secure our borders.
In addition,
most Americans agree that Congress must address the issue of what to do
with undocumented persons already residing in the United States.
Our immigration system is broken
a fact acknowledged by both
political parties.
With this power grab, however, President Obama is
undermining the democratic process that could lead to substantive
consensus reforms.
Governing by Administrative
Fiat
The Presidents executive overreach
also blatantly ignores the call for change that Americans validated at
the polls on November 4.
No matter his frustrations or
political aims, President Obama cannot single-handedly rewrite the law because
he disagrees with it.
Lawmaking is delegated solely to Congress
by the Constitution.
Governing by administrative fiat usurps
the power of the legislative
branch.
This is not the first time that the Obama Administration has abused
executive power.
In early 2012, the President made
unconstitutional appointments to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and
National Labor Relations Board.
The appointments were later
challenged in the courts, and all nine Supreme Court justices ruled that the
President had acted outside of his legal authority.
Likewise, the
Supreme Court ruled against the Administration because of
controversial mandates in the health-care law that limited the religious liberty
of employers like Hobby Lobby.
Sidestepping the
Constitution
It is disappointing that
the President has repeatedly used his pulpit to threaten unilateral
action.
In June, he promised to fix as much of our immigration
system as I can on my own.
At the beginning of the year, he
said, Ive got a pen and Ive got a phone, and I can use that pen to sign
executive orders and take executive actions.
The President has
made it clear he is determined to pursue his agenda, regardless of
whether it means bypassing Congress or trampling on the
Constitution.
One wonders, however, why
immigration was not part of the agenda when Democrats controlled both chambers
of Congress with super-majorities in 2009 and 2010.
The
President could have proposed an immigration bill for consideration in the
same way he championed a costly health-care law and massive overhaul of
the financial system.
Reinforcing Executive
Oversight
Concerns have already
been raised that President Obamas actions will set a dangerous precedent
for future administrations, in addition to eroding our system of
checks and balances.
Congress has an obligation to do what it can to
rein in the executive branch, potentially through the appropriations
process or alternative legislation.
The courts are certain to
have their say on the matter as
well.
Immigration policy has a significant impact on Americans
lives, from its effect on states rights to economic growth.
It
should be crafted, debated, and voted on by lawmakers elected to serve as
a voice for the American people.
In acting alone, the
Administration is prioritizing politics over representative
democracy.
