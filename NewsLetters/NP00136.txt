As
Tropical Storm Bill
moves inland between Rockport and Matagorda, please be aware of the resources available in the event of flooding or other natural disasters during hurricane season.
During a disaster, it is important to have a plan. A disaster kit with bottled water, non-perishable food, flashlights, batteries, and a radio can be invaluable. Visit my website for more information on what to do in case of flooding ( click here ) and or a hurricane ( click here ) including local contact emergency phone numbers.
After the storm has passed, you may be eligible for individual and household assistance through FEMA. There are three ways you can register for disaster assistance, which can include home repair and, in some instances, home replacement. Online registration is available online at
http://www.disasterassistance.gov/
or if you're using a mobile device, at
http://m.fema.gov/ . You can also call 1-800-621-3362. After registering, you will begin the process by working with local officials on your disaster claim application. After submitting your application, it will be reviewed by state and federal officials, and you may be reimbursed for the disaster-related damage.
I urge everyone to be safe this hurricane season, and if you every have any questions please feel free to call my office at 361-884-2222 or visit my
website .
