NEW Projection: 51 Democrats - 49 Republicans
Friend --
We&rsquo;re back in the lead and on the verge of keeping control of the Senate.
But EVERYTHING hinges on our Get Out The Vote push this weekend. It&rsquo;s our FINAL chance to mobilize the voters we need to win!
You can&rsquo;t be complacent, not now. If you step back and say you&rsquo;re done with this election, we could miss out on as many as
575,000 votes
-- way more than Mitch McConnell needs to take control.
But if you step up RIGHT NOW, we&rsquo;ll take the battle directly to the Republicans, execute the sophisticated GOTV operation we&rsquo;ve been planning for months, and come out ON TOP on Election Day. McConnell? OUT. Senate? SAVED.
Friend, you have to choose. Will you pitch in to our GOTV push before the LAST EVER end-of-month deadline in 48 hours? You&rsquo;re almost out of time!!
