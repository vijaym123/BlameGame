Rated the top conservative in Michigan
I'm proud to be named the top conservative in Michigan
by the American Conservative Union.
Lois Lerner held in contempt of Congress
The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (OGR), of which
I am a member, has uncovered IRS abuses of its power to regulate
tax-exempt advocacy organizations. Conservative organizations that were
critical of the administration were targeted
for
burdensome and unprecedented audits. The IRS required some of these
organizations to turn over lists of their donors, and some audits
dragged on for as long as two years.
At least some IRS officials knew about the ideological targeting as
early as 2011, yet the agency publicly denied that any unfair targeting
had occurred. The administration must be forthcoming about the extent
of the targeting, its motivation, who is ultimately responsible for it,
and who is responsible for the decision to lie about it.
Lois Lerner, the former director of exempt organizations at the IRS,
has refused to answer questions under the Committee's subpoena. On
April 10, 2014, I voted with OGR to hold Ms. Lerner in contempt of
Congress. In a country built on the cornerstone of freedom of political
expression, Congress must provide oversight of potential abuses by the
executive branch.
Budgeting for the future
On April 10, 2014, I voted yes on H. Con. Res. 96
, the
House budget resolution for fiscal year 2015.
This budget-often referred to as the (Rep. Paul) Ryan budget-is the
best budget to pass the House since I took office in 2011. It's also
the first House Republican budget since 2011 not to spend more than
allowed under current law in the first fiscal year (FY 2015). A major
concern I had with the final House budgets from the previous two years,
both of which I opposed, was that they violated the spending caps put
in place by the Budget Control Act (debt ceiling deal) of 2011.
Although I prefer this year's Republican Study Committee budget
and may offer a House
Liberty Caucus
budget in future years, this year's House
Republican budget is better than the House budget I supported in 2011.
This proposal reduces the growth rate of spending by $5.14 trillion
over the next ten years. Spending averages 19 percent of GDP-lower than
the previous three House budgets-and it balances by 2024. It also
reduces the national debt (held by the public) from 73 percent of GDP
now to 56 percent of GDP in 2025.
For FY 2015, the budget complies with the Budget Control Act's spending
caps of $521.3 billion for defense spending and $492.4 billion for
nondefense spending. Although the budget plans for more defense
spending in FY 2016 through FY 2024 than allowed under current law, it
more than makes up for it in reductions to nondefense spending,
resulting in overall discretionary spending that is more than $300
billion below the aggregate (defense + nondefense) legal spending caps
over the next ten years.
The proposal still lacks the real, bipartisan compromise that will be
necessary if we're ever truly going to balance the budget. If we are
serious about achieving balance, Republicans in Washington cannot
continue to pretend that there is no room for military spending
reforms. In addition, the Ryan-Murray budget deal from late 2013 (which
I opposed) increased the spending caps for 2015, which made meeting the
caps in this budget easier. Nevertheless, this House Republican budget
presents many sound ideas on reforming mandatory programs, simplifying
the tax code, and changing other spending priorities.
The concurrent resolution passed the House of Representatives 219-205.
Latest news on unconstitutional NSA surveillance
The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has proposed NSA
"reform" legislation that is even more unconstitutional than the
current process. There is only one bill that protects our privacy
rights as guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment: the USA FREEDOM Act
, which
has more than 140 bipartisan cosponsors. I'm proud to be one of the
coauthors. My colleagues and I will hold the NSA accountable.

abolished.

Rated
the
top
conservative
in
Michigan
I&#8217;m
proud
to
be
named the
top
conservative
in
Michigan
by
the
American
Conservative
Union.
Lois
Lerner
held
in
contempt
of
Congress
The
House
Committee
on
Oversight
and
Government
Reform
(OGR),
of
which
I
am
a
member,
has
uncovered
IRS
abuses
of
its
power
to
regulate
tax-exempt
advocacy
organizations.
Conservative
organizations
that
were
critical
of
the
administration
were
targeted
for
burdensome
and
unprecedented
audits.
The
IRS
required
some
of
these
organizations
to
turn
over
lists
of
their
donors,
and
some
audits
dragged
on
for
as
long
as
two
years.
At
least
some
IRS
officials
knew
about
the
ideological
targeting
as
early
as
2011,
yet
the
agency
publicly
denied
that
any
unfair
targeting
had
occurred.
The
administration
must
be
forthcoming
about
the
extent
of
the
targeting,
its
motivation,
who
is
ultimately
responsible
for
it,
and
who
is
responsible
for
the
decision
to
lie
about
it.
Lois
Lerner,
the
former
director
of
exempt
organizations
at
the
IRS,
has
refused
to
answer
questions
under
the
Committee&#8217;s
subpoena.
On
April
10,
2014,
I
voted
with
OGR
to
hold
Ms.
Lerner
in
contempt
of
Congress.
In
a
country
built
on
the
cornerstone
of
freedom
of
political
expression,
Congress
must
provide
oversight
of
potential
abuses
by
the
executive
branch.
Budgeting
for
the
future
On
April
10,
2014,
I
voted
yes
on
H.
Con.
Res.
96 ,
the
House
budget
resolution
for
fiscal
year
2015.
This
budget&#8212;often
referred
to
as
the
(Rep.
Paul)
Ryan
budget&#8212;is
the
best
budget
to
pass
the
House
since
I
took
office
in
2011.
It's
also
the
first
House
Republican
budget
since
2011
not
to
spend
more
than
allowed
under
current
law
in
the
first
fiscal
year
(FY
2015).
A
major
concern
I
had
with
the
final
House
budgets
from
the
previous
two
years,
both
of
which
I
opposed,
was
that
they
violated
the
spending
caps
put
in
place
by
the
Budget
Control
Act
(debt
ceiling
deal)
of
2011.
Although
I
prefer
this
year's
Republican
Study
Committee
budget
and
may
offer
a
House
Liberty
Caucus
budget
in
future
years,
this
year's
House
Republican
budget
is
better
than
the
House
budget
I
supported
in
2011.
This
proposal
reduces
the
growth
rate
of
spending
by
$5.14
trillion
over
the
next
ten
years.
Spending
averages
19
percent
of
GDP&#8212;lower
than
the
previous
three
House
budgets&#8212;and
it
balances
by
2024.
It
also
reduces
the
national
debt
(held
by
the
public)
from
73
percent
of
GDP
now
to
56
percent
of
GDP
in
2025.
For
FY
2015,
the
budget
complies
with
the
Budget
Control
Act's
spending
caps
of
$521.3
billion
for
defense
spending
and
$492.4
billion
for
nondefense
spending.
Although
the
budget
plans
for
more
defense
spending
in
FY
2016
through
FY
2024
than
allowed
under
current
law,
it
more
than
makes
up
for
it
in
reductions
to
nondefense
spending,
resulting
in
overall
discretionary
spending
that
is
more
than
$300
billion
below
the
aggregate
(defense
+
nondefense)
legal
spending
caps
over
the
next
ten
years.
The
proposal
still
lacks
the
real,
bipartisan
compromise
that
will
be
necessary
if
we're
ever
truly
going
to
balance
the
budget.
If
we
are
serious
about
achieving
balance,
Republicans
in
Washington
cannot
continue
to
pretend
that
there
is
no
room
for
military
spending
reforms.
In
addition,
the
Ryan-Murray
budget
deal
from
late
2013
(which
I
opposed)
increased
the
spending
caps
for
2015,
which
made
meeting
the
caps
in
this
budget
easier.
Nevertheless,
this
House
Republican
budget
presents
many
sound
ideas
on
reforming
mandatory
programs,
simplifying
the
tax
code,
and
changing
other
spending
priorities.
The
concurrent
resolution
passed
the
House
of
Representatives
219-205.
