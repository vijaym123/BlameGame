David --
Millions of Illinois seniors depend on Social Security to retire with dignity.
But if Republicans like Jeb Bush have their way, the Social Security retirement age would be raised to 70. That&rsquo;d be a DISASTER for Illinois seniors. It&rsquo;s disgraceful that Republicans would threaten the retirement benefits that Illinois seniors have earned and deserve.
David, that&rsquo;s why Cheri will always fight to protect Social Security.
25,OOO SIGNATURES NEEDED:
Demand Republicans leave Social Security alone &gt;&gt;
Since coming to Congress, Cheri has fought tirelessly to protect the benefits Illinois seniors count on.
And while Republicans like Bush are doing everything they can to end Social Security as we know it, Cheri won&rsquo;t stand for it! David, sign Cheri&rsquo;s petition to protect Social Security: http://act.cheribustos.com/social-security
