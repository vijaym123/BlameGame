Dear
Friend,
Fifty years ago, President Lyndon Johnson signed
into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964, one of the greatest legislative
achievements in the history of our country. In a historic action,
members of both parties came together to pass this landmark
legislation, which outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion,
sex and national origin.
My
father was a civil rights lawyer, who had a significant role
writing the enforcement language behind Title VI of the Civil Rights
Act - the part that was used to desegregate public school
systems in the South.
I spoke about this
historic moment on the floor of the House of Representatives. You can
watch the video here:
Like me, my father was trained as a
scientist. While growing up in the South, he saw firsthand the
struggles for equality and basic human rights. He saw civil rights as the
great cause of his generation. Wanting to serve his fellow man, he became
a civil rights lawyer and went on to write the federal guidelines for
the implementation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, the detailed
rules that called out what Southern school systems had to do each year
to desegregate their schools to qualify for federal
funds.
I am proud to continue
my family's long tradition of fighting for civil rights in this country
as a Member of Congress and will work with my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle to ensure that the American dream a reality for all
Americans.
