Dear Friend,
This
week, President Obama laid out an agenda in his
State of
the Union speech
that bolstered support for Americas middle
class, removing roadblocks to progress and giving families the tools needed
to seize opportunities. He focused on the real life issues that
matter to Americans, like expanding paid sick leave, expanding educational
opportunities, making childcare affordable and seeking
ways to increase wages . He also discussed supporting
innovative technology and manufacturing sectors , which is
important to many companies, institutions and workers in the Third
District of Massachusetts.
My guest at this years State of
the Union speech was Mayor of the City of Marlborough Arthur Vigeant.
I invited Mayor Vigeant in the spirit of
bipartisanship
so that he could hear firsthand the Presidents plan for
supporting a Make it in America agenda that will continue to grow jobs,
economic development, manufacturing and innovation in cities like
Marlborough. You can read more about my thoughts on the State of the Union
speech in this edition of
Congress in Your
Inbox.
Also in this edition, you will find my video of my work this week on
the Floor of the House of Representatives, where I spoke out about
protecting womens access to healthcare , as well as an
amendment I authored to make
natural gas pipeline
projects more transparent . There is also information about the
passage of my bill that will help
preserve the Nashua
River , which has been signed into law by President
Obama.
As always, I look forward to your feedback via my website, or
on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Thank you for staying engaged and enjoy this edition of
Congress in
your Inbox.
Sincerely,
Niki Tsongas
