Farenthold Introduces Free Speech Legislation
Most of us have left a comment online or used platforms like Yelp or TripAdvisor to post a review of a restaurant or product. However did you know that leaving a comment or posting a review can actually lead to a lawsuit. One couple in Utah was sued by retailer KlearGear after the couple posted a bad review about their quality of service. These types of frivolous lawsuits are called SLAPPs or Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation. My new bill, the Securing Participation, Engagement and Knowledge Freedom by Reducing Egregious Efforts or SPEAK FREE Act, would protect people who want to say what is on their mind by deterring SLAPPs and guarding against abuse in our legal system.
The
SPEAK FREE Act
is based on the Texas Citizens Participation Act.
Instead of having a patchwork of free speech protections across the fifty states, my bill takes the high-quality free speech protection found in Texas and applies it to the national level. We are all familiar with the phrase, I disapprove of what you have to say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.
In the Internet and information technology age, our First Amendment guarantee of free speech remains as important as ever. The SPEAK FREE act protects regular Americans from actors in big business and big government seeking to silence our right to publicly express our opinions.
Cheniere Receives Approval for LNG Export Terminal
I was thrilled to learn that the Department of Energy has approved of Cheniere Energys Liquid Natural Gas export terminal in Corpus Christi. Cheniere has been waiting for approval on this project for several years.
In fact, they have been waiting longer than Ive served in Congress. Cheniere is now ready to break ground on the export terminal that will boost our economy, create plenty of local jobs, stabilize gas prices, and help with our national security. I am happy to see that the Department of Energy has finally realized the great benefits Chenieres project offers both our district and our country, and I look forward to seeing the projects successful completion.
Judiciary Committee Approves FACT Act
Last week was a busy legislative week.
The House Judiciary Committee approved my bill
H.R. 526 , the Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency (FACT) Act by a 19-9 vote. My bill would reduce fraud in the asbestos bankruptcy trust system by improving transparency and cutting back on double-dipping.
Some of the asbestos trust fund payouts have been reduced by more than 50 percent because of fraud and abuse.
I want to shore up these funds so that every dollar goes towards those victims, especially our veterans, who live with mesothelioma and other asbestos-related illnesses and their families.
Thank You Nurses!
Last week was National Nurses Week. Thank you to all of our nurses!
House Votes to Strike Down EPA Regulations
I enjoy clean air and water, but I also know that far too many of the Environmental Protection Agencies regulations do much more harm than good. The EPAs proposed new rule to redefine and regulate the waters of the United States under the Clean Water Act is one of the most egregious government overreaches I have seen.
Until this regulation the waters of the United States have been defined as large bodies of water, like large rivers, lakes, and portions of coastal ocean that are navigable. The EPA has proposed to expand this definition to include ponds, drainage ditches, and even ephemeral streams and river beds that only have running water during heavy rains. This not only turns the Clean Water Act on its head, but this regulation would be devastating for farmers, construction companies, and dozens of other businesses.
I supported, and fortunately the House passed
H.R. 1732 , the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act, to overturn this latest regulation. With this bill, I hope we can bring some sanity back to the debate about proper regulation and the role of the EPA.
Farenthold Supports PATRIOT Act
Reform
On May 13, the House passed
H.R. 2048 , the USA Freedom Act, which prohibits bulk collection of records under Section 215 of the Patriot Act.
As an attorney with a background in tech, I believe the Fourth Amendment specifically prohibits the government from this sort of spying on Americans, which is why I supported the USA Freedom Act and its reforms to reign in NSA surveillance.
We should not sacrifice our liberty for security.
House Passes National Defense Authorization Act
Last week the House passed
H.R. 1735 , the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, for fiscal year 2016. The NDAA provides funding and broad stroke directions for the U.S. military. As part of the NDAA Congress exercised its constitutional responsibility to provide for a common national defense by ensuring our military has the necessary tools and capabilities to execute their missions.
The NDAA empowers our military to combat threats abroad like ISIS and al-Qaeda and provides funding for critical domestic missions like the Corpus Christi Army Depot (CCAD), the largest helicopter repair facility in the world.
The bill included two amendments I worked on. I co-sponsored an amendment that would limit the Department of Defense from furloughing employees at places like CCAD and sponsored an amendment to provide free high-speed wireless internet access to our servicemen and women deployed overseas. The first amendment I worked on would give Congress the power to intervene to prevent future furloughs.
Facilities like CCAD for the backbone of our military readiness and I want to ensure that these installations are staffed and operational so that our men and women in uniform have nothing but the best and safest equipment on the planet. I started working on the other amendment when I learned that some of our service members have to pay out of their own pocket for internet access.
The amendment requires the Department of Defense to work to provide free internet to our servicemen and women stationed abroad. Communication with loved ones back in the United States is important for mental health and well-being, and we should not expect the members of our military to incur costs just trying to stay in touch with their parents, spouses, and kids. I was happy to see my amendment included in the House passed version of the NDAA.
