New Projection: Democrats 51 &ndash; Republicans 49
Friend -- The
New York Times
reports that &ldquo;Democrats are making much greater investments in the ground game than Republicans.&rdquo;
Our
Paint the South Blue Program
has put us in the lead in FIVE Southern states --
but if we can&#39;t fund it by our FINAL quarterly deadline at MIDNIGHT, we risk losing EVERYTHING.
Your decision in the next THREE HOURS will make or break this entire election.
So will you pitch in and ensure we have the resources to launch an all-out ATTACK on the GOP?
Or will you sit back and risk a horrific loss in November?
We&rsquo;re pleading with you: It&rsquo;s your FINAL shot. Please donate BEFORE MIDNIGHT, and we&rsquo;ll triple-match your gift!
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
Seriously: Every dollar you give could bring out another Democratic voter -- or more! Please give.
Thanks,
