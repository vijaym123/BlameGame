Dear Friend,
Today, on this Fourth of
July, our state and our country joins together in celebration of our
countrys 238th birthday.
It is a time to reflect on our nations
rich history and the many sacrifices made to preserve our
freedom.
This Independence Day is especially notable as we mark the
200 th
anniversary of the War of 1812 and also that of our
national anthem, the Star-Spangled Banner. During an attack on Fort McHenry
in the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, it was a garrison flag [w]hose
broad stripes and bright stars inspired Francis Scott Key to pen the
lyrics to our national anthem in 1814.
The
commemoration of our Second War of Independence reminds us that throughout our
nations history, many Americans have served our country in defense of
our freedoms.
From the Revolutionary War to Operation Enduring
Freedom in Afghanistan, our service men and women have valiantly
devoted their lives to something greater than themselves.
Many
Utahns will fly their own Stars and Stripes this year on the
4 th
of July.
My office can arrange to have an American flag
flown over the U.S. Capitol in honor of an individual, a group, or a
special occasion.
If you would like to request a commemorative flag,
please contact my office .
As your
Representative in Congress, I spend the Fourth of July reflecting on the
privilege and honor of working on your behalf here in Washington.
I always appreciate hearing from you on current topics and issues
affecting you and our community.
Please
let me
know
areas you find especially interesting or where I can provide
you with additional information.
I value your ideas and look
forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
U.S. Representative
4th District of
Utah
