David -- it&rsquo;s Sunday night, so I&rsquo;ll keep this quick:
We&rsquo;re in a hole right now, $683 behind on tonight's budget deadline. And we only have 5 hours left.
David, this is Cheri&rsquo;s most important deadline since Karl Rove&rsquo;s dark money group announced a deceptive ad campaign targeting her record.
Coming up short is NOT an option. Not if we want to re-elect Cheri.
Will you chip in a gift of any amount to close the gap for Cheri? Every dollar counts.
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Cheri&rsquo;s working hard to get our message out to Illinois&rsquo; 17th district, but with Karl Rove coming after us, we could be in for a heart-wrenching defeat this election. Please, chip in whatever you can afford: http://action.cheribustos.com/Chip-In
