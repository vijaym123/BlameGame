Update from Senator Bob Corker
May 23,
2014
Honoring
Memorial Day
Senator Corker made the following statement honoring Memorial Day,
May 26, 2014.
"My job gives me the honor of meeting
with members of our military stationed around the world, and Im
always deeply moved by my visits with them. It is because of their
courage, selflessness and willingness to serve that the United States remains
the greatest country on Earth. On this Memorial Day, we remember
them, their families and those who have made the ultimate sacrifice, and
may we work even harder to ensure
todays veterans receive the
support they deserve when returning home," said Corker.
Our Nations Veterans Deserve Answers
and Accountability
Senator Corker released the following statement Wednesday on
President Obamas remarks regarding recent allegations against the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA):
After waiting weeks to publicly address allegations of
neglect at some VA medical facilities and with more disturbing
reports surfacing of veterans not receiving the care they need, Im highly
disappointed President Obama did not announce an independent,
third-party review of all VA medical facilities today. Our nations veterans
deserve answers and accountability from the administration, and an
internal investigation at an agency plagued by poor leadership and
mismanagement is simply not enough. We need to shine a light on the
departments activities so we can begin to resolve the systemic problems that
exist. I also believe one of the best ways we can honor our Tennessee
veterans and all those who have served our country is to provide them
greater flexibility and better access to quality health
care.
Last week, Corker and Senator
Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.)
wrote to
VA Secretary
Eric K. Shinseki calling on the VA to conduct a thorough, open and
transparent audit following reports of neglect at some of its medical
facilities, including allegations that up to 40 patients may have died
because of delayed care at the Phoenix VA Health Care System. The
senators also asked Shinseki to provide specific information regarding the
average time Tennessee veterans are waiting for care at VA
facilities.

More Than
100 Small Business Owners Attend Google
Event
More than one hundred Tennessee small business owners
had the opportunity to create a free website on Monday at an event
hosted by Senator Corker and Google.
At the Tennessee Get Your Business Online event, Google
experts helped small business owners create a free website, and provided
attendees with the following:
Customized domain name
Free web hosting for one
year
Local business listing on Google
Additional tools,
training and resources
Todays event was a great opportunity for Tennessee small businesses
to create a website and learn about growing their brand online, said
Corker. It was inspiring to see Chattanoogas entrepreneurial spirit
in action, and I look forward to hosting similar events across
Tennessee in the coming months.
The event, which was free and open to all Tennesseans, was designed
to provide an easy and fast way for businesses to create a website
and become more visible online. While 97 percent of Internet users look
online for local products and services, 59 percent of Tennessee small
businesses do not have a website or online
presence.
Businesses unable to attend the event
can still create a free website and access relevant resources by
visiting
www.TennesseeGetOnline.com.

Maintaining Focus on Getting Our Fiscal House in
Order
On Thursday, Senator
Corker applauded Senate Appropriations Committee members for standing
firm and voting against the proposed funding levels for individual
Fiscal Year 2015 spending bills, which use budget gimmicks to circumvent
the spending restrictions put in place by the Budget Control Act of
2011.
Relying on budget
gimmicks instead of making tough choices is a cop-out and sends the
message that the Senate doesnt have the discipline, the courage, or
the will to do what we told the American people we would do to try to
get our fiscal house in order. I applaud those members who honored the
commitment we made under the Budget Control Act and voted against the
proposed funding levels in the Appropriations committee, which use
budget tricks to bust the spending caps we promised to uphold, said
Corker.
The Budget Control
Act, passed by Congress and signed into law in 2011, helped reduce
total government spending for two consecutive
years.

Chattanooga Times Free Press: Bob Corkers star on the
ascent
Right now, Corker, a former construction company owner and
developer who served as Tennessees finance commissioner from 1995-96 and
Chattanooga mayor from 2001 to 2005, appears to be having the time of his
political life. Or at least as much as an ambitious guy in a
non-chief executive role can have. Im in a place where I have the tremendous
privilege of waking up every day and being involved in the big issues
that our nation is dealing with both here but also abroad, Corker
said. Read more

Tennessean (Editorial):
A battle royal over pay for music
artists
Lawmakers in Congress are looking to reset at least one aspect of the
unfettered Internet: digital radio services that underpay or pay nothing at
all to the artists whose music they play For Nashville, a city of
songwriters, performers and publishers, this wave of legislation is, well,
music to the ear Last Monday, Sens. Lamar Alexander, Bob Corker of
Tennessee and Orrin Hatch of Utah (himself a published songwriter)
unveiled the Senate version of the Songwriters Equity Act of 2014 to a
music-industry crowd at Nashvilles famed Bluebird Cafe. Read more
