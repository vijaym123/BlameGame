Dear Friend,
Memorial Day offers us all a moment to reflect and honor the fallen heroes who've made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country. We remember their bravery, celebrate their lives, and embrace the families they've left behind. We owe a debt of gratitude to the courageous men and women who have worn our nation's uniform -- answering the call of duty during America's hour of need to keep us safe.
We also recognize the extraordinary sacrifices made by our military families who carry the heavy burden of not having their child, partner, sibling, or parent by their side. As our service members return home from their missions, I will do everything I can to ensure they and their families receive the benefits they have earned.
This occasion is more than just a holiday, it's a time to reaffirm our commitment to our lost heroes so that their memory and honor live on. Our nation is safer because of their selfless sacrifice.
I join you and all New Mexicans in remembering our fallen soldiers, and thank them and their loved ones for the peace and freedom we enjoy every day.
Sincerely,
MARTIN HEINRICH
United States Senator
