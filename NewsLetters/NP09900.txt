Congratulations to the Borough of East Berlin in Adams County on its 250th Anniversary. The Borough was founded on May 8th, 1764 by John Frankenberger, a Prussian, who purchased 200 acres of land from Thomas and Richard Penn. John laid out a town with 85 lots, one main street, 4 cross streets and five alleys. He named the town "Berlin" after his native town in Prussia. "East" was added to the name in 1827 when the town post office was established.
Today, East Berlin Borough is a thriving community of over 1,400 residents. Im proud to congratulate East Berlin on this momentous anniversary and wish the Borough another successful 250 years.
