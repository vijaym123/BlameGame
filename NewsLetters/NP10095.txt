Congressman Jim Oberstar: A Giant of a Man
As Chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure, Congressman Jim Oberstar helped pass legislation to
fund thousands of miles of bicycle and hiking trails, and championed
the National Safe Routes to School Program to encourage kids to walk
and bike to school.
Dear Friend,
Congressman Jim Oberstar's passing over the weekend marked a terribly
sad day for all of us. Jim was a giant of a man who devoted himself to
serving others - most especially as a voice and champion for the
forgotten and left behind in our society.
The respect and affection Jim Oberstar's colleagues in the Congress had
for him was simply unparalleled. I will never forget the day he
returned to visit the House floor last year. When he was spied walking
into that historic place, Democrats and Republicans alike stood up and
cheered for a great bipartisan leader and friend.
Over the course of his long and distinguished service, Jim became
chairman of the House Transportation Committee. With expertise
unmatched in all the intricacies of programs and policies affecting
hundreds of billions of dollars for highways, roads, bridges,
railroads, airports, harbors, and public transit systems, he still rode
his bicycle to work every day.
And no one worked harder than Jim Oberstar. He was always the first
person in the office every morning - and after everyone else had left
in the evening, there would still be a light on in Jim's office.
Jim Oberstar was my friend, my mentor, and my hero. Our nation is truly
a better, more decent, more compassionate place for every day Jim
served so selflessly, with such honor, dignity, and good humor. We
loved him dearly. We will miss him terribly. And we will do our best to
carry on his great work.
Take a minute or two to watch Northland News'
coverage of this sad news.
Our hearts go out to Jean and all of Jim's family.
Sincerely,

A Solid Veterans Bill, Completed On Time
With my full support, the appropriations bill funding veterans programs
through 2016 passed the House last week - good news for our veterans,
and proof we can overcome partisan gridlock in Congress when we put our
minds to it. First and foremost, the bill addresses the unconscionable
veterans claims backlog - moving the Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA) out of the paper world by restructuring and expediting the way
claims are handled. I fought for this during last year's debate, so I'm
glad to see it included here.
The bill also:
.
Expands mental health and suicide prevention programs and
funds VA medical services;
.
Strongly encourages the VA to improve their transportation
services and access to medical care for veterans living in rural areas;
.
Provides funds for veterans housing programs, private sector
home loan guarantees for veterans, along with direct loans to Native
American veterans through the Native American Veterans Housing Loan
Program.
.
Finances education for both active service-members and for
veterans who want to go back to school.
.
Boosts job training and educational opportunities to assist
unemployed vets and vets in transition back to civilian life.
Passing bills to fund the government is one of the most basic duties
Congress has under the Constitution, and this vets bill is the first of
12 we're scheduled to consider this year. Hopefully the Republican
Leadership will continue on a schedule that allows us to get our work
done for the American people - on time for a welcome change.

Mr. President: Biofuel's a Triple Winner
Reps. Cheri Bustos (IL) and Tim Walz (MN) and I at the Executive Office
Building of the White House last week to show our strong support for
the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS).
Biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel play a huge and important role
in getting us closer to energy independence, reducing our dependence on
foreign oil, and lowering our carbon footprint. They also create jobs
in agriculture and in new technologies - 1,532 jobs in Minnesota alone.
However, the EPA's recent rule for the Renewable Fuel Standard Program
(RFS) would lower the amount of ethanol that gasoline companies are
required to mix in with traditional gasoline, hurting both our
environment and Minnesota corn growers. So three Midwestern lawmakers -
Rep. Tim Walz (MN), Rep. Cheri Bustos (IL), and yours truly - met with
senior White House officials last week to show our strong support for
RFS. We intend to keep pushing the Administration hard on this, on
behalf of the 21 ethanol and 5 biodiesel producers in Minnesota,
including Central MN Ethanol Co-op near Little Falls, and across the
country. Click here

Duluth News Tribune: Nolan Bill A "Good Call" for Minnesota's 8th
The American Pipeline Jobs and Safety Act, my bill (covered in the
Duluth News Tribune article above) to require virtually all new
pipelines constructed in the U.S. to use steel that is mined,
processed, or reprocessed in America, is generating lots of interest
here in Washington, as well as at home. I hope you'll also take a
minute or two to read this Duluth News Tribune editorial
, to learn about how this jobs bill is good for the middle class, our
environment, and Minnesota's 8th District economy.

Why Wouldn't You Vote to Raise the Minimum Wage?
Last week, House and Senate Republicans again blocked a vote to raise
the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, up from $7.25, setting us
back yet another step in the battle to make the minimum wage a living
wage. Which begs the question, why wouldn't you vote to raise the
minimum wage? A minimum wage of $10.10 an hour would lift one million
working Americans - and 14 million children - out of poverty. It would
put more money in the pockets of women across the country - who are
two-thirds of minimum wage earners. It would reduce the need for
federal poverty programs we all pay for, while boosting Main Street
businesses.
191 Members of the House of Representatives, including myself, have
signed a petition to force a vote on raising the wage to $10.10. I
promise to keep up the fight to put more money in the pockets of
everyday, working Americans.

First Lady's Luncheon Focuses on Power of Education
My wife, Mary Nolan (far right), attended the Congressional Club's
First Lady Luncheon on Thursday in Washington, along with Cordy Strand
from Aitkin, Sharla Gardner from Duluth, and Tessa Hill from North
Branch.
Last week, my wife Mary Nolan was happy to take three constituents -
Cordy Strand of Aitkin, Sharla Gardner of Duluth, and Tessa Hill of
North Branch - to hear First Lady Michelle Obama speak on the
importance of our nation's education system and how to focus our
efforts on encouraging young people to go to college. As a former high
school teacher and Head Start director, I couldn't agree more: there is
no better investment than the education of our children. Ensuring all
our schools have the best teachers and the latest technologies - like
the new business incubator at Pine Tech College in Pine City and the
soon-to-be-installed video teleconferencing system throughout the Iron
Range - enables future generations of young Americans to compete in a
global market and expanding industries.

Our Week in Pictures
Chairwoman Karen Diver of the Fond du Lac Band of Ojibwe was in my
office last week to discuss H.R.4277, the bill to reauthorize the
Native American Housing Assistance Act (NAHADASA). We took a moment to
proudly pose with my bill - signed by the President into law - allowing
a long-awaited land exchange between the Band and Carlton County to go
forward.
Ken Powell, CEO of General Mills, stopped by to discuss food safety and
nutrition issues.
Here I am with members of the Minnesota State Fire Chiefs Association,
in town for their annual fly-in to discuss SAFER and FIRE Grant
funding, as well as a bill I introduced - the Humanitarian Firefighter
Relief Act - which would ease regulations and import taxes on rescue
and relief equipment used on humanitarian missions abroad.
Derek McPheeters of Isanti, Matt Olson, and Luke Voight of the
International Brotherhood of Boilermakers met with me in my D.C. office
to discuss mining and pipeline issues pertaining to Minnesota's 8th -
including my bill to mandate the use of Iron Range taconite and iron
ore in new energy pipelines made in the U.S.
Members of the Minnesota Bankers Association stopped by my office to
chat with me on the need to keep interest rates low in order to promote
the opening of new businesses, more housing construction in small
towns, and the continued economic vitality of Main Street.

Coming Up in Washington
.
Services for former Congressman Jim Oberstar will be held on
Thursday in Washington, D.C.
.
The End Sex Trafficking Act (H.R.2805), my bill with
Congressman and former Judge, Ted Poe (R-TX), may come before the full
House of Representatives this week or next.
.
We'll be voting on a series of financial services bills this

Rick
Nolan
Congressman
Jim
Oberstar:
A
Giant
of

As
Chairman
of
the
House
Committee
on
Transportation
and
Infrastructure,
Congressman
Jim
Oberstar
helped
pass
legislation
to
fund
thousands
of
miles
of
bicycle
and
hiking
trails,
and
championed
the
National
Safe
Routes
to
School
Program
to
encourage
kids
to
walk
and
bike
to
school.
Dear
Friend,
Congressman
Jim
Oberstar&#8217;s
passing
over
the
weekend
marked
a
terribly
sad
day
for
all
of
us.
Jim
was
a
giant
of
a
man
who
devoted
himself
to
serving
others
&#8211;
most
especially
as
a
voice
and
champion
for
the
forgotten
and
left
behind
in
our
society.
The
respect
and
affection
Jim
Oberstar&#8217;s
colleagues
in
the
Congress
had
for
him
was
simply
unparalleled.
I
will
never
forget
the
day
he
returned
to
visit
the
House
floor
last
year.
When
he
was
spied
walking
into
that
historic
place,
Democrats
and
Republicans
alike
stood
up
and
cheered
for
a
great
bipartisan
leader
and
friend.
Over
the
course
of
his
long
and
distinguished
service,
Jim
became
chairman
of
the
House
Transportation
Committee.
With
expertise
unmatched
in
all
the
intricacies
of
programs
and
policies
affecting
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
for
highways,
roads,
bridges,
railroads,
airports,
harbors,
and
public
transit
systems,
he
still
rode
his
bicycle
to
work
every
day.
And
no
one
worked
harder
than
Jim
Oberstar.
He
was
always
the
first
person
in
the
office
every
morning
&#8211;
and
after
everyone
else
had
left
in
the
evening,
there
would
still
be
a
light
on
in
Jim&#8217;s
office.
Jim
Oberstar
was
my
friend,
my
mentor,
and
my
hero.
Our
nation
is
truly
a
better,
more
decent,
more
compassionate
place
for
every
day
Jim
served
so
selflessly,
with
such
honor,
dignity,
and
good
humor.
We
loved
him
dearly.
We
will
miss
him
terribly.
And
we
will
do
our
best
to
carry
on
his
great
work.
Take
a
minute
or
two
to
watch
Northland
News'
coverage
of
this
sad
news.
Our
hearts
go
out
to
Jean
and
all
of
Jim&#8217;s
family.
Sincerely,
A
Solid
Veterans
Bill,
Completed
On
Time
With
my
full
support ,
the
appropriations
bill
funding
veterans
programs
through
2016
passed
the

last
week
&#8211;
good
news
for
our
veterans ,
and
proof
we
can
overcome
partisan
gridlock
in
Congress
when
we
put
our
minds
to
it.
First
and
foremost,
the
bill
addresses
the
unconscionable
veterans
claims
backlog
-
moving
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
out
of
the
paper
world
by
restructuring
and
expediting
the
way
claims
are
handled.
I
fought
for
this
during
last
year's
debate,
so
I'm
glad
to
see
it
included
here.
The
bill
also:
&#8226;
Expands
mental
health
and
suicide
prevention
programs
and
funds
VA
medical
services;
&#8226;
Strongly
encourages
the
VA
to
improve
their
transportation
services
and
access
to
medical
care
for
veterans
living
in
rural
areas ;
&#8226;
Provides
funds
for
veterans
housing
programs ,
private
sector
home
loan
guarantees
for
veterans,
along
with
direct
loans
to
Native
American
veterans
through
the
Native
American
Veterans
Housing
Loan
Program.
&#8226;
Finances
education
for
both
active
service-members
and
for
veterans
who
want
to
go
back
to
school.
&#8226;
Boosts
job
training
and
educational
opportunities
to
assist
unemployed
vets
and
vets
in
transition
back
to
civilian
life.
Passing
bills
to
fund
the
government
is
one
of
the
most
basic
duties
Congress
has
under
the
Constitution,
and
this
vets
bill
is
the
first
of
12
we're
scheduled
to
consider
this
year.
Hopefully
the
Republican
Leadership
will
continue
on
a
schedule
that
allows
us
to
get
our
work
done
for
the
American
people
&#8211;
on
time
for
a
welcome
change.
Mr.
President:
Biofuel's
a
Triple

Reps.
Cheri
Bustos
(IL)
and
Tim
Walz
(MN)
and
I
at
the
Executive
Office
Building
of
the
White
House
last
week
to
show
our
strong
support
for
the
Renewable

Biofuels
such
as
ethanol
and
biodiesel play
a
huge
and
important
role
in
getting
us
closer
to
energy
independence,
reducing
our
dependence
on
foreign
oil,
and
lowering
our
carbon
footprint.
They
also
create
jobs
in agriculture
and
in
new
technologies
-
1,532
jobs in
Minnesota
alone . However,
the
EPA's
recent
rule
for
the
Renewable
Fuel
Standard
Program
(RFS)
would
lower
the
amount
of
ethanol
that
gasoline
companies
are
required
to
mix
in
with
traditional
gasoline, hurting
both
our
environment
and
Minnesota
corn
growers.
So
three
Midwestern
lawmakers
-
Rep.
Tim
Walz
(MN),
Rep.
Cheri
Bustos
(IL),
and
yours
truly
-
met
with
senior
White

officials
last

to
show
our
strong

for
RFS. We
intend
to
keep
pushing
the

Why
Wouldn't
You
Vote to
Raise
the

Last

to
$10.10
an

why
wouldn't

A
minimum

of
$10.10
an

would
lift
one
million
working
Americans
-
and
14
million

-
out

It
would
put
more
money
in
the
pockets
of
women

-
who
are
two-thirds

It

First
Lady's
Luncheon
Focuses
on
Power
of
Education
My
wife,
Mary
Nolan
(far

attended
the
Congressional
Club's
First
Lady
Luncheon
on
Thursday
in
Washington,
along
with
Cordy
Strand
from

the
importance
of
our
nation's
education
system
and
how
to
focus
our
efforts
on
encouraging
young
people
to
go
to
college.
As
a
former
high
school
teacher
and
Head
Start
director,
I
couldn't
agree
more:
there
is
no
better
investment
than
the
education
of
our
children.
Ensuring
all
our
schools
have
the
best
teachers
and
the
latest
technologies
-
like
the
new
business
incubator
at
Pine
Tech
College
in
Pine
City
and
the
soon-to-be-installed
video
teleconferencing
system
throughout
the
Iron

-
enables
future
generations
of
young
Americans
to
compete
in
a
