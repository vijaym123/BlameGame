White House Extends March 31 st
Health Insurance Deadline for Applicants in Line Only
Dear Friend,
I want to make sure you know that the White House has extended the deadline to sign up for health insurance for consumers who are already in line on Healthcare.gov to enroll but have not been able to complete their application due to high volume or a technical issue.
The take home point is that people should not hesitate to start their health insurance application for fear of missing the deadline.
If you begin your application, whether online, by phone, or in person before March 31 st , you will be able to receive health coverage.
Dont wait until the last minute if you do not have coverage and take advantage of this opportunity to get insurance, regardless of your previous health history.
For the first time ever, no one can be turned away when they apply for health insurance.
In our communities, where many people do not have insurance and getting sick can risk a familys financial stability , this is truly important.
The deadline to receive coverage still remains March 31 st .
However, those consumers who are already in line in the system to receive coverage or who have complex casework needs will be accommodated.
For more information, visit

or

Sincerely,
Henry Cuellar
