Week in Review
Dear Friends,
Welcome to this week's edition of Week in Review.
It's been a busy week in Central New York and in Washington, and I'm happy to share some of the highlights with you.
Honor Flight Syracuse
Last weekend, Robin and I had the pleasure of welcoming home 81 Honor Flight Syracuse Veterans
who participated in the Mission 005 visit to Washington D.C.
This event was an amazing tribute to all of the men and women who participated, and to all who have served our country.
On the Floor
In honor of Mental Health Month, I spoke on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives to highlight the need for greater access to mental health care.
I've made it a priority to foster a local discussion on mental health services in Central New York.
Together with New York State Assemblyman Bill Magnarelli, I've
launched a task force
to find ways to strengthen access to pediatric mental health care in our community.
This week, the House began the appropriations process for the 2016 Fiscal Year.
The House passed the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill, legislation that provides funding to equip and train our military personnel, ensure that our veterans receive high quality care, and provide the necessary infrastructure to ensure that our military is maintained.
With my support, the House also passed the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.
This legislation improves infrastructure while supporting energy independence and boosting national security.
Importantly, it also provides funding for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for navigation projects and flood and storm damage repair.
Transportation Security Subcommittee Hearing
I chaired a hearing of the Transportation Security Subcommittee
on Access Control Measures at our Nation's Airports.
This hearing built upon a hearing that I conducted earlier this Congress on security programs designed to mitigate insider threats from airport employees, airline employees, TSA personnel, and others who have access to sterile areas of domestic airports. Click

Around
Central New York
I toured the facilities at ProLiteracy
to learn about the programs that they provide in Central New York to promote adult literacy.
We had a wonderful discussion on addressing the needs of adult learners in our community.
I had a great conversation with SU students
at a forum hosted by the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs on Current Trends in Forensic and National Security Sciences, where I discussed my career as a prosecutor and the work I've done in Congress on the Committee on Homeland Security.
Thanks to all of the local students who participated in the NY-24 Congressional Art Competition!
This week, our distinguished group of judges from across NY-24 reviewed the many submissions that our office received. The winning work of art will hang in the U.S. Capitol for a full year.
I'll be announcing the winner soon!
As always, thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter!
Sincerely,
John Katko (NY-24)
Member of Congress
