Friends,
I hope you enjoyed time with your family and friends
over the Thanksgiving holiday last week. While I was certainly happy to
be back home, I went back to DC on Monday ready for a busy and
productive week ahead. Here's a look at some of the important things we
accomplished:
Executive Amnesty Prevention
Act
I joined with my colleagues in the House to pass
a bill
which will block President Obama's
executive action on immigration. I think everybody would agree that our
immigration system is broken and must be fixed. As a former
prosecutor, I believe firmly in the rule of law, and we certainly need to
change the laws of our broken immigration system. However, as our founding
fathers laid out, these changes must come
from Congress, and not by an overreaching President.
Achieving A
Better Life Experience Act
With overwhelming
bipartisan support the House passed the
ABLE
Act
by a margin of 404-17. The Achieving a Better Life
Experience (ABLE) Act is a common sense solution that will
provide families with severely disabled children some piece of mind. The
ABLE Act allows parents of those born with disabilities to set up
tax-exempt investment accounts to save for qualified expenses, such as
long-term medical, housing, post-secondary education and transportation
needs. I cosponsored this bill because it makes
it easier for
millions of families to save for their
future.
I know it sometimes seems like all that
happens in Congress is gridlock and ugly politics, so I was glad to see a large
majority of my colleagues come together and just do the right thing for
millions of families across the country.
National
Defense Authorization Act
I voted to pass the
NDAA
which provides funding for our military
and other national security programs. As the son of a World War II
veteran, I have a deep respect for our armed services who put their lives
at risk everyday, and I proudly voted for this legislation to
ensure that our military has the necessary resources to protect themselves
and our country around the globe.
I remain
humbled by the opportunity to serve
you,
Sincerely,
Dave
