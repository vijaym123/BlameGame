Dear
Friends,
Labor Day weekend is a time to relax with family and
friends. I hope you all take time this weekend to enjoy this amazing
state we call home.
August in New Mexico:
4,000-mile month
August was a productive month as my staff
and I drove nearly 4,000 miles across the district, and throughout the
state. We visited with constituents and met with local officials
about the important issues that face New Mexicans today.
Of
the 30 public meetings I held, one of the highlights was
the Congressional Field Hearing in Roswell on Aug. 6. Chairman of the
Committee on Veterans Affairs Rep. Jeff Miller, of Florida, Rep. Doug
Lamborn, of Colorado, and I conducted the one-day hearing. Roswell-area
veterans and Albuquerque VA Medical Center administrators testified,
as we examined the challenges rural
veterans face receiving medical care, making appointments and getting access to
local facilities.
Also, Chairman Miller and I met with
administrators at Lovelace Regional Hospital and Eastern New Mexico
Medical Center to discuss the launch of a pilot project in
Roswell. This pilot project allows rural veterans the ability to get medical
care from local providers. This project is a first for the
nation, and was a program I fought for eight years to provide.
I want to thank Chairman Miller, Rep. Lamborn, the Albuquerque VA
staff, and all veterans, who attended the field hearing. This
historic event brought the community together, and provided us with vital
testimony about how we serve our rural veterans. Legislation that
was signed into law in August, to reform the Department of Veterans
Affairs, will allow our pilot project to move forward and make
substantial changes to the VA system.
Other notable events
included my tour of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC)
in Artesia, a tour of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in
Carlsbad and participation in a town hall with Department of Energy
Secretary Ernest Moniz. I also met with military and El Paso VA Health Center
officials at Fort Bliss, and with Border Patrol in El Paso for a
tour.
I held nearly 25 meetings on policy-specific issues,
attended several public ceremonies, and visited 12 counties.
I connected with nearly 30,000 constituents during a tele-town hall, held town
halls in Hobbs and Cloudcroft, and held community
meet-and-greets in other cities. We also made more than 50 media stops at
newspapers, radios and television stations.
September: Jobs and the
Economy
As we
look to September, a record number of Americans find themselves forced
into temporary or part-time employment. One of my main goals continues
to be to create good-paying jobs for New Mexicans. I will push for
real solutions to get New Mexicans working and America back on
course. In the district, we will seek every opportunity to connect job
seekers with job providers through career fairs and other
events.
In the House, we have sent more than 40 bills to the Senate
that would provide true economic recovery to get Americans back to work.
These bills reduce regulatory burdens on businesses, help small
businesses access capital, and make permanent a series of tax provisions to
grow our economy. The House will continue to push for common-sense job
recovery and pursue further legislation. We still need to work to
make jobs easier to come by, and we need to ease federal regulations on
employers.
I am deeply concerned about protecting our
American way of life. When President Obama took office, buying a gallon of
gas cost us an average of $1.85. Now, we pay an average of $3.52. Think
about how much extra it cost our friends and family to enjoy this
holiday weekend. We paid more for gas, groceries and many items on
our shopping list because of the disastrous economic policies we've
seen in the past few years. We cannot afford a government that
overburdens our farmers and ranchers, oil workers and producers, our businesses
and our hard-working citizens.
I will continue to push
for real solutions for New Mexicans and to protect the freedoms
we hold dear.
Have you heard "Congressional Review" this week?
Every
weekend, I'm on the radio across New Mexico discussing important
legislation, events in New Mexico, and my work in Congress.
Be sure to
tune in!
If you haven't heard the show, call your local radio
station to ask when Congressional Review is on the air in your
hometown. ?xml:namespace prefix = o

Remember, I always look forward to hearing your
thoughts on how to help job growth, veterans, and other issues important to
New Mexicans.
