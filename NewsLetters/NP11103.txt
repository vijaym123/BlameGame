About Tim

News and Media
Friends,
Thank for you subscribing to my e-newsletter.
I appreciate the
opportunity to share news from Washington and at home with you and am
always glad to receive your comments and questions as well.
Protecting the First Amendment
Our First Amendment is a hallmark of American freedom, but the free
speech rights it guarantees are unfortunately not yet universally
shared.
For years, the free and open internet developed by Americans has become
vitally important to people throughout the world as a method of sharing
ideas, news, and technology.
For that reason, I am extremely concerned
about the Obama
administration's proposal to hand over its oversight one of the
internet's most powerful institutions, ICANN, from America to the
global community. Read more here
.
I talked with Greta Van Susteren on Fox News this week on the
importance of preserving our free and open internet-watch the clip
below.

Creating Jobs and American Energy
The Greenville News ran a thoughtful editorial recently on a topic that
is becoming increasingly important to our state and our nation-American
energy production.
Our country should never be limited by our need for
foreign energy when we have so much here at home that is ready and
waiting to create jobs and pump much needed revenue into our economies.
Industry sources have estimated that oil drilling off of the Atlantic
Coast could contribute $2.7 billion dollars into South Carolina's
economy by 2035.

Around South Carolina
This past week, I have visited the School of the Arts and Academic
Magnet School in North Charleston, talked with a 5th grade class at
Grove Elementary in Piedmont via Skype, given the closing prayer at the
Piedmont Women's Center Annual Banquet, celebrated BMW's expansion
announcement in South Greer, visited ABB Baldor Motor Manufacturing in
Greenville, and guest lectured at Wofford College on healthcare with my
good friend Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC).

I am honored to serve as your voice in the United States Senate.
Please don't hesitate to contact my office with suggestions, questions,
or if we can be of service to you.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott
