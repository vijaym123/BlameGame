Friends,
I wanted to share with you that Congressional Quarterly Magazine ranked
me as one of the top five Republicans in the House of Representatives
who has consistently opposed President Barack Obama's agenda.
The Fourth District of Tennessee sent me to Washington with a clear
message: Hold the line against President Obama and his radical vision
for our country. I promise I will never forget that.
Conservatives in Congress are truly the last line of defense. If we
don't put up a fight against President Obama and his far left allies,
then who will?
Thank you for your continued support, it's an honor to serve you.
Respectfully,
Congressman Scott DesJarlais, MD
