Rokita Readings
A clickable offering of books and articles that I've read recently and
highly recommend, as we strive together to "Keep the Republic."
Featured in this week's Rokita Readings is a column sent to me by a
good friend by Holman Jenkins, Jr. titled "How the GOP Should Fix
ObamaCare
."
Jenkins' column is a good explanation of how, why, and when our
government-run health care system came to be.
At its core, ObamaCare
is a massive redistribution of wealth.
It relies on forcing people to
purchase new health care plans that far exceed what the individual
wants or needs to subsidize plans for others.
Jenkins proposes an
thoughtful plan that could garner Democrat support.
This is an
interesting piece and worth your time to read.
Let me know what you
think on my Facebook page.

Reforming the Budget and Preventing Another Obama-Reid Shutdown
This week the House passed bipartisan budget legislation to fund the
remainder of Fiscal Year 2014 and 2015.
The budget deal was reached by
a conference committee established by the short-term funding agreement
reached earlier this year to end the government shutdown.
The Bipartisan Budget Act would set funding levels at $1.012 trillion -
roughly halfway between the proposed spending levels of the
Senate-passed budget and the House-passed budget that I authored
earlier this year.
The budget also reforms the way in which
sequestration cuts are applied and in other areas of the budget.
I spoke on the House floor in support of this budget agreement before
its passage.
You can view those remarks here
.
This budget is a better deal than the current sequestration law because
it makes spending reforms that cut more than sequester will and will
continue on after sequestration is scheduled to expire.
The reforms,
and therefore budget savings, start immediately and compound over time.
Since mandatory social entitlement spending is driving our debt, this
budget is a step in the right direction, and a good springboard for the
immense amount of reform work yet to be done.
Finally, this budget prevents President Obama and Harry Reid from
staging another shutdown so they can distract from the failures of
ObamaCare.
Key Spending Reforms in the Budget Agreement
Eliminates unemployment benefits for criminals
Ends government payments to the deceased
Requires dead-beat dads to pay their children's outstanding Medicaid
bills
Requires federal employees to contribute more to their retirement -
in line with private sector standards
Increases the contribution private companies must pay to guarantee
their pension benefits under the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.
These important reforms yield $28 billion in additional savings
compared to current law.
While this is a modest step forward, I will
continue working to enact substantial, structural reforms to the
biggest drivers of our debt - Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.
For more information on the budget legislation, including legislative
texts, please visit the House Budget Committee website here

Fighting Red Tape - General Aviation Pilot Protection Act
This week, I introduced the General Aviation Pilot Protection Act,
bipartisan legislation that would require the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) to revise a rule that incurs unnecessary costs and
requirement on private pilots.
As a pilot myself, I am pleased to introduce this important legislation
with my colleagues and fellow pilots.
The unnecessary Third Class
Medical certification regulation drives up costs for pilots and
prevents the general aviation industry from fulfilling its economic
potential.
Fixing this revises those requirements, essentially
expanding the comparable driver's license medical requirements to
private pilots, and allows greater access for pilots to fly.
I'm pleased to have the support of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots
Association
(AOPA), Experimental Aircraft Association
, and the General Aviation Manufacturers Association
.
Learn more about the bill here and AOPA's support of the bill

"You Can Keep Your Plan" - The Politifact "Lie of the Year" - ObamaCare
Insurance Cancellations Continue
It has been widely reported that millions of Americans are being sent
cancellation notices of their insurance policies
due to ObamaCare.
Just this week, the nonpartisan
political fact-finding site, Politifact.com ranked the President's
claim that, "if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep your
plan," the "Lie of the Year.
"
This lie is one that he reused
time and again in selling ObamaCare and seeking reelection.
Yet,
cancellations keep arriving in mailboxes all over the country.
These cancellations are just the tip of the iceberg of this insidious
law.
Hoosiers are seeing rate increases, hours and jobs being cut, and
health benefits are changing so rapidly that many are unsure of exactly
what coverage they will have in the new year.
I recently received a note from Terri who works for a health care
provider in Indiana.
Terri recently had her hours cut, but her
deductible went from $0 to $500 per year, and her premium rose from $96
to $121 per pay period.
She is frustrated by the changes ObamaCare has
made to her health insurance and she have every right to be.
This is
the direct opposite of what the President promised and that's why this
law is, by definition
, insidious.
If you or someone you know has had a similar experiences due to
ObamaCare, please send me your story, your cancellation notice, or rate
increase documents at InsuranceCancellations@mail.house.gov.

Thank you for your continued interest in Congress and for supporting my
efforts in Washington. Take care.

Todd Rokita

This

-
roughly
halfway
between
the
proposed
spending
levels
of
the

and
the
House-passed
budget
that
I
authored
earlier
this

The
budget
also
reforms
the
way
in
which sequestration
cuts
are
applied
and
in
other
areas
of
the
budget.
I
spoke
on
the
House

in
support
of
this
budget
agreement
before
its

This

because
it

Fighting
Red
Tape
-
General
Aviation
Pilot
Protection
Act
This
week,
I
introduced
the
General
Aviation
Pilot
Protection
Act,
bipartisan
legislation
that
would
require
the
Federal
Aviation
Administration
(FAA)
to
revise
a
rule
that
incurs
unnecessary
costs
and
requirement
on
private
pilots.
As
a
pilot
myself,
I
am
pleased
to
introduce
this
important
legislation
with
my
colleagues
and
fellow
pilots.
The
unnecessary
Third
Class
Medical
certification
regulation
drives
up
costs
for
pilots
and
prevents
the
general
aviation
industry
from
fulfilling
its
economic
potential.
Fixing
this
revises
those
requirements,
essentially
expanding the
comparable driver's
license
medical
requirements
to
private
pilots,
and
allows
greater
access
for
pilots
to
fly.
I'm
pleased
to
have
the
support
of
the
Aircraft
Owners
and
Pilots
Association
(AOPA),
Experimental
Aircraft
Association ,
and
the
General
Aviation

Continue
It has
been

Just
