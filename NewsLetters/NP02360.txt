Dear Friends,
On Tuesday, the House of Representatives passed a bill to fund the
Department of Homeland Security through September 2015. Unfortunately,
the bill that passed in the House did not include the provisions I
voted for last week in the Senate to reverse the president's November
2014 executive actions on immigration.
I could not support taking the immigration
provisions out of the legislation, and I will continue to do all I can
to stop the president's executive action on amnesty because I do not
believe this fight is over.
Stopping Federal Labor Board Overreach
On Wednesday, I voted for American businesses and American workers on
a resolution of disapproval to
stop a federal labor board from implementing a harmful new rule to
allow "ambush elections"
that would give union organizers the upper
hand in union representation elections, harming employers and employees
alike. As a co-sponsor of this resolution, I am pleased that it passed.
No Taxpayer Funding for Abortions
I also recently co-sponsored the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortions Act
to prohibit your tax dollars from funding
abortions. This legislation helps not only ensure that this prohibition
is permanent and that it applies to Obamacare, but also allows
Georgians who value life to have a clear understanding of which plans
under Obamacare cover elective abortion procedures. It is time this
administration provides transparency to taxpayers as to where their
hard-earned dollars go.
Fighting for Better Trade, Middle Class Jobs
In 2014, Georgia set a new record for exports at $39.4 billion and
helped the United States achieve record high exports for goods and
services in 2014 for a total of $2.35 trillion. This week, I encouraged
my colleagues to remove
barriers to
trade agreements and support trade promotion authority. All three
ongoing trade negotiations mean jobs for Georgia and for our country.
The more businesses we share, the more
exchanges of our currency, the better off our country is, the better
off our security is and the better off the jobs for people in the
middle class.
Trade promotion authority would allow Congress to explicitly outline
its expectations, negotiating objectives, and consultation requirements
for negotiations that the president enters into with trading partners.
What's on Tap
Next week, the Senate will vote on legislation that would help put an
end to human trafficking and modern slavery around the globe.
Sincerely,
Johnny Isakson

Dear
Friends,
On
Tuesday,
the
House
of
Representatives
passed
a
bill
to
fund
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
through
September
2015.
Unfortunately,
the
bill
that
passed
in
the
House
did
not
include
the
provisions
I
voted
for
last
week
in
the
Senate
to
reverse
the
president's
November
2014
executive
actions
on
immigration.
I
could
not
support
taking
the
immigration
provisions
out
of
the
legislation,
and
I
will
continue
to
do
all
I
can
to
stop
the
president's
executive
action
on
amnesty
because
I
do
not
believe
this
fight
is
over.
Stopping
Federal
Labor
Board
Overreach
On
Wednesday,
I
voted
for
American
businesses
and
American
workers
on
a
resolution
of
disapproval
to
stop
a
federal
labor
board
from
implementing
a
harmful
new
rule
to
allow
"ambush

that
would
give
union
organizers
the
upper
hand
in
union
representation
elections,
harming
employers
and
employees
alike.
As
a
co-sponsor
of
this
resolution,
I
am
pleased
that
it
passed.
No
Taxpayer
Funding
for
Abortions
I
also
recently
co-sponsored
the
No
Taxpayer
Funding
for
Abortions
Act
to
prohibit
your
tax
dollars
from
funding
abortions.
This
legislation
helps
not
only
ensure
that
this
prohibition
is
permanent
and
that
it
applies
to
Obamacare,
but
also
allows
Georgians
who
value
life
to
have
a
clear
understanding
of
which
plans
under
Obamacare
cover
elective
abortion
procedures.
It
is
time
this
administration
provides
transparency
to
taxpayers
as
to
where
their
hard-earned
dollars
go.
Fighting
for
Better
Trade,
Middle
Class
Jobs
In
2014,
Georgia
set
a
new
record
for
exports
at
$39.4
billion
and
helped
the
United
States
achieve
record
high
exports
for
goods
and
services
in
2014
for
a
total
of
$2.35
trillion.
This
week,
I
encouraged
my
colleagues
to
remove
barriers
to
trade
agreements
and
support
trade
promotion
authority.
All
three
ongoing
trade
negotiations
mean
jobs
for
Georgia
and
for
our
country.
The
more
businesses
we
share,
the
more
exchanges
of
our
currency,
the
better
off
our
country
is,
the
better
off
our
security
is
and
the
better
off
the
jobs
for
people
in
the
middle
class.
Trade
promotion
authority
would
allow
Congress
to
explicitly
outline
its
expectations,
negotiating
objectives,
and
consultation
requirements
for
negotiations
that
the
president
enters
into
with
trading
partners.
What's
on
Tap
Next
week,
the
Senate
will
vote
on
legislation
that
would
help
put
an
end
to
human
trafficking
and
modern
slavery
around
the
globe.
