Veterans Day
Today, America honors the men and
women who have bravely served our nation in uniform. We remember the
sacrifices of so many, and all that they mean for our
country.
Last week, I had the opportunity to visit and share a meal with some
of our troops currently serving in Afghanistan. I was instantly
reminded of the sacrifices they freely accept to be there
leaving their
homes and their loved ones and putting their lives on the line every day
so we may enjoy the rights and liberties we hold
dear.
Our country would be much different today if it were not for the
selfless service of so many who made it their responsibility to defend
America and our values. From the earliest revolutionaries, to those
returning from Iraq and Afghanistan today, we owe all our former
servicemembers a great debt of gratitude.
My heartfelt thanks goes to
all the men and women who have served our country in the armed forces,
and may God continue to bless those serving
today.
Sincerely,
Adam Kinzinger
