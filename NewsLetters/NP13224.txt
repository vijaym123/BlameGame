News from Representative Lou Barletta
Monday, January 13, 2014
As you may know, under the Employer Mandate Provision of the Affordable
Care Act (ACA), employers with 50 or more employees must provide health
insurance or pay penalties.
I have been concerned that since the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) currently views volunteer firefighters
as employees, fire companies and municipalities would be forced to
provide health insurance or pay a fine, saddling them with unbearable
financial burdens and threatening public safety.
This past Friday, January 10th, I received a letter from the IRS in
response to my letter concerning the treatment of volunteer
firefighters under the ACA, which stated "...the forthcoming final
regulations generally will not require volunteer hours of bona fide
volunteer firefighters and volunteer emergency medical personnel at
government entities or tax-exempt organizations to be counted when
determining an employer's full-time employees or full-time equivalent
employees."
I am pleased the IRS has finally issued guidance on a question I have
been seeking answers to for months.
I first learned about this issue
from a volunteer firefighter back home, which originally prompted my
letter to the IRS.
After receiving no answer from the IRS, I began a
crusade to end the uncertainty that the ACA was causing volunteer
firefighters, firehouses, and municipalities across Pennsylvania and
the country.
This led to my introduction of the Protecting Volunteer
Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act (H.R. 3685
), which would specifically
exempt volunteer firefighters and emergency responders from the
Employer Mandate Provision of the ACA.
In the end, common sense prevailed and firehouses won't have to shut
their doors.
