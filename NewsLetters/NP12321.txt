Dear
Friends:
Many of you
attended my education summit at the beginning of the school year at
McHenry County College on the Common Core State Standards in English and
math.
After hearing
from summit participants and doing ongoing research into the issue, I
have been greatly concerned about efforts by President Obama and his
administration to lure or force states into adopting the Common Core
education standards.
Please watch my video below on why I have become an original co-sponsor of
H. Res. 476 , a House resolution which denounces
federal coercion of states into adopting the standards.
(Click picture to watch
video)
And please let me
know about your personal experiences with the Common Core by emailing me
through my website at Hultgren.house.gov.
We must all ensure parents and teachersnot
government bureaucratshave the ultimate say in
education.
As always, thank you for the honor and
privilege of serving you.
In Your Service,
Randy Hultgren
Member of
