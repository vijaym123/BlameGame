Since 2009, stores have been required to include country of origin
labeling (COOL) on unprepared or raw foods, such as fresh fruits and
vegetables, a variety of nuts, and ground or cuts of beef, chicken,
pork and lamb.
The rules, based on the 2002 Farm Bill, have been
the source of controversy among some livestock producers and actions
against the U.S. within the World Trade Organization (WTO) from Canada
and Mexico.
The WTO ruled May 18 against the U.S. and determined
that U.S. COOL regulation harms trade obligations with Canada and
Mexico.
The ruling comes after four years of back-and-forth
within the WTO and several USDA revisions to COOL.
The WTOs ruling
will allow Canada and Mexico to impose retaliatory tariffs on products
such as meat and crops.
This could cost U.S. agriculture
billions and could have a
$623 million impact on Missouris
agriculture economy
especially on beef, pork, corn and soybean
producers. Canada has already made threats, stating in 2013 that it
would impose a 100-percent tax on
imported U.S.
commodities .
This could have a large, negative impact on
southwest Missouri, and that is why I am one of the original
co-sponsors of
H.R. 2393 , which would repeal COOL.
A simple repeal would shelter farmers and businesses from undue
burdens Canadian and Mexican sanctions could bring.
These retaliatory
tariffs could deal a blow to the
Missouri Seventh
Districts
$265 million cattle industry and $58 million grains
industry.
I am a firm believer in free trade with other nations
forged through agreements and mutual understanding.
If it were
not for trade between Canada and Mexico in the first place, Missouri-
and American-made goods would have a much smaller market.
After
all, Canada and Mexico are the top two destinations for Missouri-made
merchandise, making up
50 percent
of Missouri
exports value.
This is an instance in maintaining that
understanding, and we must uphold the best policies for Missourians and all
Americans.
Repealing COOL is the best approach to continuing a sound,
beneficial trade partnership among friendly
nations.
