Dear Friend,
As America and
Massachusetts look ahead after a busy Fall season, we need to remain focused
on the challenges that are instrumental to improving the lives of
Americas middle class families. Addressing affordable education and
childcare, equal pay for equal work, raising the minimum wage, providing
earned sick leave and more will help women and families succeed. I
discussed these and more
at two recent events : the
Merrimack Valley Chamber of Commerce Women in Business Conference, and a
roundtable that I hosted in Fitchburg with local women leaders. In
this edition of my Congress in Your Inbox, you can read more about these
events and my efforts to support these critical issues.
In
this edition of the e-Newsletter youll also find photos and
information about the City of Methuens
innovative school
safety technology
that is aimed at preventing gun violence. There
is also information about the need to better fund the
National Institutes of Health
and a video of my discussion with
General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, about
American military action against ISIL in Iraq and
Syria . And I had to include some photos of my visit to the Hennessey
School in Lawrence, where I had breakfast with kids in the
Breakfast in the Classroom program !
As always, I
look forward to your feedback via
my website , or
on
Facebook
and
Twitter.
Thanks for staying engaged and
enjoy this week's edition of
Congress in your
Inbox.
Sincerely,
Niki
Tsongas

HENNESSEY
SCHOOL IN LAWRENCE
On November 12, I had a wonderful
breakfast with students in the Breakfast in the Classroom program at
Lawrences Hennessey School. Increasing childrens access to
nourishing food where they live and learn is essential to combating childhood
hunger and keeping our kids healthy.
