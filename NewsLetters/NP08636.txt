Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
As summer approaches, many families, individuals, and groups plan trips to our nations capital. Last week, the Fritts family from Orlando was visiting Washington, and stopped by to see my office and take a picture. My staff provided them with a personal tour of the Capitol building, and it is always a pleasure to meet constituents who are visiting from Central Florida. If you are planning to visit Washington, please feel free to
go to my website
or call my staff at 202.225.2176.

Winning students and teachers from Westside Tech Centers Cooking up Change program were in Washington last week preparing for a final competition sponsored by the Department of Education. The Cooking up Change program was started in 2007 and challenges high school culinary students to use their creativity in preparing healthy school meals from the ingredients and equipment commonly found in school kitchens. The students must meet national nutritional standards and budget restrictions for schools, while producing healthy meals their peers would enjoy.

Transportation is a critical aspect of our Central Florida economy. Last week, I spoke with a group of contractors from the Florida Transportation Builders Association about the reforms necessary for long term certainty in the infrastructure construction business.
Other meetings that I participated in last week included:
-	Veterans Association of Real Estate Professionals
-	Equipment Leasing and Finance Association
-	Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC)
-	Truck Renting and Leasing Association
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
A constituent from Winter Garden contacted my office regarding the petitions she had filed with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on behalf of her parents. The petitions had been pending since 2012, and my office submitted a status inquiry to USCIS, and was finally able to track down which office had jurisdiction of the case.
Last October, the application was approved for the constituents father, and his green card was mailed to him. My office continued to follow up and monitor the mothers case and is happy to report that USCIS recently mailed her green card as well.
Constituent Services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.

Legislative Update:
Last week, the House of Representatives passed the
Veteran Access to Care Act,
which I co-sponsored, to direct the VA to enter into contracts with non-VA health providers for veterans who live more than 40 miles or have waited or will wait longer than the established acceptable wait-times. It also ensures VA managers will not receive bonuses during this reform effort. This legislation realizes the same pro-active, private care alternative that I
encouraged Acting Secretary Sloan Gibson
to immediately implement following his appointment as acting head of the VA.
While the VA undergoes systemic changes to its health care delivery and scheduling processes, it is critical that we ensure vets have the access to the care they were promised.
The
Veteran Access to Care Act
does just that by opening another avenue for vets to receive the timely, quality medical care they deserve.
Those responsible for this catastrophe will be held accountable, but my primary focus is making this right for veterans who served our country.
The House also passed H.R. 2072, the
Demanding Accountability for Veterans Act of 2013 , last week to require the Inspector General of the VA to identify improvements to VA public health or safety issues that have been recommended but not implemented, and identify the VA managers responsible for instituting these necessary reforms.
