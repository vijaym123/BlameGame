Congressman Andrews Honors Veterans at 23rd Annual Pearl Harbor
Commemoration
HADDON HEIGHTS, N.J. -Today, Congressman Rob Andrews hosted his 23rd
Annual Pearl Harbor Day Commemoration at the Battleship New Jersey to
remember the sacrifice of the 2,251 Americans killed and 1,119
Americans injured 72 years ago in the attack at Pearl Harbor, and to
recall the lessons we learned from this grim day in our nation's
history. On December 7, 1941, America experienced a shock that would
not again be felt until September 11, 2001. The Pearl Harbor generation
reminds us to be constantly vigilant and prepared for threats to our
nation's security, and to cherish the gifts of hope and freedom that we
enjoy today.
At the event, Congressman Andrews was joined by veterans, constituents
and friends to honor those who served in Pearl Harbor, and to remember
their courage and dedication to our country. Alex Horanzy from
Philadelphia, who survived the attack at Pearl Harbor, joined the
ceremony to share his account of the terrible events that transpired
that day. Helping to celebrate those heroes was the Eastern Regional
High School band that played "Amazing Grace," as Andrews placed a
memorial wreath in honor of the fallen, followed by a 21-gun salute and
the playing of Taps.
"The attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 caught America by surprise and
devastated the nation," said Congressman Andrews. "Still, Americans
rallied together to work at home and abroad to defeat the evil Axis
Powers that threatened global peace. The drive and determination of the
veterans of the 1941 generation parallels that of the current
generation of service members who have sacrificed so much in the name
of protecting our freedoms against the threat posed by global terror.
We will never forget that day which will forever live in infamy, and
today we pay tribute to all who have fought and sacrificed for our
nation's freedom."
As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, Congressman Andrews
will continue to work in Washington to honor the service of our
veterans and put every effort forward to ensure that the needs of our
heroes are addressed when they return home.
Andrews Announces Gloucester City Fire Department to Receive $267k to
Hire Firefighters
HADDON HEIGHTS, N.J. - Today, Congressman Rob Andrews announced that
the Gloucester City Fire Department will receive a total of $267,138 to
hire new firefighters. Awarded under the Staffing for Adequate Fire and
Emergency Response (SAFER) federal program, this grant is intended to
support the hiring of firefighters and assist in the recruitment and
retention of volunteer firefighters.
The SAFER program enables fire
departments to be staffed and prepared 24 hours a day to ensure our
communities have sufficient protection from fires and fire-related
hazards.
Through a competitive grant process, the SAFER program provides $320
million to help communities throughout our country meet their emergency
response needs without placing an additional burden on their local
budgets.
At least twenty percent of the funding is allocated for the
recruitment and retention of firefighters and for volunteer fire
departments.
At least fifteen percent is set aside for the hiring of
new firefighters to ensure fire departments are appropriately staffed
in order to handle emergencies.
"This boost in hiring funds will allow Gloucester City to add
firefighters to its roster without having to raise taxes on families or
make harmful cuts," said Congressman Andrews. "At a time when South
Jersey communities try to make do with less, it's grants like these
from the federal government that put them over the top and give their
budgets the help they need to keep the public safe and grow jobs."
SAFER grants are awarded on a competitive basis that evaluates a
department's financial needs, as well as the extent to which an
application aligns with the priorities of the program.
