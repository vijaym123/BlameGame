Friend,
If you just looked at the numbers, you&rsquo;d think we wouldn&rsquo;t have a chance.
After all, Republicans have been attacking me for months, and they&rsquo;ve spent over $10 million just since August.
But here&rsquo;s the thing: even after all that cash and all those negative ads, there&rsquo;s 9 days to go and our race is too close to call.
You&rsquo;ve kept us in this race, friends. You fought back when our opponents attacked, and you chipped in when we needed you most.
I can&rsquo;t thank you enough for all you&rsquo;ve done so far. Truly, your support means the world to me.
But we&rsquo;re not done yet.
I need you to help us break the tie and bring home a win for Sacramento County.
