Friend,
Today, on National Minimum Wage Day, government officials and non-profit organizations around the country are calling for an increase in the federal minimum wage.
Every American in our great country deserves a fair chance at success.
A minimum wage that allows workers to provide for their families helps to ensure equality of opportunity in the United States.
In 2007, the minimum wage was set at $7.25 an hour.
But taking inflation into account, the minimum wage is more than 30 percent lower today than it was in 1968.
H.R. 1010, the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2013, would raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour.
The bill would also tie the minimum wage to inflation, so that workers would not see their income eroded as time passes.
If the minimum wage is increased to $10.10, 25 million workers would see an increase in pay and 5-6 million people would be lifted out of poverty.
Increasing the minimum wage would also strengthen our economy.
It would generate $22 billion in additional economic activity and create 85,000 new jobs.
At the start of 2014, 13 states increased their minimum wages.
These states are now experiencing greater job growth than states that maintained their minimum wage levels.
I firmly believe that every American should be able to earn a wage that allows them to provide the basic comforts of a dignified life for themselves and their families.
People deserve a fair reward for their hard work and I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 1010.
It is time to reduce poverty and improve our economy by raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour.
Sincerely,
