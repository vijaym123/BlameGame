Hello,
I was happy to be back home in
Ohio's 14th Congressional District this week for a "District Work Week".
When Congress isn't in session, I am able to work here at home and
throughout the district so I can really hear from my
constituents.
When I am home I spend my time traveling
the district to meet with constituents, speak with different groups,
tour local businesses and a whole host of other events.
This is my favorite part of the job because it
is where I can really hear what people think, meet with those who are
directly affected by the legislation we are debating in Congress, and
see firsthand all of the great ideas and products coming out of
Northeast Ohio.
The 14th District
contains all of Geauga, Lake and Ashtabula County, and parts of Summit,
Cuyahoga, Portage and Trumbull County. We have an
interactive map
on our website if you'd like to see it further.
Here's a look at some of what I did this
week:
Hosted a roundtable
with local veterans to hear about their experiences with the VA, and to
learn what I can to do help them at the federal
level.
I hosted a Small Business Seminar in Brecksville in
conjunction with the Small Business Administration to teach people
about starting a small business or help them with any hurdles they may
currently face. State Senator Frank LaRose, who is also the Economic
Development Director for the City of Brecksville, is pictured above and
helped us with the
seminar.
Meeting with
the Association of Mature American Citizens in Stow on
Wednesday
I stopped by the Twinsburg Senior
Center on Monday to visit with some of the members of our Greatest
Generation.
I had a chance to tour
Frost Glass , a great company in Mantua that makes
some amazing glass products. Here I am with the owners, Carrie &amp;
Patrick Frost, and some of their innovative
designs.
Speaking with the Twinsburg Rotary
Club
I met with April Acuna, the new
Executive Director of the Cuyahoga Valley Chamber of Commerce and
discussed how our offices can work together create the best business
environment for our
entrepreneurs.
Speaking with the Aurora Rotary Club
on Wednesday
Morning
I hope you enjoyed seeing what I was up to this week, I work
hard every day to serve and represent you to the best of my ability.
It is an honor to serve you,
Dave
