Dear Friend:
This week, I joined a group of my colleagues and seniors at a press conference highlighting how the Affordable Care Act is helping millions of seniors across the country get better health care and save money. To watch video of our press conference, please click

In California, seniors have saved more than $725 million on their prescriptions since the law was passed &ndash; an average of $900 per senior last year. And more than two million California seniors have received at least one preventive service benefit.
The bottom line is that because of this law, seniors are saving money, they are getting the medications they need and they are getting the health care they deserve.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
