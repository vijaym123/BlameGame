Dear Friend,
The final full shopping week before Christmas has been a busy one for
citizens of Missouri's Fourth Congressional District. In addition to
Christmas shopping with my family, I have spent some time this week
visiting with good citizens in parts of our district.
It was particularly meaningful for me to visit the Truman VA Hospital
in Columbia. Doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals at
Truman VA are working hard, this holiday season, to administer to the
needs of our veterans who are confined to the hospital during the
Christmas holidays.
Truman VA provides a full continuum of excellent care in both patient
and outpatient settings. This facility offers comprehensive primary
care services, medical and surgical specialties, as well as behavioral
health, physical and occupational therapy. It also provides pharmacy
services.
Congresswoman Hartzler joins Truman VA staff and the hospital's Honor
Flight tiger - a gift to the hospital from supporters of the
Honor Flight program that takes our World War II veterans to
Washington, D.C. to see the World War II Memorial on the National Mall.

Truman VA maintains strong affiliations with the University of
Missouri's School of Medicine, its Sinclair School of Nursing, its
School of Health Professions, and other health-related programs. Truman
VA provides training opportunities for some 900 students each year.
The health care professionals and trainees at Truman VA are providing a
service for which simple thanks are insufficient. May God continue to
help these health care providers to improve the lives of our veterans
who are in need of medical services during this Christmas season.
This week also took me to Warsaw, where I had the opportunity to host a
town hall and to hear from citizens who shared their thoughts and
opinions with me. It is a blessing for me to spend time at home in
Missouri's Fourth District where I can hear the common sense that seems
to be so lacking in our Nation's Capital.
Speaking with Charles Willard prior to my town hall meeting in Warsaw
There is no doubt many Washington insiders could benefit from the
Heartland logic that is found in places like Warsaw, Missouri. There is
little doubt our country would be much better off listening to the
insights of Mid-America. I look forward to returning after the holidays
to share this wisdom with others and working for the solutions America
needs and deserves.
Finally, Christmas is approaching and our focus turns to friends and
family. But it is important to keep in mind that the true focus of the
season must be on the reason for the season - the birth of Jesus Christ.
Luke's account of how the birth of Christ was announced to shepherds in
the field is familiar to so many of us:
'And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field,
keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord
came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them; and
they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for,
behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all
people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,
which is Christ the Lord.'
My wish is that the light Jesus brought to the world shines upon you
this Christmas and shines on our men and women in uniform around the
world to keep them safe and bring them home soon.
>From my family to yours, we wish you the merriest of Christmases.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
The
final
full
shopping
week
before
Christmas
has
been
a
busy
one
for
citizens
of
Missouri&#8217;s
Fourth
Congressional
District.
In
addition
to
Christmas
shopping
with
my
family,
I
have
spent
some
time
this
week
visiting
with
good
citizens
in
parts
of
our
district.
It
was
particularly
meaningful
for
me
to
visit
the
Truman
VA
Hospital
in
Columbia.
Doctors,
nurses,
and
other
health

working
hard,
this

of
our

who
are
confined

the

during
the
Christmas

who

in

of
medical
services
during
this
Christmas
season.
This
week
also
took
me
to
Warsaw,
where
I
had
the
opportunity
to
host
a
town
hall
and
to
hear
from
citizens
who
shared
their
thoughts
and
opinions
with
me.
It
is
a
blessing
for
me
to
spend
time
at
home
in
Missouri&#8217;s
Fourth
District
where
I
can
hear
the
common
sense
that
seems
to
be
so
lacking
in
our
Nation&#8217;s
Capital.
Speaking
with
Charles
Willard
prior
to
my
town
hall
meeting
in
Warsaw
There
is
no
doubt
many
Washington
insiders
could
benefit
from
the
Heartland
logic
that
is
found
in
places
like
Warsaw,
Missouri.
There
is
little
doubt
our
country
would
be
much
better
off
listening
to
the
insights
of
Mid-America.
I
look
forward
to
returning
after
the
holidays
to
share
this
wisdom
with
others
and
working
for
the
solutions
America
needs
and
deserves.
Finally,
Christmas
is
approaching
and
our
focus
turns
to
friends
and
family.
But
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
true
focus
of
the
season
must
be
on
the
reason
for
the
season
&#8211;
the
birth
of
Jesus
Christ.
Luke&#8217;s
account
of
how
the
birth
of
Christ
was
announced
to
shepherds
in
the
field
is
familiar
to
so
many
of
us:
&#8216;And
there
were
in
the
same
country
shepherds
abiding
in
the
field,
keeping
watch
over
their
flock
by
night.
And,
lo,
the
angel
of
the
Lord
came
upon
them,
and
the
glory
of
the
Lord
shone
round
about
them;
and
they
were
sore
afraid.
And
the
angel
said
unto
them,
Fear
not:
for,
behold,
I
bring
you
good
tidings
of
great
joy,
which
shall
be
to
all
people.
For
unto
you
is
born
this
day
in
the
city
of
David
a
Saviour,
which
is
Christ
the
Lord.&#8217;
My
wish
is
that
the
light
Jesus
brought
to
the
world
shines
upon
you
this
Christmas
and
shines
on
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
around
the
world
to
keep
them
safe
and
bring
them
home
soon.
From
my
family
to
yours,
we
wish
you
the
merriest
of
Christmases.
