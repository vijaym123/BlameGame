Friends,
Happy
Fathers Day to all of our Seventh District Dads.
God blessed my wife
Wrenzie and me with three wonderful boys who have molded me into the
man I am today.
Although I lost my Father early in life, he
taught me many wonderful things that I have passed on to my boys like
hunting, fishing, and a true love of the outdoors.
Children truly
are a blessing and I hope you have enjoyed celebrating the day with your
families.

House Makes Private Care An Option for VA
Patients
The VA has been under constant
scrutiny recentlyand rightfully so.
An internal audit released on
Monday revealed that our VA system is broken nearly beyond repair.
South Carolinas Dorn Hospital has the
sixth-worst
wait times
among all VA hospitals. Seventh District resident
and VA patient Barry Coates testified before the House Committee on
Veterans Affairs about the deadly wait times and horrific care he
received in our VA hospital.
When discussing solutions to the VAs
backlogs and subpar care, Mr. Coates suggested allowing veterans to
receive private care.
I was proud to support legislation last week
that permits veterans to receive non-VA care if a VA facility is over 40
miles from their home; if they have experienced extensive wait times;
or have been notified that an appointment will not be available within
the VA's wait-time goals.
The Senate considered a similar
version of this bill last week, and I hope that we can quickly reach an
agreement on a long-term fix to the VAs
problems.
Examining Proposed
EPA Regulations
The Transportation and
Infrastructure Subcommittee I serve on held a hearing on Wednesday to
examine the EPA and Army Corps proposed changes to the Clean Water Act
jurisdictional rule.
The agencies claim they proposed these
changes to clarify the existing rule but after reviewing the changes, the
rule seems even more ambiguous.
This seems incredibly
counterproductive. In the video below, I ask the agency representatives to explain
the significance of their ambiguous proposed changes.
