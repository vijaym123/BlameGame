QUOTE OF THE WEEK:
Ed on Obama's upcoming EPA regulations: "I am
deeply concerned the upcoming regulations could have devastating
effects on Americans' ability to secure affordable electricity and the
Chamber's report confirmed what's to come if these regulations are
finalized," said Whitfield.
In addition to previous EPA regulations
that have already contributed to an unprecedented number of coal plant
shutdowns, it is clear these proposed regulations could threaten the
reliability of our nation's power grid, our economic growth, and the
price of power for consumers as we know it. I will continue to fight
President Obama's radical agenda and ensure the EPA's regulatory
assault does not go unchecked."
