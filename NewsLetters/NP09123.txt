Cheyenne Boasts Top Missile Wing
Dear Friends,
I congratulate the 90th Missile Wing stationed at F.E. Warren Air Force Base down in Cheyenne for winning the highly prized Omaha trophy for the third year in a row.
This award goes to the missile wing that has excelled the most at all duties, maneuvers, training, tests, and readiness.
They beat out the wings at Malmstrom up in Montana and Minot over in North Dakota.
Some of the many tasks performed by the Mighty Ninety that were honored by this award were: taking part in the successful launch of two test missiles, completing 105 nuclear convoy missions, identifying a helicopter fix that was implemented fleet-wide, and overseeing 443 weapon system modifications.
The 90th Missile Wings 3,360 airmen and about 975 civilian employees should be proud of the work they do for our national security and the team they make. I know I am.
Please feel free to

about this or other issues you have concerns about.
Sincerely,
Join the conversation! Stay connected to me through
