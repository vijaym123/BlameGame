"Building a Strong Workforce"
By: Senator Susan M. Collins
If you could get a return of $27 for every one dollar that you invested
in a company, you would jump at the chance.
According to United States
Department of Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, that is exactly the return
we get for every federal dollar that is spent on apprenticeship
training programs.
As the Secretary points out, apprenticeships are a
tried and true approach for passing the practical training needed to
succeed in a job on to the next generation.
An apprenticeship is just
as applicable to the complex skills needed to compete in the 21st
century workforce as it was in the 18th century when this country was
founded.
I invited Secretary Perez to come to Maine last week so he could
see apprenticeship programs in action at Bath Iron Works and the
Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.
These two important Maine employers have
instituted apprenticeship programs to attract and train highly skilled
workers that will help keep their operations competitive for years to
come.
It is fitting that these two facilities, so important to our
nations security and our states economic future, are on the
cutting-edge of workforce development.
Secretary Perez has devoted his career to supporting, protecting,
and developing a strong American workforce. His obvious enthusiasm for
improving opportunities for our workers is infectious, and he has a
very clear vision about how job training can lead to a stable and
secure middle-class lifestyle.
Secretary Perez and I began the day at BIW, a 131-year-old
company that depends on highly skilled workers to produce the most
advanced surface combatant ships in the world.
As the current
workforce ages, the shipyard will have to hire many new workers in the
years ahead. The leaders from the company and the trade unions
recognized the need to provide additional training in order pass
specialized shipbuilding skills on to the next generation of workers.
They have collaborated on a training program that will help do just
that. This relatively new program, which includes an emerging
partnership with Southern Maine Community College, has tremendous
potential and could be vital to the future success of the shipyard.
We then concluded the day at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in
Kittery, Maine.
Over 200 years old, PNSY is one of only four public
shipyards in the United States.
Known as the Cradle of American
Shipbuilding, the skilled workers at PNSY today overhaul and maintain
the nuclear submarine fleet of the United States Navy.
PNSY has gone from sail to the atom by supporting a rigorous
and robust apprentice program, where on-the-job learning, technical
trade training, and academics combine to produce the highly skilled
workers required by this demanding field. PNSY works closely with York
County Community College to offer credits towards associate degrees in
trade and technical occupations.
During our tour of the shipyards learning centers, Secretary
Perez and I had the opportunity to meet PNSY apprentice Jennifer
Ouellette, who exemplifies the opportunity effective workforce training
programs can provide.

Senator Collins Honors Maine's Fallen Heroes

On Memorial Day, Senator Collins delivered remarks honoring our
nations fallen heroes at the Maine Veterans Cemetery in Augusta. In
her speech, the Senator shared one of her earliest childhood memories,
her father taking her to the Memorial Day parade in her hometown of
Caribou:
He would hoist me high upon his shoulders and there, from the best
vantage point along the parade route, I would see the hats come off and
the hands go over hearts as our Flag went by.
Some years, he would wear his old Army jacket.
It was not until many
years later that I learned the terrible price he had paid for it
the
Battle of the Bulge, the Bronze Star, and two Purple Hearts.
That
quiet courage, that modest heroism, that desire to do nothing more
after conflicts end but to return home to a peaceful and productive
civilian life is part of the history we celebrate today.
It is a
history we see from the shoulders of generations of such Americans.

>From WABI
"Senator Susan Collins Remembers Fallen Veterans with Augusta
Community"
"U.S. Senator Susan Collins made remarks at an Augusta cemetery today
in honor of fallen veterans. Senator Collins was joined by several
congressmen and First Lady Ann LePage at the Maine Veterans Memorial
Cemetery.
'We raise our voices in song and bow our heads in prayer in honor of
those who gave their all for each of us. When we do so we are reminded
that freedom is a gift purchased at the greatest possible price,' said
Senator Susan Collins.
"Collins says it meant a lot to her to share this solemn day of
gratitude and grief with the Augusta community. She says it brings back
childhood memories of Memorial Day celebrations she attended in Caribou
with a very special World War II veteran who happens to be her father."
Senate Approves Important Improvements to Rural Veterans' Health Care
The Access to Community Care for Veterans Act of 2015, legislation
co-sponsored by
Senator Collins, recently passed the United States
Senate by unanimous consent. This legislation would require the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to expand eligibility of the Choice
Program to cover veterans who reside more than 40 miles driving
distance from the closest VA facility that offers the specific care
they need. The bill must now be considered and passed by the House of
Representatives before it can be sent to the President.
In February, Senator Collins led a bipartisan group of 42 Senators in
expressing concerns about the implementation of the Choice Program in a
letter to Secretary of Veterans Affairs
Robert McDonald. Then in March,
Senator Collins met with Secretary McDonald
and discussed many
issues important to Maine veterans, including the 40-mile rule as it
relates to the Veterans Choice Card Program.
One week later, the VA announced that it would make a critical change
to the 40-mile rule, rejecting the as the crow flies, or a straight
line distance measurement. With the change in calculating the actual
distance that the veteran would have to travel, the number of eligible
veterans nationwide who can receive care in their communities roughly
doubles.
While that change was an important first step, the Choice Card rules
still did not consider the type of care available within 40 miles of
where a veteran lives. The bill passed today by the Senate would direct
the VA to make this necessary change.
Senator Collins Welcomes U.S. Secretary of Labor to Maine to Highlight
Workforce Training Programs
Senator Susan Collins welcomed U.S. Department of Labor Secretary,
Thomas E. Perez, to Maine this week to see the success of the
innovative workforce training programs located at two anchors of
Maines economy: Bath Iron Works and the Portsmouth Naval Ship Yard.
Senator Collins greeted Secretary Perez Wednesday Morning at the
Portland International Jetport where she thanked him for spending the
entire day in Maine and underscored their shared commitmentindeed a
passionfor making sure that Maine workers have the education, the
skills, and the training that they need for the jobs of today and
tomorrow.
Grady Trimble, WCSH
"US Labor Secretary Visits Maine Shipyards"
"U.S. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said an aging workforce at shipyards
underscores the importance of training a new generation of workers with
the skills needed to 'punch their ticket to the middle class.'
"Perez made the remarks Wednesday as he got a firsthand look at an
apprentice program at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and a training center
at Bath Iron Works. He said he plans to take good ideas back to
Washington.

"Collins and Perez pointed to Jenn Ouellette, a welding apprentice at
the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, as an example of the apprentice
programs' success. Oullette went to college for three years before
deciding to follow in her grandparents footsteps by working at the
shipyard.
"The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard's four-year apprentice program earned
attention from Vice President Joe Biden, who visited in September. Bath
Iron Works, meanwhile, opened its training center for new workers last
year."

"At Brewer High School on Tuesday, students got the chance to talk
directly to U.S. Sen. Susan Collins.
"Collins was invited to speak to honors students and answer their
questions about her position on state standardized testing, gridlock in
the government, rising energy costs and more. Collins told the students
about her journey from growing up in Caribou to becoming a state
Senator. She said she hopes to inspire younger generations to get
involved in their government because they are the future of this
country.
"'They have an important role to play. If they don't like cynicism and
the gridlock they see in Washington, they need to get involved. And
their voices will be heard and they can make a difference,' Collins
said.
"Collins said she has visits more that 200 high schools over the years
and has plans to visit many more in the near future."

"Building

By:
Senator
Susan
M.
Collins
If
you
could
get
a
return
of
$27
for
every
one
dollar
that
you
invested
in
a
company,
you
would
jump
at
the
chance.
According
to
United
States
Department
of
Labor
Secretary
Thomas
Perez,
that
is
exactly
the
return
we
get
for
every
federal
dollar
that
is
spent
on
apprenticeship
training
programs.
As
the
Secretary
points
out,
apprenticeships
are
a
tried
and
true
approach
for
passing
the
practical
training
needed
to
succeed
in
a
job
on
to
the
next
generation.
An
apprenticeship
is
just
as
applicable
to
the
complex
skills
needed
to
compete
in
the
21 st
century
workforce
as
it
was
in
the
18 th
century
when
this
country
was
founded.
I
invited
Secretary
Perez
to
come
to
Maine
last
week
so
he
could
see
apprenticeship
programs
in
action
at
Bath
Iron
Works
and
the
Portsmouth
Naval
Shipyard.
These
two
important
Maine
employers
have
instituted
apprenticeship
programs
to
attract
and
train
highly
skilled
workers
that
will
help
keep
their
operations
competitive
for
years
to
come.
It
is
fitting
that
these
two
facilities,
so
important
to
our
nation&#146;s
security
and
our
state&#146;s
economic
future,
are
on
the
cutting-edge
of
workforce
development.
Secretary
Perez
has
devoted
his
career
to
supporting,
protecting,
and
developing
a
strong
American
workforce.
His
obvious
enthusiasm
for
improving
opportunities
for
our

is
infectious,
and
he
has
a
very
clear
vision
about
how
job
training
can
lead
to
a
stable
and
secure
middle-class
lifestyle.
Secretary
Perez
and
I
began
the
day
at
BIW,
a
131-year-old
company
that
depends
on
highly
skilled
workers
to
produce
the
most
advanced

in
the

As

just
that. This
relatively
new

which
includes
an
emerging
partnership
with
Southern
Maine
Community
College,
has
tremendous
potential
and
could
be
vital
to
the
future
success
of
the
shipyard.
We
then
concluded
the
day
at
the
Portsmouth
Naval
Shipyard
in
Kittery,
Maine.
Over
200
years
old,
PNSY
is
one
of
only
four
public
shipyards
in
the
United
States.
Known
as
the
&#147;Cradle
of
American
Shipbuilding,&#148;
the
skilled
workers
at
PNSY
today
overhaul
and
maintain
the
nuclear

the

Navy.
PNSY
has
gone

On
Memorial
Day,
Senator
Collins
delivered
remarks
honoring
our
nation&#146;s
fallen
heroes
at
the
Maine
Veterans&#146;
Cemetery
in
Augusta.
In
her
speech,
the
Senator
shared
one
of
her
earliest
childhood
memories,
her
father
taking
her
to
the
Memorial
Day
parade
in
her
hometown
of
Caribou:
&#147;&#133;He
would
hoist
me
high
upon
his
shoulders
and
there,
from
the
best
vantage
point
along
the
parade
route,
I
would
see
the
hats
come
off
and
the
hands
go
over
hearts
as
our
Flag
went
by.
&#147;Some
years,
he
would
wear
his
old
Army
jacket.
It
was
not
until
many
years
later
that
I
learned
the
terrible
price
he
had
paid
for
it
&#150;
the
Battle
of
the
Bulge,
the
Bronze
Star,
and
two
Purple
Hearts.
That
quiet
courage,
that
modest
heroism,
that
desire
to
do
nothing
more
after
conflict&#146;s
end
but
to
return
home
to
a
peaceful
and
productive
civilian
life
is
part
of
the
history
we
celebrate
today.
It
is
a
history
we
see
from
the
shoulders
of
generations
of
such
Americans.

"Senator

"U.S.
Senator
Susan
Collins
made
remarks
at
an
Augusta
cemetery
today
in
honor
of
fallen
veterans.
Senator
Collins
was
joined
by
several
congressmen
and
First
Lady
Ann
LePage
at
the
Maine
Veterans&#146;

&#147;'We

When
we
do
so
we
are
reminded
that
freedom
is
a
gift
purchased
at
the
greatest
possible
price,'
said
Senator
Susan
Collins.
"Collins
says
it
meant
a
lot
to
her
to
share
this
solemn
day
of
gratitude
and
grief
with
the
Augusta
community.
She
says
it
brings
back
childhood

Senate
Approves
Important
Improvements
to
Rural
Veterans'
Health
Care
The
Access
to
Community
Care
for
Veterans
Act
of
2015,
legislation
co-sponsored
by
Senator
Collins,
recently
passed
the
United
States
Senate
by
unanimous
consent.
This
legislation
would
require
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
to
expand
eligibility
of
the
Choice
Program
to
cover
veterans
who
reside
more
than
40
miles
driving
distance
from
the
closest
VA
facility
that
offers
the
specific
care
they
need. The
bill
must
now
be
considered
and
passed
by
the
House
of
Representatives
before
it
can
be
sent
to
the
President.
In
February,
Senator
Collins
led
a
bipartisan
group
of
42
Senators
in
expressing
concerns
about
the
implementation
of
the
Choice
Program
in
a
letter
to
Secretary
of
Veterans
Affairs
Robert
McDonald.
Then
in
March,
Senator
Collins
met
with
Secretary
McDonald
and
discussed
many
issues
important
to
Maine
veterans,
including
the
40-mile
rule
as
it
relates
to
the
Veterans
Choice
Card
Program.
One
week
later,
the
VA
announced
that
it
would
make
a
critical
change
to
the
40-mile
rule,
rejecting
the
&#147;as
the
crow
flies,&#148;
or
a
straight
line
distance
measurement.
With
the
change
in
calculating
the
actual
distance
that
the
veteran
would
have
to
travel,
the
number
of
eligible
veterans
nationwide
who
can
receive
care
in
their
communities
roughly
doubles.
While
that
change
was
an
important
first
step,
the
Choice
Card
rules
still
did
not
consider
the
type
of
care
available
within
40
miles
of
where
a
veteran
lives.
The
bill
passed
today
by
the
Senate
would
direct
the
VA
to
make
this
necessary
change.

Collins
told
the
students
about
her
journey
from
growing
up
in
Caribou
to
becoming
a
state
Senator.
She
said
she
hopes
to
inspire
younger
generations
to
get
involved
in
their
government
because
they
are
the
future
of
this
country.
"'They
have
an
important
role
to
play.
If
they
don't
like
cynicism
and
the
gridlock
they
see
in
Washington,
they
need
to
get
involved.
And
their
voices
will
be
heard
and
they
can
make
a
difference,'
Collins
said.
"Collins
said
she
has
visits
more
that
200
high
schools
over
the
years
and
has
plans
to
visit
many
more
in
the
near
future."
