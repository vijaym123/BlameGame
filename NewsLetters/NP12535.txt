Update from Senator Bob Corker
February 7,
2014
CBO
Report is Sobering
Senator Corker
released the following statement after the non-partisan Congressional Budget
Office announced that the U.S. will add over $9 trillion in new debt
and nearly double Medicare and Social Security spending over the next
ten years. The report also finds that the health care law will
continue to negatively impact economic growth and result in 2.5 million fewer
Americans working in the next decade.
Todays CBO report
gives a sobering outlook on our economy. It confirms what weve known
all along: The health care law is having a tremendously negative
impact on economic growth, while entitlement spending continues to drive
our nations debt to historic levels. Reforming Medicare and Social
Security so they are strong and solvent is the only way to put our country
on a sound fiscal path that will allow for continued growth and
prosperity, said Corker.
Last year, Corker and Senator
Alexander introduced the Fiscal Sustainability Act, S. 11, to reduce the
growth of entitlement spending (Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security) by
nearly $1 trillion in the next decade in order to improve the
programs solvency. The bill incorporates many of the recommendations made by
President Obamas Debt Commission (Simpson-Bowles) as well as by
former Republican Senator Pete Domenici and Alice Rivlin, budget director
for former President Clinton.
Iran Benefiting from U.S. Sanctions Relief While Nuclear
Threat Remains
Appearing on MSNBCs Andrea
Mitchell Reports to discuss a Foreign Relations Committee
hearing
on negotiations over Irans nuclear program, Senator
Corker, ranking member of the committee, warned the interim agreement
allows Iran to benefit from U.S. sanctions relief without restricting
their development of delivery mechanisms for a nuclear
bomb.
Were losing our leverage economically [through sanctions relief]. If
you look at every indicator
[Irans] currency is rising; inflation
is falling; the economy is growing; peoples expectations are that
they're not going to be the rogue country theyve been, and everybody
wants to get first in line [to do business with Iran], said Corker.
Director Clapper just last week said its just a matter of political will
as to whether they can make a nuclear weapon. And yet in this interim
agreement, over the next year, we are allowing them to continue to
develop their ability to militarize and to deliver these weapons. Thats
not even part of the agreement. And were losing our
leverage.
