House Asserts Rightful Place for Recreation on Federal Lands
Dear Friend,
Because outdoor recreation - especially hunting, fishing, and shooting -
is such an important part of our culture and way of life here in
northern Minnesota, it was good to see the House pass legislation last
week helping assure that federally-managed lands are open to those
activities whenever reasonable and possible.
It's not a perfect bill, and I hope the Senate will include the
stricter environmental protections many of us fought for on the House
side. Nonetheless, H.R.3590, the Sportsmen's Heritage & Recreational
Enhancement Act (SHARE), includes common-sense provisions that should
be good news for folks who love to get out and enjoy the lands we all
own together as Americans. Among other things, the bill:
.
Strengthens an "open unless closed" policy. That means
federal lands will be open to recreational hunting, fishing, and
shooting unless they are officially closed for reasons relating to
national security, public safety, resource conservation, or other
Federal statutes, and;
.
Requires an open, public process and sound reasoning before
federal lands are closed to sports recreation.
The bill now heads to the Senate for consideration. I'll keep you
posted as the measure moves forward. Have a great week.
Sincerely,

Duluth Logjam Prompts White House Meeting
Click on the picture above to hear my report to Duluth area residents
on my meeting with Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx.
Huge piles of frozen snow and heavy logging trucks are competing with
cars, shoppers, and businesses along Duluth's main drag, Superior
Street, and something's got to give.
That was my message to U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx when
we met at the White House last week to talk about a possible weight
exemption that, under special circumstances, would allow those big
logging trucks to circumvent Duluth using a short stretch of I-35.
At my request, Secretary Foxx has agreed to determine whether or not he
has the authority to grant a federal exemption allowing the logging
trucks to use the federal highway. If he has that authority, I will
urge him to use it immediately to fix the problem on Superior Street.
If he does not, I will introduce legislation to provide him with the
same authority the Governor and other state officials have to grant
weight exemptions on state highways, similar to the authority granted
to the Minnesota Commissioner of Transportation.
There's a lot of winter left for Duluth, and I will continue to explore
any and all options to clear up Superior Street and still keep those
logging trucks moving as they bring Minnesota timber to market.
Propane Emergency Spurs Bipartisan Call for Hearings
President Obama and I discussed northern Minnesota's propane crisis
during our meeting last Tuesday at the White House.
As propane prices continued to rise and supplies got shorter last week,
I joined fellow Minnesota delegation members Tim Walz, Betty McCollum,
and Collin Peterson, and other Democrats and Republicans across the
Midwest in urging House Energy and Commerce Committee leadership to
hold hearings to determine exactly what has caused the problem, and
what we can do to prevent it in the future. Read our press release and
letter here.
Meanwhile, if you are experiencing a serious problem obtaining or
paying for propane fuel, please make my Duluth office your first call
at 218-464-5095. As this article
featuring my field representative Rick Olseen
attests, we are monitoring supplies on a daily basis, and we are here
to help.
Getting Things Done - the Green Way Green jobs in Minnesota's Eighth
District, research and investment in clean energy, alternative
solutions for a changing planet, and of course, protecting our northern
Minnesota's forests, lakes, and streams will top my agenda as the
newest member of the Sustainable Energy & Environment Coalition (SEEC).
A group including more than 50 Members of the U.S. House of
Representatives, SEEC is dedicated to advancing policies that create
clean energy jobs and protect the public health and our nation's
precious natural resources, while reducing our dependence on foreign
oil and helping quicken federal responses to environmental disasters.
Here in northern Minnesota, water recreation, hunting, fishing,
camping, and hiking are so much a part of our culture and our economy.
Nobody cares more about our great northern Minnesota outdoors than
those of us who live here, and I look forward to working with my SEEC
colleagues to preserve and protect that way of life we hold dear.

Our Week in Pictures
Advancing Rural Health
With Mark Schoenbaum (on my left) of the Minnesota Department of
Health's Office of Rural Health and Primary Care, and fellow advocates
of rural access hospitals in northern Minnesota. We met to discuss my
cosponsorship of H.Res356, which seeks to strengthen access to quality
health care in rural communities.
Boosting the Minnesota National Guard
at Camp Ripley & Duluth's 148th Fighter Wing
Major General Nash (to my left), Colonel Greg Thingvold, and Lieutenant
Colonel Sandy Best of the Minnesota National Guard came by my office on
Tuesday to discuss upcoming legislation, such as H.R.3930, the National
Commission on the Structure of the Army, which would have direct impact
on the funding levels, equipment supplies, and personnel levels of the
Minnesota National Guard, including both civilian and non-civilian
employees of Camp Ripley near Little Falls.
Working Together Against Substance Abuse
Young participants and leaders of the Working Together Coalition, based
out of Pine River, MN, stopped by my office to thank me for supporting
funding for their program, and to share with me their ideas on
preventing and ending substance abuse back home.
Helping Air Force Reserve Vets
I met with Mark Wasserbauer, an enlisted Air Force Reserve member of
Duluth's 148th Fighter Wing, to discuss particular provisions in
H.R.3930 (the National Commission on the Structure of the Army) that
benefit veterans of the Air Force Reserve.
Combating Illegal Narcotics
Members of the Minnesota Association of Narcotics Investigators were in
Washington last week to brief me on some of the work they're doing in
organizing local drug task forces throughout the state, funded through
the Regional Information Sharing System (RISS). These task forces
encourage communication between police departments - and facilitate the
sharing of ideas, technology, and equipment between law enforcement
officers and prosecutors - to combat the use of narcotics in Minnesota.
Powering Rural Minnesota
Members of the Minnesota Rural Electric Association, including
representatives from rural electric and power companies, met with me to
thank me for my support on the Farm Bill, which included robust funding
for energy programs.
Bettering Education for Children with Disabilities
Members of the Minnesota School Board Association stopped by to
discuss the funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
(IDEA), which provides special education programs and related services
to our school children with disabilities.

Coming Up in Washington
No Trade-Offs for American Jobs. America's trade agreements must not
cost American workers their jobs, or force American companies to
compete with other nations that do not enforce health, safety, and
environmental standards as strict as ours. With that in mind, I'll be
voicing my continuing opposition to the Fast-Track Trade bill at a
roundtable hosted by Connecticut Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro this week.
"Fast Track" would effectively do away with Congressional authority to
debate and modify trade negotiations with foreign countries. That is
unacceptable, and I intend to fight tooth and nail to maintain
Congress' ability to protect American workers and keep good-paying jobs
here at home.
Hello from 39,000 Feet? On Tuesday, I'll be sitting down with fellow
members of the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee to consider
legislation (H.R.3676) that would prohibit in-flight use of mobile
devices on airplanes. Looking forward to a lively debate on that one!
Coming Up in Minnesota
Congress Comes to You with meetings in Rush City, Hinckley, Cambridge,
and Sandstone. If you're having a problem with a federal agency, or you
feel as though an agency has made an error in a case you filed with
them, please by. My field staff are ready, willing, and able to help
you.
Propane Emergency? Call Us! Once again, if you're having trouble paying
for, or finding propane to heat your home or business, make my Duluth
office your first call: 218-464-5095.

Finally...
Talking Hot Dish, Cold Weather, and the Vikes
with the Minnesota State Society
How cold is it back in Minnesota? "It's so cold they deflated the
Humphrey Metrodome just for the hot air. The Dome took 38 minutes to
deflate. It took the Vikings until Week Three."
Minnesota comedy was the order of the evening, with yours truly as
keynote speaker the Minnesota State Society's Annual Walleye Dinner
last week. Held this year at the National Press Club, the dinner was
attended by over 200 Minnesotan ex-pats, united by love for the Land of
10,000 Lakes, hot dish, occasionally challenged sports teams, and, of
course, walleye.

Dear
Friend,
Because
outdoor
recreation
&#8211;
especially
hunting,
fishing,
and
shooting
&#8211;
is
such
an
important
part
of
our

here

it
was
good
to
see
the
House
pass
legislation
last

that
federally-managed

are
open
to
those
activities
whenever
reasonable
and
possible.
It&#8217;s
not
a
perfect
bill,
and
I
hope
the
Senate
will
include
the
stricter
environmental
protections
many
of
us
fought
for
on
the
House
side.
Nonetheless,
H.R.3590,
the

includes
common-sense
provisions
that
should
be
good

for
folks
who
love
to

all

Among
other
things,
the
bill:
&#8226;
Strengthens
an
" open

policy .
That
means
federal

will
be
open
to

unless
they
are
officially
closed
for
reasons
relating

and;
&#8226;
Requires
an
open,
public

and
sound

before
federal

are
closed
to
sports

The
bill
now
heads
to

for
consideration.
I&#8217;ll
keep
you

as
the

moves
forward.
Have

whether

to
use

If
he
has
that
authority,
I
will
urge
him
to
use
it
immediately
to
fix
the
problem
on
Superior
Street.
If
he
does
not,
I
will
introduce
legislation
to
provide
him
with
the
same
authority
the
Governor
and
other
state
officials
have
to
grant
weight
exemptions
on
state
highways,
similar
to
the
authority
granted
to
the
Minnesota
Commissioner
of
Transportation.
There&#8217;s
a
lot
of
winter
left
for
Duluth,
and
I
will
continue
to
explore
any
and
all
options
to
clear
up
Superior
Street
and
still
keep
those
logging
trucks
moving
as
they
bring
Minnesota
timber
to
market.
