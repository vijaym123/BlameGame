Dear friend,
Im coming to the end of a very busy and exciting week for Idaho.
On Monday, I participated in a
roundtable discussion
on improving wildfire
operations and fixing the wildfire budget.
Interior Secretary
Sally Jewell was there, along with Governor Otter and the entire Idaho
Delegation.
We advocated for legislation to reform the federal
wildfire budget, ending the destructive cycle of robbing the Forest
Services fire-prevention accounts to pay for wildfire suppression.
With the Administration coming out in support of our bill, we have
fresh momentum to get it passed.
To learn more about Mondays
event, check out the
Idaho Statesmans
article
here .
On Tuesday, I joined the Delegation again, this time at a gun
safety event at Cabelas.
We promoted Project ChildSafe, a program
put together by the National Shooting Sports Foundation.
Project Childsafe provides free gun locks to local law enforcement agencies,
who then distribute the locks throughout their community, free of
charge.
Its a great program that is making our children and our
homes safer, and Im proud to support it.
KTVB
covered
Tuesdays event; you can watch their story
here.
Throughout the week, I visited many local businesses to learn more about how
they work and how loosening the reins of the government can help
them.
I had a great time visiting employees at UPS, Hubble Homes, and
Engineered Structures, Inc.
I also had productive meetings with
the Idaho Home Builders, the Professional Firefighters of Idaho, and
the Community Planning Association of Southwest Idaho, among
others.
Last but not least, I met
with Carson Magee
at the Idaho Statehouse.
Carson is a young man who is doing great work on juvenile diabetes.
He is a true inspiration.
If you live in the
Boise market, be sure to watch Viewpoint on KTVB, 9 am this
Sunday.
Ill be on the show, taking questions about Congress and news of
the day.
If youre out during that time, please be sure to visit
the
Viewpoint
webpage .
My interview will be posted
there too.
Thank you
again for giving me the opportunity to represent you in Congress.
I
remain grateful for your trust and
confidence.
