Demanding Senate Democrats Allow Debate on Bill Ending
Unconstitutional Immigration Actions
2/13/15
Today, Congressman
Doug Lamborn joined 169 of his fellow House Republicans in demanding
that Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid stop censoring debate on a
critical bill that would fund the Department of Homeland Securitys
operations for Fiscal Year 2015 and defund unconstitutional programs
created unilaterally by President
Obama.
Text of Letter to Senator
Reid
Dear
Minority Leader Reid,
We write to
express our strong concern that Senate Democrats are blocking debate on
a critical bill that would fund the Department of Homeland Securitys
operations for Fiscal Year 2015 and defund unconstitutional programs
created unilaterally by President
Obama.
Three times, you and other members of your caucus have
prevented even a debate of the House-passed Department of Homeland
Security Appropriations bill. While we understand that you and many of your
Democrat colleagues are opposed to the provisions in the House-passed
bill that would defund President Obamas effective rewriting of our
immigration laws, you should at least support debating the merits of
such an important funding bill and offer amendments to the provisions
you wish to change.
However,
you have repeatedly obstructed even debating this bill in order to
protect President Obamas unconstitutional acts and shield Senators of
your party
many of whom have publicly stated that they oppose the
Presidents unilateral actions
from voting on the substance of the
House-passed bill. It is utterly appalling that you and other Senate
Democrats believe that protecting the Presidents unconstitutional actions is
more important than funding a Department tasked with keeping
Americans safe.
By preventing
the Senate from taking up the House-passed bill, you are also denying
the American people a fair debate on this issue. And a fair debate is
what the American people want
they fundamentally disagree with
President Obamas actions and believe that he has unlawfully acted alone.
For example, a Washington Post/ABC News poll last month found that 57%
of registered voters believe that President Obamas grant of deferred
action should be blocked.
President Obamas actions are tilting the scales of our government in
the executives favor, threatening to unravel our system of checks and
balances and imperiling all our liberties.
The House of
Representatives has acted decisively to defend the Constitution from this clear
and present danger by voting to defund the presidents executive
actions.
For the sake of our nation, our two bodies must stand
together on a bipartisan basis. But in order to do this, the Senate
Democrat caucus must cease to play politics with the Constitution.
You
must end your filibuster of the House-passed bill and allow it to
proceed to the floor for consideration.
History will record our
actions and how we honor the trust placed in all of us by the American
people.
Sincerely,
Bob Goodlatte
