WOW. I
literally
cannot believe this:
When I went to check
ActBlue
this morning, I saw something AMAZING:
1. Your support for Cheri so far in 2015 has been nothing short of spectacular (ok, I already knew that).
2. But get this: as of 3:10pm, we&rsquo;re within striking distance of $1OO,OOO (!!!) raised online for Cheri in the first quarter of the OFF-YEAR.
SERIOUSLY.
You may not throw around terms like &ldquo;off-year&rdquo; or &ldquo;quarterly deadlines&rdquo; in your day-to-day lives (lucky you!). But trust me, this is a HUGE deal.
Why? Our first end-of-quarter fundraising deadline is TOMORROW. Our numbers will be public, and everyone&rsquo;s looking to see how we do. (That includes Mr. Boehner.) So David, we need your help right away. If every Democrat reading this chips in $5 for Cheri right now, we&rsquo;ll hit our goal by MIDNIGHT! Are you in?
$5
$35
$50
$100
$250
Other
Thank you!!!
