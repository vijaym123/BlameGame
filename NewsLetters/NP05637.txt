Dear Friend, I&rsquo;ve said before that &ldquo;GOP&rdquo; no longer stands for &ldquo;Grand Old Party&rdquo; -- these days, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gang of Polluters.&ldquo;
For proof, look no further than what Republicans say about climate change. They won&rsquo;t even acknowledge it&rsquo;s happening, because if they did, it might make the Big Oil Koch brothers upset.
And if the Republicans take over the Senate this November, the &ldquo;Gang of Polluters&rdquo; will control all of Congress. Election Day is just around the corner. We only have 27 days to keep the Senate in Democratic hands. Give $5, $10, or whatever you can to help us finish strong.

Or donate another amount.
If Republicans pick up the six seats they need to win the majority in the Senate, we&rsquo;ll be facing more than just another two years of gridlock. They&rsquo;ve already threatened to deny funding needed to implement the EPA&rsquo;s proposed carbon emissions rule if they gain the majority. Years of progress on climate issues will be at risk.
That is if they don&rsquo;t just shut the government down altogether.
The other side isn&rsquo;t backing down. The Koch brothers, Karl Rove, and all of the dark money special interest groups are spending fortunes to support right-wing candidates.
It&rsquo;s up to us to keep fighting for progress. Our FEC pre-general filing deadline is just 6 days away. If you can, give right now.
Thanks for your support.
