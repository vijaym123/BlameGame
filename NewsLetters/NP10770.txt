April 11, 2014
The Justice Department recently requested $382.1 million dollars
for its fiscal year 2014 budget for gun safety measures.
Attorney
General Eric Holder recently said the Administration is looking for
common-sense gun control reforms.
Two options the Justice Department is
exploring are gun tracking bracelets and fingerprint recognition.
Do you think these are
common-sense gun reform ideas?
Yes, these reforms could improve gun safety. No, these reforms sound like
government gun control. I
would rather not say.
