Friend ,
As a physician and public health expert, I am disappointed to learn that the issue of childhood vaccinations is being politicized.
Vaccines are one of the most important medical advances in our lifetime and the most effective tool we have to prevent infectious diseases.
The facts are clear- vaccines save lives.

Politicizing this issue endangers both our children and communites. As a doctor and father, we have a responsibility to educate our families to make sure parents understand the potential dangers unvaccinated children face.
We all must do our part to keep our communities safe and healthy--

Be well,
Ami
P.S. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), vaccines will
save 732,000 lives
just among children born in the past two decades-- sign your name to pledge your support for childhood vaccinations.
