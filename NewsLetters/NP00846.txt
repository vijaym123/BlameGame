Dear Friend,
As one of the most densely populated states in the entire country, New Jersey has its share of transportation problems.
Our roads and infrastructure are vital to our lives and livelihoods, and can be a constant source of frustration for many people.
Being startled after hitting a pothole or seeing a lane closure ruin your morning commute by clogging-up traffic is practically a rite of passage in the Garden State.
Our transportation needs are unique and they require unique solutions.
By and large, our highway projects and road maintenance costs are paid by federal and state gas taxes.
These taxes combine for a set amount built into the price of every gallon of fuel that motorists purchase.
New Jerseyans pay a 14.5 cent state tax plus an 18.4 cent federal tax, which totals 32.9 cents per gallon every time you fill-up.
The federal gas tax revenue is placed in the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) and, for almost 60 years, the HTF held enough revenue to support highway projects in every state.
But, in 2008, the HTF became insolvent.
Since then,
American taxpayers have bailed out the HTF six times, costing you almost $62 billion.
The national highway system was built on the user-pays principlethose that used the roads would pay to maintain them through the gas tax.
While many factors have contributed to the HTFs funding shortfall, a major culprit is Congress diverting gas tax funds that should have been spent on the maintenance of our highways and transportation infrastructure.
Instead, taxpayer funds have been funneled to projects that have nothing to do with highways or infrastructure like pedestrian paths, landscaping, university research, and hiking trails.
As Congress debates another bailout of the Highway Trust Fund later this month, I want to take this issue directly to you, my constituents who use our roads every day.
After all, you know the condition of Kinderkamack Road in Emerson, the traffic on Route 4 in Hackensack, and the projects needed on Water Street in Belvidere better than anyone in D.C.
Please take a moment to answer a few questions about the Highway Trust Fund and New Jerseys transportation needs:
