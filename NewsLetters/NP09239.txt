Let's Certify It
Dear Friends,
A report out yesterday by the U.S. Commerce Department paints a bleak
picture of our economic strength on President Obama's watch. The
agency's findings show that, for the first time in three years, our
economy actually shrank over the first quarter of 2014. The Wall Street
Journal called it "another stumble for a lackluster recovery." But for
many Tennessee families facing poor job prospects and stagnant wages,
the last six years haven't felt like much of a "recovery" at all.
Sadly, President Obama's healthcare law only threatens to make matters
worse.
While President Obama and liberal Democrats in Congress maintain that
Obamacare won't cost jobs or inflict further damage on the economy,
their claims are at odds with the truth. Earlier this year, the
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated
that the law would reduce
the American workforce by the equivalent of 2.3 million full-time
workers and, according to a Hoover Institute study
, 2.6
million Americans are at risk of having their hours and waves cut as a
result of the law's 30-hour work week provision alone.
When it comes to Obamacare's effect on jobs and the economy, we should
not be content to simply take the Obama administration at its word. We
need to see the facts. That is why I joined Congressman Stephen Fincher
in introducing the Certify It Act of 2014
-legislation
calling for a Government Accountability Office review of Obamacare's
employer mandate. If the study finds that the mandate is hurting job
prospects or causing insurance premiums to rise, this bill would impose
a one year delay.
While the only way to truly protect all Americans from the harmful
effects of Obamacare is to repeal it altogether and replace this law
with a patient-centered alternative, we should, at a bare minimum,
force this Administration to back up its claims about what Obamacare
will and will not do. If Obamacare is "working" as this Administration
says, let's make them prove it. The Certify It Act will do just that.
Sincerely,
Diane Black
Member of Congress
PS-This week, House Republicans have continued our work to hold the VA
accountable for its unacceptable delays in care for our veterans. I am
pleased that VA Secretary Eric Shinseki heeded my call
for his resignation
and am committed to seeing that his replacement does right by our
nation's heroes. In the meantime, I want to hear how veterans in our
district have been impacted by this agency's mismanagement. Take a
moment to share your story with me HERE

Let's
Certify
It
Dear
Friends,
A
report
out
yesterday
by
the
U.S.
Commerce
Department
paints
a
bleak
picture
of
our
economic
strength
on
President
Obama&#8217;s
watch.
The
agency&#8217;s
findings
show
that,
for
the
first
time
in
three
years,
our
economy
actually
shrank
over
the
first
quarter
of
2014.
The
Wall
Street
Journal
called
it
&#8220;another
stumble
for
a
lackluster
recovery.&#8221;
But
for
many
Tennessee
families
facing
poor
job
prospects
and
stagnant
wages,
the
last
six
years
haven&#8217;t
felt
like
much
of
a
&#8220;recovery&#8221;
at
all.
Sadly,
President
Obama&#8217;s
healthcare
law
only
threatens
to
make
matters
worse.
While
President
Obama
and
liberal
Democrats
in
Congress
maintain
that
Obamacare
won&#8217;t
cost
jobs
or
inflict
further
damage
on
the
economy,
their
claims
are
at
odds
with
the
truth.
Earlier
this
year,
the
nonpartisan
Congressional
Budget
Office
estimated
that
the
law
would
reduce
the
American
workforce
by
the
equivalent
of
2.3
million
full-time
workers
and,
according
to
a
Hoover
Institute
study ,
2.6
million
Americans
are
at
risk
of
having
their
hours
and
waves
cut
as
a
result
of
the
law&#8217;s
30-hour
work
week
provision
alone.
When
it
comes
to
Obamacare&#8217;s
effect
on
jobs
and
the
economy,
we
should
not
be
content
to
simply
take
the
Obama
administration
at
its
word.
We
need
to
see
the
facts.
That
is
why
I
joined
Congressman
Stephen
Fincher
in
introducing
the
Certify
It
Act
of
2014 &#8212; legislation
calling
for
a
Government
Accountability
Office
review
of
Obamacare&#8217;s
employer
mandate.
If
the
study
finds
that
the
mandate
is
hurting
job
prospects
or
causing
insurance
premiums
to
rise,
this
bill
would
impose
a
one
year
delay.
While
the
only
way
to
truly
protect
all
Americans
from
the
harmful
effects
of
Obamacare
is
to
repeal
it
altogether
and
replace
this
law
with
a
patient-centered
alternative,
we
should,
at
a
bare
minimum,
force
this
Administration
to
back
up
its
claims
about
what
Obamacare
will
and
will
not
do.
If
Obamacare
is
&#8220;working&#8221;
as
this
Administration
says,
let&#8217;s
make
them
prove
it.
The
Certify
It
Act
will
do
just
that.

Diane
Black Member

House
Republicans
have
continued
our
