Help us break the tie.
Your gift will be triple-matched! &gt;&gt;
Friend -- We have 33 hours left to rip this election away from the Republicans.
In 33 hours, we could seize victory in RED STATES like Georgia and Kentucky. Mitch McConnell could be out.
But it all depends on what you do right now.
With the election this close (10 races polling within 3 points!), we NEED your help to pull out a win. We need more door knocks and phone calls to get every single battleground Democrat to the polls. We need last-minute ads on the air to grab undecided voters.
We just need MORE to ensure that Democrats win -- and hand the GOP what
Politico
reported would be a &ldquo;doomsday&rdquo; defeat.
It&rsquo;s your LAST CHANCE.
Friend, your help is absolutely essential with only 33 hours left till Election Day. Will you please pitch in? 100% of your donation will be triple-matched and sent IMMEDIATELY to deadlocked battlegrounds, where funds are badly needed!
