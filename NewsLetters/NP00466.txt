Dear David,
There's no better time than windshield time in Montana.
And I got plenty of it last week.
The Senate was back home for Memorial Day, so I spent four days traveling around eastern Montana meeting with constituents.
You can see photos of my trip
HERE .
But before heading east, on
Memorial Day , I had the honor of playing &lsquo;Taps' at the Montana Veterans Memorial in Great Falls. ( click to watch video )
After that, we visited a Native language immersion class in Poplar on the Fort Peck Reservation.
While I was there, I unveiled my bill to support Native language immersion initiatives throughout Indian Country.
Studies show that Native language immersion gives students a leg up in school and lead to future success in life.
From there we drove to Plentywood, Culbertson and Sidney where we met with local councilmembers and business leaders about how the Bakken is affecting their communities.
In each of those towns, I heard the same thing: eastern Montana has serious infrastructure needs, and Congress and the Montana Legislature need to pass bills to support them.
Congress
just passed
a two-month highway bill extension, but that's just not enough.
At a time when China is spending billions on infrastructure, limping along two months at a time is no way to stay competitive in this global economy.
Over the next month, I'm going to work with my fellow senators to try and pass a long-term highway bill that gives Montana businesses and communities the certainty they need.
Then in Glendive on Thursday I met with seniors to talk about the future of Medicare and Social Security.
I assured them that I will keep working to strengthen those programs so they're around for today's seniors and for future generations.
I wrapped up my trip in Billings with Montana's Superintendent Denise Juneau.
We talked with fourth and sixth graders - and their teachers - about how the &lsquo;No Child Left Behind' testing requirements force them to spend too much time taking tests and not enough time learning to think critically and creatively.
I have
a bill
that will reduce the No Child Left Behind testing requirements and replace it with fewer required tests so students, parents and teachers have more flexibility about what is being taught in the classroom.
All in all it was a great trip, and now I'm back in our nation's Capital where it's always a pleasure to serve you in the U.S. Senate.
