Dear Friends,
On Thursday the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing on the
Russian invasion of Ukraine.
At this hearing, I was able to question
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Eric Rubin about how the
administration views the invasion and if they believe Russia is
attempting to reconstitute its empire.
The actions of the Russians
over the last week are dangerous and in my mind, constitute and act of
war.
You can watch my entire exchange with Deputy Assistant Secretary
Rubin below.
On Tuesday the president released his budget for the coming fiscal
year. He once again failed to put forward a serious proposal that is
reflective of the spending and debt crisis our country faces. This
irresponsible proposal completely ignores the need for entitlement
reform and spending cuts that would get America's financial house in
order and is detached from the foreign policy challenges we face in an
increasingly dangerous world.
I cannot and will not support this
budget. You can read my full statement here
This week I cosponsored H.R. 4139, the American Job Creation and
Strategic Alliances LNG Act
.
If enacted into law,
this legislation would eliminate regulatory barriers and make it easier
for the U.S. to export natural gas to countries like the Ukraine that
are almost entirely dependent on Russia for their energy needs.
Not
only is this an important energy export bill, but one that contains
national security implications as well.
The House of Representatives passed, and I supported, H.R. 4118, the
Suspending the Individual Mandate Penalty Law Equals Fairness Act
.
This legislation would
eliminate the individual mandate tax penalty that is a part of
ObamaCare for one year.
I was recently interviewed by the Pflugerville Plag about my
legislative priorities for this year.
I discussed the importance of
securing our border, debt reduction, entitlement reform, and ObamaCare.

Dear
Friends,
On

the

Foreign
Affairs

held
a

on
the
Russian
invasion
of
Ukraine.
At
this

I
was

Eric
Rubin
about
how
the
administration
views
the
invasion
and
if
they
believe
Russia
is
attempting
to
reconstitute
its
empire.
The
actions
of
the
Russians
over
the
last
week
are
dangerous
and
in
my
mind,
constitute
and
act
of
war.
You
