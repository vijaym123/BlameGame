Defeating Terrorist
Organization ISIL
Last week, President Obama spoke to the
American people to outline his
strategy to combat the
Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or
ISIL .
ISIL is a threat to American interests
both at home and abroad.
As our nation remembered the tragic
events of September 11th last week, we are reminded that there are
those throughout the world who seek to disrupt our American way of
life.
I briefly discussed the threat
ISIL poses and how we must handle this threat against our nation on
KSHB 41 Action News Thursday. I will continue to closely monitor this
situation and work with my colleagues
to implement a strategy
that allows our military to protect American lives.
Legislation
to consider authorization of force is slated to come before the House
this week. However, as this situation continues to unfold, please
dont hesitate to contact my office to express your
concerns.

Remembering September 11
Click the image above,
or
here , to watch Congressman
Yoder's one minute speech honoring the 13th anniversary of the September
11 attacks.
I took a moment to
honor and remember our families and friends who lost their lives in the
horrific attacks on September 11, 2001
on the House floor last
week. Last Thursday marked the
13th anniversary
of
the attacks and once again we paused to remember the innocent lives lost
at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and the heroes on Flight
93 in Pennsylvania. The same day also marked
two years since
we lost four Americans at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi,
Libya.
I also paid tribute to
the
first responders
who selflessly worked to save
their fellow Americans and the
brave men and women who answered
the call of duty
and have courageously joined the
Armed Forces to defend our
freedom .
September 11, 2001, changed our great nation. It awakened us
to the ever-present threat by those who wish to attack our country and
its citizens, but it also
stiffened our resolve and unified
our nation.
Immediately after the horrific attacks,
we
came together as a nation , the American spirit running high
and
we emerged more determined and stronger than ever
before . Our American spirit is enduring and our leadership in the
world remains the strongest tool we have against
terror.
Organ
Transplant Changes Negatively Impacting Kansans
I
wrote a
letter , with more than 50 of my colleagues in the House, to Administrator
Mary Wakefield, of the Health Resources and Services Administration,
expressing concerns regarding a concept paper released by the
United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)
Liver and Intestine Committee
that would change the
rules governing the allocation of livers for
transplant.
As I mentioned in my
previous e-newsletter , Ive met
with the
University of Kansas
Hospital Transplant Center
and the
United Network for Organ Sharing
(UNOS)
to discuss the proposed changes and the
negative impact they
will have not only on Kansans, but other patients in the Midwest
region .
Due to the
donor shortage rates across the east and west coasts, there is an
effort to redistribute organs from the Midwest to lower donor areas
particularly on the east coast. This proposal does nothing to increase the
amount of donations and may have the opposite result moving organs out
of the communities within which they are donated. In particular, this
would limit the organ availability to other programs, including the
Center for Transplantation at
the University of Kansas Hospital
Center .

From
the
Associated
Press :
National Endowment for the Arts
I
enjoyed meeting with
Jane Chu, Chairwoman of the
National Endowment for the Arts , in
my Washington, D.C. office last Wednesday. Jane was nominated to head
the NEA by President Obama earlier this year. Previously, she served
as CEO and president of the
Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts
in Kansas City.
Jane has made a
positive impact on the greater Kansas City area
community
and I am confident she will continue her
great work for the arts at the national
level.
Thank
you, Chairwoman Jane Chu for your continued advocacy for the
arts.
Kansas Automobile Dealers
Association
I enjoyed meeting with the
Kansas Automobile Dealers Association
last
week in my Washington, D.C. office. We had a great conversation about the
success of their industry and all the jobs theyve created throughout
the state. In addition, we discussed how we can work together to
ensure overregulation doesnt affect their ability to boost the economy
and create more jobs for
Kansans.
Congressman Yoder and the
Kansas Automobile Dealers
Association
met to discuss the industry and regulations
coming from Washington that might hinder their
business.
