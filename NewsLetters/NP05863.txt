Dear Friends,
Our community has long been
plagued by identity theft. You need to look no further than the
nightly news to hear about a new scam or scheme to steal the identity of
unsuspecting victims. From dumpster divers to unscrupulous employees at
a variety of offices that have access to our personal information
every day, many in our community have suffered a breach of their personal
information. Unfortunately, this also includes Medicare recipients who
rely on the program for much needed care. The sad fact is that
Florida leads the nation in identity theft with almost 70,000 reported
occurrences in 2012 alone.
According to the National Consumer
League, last year, half of the individuals whose identities had been
stolen were not aware that they were victims of fraud. Anyone can become
a target or victim of identity theft criminals, here are a few useful
steps you can
take:
Dont give your credit card, Social Security number, or
Medicare information to anyone who calls you
unsolicited.
If you speak to someone
who says they work for a bank or the state or federal government, call
them back at a phone number listed on your bill or their
website.
Never give
information to anyone calling you and claiming they work for the IRS.
The IRS will only communicate with taxpayers by mail.
If
your identity is stolen, notify your bank and credit card companies
immediately. Check your financial statements for any unauthorized charges.
You should also request an Identity Theft Victim Kit from the Florida
Attorney General at 1-866-966-7226 or call my Congressional office at
305-668-2285 for assistance.
As unscrupulous criminals seek
to take advantage of our elderly, we have seen a rise in the amount
of people who have had their Medicare information stolen and thus
cannot receive care or are delayed in obtaining the proper care. In order
to help reduce and eliminate Medicare fraud in South Florida, I
introduced the Medicare Fraud Enforcement and Prevention Act. This bill would
strengthen penalties on criminals who engage in Medicare fraud and
would implement new screening procedures to stop fraud from happening in
the first place.
Only by being vigilant and ensuring your
personal information is safe can you protect yourself from those who
wish to do you financial harm.
Sincerely,
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
Member of
Congress
