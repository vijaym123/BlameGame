Update from Senator Bob Corker
June 14,
2014
House Should Improve and Pay for Veterans
Bill
On Thursday, Senator Corker applauded House of Representatives
Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller (R-Fla.) for announcing he
will find a way to improve and pay for legislation to address the
problems uncovered at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA).
The men and women who fought to protect and defend this
country have sacrificed too much only to have Congress drive America deeper
into debt and jeopardize our security for future generations. Our
veterans deserve solutions to the chronic, systemic problems that exist at
the VA, but the bill passed by the Senate yesterday, which was rushed
through in an effort to hide the massive price tag from the American
people, is not the right answer. I thank Chairman Miller for his
leadership, and I hope the House will improve the bill and pay for it so I
can support it when it comes back to the Senate.
On
Wednesday, Corker voted against the Senate legislation (S. 2450) after a
preliminary analysis by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office
(CBO) found that one section of the bill alone would increase direct
spending by more than $35 billion in the next three
years.
Even more troubling, the report said this estimate should be viewed as
falling in the middle of a wide range of possible outcomes, indicating
the cost for the bill could be much greater than the initial
estimate.
National Review: Bob Corker,
Ron Johnson, and Jeff Sessions Were Right about the VA :
But the fact that this gigantic price tag was delivered around 4 p.m.
[Wednesday], when the Senate voted around 4:30, is reason enough to
slow down and reconsider just what theyre about to pass. Only three
senators agreed, unfortunately, all Republicans: Bob Corker of Tennessee,
Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, and Jeff Sessions of Alabama. They deserve
great credit for questioning the wisdom of passing what could become a
gigantic new entitlement
that wasnt paid for in any way, because
it was passed as an emergency budgetary measure. The VA scandals
demand an immediate response, of course, but the Senate bill isnt
necessary to execute it: President Obama has already ordered that the VA
expand the coverage it offers outside the system for vets waiting for
care. No program like this should be passed as an emergency measure.
Fixing the VAs problems, such as they are, may require lots and lots of
money
and maybe the Senate wasnt voting to spend quite as much money
as the CBO just said. But any congressman with any respect whatsoever
for the concept of fiscal responsibility
not deficit hawks, just
anyone concerned with how much we spend and on what
should want
Congress to take time to study this issue (as, indeed, the House is planning
to). Read more

Supporting Free
Enterprise
On Wednesday, Senator Corker received the Friends of Adam
Smith Foundation 2014 Public Official Award for his support of free
enterprise: free markets, low taxes, limited government, respect for
private property, and the promotion of a stable economy.
I
am honored to receive the Public Official Award by the Friends of Adam
Smith Foundation, said Corker. The free enterprise system we value
in America has allowed many entrepreneurs, including myself, to build
businesses and create jobs, and it has been a top priority of mine to
support policies that will grow the private sector rather than the
government.

Crisis in
Iraq
Senator Corker, ranking member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, issued the following statement on Friday regarding the
crisis in Iraq where militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and
Greater Syria (ISIS) have taken control of major cities and could
threaten the capitol city of Baghdad:
Assuming the government
of Iraq is willing to take immediate, concrete steps to rectify the
political problems within their country, the administration, working with
Congress, should then try to stop the bleeding in Iraq by providing
the appropriate air assistance. In addition, we should assign senior,
credible diplomats to help improve the situation and use U.S. military
expertise to strengthen the Iraqis security forces and prevent any
further advances by terrorists. The president must make this one of his
top priorities and work with Congress to authorize support as
needed.
