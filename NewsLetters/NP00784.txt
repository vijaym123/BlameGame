Friends,
At the start of this year, I became chairman of the subcommittee responsible for writing the annual legislation to fund Congress, including the security of the Capitol complex and all the construction and maintenance of our historic buildings.
In putting this legislation together, my goal was to hold the line on spending and put forth a conservative bill that honors and respects taxpayers.
I'm proud to say we did just that!
My bill, which passed the House yesterday, freezes spending as well as member pay.

In writing the bill,
I made tough decisions and stretched every dollar just like families across America do every day.
In addition to freezing House spending and member pay, we require new oversight rules for major construction projects and completely eliminate an outdated, multi-million dollar per year program called Open World Leadership Center.
All this is accomplished while preserving the beauty of the Capitol campus, providing essential security for visitors and staff, and ensuring that Members of Congress are able to provide the services their constituents expect and deserve.
This bill sets an example for the whole government.
Freedom First,
Congressman Tom Graves
