Dear Friend,
Since coming to Washington, I have
supported an all-of-the-above energy
approach that both protects and promotes
Ohios energy resources and the jobs
that rely on it. This approach will not
only continue to create new American jobs,
it will strengthen our national security,
lower energy prices, and put us on the path
toward energy independence. It is critical
that we utilize all of our resources,
including oil, natural gas, and clean coal,
as well as alternative energy sources such
as wind, solar, nuclear, and
hydropower.
We are fortunate that Ohio is home to an
abundance of energy resources that
contribute significantly to our
states economy. According to a
recent survey released by the American
Petroleum Institute, the oil and natural
gas industry contributes $28.4 billion
annually to Ohios economy and
accounts for more than 250,000 jobs with an
average salary that is substantially higher
than the average annual salary in Ohio.
From 2012 to 2013, oil production in Ohio
doubled and natural gas production
increased by more than 40 percent
evidence that Ohio is a leader in energy
development.
In addition to its oil and natural gas
production, Ohio produces 24 million tons
of coal per year and uses it to generate
nearly 70 percent of our states
electricity. This affordable, reliable
natural resource is an important element of
our domestic energy supply, supporting more
than 550,000 jobs throughout the country,
including thousands in Ohio.
Because thousands of Ohioans
livelihoods rely on the energy industry,
advancing legislation that unleashes the
power of American energy, promotes safe and
responsible production of our states
resources, and ensures that Ohioans have
access to affordable and reliable
electricity has always been a priority of
mine.
That is why I was proud to support the
American Energy Solutions for Lower Costs
and More American Jobs Act, a package of
bills passed by the House of
Representatives earlier this month. This
legislation will promote efficient
technologies to harness energy production,
lower the cost of energy, and prevent the
Obama Administration from creating new
job-killing regulations. One of the bills,
the Northern Route Approval Act, allows the
construction of the Keystone Pipeline,
which will create nearly 20,000 jobs and
bring down the cost of energy. Another
bill, the Lowering Gas Prices to Fuel an
America That Works Act, removes federal
government barriers that block production
of U.S. energy sources offshore and expands
onshore American energy production by
streamlining regulations. The Preventing
Government Waste and Protecting Coal Mining
Jobs in America, authored by fellow Ohioan
Rep. Bill Johnson, prevents the
Administration from developing regulations
that will lead to the closure of Ohio coal
plants. Lastly, the Electricity Security
and Affordability Act will protect reliable
energy resources by reining in the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The American Energy Solutions for Lower
Costs and More American Jobs Act is
important to Ohios economy; it is
critical that the Senate acts on it to
ensure that energy production and the jobs
supported by it are not only protected, but
have the opportunity to grow.
