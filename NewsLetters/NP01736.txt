Friend,
Amazing news:
Another donor has stepped up to extend our match. That means all donations up to $15,000 will be matched if you give before midnight tonight.
Bad news:
We have less than 8 hours left before our deadline at midnight tonight and
we are $3,884 away from our goal.
We have a long way to go and little time to waste.
We wouldn&rsquo;t ask if it wasn&rsquo;t important&mdash;we&rsquo;re running up against our deadline and need your help.
If you&#39;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $25
Express Donate: $50
Express Donate: $100
Express Donate: $250
Express Donate: another amount
Everyone at Bera HQ is extremely excited about the news of the extended match but it&rsquo;s all hands on deck to make sure we hit our goal before midnight tonight.
We have less than 8 hours left until our deadline
and we need a few more folks to pitch in before time runs out.
Click here to rush a donation to our campaign.
Thanks,
Team Bera
