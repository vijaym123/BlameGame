Friend,
41 years ago today, the Supreme Court handed down the Roe v. Wade decision. This landmark case not only ensured a woman&#39;s right to make her own reproductive health care decisions, but was also a major step forward in the fight for women&#39;s justice and equality.
But today, instead of focusing on job creation and the economy, the National Republican establishment continues their mission to chip away at a woman&#39;s right to make her own health care decisions.
As if that weren&#39;t enough, when Republicans gather to debate these issues, they do it without any women present.
You read that right - just last week, an all-male committee met to debate rolling back Roe.
As one of three Democratic physicians in the House, I&rsquo;m leading this fight.
That&rsquo;s another reason the election this year is so important&mdash;and I need your help.
Can you chip in $3 or more now to support our efforts?
They&#39;re obsessed-- and they&#39;re out of touch. But while they are focused on rehashing long-resolved issues, we&rsquo;re taking steps to advance women&rsquo;s health care.
Access to preventative health care is core to women&rsquo;s reproductive freedom, and that&rsquo;s why I worked closely with Planned Parenthood and The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to introduce the Women&rsquo;s Preventive Health Awareness Campaign. Our bill helps ensure that women have clear information about the preventive services they need to remain healthy.
As a physician and as the father of a daughter, this is personal.
The government has no business getting between doctors and their patients.
And I want to fight to make sure my daughter grows up in a country where she is in charge of her own health care decisions.
We cannot back off of this fight.

No more looking back. It&#39;s time to move forward.
Be well,
