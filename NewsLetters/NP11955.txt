Dear Friend,
I promised that I would keep you updated on important budget, fiscal,
and military issues that are taking place in Washington. As you
remember, on December 12, 2013, the House of Representatives passed the
Bipartisan Budget Act by a vote of 332-94. The Bipartisan Budget Act
set overall discretionary spending for the current fiscal year at
$1.012 trillion-about halfway between the Senate budget level of $1.058
trillion and the House budget level of $967 billion. The legislation
includes dozens of specific deficit-reduction provisions, with
mandatory savings and non-tax revenue totaling approximately $86
billion. The agreement would reduce the deficit by $23 billion without
raising taxes.
Additionally, the bill would provide $63 billion in sequester relief
over two years, split evenly between defense and non-defense programs.
Under this proposal, defense spending would receive almost $30 billion
more over the next two years. As a member of the House Armed Services
Committee and a strong supporter of our men and women in uniform, I am
pleased that this budget safeguards our national defense and restores
$30 billion in previously reduced national defense funding. There are
only a few things Congress should be doing according to the
Constitution, and one of them is to provide for the Common Defense.
This agreement will provide our military with some near-term relief
from sequestration and give them the ability to plan for the next two
years. The restored funding can be used to improve readiness, increase
flight-training hours, purchasing new equipment, and help our troops on
the front line.
One of the most controversial ways in which this agreement achieved
savings is through reforms to military retiree pensions. I am proud to
report to you that the proposed reduction in military retiree pensions
has been reversed. On February 11, 2014, the House of Representatives,
with my support, passed S.25 that repealed the reductions in military
retirement pensions that were part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of
2013. The President subsequently signed this legislation into law. S.25
replaces the $6 billion cut to military retiree pensions with fully
offset reductions to mandatory spending elsewhere in the budget.
>From the moment the Bipartisan Budget Act was signed into law, I took
steps to rectify the change in military pensions. I signed on to
legislation that would have replaced the military retiree pension cut
with a requirement that Social Security numbers be provided by people
claiming the child tax credit on their income tax returns. The Joint
Committee on Taxation reported that this change would save $7.6 billion
over 10 years, which is more than enough to cover the $6 billion cut to
military retiree pensions.
Incremental changes to compensation generate uncertainty and are
corrosive to the all-volunteer military. By impacting the pensions of
current military retirees while grandfathering current civilian
employees, this provision was wrong.
Overall, the Bipartisan Budget Act was a positive step in the right
direction. However, the change in military pensions violates the
principle of 'Promises Made; Promises Kept' and I am glad that it was
corrected before the provision would have gone into effect. It is the
least we can do to demonstrate our support for America's troops,
retirees, and veterans.
Rest assured, I will keep your thoughts in mind as Congress continues
discussing ways to reduce our deficit and keep our military strong. I
count it a privilege to be your voice in Congress. Thank you for the
honor of serving you.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
I
promised
that
I
would
keep
you
updated
on
important
budget,
fiscal,
and
military
issues
that
are
taking
place
in
Washington.
As
you
remember,
on
December
12,
2013,
the
House
of
Representatives
passed
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act
by
a
vote
of
332-94.
The
Bipartisan
Budget
Act
set
overall
discretionary
spending
for
the
current
fiscal
year
at
$1.012
trillion&#8212;about
halfway
between
the
Senate
budget
level
of
$1.058
trillion
and
the
House
budget
level
of
$967
billion.
The
legislation
includes
dozens
of
specific
deficit-reduction
provisions,
with
mandatory
savings
and
non-tax
revenue
totaling
approximately
$86
billion.
The
agreement
would
reduce
the

by
$23
billion
without
raising
taxes .
Additionally,
the
bill
would
provide
$63
billion
in
sequester
relief
over
two
years,
split
evenly
between
defense
and
non-defense
programs.
Under
this
proposal,
defense
spending
would
receive
almost
$30
billion
more
over
the
next
two
years.
As
a
member
of
the
House
Armed
Services
Committee
and
a
strong
supporter
of
our
men
and
women
in
uniform,
I
am
pleased
that
this
budget
safeguards
our
national
defense
and
restores
$30
billion
in
previously
reduced
national
defense
funding. There
are
only
a
few
things
Congress
should
be
doing
according
to
the
Constitution,
and
one
of
them
is
to
provide
for
the
Common
Defense.
This
agreement
will provide
our
military
with
some
near-term

from
sequestration
and give
them
the
ability
to

the

The
restored
funding
can
be
used
to
improve
readiness,
increase
flight-training
hours,
purchasing
new
equipment,
and
help
our
troops
on
the
front
line.
One
of
the
most
controversial
ways
in
which
this
agreement
achieved
savings
is
through
reforms
to
military
retiree
pensions.
I
am
proud
to
report
to
you
that
the
proposed
reduction
in
military
retiree
pensions
has
been
reversed .
On
February
11,
2014,
the
House
of
Representatives,
with
my
support,
passed
S.25
that
repealed
the
reductions
in
military
retirement
pensions
that
were
part
of
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act
of
2013 .
The
President
subsequently
signed
this
legislation
into
law.
S.25
replaces
the
$6
billion
cut
to
military
retiree
pensions
with
fully
offset
reductions
to
mandatory
spending
elsewhere
in
the
budget.
From
the
moment
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act
was
signed
into
law,
I
took
steps
to
rectify
the
change
in
military
pensions.
I
signed
on
to
legislation
that
would
have
replaced
the
military
retiree
pension
cut
with
a
requirement
that
Social
Security
numbers
be
provided
by
people
claiming
the
child
tax
credit
on
their
income
tax
returns.
The
Joint
Committee
on
Taxation
reported
that
this
change
would
save
$7.6
billion
over
10
years,
which
is
more
than
enough
to
cover
the
$6
billion
cut
to
military
retiree
pensions.
Incremental
changes
to
compensation
generate
uncertainty
and
are
corrosive
to
the
all-volunteer
military.
By
impacting
the
pensions
of
current
military
retirees
while
grandfathering
current
civilian
employees,
this
provision
was
wrong.
Overall,
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act
was
a
positive
step
in
the
right
direction.
However,
the
change
in
military
pensions
violates
the
principle
of
&#8216;Promises
Made;
Promises
Kept&#8217;
and
I
am
glad
that
it
was
corrected
before
the
provision
would
have
gone
into
effect.
It
is
the
least
we
can
do
to
demonstrate
our
support
for
America&#8217;s
troops,
retirees,
and
veterans.
Rest
assured,
I
will
keep
your
thoughts
in
mind
as
Congress
continues
discussing
ways
to
reduce
our
deficit
and
keep
our
military
strong.
I
count
it
a
privilege
to
be
your
voice
in

Thank
you
for
the
