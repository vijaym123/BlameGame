Dear Fellow Nevadan:
I am
working in the Senate to create jobs and improve Nevadas economy. Last
week, we had a vote to increase the minimum wage to $10.10, which would
give 28 million Americans a raise. Raising the minimum wage puts more
money in the pockets of working families and increases consumer
spending, creating economic growth and new jobs. That is good for business,
both big and small, and good for our economy.
Seventy
percent of minimum wage workers are women and the average age of minimum
wage worker is 35. There is no reason that a mother working 40 hours a
week should not be able to afford to provide for her family. Raising
the minimum wage is a common-sense policy that should have bipartisan
support, but it is hard to make progress when Republicans block us from
even debating the bill on the Senate floor, which is what they did
last week. This is not the end of working to raise the minimum wage; I
will continue to fight for meaningful legislation that gives American
families a fair shot at prosperity.
Thank you for taking the
time to read this email. To learn more about my work in the Senate on

In The Silver
State
In Nevada last
month, Senator Dean Heller and I appeared together on KSNVs Whats
Your Point. (Jerry Henkel/Las Vegas
Review-Journal)
On Monday, April
14th, I joined the Regional Transportation Commission of Washoe
County for their unveiling of four new Proterra electric buses, the
first-electric buses for public transit use in the State of Nevada. These
buses were primarily funded through a $4.6 million grant from the federal
government.
On Tuesday, April 15th, I joined the CEO of Zappos
Tony Hsieh, on a tour of Zappos and the Downtown Project. I really
enjoyed our walk through downtown Las Vegas, and was encouraged to see
that over 600 direct local jobs have been created and 27 companies have
opened or relocated to this
area.
I was honored to
meet with this group of student veterans from UNLV, CSN, and Nevada
State College in Las Vegas. I thank these young men and women for their
service to our nation and their continued efforts in helping our
veterans.
