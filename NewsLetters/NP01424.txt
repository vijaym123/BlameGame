Thanks to an onerous and complicated tax code, American taxpayers and businesses spend
7.6 billion hours
a year filing their taxes. If that is not frustrating enough, in 2013, we learned the IRS targeted taxpayers based on their political beliefs. The House marked Tax Day by passing a number of bills to increase IRS accountability and protect taxpayers.
A
Taxpayer Bill of Rights
H.R. 1058
ensures taxpayers a basic set of rights when dealing with the IRS, including the right to confidentiality, fairness, quality service, and the right to appeal and for the appeal to be heard.
Prevent Targeting at the IRS Act
H.R. 709
would make political targeting of taxpayers a fireable offense at the IRS.
Taxpayer Knowledge of IRS Investigations Act
H.R. 1026
gives IRS needed transparency and provides taxpayers the right to know the status of investigations dealing with their personal information.
In a letter to the State Department this week, I requested information on behalf of Fourth District constituents regarding plans for a refugee resettlement in Spartanburg:
I write regarding the potential resettlement of refugees to the Spartanburg, South Carolina, area. It has been reported by media outlets, and confirmed by staff within your Departments Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM), that a resettlement agency submitted a proposal to open an office in Spartanburg. In addition, it is my understanding that the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) approved the request to resettle a certain number of refugees in Spartanburg.
As the Member of the U.S. House of Representatives representing the Spartanburg area, I am deeply concerned about the lack of notice, information, and consultation afforded to me and my constituents about this issue.
