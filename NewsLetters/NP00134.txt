The
President Must Develop Plan, Seek
Authorization To Defeat ISIL
Dear Friend,
Like all Americans, my grave concerns
about the Islamic State in Iraq and the
Levant (ISIL) have only grown over the past
10 months. There is no doubt that this
radical Islamic organization has
deliberately perpetrated unspeakable acts
of terror against innocent people and that
it poses a direct threat to the region and
our own national security.
ISIL is only growing and expanding its
reign of terror. Last month, it
took
over the key city of Ramadi
and
continues to seize U.S. military equipment
for its evil purposes. Over
60
Americans have been charged
with trying
to join ISIL or are suspected of supporting
the group in some other way; we have even
seen this here
in
Virginia . We must do more to dismantle
and destroy this radical terrorist
organization.
Ten months ago, the President addressed
the nation about the growing threat of ISIL
and commenced air strikes against its
forces, but clearly, these operations have
not achieved a great deal of success. Last
week, on an international stage,
he
admitted
that he does not yet have a
clear, complete strategy to defeat ISIL.
Given that American servicemen and women
are in the line of fire, this is absolutely
inexcusable. For ten months, we have led
more than
3,400
airstrikes
in Iraq and Syria and have
spent
nearly
$3 billion , all without authorization
from Congress.
In February,
the
President released a draft Authorization
for Use of Military Force resolution
against ISIL, but Congress cannot even
begin to consider the Presidents
request until he outlines a comprehensive
strategy. He must explain to Congress and
the American people what exactly it would
be voting to authorize. The Constitution
requires the President to obtain
authorization from Congress to wage war.
The American people and their
representatives in Congress must be
afforded the opportunity to engage in an
honest and candid debate on the scope of
any military action before sending our
brave men and women in uniform into
harms way.
As I met with veterans and active duty
service members across Virginias
Fifth District earlier this month, I was
once again reminded of the tremendous
sacrifice we ask of our troops who bravely
defend our interests both at home and
abroad. This is a stark reminder of the
need for a fully defined strategy before we
send our brave men and women into
danger.
It is my fervent hope that with pressure
from Congress and the American people, this
Administration will develop a strategy that
will indeed stop the malicious force that
is ISIL. And once the President does so, I
look forward to thoroughly considering his
request in Congress and giving all
Americans a say in this most important of
debates.
