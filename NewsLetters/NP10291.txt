Dear Friend:
Congress returns to Washington this week after our two week District Work Period, and I have to tell you
I had a great time visiting with folks from all across the district.
Being able to spend an extended amount of time in the district gives me the best opportunity to hear directly from the largest number of people I represent.
We kicked off our 3rd annual Made in GA tour of the 12th District over the work period, and I had the chance to learn about some of the great products we have coming out of our area.
I visited with companies in the 12th District that are making everything from parts for firearms to roofs for homes.
The best part about all of the places I toured is the jobs.
The 12th District is home to some of the greatest products being shipped around the world, and as long as we can continue to ensure these businesses have the skilled workforce they need to be successful and a government thats not going to get in their way, we've got bright days ahead of us.
Over the last two weeks, I also had the chance to
present students who completed our very first Barrows Bookworms reading challenge
with their certificates.
We had more than 1,300 students collectively read over 27,000 books last fall!
Im so proud of all of these students, as Im sure their parents and teachers are, and Im glad I had the chance to visit with so many of them to personally congratulate them for their hard work.
Back in Washington this week, were kicking off the appropriations process.
That means well be working to fund various departments within the federal government.
I want you to know that were looking at these bills closely, and trying to find areas where we can save your hard-earned tax dollars. I know how important it is to get rid of wasteful spending, and I'm working to cut unnecessary spending wherever we can.
If theres anything I can do for you while Congress is back in session, please dont hesitate to reach out.
Were here to help in any way we can.
Sincerely,
John Barrow
Member of Congress
