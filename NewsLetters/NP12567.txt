Dear Friend -
Thank you for taking the time to read my e-newsletter. I hope that you
find these updates on my work on your behalf useful and informative.
Last week, a bill I introduced passed the House
to allow expedited access to public lands for Good Samaritan search and
recovery organizations so they may conduct searches for missing persons.
I drafted this bill following the discovery of the bodies of Keith
Goldberg and Air Force Staff Sergeant Antonio Tucker in the Lake Mead
Recreation Area by Good Samaritan search and rescue teams. In both
cases, the volunteer search teams, and the families of the missing
persons, had to wait nearly one year to obtain the proper permits and
insurance before conducting their searches. My bill will help bring
peace of mind to the families of missing persons by expediting that
process so searches can be conducted. Grieving families should never
have to deal with jumping through bureaucratic federal hoops when
seeking the closure they deserve.

of my remarks about this bill during
House floor debate.
I hope you will keep reading to see my response to the State of the
Union and learn about my latest efforts to improve transparency and
security on the federal health exchange website. You can stay
up-to-date on my work in real time by connecting with me on social
media

As always, do not hesitate to contact me
if you have concerns about any issue currently before
Congress.
It remains an honor and privilege to serve you in the House
of Representatives.

My State of the Union Guest
I was pleased to welcome Clark High School AP Government teacher Amy
Evers to Washington as my personal guest for the 2014 State of the
Union. Mrs. Evers emailed me several weeks ago and it was clear she was
an ideal person to invite to the State of the Union address. Hopefully
she will take the experience back to her students at Clark and inspire
them to be engaged, informed citizens and active participants in
government.
My Response to the State of the Union
I released this statement following the President's State of the Union
Address: "Tonight the President laid out his agenda for the next year.
The Republican-led House also has an aggressive legislative agenda for
2014. In addition, I will be working on several of my local priorities
like the JOLT Act
and my Three Kids Mine bill
, both of which will create jobs in southern Nevada.
None of it will get accomplished if everyone talks past one another
trying to score political points. My hope is that both parties on both
sides of the Capitol can work together to find areas of common ground
and get some positive things done for the people we represent."
Health Exchange Security, Transparency Bills Pass House
ObamaCare continues to be a focus in the House of Representatives.
After the shaky rollout of the federal exchanges, there are still
concerns about the security of the site and the level of transparency
from the Administration. I maintain my belief that the law should be
repealed and replaced with patient-centered reforms that increase
access and decrease costs but in the meantime, we must ensure that the
exchange website and telephone call centers are secure as possible and
operating in a transparent manner. The House recently passed two
bipartisan bills that would do just that. The first requires consumers
to be notified of security breaches that could compromise personal data
on the exchange websites.
The second provides transparency for the
American people as they use the healthcare.gov exchanges by requiring
weekly reports on the site's functionality and any difficulties users
may be having. To learn more about my efforts to enact meaningful,
patient-centered reforms to our health care system visit

2013 in Review
Finally, I wanted to share with you a graphic that highlights my work
on your behalf in 2013. It is an honor and privilege to serve as your
voice in the House of Representatives and I look forward to working for
you in 2014!

I
released
this
statement
following
the
