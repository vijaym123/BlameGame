District
Stopping Illegal Immigration
Last week, I proposed legislation with Senator David Vitter to
secure our borders and quickly deport illegal immigrants.
You can
read about the legislation
here !
The
President has failed to secure the border.
We must reform
existing immigration laws and send a clear message that amnesty will not be
tolerated.
You can also watch my interview with WBRZ on this
topic
here !
Improving the VA
Last Monday, I
met with veterans
in the Sixth
District to hear about their experiences with the Department of Veterans'
Affairs.
Some spoke of nurses and doctors who provide great
care, while others spoke of the VA's bureaucratic system, which can delay
or effectively deny access to care.
I will continue
to talk with veterans about how to improve the VA and ensure they have
access to quality
healthcare.
Helping Working Families
Finally,
I proposed a bipartisan
bill
with Senators Deb Fischer and Angus King that would allow
part-time and full-time workers the ability to receive paid medical leave in
order to care for a new child or a sick family member.
Employers can voluntarily take advantage of this in exchange for a
tax credit.
Employees and employers should have the flexibility
to put their families first.
