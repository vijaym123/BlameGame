Protecting
Veterans
Recently, the House passed my
Veterans Traumatic Brain Injury Care Improvement
Act .
This bill would strengthen health services for veterans with
traumatic brain injuries.
Previously, I successfully secured an
extension of the health services from 5 to 8 years in the House and Senate
Veterans' Affairs reform bill.
We can help our veterans by
enhancing treatment services with proven results.
Ensuring our
veterans have access to quality treatment options is a top
priority.
Fixing Flood
Insurance
The National Flood Insurance
Program is
continuing to implement
the
Grimm-Cassidy Substitute Amendment to the Homeowner Flood Insurance
Affordability Act.
They announced timelines by which FEMA will begin to
issue revised preliminary flood maps.
It is critical that
updated maps are accurate and reflect the structural and non-structural
flood protection features that are in place.
I will continue to
monitor the implementation of Grimm-Cassidy to make sure homeowners are
treated fairly.
Holding the Obama
Administration Accountable
On Friday, President Obama announced that Attorney General Eric
Holder was resigning.
Mr. Holder sued Louisiana for trying to
improve our schools.
He tried to deny Louisiana children access
to the school of their parents' choosing.
Louisiana families
lost confidence in Mr. Holder years ago.
