Dear Friend,
Thank you very much for signing up for our eNewsletter. I appreciate
the opportunity to serve as your Representative. I wanted to give you
this update on our activities in the Second District and Washington,
D.C.
I had the special opportunity this week to record a Christmas message
to our troops overseas that will be broadcast over the American Forces
Network. While we celebrate Christmas at home with our friends and
family, these men and women spend that time away from their families in
order to protect our freedom.
Native American Veterans' Memorial
On Wednesday, H.R. 2319, the Native American Veterans' Memorial
Amendments Act, was passed unanimously out of the House Natural
Resources Committee. I am the original sponsor of the bill, I serve on
the committee, and I'm also a member of the Cherokee nation.
As Cherokee, we take pride in our heritage but we also take pride in
being American. Oklahoma has been blessed with countless Native
American veterans, including my grandfather Kenneth Morris, and it is
important that we properly honor these brave soldiers and tell their
story for generations to come. This memorial to our Native American
veterans will serve as a small measure of thanks for their service and
sacrifice to this great nation.
H.R. 2319 amends the Native American Veterans' Memorial Establishment
Act of 1994 to allow construction of a memorial to Native American
veterans on the grounds of the National Museum of the American Indian.
The memorial is currently authorized to be constructed inside the
confines of the museum, but with limited space within the museum
itself, many of us have worked towards a more appropriate tribute to
our Native American veterans.
The memorial cannot be paid for with taxpayer funds, so H.R. 2319
allows for the museum to raise money for its construction.
My fellow Native American in Congress, Congressman Tom Cole (OK-4), a
Chickasaw, is one of the 14 cosponsors of the legislation. We are the
only two Native Americans in Congress and consider it a privilege to
represent the Native American community.
The next step for H.R. 2319 will be the House floor for approval.
I always enjoy it when constituents come to visit our office in
Washington, D.C. This week we had Gerald Cleveland from Stigler stop by
the office.
Obamacare
The Administration announced this week it will kick off a diversionary
tactic to try and turn our attention away from the ever-unfolding flaws
in Obamacare. Emphasizing different themes each day until December 23,
this smoke and mirrors approach is further evidence that if a law needs
all of this effort to remind people why it was forced upon them, there
might be a problem with that law.
The dysfunctional HealthCare.gov website has cost nearly $1 billion.
While improvements were made for website users on the front-end,
problems with the website accurately delivering an enrollee's
information to insurance companies persist. Now the Administration
wants to spend even more taxpayer dollars to offer insurance companies
an "incentive" for keeping those insurance policies that were cancelled
starting next year despite the President's promises. Insurance
companies should not receive a bailout because of the President's
failures.
With skyrocketing premiums, delays, broken promises of being able to
keep your current health plan if you like it, and now questions on
website security, there will be no happy ending for Obamacare. The
majority of Americans do not like it. The majority of Oklahomans do not
like it. In the House, we will continue working towards sparing our
nation from the disastrous effects of Obamacare.
On Monday, the U.S. Capitol Dome and the Statue of Freedom celebrated
150 years. During the time of completion, we were a divided nation.
This building and statue served, and continue to serve, as a reminder
of the incredible blessing of freedom.
Issue Update
Congress could possibly reach a budget deal this next week. Congressman
Paul Ryan has been working with Senator Patty Murray to come to a
bicameral, bipartisan agreement. Our country cannot continue down the
path of only passing temporary funding measures. My hope continues to
be that we can come to an agreement that will responsibly fund the
federal government and avoid another government shutdown. The American
people deserve it.
Conference committee works continues on a farm bill and a water
infrastructure reform bill, both of which will greatly impact the state
of Oklahoma. A conference committee occurs when both chambers--the
House and the Senate--have their own separate versions of a similar
bill, and they come together to agree on a final version both chambers
can support. Congressman Frank Lucas (OK-3) serves on the conference
committee for the farm bill and I serve on the conference committee for
the water infrastructure reform bill.

Dear Friend,
Thank
you
very
much
for
signing
up
for
our
eNewsletter.
I
appreciate
the
opportunity to
serve
as
your
Representative.
I
wanted
to
give
you
this
update
on
our
activities
in
the
Second
District
and
Washington,
D.C.
I
had
the
special
opportunity
this
week
to
record
a
Christmas
message
to
our
troops
overseas
that
will
be
broadcast
over
the
American
Forces
Network.
While
we
celebrate
Christmas
at
home
with
our
friends
and
family,
these
men
and
women
spend
that
time
away
from
their
families
in
order
to
protect
our
freedom.
Native
American
Veterans'
Memorial On
Wednesday,
H.R.
2319,
the
Native
American
Veterans&#8217;
Memorial
Amendments
Act,
was
passed
unanimously
out
of
the
House
Natural
Resources
Committee.
I am
the
original
sponsor
of
the
bill,
I
serve
on
the
committee,
and
I'm
also
a
member
of
the
Cherokee
nation.
As
Cherokee,
we
take
pride
in
our
heritage
but
we
also
take
pride
in
being
American.
Oklahoma
has
been
blessed
with
countless
Native
American
veterans,
including
my
grandfather
Kenneth
Morris,
and
it
is
important
that
we
properly
honor
these
brave
soldiers
and
tell
their
story
for
generations
to
come.
This
memorial
to
our
Native
American
veterans
will
serve
as
a
small
measure
of
thanks
for
their
service
and
sacrifice
to
this
great
nation.
H.R.
2319
amends
the
Native
American
Veterans&#8217;
Memorial
Establishment
Act
of
1994
to
allow
construction
of
a
memorial
to
Native
American
veterans
on
the
grounds
of
the
National
Museum
of
the
American
Indian.
The
memorial
is
currently
authorized
to
be
constructed
inside
the
confines
of
the
museum,
but
with
limited
space
within
the
museum
itself,
many
of
us
have
worked
towards
a
more
appropriate
tribute
to
our
Native
American
veterans.
The
memorial
cannot
be
paid
for
with
taxpayer
funds,
so
H.R.
2319
allows
for
the
museum
to
raise
money
for
its
construction.
My
fellow
Native
American
in
Congress,
Congressman
Tom
Cole
(OK-4),
a
Chickasaw,
is
one
of
the
14
cosponsors
of
the
legislation.
We
are
the
only
two
Native
Americans
in
Congress
and
consider
it
a
privilege
to
represent
the
Native
American
community.
The
next
step
for
H.R.
2319
will
be
the
House
floor
for
approval.
I
always
enjoy
it
when
constituents
come
to
visit
our
office
in
Washington,
D.C.
This
week
we
had
Gerald
Cleveland
from
Stigler
stop
by
the
office.

Emphasizing

this

is
further
evidence
that
if
a

this

to
remind
people
why
it
was
forced
upon
them,
there
might
be
a

has
cost
nearly
$1

problems
with

for
keeping

With

and

there
