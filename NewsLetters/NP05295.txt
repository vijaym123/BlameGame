Friend -- &ldquo;Republicans are within reach of the Senate majority, but a few key races are still desperately close,&rdquo; reports
National Journal.
&ldquo;[Democrats&rsquo;] get-out-the-vote programs can boost them just enough to eke out the victories they need to maintain their majority.&rdquo;
But we need to warn you: 12 races are too close to call, and we can&rsquo;t fund our GOTV programs in all of them right now.
Tonight, our leadership team must make a grueling decision:
Can we fund every battleground, or do we need to cut a couple states loose in the final 13 days?
We will triple-match your gift until midnight -- this is SO important! Will you help us fund our Get Out the Vote operations in the next 8 hours?
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
Plain and simple: The difference between a one-seat Republican majority and a one-seat Democratic majority depends on how much we raise before midnight.
ABC News
reports, &ldquo;If Republicans... fall one seat short of controlling the Senate,
it will rank among the most crushing failures in recent political history.&rdquo;
It&rsquo;d be straight-up devastating.
We&rsquo;ve built an absolutely historic ground operation to mobilize voters -- we CAN tear victory away from the Republicans.
We need you now -- before midnight! Please, please, PLEASE step up and help us -- your gift be triple-matched and on the ground IMMEDIATELY.
Thank you,
