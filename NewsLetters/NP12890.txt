30 Day, 30 Ways
While the legislative role that congressional offices play is
well-known, many times our other services are overlooked.
To help
promote the many non-legislative services we offer, last week we began the
30 Days, 30 Ways constituent assistance promotion campaign.
Each day for 30 days, our office will be highlighting on
Facebook
and
Twitter
the various services
available through your 9 th
District Congressional office,
ranging from U.S. Capitol tours to assisting with Social Security
benefit issues.
If you
would like to follow along, all you need to do is Like our official
Facebook page at
www.facebook.com/RepToddYoung .
Each day we will be posting an infographic about how we can assist
you.
If you have any
questions about the services available through our office, please do not
hesitate to call the Jeffersonville Constituent Service Center at
812-288-3999.
2013 In
Review
As we began 2014, our
office took some time to see what was accomplished in the previous
year. Our staff and I are very proud of the accomplishments above, and we
are especially honored to have helped those constituents in need of
assistance. An important duty of a congressional office is to provide
exceptional constituent services, and we pledge to continue this
practice as we move into 2014.
Our mission, in regards to constituent
services, includes:
Assist any constituent who is having issues with a federal
agency
Ensure that all constituents, if
requested, receive a response to their
inquiries
Schedule tours for any 9 th
District
Constituent visiting Washington, D.C.
Be readily accessible to
constituents
One way in which we try to make our office more
accessible is by holding mobile office hours.
We understand that our
three permanent
district offices
may not be easily
accessible to everyone in the 9 th
District, which is why we
regularly set up temporary office locations across the district.
You can stay updated on our upcoming mobile office hours and other
district events by going to
https://www.facebook.com/RepToddYoung/events.
Our staff
and I will be looking forward to these events, in addition to another
great year of constituent services and assisting with whatever
troubles you may be facing.
This
Week
The President will
give his State of the Union address tomorrow, January 28.
Our
hopes are that the President will provide updates on many of the
challenges facing our country, including the status of Healthcare.gov,
dropped healthcare coverage due to ObamaCare, our national debt,
jobs
and unemployment, and our economic recovery.
The American
people need specific solutions to these problems, rather than the same,
nonspecific rhetoric we have heard in past speeches.
I remain
skeptical of his willingness to put forth such plans, having been
disappointed by the Presidents efforts to do so in the past.
That being
said, I look forward to hearing his address, maintaining hope that he
will give the American people the answers they
deserve.
Be sure to tune into the Presidents address
and look out for my response to his
speech.
Yours in Service,
Todd
