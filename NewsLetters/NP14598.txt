A Minute with Mike - October, 2013
Dear Friend,
Early in the month of October, our nation saw an unprecedented
breakdown of responsible governance. The House Republican Leadership
forced the government to shutdown in exchange for a laundry list of
conservative priorities. While I am relieved that a deal was struck to
re-open the government and avoid the first-ever default on our nation's
debt, the brinksmanship characterizing the process created unnecessary
doubt and damaged our economy.
It is essential for the health of our democracy that we end the threat
of default by holding the debt limit hostage. That is why I introduced
legislation in January of this year that provides a permanent solution
to the debt limit crisis while still allowing Congressional oversight.
Sensible people support this approach, such as the editorial boards of
The New York Times
and The Washington Post
. This is the responsible way to govern. By making
the lifting of the debt limit an "opt-out", rather than an "opt-in"
process, I believe that markets and everyday Americans will benefit
from increased certainty.
Beyond the fight over the shutdown, October was a busy month in
Congress. I hope you benefit from hearing about my work on behalf of my
constituents. As always, feel free to reach out to me on Facebook,
Twitter or email.
Sincerely,
Mike Honda
Member of Congress

Healthcare Exchanges Are Open
While the national Healthcare.gov website has experienced technical
difficulties, it is with great enthusiasm that I bring to your
attention the opening of Covered California. Created by the State of
California to carry out the Affordable Care Act, CoveredCA is the
health benefits exchange where legal residents of California who do not
have health insurance can purchase health coverage. Covered California
offers health plans from private insurers at good values that cover, at
a minimum, all essential health benefits. Thanks to the Affordable Care
Act, this coverage cannot be canceled or denied due to a pre-existing
medical condition or illness. Consumers can purchase insurance online
and access in-person and phone assistance 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week.
If you do not have insurance, you can enroll now at coveredca.com
. Tools such as a "shop and compare calculator"
are available to help you determine which
plan is best for you and your budget. For help enrolling, customers can
submit a request online, or call 1-800-300-1506. The enrollment period
for 2014 is open now until March 31, 2014.

Filipino American Heritage Month
October was Filipino American Heritage Month, celebrating the culture,
heritage and contributions of Filipino Americans to our nation. As
Silicon Valley's Representative in Washington, I continue to be
inspired by the vibrant community of more than 60,000 Filipinos and
Filipino Americans who reside in the 17th district of California.
Throughout my time in Congress, I have fought to ensure that our nation
recognizes those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the name of
service to our country. During World War II, 250,000 Filipinos bravely
answered President Roosevelt's call to defend democracy and fought
valiantly alongside American forces. That is why I was proud to help
secure the Filipino Veterans Equity Compensation Fund provision in the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. When the legislation was signed
in to law by President Obama in 2009, over 60 years had passed since
the U.S. government reneged on a promise to those Filipino veterans.
Our nation's gratitude and appreciation for their service is boundless.
>From arts, sciences, music, and literature, to those who fought under
the American flag, we honor the continued journey of Filipinos and
Filipino Americans.

Standing Against Chained CPI
I was proud to take a stand with my colleagues on Capitol Hill against
proposals to enact a "chained CPI" adjustment to ??Social Security?,
which would effectively cut benefits to seniors. Social Security is a
promise we made, and it's a promise we must keep. Every American
deserves the right to retire with dignity, and I will continue fighting
for policies that protect our seniors.??

Immigration Rally
It was a great honor to join the thousands of Americans gathered on the
National Mall to stand up for comprehensive immigration reform. Now is
the time for all Americans to stand up for reform that protects human
dignity and brings families together. I recently met with the White
House Chief of Staff to discuss prospects for ??immigration? reform. We
had a fruitful conversation and agree that we must fix this broken
system so everyone who comes to this country can achieve the American
Dream.??

Bullying Prevention Awareness Month
During national Bullying Prevention Awareness Month this October, I
wanted to bring attention to the story of Jadin Bell, who committed
suicide after he was bullied for being gay. In response, his father,
Joe Bell, began a Walk for Change across the country to raise awareness
of the effects of bullying. Sadly, he was stuck and killed by a tractor
tailor. As Chair of the Congressional Anti-Bullying Caucus, I'm working
to ensure our students don't have to go through anything like the Bell
family did. It is crucial that we all come together to end this
epidemic.

STEM Tuesday
This month, I introduced a new series of posts on Science, Technology,

behind Hollywood. Follow #STEMTues on Facebook and Twitter for more

JACL Award
On Thursday night, October 10, I was honored to receive the Champion of
Diversity Award from the National Japanese American Citizens League
(JACL) at their Gala Awards Dinner: A Salute to Champions of Diversity.
I was humbled to receive this award from such a prestigious
organization, and honored to have the support of former cabinet
secretary and Congressman Norm Mineta. I am proud of my work and will
continue to partner with JACL to ensure that civil rights are protected
and the people of all races, religions and nationalities are treated
with respect and dignity.

A
Minute
with
Mike
-
October,
2013
Dear
Friend,
Early
in
the
month
of
October,
our
nation
saw
an
unprecedented
breakdown
of
responsible
governance.
The
House
Republican
Leadership
forced
the
government
to
shutdown
in
exchange
for
a
laundry
list
of
conservative
priorities.
While
I
am
relieved
that
a
deal
was
struck
to
re-open
the
government
and
avoid
the
first-ever
default
on
our
nation&#8217;s
debt,
the
brinksmanship
characterizing
the
process
created
unnecessary
doubt
and
damaged
our
economy.
It
is
essential
for
the
health
of
our
democracy
that
we
end
the
threat
of
default
by
holding
the
debt
limit
hostage.
That
is
why
I
introduced
legislation
in
January
of
this
year
that
provides
a
permanent
solution
to
the
debt
limit
crisis
while
still
allowing
Congressional
oversight.
Sensible
people
support
this
approach,
such
as
the
editorial
boards
of
The
New
York
Times
and
The
Washington
Post .
This
is
the
responsible
way
to
govern.
By
making
the
lifting
of
the
debt
limit
an
&#8220;opt-out&#8221;,
rather
than
an
&#8220;opt-in&#8221;
process,
I
believe
that
markets
and
everyday
Americans
will
benefit
from
increased
certainty.
Beyond
the
fight
over
the
shutdown,
October
was
a
busy
month
in
Congress.
I
hope
you
benefit
from
hearing
about
my
work
on
behalf
of
my
constituents.
As
always,
feel
free
to
reach
out
to
me
on
Facebook,

or

Mike

Bullying
Prevention
Awareness
Month
During
national
Bullying
Prevention
Awareness
Month
this
October,
I
wanted
to
bring
attention
to
the
story
of
Jadin
Bell,
who
committed
suicide
after
he
was
bullied
for
being
gay.
In
response,
his
father,
Joe
Bell,
began
a
Walk
for
Change
across
the
country
to
raise
awareness
of
the
effects
of
bullying.
Sadly,
he
was
stuck
and
killed
by
a
tractor
tailor.
As
Chair
of
the
Congressional
Anti-Bullying
Caucus,
I&#8217;m
working
to
ensure
our
students
don&#8217;t
have
to
go
through
anything
like
the
Bell
family
did.
It
is
crucial
that
we
all
come
together
to
end
this
