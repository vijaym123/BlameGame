Statement on Potential Cuts to Fort
Carson
6/26/14
Following the release of a worst-case scenario
environmental study on the impact of potential Army force reductions,
Congressman Doug Lamborn issued the following
statement.
"The information being reported today
comes from an absolute worst-case scenario situation. This is a planning
exercise undertaken by the Army to evaluate the environmental impacts
of a potential reduction in force. My staff and I were aware of this
study and are going to be keeping a close eye this situation. I will do
everything in my power, in Washington DC and in Colorado Springs, to
oppose any dangerously high cuts to Fort
Carson."
"I want to remind people of two
facts. First, Fort Carson is viewed favorably by the Army and the
Department of Defense. That is why the arrival of the new Combat Aviation
Brigade, and the associated economic impacts of the new personnel and
facilities, is so important. It shows that this region is viewed
favorably by planners in the Pentagon. Second, studies of this nature are a
direct result of the disastrous policy of budget sequestration. I did
not vote for this policy and have opposed it from the beginning. When we
are asking so much of our brave men and women in uniform, we must
fully fund, equip, and train them before sending these friends,
neighbors, and loved ones into harm's way. I will continue to be a leading
voice in the cause of fully funding our
military."
