Rep. Bruce Braley -- Iowa's First
District
David,
Bullying is a very serious issue in our schools, and it should never,
ever be tolerated.
Students deserve to learn in a safe space that promotes a positive,
healthy and creative learning environment -- free from bullying and
harassment.
That's why Senator Harkin and I have introduced legislation that will
help prevent bullying, harassment, and violence in schools.
Our bill, called the Successful, Safe, and Healthy Students Act, will
help our students thrive in the classroom and beyond by taking on the
problem of bullying head-on.
And I want you to be part of our legislation:

and Healthy Students Act to get updates on this important bill.
My wife, Carolyn, teaches here in Waterloo. I know from her experience
that even great schools have their share of bullying. But with school
budgets tight, there's not enough funding to focus on improving the
learning environment.
Our legislation establishes two grant programs: one to support positive
conditions for learning by promoting student health and fitness, mental
health and counseling services, and drug and violence prevention; and a
second grant to establish programs to give local leaders the
information they need to improve the conditions for learning in their
schools and communities.
Sign on as a citizen cosponsor of our legislation, get updates, and
learn more here.
Our children deserve to learn in an environment free from bullying, and
it's our hope that this legislation will get us closer to that reality.
All the best,
Bruce
