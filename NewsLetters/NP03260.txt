Dear Friends,
In
his State of the Union address Tuesday, President Obama pointedly
noted that hed run his last campaign. Yet hes having a hard time
letting go.
Wednesday he flew to Boise and held what the
Washington Post called something of a pep rally at Boise State. The
president reminded listeners of his 2008 campaign stop and how winning the
Idaho caucus helped propel him to office.
As many have
written, the president seems determined to set the stage for his party to
retain the White House in 2016.
Thats his call. But it flies
in the face of promises to work with Republicans in his final two
years.
The presidents State of the Union was peppered with
veto threats. He glossed over the fact the middle class has suffered
greatly on his watch. He failed to recognize that the economic turnaround
began when Republicans took over after the 2010 election and put the
brakes on his liberal initiatives.
Instead, he proposed
tax-and-spend ideas he couldnt get passed when Democrats controlled both
houses of Congress -- policies that would threaten the fragile
recovery.
In short, hes failed to accept that the American people
repudiated his agenda in the November election.
Still, Im
glad the president came to Idaho, home of hard work, self-reliance
and balanced budgets. Im pleased he met with Naghmeh Abedini to discuss
the governments efforts to secure the release of her husband, Saeed,
from prison in Iran.
I always try to remain optimistic.
Theres still time for president to follow the model of Bill Clinton and
others who learned from mid-term defeats.
He says he wants
to eliminate tax loopholes. So do I. What Im not willing to do is
increase spending and add to our $18 trillion debt.
Americans
voted for change because theyre worried about bread-and-butter
issues. The House has already passed jobs bills to clear the way for the
Keystone XL pipeline, put veterans back to work and ease regulations to
reduce energy costs.
If the president will step away from
campaign mode, he can join us in getting serious about solving
Americas problems.
Thank you ,
