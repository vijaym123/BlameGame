 we have been working for in trying to get the General Services Administration to redevelop the historic building for 15 years.
The project is a win for the federal government, the Trump Organization, and especially the District of Columbia, which will get millions in tax revenue and hundreds of jobs.
Good News for D.C.'s Marijuana Decriminalization Bill
On May 30, I noted that House passage of an amendment to prohibit the Drug Enforcement Administration from targeting medical marijuana operations in states where they are legal was historic, as the first-ever pro-marijuana vote.
If it passes, the bill, of course, would protect our own medical marijuana law in case there is a president who is opposed to medical marijuana.
However, the passage also helps defend D.C.'s marijuana decriminalization bill
from being blocked or overturned by Congress.
The amendment passed 219 to 189, showing growing bipartisan support at least for medical marijuana.
We remain on guard to see that there is no congressional interference with the D.C. marijuana decriminalization bill.
Remembering Maya Angelou
On May 28, I released a statement on the passing of my friend Dr. Maya Angelou.
My friend Maya Angelou needed every one of her 86 years to live her rich life as a renaissance woman - writer, poet, actor, dancer, screenwriter, professor, civil rights activist, and on top of all that talent, Maya also was a cook extraordinaire.
For the rest of the statement, see my press release .
On May 29, I honored Maya Angelou
with a Special Order Hour on the House floor.
Working to Fully Fund Metro
I am pleased that our work succeeded in getting $150 million for Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority
included in the House fiscal year 2015 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill, which passed the House Appropriations Committee on May 21.
The Fight to Retain DCTAG Funding Gets a Boost
On May 30, I said that the D.C. Council's decision to decline to fund D.C. Promise was important because the city does not have the financial capacity to continually fund a significant college scholarship program, like D.C. Promise or the D.C. Tuition Assistance Grant (DCTAG) program, particularly with federal funding already available to D.C. students.
The Council's decision to pass on funding the program will help our fight to maintain funding for DCTAG , especially after the Promise bill was passed by the Council despite warnings from Congress that it could risk DCTAG funding.
Speaking Up for LGBT Communities
On May 23, I kicked off the 24th annual DC Black Pride Festival
with members of D.C.'s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.
I also recognized the celebration, which is widely considered one of the world's preeminent Black Pride celebrations, with a statement in the Congressional Record.
On May 29, I spoke at the 8th annual DC Latino Pride celebration .
I was pleased to have the opportunity to speak following an impressive discussion on challenges faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Latino youth and family acceptance during the coming out process.
Combatting Obesity with a Physical Fitness Month Bill
Last month, National Physical Fitness Month, I introduced a bill
to combat obesity and sedentary lifestyles through education, training health professionals, and developing intervention strategies.
We are making progress considering the attention First Lady Michelle Obama has brought to fitness and healthy eating.
However, there is no national bill, and obesity and overweight are still out of control, particularly among kids.
