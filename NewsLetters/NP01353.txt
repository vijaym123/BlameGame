David -- It&rsquo;s an exciting time to be a Democrat. There&rsquo;s an energy in the air
(and in the swing states)
that I haven&rsquo;t felt since the 2008 election.
And just like then, the Presidency, control of the Senate -- and now the future of everything we&rsquo;ve fought for -- will depend on the EARLY investments we make in critical states.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking you to support the DSCC today. Can I count on you to pitch in right now?

I know the value of an early gift. I was thankful for it when the DSCC became an important force behind my election to the Senate in 2004. And in 2008, they helped elect a strong Democratic majority that was able to pass some of the biggest achievements of my presidency.
We need the DSCC to elect the next generation of champions to keep our progress going -- and I need your help to make sure that happens.
So please, if you don&rsquo;t want to see Republicans dismantle the progress we&rsquo;ve made, donate to the DSCC. It will count so much more in these early days.
Thank you,
