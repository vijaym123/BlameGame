VISITING DC
March 14, 2014
This week the Senate passed S. 1086, the Child Care
and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act of 2014, legislation I
co-authored with Senator Barbara Mikulski (MD). For years, I, along with some
of my colleagues, have been calling for the Senate to return to
regular order where legislation is introduced, considered through the
committee of jurisdiction, and debated in the United States Senate with a
full and robust amendment process.
Although taking this
legislative route can be time consuming and, admittedly, become frustrating
when progress is not instantaneous, the result almost always is a more
durable law that has the support of most legislators and, most
importantly, the American people.
S. 1086 passed by an overwhelming vote
of 96-2, validating the importance of legislating in this
manner.
This legislation improves the quality of child care in
North Carolina by ensuring certain basic health and safety precautions
are taken by people who care for kids while their parents are at
work.
Overall, this week was a good one for the United States Senate,
our working parents, and their children.
Within CCDBG, I
was also pleased to see the Senate approve the Boxer-Burr amendment,
which would close a dangerous loophole in the national background
check system for child care providers located on federal property,
including military installations. When parents drop their kids off at child
care centers on federal property, they deserve the peace of mind to
know that the facility has taken basic precautions to ensure the safety
of the children in their care. This amendment makes a commonsense fix
to update requirements for background checks to stop dangerous
individuals from slipping through the cracks and while improving our
childrens security.

On Tuesday, the subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging held a
hearing titled Access and Cost: What the US Health Care System Can Learn
from Other Countries, which included discussion about single payer,
government run systems. I think this hearing represents an important
admission by the Senate that Obamacare is not working. That such an
admission takes place within the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions
Committee
the very committee that wrote the Affordable Care Act
-- is a huge step, and I commend the committee for taking
it.
Health care was broken before Obamacare, but four years later the
American people are experiencing firsthand how the new law has made things
worse. The President promised that if you liked your plan you could
keep it. Under Obamacare, the federal government mandates that
Americans buy health coverage, and not just any coverage, but the coverage the
Federal government says is good enough. Millions of Americans have
lost their health planshealth plans they liked and wanted to keep
despite the promises and continued delays of the Administration. Obamacare
expanded Medicaidan unsustainable health entitlement program in which
some 40 percent of physicians on average do not even see Medicaid
patients. The President promised that Obamacare would bring down premiums
by $2,500, premiums have gone up on average 41 percent in the
individual market due to Obamacares mandates.
Is it any wonder
why Americans view the law unfavorably?
However, some Senate
Democrats see Obamacare as a launching pad for setting up a single payer
system in the United States. I think Americans at this point are
understandably wary of still more government involvement in health care,
particularly the degree of government involvement that we see in the
single payer systems around the world that are being held up as "models"
for a future American system.
If you are interested in
the issue of single payer health care, or curious what the consequences
of single payer health care might be, I encourage you to watch the
full hearing
here . You can

Sincerely,
Richard Burr
