david, I try hard to keep this race about the issues.
But my opponent is trying to do just the opposite.
This morning, Ex-Congressman Schilling accused me of lacking
&ldquo;character and integrity.&rdquo;
Wow. How desperate. David, I believe integrity matters.
But it&rsquo;s clear Mr. Schilling doesn&rsquo;t share our values.
When polls close, I&rsquo;m going to be proud of our campaign, no matter the outcome. If you&rsquo;re with me for the final 13 days, please make a small contribution today. http://action.cheribustos.com/donate
Illinois, I&rsquo;m so proud to have your support.
Kindest Personal Regards,
