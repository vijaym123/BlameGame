News from Representative John Delaney
February 3, 2014
Dear Friend,
As we begin celebrating Black History Month, I write to you in
remembrance and recognition of the African Americans who have made a
difference in our country. Maryland is home to many African Americans
who forever changed the future of our nation in their fight for greater
equality and through their contributions in fields as diverse as
science, the arts and law. As a Member of Congress, I am committed to
ensuring that the role of African Americans in United States history is
never forgotten.
To celebrate Black History Month, each day this February our office
will be highlighting on Facebook
an African American from Maryland who
made a difference. Our state is home to many trailblazers who overcame
incredible challenges to take a stand for civil rights, from Harriet
Tubman, who worked to free slaves through the Underground Railroad, to
Thurgood Marshall, the first African American Supreme Court justice and
a lawyer in the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court case that
desegregated schools across the United States. The brave work of these
individuals not only secured important rights for minorities in the
United States, but also pushed our nation to live up to its values of
freedom, equality and democracy.
Throughout February, keep an eye on our Facebook page for each day's
Black History Month feature
.
Together, these African Americans have helped to make the United States
a leader, not only as a nation of free people, but as a frontrunner in
research, technology and artistic achievement. Black History Month is a
time to remember their message and to continue our work to provide
future generations with the opportunity to build on their success.
As a Representative of Maryland's 6th Congressional District, I am
proud to celebrate their legacy.
Sincerely,
John
