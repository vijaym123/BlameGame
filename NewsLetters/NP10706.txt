Dear Friend,
I wanted to share with you an op-ed
that I wrote earlier this week. In my op-ed I talk about how
the long term visions and strategic planning of Fort Worth and Dallas,
as well as the surrounding communities, is beginning to pay off and
strengthen North Texas as a region.
Sincerely,
Kay Granger
Member of Congress
How Strategic Planning Is Paying Off and Strengthening North Texas
Roll Call - April 8, 2014
While the country as a whole has been paralyzed from years of slow
economic growth, Fort Worth and Dallas haven't let that blur their
visions for their own futures.
As the former mayor of Fort Worth, I understand the growing pains of a
community on the rise. I have a unique appreciation for the dedication
of local business leaders and elected officials who give their all to
see their cities reach full potential. After years of strategic
planning and smart infrastructure and economic development, our
long-term planning is paying off and in big ways.
For example, Fort Worth has made critical investments to increase the
usage of the convention center with the addition of first-class hotels
and the evolution of a pedestrian friendly downtown, and they have
widened roads including Interstate 35 to accommodate increased traffic,
especially on NASCAR weekends. Dallas has made similar investments with
the American Airlines Center and the North Dallas Tollway to alleviate
traffic going in and out of the Dallas area as well as serve as a hub
for hotel accommodations for major sporting events like the Super Bowl.
All of these investments have been coupled with a welcoming business
climate to encourage companies to base their operations in the region.
The Dallas area is now home to 18 Fortune 500 companies, and Fort Worth
was just named the best mid-sized downtown in the nation. Our local
economics are growing, unemployment levels are dropping, and people are
moving to North Texas in droves because of good paying jobs and
affordable housing. The Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington area added 108,000
people in the past year, the third-largest population increase in the
nation behind Houston and New York, according to new estimates from the
Census Bureau for the 12 months that ended in July.
In turn, Fort Worth now ranks No. 1 as the best place in the country to
find a job. Dallas is on the short list for the 2016 GOP National
Convention, and ESPN retuned to the new Sundance Square Plaza in
downtown Fort Worth to broadcast their Final Four coverage as they did
when the Metroplex hosted the Super Bowl in 2011. Fort Worth is also
home to the Texas Motor Speedway, which brings in over 100,000 fans
from across the country to the North Texas area on race weekends.
In terms of local development, all the pieces of the puzzle are coming
together to make both communities the most highly prized locations to
live and work in the nation. As a representative and resident of Fort
Worth, I am most proud to see the vision that so many have planned for
now coming into full sight.

Dear
Friend,
I
wanted
to
share
with
you
an
op-ed
that
I
wrote
earlier
this
week.
In
my
op-ed
I
talk
about
how
the
long
term
visions
and strategic
planning of Fort
Worth
and Dallas,
as
well
as
the
surrounding
communities, is
beginning
to
pay off
and
strengthen
North
Texas
as
a region.
Sincerely,

How
Strategic
Planning
Is
Paying
Off
and
Strengthening
North
Texas Roll
Call
-
April
8,
2014
While
the
country
as
a
whole
has
been
paralyzed
from
years
of
slow
economic
growth,
Fort
Worth
and
Dallas
haven&#8217;t
let
that
blur
their
visions
for
their
own
futures.
As
the
former
mayor
of
Fort
Worth,
I
understand
the
growing
pains
of
a
community
on
the
rise.
I
have
a
unique
appreciation
for
the
dedication
of
local
business
leaders
and
elected
officials
who
give
their
all
to
see
their
cities
reach
full
potential.
After
years
of
strategic
planning
and
smart
infrastructure
and
economic
development,
our
long-term
planning
is
paying
off
and
in
big
ways.
For
example,
Fort
Worth
has
made
critical
investments
to
increase
the
usage
of
the
convention
center
with
the
addition
of
first-class
hotels
and
the
evolution
of
a
pedestrian
friendly
downtown,
and
they
have
widened
roads
including
Interstate
35
to
accommodate
increased
traffic,
especially
on
NASCAR
weekends.
Dallas
has
made
similar
investments
with
the
American
Airlines
Center
and
the
North
Dallas
Tollway
to
alleviate
traffic
going
in
and
out
of
the
Dallas
area
as
well
as
serve
as
a
hub
for
hotel
accommodations
for
major
sporting
events
like
the
Super
Bowl.
All
of
these
investments
have
been
coupled
with
a
welcoming
business
climate
to
encourage
companies
to
base
their
operations
in
the
region.
The
Dallas
area
is
now
home
to
18
Fortune
500
companies,
and
Fort
Worth
was
just
named
the
best
mid-sized
downtown
in
the
nation.
Our
local
economics
are
growing,
unemployment
levels
are
dropping,
and
people
are
moving
to
North
Texas
in
droves
because
of
good
paying
jobs
and
affordable
housing.
The
Dallas-Fort
Worth-Arlington
area
added
108,000
people
in
the
past
year,
the
third-largest
population
increase
in
the
nation
behind
Houston
and
New
York,
according
to
new
estimates
from
the
Census
Bureau
for
the
12
months
that
ended
in
July.
In
turn,
Fort
Worth
now
ranks
No.
1
as
the
best
place
in
the
country
to
find
a
job.
Dallas
is
on
the
short
list
for
the
2016
GOP
National
Convention,
and
ESPN
retuned
to
the
new
Sundance
Square
Plaza
in
downtown
Fort
Worth
to
broadcast
their
Final
Four
coverage
as
they
did
when
the
Metroplex
hosted
the
Super
Bowl
in
2011.
Fort
Worth
is
also
home
to
the
Texas
Motor
Speedway,
which
brings
in
over
100,000
fans
from
across
the
country
to
the
North
Texas
area
on
race
weekends.
In
terms
of
local
development,
all
the
pieces
of
the
puzzle
are
coming
together
to
make
both
communities
the
most
highly
prized
locations
to
live
and
work
in
the
nation.
As
a
representative
and
resident
of
Fort
Worth,
I
am
most
proud
to
see
the
vision
that
so
many
have
planned
for
now
coming
into
full
sight.
