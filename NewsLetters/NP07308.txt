We&rsquo;re nearly out of time -- so we won't waste any: News just broke that Boehner shook down his Tea Party Republicans THIS MORNING for last-minute cash.
Boehner knows that if he can beat us on tonight&rsquo;s deadline -- after everything that&rsquo;s happened -- then all hope will be lost for us to win a Democratic House.
To be blunt about it: There are just 96 days until the election. If we fall behind now, we can just throw in the towel on a Democratic House for President Obama&rsquo;s final two years.
We just ran the numbers: it&rsquo;ll take another 8,947 donations before tonight&rsquo;s midnight fundraising deadline to be able to compete.
David -- if you&rsquo;re planning to chip in soon, we could really use your support before tonight&rsquo;s deadline. MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: ALL GIFTS TRIPLE-MATCHED! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
