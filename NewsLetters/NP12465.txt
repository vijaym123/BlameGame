February 08, 2014
Dear Friends,
This week, the Senate passed
the Agricultural Act of 2014 , commonly known as the farm bill.
This was my fourth and final farm bill as a member of Congress, and I
was pleased to support this legislation, which passed the Senate by a
vote of 68-32. As a former chairman and ranking member of the Senate
Agriculture Committee, I am proud we were able to pass a bill that
balances the needs and interests between
all of the crops, regions,
and rural and urban communities that the bill
impacts.
This bill reforms critical farm programs, strengthens the nations
food security, protects the livelihood of our farmers and ranchers, and
preserves our efforts to remain good stewards of the environment.
Above all, this bill contains important cost saving measures that tackle
the single greatest domestic issue we face: our debt and deficit.
Through consolidation, reforms, and streamlining of programs, the Senate
and House Agriculture Committees stepped up and made the tough decisions
necessary to find savings. Unknown to many, 79% of the farm bill is
made up of nutrition assistance program spending, and only 4.6% of the
bill goes towards commodity programs that provide the safety net for
farmers and ranchers across this nation. The other spending in the bill
is divided between crop insurance, conservation, rural development,
energy programs, and other various items. Although I would have
preferred to see more savings in the food stamp programs, this bill is a step
in the right direction towards reducing government
spending.
Congress took this opportunity to take a fresh look at our
commodity programs. Maintaining an effective safety net is critical to
Americas farmers, and the farm bill eliminates direct payments while
enhancing options for farmers to manage risk. Agricultural producers face a
combination of challenges, such as unpredictable weather, variable
input costs, and market volatility that all combine to determine profit or
loss in any given year. We should provide options to farmers while at
the same time act as responsible stewards of the taxpayer, and I feel
that this farm bill achieves that goal.
Moreover, our
nations farmers and landowners deserve to have long-term conservation
program certainty to effectively and efficiently manage their land and
resources for the years ahead. This bill consolidates 23 existing
programs into 13 and reduces spending by $6 billion over 10 years, while
still supporting clean air, clean water, and productive
soils.
Conservation programs are also critical in helping producers avoid
unnecessary regulation, and they support our nation's long-term economic
and food security. I also want to highlight language in this bill
that links conservation compliance to crop insurance. My amendment led
many leading agricultural, conservation, and crop-insurance groups to
come together and forge a compromise, ensuring crop insurance doesnt
compromise our natural resources for generations to come.
The
farm bill also serves as a safety net for the nutritional well-being
of low-income Americans to ensure that needy Americans have access to
the food they need to lead healthy, productive lives. This includes
not only food stamps, but support for food banks and food pantries.
Given our fiscal climate, I am pleased were able to find savings and
eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in these nutrition programs, while still
ensuring those truly in need are provided a helping
hand.
Ultimately, we must ensure that American farmers continue to produce
high quality food to feed the country. One of the pleasures of my job is
to represent those who work the land each and every day. I am proud
that we have achieved a farm bill that does this and incentivizes those
for generations to come to continue to produce the highest quality
agricultural products in the world.
It has been my distinct
honor to represent and work with the farmers and ranchers in Georgia
for 20 years, and I am fortunate to have had the privilege of serving on
an outstanding Agriculture Committee during my time in Congress. I am
proud that we have passed this legislation that is vitally important
to the farmers, ranchers and consumers of Georgia, as well as those
across this great nation.
Very Truly
Yours,
