ABOUT RYAN
ISSUES
I just wanted to take a moment to say
it is an honor to serve you and have your trust. Senator Steve Daines
left big shoes to fill but I am confident that Conservative
principles, traditional Montana values and decades of serving our great nation
as a U.S. Navy SEAL will help me be an effective leader for
Montana.
