Heller Statement on Presidents
Budget Blueprint
(Washington, D.C.)
U.S.
Senator Dean Heller (R-NV) issued this
statement in response to the budget
blueprint President Obama unveiled
today:
"The budget blueprint President Obama
unveiled today is just more of the same
from an Administration that refuses to
acknowledge the effect of crushing debt on
our nation's economy. Last week, Senator
Patty Murray from Washington - the Senator
responsible for shepherding our nation's
budget through Congress - said that she has
no plans to actually pass a budget this
year. This pattern of irresponsibility is
exactly why I introduced No Budget,
No Pay, which requires both chambers
of Congress to pass a final budget
resolution and all spending bills on time
every year in order to receive pay.
By failing to acknowledge the
dire reality of our nation's fiscal state,
this Administration and Congress are
forcing future generations to pay the price
for today's mistakes. Both the House of
Representatives and the Senate should
commit to completing their responsibilities
to the American people and pass a budget
and all twelve appropriations bills this
year.
