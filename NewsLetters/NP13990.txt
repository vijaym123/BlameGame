Critical Health Bills Advance to Presidents Desk
Dear Friend:
One of my top priorities as House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman is advancing bipartisan legislation that puts the health and safety of our nations families first.
Last week, I joined House Speaker John Boehner as he signed two critical public health bills, bringing them one step closer to enactment.
The first was the PREEMIE Reauthorization Act (S.252) which continues and strengthens federal research and programs related to preterm birth. While we have made tremendous advances in this area, an estimated half million babies are born premature in the United States each year.
S.252 notably includes language advanced by my committee earlier this year as stand-alone legislation
the National Pediatric Research Network Act of 2013 (H.R.225)
which seeks to help Michigan children and their families with unmet health needs, including those battling rare and genetic diseases. Specifically, this provision allows the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to fund pediatric research consortium that are formed from cooperating institutions to promote greater research efficiency and collaboration.
This effort will help families like the Kennedys in Mattawan, whose young daughters, Brooke and Brielle, who have the rare disease Spinal Muscular Atrophy. These two little angels are little warriors in the effort to boost research for rare diseases and serve as an inspiration for all.
The sad reality is it is often difficult to conduct research into rare diseases due to the small number of individuals with the disease. But with this legislation, we are working to change that, and provide families with greater hope for a cure or advances in treatment.
The Speaker also signed my bipartisan Drug Quality and Security Act (H.R. 3024) which seeks to improve drug safety in the wake of the deadly 2012 meningitis outbreak, which by all accounts has hit Michigan hardest. To the dozens of families who have lost loved ones and to the hundreds who are still suffering today, with this bill we say never again.
My bill also strengthens the prescription drug supply chain in order to protect American families against counterfeit drugs as well as eliminates needless government red tape that harms Michigan employers like Perrigo and Pfizer.
Both bills show the importance of putting policy ahead of politics and will soon head to the Presidents desk to be signed into law.
Wishing you and your loved ones a safe and happy Thanksgiving.
God bless,
Fred Upton
