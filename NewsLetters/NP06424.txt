Two Important House Veterans Affairs
Committee Hearings
9/10/14
Today, Congressman Doug
Lamborn took part in two hearings of the House Veterans Affairs
Committee. First, the Congressman participated in a legislative markup of
the full Veterans Affairs
Committee.
Legislation that passed included bills to allow bonuses to
be taken back from underperforming VA employees, expand dialysis
pilot programs and medical research, provide a report to Congress on
traumatic brain injury programs, add executive performance metrics and
performance program requirements for VA doctors, and require the Board of
Veterans' Appeals to schedule appeal hearings at the earliest possible
date. Also debated and unanimously approved by the Committee was
legislation, co-sponsored by Congressman Lamborn, from Congressman Mike
Coffman (CO-06) requiring the Army Corps of Engineers to step in and
assist the VA with overdue medical facility construction projects, such
as the VA Hospital in Aurora, Colorado.
Additionally, Congressman Lamborn questioned witnesses during
a meeting of the Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations discussing mismanagement in the Board of Veterans'
Appeals.
"Today we took important
steps to advance legislation helping our brave veterans to the House
Floor. Even as we work to improve conditions for veterans, new
problems and issues continue to come to light. I know that the Veterans
Affairs Committee will do everything possible to streamline and improve the
issues and problems plaguing the Board of Veterans' Appeals. This
should be a tool and a resource for veterans, not a headache and a
holdup."
