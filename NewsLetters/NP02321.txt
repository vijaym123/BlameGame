Questioning the Interior Secretary on Energy Production and the Browns
Canyon Land Grab
3/5/15
Today, during a hearing of the
House Natural Resources Committee, Congressman Doug Lamborn grilled
Interior Secretary Sally Jewell on the issue of energy production on
federal lands and President Obama's Browns Canyon land
grab.
"Despite what you may hear from the
Obama Administration, the acreage being leased by the federal
government for American energy production is 50% less than what was being
leased during the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Because
American energy production creates jobs and leads to greater energy
security for our citizens, you have to ask yourself, 'why would
President Obama continue to put up every possible roadblock to expanding
energy production on federal
lands?'
I will continue to use my leadership position as Chairman
of the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources to press the Obama
Administration to increase both onshore and offshore energy
production. Federal lands should be open and available for multiple uses,
including responsible energy development.
Regarding Browns Canyon, contrary to
Secretary Jewell's claims, there was not a sufficient amount of public
input before the President unilaterally claimed it as a National Monument.
When properties are created in this manner, they often become
underfunded, neglected properties. This is because they are created
without normal Congressional and local consensus, robbing the people of a
fair and open process that stifles the input of the community. Then,
when the next Administration arrives, they become orphans. Does Browns
Canyon really deserve this kind of second-class
status?
