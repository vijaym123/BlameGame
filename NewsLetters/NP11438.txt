Dear Friend,
This week, I urged Speaker Boehner to finally allow a vote to extend
unemployment insurance, President Obama announced a plan to help ensure
all Americans are fairly paid for working overtime, and both houses of
the Tennessee General Assembly delayed a vote on the Governor's
ill-advised plan to raid funds meant for the HOPE Scholarship. Keep

Working for Unemployed Memphians
At the end of last year, unemployment insurance expired for more than a
million Americans. Since then, House Republican leaders have blocked
multiple attempts to bring up legislation to extend this critical
lifeline. People who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own
shouldn't have to wait another day for Speaker Boehner to allow a vote
on their unemployment benefits. The more than 31,000 Tennesseans who
rely on the unemployment insurance program to put food on their tables
and pay their rent need Congress to act immediately. That's why I
joined my colleagues in signing a "discharge petition" that-if a
majority of the House signs-will force Speaker Boehner to stop blocking
a vote on unemployment insurance and allow the House to have its say.
Expanding Opportunity for All
Yesterday, President Barack Obama announced a plan to help make sure
millions of people who work overtime are paid a fair wage for a hard
day's work. Today, eighty-eight percent of salaried workers don't
qualify for overtime protections because they make more than $455/week-a
wage that would leave a family of four in poverty. The President's
announcement is another step in his effort to ensure that everyone who
works hard and plays by the rules gets an opportunity to succeed. I
applaud the President for this announcement and look forward to working
with him to make sure that all Memphis families have a fair shot at
success.
Fully Funding the HOPE Scholarships
This week, the House and Senate Education Committees in the General
Assembly deferred votes on Governor Haslam's "Tennessee Promise"
proposal. They were right to allow more time to consider the
far-reaching consequences of siphoning money from the successful
Tennessee Education Lottery Scholarship program to create a huge new
government program. I wrote a column in the Commercial Appeal this week
explaining those consequences that you can read here
.
However, full legislative consideration needs more than a week's
postponement-it requires public input and time to fully consider
pitfalls. The General Assembly should create a study committee,
requiring perspective from educators and citizens, to ensure that
Tennesseans know not only about the "Promise" program but what its
creation will mean for the future of HOPE scholarships.
The "Promise" will not only create a massive new government program, it
will sentence the HOPE scholarship - a successful program that helps
educate thousands of Tennesseans - to a slow and certain death. It will
split the lottery scholarship program in half, creating a junior
college program with no achievement incentive or standards, spreading
resources too thin and making the success of either program unlikely.
The plan will also immediately reduce scholarship amounts for students
entering 4-year colleges by 1/4th, making school harder to afford,
saddling students with heavier student loan burdens, and increasing the
likelihood they will need to work more hours-which reduces the chance
of maintaining their grades. Expecting students to foot even more of
the bill for their educations is the wrong way to treat students who
have worked hard to earn the HOPE scholarship.
Even worse, the Governor's "Tennessee Promise" will divert all future
lottery revenue gains from the HOPE scholarships-eliminating their
ability to grow with tuition costs. That's especially troubling because
today's HOPE scholarship covers a smaller portion of tuition than it
did 10 years ago. The Governor's program will slash it further and stop
all future scholarship increases. In fact, with tuition continuing to
skyrocket, the only "Promise" the Governor's plan makes is that HOPE
scholarships will cover just 20% of tuition 10 years from now.
Deferring the votes on the Governor's plan is a good first step. Now,
the General Assembly must create a study committee tasked with
determining the full impact of the Governor's proposal. It should hear
from educators, fiscal experts, and students who have benefited from
HOPE scholarships, to understand the full consequences of enacting the
Governor's plan.
Once that happens, I hope that legislators will see the harm that
"Promise" will do to our hardworking middle-class students and vote the
plan down. A better option would be to increase the ASPIRE award for
middle- and low-income families and fully fund HOPE scholarships.
Ensuring Memphians Get the Tax Returns They Deserve
The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is too important for people to
overlook, and everyone who is eligible should claim it when filing
their taxes. But historically, eligible taxpayers in Memphis and Shelby
County have not taken full advantage of the program-last year alone, as
much as $70 million in potential tax credits were left on the table by
area taxpayers.
Memphians shouldn't pay more than they owe, and they should receive
every penny they deserve in refunds. That's why I attended the grand
opening of one of 15 new Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) sites
that recently opened throughout Shelby County to provide guidance and
advice free of charge to ensure that eligible Shelby County citizens
take advantage of programs like the EITC and get the tax refund they
are entitled to. Click here
to find a VITA site near you to help ensure you get every penny
you are owed.
Speaking Out Against the ENFORCE the Law Act
On Wednesday, the House debated the so-called "ENFORCE the Law Act,"
which is yet another one of the Republicans' attempts to distract the
American people from real issues by attacking President and the
Affordable Care Act. It would allow just one chamber of the legislative
branch to sue the President without approval of the other chamber if it
believes the President hasn't properly enforced the law, even though
the Constitution gives him wide discretion on how best to implement
laws. This legislation is just a show to give those on the other side
of the aisle another reason to attack the President for doing his job,
and you can watch me speaking out against it on the floor of the House
here
.
Helping Memphians Get Covered
All Memphians should have quality health insurance and the President's
landmark Affordable Care Act is making affordable, higher-quality
coverage available to people who have not had access to it in the past.
Luckily, many who have been unable to afford quality coverage in the
past are now eligible to enroll in Tennessee's Health Insurance
Marketplace
. Please don't forget that the open season
deadline to enroll in health coverage for this year at HealthCare.gov
is March 31st. And if you do not have health insurance coverage,
you may also be eligible to save money on your health care premiums
in the Marketplace.
If you are on Medicare or your employer is offering qualified health
insurance that you are enrolled in, you're already covered and won't
need to enter the Marketplace for your health coverage. If you aren't
sure whether or not you should use the Marketplace to get insurance,
call the Marketplace Hotline at 1 (800) 318-2596, visit
www.HealthCare.gov
, or call Tennessee's navigator, Seedco, at (901) 528-8341.
You can also call my office at (901) 544-4131 or the Marketplace
Hotline to find out if TennCare (Tennessee's Medicaid program) is a
coverage option for you. If you are one of the millions of Americans
who need health insurance, you can sign up
for coverage for 2014 until the open
enrollment period closes on March 31st, 2014. Visit www.healthcare.gov
today to look at your options.
The Affordable Care Act is already working for families across the
Ninth District. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, 147,000 individuals in the district now have health insurance
that covers preventive services without co-pays, $3.1 million in
insurance premiums have been returned to consumers, and more than 5,000
seniors on Medicare paid a total of $5.9 million less for their
prescription medications as we continue to close the 'donut hole.'
Also, health insurance companies can no longer discriminate against
patients with pre-existing conditions and young adults up to age 26 can
now stay on their parents' insurance plan.
Many of the Marketplace website issues that have been in the news have
been resolved. However, the Marketplace website is only one tool that
you can use to sign up for coverage. If you are having trouble
accessing the website, please do not hesitate to call the Marketplace
Hotline at 1 (800) 318-2596 or visit the Affordable Care Act Navigators
at Seedco's Mid-South office at 22 North Front Street (Suite 900) for
in-person help. Seedco can also be reached by phone at (901) 528-8341,
and if you have any other questions, you should feel free to call my
office at (901) 544-4131.
Congratulating the Minority Business Development Council on its 45th
Anniversary
This month, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) celebrates
its 45th Anniversary. Since it was established in 1969, the MBDA has
worked to promote the growth and global competitiveness in the minority
business community. On Wednesday, I spoke on the House floor about the
good work the MBDA and Memphis MBDA Business Center-which I'm pleased
to have helped bring to our city as the first MBDA center in Tennessee-
have done and continue to do. You can watch my speech here
.
Fighting for Sane Criminal Laws
I'll be on MSNBC Live tomorrow just after noon to discuss what I'm
doing to change current policies regarding marijuana. Our criminal drug
policy is deeply rooted in racism and is out of step with what the
American people believe. Current federal policies unfairly hurt
minority communities and have resulted in 4 times as many African
Americans arrested for marijuana compared to Caucasians, even while
nearly half of the states have decided to make it legal for medical or
personal use.
Our policies haven't kept up with the science, they haven't kept up
with the medical community, and they sure haven't kept up with the
American people. When a law is almost universally perceived as wrong,
it breeds disrespect for our legal system. Americans young and old
think federal marijuana policy is a joke. They know that marijuana
shouldn't be in the same category with heroin, and they don't support
taking one's liberty away because of marijuana.
It is imperative that we take an honest look at why we have the drug
laws we have today and how and why they should be changed. To
paraphrase Maya Angelou--when we know better, we should do better. I'll
be on MSNBC Live tomorrow just after noon to discuss this important
issue, and I hope you'll tune in!
Protecting Voting Rights
This morning members of the House Judiciary Committee, on which I serve
as Ranking Member of the Constitution Subcommittee, met with Leader
Nancy Pelosi, other members of our Leadership, Congressman John Lewis,
and others to discuss how to advance the Voting Rights Amendment Act
(VRAA). Unfortunately last year, in a misguided decision, the Supreme
Court found part of the Voting Rights Act unconstitutional. The VRAA
would address this terrible decision and I am working hard to see it
passed into law.
United States Naval Academy Summer Programs
Each year, the United States Naval Academy invites more than 3,000
students to Annapolis, Maryland, to participate in its summer programs.
The Academy's summer STEM program, which is now accepting applications
here
, gives rising 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th graders the opportunity
to learn from some of the best college professors in the country and
work in world-class lab facilities. The Academy's Summer Seminars gives
rising 12th graders the opportunity to find out if they have what it
takes to be midshipmen by allowing them to experience the rigorous
academics, physical challenges, and student life at the Naval Academy.
More information about the Summer Seminar and how to apply is available
here
.
Make Sure to Claim Unclaimed Property
The State of Tennessee maintains a searchable database of unclaimed
property, which can include bank accounts, stocks and dividends, wages,
refunds, insurance payments, gift certificates, credit balances and
overpayments, and a number of other things. There is no cost for
accessing the database, and you may find that you are owed money or
property. If you have not searched the database yet or if you haven't
searched in a while, you can visit https://www.claimittn.gov
and see for yourself whether the state is holding any
property or assets for you.
Helping Veterans Become Homeowners
Last year, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs helped a record
number of veterans obtain mortgage loans and become homeowners
. In guaranteeing nearly 630,000 home loans, the VA's Loan
Guarantee program helped more veterans become homeowners or move to a
new home than at any point in its 70-year history. Not only is this
great news for veterans, but it also is another sign that our housing
market is rebounding-and that is good news for everyone. The VA Loan
Guarantee program has some of the lowest foreclosure rates around and,
along with offering low interest rates, their loans do not require a
down payment from first-time buyers. If you are a veteran looking to
purchase a home, you can learn more about the program here
.
Grant Announcements
I regularly release a list of grant announcements from federal agencies
like the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, and others. These
federal funding opportunities are available to faith-based and
neighborhood associations, nonprofits and other community organizations
in the Ninth District. The announcements are updated regularly on my
website
.
As always, I remain.

Working
for
Unemployed
Memphians
At
the
end
of
last
year,
unemployment
insurance
expired
for
more
than
a
million
Americans.
Since
then,
House
Republican
leaders
have
blocked
multiple
attempts
to
bring
up
legislation
to
extend
this
critical
lifeline.
People
who
have

through
no

The
more
than

who
rely

the
unemployment

program
to
put

and

need
Congress

That&#8217;s
why
I
joined
my

in
signing
a
&#8220;discharge

that&#8212;if
a

force

to
stop

and
allow

Expanding
Opportunity
for
All
Yesterday,
President
Barack
Obama
announced
a
plan
to
help
make
sure
millions
of
people
who
work
overtime
are
paid
a
fair
wage
for
a
hard
day&#8217;s
work.
Today,
eighty-eight
percent
of
salaried
workers
don&#8217;t
qualify
for

protections
because
they
make
more
than
$455/week&#8212;a
wage
that
would
leave
a

of
four
in

The

announcement
is
another
step
in
his
effort
to
ensure
that
everyone
who
works
hard
and
plays
by

I
applaud
the
President
for
this
announcement
and
look
forward
to
working
with
him
to
make
sure
that
all
Memphis
families
have
a
fair
shot
at
success.
Fully
Funding
the
HOPE
Scholarships
This
week,
the
House
and
Senate
Education
Committees
in
the
General
Assembly
deferred
votes
on
Governor
Haslam&#8217;s
&#8220;Tennessee
Promise&#8221;
proposal. They
were
right
to
allow
more
time
to
consider
the
far-reaching
consequences
of
siphoning
money
from
the
successful
Tennessee
Education
Lottery
Scholarship
program
to
create
a
huge
new
government
program.
I
wrote
a
column
in
the
Commercial
Appeal
this
week
explaining those
consequences
that you can
read
here .
However,
full
legislative
consideration
needs
more
than
a
week&#8217;s
postponement&#8212;it
requires
public
input
and
time
to
fully
consider
pitfalls. The
General
Assembly
should
create
a
study
committee,
requiring
perspective
from
educators
and
citizens,
to
ensure
that
Tennesseans
know
not
only
about
the
&#8220;Promise&#8221;
program
but
what
its
creation
will
mean
for
the
future
of
HOPE
scholarships.
The
&#8220;Promise&#8221;
will
not
only
create
a
massive
new
government
program,
it
will
sentence
the
HOPE
scholarship
&#8212;
a
successful
program
that
helps
educate
thousands
of
Tennesseans
&#8212;
to
a
slow
and
certain
death.
It
will
split
the
lottery
scholarship
program
in
half,
creating
a
junior
college
program
with
no
achievement
incentive
or
standards,
spreading
resources
too
thin
and
making
the
success
of
either
program
unlikely.
The
plan
will
also
immediately
reduce
scholarship
amounts
for
students
entering
4-year
colleges
by
1/4th,
making
school
harder
to
afford,
saddling
students
with
heavier
student
loan
burdens,
and
increasing
the
likelihood
they
will
need
to
work
more
hours&#8212;which
reduces
the
chance
of
maintaining
their
grades.
Expecting
students
to
foot
even
more
of
the
bill
for
their
educations
is
the
wrong
way
to
treat
students
who
have
worked
hard
to
earn
the
HOPE
scholarship.
Even
worse,
the
Governor&#8217;s
&#8220;Tennessee
Promise&#8221;
will
divert
all
future
lottery
revenue
gains
from
the
HOPE
scholarships&#8212;eliminating
their
ability
to
grow
with
tuition
costs.
That&#8217;s
especially
troubling
because
today&#8217;s
HOPE
scholarship
covers
a
smaller
portion
of
tuition
than
it
did
10
years
ago.
The
Governor&#8217;s
program
will
slash
it
further
and
stop
all
future
scholarship
increases. In
fact,
with
tuition
continuing
to
skyrocket,
the
only
&#8220;Promise&#8221;
the
Governor&#8217;s
plan
makes
is
that
HOPE
scholarships
will
cover
just
20%
of
tuition
10
years
from
now.
Deferring
the
votes
on
the
Governor&#8217;s
plan
is
a
good
first
step.
Now,
the
General
Assembly
must
create
a
study
committee
tasked
with
determining
the
full
impact
of
the
Governor&#8217;s
proposal.
It
should
hear
from
educators,
fiscal
experts,
and
students
who
have
benefited
from
HOPE
scholarships,
to
understand
the
full
consequences
of
enacting
the
Governor&#8217;s
plan.
Once
that
happens,
I
hope
that
legislators
will
see
the
harm
that
&#8220;Promise&#8221;
will
do
to
our
hardworking
middle-class
students
and
vote
the
plan
down.
A
better
option
would
be
to
increase
the
ASPIRE
award
for
middle-
and
low-income
families
and
fully
fund
HOPE
scholarships.
Ensuring
Memphians
Get
the
Tax
Returns
They
Deserve
The
Earned
Income
Tax
Credit
(EITC)
is
too
important
for
people
to
overlook,
and
everyone
who
is
eligible
should
claim
it
when
filing
their
taxes.
But
historically,
eligible
taxpayers
in
Memphis
and
Shelby
County
have
not
taken
full
advantage
of
the
program&#8212;last
year
alone,
as
much
as
$70
million
in
potential
tax
credits
were
left
on
the
table
by
area
taxpayers.
Memphians
shouldn&#8217;t
pay
more
than
they
owe,
and
they
should
receive
every
penny
they
deserve
in
refunds.
That&#8217;s
why
I
attended
the
grand
opening
of
one
of
15
new
Volunteer
Income
Tax
Assistance
(VITA)
sites
that
recently
opened
throughout
Shelby
County
to
provide
guidance
and
advice
free
of
charge
to
ensure
that
eligible
Shelby
County
citizens
take
advantage
of
programs
like
the
EITC
and
get
the
tax
refund
they
are
entitled
to.

Speaking
Out
Against
the
ENFORCE
the
Law
Act
On
Wednesday,
the
House
debated
the
so-called
&#8220;ENFORCE
the
Law
Act,&#8221;
which
is
yet
another
one
of
the
Republicans&#8217;
attempts
to
distract
the
American
people
from
real
issues
by
attacking
President
and
the
Affordable
Care
Act.
It
would
allow
just
one
chamber
of
the
legislative
branch
to
sue
the
President
without
approval
of
the
other
chamber
if
it
believes
the
President
hasn&#8217;t
properly
enforced
the
law,
even
though
the
Constitution
gives
him
wide
discretion
on
how
best
to
implement
laws.
This
legislation
is
just
a
show
to
give
those
on
the
other
side
of
the
aisle
another
reason
to
attack
the
President
for
doing
his
job,
and
you
can
watch
me
speaking
out
against
it
on
the
floor
of
the
House
here .
Helping
Memphians
Get
Covered
All
Memphians
should
have
quality
health
insurance
and
the
President&#8217;s
landmark
Affordable
Care
Act
is
making
affordable,
higher-quality
coverage
available
to
people
who
have
not
had
access
to
it
in
the
past.
Luckily,
many
who
have
been
unable
to
afford
quality
coverage
in
the
past
are
now
eligible
to
enroll
in
Tennessee&#8217;s
Health
Insurance
Marketplace .
Please
don&#8217;t
forget
that
the
open
season
deadline
to
enroll
in
health
coverage
for
this
year
at
HealthCare.gov
is
March
31st.
And
if
you
do
not
have
health
insurance
coverage,
you
may
also
be
eligible
to
save
money
on
your
health
care
premiums
in
the
Marketplace.
If
you
are
on
Medicare
or
your
employer
is
offering
qualified
health
insurance
that
you
are
enrolled
in,
you&#8217;re
already
covered
and
won&#8217;t
need
to
enter
the
Marketplace
for
your
health
coverage.
If
you
aren&#8217;t
sure
whether
or
not
you
should
use
the
Marketplace
to
get
insurance,

Congratulating

Development
Council
on
its
45 th
Anniversary
This
month,
the
Minority
Business
Development
Agency
(MBDA)
celebrates
its

Since

promote
the
growth
and
global
competitiveness

On

I
spoke
on

House
floor
about
the
good
work
the
MBDA
and
Memphis
MBDA
Business
Center&#8212;which
I&#8217;m
pleased
to
have
helped
bring
to
our
city
as
the
first
MBDA
center
in
Tennessee&#8212;have
done
and
continue
to
do.

Fighting
for
Sane
Criminal
Laws
I&#8217;ll
be
on
MSNBC
Live
tomorrow
just
after
noon
to
discuss
what
I&#8217;m
doing
to
change
current
policies
regarding
marijuana.
Our
criminal
drug
policy
is
deeply
rooted
in
racism
and
is
out
of
step
with
what
the
American
people
believe.
Current
federal
policies
unfairly
hurt
minority
communities
and
have
resulted
in
4
times
as
many
African
Americans
arrested
for
marijuana
compared
to
Caucasians,
even
while
nearly
half
of
the
states
have
decided
to
make
it
legal
for
medical
or
personal
use.
Our
policies
haven&#8217;t
kept
up
with
the
science,
they
haven&#8217;t
kept
up
with
the
medical
community,
and
they
sure
haven&#8217;t
kept
up
with
the
American
people.
When
a
law
is
almost
universally
perceived
as
wrong,
it
breeds
disrespect
for
our
legal
system.
Americans
young
and
old
think
federal
marijuana
policy
is
a
joke.
They
know
that
marijuana
shouldn&#8217;t
be
in
the
same
category
with
heroin,
and
they
don&#8217;t
support
taking
one&#8217;s
liberty
away
because
of
marijuana.
It
is
imperative
that
we
take
an
honest
look
at
why
we
have
the
drug
laws
we
have
today
and
how
and
why
they
should
be
changed. To
paraphrase
Maya
Angelou--when
we
know
better,
we
should
do
better.
I&#8217;ll
be
on
MSNBC
Live
tomorrow
just
after
noon
to
discuss
this
important
issue,
and
I
hope
you&#8217;ll
tune
in!
Protecting
Voting
Rights
This
morning
members
of
the
House
Judiciary
Committee,
on
which
I
serve
as
Ranking
Member
of
the
Constitution
Subcommittee,
met
with
Leader
Nancy
Pelosi,
other
members
of
our
Leadership,
Congressman
John
Lewis,
and
others
to
discuss
how
to
advance
the
Voting
Rights
Amendment
Act
(VRAA). Unfortunately
last
year,
in
a
misguided
decision,
the
Supreme
Court
found
part
of
the
Voting
Rights
Act
unconstitutional. The
VRAA
would
address
this
terrible
decision
and
I
am
working
hard
to
see
it
passed
into
law.

the
United
States
Naval

more
than
3,000
students
to
Annapolis,

professors
in
the
country
and

in
world-class
lab
facilities.
The
Academy&#8217;s
Summer
Seminars
gives
rising
12th
graders
the
opportunity
to
find
out
if
they
have
what
it
takes
to
be
midshipmen
by
allowing
them
to
experience
the
rigorous
academics,
physical
challenges,
and
student
life
at
the
Naval
Academy.

Make
Sure
to
Claim
Unclaimed
Property
The
State
of
Tennessee
maintains
a
searchable
database
of
unclaimed
property,
which
can
include
bank
accounts,
stocks
and
dividends,
wages,
refunds,
insurance
payments,
gift
certificates,
credit
balances
and
overpayments,
and
a
number
of
other
things.
There
is
no
cost
for
accessing
the
database,
and
you
may
find
that
you
are
owed
money
or
property.
If
you
have
not
searched
the
database
yet
or
if
you
haven&#8217;t
searched
in
a
while,
you
can
visit
https://www.claimittn.gov
and
see
for
yourself
whether
the
state
is
holding
any
property
or
assets
for
you.
Helping
Veterans
Become
Homeowners
Last
year,
the
U.S.
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
helped
a
record
number
of
veterans
obtain
mortgage
loans
and
become
homeowners .
In
guaranteeing
nearly
630,000
home
loans,
the
VA&#8217;s
Loan
Guarantee
program
helped
more
veterans
become
homeowners
or
move
to
a
new
home
than
at
any
point
in
its
70-year
history.
Not
only
is
this
great
news
for
veterans,
but
it
also
is
another
sign
that
our
housing
market
is
rebounding&#8212;and
that
is
good
news
for
everyone.
The
VA
Loan
Guarantee
program
has
some
of
the
lowest
foreclosure
rates
around
and,
along
with
offering
low
interest
rates,
their
loans
do
not
require
a
down
payment
from
first-time
buyers.
If
you
are
a
veteran
looking
to
purchase
a
home,
you
can
learn
more
about
the
program
here .

the
Ninth
District.
