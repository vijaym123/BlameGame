Friends,
During a meeting this
week with my House Republican colleagues, I was given a handout
prepared by the House Armed Services Committee that included the chart
below. I find it especially troubling.
The red portion is
mandatory spending, which includes entitlement spending such as Social
Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Non-defense spending is the sliver
in green. It includes a broad set of programs: education, job
training, environmental protection, border security, veterans health
care, scientific research, transportation, economic development, some
low-income assistance, law enforcement, and international assistance. The
blue portion represents what we spend on defense and military
operations, and the purple portion is the interest we pay on our countrys
debt.
As you see, mandatory government spending is
projected to increase and outpace all other government spending by
2018just four years from now.
We must restore fiscal sanity in
Washington and make the hard cuts, while ensuring that the programs
Americans rely on are sustainable.
This is not an
easy task but must be done so our children and grandchildrenhave a bright
financial future.
Americans are tired of all talk and no
action, which is why I asked the Appropriations Committee, who is in
charge of our nations spending bills, to cut fivepercent from each
bill - -
except
defense.
Our families and local governments have cut far more
than five percent from our budgets, it is time for our federal
government to do the same. This cut is a step towards restoring fiscal sanity
in Washington.

House Establishes Select
Committee on Benghazi
It has been
two years since four Americans were brutally murdered during a terrorist
attack on our Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.
In an attempt to
save face during an election year, the Administration and State
Department blamed an inflammatory YouTube video for the attack.
After
admitting terrorists were responsible for the attack, the Administration
continued to feed Americans misinformation.
Upon
request of the families and to ensure justice is served, House committees
have aggressively investigated this attack.
I have fully
supported these investigations and joined my colleagues in demanding that
the House form a Select Committee to further investigate the
attack.
I am pleased to inform you that Speaker Boehner on Friday announced
that he will appoint a special committee to investigate the terrorist
attack in Benghazi, and South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy will
potentially head the investigation.
7th District Students
Compete in DC
I thoroughly
enjoyed meeting with a great group of young people last week from
Carolina Forest High School. These intelligent students visited Washington,
DC for the We The People Competition held on Capitol Hill every year.
Carolina Forest was one of only 56 schools who qualified for the
National Finals. Congratulations to these talented students!
InstaPoll: Corporate Tax
Rates:
According to multiple news outlets,
American pharmaceutical company, Pfizer Inc., is pursuing the purchase of
British medical company, Astrazeneca, and moving its U.S. headquarters
overseas. Pfizers CEO said the company is exploring this option
because our countrys tax code (which is the highest in the world) is too
burdensome and it makes more sense financially to purchase a foreign
company and relocate.
Do you think our corporate tax rate is too high? Yes. No. I do
not feel strongly either way.
