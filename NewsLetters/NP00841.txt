Dear Friend,
No one in America who works full-time, or works multiple jobs, should struggle just to make ends meet.
Ours is a nation built on the promise that if you put in an honest day&rsquo;s work, you can build a better life for yourself and your family. That&rsquo;s how the son of a milkman from Malden grows up to write to you today as a United States Senator.
It&rsquo;s the American Dream.
But for millions of Americans working minimum wage jobs, that dream is slipping away.
The federal minimum wage is just $7.27 an hour. For workers who make that wage, it&rsquo;s not enough to get by -- let alone get ahead. I&rsquo;m working to raise the minimum wage to at least $12 an hour by 2020 and give workers struggling to climb the ladder a fighting chance. Sign the petition to join me.
Our federal minimum wage has not been raised since 2009 -- and its purchasing power has been mostly falling since 1968.
Working a full-time job should give you financial security, opportunity, and dignity -- not frustration and hopelessness. The minimum wage in Massachusetts is already higher than the federal level, and I have been working to do the same in Washington.
Today, I need your support. Call on Congress to raise the minimum wage. Sign the petition today.
Thank you.
