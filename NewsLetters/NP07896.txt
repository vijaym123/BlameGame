Dear Friend:
It&#39;s an honor to represent the Lower Hudson Valley in the United States Congress&#44; and an important part of this public service is making sure you know how I&#39;m working for you throughout our district as well as in our nation&#39;s capital.
The easiest way to stay up-to-date is to
like my Facebook page
and follow me on
Twitter
. Social media is a critical tool for us to interact&#44; communicate&#44; and express views on subjects that affect our every&#45;day lives.
You can also
sign up to receive my e&#45;Newsletter
on a regular basis.
As always&#44; if you have questions or need assistance&#44; please contact my office in Westchester County at &#40;914&#41; 428&#45;1707&#44; Rockland County at &#40;845&#41; 639&#45;3485&#44; or Washington, D.C. at &#40;202&#41; 225&#45;6506&#44; and we will do all we can to help.
Sincerely,
