Getting rid of unnecessary regulations that hurt small community banks
In the aftermath of the near total collapse of the American economy in
2008, Congress passed financial reform legislation to crack down on the

National Community Bank on State Street in Montpelier, he announced
bipartisan legislation to provide regulatory relief to small community
banks. Read more here
