Dear Friend,
A helpful chart I thought would be worth sharing from the Heritage Foundation:
Fighting to rein in Washingtons current, uncontrolled spending is not optional, its imperative
to our childrens future and the future of this nation. Recently, Ive worked to
strengthen accountability
in federal spending,
opposed raising the debt celing , and supported
legislation
to ensure paying our debt is a priority. Read more about my fight,
here .
