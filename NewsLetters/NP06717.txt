We are at the end of our rope.
We&rsquo;ve never been so far behind GOP spending this close to an ad buy deadline.
We don't want to give up and let Karl Rove's $1.4 MILLION Obama-bashing ads go unanswered -- but right now, we simply don't have what it takes to fight back.
We're sorry, but we have to ask you again -- will you step up and save the day before our ad buy deadline at midnight?
