(February 24, 2015 - U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen
calls for funding of the Department of Homeland Security on Capitol
Hill)
Dear Friends,
Ever since the start
of the year Ive been fighting in Washington to make sure we fully fund
the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and keep critical national
security resources from expiring. This issue should never have been
the source of controversy; everyone should agree that we cannot play
politics with critical resources that keep our country safe. And in fact,
a bipartisan agreement struck last year between the House and Senate
even laid out the budget for this funding. But unfortunately, a small
group of lawmakers wanted to use DHS funding to spark an unrelated,
partisan fight at the expense of our national security and that put the
agency at risk of a shutdown.
As I traveled across New
Hampshire, local fire chiefs, first responders and state officials all
said the same thing: the consequences of an agency shutdown would have
been disastrous for our local communities. But because of their input,
and because of the overwhelming support from the American people,
Congress ultimately took responsible action and did the right thing. I want
to thank everyone who spoke out and made clear that shutting down the
Department of Homeland Security was unacceptable.

Law enforcement and first responders put their lives on the line
to keep us and our communities safe every day. I was proud to fight
on their behalf to make sure they continued to have the resources they
need to do their jobs, and I will continue to put New Hampshires
priorities first here in the Senate.
Sincerely,
