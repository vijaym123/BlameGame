Hi, it&rsquo;s me again. I wish I could send you videos of my Cats...
but alas, we&rsquo;re 38 days out from the election, so they&rsquo;re making me send you another email asking for money.
Republicans are set to spend $4.5 million on T.V. to beat up on my record. (That doesn&rsquo;t even count all the nasty letters already in your mailboxes!)
$4.5 million might not mean much, but it&rsquo;s actually more money being spent than by almost any House race in the country.
Luckily, I&rsquo;ve got an army of grassroots supporters backing me up -- more than 22,000 strong. So, whether this is your 1st gift or your 5th, I&rsquo;m asking you to please make a donation tonight -- before time runs out to make a difference.
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks everyone,
Brad
