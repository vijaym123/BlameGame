Dear David,
Memorial Day is a time to reflect
on our nations history and honor those who fought and died in serving
our country.
Our nations brave men and women fulfilled their
patriotic duty and made the ultimate sacrifice so that our nation would
one day emerge as the worlds most respected
democracy.
To all our nations men and women in uniform who are currently
serving, I extend my gratitude.
Each day that our men and women serve
reminds us that they are committed to making the ultimate sacrifice
when called upon.
Thank
you.
Respectfully,
Gloria
Negrete McLeod
