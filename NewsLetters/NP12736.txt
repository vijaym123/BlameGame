House Passes Five-Year Farm
Bill
Knowing of your interest in agricultural issues, I wanted
to update you on Congress most recent actions regarding the farm bill.
On January 29, 2014, the House of
Representatives, with my support, passed the conference report to H.R.
2642, the
Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act
of 2014 , which will authorize federal agriculture programs for
five years.
While I was disappointed that
the bill did not contain greater reforms to the crop insurance and
farm subsidy programs, I felt that it was important Congress pass a five
year farm bill that will provide a good framework for the important
business of agriculture in our state and across the country.
It
also includes important reforms to the dairy
program.
The Senate is expected to take up the conference report next
week, and if approved, it will then be sent to the President for
signature.
