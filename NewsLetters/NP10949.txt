HELLERS REMARKS
Remarks as prepared
:
Thank you Chairman McCaskill.
I want to begin by offering my deepest
sympathies to the families and friends who
were affected by these
tragedies. I want you all to
know that we will get to the bottom of why
it took so long to get these vehicles off
the road.
As many of you know, General Motors has
issued a recall of over 2.2 million
vehicles due to problems with the ignition
switch that GM has admitted to knowing
about in some form as early as 2001. These
faulty ignition switches have been linked
to 13 deaths
GM has now recalled certain years of the
Chevy Cobalt, the Pontiac G5, the Saturn
Ion, the Chevrolet HHR, the Pontiac
Solstice and the Saturn Sky.
Last Friday, it was reported that,
sometime in 2006 or late 2007, General
Motors, changed the ignition switch
part. A whole new part was
manufactured and sold. But GM kept
the same model number for the new part.
In Carson City, we have an engineering
company that builds pistons and rods for
NASCAR. I have talked cars with the
owner and many others in Nevada. I
can tell you, if this company sold a part
that was changed in any way and did not
change the model number, it would cause
significant problems for these racing
teams.
I can also tell you based on my
experience that it is incredibly unusual
for a car company to change a car part and
not change the model number.
Government investigators have now
requested that GM provide any documents
chronicling the switch change and who
within the company provided it.
I also am requesting today, that GM
provide this committee with that
information.
But that is only part of this issue. We
also need to recognize that when GM emerged
from bankruptcy in 2009, the federal
government owned 60 percent of the company
because taxpayers bailed the company
out.
So GM knew of this issue in some
capacity over 10 years ago. They
changed a part and didnt tell
anyone. They asked for a taxpayer bailout
and the current administration had to step
in and restructure the company.
Through all of this, GM was unable to
determine that they should pull 2.2 million
vehicles off the road?
This is why, from where I am sitting, GM
has a lot of explaining to do both to this
committee and the taxpayer.
Here is the issue for GM. It looks like
there were multiple moments when the
company faced conflicts of interest, you
said it yourself yesterday. GM was a
culture based on cost not safety.
So, many people are wondering if GM did
not initiate a recall because GM could not
survive one in 2006 or they did not
initiate a recall because the government
owned 60 percent of the company.
It is possible that GM has an
explanation for why it took so long to pull
these cars off the road.
However, after yesterdays
hearing, I am afraid we are not going to
get many answers today.
I hope GM is in a position to speak to
what happened more specifically. That
is why we called you here and I think GM
should take the opportunity today to
explain their actions and help this
Committee get to the bottom of what
happened.
There is also another side to this
story, and that is whether the National
Highway Traffic and Safety Administration
received all the information from Early
Warning Report that it needed, to determine
if further investigation was warranted.
NHTSA received 260 complaints over 11
years that these vehicles were turning off
while being driven, yet NHTSA did not move
forward with a recall investigation in 2007
or 2010.
I wrote to NHTSA asking very simple
questions regarding their process in
recalling vehicles and what they saw in
2007 or 2010 that compelled them to pass on
an investigation.
I am very disappointed in NHTSAs
inability to respond to my letter in time
for this hearing. When we are looking
at incidents in which individuals died, I
expect more from NHTSA than what they
showed today and I think NHTSA knows they
can do better.
That being said, it is my understanding
that the Secretary of Transportation has
requested that the DOT IG conduct an audit
of NHTSAs handling of the GM
recall.
Secretary Foxx also states that he has
directed NHTSA and the DOT IG to jointly
conduct a due diligence
review. I am pleased by both
of these developments and look forward to
the reports.
We need to ensure that consumers are
safe on the road. We need to
understand the facts of this recall.
There are many questions that need
answering and I hope the hearing today
begins to provide some answers that the US
taxpayers deserve.
Thank you Chairman McCaskill.
