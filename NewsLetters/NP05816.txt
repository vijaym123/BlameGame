Friend -- I won&#39;t even bother sugarcoating it:
I need your help in the next 6 hours, or we could be in real trouble.
Either we raise enough before midnight&#39;s deadline to win the South and hold the Senate, or we risk falling behind in key battlegrounds.
You can&#39;t say &quot;I&#39;ll help out later.&quot; This is the FINAL quarterly deadline for our voter mobilization effort. There is no later.
Step up and pitch in to the Paint the South Blue Program before the quarterly deadline in 6 hours. We&rsquo;ll triple-match your gift.
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
I want to thank you right now.
We thought it was impossible, but you&#39;ve put us in reach of raising half a million dollars in one single day to keep the Senate blue.
That&#39;d shatter every previous record. But I can&#39;t tell you how crucial this deadline is.
We&#39;ve got to knock on doors, equip volunteers, and register voters, and this is our last chance to fund it all.
Let&#39;s send a clear message to the GOP.
Will you pitch in to the Paint the South Blue Program? Remember: Until the final quarterly deadline of this election at midnight, all gifts will be triple-matched.
Thank you,
Joe Biden
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
