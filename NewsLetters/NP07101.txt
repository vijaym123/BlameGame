Wicker Optimistic About Mississippi's
Future
Statewide Travels Showcase
Strong
Work Ethic, Community
Spirit
For more than four decades, Congress has set aside the
month of August for lawmakers to spend time in their home states with
their constituents. In addition to attending events in various parts
of the state, I utilize this summer work-period to travel across
Mississippi, meeting with the people I represent. I am excited about the
opportunity to spend time in at least 23 counties this
month.
Throughout our state, the message is clear:
Mississippi's future is bright. We are leading the way in advanced
health-care technologies, agricultural innovation, energy production, job
creation, workforce training, and national security tactics. Our
strong work ethic and community spirit have helped make the Magnolia State
a beacon of free enterprise, commerce, and
research.
Cutting-Edge Advancements in Health
Care
Our state's health-care providers are constantly finding
new and innovative ways to advance medical care and patient outreach.
For example, the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) is
conducting some of the most extensive research ever performed on
Alzheimer's by employing state-of-the-art
technologies.
At a recent roundtable discussion sponsored by the
Alzheimer's Association, I discussed ways in which research
facilities like UMMC could partner with the federal government to find more
effective treatments
and one day a cure
for the millions of Americans
and their families who suffer due to this terrible
disease.
Our state also faces the challenge
of providing medical care to vulnerable populations and medically
underserved areas. On August 15, I was pleased to attend the ribbon-cutting
of the state's newest community health center in Southaven. As a
long-time champion of community-based health centers, I believe citizens
in DeSoto County will benefit immensely from this new
facility.
Defending the
Homeland
On August 9, I was honored to welcome home to Gautier a true
American hero
U.S. Marine Sgt. Anthony McDaniel. This brave young man, who
has sacrificed so much for his country, is an inspiration to all who
meet him and hear his story. His strength and resolve are emblematic of
all those who volunteer to protect and preserve our great nation. As
a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I will
continue my work to ensure that our troops have both the resources they need
to do their job and the care they deserve when their mission has been
completed.
To that end, I am
fighting to protect the Mississippi National Guard's 155th Heavy Brigade
Combat Team. The 155th is integral to our nation's defense at home and
overseas. Unfortunately, the Obama Administration has proposed to
reduce the number of Heavy Brigade Combat Teams in an effort to
restructure the Army and cut personnel. Mississippi's Adjutant General Augustus
Collins has stated that this ill-advised move could set our Guard back
by 10 years. My number 1 priority in September is to push for
Congress to pass NDAA before the end of the fiscal year, which includes a
provision that I authored to block the Administration's
proposal.
A
Beacon of Free
Enterprise
Mississippi has repeatedly shown it is a great place to do
business. From international corporations like Rolls Royce and Monsanto to
small businesses like Mitchell Distributing in Meridian or Krumbs
bakery in Meadville, our state is experiencing an economic
resurgence.
To ensure that this growth
continues, we must equip Mississippians with the expertise to fulfill
the jobs of today and tomorrow. Our state's universities, community
colleges, and Job Corps centers are up to the task. Every year, they are
preparing thousands of Mississippians with the skills they need to
compete in today's global economy.
My
meetings with job creators, local leaders, and citizens from all
walks of life underscore for me the great potential for future growth in
our state. I look forward to working in the U.S. Senate to realize this
potential with policies that advocate lower taxes, fewer regulations,
and less Washington intrusion. We can all play a role in seeing that
Mississippi's dynamic economy continues to
flourish.
