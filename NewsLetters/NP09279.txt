Ensuring Equality for
Same-Sex Spouses
Dear Friend,
On May 20th, Pennsylvania became the 19th state in the nation and the
last Northeastern state to legalize same-sex marriage. The federal
court's ruling marked an historic and long-overdue victory for civil
rights in our state, almost one year after the U.S. Supreme Court
struck down the core of the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). But
we still have more work to do to ensure all loving, committed same-sex
spouses in Pennsylvania and across the nation receive the same federal
benefits and protections that apply to other married couples and their
families.
Today, same-sex spouses do not receive equal treatment under the Social
Security Act when applying for spouse-based Social Security benefits
they have earned. This is unfair and unacceptable. That is why I am
urging the federal government to extend Social Security marriage
benefits to all same-sex spouses, regardless of where they live.
Last week, I led 128 of my fellow U.S. Representatives in calling on
the Social Security Administration to stop withholding benefits from
same-sex couples. This includes same-sex couples in civil unions and
registered domestic partnerships, as well as married same-sex couples
living in states that do not recognize gay marriage. As a member of the
House Ways and Means Committee's Subcommittee on Social Security, I am
also an original cosponsor of the Social Security and Marriage Equality
(SAME) Act. The bill (H.R. 4664) ensures that all same-sex spouses
receive equal treatment when applying for Social Security benefits
regardless of what state they live in.
Action on the part of the Social Security Administration would not be
needed if Congress would pass the Respect for Marriage Act (H.R. 2523).
This legislation, which I cosponsored, repeals the portions of the
Defense of Marriage Act that the Supreme Court left intact and extends
Social Security spousal and survivor benefits to legally married
same-sex couples, no matter where they live.
Every American deserves equal treatment under our nation's laws,
regardless of their sexual orientation, where they live or where they
took their vows. I will keep working to ensure that all Americans are
protected by the same basic rights and are treated with the respect and
dignity they deserve.
Sincerely,
Allyson Y. Schwartz
Member of Congress

Ensuring
Equality
for
Same-Sex
Spouses
Dear
Friend,
On
May
20th,
Pennsylvania
became
the
19th
state
in
the
nation
and
the
last
Northeastern
state
to
legalize
same-sex
marriage.
The
federal
court&#8217;s
ruling
marked
an
historic
and
long-overdue
victory
for
civil
rights
in
our
state,
almost
one
year
after
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
struck
down
the
core
of
the
federal
Defense
of
Marriage
Act
(DOMA).
But
we
still
have
more
work
to
do
to
ensure
all
loving,
committed
same-sex
spouses
in
Pennsylvania
and
across
the
nation
receive
the
same
federal
benefits
and
protections
that
apply
to
other
married
couples
and
their
families.
Today,
same-sex
spouses
do
not
receive
equal
treatment
under
the
Social
Security
Act
when
applying
for
spouse-based
Social
Security
benefits
they
have
earned.
This
is
unfair
and
unacceptable.
That
is
why
I
am
urging
the
federal
government
to
extend
Social
Security
marriage
benefits
to
all
same-sex
spouses,
regardless
of
where
they
live.
Last
week,
I
led
128
of
my
fellow
U.S.
Representatives
in
calling
on
the
Social
Security
Administration
to
stop
withholding
benefits
from
same-sex
couples.
This
includes
same-sex
couples
in
civil
unions
and
registered
domestic
partnerships,
as
well
as
married
same-sex
couples
living
in
states
that
do
not
recognize
gay
marriage.
As
a
member
of
the
House
Ways
and
Means
Committee&#8217;s
Subcommittee
on
Social
Security,
I
am
also
an
original
cosponsor
of
the
Social
Security
and
Marriage
Equality
(SAME)
Act.
The
bill
(H.R.
4664)
ensures
that
all
same-sex
spouses
receive
equal
treatment
when
applying
for
Social
Security
benefits
regardless
of
what
state
they
live
in.
Action
on
the
part
of
the
Social
Security
Administration
would
not
be
needed
if
Congress
would
pass
the
Respect
for
Marriage
Act
(H.R.
2523).
This
legislation,
which
I
cosponsored,
repeals
the
portions
of
the
Defense
of
Marriage
Act
that
the
Supreme
Court
left
intact
and
extends
Social
Security
spousal
and
survivor
benefits
to
legally
married
same-sex
couples,
no
matter
where
they
live.
Every
American
deserves
equal
treatment
under
our
nation&#8217;s
laws,
regardless
of
their
sexual
orientation,
where
they
live
or
where
they
took
their
vows.
I
will
keep
working
to
ensure
that
all
Americans
are
protected
by
the
same
basic
rights
and
are
treated
with
the
respect
and
dignity
they
deserve.
