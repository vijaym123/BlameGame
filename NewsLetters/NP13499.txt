UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA - - - - -
December 20, 2013
Dear Friend:
Yesterday, the
Senate passed the annual
National Defense Authorization Act ,
which included my bipartisan amendment to help protect victims of sexual
assault from abusive treatment during pre-trial proceedings. To read my
statement on this important reform of Article 32 of the Uniform Code
of Military Justice, please click
here .
I am so pleased that victims of military sexual assault will no
longer have to endure vicious and invasive questioning during a
marathon pre-trial interrogation that has no parallel in the civilian world.
But make no mistake, until these vicious crimes are handled outside
the chain of command, we wont have truly fixed this broken system.
When the Senate returns next year, I look forward to proudly casting my
vote for the bipartisan
Military Justice Improvement Act
that
I introduced with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand to ensure that decisions
about whether to prosecute sexual assault cases are made by trained,
independent prosecutors
not commanders.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United
States Senator
