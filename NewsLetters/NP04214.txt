The 6th District
The Presidents Unilateral Immigration
Reform
Dear
Friends:
This week,
the President Obama continued a disturbing trend. Once again, he has
refused to work with the Legislative Branch of government, instead
announcing his plan to unilaterally grant protection from deportation for up
to 5 million individuals who are in the country
illegally.
The trend
of this White House to politicize immigration policy continues.
The President wants a partisan political wedge issue, not meaningful,
sensible, and compassionate immigration reform.
The President's
unilateral actions will only make it harder for Congress to
comprehensively fix all aspects of our broken immigration system, and the worst
part is that seems to be exactly his
intention.
I support a step-by-step
approach that starts with securing our borders.
I believe that
immigration reform must insure that we have enforceable immigration laws
that the President is committed to uphold, must help grow the economy
without putting any additional burdens on taxpayers, and lastly, should
keep families together.
Finally, I should note that as much as I disagree with the
Presidents unilateral actions, I do not believe that shutting down the
government is a viable option for expressing my opposition to what he
has done.
I will work with my colleagues to search for a more
appropriate option that will force this President to work within the
constitutional framework of the separation of powers that is at the very
heart of our system of representative
government.
Sincerely,
Mike
Coffman
U.S. Representative
