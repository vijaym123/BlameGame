A Message from Representative Sean Duffy
November 3, 2013
Dear friends,
As we "fall back" (one more reminder to change your clocks), I am very
much looking forward to taking a little extra time this week to
reconnect with my family, and with all of you. The government is doing
a lot of things these days that are having a pretty major impact on all
of our lives and I want to know how you feel about them. Please check
out the column on the right for information about a couple places where
you can find me. But before we get to this week, first, a quick round
up of the week that was.
If you like your healthcare, you probably can't keep it: The Obama
Administration continues to wave-off the claim that millions of
Americans will be forced to change their healthcare plan because of
Obamacare. This, even after The Washington Post gave the President's
now infamous line, "if you like your healthcare, you can keep it" four
"Pinocchio's
. I asked my Facebook
followers to #ShareYourStory. I heard from dozens of people about
cancellation notices, doctor changes, or concern for how they would
cover the higher premiums and deductibles. The healthcare system in our
country is not perfect, but the President's law is making it far worse,
not better.
For weeks my Republican colleagues and I have advocated for reasonable
alternatives that would help bring relief to millions of Americans,
namely to delay the individual mandate for a year. Several Democrats
are now also calling for the delay. I am glad they are listening to
their constituents, it is past due for the President to listen to his
constituents - the American people -as well and delay the mandate. Or,
move on from the law all together and work instead on reforms that will
actually work for the American people.
If it walks like a duck.it's a bailout: On October 1st, while most of
the country's attention was on the predictably disastrous rollout of
healthcare.gov, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) became the
recipient of the latest Washington bailout -- funded courtesy of
hardworking taxpayers -- to the tune of $1.7 billion. To be clear, FHA
has helped many people in the 7th District achieve the American dream
of home ownership. However, I have been concerned that this Agency has
not been forthcoming about their fiscal standing. Now we find out that
they are receiving this transfer of taxpayer dollars to cover their
shortfall with no plan for paying it back. Click on the image to watch
my exchange from this week's hearing:
Duty to defend religious freedom: Over the past year, I have become
increasingly concerned about reports of religious freedom abuses
throughout the Middle East, particularly in Egypt and Syria. The United
States was built on religious freedom and tolerance, and this must
continue to be a pillar of our foreign policy. I authored a letter
, which seventeen of my
colleagues signed, asking Secretary of State John Kerry, who made an
unannounced trip to Egypt this weekend, to designate Egypt and Syria as
Countries of Particular Concern for violations of religious freedom.
Additionally, I also made an appeal on the Floor of the House. Click on

As always, thanks for taking the time to read this update and for the
opportunity to represent you in Congress. I look forward to catching-up
with some of you this week during my visits around the district.
Have a great week,
Sean
