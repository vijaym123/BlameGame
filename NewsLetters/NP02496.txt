Boozman Bulletin: Stand With Israel
I&rsquo;m glad Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted the Speaker&rsquo;s invitation to address Congress and I was honored to be in the House chamber for it. He delivered a powerful, forceful speech. His message for us to stand together must be the priority for any negotiations to eliminate Iran's nuclear threat. There is no viable containment option.
As I mentioned during my speech on the Senate floor this week, the Obama Administration seems to be
moving the goalposts from the dismantling of Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program to containing it. That&rsquo;s not what the President told us these talks were going to accomplish. That&rsquo;s not what six UN resolutions intended to prevent. And that is certainly not something this Congress should allow to happen without our say. Nothing short of full elimination of Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program can honestly be considered a victory. If these talks fail to produce an agreement requiring that of Iran, Congress must have the authority to reject it.

With that in mind, you will be pleased to know that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has pledged to bring a bill up for consideration next week that would give Congress a role in approving any deal with Iran. I support this bill and will work with my colleagues to ensure its passage. The agreement currently being negotiated is too important to our national security for Congress to be pushed to the sidelines.
