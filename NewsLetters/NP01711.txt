Human trafficking and sex trafficking are terrible crimes that prey on
the most vulnerable among us. I have spent my time in in the U.S.
Senate trying to end it. The Senate Caucus to End Human Trafficking I
co-founded in 2012 meets monthly to learn from experts about the
problem and to come up with better ways the federal government can
help. Through the Caucus and through roundtable discussions back home
in Ohio, I have had the opportunity to meet with victims, community
activists, researchers, law enforcement, elected officials and others.
Their invaluable input helped shape a variety of bills I have
introduced in the Senate to address this growing problem. Two of my
bipartisan bills designed to give law enforcement, child-welfare
advocates, and community organizations the tools they need to protect
the most vulnerable people in our society and stop the spread of this
crime were incorporated into broader legislation to end trafficking I
am fighting to get signed into law this month.
One of my bills is regarding missing children, a group that is
particularly vulnerable to being trafficked. Missing children
investigations are often stymied by overlapping law enforcement
agencies that are not coordinated or are prevented from doing their
jobs by nonsensical regulations. The Bringing Missing Children Home Act
, which I coauthored with
Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY), refines and streamlines how cases of
missing children are handled.
It takes commonsense steps, including a requirement that law
enforcement agencies enter a photograph in the missing-persons
database, while removing roadblocks that prevent state missing-persons
units and law enforcement from updating their files. On the need for
photographs, here's a shocking statistic: over 80 young people have
gone missing in Ohio since January, and yet we only have photographs
for 22 of them. Missing children are far more vulnerable to
traffickers; by finding them quickly, we can prevent trafficking before
it starts.
While we seek to prevent trafficking, we must also do more to punish
those who take part in this horrible crime. That component is addressed
by the Combat Human Trafficking Act
that I coauthored with
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA).
Video of me talking about our efforts can be viewed here
.
We start by giving prosecutors expanded tools to put traffickers behind
bars. Our legislation enlarges the number of charges that federal
prosecutors can level against traffickers and those who conspire with
them. It also makes those who engage in trafficking strictly liable for
their crimes.
We also expand the training available to federal law enforcement
officers who are tasked with investigating and prosecuting traffickers.
We require the Bureau of Justice Statistics to prepare an annual report
that details our successes in this fight.
Just as important, our bill strengthens victims' rights by providing
more information to victims about prosecutions. It requires them to be
informed in a timely manner of any plea agreement or
deferred-prosecution agreement in cases in which they are involved.
Our goal is to end trafficking, but until we reach that goal, we must
do more to help victims. That is why I am pushing to add another one of
my bills to the legislation. The data portion of my Child Sex
Trafficking Data and Response Act
- meant to improve the
information that law enforcement officials have about the scope of the
trafficking problem - was signed into law last year. We are working
with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on its
implementation. The response portion of the bill has not been signed
into law yet, however. It changes the way we treat victims and will
strengthen this new legislation if incorporated. Children now are only
eligible for help through the child-welfare system if they are abused
by their parents. This legislation will ensure that all children who
are trafficked are considered victims of child abuse and can be
eligible for services as they recover.
For too long, we've treated human trafficking as if it is a problem in
other places, for other countries. But it is happening here, it is
happening now, and ignoring it won't make it go away. We now have the
opportunity to take a big step on the path to helping victims and
punishing traffickers.
Around the Senate & Buckeye State
I had the opportunity to visit with workers at Anomatic in Licking
County and learn about their exciting expansion plans - a testament to
their hard and innovative work.
I was honored to receive the Ohio Farm Bureau's "Friend of Farm Bureau
Award." Agriculture is Ohio's number one industry, contributing $105
billion to our economy each year, and I am proud to stand with Ohio's
farmers.
A few weeks ago, I was honored to be in Selma, Alabama to commemorate
the fiftieth anniversary of Bloody Sunday. I was joined by my friend
and civil rights icon, Congressman John Lewis, and other elected
leaders, as well as people young and old from every background, to
march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. It's a powerful symbol of the
civil rights movement, but even as we celebrate what we have overcome,
we must not forget how much further we have to go. Read more about why
I went to Selma here
.
It was good to meet with African-American community leaders at the
Historic Lincoln Theater in Columbus to discuss a number of legislative
initiatives.
Spoke to the Ohio Oil and Gas Association Annual Meeting in central
Ohio recently about the Federal Permitting Improvement Act
, bipartisan
legislation I introduced to streamline permitting rules and regulations
and add accountability to greenlight more building projects. The United
States has fallen to 41st in the world in "Dealing with Construction
Permits," according to a key World Bank metric measuring how easy it is
to actually build something. This is a bill that's about helping
workers, creating more opportunity, and improving wages, meaning not
only more jobs, but better jobs. I'm proud to have the support of both
the AFL-CIO North America's Building Trades Unions and the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce for this bill.
Honored to be presented with the Ohio Association for Career and
Technical Education's Policymaker of the Year Award at a recent Buckeye
Coffee. Glad to work with Ohio educators as co-chair of the Senate
Career and Technical Education Caucus.

Human
trafficking
and
sex
trafficking
are
terrible
crimes
that
prey
on
the
most
vulnerable
among
us.
I
have
spent
my
time
in
in
the
U.S.
Senate
trying
to
end
it. The
Senate
Caucus
to
End
Human

I
co-founded
in
2012
meets
monthly
to
learn
from
experts
about
the
problem
and
to
come
up
with
better
ways
the
federal
government
can
help.
Through
the
Caucus
and
through
roundtable
discussions
back
home
in
Ohio,
I
have
had
the
opportunity
to
meet
with
victims,
community
activists,
researchers,
law
enforcement,
elected
officials
and
others.
Their
invaluable
input
helped
shape
a

bills
I
have
introduced
in
the
Senate
to
address
this

were

I
am
fighting
to
get
signed

law
this
month.
One
of
my
bills
is
regarding
missing
children,
a
group
that
is
particularly
vulnerable
to
being
trafficked.
Missing
children
investigations
are
often
stymied
by
overlapping
law
enforcement
agencies
that
are
not
coordinated
or
are
prevented
from
doing
their
jobs
by
nonsensical
regulations.
The
Bringing
Missing
Children
Home
Act ,
which
I
coauthored
with
Sen.
Charles

(D-NY),
refines
and
streamlines
how
cases
of
missing
children
are
handled.

in
the

while

state

and
law
enforcement
from

On
the
need
for
photographs,
here's
a
shocking
statistic:
over
80
young
people
have
gone
missing
in
Ohio
since
January,
and
yet
we
only
have
photographs
for
22
of
them.
Missing
children
are
far
more
vulnerable
to
traffickers;
by
finding
them
quickly,
we
can
prevent
trafficking
before
it
starts.
While
we
seek
to
prevent
trafficking,
we
must
also
do
more
to
punish
those
who
take
part
in
this
horrible
crime.
That
component
is
addressed
by
the
Combat
Human
Trafficking
Act
that
I
coauthored
with
Sen.
Dianne
Feinstein
(D-CA).
Video
of
me
talking
about our
efforts can
be viewed
here .
We
start
by
giving
prosecutors
expanded
tools
to
put
traffickers
behind
bars.
Our
legislation
enlarges
the
number
of
charges
that
federal
prosecutors
can
level
against
traffickers
and
those
who
conspire
with
them.
It
also
makes
those
who
engage
in
trafficking
strictly
liable
for
their
crimes.
We
also
expand
the
training
available
to
federal
law
enforcement
officers
who
are
tasked
with
investigating
and
prosecuting
traffickers.
We
require
the
Bureau
of
Justice
Statistics
to
prepare
an
annual
report
that
details
our
successes
in
this
fight.
Just
as
important,
our
bill
strengthens
victims&#8217;
rights
by
providing
more
information
to
victims
about
prosecutions.
It
requires
them
to
be
informed
in
a
timely
manner
of
any
plea
agreement
or
deferred-prosecution
agreement
in
cases
in
which
they
are
involved.
Our
goal
is
to
end
trafficking,
but
until
we
reach
that
goal,
we
must
do
more
to
help
victims.
That
is
why
I
am
pushing
to
add
another
one
of
my
bills
to
the
legislation.
The
data
portion
of
my
Child
Sex
Trafficking
Data
and
Response
Act
&#8212;
meant
to
improve
the
information
that
law
enforcement
officials
have
about
the
scope
of
the
trafficking
problem
&#8212;
was
signed
into
law
last
year.
We
are
working
with
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
on
its
implementation.
The
response
portion
of
the
bill
has
not
been
signed
into
law
yet,
however.
It
changes
the
way
we
treat
victims
and
will
strengthen
this
new
legislation
if
incorporated.
Children
now
are
only
eligible
for
help
through
the
child-welfare
system
if
they
are
abused
by
their
parents.
This
legislation
will
ensure
that
all
children
who
are
trafficked
are
considered
victims
of
child
abuse
and
can
be
eligible
for
services
as
they
recover.
For
too
long,
we&#8217;ve
treated
human
trafficking
as
if
it
is
a
problem
in
other
places,
for
other
countries.
But
it
is
happening
here,
it
is
happening
now,
and
ignoring
it
won&#8217;t
make
it
go
away.
We
now
have
the
opportunity
to
take
a
big
step
on
the
path
to
helping
victims
and
punishing
traffickers.
