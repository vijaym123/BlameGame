The 6th District
A Bad Agreement with
Iran
Dear
Friends:
This week, while speaking on the
recently negotiated six-month nuclear deal with Iran, the Iranian Foreign
Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, told CNN reporters his country did not
agree to dismantle anything."
Zarif later clarified that Iran is
not dismantling any centrifuges, we're not dismantling any
equipment.
I find these statements unacceptable and a glaring example of
why many in Congress are weary of the Obama Administrations recent
negotiations with this dangerous and unstable regime.
As a staunch supporter of
strong sanctions imposed upon the radical Islamic regime in Iran, I
continue to have reservations regarding this ill-advised agreement.
I do not believe it goes far enough in dismantling this rogue nations
ability to produce a nuclear weapon, an ability which continues to
threaten the West and our allies in the
region.
I, as well as many of my colleagues
in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, am convinced
tougher sanctions are needed and should be imposed in order to effectively
bring about change in Iran.
This feeling is evidenced by the
growing support for Senator Robert Menendezs (D-NJ) sanctions bill,
which is up to 58 cosponsors in the Senate
This recent deal has asked Iran to
freeze their pursuit in obtaining weapons grade plutonium.
As an
exchange for this act of goodwill, the White House is willing to lift
current economic sanctions prematurely.
I, for one, am not buying
it.
Too often the inflammatory language by
Ayatollah Khamenei,
who recently referred to Israel as
the sinister, unclean
rabid dog of the region, has threatened one of Americas strongest
allies in the region.
I believe the United States should not settle for
anything less than the complete dismantling of Irans nuclear enrichment
program.
It is only after this is verified by international
inspectors that I believe the United States should consider lifting
sanctions.
Sincerely,
Mike Coffman
U.S. Representative

No Labels and More Than
65 Members of Congress Agree: Our Country Needs a National Strategic
Agenda
By Ashley Olson
Marketwired.com
Published January 23,
2014
WASHINGTON, DC --
Starting immediately, No Labels is launching a three-year
campaign to create a national strategic agenda for America. This effort
starts with the momentum of more than 65 members of Congress publicly
committing to the concept (a complete list of members can be found
below).
We have heard our political leaders talk about
bringing the country together by being "uniters, not dividers" -- but they
have never told us
how
to do that. No Labels
has a formula for
how : Build a national
strategic agenda. Bring both sides to the table, get agreement around goals
and then move on to debates, negotiations and
policymaking.
This is a practical approach with widespread support. No Labels'
Honorary Co-Chairs Gov. Jon Huntsman and Sen. Joe Manchin recently joined
experts from across the political spectrum to lay out the argument for
a national strategic agenda in an e-book,
No Labels: A Shared Vision for a Stronger
America .
The American people are demanding this new approach. In a
No Labels poll late last year:
80 percent said there should be one set of shared
goals across party lines, regardless of who is
president
87 percent said a
national agenda will be very important to their vote in the next
presidential election
97 percent said it's important our next president
is a problem solver
During the 1990s,
President Bill Clinton and Speaker Newt Gingrich didn't agree on much. But
they both eventually agreed to the goal of balancing the federal
budget. With that shared goal, they then just had to figure out how to
achieve it -- and they did.
In the months ahead, No Labels
will start building consensus around common goals with the members of
Congress who have joined this effort. This is the
critical first step toward creating a national strategic agenda. Right now,
while much of Washington is at a standstill, these leaders --
Republicans and Democrats -- will be working together to find shared goals for
our country.
Leaders Supporting a New Governing Vision
:
This group of more than 65 members of Congress, including
Representative Mike Coffman (R-CO) , support No Labels'
effort to create a national strategic agenda. Many of these members
will be wearing orange No Labels lapel pins at the upcoming State of
Union on January 28.
For a complete listing of members, please
click on the link above.
No Labels is a grassroots
movement of Democrats and Republicans dedicated to a new politics of
problem solving. The organization has already attracted more than half a
million citizens across the country, as well as members of Congress who
meet regularly in the only forum for problem solving on Capitol
Hill.
