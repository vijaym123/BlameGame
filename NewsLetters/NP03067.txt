Friends,
On Thursday, the Republican-controlled Senate passed the
KeystoneXL Pipeline, putting this energy jobs bill in a 4th and goal
situation.
The Pipeline is merely (legislative) steps away from a
touchdown, which would be a huge win for our country and bipartisanship.
All the bill needs is a signature from President Obama and the
odds are up-in-the-air.
I sincerely hope the President approves
the KeystoneXL Pipeline and gives American workers and our economy
this much-needed win.
Stay tuned
Can we grab
coffee?
This month, I am hosting five Coffees with
Your Congressman events throughout our district.
I hope you can
join me at one of the events to discuss issues impacting our community
and country.
Together, we can work on ways to create more jobs,
grow our economy, and protect our freedoms.
On February 9, I
will be in Bennettsville and Darlington, on February 16, I will be in
Marion and Johnsonville, and on February 17, I will be in Andrews.

GDP
Disappointing but Not Surprising
On Tuesday, the
House Budget Committee held a hearing to examine the Congressional Budget
Offices (CBO) Budget and Economic Outlook.
The CBO is charged
with producing nonpartisan budget analysis for Congress. Throughout the
year we examine CBO's latest numbers to review the countrys economy,
gross domestic product (GDP) and budgetary constraints.
The CBO
Director Doug Elmendorf testified that our economy is starting to
improve, but our projected GDP is not recovering at the same rate.
While this is disappointing news, it certainly is not surprising.
Watch the video
below to hear my
exchange with Director Elmendorf about why we are not seeing long-term
economic recovery.

Tomorrow Morning
The President
is scheduled to send his budget request to Congress tomorrow.
From what we have heard about his request, this budget will include new
taxes and more government spending.
One of the first bills I
cosponsored in Congress was a balanced budget amendment because I believe
the federal government should be
required
to operate on a
budget that balances.
American families budget their money, why
should the federal government be any different?
I will join
C-SPAN's Washington Journal
tomorrow
morning at 8:30AM ET
to discuss the President's budget request
and the budget process.
The show accepts viewer calls, Facebook
posts, and tweets.
I will post the call-in numbers on my
Facebook page
tomorrow morning
and would love to hear from you LIVE on the
show!
1,600+ Jobs
I would like to applaud the North
Eastern Strategic Alliance (NESA) on their outstanding third-annual
review.
In 2014, NESA assisted in creating more than 1,600 jobs
in our district and recruited more than $350 million in new capital
investment for our districts economy.
An economic investment like
this makes a huge impact on our job market and encourages businesses
to invest in our community.
For example, one day after NESAs
third-annual review, ARAUCO announced its plan to invest $30 million in
their Marlboro particleboard facility.
This will give Marlboros
economy a significant boost. Thank you to NESA for all of their hard
work and ARAUCO for their commitment to our Palmetto State
workforce!
Middle Market Growth
Caucus
Mid-sized businesses are a key driving force behind the U.S. economy,
making critical national, state and local economic contributions. The
middle market employs more than 44 million workers and generates $10
trillion in revenue annually. [In our district alone, Middle Market
companies employ 58,451 people and generate $9.5 billion in revenue.
I
am honored to co-chair this bipartisan caucus again this year with my
colleagues Steve Stivers (R-OH), Jared Polis (D-CO), and Kyrsten
Sinema (D-AZ). Together, we held a staff briefing on Tax and Trade Policy
in the 114th Congress." You can read more about the middle market

SCAM Alert!
HTC has issued a pop-up scam alert warning to
its HTC internet customers. The fake pop-up screen is disguised as a
warning screen that notifies customers of a security breach. When
customers call the toll-free number listed on the pop-up screen, someone
answers the phone posing as Microsoft support personnel. This is a scam
and HTC has advised customers to not give any of their personal
information over the phone. Here is a picture of the pop-up window, provided
by WMBF News.
It is an honor to represent you and your
family.
Have a good week (and may the best
team win tonight!),
