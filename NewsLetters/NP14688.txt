Dear
Friends,
I had the privilege of emceeing the Rally for
American Energy Jobs on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol Tuesday,
where I joined thousands of miners and their families in calling on the
Obama administration to support American energy independence and
American energy jobs.
Coal creates, coal powers, coal is America
but our coal mines are threatened. More than 100 mines in the state
of West Virginia have been closed. 3,500 miners have been laid off or
furloughed. Make no mistake
this is a war on coal. This is a war on
American jobs.
As the co-chairman of the Congressional Coal
Caucus, I have introduced a bill, the Ensure Affordable and Reliable
American Energy Act (H.R. 3140), to make America more competitive and
lower energy costs.
Our coal is good enough for China; its
good enough for India; its good enough for Germany. Why cant we
burn it here in America? Because the administration says no: No to
American energy, no to American energy jobs, and no to affordable American
energy. I, for one, want to keep American energy in America. Its time
for the administration to listen.

KEEP YOUR
HEALTH PLAN
ACT
"If you like your doctor, you will be able
to keep your doctor, period. If you like your healthcare plan, youll
be able to keep your healthcare plan, period. No one will take it away,
no matter what.
That's what President Obama promised
back in 2009, but in 2014, millions of Americans are slated to lose
their existing healthcare plans under Obamacare.
That's why
I signed on this week as a cosponsor of H.R. 3350, the Keep Your
Health Plan Act.
This bill would allow any health insurance plan
offered on the individual market in 2013 to be offered again in
2014.
It also would declare that any person who purchases an
individual market plan in 2014 that was offered in 2013 would satisfy the
individual mandate and would not be subject to a
penalty.
