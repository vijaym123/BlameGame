Dear Friend,
We live in an era where there is an
option to receive virtually every bill
notice, whether it is a credit card bill or
a utility bill, in your email inbox. Not
only does an email option dramatically
reduce costs for an organization, paperless
is a growing preference. Why, then, does
the federal government not take advantage
of sending paperless bills? A constituent
from North Canton asked me that very
question and expressed concern about
wasteful federal spending, and today I
introduced commonsense legislation to fix
it.
At this time, Medicare beneficiaries
receive quarterly notices in the mail for
their Medicare Part A and Part B-covered
services. The paper notice details all of
the services or supplies that providers and
suppliers billed to Medicare during the
3-month period, what Medicare paid, and the
maximum amount the beneficiary may owe the
provider.
The Better Efficiency and Administrative
Simplification Act will give the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
the authority to allow beneficiaries to
receive their Medicare Summary Notices more
frequently and to expand the email option
to other beneficiary documents. Increasing
the frequency of these notices is
significant because the beneficiary is
typically the first line of defense against
fraudulent billing practices. The sooner
beneficiaries can report incorrect billing,
the sooner the government can stop the
payments from going out.
In addition, this bill gives CMS the
ability to increase the length of contracts
for Medicare Administrative Contractors
(MAC). Increasing the duration of these
contracts will help CMS improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of the MACs.
MACs are an important tool in combating
waste, fraud and abuse; however, Congress
must give CMS the appropriate flexibility
it needs to manage its procurement and
contracting processes.
During a recent Ways &amp; Means
Committee hearing, the Office of Inspector
General stated that $50 billion is lost to
improper payments each year. The Office of
Inspector General has also documented
evidence that Medicare has paid for
services to those who are deceased, in
prison, and not entitled to benefits. This
troubling information comes on the heels of
last years report that revealed
Medicare will reach insolvency by 2026.
Congress must act now to strengthen the
Medicare program and protect it for current
and future beneficiaries.Based on
preliminary data, this commonsense
legislation will save Medicare millions in
program funds each year.This
legislation is an important first step in
addressing the vitality of the Medicare
program and I hope that my friends on both
sides of the aisle will support it.
