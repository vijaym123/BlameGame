Dear Fellow Nevadan,
Most of the issues
that come before the Senate are complex, nuanced matters. Rarely are
we faced with simple issues. But today we have a very simple,
clear-cut issue before us. Its as straightforward a question as any could be.
The question is this: Do you support American workers? Or dont
you?
Under American law, workers have the right to unionize and
have their voices heard in the workplace. Through elections, workers
choose for themselves whether or not to form a union. Last year, the
National Labor Relations Board took important steps to modernize and
streamline union election procedures. The NLRBs rule changes are good
for workers and good for businesses. This fight isnt about businesses
versus workers. You would have to search long and hard to find a
business that opposes what the NLRB did. This is all rhetoric from
Republicans in the Senate.
The reforms pushed forward by the NLRB
allow employers and unions to file forms electronically. They also allow
communication with workers via email and cellphone. Dont those
reforms sound pretty reasonable? Yet today, in a vote on a Resolution of
Disapproval, Senate Republicans tried to roll back rule changes
instituted by the NLRB.
Republicans think they are striking a blow
against labor unions with votes like todays. But what Republicans
fail to comprehend is that by undermining labor, they are undermining
American families. American workers and their families have come to rely
on many of the benefits provided by collective bargaining: higher
wages, decent health care, and workplace safety. It is no surprise that
some of the most prosperous times in American history
namely the
middle-20th century
came about in an era of record union membership. Even
today, in my home state of Nevada, unions protect wages for casino
employees on the Vegas Strip, ensure safe working conditions for miners
in Elko, and provide quality health coverage to educators state-wide.
So lets be clear about whom Republicans are really attacking: the
middle class. Each time Republicans throw up a roadblock for workers to
organize, they are weakening the American middle class.
I
support American workers and their families. I support the middle class.
Senate Democrats support the middle class. We do not support this
Republican attack on unions. We will continue to vigorously fight any
attempt to weaken worker protections.
