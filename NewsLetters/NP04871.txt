Folks, I wish I wasn&rsquo;t e-mailing you for a third day in a row.
But I have to keep e-mailing, because there&rsquo;s four days left and every piece of data shows us neck and neck with Doug Ose.
So we can&rsquo;t let up. We have to dig in.
Tonight&rsquo;s our final ad buy deadline, and falling short is not an option
-- not when our race could go either way, and every dollar helps make sure voters know the truth about me before they head to the polls.
So please if you can, make a contribution before midnight and make sure we can finish strong.
If you&#39;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
I refuse to wake up on November 5th with a feeling of regret, wishing we&rsquo;d done more when we had the chance. And that means not missing a single deadline -- especially tonight.
If you&rsquo;re with me,
please chip in tonight.
Be well,
Ami
