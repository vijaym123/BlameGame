On Wednesday, the Administration
released data
showing that during the first month (October 1
November 2), only 26,794 individuals enrolled in the federal health exchange, while 79,391 enrolled in a state-run exchange.
Reports
show
that the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office
estimated
that 7 million people would enroll in plans during the open enrollment period between October 1 and March 31.
To date, the Administration has only met 1.5% of its goal.
Glitches and technical problems with the website have caused delays and difficulties in the enrollment process, but the low enrollment numbers may threaten the functionality of the exchanges as a whole, because the higher cost for insurance paid by young, healthy Americans is necessary to cover the lower cost for those that are sick or elderly.
In response, the President
announced
a temporary policy that will allow individuals to continue or re-enroll in coverage that was in effect on October 1, 2013, if the insurance company chooses to do so.
In reaction, insurance companies
raised concerns
about the negative impact that changing these rules could have on the stability of the market and premium costs.
The House will consider the Keep Your Health Plan Act,
H.R.3350 , which next year, will allow insurance companies to continue to offer for sale (not just continuance) policies that were in effect as of Jan. 1, 2013.
