Dear Friends,
I am expanding my Constituent Meeting Calendar to Saturday, February 28. These one-on-one appointments with me will be about 15 minutes in length. The topics to be discussed are up to you.
There are eight appointments available starting at 9:30 a.m. Due to the volume of likely responses, the requests will be randomly drawn until the eight time slots are filled.
Notification of whether a time slot is available will be made by email to those who make a request by February 25th.
Please sign up

Throughout this year I will also be holding traditional town halls and telephone town halls. Please register to receive information about these opportunities

I look forward to listening and learning from you!
All the best,
