Dear Friend,
With two town halls, open office hours, a variety of jobs tours, and
school visits, I was glad to meet with many of you this past month.
Back in Washington, D.C., we had a vote on extending the debt limit,
which I could not support without serious spending reforms, and this
coming month we expect to have further conversation about the federal
budget. There is much work to do to rein in federal spending and I know
we can find a responsible path forward.
As always, please do not hesitate to contact my office if we can be of
service, and be sure to sign up for my newsletter here
.
It is an honor to serve you in Congress.
Sincerely,
Updates from Washington, D.C.
My SNAP Verify Bill
My new SNAP Verify Act (H.R. 4006) seeks to protect the integrity of
the SNAP program and discourage abuse from those who seek to game the
system. I joined FOX & Friends to discuss this legislation, and you can
watch the video here
. Additionally, ABC15 did an investigation
into SNAP fraud in the East Valley and verified the need for my bill.
Watch the clip here
.
Mark-up on Venezuela Legislation
The situation is rapidly deteriorating in Venezuela. As Chairman of the
Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, we pushed forward legislation
concerning the human rights abuses in Venezuela. Click here
for more.
National Prayer Breakfast
Early this month, I had the honor to attend the National Prayer
Breakfast
. Faith leaders, members of the diplomatic
corps, and government officials all came together that morning to pray
and remember what is truly important in this world.
House Committee on Foreign Affairs Majority Staff Benghazi Report
As I've said before, I remain committed to uncovering the truth of what
happened in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012, which resulted in
the death of four brave Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens.
As part of ongoing efforts, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs
Majority Staff released a new report that sheds light on the attack,
the negligent level of security for the U.S. Embassy despite increasing
threat levels, and the systemic failures in the current State
Department Accountability Review Board process. Learn more here
.
Conservative Policy Summit - My Privacy Bill
Privacy rights are incredibly important to me. I spoke with civil
liberties advocates at the Heritage Foundation's Conservative Policy
Summit about the importance of defending our Fourth Amendment rights.
In this forum, we discussed how my bill, H.R. 1847, the Electronic
Privacy Communications Act, is an important step forward in securing
our right to privacy in the digital age. Click here

"Stop Government Abuse Week"
I voted for the following bills this week in a conference-wide effort
to reduce the size and scope of the federal government.

2014. Read more here

>From the Fifth District
Town Halls in Chandler and Gilbert
Because receiving feedback is so important to me, I hosted two open
town halls this month. The first one included special guest, Rep. Ron
DeSantis (FL-06), in which we discussed our efforts to make sure
Congress lives under the rules it passes. My second town hall was at
Mountain View High School in Mesa, where my own kids attended high
school. There were many great questions and comments. Be sure to sign
up
for my e-newsletter in order to be
notified about my next town hall.
Neighborhood Office Hours
My staff traveled to the Fountain of Life Christian Fellowship Church,
the Christ's Church of the Valley - East Valley, and the Gilbert Senior
Center for neighborhood office hours this month. They were able to take
your questions on issues with federal agencies. Sign up for my
e-newsletter
to be alerted about future opportunities.
Trade in Arizona
Trade is incredibly important to the economy of Arizona. My
chairmanship of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere gives me a
unique opportunity to work with government officials, foreign
countries, business leaders, and federal agencies to bring more
business to our great state. That is why I was honored to address the
Global Interdependence Center as the Keynote Speaker on the topic of
"Trade in the Americas", where I discussed the latest efforts in
Congress to make progress in trade and commerce with our neighbors.
Fremont Junior High Stem and Steam Class
I spent time with the students of the Fremont Junior High Stem and
Steam Class in Mesa and was highly impressed with their Innovation
Projects and sharp questions. As a member of the House Committee on
Education and the Workforce, I was glad to see the great work they are
doing in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)
education. Click here
to view photos from the event.
Red Mountain High School Government Class
The students at Red Mountain High School invited me to speak with their
government classes. One of the students asked "What can our generation
do for our government?" I suggested they volunteer for organizations
that help people. I am encouraged to know that they are part of the
rising generation and I will fight for their future. Click here

Service Academy Nominations from AZ-05
As the U.S. Representative for the 5th District of Arizona, I have the
most gratifying privilege and responsibility of nominating a limited
number of the finest young men and women in my district to the various
service academies. It is with great joy that I announce this year's
nominees. I wish them the best in their educational endeavors and thank
them for their desire to serve our country. Click here

Because

included
special

in
which we
discussed
our
efforts
to
make
sure
Congress
lives
under
the
rules

passes.
My
second
town
hall
was
at
Mountain
View
High
School
in
Mesa,
where
my
own
kids
attended
high
school.
There
were
many
great
questions
and
comments.

Trade
in
Arizona
Trade
is
incredibly
important
to
the
economy
of
Arizona.
My
chairmanship
of
the

the

gives
me
a

opportunity
to
work
with
government
officials,
foreign
countries,
business
leaders,
and
federal
agencies
to
bring
more
business
to
our
great
state.
That
is
why
I
was
honored
to
address
the
Global
Interdependence
Center
as
the
Keynote
Speaker
on
the
topic
of
&#8220;Trade

Class
The
students
at

invited
me
to
speak
with
their
government
classes.
One
of
the
students
asked
&#8220;What
can
our
generation
do
for
our
government?&#8221;
I
suggested
they
volunteer
for
organizations
that
help
people.
I
am
encouraged
to
know
that
they
are
part
of
the
rising
generation
