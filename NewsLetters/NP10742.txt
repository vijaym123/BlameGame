Dear Neighbors,
The situation in Ukraine is worsening. On Friday, Vladimir Putin
recalled the Russian ambassador to NATO, and Russia's military chief
warned that Russian troops could move further into Ukraine in just 12
hours. The world cannot sit idly by and allow another country to be
invaded.
Last week, the House passed the Ukraine Support Act (H.R. 4278),
legislation that includes economic and visa sanctions against Russia as
well as support measures for Ukraine. This bill is an important,
necessary step to stop Russia's aggression in the area. This bill also
included language to encourage the U.S. to explore ways to assist
Central and Eastern European countries to diversify their energy
sources and achieve energy security. I've repeatedly urged the U.S.
government to do just that by expediting approval of permits for
natural gas exports. Exporting natural gas will not only tip the
balance of power in Eastern Europe, but it will also boost our own
economy here at home.

FOX News National Security Analyst KT McFarland.
Russia's latest actions also include violating the Intermediate Nuclear
Forces (INF) Treaty, signed under President Reagan in 1987. This has
received little talk in the press, but is a serious concern. What good
is a nuclear treaty if not all sides abide by it? In 2009, when talking
about the INF Treaty, President Obama stated, "Rules must be binding.
Violations must be punished. Words mean something." I agree; that's why
I introduced legislation with two of my colleagues to draw attention to
these violations and to call upon the President to take appropriate
action under the treaty.

combat human trafficking
Lastly, next Wednesday, April 16, I will hold the Second Annual Honor
Our Heroes. I hope you will join me and our neighbors in a community
tribute to thank our veterans and active service-members. Please be
sure to RSVP beforehand!
