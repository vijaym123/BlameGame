Dear Fellow Nevadan,
Today is National Equal Pay Day, a day
that symbolizes how far into 2015 American women must work to earn
what their male counterparts earned in 2014. This pay disparity between
men and women doing the same work is known as the wage gap. And make
no mistake about it, Republicans in Congress absolutely own the wage
gap. Their names all are over it.
Republicans' refusal to
address income disparities makes them responsible for the additional 3
months and 14 days that American women work to earn what their male
colleagues earn in just one year. Who are these working American women
being forced to work for months just to catch up on wages? They are our
wives, our daughters, our granddaughters and our neighbors.
Republicans repeated filibusters of equal pay legislation makes them responsible
for working women in our families having to take home 78 cents for
every dollar their male counterparts earn.
Democrats have
tried repeatedly to pass Senator Barbara Mikulskis Paycheck Fairness
Act. This legislation provides working American women with the tools they
need to close the wage gap. Yet time and time again, Republicans have
stonewalled this most basic issue of fairness. Five years ago,
Republicans filibustered the Paycheck Fairness Act. Two years later,
Republicans did the same thing. Last year, Republicans blocked the bill
twice. Just last month during the budget debate, Senator Mikulski again
gave Republicans another chance. Once again, Republicans blocked
it.
Five times in five years, Republicans have blocked equal pay
for women. Five times in five years Republicans have told their very own
sisters, daughters, granddaughters and wives that theyre not
interested in fixing this unfair income disparity. That is why I say,
Republicans own the wage gap.
So today, as we recognize Equal Pay
Day, I hope my Republican colleagues will come to their senses and
address this injustice that hurts millions of American families. American
women deserve equal pay for equal work. My daughter deserves equal
pay for equal work.
