Friends,
The
Administration has generated a lot of concern over the past few days and I
will address these actions later in this newsletter, but
first
I want to highlight some great news in our
district.
This week there have been a handful of job announcements in
our area,
totaling 323 new jobs!
To close out the
week, the South Carolina Department of Employment and Workforce announced
Friday that our states labor force hit an all-time high.
These
announcements are great news for our community and we must keep the
momentum going. This will require cooperation from all levels of
government, community leaders and business
groups.
We are fortunate to live in a state and district that recognizes the
importance of collaboration and actively recruits new economic partners.
For example,
South Carolinas
apprenticeship program , our Department of Economic
Development, and economic development groups have all helped us
attract household names like
Wyman-Gordon
to the Pee
Dee, BMW to the Upstate, Boeing to the Lowcountry, and recently Nestle
to Marion County.
In order to expound on this
success,
I joined my colleagues last week in passing legislation
that makes it easier for new U.S. factories to receive permits
and ultimately, create new manufacturing jobs.
The Promoting New
Manufacturing Act,
H.R. 4795 , will also increase
transparency within the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) so
Congress can hold the agency accountable should it attempt to stall
manufacturing permits and industry growth.
This bill now awaits
consideration in the Senate.
SC Utilities Issue Scam
Warning
According to WPDE, four utility companies
say customers across the state, and the country, have contacted them
about a phone scam.
The scam involves a call to the customer
telling them that they are late on their utility bill or might need a new
meter.
The caller warns customers their electric service will be
cut off if they do not pay their bill immediately.

Roadmap to Prosperity:
A Plan to Make America
Competitive
If we want to expand the Palmetto States
success and see real economic growth nationwide, we must get our country
competitive again.
I have introduced legislation that outlines a
plana new kind of contract with Americathat will make America
Competitive.
On Tuesday, I presented this plan on Floor of the House of
Representatives and encouraged my colleagues, both Democratic and
Republican, to join me in this effort.

Protecting
the Constitution &amp; the Rule of
Law
Recognizing President Obama's pattern of disregard for the Constitution, I
have previously taken steps to stop the President from abusing his
power.
Through an unconstitutional change to our nation's
immigration laws, President Obama has ignored the
Constitutionally-mandated separation of powers again.
He claims he was forced
to use executive action to change our immigration laws because Congress
would not act, but this is nonsense.
The President and his
party had control of the White House, Senate, and House of Representatives
two years ago and could have reformed our countrys immigration laws
legally .
Instead of deepening the
dysfunction of a broken immigration system, I implore President Obama to
reconsider his course, and learn to work with Congress.
In the
meantime,
I will do everything I can to protect the Constitution and
our nations rule of law.
On Friday, the House of
Representatives filed a lawsuit against the President and his
administration for
illegally paying insurance companies billions of
(taxpayer) dollars
and unilaterally changing the
President's health care law.
This lawsuit stems from the lawsuit I
introduced, the Stop This Overreaching Presidency (STOP) Resolution and the
Lawsuit Resolution the House of Representatives authorized in
July.
