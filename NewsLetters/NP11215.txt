Dear Neighbor,
March 17 th -21 st
is
NO MORE Week , an opportunity to stand up and end sexual assault and domestic violence. This is something very personal to me and my family. Over the last year, my family experienced firsthand the issue of sexual assault. That event impacted a beautiful young life and our family in a way that I cannot express
I
spoke on the House floor
about the need to change the culture in our country and empower women and men to know how to respond in sexual assault and domestic violence situations. Please join me during NO MORE week to show your support for ending sexual assault by being a part of the conversation.
Join the conversation on our Facebook page
but don&rsquo;t let it stop there &ndash; talk about it openly in classrooms, in offices and at the kitchen table.
REED: EXECUTIVE OVERREACH HIGHLIGHTS NEED TO RESTORE FAIR BALANCE OF POWER
We&rsquo;re
hearing from constituents
understandably concerned with the President&rsquo;s trend of unilaterally changing laws and failing to enforce ones he disagrees with. We responded in the House with two bills to keep the White House in check and to protect our Constitution: the
ENFORCE the Law Act
and the
Faithful Execution of the Law Act . No President &ndash; Democrat or Republican &ndash; is above the law.
VIDEO: REED BRINGS DISTRICT RURAL HOSPITAL CONCERNS BEFORE SECRETARY SEBELIUS
Our rural hospitals are taking serious hits as a result of ongoing cuts from Obamacare. The Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rate cuts the White House is imposing are preventing access to care. It&rsquo;s important Secretary Sebelius
hears our rural hospital concerns
and knows the policies the White House supports is putting rural hospitals at risk.
