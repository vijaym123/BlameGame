Update on the VA | New EPA regulations
An update on the Veterans Administration...
Recent information regarding actions taken by VA hospitals across the
country has brought to light disturbing evidence about the care our
veterans are receiving. Secret waitlists, data manipulation, and other
intentionally negligent behavior from senior VA officials cannot be
tolerated.
We know that funding is not the issue
and we also know that the
President's Administration was aware
of the negligent care at
various facilities.
That is why after an inspector general report was released confirming
that this problem was not isolated to Phoenix and instead a systemic
failure, I called on VA Secretary Shinseki to resign
his
post immediately.
In the House, we have passed legislation
that will help bring accountability for these deplorable actions and
ensure these issues are not repeated moving forward. But we can't stop
there.
Changes need to be made to ensure that veterans receive the care they
were promised and that they deserve.
I support measures that expand access for veterans outside
of the traditional VA
facilities so that they can see the doctor or visit the hospital of
their choice if they are limited by proximity or waitlists. This is
something I believe should be covered under their VA benefits.
I have supported this common-sense idea since I served as a medical
resident at the Milwaukee VA. I trained there for over 2.5 years along
side many dedicated Americans who every day serve their country and
care for the well-being of our veterans.
We owe it to our veterans and the dedicated VA employees to solve the
challenges.
New EPA regulations will hurt Hoosier families and businesses...
As a physician and father of four, I want my kids and all Americans to
drink clean water and breathe clean air. This should be a goal we all
share.
In fact, since 2008, emissions have declined over 9%.
Unfortunately, what we've seen over the past few years under President
Obama's EPA is a complete disregard of science and a focus on pushing a
purely ideological agenda at any expense.
Unfortunately, the EPA's recently announced set of rules on power
plants is yet another notch in the President's belt to achieve his 2008
promise that electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket for
hardworking Americans
. More than any other state, this promise
and new proposed rules have the potential to astronomically impact
Indiana, our economy, and those struggling everyday to make ends meet.
Every Hoosier coal mine is located in my district and 80 percent of our
state's energy is coal generated. A lot is at stake for our families.
My dad was coal miner. I know how important the coal industry is to our
families and businesses.
Studies have repeatedly shown that these proposals will have little
impact on the environment in exchange for increased energy prices for
families and businesses.
By increasing energy prices and putting jobs
at risk, these regulations erode our state's competitiveness.
In fact, Sunrise Coal in Sullivan County responded to the EPA's new
proposal with similar concerns.
And an Indiana newspaper wrote that, "these strict new
standards would clobber consumers with higher electric bills."
That is why I signed on as a cosponsor to a bill that will stop these
regulations
.
At a time when our economy is struggling, the President should be
focused on policies that will protect jobs and keep energy prices low,
instead of pushing an ideological agenda. I have been an outspoken
opponent of the EPA's crippling policies on our state's coal and
agriculture industries and will continue to do so as long as I am in
Congress.

An

New
EPA
regulations
will
hurt
Hoosier
families
and
businesses...
As
a
physician
and
father
of
four,
I
want
my
kids
and
all
Americans
to
drink
clean
water
and
breathe
clean
air.
This
should
be
a
goal
we
all
share.
In
fact,
since
2008,
emissions
have
declined
over
9%.
Unfortunately,
what
we've
seen
over
the
past
few
years
under
President
Obama's
EPA
is
a
complete
disregard
of
science
and
a
focus
on
pushing
a
purely
ideological
agenda
at
any
expense.
Unfortunately,
the
EPA's
recently
announced
set
of
rules
on
power
plants is
yet
another
notch
in
the
President's
belt
to
achieve
his
2008
promise
that
electricity
rates
would
necessarily
skyrocket
for
hardworking
Americans .
More
than
any
other
state,
this
promise
and
new
proposed
rules
have
the
potential
to
astronomically
impact
Indiana,
our
economy,
and
those
struggling
everyday
to
make
ends
meet.
Every
Hoosier
coal
mine
is
located
in
my
district
and
80
percent
of
our
state's
energy
is
coal
generated.
A
lot
is
at
stake
for
our
families.
My
dad
was
coal
miner.
I
know
how
important
the
coal
industry
is
to
our
families
and
businesses.
Studies
have
repeatedly
shown
that
these
proposals
will
have
little
impact
on
the
environment
in
exchange
for
increased
energy
prices
for
families
and
businesses.
By
increasing
energy
prices
and
putting
jobs
at
risk,
these
regulations
erode
our
state's
competitiveness.
In
fact,
Sunrise
Coal
in
Sullivan
County
responded
to
the
EPA's
new
proposal
with
similar
concerns.
And
an
Indiana
newspaper
wrote
that,
"these
strict
new
standards
would
clobber
consumers
with
higher
electric
bills."
That
is
why
I
signed
on
as
a
cosponsor
to
a

that
will
stop
these
regulations .
At
a
time
when
our
economy
is
struggling,
the
President
should
be
focused
on
policies
that
will
protect
jobs
and
keep
energy
prices
low,
instead
of
pushing
an
ideological
agenda.
I
have
been
an
outspoken
opponent
of
the
EPA's
crippling
policies
on
our
state's
coal
and
agriculture
industries
and
will
continue
to
do
so
as
long
as
I
am
in
Congress.
