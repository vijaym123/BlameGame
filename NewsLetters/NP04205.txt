Build Keystone
Now
Last Friday, the House voted to
build the Keystone Pipeline.
Unfortunately, this proposal was
rejected by the Democrat-controlled Senate on Tuesday.
Incoming
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has promised that the incoming
Senate will vote to build the Keystone Pipeline.
I will continue
to support Keystone and the thousands of jobs it will
bring.
Opposing Executive
Amnesty
The President
announced yesterday that he will grant executive amnesty for up to five
million illegal immigrants.
The President is exceeding his
Congressional authority and offending generations of immigrants who
followed the law to earn their legal status.
I will continue to oppose
amnesty and push to secure our
borders.
Stopping EPA Overreach
I am pleased that Senator Landrieu and other Democrat
Senators
finally joined me
to tell the President
and the EPA to support Louisiana energy workers.
Their
action came months after Senator Vitter and I urged the EPA to protect
Louisiana energy jobs.
I will continue to advocate for those
jobs.
