View From the Middle East: Increasing Instability and
Violence
At this writing, I am returning to the United States
after joining House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and a delegation of
senior committee leaders on a fact-finding trip to key Middle East
nations.
Among other stops, we visited Riyadh, Baghdad, Amman and Tel
Aviv.
Our talks focused on our combined efforts to address the
threats posed by ISIL and Irans rising influence in the
region.
Looking at the increasing instability and violence in the
region, we also discussed the critical need for an overarching
strategy to defeat the rising terrorist threat.
Most important, we
agreed the United States must show strong
leadership!
Helping Egypt Fight Terror Groups
A week after
receiving a letter from members of the official Congressional delegation I
led to Egypt last month, President Obama released military assistance
aid to Egypt that was suspended after the ouster of Islamist
President Mohamed Morsi in July 2013.
President Obama called Egyptian
President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi on Tuesday to tell him the U.S. would
finally be sending 12 F-16 fighter jets, 20 missiles and up to 125 Abrams
tank kits.
Our letter, sent last week,
read:
Mr. President, we certainly understand your wish for Egypt to move
towards a true democracy and we share your desire to encourage
constructive behavior.
However, in this case, we believe that our
nation provides unrestricted assistance to many nations that are far less
of a strategic partner than Egypt. We fear that if these restrictions
remain in place and if these weapons systems are not delivered, Egypt
will be forced to look elsewhere for assistance and will form
relationships with partner nations that may be worrisome to our national
security interests in the region.
Beyond this argument, we
must never forget that Egypt is on "our team," fighting every day
against Islamist groups in Libya and Sinai.
They need this
counterterrorism assistance!
