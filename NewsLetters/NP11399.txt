Rep. Garrett stands with some members of his academy board, which
is comprised of former military officers and veterans from New Jersey
who help interview the candidates and select nominees.
Dear Friend,
Im proud to announce my nomination of 30 Fifth District high school students to United States service academies.
As you may know, acceptance into the Military Academy at West Point, the Naval Academy at Annapolis, the Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point and the Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs requires a nomination by a Congressman or Senator.
These storied academies have a rich history of producing some of our countrys greatest military leaders.
This years class of nominees is well-rounded, hardworking, academically gifted, physically fit and motivated by their selfless drive to serve a cause greater than themselves.
Please join me in wishing them all the best as they continue the application process.

Sincerely,
Scott Garrett
