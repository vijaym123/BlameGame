Rep. Cuellar Release Informational Video for Small Business Owners
Dear Friend,
Are you a small business owner?
Have you thought about applying for federal funding but find the process complicated and confusing?
Are you unaware of the federal resources that exist for small business owners?
If so, I encourage you to watch my latest informational video geared specifically toward small business owners.
Every month, I sit down with a special guest to bring home to you some of the most important issues from Washington.
This month, I invited officials the
Small Business Administration
and the
United States Department of Agriculture Rural Development
who explained some of the federal resources available for small business owners, especially those in rural areas.
You can watch the video
HERE
to hear directly about the options that are available to you.
Sincerely,
Henry Cuellar
P.S. Make sure you
