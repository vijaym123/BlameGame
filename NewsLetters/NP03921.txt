Recently in Washington
Last week the House passed H.R. 5771, the
Tax Increase Prevention Act , by a vote of 378-46.
Congressman Simpson was supportive of this bill, which extended a number of tax relief provisions that had expired over the last calendar year.
The House also passed H.R. 5759, the
Preventing Executive Overreach on Immigration Act , by a vote of 219-197-3.
This measure prohibits the President from deferring removal of immigrants with unlawful immigration status.
Simpson also supported this bill.
Congressman Simpson opposed passage of the
National Defense Authorization Act for FY2015 , which passed the House 300-119.
The bill authorizes funding for the Department of Defense and other national security agencies, authorizes funding for Overseas Contingency Operations, and extends the Obama Administrations authority to train and equip Syrian rebels fighting ISIS and the Assad regime.
Simpson Opposes Unilateral Action by President
Insists that Congress hold hearings, debate, and vote on long- term Middle East strategy
Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson last week opposed H.R. 3979, The National Defense Authorization Act because of the authority it extends to the Administration to train and equip the Syrian rebels.
There are many essential provisions included in H.R. 3979 that I support.
However, I opposed the bill because I cannot in good conscience vote to extend additional authority to the Obama administrations unilateral decision to train and equip Syrian rebel groups, said Simpson. A determination to continue to commit billions of dollars and countless other American resources to a new, and potentially years long conflict in the Middle East is too important for Congress to rubber stamp.
We need to hold hearings, have a debate and vote after we have a complete picture of what our long-term strategy will be in this conflict.
The actions we take now will have long lasting impacts on our national security, budget, and our economy, and I for one do not trust the President with making those decisions alone.
H.R. 3979 passed with a final vote of 300-119 and now moves to the Senate for consideration.
