Dear Friend,
With
Memorial Day approaching, I would like to extend my thanks to all the men
and women of our armed services, their families and their loved ones.
Memorial Day is a time for Americans to come together to thank our
dedicated soldiers scattered across the globe, the wounded warriors whose
lives have been forever changed by their experience of war and those
who did not return.
In my work on the Armed Services
Committee, I have made it a priority to support our servicemembers and their
families. One area on which I have focused since being elected has
been on ways we can support women servicemembers. For example, the
recently-passed House version of the annual defense bill included a
provision I authored that requires the Army to create a policy regarding
workplace breastfeeding for servicewomen, something I heard was a problem
firsthand from Army Moms.
Read more about it in
this weeks eNewsletter.
Another bill recently passed
by the House of Representatives was the Medicare Access and CHIP
Reauthorization Act, which also included language I authored.
The bill funds teaching health centers , something I
championed and worked across the aisle to ensure had appropriate support.
This bill also supported community health centers and restructured the
method by which doctors are reimbursed by Medicare so that seniors
wouldnt lose access to their doctors.
Also in this weeks
newsletter, read the
Lowell Suns Editorial
supporting
a bill I introduced,
Merrimack Valley Magazines
article about the Lawrence Partnership , and read about how my
office helped the
Greater Lawrence Family Health Center
receive a grant valued at nearly 3 million dollars .
As
always, I look forward to your feedback via my website, or on
Facebook
and
Twitter . Thank you for
staying engaged and enjoy this edition of
Congress in your
Inbox.
Sincerely,
Niki
Tsongas

Bloomberg: Is the U.S.
Military Ready to Accommodate Breastfeeding
Soldiers?
By Emily Greenhouse - The Affordable Care Act requires American
employers to provide a reasonable break time for nursing mothers,
and a private place for mothers to pump (or express, as the
Department of Labor puts it) their breast milk. But in the military workplace,
the laws are different.

Sun Editorial:
Tsongas' SUPPORT should be accepted
U.S. Rep.
Niki Tsongas is once again shining the spotlight on a problem that for
decades was the military's dirty little secret: Sexual assault of
service members. This time, she is shedding light on the sexual assault and
rape of male service members, which experts and surveys suggest is
vastly underreported.

Merrimack Valley Magazine:
The Lawrence Partnership
Changing the
perception of a city once labeled the city of the damned is a daunting
task, to say the least. When Boston Magazine used those words in a
headline over a less than flattering 2012 story about Lawrence, a
metaphorical gauntlet was thrown. And the response has been impressive. Rather
than helplessly shrugging their shoulders, many people inspired by
this storied city chose instead to link arms and accept the challenge to
turn things around. READ FULL STORY
