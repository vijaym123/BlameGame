&ldquo;With PACs in Mass., get ready for high-priced attack ads&rdquo;

Dear Friend,
A recent article in the
Boston Globe
highlighted the growing power of super PACs in Massachusetts. Our campaign faced off against a super PAC last year, and it was your grassroots support that helped us triumph.
All across the country, super PAC money is changing the momentum of Senate races, and if a PAC with deep pockets decides to get into our race, we have to be ready to respond. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re aiming to raise $50,000 before the primary, so we can stand strong against anything the special interests might throw at us. Can you chip in $5 to help us reach our goal?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Democrats from coast to coast are under assault from well-funded super PACs. It forces us to fight on two fronts -- one against our actual opponents, one against their anonymous backers. It&rsquo;s a tough fight, but if we stay committed to grassroots organizing, we can win it. To win in November, we have to stay on track, and that means hitting our fundraising goals. Give $5, $10, or whatever amount makes sense to you and help us finish this campaign strong.
Thank you.
