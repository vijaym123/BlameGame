New
Report Estimates Obamacare Will Result in Fewer Hours
Worked
I wanted to make sure you were aware of a
recent report released by the non-partisan Congressional
Budget Office (CBO)
which estimates that, due to the
implementation of the new health care law, people will choose to work fewer hours
in order to keep government subsidies for health
insurance.
The report, which was released Tuesday,
estimates that the equivalent of about 2 to 2 and a half million
jobs-worth of work will be lost
partly because people will opt
to work fewer hours in exchange for keeping government subsidies to
buy health insurance.
The report goes on to say that because of
this, the tax base will be smaller resulting in less revenue for the
government, more spending, and higher deficits.
CBO Director Doug
Elmendorf testified that the new health care law acts as a
"disincentive" to work .
This is
the wrong message to be sending.
Government should not be
trapping hard-working Americans in certain incomes in order to keep their
health insurance.
This report shows that Obamacare will
unfortunately exacerbate the problem of the "poverty trap" that already exists
for lower-income families.
