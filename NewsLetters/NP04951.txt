Friend,
Wow. What an amazing experience.
I&#39;m honored and humbled by what President Clinton said today. It&#39;s good to know that he shares our vision of a strong middle class, and an economy that works for ALL Americans - not just the wealthy few.
I know you share that vision, too. With less than a week until Election Day, the momentum is on our side, and we need your help for our final push.
