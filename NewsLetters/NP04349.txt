Tonight, the president thumbed his nose at the American people and our system of democracy. The presidents brazen action is lawless, unconstitutional, and arrogant. Regardless of how one feels about the issues of amnesty and illegal immigration, all should be appalled by the presidents unilateral action
something he himself
said
last year would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally.
Regrettably, this is the latest in a continued pattern of disregard and indifference to our Constitution and the protections of our freedoms contained within that cherished document
namely our system of co-equal branches of government with separate powers.
Barack Obama was elected our president, not our king.
America is a nation of immigrants, and should continue to be.
We cannot take everyone, but I believe there is a place for those who want to come to America legally, roll up their sleeves to work hard, and be an economic asset to our nation.
Unfortunately, the presidents actions today not only create the underpinnings of a constitutional crisis, they potentially set the stage for another immigration crisis like we saw this past summer.
By taking this executive action, the president has done nothing more than double down on his existing failed policy and make our broken immigration system worse.
Yours respectfully,
Jeb Hensarling
