Congressman Lamborn Named To Exclusive Conference Committee to Work on
VA Healthcare Bills
6/18/14
Today, House Leadership
named Congressmen Doug Lamborn, Phil Roe, Bill Flores, Dan Benishek,
Mike Coffman, Brad Wenstrup, Congresswoman Jackie Walorski, and House
Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller as members of a
special House-Senate Conference to address the differences between House and
Senate VA reform legislation.
"Providing accountability and emergency access to private care
will make a real difference, but theyre no substitute for a long-term
plan from the president to address the VAs systemic problems.
Im confident our negotiators will usher these reforms to the
presidents desk while continuing our work to hold him
accountable."
- Speaker of the House John
Boehner
"It is an honor to be
named as a Conferee. My position as the second most senior
Republican on the House Veterans Affairs Committee was key to this appointment
and will allow me to leverage my experience and expertise for the
benefit of veterans. This conference committee will draft final
legislation to hold people accountable in the VA and provide veterans the timely
access to quality care they
need."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn (CO-05)
