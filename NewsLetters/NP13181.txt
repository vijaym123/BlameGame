News from Representative Richard Nugent
Dear Friends,
This wasn't a particularly busy week in Washington, but there was one
particular piece of legislation that I did want to make sure was on
your radar screen.
Here's the background. In August 2013, just two months before
Healthcare.gov was scheduled to launch, the Inspector General of the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released a report
highlighting "several critical tasks" which needed to be completed in a
very short period of time (before the site went live on Oct 1). One of
those "critical tasks" was "remediating security vulnerabilities
identified during testing".
Whether or not all of the vulnerabilities were remediated remains to be
seen. Regardless, as just about any cybersecurity expert will tell you,
breaches will always occur. It doesn't matter how secure or protected a
network is, hackers will always find a way in. The question is not
whether you can ensure 100% impenetrability; that's a fiction. The
question is how quickly and effectively you respond to those security
breaches and how well protected information is within the network prior
to the breach.
The government, by and large, isn't the best at this. We've heard
reports of widespread security weaknesses across a number of sensitive
government databases. One such potential breach is the subject of
something I am investigating personally right now.
The main point here is that Healthcare.gov and the various exchanges
operating under its umbrella will be breached. at some point. if they
haven't already. What we need to ensure is that the brightest people
and the most effective and up-to-date strategies are employed to
minimize or eliminate the damage of those inevitable attacks. With
millions of Americans being required to enter their Social Security
numbers and other personal information into those databases, criminal
hackers will be keen to break in. You can bet on that. And in the event
that such a break in occurs, we frankly believe that one of the first
steps that the government should take is to notify those individuals
whose private information may have been compromised.
For that reason, this week, the House passed a piece of legislation
requiring that HHS notify individuals within two business days of any
breach of a security system maintained by federal or state exchanges
that is known to have resulted in the theft of personally identifiable
information. Pretty simple.
Remarkably, 122 members of the House voted against the requirement -
all of them Democrats. I can certainly understand why some Democrats in
Congress are hyper-sensitive about criticism of the "Affordable Care
Act". I get it. I really do. But I think that given the widespread
network vulnerabilities across the government, and particularly the
vulnerabilities with these new problem-plagued and untested exchanges,
that you would want to do everything possible to ensure that people are
protected. It's not a knock on the healthcare law. It's just the
reality of the situation. This is simply a responsible step to take in
the event that the worst happens. That's why 67 Democrats did vote for
it.
In any case, that's where things stand. We've got some major
legislation coming in the next few weeks, funding bills, etc. At this
point, it's not entirely clear when we'll take up the individual
pieces, but definitely stay tuned over the next few weeks. And if there
is anything I can do in the meantime, please let me know.
Thanks again.
Sincerely,
Rich Nugent

Representative
Richard
Nugent
Dear
Friends,
This
wasn&#8217;t
a
particularly
busy
week
in
Washington,
but
there
was
one
particular
piece
of
legislation
that
I
did
want
to
make
sure
was
on
your
radar
screen.
Here&#8217;s
the
background&#8230;
In
August
2013,
just
two
months
before
Healthcare.gov
was
scheduled
to
launch,
the
Inspector
General
of
the
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
(HHS)
released
a
report
highlighting
&#8220;several
critical
tasks&#8221;
which
needed
to
be
completed
in
a
very
short
period
of
time
(before
the
site
went
live
on
Oct
1).
One
of
those
&#8220;critical
tasks&#8221;
was
&#8220;remediating
security
vulnerabilities
identified
during
testing&#8221;.
Whether
or
not
all
of
the
vulnerabilities
were
remediated
remains
to
be
seen.
Regardless,
as
just
about
any
cybersecurity
expert
will
tell
you,
breaches
will
always
occur.
It
doesn&#8217;t
matter
how
secure
or
protected
a
network
is,
hackers
will
always
find
a
way
in.
The
question
is
not
whether
you
can
ensure
100%
impenetrability;
that&#8217;s
a
fiction.
The
question
is
how
quickly
and
effectively
you
respond
to
those
security
breaches
and
how
well
protected
information
is
within
the
network
prior
to
the
breach.
The
government,
by
and
large,
isn&#8217;t
the
best
at
this.
We&#8217;ve
heard
reports
of
widespread
security
weaknesses
across
a
number
of
sensitive
government
databases.
One
such
potential
breach
is
the
subject
of
something
I
am
investigating
personally
right
now.
The
main
point
here
is
that
Healthcare.gov
and
the
various
exchanges
operating
under
its
umbrella
will
be
breached&#8230;
at
some
point&#8230;
if
they
haven&#8217;t
already.
What
we
need
to
ensure
is
that
the
brightest
people
and
the
most
effective
and
up-to-date
strategies
are
employed
to
minimize
or
eliminate
the
damage
of
those
inevitable
attacks.
With
millions
of
Americans
being
required
to
enter
their
Social
Security
numbers
and
other
personal
information
into
those
databases,
criminal
hackers
will
be
keen
to
break
in.
You
can
bet
on
that.
And
in
the
event
that
such
a
break
in
occurs,
we
frankly
believe
that
one
of
the
first
steps
that
the
government
should
take
is
to
notify
those
individuals
whose
private
information
may
have
been
compromised.
For
that
reason,
this
week,
the
House
passed
a
piece
of
legislation
requiring
that
HHS
notify
individuals
within
two
business
days
of
any
breach
of
a
security
system
maintained
by
federal
or
state
exchanges
that
is
known
to
have
resulted
in
the
theft
of
personally
identifiable
information.
Pretty
simple.
Remarkably,
122
members
of
the
House
voted
against
the
requirement
&#8211;
all
of
them
Democrats.
I
can
certainly
understand
why
some
Democrats
in
Congress
are
hyper-sensitive
about
criticism
of
the
&#8220;Affordable
Care
Act&#8221;.
I
get
it.
I
really
do.
But
I
think
that
given
the
widespread
network
vulnerabilities
across
the
government,
and
particularly
the
vulnerabilities
with
these
new
problem-plagued
and
untested
exchanges,
that
you
would
want
to
do
everything
possible
to
ensure
that
people
are
protected.
It&#8217;s
not
a
knock
on
the
healthcare
law.
It&#8217;s
just
the
reality
of
the
situation.
This
is
simply
a
responsible
step
to
take
in
the
event
that
the
worst
happens.
That&#8217;s
why
67
Democrats
did
vote
for
it.
In
any
case,
that&#8217;s
where
things
stand.
We&#8217;ve
got
some
major
legislation
coming
in
the
next
few
weeks,
funding
bills,
etc.
At
this
point,
it&#8217;s
not
entirely
clear
when
we&#8217;ll
take
up
the
individual
pieces,
but
definitely
stay
tuned
over
the
next
few
weeks.
And
if
there
is
anything
I
can
do
in
the
meantime,
please
let
me
know.
Thanks
again.

Nugent Member
