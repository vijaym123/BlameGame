Dear Friend &ndash;
Each year I have the privilege of nominating a limited number of young people to attend our nation's military academies. The honor of attending a service academy comes with an obligation and commitment to serve in the military after graduation.
If you or someone you know is interested in learning more about U.S. Military Academies, please join me for an informational session at my district office.
Students, parents, guidance counselors and school officials are all welcome to attend!
What: Military Academy Night
When: Tuesday, April 29 th , 2014
Location: My Garden Grove District Office
12397 Lewis St., #101
