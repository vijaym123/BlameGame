Ros-Lehtinen Supports Bills to Create Jobs, Reduce Gas Prices in South Florida, and Increase Our Nation&rsquo;s Energy Security
&ldquo;Our nation, long suffering from high gas prices, should be able to quickly utilize new energy sources to help alleviate the burden Americans face at the pump.&rdquo;
Miami, Florida &ndash; Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen announced her support for two bills which will increase our nation&rsquo;s energy security, work to lower gas prices, create much-needed jobs, and achieve U.S. foreign policy goals. The bills are:
H.R. 3301, the North American Energy Infrastructure Act, which will make the permitting process for cross-border pipeline construction more efficient so that permits aren&rsquo;t held up by unnecessary delays; and
H.R. 6, Domestic Prosperity and Global Freedom Act, which will help expedite the approval process for our nation&rsquo;s liquid natural gas exports.
Statement by Ros-Lehtinen:
&ldquo;An onerous permitting system for cross-border pipelines and liquid natural gas exports has slowed American economic growth and prevented us from taking advantage of both domestic resources and those from friendly neighbors like Canada. Our nation, long suffering from high gas prices, should be able to quickly utilize new energy sources to help alleviate the burden Americans face at the pump.
&ldquo;Expediting exports of liquid natural gas will grow our economy, create much-needed jobs, and provide a critical lifeline to our allies like Ukraine who are dependent on Russia for their natural gas supplies. By more efficiently utilizing domestic and friendly sources of energy, we can protect ourselves from oil price shocks by reducing our dependence on energy in volatile parts of the world, and allow us to more effectively achieve our foreign policy goals.&rdquo;
