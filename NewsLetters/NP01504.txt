Science, technology, engineering, and mathand robots
Dear Friend,
Tomorrow I will be in Grand Rapids with Governor Rick Snyder to watch the 2015 Michigan FIRST Robotics State Championship. This follows on my trip to St. Joseph high school
last month
to watch the regional competition. Im excited to spend time with both the students taking part in the contest and the teachers who dedicate their time and talent to help develop these future leaders.
Michigan FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) Robotics Competition is a nonprofit organization that runs the robotics program in Michigan. Like Governor Snyder, we have identified FIRST Robotics as a critical part of our efforts to encourage more youngsters to go into STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields. STEM-related jobs are growing twice as fast as all other fields. Unfortunately, in our country, nine out of 10 schools do not have computer science or engineering programs.
Here in Michigan, however, we have schools that investing in STEM education. As a result, our state was recently ranked fifth in the country among colleges for awarding STEM degrees.
The students in Grand Rapids tomorrow
who hail from throughout the state
might go on to perfect the self-driving car, engineer a future space vehicle, or even build a real-life Iron Man suit. And it all starts with innovative robotic competitions, which whets the imagination and spurs the desire to learn more in STEAM-related fields. That drive will propel Michigan to the top as the leader in these innovative fields
where the jobs of tomorrow will be.
Im looking forward to taking a first-hand look at our future.
