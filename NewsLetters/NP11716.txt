Dear David,
I'm back in Washington, D.C. following a district work period that sent
me all over the region. I visited local robotics teams in Hillsboro,
small businesses in Yamhill and Clatsop Counties, fishermen in Astoria,
veterans in St. Helens, and seniors in Beaverton. It has been a busy
month, but I am grateful for the opportunity to hear from so many
constituents. Here are some updates on the work I've been doing.
LEGISLATION
The Older Americans Act
I recently introduced a bill with Congressman Rubn Hinojosa to extend
and update the Older Americans Act (OAA). The legislation improves the
bipartisan bill passed by the Senate HELP Committee last year. It
includes new protections against elder abuse, expanded outreach to
low-income and minority seniors, improvements to the nutritional
program, more support for family caregivers, and other services that
help seniors live longer, healthier lives. Read more about the bill
here
.
DISTRICT WORK
Delivering Meals to Seniors
I packed and delivered meals to seniors in Beaverton who rely on Meals
on Wheels. A dedicated volunteer took me to meet with residents who say
the program plays a major role in their lives. The Older Americans Act
(OAA) provides essential funding for Meals on Wheels programs
throughout Oregon. Meeting with those seniors reaffirmed my commitment
to get the legislation reauthorized. Read more about some of the
volunteers and seniors I met here
.
Congresswoman in the Classroom
I continued my Congresswoman in the Classroom tour, visiting Lewis &
Clark elementary school in Astoria and Neil Armstrong Middle School in
Forest Grove. I learned about the use of technology and discussed some
of the legislation I am working on, including the Opportunities for
Success Act that I introduced to help low-income students pursue
internships. During my visit in Astoria, the students also grilled me
on a wide range of topics from freeway speed limits to my position on
zombies. Read more about their questions here
.
Robotics Expo
It was great to be back at Glencoe High School's RoboExpo in Hillsboro.
I toured the robotics show and met with local students who put their
designs on display. Thanks to all of the teachers, parents, and
volunteers who make this program thrive. Robotics is hands-on learning
that combines technology with creativity - the kind of learning that
leads to innovation.
Fishermen's Roundtable
I was glad to have the opportunity to meet with dozens of north coast
fishermen to discuss potential marine renewable energy development in
Oregon and the importance of protecting our vibrant local fisheries and
the communities and businesses they support. We discussed important
research and information needs as well as planning considerations and
alternate energy scenarios.
2 Year Anniversary
On February 9, 2014 I celebrated two years in Congress. It's been an
honor to represent Oregon's 1st District. I spoke to The Oregonian
about some of the work I've been doing since being sworn in.
As always, you can find more updates on my work around the district and
in Washington on Facebook
and Twitter
