Combating Domestic Violence Together
Some of the most violent and devastating crimes that occur in North
Dakota happen within homes, families, or even trusted relationships.
But for far too long, these offenses have been kept in the shadows
without the attention they need - an attitude I've been working to
change for decades.
One of the major reasons I ran for North Dakota Attorney General was to
combat the growing threat of domestic violence in our state. I heard
stories of how pervasive this crime was and I knew I had to help bring
it to light and tackle it head-on. But perhaps the biggest challenge
has been to talk about it as more than simply a 'women's issue.' The
fact is domestic violence has far-reaching impacts on men, women,
children, families, and entire communities.
During my time in office, I worked to implement the original Violence
Against Women Act throughout North Dakota and since then, we've been
able to treat it for what it really is - a heinous crime and a public
health issue. And since 1993, around the time the law was passed,
incidents of domestic violence have fallen by more than 60 percent
nationwide. But I know there's still more work to do in North Dakota,
particularly in the oil patch and in Indian Country. We can't
effectively combat domestic violence if we don't recognize that
challenges still exist and need our attention.
Discussing efforts to combat domestic violence in Fargo, one of four
roundtables on this issue that I've held across North Dakota this month.
When I joined the U.S. Senate, the first bill I cosponsored was the
reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, and I pushed for a
key provision for Native leaders to have the authority to prosecute
non-Native perpetrators who commit these crimes on tribal land.
Last month, I launched my Strong & Safe Communities Initiative to
address emerging challenges throughout North Dakota. It creates a Task
Force of experts, advocates, and leaders across the state on a variety
of issues, including domestic violence, to help fight crime and keep
our communities strong and families safe in their homes. And this month
- Domestic Violence Awareness Month - I've talked to folks on the
ground in Fargo, Valley City, Bismarck, and Ellendale who work closely
with victims and offenders. With their help, we can continue to educate
about how these criminal activities have dire consequences and
long-term effects on victims, and we must eliminate any societal or
cultural acceptance of these abhorrent acts.
North Dakotans are strong and resilient - I've seen it since my early
days growing up in Mantador. And no matter what adversity we might
face, I know we can tackle our challenges, including domestic violence,
if we do so together.

Combating
Domestic
Violence
Together
Some
of
the
most
violent
and
devastating
crimes
that
occur
in
North
Dakota
happen
within
homes,
families,
or
even
trusted
relationships.
But
for
far
too
long,
these
offenses
have
been
kept
in
the
shadows
without
the
attention
they
need
-
an
attitude
I've
been
working
to
change
for
decades.
One
of
the
major
reasons
I
ran
for
North
Dakota
Attorney
General
was
to
combat
the
growing
threat
of
domestic
violence
in
our
state.
I
heard
stories
of
how
pervasive
this
crime
was
and
I
knew
I
had
to
help
bring
it
to
light
and
tackle
it
head-on.
But
perhaps
the
biggest
challenge
has
been
to
talk
about
it
as
more
than
simply
a
'women's
issue.'
The
fact
is
domestic
violence
has
far-reaching
impacts
on
men,
women,
children,
families,
and
entire
communities.
During
my
time
in
office,
I
worked
to
implement
the
original
Violence
Against
Women
Act
throughout
North
Dakota
and
since
then,
we've
been
able
to
treat
it
for
what
it
really
is
-
a
heinous
crime
and
a
public
health
issue.
And
since
1993,
around
the
time
the
law
was
passed,
incidents
of
domestic
violence
have
fallen
by
more
than
60
percent
nationwide.
But
I
know
there's
still
more
work
to
do
in
North
Dakota,
particularly
in
the
oil
patch
and
in
Indian
Country.
We
can't
effectively
combat
domestic
violence
if
we
don't
recognize
that
challenges
still
exist
and
need
our
attention.
Discussing
efforts
to
combat
domestic
violence
in
Fargo, one
of four
roundtables
on
this
issue
that I've
held
across
North
Dakota
this
month.
When
I
joined
the
U.S.
Senate,
the
first
bill
I
cosponsored
was
the
reauthorization
of
the
Violence
Against
Women

and
I
pushed
for
a
key
provision
for
Native
leaders
to
have
the
authority
to
prosecute
non-Native
perpetrators
who
commit
these
crimes
on
tribal
land.
Last
month,
I
launched
my
Strong
&amp;
Safe
Communities
Initiative
to
address
emerging
challenges
throughout
North
Dakota.
It
creates
a
Task
Force
of
experts,
advocates,
and
leaders
across
the
state
on
a
variety
of
issues,
including
domestic
violence,
to
help
fight
crime
and
keep
our
communities
strong
and
families
safe
in
their
homes.
And
this
month
-
Domestic
Violence
Awareness
Month
-
I've
talked
to
folks
on
the
ground
in
Fargo,
Valley
City,
Bismarck,
and
Ellendale
who
work
closely
with
victims
and

With

and
long-term

on

and
we
must
eliminate
any
societal
or
cultural
acceptance
of
these
abhorrent
acts.
North
Dakotans
are
strong
and
resilient
-
I've
seen
it
since
my
early
days
growing
up
in
Mantador.
And
no
matter
what
adversity
we
might
face,
I
know
we
can
tackle
our
challenges,
including
domestic
violence,
if
we
do
so
together.
