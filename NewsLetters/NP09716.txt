Congressman Tipton votes to establish Select Committee on Benghazi:
"There are many questions that remain unanswered about that tragic
night on September 11, 2012, when four Americans were murdered at the
U.S. consulate in Benghazi. The American people and especially the
families of those who were killed deserve to know the full truth of
what happened. It is my hope that the Select Committee will be able to
cut through the spin, weed out contradicting information, and get to
the bottom of all that occurred leading up to, during, and after the
attack," said Tipton. "Should the Committee find that the American
people were deliberately misled in the wake of the attack by the
Administration or that there was any negligence in providing security
at the embassy, then those officials responsible must be held fully
accountable for their actions." Read more
Tipton votes to hold Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress, calls for
special counsel investigation into IRS: "What the IRS did was wrong
whether aimed at conservative groups, liberal groups or any group
legally attempting to express their viewpoints. The agency singled-out
groups that the current Administration didn't agree with, to silence
voices, to stifle civic discussion," said Tipton. "This was an
appalling abuse of power, it was illegal, and those responsible have
still not been held accountable. The full scope of this scandal has
still yet to be realized. One thing is certain, this can never happen
again and those responsible must face consequences for their actions.
It's time for the Attorney General to appoint a special counsel to
conduct a criminal investigation into what went on at the IRS and
provide the American people with the answers they deserve." Read more

Tipton votes to strengthen charter schools programs: Congressman Tipton

support, and it now heads to the Senate. Read more

Tipton urges FDA to reconsider spent grain rule: Congressman Tipton
urged the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to reconsider a proposed

COMMENT:
Avoid
tables
that
are
more
than
a
single
"page"

inches

because
they

You

In
Case
You
Missed
It
Congressman
Tipton
votes
to
establish
Select
Committee
on
Benghazi :
&#8220;There
are
many
questions
that
remain
unanswered
about
that
tragic
night
on
September
11,
2012,
when
four
Americans
were
murdered
at
the
U.S.
consulate
in
Benghazi.
The
American
people
and
especially
the
families
of
those
who
were
killed
deserve
to
know
the
full
truth
of
what
happened.
It
is
my
hope
that
the
Select
Committee
will
be
able
to
cut
through
the
spin,
weed
out
contradicting
information,
and
get
to
the
bottom
of
all
that
occurred
leading
up
to,
during,
and
after
the
attack,&#8221;
said
Tipton.
&#8220;Should
the
Committee
find
that
the
American
people
were
deliberately
misled
in
the
wake
of
the
attack
by
the
Administration
or
that
there
was
any
negligence
in
providing
security
at
the
embassy,
then
those
officials
responsible
must
be
held
fully
accountable
for
their
actions.&#8221;

Tipton
votes
to
hold
Lois
Lerner
in
contempt
of
Congress,
calls
for
special
counsel
investigation
into
IRS :
&#8220;What
the
IRS
did
was
wrong
whether
aimed
at
conservative
groups,
liberal
groups
or
any
group
legally
attempting
to
express
their
viewpoints.
The
agency
singled-out
groups
that
the
current
Administration
didn&#8217;t
agree
with,
to
silence
voices,
to
stifle
civic
discussion,&#8221;
said
Tipton.
&#8220;This
was
an
appalling
abuse
of
power,
it
was
illegal,
and
those
responsible
have
still
not
been
held
accountable.
The
full
scope
of
this
scandal
has
still
yet
to
be
realized.
One
thing
is
certain,
this
can
never
happen
again
and
those
responsible
must
face
consequences
for
their
actions.
It&#8217;s
time
for
the
Attorney
General
to
appoint
a
special
counsel
to
conduct
a
criminal
investigation
into
what
went
on
at
the
IRS
and
provide
the
American
people
with
the
answers
they
deserve.&#8221;
