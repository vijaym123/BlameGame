NOT A SUBSCRIBER?
Dear Friends,
Last week, President Obama
announced important news about your health insurance. Because this is such
an important announcement that affects millions of Americans, including
those who purchase their health insurance policies in the individual
market, I want to spell out the changes the President implemented
through his Enforcement Discretion. Here is what you need to
know:
In response to concerns from individuals who have
received cancellation notices from their insurance company because their
policy did not meet the standards of the Affordable Care Act, President
Obama is allowing insurers to offer consumers the option to keep their
2013 health insurance plans into 2014, without change. For example, if
your insurer renews your plan on October 1st of every year, your plan
would be renewed through October 1,
2014.
Insurers must notify their enrollees that they can purchase coverage
through Covered California, regardless of whether they qualify for
subsidies or not.
Insurers must inform
consumers what protections they are giving up to keep the plan they
have.
It is ultimately the decision
of the health insurance carrier to renew policies, and regulators in
each state to approve this change.
I care deeply
about the success of comprehensive health insurance reform and I want it
to work for all Californians. Ive shared the many concerns and
individual stories of my constituents with the Administration to make this
change, and Im pleased with the Presidents proposal to allow people
to keep their policies for another year. This will give individuals
more time to examine their health insurance options in Covered California
which offers side-by-side comparisons of plans at a variety of price
points, as well as subsidies to those who are
eligible.
Should you have any questions regarding your health insurance, my staff
and I stand ready to assist you in any way we can. You can call my
office at (650) 323-2984 (Palo Alto) or (202) 225-8104 (Washington,
D.C.).
Sincerely,
Anna G. Eshoo
Member
of Congress
