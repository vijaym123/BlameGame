Dear Friend,
Detached, flat-footed and incompetent - those are words that folks are using to describe how the Obama Administration has handled the crisis along our southern border. It is becoming more and more clear that the problems we are facing along the border could have been stopped years ago had the administration listened to governors in border states.
The president has used this crisis to push for a $3.7 billion funding request but has said on several occasions that these funds had to be passed by Congress before there would be any emergency response to the flood of unaccompanied children crossing the border. That does not resemble a response to an acute crisis. Governor Rick Perry, on the other hand, is not sitting on his hands while the president fails to act; he is mobilizing the Texas National Guard.
Instead of demanding billions of dollars from Congress, the president should be engaging with members of the House and Senate regardless of party affiliation. He should be seeking different ideas on how we should address this issue. The president should be working to reunite these unaccompanied children with their families in their home countries while sending a message that crossing the border in this manner is not acceptable and is too dangerous for these children. Instead, in usual fashion, hes making demands and blaming Congress when he cant accomplish his goal.
The security of our country and the safety of tens of thousands of young children are at stake, and we need a leader in the White House.
God Bless,
Gregg Harper
Member of Congress
