A balanced budget
Dear Friend,
This week Republicans in the House of Representatives released our 2016 budget. After years of fiscal uncertainty, it is time to stop kicking the can down the road. Our historic national debt is simply unsustainable, threatening to bury future generations under an avalanche of debt. We have a responsibility to the American people to cut our deficit and enact a balanced budget.
The 2016 House Republican budget does just that. It balances the budget in less than 10 years
without raising taxes. Contrast that to the President whose budget never balances. Our budget takes responsible and necessary steps to put our nations fiscal house back in order.
Our budget cuts $5.5 trillion in spending, calls for a fairer, simpler tax code to promote job creation and a healthy economy, and we place our country firmly on a path to paying off the debt by growing our economy from the bottom-up and making government more effective, efficient, and accountable to you.
Our budget repeals the presidents health care law, including all of its taxes, regulations, and mandates, ensures a strong national defense, strengthens Medicare and Social Security, restores federalism, and cuts waste, corporate welfare, and improves accountability.
My top priority remains promoting job creation and economic growth here at home in Southwest Michigan. A balanced budget will help grow our economy, help create local jobs, and build our economic strength for the future of Michigan and our nation.
It's about time.
God bless,
Fred
