Dear Friends,
February is American Heart Month, which
provides a great opportunity to renew our dedication to the fight
against this terrible disease, which impacts far too many of our friends,
neighbors and loved ones. It is estimated that over 80 million
Americans today are living with some form of cardiovascular disease or the
after-effects of
stroke.
Heart disease is often thought of as a mans
illness.
However, in the U.S. there are as many women who
suffer from heart disease or stroke as there are men.
According
to the Centers for Disease Control, heart disease is the leading cause
of death for women in the United States with 1 in every 3 female
deaths attributed to this illness.
In addition, almost
two-thirds of women who die suddenly of coronary heart disease have not shown
any previous symptoms. Part of the problem is that women are rarely
tested for heart disease.
However, we can take
immediate steps to combat heart disease. We must redouble our efforts to
test, diagnose and treat potential victims.
We should also
support educational efforts by organizations seeking to teach young
women about the dangers of heart disease and the benefits of early and
routine checkups.
With education, diagnosis and treatment,
we can and we will save lives.
We must also promote
physical activity and heart-healthy habits in our daily lives and that of
those we love.
In Congress we are also working to end
this terrible disease. Recently, I joined my female Congressional
colleagues in support of the National Wear Red Day Movement and to stand in
solidarity with the women who are currently living with heart disease
or stroke.
By educating young women about the importance of
periodic screenings and increasing our efforts in testing, diagnosing
and treating every victim we can significantly lower the number of
those impacted this terrible disease.
Also by adding 30
minutes of exercise to our day we can help prevent many of the causes of
heart disease.
Beating heart disease will not be easy, but
together we can prevent those we love from becoming another statistic in
this battle.
Sincerely,
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
Member of
Congress
