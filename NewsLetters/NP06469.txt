Dear Friend,
Welcome to my
Congress in your Inbox
e-Newsletter.
On Wednesday
evening President Obama delivered an address to the American people
about the threat posed by the terrorist group the Islamic State of Iraq
and the Levant (ISIL), and his strategy to degrade and ultimately
destroy this organization. Your input would be a valuable resource for me
going forward and Id like to know what you think of the strategy the
President proposed. Please take a minute to share your thoughts on the
President's plan and the U.S. response by
sending me an email
or filling out the
survey at the bottom of this newsletter .
You can read my full statement regarding the
President's proposed strategy to combat ISIL by clicking
here.
I also wanted to share some information about the exceptional
work being done by the
YouthBuild program
in
communities like Lowell and Lawrence, and how their efforts are helping grow
opportunities for young people. Be sure to check out my
8th annual River Day
this coming weekend in Lawrence,
Fitchburg and Stow! And find more info below on how people will benefit from
raising the minimum wage , as well as my recent
interview on
WCAP radio .
As always, I
look forward to your feedback at
my website , or
on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Thanks for staying engaged
and enjoy this week's edition of
Congress in your
Inbox.
Sincerely,
Niki
Tsongas
