Here's the bad (ok,
terrible ) news: Karl Rove just dumped
$640,000
on Chicagoland T.V. to attack Brad&rsquo;s strong Democratic record.
Here's the good (ok,
AMAZING ) news:
Since Rove went on the air, more than
1,400 supporters
have pitched in to help Brad fight back.
If we can hit 1,500 by midnight, it&rsquo;ll be a
STUNNING COMEBACK
for us and a
CRUSHING BLOW
for Rove. But David, according to our records, it looks like you haven&rsquo;t yet had a chance to chip in online for Brad since Rove&rsquo;s attacks went on the air.
If there was ever a time to chip in, this is it.
