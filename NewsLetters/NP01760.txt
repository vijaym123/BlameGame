David, Today I am proud and honored to announce my candidacy for Congress in the 10th Congressional District of Illinois.
I know we can be a nation where every child has an opportunity for a quality education; every family has access to quality, affordable health care; and anyone willing to work hard has the opportunity to earn a fair wage, provide for their family, and achieve a dignified retirement.
I&rsquo;m so grateful that you were with me for my past campaigns and I hope I can count on your support again.
Will you contribute $5 or more today to help my campaign start strong?
$5 &gt;&gt;
$36 &gt;&gt;
$50 &gt;&gt;
$100 &gt;&gt;
$250 &gt;&gt;
Other &gt;&gt;
I want to go back to Congress because the work we started is unfinished. The challenges we face are too important to give up the fight.
We need to continue to fight for our Democratic values -- to strengthen our economy, to protect our environment, to protect a woman&rsquo;s right to choose, and to ensure equality of opportunity for all people. David, I hope you&rsquo;ll join our campaign for a government that works for all of us: http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/Campaign-Launch
Together, I know we can finish what we started.
I am so grateful for your support,
Brad
