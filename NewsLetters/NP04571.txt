Dear Friends,
A few months ago I wrote to you announcing my 2014 Congressional Survey.
With so many important issues before our Commonwealth and our nation, I wanted to get your opinions and I thank you for sharing them with me.
Now that the response period has closed, I wanted to share with you the findings.
Click here to view a summary of the results.
With nearly 5,000 individual responses, I have found your feedback helpful and I will use your input as Congress tackles the important issues before us.
I am looking forward to conducting additional surveys and hope you will continue to participate.
It's a busy time in Washington, and I am eager to continue to work on your behalf.
As always, I encourage you to
contact me or my staff
with any questions you may have regarding policy or casework issues.
It is an honor to serve you.
Sincerely,
BRETT GUTHRIE
Member of Congress
