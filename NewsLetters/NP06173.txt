The Scalise Capitol Report
September 22,
2014
A strong
national energy policy is critical to national security and economic
growth
A smart energy policy equates to a healthy
economy. American energy is directly linked to creating more jobs, but it
is also critical for America's national security. A growing number of
states across the country are now involved in energy production
through advanced technologies like horizontal drilling and hydraulic
fracturing, and as a result theyre experiencing economic growth and lower
unemployment. The American people are hungry for a strong national
energy policy. By unleashing our nations abundance of energy, we have an
opportunity to increase America's energy production and create more
good, high-paying jobs while also lowering gas prices at the pump. Last
week, the House passed a bold energy package that will green-light
critical energy projects like the Keystone XL Pipeline, expand energy
exploration, and roll back radical job-killing regulations. The House
will continue to fight for solutions to help American families, even if
the do nothing Senate chooses to sit on the sidelines.

The six-year
anniversary of the Keystone Pipeline application
For nearly
2200 days, President Obama has said no to 40,000 good jobs, American
energy, and national security by letting the
Keystone XL Pipeline
application
sit on the shelf. Its long past time for
him to green-light this project, which would say yes to these good jobs
and grow our economy.

Fighting for solutions to help American
families
The House has passed more than 360 bills that put American
families first, and
over 40 of those are jobs bills .
While these bills are collecting dust
on Harry Reid's desk, the Senate showed how out of touch they are
with America's priorities by spending time recently debating changes to
the free speech clause in the Constitution's First Amendment! The House
will continue to pass bills to solve problems facing American
families. In fact, last week the House passed a bipartisan jobs package
designed to foster an economic recovery and get Americans back to work with
high-paying jobs. Click on the photo below to watch me share what the
House is doing to get our economy moving
again:
Another day, another Obamacare broken promise
A
shocking government watchdog
report
reveals yet another
broken promise from this Administration: the President's health care law
allows hard-earned taxpayer dollars to cover abortions. Many of us
argued at the time Obamacare passed that it would funnel taxpayer dollars
to elective abortions, despite President Obamas repeated broken
promises to the contrary. This independent report validates our claims and
proves that yet another Obamacare promise has been broken. The
Administration should be held accountable for this, the most recent in a
string of Obamacare broken promises to the American people. Earlier this
year, the House passed bipartisan legislation to codify the Hyde
Amendment, prohibiting taxpayer funding for abortion. I urge the Senate to do
its job and pass the Houses bipartisan legislation that will protect
taxpayer money from being used to fund
abortions.
It is an honor to
