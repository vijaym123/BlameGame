Dear Friend,
Over the last few weeks, I've talked with folks throughout the 5th
district about their concerns. I called for investment in Metro-North's
New Haven rail line, and I listened to those who shared their thoughts
on the President's State of the Union Address. Check out some of the
highlights below.
What are your thoughts on these issues, or any other? Let me know by
email
or at 202-225-4476. I look forward to hearing
from you.
State of the Union
Last Tuesday, President Obama delivered his State of the Union Address.
I'm pleased he focused on opportunities, particularly around efforts to
better prepare our workforce for the jobs of the future.
Specifically, the President highlighted two existing manufacturing hubs
and stated his intention to designate an additional six this year.
Connecticut is actively pursuing a hub designation for a regional
collaboration of companies and universities, which would spur
innovation through research and development. I'm fully committed to
supporting this initiative to help train our workers and support job
creation in the critical area of manufacturing, which has been so key
to our region.
Metro-North Upgrades
On Sunday, I joined Governor Malloy, Lt. Governor Wymnan,
Transportation Commissioner Redeker, and Senator Blumenthal to announce
$10 million in energy upgrades to Metro-North's busy New Haven line.
Given recent service delays and tragic accidents, we need to boost
infrastructure in our aging railroads and the energy infrastructure on
which they depend to provide reliable service. As a member of the House
Rail Subcommittee, I'm also continuing to call for reauthorization of a
critical passenger rail safety bill that expired last October.
Congress on Your Corner in Bethel
Thank you to everyone who came by my Congress on Your Corner at Byrd's
Books in Bethel. Conversations like the ones we had that night are
critical for me to be able to bring your voice to Washington and
represent you. I really appreciated hearing your thoughts on
unemployment insurance, health care, and trade issues.
Upcoming Torrington Senior Center Visit
I want to hear from you. If you're in the Torrington area, stop by the
senior center on Friday, February 7, at 11:30 am. I'll be sharing some
thoughts on what I'm working on in Washington, and I'm looking forward
to hearing your suggestions and questions. State Representative Roberta
Willis (64th District) will be joining me as well, and we are eager to
see you there.
