Time for the EPA to Back Off
Dear Friends,
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is going rogue. They are claiming the authority to garnish non-federal wages to pay fines and other non-tax debts without a court order.
They even claim they can decide who can and cannot present a defense against these heavy handed collection tactics.
Americans have a constitutional right to due process and it is absurd for any agency, especially a regulatory agency like the EPA, to claim they can decide who is and who is not allowed to make a defense.
And for them to say they can garnish wages without a court order or due process is clearly reprehensible.
These latest delusions of power come on the heels of their attempts to impose an $187,500 daily fine on a Wyoming couple who built a pond on their own land.The EPA is out of control and it is time for Congress to rein it in which is why I signed onto H.J. Res. 118 to invalidate the EPAs wage garnishing rule.
If you have concerns on these or other issues please
tell me your thoughts and concerns.
