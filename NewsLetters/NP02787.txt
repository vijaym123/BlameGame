The House
Needs Partners to Advance Bipartisan
Solutions
Dear Friend,
This week, the House continued to pass
solutions that will create jobs and grow
our economy throughout Virginias
Fifth District and across the country. We
passed two bills to make several tax
provisions permanent which will provide
relief and certainty to working families
and small businesses. Additionally, we
approved the Senates version of the
Keystone XL Pipeline, sending it to the
Presidents desk.
Washingtons complex and outdated
tax code continues to hurt working families
trying to secure their financial futures
and stifles small businesses ability
to grow their operations and create
much-needed jobs. On Thursday, we advanced
the
America Gives More Act , which improves
and makes permanent a number of tax rules
governing charitable donations and
charitable organizations. Charities and
Americans who donate deserve a tax code
that is straightforward and reliable.
On Friday, we passed
the
Americas Small Business Tax Relief
Act , which would make permanent several
tax provisions, including one that allows
small businesses and family farms to
expense certain investments in new
equipment and property each year. Our Main
Street businesses and family farms are the
backbone of our local economies and are
essential to providing the jobs and
economic growth Virginias Fifth
District needs. This bill is a vital step
towards freeing our Main Street businesses
and family farms from government-created
obstacles to encourage economic growth.
Also this week,
the
House approved the Senates
version
of the Keystone XL Pipeline.
Now, the bill will go to the President for
approval. The Keystone XL Pipeline is a
crucial piece of our all-of-the-above
energy strategy that will lower gas prices,
create new American jobs, strengthen our
national security, and make life easier for
our families, Main Street businesses, and
small farms. Though
the
President has threatened to veto
approval of the Keystone Pipeline, it is my
hope he will reconsider his position and
join us in reaping the benefits of this
significant project. I will continue to
work with my colleagues to implement an
effective strategy to ensure this bill is
put into law.
I was pleased to see these three bills
pass the House with bipartisan support and
believe the House will continue to fight
for real solutions to the challenges our
great nation faces. We will continue to
advance bipartisan policies like the bills
we passed this week, but we cannot
implement these solutions alone. It is my
hope that the Senate and the President will
join us in advancing policies to build a
stronger America for our children and
grandchildren.
