Dear Friends,
These last few weeks have seen remarkable developments in the global community. Most notably, P5+1 partners have announced the historic framework agreement with Iran. Having a framework for negotiations with Iran is an imperative step towards accomplishing one of the highest foreign policy priorities of the United States: ensuring Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ll be hosting a Town Hall Meeting on Nuclear Negotiations with Iran on Friday, April 17th to discuss these developments and answer your questions.
Town Hall Meeting on Nuclear Negotiations with Iran

Map it!
This is a tremendously complex process and it is important to examine our role at the negotiating table and the Middle East region at large. I hope you will join me to discuss this important topic and I look forward to hearing from you.
