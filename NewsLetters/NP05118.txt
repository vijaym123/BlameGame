We're out of people to email you.
This week, you should have received an email from:
-- President Barack Obama
-- President Bill Clinton
That's how important this is! With 12 days to go, we're getting massively outspent by Republican groups (another $4,7OO,OOO against Democrats was announced just this week). And we're fighting with everything we&rsquo;ve got to turn it around.
We need 8,OOO more donations in the next 24 hours if we want any shot at giving President Obama a Democratic victory for his final two years.
David Johnson Answered President Obama's Call-to-Action? ## NO DONATION ##
We're pleading, David. Can you answer the President's call-to-action today?
