10 HOURS UNTIL THE FINAL ADVERTISING DEADLINE BEFORE THE MIDTERMS
Pitch in and we will TRIPLE-MATCH it &gt;&gt;
Friend -- The latest projection: 50 Democrats - 50 Republicans.
Nate Silver reports that &ldquo;this year&rsquo;s Senate election is close. Republicans have the clearer path to a majority, but it&rsquo;s a treacherous one.&rdquo;
The election is alarmingly soon -- in
exactly two weeks
-- and the Senate is ANYONE&rsquo;S to take.
If we can&rsquo;t launch our final advertising push tomorrow, unanswered Republican attacks will tip the Senate to the GOP. We MUST fully fund our response by midnight -- we&rsquo;re just $286,000 short. It&rsquo;s ESSENTIAL to our win, and we&rsquo;re SO SO INCREDIBLY close.

ABC News
reports, &ldquo;If Republicans... fall one seat short of controlling the Senate,
it will rank among the most crushing failures in recent political history.&rdquo;
But we&rsquo;ll be blunt: If we can&rsquo;t hit our two-week-out advertising goal by midnight,
DEMOCRATS could be the ones to lose by a single seat.
