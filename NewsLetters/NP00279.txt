Fair Trade, Not Free
Trade
Today, I voted against giving President Obama
expanded powers to negotiate free trade deals. The bill before the House
would have given the President authority to write comprehensive trade
deals with Asian and South American countries without any amendments by
Congress and with limited debate.
Given President Obamas
track record of broken promises and circumventing Congress, why should
the American people trust he is negotiating with their best interests
in mind?
The damage done to manufacturing in West Virginia
by past free trade laws, such as NAFTA and CAFTA, is devastating. West
Virginia families deserve better than trade deals cut behind closed
doors with little input from Congress. Ive never been afraid to break
with my party when its the right thing for West Virginia, and todays
vote against Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) was the right thing for
the First District.
Did You Catch Me on
Hoppy?
On Wednesday, I joined WV MetroNews host Hoppy
Kercheval to discuss the threats to our West Virginia coal industry. We
discussed a letter I led along with Reps. Mooney and Jenkins urging
Governor Tomblin not to be complicit in the EPAs damaging rules for
coal power plants. The letter lays out the threats to West Virginias
economy from the proposed rule. Our Governor and state government should
not comply with this attack on our coal industry, and I call on him
to fight these destructive regulations.

Protecting At-Risk Kids
The National Guard Youth
ChalleNGe Program give troubled youth a second chance by providing them the
opportunity to obtain their high school diploma. That is why I
offered an amendment to boost funding for the Program by $5 million to
expand its positive impact on our young people.

A Speaking
Role
This week I had the honor of speaking to two groups about creating
jobs and fostering innovation. The West Virginia Chamber of Commerce
visited Washington to discuss the burdens of regulation, taxes, and an
Administration waging a devastating War on Coal.
The High Performance Building Roundtable invited me
to speak about our recent legislation encouraging energy-efficient
buildings. By upgrading our infrastructure, we can cut costs for
businesses and create jobs in high-skilled manufacturing and construction
fields. I thank them for the opportunity.
Have a great week,
David
