Dear
friends,
When I talk to my friends and neighbors, and visit communities
throughout our state, the number one issue that comes up is the
economy.
There is a widespread consensus that we should be doing
better.
We should be creating more jobs.
We should be sparking
more innovation.
We should be opening up more opportunities,
especially for our young people.
And to achieve those things,
Congress can play a positive role
not by increasing government spending
and regulation; but by reducing the power of government to enable
families and businesses to grow and prosper.
The main problem
is that while the House is taking action to bolster our economy
(passing dozens of jobs bills), the Senate has been asleep at the
wheel.
Actually, its worse than that: the Senate Democrats
led by Harry
Reid - have been deliberately blocking legislation that has already
passed the House in order to give President Obama a campaign
issue.
Consider: As the campaign season drags on, President
Obama has changed his rhetoric, attacking Republicans in Congress, and
claiming that Congress lack of productivity is because Republicans dont
like him.
The
Washington Post
picked up on this theme,
running a story titled
Obamas New Argument:
Republicans Are Picking on Me Because They Dont Like
Me .
The article quotes Obama saying, "What I do worry about is
that, right now, we got a Republican Party that seems to only care about
saying no to meRepublicans in Congress right now have shown over and
over they'll do anything to rig the system for those at the top or to
try to score political points on me."
But is any of that
true?
What is the reality?
During the 113 th
Congress (which started in January 2013), the Republican House has
passed nearly 40 jobs bill that the Senate Democrats refuse to
consider.
These bills would cut red tape, expand American energy
production, improve our broken tax code, and lower health care costs.
And yet the Senate wont even allow a vote on these bills.
Overall, the House has passed nearly 300 bills that the Senate has failed to
act on.
As for the bills that
have
passed
Congress and been signed into law, its the House (not the Senate) which
has been the source for most of these bills.
Of the 120 bills
President Obama has signed into law, 73 percent originated from the
Republican-controlled House.
Overall, the House has passed four
times as many bills as the Senate.
Things have gotten so
bad that a Democratic committee chairman, Sen. Patrick Leahy, went on
record saying he is furious with his leaders for blocking a
bipartisan patent bill that would have encouraged more business innovation
and job creation.
President Truman had a sign on his
desk: The buck stops here.
For President Obama, the buck is
everywhere, except with him.
The American people deserve real
leadership from the White House.
Instead, all we get is whining and
finger-pointing.
That will need to change in order to
get our economy moving again.
In the meantime, the House will
keep doing its job and hope for a change of
heart.
