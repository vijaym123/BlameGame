Dear Friends,
Given the mixed track record of our past free trade deals, Congress must have a voice in the direction of future agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That's why I'll be voting against fast-track legislation that gives the President the authority to sign major new trade agreements like TPP without congressional approval.
Where do you stand on fast-track trade deals? Feel free to weigh in with the
survey
below.
Thanks,
Ted Deutch
