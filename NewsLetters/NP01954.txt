BREAKING: Vote for Medicare-killing GOP budget TONIGHT
David -- This is utterly terrifying:
Last night,
John Boehner, Paul Ryan, and the GOP raked in $17.5 million at a mega-fundraiser -- and shattered the fundraising record.
We&rsquo;ll be blunt: If the Republicans bury us under this wave of special interest cash, their disgusting agenda could actually become law. All those millionaire donors would see lavish tax breaks. And Obamacare and Medicare would be obliterated.
You can&rsquo;t let that happen.
Suggested Action for David Johnson
Donate $5 to stop the Republicans' budget
By the vote tonight, we need 3,000 more strong Democrats to step up and fight back. Will you help?
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
