April 4th, 2014
Dear Friend,
This week, I commemorated the life and work of Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr. on the floor of the United States House of Representatives,
President Obama announced that more than 7 million Americans enrolled
in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, the
Library of Congress announced they will preserve Isaac Hayes' work in
the National Recording Registry, and the Humane Society awarded me with
their "Humane Champion" award for my work protecting animals. Keep
reading to learn more.

April 4th: Remembering Martin Luther King
This morning, I went to the floor of the United States House of
Representatives to pay tribute to the life of Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr. and commemorate the 46th anniversary of his assassination at the
Lorraine Motel. Reverend King was killed while standing up for economic
justice including fair wages and the right to organize. Sadly, for too
many Memphians and Americans, economic justice remains a dream
unfulfilled. I will continue fighting for fairness and justice in
Congress. You can watch my speech here
.
Tonight, I will also speak at the April 4th Foundation's 2014 Gala,
where Dr. C.T. Vivian will give the keynote and receive this year's "I
Am A Man" award. The award is presented each year to individuals who
continue to strive to keep Dr. King's dream alive and make it a
reality, something that Dr. Vivian, a Presidential Medal of Freedom
recipient, has spent his life doing. I look forward to the Gala as well
as seeing Congresswoman Barbara Lee and Bobby Seale there this evening.
Tomorrow, the National Civil Rights Museum at the Lorraine Motel will
reopen after its renovation. The New York Times this week described
the newly rebuilt museum as "setting a standard for museums
exploring civil rights." I will speak at the official opening ceremony
tomorrow morning about the changes made during the renovations and the
museum's importance to our city and to our country. I hope you will
visit the museum to see the changes for yourself.
Join My Telephone Town Hall on Monday, April 7th
On Monday evening at 6:20PM CT I will host a telephone town hall to
answer your questions and discuss a variety of topics including my next
"Building a Healthier Memphis" wellness event taking place next
weekend. If you would like to participate in this telephone town hall
on Monday, April 7th, please fill out the form here
with your home phone
number before Sunday evening - unfortunately, we are unable to call
cell phones.
Building a Healthier Memphis
The open enrollment period for 2014 health coverage through the
Affordable Care Act's marketplaces ended on Monday, and more than 7
million Americans enrolled in high-quality, affordable coverage before
the deadline. With so many Americans now enrolled in coverage through
marketplaces like HealthCare.gov
, President Obama is right when he says "the Affordable Care Act
is here to stay.
"
The Affordable Care Act is already helping millions of Americans get
covered and get the care they need, but we can do more. Last month, I
launched my "Building a Healthier Memphis" series on wellness in the
Ninth District with a panel discussion and education session focused on
the racial disparities in breast cancer outcomes in Memphis. During the
panel-which drew an overflow crowd-experts discussed the reasons for
the current outcome gap and helped identify how Memphians can take
advantage of provisions of the President's Affordable Care Act that
include no co-pay and no deductible mammograms to address the disparity
and improve outcomes for themselves, their families, and their
communities.
I was encouraged that so many Memphians attended the panel and
education session to learn how they can improve their own health and
the health of their families and communities. Today, I am glad to
invite you to the next wellness event in my "Building a Healthier
Memphis" series. It will be held at 10:00AM on Saturday, April 12th at
Church Health Center Wellness located at 1115 Union Avenue.
This next event will focus on how our community can work together to
stem the rising tide of diabetes diagnoses in Memphis and will include
a number of local experts on diabetes prevention as well as Dr. Ann
Albright, the United States Centers for Disease Control Director of
diabetes prevention. If you would like to attend on Saturday, April
12th, please give my Memphis office a call at 544.4131 to RSVP. I hope
you can join us next weekend.
Ensuring Memphians Get the Tax Refunds They Deserve
April 15th - the deadline to file your 2013 federal tax return - is
less than 2 weeks away. As you prepare your return, I hope you won't
overlook the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) if you are eligible for
it. It is an important credit that can give families a financial boost.
But historically, eligible taxpayers in Memphis and Shelby County have
not taken full advantage of the program. Last year alone, as much as
$70 million in potential tax credits were left on the table by area
taxpayers.
If you have not yet filed your 2010 federal tax return and are owed a
refund, the April 15th deadline is also your last chance to claim that
refund. If the federal government owes you a refund from 2010, there is
no penalty for filing a late return for that year. According to the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS), nearly $13 million in unpaid refunds is
owed to more than 16,000 taxpayers across Tennessee, but you must file
by April 15th in order to collect those funds or they will be forfeited.
Memphians shouldn't pay more than they owe, and they should receive
every penny they deserve in refunds. This year, I helped open one of 15
new Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) sites that are now operating
throughout Shelby County.
The VITA sites are available to provide tax
return guidance and advice free of charge to ensure that Memphians take
full advantage of programs like the EITC and get the tax refund they
are entitled to. More information including a list of all VITA
locations and their hours is available at my website
, and I encourage you to find one near you to help ensure you
get every penny you are owed.
Fighting for the Unemployed
Yesterday, the Senate took another step towards passing a bill to
extend unemployment insurance to Americans whose benefits expired at
the end of the year because of Republican obstruction. I'm glad that
some in Congress have finally recognized the urgent need to pass this
legislation, but I remain very disappointed that Speaker John Boehner
has indicated that he won't even let the House vote on it when the
Senate sends it to us.
Speaker Boehner shouldn't make millions of out-of-work Americans-
including more than 31,000 Tennesseans-wait another day for the
unemployment benefits they need to keep a roof over their heads and put
food on their tables. He should stop obstructing the Senate's
bipartisan bill and immediately let the House vote to extend this
critical lifeline to people who have lost their jobs through no fault
of their own.
Remembering the Late, Great Isaac Hayes
On Wednesday, legendary Memphian Isaac Hayes' Billboard chart-topping
"Shaft" soundtrack was inducted into the Library of Congress National
Recording Registry
. The registry preserves sound recordings as cultural, artistic
and/or historical treasures that represent the richness and diversity
of our nation's soundscape.
In helping calm frayed nerves in both Watts and Memphis after the riots
of the 1960s and in so many other ways, Isaac Hayes served as an iconic
role model for young African American males. Isaac departed much too
soon but his induction into the National Recording Registry underlines
the remarkable legacy he left behind. His contributions to the artistic
community, his years at the legendary Stax Records, and his appearance
at Wattstax will not be forgotten. He was a dear friend and supporter,
and I miss him profoundly-and I am glad that his work will be preserved.
Supporting Memphians and Promoting International Trade
This week, Memphian Anthony "Amp" Elmore met with South African
Ambassador to the United States Ebrahim Rasool to discuss his proposal
to launch a cultural and economic exchange between the African nation
and the city of Memphis. Amp's proposed exchange would link our unique
histories and our fights for equality, led here in America by Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr. and in South African by former South African
President, His Excellency Nelson Mandela. He has also proposed creating
a trade relationship between our city and South Africa that would make
Memphis the main American hub for imports from the country.
Amp's proposal is an exciting opportunity for both Memphis and for
South Africa that will help grow both economies as well as strengthen
cultural ties between our countries, and I am happy to support his
efforts to foster what could be an important partnership.
Protecting Animals From Abuse
This week, I received another "Humane Champion" award from the Humane
Society for my perfect voting record in 2013. Not only do I have more
of these annual awards than anyone else in Tennessee's Congressional
Delegation, but the Humane Society also gave me extra credit for
sponsoring the Prevent All Soring Tactics (PAST) Act
, which would end an abusive practice used by some horse
trainers.
It is a privilege and an honor to be recognized for my long record of
protecting animal welfare and preventing abuse. Our treatment of
animals is a reflection of how we treat ourselves and each other, and I
believe that we must do all that we can to do better on each front.
Another Republican Budget Proposal That Hurts the Middle Class
On Tuesday morning, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan released
his 2015 Republican budget proposal. I'm not surprised that he chose
Tuesday, April 1st to do it-as his proposal certainly looks like a
cruel April Fools' joke being played on the American people. The Ryan
plan-with its gimmicks, fuzzy math, and loopholes-keeps the deck
stacked against hardworking Memphians who deserve a fair shot at the
American Dream. It takes away the health care security provided by
President Obama's landmark Affordable Care Act, kills jobs, ends
Medicare as we know it and hurts seniors, slashes food stamps and NIH
medical research programs, makes college harder to afford, and raises
taxes on middle-class families to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy.
The Progressive Democrats' "Better Off Budget
"
is a more effective approach for Memphis and for all of America. Our
plan would create more than 8 million jobs, cut the deficit by more
than $4 trillion dollars, restore unemployment insurance that
out-of-work Americans rely on to keep a roof over their heads and food
on their tables, reverse harmful cuts that hit middle-class families
the hardest, and help give Memphians who work hard and play by the
rules a fair shot at success. It's a plan that will build a strong,
lasting economy that works for everyone, not just a select few.
Putting Even More Money into Politics
At a time when more and more Big Money is flowing into politics to sway
elections, the Supreme Court this week decided that allowing even more
money into our elections is the right way to move forward. After
opening the floodgates with their "Citizens United" ruling, with this
week's decision the Supreme Court breached the remaining levees
protecting the voices of middle class Americans from being completely
drowned out of the political process by the ultra-wealthy.
This ruling-which gives even more power and influence to Big Money-once
again underscores just how urgently Congress must pass meaningful
campaign finance reform to put the 'People's House' back where it
should be: in the hands of the American people. The Government by the
People Act
will give every citizen a fair shot at participating in our
government along with the confidence in democracy that they deserve and
expect, and I will work with my colleagues to pass it.
Helping St. Jude
This morning, I announced more than $330,000 in federal funding to St.
Jude Children's Research Hospital to help research a compound
discovered at the hospital that could help reverse resistance to cancer
drugs. I'm glad that St. Jude, one of the world's finest health care
institutions, will be able to conduct this important research.
Make Sure to Claim Unclaimed Property
The State of Tennessee maintains a searchable database of unclaimed
property, which can include bank accounts, stocks and dividends, wages,
refunds, insurance payments, gift certificates, credit balances and
overpayments, and a number of other things. There is no cost for
accessing the database, and you may find that you are owed money or
property. If you have not searched the database yet or if you haven't
searched in a while, you can visit https://www.claimittn.gov
and see for yourself whether the state is holding any
property or assets for you. And you may pass this information along to
your friends and family as well!
VA Rolls Out Secure Veteran Health ID Cards
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) recently announced the phased
roll out of newly designed, more secure Veteran Health Identification
Cards. The new cards are distinguished by additional security features
and will have a different look and feel.
Similar to a typical health insurance card, the VHIC displays the
veteran's Member ID, a new unique identifier, as well as a Plan ID,
reflecting the veteran's enrollment in VA health care. The card
replaces the Veteran Identification Card (VIC), which was introduced in
2004. As part of a phased rollout, the card will only be offered to
newly enrolled and other veterans who have not been issued a VIC. In
early April, the VA will begin a three month effort to automatically
issue the more secure VHIC to current VIC cardholders. The VA
recommends veterans safeguard their VIC as they would a credit card,
and cut up or shred the card once it is replaced. While not required to
receive VA health care, all enrolled Veterans are encouraged to get a
VHIC.
Enrolled veterans can get more information about the VHIC by visiting
their VA medical facility enrollment coordinator or the website
www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhic
, calling 1-877-222-VETS (8387) or visiting their
local VA health care facility. Veterans who are not enrolled in the VA
health care system can apply for enrollment at any time by visiting
www.va.gov/healthbenefits
, calling 1-877-222-VETS (8387) or visiting their local
VA health care facility.
As always, I remain.
Most sincerely,

This
morning,
I
went
to
the
floor
of
the
United
States
House
of
Representatives
to
pay
tribute
to
the
life
of
Dr.
Martin
Luther
King,
Jr.
and
commemorate
the
46th
anniversary
of
his
assassination
at
the
Lorraine
Motel.
Reverend
King
was
killed
while
standing
up
for
economic
justice
including
fair
wages
and
the
right
to
organize.
Sadly,
for
too
many
Memphians
and
Americans,
economic
justice
remains
a
dream
unfulfilled.
I
will
continue
fighting
for
fairness
and
justice
in
Congress.
You
can
watch
my
speech
here .
Tonight,
I
will
also
speak
at
the
April
4 th
Foundation&#8217;s
2014
Gala,
where
Dr.
C.T.
Vivian
will
give
the
keynote
and
receive
this
year&#8217;s
&#8220;I
Am
A
Man&#8221;
award.
The
award
is
presented
each
year
to
individuals
who
continue
to
strive
to
keep
Dr.
King&#8217;s
dream
alive
and
make
it
a
reality,
something
that
Dr.
Vivian,
a
Presidential
Medal
of
Freedom
recipient,
has
spent
his
life
doing.
I
look
forward
to
the
Gala
as
well
as
seeing
Congresswoman
Barbara
Lee
and
Bobby
Seale
there
this
evening.
Tomorrow,
the
National
Civil
Rights
Museum
at
the
Lorraine
Motel
will
reopen
after
its
renovation.
The
New

Times
this
week
described
the
newly
rebuilt
museum
as
&#8220;setting
a
standard
for
museums
exploring
civil

I
will
speak
at
the
official
opening
ceremony
tomorrow
morning
about
the
changes
made
during
the
renovations
and
the
museum&#8217;s
importance
to
our
city
and
to
our
country.
I
hope
you
will
visit
the

to
see
the
changes
for
yourself.

Building
a
Healthier
Memphis
The
open
enrollment
period
for
2014
health
coverage
through
the
Affordable
Care
Act&#8217;s
marketplaces
ended
on
Monday,
and
more
than
7
million
Americans
enrolled
in
high-quality,
affordable
coverage
before
the
deadline.
With
so
many
Americans
now
enrolled
in
coverage
through
marketplaces
like
HealthCare.gov ,
President
Obama
is
right
when
he
says
&#8220; the
Affordable
Care
Act
is
here
to
stay. &#8221;
The
Affordable
Care
Act
is
already
helping
millions
of
Americans
get
covered
and
get
the
care
they
need,
but
we
can
do
more.
Last
month,
I
launched
my
&#8220;Building
a
Healthier
Memphis&#8221;
series
on
wellness
in
the
Ninth
District
with
a
panel
discussion
and
education
session
focused
on
the
racial
disparities
in
breast
cancer
outcomes
in
Memphis.
During
the
panel&#8212;which
drew
an
overflow
crowd&#8212;experts
discussed
the
reasons
for
the
current
outcome
gap
and
helped
identify
how
Memphians
can
take
advantage
of
provisions
of
the
President&#8217;s
Affordable
Care
Act
that
include
no
co-pay
and
no
deductible
mammograms
to
address
the
disparity
and
improve
outcomes
for
themselves,
their
families,
and
their
communities.
I
was
encouraged
that
so
many
Memphians
attended
the
panel
and
education
session
to
learn
how
they
can
improve
their
own
health
and
the
health
of
their
families
and
communities.
Today,
I
am
glad
to
invite
you
to
the
next
wellness
event
in
my
&#8220;Building
a
Healthier
Memphis&#8221;
series.
It
will
be
held
at
10:00AM
on
Saturday,
April
12th
at
Church
Health
Center
Wellness
located
at
1115
Union
Avenue.
This
next
event
will
focus
on
how
our
community
can
work
together
to
stem
the
rising
tide
of
diabetes
diagnoses
in
Memphis
and
will
include
a
number
of
local
experts
on
diabetes
prevention
as
well
as
Dr.
Ann
Albright,
the
United
States
Centers
for
Disease
Control
Director
of
diabetes
prevention.
If
you
would
like
to
attend
on
Saturday,
April
12th,
please
give
my
Memphis
office
a
call
at
544.4131
to
RSVP.
I
hope
you
can
join
us
next
weekend.
Ensuring
Memphians
Get
the
Tax
Refunds
They
Deserve
April
15th
&#8211;
the
deadline
to
file
your
2013
federal
tax
return
&#8211;
is
less
than
2
weeks
away.
As
you
prepare
your
return,
I
hope
you
won&#8217;t
overlook
the
Earned
Income
Tax
Credit
(EITC)
if
you
are
eligible
for
it.
It
is
an
important
credit
that
can
give
families
a
financial
boost.
But
historically,
eligible
taxpayers
in
Memphis
and
Shelby
County
have
not
taken
full
advantage
of
the
program.
Last
year
alone,
as
much
as
$70
million
in
potential
tax
credits
were
left
on
the
table
by
area
taxpayers.
If
you
have
not
yet
filed
your
2010
federal
tax
return
and
are
owed
a
refund,
the
April
15th
deadline
is
also
your
last
chance
to
claim
that
refund.
If
the
federal
government
owes
you
a
refund
from
2010,
there
is
no
penalty
for
filing
a
late
return
for
that
year.
According
to
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
(IRS),
nearly
$13
million
in
unpaid
refunds
is
owed
to
more
than
16,000
taxpayers
across
Tennessee,
but
you
must
file
by
April
15th
in
order
to
collect
those
funds
or
they
will
be
forfeited.
Memphians
shouldn&#8217;t
pay
more
than
they
owe,
and
they
should
receive
every
penny
they
deserve
in
refunds.
This
year,
I
helped
open
one
of
15
new
Volunteer
Income
Tax
Assistance
(VITA)
sites
that
are
now
operating
throughout
Shelby
County.
The
VITA
sites
are
available
to
provide
tax
return
guidance
and
advice
free
of
charge
to
ensure
that
Memphians
take
full
advantage
of
programs
like
the
EITC
and
get
the
tax
refund
they
are
entitled
to.
More
information
including
a
list
of
all
VITA
locations
and
their
hours
is
available
at
my
website ,
and
I
encourage
you
to
find
one
near
you
to
help
ensure
you
get
every
penny
you
are
owed.
Fighting
for
the
Unemployed
Yesterday,
the
Senate
took
another
step
towards
passing
a
bill
to
extend
unemployment
insurance
to
Americans
whose
benefits
expired
at
the
end
of
the
year
because
of
Republican
obstruction.
I&#8217;m
glad
that
some
in
Congress
have
finally
recognized
the
urgent
need
to
pass
this
legislation,
but
I
remain
very
disappointed
that
Speaker
John
Boehner
has
indicated
that
he
won&#8217;t
even
let
the
House
vote
on
it
when
the
Senate
sends
it
to
us.
Speaker
Boehner
shouldn&#8217;t
make
millions
of
out-of-work
Americans&#8212;including
more
than
31,000
Tennesseans&#8212;wait
another
day
for
the
unemployment
benefits
they
need
to
keep
a
roof
over
their
heads
and
put
food
on
their
tables.
He
should
stop
obstructing
the
Senate&#8217;s
bipartisan
bill
and
immediately
let
the
House
vote
to
extend
this
critical
lifeline
to
people
who
have
lost
their
jobs
through
no
fault
of
their
own.
Remembering
the
Late,
Great
Isaac
Hayes
On
Wednesday,
legendary
Memphian
Isaac
Hayes&#8217;
Billboard
chart-topping
&#8220;Shaft&#8221;
soundtrack
was
inducted
into
the
Library
of
Congress
National
Recording
Registry .
The
registry
preserves
sound
recordings
as
cultural,
artistic
and/or
historical
treasures
that
represent
the
richness
and
diversity
of
our
nation&#8217;s
soundscape.
In
helping
calm
frayed
nerves
in
both
Watts
and
Memphis
after
the
riots
of
the
1960s
and
in
so
many
other
ways,
Isaac
Hayes
served
as
an
iconic
role
model
for
young
African
American
males.
Isaac
departed
much
too
soon
but
his
induction
into
the
National
Recording
Registry
underlines
the
remarkable
legacy
he
left
behind.
His
contributions
to
the
artistic
community,
his
years
at
the
legendary
Stax
Records,
and
his
appearance
at
Wattstax
will
not
be
forgotten.
He
was
a
dear
friend
and
supporter,
and
I
miss
him
profoundly&#8212;and
I
am
glad
that
his
work
will
be
preserved.
Supporting
Memphians
and
Promoting
International
Trade
This
week,
Memphian
Anthony
&#8220;Amp&#8221;
Elmore
met
with
South
African
Ambassador
to
the
United
States
Ebrahim
Rasool
to
discuss
his
proposal
to
launch
a
cultural
and
economic
exchange
between
the
African
nation
and
the
city
of
Memphis.
Amp&#8217;s
proposed
exchange
would
link
our
unique
histories
and
our
fights
for
equality,
led
here
in
America
by
Dr.
Martin
Luther
King,
Jr.
and
in
South
African
by
former
South
African
President,
His
Excellency
Nelson
Mandela. He
has
also
proposed
creating
a
trade
relationship
between
our
city
and
South
Africa
that
would
make
Memphis
the
main
American
hub
for
imports
from
the
country.
Amp&#8217;s
proposal
is
an
exciting
opportunity
for
both
Memphis
and
for
South
Africa
that
will
help
grow
both
economies
as
well
as
strengthen
cultural
ties
between
our
countries,
and
I
am
happy
to
support
his
efforts
to
foster
what
could
be
an
important
partnership.
Protecting
Animals
From
Abuse
This
week,
I
received
another
&#8220;Humane
Champion&#8221;
award
from
the
Humane
Society
for
my
perfect
voting
record
in
2013.
Not
only
do
I
have
more
of
these
annual
awards
than
anyone
else
in
Tennessee&#8217;s
Congressional
Delegation,
but
the
Humane
Society
also
gave
me
extra
credit
for
sponsoring
the
Prevent
All
Soring
Tactics
(PAST)
Act ,
which
would
end
an
abusive
practice
used
by
some
horse
trainers.
It
is
a
privilege
and
an
honor
to
be
recognized
for
my
long
record
of
protecting
animal
welfare
and
preventing
abuse.
Our
treatment
of
animals
is
a
reflection
of
how
we
treat
ourselves
and
each
other,
and
I
believe
that
we
must
do
all
that
we
can
to
do
better
on
each
front.
Another
Republican
Budget
Proposal
That
Hurts
the
Middle
Class
On
Tuesday
morning,
House
Budget
Committee
Chairman
Paul
Ryan
released
his
2015
Republican
budget
proposal.
I&#8217;m
not
surprised
that
he
chose
Tuesday,
April
1 st
to
do
it&#8212;as
his
proposal
certainly
looks
like
a
cruel
April
Fools&#8217;
joke
being
played
on
the
American
people.
The
Ryan
plan&#8212;with
its
gimmicks,
fuzzy
math,
and
loopholes&#8212;keeps
the
deck
stacked
against
hardworking
Memphians
who
deserve
a
fair
shot
at
the
American
Dream.
It
takes
away
the
health
care
security
provided
by
President
Obama&#8217;s
landmark
Affordable
Care
Act,
kills
jobs,
ends
Medicare
as
we
know
it
and
hurts
seniors,
slashes
food
stamps
and
NIH
medical
research
programs,
makes
college
harder
to
afford,
and
raises
taxes
on
middle-class
families
to
pay
for
tax
cuts
for
the
wealthy.
The
Progressive
Democrats&#8217;
&#8220; Better
Off
Budget &#8221;
is
a
more
effective
approach
for
Memphis
and
for
all
of
America.
Our
plan
would
create
more
than
8
million
jobs,
cut
the
deficit
by
more
than
$4
trillion
dollars,
restore
unemployment
insurance
that
out-of-work
Americans
rely
on
to
keep
a
roof
over
their
heads
and
food
on
their
tables,
reverse
harmful
cuts
that
hit
middle-class
families
the
hardest,
and
help
give
Memphians
who
work
hard
and
play
by
the
rules
a
fair
shot
at
success.
It&#8217;s
a
plan
that
will
build
a
strong,
lasting
economy
that
works
for
everyone,
not
just
a
select
few.
Putting
Even
More
Money
into
Politics
At
a
time
when
more
and
more
Big
Money
is
flowing
into
politics
to
sway
elections,
the
Supreme
Court
this
week
decided
that
allowing
even
more
money
into
our
elections
is
the
right
way
to
move
forward.
After
opening
the
floodgates
with
their
&#8220;Citizens
United&#8221;
ruling,
with
this
week&#8217;s
decision
the
Supreme
Court
breached
the
remaining
levees
protecting
the
voices
of
middle
class
Americans
from
being
completely
drowned
out
of
the
political
process
by
the
ultra-wealthy.
This
ruling&#8212;which
gives
even
more
power
and
influence
to
Big
Money&#8212;once
again
underscores
just
how
urgently
Congress
must
pass
meaningful
campaign
finance
reform
to
put
the
&#8216;People&#8217;s
House&#8217;
back
where
it
should
be:
in
the
hands
of
the
American
people.
The
Government
by
the
People
Act
will
give
every
citizen
a
fair
shot
at
participating
in
our
government
along
with
the
confidence
in
democracy
that
they
deserve
and
expect,
and
I
will
work
with
my
colleagues
to
pass
it.
Helping
St.
Jude
This
morning,
I
announced
more
than
$330,000
in
federal
funding
to
St.
Jude
Children&#8217;s
Research
Hospital
to
help
research
a
compound
discovered
at
the
hospital
that
could
help
reverse
resistance
to
cancer
drugs.
I&#8217;m
glad
that
St.
Jude,
one
of
the
world&#8217;s
finest
health
care
institutions,
will
be
able
to
conduct
this
important
research.
Make
Sure
to
Claim
Unclaimed
Property
The
State
of
Tennessee
maintains
a
searchable
database
of
unclaimed
property,
which
can
include
bank
accounts,
stocks
and
dividends,
wages,
refunds,
insurance
payments,
gift
certificates,
credit
balances
and
overpayments,
and
a
number
of
other
things.
There
is
no
cost
for
accessing
the
database,
and
you
may
find
that
you
are
owed
money
or
property.
If
you
have
not
searched
the
database
yet
or
if
you
haven&#8217;t
searched
in
a
while,
you
can
visit
https://www.claimittn.gov
and
see
for
yourself
whether
the
state
is
holding
any
property
or
assets
for
you.
And
you
may
pass
this
information
along
to
your
friends
and
family
as
well!
VA
Rolls
Out
Secure
Veteran
Health
ID
Cards
The
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
recently
announced
the
phased
roll
out
of
newly
designed,
more
secure
Veteran
Health
Identification
Cards.
The
new
cards
are
distinguished
by
additional
security
features
and
will
have
a
different
look
and
feel.
Similar
to
a
typical
health
insurance
card,
the
VHIC
displays
the
veteran&#8217;s
Member
ID,
a
new
unique
identifier,
as
well
as
a
Plan
ID,
reflecting
the
veteran&#8217;s
enrollment
in
VA
health
care.
The
card
replaces
the
Veteran
Identification
Card
(VIC),
which
was
introduced
in
2004.
As
part
of
a
phased
rollout,
the
card
will
only
be
offered
to
newly
enrolled
and
other
veterans
who
have
not
been
issued
a
VIC.
In
early
April,
the
VA
will
begin
a
three
month
effort
to
automatically
issue
the
more
secure
VHIC
to
current
VIC
cardholders.
The
VA
recommends
veterans
safeguard
their
VIC
as
they
would
a
credit
card,
and
cut
up
or
shred
the
card
once
it
is
replaced.
While
not
required
to
receive
VA
health
care,
all
enrolled
Veterans
are
encouraged
to
get
a
VHIC.
Enrolled
veterans
can
get
more
information
about
the
VHIC
by
visiting
their
VA
medical
facility
enrollment
coordinator
or
the
website
www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhic ,
calling
1-877-222-VETS
(8387)
or
visiting
their
local
VA
health
care
facility.
Veterans
who
are
not
enrolled
in
the
VA
health
care
system
can
apply
for
enrollment
at
any
time
by
visiting
www.va.gov/healthbenefits ,
calling
1-877-222-VETS
(8387)
or
visiting
their
local
VA
health
care
facility.
As
always,
I
remain.

sincerely,
