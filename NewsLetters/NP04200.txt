Congressman Lamborn's Commemorative World War I Legislation
Passes the House
12/2/14
Today, the House passed my
legislation H.R. 2366, the World War I American Veteran's Centennial
Commemorative Coin Act, by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 418 to
3.
"To honor their service
and sacrifices, Congress created the World War I Centennial
Commission in 2013 and tasked them with planning and executing activities to
commemorate the centennial of World War I through the use of private
donations and coin sales. By requiring the Secretary of the Treasury to
mint coins to commemorate the centennial, this bill would allow us to
honor the memory, service and sacrifice of the brave veterans of World
War I, while providing the means to pay tribute to the end of World
War I battlefield hostilities. Other great conflicts, including the
Civil War, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War, have all
been memorialized on United States commemorative coins, but no such honor
has been extended to the brave veterans of World War I. This year,
2014, is the 100th anniversary of the start of World War I, making it
very fitting that we pass this measure this year."
