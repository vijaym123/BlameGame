Dear
Friends,
It is important to me to keep you informed
about the work I am doing in Washington on behalf of the residents of the
1st District.
Unfortunately, after March 26th, I will be
prohibited by law from e-mailing you until after the June 24th primary
election unless you have indicated that you would like to receive updates
from me.
If you would like to continue to receive updates,
please subscribe to my e-newsletter by clicking the link below.
You can also indicate policy areas that are of particular interest to
you so that you can stay up to date on those issues you care most
about.
Thank you for taking the time to read this email.
I
hope you will subscribe so that we can continue to stay in
touch.
Sincerely,
Congressman Tim Bishop
First District of New
York
