A Minute with Mike - April, 2014
Dear Friend,
I was proud to advance legislation in a range of areas during April. I
introduced two bills: the Freedom of Faith Act, which will help defend
the principles of religious diversity; and the Climate Change Education
Act of 2014, which will support a knowledgeable debate about how to
tackle the impact of human-made climate change. You can read more about
both bills below.
In my role as a senior Member of the House Appropriations Committee, I
personally fought for important provisions that were included in the
Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations bill, such as:
DNA Rape Kit Backlog - The bill includes language regarding the
implementation of Rapid DNA in order to address the backlog in rape kit
testing. This language will be greatly beneficial in advancing the use
of this technology, and help promote efforts by law enforcement
officials, such as Alameda County District Attorney O'Malley, to make
the use of DNA technology more efficient.
Combating Human Trafficking - I secured over $45 million for
Victim Services Grants, which will help support services to victims of
trafficking, as well as help train those who provide services to
victims. With the upcoming Super Bowl in Santa Clara, a victim-centered
approach to combating human trafficking is a key priority of Santa
Clara County.
Domestic Manufacturing - I secured language giving guidance to
the Department of Commerce about the types of work that it should
support with advanced manufacturing funding, in order to get the best
return on investment. This will help ensure that the semiconductor
manufacturing equipment industry, an important sector of Silicon
Valley's economy, is a target for National Network for Manufacturing
Innovation funding.
I know that these items will advance the best interests of all the
residents of Silicon Valley.
As always, it is an honor to represent Santa Clara and Alameda Counties
in Congress. I hope that the start of Spring, marked by Easter and
Passover, was a time of renewal for you and your family. As always,
feel free to reach out to me by email at any time, and to follow me on
social media for the most up-to-date information on my work in Congress.
Sincerely,
Mike Honda
Member of Congress

Freedom of Faith Act
Introducing my Freedom of Faith Act
My Silicon Valley district is home to a wealth of faiths that
contribute to its special character. To promote this diversity, I was
proud to introduce the Freedom of Faith Act (FOFA). This bill will make
permanent the special immigrant provision for non-minister religious
workers.
For over two decades, Congress has reauthorized this program multiple
times, but the current religious workers program is set to expire in
2015. I believe that it is time we do what's right for our communities
of faith and make permanent this program that allows workers who lead
worship, officiate events, and offer pastoral care to receive temporary
visas like ministers and faith leaders do.

Gold Mouse Award
It is a great honor to win the Gold Mouse Award from the Congressional
Management Foundation for the best Congressional website and social
media! I am proud to be the only Member of Congress to win this award
every year it has been offered, and one of only four to be recognized
for both my website and social media. My goal is to make democracy more
transparent, accountable, and accessible. Read more:

Housing Trust Silicon Valley
At the Housing Trust for Silicon Valley with San Jose Councilmember Ash
Kalra
At the Investor Briefing for the Housing Trust Silicon Valley,
alongside San Jose Councilmember Ash Kalra and the Silicon Valley
Leadership Group, I was happy to speak about the incredible strides
they have made towards preventing and reducing homelessness, expanding
the availability of affordable rental housing, and providing financial
assistance to first-time home buyers. Especially in California's 17th
Congressional District?, the burden of high housing costs carried by
low income and middle class families. I will continue advocating in
Washington for federal assistance to address housing affordability.
Back to top
SOFIA
I was disappointed by NASA's and the Administration's lack of
consultation with the scientific community in proposing to defund the
flagship SOFIA telescope program. If SOFIA is defunded and "mothballed"
at the end of 2014, it would effectively throw away a $1.2 billion
dollar investment by US taxpayers. This is a scientifically unique
program that was fully operational for less than 1 year of a proposed
20-year lifespan. Working with Chairman Frank Wolf and my colleagues on
the Appropriations Committee, I am proud to have worked to restore
funding for this unique observatory. I will continue to work with NASA
Administrator Bolden and my colleagues on the Hill to ensure that
funding is restored to the SOFIA telescope without defunding other
important astrophysics programs. In addition, I will encourage creating
a process of review from the scientific community before budgetary
decisions are made by the Administration to cut programs.
Back to top
Debbie Smith Act
Last month, I voted to renew funding for the Debbie Smith Act. This
landmark legislation creates grants to state and local law enforcement
agencies to conduct DNA analysis of rape kits. The funding stream from
this bill is a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done.
Across the country, there is a shocking backlog of unprocessed rape
kits. That is why I have been working with Alameda DA O'Malley to
secure funding for technology and private labs that will speed up the
process, ensuring that DNA analysis of rape kits is turned around in
time to put sexual assault offenders behind bars. I am proud to say
that I succeeded in this effort, securing language in the Commerce,
Justice, Science Appropriations bill that will streamline this process
and begin reducing the rape kit backlog across the nation.

April,
2014
Dear
Friend,
I
was
proud
to
advance
legislation
in
a
range
of
areas
during
April.
I
introduced
two
bills:
the
Freedom
of
Faith
Act,
which
will
help
defend
the
principles
of
religious
diversity;
and
the
Climate
Change
Education
Act
of
2014,
which
will
support
a
knowledgeable
debate
about
how
to
tackle
the
impact
of
human-made
climate
change.
You
can
read
more
about
both
bills
below.
In
my
role
as
a
senior
Member
of
the
House
Appropriations
Committee,
I
personally
fought
for
important
provisions
that
were
included
in
the
Commerce,
Justice,
and
Science
Appropriations
bill,
such
as:
DNA
Rape
Kit
Backlog
&#8211;
The
bill
includes
language
regarding
the
implementation
of
Rapid
DNA
in
order
to
address
the
backlog
in
rape
kit
testing.
This
language
will
be
greatly
beneficial
in
advancing
the
use
of
this
technology,
and
help
promote
efforts
by
law
enforcement
officials,
such
as
Alameda
County
District
Attorney
O&#8217;Malley,
to
make
the
use
of
DNA
technology
more
efficient.
Combating
Human
Trafficking
&#8211;
I
secured
over
$45
million
for
Victim
Services
Grants,
which
will
help
support
services
to
victims
of
trafficking,
as
well
as
help
train
those
who
provide
services
to
victims.
With
the
upcoming
Super
Bowl
in
Santa
Clara,
a
victim-centered
approach
to
combating
human
trafficking
is
a
key
priority
of
Santa
Clara
County.
Domestic
Manufacturing
&#8211;
I
secured
language
giving
guidance
to
the
Department
of
Commerce
about
the
types
of
work
that
it
should
support
with
advanced
manufacturing
funding,
in
order
to
get
the
best
return
on
investment.
This
will
help
ensure
that
the
semiconductor
manufacturing
equipment
industry,
an
important
sector
of
Silicon
Valley&#8217;s
economy,
is
a
target
for
National
Network
for
Manufacturing
Innovation
funding.
I
know
that
these
items
will
advance
the
best
interests
of
all
the
residents
of
Silicon
Valley.
As
always,
it
is
an
honor
to
represent
Santa
Clara
and
Alameda
Counties
in
Congress.
I
hope
that
the
start
of
Spring,
marked
by
Easter
and
Passover,
was
a
time
of
renewal
for
you
and
your
family.
As
always,
