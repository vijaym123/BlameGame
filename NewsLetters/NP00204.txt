Dear Friend,
This week the House is likely to vote on legislation to enact Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which structures the rules and procedures for Congress to review and vote on new free trade agreements in Asia and Europe. While I am still carefully evaluating this bill, I want to hear from you. Please take a brief moment to answer the following question regarding TPA.
Do you think Congress should pass Trade Promotion Authority which sets certain limits and goals on the Presidents trade negotiations in exchange for an up-or-down vote from Congress?
