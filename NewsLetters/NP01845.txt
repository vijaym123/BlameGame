Say goodbye to the SGR
Dear Friend,
There is no shortage of complex policy acronyms in Washington, but on Thursday, we took a bold step to finally erase one from our vocabulary.
Medicares Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) has plagued seniors, Medicare physicians, and Congress for nearly two decades. The SGR is a flawed formula that places quantity ahead of quality in seniors health care. Its price controls would wreak havoc on Medicare, and Congress finds itself in crisis mode every time the SGR looms. To date, the solution has been to temporarily stave off the cuts just to protect seniors access to their trusted doctors.
This week, however, instead of another temporary reprieve, we put in place a better system
one that promotes higher quality care for seniors while also enacting Medicare reforms to put the program on more sound fiscal footing.
The package that the House advanced by a bipartisan vote of 392-37 will permanently fix the broken Medicare payment formula. It will also strengthen the program in the long term, and extend the Childrens Health Insurance Program, which covers nearly 45,000 children in Michigan (MIChild).
Bottom line: its good for Michigan seniors, kids, and our important community health centers.
This was a long time coming. Most of us came to Congress to fight for our nations kids, seniors, and their families. Thursdays vote was defining moment for this Congress and for Medicare.
