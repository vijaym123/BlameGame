Subcommittee Hearing Delves Into Proposed EPA Regulations
One of my subcommittees, Energy and Power, on Thursday held a hearing
to examine the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed new carbon
dioxide regulations for existing power plants. On June 2, the
administration rolled out the EPA's "Clean Power Plan," a proposed rule
for existing power plants that will force states to change the way they
generate and distribute power.
My fellow subcommittee members and I questioned EPA Acting Assistant
Administrator Janet McCabe about the scope of the EPA's proposal, its
legality and feasibility, and potential impacts on U.S. economic growth
and the global climate.
The proposal sets emissions requirements for each state, but McCabe
repeatedly asserted that states would have "flexibility" in compliance
and stated that the rule was "not an energy plan for the states."
Subcommittee members, however, countered that the rule would force
states to completely redesign their electricity systems with limited
options. The result would be higher energy costs, more job losses, and
impaired electric reliability.
I questioned McCabe about the EPA's assumptions regarding electricity
generation in states and asked what would happen if the EPA did not
approve a state's implementation plan. She replied, "We are not focused
on that right now." Watch the full exchange by clicking on the picture

It's Dairy Month: June is Dairy Month, an annual tradition celebrating
the dairy industry and its contributions to our society that began
during the Great Depression in 1937. It was established to help
stabilize dairy demand during periods of peak production when cows were
turned out to pasture. Today, cows in the 15th Congressional District's
Clinton County produce more milk than any other county in the state of
Illinois. Learn more about Dairy Month from the Midwest Dairy
Association
