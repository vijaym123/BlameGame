Do you believe that Attorney General Eric Holder should be impeached?
If you do, I NEED YOUR HELP.
As long as Eric Holder continues to lead the Justice Department,
corrupt administration officials like Lois Lerner will never be
prosecuted for their wrongdoings. It is beyond clear the attorney
general is more concerned about protecting President Obama than seeking
justice.
I have co-introduced Articles of Impeachment for Attorney General Eric
Holder
, but I need your help to get them to the House floor. Right now we
have 27 cosponsors - we need more.
Here is the list of those Members of Congress who are already
cosponsors
.
If your representative is not listed, please contact them and tell them
to cosponsor H.Res.411. If your family or friend's representative is
not listed, have them contact their representative.
You can also help by sharing this post on your Facebook page
to help build
grassroots support.
It is time for action. Removing Attorney General Eric Holder from
office is the first step to restoring accountability in government.
Thank you for your help.
Representative Scott DesJarlais, M.D.
