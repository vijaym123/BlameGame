The Republicans running for President in 2016 are a MESS -- they have ZERO good candidates!
Friend -- When we needed you, you&rsquo;ve been there for Democrats -- and we can&rsquo;t tell you how much we appreciate that.
But we just saw that your DSCC membership expired at the end of 2014 and you haven&rsquo;t renewed (your record below). We
really
need you in this moment.
DSCC Membership Status:
expired
2015 Membership Rate:
$5
(renew membership now)
Here&rsquo;s why we need you right now:
The Republicans running for President in 2016 are a MESS --
they have ZERO good candidates!
And, the Senate map STRONGLY favors Democrats.
BUT:
NPR
reports that the Koch brothers&rsquo; money machine is already gearing up, which could be a DISASTER for us.
If we let the Republicans beat us in the early money game, they could wipe out our advantage --
we&rsquo;d lose our chance to win the Senate AND the White House.
But if 50,000 Democrats pitch in before the FEC deadline in just 72 hours, we&rsquo;ll stay ahead and win.
Will you renew your DSCC membership by the first FEC deadline of 2015 in 72 hours?
