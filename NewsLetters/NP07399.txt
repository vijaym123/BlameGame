Dear Friend,
Our constitution was written and
our government designed so that one person cannot force his or her
will on the entire country.
President Obama has exceeded every limit of his power to do
just that.
On
Wednesday the House voted to authorize a
lawsuit
against President Obama for his consistent overreach of
power.
Remember
all those times
he
changed the effective-date and the requirements for his own healthcare
law?
He acted without Congress, and that's not right.
This lawsuit is far from
frivolous or unnecessaryit has precedent and it is one of the
clearest actions of accountability at our disposal now.
To assert the
authority of Congress is to assert the authority of the people
Congress directly represents.
As always, I want to know what you think.
You can let me
know
here .
Sincerely,
Doug
Collins
Member of Congress
P.S. I'm having
town hall meetings around the district in August and I hope to see you
there!
Here's the
schedule .
We'll be sending out reminders
soon!
