The Supreme Court's fateful decision in
Citizens United v. FEC
allowed right-wing special interests to buy the 2014 elections.
We can't let corporations buy American democracy. Sign your name to demand Congress overturn

David -- Citizens United
opened the door for Republican special interests to spend millions to influence last year&rsquo;s elections.
Now, they're gearing up to spend as much as $1 BILLION to keep their hold on Congress -- and buy the White House -- in 2016. That&rsquo;s
unprecedented .
Cheri believes Illinois voters should decide our elections -- not out-of-state billionaires. But if we&rsquo;re going to bring an end to
Citizens United , it&rsquo;ll take a tremendous grassroots effort. PETITION: Demand Republicans in Congress overturn Citizens United &gt;&gt; Americans are sick and tired of special interests interfering in our elections.
But ending
Citizens United
won't be easy... If we're going to force Congress to act, we need a groundswell of grassroots supporters with us.
