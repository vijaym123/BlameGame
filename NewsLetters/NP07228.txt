As your Congressman, I routinely send out email newsletters to keep you informed on my work in Washington and throughout the Treasure Coast and Palm Beaches. These newsletters cover a wide variety of topics, ranging from district events to legislative updates.
I am writing to let you know that, due to U.S. House rules concerning communication before elections, there will be an upcoming blackout period. During this period, I will be limited in ways I can communicate with you.
In order to stay up to date on important information, including my work on your behalf and important issues like the Indian River Lagoon, All Aboard Florida, cutting wasteful spending, and growing the economy as well as getting your thoughts through important surveys, I encourage you to sign up and opt-in to receive my e-mails by
midnight Wednesday, August 6, 2014 . By opting-in, you will be able to continue receiving my e-newsletter updates even during this blackout periods. Please know that if you opt-in to receive emails, you can opt-out at any time.
