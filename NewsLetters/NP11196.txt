Rep. Bruce Braley -- Iowa's First
District
David,
Father of the Green Revolution. The Man Who Saved a Billion Lives.
Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient.
Norman Borlaug was not only a great scientist who revolutionized modern
agriculture as we know it and saved millions of lives as a result. He
was also a great Iowan from Howard County.
So it was with honor that I joined my friends and fellow colleagues
from Iowa in unveiling a new statue of Norman Borlaug that will stand
in the US Capitol alongside such great Americans as George Washington,
Helen Keller, and Rosa Parks.
Take a moment to watch my brief remarks during the ceremony this week:

Norman Borlaug's contributions to society were enormous and are still
seen today. His tireless work crossbreeding thousands of varieties of
wheat resulted in an explosion of disease-resistant and high-yielding
crops which improved lives around the world and saved millions from
hunger and starvation.

As Norman Borlaug would remind us, the reward for our labors is not
what we take from this planet -- it's what we give back.
All the best,
Bruce
