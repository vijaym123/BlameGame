We&rsquo;ve had a record-breaking month so far -- people have clicked and donated -- and we&rsquo;re seeing the results in poll after poll: Democrats are surging at exactly the right moment.
Wanted to share these great, breaking stories today, Friend:
Colorado: We&#39;ve erased a 5 point deficit and are now leading by 1: 45-44
Georgia: Michelle Nunn has led in five of the last six polls in Nate Silver&rsquo;s &ldquo;tipping point state&rdquo;
Kentucky: With Alison Grimes tied with Mitch McConnell, we just made a massive new ad buy to win
We&rsquo;ve had a record-breaking month so far -- people have clicked and donated -- and we&rsquo;re seeing the results in poll after poll:
Democrats are surging at exactly the right moment.
But with 10 days left, we know what&rsquo;s coming: an all-out assault from the Koch brothers and Karl Rove. If we get every voter to the polls, we&rsquo;ll negate it.
Our final-week Get Out The Vote deadline hits tomorrow at midnight, and we have a $398,221 hole to fill in the budget -- can you help? Gifts will be triple-matched today to get there.
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
With TEN days to go, nearly a dozen races are still within 5 points. Your gift could be the phone call, ride to the polls or ad that flips a race and saves the Senate.
Please pitch in to help us close out strong &ndash; we&rsquo;re so close!
Thanks for staying in the fight,
Guy
