A More Streamlined
&amp; Efficient Government
Government overreach continues to be a problem under President Obama.
In addition to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) land grab
threatening Missouri property owners and livestock producers, there is
ongoing duplication of federal programs at the Small Business
Administration (SBA).
Last week, the
House Small Business Committee I chair exposed the SBAs experimentation
with unproven programs that will detract from their core services
intended to serve small businesses. The SBA has created several
initiatives - without the consent of Congress - that duplicate existing efforts.
These new programs drain resources from what the SBA has proven
to be successful.
The
Administrations penchant for government growth is predictably not leading to
economic growth.
As announced last Wednesday, the nations
economy has slowed nearly to a standstill, and
grew at a
mere 0.1 percent
rate for last quarter.
Small businesses
dont need new bureaucracy and control; they need the Administration to
get out of the way.
If were going to put more people back to
work and grow the economy, we need a more streamlined and efficient
government to help small businesses.
Sincerely,
Sam Graves
