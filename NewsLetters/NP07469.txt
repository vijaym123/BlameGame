David Johnson Boehner didn&rsquo;t bargain for THIS: Last week, he flew his TOP deputy to Illinois to headline a glitzy fundraiser for Cheri&rsquo;s Tea Party opponent.
Well, since then,
HUNDREDS
of supporters have stepped up!!! As of 4pm, we&rsquo;re only 391 donations away from
7,5OO
online donors for Cheri in 2014. That&rsquo;s fantastic, David! If we break the record before tomorrow&rsquo;s midnight deadline, it&rsquo;ll be a
MAJOR victory
for us, and a
DEVASTATING blow
to Boehner. Sounds
pretty good
to us. Will you do your part?
