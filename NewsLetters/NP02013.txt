Student loan debt is crushing the American dream. Cheri believes every American deserves access to an affordable college education.
That&rsquo;s why she&rsquo;s joining her colleagues in Congress to make college affordable by lowering interest rates for students and allowing them to refinance existing loans.
But if we&rsquo;re going to make this plan a reality, we need you with us.
