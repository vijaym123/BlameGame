House Votes for ACA
Fairness
On Wednesday last week, the House passed
H.R. 4118 , the
SIMPLE Fairness Act , by a vote of
250-160 . The
SIMPLE Fairness Act was introduced by my Kansas colleague, Rep. Lynn
Jenkins, and would delay for one year the implementation of the penalty
tax for failing to comply with the individual health insurance mandate.
I voted " Yes " on this
bill.
On the same day, President Obama granted another delay in
the Affordable Care Act - giving insurance companies the ability to
continue selling and providing insurance plans that do not fulfill the
ACA's standards until 2016. The unilateral delay eliminates the chance
that insurance companies would again send millions of Americans
cancellation notices similar to what we've seen over the past few
months.
The president continues to grant
delays and exemptions to the Affordable Care Act, but has yet to grant
the American people the same fair treatment under the law. The House
passed the individual mandate penalty tax delay to again highlight the
need for the American people to be given the same reprieve from
penalties as has already been given to business and special interest
groups.

Celebrating the 10th Anniversary of KU's Dole Institute
I
was honored to speak on the House floor early last week about the
legacy of Kansas native, and Jayhawk, Senator Bob Dole. Senator Dole is a
true public servant in every sense of the word. Last Monday marked
the 10-year anniversary of the
Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics
on the
beautiful University of Kansas West Campus. The mission of the Dole Institute
is to promote political and civic participation as well as civil
discourse in a bi-partisan and balanced
manner.
Thank you
for all your service to Kansas and to our country, Sen. Dole.

floor.
President Releases Budget
Proposal
President Obama finally released the details of his 2015 budget proposal last
week. Its a month overdue, but as the saying goes, its better late
than never.
But in this case, this is a budget that never should
have been released. It is a blueprint that includes more government
spending and higher taxes on
Americans.
This is a budget that is out of touch with an economy that isnt
growing and with a workforce that is simply giving up on finding
employment. We need to get back on the right track, with an agenda that
will keep taxes low, curb out-of-control government spending and create
an atmosphere that will add jobs and opportunities for families in
Kansas.
As your Member of Congress,
Ill continue my work to bring fiscal responsibility back to
Washington because its not too late to save our country.
Johnson County Board of County Commissioners
Thanks to
members of the
Johnson County Board of County
Commissioners
for coming by my office last week to discuss their Johnson
County legislative platform. They were in Washington, DC to participate in
the National Association of Counties legislative conference. We
visited about EPA mandates and storm water treatment, the upcoming highway
bill and transportation needs in Johnson County, as well as mental
health and juvenile justice
collaboration.
It was good to visit about these important Johnson County
issues with Chairman Ed Eilert, Commissioner Jim Allen, Commissioner
Steve Kilka and Deputy County Manager Penny Postoak
Ferguson.
Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee
Hearing
Last week, I attended an
Appropriations Subcommittee
on Agriculture
hearing with the Honorable Phyllis Fong,
Inspector General for the US Department of Agriculture. As part of
the hearing, we discussed the important oversight role the Inspector
Generals office plays within federal agencies. The primary role of the
Inspector General is to preform audits and investigations of their
respective agencies, ultimately referring fraud cases for prosecution and
providing the Administration and Congress with recommendations on how
to make the Department more
efficient.
As Vice Chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee
on Agriculture, these hearings provide me important information to
ensure the Kansas agriculture community has a strong voice on the
Appropriations Committee.
Speaking with AIPAC
Members
I spoke to a group of American Israel Public Affairs
Committee members last week. We discussed how important our alliance
with Israel is for our national security and stability in the world,
the threat of an Iranian nuclear program, and the prospects for the
peace process in Israel.
Thank you
to those who came to Washington, DC from Kansas to focus on these
important issues.
National Kidney Foundation
I enjoyed
speaking with members of the
National Kidney Foundation, Inc.
including Sharon
Lagas, Mark Greene and 3rd District resident Nicole Harr - last week in my
Washington, DC office. We discussed the importance of kidney disease
research and the work being done at the
National Institutes of
Health .
Thank you for your important
advocacy.
University of Kansas Student
Senate
Thanks to several members of the
Student Senate of the University of Kansas
for
stopping by my Washington, DC office to discuss higher education issues,
including student loan rates, the costs of attending college, and job
opportunities and the economic climate for new college
grads.
As a former Student Body President
at the University of Kansas, I enjoyed speaking with these student
leaders about their experiences and encouraged them to remain involved.
Thanks to Student Body President Marcus Tetwiler, Student Body Vice
President Emma Halling, Eric Hurtt, Michael Graham, Marquise Paige and
Morgan Said for their work at KU.
