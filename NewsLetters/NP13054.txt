Congressman
Bill Foster
Representing the 11th District
January 15, 2014
Dear Friend,
On December 28, 2013, 1.3 million people nationwide and over
80,000 in our home of Illinois lost unemployment insurance according to
a report by the Council of Economic Advisers and the Department of
Labor.
Unemployment insurance is
not a hand out, it's a hand up for workers who lost their job, through
no fault of their own, and need a lifeline while they look for
work. In addition to leaving families without a safety net, failing to
extend unemployment insurance is simply bad economic policy. Not only
does unemployment insurance help those struggling to find employment,
it helps our economic recovery by supporting consumer
demand.
I spoke about this important issue on the
floor of the House of Representatives. You can watch the video
here:
Congressman Foster speaks on the floor of the House of
Representatives
on the need to extend
unemployment insurance.
I have heard from hundreds of my
constituents on the need to extend unemployment insurance, including Yvonne,
a mother of 5 in Aurora. While she has worked all her life, she is
now unemployed. Without the support of unemployment insurance, she won't
have the resources to look for work and get her life back on
track.
If Congress doesnt act, the
Council of Economic Advisers and the Department of Labor reported that it
will cost 240,000 jobs nationwide this year, including 13,345 in
Illinois. That is why I joined 48 of my colleagues in sending a letter to
Speaker Boehner calling for an immediate vote in the house to extend
emergency unemployment insurance. We must restore this important
lifeline.

unemployment benefits impacted you? Share your story
