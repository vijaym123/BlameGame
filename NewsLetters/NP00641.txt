Dear
Friends,
As you look forward to spending time with family and
friends celebrating the long weekend and the unofficial start of summer,
I hope you are able take a moment to reflect upon the significance of
Memorial
Day.
Memorial Day is also an
important time for reflection for lawmakers in Washington. I am proud of
the work we've done in the House to help our Veterans so far this
Congress. Legislation like the Hire More Heroes Act and the Ensuring VA
Employee Accountability Act are a couple of examples of efforts we are
making to ensure our Veterans have access to employment opportunities
and quality health care.
I will continue to work in Congress to
ensure that the heroes who are still with us are treated with the
dignity they
deserve.
The freedom that
we enjoy every day in our great country would not be possible were it
not for the service and dedication of the brave men and women in
uniform - and the countless who have given their lives to protect
it.
Attending one of the many Memorial Day
services held across South Louisiana is one way we can honor our fallen
and be reminded of the sacrifices they made for
us.
I hope you have a meaningful Memorial Day
weekend.
Sincerely,
Congressman Garret
Graves
