On Tuesday, I joined nearly 200 members of Congress in calling on
President Obama to exercise his executive authority to ban federal
contractors from engaging in employment discrimination against lesbian,
gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) Americans.
I want to thank Senator Jeff Merkley, Senator Tammy Baldwin, Senator
Tom Harkin, and my colleagues in the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus
for leading the charge on this important issue. Not only must the
President act on this issue, but Congress must also act to pass the
Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) in order to protect all
workers from discrimination in every workplace.

UC Irvine's Medical Center
On Monday, I visited the UC Irvine Medical Center in the City of
Orange. The UC Irvine Medical Center is Orange County's only Academic
Medical Center and a major provider of Tertiary and Quaternary care in
Southern California. During the visit, I had the opportunity to learn
about the health-related issues they deal with and also tour some of
the very special services that they make available to our community,
including the Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, one of only 41
of the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) designated comprehensive
cancer centers in the United States.

Long Beach Rotarians
The Long Beach Rotary, comprised of nearly 300 of Long Beach's business
leaders, is a service organization that works to solve humanitarian
issues on the local, national, and international levels. I had the
pleasure of speaking on Wednesday at their meeting on the Queen Mary.
The topic of discussion: Returning to a government of the people, by
the people, and for the people.
With LB Rotary Club President Kay Cofield and Theresa Brunelli
I spoke a lot about my bill, the Let the People Draw the Lines Act,
which lets the people, not politicians, draw the U.S. House of
Representatives district lines.
My bill empowers the states to create
independent redistricting commissions - much like what we have in
California. If my bill becomes law, political gerrymandering will
finally become a closed chapter in our nation's journey toward a more
perfect democracy.
I also spoke about Congressman John Sarbanes' "The Government by the
People Act," which I have cosponsored. This is a comprehensive campaign
finance reform package designed to combat the influence of concentrated
money in politics, raise civic engagement, and amplify the voices of
everyday Americans - putting the public interest in front of special
interests.
Women's Economic Roundtable
In recognition of National Women's History Month, which spans the month
of March, I hosted an intimate economic roundtable discussion focusing
on the theme of "When Women Succeed, America Succeeds." It was very
inspiring to learn about the many businesses, enterprises, and
organizations that are empowering women in the 47th District.
We now have more women in industries like healthcare, STEM, and
education than ever before.
More women are also leading corporations
and more women are serving in the halls of Congress.
Although women today are breaking barriers across the country, much
more needs to be done. Right now, millions of women are still
struggling for paycheck equality and economic security. For example,
California women in the workforce still only earn 83 cents for every
dollar earned by men. The national average is even lower, at 77 cents
for every dollar earned by men.
While barriers like these still stand in our mothers', sisters' and
daughters' way, I have no doubt that women will continue to make
progress toward full economic equality. And, rest assured, I will not
stop fighting to protect the gains women have made and will continue to
push for equality for all women, because as we've seen throughout
American history: when women succeed, America succeeds.
"How to save the American Dream"
CNN recently published my commentary, co-authored by notable scholar
Michael Shank, on the importance of raising the minimum wage to $10.10
per hour:
"Our country's penchant for income inequality is not
financially sustainable, let alone morally excusable or philosophically
justifiable by economists who claim this to be an inherent part of the
system because societies with greater income inequality consistently
struggle with social and health problems, problems that ultimately end
up costing society even more.
"Why? Because the higher a country's income inequality, the
higher its infant mortality rates, obesity rates, homicide rates,
illiteracy rates, mental illness rates, teenage births, incarceration
rates, drug addiction rates, social immobility and lower life
expectancy."

Big money out of politics
The size of your wallet should not determine the size of your voice in
government. Campaign finance reform is needed to get big money out of
politics.
Last week I joined my colleagues Rep. John Sarbanes and Rep. Beto
O'Rourke to speak on the House floor about how we need to put the
people back in control of elections:

"Hearing"
Congressional committees or subcommittee usually hold hearings, or
forums, to take testimony from invited witnesses and to question them
on their support or opposition to a bill. Legislative hearings may
focus on a specific bill, or bills, or just explore a subject matter in
general to see if Congress should pursue any legislation in a
particular area.

Women&#8217;s
Economic
Roundtable
In
recognition
of
National
Women's
History
Month,
which
spans
the
month
of
March,
I
hosted
an
intimate
economic
roundtable
discussion
focusing
on
the
theme
of
"When
Women
Succeed,
America
Succeeds."
It
was
very
inspiring
to
learn
about
the
many
businesses,
enterprises,
and
organizations
that
are
empowering
women
in
the
47th
District.
We
now
have
more
women
in
industries
like
healthcare,
STEM,
and
education
than
ever
before.
More
women
are
also
leading
corporations
and
more
women
are
serving
in
the
halls
of
Congress.
Although
women
today
are
breaking
barriers
across
the
country,
much
more
needs
to
be
done.
Right
now,
millions
of
women
are
still
struggling
for
paycheck
equality
and
economic
security.
For
example,
California
women
in
the
workforce
still
only
earn
83
cents
for
every
dollar
earned
by
men.
The
national
average
is
even
lower,
at
77
cents
for
every
dollar
earned
by
men.
While
barriers
like
these
still
stand
in
our
mothers&#8217;,
sisters&#8217;
and
daughters&#8217;
way,
I
have
no
doubt
that
women
will
continue
to
make
progress
toward
full
economic
equality.
And,
rest
assured,
I
will
not
stop
fighting
to
protect
the
gains
women
have
made
and
will
continue
to
push
for
equality
for
all
women,
because
as
we&#8217;ve
seen
throughout
American
history:
when
women
succeed,
America
succeeds.
