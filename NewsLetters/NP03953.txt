Friend ,
We have fought hard over the last few months in one of the most closely watched and expensive Congressional races in the country. It was your unwavering commitment and faith that helped us win, and for that, I am grateful.
With the next session of Congress quickly approaching, we still have a lot of legislative work to do.
As your representative, it&#39;s my job to listen to you.

There are a number of important issues Congress needs to address in the next two years -- immigration, jobs and the economy, education, healthcare, and climate change to name a few. It is the job of Congress to tackle the nation&#39;s most difficult problems and, with your help, we can ensure that these issues do not fall by the wayside.
Thank you for engaging with our campaign and sharing your thoughts. It is only with your help that we can move our country forward.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
