Dear Friends,
As 2014 winds to a close, I want to thank you for your support and the
trust you have put in me to serve the people of South Carolina. It is
an honor I take incredibly seriously, and please know that I am working
hard every single day to ensure a brighter future for our state and
nation.
Around South Carolina
I had a great time visiting McCormick, Saluda, Edgefield, Barnwell and
Allendale this week. One of my most favorite things about serving the
people of South Carolina is the opportunity to travel our state and
meet so many folks across all 46 counties.
You can read more about my visit to McCormick High School here
.
Goals for the New Congress
Last week I gave the Weekly Republican Radio Address, and shared some
of our goals for the new Republican Congress.
The new Republican majority in the Senate, alongside the House of
Representatives, will present solutions that work for American
families, and I truly hope the President will join us. We must regain
the trust of the American people and we will do so by immediately
focusing on jobs and the economy.

New Committees
I am excited to join both the Finance and Banking, Housing and Urban
Affairs Committees for the 114th Congress, and to continue my work on
the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Small Business and
Entrepreneurship, and Aging Committees.
These committees will help me serve the people of South Carolina on a
wide variety of issues, and provide a strong foundation to continue my
Growth and Opportunity Agenda focused on job creation, education and
economic growth.
Washington Open House
As the new session of Congress begins in January, we are holding an
open house in our Washington office for all those interested in
visiting for the swearing-in ceremony and start of the 114th Congress.
The Open House will take place Tuesday, January 6, 2015 from
