Kingston Invites High School Juniors to Apply for Service Academies
Washington
- Congressman Jack Kingston (R-GA) reminds students interested in receiving a congressional nomination to one of the U.S. Military Academies that they must submit their completed applications to his office no later than October 1.
Each year Congressman Kingston nominates deserving young men and women to the Service Academies.
The First District has a rich military heritage. We have many qualified students who can carry on that tradition,
said Kingston.
We have the privilege of interviewing and nominating the finest young men and women to the Academies each year.
These are the future leaders that will serve with honor and skill in the United States Armed Forces.
The application periods for the Academies generally begin in April, and now is the time to start working towards admission into these top institutions.
High school juniors interested in attending the United States Air Force Academy, the United States Military Academy, the United States Merchant Marine Academy, or the United States Naval Academy should apply directly with the Academy as soon as possible.
Those students should contact Congressman Kingstons office for a Congressional Nomination Application.
More information and the nomination application can be found on Kingstons website at

or by calling Brooke Childers in his Savannah Office at 912-352-0101.
