Congress Must Recognize Bitcoin As Currency
Try as it might, Congress cannot ignore the innovations opening up the
global economy to small businesses and entrepreneurs. New technologies
offer new opportunities for entrepreneurs and employers, which Congress
must embrace if the United States is to continue to lead the global
economy. In fact, Congress' head-in-the-sand approach threatens to
leave the U.S. behind while the rest of the world moves forward with
economic growth.

Congressman Stockman offers condolences to McCool family
Representative Steve Stockman and his wife Patti want to express their
condolences to the close friends and family of Dan McCool of Pasadena,

McCool faithfully served for years on the Pasadena Police force and in
numerous political arenas for the cause of preserving our
Constitutional republic.
Elected just last week by fellow Republicans
in state Senate District 11 as their committeeman to the State
Republican Executive Committee, many Texans would do well to follow
Dan's model caring enough to get involved to make a personal difference
in our representative form of government.
"Dan will be missed by many and his life should be celebrated," said
Stockman.
This Week In Texas History: Rudder's Rangers Fight With Distinction On
Normandy Beaches
On D-day, in June 1944 James Earl Rudder commanded the Second Ranger
Battalion as it achieved one of the greatest feats of arms of the
Normandy invasion. Rudder, a native of Eden, Texas, had served in the
army in the 1930s, and was recalled to duty during World War II. He
became commander and trainer of the elite Second Ranger Battalion in
1943. On D-Day, Rudder's Rangers stormed the beach at Pointe du Hoc,
and under constant enemy fire, scaled 100-foot cliffs to reach and
destroy German gun batteries. The battalion suffered higher than 50
percent casualties, and Rudder himself was wounded twice. In spite of
this, he and his men helped establish a beachhead for the Allied
forces. In later life, Rudder became president of Texas A&M.; In 1967,
he received the Distinguished Service Medal from President Lyndon
Johnson.

hungry, and looking for good Italian food, Congressman Stockman's staff

Angelo's is a small, family-owned Webster restaurant with
good food and a great atmosphere. In addition to serving traditional

small talk while taking orders.
