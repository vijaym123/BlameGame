My Reaction to the President's State of the Union
Dear Friends,
Tonight the President addressed the nation to provide Congress an update on the state of our union as required by the Constitution.
I was disappointed the President still promotes a bigger and bloated government as the solution to the problems facing our nation. Instead of making promises the American people cant afford, the President has a responsibility to meet our existing commitments. Rather than roll out a new $320 billion tax hike that will hit working families, the President should join us in creating a simpler, cleaner tax code that would help spur job creation and create an environment that helps families, not hurts them.
We need to put Americans ahead of Washington, and that starts in our schools. Over the coming weeks, we will be examining K-12 education law in Congress and I am once again leading the charge to replace No Child Left Behind and restore local control in our classrooms. I invite the President to put principle ahead of politics and work with us to tear down barriers to progress and grant states and districts more freedom to think bigger, innovate, and take the steps necessary to put more children on the right path to a brighter future.
Best wishes,
John Kline
Member of Congress
