David Johnson In less than FOUR DAYS, Boehner&rsquo;s TOP deputy is coming to Illinois to raise money against Cheri. That could be
TERRIBLE NEWS
if we don&rsquo;t have the resources to fight back.
BUT -- since we told you about Boehner&rsquo;s massive fundraiser, you&rsquo;ve stepped up in a HUGE WAY.
Now, we&rsquo;re just
$3,422
away from our grassroots fundraising goal! THAT'S ASTOUNDING!!! If we hit can hit our goal, it&rsquo;ll be a
HUGE
win for Cheri -- and a
DEVASTATING
blow to Boehner&rsquo;s big plans.
We're SO CLOSE. Will
YOU
be the one to put Cheri over the top?
