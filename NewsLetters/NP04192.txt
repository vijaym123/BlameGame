Dear Friends,
As many of you might
already know the open enrollment period has begun for those seeking to sign
up for health insurance. The enrollment period will last until
February 15, 2015. Over the past few months, my congressional offices in the
15th district of Texas have been working in conjunction with many
organizations to offer assistance and guidance on how to enroll and find
the best health care coverage for you and your family.
We
welcome all individuals of all income levels to enroll. The new online
Marketplace provides different plans and rates. It is our goal to
decrease the percentage of uninsured residents of the Hidalgo County, which
is about one third of its residents. The Marketplace has each
individual plan meet the needs of every lifestyle, budget, and most
importantly, most income levels.
On December 31, 2014, all 2014
Marketplace coverage ends, no matter when you enrolled. It is recommended
for you to enroll for coverage before December 15, 2014 if you wish to
start your coverage by January 1, 2015.
Please know that
those who do not enroll by the February 15, 2015 deadline will not be
able to sign up for a health plan inside or outside the Marketplace for
the rest of 2015 and will be penalized monetarily on their 2016
income tax. The only exception for the missed deadline is if you qualify
for a Special Enrollment Period.
Uninsured customers can fill
out a Marketplace application that will tell you if you qualify for a
private health insurance, which has plans that cover essential health
benefits, pre-existing conditions, and preventive care. Also, if you
are eligible for job-based insurance, you can consider switching to a
Marketplace plan.
If you are already an insured customer
with Marketplace, be sure to review your plan's 2015 coverage. Every
year, insurance companies can make changes, so make sure if it still
meets your needs and you're getting the best plan for you. After November
15, 2014, log in into your Marketplace account and review and update
your latest information so that you'll get the right coverage and
savings you qualify for in 2015.
After the first full year of
the marketplace, it has become clear that it is working.
According
to the White House Administration, over 7.3 million people signed up
for Marketplace plans in 2014, reducing the number of uninsured adults
by 26%.
The increased competition has kept premiums down and
with the success of the first year, insurance companies are even more
eager to get into the system and compete for Americans business. This
means there will be a 25% increase in the number of issuers offering
Marketplace coverage in 2015.
Again, I want to remind
everyone that Open Enrollment will be on going until February 15, 2015.
If you would like more information, please visit www.healthcare.gov
and you can find out more about renewing your coverage, how to enroll,
and eligibility for enrollment.
Sincerely,
Ruben Hinojosa
Member of Congress
