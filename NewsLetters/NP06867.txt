FIRST Karl Rove dumped $640,000 on Chicagoland T.V. to smear Brad&rsquo;s progressive record.
THEN The U.S. Chamber of Commerce launched another HALF-MILLION dollar ad blitz against Brad.
NOW Moments ago, we learned Republican Bob Dold is piling on with an ad buy of his own.
You do the Math. If we don&rsquo;t have the resources to fight back against the onslaught of Republican attacks, Democrats could lose the 10th district for a decade. David -- it&rsquo;s time to go on offense.
