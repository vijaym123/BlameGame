I met this week with students from Red Lake High School and Lincoln High School in Thief River Falls. We had fine weather and enjoyed our time on the steps of the Capitol. It was a pleasure meeting with these students and hearing their plans as they near graduation. While visiting Washington with the Close Up Foundation, the students take part in work shops, mock Congress, and meet with lawmakers while they enjoy the sights and partake in everything our nation's capital has to offer.

On Thursday I met with the Minnesota Soybean Growers Association. We discussed the Surface and Transportation Board hearing regarding the availability of rail service.

MN Telecom Alliance

The members of the MN Telecom Alliance came to town to discuss the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) decision on the Universal Service Fund (USF). Three years ago, the FCC approved a transition period that would transition money from the USF High-Cost Program to a new $4.5 billion a year Connect America Fund for broadband internet expansion. Today, because USF support is tied to voice service for rural providers under current rules, high cost areas served by rural carriers may receive reduced support if consumers do not take plain-old-telephone-service along with broadband. MN telecom providers would like to have the FCC adopt a more tailored provision that will provide sufficient and predictable support for broadband-capable networks in areas served by rural carriers.
Renewable Fuels Ass'n

USS Minnesota (BB-22)
On April 8th, 1905, the battleship Minnesota was christened and launched to sea at Newport News, Virginia. President Theodore Roosevelt became concerned about the U.S. Navy's lack of strength in the Pacific Ocean due to the growing presence of Japan in the waters. He sent the Minnesota and three other battleships to sail to the Philippines, Japan, and China. When World War I began in April 1917, Minnesota became an active duty battleship. The following year the ship was hit by a mine that had been placed in the water by a German submarine. There were no casualties, but the ship was out of commission for five months. In 1924, the Minnesota became outdated and was sold for scrap.

NEWSLETTER-MN07: Updates
Dear Friends,
This week the ice is beginning to thaw around Minnesota as spring starts to bloom in Washington. The Agriculture Committee showed once again that bipartisanship is possible
in the nation&#8217;s capital. Folks from across the Seventh District traveled to Washington to talk about issues ranging from education, transportation, to telecommunications. A former NASCAR driver and current owner met with me to discuss the importance of ethanol
use in fuels.
Sincerely,

CFTC Reauthorization
Agriculture Committee Approves Bipartisan Legislation to Reauthorize CFTC
The House Agriculture Committee Wednesday again demonstrated that it is possible to pass legislation in a bipartisan way. The Committee approved by voice vote H.R.
4413, the Customer Protection and End-User Relief Act to reauthorize and improve the operations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This is reasonable legislation that ensures a well-functioning CFTC, regulates financial entities dealing in
the swaps market, and allows end-users to continue using derivatives to hedge the risks associated with their underlying business.
