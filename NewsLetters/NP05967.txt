David, we&rsquo;ve asked, we&rsquo;ve begged, we&rsquo;ve pleaded. This last week alone ...
-- President Obama
-- Vice President Biden
-- Hillary Clinton
-- and Nancy Pelosi
... have all asked you to fight Boehner&rsquo;s TV ad blitz -- THE LARGEST OF THE YEAR. It&rsquo;s that critical. They know we&rsquo;re drowning. And we&rsquo;re nearly out of time
The federal fundraising deadline hits in 24 hours. And we&rsquo;re STILL falling short. At this point, we&rsquo;ll need 39,OOO donations.
