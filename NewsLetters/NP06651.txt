Tackling the Veteran Suicide Epidemic
[cid:image003.jpg@01CFC75D.E9382310]
One hero lost to suicide is one too many. Yet, an average of 22 veterans take their own lives every day. On July 10th, 2014, in an effort to tackle this problem, I announced the introduction of the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans (Clay Hunt SAV) Act alongside the Chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, Jeff Miller (R-FL), Representative Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), and Veteran Service Organizations the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) and the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW). This is a comprehensive bill aimed at preventing veteran suicide by providing our nation's heroes struggling with the invisible wounds of war with the care and support they deserve.
The legislation is named in honor of Iraq and Afghanistan War Veteran, Purple Heart recipient and suicide prevention advocate, Clay Hunt. Hunt epitomized what it meant to live a life of service, both in and out of uniform. Though he helped countless veterans overcome their own demons, tragically, Hunt took his own life in March of 2011. The legacy he left behind, however, will live on for generations to come.

Recognized as a Leader in Veterans Advocacy
[cid:image005.jpg@01CFC75D.E9382310]On August 18th, I was awarded the Col. Arthur T. Marix Congressional Leadership Award and received commendation from the Minnesota Chapter of Military Officers Association of America (MOAA) in Rochester for my advocacy on behalf of veterans, their families, and active duty service personnel. MOAA is the nation's largest association of active duty, National Guard, Reserve, retired, and former military officers and their families and survivors. The association annually recognizes individuals or organizations that strongly support servicemembers and their families.
I am honored and humbled to receive this award from such an upstanding organization. As we move forward, I will continue to ensure our brave servicemembers and their families have the support and care they have earned and deserve.
Ensuring Emergency Assistance at Home
In mid-July, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) issued a disaster declaration for Rock County and the adjacent counties of Murray, Nobles and Pipestone, making farmers and ranchers in those counties eligible to be considered for emergency loans to help recover and rebuild from the extensive damage caused by heavy precipitation and flooding. I am very pleased that USDA promptly responded to our request for a disaster declaration. This will speed up the process of providing emergency loans and assistance to our farmers. I toured flooded areas and saw firsthand the devastation caused. It is exactly for these types of situations that I fought so hard to include crop insurance and permanent disaster assistance in the 2014 Farm Bill. As we move forward, I will continue fighting for our rural, southern Minnesota agriculture values in Congress.
Conserving our Natural State Treasures (and enjoying some hot dish, too!)
It was a pleasure to host the second annual Walz Conservation Potluck lunch this month with conservation leaders on the banks of the Mississippi in Winona. Prior to the potluck, I took part in a short bike ride with students and outdoor enthusiasts. This year's potluck was a fun, informal way for conservation, hunting, and outdoor enthusiasts to discuss coalition building and preserving our natural state treasures, which are enjoyed year round in Minnesota and add billions of dollars to our economy every year. I was also able to bring my award winning "Turkey Trot Tater-Tot" hot dish for folks to enjoy! For the recipe, please click here .
Having served on the bipartisan, bicameral Farm Bill Conference Committee that worked out a final compromise on the new, long-term Farm Bill, I fought hard for conservation measures that will benefit farmers and hunters, anglers and outdoor enthusiasts across America.

Promoting Made-in-America Manufacturing
[cid:image007.jpg@01CFC75D.E9382310]On August 20th, I toured AGCO Manufacturing in Jackson to tout Made-in-America manufacturing and push for reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank. The Bank promotes American manufacturing around the world and protects hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs by providing American businesses and workers with the certainty they need to compete in the global marketplace. Furthermore, since 2008, the Export-Import bank has been self-sustaining, helping businesses grow while actually generating revenue for American taxpayers and helping pay down the debt.
Companies like AGCO are proving we can make things in America again. As American manufacturing is making a comeback, we should do all we can to ensure that these businesses-that provide good-paying jobs that reinvigorate local communities-have the opportunity to compete in a growing world marketplace. By reauthorizing the Export-Import bank, we're renewing our commitment to American manufacturing, revitalizing Main Street, and working to create good paying, middle-class jobs right here at home.

Hope everyone had a safe and fun-filled Labor Day weekend. With school starting and fall right around the corner, I wanted to give you a quick update on some of the things I&#8217;ve been working on for southern Minnesotans. Keep the faith. As always, it is an
honor to serve you.
Sincerely,

VA Reform Bill Signed into Law
On July 28th, a compromise was reached on the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care reform legislation in the bipartisan, bicameral conference committee that I served on and, on August 7 th , 2014,
the President signed the legislation&#8212;the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014&#8212;into law.
When the conference committee first convened, our number one goal was to produce legislation that put veterans first; legislation that would increase access to care, reduce long wait times at VA hospitals, give the
VA Secretary greater authority to hold employees accountable, and reform the broken system at VA. While the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act isn&#8217;t perfect, it puts veterans and their families first and provides real solutions to reform the VA.
That being said, our work is far from finished. As we move forward we must continue to work diligently to hold the VA accountable and ensure the law is being implemented promptly and properly. Our veterans deserve
nothing less.
