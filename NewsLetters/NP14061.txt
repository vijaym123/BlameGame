Dear Friend:
Today the President signed a bill I wrote with Senator Tom Coburn (R-OK), the HOPE Act (HIV Organ Policy Equity Act), which ends the outdated federal ban on research into organ donations from HIV-positive donors to HIV-positive recipients. To read more about the HOPE Act, please click

I am proud that President Obama signed our bipartisan legislation into law today. Ending this outdated research ban will save lives and give hope to thousands of patients and their families.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
