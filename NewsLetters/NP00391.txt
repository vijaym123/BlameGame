Dear
Friend,
June
1st marked the beginning of another active hurricane season, scheduled
to last through November.
In its initial outlook for the
2015 Atlantic Hurricane season, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) predicts 6 to 11 named storms, of which 3 to 6
could become hurricanes, including up to 2 major
hurricanes.
While a below-normal season is likely, NOAA reminds us that in the 1992
season only seven named storms formed, yet the first was Andrew
a
Category 5 Major Hurricane. So we must be vigilant throughout the
season.
The most important things you can do are to be informed
and prepared. Preparedness includes both being ready for an emergency
situation and reducing potential damage to your home. You should
develop a family and pet plan based on your vulnerability to hurricane
hazards. You should keep a written plan and share it with friends and
family.
Listed in the right panel are emergency contacts.
Additionally, every family should have a disaster preparedness kit.
Suggestions for a kit are in a checklist listed below.
I encourage
you to participate in Americas
PrepareAthon ,
the grassroots campaign sponsored by FEMA to help communities prepare
for specific hazards through drills, group discussions, and exercises:
www.community.fema.gov/ . My website provides you
with more information on other aspects of disaster preparedness.
Youll find it at:

Please contact my office nearest
you for additional help and information.
