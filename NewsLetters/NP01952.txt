.
BEST PRACTICES & POLICE MILITARIZATION: This month, I reintroduced two bipartisan bills - one addressing the use of live animals in military battlefield trauma training exercises and the other with the militarization of our local police.

"A" ON THE ENVIRONMENT: I'm proud to report that I earned a 91 percent rating from The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) on their 2014 National Environmental Scorecard, which tallies the performance of every member of Congress every year on key environmental votes. My lifetime score is 94 percent, the best in the Georgia delegation. For more, click HERE .

TAX TIME: The IRS, Georgia Free File, volunteer tax preparers and I had a
great morning in Clarkston last week when we joined community leaders to urge eligible Georgia residents to use the IRS and Georgia Free File programs to save money at tax time. For more, click HERE .
OBAMACARE WORKING: Over the last five years since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, millions of Americans have been seeing its benefits, including hundreds of thousands of Georgians. Health care prices have risen at the slowest rate in nearly 50 years and thanks to exceptionally slow growth in per-person costs throughout our health care system, national health expenditures grew at the slowest rate on record from 2010 through 2013.

2015 ARTS COMPETITION: I'm looking forward to hosting this year's Congressional Arts Competition, an annual event displaying the community's finest young artists. Since 2007, we have awarded more than $250,000 in arts scholarships to more than 30 Fourth District students. For more information or to read rules and guidelines, click HERE .

Dear
F riends,
I&#8217;m pleased to announce that I am holding
THREE
town hall meetings throughout the Fourth Congressional District in early May. I want to hear from you. While district and national issues will be front and center, I especially want
to give constituents a chance to express their thoughts and concerns.
WHAT:
&#8220;Moving the Fourth Forward&#8221; Town Hall meetings with Congressman Hank Johnson.
WHERE &amp; WHEN:
Rockdale &amp; Newton County
Tuesday, May 5 at Rockdale Career Academy, 1064 Culpepper Drive in Conyers from 6:30-8 p.m.
Gwinnett County
Wednesday, May 6 at Snellville City Hall, 2342 Oak Road in Snellville from 6:30-8 p.m.
DeKalb County
Thursday, May 7 at the Lou Walker Senior Center, 2538 Panola Road in Lithonia from 6:30-8 p.m.
For more information, call 770-987-2291.
SELMA &#43;50:
On March 7, I joined with people across the country to mark the 50th anniversary of &#8220;Bloody Sunday&#8221; in Selma, Ala. All Americans owe the courageous marchers a debt of gratitude. It was especially moving for me because
my colleague Congressman John Lewis was such an important part of the original march in 1965. Rep. Lewis is a hero who knocked down the barriers to opportunity and achievement for all of us.
DISADVANTAGE BUSINESSES:
I&#8217;m hosting a forum for Disadvantage Small Businesses or DBEs on &#8220;How to Do Business with the Federal Government&#8221; on Friday, May 8 from 1-4 p.m. at Georgia Piedmont Technical College&#8217;s Conference Center in
Clarkston. The forum is for eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses to develop and grow their businesses; and, who have demonstrated potential for success by being in business for at least 2-3 years and have capacity to perform on government
and/or non-government contracts. For more, contact Paulette Suggs in my office at 770-987-2291.
POTUS IN THE ATL:
It was a singular honor to accompany President Obama on Air Force One this month when the Commander-In-Chief traveled to Atlanta to discuss his Student Bill of Rights at Georgia Tech. It was important for me to
tell the President directly that he has my support. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I also enjoyed visiting with Georgia Tech alumnus and Navy
Adm. James &#8220;Sandy&#8221; Winnefeld discussing the military issues of the day. For more, click
