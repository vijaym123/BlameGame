David -- THIS is exciting: Hillary Clinton just announced her support for ENDING
Citizens United!
&quot;We need to fix our dysfunctional political system and get unaccountable money out of it once and for all,
even if it takes a constitutional amendment.&rdquo;
Hillary Clinton, April 2015

Say you're with Hillary!
<![endif] Say you&#39;re with Hillary!
With Hillary on our side, we&rsquo;re closer than ever to overturning the damaging
Citizens United
decision, whether by an act of Congress or a constitutional amendment.
But Republicans are once again standing in the way.
They&rsquo;re now trying to give billionaires who fund secret money groups -- like the Koch brothers&rsquo; and Karl Rove&rsquo;s --
even more tax breaks!
Think the GOP will voluntarily give up the help they get from their billionaire friends? No way.
But Democrats will keep fighting to end big money in politics, and we&rsquo;re thrilled to have Hillary in our corner.
Add your name to stand with Hillary and support candidates who want to end
Citizens United.
With your help, we can win this fight.
Thanks,
