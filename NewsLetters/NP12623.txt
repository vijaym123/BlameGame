9 Reasons Pennsylvania Rocks The Capitol
Benjamin Franklin's statue stands just outside the Senate chamber, thinking deep thoughts.
I admit it: I'm a huge history buff. With so many statues and paintings of famous and fascinating Pennsylvanians scattered throughout the Capitol, I couldn't resist sharing just a few with you.
Enjoy!
Working Across Party Lines To Protect Children
Watch WGAL coverage of my press conference with Attorney General Kathleen Kane and State Sen. Tony Williams
At the Children's Resource Center (CRC) in Harrisburg, I hosted state leaders to identify ways to better protect school children from sexual and violent predators. I was glad to have Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane, State Senator Anthony Hardy Williams, and Dauphin County District Attorney Ed Marsico join me and the dedicated staff at the CRC to discuss this important issue.
In the Senate, I have introduced the
bipartisan Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act
to require schools to perform background checks on all new and existing employees. My bill also bans schools from helping a child molester find a new teaching job. This is not a partisan issue. This is about the safety of our children. I will continue to work with officials in Washington and Pennsylvania on this important legislation.
State Sen. Tony Williams, Dr. Paula George, Attorney General Kathleen Kane, Sen. Pat Toomey, and Lynn Carson, manager of the Children's Resource Center.
Protecting Iraq's Jewish Heritage
The Senate has unanimously approved a bipartisan measure to help safeguard roughly
2,700 Jewish artifacts
discovered in Iraq in 2003. Along with Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), I believe these treasures - which include Torah parchments and ancient prayer books - should be housed in a location that is accessible to scholars and to Iraqi Jews and their descendants who have a personal interest in the artifacts.

Supporting Qualified Judges For Pennsylvanians
At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing with Senator Bob Casey
The President has nominated Cheryl Ann Krause to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which covers Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. Sen. Casey and I support the nomination.
In addition to her unquestioned commitment to the law, Ms. Krause has a wealth of legal experience in public service and private practice. I am confident she will excel as a federal appellate judge and I look forward to her joining our other talented federal jurists on the Third Circuit.
