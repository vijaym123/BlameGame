Weekly Update
Our nation rests upon the foundation
of patriotism.
It remains united by the same sense of purpose
that was exhibited by our forefathers and is now shown each and every
day by the brave citizens who serve our country. It is due to the
service and sacrifice of these men and women that we are today the greatest
nation the world has ever known.
The contributions and
service of our nations veterans were on display across the country
lastweek as we recognized Veterans Day. The First District has a storied
military tradition dating back to colonial times and more than 700,000
veterans call Virginia home, as do thousands of active duty servicemen
and women. I was proud to spend Veterans Day with a number of these
dedicated patriots and their families at events in Fredericksburg, King
George, and Williamsburg. We owe these individuals our highest
gratitude, not only on Veterans Day, but every day.
I was also
proud to
join my fellow congressmen
from the Hampton
Roads region in commending the Navys decision to consolidate its
Military Sealift Command at Naval Station Norfolk. Currently, the command
is split between Washington and Norfolk. This consolidation is an
important strategic decision by the Navy and could provide a number of
jobs in the region.
As Chairman of the House Armed Services
Readiness Subcommittee, I will continue to monitor decisions like this
one. I am fully committed to protecting our militarys readiness and
ensuring that our force remains the strongest in the world. I will also
remain vigilant in my effort to avert the impending defense budget
cuts known as the sequester, which would have devastating effects on the
military and our region if allowed to take effect.
Testimony
from the Secretary of Defense and the
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff before the House Armed Services
Committee last week reinforced the importance of staving off the sequester.
During the hearing, which was focused on the United States strategy in
combating the terrorist group ISIL, both of these leaders indicated
that the sequester would drastically reduce our militarys readiness.
Threats around the world are not dwindling, and we must be sure that
our men and women in uniform are manned, trained, and equipped to
complete their missions successfully and safely. The sequester must be
stopped, and I will continue to sound the alarm in
Washington.
Again, thank you to all of our nations veterans and to their families.
May God bless the brave men and women who have served so selflessly.
I thank you and honor you for the freedoms we enjoy in the United
States of America.
