The Webster Wire
Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Another year has rolled around. Sandy and I both feel privileged for the honor of serving you in the community and representing you in Washington. We take the trust you have placed in us seriously, and we look forward to this year as we begin a new Congressional term.
Over Christmas, our entire family got together to open gifts, chop down a tree in the back yard, and just enjoy the blessings of friends and family. Our daughters family from Illinois came for the week, so it was great to have all the children, their spouses, and grandchildren present to enjoy the holidays. We hope that this season was a very blessed time for you as well.
_____________ ______________________
As we wrapped up last year and look toward the coming Congress, I had an interview with Channel 13 to discuss current events and the new Congressional session. You can
watch a portion of it here . I remain greatly concerned about the Presidents continued overreach of executive powers, and look forward to continuing my job under the jurisdiction that the Constitution delegates to Congress: to provide oversight and create laws.

Just before Christmas, I was privileged to be a part of the release of one of the Audubon Center for Birds of Prey rehabilitated Bald Eagles at the Hal Scott Preserve. It was a magnificent sight to watch the adult eagle as it took off from my arm and soared into the sky. I enjoyed meeting the employees from the Audubon Center as they help to protect and care for local eagles. As our national bird, the American bald eagle is a symbol of both grace and strength.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Recently, a constituent from Windermere contacted my office on behalf of an organization that had filed for tax exempt status but had not received a response from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). My office submitted a Congressional Inquiry on behalf of the constituent. The IRS responded that they had not received the application and asked for the paperwork to be resubmitted. Once the constituent had sent in the information, my office followed up with the IRS afterwards to confirm that they had received the paperwork. Shortly afterwards, we were notified that the organization was granted their tax exempt status.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.

Legislative Update:
Welcome to the 114th Congress! This week, both the House and Senate will reconvene to swear in newly elected Members and begin the next Congressional term. I have been reassigned to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and anticipate being reappointed to the House Committee on Rules as well. There is a lot of work to be done in both committees of jurisdiction, and I look forward to working on behalf of Central Florida to ensure the best results possible for both our economy and community.
