The Pen and Phone
Friends-
Earlier this year, President Obama declared: "I've got a pen and I've got a phone -- and I can use that pen to sign executive orders and take executive actions and administrative actions that move the ball forward."
The president made similar claims in last night's State of the Union speech, declaring that "wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, thats what Im going to do." Unfortunately, many of the steps the president has taken under executive order have either
hurt American families
or have simply been fixes to problems his Administration created.
There are a few ways the president
can use his pen and phone
to join House Republicans in our efforts to get Americans back to work in good-paying jobs. He can start by picking up his phone and telling Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to take up the
dozens of jobs bills passed in the House . Bills that would move things like the Keystone XL pipeline forward and
create more than 40,000 jobs.
Bills that would relieve individuals and small businesses from
crushing ObamaCare regulations ,
taxes and mandates . The president can also stop issuing veto threats, and use his pen as it was constitutionally intended: to sign legislation - passed by the peoples' elected representatives - into law.
As always, I welcome your feedback, and I encourage you to connect using my

In Your Service,
Congressman Steven Palazzo
