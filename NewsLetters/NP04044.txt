Focus on the Presidents Unilateral Edict on
Immigration
The American people want both parties
to focus on solutions to get our struggling economy moving in order to
create jobs and opportunities.
This week the House passed
important legislation to help families with special needs and to prevent tax
hikes on millions of families and small businesses.
But we
also kept the focus on the Presidents recent executive decree on
immigration by passing H.R. 5759.
In essence, this bill states that
the President does not have the authority to issue unilateral orders
to delay deportations of undocumented immigrants or grant quasi-legal
status, work permits and Social Security numbers to those who are in
the country illegally.
I am under no illusions that
Harry Reids Senate will take up this legislation and send it to
President Obamas desk.
But passage of this legislation in the House
is an important act that will help educate the American people about
the consequences of the Presidents unconstitutional
action.
In the meantime, we continue to examine a variety of options for this
year and next when Republicans control both Houses of the Congress.
Seriously Dangerous Milestone: A Legacy
of Debt
Less than two years into President Obama's
second term, new numbers show our national debt increased by more
than $6 trillion since he took office. It's the largest increase to date
under any U.S. president.
This week, the national debate
surpassed $18 trillion.
Such large and growing federal debt
will have serious negative consequences, including restraining
economic growth in the long term and giving policymakers less flexibility to
respond to unexpected challenges, including national security
threats.
The solution: cut federal spending responsibly, remove
onerous and unnecessary regulations on our economy and use every possible
tool to simulate growth and create
jobs.
