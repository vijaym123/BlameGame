Dear Fellow
Nevadan,
On Thursday, September 4, 2014 at Mandalay Bay Resort &amp;
Casino, I invite you to focus on Americas clean energy future at the
National Clean Energy Summit 7.0: Partnership &amp;
Progress . For the seventh year in a row, I am pleased to be
co-sponsoring this daylong event with the
Center for
American Progress , the
Clean Energy Project ,
MGM Resorts International , and the
University of Nevada, Las Vegas . I am delighted that Former
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will deliver the keynote
address. She has been a staunch supporter of bolstering our national
security and protecting our climate by deploying clean and renewable
energy resources. She understands the energy issues we are facing in the
U.S. and around the world and I look forward to her valuable
contribution to this conversation.
As the nations foremost clean
energy conversation, this years event will highlight how the private
sector, through public-private partnerships and collaboration, is
deploying clean energy, investing in innovation, modernizing our nation's
electric grid, and reducing climate pollution.
For more
information about the summit and to register online, please go to

to help make Nevada the nations renewable energy epicenter, please

look forward to an enthusiastic dialogue on how Americans can continue
to build a 21st century clean energy future and hope you can join

Sincerely,
HARRY REID
