Greetings,
I've written to you a great deal about the importance of maintaining national security against foreign threats ranging from Russian belligerence to radical Islamic terrorism.
But we're now facing another kind of threat:
The spread of Ebola.
One of the most alarming aspects of this crisis is how unprepared Washington appears to be, despite the billions of taxpayer dollars spent to prepare for this very thing.
Earlier this year, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention was confident in its ability to prevent the spread of Ebola to the U.S., and yet later admitted that a man in Dallas was infected, despite having been screened by CDC-trained officials prior to leaving Liberia.
This isn't about politics.
This is about keeping Americans safe.
The Administration needs to do a better job of explaining its actions on Ebola
This week, I signed a letter to the President calling for answers on how the Administration is dealing with this threat.
The letter also calls for securing our borders and restricting travel from countries where Ebola is purported to have originated.
Americans deserve answers and real leadership from Washington.
After all, our lives depend on it.
Sincerely,
Mike Pompeo
Member of Congress
