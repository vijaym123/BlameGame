Will you take just a moment to vote in this
flash poll on the issues? Do you believe Congress should completely overhaul the NSA as a
result of its overreaches? Yes No Not sure Do you want this Congress to produce
immigration reform legislation this year? Yes No Not
sure Do you think Congress
should extend unemployment benefits? Yes No Not

I just wanted to
reach out to you with this quick poll since Congress is back in session
and we've got a lot of work to do.
There are so many issues we
need to resolve, it's important for me to keep a sense of my
constituents' priorities beyond all the phone calls we receive and the people I
meet out and about.
These quick little flash polls can
help.
If you don't mind, I'd love for you to weigh in. Feel free
to use the box over to the right to send this on to a friend
in the Ninth District
as well.
The more folks I hear
from, the better work we can do.
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member
of Congress
