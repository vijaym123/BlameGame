Rokita Readings
A clickable offering of books and articles that I've read recently and
highly recommend, as we strive together to "Keep the Republic."
Featured in this week's Rokita Readings is an article (adapted from
remarks) I recently read by Larry Arnn, the President of Hillsdale
College, titled "A Rebirth of Liberty and Learning
."
I was reminded of this article during the education hearing I held in
my role as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary,
and Secondary Education this week, which you will read more about
below.
We looked at current training and benchmarks in preparation of
our teachers.
While we did not explicitly discuss curriculum, it
certainly relates.
In his remarks, Arn discusses Common Core, what I call critical
thinking skills, and the stark difference between our four beautiful
organic laws and the monstrosity of the composition of our current laws.
I encourage you to read the remarks and take a look at many of
Hillsdale's other fine articles.
They are one of the preeminent
institutions for understanding our founding documents and I regularly
read their content.
_____
Stopping Government Abuse
Congress must continue to exercise its constitutional responsibility to
hold a brazen executive branch accountable for its actions.
That is why I cosponsored and fought for numerous pieces of legislation
this week, many of which passed unanimously with bipartisan support, to
combat executive branch overreach and abuse of power:
Taxpayers deserve increased transparency of how tax dollars are spent,
and protection from IRS targeting based on their political beliefs.
The government that governs least, governs best and I will continue
working to ensure the federal government respects the Constitutional
rights and the tax dollars of the American people so they can focus on
building better lives for themselves and their families
You can learn more about these bills here

Exploring Efforts to Strengthen the Teaching Profession
On Thursday, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood,
Elementary, and Secondary Education, I convened a joint committee
hearing with Chairwoman Virginia Foxx of the Subcommittee on Higher
Education and Workforce Training entitled "Exploring Efforts to
Strengthen the Teaching Profession
."
Watch Rep. Rokita's opening remarks and highlights from the hearing
here
.
Testimony and questioning during the hearing focused on efforts at the
local and state level to ensure there is an excellent teacher in every
classroom.
Efforts include improving metrics to track teacher success
and reforming the bureaucratic hurdles, onerous requirements, and
outdated mandates that stand in the way of attracting talented young
educators to our nation's schools.
Because we fight, not only for our children, but for all people, so
they can build better lives for themselves and their families, we must
also find ways to see teachers achieve greater success.
This hearing
was a meaningful step in that goal, and an issue I will continue to
pursue.

Greater Lafayette Chamber of Commercer Fly-In
On Thursday, I met with the Greater Lafayette Chamber of Commerce
during the annual visit to Washington, DC.
While in
Washington, the delegation of community leaders met with myself, and
Indiana's two senators to discuss issues facing Greater Lafayette.
One particular issue they were concerned with was K-12 education.
Leaders in the community have taken action in recent years to help
students succeed in Lafayette area schools.
Most notably, the Read to
Succeed program is matching volunteers and students with private
resources to help students read and write.
I recognized these efforts
and the leaders that started these programs during my opening remarks
at an education hearing
this week.
I look forward to continue working with leaders in the Greater
Lafayette area on the issues they discussed with me this week.
_____
Building Coalitions - General Aviation Pilot Protection Act Gains
Support
Last November, I introduced the General Aviation Pilot Protection Act
(H.R. 3708).
The GA Pilot Protection Act would reform an outdated
World War II rule that requires excessive medical testing of small
airplane pilots.
This expensive and onerous rule is slowly killing the
general aviation industry by driving pilots out of the industry.
You
can learn more about the bill here
.
Since it's introduction, we have had roughly 50 of my colleagues
cosponsor the bill, and have had the endorsements of several trade
organizations.
Rep. Rokita discusses the GA Pilot Protection Act with NASAO 2-26-14
On Wednesday, I spoke to the National Association of State Aviation
Officials (NASAO) to continue building support for the bill, and to
represent the House General Aviation Caucus.
The group was supportive
to the bill and I look forward to having the help of their members in
gaining support for the bill in Congress.

Thank you for your continued interest in Congress and for supporting my
efforts in Washington. Take care.
Sincerely,
Todd Rokita

On

Greater

Fly-In
On

on
the
issues
they discussed
with

this

General
Aviation
Pilot
Protection
Act
Gains
Support
Last
November,
I
introduced
the
General
Aviation
Pilot
Protection
Act
(H.R.
3708).
The
GA
Pilot
Protection
Act
would
reform
an
outdated
World
War
II
rule
that
requires
excessive
medical
testing
of
small
airplane
pilots.
This
expensive
and
onerous
rule
is
slowly
killing
the
general
aviation
industry
by
driving
pilots
out
of
the
industry.
You
can
learn
more
about
the
bill
here .
Since
it's
introduction,
we
have
had
roughly
50
of
my
colleagues
cosponsor
the
bill,
and
have
had
the
endorsements
of
several
trade

On
Wednesday,
I
spoke
to
the
National
Association
of
State
Aviation
Officials
(NASAO) to
continue
building
support
for
the
bill,
and
to
represent
the
House
General
Aviation
Caucus.
The
group
was
supportive
to
the
bill
and
I
look
forward
to
having
the
help
of
their
members
in
gaining
support
for
the
bill
in
Congress.
Thank
you
for
your
continued

in
Congress
and
for
supporting
my
efforts
in
Washington.
Take
care.
