We mark with sadness the passing of Nelson Mandela, who led South Africa from a state of division and oppression to become a rainbow nation. "We are turning the variety of our languages and cultures, once used to divide us, into a source of strength and richness," he declared, as South Africa's first President, elected by all. And he sounded this ideal of common humanity beyond the borders of his own country. Accepting the Nobel Peace Prize, Mandela called for "a society which recognises that all people are born equal, with each entitled in equal measure to life, liberty, prosperity, human rights and good governance." His allegiance to this principle of equality cost the great man 27 years behind bars, which President Obama remembered in a eulogy yesterday, repeating Mandela's own words from the prisoner's dock: "I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die." Though Nelson Mandela has passed on, let us all keep his ideal alive.

The main measure of economic health, GDP, rose 5.2 percent in 2012. This is the largest gain in the last decade and was driven by tourism and consumer spending. While too soon to declare a trend, it is clear we need to keep nurturing our visitor industry and keep our population numbers up, if we want our economy to grow.
GDP down, then up for 2011 and 2012 - Gross Domestic Product in the Northern Mariana Islands decreased 6.8 percent in 2011, then increased 5.2 percent in 2012. The US Bureau of Economic Analysis released the new data on overall economic activity this week . Despite the significant growth in 2012, at $593 million in real dollars GDP remains half what it was ten years before. It is also below the 2010 total of $604 million. That year GDP ticked up after six straight years of decline because of spending from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The drop in 2011 was pinned on the Fukushima disaster, which discouraged Japanese tourism, and on Commonwealth government austerity measures. But tourism also contributed positively to the GDP improvement in 2012. This week's new information highlights the importance of having diversified sources of tourism and of protecting the parole system that makes it easy for tourists from Russia and China to visit us. We also have to keep our resident population numbers up. Consumer spending is the bulk of GDP. Losing population, whether because people leave to find more opportunity or because of changes in immigration, hurts our economy. And, according to the US Census Bureau, the number of people in the Northern Marianas continues to drop.

Mr. Thomas Dail and Mr. Lucas Hitt of the Bureau of Economic Analysis briefed me on new gross domestic product data their agency released this week. GDP releases for the Northern Mariana Islands are getting closer to the schedule of release for states. State GDP comes out six months after the close of each calendar year. NMI GDP data for 2013 are expected in the summer of 2014.
White House Summer Internships open - The White House has announced that applications are open for the 2014 Summer Internship Program. White House interns gain valuable professional experience and build leadership skills in a remarkable environment.

Students Shirley, Kenneth, Leilani, Vanessa and Trixie, participating in the Saipan Chamber of Commerce Student Career Exploration Day, toured their Saipan congressional office. They were accompanied by their mentor, Ms. Shirley Sablan, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Pacifica Insurance Underwriters Inc. Pacifica brings students to neighboring offices to expose them to a full range of career opportunities. Thank you all for visiting.
Keeping tabs on shipping costs - I have asked the Federal Maritime Commission to make very careful review of a proposal that could affect the costs of goods in the Northern Mariana Islands. Along with the other Pacific area representatives who signed the letter to Chairman Mario Cordero , I took no position on whether the Commission should approve the proposed P3 Alliance, which will coordinate vessel sharing among Maersk Lines, MSC, and CMA-CGM. Together the combination would control fifty-eight percent of large, ocean-going cargo carriers. Pacific areas are particularly dependent on ocean shipping to provide basic commodities, and the Alliance could exert considerable influence on pricing and availability of goods. We have asked the Commission to fully consider the effects of the proposed P3 Alliance.

Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Energy, Installations, and the Environment Dennis McGinn, ADM (ret.) and I discussed the Navy's continuing requirements for safety zones and clear access to areas around the military's leased lands on Tinian and Farallon de Medinilla this week. McGinn has been in his position for three months and I appreciated the opportunity to begin building our working relationship.
Fukushima marine debris addressed - $50,000 has been set aside to clean up any debris from the Fukushima tsunami that comes ashore in the Northern Mariana Islands. The Government of Japan gave $5 million to the United States last year to help with the problem. $1.75 million has been allocated so far among the US Pacific coast areas. The Natural Resources Committee is also addressing the issue of marine debris legislatively. On Thursday we approved two bills amending the Marine Debris Research, Prevention and Reduction Act, which I cosponsored in the last Congress. H.R. 1491
provides statutory authority for distribution of the Fukushima grant from Japan. H.R. 1425
allows the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to give priority to severe marine debris events, such as the tsunami or Hurricane Sandy, and redistribute existing Marine Debris Program funds to where they are most needed. Governors would be authorized to request declaration of a severe marine debris event. Marine debris is an eyesore and an environment hazard. 10,290 pounds of the trash was collected along the shores of Saipan, Tinian, and Rota in September during the 28th annual International Beach Cleanup. Thanks to all the volunteers who are keeping our islands beautiful.
