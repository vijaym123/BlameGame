Highlights in the Legislative Program
Territorial highlights emerge from Presidents budget
President Obama released his budget proposal for fiscal year 2015 this week. While there are many programs that the Northern Marianas and all U.S. jurisdictions benefit from, spending proposals particularly benefit our islands: Among those proposals:
*
Continuation of the higher set-aside for water and sewer funding from the Environmental Protection Agency. The Presidents budget calls for continuation of the 1.5 percent set-aside for insular areas from the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water grant programs. The set-asides jumped from 0.28 percent and 0.33 percent, respectively, in fiscal year 2010, at my request. The resulting $35 million has helped us get 24/7 water service on Saipan 94 percent of the time.
*
Increase in technical assistance monies managed by the Office of Insular Affairs. The President responded positively to the letter I led from the territorial delegation requesting an additional $3 million for the technical assistance fund. This source of money was one of the financial lifelines that has helped the Northern Marianas hospital work through its certification problems.
*
Exemption from Medicaid funding caps in the insular areas to support fraud control units. The proposal would encourage territories to establish Medicaid Fraud Control Units to recover funds. The federal support for the units will be exempted from the current cap on Medicaid funding for the territories. $10 million is being recommended for this program.
*
Expansion of Early Head Start/Increased Head Start funding. The budget requests $650 million to assist communities to increase learning programs for infants and toddlers. In addition, an additional $120 million will strengthen services for children by Head Start. It is well established that children who are able to receive educational services at a very early age do better all through their school years and into later life. We want as many children as possible in the Northern Marianas to have that advantage.
The Presidents budget submission to Congress is a first step in the annual process of funding the federal government. Next, congressional subcommittees will begin writing the legislation that actually appropriates money; and Members of Congress, who have been lobbying the President for inclusion in his budget, will now shift their focus to their colleagues, the appropriators, who make the call on which programs should be funded and at what amounts. Fiscal year 2015 begins on October 1.

Ukraine concern reaches the NMI
I issued a statement this week , as the representative of the people of the Northern Mariana Islands in our federal government, calling for peaceful resolution of the political and military crisis in Ukraine. Aside from our concern about the impact of the crisis on the lives of the Ukrainians themselves, we must also think about how this situation could draw in our own men and women in uniform. And we have an economic concern. Because the Northern Marianas has substantial tourism trade with Russia and sanctions imposed by our government on Russian travel to the U.S. could affect us. Texas Representative Ted Poe (R) has already introduced legislation
denying visas to officials and employees of the Russian Federation. And the President issued an Executive Order
on Thursday, denying entry to the U.S. by citizens of Russia, who have played a role in undermining Ukrainian sovereignty. Either action affects a limited number of individuals. So, for now, generally, our doors remain open. I will continue to be a voice in Congress calling for prompt diplomatic solutions in Ukraine.

Ms. Fran Castro, who chairs the U.S. All Islands Coral Reef Committee and is Director of the CNMI Division of Coastal Resources Management, and Ms. Lainie Zarones, CRM Coastal Planner, visited their congressional office this week. Coastal managers from all over the country were in Washington to educate Congress about the challenges and needs of the 35 U.S. coastal jurisdictions. Director Castro and Ms. Zarones briefed me on the benefits and needs of the coastal resources program in the Northern Mariana Islands; and they requested that I support robust funding for fiscal year 2015. One of CRMs priorities includes the development of strategies for adaptation to climate change, which is already impacting insular areas.
FDA offers CNMI resources to look for Fukushima radiation
At my request the Food and Drug Administration has agreed to provide the Commonwealth with material and logistical support to respond to public concern about radiation hazards from the Fukushima nuclear accident. A number of constituents have told me they are worried about radiation from Fukushima reaching the Northern Mariana Islands in ocean waters or through the food chain. So I worked to find federal resources addressing this concern. FDA is able to provide radiation pagers, a radionuclide identification system, dosimeters, service contracts and training for use by the Commonwealth government. FDA has also invited the CNMI to join a working group of officials from federal agencies and from Hawaii and other Pacific coastal states, who meet periodically to discuss the Fukushima incident and its impact. I appreciate FDAs response.

Ms. Esther Muna, Chief Executive Officer of the Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation, came to see her congressional office and brief me on the Saipan hospital and Rota and Tinian clinics. The federal government has been instrumental in keeping CHC in operation throughout its certification crisis, using personnel from the Department of Health and Human Services, technical assistance funding from the Interior Department, and, of course, $27 million in new Medicaid funding from Obamacare. At the end of the day, however, it comes down to the dedication and hard work of the 400 men and women at the hospital, led by Ms. Muna, who work to keep us healthy and give care when we are ill.
Thanks for all you do!
$182,373 awarded to the CNMI Historic Preservation Office
Kudos to the CNMI Historic Preservation Office, which has received a grant of $182,373 to help protect and preserve historic sites in the Northern Mariana Islands. The grant comes from a nationwide program, authorized and funded by Congress, that aims to assist local communities maintain their social, cultural and ethnic heritages. Keeping this heritage alive enriches all Americans, today and into the future, and is an incentive for tourists to come and visit our country. Congratulations, HPO!
