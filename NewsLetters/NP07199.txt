Dear Friend,
This month we celebrate the 49 th
anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, landmark legislation that helped eliminate discriminatory voting practices, and supported our country&rsquo;s promise that everyone, no matter their race, has the right to vote.
However, last year, the Supreme Court struck down part of this important legislation, leaving Congress to come up with an amended law.
In an effort to address the Supreme Court&rsquo;s damaging decision and reinstate the benefits of the Voting Rights Act, I am pleased to support the Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2014 (H.R. 3899).
This bill updates the provisions struck down by the Court and ensures that the constitutional right to vote continues to be protected for all Americans.
Our right to vote is the very basis of our democracy and the reason our nation continues to flourish. Every American has an obligation to protect this right for our fellow citizens.
I will continue to support legislation that reinforces voting rights and opportunities and hope you will join me in this cause.
As always, please feel free to call or email my office if there is anything I can do for you.
Regards,
