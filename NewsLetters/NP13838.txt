15th District Update
Dear Neighbor,
On this Thanksgiving, I hope that we will all have the chance to take a few minutes to really reflect on our blessings. I am thankful to live in such a great country and for our men and women in uniform who defend our freedoms. I am thankful for a wonderful wife and for our two sons.
As we gather with family and friends this holiday, I hope that you, too, will find the time to reflect on all the blessings that we have been given as a nation.
I am deeply humbled and thankful for this opportunity to serve you in Congress,
Dennis
