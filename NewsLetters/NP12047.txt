Tips for Tax Season
With tax day just two months away, I wanted to let you know about a great free filing service available right on the IRS website.
It's called Free File, and all taxpayers can use it at no cost.
This is a free service that offers federal tax preparation and e-file options for all taxpayers. Free File is made possible through a public-private partnership between the IRS and the Free File Alliance, a coalition of industry-leading tax software companies.This service aims to make the tax filing process quicker and simpler, and has saved taxpayers an estimated $1.2 billion in filing costs over the past 10 years.
If your income was $58,000 or less in 2013, you are eligible to use Free File's easy filing software to prepare and e-file your federal tax returns. They also offer a basic federal e-filing service with no income limitations, so anyone can use their online fillable forms at no cost.
