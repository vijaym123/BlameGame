UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA - - - - -
November 14, 2013
Dear Friend:
Today our thoughts are with all the victims
of Typhoon Haiyan and the hundreds of thousands of survivors in the
Philippines who are struggling to access clean drinking water, food and
medical care in the aftermath of this terrible tragedy.
As
Californians, we know all too well what it means to be struck by a
natural disaster. Now, in the wake of this devastating typhoon, many are
asking what they can do to help with the rescue and recovery efforts
in the Philippines. For information on how you can provide assistance
to disaster relief organizations, please go to the State Department
webpage at
http://blogs.state.gov/stories/2013/11/11/state-department-works-bring-relief-typhoon-victims .
Sincerely,
Barbara
Boxer
United States Senator
