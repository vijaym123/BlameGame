I&rsquo;m cutting to the chase: I need your help. I need you to give $5 to help Democrats win this election. And I need you to do it right now. All Donations to this E-Mail
TRIPLE-MATCHED
Today Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount. The numbers are frightening:
poll after poll shows the race for Congress is a dead heat. BUT those polls don&rsquo;t take into account how severely we&rsquo;re being outspent.
I&rsquo;ll put this as concisely as I can:
If we can&rsquo;t close this spending gap&hellip;we will lose.
There&rsquo;s no time left. We need 13 more donations from the 60659 zip code to close the gap. And we only have 24 hours until the final public fundraising deadline. Please give $5 right now: https://action.dccc.org/Help-Democrats
