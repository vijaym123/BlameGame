Cruz/Lamborn Anti-Terrorism Legislation Unanimously Passes both Houses of
Congress
4/14/14
A bill from Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Congressman Doug Lamborn
to prevent terrorists from getting visas to enter the United States as
United Nations ambassadors is now on its way to President Obama's desk
following unanimous passage in both Houses of
Congress.
I have been working hard with House
Leadership to move this bill even before it passed the Senate,"
said Congressman Lamborn. "I appreciate House Leaderships rapid
response to my request to quickly bring the Cruz/Lamborn bill to the House
Floor for a vote. It will give the President the power to prevent an
Iranian terrorist from entering our country with diplomatic immunity.
This is a great example of leadership in action by both Houses of
Congress. After Senator Cruz worked to ensure Senate passage earlier in
the week, I felt that it was extremely important that the House respond
in-kind by considering the Cruz/Lamborn bill in an expedited manner.
It is great to see Congress send a strong, bipartisan message that
Iranian evildoers will be treated like terrorists, not tourists.
Terrorists, from Iran or elsewhere, should not be allowed to walk the streets
of Manhattan with diplomatic
immunity.
Congressman Lamborn spoke on the
House Floor in support of this legislation twice, once on Tuesday, April
7th and again, following final passage on Thursday, April
10th.
