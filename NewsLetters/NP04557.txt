David,
Today we celebrate and honor the veterans who have served our great nation.
We owe so much to our brave men and women in uniform, which is why I&rsquo;m devoted to making sure they receive the benefits they've earned and deserve.
I&rsquo;m asking you to join me in honoring their sacrifice by supporting the Wounded Warrior Project, an organization dedicated to helping our injured service members get the care they need. If you&rsquo;re able, please send a contribution to the Wounded Warrior Project today.
To all veterans and their families, thank you.
