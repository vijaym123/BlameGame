A distinguished group of school administrators attended this week's Emerging Leaders Program, part of our Public School System's continuing efforts in professional development. Commissioner Rita Sablan, who was facilitating a team session, invited me over to say a few words to these hardworking individuals. Thank you for all the work that you do for students in the Northern Mariana Islands! Students First!
Disabled veterans may receive priority processing of Social Security disability claims - As of March 17, veterans with a disability compensation rating of 100% Permanent and Total (P&T;) can receive expedited processing of Social Security disability benefit claims. Veterans must provide a verification of their rating when applying for Social Security, in order to receive priority service. The VA rating does not guarantee approval of SS disability claim, however; and a number of factors can affect the time it will take for the agency to make a determination. These include the nature of disability, the time it takes to receive supporting documentation, and whether a medical exam is necessary. If approved for Social Security disability benefits, Medicare coverage is automatic after benefits have been received for 24 months. There are three ways to apply for the Social Security disability benefit: online at http://www.socialsecurity.gov/applyfordisability/, via the toll-free number, 1-800-772-1213, or by making an appointment to visit your local Social Security office. For more information, visit http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pgm/disability-pt.htm.

As the Kagman Community Health Center nears its one-year anniversary, some of the people responsible for the successful application for Obamacare funds to build the Center, and for its continuing operation visited their congressional office. Ms. Arielle Buyum, Ms. Velma Palacios, and Mr. Vince Castro were in Washington for the National Association of Community Health Centers' 2014 Policy & Issues Forum. Thank you for helping the Northern Marianas stay healthy.
Northern Marianas seniors are taking advantage of new Obamacare benefits - Of the 1,701 people in the Northern Mariana Islands enrolled in Medicare Part B, 756 received free preventive services in 2013, according to new information from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Seniors and people with disabilities on Medicare are enjoying these benefits because of the expansion of free services made possible by the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. March 23rd marks the fourth anniversary of the law. One free service that remains underutilized in the NMI, however, is the annual wellness check-up. Only 13 of our seniors have taken advantage of this no-cost Medicare benefit. More seniors are cutting their prescription drug costs, though. 26 received an average discount of $638 on their prescriptions last year as a result of the "donut hole" fix in Obamacare. While there are many improvements that could be made to the Affordable Care Act, especially as it applies overall in the U.S. insular areas, at the individual level it is clear that many people are getting better access to affordable care.

The Lina'la Malawasch Academy, an alternative education program at Hopwood Jr. High School, and I have a long-standing friendship. This week I visited this group of young men and women, who had many interesting questions about my life and the work I do here at home and in Washington, DC. Thank you LMA, Mr. Victor Cabrera, Mr. Catching, teachers, counselors and staff at Hopwood Jr. High School for all you do for LMA and Hopwood. Go Hilitais!
Let's celebrate Agriculture Day! - Tuesday, March 25 is National Agriculture Day, the time to recognize our farmers and ranchers for their contribution to our local economy and to our good health and nutrition. Agriculture is one of the bright spots in the Northern Marianas economic future. I encourage our farmers to grow their businesses by taking advantage of the grant opportunities available as a result of the recently-enacted Agricultural Act of 2014. The Natural Resources Conservation Program
provides assistance for beginning and small farmers. The Farm Service Agency helps family farmers through the Reimbursement Transportation Cost Program . USDA makes these and other programs available throughout the year; and your congressional office passes the announcements to you through this e-newsletter. Happy Agriculture Day!

America welcomed 13 new citizens in the Northern Mariana Islands this week. Chief Judge Ramona V. Manglona of the United States District Court of the Northern Mariana Islands presided over the naturalization ceremony in her courtroom. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services officers Nicolas Bartell and Diane Zedde also joined in the event. It takes hard work to meet the requirements to become a U.S. citizen, and citizenship requires a continuing shared responsibility for the welfare of our community. But the reward for those efforts can be great. To all our new citizens, their families and friends: best wishes and congratulations.
$2,379 awarded to CNMI for HIV care - The Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation is receiving $2,379 for the care of patients with HIV from the Ryan White Title II Formula Grants Program. Congress established the grant in memory of young AIDS victim Ryan White, who contracted the disease from a tainted blood supply, while undergoing treatment for another disorder. The grant is intended to improve the quality, accessibility, and organization of health care and support services for individuals and families living with HIV. Congratulations to the Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation.
$415,360 awarded to the CNMI Department of Public Safety - The Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has awarded the CNMI Department of Public Safety a $415,360 Community Highway Safety grant. Congress provides these funds to help reduce traffic crashes, deaths, injuries, and property damage. Congratulations to DPS.

We are always glad to have visitors from home.
