An
Energy Policy Only an Oil Executive Could
Love
Later this week, the House will vote
on an energy bill that emerged from the Republican-controlled Natural
Resources Committee.
The bill [ H.R. 1965 ] is a gift-come-true for oil and gas companies,
and proposes a streamlined process for turning over vast areas of
publicly-owned lands to industry at the same time that the bill sharply
curtails environmental and safety reviews.
H.R. 1965
would also require the Secretary of
Interior to elevate energy and mineral extraction above all other
uses of public lands, including hunting, fishing, recreation and
grazing.
Ironically,
H.R. 1965
is being offered at a
time when domestic oil and gas production is skyrocketing.
Domestic crude production has reached its highest point in 25 years.
The U.S. produced more crude oil in October than it imported for the
first time since early 1995, as domestic shale oil output continued to
surge.
Levin Backs Bill to Prevent Invasive Species from Entering
U.S.
Michigan
has been on front lines when it comes to destructive invasive species,
including the emerald ash borer, zebra mussels, and now the Asian
carp.
Other states have also been hit hard; notably Florida, which
is being overrun by Burmese python snakes that first escaped into the
environment in 1992.
The
problem is that the federal law that is supposed to protect us from
harmful invasive species, the Lacey Act, is badly out-of-date.
Under the Lacey Act, it can take years to officially list a species as
injurious and take appropriate action.
By that time, the damage is
already done.
Rep.
Levin has joined New York Representative Louise Slaughter as a cosponsor
of the Invasive
Fish and
Wildlife Prevention Act [H.R. 996] , that would give the Fish and
Wildlife Service streamlined authority to deal with potentially harmful
invasive species before they are imported into the country and do
damage.
Lawmakers Call for New AIDS Treatment
Goal
On November 14, Rep. Levin and 39 other
House and Senate lawmakers wrote to President Obama to urge him to set
a goal of doubling the number of people around the world receiving
life-saving HIV/AIDS treatment through the Presidents Emergency Plan
for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).
Begun in 2003, PEPFAR has treated and
cared for millions of individuals facing HIV/AIDS around the
world.
The lawmakers
letter
urges a new PEPFAR
goal of supporting 12 million people by the end of
2016.
