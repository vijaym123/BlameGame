CONNECTING WITH
IDAHOANS
February brought many opportunities for me to share what is going on in the
114 th
Congress and to hear directly from Idahoans on the
issues confronting our country at a number of town hall meetings
throughout the state.
As many of you know, I have been holding listening
sessions in communities across Idaho (37 since November) when the
U.S. Senate is not in session.
As a part of these meetings, I have
used presentation materials to help illustrate the growing danger of
the national debt now in excess of $18 trillion, noting that, if left
unchecked, the cost of interest alone in repaying the mounting debt
could soon surpass federal spending on our military
programs.
Those meetings continue this week, this time in north
Idaho.
The dates, times and locations are as
follows:
Friday, March 6:
2:00

Elk

Please take a moment to view photos from my town meetings in
February.
Great discussion at
the American Falls town meeting.
Athol town meeting with Mayor Darla Kuhman.
The
participation at the Athol town meeting was great to
see!
The discussion at the Grand View town meeting was focused on our
exploding national debt, and the President's proposed Fiscal Year 2016
Budget.
Talking the President's newest budget
proposal with consitutents in Grand View.
In
addition to hosting town meetings, using technology to connect with Idahoans
allows me to keep in touch at a time when I cannot be in Idaho to
meet in-person.
My first of four scheduled tele-townhall meetings
for this year took place in late February.
These quarterly
meetings will be held throughout the year, generally every three months,
depending on the Senate schedule.
All that is needed to participate
is a phone, and callers are given the opportunity to ask questions
regarding federal policies and legislation. Sign up to participate in
the next tele-townhall here.
Please note that the schedule is
subject to change pending the Senate voting schedule.
The calls
begin at 7 p.m. Mountain/6 p.m. Pacific.
The remaining tele-townhall
meeting schedule for 2015 is as follows:
May 13,
2015
September 16, 2015
December 2,
2015

WORKING TO HALT BACK-DOOR
DIVESTMENT OF THE A-10
We must not overlook
the unique close air support capabilities that the A-10 provides in
keeping our men and women in uniform safe.
The Air Forces continued
effort to do away with the A-10 Warthog, whether through fleet
divestment or moving the aircraft into back-up status, could have profound
effects on our nations military readiness and leave troops without
proven, combat-effective close air support.
I have urged Defense
Secretary Carter and Air Force Secretary James to carefully scrutinize
their efforts to dismantle the A-10 platform given the importance of
this aircraft to soldiers on the ground.
The A-10 has proven
effective in countless close air support missions in the last decade,
including in the fight against ISIS.
To retire it now is a
mistake.
I will continue to oppose the decision in Congress.
Idahos National Guard must have a strong flying mission at Gowen Field
and the Air Force must maintain its superior close air support
capabilities.

the A-10, visit my website by clicking

HOT
TOPICS
SCRAP
ACT:
In a continued effort to prevent costly new regulatory
burdens from being imposed on Idaho farmers, Senator Jim Risch
(R-Idaho) and I introduced the SCRAP Act, or Stopping Costly Regulations
Against Produce, in the U.S. Senate.
This legislation would defund
the Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) proposed fresh produce rule
that will negatively impact farmers throughout the country.

learn more, visit my website by clicking

SECURE
RURAL SCHOOLS (SRS) / PAYMENT IN LIEU OF TAXES (PILT): I,
along with Senators Risch (R-Idaho) and Ron Wyden (D-Oregon), introduced
bipartisan legislation to renew the Secure Rural Schools (SRS)
program, which supports schools, law-enforcement and roads in more than 700
rural counties across the country.
The legislation also addresses
additional payments to rural counties burdened by reduced tax revenue
under the Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program.

INCREASING ESA TRANSPARENCY: I recently co-sponsored legislation to
further transparency in Washington.
S. 292, the 21st Century
Endangered Species Transparency Act (ESA), which is also co-sponsored by
fellow Idaho Senator Risch (R-Idaho), would amend the Endangered
Species Act (ESA) to require the U.S. Secretaries of the Interior and
Commerce to publish on the internet data used in listing and delisting
federally endangered and threatened species.
Requiring the
Administration to be transparent about the data used for ESA listings can help
make certain that the best available science is used in an open,
public ESA listing process.
The legislation also provides
protections for personal landowner information.

CHECKING EXECUTIVE
POWERS: Government accountability is a cornerstone of a healthy and
vibrant republic.
For this reason, I support measures to ensure
any President abides by his or her constitutional duty to ensure our
laws are faithfully executed.
S. 11, the Executive Needs to
Faithfully Observe and Respect Congressional Enactments (ENFORCE) Act,
would authorize Congress to challenge directly the executive branch for
failure to properly administer the laws of the land.
