500,000 Acre Presidential Land Grab
Dear Friends,
Back in May of this year, President Obama slapped a new national monument designation on 500,000 acres of land down in New Mexico; all with the stroke of his pen and a call of his phone in spite of public opposition and obvious problems.
This area of New Mexico has known problems with human and drug trafficking and this designation will severely limit and disrupt border patrol agents operations in this area.
The designation will also hurt much needed local economic opportunities for the people of New Mexico.
In March the House passed
H.R. 1459: Ensuring Public Involvement in the Creation (EPIC) of National Monuments Act . This bill, which is still being stonewalled by the Senate, places requirements on any future use of the Antiquities Act by any president, including President Obama.
The requirements include a study to determine the cost to taxpayers and prior written approval from private property owners before any private property can be designated.
The federal government cannot effectively manage the acreage they already have. It is absurd for the President to take on even more federal land management.
Please
tell me any thoughts or concerns
you may have on this or other issues.
