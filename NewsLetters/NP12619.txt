Dear Friend-
This week, a group of bipartisan senators, business and labor leaders and veterans joined me in urging the president to approve construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.
Watch KTAL&rsquo;s report on this news:
This single project will support nearly 43,000 jobs and inject billions of dollars into our economy while reducing our dependence on oil from countries that do not share our values. Once again, another study has concluded that the Keystone XL Pipeline will have no significant impact on our environment.
This new study underscores what has been said all along about Keystone XL Pipeline:
it&rsquo;s time to build.
I urge the president to act swiftly and give final approval so we can put people to work in these good-paying jobs right away and our refineries in Louisiana and Texas can refine this energy from our close ally, Canada. It&rsquo;s time for the president to take action.
Join me in urging the president to approve construction on Keystone XL Pipeline and sign the petition.
Sincerely,
Please contact Sen. Landrieu at
the office nearest you .
