Dear David Doherty:
I will continue to meet one-on-one with constituents during mobile district office hours in Bay Point,
Saturday, June 27th from 11 am to 1 pm.
Mobile District Office Hours are one part of my efforts to be accessible to constituents. I am also holding town hall meetings and listening tours across the district.
People are busy and I want them to have easy and direct access to the information and assistance they need. Thats why, in addition to two district offices, I am continuing my long time practice of holding mobile district office hours at locations across Contra Costa County.
I will be available to share thoughts and to answer questions on federal legislation, and to assist with issues related to Social Security, the Veterans Administration, passports, or other federal agencies.
What:
