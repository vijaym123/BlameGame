The Week Just Passed: New Healthcare Law and our
Communities
At a time of year when most peoples thoughts turn to
friends and family or New Years resolutions, far too many people find
themselves worried about their health care coverage or their
job.
As you know, the Presidents health care law is already having
serious consequences for American families, driving up costs and taking
away the coverage they like and can afford.
And we have seen
evidence that the hiring of part-timers is up and the hiring of full-timers
is down
an effect of the new healthcare laws 30-hour a week
rule.
But this week there were new warning signs about the
new laws impact on many of the institutions at the very heart of our
own communities - hospitals, small businesses, schools and even
volunteer firehouses and emergency
squads!
Hospitals:
Many so-called safety-net hospitals are losing billions
of dollars in federal aid that helps cover the cost of caring for the
uninsured.
This could lead to these hospitals literally
shutting their doors in communities that really depend upon them in coming
years.
Small Businesses:
The backbone of
our local economy, employers with fewer than 20 workers make up 90% of
all businesses;
62% of all businesses have fewer than five
employees!
Yet, the Presidents new law is forcing many to cut hours
for employees, defer hiring or lay off workers due to unaffordable
costs!
Schools:
The Affordable Care Act could
soon be more costly to the school districts which must incur
additional expense to cover previously-uninsured
workers.
Students:
Some graduate students planning to work on
campus during the summer may see cuts. The 30-hour a week rule could
greatly reduce the amount of time they can be on the
job.
Local Governments : The
Washington
Post
recently reported that Many cash-strapped cities and
counties facing the prospect of shelling out hundreds of thousands of
dollars in new health-care costs under the Affordable Care Act are
opting instead to reduce the number of hours their part-time employees
work.
In addition, you will read below how many of us in
Congress are deeply concerned about the future of the volunteer fire
departments in our districts
staffed by men and women who selflessly
answer every call every day to protect the lives and safety of our
families and neighbors.
Clearly, supporters of the
Presidents new law thought the ACA would improve healthcare across the
country.
I cannot believe that they ever imagined that it could so
damage our communities in the process!
Rodney Frelinghuysen
Protecting our Emergency Responders
Thousands of
volunteer fire departments across the nation could be forced to
shut down because they cannot afford the high costs of the Presidents
new healthcare law. Due to the laws requirements, fire departments
and emergency squads must provide health insurance for volunteers
working more than 30 hours a week.
The current law stipulates that
the employer mandate must apply to organizations that have at least 50
employees, which can include multiple fire houses within one
community.
The vast majority of volunteers I speak with do not
expect to receive health insurance from their departments. Volunteer
firefighters and EMS responders do not see their work as a career or a
part-time job
its a call to serve the community, Rodney said. And I
know that volunteer fire and EMS departments operate on a shoe-string
budget and wont have the resources to pay for health insurance for
their personnel. Without this new bureaucratic burden, most departments
already have difficulty making ends meet.
Rodney
has cosponsored legislation that would exempt fire departments from
providing health insurance to volunteers. However, until the bill is
passed, fire chiefs and municipal leaders must wait to see how the
situation will be resolved. He wrote to Acting Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
Commissioner Danny Wurfel, I am deeply concerned that subjecting fire
departments and municipalities to this provision will result in
services being reduced or eliminated.
Volunteer
firefighters are vital in ensuring fire safety in New Jersey and across the
nation. The National Volunteer Fire Council reports that there are
783,300 volunteer firefighters in the U.S. comprising 70% of firefighting
force, and our nation has 20,050 volunteer departments.
