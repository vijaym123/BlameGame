Women's Health
Week
Last week marked National Women's Health week -
a weeklong observance led by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services encouraging women to prioritize their health. During this
week, I was pleased to support H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child
Protection Act. This bill would protect women and children by establishing
federal legal protections for unborn babies at 20
weeks.

below.
During Women's Health week, I was also pleased to sign
on to a bipartisan, bicameral letter, calling on the Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS) to oppose draft recommendations from the
United States Preventive Services Task Forces (USPSTF) that would make
it increasingly difficult for women to receive annual breast cancer
screenings.

House Republican
Conferences' 10 Questions with Rep. Mimi
Walters
Iran
Nuclear Agreement Review
Act
Last week, the House passed with my support the Iran Nuclear
Agreement Review Act of 2015. This bipartisan bill would prevent President
Obama from finalizing a nuclear deal and unilaterally lifting sanctions
on Iran without first receiving approval from Congress. Congress'
involvement will ensure that any potential agreement will not endanger the
national security of the United States or the survival of our close
ally, Israel.

Waters of the United States
(WOTUS) Rule
Last week, the
House passed H.R. 1732, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act of
2015. This legislation would require the Obama Administration to
withdraw the proposed Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule - a rule which
significantly expands the federal government's jurisdiction over
waters never intended for regulation, including: streams, ponds, puddles,
and ditches. This flagrant powergrab by the Obama Administration
threatens jobs, increases the cost of doing business, and heightens the
likelihood of costly litigation. The Regulatory Integrity Protection Act
would rein in the EPA's burdensome regulatory overreach and require
that a proper and transparent rulemaking process is followed in the
future.
