David -- more good news to pass along!
Last night, a big batch of ballots was counted in California&rsquo;s 52nd district. And we&rsquo;re SO happy to announce that Democrat Scott Peters has pulled in to an insurmountable lead! The Republicans wanted to win this historically-red district BADLY: -- Boehner&rsquo;s NRCC spent $2.7 million
-- Rove&rsquo;s American Crossroads spent $7OO,OOO.OO
-- The Koch brothers&rsquo; Americans for Prosperity spent $242,OOO.OO
So what made the final difference?
YOU. Your donations and volunteer hours allowed us to reach out to key voters in this race over
64,000
times. 64,950 Door Knocks and Phone Calls
And the latest margin in this race? 4,491 votes We just can&rsquo;t say it enough: your grassroots support literally made the difference between victory and defeat in these races. UPDATE: A few minutes ago, we learned that we also won California's 9th District!!! That means of the 14 races that were too-close-to-call on Election Night:
