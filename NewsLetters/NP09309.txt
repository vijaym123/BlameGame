Ensuring Our Vets Receive Health Care they Deserve
Dear Friend,
Recent reports of mismanagement at veterans&rsquo; clinics are completely inexcusable.
This issue has my full attention and people responsible need to be held accountable. That&rsquo;s why yesterday I passed a provision in a Veterans bill that would give the secretary of Veterans Affairs the tools necessary to fire senior officials responsible for the reported mismanagement.
There were no lines when our brave men and women signed up to serve, there should be no lines when they return home to receive the care they have already earned.
In return for the sacrifices our veterans and their families make in service to our country, they deserve the best care America has to offer. Ensuring they receive the quality care that they have more than earned is going to take strong leadership and accountability at the VA.
Also in this vets bill, I was able to secure a provision that will allow Veterans in communities without a VA clinic, like those in Southwest Louisiana, to receive care from local medical providers and hospitals in their local communities until the clinics in Lafayette and Lake Charles are green-lighted.
The veterans who call Southwest Louisiana home cannot wait any longer to have access to quality healthcare in their local communities that they have been promised.
This effort is a bridge to provide local and quality care as quickly as possible.
I will continue leading our delegation&rsquo;s efforts to ensure our veterans receive the healthcare they have earned and deserve.
Happy Memorial Day,
