Foxx Fights to Lower College Costs
The hardest part of a college education shouldnt be figuring out the price.
These days, financial aid paperwork is so complicated that students often feel an advanced degree is required to know whether the education offered is worth the cost.
Sadly, its often impossible for students and parents to determine the total cost of attending college.
This summer, future college students are thinking about everything from choosing majors to decorating dorm rooms.
Amid many decisions big and small, taking time to fully understand the costs associated with college attendance can be an aggravating task that may get put off and ultimately ignored, often with disastrous consequences.
As Chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training in the House of Representatives, I am working with my colleagues to reauthorize and reform the Higher Education Act (HEA) in a way that will help make paying for college simple and straightforward. On July 10, my Committee favorably reported three bills that improve the HEA by supporting innovation, enhancing financial counseling, and simplifying the student aid process.
Each of these bills has since passed the full House of Representatives with bipartisan support and been sent to the Senate for consideration.
H.R. 3136,
the Advancing Competency-Based Education Demonstration Project Act.
o
This bipartisan legislation will provide students new opportunities to receive a high-quality education in a way that best serves their personal and financial needs.

My goal is to make the dream of earning a college degree more accessible to Americas students.
Hopefully the Senate will consider and pass these bills before heading home in August.
You can follow the progress of this reauthorization on the Education and Workforce Committees website at:

It is my hope that you will share with me any suggestions you may have as we continue to work on these important issues.
