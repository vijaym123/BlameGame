Congressman McHenry Weekly Update
Another Busy Day in NC-10
I concluded a busy week across the 10th District by spending a day in Gaston County.
The day began with a hardhat tour of the new CaroMont Regional Medical Center in Mount Holly which is slated to serve the emergency medical needs of northeast Gaston County.
Following the tour I had the opportunity to address the difficulties faced by America's middle class at a meeting of the Mount Holly Rotary Club at Discover YOU! in Mount Holly.
That afternoon I began by visiting the Cramerton Fire Department where I met with Fire Chief Lance Foulk, Mayor Ronnie Worley, Town Manager Michael Peoples, and State Representative Dana Bumgardner.
Later I had the honor of participating in the groundbreaking for Phase II of the bridge project at Goat Island Park in Cramerton.
Joining me for the groundbreaking were State Senator Kathy Harrington, State Representative Dana Bumgardner, and numerous Cramerton town leaders.
I concluded my day by visiting Allen Millican's Pictorial Museum in Belmont.
While there Allen showed me around the museum which includes thousands of historic photographs from Gaston County and the surrounding area.

America's Middle Class Continues to Struggle
After having spent the last week meeting with constituents across the 10th District a few common themes emerged: folks are frustrated with our government and the direction of the nation but more importantly, the middle class is struggling to get by.
While the price of gas and groceries continues to go up, wages are stagnant and full-time work is becoming increasingly hard to find.
This week, I wrote an op-ed for Red Alert Politics on the middle class' struggles.

125th Soldiers Reunion in Newton
Today marks the start of the 125th annual Soldiers' Reunion in Newton.
This week-long event is thought to be one of the oldest patriotic events in the United States that is not associated with a holiday.
The first reunion was held on July 4th, 1889 when Civil War veterans gathered in Newton to be recognized for their service and sacrifice.
Held annually since, the reunion features a variety of events including car shows, parades, and a beauty pageant.

Newton's website .

What I Have Been Reading
Made By Southern Hands: Furniture
Southern Living
While much of the furniture industry has left Western North Carolina and the Triad area, there are still numerous places making high-quality, handmade furniture in and around the 10th District.
This list courtesy of Southern Living is a testament to that as furniture made in Hickory, Newton, and Asheville was featured.
10 Great Beers Unique to North Carolina
Men's Journal
While breweries have been popping up throughout North Carolina, the Asheville-area still remains the epicenter of craft beer in North Carolina.
This list of great North Carolina beers is evidence of that with Asheville breweries prominently featured.
No wonder Asheville has been nicknamed Beer City USA.
