Weekly Column: It's Time To Build The Keystone Pipeline
This past week, the Department of Labor issued its latest unemployment
report and the news wasn't good. Employers added far fewer jobs than
economists predicted, and the unemployment rate ticked down, indicating
that our labor force continues to shrink.
At a time when our economy remains stagnant and our labor force
participation rate is the lowest it has been in years, it is critical
that we enact policies that encourage growth and incite investment.
This includes construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, which will lead
to the creation of thousands of American jobs, lower fuel prices, and
our energy independence. Read full column HERE
