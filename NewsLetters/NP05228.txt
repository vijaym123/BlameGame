Dear Friend,
We work hard to ensure that our children will someday have economic opportunities.
Unfortunately, one of the greatest threats to our childrens future is Washingtons addiction to spending.
With our debt teetering on the verge of $18 trillion, every American taxpayer has the right to feel frustrated and angry at the lack of serious effort to rein in spending.
Every day, middle-class New Jersey families are learning to do more with less. Its time for Washington to do the same.
Think about it. Every time you go to the grocery store, you spend more and get less for it. Every time you fill up at the gas station, you spend more and get less for it.
But when any serious spending-reduction plans come before the Senate and the president, they never get the consideration they deserve.
This is not fair, and it needs to change.
While the House of Representatives has advanced a number of proposals to address our debt, the president has chosen to stick his head in the sand rather than lead.
The presidents approach will not keep our nation fiscally sound nor strategically secure.
Theres no way to deny it, every dollar our country borrows will come out of the pockets of our children.
In fact, every American currently owes $56,042.
This is a burden that will weigh down future generations and jeopardize the opportunities that we have worked so hard to preserve for them.
Washington needs to get serious about cutting wasteful spending and delivering a more efficient, effective government to the American people.
Lets tackle the debt problem now to ensure the American Dream will live on for our children.
Sincerely,
Scott Garrett
