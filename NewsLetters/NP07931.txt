Greetings,
As many of you know, Texas is seeing the devastating consequences of President Obama's immigration policies. For too long, Washington has sent a signal to the world that those who come here illegally will be given amnesty.
We must put an end to this and demonstrate our commitment to securing the border.
Please continue speaking out. Together we must make DC listen and make your concerns heard in our nation's capital.
All the best,
Ted Cruz

&ldquo;Amnesty is unfolding before our very eyes,&rdquo; Sen. Cruz said. &ldquo;And I would suggest the only response that will stop this humanitarian disaster is for President Obama to start enforcing the law, to stop promising amnesty, to stop refusing to enforce federal immigration law and finally to secure the borders. Indeed, I would call upon our colleagues in this body in both parties to come together and secure the border once and for all and to stop holding border security hostage for amnesty.&rdquo;

Sen. Cruz files a Bill to Pursue Justice for U.S. Teen Kidnapped in Israel
On Wednesday, Sen. Cruz filed
legislation
to offer a reward of up to $5 million for information on or the capture of the Hamas terrorists who kidnapped and murdered Naftali Fraenkel, an Israeli-U.S. citizen, on June 12, 2014. Rep. Doug Lamborn, CO-05, has filed bipartisan companion legislation in the House, co-sponsored by Rep. Brad Sherman, CA-30, lead Democrat on the bill. Naftali was one of three Jewish teens who was killed by Hamas terrorists, along with Gilad Shaer and Eyal Yifrach.
&ldquo;The Israeli government&rsquo;s recent action against Hamas is a just and appropriate mission to both bring the terrorists responsible to justice, and to degrade their capability to launch further attacks,&rdquo; Sen. Cruz said. &ldquo;No one doubts Israel&rsquo;s ability to carry out this mission, but given Naftali&rsquo;s citizenship, I believe the United States should demonstrate our clear support for Israel by offering a reward as we traditionally have in terrorist attacks involving Americans. This support should be understood in the context of our partnership with the nation of Israel in the fight against radical Islamic terrorism, which is our fight as well. I&rsquo;m proud to work with Congressman Lamborn on this legislation.&rdquo;

Sen. Cruz: These are the Fahrenheit 451 Democrats

He asked Senate Democrats three questions:
Should Congress be able to ban books?
Should Congress be able to ban films?
Should Congress be able to prohibit the NAACP from speaking about politics?
The Democrats failed to answer.
Senator Cruz also published an
op-ed in the
Washington Times
this week underscoring the danger of such an amendment to individuals&rsquo; free speech. See excerpts below.
&ldquo;Forty-six Senate Democrats are willing to rewrite the Constitution to take away the right of Americans to speak or create art that is critical of politicians.&rdquo;
&ldquo;They are playing with fire. &lsquo;Fahrenheit 451&rsquo; is coming to life, and tragically, the Democrats are playing the role of the firemen who want to burn our books and silence the citizenry.&rdquo;
