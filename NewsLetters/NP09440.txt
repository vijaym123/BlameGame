"Our debt to the heroic men and valiant women in the service of our
country can never be repaid.
They have earned our undying gratitude.
America will never forget their sacrifices."
- President Harry S.
Truman

On this Memorial Day weekend, as you gather with family and friends to
celebrate the start of summer, let us all pause to remember that our
freedom was not easily won.
It was won with the blood and sacrifice of
hundreds of thousands of selfless men and women we honor on Memorial
Day.
These young men and women believed in the strength of our nation
and thought it was worth dying for.
Every minute of every day, American soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines
and Coast Guardsmen voluntarily risk their lives so that you and I can
live in freedom.
We not only owe these American heroes a debt we can
never repay, we owe them our appreciation and support. I'd like to
especially thank the many men and women in the 25th District of Texas
who have answered the call of service and willingly fight to protect
our great country.
This week in Congress, we have taken several important steps to support
our troops, past and present.
Most recently, the House passed the
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)
,
which authorizes funding for the military.
After working with many of
my Texas colleagues, we were able to add language in this bill that
would make the victims of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting eligible to
receive the Purple Heart under newly passed criteria.
This recognition
is long overdue for the families and loved ones of those killed and
injured in the horrific attack.
The Senate has followed suit and
included this provision in their NDAA bill, which will soon come up for
a vote.
These men and women were victims of a terrorist attack and
should be treated as such.

I am excited to share great news that the Senate has passed a bill I
sponsored to designate the Post Office in Burleson, TX, as the "Sergeant
William Moody Post Office Building" in recognition of our very own
hometown hero.
This bill now goes to the President's desk, where it
will soon be signed into law.
Though it is a small gesture in
comparison to the sacrifice of Sgt. Moody, it has been a distinct honor
to tell his story in Washington.
To hear his story, you can listen
here
.
Please keep his wife and children in
your prayers.

On Wednesday, the House passed the Department of Veterans Affairs
Management Accountability Act
to hold
officials accountable for the deplorable misconduct and mismanagement
at the VA.
The agency-wide problems that have recently come to light
are shameful and a disservice to all who wear the uniform.
I have been
in contact with VA officials, both local and federal, to make sure our
Texas clinics and offices are investigated and held accountable.
The
last thing our nation's heroes should have to worry about is getting
lost in layers of bureaucracy when it comes to their healthcare.

This weekend, will you reach out to say "thanks" to a service member?
America is the greatest country on Earth because of their service.
God
bless you, and God bless our troops.
Sincerely,
Roger Williams
Member of Congress

&#8220;Our

to
the
heroic

in
the
service
of
our

never
be

They

America

&#8211;
President
Harry
S.
Truman
On
this
Memorial
Day
weekend,
as
you
gather
with
family
and
friends
to
celebrate
the
start
of
summer,
let
us
all
pause
to
remember
that
our
freedom
was
not
easily
won.
It
was
won
with
the
blood
and
sacrifice
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
selfless
men
and
women
we
honor
on
Memorial
Day.
These
young
men
and
women
believed
in
the
strength
of
our
nation
and
thought
it
was
worth
dying
for.
Every
minute
of
every
day,
American
soldiers,
sailors,
airmen,
Marines
and
Coast
Guardsmen
voluntarily
risk
their
lives
so
that
you
and
I
can
live
in
freedom.
We
not
only
owe
these
American
heroes
a
debt
we
can
never
repay,
we
owe
them
our
appreciation
and
support.
I&#8217;d
like
to
especially
thank
the
many
men
and
women
in
the
25th
District
of
Texas
who
have
answered
the
call
of
service
and
willingly
fight
to
protect
our
great
country.
This
week
in
Congress,
we
have
taken
several
important
steps
to
support
our
troops,
past
and
present.
Most
recently,
the
House
passed
the
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
(NDAA) ,
which
authorizes
funding
for
the
military.
After
working
with
many
of
my
Texas
colleagues,
we
were
able
to
add
language
in
this
bill
that
would
make
the
victims
of
the
2009
Fort
Hood
shooting
eligible
to
receive
the
Purple
Heart
under
newly
passed
criteria.
This
recognition
is
long
overdue
for
the
families
and
loved
ones
of
those
killed
and
injured
in
the
horrific
attack.
The
Senate
has
followed
suit
and
included
this
provision
in
their
NDAA
bill,
which
will
soon
come
up
for
a
vote.
These
men
and
women
were
victims
of
a
terrorist
attack
and
should
be
treated
as
such.
I
am
excited
to
share
great
news
that
the
Senate
has
passed
a
bill
I
sponsored
to
designate
the
Post
Office
in
Burleson,
TX,
as
the
&#8220;Sergeant
William
Moody
Post
Office
Building&#8221;
in
recognition
of
our
very
own
hometown
hero.
This
bill
now
goes
to
the
President&#8217;s
desk,
where
it
will
soon
be
signed
into
law.
Though
it
is
a
small
gesture
in
comparison
to
the
sacrifice
of
Sgt.
Moody,
it
has
been
a
distinct
honor
to
tell
his
story
in
Washington.
To
hear
his
story,
you
can
listen
here .
Please
keep
his
wife
and
children
in
your
prayers.
On
Wednesday,
the
House
passed
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
Management
Accountability
Act
to
hold
officials
accountable
for
the
deplorable
misconduct
and
mismanagement
at
the
VA.
The
agency-wide
problems
that
have
recently
come
to
light
are
shameful
and
a
disservice
to
all
who
wear
the
uniform.
I
have
been
in
contact
with
VA
officials,
both
local
and
federal,
to
make
sure
our
Texas
clinics
and
offices
are
investigated
and
held
accountable.
The
last
thing
our
nation&#8217;s
heroes
should
have
to
worry
about
is
getting
lost
in
layers
of
bureaucracy
when
it
comes
to
their
healthcare.
This
weekend,
will
you
reach
out
to
say
&#8220;thanks&#8221;
to
a
service
member?
America
is
the
greatest
country
on
Earth
because
of
their
service.
God
bless
you,
and
God
bless
our
troops.
Sincerely,
Roger
Williams Member
of
Congress
