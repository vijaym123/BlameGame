Let&rsquo;s not mince words here: the Koch Brothers reportedly spent $290 million dollars in the 2014 election -- and it paid off. It&rsquo;s a DEVASTATING blow for American democracy. It&rsquo;s time to put an end to unfair campaign finance laws that have allowed the ultra-rich to rig our elections.
