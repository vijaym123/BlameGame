Dear Friends,
Each New Year brings a time to remember the life and honor the work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Today, our nation comes together in celebration of his legacy and recommits itself to continuing his mission of equality for every American.
Since last fall, the Library of Congress has worked to highlight one of the most important pieces of legislation in our nation&rsquo;s history, made possible by the leadership of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Following the tireless efforts of Dr. King and many other brave Americans, the
Civil Rights Act of 1964
outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. I encourage you to take today as an opportunity to learn more about the important work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and others who truly made our country a better place.
Click here for several resources &ndash; including timelines, photographs, and video &ndash; on the Civil Rights Act of 1964 .
In order to move forward, we must understand where we&rsquo;ve come from. Our progress towards freedom for all Americans comes from decades of sacrifice like that of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. that we must continue to learn from, protect, and strengthen today.
Sincerely,
