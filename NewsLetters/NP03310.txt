Dear Friend,
I&rsquo;ve always said that the Internet is our most democratic medium, but that will only remain true so long as all content is treated equally.
Without net neutrality, a level playing field gets tilted, perhaps irrevocably, toward companies that can afford to pay to have their content delivered at faster speeds. The FCC is set to issue rules on net neutrality in February.
If we want them to protect it, we need to act. Sign our petition and tell the FCC to protect consumers and innovators by enshrining net neutrality.
My colleagues and I are organizing this petition in part because our previous efforts have worked so well. Alongside activists from coast to coast, we&rsquo;ve brought net neutrality to national prominence, and we&rsquo;ve made our case to the American people about the need for a level playing field online. That&rsquo;s a credit to you and all of our allies in this fight. Now, we need to finish the job.
The FCC needs to know that we are watching, and that we will not allow a few large companies to strangle one of our most valuable sources of innovation and job growth. Net neutrality allowed companies like Google, Hulu, and Facebook to become household names, creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs in the process -- we must protect an open Internet for the next generation of entrepreneurs and risk-takers. The Internet does not belong only to those who can pay for preferential treatment. Join me and demand that the FCC protect net neutrality.
Thank you,
Ed
