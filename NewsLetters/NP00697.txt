Say Thank You on Memorial Day
In addition to having a fun and safe Memorial Day weekend, let's all take the chance to reflect upon and remember those who gave their lives so we can be free. At noon on every Memorial Day, the flag is raised from half-staff to commemorate those who never came home, to full-staff symbolizing our nations dedication to fight for, and defend, the principles laid out over two centuries ago: That all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.
I am privileged to represent so many past and present service members and their families. To the men and women who never came home from Valley Forge, Chapultepec, Gettysburg, Belleau Wood, the islands of the Pacific, Europe, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, and throughout the world, the people of the 27 th
district of Texas will never, ever forget what you have done for us.

Some of the topics I will be discussing are immigration, veterans' issues, our economy, infrastructure funding, and how we can reign in governmental overreach. Please swing by any of my roundtables and I look forward to see y'all around the district.
