House of Representatives Passes Legislation to Combat Human Trafficking
[VIDEO]
Last week Kevin spoke on the floor of the House of Representatives
urging members of both parties to support legislation to combat human
trafficking. Later that day the House passed five anti-human
trafficking bills.
"The horrific nature of this crime can shock individuals and
communities to such a degree that they are unable to conceive such
heinous acts are even possible, much less taking place right in their
rural communities. All around the country, law enforcement and public
citizens are encountering difficulties in identifying human trafficking
victims, and our justice system is too often ill-equipped to assign the
appropriate penalties for a fast-growing international crime such as
human trafficking. What's worse, too often the victims are treated as
criminals, dropped into a judicial system not equipped to provide the
health and protective services these women and girls often need," Kevin
said on the House floor. [READ MORE]

Kevin Votes for Accountability at Veterans Affairs
The Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act of
2014 enforces greater accountability at the VA by giving the Secretary
of Veterans Affairs direct authority to remove or demote senior
executives.
Kevin said of the legislation: "The misconduct we are learning of is
absolutely abhorrent and demands a full investigation. It is even more
obvious we need this reform after President Obama's attempt today to
lay blame on previous administrations and suggest he is doing
everything he can while not even holding his cabinet secretary
accountable. This is just the latest in a pattern of disregard for
accountability in the executive branch which has affected the NSA, the
IRS, and now our own veterans. I don't believe the American people
tolerate it, North Dakotans certainly don't tolerate it, and I don't
tolerate it. I certainly hope Harry Reid will allow this bipartisan
bill to have a vote in the Senate." [READ MORE]

House Legislation Ends Mass Collection of Americans' Phone Records
The House of Representatives has passed legislation to end the bulk
collection of Americans' phone records and impose other limitations on
government intelligence gathering.
"National security remains the number one priority of the federal
government, however the bulk collection of our phone records is a
violation of Americans' privacy. We should still expect certain records
to be gathered when terrorism is suspected, but now an independent
court will be charged with overseeing the process on a case-by-case
basis. While I wish it more closely resembled the bill as originally
introduced, this is still a positive step forward for personal liberty
and privacy," said Kevin.

House Awards Congressional Gold Medal to ND Veterans
The House of Representatives passed legislation cosponsored by Kevin to
award the Congressional Gold Medal to ten North Dakota airmen.
The American Fighter Aces Congressional Gold Medal Act awards the medal
to pilots who served honorably and destroyed five or more confirmed
enemy aircraft. Of 60,000 U.S. military fighter pilots, less than 1,500
have this distinction as American Fighter Aces. Ten of these less than
1,500 are from North Dakota: Leonard Check of Berwick, Francis Register
of Bismarck, Leland Molland of Chaffee, John Donaldson of Fort Yates,
Lloyd Heinzen of Garrison, Oscar Coen of Hannaford, Alfred Frendberg of
Hillsboro, Donald Baccus of Jamestown, Harvey Picken of Minot, Laurence
Blumer of Walcott, and Clarence Borley of Williston. [CONTINUE READING]

Grand Forks Student Wins Congressional Art Competition
Alizjah Swenson, a senior at Grand Forks Central High School, is the
North Dakota winner of the 2014 Congressional Art Competition. After
submitting her entry to the North Dakota Juried Student Art Show at the
Taube Museum of Art in Minot, it was chosen by professional artists to
represent the state of North Dakota in the nation's capital.
The colored pencil entry titled "Canola" portrays a canola field found
on a rural, eastern North Dakota landscape. After being on display at
the Taube Museum of Art during the month of April, her piece will now
be displayed in the U.S. Capitol Building for the next year. Swenson
will attend a winners' reception in Washington, D.C. in June. [READ

Kevin to EPA: Change Course on Water Regulation
Kevin is calling on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to change
course on their proposed "Waters of the U.S." rule which would have a
disruptive impact on landowners, water users, or any variety of
construction.
On March 25, the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers released a proposed
rule which would grant the government unprecedented regulatory
authority over nearly all bodies of water including small ponds,
creeks, ditches, and other occasionally wet areas, including those
found on private property.
Kevin is encouraging citizens to submit their comments on the proposed
rule at this link.
A state Farm Bureau has released a video parodying the EPA's overreach
.

that

All

encountering
difficulties
in

our
justice

What's
worse,
too

the

are
treated
as
criminals,
dropped
into
a
judicial
system
not
equipped
to
provide
the
health

often
need,&#8221; Kevin

Votes
for
Accountability
at
Veterans
Affairs
The
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
Management
Accountability
Act
of
2014
enforces
greater
accountability
at
the
VA
by
giving the
Secretary
of
Veterans
Affairs
direct
authority
to
remove
or
demote
senior
executives.
Kevin
said
of
the
legislation:
&#8220;The
misconduct
we
are
learning
of
is
absolutely
abhorrent
and
demands
a
full
investigation.
It
is
even
more
obvious
we
need
this
reform
after
President
Obama&#8217;s
attempt
today
to
lay
blame
on
previous
administrations
and
suggest
he
is
doing
everything
he
can
while
not
even
holding
his
cabinet
secretary
accountable.
This
is
just
the
latest
in
a
pattern
of
disregard
for
accountability
in
the
executive
branch
which
has
affected
the
NSA,
the
IRS,
and
now
our
own
veterans.
I
don&#8217;t
believe
the
American
people
tolerate
it,
North
Dakotans
certainly
don&#8217;t
tolerate
it,
and
I
don&#8217;t
tolerate
it.
I
certainly
hope
Harry
Reid
will
allow
this
bipartisan
bill
to
have
a
vote
in
