Dear Friend,
I wanted to remind you that Primary Election Day is tomorrow, May 20.
Voting is one of the most critical rights granted to us as U.S.
citizens.
Below is information you may find useful concerning voting in
Pennsylvania.
The phone number for the Montgomery County Board of Elections is
610-278-3275 and the phone number for the Philadelphia City
Commissioners is 215-686-1591.
Identification: Pennsylvania requires voters voting for the first time
in a polling place to present approved identification. Acceptable photo
identification includes, PA driver's license or ID card issued by
PennDOT, ID issued by any other Commonwealth agency, ID issued by the
U.S. Government, U.S. Passport, U.S. Armed Forces ID, Student ID, or an
employee ID.
Acceptable non-photo identification forms includes voter's
identification card issued by the voter registration commission,
non-photo ID issued by the Commonwealth, non-photo ID issued by the
U.S. Government, firearm permit, current utility bill, current bank
statement, current paycheck, or a government check. Non-photo ID must
include your name and address. If you don't have any of these items at
the polls, you can still request a provisional ballot.
PLEASE NOTE: ONLY FIRST-TIME VOTERS ARE REQUIRED TO SHOW ID.
Election Day Hours: Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. If you are in
line at 8 p.m., you can vote!
How to Vote: Voting systems vary county by county in Pennsylvania. For
more information on the system used in your county or city visit the
Pennsylvania Department of State's web page on county voting systems.
Polling Place Locations: The location of your polling place is listed
on your voter identification card. If you are unsure of your polling
place location contact your local board of elections or visit
http://guide.seventy.org/
.
Look for information: Polling stations are required to provide public
notice of voting rights, information on how to use the voting machines,
and information on how to file a complaint if you believe your rights
have been violated.
Ask questions: Polling workers are on hand to answer questions you may
have concerning your right to vote and the voting process. If you have
questions about how to use a voting machine or would like to request a
provisional ballot, ask a polling worker for help. Polling workers can
also direct you to the correct polling place if you are at the wrong
voting precinct.
Provisional voting: If your name doesn't appear on the voter
registration list or you have forgotten to bring an ID to the polls,
under Pennsylvania law you can still vote by asking for a provisional
ballot. After you have completed the provisional ballot, you will be
provided with a provisional ballot receipt that will include
information on how you can check to see if your vote counted. Within
three days after the election, Pennsylvania county or city election
officials will review the ballot to determine whether or not it
counted. You should contact the phone number listed on the provisional
ballot receipt to check if your ballot was counted or disqualified. You
will be asked for the identification number listed on your provisional
ballot, so remember to keep your provisional ballot receipt.
