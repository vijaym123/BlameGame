Granite Staters Going for the Gold!
Hi Everyone!
I hope you all had a great long weekend. I spent last week in
Washington, working for Granite State priorities.
NH Athletes Competing in Sochi, Russia
New Hampshire has the second most Olympians per capita of any state in
country at the 2014 Games, with 13 athletes competing and one athlete
per every 146,000 Granite Staters. Team USA is a talented group of
athletes who work hard to represent our nation in the global community
and it has been a pleasure to watch them go for the gold throughout the
Sochi Games. I am so proud of our native Olympians and wish them luck
as the Olympics Games continue! (You can learn more about New
Hampshire's Olympians here
).
Join me for a Career and Opportunities Fair in Concord!
I am hosting a Career and Opportunities Fair
this month to help connect
local residents with jobs and employment opportunities throughout the
Granite State. The event will be held from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm on
Thursday, February 20th, at the Holiday Inn at 172 N. Main St. in
Concord. It will feature employers from the manufacturing, recreation,
energy, transportation, and health care industries, among others.
My top priority in Congress is helping create jobs and opportunity for
New Hampshire's middle class families. That's what this job fair is all
about - connecting local job seekers with a wide variety of New
Hampshire employers who are looking to grow their businesses and hire
new workers. Job seekers wishing to attend the Career and Opportunities
Fair can register here
.
With Kathy on her delivery route
Honoring New Hampshire's Hard Working Citizens
Last Monday morning, I took a tour of the Nashua UPS facility and
recognized long-time UPS delivery workers for their exemplary history
of service and safe driving records.
The tour was hosted by the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
After the tour, I joined UPS
driver Kathy Kamer on her delivery route, and helped deliver packages
to Nashua residents.
UPS drivers have the unique opportunity of
interacting directly with members of their community on a daily basis,
and I had a great time catching up with Nashua residents.
Ms. Bartlett with her father's medals
Helping Granite Staters
I was recently contacted by Lenis Bartlett of Goshen about a number of
medals her father had earned in World War II that had been missing for
many years. Her father, Sergeant Howard Bartlett, fought courageously
and received many decorations, including a Purple Heart, a Bronze Star,
a Good Conduct Medal, a European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal
with 1 Silver Service Star, a World War II Victory Medal, a Combat
Infantryman Badge 1st Award, and an Honorable Service Lapel Button. All
of these medals had been missing since Sergeant Bartlett passed away
and my staff was able to retrieve them and return them to Lenis. If my
office may ever be of assistance with a problem you are facing, please
contact my staff at 603-226-1002 so we may help you resolve your
problem or get you the information you need.
Have a fantastic week and thanks for everything you do to make New
Hampshire such a great place to live!
