Friends,
I had a busy week in the district meeting with businesses,
community groups, and constituents across our area last week.
One of the highlights of the week was the
groundbreaking ceremony
for Carolina Bays
the Highway
31 Extension and Highway 707 Widening Project.
You sent me
to Washington to help with the Seventh Districts significant
infrastructure needs and I have promised to do just that.
On Wednesday,
I was thrilled to attend the ribbon cutting ceremony and join fellow
community leaders in putting the first few shovels in the
ground.
We have worked hard to make this a reality for our district, and I
am proud of the jobs this project is bringing to the
area.
Earlier this week, I met with community
leaders and discussed federal and local issues with the Murrells Inlet
Rotary Club.
I also spoke about the importance of working with
Israel to preserve our Worlds precious religious artifacts and promote
peace in the region at the Christians United for Israels (CUFI)
Night to Honor Israel.
I sat down with Tim McGinnis last week to
discuss current federal issues and the Affordable Care Act. Our
conversation aired earlier this morning on Carolina This Week. If you missed
