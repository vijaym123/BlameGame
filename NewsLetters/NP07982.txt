Dear Friends,
With the immigration crisis roiling the southern border and President Obama seemingly paralyzed to act, I am supporting an effort in the House of Representatives to amend
a 2008 law
originally meant to combat sex trafficking
that is exacerbating the problem. The change would accelerate the screening and repatriation of many unaccompanied children who cross the border illegally. This crisis demands immediate action from
both Congress and the President to address growing threats to public safety and to our national security.
On a lighter note, I had some special guests in D.C. this week
my wife and daughters came from our home in Tulare to visit me. My daughters had some interesting meetings
here, including one with Senator Tim Scott and Rep. Trey Gowdy, and another with NASCAR driver Kurt Busch.
Seems like they enjoyed making some new friends.
Separately, if you missed my recent articles on U.S. national security, you can read them
