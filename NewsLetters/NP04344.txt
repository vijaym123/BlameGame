I can sum up President Obamas executive action on immigration in two words: Staggering. Arrogance.
This is not a dispute between the Administration and Republicans, this is between the Administration and the Constitution of the United States.
The House Judiciary Committee is prepared to use every tool at its disposal to fight the Presidents planned executive amnesty.
I strongly support Chairman Goodlattes leadership in this fight.

Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. -
For me, no amnesty means no amnesty. I have long opposed, and will continue to oppose, amnesty of any form. Learn more about my work,
