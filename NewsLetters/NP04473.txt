Why Keystone XL Is Not In Our National Interest
Dear Friends,
Today,
I will go to the Senate floor
to make the case for why approving the Keystone XL Pipeline is not in our national interest. This pipeline would transport Canadian tar sands oil, which is 15-20% dirtier than conventional oil. We need to continue the transition from dirty energy to cleaner energy &ndash; quickly enough to preempt serious harm to the climate, while allowing enough time for our economy to adjust. This is particularly relevant in Virginia where drastic increases in sea level rise pose a serious threat to the Hampton Roads economy and the center of American naval power.
Keystone XL would take us in the opposite direction of where we need to go, which is generating cleaner energy tomorrow than we do today.
We can do better.
You can watch my Senate floor speech
here
at 4:15 PM.
Sincerely,
Senator Tim Kaine
