Dear Friend,
Next week,
Congress breaks for its annual summer recess period.
I will begin
a busy month of traveling around Indianapolis meeting with
community members and organizations committed to making our city a safe and enjoyable place to live.
I am looking forward to spending August visiting with hard working Hoosiers and sharing ideas about how we can work together to solve the issues we all face.
Stay tuned to my
website
and social media pages to learn more about what I am doing in your neighborhood in the coming weeks.
In addition, I hope you will join me August 6, at Ivy Tech Corporate College and Culinary Center (2820
N. Meridian St.) for my
5 th
annual job fair .
As always, if there is something
I can do for you, please call my office and let me know how I can help.
Sincerely,
Andr&eacute; Carson

ICYMI: Recognizing a Local Hero
Last week I had the privilege of calling 8-year-old J acen Troxell from my office in Washington, D.C., to thank him for his work in helping to keep our Indianapolis law enforcement officers safe. He has raised over $13,000 to help cover the cost of updating bulletproof vests for the Indianapolis Metro Police Department.
Thank you, Jacen! Keep up the good work!
