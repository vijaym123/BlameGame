Dear
David,
As we
were reminded this week with the third confirmed case of Ebola on
American soil, we must do everything possible to contain this deadly disease
at its source.
Implementing reasonable travel restrictions
is one way that Ebola can and should be contained.
I
support a temporary suspension of travel visas for passengers traveling
from impacted countries in West Africa.
This is a critical
issue, and I urge President Obama to implement these common-sense
restrictions immediately.
Please join this important discussion
online by sharing your thoughts and concerns on my
Facebook
page, on
Twitter ,
Instagram , and on
YouTube .
Sincere
regards,
