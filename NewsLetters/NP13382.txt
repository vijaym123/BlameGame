As families and loved ones gather across the 8th District to celebrate
the birth of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, I want to extend a
sincere and heartfelt Merry Christmas to you and your family.
Christmas is a season of hope and joy, a time to give thanks for the
blessing of Christ's birth and for all of the many blessings and we
enjoy all year long.
As we share the joy of this special day, let us also remember those who
can't be home this Christmas. Especially the brave men and women in
uniform who sacrifice so much to defend our freedoms, here at home and
battlefields around the globe. We ask God to watch over them and their
families, and pray for their safe return home.
Wishing you and your family a very Merry Christmas. May you have a safe
and happy holiday.
