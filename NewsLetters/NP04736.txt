BREAKING POLLS: North Carolina (+ 2), Arkansas (+1), Iowa (+1), Colorado (+1), Georgia (tie).
PITCH IN NOW TO HELP DEMS WIN &gt;&gt;
Friend -- The battle for the Senate is effectively tied with 30 hours left. SIX races are polling within TWO points -- but if we win just three, we&rsquo;ll win the entire Senate!
Nate Silver reports, &ldquo;Democrats are still in the game,&rdquo; but &ldquo;uncertainty abounds&rdquo; as to the outcome.
With only 30 hours until Election Day, this is our FINAL CHANCE to take the lead and WIN.
That&rsquo;s going to take every single grassroots supporter stepping up.
Even if you&rsquo;ve already pitched in -- we REALLY appreciate it, but we have to ask again.
Simply put, if you don&rsquo;t help out now, we could lose and get a Mitch McConnell-led Senate.
Will you donate so we can break the tie and WIN this election? Time is quickly running out. Give today and we&rsquo;ll triple-match your gift!
