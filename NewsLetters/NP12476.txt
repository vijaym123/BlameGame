Congressman Perry to Hold Town Meetings
YORK, PA
To offer our constituents the opportunity to share their concerns regarding issues before the United States Congress and the federal government, U.S. Representative Scott Perry (PA-4) will be hosting a series of town meetings over the next two next weeks.
The dates and times of the town meetings are:
Thursday, February 13 / 11:30 a.m.
1:30 p.m.
Springettsbury Township Building, 1501 Mt Zion Rd, York
Friday, February 14 / 9-11 a.m.
- Lower Windsor Township Building, 2425 Craley Road, Wrightsville
Friday, February 14 / 1-3 p.m.

Monday, February 17 / 1:30 - 3:30 p.m.
- Hanover Hospital Wellness and Education Center, 400 York Street, Hanover
Monday, February 17 / 6:30
8:30 p.m.
HACC / Gettysburg Campus, 731 Old Harrisburg Road, Gettysburg
Constituents will be updated by Congressman Perry on the issues currently facing Congress, including the federal budget, job creation and health care. Afterwards, Congressman Perry will welcome questions on these and other federal issues.
For me to effectively represent my constituents in Congress, I regularly need
and seek - their feedback on the issues facing our country, Perry said.
These town meetings continue Congressman Perrys efforts to actively solicit constituent feedback. Since taking office in January 2013, hes met with hundreds of constituents via individual meetings and site visits, conducted several in-person town and tele-town meetings, and aggressively has utilized social media to interact with the citizens he serves. Nearly 10,000 constituents have signed up for regular updates via Congressman Perrys e-newsletter, Facebook or Twitter pages. Social media venues such as these allow him to solicit constituent feedback and provide information on the issues before Congress, while also saving hard-earned taxpayer resources.
Future town meetings will be announced in the coming months.
Residents who are unable to attend such meetings in person are welcomed to contact Congressman Perry and his staff at any of his offices, or via Perry.House.Gov, where they can sign up for e-mail updates and for his new Facebook, Twitter and You Tube pages.
