Stops on My Kansas Listening Tour
McPherson County
On Monday morning, I hosted a Kansas Listening Tour Stop in McPherson.
More than 60 area residents were at the Cedars Conference Center to
discuss a number of issues, including: the need to preserve Medicare
and Social Security, the Affordable Care Act, our nation's
unsustainable federal debt, the importance of a strong military and the
need for a functional United State Senate. I appreciated the thoughtful
questions and individual conversations. Thank you to Cedars
administrator, Leigh Peck, for organizing my visit. Special thanks to
Congressman Dick Nichols, Mayor Tom Brown and County Commissioner Duane
Patrick for joining me. For a full listing of my upcoming Kansas
Listening Tour stops, visit my website
.
Iola
On Thursday afternoon I had good company and conversation at my town
hall meeting in Iola. Discussion included VA and Veterans issues, rural
health care, costs of over-regulating community banks, ISIS and need
for military readiness, increasing cost of national debt when interest
rates begin to increase. Thanks to all who attended, including Mayor
Gene Merry, for making their opinions heard.
Eureka
On Friday afternoon my listening tour took me to Eureka, in Greenwood
County, where I met with about 20 area residents and had the chance to
hear their comments and concerns. It was an informative discussion
focused on the economy, overregulation by the federal government, ag
policy and frustration with Obamacare. Thanks to the Eureka Public
Library for allowing us to meet at the library and to Representative
Larry Hibbard for joining us. For a full listing of my upcoming Kansas
Listening Tour stops, visit my website
.
Visiting Community Hospitals in Kansas
This week, I met with hospital administrators and health care providers
at three Kansas Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) to learn more about
the consequences of sequestration, ObamaCare, increasing regulation,
and proposed changes in CAH funding and criteria on efforts to provide
quality care to patients. During my time representing Kansans in
Washington, D.C., I have had the opportunity to visit each of the 128
community hospitals in Kansas. As Ranking Member of Senate
Appropriations Health Subcommittee, which has funding jurisdiction over
most agencies within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) that impact hospitals and providers, meeting with Kansas hospital
administrators, physicians, nurses and other staff gives me important
insight on the challenges they face caring for patients.
On Tuesday I visited Holton Community Hospital (HCH). HCH provides a
wide range of services including 24-hour emergency services, skilled
nursing, OB/Maternity Care, surgical, cardiovascular, laboratory, home
health, hospice, radiology, outpatient care, and various health and
wellness programs. It was good to sit down with HCH leadership and
local officials, including Holton Mayor Robert Dieckmann, Assistant
City Manager Kerwin McKee, and former Kansas House member Becky
Hutchins. Thanks to HCH CEO, and Holton native, Carrie Saia for hosting
my visit.
Later that afternoon, I headed to Winchester to tour the F.W. Huston
Medical Center Jefferson Clinic and visit with staff. F.W. Huston also
operates clinics in Valley Falls and Perry. I appreciated the chance to
visit with administrators and health care providers about the ranges of
health services they provide to patients at their various facilities.
Thanks to the Jefferson Clinic team, including Chief Nursing Officer
Douglas Norton of Lamont, for the visit. It was also good to see
Winchester Mayor Nancy Curry and Council Member Lorraine Herring.
On Thursday morning, I visited Anderson County Hospital in Garnett
where hospital CEO Dennis Hachenberg and members of the Anderson County
Board of Trustees gave me a tour of the brand new hospital being built
directly behind the current facility. Groundbreaking on this new
hospital took place in August 2013 and the facility is set to open in
2015. The new hospital will improve health care for the community by
having two new surgical suites that will allow for more outpatient
surgeries provided by the specialists, an expanded outpatient specialty
clinic, improved ER access and function, and a space for therapy
services. I commend the community's dedication to improving health care
to residents and attracting health care professionals to Garnett. Thank
you to Dennis and his team for the tour.
Tragedy in Wichita
Four lives were tragically lost Thursday as a plane crashed into a
building at Wichita's Mid-Continent Airport. These four and their loved
ones are in my thoughts and prayers as their families and friends deal
with this most difficult time. On Friday, I met with Vice Mayor Jeff
Blubaugh, Wichita Airport Authority director Victor White and city of
Wichita government relations director Dale Goter. My purpose was to
offer sympathies, thank the first responders and offer help dealing
with federal agencies if needed.
Kansas Cosmosphere: A Leader in Applied STEM Education
I began the week in Hutchinson on Monday visiting one of our state's
great attractions, the Kansas Cosmosphere. As home to the largest
collection of international space artifacts in the world, this
Smithsonian-affiliated Cosmosphere welcomed more than 100,000 visitors
last year while offering programs for children, adults and educators.
Efforts are currently under way to focus and expand this programming so
that over the next two years, the Cosmosphere is internationally
recognized for excellence through innovative applied STEM (science,
technology, engineering and mathematics) education.
A recent study from the Partnership for a New American Economy predicts
that by 2018, America will have roughly 800,000 jobs that require STEM
skills, but only 550,000 Americans to fill those jobs. America used to
be a leader in one STEM field - engineering - but now the United States
produces just 4 percent of the world's engineering graduates each year.
The Cosmosphere is uniquely suited to help meet that need by inspiring
young people, through knowledge of space exploration, to pursue STEM
careers. I look forward to being a partner in that effort.
Thanks to the Cosmosphere leadership team for taking time to meet with
me, including Chief Executive Officer Dick Hollowell, President and
Chief Operation Officer Jim Remar, and Dr. Ed Berger, who now serves as
the Cosmosphere's chair of revitalization initiatives.
Salina Rotary Club Meeting
I joined the Salina Rotarians on Monday at the Bicentennial Center for
their weekly Monday meeting. I had the opportunity to visit with a
number of community leaders, as well as get a make-up slip to overcome
my many missed meetings for my hometown club in Hays. Thanks to Club
President Brian Boyer for allowing me to stop in.
Visiting AuBurn Pharmacy in Garnett
While in Garnett on Thursday before visiting Anderson County Hospital,
I stopped in to visit with folks at AuBurn Pharmacy. Kansas pharmacies -
quintessential community small businesses - face a variety of
regulatory challenges that are both health and business related. In
2011, I founded the Senate Community Pharmacy Caucus to advocate for
pharmacy issues and to serve as a forum for ideas and information about
the role of pharmacists as health care providers. Pharmacists have an
essential role in caring for patients by helping them manage the safe
use of medications, administering immunizations, and working
collaboratively with doctors and other health care providers to improve
care. It was a pleasure to visit with pharmacists Mike Burns, Ryan
Moore, and Nathan Wiehl and hear about how federal policy impacts
community pharmacies.
Speaking with Students at Burlington High School
Finally on Thursday I traveled to Burlington High School to visit with
students and hear about what they are learning. I stopped by two AP
American Government classes and enjoyed visiting with the students. We
discussed a range of topics including the situation in the Middle East,
how to end the gridlock in Washington, D.C, the economy and how I got
my start in public service. I was impressed with the questions the
students asked. Thanks again to Stacy for allowing me to stop by.
Concluding Breast Cancer Awareness Month
As October and National Breast Cancer Awareness Month conclude, I would
like to thank Kansas cancer survivors, their families, volunteers,
research and care advocates, and health care providers for their
tireless work to increase breast cancer screening rates throughout our
state and the country. Breast Cancer Awareness Month is intended to
increase awareness of the disease and help raise funds for important
research, prevention, diagnosis and treatment initiatives. It is
important that these efforts continue throughout the year. According to
the National Cancer Institute (NCI), more than 232,000 American women
were diagnosed with breast cancer last year. Breast cancer is the most
common non-skin cancer in the U.S. Thanks to advances in research and
screening, more women are detecting this cancer early and improving
their chances at beating the disease. Regular screening is the best way
for women to lower their risk, because breast cancer is most treatable
when it is detected early. To learn more about cancer prevention and
screening, please visit the NCI's website at www.cancer.gov
Teagarden Named Kansas Livestock Association CEO
This week in Topeka, I had the opportunity to visit with and
congratulate Matt Teagarden following the announcement that after a
nationwide search he was selected to assume the role of Chief Executive
Officer of the Kansas Livestock Association (KLA). Matt will be
following in the footsteps of long-time KLA leader, Dee Likes. For more
than three decades, Dee worked tirelessly on behalf of Kansas livestock
producers. Under his steadfast leadership, KLA truly developed into one
of the premier state livestock associations in the nation. Dee will
step aside from his current role in January, but will remain in an
advisory capacity for KLA.
While Dee leaves big shoes to fill, I could not think of a better
choice than Matt to lead KLA in the future. Matt joined KLA in 2001,
serving as director of industry relations and information technology. I
am excited about Matt's vision for the future of the association and
look forward to working with him on behalf of Kansas livestock
producers.
Kansas City Royals Make Kansans Proud
This week saw the end of a wild, exciting month for Kansas City Royals
fans across the state. Having waited 29 years for their team to reach
the playoffs, the fans united as the Royals won dramatic games with
outstanding defense and big home runs en route to the World Series. In
my travels this month, the Royals were a popular subject as many wore
their blue colors with pride. I know many farmers who listen to the
Royals while in the fields and families who take a trip to Kansas City
every summer to watch a game or two. Although Kansas City couldn't get
Alex Gordon home to tie Game 7 in the World Series, the city of Kansas
City and so many across the state are proud of what the Royals
accomplished. We'll look forward to next season!

Visiting
Community
Hospitals
in
Kansas This
week,
I
met
with
hospital
administrators
and
health
care
providers
at
three
Kansas
Critical
Access
Hospitals
(CAHs)
to
learn
more
about
the
consequences
of
sequestration,
ObamaCare,
increasing
regulation,
and
proposed
changes
in
CAH
funding
and
criteria
on
efforts
to
provide
quality
care
to
patients.
During
my
time
representing
Kansans
in
Washington,
D.C.,
I
have
had
the
opportunity
to
visit
each
of
the
128
community
hospitals
in
Kansas.
As
Ranking
Member
of
Senate
Appropriations
Health
Subcommittee,
which
has
funding
jurisdiction
over
most
agencies
within
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
(HHS)
that
impact
hospitals
and
providers,
meeting
with
Kansas
hospital
administrators,
physicians,
nurses
and
other
staff
gives
me
important
insight
on
the
challenges
they
face
caring
for
patients.
On
Tuesday
I
visited
Holton
Community
Hospital
(HCH).
HCH
provides
a
wide
range
of
services
including
24-hour
emergency
services,
skilled
nursing,
OB/Maternity
Care,
surgical,
cardiovascular,
laboratory,
home
health,
hospice,
radiology,
outpatient
care,
and
various
health
and
wellness
programs.
It
was
good
to
sit
down
with
HCH
leadership
and
local
officials,
including
Holton
Mayor
Robert
Dieckmann,
Assistant
City
Manager
Kerwin
McKee,
and
former
Kansas

Becky
Hutchins.
Thanks
to
HCH
CEO,
and
Holton

Later
that
afternoon,
I
headed
to
Winchester
to
tour
the
F.W.
Huston
Medical
Center
Jefferson
Clinic
and
visit
with
staff.
F.W.
Huston
also
operates
clinics
in
Valley
Falls
and
Perry.
I
appreciated
the
chance
to
visit
with
administrators
and
health
care
providers
about
the
ranges
of
health
services
they
provide
to
patients
at

Dennis
Hachenberg
and
members
of
the
Anderson
County
Board
of
Trustees
gave
me
a
tour
of
the
brand
new
hospital
being
built
directly
behind
the
current
facility.
Groundbreaking
on
this
new
hospital
took
place
in
August
2013
and
the
facility
is
set
to
open
in
2015.
The
new
hospital
will
improve
health
care
for
the
community
by
having
two
new
surgical
suites
that
will
allow
for
more
outpatient
surgeries
provided
by
the
specialists,
an
expanded
outpatient
specialty
clinic,
improved
ER
access
and
function,
and
a
space
for
therapy
services.
I
commend
the
community&#8217;s
dedication
to
improving
health
care
to
residents
and
attracting
health
care
professionals
to
Garnett.
Thank
you
to
Dennis
and
his

Tragedy
in
Wichita Four
lives
were
tragically
lost
Thursday
as
a
plane
crashed
into
a
building
at
Wichita&#8217;s
Mid-Continent
Airport.
These
four
and
their
loved
ones
are
in
my
thoughts
and
prayers
as
their
families
and
friends
deal
with
this
most
difficult
time.
On
Friday,
I
met
with
Vice
Mayor
Jeff
Blubaugh,
Wichita
Airport
Authority
director
Victor
White
and
city
of
Wichita
government
relations
director
Dale
Goter.
My
purpose
was
to
offer
sympathies,
thank
the
first
responders
and
offer
help
dealing
with
federal
agencies
if
needed.
Kansas
Cosmosphere:
A
Leader
in
Applied
STEM
Education I
began
the
week
in
Hutchinson
on
Monday
visiting
one
of
our
state&#8217;s
great
attractions,
the
Kansas
Cosmosphere.
As
home
to
the
largest
collection
of
international
space
artifacts
in
the
world,
this
Smithsonian-affiliated
Cosmosphere
welcomed
more
than
100,000
visitors
last
year
while
offering
programs
for
children,
adults
and
educators.
Efforts
are
currently
under
way
to
focus
and
expand
this
programming
so
that
over
the
next
two
years,
the
Cosmosphere
is
internationally
recognized
for
excellence
through
innovative
applied
STEM
(science,
technology,
engineering
and
mathematics)
education.
A
recent
study
from
the
Partnership
for
a
New
American
Economy
predicts
that
by
2018,
America
will
have
roughly
800,000
jobs
that
require
STEM
skills,
but
only
550,000
Americans
to
fill
those
jobs.
America
used
to
be
a
leader
in
one
STEM
field
&#8211;
engineering
&#8211;
but
now
the
United
States
produces
just
4
percent
of
the
world&#8217;s
engineering
graduates
each
year.
The
Cosmosphere
is
uniquely
suited
to
help
meet
that
need
by
inspiring
young
people,
through
knowledge
of
space
exploration,
to
pursue
STEM
careers.
I
look
forward
to
being
a
partner
in
that
effort.
Thanks
to
the
Cosmosphere
leadership
team
for
taking
time
to
meet
with
me,
including
Chief
Executive
Officer
Dick
Hollowell,
President
and
Chief
Operation
Officer
Jim
Remar,
and
Dr.
Ed
Berger,
who
now
serves
as
the
Cosmosphere&#8217;s
chair
of
revitalization
initiatives.
Salina
Rotary
Club
Meeting I
joined
the
Salina
Rotarians
on
Monday
at
the
Bicentennial
Center
for
their
weekly

I
had
the
opportunity
to
visit
with
a
number
of
community
leaders,
as
well
as
get
a
make-up

to
overcome
my
many
missed
meetings
for
my
hometown
club
in
Hays.
Thanks
to
Club
President
Brian
Boyer
for
allowing
me
to
stop
in.
Visiting
AuBurn
Pharmacy
in
Garnett
While
in
Garnett
on
Thursday
before
visiting
Anderson
County
Hospital,
I
stopped
in
to
visit
with
folks
at
AuBurn
Pharmacy.
Kansas
pharmacies
&#8211;
quintessential
community
small
businesses
&#8211;
face
a
variety
of
regulatory
challenges
that
are
both
health
and
business
related.
In
2011,
I
founded
the
Senate
Community
Pharmacy
Caucus
to
advocate
for
pharmacy
issues
and
to
serve
as
a
forum
for
ideas
and
information
about
the
role
of
pharmacists
as
health

providers.
Pharmacists
have
an
essential
role
in
caring
for
patients
by
helping
them
manage
the
safe
use
of
medications,
administering
immunizations,
and
working
collaboratively
with
doctors
and
other
health

providers
to
improve
care.
It
was
a
pleasure
to
visit
with
pharmacists
Mike
Burns,
Ryan
Moore,
and
Nathan
Wiehl
and
hear
about
how
federal
policy
impacts
community
pharmacies.
Speaking
with
Students
at
Burlington
High
School
Finally
on
Thursday
I
traveled
to
Burlington
High
School
to
visit
with
students
and
hear
about
what
they
are
learning.
I
stopped
by
two
AP
American
Government
classes
and
enjoyed
visiting
with
the
students.
We
discussed
a
range
of
topics
including
the
situation
in
the
Middle
East,
how
to
end
the
gridlock
in
Washington,
D.C,
the
economy
and
how
I
got
my
start
in
public
service.
I
was
impressed
with
the
questions
the
students
asked.
Thanks
again
to
Stacy
for
allowing
me
to
stop
by.

Cancer
Awareness
Month
conclude,
I
would
like
to
thank
Kansas
cancer
survivors,
their
families,
volunteers,
research
and
care
advocates,
and
health
care
providers
for
their
tireless
work
to
increase
breast
cancer
screening
rates
throughout
our
state
and
the
country.
Breast
Cancer
Awareness
Month
is
intended
to
increase
awareness
of
the
disease
and
help
raise
funds
for
important
research,
prevention,
diagnosis
and
treatment
initiatives.
It
is
important
that
these
efforts
continue
throughout
the
year.
According
to
the
National
Cancer
Institute
(NCI),
more
than
232,000
American
women
were
diagnosed
with
breast
cancer
last
year.
Breast
cancer
is
the
most
common
non-skin
cancer
in
the
U.S.
Thanks
to
advances
in
research
and
screening,
more
women
are
detecting
this
cancer
early
and
improving
their
chances
at
beating
the
disease.
Regular
screening
is
the
best
way
for
women
to
lower
their
risk,
because
breast
cancer
is
most
treatable
when
it
is
detected
early.

learn
more

cancer
prevention
and
screening,

Teagarden
Named
Kansas
Livestock
Association
CEO This
week
in
Topeka,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
visit
with
and
congratulate
Matt
Teagarden
following
the
announcement
that
after
a
nationwide
search
he
was
selected
to
assume
the
role
of
Chief
Executive
Officer
of
the
Kansas
Livestock
Association
(KLA).
Matt
will
be
following
in
the
footsteps
of
long-time
KLA
leader,
Dee
Likes.
For
more
than
three
decades,
Dee
worked
tirelessly
on
behalf
of
Kansas
livestock
producers.
Under
his
steadfast
leadership,
KLA
truly
developed
into
one
of
the
premier
state
livestock
associations
in
the
nation.
Dee
will
step
aside
from
his
current
role
in
January,
but
will
remain
in
an
advisory
capacity
for
KLA.
While
Dee
leaves
big
shoes
to
fill,
I
could
not
think
of
a
better
choice
than
Matt
to
lead
KLA
in
the
future.
Matt
joined
KLA
in
2001,
serving
as
director
of
industry
relations
and
information
technology.
I
am
excited
about
Matt&#8217;s
vision
for
the
future
of
the
association
and
look
forward
to
working
with
him
on
behalf
of
Kansas
livestock
producers.
Kansas
City
Royals
Make
Kansans
Proud This
week
saw
the
end
of
a
wild,
exciting
month
for
Kansas
City
Royals
fans
across
the
state.
Having
waited
29
years
for
their
team
to
reach
the
playoffs,
the
fans
united
as
the
Royals
won
dramatic
games
with
outstanding
defense
and
big
home
runs
en
route
to
the
World
Series.
In
my
travels
this
month,
the
Royals
were
a
popular
subject
as
many
wore
their
blue
colors
with
pride.
I
know
many
farmers
who
listen
to
the
Royals
while
in
the
fields
and
families
who
take
a
trip
to
Kansas
City
every
summer
to
watch
a
game
or
two.
Although
Kansas
City
couldn&#8217;t
get
Alex
Gordon
home
to
tie
Game
7
in
the
World
Series,
the
city
of
Kansas
City
and
so
many
across
the
state
are
proud
of
what
the
Royals
accomplished.
We&#8217;ll
look
forward
to
next
season!
