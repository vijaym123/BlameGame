Deadline:
13 hours
Democrats and Republicans have two very different visions for America&rsquo;s future:
Democrats want to preserve Medicare and Social Security; Republicans want to cut and privatize these programs.
Democrats support economic policies that empower the middle class; Republicans support policies that help only the super-wealthy.
Democrats demand equality; Republicans enable intolerance.
Another difference: Republicans have their right-wing billionaire backers, while we have our grassroots members.
That&rsquo;s a good thing -- it keeps us accountable to our supporters. But it means we rely on you to stand up at crucial moments -- like now.
David, do you want to see YOUR priorities made into law -- and not the Koch brothers&rsquo;? Then please renew your membership before the critical end-of-quarter FEC deadline in 13 hours.

We&rsquo;re ready to push a strong progressive agenda and elect a Democratic president and Senate who will pass it into law.
The only thing that&rsquo;s missing is you.
