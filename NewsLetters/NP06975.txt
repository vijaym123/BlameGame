With everything that&rsquo;s happening, sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to know what to do&hellip; or what to say.
And quite frankly, we don&rsquo;t have all the answers either.
But as a start, here&rsquo;s our plan: Organize.
This weekend, Democratic organizers are holding an &ldquo;Our Congress, Our Future&rdquo; Weekend of Action. And it looks like there&rsquo;s an event near you.
Together, we&rsquo;re going to reach out to as many voters as we can about the issues that inspire us. Can you join us?
EVENT : Niles and Des Plaines Door-A-Thon DATE : Fri 22 Aug 2014 TIME : 1:00 pm CDT RSVP HERE
There&rsquo;s so much Congress could be doing right now to improve people&rsquo;s lives&hellip;
&hellip;protecting voting rights&hellip; fighting gun violence... promoting equal pay&hellip; improving health care&hellip; raising the minimum wage&hellip; protecting our environment&hellip; passing immigration reform&hellip; promoting justice and equality&hellip; there are just too many issues to list.
But time and time again, this Republican Congress has simply ignored the will of the American people. Sometimes it just make you want to scream.
So go ahead, scream. (trust us, we already have)
Then, let&rsquo;s get to work creating the change we want to see in the world.
