Diane's District Wrap Up
Dear Friends,
This April work period has been a very productive one in Tennessee's
6thdistrict as I've had the opportunity to meet with so many of you in
person at Town Hall events, school and library visits, and Chamber of
Commerce and Rotary meetings. It is truly my honor to serve you in
Congress, and I always enjoy hearing your feedback so that I can take
your message with me back to Washington. Here are a couple highlights
from the past week:
Town Hall Update
Thanks to everyone who has been able to come out and attend my town
hall events in Putnam, Macon, and Wilson Counties. In order to best
serve the 6th Congressional District, I believe that it is important to
meet with constituents regularly to hear their priorities and concerns.
This is why I hold town hall meetings in cities across the district to
give everyone the opportunity to speak with me one on one. If you
haven't been able to attend one yet, please make plans to come out to
the Sumner County Administration Building in Gallatin tomorrow at 10:00
AM. Here are the details:

Art Competition Winner
Thank you to everyone who voted on Facebook to select the winner of the
6thDistrict Art Competition!
I am thrilled to congratulate Marian
Silva, a sophomore at Hendersonville Christian Academy, on winning this
year's competition. Marian's winning entry was a colored pencil
composition entitled "Freedom" that can be viewed here. She is an art
student of Ms. Ashleigh Weniger. Her artwork will be displayed in the
halls of the U.S. Capitol over the next year to be enjoyed by visitors
from around the world. I am proud of Marian and all of this year's
participants for pursuing this craft and sharing their God given
talents with their community. To view all six finalists' entries, click
