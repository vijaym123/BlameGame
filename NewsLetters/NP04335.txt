Yes to Energy
This week
Democrats in the Senate blocked the approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline
project, which would strengthen our nations energy security and help create
jobs. If completed, the project would do the following things:
Create tens
of thousands of jobs . According to the
State Departments Impact Statement :
Construction
spending would support a combined total of approximately 42,100 jobs throughout
the United States for the up to 2-year construction period.
Reduce our
nations dependence on foreign oil
from
unstable regions and help securely and efficiently transport more of our energy
from Canada, our friend and ally.
Contribute
3.4 billion to the U.S. GDP , according
to the State Department.
The House of
Representatives voted last week to authorize this project, and a majority of
Americans
already support
it . Even the
Washington Post
called the continued delay
absurd .
The permit for construction has been
languishing for six years despite the Presidents repeated calls for Congress
to send him jobs bills to sign. Congress plans to again consider the Keystone
Pipeline when we reconvene in 2015, but the President can spur job growth and
strengthen Americas energy security now by directing his State Department to
approve construction of the project. Its time to end the delay and say yes to
energy.
