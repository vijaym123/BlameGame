Care of our Veterans NUMBER ONE PRIORITY;
VA Secretary Eric Shinseki Right to Resign
When it comes to our veterans, the NUMBER ONE PRIORITY is to make sure
they get the care they need and deserve. That's why it's doubly
horrifying that investigations and audits have confirmed widespread and
systematic lack of accountability at our VA medical centers.
VA Secretary Eric Shinseki - by his own judgment - was getting in the
way of the mission to fix this atrocity.
And, it was right for him to
resign on May 30.
People have suffered the ultimate consequence of death, and the VA
needs new tools to foster accountability and restore confidence. Our
Veterans must receive the care that they are due without delay.
That's why I voted on May 21to pass the Veterans Affairs Management
Accountability Act. As investigations continue, this legislation is a
step in the right direction toward ensuring VA leaders are held
accountable for mistakes. The bill would give the Secretary of the
Department of Veterans Affairs the complete authority to fire or demote
senior VA officials based on performance."

Stopping Conehead Termite Destruction in its Tracks
The invasive conehead termite poses a severe economic and destructive
threat to agricultural crops, trees and shrubs, wood and paper
products, as well as homes and structures. And, without action, that
price tag will top $260 million in increased annual termite control
costs, excluding the costs for repairs of further damage if the
infestation spreads.
That's why I moved to stop the conehead termite in its tracks. On May
29, the House Appropriations Committee passed my plan that calls on the
United States Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to implement,
and administer an effective conehead termite eradication program. The
proposal, which uses already appropriated funding, was approved as an
amendment to the Fiscal Year 2015 Agriculture Appropriations Bill. That
legislation passed and now moves to the full House for consideration.
Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam H. Putnam agreed on the need
for the additional protections that this step provides to our state's
timber producers, the housing industry, and homeowners.
He said, "Since
2012, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer services has
worked diligently to fight the spread of the conehead termite, an
invasive and destructive termite that does not respond to conventional
termite treatments. This pest is a serious threat to Florida's homes
and businesses, and we appreciate Congressman Ander Crenshaw's support
to help our eradication efforts."
Keeping the "Spirit of Enterprise" Alive
For my continued support for legislation that strengthens our economic
and creates jobs, the United States Chamber of Commerce recently
awarded me its "Spirit of Enterprise" award for the first session of
the 113th Congress (2013).
Businesses in Florida and across the nation need support from policies
that will help them expand. Whether it's energy, health-care, trade,
tax reform, or other areas that will boost growth, that's the approach
I will continue to take on the road ahead.
Thanks for the honor and to U.S. Chamber President and CEO Thomas J.
Donohue, who said "2013 was challenging, but Representative Ander
Crenshaw worked to pass legislation and enact policies that will keep
our country moving forward economically. The Spirit of Enterprise Award
recognizes legislators like Rep. Crenshaw who have demonstrated their
commitment to supporting pro-growth policies in the 113th Congress."

Care

NUMBER

When

to

Stopping
Conehead
Termite
Destruction
in
its
Tracks
The

conehead
termite
poses
a
severe
economic
and
destructive
threat
to
agricultural
crops,
trees
and
shrubs,
wood
and
paper
products,
as
well
as
homes
and

And,
without
action,
that
price
tag
will
top
$260
million
in
increased
annual
termite
control
costs,
excluding
the
costs
for
repairs
of
further
damage
if
the
infestation
spreads.
That&#8217;s
why
I
moved
to
stop
the
conehead
termite
in
its
tracks.
On
May
29,
the
House
Appropriations
Committee
passed
my
plan
that
calls
on
the
United

Animal

That

Florida
Commissioner

for
the
additional
protections
that
this
step
provides
to
our
state&#8217;s
timber

He
said,
&#8220;Since

the
Florida
Department
of

services
has
worked
diligently
to
fight
the
spread
of
the

an
invasive

that
does
not

This

and
we
appreciate
Congressman
Ander
Crenshaw&#8217;s
support
to
help
our
eradication
efforts.&#8221;
Keeping
the
&#8220;Spirit
of
Enterprise&#8221;
Alive
For
my
continued
support
for
legislation
that
strengthens
our
economic
and
creates
jobs,
the
United
States
Chamber
of
Commerce
recently
awarded
me
its
&#8220;Spirit
of
Enterprise&#8221;
award
for
the
first
session
of
the
113th
Congress
(2013).
Businesses
in
Florida
and
across
the
nation
need
support
from
policies
that
will
help
them
expand.
Whether
it&#8217;s
energy,
health-care,
trade,
tax
reform,
or
other
areas
that
will
boost
growth,
that&#8217;s
the
approach
I
will
continue
to
take
on
the
road
ahead.
Thanks
for
the
honor
and
to
U.S.
Chamber
President
and
CEO
Thomas
J.
Donohue,
who
said
&#8220;2013
was
challenging,
but
Representative
Ander
Crenshaw
worked
to
pass
legislation
and
enact
policies
that
will
keep
our
country
moving
forward
economically.
The
Spirit
of
Enterprise
Award
recognizes
legislators
like
Rep.
Crenshaw
who
have
demonstrated
their
commitment
to
supporting
pro-growth
policies
in
the
113th
Congress.&#8221;
