Demand Rush Limbaugh&rsquo;s sponsors pull their advertising after his rape comments &gt;&gt;
During a rant on sexual assault, Rush Limbaugh asserted yesterday that sometimes &ldquo;No means yes.&rdquo; Sign your name and demand that companies pull their advertising from Rush&rsquo;s program: Your Name:
David Johnson Petition Signature:
PENDING &gt;&gt;
Sign Your Name &gt;&gt;
There&rsquo;s simply no excusing Rush Limbaugh&rsquo;s comments.
I know you&rsquo;re not surprised that Rush said something offensive, but Rush&rsquo;s comments yesterday were truly heinous:
&ldquo;[According to Ohio State policy,] consent must be freely given, can be withdrawn anytime, and the absence of "no" does not mean "yes."
How many guys, in your own experience with women, have learned that no means yes if you know how to spot it?
... Are these [policies] not lawsuits waiting to happen? &rdquo; -- Rush Limbaugh, yesterday
Comments of this offensive nature are inexcusable -- especially at a time when our country is having a long-overdue conversation about violence against women. Plain and simple -- Rush Limbaugh is advocating for the tolerance of sexual assault. He should be taken off the air immediately. David, sign your name and demand Rush Limbaugh&rsquo;s sponsors pull their advertising from his program. Your Name:
David Johnson Petition Signature:
PENDING &gt;&gt;
The women Rush&rsquo;s comments attack -- all women -- are customers of the companies that advertise on his show.
But this isn&rsquo;t just a women&rsquo;s issue. It&rsquo;s up to all of us to stand up and send a loud, clear statement: there is NO excuse for sexual assault.
So I hope you&rsquo;ll stand with me on this. Tell Rush Limbaugh&rsquo;s sponsors: if you want people to buy your products, pull your ads from Rush Limbaugh&rsquo;s show. http://action.dccc.org/Drop-Rush-Limbaugh
