emailing for $5
David, I&rsquo;m emailing for $5.
Sorry to be blunt, but Cheri Bustos needs 25O Democrats to step up in the next 24 hours to help hit her end-of-quarter fundraising goal. Will you contribute immediately?
$5
$35
$50
$100
$250

Here&rsquo;s why your support is so critical:
Cheri is the MOST vulnerable Congresswoman in Illinois.
Her first public fundraising deadline of the election is just FIVE days away.
And as of now, she&rsquo;s in serious danger of missing her goal.
Look, we need to make sure Cheri has the resources to fight back against Boehner&rsquo;s campaign machine -- and that starts by hitting this fundraising deadline out of the park. So David, I&rsquo;m coming directly to you.
Will you chip in $5 (or more if you can) before the deadline? Every dollar helps. http://action.cheribustos.com/donate
I&rsquo;m so grateful for your support,
Nancy Pelosi
