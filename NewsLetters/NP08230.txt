Last night, we officially hit
ONE MILLION DOLLARS

53,293
online donations
11,837
first-time donations (welcome to the team!)
Average Gift:
$19.84
Your outpouring of grassroots support is the talk of the town. Check out these highlights:
We just can't thank you enough for what you've made possible. $1 million in online donations will allow us to do so much to support Democratic candidates fighting for the middle-class.
