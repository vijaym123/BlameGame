Prioritizing the Piketon Plant Cleanup
To see more photos,

As a lifelong Ohioan, I understand that cleaning up the Piketon site is an economic necessity and an environmental imperative.
I spent all day Wednesday traveling around Pike County, meeting with several key people involved in the Piketon plant cleanup, including Fluor-B&amp;W, the Pike County Commissioners, the Portsmouth Site Specific Advisory Board, and the United Steel Workers.
Joined by Representatives Bill Johnson and Steve Stivers, I sent a letter to Secretary of Energy Moniz urging him to visit the Piketon site and to honor the DOEs previously stated commitment to the cleanup. The federal government must keep its promise to the community so southeastern Ohio can prosper.

Around Anderson Township
On Friday I was out and about in Anderson Township with Trustees Andrew Pappas, Josh Gerth, and Russ Jackson. We visited Servatii's Pastry Shop and Deli, said "hello" to the residents at the New England Club, and made stops at both Turpin High School and Anderson High School.
What are some of your favorite places in Ohio's Second
Congressional District?

Listening To Our Veterans
Speaking with local veterans at the Clermont County VSC
Early last week I visited the Clermont County Veterans' Service Commission and sat down with local veterans to listen to their concerns about the VA and answer their questions. This session was one of many that I've hosted around Ohio's Second Congressional District.
All of the feedback I receive during these sessions is helpful as Congress takes steps to ensure a more accountable and efficient VA.
Are you or a loved one experiencing problems
with the VA or another federal agency?

Honor Flight Tri-State
Tuesday morning I had the privilege of seeing 71 Tri-State veterans board an Honor Flight to Washington, D.C., to visit their war memorials.
As a veteran of the war in Iraq, I have seen the heroism and sacrifice of members of our military, and I believe that our country owes veterans an enormous debt of gratitude. I commend the folks involved with Honor Flight Tri-State and thank them for all that they do for our local veterans.
