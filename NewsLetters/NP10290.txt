Friend,
You and I know that elections have important consequences.
This is evident each time we hear about the extreme anti-women&#39;s health agenda being pushed across the nation. From legislation in Texas that is shutting down Planned Parenthood locations left and right, to the outrageous mandatory ultrasound bill in Virginia, politicians are sending a loud and clear message. They don&#39;t trust women to make their own healthcare choices.
That&#39;s why it&#39;s critical that we keep Dr. Ami Bera in Congress. Dr. Bera is one of us-- he shares our values and works to protect a woman&#39;s right to make her own healthcare decisions.
He understands the importance of access to contraception and preventative health services, which we can no longer take for granted. As a Congressman, he is leading the fight to push back on political overreach as politicians try to get between a patient and her doctor.
We can&#39;t afford to lose any ground on the progress we&#39;ve made.
We need courageous Members of Congress to fight back against the Members who are so out-of-touch, they&#39;re actually trying to enact unconstitutional restrictions on a woman&#39;s access to healthcare.
Dr. Bera is facing his first reelection campaign against three extreme opponents.
He&#39;s fought for us, and now we must stand with him.
I even spent time in Sacramento County this week to support his campaign-- another reason why I&#39;m asking you to take the next step.
Will you click here to give $5 or more to help send Dr. Bera back to Congress?
Dr. Bera is a physician. He knows firsthand that healthcare decisions are between a woman, her family, and her doctor -- without the input of politicians. I trust him to do whatever it takes to make sure that Washington doesn&#39;t intrude on these private issues.
His work speaks for itself-- just last year, he worked closely with our organization to launch the Women&#39;s Preventative Health Awareness Campaign to ensure women have access to preventative services that improve their overall health.
As a father, a doctor, and a Member of Congress, Dr. Bera understands the importance of not only protecting our rights, but continuing to advance women&#39;s healthcare issues.
Dr. Bera is our advocate in Congress and we need him to be successful in November.
I&#39;m supporting Dr. Bera.
Will you show your support by giving $5 or more today?
This is a critical moment, and I appreciate your help.
