Growing
Energy Independence and Creating Virginia
Jobs
Dear Friend,
As I travel throughout Central and
Southside Virginia, I regularly hear from
my constituents that todays high
energy costs are bearing a significant
burden on our Main Street businesses, our
farmers, and our families. Not only are
Fifth District Virginians suffering from
high prices at the pump, but high fuel
prices have caused higher prices across the
board, making it increasingly more
difficult for families and small businesses
to achieve financial stability.
Last week, the House of Representatives
passed legislation to protect expanding
American energy production and create
American jobs. I am encouraged by the
passage of H.R. 1965, the Federal Lands
Jobs and Energy Security Act, because it
represents a significant milestone in our
goal to achieve energy independence.
The bipartisan legislation passed by the
House last week streamlines government
regulations that hamper onshore American
energy production and job creation. By
reforming the leasing process for onshore
oil and natural gas projects, H.R. 1965
harbors the expansion of efficient wind and
solar permitting, as well as oil shale
development.
This legislation also represents a
central piece of our "all of the above"
energy strategy that includes increased oil
and gas production, including off of
Virginia's coast, the use of alternative
energies, as well as conservation.
Furthermore, not only does energy
production reduce costs on families, it is
also one of the few productive segments of
our nation's economy at the present time.
We should be doing all we can to continue
growing this important sector.
I am pleased that the House of
Representatives has acted to encourage the
creation of new jobs and lighten the burden
on our hardworking families and small
businesses. It is time that the
Administration removes itself as a barrier
to job creation and an obstacle to our
energy independence.
I look forward to continuing my work in
the House to create a sensible domestic
energy policy, and it is my sincere hope
that the Senate and the President will join
us in this crucial effort.
