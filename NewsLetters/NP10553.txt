Dear Neighbor,
Many are breathing a sigh of relief this week knowing the next tax day is a full year away from us. April 15th doesn&rsquo;t have to be nearly as dreaded if tax reform progresses through Congress. A simpler, fairer tax code means more
money in your pockets, more time with your family and fewer headaches
during filing season. The tax reform draft released earlier this year would keep
$600 in taxpayers&rsquo; pockets
and would significantly reduce the amount of time and paperwork required to file taxes. At a time when Americans in every part of the country feel like they don&rsquo;t have a fair shot at getting ahead, tax reform is a huge opportunity for everyone to get ahead.
REED RAISES CONCERNS OVER UNFAIR EPA RULE
We&rsquo;ve heard from constituents about the EPA&rsquo;s proposed rule that would increase costs for New Yorkers who heat their homes and businesses with wood stoves. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re pressing the agency to find an approach that cares for families and doesn&rsquo;t place an additional hardship on home and business owners. It&rsquo;s
unfair to target families and businesses in rural areas
that rely on wood stoves to heat their homes. For many in our community, this is an affordable, renewable energy source that is a cost-effective alternative to some of the more costly fuels.
TOM REED RESTORES STREAMGAGE FUNDING AT OWEGO CREEK
We are pleased to have secured long-term funding for the streamgage at Owego Creek that lapsed last November. Streamgages are essential in protecting life and property in our flood-prone region and I will continue to work with our partners at the local, state and federal level to make sure our area receives the protection and care it fairly deserves. More on our support for streamgages and the National Streamflow Information Program
