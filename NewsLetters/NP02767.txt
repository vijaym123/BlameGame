Friends,
My colleagues and I in the U.S. House
of Representatives have had a productive start to the
114th Congress. Weve passed 42 bills
nearly all with bipartisan support
that
deal with jobs, veterans health care, energy production and human
trafficking, among many other issues. My colleagues and I have been hard
at work in Washington, but Im glad I dont have to go back this week
and instead get to spend time visiting with folks across our district
and hearing about the issues were facing right here at home.
Like you, Im fed up with big-government policies that trample our
conservative values and threaten our nations
future.
Thats why I live in Concord and commute to Washington
because Im
committed to staying in touch with
you.
With President Obama determined to head down a path that
grows government and restricts our liberty, its clear that our freedoms
and the protection of our constitutional rights are never guaranteed
and thats why I wont stop fighting for our district.
Last
week,
I was honored to receive the True Blue
award
from the Family Research Council for my leadership and
commitment to defending life and promoting family, faith and
freedom.
According to the Family Research Council, the True Blue Award
is presented to Members of Congress who demonstrate extraordinary
integrity and character in their defense of families and the sanctity of
human life, including voting to:
Ban
abortion on pain-capable unborn children nationally
Prevent
the appointment of non-religious, atheist military
chaplains
Delay Obamacare and protect our conscience
rights
Prevent our tax dollars from paying for abortion and health care
plans that include abortion
As a Christian
and a husband, I firmly believe that family is the foundation of
American life, and I remain committed to protecting and strengthening the
family.
I am humbled to be recognized for my commitment to the
traditional principles we North Carolinians hold
dear.
Fueled by the desire to protect these
shared values, I fight every day to fix the policies coming out of
Washington and change the direction of our country.
Unfortunately,
restoring Americas founding principles is an uphill battle in a town
that often lacks a moral compass. That's exactly why I rely heavily on
my faith to help me make the right decisions and to guide my daily
undertakings.
Every day, I remind myself to put my trust in the
Lord in all I do.
Psalm 16:1 stays at the top of my
daily calendar, and when I look to see where Im supposed to go for a
meeting or when its time to vote, Im reminded to make every decision
with Gods will in mind.
Never
before has it been more critical for folks to live by Gods word and His
will.
While the foundation of America is being chipped away,
thats where we can find hope that it will be rebuilt.
While I
was honored to be recognized for my work to protect every precious
human life and restore the values upon which our nation was founded, I
know the job isnt close to being completed yet.
I promise I
will continue to work as hard as I can to represent our shared values
as your representative.
Until next
week,
Richard
