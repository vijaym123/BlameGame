Fighting for our Veterans
Hi Everyone!
I hope you all had a great weekend. Last week, I continued pushing for
answers from the Department of Veterans Affairs and working to improve
access to health care for Granite State veterans. I questioned VA
officials at two Veterans' Affairs Committee hearings on increasing
efficiency at the VA and ending its broken bonus system. I also
cosponsored an important bill that will improve veterans' health care
and increase transparency at the VA.
Mourning the Tragic Loss of a Granite Stater
I was devastated to learn of the tragic death of Lance Corporal Brandon
Garabrant, who served his country so bravely in Afghanistan. Through
his dedicated service as a volunteer fire fighter and as a Marine,
Lance Corporal Garabrant made his family, his state, and his nation
proud. The thoughts and prayers of the entire Granite State are with
Lance Corporal Garabrant's family and friends. It is our responsibility
as Granite Staters and as Americans to protect and honor all those who
serve our great nation and guard our freedom.
Questioning VA officials at Wednesday's hearing
Working to Fix the VA and Improve Care for NH Veterans
Last Wednesday, I pushed VA officials to increase the focus on
measuring outcomes, so moving forward the VA can implement best
practices and ensure that our veterans are receiving the care they need
as quickly and efficiently as possible. I also questioned private
sector health care administrators about how non-VA care providers can
be better integrated into the VA health care system to provide a more
robust model of community-based care for our veterans. We must take
every step necessary to ensure that our veterans never have to wait to
receive the care they deserve.
Then at another VA hearing on Friday, I questioned VA officials about
their performance review process and awarding bonuses to substandard
employees, a practice that was recently brought to light by the House
Veterans' Affairs Committee and national audits (Read more on this
hearing here
). The VA must immediately improve current metrics for awarding
bonuses - and any employee who deliberately manipulated wait times and
falsified records in order to get a bigger bonus should immediately be
terminated. The systemic mismanagement and lack of oversight at many VA
facilities has led to an absence of motivation and poor performance
among VA staff members. This is absolutely unacceptable, and our
veterans deserve better. I am committed to reforming this broken system
and holding the VA accountable, so our veterans can immediately access
the care they need and deserve (Watch the video here
).
I was proud to cosponsor a bill to continue to push the VA to improve
efficiency so that no veteran ever has to wait to receive health care.
H.R. 4841, the Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability
and Transparency Act of 2014, would increase health care options for
veterans, improve transparency at the VA, and reduce the risk of
mismanagement. Last week, the Senate passed companion legislation
introduced by Senators John McCain and Bernie Sanders by an
overwhelming margin, and I voted to convene a conference committee to
finalize this legislation and increase accountability and reform at the
VA. I urge my colleagues on this bipartisan, bicameral conference
committee to act swiftly to finalize an agreement between the House and
Senate versions of this important VA legislation.
With Executive Director Debbie Watrous
Supporting the Humanities in NH
I was honored to be presented last week with a cultural map of New
Hampshire by New Hampshire Humanities Council Executive Director Debbie
Watrous. This beautiful map is filled with images of Granite State
history, culture, and unique geography. The Council is doing amazing
work to spread education and engagement through the humanities far and
wide in our great state!
Helping Granite Staters
I was contacted by a constituent named Richard Elz from Milford, who
was having difficulty receiving his aid and attendance benefit from the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). My staff worked with the VA to
expedite the process and obtain this benefit for Richard. If my office
may ever be of assistance with a problem you are facing, please contact
my staff at 603-226-1002 so we may help you resolve your problem or get
you the information you need.
Have a good week and thanks for everything you do to make New Hampshire
such a special place to live!

I
was
devastated
to
learn
of
the
tragic
death
of
Lance
Corporal
Brandon
Garabrant,
who
served
his
country
so
bravely
in
Afghanistan.
Through
his

as

and
as

Lance

Garabrant
made
his

The
thoughts

of
the
entire

are

Garabrant&#8217;s

and

It
is
our

Questioning
VA
officials
at
Wednesday&#8217;s
hearing Working

Fix
the
VA

for
NH
Veterans
Last
Wednesday ,
I
pushed
VA
officials
to
increase
the
focus
on
measuring

so
moving

implement

and

as

I
also
questioned

health
care
administrators
about
how
non-VA
care
providers
can
be
better
integrated
into
the
VA
health
care
system
to
provide
a
more
robust
model
of
community-based
care
for
our
veterans.
We
must
take
every
step
necessary
to
ensure
that
our
veterans
never
have
to
wait
to
receive
the
care
they
deserve.
Then
at
another
VA
hearing
on
Friday,
I
questioned VA
officials
about
their

was
recently
brought

-
and
any
employee
who
deliberately
manipulated
wait

and
falsified

in

The
systemic

and
lack

at
many
VA

has
led
to
an
absence
of
motivation
and
poor
performance
among
VA
staff
members.
This
is
absolutely
unacceptable,
and
our
veterans
deserve
better.
I
am
committed
to
reforming
t his
broken
system
and
holding
the
VA
accountable,
so
our
veterans
can
immediately
access
the
care
they

I
was
proud
to
cosponsor
a
bill
to
continue
to
push
the
VA
to
improve
efficiency
so
that
no
veteran
ever
has
