Dear Friend:
As we gather with our loved ones and
reflect upon our personal blessings this
Christmas holiday season, let us be mindful
of those who are less fortunate.
In reflection of the true Christmas
spirit, please join me in reaffirming our
commitment to those who are in need in our
community and offering a special prayer for
them this Christmas. Also as we celebrate
and move into the New Year, we must not
forget the American heroes who have been
separated from their own families as they
protect our freedoms overseas.
I pray God blesses you with a Merry
Christmas and Happy New Year.
Sincerely,
Steve Southerland, II
