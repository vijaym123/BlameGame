UPDATE: THERE ARE ONLY 100 TRIPLE-MATCH OPPORTUNITIES REMAINING BEFORE TONIGHT&rsquo;S AD BUY DEADLINE. PLEASE DON&rsquo;T OVERLOOK THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TRIPLE YOUR IMPACT
CANCELLATION NOTICE: TRIPLE-MATCH
To keep our Democratic campaigns funded, we&rsquo;re triple-matching 1OO gifts only before tonight&rsquo;s critical budget deadline.
## TRIPLE-MATCH DONATIONS REMAINING: ##
Here is the truth:
we have 32 races that could go EITHER WAY.
With only one week left in this election, we can&rsquo;t afford to hold back. Not when Boehner is doing everything he can to beat us.
That is why we NEED you to take advantage of this triple-match opportunity before it disappears.
We don&rsquo;t have any breathing room, David. Our ad buy deadline is midnight TONIGHT. If we fall short, we&rsquo;ll have to make painful cuts just 1 week out from Election Day.
Step up now while your donation still has triple the impact.
Step up now before this opportunity ends and your triple-match status is voided!
