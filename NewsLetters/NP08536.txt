June 20, 2014
Dear Friend,
I want to provide an update about my work in Washington and thank
everyone who attended my Senior Resources Fair this week. I hope you
found the senior resources fair helpful. Representatives from over 40
local, state and federal agencies provided valuable assistance to
seniors, their families and Rhode Islanders approaching retirement age,
and I look forward to bringing these experts to you again next year.
Escalating Violence in Iraq
I am very concerned about the implications of any new U.S. military
engagement in Iraq and unequivocally oppose sending American combat
forces to this country. I opposed the Iraq War and have repeatedly
called on the Obama Administration to end the war in Afghanistan
and to quickly and safely bring our
troops home.
The resolution of the current crisis in Iraq is ultimately the
responsibility of the Iraqi people. Their leaders have the
responsibility to establish a strong pluralistic and inclusive
government that will create stability in Iraq and the region. America
has spent $1.7 billion and sacrificed 4,486 American lives on this
terrible war. I will continue to closely monitor this situation and
continue to urge the Obama Administration to proceed cautiously
.
National ASK Day
Tomorrow, June 21st is National ASK Day, a campaign to raise awareness
among parents to ask a simple, lifesaving question: "Is there an
unlocked gun where my child plays?"
On Wednesday, I spoke on the House Floor
in support of a resolution I introduced to designate June 21st as
National ASK Day to prevent senseless gun violence. Earlier this week I
promoted National ASK Day at Lippitt Memorial Park in Providence and
encouraged parents to talk to their children about gun safety. I was
joined by the Executive Director of the Rhode Island American Academy
of Pediatrics Frank Donahue and Karen Reed, a constituent from
Cumberland, who shared the heartbreaking story
of her then 9 year old son who discovered a loaded pellet gun at a
friend's house on Christmas Eve in 2011 and mistakenly believed it was
an accessory to a video game. He accidentally shot the gun and hit his
brother in the eye causing severe injury.
National ASK Day isn't a partisan issue. It is about keeping our kids
safe. On this National ASK Day I urge parents to ask a simple question
that may save their children's life.
Keeping our Communities Safe
Rhode Island's first responders provide critical services to our local
communities and I strongly support efforts to strengthen our public
safety infrastructure to protect families from harm. This week, I was
delighted to announce over $1.1 million in federal funds to help train
and equip Rhode Island firefighters. Nearly $700,000
will be used by the Harmony Fire District, Woonsocket Fire
Department, and Cranston Fire Department for training, operations,
equipment upgrades, and safety, and $425,000
will be used by the Rhode Island Fire Academy to help train
aspiring firefighters.
Like all Rhode Islanders, I am grateful to our brave firefighters for
their service to our local communities and am proud to support the
Assistance to Firefighters Grants program to give them the support they
require to protect property and save lives.
Overcoming Insurmountable Odds
I recently met with Alyssa Silva from Cumberland in my Washington
office. When Alyssa was five months old, she was diagnosed with a
debilitating disease called Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) that causes
severe muscle weakness. Now at 23 years old Alyssa has not let this
terrible disease slow her down and graduated from Bryant University in
May. Her courage and determination to keep moving forward in life is
truly inspirational and I encourage you to hear her story
about perseverance, inspiring others to
overcome SMA and commitment to raising awareness about this important
issue.
As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns,
call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at
David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov.
My best always,
David Cicilline

Dear

I
want
to
provide
an

about
my
work
in
Washington
and

everyone
who

my

I

and
I
look

to
bringing
these
experts
to
you
again
next
year.

National

Tomorrow,
June

National
ASK

a
campaign
to
raise

among
parents
to
ask
a

&#8220;Is

National

isn&#8217;t

It
is
about
keeping
our

safe.
On
this
National
ASK

I
urge
parents
to
ask
a
simple
question
that
may
save
their
children&#8217;s
life.
Keeping
our
Communities
Safe
Rhode

to
our
local

and
I
strongly
support

strengthen
our

This

I

Like
all
Rhode
Islanders,
I
am

to
our
brave
firefighters
for
their
service
to
our
local
communities
and
am
proud
to
support
the
Assistance
to
Firefighters
Grants
program
to
give
them
the
support
they
require
to
protect
property
and
save
lives.
Overcoming
Insurmountable
Odds
I
recently
met
with
Alyssa
Silva
from
Cumberland
in
my
Washington
office.
When
Alyssa
was
five
months
old,
she
was
diagnosed
with
a
debilitating
disease
called
Spinal
Muscular
Atrophy
(SMA)
that
causes
severe
muscle
weakness.
Now
at
23
years
old
Alyssa
has
not
let
this
terrible
disease
slow
her
down
and
graduated
from
Bryant
University
in
May.
Her
courage
and
determination
to
keep
moving
forward
in
life
is
truly
inspirational
and
I
encourage
you
to
hear
her
story
about
perseverance,
inspiring
others
to
overcome
SMA
and
commitment
to
raising
awareness
about
this
important
issue.
As
always,
if
you
or
someone
you
know
has
any
questions
or
concerns,
call
my
office
at
