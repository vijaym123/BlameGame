Week in Review
It has been another busy couple
of weeks working on legislation to
benefit the people of the Silver
State. Half of my time was spent in
Washington, DC, focused on the
budget, and the other half,
visiting with my fellow
Nevadans.
Developing critical
infrastructure in the state is an
important topic and the first step
toward long-term job growth and
sustainability for Nevada. Senator
Harry Reid and I, alongside both
Arizona Senators, introduced
legislation that would ensure the
development of Interstate 11,
bringing growth to the economy and
solidifying Nevada's role in a
crucial international trade route.
The Mountain West region, including
Nevada, is expected to have a
population surge of 32 million
residents between now and 2030. It
is imperative Interstate 11 is
built to serve as an artery of
commerce for all Nevadans
throughout this time. For more
information and to see the proposed
route,

In the last week of March, the
Senate focused heavily on passing a
budget. I laid out my priorities
for Nevada by filing several
amendments to the FY2016 Budget
Resolution (S. Con. Res. 11). These
amendments were designed to better
the state and enhance the quality
of Nevadans lives. The
amendments ranged from
infrastructure and tourism, to
medical care at VA facilities, to
protecting our way of life in
Nevada by supporting the Second
Amendment. Read more about them
here .
Two of my amendments were agreed
upon by the Senate and included in
the budget:
The first ensures the
Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA) medical facilities properly
meet the needs of women veterans
by taking into account their
safety, privacy, and dignity.

The second prioritizes
federal investments in
infrastructure projects with
national and regional
significance, and projects within
a high-priority corridor, such as
the future Interstate 11. Click

Senator Harry Reid also
announced his retirement last week.
I would like to thank Harry for his
long and decorated career in public
service. I have no doubt his family
is looking forward to catching up
on lost time, especially the
grandchildren.
While home in the state this
last week, I had the privilege of
presenting the Congressional Badge
of Bravery to German Rodriguez from
the Reno Police Department. Mr.
Rodriguez apprehended and disarmed
a robbery suspect, while off duty
and unarmed. His service to the
local community is unwavering and I
am grateful to have him protecting
the Silver State. Read more

I also wanted to mention the
Nevada Military Support Alliance
teamed up with the Fisher House
Foundation to build the state's
first Fisher House. Fisher House
facilities provide free housing for
military families while a loved one
is receiving medical care.
This week, I also launched the
Southern Nevada Veterans Advisory
Council to bring together
stakeholders in the community who
are dedicated to helping Nevada's
veterans. Members of this council
will uncover areas of need and
explore ways to better serve
veterans in the Silver State. Our
heroes deserve the best treatment
when they return home, and I will
continue to fight to make this a
reality.
I am excited for the coming week
home in the state and look forward
to bringing the voices of Nevadans
back to Capitol Hill.
