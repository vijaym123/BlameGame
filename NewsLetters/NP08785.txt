Ann's Weekly Roundup
Dear Friend,
On Monday the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) released a disturbing
report about the quality of care our Veterans are receiving.
The
report stated
, among other things, that St. Louis is ranked in the
top five for longest wait times for new patients seeking specialist
care, and that 57,000 Veterans across the nation are still waiting for
treatment.
This is simply unacceptable; it clearly violates the VA's
sacred pledge to excellence.
This week the United Stated House of Representatives passed a bill I
cosponsored, the Veterans Access to Care Act which would allow any
Veteran forced to wait more than thirty days for an appointment, the
option to receive private-sector care.
To learn more about the
Veterans Access to Care Act, please click here
.
While this common sense
legislation will not fix all of the problems at the VA, it's an
important step in the right direction to provide timely services and
care for our nation's heroes.
My top priority as your representative is providing superior
constituent services to the people of Missouri's 2nd District.
Yesterday I met with dozens of Veterans and their families in my
district office to hear their firsthand experiences with VA healthcare.
Veterans from every service era from WWII to Iraq and
Afghanistan described the difficulties they've faced. I heard from
Patriot Guard Riders waiting for care, wives of Vietnam Veterans with
appeals pending for years, daughters of WWII Veterans with health
issues gone untreated. Many have given up hope and that is unacceptable.
The first step in fixing the VA is to hear firsthand from the Veterans
themselves, because the American people cannot trust the VA to
correctly identify and address all deficiencies plaguing this agency.
Remember, it took Dr. Jose Mathews' revelations to expose mental health
wait times at our own VA here in St. Louis.
If I missed you at the VA intake day and you would like to share your
experience, please email me at Ann.WagnerMO02@mail.house.gov.
On Flag Day, I was truly honored to be with so many patriots at the
Fountains of West County
to celebrate Old
Glory!
On Father's Day, we celebrate the love and compassion of fathers
everywhere. It is also a day where I honor my hero, my father Earl
Trousdale who passed away two years ago. He was a man of strength,
great humor, and unconditional love. He was a loving husband, father,
and grandfather of ten. My father taught me the lessons of business (at
Carpetime), the joy of putting family and faith first, and that it was
the duty of the strong to care for the weak. Whenever anyone would ask
the question, "Earl, how are you?" my father would reply, without fail,
"I've never had a bad day in my life." There isn't a day that goes by
that I don't think of my father. I hope we all take this day to
celebrate and honor all fathers throughout our country.
As always, it is truly an honor to serve you and I look forward to
speaking with you again soon.
Sincerely,
Ann Wagner
Member of Congress

Ann's
Weekly
Roundup
Dear
Friend,
On
Monday
the
Department
of
Veteran
Affairs
(VA) released
a
disturbing
report
about
the
quality
of
care
our
Veterans
are
receiving.
The
report
stated ,
among
other
things,
that
St.
Louis
is
ranked
in
the
top
five
for
longest
wait
times
for
new
patients
seeking
specialist
care,
and
that
57,000
Veterans
across
the
nation
are
still
waiting
for
treatment .
This
is
simply
unacceptable;
it
clearly
violates
the
VA's
sacred
pledge
to
excellence.
This
week
the
United
Stated
House
of
Representatives
passed
a
bill
I
cosponsored,
the
Veterans
Access
to
Care
Act
which
would
allow
any
Veteran
forced
to
wait
more
than
thirty
days
for
an
appointment,
the
option
to
receive
private-sector
care.

more
about
the
Veterans

to
Care
Act,

While
this
common
sense
legislation
will
not
fix
all
of
the
problems at
the
VA,
it&#8217;s
an
important
step
in
the
right
direction
to
provide
timely
services
and
care for
our
nation&#8217;s
heroes.
My
top
priority
as
your
representative
is
providing
superior
constituent
services
to
the
people
of
Missouri&#8217;s
2nd
District.
Yesterday
I
met
with
dozens
of
Veterans
and
their
families
in
my
district
office
to
hear
their
firsthand
experiences
with
VA
healthcare.
Veterans
from
every
service
era
from
WWII
to
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
described
the
difficulties
they've
faced.
I
heard
from
Patriot
Guard
Riders
waiting
for
care,
wives
of
Vietnam
Veterans
with
appeals
pending
for
years,
daughters
of
WWII
Veterans
with
health
issues
gone
untreated.
Many
have
given
up
hope
and
that
is
unacceptable.
The
first step
in
fixing
the
VA
is
to
hear
firsthand
from
the
Veterans
themselves ,
because
the
American
people
cannot
trust
the
VA
to
correctly
identify
and
address
all
deficiencies
plaguing
this
agency.
Remember,
it
took
Dr.
Jose
Mathews'
revelations
to
expose
mental
health
wait
times
at
our
own
VA
here
in
St.
Louis.
If
I
missed
you
at
the
VA
intake
day
and
you
would
like
to
share
your
experience,
please
email
me
at
Ann.WagnerMO02@mail.house.gov .
On Flag
Day,
I
was
truly
honored
to
be
with
so
many
patriots
at
the
Fountains
of
West
County
to
celebrate
Old
Glory!
On
Father&#8217;s
Day,
we
celebrate
the
love
and
compassion
of
fathers
everywhere.
It
is
also
a
day
where
I
honor
my
hero,
my
father
Earl
Trousdale
who
passed
away
two
years
ago.
He
was
a
man
of
strength,
great
humor,
and
unconditional
love.
He
was
a
loving
husband,
father,
and
grandfather
of
ten.
My
father
taught
me
the
lessons
of
business
(at
Carpetime),
the
joy
of
putting
family
and
faith
first,
and
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
strong
to
care
for
the
weak.
Whenever
anyone
would
ask
the
question,
&#8220;Earl,
how
are
you?&#8221;
my
father
would
reply,
without
fail,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve
never
had
a
bad
day
in
my
life.&#8221;
There
isn't
a
day
that
goes
by
that
I
don&#8217;t
think
of
my
father.
I
hope
we
all
take
this
day
to
celebrate
and
honor
all
fathers
throughout
our
country.
As
always,
it
is
truly
an
honor
to
serve
you
and
I
look
forward
to
speaking
with
you
again
soon.
Sincerely,
Ann
