Friends,
Last week, the President
unveiled his 2015 budget proposal--more than one month late.
His
budget plan did not cut spending or address Washington's $17 trillion
dollar debt crippling our country.
Instead, the President's plan
calls for more spending, more taxes, and more government.
After the House and Senate completed successful
budget negotiations in December,
I would have expected the
President to have put forth a serious budget plan
that does not
rob our children, grandchildren, and future generations from any hope
of economic prosperity.
I recently
read this article in
The Sun News
about our state's ports and the President's emphasis
on water infrastructure.
While I have many qualms with
the President's budget plan, I was glad to see funding set aside for
port projects and dredging surveys , especially since the Senate
and House are in the midst of negotiating a Water Resources
bill.

Consider the potential for
abuse
Larger ships
are bringing down the cost of shipping, but these ships require 50 feet
of depth.
A port that cannot accommodate these larger ships will
not be competitive.
Charleston's port serv es our entire
state and beyond.
Jobs in our district, such as Nucor
Steel in Darlington, International Paper in Georgetown, and Domtar Paper
in Marlboro rely on the Charleston port.
Historically,
ports like Charleston had to spend years negotiating the absurd maze of
federal environmental regulations to get a permit to deepen a channel
(for example Miami has been working on a permit for 15 years) AND THEN
seek congressional authorization adding months or years to the
process.
As a member of the Transportation Committee of
the US Congress,
I spearheaded an effort to allow ports
like Charleston to be allowed to proceed with dredging once the permit is
granted, with their own money, and later ask for federal
reimbursement.
I was successful in including that
provision in the House version of the Water Resources Bill, and I am
honored to serve on the conference committee currently negotiating with the
Senate on the final version of the bill.
This is a good step
forward.
Thank
You
I would like thank everyone that participated last week in our
telephone town hall meeting.
We had a great conversation about
the President's budget plan, health care, and transportation
infrastructure.
Your input is invaluable to me and I rely on your
feedback when casting votes on behalf of you and your family.
Please
contact one of my offices to discuss legislative matters important to
you or to share your ideas on what Congress can do to better serve
you.
Have a good
week,
