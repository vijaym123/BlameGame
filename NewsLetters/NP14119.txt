BOXER, UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA - - - - -
November 22, 2013
Dear Friend:
This week, the
issue of how to end the epidemic of military sexual assault took
center stage as the Senate debated the annual National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA). A bipartisan majority of the Senate supports the
legislation authored by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and me, which would take
the decision about whether to prosecute these heinous crimes out of the
chain of command
and were picking up more supporters every day. To
watch my floor speech on why we must fix the broken military justice
system, please click

I have
also introduced legislation with Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) that
would end the abusive and invasive questioning of sexual assault victims
during pre-trial Article 32 hearings. I am working to pass this
bipartisan proposal as an amendment to the NDAA. To watch my speech on
the floor about this important reform, please click

Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States
Senator
