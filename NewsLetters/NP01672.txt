Dear Friend:
I invite you to take part in a survey being conducted by your Congressional office to seek your views on the quality of our constituent services.
I am committed to providing excellent constituent service, and continually strive to exceed your expectations.
2015 Constituent Service Survey
The survey should take less than 10 minutes to complete.
Your feedback counts. Your response will help shape important decisions as we seek to improve quality and provide the best possible service to you.
I am counting on you to let us know what you think of your Congressional office and how we can better serve the citizens of Virginia's First Congressional District.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
With kind regards, I remain
Sincerely,
Rob Wittman
Member of Congress
