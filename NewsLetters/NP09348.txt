News from Representative Peter Roskam
Holding the VA Accountable
Tomorrow, we will gather with friends and loved ones to honor those
brave Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our
country. But as we celebrate Memorial Day, at the forefront of all of
our minds are the disturbing reports of widespread mismanagement at the
U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs that resulted in schockingly poor
treatment of our veterans at facilities across the country. The recent
news
of secret, off-the-book waiting lists for veterans seeking
treatment in Phoenix used by VA officials in order to artificially
lower report wait times for care represent just the tip of the iceberg.
Now, allegations
of secret waiting
lists-and exorbitant bonuses for hospital management-at Chicagoland's
own Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital is bringing this scandal close to home.
For over a year, the House Veterans Affairs Committee has been
conducting a bipartisan investigation
into systemic failures at the VA, including
unsanitary conditions, an immense claims blacklog, and in some cases,
woefully substandard care. All the while, VA officials have stonewalled
investigators, hid from responsibility behind bureaucratic complexity,
and failed to make the changes necessary to meet our obligations to our
veterans.
We don't yet know the full extent of the problem, or how many veterans
and their families have been hurt by these failures already, but we can
all agree that we must move in a dramatically new direction, because
the status quo is just not working. The men and women who bravely
fought for our country deserve immediate action and immediate
consequences for those VA employees who broke faith with our veterans.
That's why this past week the House passed H.R. 4031, the VA Management
Accountability Act
, to give VA leaders every
possible tool to improve management and hold their team responsible for
delivering high quality care to our nation's veterans, to whom we owe
the greatest debt of gratitude. This legislation gives the VA Secretary
the legal authority to demote or fire senior department executives who
are not fulfilling their responsibilies. This is one in a series of
steps we will take to help the Administration turn things around at the
VA. The U.S. Senate should pass this bill immediately, and the
president should sign it without delay.

Representative
Peter
Roskam
Holding
the
VA
Accountable
Tomorrow,
we
will
gather
with
friends
and
loved
ones to
honor
those
brave
Americans
who
made
the
ultimate
sacrifice
in
defense
of
our
country.
But
as
we
celebrate
Memorial
Day, at
the
forefront
of
all
of
our
minds
are
the
disturbing
reports
of
widespread
mismanagement
at
the
U.S.
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
that
resulted
in
schockingly poor
treatment
of
our
veterans
at
facilities
across
the
country.
The
recent
news
of
secret,
off-the-book
waiting
lists
for
veterans
seeking
treatment
in
Phoenix
used
by
VA
officials
in
order
to artificially
lower
report
wait
times
for
care
represent
just
the
tip
of
the
iceberg. Now,
allegations
of
secret
waiting
lists &#8212; and
exorbitant
bonuses
for
hospital
management &#8212; at
Chicagoland's
own
Edward
Hines
Jr.
VA
Hospital
is
bringing
this
scandal
close
to
home.
For
over
a
year,
the
House
Veterans
Affairs
Committee
has
been
conducting
a
bipartisan
investigation
into
systemic
failures
at
the
VA,
including
unsanitary
conditions,
an
immense
claims
blacklog,
and
in
some
cases,
woefully
substandard
care.
All
the
while,
VA
officials
have
stonewalled
investigators,
hid
from
responsibility
behind
bureaucratic
complexity,
and
failed
to
make
the
changes
necessary
to
meet
our
obligations
to
our
veterans.
We
don't
yet
know
the
full
extent
of
the
problem,
or
how
many
veterans
and
their
families
have
been
hurt
by
these
failures
already,
but
we
can
all
agree
that
we
must
move
in
a
dramatically
new
direction,
because
the
status
quo
is
just
not
working.
The men
and
women
who
bravely fought for
our
country
deserve
immediate
action
and
immediate
consequences
for
those
VA
employees
who
broke
faith
with
our
veterans.
That's
why
this
past
week
the
House
passed
H.R.
4031,
the
VA
Management
Accountability
Act ,
to
give
VA
leaders
every
possible
tool
to
improve
management
and
hold
their
team
responsible
for
delivering
high
quality
care
to
our
nation's
veterans,
to
whom
we
owe
the
greatest
debt
of
gratitude.
This
legislation
gives
the
VA
Secretary
the
legal
authority
to
demote
or
fire
senior
department
executives
who
are
not
fulfilling
their
responsibilies.
This
is
one
in
a
series
of
steps
we
will
take
to
help
the
Administration
turn
things
around
at
the
VA.
The
