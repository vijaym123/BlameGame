Holding FEMA Accountable
Friends,
Over the last several months, I've been working to provide flood insurance relief to homeowners by delaying increases and asking FEMA for answers to the questions so many South Mississippians face.
Why is FEMA raising premiums before conducting affordability studies, reviewing findings, and adjusting regulations accordingly?
How will mitigation be taken into account with changing flood maps?
Why havent payment mechanisms meant to ease the burden on policyholders been implemented?
Why is FEMA selectively implementing portions of the law in a manner that is punishing those who played by the rules and built back after Hurricane Katrina?
In May of this year, I called for a congressional hearing to hold FEMA accountable and get answers to these questions. I hope we'll get those answers at today's hearing on the House Financial Services Committee entitled:
Implementation of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Act of 2012: Protecting Taxpayers and Homeowners .
I'll be submitting many of your stories to ensure Mississippi's voice is heard on these extremely important matters.
If you would still like to share your story, please email
MSfloodstories@mail.house.gov .
As always, I encourage you to connect with me using my
website ,
twitter , and
facebook .
In Your Service,
Congressman Steven Palazzo
