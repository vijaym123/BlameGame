Dear Friend,
This week I introduced the No Welfare for Weed Act, which would
prohibit the purchase of marijuana using federal welfare benefits.
Regardless of your feelings on States' Rights, 'medical' marijuana or
recreational marijuana, people shouldn't be able to get high using
hard-earned taxpayer money.
The sole purpose of this bipartisan bill is to prohibit marijuana from
being purchased with federal welfare benefits. These programs are meant
to provide subsidies for food and other basic living essentials for the
neediest families.
Unfortunately, there are always unscrupulous people looking for ways to
game the system, which makes this commonsense update to federal law
necessary. Taxpayers expect and deserve a lean, efficient government.
Accordingly, I will do everything in my power to eliminate waste, fraud
and abuse whenever possible, including preventing the use of federal
welfare benefits to purchase weed.
I introduced this legislation as a result of an investigation by Fox 31
Denver, which you can watch by clicking HERE
. That investigation revealed that thousands of dollars have been
pulled out of ATMs using welfare EBT cards to purchase marijuana.

in The Hill newspaper.
Protecting Local Economies
One thing I have always strongly advocated for is infrastructure, so I
was pleased to learn on Wednesday that two projects I've been working
on will be moving forward. The Army Corps of Engineers released its
Fiscal Year 2014 work plan, which contained $1.6 million for the Rio de
Flag flood control project and $100,000 for the Lower Santa Cruz River
Watershed Project. These projects will help protect the safety of
residents and businesses by preventing catastrophic flooding in both
Flagstaff and the Lower Santa Cruz River Region. Click HERE
to read more.
Advocating for Border Security
I also spearheaded a letter this week, sent on Thursday, urging the
House Appropriations Committee to allocate robust resources for Customs
and Border Patrol.
As an Arizonan, I know firsthand how important border security is to
both our safety and our economy. The men and women who risk their lives
daily working as Border Patrol agents not only prevent criminals,
smugglers and terrorists from entering our nation illegally but they
also facilitate a half trillion dollars in annual trade between the
United States and Mexico.
(Reps. Gosar and Salmon at the ICE Air Operations, Arizona Removal
Operations Coordination Center in Mesa, September 2013)
Border security is a critical element of our constitutional duty to
provide for the common defense. As such, we must ensure that Customs
and Border Patrol has adequate resources to effectively execute its
important mission. Click HERE

to read the letter.
More of the Same
On Tuesday, President Obama released his budget, which is just more of
the same: more government, more spending and higher taxes. The
President doesn't even try to balance the budget. President Obama's
policies continue to hurt hard-working Americans. It's completely
irresponsible and absolutely unfair to our kids and grandkids. Like his
prior budgets, including his 2011 budget that not even one Democrat
voted for, this budget is dead on arrival. It's not worth the paper it
was printed on.
Small Business Friday
Small businesses are the backbone of our nation's economy. They create
approximately seven out of every ten new jobs. But, unfortunately, the
federal government is stifling the ability of small businesses to grow
and, in some case, even stay open. As your representative in Congress,
I want to know what I can do to ease the squeeze.
That's why I regularly host Small Business Friday events like the one I
held in Buckeye on Friday at an American Family Insurance agency. This
allows me to hear directly from small business owners about the issues
they're most concerned about and how I can help improve the business
environment. The way to do that, as I keep hearing at these events, is
to get Washington out of the way.
(Rep. Gosar at the American Family Insurance agency in Buckeye, March
7, 2014)
Excessive regulations and Executive Branch overreach are having a
dampening effect on our economy. It's time we fixed that. If we can get
the federal government out of the way, I have no doubt that our future
will be bright. I'll continue to do everything I can to make that
happen.
Government Waste of the Week
$390,000: the cost of a NASA-funded YouTube show and cartoon series -
called "Green Ninja" - in which a man dressed in a green ninja costume
teaches kids about global warming.
Congressional District 4: Did You Know?
There were several different names proposed for the city of Prescott,
including "Aztlan", "Audubon", and "Goodwin City." In the end,
"Prescott" was chosen to honor William Hickling Prescott, author of The
History of the Conquest of Mexico. According to the Arizona Miner, this
name was chosen because Prescott was considered "a good citizen, a true
patriot, with industry, perseverance under difficulty, amiability of
character and love of country."
(William Hickling Prescott)

Protecting

One
thing
I
have
always
strongly

is
infrastructure,
so
I
was
pleased
to
learn
on
Wednesday
that
two
projects
I've
been

will
be
moving

The
Army

its

which
contained

for
the
Rio

will

As

Border
security
is
a
critical
element
of
our
constitutional
duty
to
provide
for
the
common
defense.
As

we

More
of
the
Same
On
Tuesday,
President
Obama
released
his
budget,
which is
just more
of
the
same:
more
government,
more
spending
and
higher
taxes.
The
President
doesn't
even
try
to
balance
the
budget.
President
Obama's
policies
continue
to
hurt
hard-working
Americans.
It's
completely
irresponsible
and
absolutely
unfair
to
our
kids
and
grandkids.
Like
his
prior
budgets,
including
his
2011
budget
that
not
even
one
Democrat
voted
for,
this
budget
is
dead
on
arrival.
It's
not
worth
the
paper
it
was
printed
on.
Small
Business
Friday
Small
businesses
are
the
backbone
of
our
nation&#8217;s
economy.
They
create
approximately
seven
out
of
every
ten
new
jobs.
But,
unfortunately,
the
federal
government
is
stifling
the
ability
of
small
businesses
to
grow
and,
in
some
case,
even
stay
open.
As
your
representative
in
Congress,
I
want
to
know
what
I
can
do
to
ease
the
squeeze.
That&#8217;s
why
I
regularly
host
Small
Business
Friday
events
like
the
one
I
held
in
Buckeye
on
Friday
at
an
American
Family
Insurance
agency.
This
allows
me
to
hear
directly
from small
business
owners about
the
issues
they&#8217;re
most
concerned
about
and
how
I
can
help
improve
the
business
environment.
The
way
to
do
that,
as
I
keep
hearing
at
these
events,
is
to
get
Washington
out
of
the
way.
(Rep.
Gosar
at
the
American
Family
Insurance
agency
in
Buckeye,
March
7,
2014)
Excessive
regulations
and
Executive
Branch
overreach
are
having
a
dampening
effect
on
our
economy.
It&#8217;s
time
we
fixed
that.
If
we
can
get
the
federal
government
out
of
the
way,
I
have
no
doubt
that
our
future
will
be
bright.
I&#8217;ll
continue
to
do
everything
I
can
to
make
that
happen.
