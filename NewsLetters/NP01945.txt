Congressmen Lamborn and DeSantis Introduce Legislation to Prevent Boycotts
of Israel
Bill will prevent US Government Contracts
From Going to Participants in the BDS
Movement
3/25/15
Today, Congressmen Doug Lamborn and Ron DeSantis released the
following statement after their introduction of H.R. 1572, the Boycott Our
Enemies, Not Israel Act
:
Today, we introduced H.R. 1572 to thwart efforts
by Palestinian organizations to pressure different corporations,
companies and educational institutions to boycott, divest, and sanction
Israel. Recently the Palestinian Authority declared a boycott against
Israeli goods, depriving their own population of most basically
needed products. Threats of similar actions emerged out of the European
Union.
These attacks and the falsehoods being
spread about Israel are harmful to any honest effort to bring peace to
the region.
My bill will require that any prospective contractors with the U.S.
Government will certify that they are not taking part in any boycott
against Israel. The bill also includes penalties for false
certifications, including the ability to ban companies that breach its parameters
from doing future business with the U.S. Government. Our government
business practices should not play any role in harming our greatest ally
in the Middle
East.
Israel is the only true democracy in the Middle East,
a place where all men and women enjoy freedom regardless of their
faith or ethnicity. In fact Jewish owned factories and companies in Israel
and in Judea and Samaria are among the chief employers of the
Palestinian community. Palestinian workers get equal pay and equal treatment
and enjoy
benefits."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
(CO-05)
The BDS movement represents a
disgraceful attempt to single out Israel for punitive treatment.
This bill sends a strong message that we will not allow taxpayer
funds to go to contractors who participate in this contemptible charade.
It is imperative that the United States send a strong message of
condemnation by refusing to fund participating contractors using taxpayer
money.
- Congressman Ron DeSantis
(FL-06)
