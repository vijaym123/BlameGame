The Hill Report
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of March 3 - 7, 2014
This week, President Obama released his fiscal year 2015 budget
request.
His budget came to Congress a month late, marking the fifth
time in six years that President Obama has missed his deadline.
Unsurprisingly, President Obama's overdue budget blueprint prioritizes
election year politics over leadership that our nation deserves and our
economy needs. His plan breaks the bipartisan budget agreement spending
caps and he proposes more government spending and job-destroying tax
hikes all while jeopardizing our nation's military readiness. The
Administration also refuses to tackle entitlement reform in this plan
that would lower our debt and keep important programs sustainable for
current and future generations.
It's disappointing that the president produced a campaign document
instead of putting forth a serious budget blueprint that makes the
tough choices necessary to get our fiscal house in order. As your
Member of Congress, you can rest assured that I will continue to work
to put our nation on a fiscally solvent path and restore our economic
vitality. To learn more about the president's budget, click here

Legislative Update
The House continued our work to pass common-sense bills this week to
help provide relief to the American people from the failed policies of
the Obama Administration.
On Wednesday, we approved H.R. 4118, the
Suspending the Individual Mandate Penalty Law Equals Fairness Act,
which delays ObamaCare's individual mandate.
Since ObamaCare was
enacted in 2010, the Administration has delayed or modified parts of
the law more than 20 times through unilateral executive.
Although the
employer mandate has been delayed twice due to pressure from businesses
and unions seeking reprieve from the law's onerous costs, the Obama
Administration refuses to delay the individual mandate.
I believe that
families and individuals deserve the same relief as businesses from the
devastating health care law. While I continue to fight to fully repeal
the president's health care law, I was pleased to vote this week to
protect all Americans from ObamaCare's individual mandate.
On Thursday, the House passed H.R. 3826, the Electricity Security and
Affordability Act, and H.R. 2641, the Responsibly And Professionally
Invigorating Development (RAPID) Act. These bills seek to address the
Administration's failed energy and jobs policies.
At a time when
millions of Americans are looking for work, the focus in Washington
should be on productive ways to harness our nation's vast energy
resources instead of promulgating new onerous and expensive regulations
that undermine economic growth. The RAPID Act streamlines the approval
process for infrastructure, energy, and construction projects to
generate economic activity and job creation. The Electricity Security
and Affordability Act repeals recently proposed EPA regulations for
future fossil fuel-fired power plants to ensure that we have abundant,
affordable, and domestically-generated energy.
DART Meeting
On Thursday, I met with representatives from the Dallas Area Rapid
Transit (DART) to discuss the new developments of the Orange Line. The
Orange Line expansion is a key component of the regional rail system
that will increase DART's rail network to 90 miles by the end of 2014.
The Orange Line will run parallel with the Green Line through downtown
Dallas and head northwest to the Dallas/Fort Worth International
Airport. This project, expected to be completed in the Fall of 2014,
will increase public transportation options in the Dallas area and
provide affordable and energy-efficient transportation to the people of
North Texas.

Week

2014
This

President
Obama
released
his
fiscal
year
2015
budget
request.
His
budget
came
to
Congress
a
month
late,
marking
the
fifth
time
in
six
years
that
President
Obama
has
missed
his
deadline.
Unsurprisingly,
President
Obama&#8217;s
overdue
budget
blueprint
prioritizes
election
year
politics
over
leadership
that
our
nation
deserves
and
our
economy
needs.
His
plan
breaks
the

and
he
proposes
more

all
while

our
nation&#8217;s
military

The
Administration
also
refuses
to
tackle
entitlement
reform
in
this
plan
that
would
lower
our
debt
and
keep
important
programs

for

that

putting

serious
budget
blueprint
that
makes
the
tough
choices
necessary
to
get

As
your

you

Legislative
Update
The
House
continued
our
work
to
pass
common-sense
bills
this
week
to
help
provide
relief
to
the
American
people
from
the
failed
policies
of
the
Obama
Administration.
On
Wednesday,
we
approved
H.R.
4118,
the
Suspending
the
Individual
Mandate
Penalty
Law
Equals
Fairness
Act ,
which
delays
ObamaCare&#8217;s
individual
mandate.
Since
ObamaCare
was
enacted
in
2010,
the
Administration
has
delayed
or
modified
parts
of
the
law
more
than
20
times
through
unilateral
executive.
Although
the
employer
mandate
has
been
delayed
twice
due
to
pressure
from
businesses
and
unions
seeking
reprieve
from
the
law&#8217;s
onerous
costs,
the
Obama
Administration
refuses
to
delay
the
individual
mandate.
I
believe
that
families
and
individuals
deserve
the
same
relief
as
businesses
from
the
devastating
health
care
law.
While
I
continue
to
fight
to
fully
repeal
the
president&#8217;s
health
care
law,
I
was
pleased
to
vote
this
week
to
protect
all
Americans
from
ObamaCare&#8217;s
individual
mandate.
On
Thursday,
the
House
passed
H.R.
3826,
the
Electricity
Security
and
Affordability
Act ,
and
H.R.
2641,
the
Responsibly
And
Professionally
Invigorating
Development
(RAPID)
Act .
These
bills
seek
to
address
the
Administration&#8217;s
failed
energy
and
jobs
policies.
At
a
time
when
millions
of
Americans
are
looking
for
work,
the
focus
in
Washington
should
be
on
productive
ways
to
harness
our
nation&#8217;s
vast
energy
resources
instead
of
promulgating
new
onerous
and
expensive
regulations
that
undermine
economic
growth.
The
RAPID
Act
streamlines
the
approval
process
for
infrastructure,
energy,
and
construction
projects
to
generate
economic
activity
and
job
creation.
The
Electricity
Security
and
Affordability
Act
repeals
recently
proposed
EPA
regulations
for
future
fossil
fuel-fired
power
plants
to
ensure
that
we
have
abundant,
affordable,
and
domestically-generated
energy.
DART
Meeting
On
Thursday,
I
met
with
representatives
from
the
Dallas
Area
Rapid
Transit
(DART)
to
discuss
the
new
developments
of
the
Orange
Line.
The
Orange
Line
expansion
is
a
key
component
of
the
regional
rail
system
that
will
increase
DART's
rail
network
to
90
miles
by
the
end
of
2014.
The
Orange
Line
will
run
parallel
with
the
Green
Line
through
downtown
Dallas
and
head
northwest
to
the
Dallas/Fort
Worth
International
Airport.
This
project,
expected
to
be
completed
in
the
Fall
of
2014,
will
increase
public
transportation
options
in
the
Dallas
area
and
provide
affordable
and
energy-efficient
transportation
to
the
people
of
North
Texas.
