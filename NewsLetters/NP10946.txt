Dear David:
I am writing to share some good news with you about my service in
Washington. I was just reappointed to serve on the Budget Committee. I
am already a senior member of the House Committee on Ways and Means and
the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Human Resources, and, today, I
joined the House Budget Committee just in time for Committee
consideration of this year's House Budget Resolution. You can view my
response to the Republican Ryan Budget by clicking here

As we mark the 50th Anniversary of President Johnson's War on Poverty,
our federal budget should build on efforts to boost those struggling to
climb the bottom rungs of the economic ladder. The size of our deficit,
our tax rates, are important, but they are not the sole lenses through
which the strength of America should be viewed.
A truly balanced budget
is measured not just in dollars but in the educational opportunity
afforded our youth, the dignity offered seniors, and the level of its
investment designed to ensure an America that is competitive in the
world economy.
Please keep me advised of any federal matters on which I may be of
assistance.
Sincerely,
Lloyd Doggett
