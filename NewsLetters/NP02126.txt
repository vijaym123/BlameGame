This week I hosted a town meeting at the Heidlersburg United Brethren in Christ Church in Adams County. It was great to meet with over 80 constituents in attendance. We discussed issues facing the U.S. Congress and America like the federal budget, job creation, homeland and national security, and immigration.
Heidlersburg Town Meeting
These town meeting are invaluable for me to effectively represent you in Congress. I regularly need - and seek - your feedback on all of the issues facing our country. This town meeting continues my efforts to solicit your feedback. I've met with hundreds of constituents via individual meetings and site visits, conducted regular in-person town and tele-town meetings throughout the 4th Congressional District, and aggressively utilize social media to interact with you.
Future town meetings will be announced shortly. If you're unable to attend these upcoming meetings in person but would like to speak with me, please contact any of our offices to schedule a meeting.
In addition to hosting a town hall this week, I held various meetings with groups interested in transportation, health care, and government regulations. I also was honored to serve as a guest lecturer in former Mayor of York Bill Althaus American Government: Institutions class at York College.

Finally, I had the opportunity to join Ken Matthews of WHP 580 radio in studio to discuss whats happening in Washington and around the 4th Congressional District. Its always great to have a thoughtful discussion with Ken and take calls from listeners.
