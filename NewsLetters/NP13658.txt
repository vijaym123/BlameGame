Rep. Takano Calls for Extension of Unemployment Benefits
Earlier this week, Rep. Takano signed on to a letter to Speaker Boehner
calling for the extension of unemployment insurance before the House of
Representatives adjourns on Friday, December 13.
The letter also details the harmful effects of failing to extend
unemployment benefits saying, "We write to urge you to address the
looming expiration of unemployment benefits for millions of Americans
before adjourning Congress for the remainder of the year.
Without
swift Congressional action, 1.3 million jobless workers will have their
benefits cut off on December 28th, and nearly another 1.9 million will
lose their unemployment benefits over the first half of next year.
This would not only be a devastating blow for millions of Americans who
are already struggling, but it would also hurt our economy."

Rep. Takano Fasts for Immigration Reform
Last week, Rep. Takano met with the immigration group Fast for
Families, who have fasted for the past several weeks in support of
comprehensive immigration reform.
After fasting for 22-days, Eliseo Medina broke his fast by passing it
on to Representative Joe Kennedy (MA-4). Rep. Kennedy passed the fast
on to Representative Juan Vargas (CA-51), who then passed the fast on
to Representative Joe Garcia (FL-26).
On Friday, December 6, Rep. Takano continued the fast, before passing
it on to Rep. Tony Cardenas.
"As the son of immigrants who sacrificed so much to come to America, I
am honored to continue the Fast for Families to raise the importance of
immigration reform to my colleagues in Congress," said Rep.
Comprehensive immigration reform is one of the top priorities for the
people of the Inland Empire, and I call on Speaker Boehner to do what's
right and schedule a vote to keep millions of families together."
Earlier this week, Rep. Takano appeared on MSNBC's Jansing and Co. with
Eliseo Medina to discuss his fast and the push for immigration reform.

Rep. Takano Calls for Increase of the Minimum Wage
Last week, Rep. Takano participated in an event to call for an increase
to the minimum wage.
During the event, Rep. Takano said, "For thirty years, the working
class has been on the short end of the stick with their incomes
remaining stagnant. But in the same thirty years, those in the top one
percent have seen their incomes skyrocket. If the minimum wage kept
pace with the earnings of the top one percent, it would currently stand
at $22.62.
Imagine where our economy would be if we had a working class with such
great buying power. There would be no such thing as the "working poor."

Rep. Takano Calls for Fraudulent Health Care Website, Promoted by
Republican Lawmakers, to be Taken Down
Last week, Rep. Mark Takano (D-Riverside) sent a letter to California
Attorney General Kamala Harris about CoveringHealthCareCA.com, a
website being promoted by California Republican officials, which
features fraudulent, inaccurate and misleading information about the
Affordable Care Act.
In the letter, Rep. Takano asks Attorney General Harris to issue a
cease and desist letter to the operators of the website as it violates
state law which prohibits domain names that are "confusingly similar"
to another entity.
"The domain name CoveringHealthCareCA.com is very similar to the state's
official marketplace website," Takano says in the letter. "Like the
other websites your office shut down, the domain name alone could lead
consumers to believe they are on the official site, rather than an
imposter."

&#8220;As

to

I
am
honored
to
continue
the
Fast

Calls
for Increase
of
the
Minimum
Wage
Last
week,
Rep.
Takano
participated
in
an
event
to
call
for
an
increase
to
the minimum
wage.
During
the
event,
Rep.
Takano
said,
"For
thirty
years,
the
working
class
has
been
on
the
short

But
in

Rep.

Calls
for
Fraudulent
Health
Care
Website,
Promoted
by
Republican
Lawmakers,
to
be
Taken
Down
Last
week,
Rep.
Mark
Takano
(D-Riverside)
sent
a
letter
to
California
Attorney
General
Kamala
Harris
about
CoveringHealthCareCA.com,
a
website
being
promoted
by
California
Republican
officials,
which
features
fraudulent,
inaccurate
and
misleading
information
about
the
Affordable
Care
Act.
In
the
letter,
Rep.
Takano
asks
Attorney
General
Harris
to
issue
a
cease
and
desist
letter
to
the
operators
of
the
website
as
it
violates
state
law
which
prohibits
domain
names
that
are
&#8220;confusingly
similar&#8221;
to
another
entity.
&#8220;The
domain
name
CoveringHealthCareCA.com
is
very
similar
to
the
state&#8217;s
official
marketplace
website,&#8221;
Takano
says
in
the
letter.
&#8220;Like
the
other
websites
your
office
shut
down,
the
domain
name
alone
could
lead
consumers
to
believe
they
are
on
the
official
site,
rather
than
an
imposter.&#8221;
