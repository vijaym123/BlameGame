7th DISTRICT

Dear
Friends:
I look forward to working with the President as
we begin the 114th Congress for the benefit of all
Americans. Expanding good paying jobs and protecting our nation against terrorism
are the top priorities I hear from my constituents. However, tonight the
President championed raising taxes and expanding the size and scope
of government. I have yet to hear from any constituent asking for that.
While I agree with
improving our nations infrastructure, we can do that creatively and
efficiently without soaking the taxpayer. I look forward to working with my
colleagues in Congress to make the American People's priorities our
priorities by enacting common-sense legislation that will grow the
economy and protect the homeland.
With
my regards and best wishes, I
remain
Sincerely,
John L. Mica
Member of
