113th Congress adjourns sine die: a look back
The 113th U.S. House of Representatives adjourned sine die today. Lets take a quick look back at the progress made for the Northern Mariana Islands over 2014, the Second Session of the 113th:
January
$3.9 million increase for PSS
The President signed Public Law 113-76, with funding for fiscal 2014, including $12.7 million for the Northern Marianas Public School System
an increase of $3.9 million that should hold for ten years.
4x more energy assistance for NMI families
Two years of behind the scenes effort paid off when HHS Secretary Sebelius agreed to give the Northern Marianas the full amount authorized by law for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP.
February
$32.5 million NMI SNAP pilot program enacted
The President signed the Agricultural Act of 2014, Public Law 113-79, providing $32.5 m. for the Northern Mariana Islands food stamp program. $2 m. funds a study of setting up the national Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, in the NMI. $30.5 m. will be used to raise benefits for families in need in our islands beginning October 2015.
March
Transfer of oil, gas, mineral rights to CNMI completed
As required by U.S. Public Law 113-34, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell signed the conveyance of oil, gas, and mineral rights in the submerged lands around the Northern Marianas to the Commonwealth on March 13. This was one more step in the process of ownership transfer that began in September 2013.
April
Food stamps up 62% for Rota, 28% for Tinian
Families on Rota, Tinian, and the Northern Islands got a big boost in food stamp assistance. Benefits for a family of four on Rota went from $444 per month to $719, on Tinian to $568. In December Saipan families received a 16 percent increase. Extra money not only helps those in need; it is also good for store owners, shippers, and government revenues because the money goes straight into the local economy.
May
Transitional worker program extended for five years
Labor Secretary Perez announced his decision to extend the Commonwealth-only (CW) transitional worker program through 2019 in a letter to Governor Inos and myself. We had urged the Secretary to make this decision; and he agreed the extension would enable CNMIs legitimate businesses to meet their current and near-term future workforce needs.
June
New law lowers NMI cost on Army Corps projects
The President signed the Water Resources Reform and Development Act, Public Law 113-121,with my provision requiring an increase in the waiver of the local cost-share for the insular areas to account for 25 years of inflation. The Army Corps announced in December the waiver would jump from $200,000 to $450,000 and apply retroactively to projects in progress.
July
Work force training funds increase
A new Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act went into effect authorizing a 17 percent increase in three major job training programs over the next six years. I am a member of the Education & the Workforce Committee, which produced the bill. The increased funding coupled with more local control should help the on-going efforts to train U.S. workers to take over jobs now held by CW workers.
August
Choice Cards increase options for veterans
With the Presidents signature of the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act, Public Law 113-146, veterans gained new options for medical care. The Act includes my provision allowing veterans, such as those on Rota and Tinian, who have to travel by air to reach a VA medical facility, to obtain care from qualified non-VA providers instead.
Seven House Chairmen visit, open Garapan Public Market
A delegation, led by Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings (R-Washington) and Agriculture Committee Chairman Frank Lucas (R-Oklahoma) came to the Northern Marianas at my invitation and cut the ribbon for the Garapan Public Market, funded by an earmark I obtained for the Commonwealth in fiscal 2010.
September
Energy bill permits off-shore mineral revenues for the NMI
The House passed legislation, H.R.2, permitting off-shore mineral and energy development in the exclusive economic zone around the Northern Marianas and revenue sharing for the Commonwealth government, although the Senate took no further action in the 113th Congress.
October
Affordable Care Act funds to CHCC hit $42 m., $67 m still available
New Medicaid funding from the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, is helping pay for medical care for 15,000 lower-income Northern Mariana Islanders. Without these funds it would have been very difficult to keep our hospital open after the CNMI government stopped underwriting the costs of CHC.
November
Child care act, supporting working families, extended for six years
200 Northern Marianas families will continue getting help paying for childcare. Congress reauthorized and the President signed the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act worth over $2 million annually for the NMI.
Re-election as Region II Democratic Whip for the 114th Congress
My colleagues from the San Francisco and Northern California area, Hawaii, and Guam elected me to be their Whip again in the next Congress.
December
Key immigration policies extended to 2019
H.R. 83, enacted as Public Law 113-235, contained my language extending to 2019 three policies critically important to the NMI economy: 1) a bar on claims of asylum, protecting our tourist trade with China; 2) continuation of the E-2C investor program, created under CNMI immigration law; and 3) exemption from the numerical cap on H visas, allowing developers to hire temporary workers for the increase in resort construction expected in our islands.

114th Congress begins Tuesday
Tax reform and trade policy are being cited as possible areas of agreement between the Democratic White House and the Republican Congress in the legislative session beginning on January 6. As always, and as we did last year, finding larger bills that are moving through the process to attach the changes needed for the Northern Mariana Islands will be part of our strategy. But there will also be more direct opportunities presented by the overdue reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the Higher Education Act. These laws will be at the top of the agenda for the Education and the Workforce Committee, of which I am a member. Look for new anti-poverty initiatives from the incoming House Ways and Means Chairman and 2012 GOP Vice Presidential candidate Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) and, perhaps, another bipartisan infrastructure bill, the highway reauthorization, coming from the leadership of Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Bill Shuster (R-Pennsylvania). 2015 will no doubt be an interesting and challenging year in Congress.

2015 FAFSA applications are now available
Essential to getting federal aid for college is filing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, each year. And the 2015 FAFSA is now available online
for students and their families to start filling out. The FAFSA form asks for information about family income and how many family members are in school, as well as what school a student is attending. That information determines eligibility for scholarships, grants (such as the Pell Grant), work-study awards, and loans. Getting a college degree is challenging enough without having to worry about being unable to afford tuition. That is why I was an original co-sponsor of HR 3221 - The Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act,
which increased the individual Pell Grant awards to students and made more students from the Northern Mariana Islands eligible for the aid. But to receive the Pell Grant or any other federal education assistance requires the FAFSA. For more information or to begin working on your application, visit https://fafsa.ed.gov/.
