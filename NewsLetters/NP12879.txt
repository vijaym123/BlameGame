This
week, President Obama will deliver his State of the Union Address. I hope
he will use this opportunity to find areas where both parties in the
House, Senate and White House can work together to boost our economy,
help Americans get back to work, and remove barriers to small business
growth. I also look forward to hearing from the President about his
plans to work with Congress to keep our nation secure.
