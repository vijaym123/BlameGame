The outbreak of Ebola continues to grow in West Africa - now infecting and killing more people than all previous Ebola outbreaks combined since the virus discovery in 1976.
According to the
World Health Organization , the Ebola virus has now resulted in over 7,000 cases and over 3,000 deaths in countries in West Africa, and on September 30th, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the first case of Ebola in the United States.
Due to the unprecedented scale of this outbreak, attention has turned toward preventing Ebola from spreading in the United States.
While experimental drugs have been used to treat the disease, CDC officials are investigating the case in the U.S. and while some individuals have been quarantined, mandatory travel restrictions have not been imposed.
