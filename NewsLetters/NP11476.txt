Friends,
Last week the House of
Representatives passed legislation that would reform Medicare, rein
in Executive Overreach, increase oversight, and protect our Volunteer
Firefighter Departments from Obamacare mandates.
The Senate took
up and passed the House of Representative's
HHEAT Act , which helps American families get
the assistance they need during this cold winter , and
the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act, sending both bills
to the President's desk to be signed into law.
Wednesday marked
2,000 days since the Keystone
XL pipeline application was filed
with the State
Department.
In an effort to find a plausable excuse for delaying the
permit process, the Administration has completed more than 22,000
pages of research on the pipeline.
Research has shown that the
Keystone XL pipeline would create thousands of jobs, lower energy costs,
and be unlikely to alter global greenhouse gas emissions. This
leaves me wondering, why the delay?
SC Sec. Hitt
Testifies on Capitol Hill
The Subcommittee I preside over held a
hearing on Wednesday to
examine the
impact manufacturing has on small businesses
and our
country's competitiveness. South Carolina's Secretary of Commerce, Bobby
Hitt, traveled to Washington to testify at my hearing about the
manufacturing renaissance occurring in the Palmetto State and
nationwide.

Spirit of Enterprise Award
I was honored to
receive the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Spirit of Enterprise Award this week.
The Chamber annually recognizes members of Congress who support
pro-growth, pro-jobs policies.
My number one priority in Congress
is, and always will be, jobs . I look forward to advancing
policies that grow our economy and create economic opportunities for
South Carolinians and families nationwide.

Bi-Partisan American Competitiveness
Dinner
To wrap-up the week, I held a dinner with Harvard Business
School Professor and friend, Michael Porter.
Professor Porter is a
leading expert on American Competitiveness, and I have made it my goal
to get him in front of Republican and Democrat Members of Congress to
highlight ways we can work together to grow our economy.
We had
a great discussion with Professor Porter and House Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Camp about tax reform.
Pictured alongside me
from left to right are:
Professor Michael Porter, Rep. Ander
Crenshaw (R-FL), Co-Founder and CEO of Pacific Trade International,
Inc., Mei Xu, Rep. Randy Weber (R-TX), Rep. Ted Yoho (R-FL), Rep. Jim
Bridenstine (R-OK), Rep. Tom Price, MD (R-GA), Rep. Dave Camp (R-MI),
The Boston Company Director, Shirley Mills, and not pictured but
attended, Donald Payne Jr. (D-NJ).
It is an honor and privilege to serve you
and your family.
Have a safe and
fun St. Patricks Day!
