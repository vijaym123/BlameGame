Metroplex-Stay Alert this Holiday Season
Dear Friends:
As we approach the holiday season theres always an uptick in phone, internet, and shopping scams.
ANYONE
regardless of age can become a victim. Make sure youre not one of them by staying alert, informed, and prepared.
TELEPHONE SCAMS
Many individuals have reported getting telephone calls about winning the lottery.
DO NOT
give your information to anyone over the phone and spread the word to family and friends! If you dont remember even entering the lottery, odds are
you did not win.
GIFT CARD SCAMS
Scammers go to racks of gift cards and scan the card number in order to steal the money once youve activated it.
AVOID THIS
by purchasing your gift cards from a customer service desk
OR
if your card is pre-loaded, ask for the card to be scanned and checked for full value
VACACTION HOME RENTAL SCAM
There are websites that have been offering special deals on vacation homes for the holiday seasons.
Even though the listing looks official, it might not be.
Look out for the red flags:
Is the price just too good to be true? It probably is.
DO NOT SEND YOUR PAYMENT BY A WIRE CHECK: Use a credit card so you can get the payment back if its fraud.
Go online to the tax assessors office of the propertys city or county and look up the real owner.
CHARITY SCAMS
While there are many legitimate charities that collect donations for our nations military veterans some of them are NOT LEGITIMATE. If you are unsure about a call asking for donations to veterans contact the
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) .
