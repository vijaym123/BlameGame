Mississippi Earns Second-Highest
Spot in List
of Most Charitable States
New Year
Promises More Collaboration in Service
Initiatives
The Christmas season is a wonderful
time to help families in need.
In fact, a large portion of
charitable giving in America occurs during the month of December.
Holiday programs throughout the country provide unique opportunities for
Americans to share the gift of Christmas with others.
Each year, my
staff in Washington delivers toys and clothes as part of the Elf
Program with Horton's Kids, a mentoring organization for underprivileged
children in the D.C. area.
Our state team also collects gifts for
children in Mississippi through Toys for Tots.
We can be proud of Mississippi's enduring
reputation for generosity
around the holidays and throughout the
year.
In October, a new report by the Chronicle of Philanthropy
found that our state again has one of the highest rates of charitable
giving in the nation, second only to Utah.
The study, which
compared IRS data from 2006 to 2012, also showed that lower-income Americans
give at higher rates than those with the biggest paychecks.
'Give, and It Shall Be Given Unto
You'
In Mississippi, where disasters like
Hurricane Katrina and severe tornadoes have devastated communities in
recent years, the importance of giving is witnessed firsthand.
Mississippians understand why kindness matters because we are grateful for
the efforts of others in our times of need.
Since Katrina, for
example, more than 1 million volunteers have lent their time and
energy to help our state.
Mississippians have done their part, too,
serving more than 27 million volunteer hours over the past 20
years.
Most of us in Mississippi
realize that the benefits of service are twofold, helping both those who
receive and those who give.
That message is found in Luke 6:38
where Jesus reminds us, "Give, and it shall be given unto you."
Shakespeare wrote in "The Merchant of Venice" that mercy "is twice
bless'd.
It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes."
Indeed, research shows that volunteers reap tangible rewards from their
service.
Volunteering is associated with a 27 percent increase in
securing employment.
Mississippi Group Launches New Model
for Service
Now
Mississippi is poised to expand the value of volunteering, civic
engagement, charitable donations, and the work of nonprofit organizations.
A new initiative called Engage Mississippi will be launched next
year to foster collaboration within our communities, ensuring that
charitable investments and volunteer efforts are maximized.
Spearheaded by Volunteer Mississippi and the Mississippi Center for Nonprofits,
this innovative alliance plans to create an economic model that helps
nonprofits, businesses, churches, and universities target the best
use of their resources.
Communities are strengthened when
businesses and organizations work together.
Engage Mississippi will change the ways that various
groups can give back, organizing outreach to promote a collective
impact.
Traditionally, groups have served independently, helping
their neighbors but not fully achieving the widespread gains that a
coordinated effort could accomplish.
By involving multiple
stakeholders, Engage Mississippi seeks to find long-term solutions to our state's
most critical issues.
The alliance will provide an essential
conduit for serving beyond this season of giving.
I hope the holidays are a special time for you
and your family.
Charles Dickens summed it best in his famous
"Christmas Carol" after Scrooge realizes the significance of compassion
and charity.
He proclaims, "I will honour Christmas in my heart,
and try to keep it all the year."
In many ways, this is our
calling, too.
