Dear Friend,
During the special election, a lot was on the line. But this year, the stakes are even higher, because the Tea Party is just six seats away from taking control of the Senate.
Your support was instrumental to my victory in the special election, and I need your help this year, too. With the Koch brothers planning to raise nearly $300 million to spend on influencing our politics in this cycle, I need you to help us reach our goals. The FEC filing deadline is tonight at midnight. We need to be at $36,000 by then, and you can help by making a $5 contribution.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Accomplishing something that lasts takes hard work and determination. And we&rsquo;ve worked too hard to turn back now.
Think of all that we&rsquo;ve accomplished, even with the Tea Party&rsquo;s obstructionism -- the end of Don&rsquo;t Ask, Don&rsquo;t Tell, lower student loan rates for new students, new carbon emission standards to end our long, dirty power plant era.
But all that could be for nothing if the Tea Party takes the Senate this November. We&rsquo;re not going to let the Tea Party pick up a Senate seat in Massachusetts -- not if we hit our goals and keep working. Give $5, $10, or whatever you can to help us hit our $36,000 goal before tonight&rsquo;s deadline.
Thank you for your support.
