Congress Must Renew Unemployment Insurance
Last week, I joined Representatives John Conyers (MI-13) and Steven Horsford (NV-4) in addressing the need to
renew unemployment insurance
in the national fight to stop foreclosures and improve our economic standing.
After the 2008 foreclosure crisis, lawmakers worked hard to keep Americans in their homes, easing the effects of the crisis by supporting loan modification programs and financial reforms.
However, six years later, this still remains a serious problem in communities around the country.
Because Congress has failed to extend emergency unemployment insurance benefits, they have forced many Americans into financial hardship, which, in turn, has forced them into foreclosure.
The Senate has already taken steps in the right direction by passing legislation to extend unemployment insurance, it's time for the House to act.
Tens of millions of Americans are still unemployed since the financial crisis half a decade ago, and have lost access to an essential lifeline that belongs to them.
An extension of unemployment insurance would help struggling Americans and boost the economy by leading to an additional 200,000 jobs.
It is time for Congress to take action and keep these vulnerable Americans from losing their homes at the very least.
Rep. Cartwright discusses legislation with Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren.
Introducing the VARIETY Act
.
Last week, Representative Rosa DeLauro (CT-03) and I introduced the
Vegetables Are Really Important Eating Tools for You
(VARIETY) Act, which works to encourage Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients to purchase healthy foods by expanding the Healthy Incentives Pilot (HIP) to the entire program.
HIP, operating only temporarily in Hampden County, Massachusetts, refunded SNAP participants with 30 cents for every dollar they spent on fruits and vegetables, resulting in a 25 percent increase in the consumption of fruits and vegetables.
Our legislation perpetuates this effort by broadening the HIP benefits to all SNAP recipients, giving low-income citizens the power to purchase more healthy foods for themselves and their families.
Currently, over 46 million Americans use food stamps, and have limited access to fruits and vegetables due to recent price increases in healthy foods.
Increased fruit and vegetable intake can reduce rates of heart disease and prevent several cancers, which are major causes of death in the United States and also huge contributors to the national health care economic burden.
Our VARIETY act aims to address both of these issues, along with malnutrition and obesity.
