Dear
Constituents,
Last week I joined the President at the White
House with a bipartisan group of physician lawmakers to witness and
celebrate the signing of the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act
into law. The bill directs over $125 million toward the National
Institutes of Health for pediatric medical research by eliminating wasteful
taxpayer funding of political
conventions.
This bipartisan solution is a firm step towards much needed scientific
research of pediatric diseases and disorders, and will help find cures
for some of the most devastating childhood conditions. Most
importantly, this research will help more children live healthy and happy
lives.
Two weeks ago, I introduced the Protecting
Children from Electronic Cigarette Advertising Act, which would
prohibit the advertising of e-cigarettes to
children.
According to the Centers for Disease Control, 1.8 million middle
and high school students nationwide have tried e-cigarettes, and that
number is dramatically increasing every
year.

As a physician, I have seen the devastating
effects of nicotine addiction first hand. Studies have shown that
nicotine negatively impacts children's brain development. It is
unconscionable that tobacco companies, through the marketing of candy-like
flavored e-cigarettes, are targeting our
youth.
Due to the serious health concerns with e-cigarettes, which may
contain a vast quantity of carcinogens and toxic chemicals, predatory
advertising to children needs to stop. The Protecting Children from
Electronic Cigarette Advertising Act would begin to do just that,
and stop
tobacco companies from creating a new generation of addicted
smokers.
These bills are examples of the kind of
pragmatic, fiscally responsible solutions that I was sent to Congress
to achieve.
As a doctor and now your Representative, I will always
fight for the health of our communities and to protect the most
vulnerable among us. Our children are our future, and protecting that future
should be a shared mission in Congress, regardless of political
affiliation.
Sincerely,
Member of
Congress
