Capitol Update
It's Time To Close NSA Spying Loopholes
Last week, Congressman Cook voted to protect Americans' privacy by
voting for the Massie-Sensenbrenner Amendment, which closes two legal
loopholes that allow the NSA to spy on Americans. This vital amendment
to the Department of Defense Appropriation Bill passed on a bipartisan
293-123 vote.
This amendment would ban warrantless searches of government databases
for information about American citizens. This information includes the
content of emails and telephone calls. Additionally, this amendment
would prohibit the NSA and CIA from placing "back doors" into
commercial software. Not only do these backdoors allow spy agencies to
listen in on Americans' private communications, they can be exploited
by criminals and hackers, putting the information security of people
and businesses at risk.
Cook said, "I'm dedicated to protecting Americans' privacy. Earlier
this year, I supported the USA Freedom Act to protect our
constitutional rights. It was a good first step, but this important
amendment will help rein in our overreaching spy agencies. I'm proud to
support this vital amendment."
The North American Energy Infrastructure Act
Today, Congressman Cook voted for H.R. 3301, the North American Energy
Infrastructure Act. This bill, which passed the House with bipartisan
supports, creates a more modern and efficient cross-border approval
process for oil pipelines, natural gas pipelines, and electric
transmission lines crossing America's borders.
Passing H.R. 3301 will help bring regulatory certainty, create good
American jobs, and facilitate trade with our North American allies.
H.R. 3301 says "yes" to American energy and brings us closer to raining
in the skyrocketing energy costs.
Cook said, "The average cost for a gallon of gas is $4.20 cents in my
district. Every family continues to be pounded by energy prices, be it
at the gas pump, the supermarket, or at home. This bill removes the
barriers to developing North American Energy by lowering energy prices,
and creating good, American jobs. Energy bills like this must continue
to be part of our 'all the above' approach."
Congressman Cook's Department of Veterans Affairs Update
It's important that my constituents are up to date on the most current
actions taken by Congress to fix the broken VA system.
Earlier this month, the House of Representatives voted in favor of H.R.
4810, the Veterans Access to Care Act. This bipartisan bill ensures
veterans who've been forgotten by the VA are able to receive medical
care from the private sector. The Senate passed S. 2450; the Veterans'
Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of
2014 as their response to fixing the critical problems at the VA. Both
these bills are currently before a conference committee where they will
work out some finals details and be merged as one bill. The final bill
will emerge from this committee, be voted on by both chambers, and sent
to the President for approval.
The conference committee held its first meeting last night to start
work on the final version of the bill. It's my hope that the committee
acts quickly to ensure that our veterans are never subjected to the
mistreatment they have seen by the VA again.
District Update
Yucaipa's Dunlap Park Receives Grant
The City of Yucaipa will receive a $322,580 Land and Water Conservation
Fund (LWCF) Grant Award that will create a new five-acre Dunlap
Neighborhood Park.
Earlier this year, in a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of
the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and
Related Agencies, Cook and a bipartisan group of members urged "strong
support for the LWCF," calling it a "time-tested program for the next
generation."
Cook said, "I'm proud that I was able to play a role in securing this
grant for the people of Yucaipa. My most important job in Congress is
responding to the needs of my district, and this grant will go a long
way toward ensuring that Yucaipa's families have recreation
opportunities for years to come."
The LWCF was created in 1964 and established America's most successful
conservation program. LWCF uses no taxpayer dollars and ensures outdoor
recreation activities in every state.
