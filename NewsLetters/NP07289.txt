Dear Fellow Nevadan,
Last week, the Senate took strong
action to get the Veterans Affairs Administration back on track. The
Senate confirmed Robert McDonald, President Obamas choice to lead the
VA. Congress last week provided him the necessary tools to get the job
done. Veterans will soon be able to see a doctor more quickly, and
Secretary McDonald will be able to hold senior officials responsible for
poor job performance.
More still needs to be done to keep
our veterans from falling through the cracks. When we send our men and
women to war, the cost of war should include caring for our veterans. I
will continue to work to ensure that veterans in Nevada, and
throughout the country, receive the care they deserve.

Benefits of the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability
Act
This Act includes a number of provisions to help
veterans receive the care they deserve . It establishes a program
to provide veterans a Veterans Choice Card to address immediate access
needs by obtaining health care from certain non-VA providers. Veterans
unable to receive care at a VA medical facility in a timely manner or
veterans residing more than 40 miles from a VA facility would be
eligible for this program.
Reduces wait times by
providing the VA with resources to expand staff . The VA will have
funds to hire primary care providers, specialty care providers, and
other clinical staff to increase its capacity to provide high quality
health care to our Nations veterans. It would also provide enhanced
incentives to attract more providers to the
VA.
Improves access to care and availability of specialty care services
by authorizing the VA to enter into 27 major medical facility leases
in 18 states and Puerto Rico.
Increases
accountability by granting the VA Secretary authority to immediately remove
incompetent senior executives
based on poor job performance or
misconduct while guarding against the politicization of the VA or other
inappropriate uses, such as whistle blower retaliation, of such
authority by providing an expedited appeal.
Expands support
for veterans and their families
by improving the delivery of
care to veterans who experienced sexual trauma while serving in the
military, expanding the Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry
Scholarship to include surviving spouses of members of the Armed Forces who
die in the line of duty, and expanded in-state tuition assistance for
transitioning service members and family members who qualify for the
Post 9/11 GI Bill.
