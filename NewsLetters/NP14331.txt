Dear Friends,
I joined a bi-partisan majority in the U.S. House to pass the Keep Your Health Plan Act to fulfill the Presidents broken promise that If you like your healthcare plan you can keep your healthcare plan. Period. This is just a small part of the Obamacare train-wreck that we need to repeal and replace.
Let me know your thoughts concerns
as I continue to fight for Wyoming, her people and their chosen healthcare plans.
Sincerely,
Cynthia M. Lummis
