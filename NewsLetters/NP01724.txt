David -- We have nowhere else to turn. In the past two days:
-President Obama asked you to help.
-Nancy Pelosi asked you to help.
That&rsquo;s how urgent this is! John Boehner and his corporate cronies just raised $17.5 million in one night.
YES -- IN ONE NIGHT.
That means we&rsquo;re getting massively outraised.
If we get blown out today, we might as well give up any hope of a Democratic Congress. We&rsquo;re begging you, David. Will you chip in before midnight?
