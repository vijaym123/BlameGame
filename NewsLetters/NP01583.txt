Dear Friend,
TodayIhad the opportunity to open
the Senate Floor after a wonderful two-week work
period back in Utah. This district work period
was busy,from welcoming President Barack
Obama during his first presidential trip to Utah
to speaking to fellow Utahnsabout important
issues likejob creation and tax reform.
I attended several productive meetings and
events, in whichUtahns have consistently
expressed to me their desire to get Washington
out of the way of our lives and our
economy.Icouldnt agree more,
andIve been glad to share
whatIve done in the Senate to help
address these concerns.
I enjoyed speaking with members of the Sons of
the Utah Pioneers at a luncheon held at Salt Lake
Citys Lion House.
I joined a town hall meeting with David Lang,
Managing Director of Operationsof the
Goldman Sachs Salt Lake City Division, and
approximately 350 Goldman Sachs employees.
Ialso swung by a few of Utahs
great news outlets. I spoke withFox
13 news anchor Max Roth to talk about some of the
legislative workIm doing on behalf
of Utahns.
The editorial board at the
Provo Daily Herald
had a number of
questions about my work as Chairman of the
Finance Committee.
KUTV 2 News anchor Ron Bird andI also
had a great discussion.
Trips like these always renew my confidence in
our effort to ensure that Utah values are
represented in Washington.I always
appreciate hearing from you and encourage you to
share your concerns and suggestions with me by
sending an email through my
website.
Sincerely,
Orrin Hatch
