News from Representative John Delaney
December 22, 2013
Dear Friend,
I write today to connect one last time over email before the end of the
year. First things first, I want to thank you for all of the feedback
that you've shared throughout the year. Our office logs every comment
we receive and it is important to me that I know where you stand on
issues that matter to our country.
We've got a big To-Do list for 2014: immigration reform, corporate tax
reform, a full farm bill, rebuilding our nation's infrastructure, and
much more. As 2014 Freshman Class President, you'll be hearing more
from me on these issues next month.
Please take a moment to let me know what you think our nation's budget
priorities should be in the coming year.
In my first year in the House, I was proud to introduce what I believe
is the most substantial piece of bipartisan jobs legislation of 2013.
The Partnership to Build America Act
(H.R.
2084) currently has 25 Republican and 25 Democratic cosponsors and will
create a $50 billion infrastructure fund, financing $750 billion in
projects nationwide. Instead of using taxpayer dollars, the
infrastructure fund would use bond sales to the private sector to
invest in upgrades to our nation's roads and bridges, job creation, and
long-term economic competitiveness. This legislation will be introduced
in the Senate next year, and I will continue to work on building
support for this commonsense legislation.
I was also proud to see my veterans' education legislation pass the
House by a 404 to 2 vote
. The Veterans' Advisory Committee on
Education Improvement Act (H.R. 2011) improves educational and job
training programs and benefits administered by the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) by giving recent veterans of the post 9/11 era a
stronger voice at the VA. Senator Cardin and Senator Inhofe have
introduced a Senate version
of the bill and we're going to
keep pushing this legislation as well.
This year, I also had the opportunity to act as a voice for responsible
government action addressing the national deficit and federal spending.
Having spent twenty years as an entrepreneur and CEO, I firmly believe
that fiscal responsibility and deficit reduction are essential to our
nation's future. This year, I hosted a bipartisan briefing for my
Congressional colleagues with former Senator Alan Simpson, a
Republican, and former Chief of Staff to President Clinton, Erskine
Bowles, a Democrat. With Members of both parties in attendance, my
briefing gave us an opportunity to look at the facts and work together
to find a solution that will help reduce the deficit while investing in
our future.
Last week, I supported the Ryan-Murray Bipartisan Budget Act when it
passed the House because it takes an important step towards this goal.
The budget not only provides a blueprint for responsible government,
reducing the deficit by $23 billion over the next ten years, it also
works to reverse some of the harmful sequester cuts that damaged our
military readiness and stripped vital domestic programs.
While the budget agreement doesn't have everything I believe is in the
best interest of our country, the deal will keep government open and
give Congress an opportunity to focus on our nation's top priorities.
As the House of Representatives considers legislation on deficit
reduction, tax reform, and investment in our nation's infrastructure, I
promise to continue my work to champion the issues that matter most to
Maryland's 6th District.
Sincerely,
John

John
Delaney
December

Dear
Friend,
I
write
today
to
connect
one
last
time
over
email
before
the
end
of
the
year.
First
things
first,
I
want
to
thank
you
for
all
of
the
feedback
that
you&#8217;ve
shared
throughout
the
year.
Our
office
logs
every
comment
we

and
it
is
important
to
me
that
I

you

on
issues
that

our
country.
We&#8217;ve

a

for
2014:
immigration
reform,
corporate
tax

a
full
farm
bill,
rebuilding
our
nation&#8217;s
infrastructure,
and
much
more.
As
2014
Freshman
Class
President,
you&#8217;ll
be
hearing
more
from
me
on
these
issues
next
month.
Please take a moment to let me know what you think our nation's budget priorities should be in the coming year.
In
my
first
year
in
the
House,
I
was
proud
to
introduce
what
I
believe
is
the
most
substantial
piece
of
bipartisan
jobs
legislation
of
2013.
The
Partnership

cosponsors
and

financing
$750

nationwide.
Instead
of
using
taxpayer
dollars,
the
infrastructure
fund
would
use
bond

to
the
private
sector
to
invest
in

to
our
nation&#8217;s

job

and
long-term

This

will
be

in
the
Senate
next

and
I
will

building
support
for
this
commonsense
legislation.
I
was
also
proud
to
see
my
veterans&#8217;
education
legislation
pass
the
House
by
a
404
to
2
vote .
The
Veterans&#8217;
Advisory

on
Education
Improvement
Act
(H.R.

improves
educational
and
job
training
programs
and

the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
by
giving
recent
veterans
of
the
post
9/11
era
a
stronger
voice
at
the
VA.
Senator
Cardin
and
Senator
Inhofe
have
introduced
a
Senate
version
of
the
bill
and
we&#8217;re
going
to
keep

this
legislation
as

I
also

the

to
act
as
a

for
responsible
government
action
addressing
the
national
deficit
and
federal

Having
spent

I
firmly
believe
that
fiscal

and
deficit

are
essential
to
our
nation&#8217;s
future.

I
hosted
a

for
my
Congressional
colleagues
with
former
Senator
Alan

a

and
former
Chief

a

With
Members
of
both
parties
in

my
briefing
gave

the
facts

that
will
help
reduce
the
deficit
while

I

the
Ryan-Murray
Bipartisan

when
it

the

because
it
takes
an

this

The
budget
not
only
provides
a
blueprint
for
responsible
government,
reducing
the
deficit
by
$23
billion
over
the
next
ten
years,
it
also
works
to
reverse
some
of
the
harmful
sequester
cuts
that
damaged
our
military
readiness
and
stripped
vital
domestic
programs.
While
the
budget
agreement
doesn&#8217;t
have
everything
I
believe
is
in
the
best
interest
of
our
country,
the
deal
will
keep
government
open
and
give
Congress
an
opportunity
to
focus
on
our
nation&#8217;s
top
priorities.
As
the
House
of
Representatives
considers
legislation
on
deficit
reduction,
tax
reform,
and
investment
in
our
nation&#8217;s
infrastructure,
I
promise
to
continue
my
work
to
champion
the
issues
that

to
Maryland&#8217;s
