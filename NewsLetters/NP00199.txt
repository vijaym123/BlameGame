Friend-
The President has threatened to veto the annual defense policy bill, which provides critical resources for our men and women in uniform, unless Congress increases funding for domestic agencies like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This threat comes even as 450 additional troops have been sent to Iraq to oppose ISIS.
I think it is simply unconscionable to play politics with our national security in order to promote the Administrations political agenda. See my recent questioning of Defense Secretary Ash Carter on this subject
