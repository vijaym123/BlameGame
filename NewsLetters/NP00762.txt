Friend,
On May 18th, 1965 President Lyndon B. Johnson announced Project Head Start from the White House Rose Garden.
On that historic day he made a commitment to open a window of opportunity for our nation's most at-risk children and their families.
For half a century, Head Start has been one of Americas most popular initiatives because it is one of our most effective.
Nothing contributes more to the success of our children than education.
Rep. Cartwright addresses the crowd at the 50th Anniversary Luncheon hosted by the Luzerne County Head Start Program.
While I recognize that we need to address the countrys budget deficit, we cannot fix our fiscal problems by short-changing our children.
I will fight to ensure that Head Start remains fully funded.
Fifty years after the launch of Head Start, let's ensure the window of opportunity stays open for our nation's at-risk children.
Sincerely,
