Friend,
We did it. We hit our $5,000 goal before the May deadline and had every dollar matched by our group of supporters.
The team has been working so hard over the last couple of weeks to make sure we are prepared for 2016 and
you stepped up to help out.
We know what we can accomplish when we set our minds to something and I can&rsquo;t tell you how much I appreciate your support.
Thanks again for all you do.
Be well,
Ami
