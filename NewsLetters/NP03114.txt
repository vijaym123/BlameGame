Friends,
As you know, last week
President Obama addressed the nation in his annual State of the Union
speech to lay out his agenda for the year ahead. I was honored to have
Cabarrus County Sheriff Brad Riley as my guest to represent all of North
Carolinas law enforcement officers who serve to protect our
freedoms. As I sat on the House floor and listened to the President turn the
page and describe his vision of our nation, I wondered what book he
was reading.
Line by line and page by page, his out of touch
description of our nation and the world puzzled me.
He
described a robust economy where everyone has the job they want. He described
a world free of terrorism and a cowering Vladimir Putin who has
learned his lesson.
Despite the
Presidents assurance to the contrary, folks all across North
Carolina are still suffering and our country faces difficult
challenges.
Veterans in our district who are still trying to find good-paying
jobs and coming up empty-handed are fed up. Workers who are seeing
hours slashed and wages decline because of government red tape and
Obamacares uncertainties are frustrated. Families in our local communities
who are struggling to make ends meet have lost
hope.
I serve in Congress so I can fight for people,
and thats what motivates me to work hard every day to advance policies
that make your life better. Its your real stories that portray a
union very different from President Obamas utopia.
While he
touted the unemployment rate as a success, he failed to acknowledge
individuals who are forced into part-time jobs because of his burdensome
health care law and the nearly 93 million Americans who have dropped out
of the workforce altogether.
The fact is many middle class
families do not feel the effects of a stronger economy and are not
experiencing more
opportunity.
At best, President Obama skipped a few important chapters, and at
worst, he was reading from a fictional book.
I wish he had
addressed reforms to improve care for our veterans and presented an
effective, long-term strategy to dismantle and defeat ISIS. His refusal to
address the drivers of our debt, or the fiscal challenges we face, is an
affront to hardworking
taxpayers.
Further, the President laid out a new chapter that can only be
summarized as a "war on the middle class."
Instead of proposing
ideas to work with Congress, he chose to wave his veto pen and double-down
on the same old, unilateral policies that hurt middle class families
and hold our economy back.
He failed to offer new
initiatives, instead proposing more inefficient regulations, higher taxes,
unworkable programs like Obamacare, and more government intervention in our
lives.
And he refused to even consider bipartisan legislation
that already passed the House, including a bill that would make it
much easier for veterans to find good-paying jobs, even after declaring,
If you want somebody who's going to get the job done, hire a
veteran.
While the President
continues to turn a blind eye to the needs of middle class Americans and
focus on his legacy, my colleagues and I will continue to fight for a
better America with a smaller, more efficient government, a stronger
economy that creates good-paying jobs, and a sound foreign policy that
protects us at home and makes the world a safer place.
President Obamas agenda takes our country in the wrong direction
I
encourage him to put down his veto pen and join the 114th Congress in
focusing on the priorities of the American
people.
Until next
week,
Richard
Hudson
Member of Congress (NC-08)

As hundreds of thousands of Americans joined together in solidarity
to protect the precious gift of life, I proudly
voted
to defend life and ban the use of our hard
earned tax dollars to finance or subsidize
abortions.
You can be sure that I will continue
to stand firm on our shared values to defend life at every step and
fight to end the cruel practice of
abortion.
