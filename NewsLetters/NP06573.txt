Dear Friend:
Last week, I spent the day with U.S. Department of Labor Secretary, Thomas Perez, during his trip to Indianapolis. Our visit included a stop to Indy&rsquo;s south side where construction is taking place on the 465-65 interchange.
There, we met with carpenters, labor leaders, and officials from Walsh Construction Company to learn about the project and how workers there receive job training.
As a member of the Transportation Committee in Congress, I fight hard to ensure Indiana receives critical funding for its infrastructure - including transit, aviation, rail and highway projects like the 465-65 interchange.
These decisions result in jobs for thousands of Hoosiers and millions of dollars in commerce, both from construction and from transportation of goods.
While I am pleased to announce the 465-65 interchange will be completed in November, I know that too many of our country&rsquo;s roads remain in poor condition.
One in four bridges require significant repair or cannot handle today&rsquo;s traffic, while sixty five percent of America&rsquo;s major roads are rated in less than good condition.
What our country needs is a long-term transportation bill that addresses our country&rsquo;s crumbling infrastructure.
Recently, I signed onto a letter asking the leadership in Congress to bring a long-term transportation funding bill to the floor for a vote.
Our country is long overdue for a safer, more modern transportation system.
I take great pride in knowing that my work on the Transportation Committee is making a direct impact on the 7th District.
If you are interested in more information about my work in Washington or if there is anything I can do for you, please contact my office.
