Dear Neighbor,
This
week is Public Service Recognition Week. Its an opportunity for each
of us to recognize the hard work our nations dedicated civil servants
do on behalf of our country.
These are the men and women
at NIH developing life-saving cures. They are the FBI and Homeland
Security agents keeping our country safe. They are the first on the ground
when a natural disaster hits. They protect the air we breathe and the
water we drink. They are the face of America here at home and around
the globe.
This week I am launching a new initiative called
Thank a Fed.
This is a chance to not only
highlight the admirable efforts of our nations dedicated federal employees,
but just as importantly, to identify promising good government
practices.
As Ranking Member of the Oversight and Government
Reform Subcommittee on Government Operations and co-chair of the
bipartisan Public Service Caucus, I know firsthand the dedication and
sacrifice these civil servants make daily. With your feedback, we have an
important opportunity to identify promising good government practices
that could be enhanced, scaled, or replicated to strengthen management
across the federal government.
Maybe it was a hard-working
Social Security Administration employee who worked tirelessly to
process yours or a loved ones benefits?
Was there someone at the
Veterans Health Administration who went the extra mile under trying
circumstances to ensure a veteran you know got the personal care and
attention they deserved?
If so, I want to hear your story how
government was efficient and responsive. You may submit your experiences
by emailing
ThankAFed@mail.house.gov . By sharing your interactions and experiences we can help
identify efficiencies and streamline the way government
works.
Please know I will continue to fight in Congress to stand up for our
neighbors who dedicate their life to public service.
Sincerely,
Gerald E. Connolly
Member of
Congress
