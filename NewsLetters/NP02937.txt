Dear Friend &ndash;
Every year, I have the honor of recognizing home-grown talent through the annual Congressional Art Competition, which is open to all high school students in the 46 th
Congressional District.
The winning artwork will be displayed in the U.S. Capitol for one year and I will honor the winning artist at award ceremonies in both California&rsquo;s 46th District and in Washington, D.C.
The exhibit in Washington will also include artwork from other contest winners from around the nation.
Final artwork is due on April 15, 2015 at 5 p.m. at my District Office at 12397 Lewis Street, Ste. 101, Garden Grove, CA 92840 (no late entries accepted!).
For more details, please visit www.lorettasanchez.house.gov/ArtCompetition or contact Beatriz Mendoza at (714) 621-0102 or beatriz.mendoza@mail.house.gov.
I can&rsquo;t wait to see what beautiful artwork comes out of the 46 th
District this year!
Very truly yours,
Loretta Sanchez
Member of Congress
