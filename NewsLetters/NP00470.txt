I also led another bipartisan and bicameral group of lawmakers to introduce legislation that would help seniors pay for expensive specialty drugs used to treat chronic illnesses by allowing them to request lower co-pays. The proposal, the Part D Beneficiary Appeals Fairness Act , is spearheaded by Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL) and Susan Collins (R-ME) in the Senate and Rep. David McKinley (R-WV) and myself in the House.

DEMILITARIZING POLICE: On May 18, President Obama issued an executive order
limiting the free transfer of military-grade weapons from the Department of Defense to local police departments throughout the country. As one of the leading voices in Congress against police militarization, I'm honored to see that many of the recommendations in my Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act of 2015
are part of the President's order. But I'm going to continue fighting to see these and other policy ideas passed into law to ensure this program - known as the 1033 Program - has proper oversight and local police departments are held accountable.

According to an August 2014 report from HUD, the VA and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH), there has been a 33 percent drop in veteran homelessness since 2010.

Dear
F riends,
This week I introduced &#8211; along with other leading members of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees &#8211; legislation making some of our best colleges and universities more accessible and affordable.
The Need-Based Educational Aid Act of 2015 allows colleges and universities that admit students regardless of their financial background to collaborate on the formula they use to determine how much families can pay for college. Importantly,
when this bill becomes a law it will empower low-income and minority students to access a first-rate education. For more, click

I also led another bipartisan and bicameral group of lawmakers to introduce legislation that would help seniors pay for expensive specialty drugs used to treat chronic illnesses by allowing them to request lower co-pays. The proposal, the
Part D Beneficiary Appeals Fairness Act , is spearheaded by Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL) and Susan Collins (R-ME) in the Senate and Rep. David McKinley (R-WV) and myself in the House. For more, click
