Border Bill Update
I wanted to you know that I am still in Washington, D.C. working with
my House colleagues to address the crisis at the border.
The House was
originally scheduled to adjourn today for its August District Work
Period. I am urging my Republican colleagues to stay in Washington
until a bill to address our border crisis can be passed.
I am hopeful that the House will soon be voting on a bill that will
help secure the border by deploying additional resources (including the
National Guard), establishing a process for the immediate deportation
for anyone caught illegally crossing our border, and curbing President
Obama's executive order pertaining to deferred action for childhood
arrivals (DACA).
Please stay tuned to my Facebook page and Twitter feed for regular
updates.
