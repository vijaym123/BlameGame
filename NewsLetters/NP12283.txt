Dear Friend-
With my support, the House on Tuesday passed a bill to overturn the
reduction in COLAs for military retirees contained in the Ryan-Murray
budget deal. That deal busted the spending caps contained in the 2011
bipartisan budget deal yet singled out the retirement of military
retirees as a means of masking the spending increases. That didn't sit
well with me. The government is in dire need of spending reform and
veterans will be willing to do their part, but targeting veterans is
not the way to thank our career military personnel for their service to
our nation.
Recently, much of the inside the Beltway chatter has focused on the
forecast of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) regarding the harmful
effects of ObamaCare, which has tended to obscure the CBO's overall
long-term budgetary outlook.
The bottom line is that the nation's debt
is set to increase significantly over the next ten years.
According to
CBO (which has tended to underestimate the negative effects of
government fiscal policies), "such a large debt poses a greater risk of
precipitating a fiscal crisis, during which investors would lose so
much confidence in the government's ability to manage its budget that
the government would be unable to borrow at affordable rates."
Beyond
the next ten years, CBO warned, "the fiscal outlook is even more
worrisome."
Given the fiscal difficulties the nation is facing, it would have made
a lot of sense to take the opportunity to reform government spending
programs during the debt ceiling debate.
Virtually every incentive in
Washington counsels in favor of more spending; the debt ceiling is one
of the few instances that focuses lawmakers on the consequences of
their spending habit.
Instead of making progress on the issue,
Congress simply suspended the debt ceiling until March of 2015, which
means there will be no upward limit of debt that can be incurred
between now and then.
According to the Republican staff on the Senate
Budget Committee, this means the national debt will exceed $18 trillion
by the time the ceiling is reinstated.
Last weekend I joined Shannon Bream on America's News Headquarters to
discuss last week's Oversight and Government Reform hearing on the IRS
investigation. I discussed with Shannon the lack of a substantial
investigation into the IRS wrongdoing and the appointment of an Obama
"max out" campaign donor as lead investigator. At this point, in order
for the American people to have confidence in this Administration,
there needs to be a special prosecutor appointed. Watch the full
interview by clicking here.
On Monday, the Obama Administration announced yet another delay of
ObamaCare's employer mandate. This most recent ObamaCare delay
represents an acknowledgement that ObamaCare cannot be implemented as
written without doing significant damage to the economy. The employer
mandate is bad policy and should be fully repealed with the rest of
ObamaCare; however, the Administration cannot simply ignore the clear
requirements of the law, especially when the motivation for the
non-enforcement is transparently political. The President may think
that he can 'do whatever he wants,' but the Constitution says
otherwise. I have authored a resolution
disapproving of the failure of the President to
take care that the laws be faithfully executed.

Dear
Friend&#8211;
With
my
support,
the
House
on
Tuesday
passed
a
bill
to
overturn
the
reduction
in
COLAs
for
military
retirees
contained
in
the
Ryan-Murray
budget
deal.
That
deal
busted
the
spending
caps
contained
in
the
2011
bipartisan
budget
deal
yet
singled
out
the
retirement
of
military
retirees
as
a
means
of
masking
the
spending
increases.
That
didn't
sit
well
with
me.
The
government
is
in
dire
need
of
spending
reform
and
veterans
will
be
willing
to
do
their
part,
but
targeting
veterans
is
not
the
way
to
thank
our
career
military
personnel
for
their
service
to
our
nation.
Recently,
much of
the
inside
the
Beltway
chatter
has
focused
on
the
forecast
of
the
Congressional
Budget
Office
(CBO)
regarding
the
harmful
effects
of
ObamaCare,
which
has
tended
to
obscure
the
CBO's
overall
long-term
budgetary
outlook.
The
bottom
line
is
that
the
nation's
debt
is
set
to
increase
significantly
over
the
next
ten
years.
According
to
CBO
(which
has
tended
to
underestimate
the
negative
effects
of
government
fiscal
policies),
"such
a
large
debt
poses
a
greater
risk
of
precipitating
a
fiscal
crisis,
during
which
investors
would
lose
so
much
confidence
in
the
government&#8217;s
ability
to
manage
its
budget
that
the
government
would
be
unable
to
borrow
at
affordable
rates.&#8221;
Beyond
the
next
ten
years,
CBO
warned,
"the
fiscal
outlook
is
even
more
worrisome.&#8221;
Given
the
fiscal
difficulties
the
nation
is
facing,
it
would
have
made
a
lot
of
sense
to
take
the
opportunity
to
reform
government
spending
programs
during
the
debt
ceiling
debate.
Virtually
every
incentive
in
Washington
counsels
in
favor
of
more
spending;
the
debt
ceiling
is
one
of
the
few
instances
that
focuses
lawmakers
on
the
consequences
of
their
spending
habit.
Instead
of
making
progress
on
the
issue,
Congress
simply
suspended
the
debt
ceiling
until
March
of
2015,
which
means
there
will
be
no
upward
limit
of
debt
that
can
be
incurred
between
now
and
then.
According
to
the
Republican
staff
on
the
Senate
Budget
Committee,
this
means
the
national
debt
will
exceed
$18
trillion
by
the
time
the
ceiling
is
reinstated.
Last
weekend
I
joined
Shannon
Bream
on
America's
News
Headquarters
to
discuss
last
week's
Oversight
and
Government
Reform
hearing
on
the
IRS
investigation.
I
discussed
with
Shannon
the
lack
of
a
substantial
investigation
into
the
IRS
wrongdoing
and
the
appointment
of
an
Obama
"max
out"
campaign
donor
as
lead
investigator.
At
this
point,
in
order
for
the
American
people
to
have
confidence
in
this
Administration,
there
needs
to
be
a
special
prosecutor
appointed.
Watch
the
full
interview
by
clicking
here.
On
Monday,
the
Obama
Administration
announced
yet
another
delay
of
ObamaCare's
employer
mandate.
This
most
recent
ObamaCare
delay
represents
an
acknowledgement
that
ObamaCare
cannot
be
implemented
as
written
without
doing
significant
damage
to
the
economy.
The
employer
mandate
is
bad
policy
and
should
be
fully
repealed
with
the
rest
of
ObamaCare;
however,
the
Administration
cannot
simply
ignore
the
clear
requirements
of
the
law,
especially
when
the
motivation
for
the
non-enforcement
is
transparently
political.
The
President
may
think
that
he
can
&#8216;do
whatever
he
wants,&#8217;
but
the
Constitution
says
otherwise.
I
have
authored
a
resolution
disapproving
of
the
failure
of
the
President
to
take
care
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
executed.
