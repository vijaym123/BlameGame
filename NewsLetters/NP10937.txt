Congressman Lamborn Introduces
H.R. 4357 to Prevent Terrorists From Entering U.S. as U.N.
Ambassadors
April 2,
2014
WASHINGTON, DC
-- Last night,
Congressman Lamborn introduced H.R. 4357, a House companion bill to
S.2195 sponsored by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. This legislation would
prevent those who are known terrorists from obtaining visas to enter the
United States as ambassadors to the United
Nations.
America should not willingly accept into our country a diplomat who helped
hold American diplomats hostage. Diplomatic immunity should not apply
to terrorists. The only way terrorists should be allowed into our
country is if they are coming to face justice. The President can already
deny visas to diplomats for spying. Terrorist activities by diplomats,
past or present, should be dealt with just as severely," said
Lamborn.
This week Iranian President Hasan Rouhani named Hamid
Aboutalebi as Iran's ambassador to the United Nations. A visa application
for Aboutalebi has been filed and if it is approved, would allow him to
enter the United States and travel to the U.N. headquarters in New
York.
Aboutalebi is a member of the militant group The Muslim
Students Following the Imam's Line that took 52 Americans hostage in
Tehran. The hostage situation was a result of Iran's Isalmic
revolution and lasted from 1979 to 1981. Although Aboutalebi is downplaying his
role in the group, his photo is still on the group's official website
that celebrates the hostage situation.
