Dear Friend,
We Must
Prevent Iran from Gaining Nuclear
Capability
One of the gravest global threats that
we as a nation face is the prospect of Iran
gaining the capability to produce a nuclear
weapon, and it must be the policy of the
United States to do everything within its
power to prevent this from happening.
Last Monday, November 24, 2014, Iran and
the P5+1 nations, which include the United
States, China, France, Germany, Russia, and
the United Kingdom, failed for a second
time this year to resolve negotiations
surrounding Irans nuclear program
and extended the talks for an additional
seven months. This should not come as a
surprise.
It is just one more sign that Iran has
no interest in seriously negotiating the
end of its nuclear program and that it is
steadfast in its intention of manufacturing
nuclear weapons. Indeed, this seven-month
extension only gives this dictatorial
regime more time and resources to develop
its nuclear weapons program.
Stopping a nuclear Iran is among the
most important long-term national security
issues we face, and President Obama's
handling of this sensitive national
security threat has thus far been
disappointing. For decades Iran has
unequivocally stated its desire to see the
complete destruction of the United States
and our ally Israel. While Iran insists
that it seeks the development of a nuclear
program for peaceful domestic purposes, it
instead works in the shadows to develop
weapons capable of delivering mass
destruction.
Over the past year, Iran has been
unwilling to make necessary compromises,
and there is little reason to believe this
will change over the next seven months.
This extension, like all of the others,
only leaves the door open for the Obama
administration to make more concessions to
the Iranian regime and to allow Iran to
avoid full implementation of the severe
sanctions authorized by Congress. Any such
concession is simply unacceptable.
This week, the House of Representatives
will consider the
United
States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of
2014 , which, if enacted, will
strengthen the strategic partnership
between Israel and the United States. This
critical legislation not only designates
Israel a major strategic
partner of the United States, but
also expands U.S.-Israeli cooperation in
areas such as defense, intelligence and
homeland security. Such legislation is
vital, but it is not enough. The Obama
administration must do everything within
its power to stop Iran from gaining nuclear
weapons capabilities. I remain committed to
enhancing the necessary sanctions against
the Iranian regime and to demanding full
accountability from the Obama
administration regarding the U.S. role in
these negotiations.
