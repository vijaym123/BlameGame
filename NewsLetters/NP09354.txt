Friends,
Memorial Day is a time to remember and honor those who gave the
ultimate sacrifice in service to our nation. A special day set aside
for all Americans to stop and acknowledge who paid the price for the
freedoms we enjoy. I hope you and your family will take time this
weekend to commemorate this solemn holiday, and take the opportunity to
share what it truly means with young people.
Unfortunately, this Memorial Day comes at a time when our country is
appalled by the shameful way
some veterans
have been treated by the Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare
system.
The negligence and mismanagement at some VA facilities has
become a national outrage, and deservedly so. The more that is revealed
the more disgusting it becomes: Secret waiting lists. Veterans waiting
months to receive care. Falsified data to make VA facilities look good
on paper while veterans suffered and died without treatment.
I don't think it is enough for President Obama and Secretary Shinseki
to just be "mad" about this
. It's time for them to DO something about it. I
fear that a systemic lack of accountability within this administration
has led to a culture of complacency - and that must change. I mean,
what does it take for someone in the Obama Administration to be fired?
Here's what I'm doing about it:
*	This week, the House passed the VA Management Accountability
Act
, a bill I co-sponsored, by an overwhelming 390-33. It
removes legal barriers for swiftly firing senior-level VA bureaucrats
who aren't getting the job done.
*	We recently passed an appropriations bill
increasing funding for veterans health services, with special funding
directed toward mental health care, suicide prevention, and fixing
problems that have contributed to the backlog.
*	I also am working to get the Department of Veterans Affairs to
develop its Patient Centered Community Care program
, which allows VA medical centers to contract with local
hospitals or clinics to get veterans the care they need quickly and
efficiently. Whether it is mental health, dentistry or physical
therapy, why not contract with a local provider when the alternative is
putting a veteran on a waiting list?
I hear from veterans everyday who are waiting on services from the VA.
This is past the point of being a problem. It is a crisis, and I'm
tired of hearing excuses.
Latest on Benghazi Investigation
As you probably know by now, Speaker Boehner asked me to serve on the
House Select Committee on Benghazi
. As I said from the start, our work on the Select Committee will
be done in a thorough and judicious manner.
On Wednesday, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi appointed five Democrats to
serve on the Select Committee as well. I am pleased that our Democratic
colleagues will join us on the Select Committee. This won't be a
partisan effort, but rather an unbiased search for truth.
We held one of our first meetings on Thursday with Chairman Gowdy, and
I remain impressed by his leadership and commitment to follow the facts
wherever they lead. I will keep you posted as the investigation goes
forward.
Improving Water Infrastructure
Last week, Congress approved the Conference Report for the Water
Resources Reform & Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA)
. The House originally passed WRRDA last year,
but a Conference Committee was needed to work out the minor differences
between the House and Senate bill. WRRDA authorizes improvements to our
nation's water infrastructure like ports, channels, and shipyards.
The
bill is especially important for the port in Mobile, which is an
economic engine for the whole state.
The bipartisan bill has been called the most fiscally responsible water
resources bill in our nation's history. WRRDA cuts through red tape and
removes barriers that have inhibited job growth for years. The bill
even offsets new infrastructure projects by deauthorizing old, costly
projects.
The bill represents a major victory at a time when many don't think
Congress can get anything done. Through WRRDA, House and Senate
Democrats and Republicans worked together to pass a commonsense bill
that will spur job creation.
The Week Ahead
Next week, the appropriations process will continue with the Commerce,
Justice, and Science appropriations bill up for a vote. The bill
includes important language ensuring our Second Amendment rights are
protected, as well as providing resources for our nation's law
enforcement agencies. As always with all appropriations bills, there
will likely be a number of proposed amendments, and I will remain
vigilant of any attempts to restrict our Second Amendment rights.
As always, feel free to contact my office
if my staff or I can ever do anything for you. You can
also forward this email to your friends and family to keep them up to
speed on the latest from Washington. I make it a priority to stay in
constant contact with those I represent.

Latest
on
Benghazi
Investigation
As
you
probably
know
by
now,
Speaker
Boehner
asked
me
to
serve
on
the
House
Select
Committee
on
Benghazi .
As
I
said
from
the
start,
our
work
on
the
Select
Committee
will
be
done
in
a
thorough
and
judicious
manner.
On
Wednesday,
Minority
Leader
Nancy
Pelosi
appointed
five
Democrats
to
serve
on
the
Select
Committee
as
well.
I
am
pleased
that
our
Democratic
colleagues
will
join
us
on
the
Select
Committee.
This
won't
be
a
partisan
effort,
but
rather
an
unbiased
search
for
truth.
We
held
one
of
our
first
meetings
on
Thursday
with
Chairman
Gowdy,
and
I
remain
impressed
by
his
leadership
and
commitment
to
follow
the
facts
wherever
they
lead.
I
will
keep
you
posted
as
the
investigation
goes
forward.
