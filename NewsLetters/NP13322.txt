After all the excitement of New Year's Eve, many of you may have looked
at the year ahead and made a New Year's resolution. Whether you're
trying to get in shape, volunteer more, or save money, the beginning of
another year is always a good time to take a step back and think about
what you want to accomplish. With the start of the second half of this
legislative session, it struck me that it might be helpful for Congress
to have some New Year's resolutions of their own!
In that regard, I'd love to hear what you think. There's a whole host
of issues facing Congress this year, but if you had to narrow it down,
what would your top New Year's resolution for Congress be?
Pass a budget and address government spending
Reform the tax code
Create more jobs and strengthen the economy
Address immigration reform
Focus on improving health care
Protect individual liberties
