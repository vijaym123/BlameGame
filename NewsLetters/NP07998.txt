LEGISLATION
July 13, 2014
Dear David,
Over
the past six years, this President has shown little hesitancy in
taking the law into his own hands. This pattern of executive overreach is
especially evident in the ongoing immigration crisis and recent surge
of unaccompanied minors at our southern border. The lax immigration
policies of this administration have directly resulted in the belief
that once immigrants cross into our country, they will be able to
stay.
If the President is serious about finding a permanent solution,
he needs to immediately end his failed pro-amnesty programs, start
enforcing our immigration laws, and make it clear to other countries that
immigrants crossing into the United States illegally will be deported
and sent back to their home countries.
Over the past couple
of weeks, I have joined my colleagues in the House in supporting a
number of bills that would increase border security, deploy the National
Guard to regain control of the southern border, and close loopholes
in current law so we can take immediate action to return unaccompanied
children to their families in their countries of origin and end this
unsustainable path.
Now, the President is asking Congress
for an additional $3.7 billion in additional emergency funding, where
almost half would go to care for the illegal minors now in the US,
rather than expediting a prompt return. In addition, none of this
supplemental funding would go to increasing resources for Border Patrol, ICE
agents, or the deployment of the National Guard to secure the
border.
As Congress continues to work to address our broken
immigration system, I want to hear from you. Please take my survey below and
let me know your thoughts. You can also view my floor speech on this

Last week, the White House formally
requested $3.7 billion in emergency funding from Congress to address
the crisis at the southern border. Do You think Congress should
approve the Presidents request?
