Happy Memorial Day!
Friends,
Today,flags have flown at
half-staffas we honor our fallen
heroes.I am humbled by the selflessness,
patriotism, and bravery of the men and women who
made the ultimate sacrifice to defend the
freedoms we hold dear. To them, we owe a debt of
gratitude.
In March,the Air Force produced shadow
boxes honoring my brother Jesse, who was killed
during World War II. Jesse was a nose turret
gunner, part of the 451st Bombardment Group that
had released more than 300,000 tons of bombs on
enemy targets in Europe. He was killed during a
mission to destroy an oil refinery in Austria. I
was 8 years old at the time of his death. The
shadow boxes held the patches from his uniform,
medals he received, and photos of him and his
unit, just as I remember him when he left our
home. He died fighting for good against evil. I
have strived every day to be worthy of his
sacrifice, as a student, as a Missionary, as a
husband and father, and as a United States
senator.
There are countless such stories of family
members who have made the ultimate sacrifice in
the name of our country and our freedom.I
am inspired bytheirlegacy and
example, and I will continue to work hard to
honorthem.As we all gather with
family and friends today, let us keep these
heroes close in our hearts and minds. After all,
we wouldn't enjoy this day if it weren't for
them.
God bless America,
Senator Orrin Hatch
