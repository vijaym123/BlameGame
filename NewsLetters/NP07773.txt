4th Annual 3rd District Job Fair
I'm proud
to announce on Thursday, August 14th, we will hold our 4th annual
3rd District Job Fair . The purpose of these job fairs is
to help facilitate face-to-face meetings between those looking for
employment and employers/business owners. Throughout the last few years,
thousands of hardworking Kansans have attended our job fairs in search
of a good job. These job fairs have been a tremendous success, and
have helped job seekers make important contacts with employers, leading
to hundreds of jobs being filled. Once again, the fair will include a
special morning hour exclusive to veterans
only.
I greeted several job seekers at a previous job
fair at the Great Mall of the Great Plains in
Olathe.
The job fair is free to attend, and I
encourage everyone looking for work to attend and to tell your friends
and family as
well.

House Continues Appropriations Work
The House
Committee on Appropriations has been hard at work to pass the needed
appropriations bills in a bipartisan way to hold the line on government
spending and eliminate waste. After passing the Financial Services and
General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill last week, the House has now
passed
7 of the 12 required appropriations bills
-
and we will continue this hard work until we're finished. Sadly, the
Senate has yet to pass a single appropriations bill this
year.
I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their
efforts in completing this important work on behalf of the American people.
Click here , or
on the image above, to watch my full remarks from the House
floor.
The
Financial
Services and General Government appropriations bill
(H.R. 5016)
provides the needed funding for the various government agencies,
including the Treasury Department, the Judiciary, the Small Business
Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal
Revenue Service, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Executive
Office of the President, and
more.
This year's legislation provides a total of
$21.3
billion
in discretionary funding for fiscal year 2015, representing a cut
of
$566 million (2.6 percent) below
the fiscal year
2014 funding number, and
$2.26 billion (9.6 percent) below the
Administrations request . The legislation prioritizes
programs critical to enforcing laws, maintaining an effective judiciary
system, and helping small businesses, while targeting lower-priority or
poor-performing programs
such as the Internal Revenue Service
for
reductions. And, the year's FSGG appropriations bill actually eliminates
funding for nine programs totaling
$37.9 million
and
reduces funding for more than a dozen
agencies.
The IRS has been the subject of much
controversy over the last year as they have apologized for targeting
conservative groups for extra IRS harassment. Lois Lerner, one of the
administrators of this program, lost all of her emails and had no backup
system in contravention of U.S. law. She has refused to testify before
Congress on her actions. While the investigation continues, our
legislation attempts to correct some of these errors by ensuring the following
items are included in the
bill:
1) Prohibits IRS Targeting
H.R. 5016 prohibits
any funds from being used to subject organizations to additional
scrutiny based upon ideological beliefs.
2) Protects
the 1st Amendment
H.R. 5016 also prohibits the IRS from
using any funds to target individuals for exercising their First
Amendment rights.
3) Prohibits funding for IRS
bonuses
H.R. 5016 prohibits the IRS from awarding any bonuses to
its employees unless tax compliance and conduct are given
consideration.
4) Prevents Destruction of
Records
H.R. 5016 prevents any funding from being used to destroy,
deface, or dispose or records, regardless of their form or characteristics,
in contravention with the Federal Records
Act.
Violence in the Middle
East
We continue to watch with great concern the violence taking place in
the Middle East.
Israel
continues to face terrorist threats and horrible acts of violence from
terrorist groups like Hamas .
I recently signed a
Congressional letter and cosigned
a
House resolution
stating our support for the unequivocal
right of Israel to defend itself. The House unanimously passed the
resolution.
We have also seen a
terrible and unthinkable tragedy last week as a civilian passenger plane was
shot down in eastern Ukraine, resulting in the deaths of nearly 300
innocent people. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of
those who lost their lives.
Now,
there are grave concerns that the pro-Russia separatist group controlling
the crash site will make it difficult for the international community
to fully investigate the incident. This type of violence is
unacceptable, and the United States should place even stricter sanctions on
Russia for their apparent involvement.
Kansas Corn
Growers Visit Washington
It was a pleasure to meet with
several members of the
Kansas Corn Growers Association
leadership team in my Washington, DC office last week. They were in
town to participate in the Corn Congress, and we had a very
informational discussion as we spoke about many issues important to our Kansas
farmers; including implementation of the Farm Bill, crop insurance,
renewable fuels, and biotechnology.
As Vice Chairman of the House Agriculture Appropriations
Subcommittee, and as a Kansan who grew up on a family farm, I value the input
from these important Kansas agriculture
leaders.
Thank you to Kansas Corn Growers Association
President Bob Timmons, and the rest of the group, for spending time to
visit with me while in Washington.
Sunflower
Foundation 2014 Advocacy Fellowship Class
I recently
had the opportunity to meet with several members of the
Sunflower Foundation's 2014 Sunflower
Advocacy Fellowship class
in Washington, DC. The Sunflower
Foundation focuses on improving the health of all Kansans. We had an
informative discussion about health care legislation in Congress and I
enjoyed receiving an update on their advocacy efforts at the state level
as well.
Thank you
to Jerry Jones, Executive Director of the Community Health Council of
Wyandotte County (left), and the
entire 2014 Sunflower Advocacy Fellowship class
for
taking the time to meet with me, and for your efforts to improve the
health of all Kansans.
House Passes Highway
and Transportation Funding Extension
Last week, the
House passed the
Highway and Transportation Funding Act of
2014
by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of
36755 . I voted "Yes" on this bill. H.R. 5021 extends the Highway
Trust Fund through May 31, 2015, transferring
$7.8
billion
from the General Fund of the Treasury Department to the Highway
Account of the Highway Trust Fund,
$2 billion
to the
Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund, and
$1
billion
in gas-tax-funded monies in the Leaking Underground
Storage Tank Trust Fund to the Highway Trust
Fund.
The extension of the Highway and Transportation
Funding Act means the federal government will continue funding its share of
the costs for transportation projects across the country, helping to
keep road crews, construction workers, engineers and contractors
employed on these important transportation projects. The bill now goes to
the Senate for passage, and on to the president's
desk.
American Dental Association's New Dentist
Conference
It was a pleasure to address the
American Dental
Associations New Dentist Conference
in Kansas City last week. We
discussed a whole variety of issues, from the rising costs of health care,
to student loan debt, the economy and the job market, and immigration
as well.
I appreciated hearing from
these professionals and am thankful for their advice and feedback.
Thank you to the American Dental Association for inviting me to
speak.
Tennis Match for Charity
Last week, after the House
concluded debate and votes for the evening, I participated in a tennis
match competition for charity. This year was the third annual
Washington Kastles Charity Classic Set, and it brought together members of
Congress, national media figures, as well as professional athletes to
help raise money for four different
charities.
This year, my doubles teammate was
Rep. Joyce
Beatty , a Democrat from the 3rd District of
Ohio.
Members of Team Stars gathered for
player introductions; including Martina Hingis on my right and Rep.
Beatty on my left.
Fact of the Week
In 2014, it's estimated that
232,340
women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in the
United States.
Thanks to early
detection, improved treatments, and continued investments in breast
cancer research ( roughly $16.5 billion last year ), the
number of deaths resulting from breast cancer have continued to decline
throughout the past decades.
I'm
proud to sign on as a cosponsor of
H.R. 3680 - the Breast
Cancer Awareness Commemorative Coin Act . This bill would allow
500,000 Breast Cancer Awareness commemorative silver dollar coins to be
minted and sold, with the proceeds going towards increased breast
cancer research. I will continue to support Congressional efforts to invest
in important cancer research, including through the National
Institutes of Health, the National Cancer Institute, and
others.
