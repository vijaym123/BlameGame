Friend -- We&rsquo;re out of words.
Seriously, we don&rsquo;t know how else to say this: The election is in 15 days, and we simply don&rsquo;t have the money.
Our spending is falling behind the Republicans&rsquo; in the final stretch, and it will cost us the Senate if you don&rsquo;t step up.
We have the opportunity to CRUSH McConnell&rsquo;s Senate takeover hopes and transform the political landscape by winning five Southern races that are TIED today.
But if you don&rsquo;t help, big-money GOP donors will rip away our victory in the final moments.
This is your chance: Donate to fight back before midnight tomorrow and Democratic senators will triple-match your gift! YOU can make our win happen.

Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
Unless Democrats step up, our ambitious voter mobilization project will go unfunded. That means our staff in battleground states won&rsquo;t have the resources to knock on tens of thousands of doors. Our volunteers won&rsquo;t be able to make calls. Voters won&rsquo;t show up.
It&rsquo;d be a disastrous defeat.
But it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way:
WE CAN ABSOLUTELY STILL WIN!
If you contribute today, it&rsquo;ll be triple-matched by Democratic senators, sent directly to battleground states, and put immediately toward mobilizing voters for a Democratic victory!!!
With only 15 days left, we&rsquo;re straight-up begging. We can&rsquo;t do this without you. Will you help us?
Thanks so much,
Democratic Victory
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
Thank you for your continued support.
