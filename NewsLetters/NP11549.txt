House Leaders Push Through Polluter Protection
Act
Instead of taking
action to create jobs, or restore benefits to the 2 million Americans
who have been cut off from Emergency Unemployment Compensation since
December 28, the Republican Leadership of the House of Representatives
brought a bill [ H.R. 3826 ] to the House Floor on
March 5 th
to strip
the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency to address carbon
pollution from coal-fired power plants
the largest source of carbon
pollution in the United States.
The House approved the measure on
a vote of 229 to 183.
Also on March 5, House Republicans voted for the
50 th
time to undermine health care
reform.
Speaking
against the bill
on the House
Floor, Rep. Levin said, This time it's the 50th time that House
Republicans have brought up legislation to repeal or to undermine the
Affordable Care Act....
Just look at this -- 50 votes. With zero
votes to raise the minimum wage.
Zero votes to renew unemployment
insurance.
Zero votes to guarantee paycheck fairness.
Zero
votes to pass immigration reform.
The House passed the bill on a
vote of 250 to 160, but
as with the previous 49 attempts
the
measure is not expected to advance further and become
law.
House
Approves Loan Guarantees to Aid Ukraine
On March 6, the House of Representatives voted
385 to 23 to approve legislation [ H.R.
4152 ]
to allow $1 billion in loan guarantees to help restore financial
stability in Ukraine and support that country as Russia continues to
occupy the Crimean Peninsula.
The loan guarantees are intended to
help shore up the Ukrainian economy in the face of reduced energy
subsidies from Russia.
Speaking in favor of the loan guarantee package, Rep. Levin said, This
bill comes at a clearly crucial time.
The people of Ukraine need
to be able to preserve their Nation.
We need to help.
The
people of Ukraine fought for their long-desired independence. We need
to help them keep
it.
Remembering the Freedom
Riders
49 years ago, Rep.
Levins friend and colleague John Lewis helped lead nearly 600 peaceful
protesters on a march for equality and voting rights from Selma to
Montgomery.
The 600 men and women were met with violent opposition,
but they were successful in achieving their goals.
John Lewis was
a member of the first Freedom Riders who sat together on interstate
buses, ate together at segregated lunch counters, and challenged local
segregation laws along the way during the
1960s.
The Freedom Riders changed America
for the better, and we are all the beneficiaries of their bravery.
Rep. Levin and more than 70 other members of the House of
Representatives recently introduced
H.R. 4041 , which would
award the Congressional Gold Medal to the Freedom
Riders.
Rep.
Levin Joins Campaign to Combat Violence Against
Women
On March 6, Rep. Levin
participated in the White Ribbon Campaign
the worlds largest movement of
men and boys working to end violence against women and girls.
Wearing the white ribbon is a pledge to never commit, condone or remain
silent about violence against women and girls.
Unfortunately, one in every four women will
experience domestic violence in her lifetime, and one in six women will
experience an attempted or completed rape.
These statistics are
staggering and completely unacceptable.
Every woman has the
right to live free of fear, harassment and violence.
That is why
Rep. Levin has cosponsored the Family Violence Prevention and Services
Act, the Violence Against Women Act and the International Violence
Against Women Act. These crucial pieces of legislation provide essential
support to victims of violence in the United States and also expand
efforts by the Department of State and USAID to end gender-based violence
internationally.
