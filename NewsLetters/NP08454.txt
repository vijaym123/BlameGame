Working to Re-Open the Bear Creek
Drainage Trail System
6/23/14
On Monday
morning, June 23rd, a group of local outdoor enthusiasts and trail access
advocates gathered in Colorado Springs to celebrate the re-opening
of
the trails
of the Bear Creek Drainage system that were closed after last fall's
flooding.
The trails were re-opened following the concerns of citizens
voiced at the Public Forum organized and hosted by Congressman Doug
Lamborn earlier this month.
" Thank you to the Forest Service and other ownership parties
for re-opening these trails. There is more work to be done, but I
appreciate this step in the right direction."
- Congressman
Lamborn
"We thank
Congressman Lamborn for all of his good efforts to in pushing the Forest
Service...to re-open this area to all recreation."
- Local outdoor
enthusiast Jim Bensberg
"When Congressman Lamborn stepped in to get the process rolling
and bring everyone together, it was really exciting."
- Local
outdoor enthusiast Traci D'Alessio
