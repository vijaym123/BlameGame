Dear Friend &ndash;
On Monday, we'll gather with family and friends to celebrate the last days of summer, but we also must remember why Labor Day was created.
On Labor Day, we honor the many accomplishments of the American worker. We pay tribute to those who fought against all odds for fair pay, a five-day work week, pensions, health benefits, safe working conditions and the right to collectively bargain.
On Labor Day and every day, we thank these courageous men and women for their commitment to fairness and opportunity. Let us remember what those before us achieved and recommit ourselves to these values so that all hardworking Americans have a voice in the workplace.
Wishing you a safe and happy Labor Day,
Loretta Sanchez
Member of Congress
