Congresswoman Vicky Hartzler (MO-4) and the House have approved a
five-year Farm Bill that reforms farm policy, cuts waste and abuse from
the food stamp program, and replaces direct payments to farmers with a
safety net to protect them when they suffer significant losses. This
bill makes significant reforms to farm and food programs while
continuing strong support for rural development, farm credit programs,
and agriculture research that are very important to the state of
Missouri.
"This Farm Bill saves taxpayers $23 billion in mandatory federal
spending," said Hartzler. "This is done, in part, through making major
reforms to farm subsidies, streamlining conservation programs, and
eliminating nutrition loopholes to make these programs more accountable
to taxpayers."
"Taxpayers also benefit from a reform of the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program (SNAP), or food stamps, by eliminating much of the
waste and abuse inherent in the system," continued Hartzler. "It does
this through the closing of the so-called 'heat-and-eat' loophole that
artificially increases benefit levels when states provide nominal
heating assistance, prohibiting the US Department of Agriculture (USDA)
from engaging in SNAP recruitment activities in foreign countries,
ensuring SNAP recipients are not receiving benefits in multiple states,
and establishing a pilot program to give states the option of requiring
able-bodied adults to work for their benefits. It does this without
taking a single morsel of food out of the mouths of hungry children.
These are the first reforms to the food stamp program since the welfare
reforms that were signed into law by President Clinton in 1996."
"The Farm Bill further saves taxpayers' money by consolidating 23
duplicative and overlapping conservation programs into 13," added
Hartzler. "That includes the creation of a panel to conduct peer review
of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) actions that would negatively
impact agriculture."
"While I am pleased with the most components of the Farm Bill, I am
disappointed it does not contain all that I had sought for citizens of
Missouri's Fourth District," stated Hartzler. "For instance, the
provision I supported to repeal the USDA Catfish Inspection Program,
which cuts down on overlapping and duplicative practices, was not
included in the final Farm Bill package. I will continue to pursue this
common sense effort to rein in wasteful government spending and prevent
a potential trade war. Overall, this Farm Bill serves the interests of
both consumers and producers, guaranteeing the United States an
affordable, plentiful, and safe food supply now and well into the
future."

Congresswoman
Vicky
Hartzler
(MO-4)
and
the
House
have
approved
a
five-year
Farm
Bill
that
reforms
farm
policy,
cuts
waste
and
abuse
from
the
food
stamp
program,
and
replaces
direct
payments
to
farmers
with
a
safety
net
to
protect
them
when
they
suffer
significant
losses.
This
bill
makes
significant
reforms
to
farm
and
food
programs
while
continuing
strong
support
for
rural
development,
farm
credit
programs,
and
agriculture
research
that
are
very
important
to
the
state
of
Missouri.
&#8220;This
Farm
Bill
saves
taxpayers
$23
billion
in
mandatory
federal
spending,&#8221;
said
Hartzler.
&#8220;This
is
done,
in
part,
through
making
major
reforms
to
farm
subsidies,
streamlining
conservation
programs,
and
eliminating
nutrition
loopholes
to
make
these
programs
more
accountable
to
taxpayers.&#8221;
&#8220;Taxpayers
also
benefit
from
a
reform
of
the
Supplemental
Nutrition
Assistance
Program
(SNAP),
or
food
stamps,
by
eliminating
much
of
the
waste
and
abuse
inherent
in
the
system,&#8221;
continued
Hartzler.
&#8220;It
does
this
through
the
closing
of
the
so-called
&#8216;heat-and-eat&#8217;
loophole
that
artificially
increases
benefit
levels
when
states
provide
nominal
heating
assistance,
prohibiting
the
US
Department
of
Agriculture
(USDA)
from
engaging
in
SNAP
recruitment
activities
in
foreign
countries,
ensuring
SNAP
recipients
are
not
receiving
benefits
in
multiple
states,
and
establishing
a
pilot
program
to
give
states
the
option
of
requiring
able-bodied
adults
to
work
for
their
benefits.
It
does
this
without
taking
a
single
morsel
of
food
out
of
the
mouths
of
hungry
children.
These
are
the
first
reforms
to
the
food
stamp
program
since
the
welfare
reforms
that
were
signed
into
law
by
President
Clinton
in
1996.&#8221;
&#8220;The
Farm
Bill
further
saves
taxpayers&#8217;
money
by
consolidating
23
duplicative
and
overlapping
conservation
programs
into
13,&#8221;
added
Hartzler.
&#8220;That
includes
the
creation
of
a
panel
to
conduct
peer
review
of
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(EPA)
actions
that
would
negatively
impact
agriculture.&#8221;
&#8220;While
I
am
pleased
with
the
most
components
of
the
Farm
Bill,
I
am
disappointed
it
does
not
contain
all
that
I
had
sought
for
citizens
of
Missouri&#8217;s
Fourth
District,&#8221;
stated
Hartzler.
&#8220;For
instance,
the
provision
I
supported
to
repeal
the
USDA
Catfish
Inspection
Program,
which
cuts
down
on
overlapping
and
duplicative
practices,
was
not
included
in
the
final
Farm
Bill
package.
I
will
continue
to
pursue
this
common
sense
effort
to
rein
in
wasteful
government
spending
and
prevent
a
potential
trade
war.
Overall,
this
Farm
Bill
serves
the
interests
of
both
consumers
and
producers,
guaranteeing
the
United
States
an
affordable,
plentiful,
and
safe
food
supply
now
and
well
into
the
future.&#8221;
