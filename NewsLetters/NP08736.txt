Constituents Hold Washington Feet to the Fire
Dear Friends,
A common danger U.S. Representatives and Senators face is getting wrapped up in Washington politics and distracted from constituent concerns.
I think that was one issue at play in the recent defeat of U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in the Virginia Republican primary.
The leader of the Wyoming delegation is the people of Wyoming.
I strive to listen to your concerns, whether it is through communications with my office or personal conversations in the supermarket line.
I want to fight for the issues that Wyoming considers important, issues like states rights.
So please be sure to
let me know the issues and concerns
that are important to you so that I can accurately and decisively represent you.
Sincerely,
Join the conversation! Stay connected to me through
,
,
and
I look forward to hearing from you soon!
