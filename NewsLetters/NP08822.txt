Friends,
Last week, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
announced new federal regulations on coal-fired power plants. Considering
that 70% of Ohio power is produced by coal, I'm concerned about the
impact these new EPA regulations could have on Ohioans' jobs and energy
bills.
If you're interested in reviewing the EPA rule
yourself,
please click here to access the full version
on the EPA's website .
I want
to hear from you. Please take the survey below and share your thoughts
on these proposed EPA regulations. As always, I greatly appreciate
your
input.
Sincerely,
Dave
