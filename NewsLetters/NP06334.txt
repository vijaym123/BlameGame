Yesterday, I held a Military Service Academy Day at Moody Air Force
Base for high school students interested in attending a service
academy.
Representatives from each of the five academies were present
to answer questions regarding the application and admissions process.
Joining us were representatives from Congressman Jack Kingston's
office, representatives from the offices of Senators Saxby Chambliss
and Johnny Isakson, Lowndes County Commission Chairman Bill Slaughter,
and representatives from the University of North Georgia Cadet
Admissions.
Our military works tirelessly to protect our freedom both at home and
abroad. If recent times are any indicator, we will look towards our
United States military forces to continue to be defenders of our
nation, spreading freedom and democracy, around the globe for the
foreseeable future.
Over 150 high school students and their families attended the event.
It was inspiring to see so many young and talented Georgians here who
want to serve our country by joining the armed forces and become the
dedicated group that will lead our country to a brighter future.
Attending the event in and of itself was a great testament to their
strength of character.
Reminder: the application process is two steps.
An application to the
academy and an application for a Congressional Nomination must be
filled out. If you, or someone you know, are interested in applying for
a Congressional Nomination to attend a service academy, please visit my
website here
to apply.
Feel free to
call Alice Johnson in my Tifton Office should you have any questions:
(229) 396-5175.
The deadline for submissions is October 24th.
Working for you:
Last week, the House passed several pieces of legislation, but there
are two that I would like to highlight.
I voted for H.R. 5078, the
Waters of the United States Regulatory Overreach Protection Act
, which puts a stop to the EPA's overreach that
could hurt agriculture production and landowners in the Eighth
District.
Instead of allowing the EPA to circumvent state and local
governments in order to regulate our waters, this legislation
reinforces a federal-state partnership.
State and local communities
are stewards of their natural resources because they depend on them as
a source of livelihood, and they know their own water sources best.
H.R. 5078 makes sure it stays that way.
I also supported H.R. 3522, the Employee Health Care Protection Act
,
which enables more Americans to keep their health plans. I've heard
from many of you back home who have lost the health plan that best fits
your needs or have been struggling with higher premiums.
This
legislation protects millions of Americans slated to lose their
insurance this fall by giving small businesses and their employees
flexibility to keep their plans or choose from new, more affordable
options.
Sincerely,
Austin Scott
Member of Congress
