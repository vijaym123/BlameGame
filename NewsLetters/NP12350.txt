Congressman Perry Postpones Town Meetings
YORK, PA
Due to the potential of severe weather later this week, U.S. Representative Scott Perry (PA-4) will be postponing a series of town meetings originally scheduled for Thursday and Friday.
The town meetings originally scheduled to take place Thursday, February 13 in Springettsbury Township and on Friday, February 14th in Lower Windsor Township and Lemoyne Borough have been postponed due to the impending weather.
The new town meeting schedule is as follows:
Monday, February 17 / 1:30 - 3:30 p.m.
- Hanover Hospital Wellness and Education Center, 400 York Street, Hanover
Monday, February 17 / 6:30
8:30 p.m.
HACC / Gettysburg Campus, 731 Old Harrisburg Road, Gettysburg
Monday, March 10 / 11:30 a.m.
1:30 p.m.
Springettsbury Township Building, 1501 Mt. Zion Rd, York
Monday, March 10 / 6-8 p.m.
- Lemoyne Borough Building, 510 Herman Avenue, Lemoyne
The town meetings scheduled for Monday, February 17 in Hanover and Gettysburg remain as scheduled. The meeting scheduled for Lower Windsor Township will be re-scheduled in the coming months.
These town meetings continue Congressman Perrys efforts to actively solicit constituent feedback. Since taking office in January 2013, hes met with hundreds of constituents via individual meetings and site visits, conducted several in-person town and tele-town meetings, and aggressively has utilized social media to interact with the citizens he serves. Nearly 10,000 constituents have signed up for regular updates via Congressman Perrys e-newsletter, Facebook or Twitter pages. Social media venues such as these allow him to solicit constituent feedback and provide information on the issues before Congress, while also saving hard-earned taxpayer resources.
Residents who are unable to attend such meetings in person are welcomed to contact Congressman Perry and his staff at any of his offices, or via perry.house.gov, where they can sign up for e-mail updates and for his new Facebook, Twitter and You Tube pages.
