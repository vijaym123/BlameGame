Time to fund the Department of Homeland Security
Dear David,
In a bipartisan vote last Friday, the Senate voted to fund the Department of Homeland Security through the end of the year.
Our bill ensured nearly 800 Montanans are able to defend our borders and secure our airports - and get paid for it.
Keeping the government funded is Congress' most basic job.
That's why two-thirds of the Senate voted for the bill.
But the U.S. House refused to take it up.
Instead, the House passed a short-term extension to keep DHS running for just seven days.
Seven days.
The House is continuing the same short-sighted approach that led to government shutdowns and near-economic defaults in the past.
That's absolutely unacceptable, and it's not what we in Congress were elected to do.
It jeopardizes our national security at a time when international threats like ISIS draw the world's attention.
It puts $7 million of Montana's emergency funding at risk.
And hard-working men and women who work to keep our nation safe could be asked to leave their post or work without pay if Congress doesn't step up.
Congress needs to fund DHS through the end of the year and then we need to address our nation's immigration problem.
The current system is amnesty by inaction.
The American people deserve a comprehensive solution.
I don't support doing a job half-way and I don't support members of Congress keeping the broken immigration system we have now.
The Senate passed a bipartisan comprehensive reform package last Congress that would have solved our immigration problem and strengthened our borders. The House never took it up.
I hope the House will finally put this bill to a vote, so that we can finally pass that bill and move forward on these issues in a responsible way.
It's time for folks to put political games aside, roll up our sleeves and get to work.
As always, it's a pleasure to serve you in the U.S. Senate.
Take care,
