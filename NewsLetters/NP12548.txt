Dear Friend,
My priority is to provide you with the best services possible.
Therefore, should you ever need any assistance communicating with a
government agency or if you need information regarding any program,
please do not hesitate to contact my office
.
I also make every effort to listen to your issues of concern. This past
month I held Town Forums throughout Northwest Indiana in order to
directly address your questions. If you were unable to attend one of
these Town Forums, or if you ever have any questions or concerns
regarding any legislation or policy, please do not hesitate to e-mail
me
.
As we move forward this coming year, I will continue to work to create
jobs and grow the Northwest Indiana economy. By working together, I
believe that we can invest in our region for the success of future
generations, and one immediate investment that I will continue to
support is the expansion of the South Shore Rail Line
.
To receive regular updates from my office on the work that I am doing
to invest in the future of Northwest Indiana, I would encourage you to
sign-up for my e-newsletter by clicking here

Sincerely,
Pete
