A MESSAGE FROM CONGRESSMAN STENY
H. HOYER
Please join me tonight from 6:15 to 7:00 p.m. for a telephone town
hall to discuss issues important to Marylands Fifth Congressional
District, including jobs and the economy. Citizens living in the Fifth
District
Calvert, Charles and St. Marys counties and portions of
Prince Georges and Anne Arundel Counties
can participate by
calling (877) 229-8493 and using the pin number
12897.
The telephone town hall will operate much
like a large-scale conference call between myself and Fifth District
residents. Before the town hall begins, Fifth District households will
receive a phone call inviting them to join the town hall. Call
recipients have the option of staying on the line to hear opening remarks from
me, followed by a question and answer session. If you do not receive a
phone call but would like to participate, please call (877) 229-8493
and use the pin number 12897. I hope you will join me.
With warmest regards,
I am
Sincerely yours,
Steny H.
Hoyer
