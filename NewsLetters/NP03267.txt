Dear Friend,
Every year I celebrate Women&rsquo;s History Month by honoring the extraordinary women who are shaping history every day &ndash; our mothers, our sisters and our friends in 46th District.
Do you know a woman who lives or works in the 46th District that deserves recognition?
Fill out this form and nominate her to be one of my 2015 Women of the Year!
Nominations are due January 31, 2015, and the award recipients will be recognized in March.
If you have any questions, please call the Congresswoman's district office at 714-621-0102 or email Beatriz Mendoza at
beatriz.mendoza@mail.house.gov .
Very truly yours,
Loretta Sanchez
Member of Congress
