Sen. Dole Continues Kansas Tour
It
was truly an honor to once again visit with my friend
Sen. Bob
Dole
as he continued his tour throughout Kansas last week.
This time around, Sen. Dole was in Wyandotte County and met with Kansans
at the Hilton Inn in downtown KCK. I have a great admiration for Sen.
Dole - he has spent a lifetime serving his fellow Kansans, the people
of our country and is a true public servant in every sense of the
word.
Thank you, Senator Dole,
for your many years of service. It was great to see you
again.
Email Privacy Act: 210 Bipartisan
Cosponsors
The
Email Privacy
Act, H.R. 1852 , is legislation I introduced to update our
nation's electronic communications privacy laws, something that hasn't
been done in nearly 30 years. I was quoted in several national
articles that described the importance of my bill and the need for Congress
to pass reforms that finally provide the same 4th Amendment protections
to Americans' personal emails that postal mail and paper documents
already receive.
"In the House, the Email Privacy Act, which would
require a warrant for email access, has 209
cosponsors.
Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-Kans.) , who authored the Email
Privacy Act, said there is growing support for the common sense
bill.
It has overwhelming bipartisan support with new
co-sponsors being added every day, and momentum is continuing to build as
the public learns more about government agencies reading Americans'
emails and spying on them without due process and without a warrant, he
said in a statement The
Hill."

"A bill
to fix all of this is currently working its way through Congress, but
surprisingly, Democrats have been slow to support it and are allowing
Republicans to claim this issue as their own. The Email Privacy Act
(HR 1852), introduced by
Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-KA) , is
now sponsored by 211 Representatives -- 136 Republicans and 75
Democrats."

VA Treatment Delays Greatly
Concerning
The recent news about secret waiting lists and backlogs at the
Veterans Affairs facility in Phoenix is deeply concerning. The brave men and
women who have sacrificed through military service deserve quality and
timely treatment that they've earned. It was shocking to learn how VA
administrators destroyed documents and went out of their way to cover
up already-unacceptable delays for veterans to receive
treatment.

to read more from
CNN.
The House will vote later this week on
legislation that would give leaders more flexibility to fire or demote
executives and administrators and hold them accountable within the
VA. There are over 600,000 veterans on waiting lists today just to have
their claims processed. Our military men and women deserve better and
we will ensure that our commitment to them is
fulfilled.
KCK Chamber Congressional Forum
Last week, I
attended the
Kansas City, Kansas Chamber of Commerce Congressional
Forum
to give members a detailed update on legislation
currently before Congress. Congressional Forum was created 46 years ago to
create a way for the 3rd District Representative and the members of the
business community to stay in touch. This is one of the few chambers
in the United States that has a Congressional Forum program, and KCK's
is certainly the longest running. Today we discussed the federal
budget and balancing our books, Environmental Protection Agency mandates
in Wyandotte County and more.
Thank you for the invitation to speak with you once
again.
National Association of Home Builders
I enjoyed
attending the
National Association of Home Builders 2014
Legislative Conference
in Kansas City last week. I joined my
House colleague Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II (MO) for a discussion about the
increasing burden of federal regulations and the importance of home
ownership across the metro area.
Thank you for inviting me to participate in this important
discussion.
Rotary Club of
Shawnee
As a fellow Rotarian, it was good to visit and speak at the
Rotary Club of Shawnee's
morning meeting last week. It was
great to see several familiar faces and we had a good conversation about
the federal budget, frustrations about the current gridlock in
Washington, as well as the need for more Congressional accountability with
federal agencies.
Thank
you for the invitation to join you and for the great discussion about
these important issues.
Institute for Real Estate Managers Speakers
Series
I enjoyed being a guest speaker for the
Institute for Real Estate Management (IREM) Speakers Series
Thursday afternoon. I visited with members and attendees about
leadership in Washington, D.C. and how as the Representative from the 3rd
District of Kansas, I represent a diverse constituency within a rural,
suburban and urban district.
Thank you for the invitation to visit and speak with you last
week.
Providence Medical Center
I
visited
Providence Medical Center
in Kansas City, KS last week and
received an informative update from the leadership team there. The
dedicated staff at Providence provides award-winning health care services to
residents in Wyandotte, Leavenworth and northern Johnson counties and
surrounding areas. I look forward to hearing of their continued
success.
Thank you to CEO
Randy Nyp for the invitation to visit and for showing me
around.
Visiting with Sumner Academy Government
Students
I had a great time visiting with the students at
Sumner Academy of Arts and Sciences
in Kansas City, Kansas on
Friday afternoon. These articulate and energetic students had
excellent questions regarding issues before Congress, issues of leadership
and the future of our country.
Thank you to Mr. Michael Riley, government teacher, for the
invitationto visit.
Police Officers Memorial Day
Ceremony in Washington
Thursday, May 15th was National
Peace Officers Memorial Day, and thousands of Americans gathered in
Washington, D.C. for a ceremony to honor and recognize all those courageous
law enforcement officers who have lost their lives while on
duty.
While giving a U.S. Capitol
tour to some 3rd District constituents on Thursday, a member of my staff
took this photo showing the large crowd that gathered to recognize
the extraordinary efforts of the brave men and women who serve to
protect our communities.
Thank you to
all the law enforcement officers serving to keep our communities in
the 3rd District safe and secure.
