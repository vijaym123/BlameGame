Congressman Don Young Wishes Alaskans a Very Merry Christmas
Ho ho ho, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! As Alaskans, we are fortunate to live in a state of such majestic beauty. As many of you know, my love for Alaska began more than 50 years ago and has only grown in the years since. One of my great loves is our Alaskan spirit, especially during the Christmas season; the generosity of our people and our giving nature certainly sets us apart.

Congressman Youngs Christmas Video Message
As we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ this Christmas, lets keep in mind that the Holiday season is about family and the love we share for each other. Its about friends and family gathering together to share in the traditions that define us not only as family or community, but as an entire nation.
I wholeheartedly believe in the Christmas and Holiday spirit. God has been kind to us through his many blessings and I am thankful for this every day. I must also offer my many thanks and gratitude to the servicemen and women who serve to protect the freedoms we know in this country, especially during the holidays.
To all Alaska, I wish you a very joyous time together with loved ones as we enter into 2014. Take care of yourselves and may God bless you and your families.
