Friend,
By including all three of our opponents in their Young Guns Program, the Republican establishment in Washington has put a clear target on our campaign.
They&rsquo;re serious about their efforts to sway our district, no matter which opponent we face after the primary.
We can&rsquo;t sit back and let this happen.
This commitment by the National Republicans means that all three opponents will have insider resources to launch their attacks.
That&rsquo;s where our team comes in.
We need the resources to respond &ndash; and until Monday, we have a donor willing to match contributions dollar for dollar.
Double your impact now.
Please pitch in $5 or whatever you can afford to our Rapid Response Fund.
This has been a tough year with the gridlock in Congress, and we&rsquo;ve been working hard to be your advocate in Washington.
While we are pressing Republican leadership to take up issues that need to be addressed, from immigration reform to passing a commonsense budget, our opponents are on the attack.
You still have time to be involved in our Rapid Response Fund donor match.
Can we count on your $5 today to help us push back on the Washington players who want a say in our district?
I know we&rsquo;re stronger.
Now we need to prove it.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
P.S.
The dollar for dollar match only lasts until Monday.
Please consider a contribution right now to show that our team isn&rsquo;t intimidated by the Washington money that&rsquo;s been promised to our opponents.
