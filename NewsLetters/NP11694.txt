Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Despite the heavy snow that blanketed the streets and delayed flights, we had a busy week up in Washington. I met with delegates from the UF/IFAS Council for Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching (CARET) to discuss issues affecting the Central Florida agriculture and citrus industry. IFAS is playing a critical role in agriculture research and education, particularly in dealing with the greening disease that has gripped Floridas citrus groves. During our meeting, I received an update on different aspects of the industry and discussed further ways to develop our agriculture economy.

On Thursday, I offered an amendment and managed the debate for the Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Development (RAPID) Act. You can see a
short synopsis of the bill here
as I discussed it on the House Floor. Essentially, the RAPID Act establishes a more streamlined and transparent federal permitting process for construction projects to avoid waste and duplication of effort among bureaucratic agencies. It also sets an 18-month maximum deadline for bureaucratic considerations, and a 36-month maximum deadline for an Environmental Impact Statement, which will ensure that environmental considerations do not drag on endlessly.
The amendment that I offered on the RAPID Act specifically supports Florida infrastructure projects. My amendment, which passed by voice vote, would streamline the permitting process for several critical infrastructure projects that have been stalled around our state
in some cases for upwards of 17 years. These infrastructure projects, such as deepening the channel at Port Everglades, hold enormous potential for job creation and economic growth in Central Florida. You can watch my
full remarks on the House floor here.

This weekend, I spoke at the Walk for Life sponsored by True Life Choice pregnancy center. True Life Choice simultaneously held three walks in the Orlando area on Saturday in order to raise awareness and funds for the work that they are doing to protect the sanctity of life. I realize that life is a gift, and Sandy and I are grateful every day for the blessing of our six children and eight grandchildren. As members of the Central Florida community walked for life this weekend, I joined them in mourning the loss of the millions of children whose lives have been prematurely extinguished, and celebrated the sacrifices that many are willing to make in order to choose life.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Recently, a constituent from Clermont was surprised to learn from the IRS that his inactive small business owed significant back taxes and fines. Although he tried to get in touch with the IRS to see where these fees originated, the constituent became frustrated when he could not get any help or answers. The constituent called my office to request assistance, and we submitted a Congressional Inquiry on his behalf. In a short time, the Taxpayer Advocate Service let him know that they had reviewed his situation, realized they had made a mistake, and assured him that the penalty was being removed.
Constituent Services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.

Legislative Update:
This week, the President once again chose to delay key portions of the Obamacare law until after the next election. Obamacare simply isnt working. The President has admitted as much by repeatedly delaying its deadlines and requirements until a more politically convenient hour. Regrettably, those delays have predominantly been limited to politically connected entities.
Unfortunately, individuals continue catching the brunt of the Obamacare debacle and remain the real losers. The American people have already suffered increased premiums, plan cancellations, loss of their doctors and limited choices. Now, many Americans who dont want or need Obamacare will be forced to pay a tax penalty at the end of the year if they refuse to participate.
Joining colleagues from both sides of the aisle, I voted in support of the Suspending the Individual Mandate Penalty Law Equals (SIMPLE) Fairness Act this week, which would suspend the individual mandate tax penalty until 2015. If those with political connections are receiving a break, the least we can do is extend the same treatment to individuals and hardworking taxpayers struggling to make ends meet in this sluggish economy.
