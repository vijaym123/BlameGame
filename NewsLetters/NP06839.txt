David -- We&rsquo;re reviewing our supporter records before tomorrow&rsquo;s ad buy deadline. Your record is below:
David Johnson Email: dj724530@gmail.com Suggested Support: $5.OO
We know you&rsquo;re probably heading out for Labor Day, so we&rsquo;re glad we caught you.
Thanks to your support this year, we&rsquo;re taking on Obama-bashing Republicans (thanks!). But right now, our Democratic candidates are getting ripped apart by Karl Rove&rsquo;s ad blitz. Rove&rsquo;s ads are vicious -- and COMPLETELY deceptive.
That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re emailing. We want to fight Rove's lies -- but we HAVE to hit this $1 million goal before tomorrow&rsquo;s ad buy deadline.
We&rsquo;re getting close -- but unfortunately, we&rsquo;re still coming up short. Can you chip in $5 or whatever you can right now?
Your donation will be matched.
