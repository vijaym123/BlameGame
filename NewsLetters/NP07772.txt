David --
Sorry to email you so early on a Sunday, but this is important.
John Boehner, Eric Cantor, and Paul Ryan just wrote mega checks to Bob Dold&rsquo;s campaign. Why now? A new poll shows our race in a DEAD HEAT.
Republicans think with enough cash they can just buy this election. If we don&rsquo;t respond, the GOP strategy might just work.
David, we&rsquo;ve got to fight back and break the tie. Can we count on you to have Brad&rsquo;s back?
