Congressman Lamborn
Statement on National Monuments
Legislation
3/26/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn joined a bipartisan House majority in
supporting H.R. 1459, the Ensuring Public Involvement in the Creation of
National Monuments Act. This bill passed 222 to
201.
Today, I supported H.R. 1459 to make sure
that the American people have a voice in our National Monument
process. This process should be more open and transparent by going through
the Peoples House rather than the White House. It is unfortunate, but
Presidents of both parties have used the Antiquities Act to
inappropriately designate National Monuments. The Act should be used to protect
significant cultural and historical artifacts, not as a delivery
mechanism for political favors. The House took a much-needed, bipartisan
step to add transparency, openness, and public input to our
National Monument and Antiquities
process.
