Friend,
Did you see Janine&#39;s email? Ami&#39;s 49th birthday is coming up!
Those of us at campaign HQ are going to try to celebrate, but to be honest, we&#39;ll only have time to have a quick bite of cake before we get back to work.
The primary is a short three months away (gulp), and things are speeding up.
Can you help us celebrate Ami&#39;s birthday by chipping in $4.90 or more to help us meet our $4900 goal?
This is a rare opportunity to double your impact with our dollar for dollar match.
A generous friend of the campaign has offered to match contributions up to $4900, until Sunday, in honor of Ami&#39;s 49th birthday.
If we can hit the target, that would put us at $9800 raised for the end of February - an amount that will make a difference in our operations here in Sacramento County.
But here&#39;s the catch -- we only have until Sunday (Ami&#39;s birthday) to hit our $4900 goal.
We&#39;ve already raised $1,498 towards our goal.
Can you chip in $4.90, $49, or even $490 to help us raise the remaining amount?
Click here to make a contribution in honor of Ami&#39;s 49th.
Thanks for being a part of this team - and be sure to treat yourself in Ami&#39;s honor on March 2nd!
Thanks again,
Team Bera
