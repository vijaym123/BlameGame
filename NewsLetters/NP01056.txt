U.S. HOUSE PASSES CONGRESSMAN PITTENGERS LEGISLATION
TO MAKE BUREAUCRATS LISTEN TO SMALL
BUSINESSES
Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives passed my
bipartisan legislation to make Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
regulators pay attention to the concerns of small businesses, community banks,
and credit unions when developing new rules and
regulations.
The
Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection
Advisory Boards Act
(H.R. 1195)
was approved by a bipartisan
vote of 235-183.
The CFPB continues to issue
new
regulations designed for massive, systemic-risk financial
institutions without considering how those same rules harm small businesses,
community banks, and credit unions.
Small
businesses create jobs.
Community banks and
credit unions support local businesses.
Most bureaucrats
just support new rules.
This bipartisan legislation
will give small businesses, credit unions, and community banks a voice in
proposed regulations, allowing for adjustments that protect consumers
while giving small businesses the freedom to grow and create good
paying jobs.
H.R. 1195 creates a permanent and
active small business advisory board to advise CFPB regulators throughout
the rule-making process.
Members must represent a small business
dealing with financial services products.
The
legislation also makes permanent two existing advisory boards representing
credit unions and community banks.
Currently, both boards are
voluntary and could be eliminated at any time at the discretion of the CFPB
Director.
The advisory boards will be paid for by making a
very small reduction (0.1%) in the amount of money the CFPB is
allowed to draw from the Federal Reserve over the next ten years, and will
not hinder the CFPBs core mission of protecting
consumers.

Congressman
Pittenger Fights for Small
Businesses
On April 21st, the U.S. House of
Representatives debated Congressman Robert Pittenger's "CFPB Advisory Boards
Act" (H.R. 1195), which would force DC bureaucrats to consider how
proposed regulations might negatively impact small businesses, community
banks, and credit unions.

HONORING A TRUE AMERICAN HERO
On April
25th, America honored a hero from our community.
Sgt. Matt Cooke received the Purple Heart for wounds received when he
shielded a fellow soldier during the 2009 Ft. Hood attack.
Click here for a slideshow of the special
ceremony.
Sgt. Matt Cooke was
wounded in the 2009 Fort Hood attack because he chose to jump in
front of the bullets, not run for cover.
When Nidal Hasan
opened fire, Sgt. Cooke flung himself on top of a fellow soldier,
saving that soldier's life even as Sgt. Cooke was shot five
times.
Unfortunately, the Obama Administration originally classified the
massacre as "workplace violence,"
meaning
Sgt. Cooke and
other soldiers wounded in the attack were not eligible for the Purple
Heart and received fewer disability benefits than soldiers wounded in
Iraq or Afghanistan.
Sgt. Matt Cooke was my
special guest for the 2014 State of the Union Address.
Click here for a slideshow of his visit to Capitol
Hill.
In response, I
co-sponsored the
Honoring the Fort Hood Heroes Act
(H.R. 3111) , which directed the military to award the Purple Heart to
soldiers wounded or killed as a result of the Fort Hood attack, and
to provide appropriate benefits.
Language from H.R. 3111 was
later included in the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act, which
became law in December 2014.
On April 25th, Sgt. Cooke finally
received the recognition he deserved.
Yet
Sgt. Cooke
didn't display tremendous bravery in combat in hopes of future
recognition or reward.
He displayed tremendous bravery because he is a
true American hero.
Please join me in thanking Sgt. Cooke
for his service.
