Friends,
I would like to share with you my updated district events
schedule for this week.
We have had a change of location for
the 'Coffee with Your Congressman' event tomorrow morning.
We will still meet in Surfside Beach at 9:30 am but instead of
Eggs Up Grill, we will meet at the Plantation Pancake House.
I hope
to see you at some of the events throughout the district this
week!
Tom
