TWO NEW VETERANS AFFAIRS CLINICS
IN McMINN AND ROANE COUNTIES
EXPAND VETERANS' ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE
Congressman Chuck Fleischmann cuts the ribbon at the Veterans Affairs
Clinic in Athens, signifying the official opening of the new clinic.
Last week, two new, state-of-the-art Veterans Affairs clinics opened in
East Tennessee, one in Athens and the other in Roane County. This marks
a significant victory for the brave men and women who dedicated their
lives to our country. Veterans in our district will now have vastly
improved access to the quality health care they need and so rightfully
deserve.
As the proud son of a WWII veteran, ensuring proper care of veterans
has always been a top priority of mine.
After watching my father
struggle with the complex and inconvenient VA system, I felt a personal
responsibility to improve veterans' access to health care in East
Tennessee. No veteran should have to drive hours to a medical clinic
just to be faced with long wait times and inadequate assistance.
The two clinics in Athens and Roane County will greatly expand veterans'
access to primary care and mental health services. The opening of these
clinics serves as much needed improvement to veterans' care in East
Tennessee.
Sincerely,
Chuck Fleischmann
