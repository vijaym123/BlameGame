*I apologize for the buzzing noise in the audio. My
staff is working to remedy this for future videos
This week President
Obama released his disappointing and unacceptable budget proposal for FY
2015. This budget hurts DHS in a time when the department needs
structure and enforcement, the proposed cuts to ICE and the Coast Guard are
not only foolish, but a slap in the face to the hard-working
individuals protecting our borders.
The
Presidents budget is another example of why Americans and Congress alike cannot
trust this Administration. Three months ago President Obama signed
and endorsed a bipartisan budget agreement. However, his wish-list this
week proposed for $56 billion above that agreement. Fifty-six billion
that American tax-payers will be forced to pay for.
For
the next several months I will work diligently to scrutinize this
proposal and ensure DHS has the appropriate funding needed in FY
15.
On Wednesday, March 5, 2014, the House passed
H.R. 4118 , the SIMPLE Fairness Act , by a
vote of 250-160 with the support of 27 Democrats. (See
Roll Call #97 ). H.R. 4118 delays for one year the implementation
of the penalty tax for failing to comply with the individual health
insurance mandate. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates will
save taxpayers an estimated $9 billion over the next decade. In a
struggling economy, this legislation is a solution to protect all Americans
from additional rising health care
costs.
This week, the House passed several bills to increase the energy
supply in the United States which will lower the energy and heating costs
for families in their home. The extreme weather this winter has
doubled heating bills for many hard-working families from all over the
country. These pieces of legislation will lower the cost for families
using electricity, gas, and propane to heat their
homes.
I am now headed back to Texas to work in the
district for the weekend. Our next session begins March
11.
