Dear Friend,
You may have heard about the scheduling problems and wait times facing
veterans at certain medical facilities within the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA). This is deeply concerning, and I am working to
ensure veterans are receiving the timely and quality care they were
promised and have earned.
Last month, I visited the VA facility in Livermore and was assured by
the director and her staff that while long wait times and access issues
are occurring at VA centers across the country, this is not the case in
the Bay Area. I will diligently work to ensure this is true.
On Monday, the VA released a preliminary audit, finding that the VA
Palo Alto Health Care System (VAPAHCS), Livermore Division requires
further review regarding its scheduling practices. Upon hearing this
news, I called the acting director of the VAPAHCS directly to learn
more. The need for the Livermore VA's further review was triggered by
an employee expressing concerns about staff training. While this review
is a first step, it raises further concerns about the care our veterans
are receiving. We await the full report, which will provide further
details as to potential problems at the Livermore facility. We must
take action to improve care for all veterans.
