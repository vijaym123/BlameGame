Serious and Disturbing
Picture of VAs Failure to Provide
Timely Access to Care
The release of the VAs Nationwide
Access Audit of veterans health facilities
paints a serious and disturbing picture of
the VAs system-wide failure to
provide timely access to care for our
nations heroes. I am especially
concerned by the number of facilities that
serve Washington state veterans that have
been flagged for further review and
investigation. This information confirms
what I have been hearing from so many
veterans who are struggling with extended
wait times in the Pacific Northwest.
Thankfully,
the
Senate overwhelmingly passed the
Sanders-McCain compromise , legislation
aimed at addressing transparency, wait
times, and accountability issues at the
VA. This legislation is a critical
step toward addressing some of the
immediate accountability and access
concerns plaguing the VA. In addition, as
further investigations and reviews are
completed, we need to keep working to
ensure the VA continues to take substantive
action to address any management, resource,
and personnel shortcomings that have
contributed to todays findings.

Crushing Student Loan Debt is Hurting
Our Graduates
Too many borrowers in Washington state
and around the country are struggling under
the crushing weight of student debt. At a
time when higher education is more
important than ever to our nations
long-term competitiveness, a college degree
shouldnt drown borrowers in debt.
Now, and in the future, we need to make
sure that people who choose to further
their education and build their skills are
better able to afford college and manage
their student debt. It is an economic
imperative. To strengthen our middle class,
to strengthen our workforce, and to help
spark economic growth, Congress needs to
address these challenges. That is why
I was proud to join in co-sponsoring the
Bank on Student Loan Emergency Loan
Refinancing Act, a bill that would allow
borrowers with federal student debt to
refinance at current rates.
Unfortunately, yesterday, Senate
Republicans blocked consideration of this
bill.
As Chair of the Senate Budget Committee,
I
held
a hearing last week on the impact of
student loan debt on borrowers and the
economy . At the hearing, we
discussed how student loan debt has lasting
repercussions for young adults as they
start their careers, and holds back the
economy by limiting borrowers
economic activity. I will continue to call
on my colleagues in Congress to ease the
burden of student loan debt by passing
legislation allowing borrowers to refinance
their federal student loan debt to
todays rates.

Strengthening Social Security Benefits
for Seniors, Persons with Disabilities,
and Young Adults who Face Serious
Hardship
I was proud to join Senator Mark Begich
(D-AK) in introducing the Retirement and
Income Security Enhancements (RAISE) Act
a set of commonsense proposals to
modernize, enhance, and protect our Social
Security system in a fiscally responsible
way. The RAISE Act would strengthen
benefits for seniors, persons with
disabilities, and young adults who have
faced serious hardship in their immediate
families, while helping to shore up the
Social Security Trust Fund using an
approach that protects middle class
families, and asks those who can afford it
to pay their fair share. At a time
when Social Security is an increasingly
critical source of support for so many, the
RAISE Act would take some important steps
to ensure our Social Security system is
doing everything possible to help seniors
and their families.

Stop Child Summer Hunger
During the school year, low-income
children have the opportunity to receive
free or reduced-priced meals at school.
However, millions of these same children go
hungry during summer break. Thats
why I was proud to introduce the
Stop
Child Summer Hunger Act , a long-term,
common-sense solution to reducing child
hunger during school breaks. This
legislation will provide families who have
children eligible for free or reduced-price
school meals with an electronic benefit
transfer (EBT) card. This EBT card will
include funds that the family can use to
purchase food to replace the meals that the
children would otherwise be receiving at
school. The threat of hunger
doesnt take a summer break. We
shouldnt either. We must do
more to make sure kids get the nutrition
they need to learn, grow, and thrive.
