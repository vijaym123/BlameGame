Rokita Readings
A clickable offering of books and articles that I've read recently and
highly recommend, as we strive together to "Keep the Republic."
Featured in this week's Rokita Readings is an article I recently read
by Thomas Donlan titled "The Myth of Social 'Security'
."
As the debt ceiling increase was debated in Congress this week, I was
reminded of this column from last year.
It is relevant, because yet
again, the debate focused on the wrong thing.
We continually reach our
borrowing limit for one reason - politicians in Washington refuse to
reform what is driving our debt and runaway spending - social
entitlement programs.
To be sure, Medicare is in far worse shape than Social Security.
You
can learn more about the numbers behind all automatic spending in my
debt presentation here
.
Donlan remembered a Barron's column from 1936 warning of what the
government was up to when it created Social Security.
This very plain
and common sense column on Social Security perfectly explains why we
face $17 trillion in debt.
People pay far less into Social Security
(and certainly Medicare) than they receive.
It is easier to pass the
bill to our children and grandchildren than pay for it ourselves.
It
is certainly easier to sell a policy to voters when hiding the true
cost!

Connecting Hoosier Workers and Hiring Employees - the 2014 Rokita
Career Fair
Along with the Greater Kokomo Economic Development Alliance
, West Central WorkOne
, and Ivy Tech Community College
, I held the 2014 Rokita Career Fair in Kokomo last
Friday.
Nearly 600 Hoosier jobseekers attended the event, which featured nearly
60 area employers with immediate openings.
Those who attended were appreciative of the efforts of all involved.
I
am looking forward to hear success stories from jobseeker and employer
alike in the coming weeks.
This is an example of what government can do to help people get back to
work and to grow our economy.
This is not a government program or a
handout.
This was a conduit to connect employers and potential
employees.
I, along with my House Republican colleagues, have coauthored,
cosponsored, or voted for over 40 bills that lead to direct job
creation that are sitting on Harry Reid's desk.
It's more than time to
help put Americans back to work and get past political games.

Meeting with Hoosiers - Congress on Your Corner in Logansport
Last Friday, I also met with Hoosiers during a Congress on Your Corner
event in Logansport.
Rep. Rokita discusses the debt in Logansport 2-7-14
Many of those in attendance continued to express their concerns over
ObamaCare, the debt, and executive overreach by the President.
I will
be posting many of the comments, questions, and my responses on my
Facebook page
this weekend.
Thank you to the City of Logansport and Mayor Ted Franklin for making
the city building available for this event.
_____
Debt Ceiling - Future Generations Deserve Better
This week the House and Senate both voted to extend the nation's
borrowing limit, or debt ceiling.
I voted against this irresponsible
act.
Future generations deserve better.
Responsible solutions to help all Americans and their children live
better lives continue to be cast aside in favor of short term political
gain.
Hitting the debt ceiling is a symptom of our overspending.
As much as some want to stick their heads in the sand and ignore the
problem, it does not change the math.
We simply spend too much.
The
only way to avoid hitting the debt ceiling and running into economic
turmoil-now or in the future-is to cut spending and reform entitlement
programs.
I will continue to fight for all Hoosiers so they can build better
lives for themselves.
False political debates, and crushing debt only
lead to an economic crisis and leave future generations worse off in
the long-term.

Thank you for your continued interest in Congress and for supporting my
efforts in Washington. Take care.
Sincerely,
Todd Rokita

Along

I
held the
2014

Nearly

which
featured
nearly

who

I
am
looking

to
hear
success
stories
from
jobseeker

in
the
coming
weeks.
This
is
an
