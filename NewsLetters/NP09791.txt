This Administration needs to be held accountable. I wanted to provide you with a brief roundup of the actions that were taken in the House by my colleagues and me last week to accomplish that goal.
Voted to establish a select committee to investigate the attack on the consulate in Benghazi.
The American people dont just deserve answers, they deserve the truth. And uncovering the truth should not be a partisan objective.
Voted to request Attorney General Holder appoint a special, nonpartisan counsel to investigate the targeting of conservative groups by the IRS . It is critical that the head of the investigation be unbiased, to ensure that those responsible are held accountable for their actions.
Voted to hold Lois Lerner, former IRS official, in contempt of Congress
for her refusal to testify about the IRS targeting of nonprofit groups based on their political beliefs. Getting to the bottom of the IRS targeting is not about politics its about the principles that this country was founded on. Principles like justice, accountability, and equality before the law.
Introduced legislation before
the House Judiciary Committee to prohibit the NSA's bulk data collection
and provide increased congressional oversight of surveillance decisions. Americas security must not cost Americans civil liberties.
Yours in service,
Randy
PS
I will continue to fight for vigorous accountability, transparency, and oversight. Read more about my recent legislative efforts,
