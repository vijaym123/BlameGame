NEW MEXICO TRUCKING ASSOCIATION WELCOMES
CONGRESSMAN PEARCE AS KEYNOTE SPEAKER
On Saturday, May
2nd, Congressman Pearce addressed the New Mexico Trucking Association
Inc.'s annual event. Along with bringing together the trucking industry,
the New Mexico Trucking Association also held a job fair aimed at
hiring Veterans the day prior.
"This organization has my
full respect for both their vital role in the American economy and
also for their dedication to get Veterans hired. Not only do they
provide goods to New Mexicans and beyond, but they also pay special
attention to improving their communities," said Pearce. Congressman Pearce
first met Johnny Johnson, Managing Director for the Association, during
an event in Carlsbad last September hosted by Truckers Aganist
Trafficking.
"I appreciate being able to speak to this group
of individuals who have decided to vigilantly fight human trafficking
both here in New Mexico and throughout the country. It is not a topic
that many people want to talk about, but the fact is that America
faces a serious human slavery problem today. These men and women have
decided to stand together and not let this tragedy continue, and for that
I give them the highest respect and gratitude."

VISITS EUNICE TO SPEAK WITH FIRST RESPONDERS, VISIT VETERANS'
MEMORIAL
"I had a great visit
to Eunice during this work week in New Mexico," said Pearce. " Thank
you to Mayor Matt White and City Manager Marty Moore for showing me the
new Veterans' Memorial in Eunice. We must never forget the sacrifices
made by the men and women of our armed forces, especially those who
made the ultimate sacrifice."
Congressman Pearce was
also able to visit with first responders in Eunice. " These brave men and women place their lives on the line each day,
and I value their service. A number of the millennial first responders
we met are carrying on a family tradition of service as
firefighters."
