More than 180 of my colleagues have already signed my bill, H.R. 1010,
which would do just that. We're seeing support for raising the minimum
wage building across the country and across the political spectrum in
favor of giving working families a raise. Congressional Republicans
should heed this resounding call.
Join me on Facebook
and Twitter
- the time has come to allow a vote on H.R. 1010 and raise
the federal minimum wage to lift working people out of poverty, create
jobs, and move America forward.
Sincerely,
GEORGE MILLER

Dear
Friend,
Last
night,
in
President
Obama's
strong
call
to
action,
he urged
Congress
to
get
on
board
and
increase
the
federal
minimum
wage
to
$10.10
an
hour
so
that
hard-working
Americans
with
full-time
jobs
don&#8217;t
have
to
raise
their
families
in
poverty.
You
can
watch
the
clip
here:
More
than
180
of
my
colleagues
have
already
signed my
bill, H.R.
1010,
which
would
do
just
that.
We're
seeing
support
for
raising
the
minimum
wage
building
across
the
country
and
across
the
political
spectrum
in
favor
of
giving
working
families
a
raise.
Congressional
Republicans
should
heed
this
resounding
call.
Join
me
on
Facebook
and
Twitter
-
the
time
has
come
to
allow
a
vote
on
H.R.
1010
and
raise
the
federal
minimum
wage
to
lift
working
people
out
of
poverty,
create
jobs,
and
move
America
forward.
