Dear Friend,
Thank you very much for signing up for our eNewsletter. I appreciate
the opportunity to serve as your Representative. I wanted to give you
this update on our activities in the Second District and Washington,
D.C.
Debt Ceiling
This week the House and Senate both voted to raise the United States'
borrowing limit, which I could not support. Our nation must come to a
place where fiscal responsibility is a top priority. We will never
reach a balanced budget by continually raising the debt ceiling. I
could not vote to raise the debt ceiling because I do not support
driving our nation down a road of increased debt. At some point, we
have to say enough is enough.
Saddling our children with a legacy of debt before they even receive a
paycheck of their own is not good business. The federal government
should take cues from families and businesses across the nation who
have to make the tough decisions and take the necessary cuts in order
to remain financially stable.
If we are serious about getting our nation back on track, let's prove
it by reaching common sense solutions that are more than just lip
service and rhetoric. Let's foster a business climate that encourages
the entrepreneurial spirit, helps create jobs, and results in a
thriving economy.
McIntosh County property owner Lee McClellan and McIntosh County
resident Jill Dew stopped by to visit with one of our team members,
Dwayne Thompson, during some of our mobile office hours this week.
New Subcommittee Appointment
I am honored to have recently been appointed to the House Natural
Resources Committee's Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee.
The energy sector is critical for Oklahoma and our state is home to
four energy companies on the Fortune 500 list. The energy sector also
provides many good jobs for our state. In fact, one in every six jobs
in Oklahoma is either directly or indirectly supported by the oil and
natural gas industry. So serving on this subcommittee will only benefit
our state and the Second District.
The switch in subcommittees means I will no longer serve on the
Subcommittee on Water and Power.
The Second District will benefit from my work on this committee. Our
district has both mining and energy production. Also, part of the
southern leg of the Keystone XL Pipeline runs through our district.
It was good to have the Oklahoma League of Postmasters visit
Washington, D.C. this week.
Propane Crisis Update
Many Oklahomans have the felt the effects of higher propane prices due
to the harsh winter temperatures. The continued extreme cold has
affected many who rely on propane to heat and operate their homes.
Because of this propane crisis, the U.S. Department of Transportation
Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) has extended its
emergency declaration easing the federal hours-of-service regulations
for areas of the country hit hard by propane shortages and the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has issued a ruling to prioritize
propane shipments to affected areas.
The FMCSA emergency declaration, which covers Oklahoma, is extended to
March 1, 2014. This extension by the FMCSA is good news because it will
help facilitate more deliveries from commercial trucks bringing propane
to Oklahoma and other states affected by the shortage.
The extended cold temperatures are causing a spike in demand.
Additional factors contributing to the problem include the high use of
propane for grain drying last fall that depleted some of the inventory
prior to the onset of winter and the exporting of more than 20 percent
of the country's propane. I have been informed that those exports have
been slowed recently to deal with our national problem.
Our office is continuing to closely monitor the situation, keep people
informed and working to help connect those in District 2 who truly
cannot afford to heat their homes with services that may be able to
offer some assistance.
Low-income Oklahomans who use propane as their primary or only source
of heat may get assistance from the Oklahoma Department of Human
Services (DHS). Governor Mary Fallin issued an executive order January
31 for DHS to expedite applications for federal Low Income Housing
Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and Energy Crisis Assistance Program
(ECAP) financial aid.
EPA Overregulation
Last week I had the opportunity to discuss EPA overregulation on the
House floor with many of my colleagues. Thanks to Congresswoman Vicky
Hartzler for hosting a Special Order on the House floor as several of
us addressed the detrimental effects of EPA overregulation.

on what this agency is doing to our nation.
Week Ahead
It will be great to be back in Oklahoma this next week, traveling
throughout the Second District. I look forward to visiting with you in
your community.

Dear
Friend,
Thank
you
very
much
for
signing
up
for
our
eNewsletter.
I
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
serve
as
your
Representative.
I
wanted
to
give
you
this
update
on
our
activities
in
the
Second
District
and
Washington,
D.C.
Debt
Ceiling
This
week
the
House
and
Senate
both
voted
to
raise
the
United
States&#8217;
borrowing
limit,
which
I
could
not
support.
Our
nation
must
come
to
a
place
where
fiscal
responsibility
is
a
top
priority.
We
will
never
reach
a
balanced
budget
by
continually
raising
the
debt
ceiling.
I
could
not
vote
to
raise
the
debt
ceiling
because
I
do
not
support
driving
our
nation
down
a
road
of
increased
debt.
At
some
point,
we
have
to
say
enough
is
enough.
Saddling
our
children
with
a
legacy
of
debt
before
they
even
receive
a
paycheck
of
their
own
is
not
good
business.
The
federal
government
should
take
cues
from
families
and
businesses
across
the
nation
who
have
to
make
the
tough
decisions
and
take
the
necessary
cuts
in
order
to
remain
financially
stable.
If
we
are
serious
about
getting
our
nation
back
on
track,
let&#8217;s
prove
it
by
reaching
common
sense
solutions
that
are
more
than
just
lip
service
and
rhetoric.
Let&#8217;s
foster
a
business
climate
that
encourages
the
entrepreneurial
spirit,
helps
create
jobs,
and
results
in
a
thriving
economy.
McIntosh
County
property
owner
Lee
McClellan
and
McIntosh
County
resident
Jill
Dew
stopped
by
to
visit
with
one
of
our
team
members,
Dwayne
Thompson,
during
some
of
our
mobile
office
hours
this
week.
New
Subcommittee
Appointment I
am
honored
to
have
recently
been
appointed
to
the
House
Natural
Resources
Committee&#8217;s
Energy
and
Mineral
Resources
Subcommittee.
The
energy
sector
is
critical
for
Oklahoma
and
our
state
is
home
to
four
energy
companies
on
the
Fortune
500
list.
The
energy
sector
also
provides
many
good
jobs
for
our
state.
In
fact,
one
in
every
six
jobs
in
Oklahoma
is
either
directly
or
indirectly
supported
by
the
oil
and
natural
gas
industry.
So
serving
on
this
subcommittee
will
only
benefit
our
state
and
the
Second
District.
The
switch
in
subcommittees
means
I
will
no
longer
serve
on
the
Subcommittee
on
Water
and
Power.
The
Second
District
will
benefit
from
my
work
on
this
committee.
Our
district
has
both
mining
and
energy
production.
Also,
part
of
the
southern
leg
of
the
Keystone
XL
Pipeline
runs
through
our
district.
It
was
good
to
have
the
Oklahoma
League
of
Postmasters
visit
Washington,
D.C.
this
week.
Propane
Crisis
Update
Many
Oklahomans
have
the
felt
the
effects
of
higher
propane
prices
due
to
the
harsh
winter
temperatures. The
continued
extreme
cold
has
affected
many
who
rely
on
propane
to
heat
and
operate
their
homes.
Because
of
this
propane
crisis,
t he
U.S.
Department
of
Transportation
Federal
Motor
Carrier
Safety
Administration
(FMCSA)
has
extended
its
emergency
declaration
easing
the
federal
hours-of-service
regulations
for
areas
of
the
country
hit
hard
by
propane
shortages
and
the
Federal
Energy
Regulatory
Commission
(FERC)
has
issued
a
ruling
to
prioritize
propane
shipments
to
affected
areas.
The
FMCSA
emergency
declaration,
which
covers
Oklahoma,
is
extended
to
March
1,
2014.
This
extension
by
the
FMCSA
is
good
news
because
it
will
help
facilitate
more
deliveries
from
commercial
trucks
bringing
propane
to
Oklahoma
and
other
states
affected
by
the
shortage.
The
extended
cold
temperatures
are
causing
a
spike
in
demand.
Additional
factors
contributing
to
the
problem
include
the
high
use
of
propane
for
grain
drying
last
fall
that
depleted
some
of
the
inventory
prior
to
the
onset
of
winter
and
the
exporting
of
more
than
20
percent
of
the
country&#8217;s
propane.
I
have
been
informed
that
those
exports
have
been
slowed
recently
to
deal
with
our
national
problem.
Our
office
is
continuing
to
closely
monitor
the
situation,
keep
people
informed
and
working
to
help
connect
those
in
District
2
who
truly
cannot
afford
to
heat
their
homes
with
services
that
may
be
able
to
offer
some
assistance.
Low-income
Oklahomans
who
use
propane
as
their
primary
or
only
source
of
heat
may
get
assistance
from
the
Oklahoma
Department
of
Human
Services
(DHS).
Governor
Mary
Fallin
issued
an
executive
order
January
31
for
DHS
to
expedite
applications
for
federal
Low
Income
Housing
Energy
Assistance
Program
(LIHEAP)
and
Energy
Crisis
Assistance
Program
(ECAP)
financial
aid.

had
the
opportunity
to

EPA
overregulation
on
