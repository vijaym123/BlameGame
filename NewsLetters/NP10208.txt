Celebrating Innovation
This week, I had the privilege of being a part of the Savannah River
National Laboratory's 10th birthday celebration.
Since its designation
as a national lab ten years ago, the SRNL has made incredible steps
forward in innovation, given back to the community with student
internships, and made great efforts in helping our wounded warriors
find their places in the job market.
South Carolina is an excellent place to do business, and the SRNL is a
very valuable part of the community. The Aiken Standard has more
on the event.
Emphasizing Mentorship
A mentor has the opportunity to step into someone's life, help them
realize potential, and find new opportunities to grow. That's what my
mentor, John Moniz, did for me when I was on the wrong path in high
school.
I am a strong believer in the power of mentoring and the importance of
paying it forward, and I really enjoyed talking to cadets at the
Citadel this past week on the importance of both being and having
mentors.
No doubt these bright young people will go on to be assets
to each and every one of their communities.
As we gear up for an extremely busy spring season, you can follow me on
Facebook
, twitter
, Youtube
, and Instagram
for daily updates on my work in Washington
and at home.
It is an honor to serve as your voice in the United States Senate, and
I value your thoughts, ideas, and feedback.
Please do not to hesitate
to reach out to my office if we can ever be of assistance to you.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott
