Rep. Miller: A-10s Live to Fight Another Day
Washington
&#8211; Today, U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10),
Vice Chair of the House Homeland Security Committee and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security,
issued the following statement on the upcoming House vote on the FY15 National Defense Authorization Act that protects the A-10 fleet from divestment:
&#8220;Since the President introduced his 2015 defense budget proposal to eliminate the entire A-10 fleet, his second attempt since 2012, those of us who understand the indispensable protective services it provides our ground troops in combat have fought back.
&#8220;The A-10 &#8216;Warthog&#8217; is the most effective weapons system used to protect our combat forces on the ground. Just two weeks ago, U.S. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Raymond Odierno told Congress that our ground troops &#8220;believe&#8221; in the A-10 and have confidence in
its ability, above any other aircraft, to protect them in combat.
&#8220;Our troops put their lives in harm&#8217;s way to protect ours, and they deserve every protection we can afford to provide them &#8211; including the A-10 ground support.
We will not let them down.
I am confident that after the House finishes its last hours of debate
on the defense authorization, the final bill will stop the divestment of the fleet, including 107 th
Fighter Squadron at Selfridge Air National Guard Base.
The A-10 will live to fight another day.&#8221;
Background:
In 2012, Rep. Miller successfully defeated the Administration&#8217;s attempt to eliminate and/or reduce the Air National Guard personnel and assets, including the A-10 Thunderbolt aircraft, based at Selfridge Air National Guard Base.
As a result of her efforts,
the National Defense Authorization Acts of 2013 and 2014 preserved Air Guard resources until an analysis could be conducted on the Air Force and its current and future structure with respect to its mission.
The
detailed report , completed earlier this year by the National Commission on the Structure of the Air Force, included recommendations to the President, the Department of Defense and Congress to evaluate and improve the
overall structure of the Air Force.
Specifically of note, the Commission recommended that the Air Force place greater reliance on the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve to lower overall military personnel costs and produce a more ready and capable force.
Despite this recommendation, the Administration is once again seeking to undermine one of our most capable, cost-effective resources by eliminating the entire A-10 fleet used by the Air Guard without identifying a replacement.
