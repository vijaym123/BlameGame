Senate Projection: 50 Democrats - 50 Republicans
Friend -- Democrats are surging at the EXACT right moment: We&rsquo;ve ERASED deficits in SIX states with only 9 days left!
But the
New York Times
reports, &ldquo;With the political tide against them, Democrats&rsquo; last chance to hold their Senate majority comes down to a vigorous get out the vote effort.&rdquo;
Our FINAL-WEEK Get Out The Vote Deadline hits at midnight. President Obama warned,
&ldquo;The DSCC&#39;s Get Out The Vote operation is our final line of defense against Republicans winning&hellip;
If we fall short before midnight, we could lose the Senate.&rdquo;
We still have a $86,098 deficit in our final-week GOTV budget -- we&rsquo;re SO close. We&rsquo;ll triple-match your gift until midnight&rsquo;s deadline.
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
If today&rsquo;s projection comes true, it&rsquo;d be a disastrous election night for the GOP.
ABC News
reports, &ldquo;If Republicans&hellip; fall one seat short of controlling the Senate, it will rank among the most crushing failures in recent political history.&rdquo;
Grassroots supporters have put us so close to victory -- thank you so much.
We&rsquo;re sorry to HAMMER you with emails, but we&rsquo;ve got to ask once more. We&#39;ll win in 9 days if we can get every single grassroots Democrat on board.
