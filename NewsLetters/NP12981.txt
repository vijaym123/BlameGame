"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."
- Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
Dear Friend,
If Martin Luther King, Jr. were alive today, I'm confident he would be
standing shoulder to shoulder with us in Washington, fighting the
legislative battle to extend emergency unemployment benefits to working
men and women across America who've lost their jobs through no fault of
their own. And who are struggling to find work and support their
families.
So we dedicate this week's Monday Report to Dr. King, and to his
steadfast commitment to the proposition that every American deserves a
job to sustain them, and every person has the opportunity to live up to
their full potential in life.
Part of the ongoing fight for economic justice in this country is the
renewal of the earned unemployment insurance to these workers, and I
have continually called for a vote on this subject. Take a moment and
watch what I told my colleagues from the Floor of the House last week:
Happy MLK Day - and have a great week.
Sincerely,

No More Secret, Job-Killer Trade Agreements!
Congressman Nolan met last week with U.S. Trade Ambassador Michael
Froman to discuss
ongoing negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).
We can't afford to lose one more good American job to one more global
trade agreement negotiated in secret.
That was my message to U.S. Trade Ambassador Michael Froman last week
as we discussed the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which could become
one of the largest and most significant international trade agreements
in history.
Over four long years and 19 sessions, Congress has been excluded from
TPP negotiations. That needs to change long before we are required to
take a vote on the TPP. Given a fair chance and a level playing field,
American workers and American manufacturers can compete globally and
win every time.
However, they can't do it with one hand tied behind their backs by
secret trade agreements rammed through Congress under Presidential fast
track authority; agreements placing them at a competitive disadvantage
with counterparts around the world who aren't required to adhere to our
strict health, safety, and environmental standards.
The simple truth is: the primary beneficiaries of these kind of trade
agreements are large, multi-national corporations, and our trade
negotiators have been selling American manufacturers and workers short.
It's time we turn that around and create a level playing field.
Nolan to EPA: Boost Renewable Fuels in Gasoline
Congressman Nolan pressed U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator Gina McCarthy to increase the agency's proposed 2014
ethanol and biodiesel fuels requirements for gasoline.
Ethanol and biodiesel, so important to America's farm and rural
economy, should be blended into gasoline in larger - not smaller -
amounts in 2014. Why? Because experts in the field say that blended
ethanol and biodiesel fuels are better for the environment and cheaper
for everybody.
That's what fellow Minnesotan and House Agriculture Committee Ranking
Member Collin Peterson and I and others told U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency Administrator (EPA) Gina McCarthy last week in
Washington. We called the meeting because EPA has proposed to lower the
amount of ethanol and biodiesel blended in 2014 substantially below
Congress' recommendation. Administrator McCarthy was very receptive to
our concern that cutting the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) would harm
our farm and rural economy, and discourage investment in renewable
fuels technology, critical to reducing both our nation's carbon
footprint and dependence on foreign oil. We will keep pressing EPA to
bring their proposed 2014 number - 15.21 billion gallons - up to
Congress' number - 18.15 gallons - in their final rule.
A side note: After several productive meetings with EPA Region 5
Administrator Dr. Susan Hedman on haze issues across Voyageurs National
Park and the Boundary Waters, and Highway 169 on the Range, it was good
to finally meet Administrator McCarthy and find her so knowledgeable
and open-minded on issues of importance to the 8th District and the
state of Minnesota.
Budget Agreement's Good for Minnesota and Our 8th District Beyond the
welcome fact that we began 2014 with a bipartisan agreement to fund the
government and avert another costly and unnecessary shutdown, there is
good news for the 8th District, the Great Lakes, and the state of
Minnesota in the omnibus budget bill Congress passed last week.
The measure includes $3.5 million specifically designated to prevent
the spread of invasive and destructive Asian Carp into the Great Lakes.
Those funds augment my amendments in the Water Resources bill to (1)
close the St. Anthony Lock and Dam to stop the carp from threatening
our northern Minnesota sport fishing and tourist industry; and (2)
provide the Army Corps of Engineers with more tools to fight invasive
species by changing the official definition to include animals as well
as plants.
In addition, we secured an extra $15 million for the Great Lakes
Restoration Initiative - a top priority of mine over the past year.
Among other good things, the budget agreement:
.
Restores significant sequester cuts to the 148th Fighter
Wing in Duluth and to the National Guard, including Camp Ripley;
.
Reverses sequester cuts to Head Start, allowing more than
1,000 Minnesota kids to return to that vital pre-school development
program;
.
Includes money for important rural development, research,
and conservation programs for our farmers and farm-based industries, as
well as our lakes, rivers, and forests.
Make no mistake. This is not the bill I would have written. It still
contains more than $80 billion for foreign nation-building and military
spending abroad we should be investing to rebuild America. The pluses,
however, outweighed the minuses in getting this budget agreement done
for the American people.
Maria Shriver Reports:
Women and Children Would Benefit Most from Minimum Wage
Beyond America's long-term unemployment crisis lies the urgent need to
make women fully vested partners in our workforce. That challenge
topped my discussion last week with former Clinton Administration Labor
Secretary, Robert Reich, and Maria Shriver.
You might not be surprised to learn that two-thirds of America's
minimum-wage earners are women. And often, they also have primary
responsibility for child and household expenses; they're the
decision-makers of the home. The recently published "Shriver Report"
revealed the astonishing fact that one-third of American women - and 28
million children - are living at or near the brink of poverty. The
study also revealed that while the majority of American families rely
on the mother as a breadwinner, women are paid on average just 77 cents
for every dollar their male counterparts earn. We can help rectify this
injustice by raising the federal minimum wage to at least $10.50 an
hour - to have equivalent purchasing power that the minimum wage did in
1968 - legislation I have continually urged House Leadership to bring
to the Floor for a vote. We must also advance tax and other workplace
policies to encourage paid leave for maternity and expand early
childhood daycare. Women and working mothers deserve to be treated
fairly and compensated well, and I will continue to do everything in my
power to make that happen.
Chief Iran Nuclear Negotiator: Give New Agreement Time to Work
The recent U.S.-Iran nuclear non-proliferation agreement is tough and
well crafted, and further Congressional action to improve it is not
necessary. That is what America's chief Iran negotiator, Deputy
National Security Adviser to the President, Tony Blinken, reported last
week in a meeting with me and other select Members of Congress. Mr.
Blinken explained that the agreement compels Iran to immediately halt
pursuit of nuclear capabilities, and allows U.N. inspectors daily
unlimited access to mines, equipment manufacturing, and processing
sites. He added that further attempts by the Congress to toughen
sanctions could potentially undermine progress, divide the
international community, drive Iran to take an even harder line, and
damage ultimate prospects for a nuclear-free Iran. One thing is
certain. We cannot afford another costly, destructive American military
action in the Middle East. Congress needs to step back and give
diplomacy every chance to work.

This Week In Pictures:
With Christina Hausman, Executive Director of the Voyageurs National
Park Association: I was honored to support the original land grant for
Voyageurs National Park in 1971 as a Minnesota state legislator, and to
vote to establish Voyageurs National Park in 1975 as a Member of
Congress. So it was great to visit with Christina to discuss how we can
best protect and preserve Minnesota's only national park, located right
here in our 8th Congressional District.
Tallie Sertich - in D.C. to testify before a Senate roundtable for the
Health, Education, Labor & Pensions (HELP) Committee - briefed me on
the important work being done for Hibbing Community College's Upward
Bound program, which strives to help low-income students succeed
through federal programs like TRIO and Gear Up.
Eric Dahlberg of Duluth and Wyatt Soderquist of Cambridge, two students
studying Transportation and Logistics Management at the University of
Wisconsin-Superior, were in town attending the annual Transportation
Research Board Convention. I couldn't resist taking these two on my
signature tour of the U.S.Capitol, which naturally includes the iconic
shot in front of the Dome.
_____
Briefly...
Last week I...
.
Met with Jennifer Smith, originally from Brainerd and now
with the United Way of Crow Wing County, on Tuesday regarding the
importance of the tax deductibility for charitable contributions, as
well as important local needs related to the omnibus budget bill.
.
Joined Congresswomen Cheri Bustos (D-IL) and Kristi Noem
(R-SD) and two-dozen other lawmakers in expressing our concern over the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s proposal to reduce the
renewable volume obligations (RVOs) under the Renewable Fuel Standard
(RFS). This is the first time the EPA has proposed a reduction in the
amount of ethanol blended into our nation's gasoline supply, and could
have severe economic consequences for our agricultural industry. As I
noted above, biodiesel and ethanol fuels are cheaper - what's more,
they reduce our carbon footprint.
.
Signed a bipartisan letter to the Administration noting that
while Congress may be compelled to act with additional sanctions if the
U.S.-Iran nuclear agreement fails to produce results, we believe
firstly that diplomacy must be given a chance. With all the inspectors
having full daily access, we're confident we'll know if a violation of
the agreement takes place, and whether further sanctions will be
necessary.

Coming Up In Minnesota
Our "Make It In America" tour of 8th District entrepreneurs,
manufacturers, and businesses is off to a terrific start in 2014! Today
I visited the reconstruction site of Remer Cut-Stock Lumber, which
tragically burned to the ground last July, yet despite the frigid
temperatures, workers were still out laying blocks this morning. Also
this week Ill be checking out the top-of-the-line camping trailers
produced by Scamp Trailers in Backus, trying on a Duluth Pack at their
facility in Duluth, and traveling to Cloquet to see how Sappi uses
cellulose to produce paper products and textiles for distribution
around the world.
Meanwhile, Ill also be meeting with elected officials from Walker and
Cass County to discuss federal funding for a new HUD housing project in
Remer, sitting down with local Labor leaders, members of the Izaak
Walton League, and local elected officials in Duluth and Carlton County
later in the week. Ill also stop by the EPAs Duluth Headquarters, to
meet with administrators about projects in the area, including my
ongoing efforts to address regional haze throughout northern Minnesota.

Coming Up In Washington
Members of Congress are back in our districts this entire week, meeting
with folks and sharing news of what were working on in Washington and
learning from people of the 8th what they believe needs to be fixed.
When we return to DC a week from now, well most likely be hammering
out the final details of the stalled Farm Bill, including critical
reforms to dairy, conservation and other programs vital to rural
America. We've managed to secure a reauthorization of the PILT program,
crucial for all the local governments in Minnesota's 8th district, and
one of the reasons an updated Farm Bill is so important. I'll be sure
to keep you posted once I return.

Finally...Free to Be Funny
With Rep. Betty McCollum, Shez Cassim, Susan Burns in the Capitol.
Here's a young man who, just a month ago, was in an Abu Dhabi prison
for posting online a humorous, satirical video portraying life in the
United Arab Emirates. Now, thankfully, he's grinning alongside Rep.
Betty McCollum, his lawyer, Susan Burns, and me, in front of the statue
of one of America's great satirists, Will Rogers.
Shez Cassim, a graduate of the University of Minnesota, had been
confined since April. Fortunately, thanks to the diplomatic efforts of
Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Sen. Al Franken, Rep. Betty McCollum, and yours
truly, Shez was finally officially charged, sentenced, and freed -
happy to be home in the U.S. with his family. Its good to have you
back on American soil, Shez.

Report
from
Representative
Rick
Nolan
"Injustice
anywhere
is
a
threat
to
justice
everywhere." -
Dr.
Martin
Luther
King,
Jr.
Dear
Friend,
If
Martin
Luther
King,
Jr.
were
alive
today,
I'm
confident
he
would
be
standing
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
us
in
Washington,
fighting
the
legislative
battle
to
extend
emergency
unemployment
benefits
to
working
men
and
women
across
America
who've
lost
their
jobs
through
no
fault
of
their
own.
And
who
are
struggling
to
find
work
and
support
their
families.
So
we
dedicate
this
week's
Monday
Report
to
Dr.
King,
and
to
his
steadfast
commitment
to
the
proposition
that
every
American
deserves
a
job
to
sustain
them,
and
every
person
has
the
opportunity
to
live
up
to
their
full
potential
in
life.
Part
of
the
ongoing
fight
for
economic
justice
in
this
country
is
the
renewal
of
the
earned
unemployment
insurance
to
these
workers,
and
I
have
continually
called
for
a
vote
on
this
subject.
Take
a
moment
and
watch
what
I
told
my
colleagues
from
the
Floor
of
the
House
last
week:
Happy
MLK
Day
-
and
have
a
great
week.
Sincerely,
No
More
Secret,
Job-Killer
Trade
Agreements!
Congressman
Nolan
met
last
week
with
U.S.
Trade
Ambassador
Michael
Froman
to
discuss
ongoing
negotiations
over
the
Trans-Pacific
Partnership
(TPP).
We
can&#8217;t
afford
to
lose
one
more
good
American
job
to
one
more
global
trade
agreement
negotiated
in
secret.
That
was
my
message
to
U.S.
Trade
Ambassador
Michael
Froman
last
week
as
we
discussed
the
Trans-Pacific
Partnership
(TPP),
which
could
become
one
of
the
largest
and
most
significant
international
trade
agreements
in
history.
Over
four
long
years
and
19
sessions,
Congress
has
been
excluded
from
TPP
negotiations.
That
needs
to
change
long
before
we
are
required
to
take
a
vote
on
the
TPP.
Given
a
fair
chance
and
a
level
playing
field,
American
workers
and
American
manufacturers
can
compete
globally
and
win
every
time.
However,
they
can&#8217;t
do
it
with
one
hand
tied
behind
their
backs
by
secret
trade
agreements
rammed
through
Congress
under
Presidential
fast
track
authority ;
agreements
placing
them
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
with
counterparts
around
the
world
who
aren&#8217;t
required
to
adhere
to
our
strict
health,
safety,
and
environmental
standards.
The
simple
truth
is:
the
primary
beneficiaries
of
these
kind
of
trade
agreements
are
large,
multi-national
corporations ,
and
our
trade
negotiators
have
been
selling
American
manufacturers
and
workers
short.
It's
time
we
turn
that
around
and
create
a
level
playing
field.
Nolan
to
EPA:
Boost
Renewable
Fuels
in
Gasoline
Congressman
Nolan
pressed
U.S.
Environmental
Protection
Agency
Administrator
Gina
McCarthy
to
increase
the
agency's
proposed
2014
ethanol
and
biodiesel
fuels
requirements
for
gasoline.
Ethanol
and
biodiesel ,
so
important
to
America's
farm
and
rural
economy,
should
be
blended
into
gasoline
in
larger
-
not
smaller
-
amounts
in
2014.
Why?
Because
experts
in
the
field
say
that
blended
ethanol
and
biodiesel
fuels
are
better
for
the
environment
and
cheaper
for
everybody .
That's
what
fellow
Minnesotan
and
House
Agriculture
Committee
Ranking
Member
Collin
Peterson
and
I
and
others
told
U.S.
Environmental
Protection
Agency
Administrator
(EPA) Gina
McCarthy
last
week
in
Washington.
We
called
the
meeting
because
EPA
has
proposed
to
lower
the
amount
of
ethanol
and
biodiesel
blended
in
2014
substantially
below
Congress'
recommendation.
Administrator
McCarthy
was
very
receptive
to
our
concern
that
cutting
the
Renewable
Fuels
Standard
(RFS)
would
harm
our
farm
and
rural
economy,
and
discourage
investment
in
renewable
fuels
technology,
critical
to
reducing
both
our
nation's
carbon
footprint
and
dependence
on
foreign
oil.
We
will
keep
pressing
EPA
to
bring
their
proposed
2014
number
-
15.21
billion
gallons
-
up
to
Congress'
number
-
18.15
gallons
-
in
their
final
rule.
A
side
note:
After
several
productive
meetings
with
EPA
Region
5
Administrator
Dr.
Susan
Hedman
on
haze
issues
across
Voyageurs
National
Park
and
the
Boundary
Waters,
and
Highway
169
on
the
Range,
it
was
good
to
finally
meet
Administrator
McCarthy
and
find
her
so
knowledgeable
and
open-minded
on
issues
of
importance
to
the
8th
District
and
the
state
of
Minnesota.
Budget
Agreement's
Good
for
Minnesota
and
Our
8th
District
Beyond
the
welcome
fact
that
we
began
2014
with
a
bipartisan
agreement
to
fund
the
government
and
avert
another
costly
and
unnecessary
shutdown,
there
is
good
news
for
the
8th
District,
the
Great
Lakes,
and
the
state
of
Minnesota
in
the
omnibus
budget
bill
Congress
passed
last
week.
The
measure
includes
$3.5
million
specifically
designated
to
prevent
the
spread
of
invasive
and
destructive
Asian
Carp
into
the
Great
Lakes .
Those
funds
augment
my
amendments
in
the
Water
Resources
bill
to
(1)
close
the
St.
Anthony
Lock
and
Dam
to
stop
the
carp
from
threatening
our
northern
Minnesota
sport
fishing
and
tourist
industry;
and
(2)
provide
the
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
with
more
tools
to
fight
invasive
species
by
changing
the
official
definition
to
include
animals
as
well
as
plants.
In
addition,
we
secured
an
extra
$15
million
for
the
Great
Lakes
Restoration
Initiative
&#8211;
a
top
priority
of
mine
over
the
past
year.
Among
other
good
things,
the
budget
agreement:
&#8226;
Restores
significant
sequester
cuts
to
the
148th
Fighter
Wing
in
Duluth
and
to
the
National
Guard,
including
Camp
Ripley;
&#8226;
Reverses
sequester
cuts
to
Head
Start ,
allowing
more
than
1,000
Minnesota
kids
to
return
to
that
vital
pre-school
development
program;
&#8226;
Includes
money
for
important
rural
development,
research,
and
conservation
programs
for
our
farmers
and
farm-based
industries,
as
well
as
our
lakes,
rivers,
and
forests .
Make
no
mistake.
This
is
not
the
bill
I
would
have
written.
It
still
contains
more
than
$80
billion
for
foreign
nation-building
and
military
spending
abroad
we
should
be
investing
to
rebuild
America.
The
pluses,
however,
outweighed
the
minuses
in
getting
this
budget
agreement
done
for
the
American
people.
Maria
Shriver
Reports:
Women
and
Children
Would
Benefit
Most
from
Minimum
Wage
Beyond
America's
long-term
unemployment
crisis
lies
the
urgent
need
to
make
women
fully
vested
partners
in
our
workforce .
That
challenge
topped
my
discussion
last
week
with
former
Clinton
Administration
Labor
Secretary,
Robert
Reich ,
and
Maria
Shriver .
You
might
not
be
surprised
to
learn
that
two-thirds
of
America's
minimum-wage
earners
are
women.
And
often,
they
also
have
primary
responsibility
for
child
and
household
expenses;
they're
the
decision-makers
of
the
home. The recently
published
&#8220;Shriver
Report&#8221;
revealed
the
astonishing
fact
that
one-third
of
American
women
&#8211;
and
28
million
children
&#8211;
are
living
at
or
near
the
brink
of
poverty.
The
study
also revealed
that
while
the
majority
of
American
families
rely
on
the
mother
as
a
breadwinner,
women
are
paid
on
average
just
77
cents
for
every
dollar
their
male
counterparts
earn.
W e
can
help
rectify
this
injustice
by
raising
the
federal
minimum
wage
to
at
least
$10.50
an
hour
&#8211;
to
have
equivalent
purchasing
power
that
the
minimum
wage
did
in
1968 &#8211;
legislation
I
have
continually
urged
House
Leadership
to
bring
to
the
Floor
for
a
vote. We
must
also
advance
tax
and
other
workplace
policies
to
encourage
paid
leave
for
maternity
and
expand
early
childhood
daycare .
Women
and
working
mothers
deserve
to
be
treated
fairly
and
compensated
well,
and
I
will
continue
to
do
everything
in
my
power
to
make
that
happen.
Chief
Iran
Nuclear
Negotiator:
Give
New
Agreement
Time
to
Work
The
recent
U.S.-Iran
nuclear
non-proliferation
agreement
is
tough
and
well
crafted,
and
further
Congressional
action
to
improve
it
is
not
necessary .
That
is
what
America&#8217;s
chief
Iran
negotiator,
Deputy
National
Security
Adviser
to
the
President,
Tony
Blinken,
reported
last
week
in
a
meeting
with
me
and
other
select
Members
of
Congress.
Mr.
Blinken
explained
that
the
agreement
compels
Iran
to
immediately
halt
pursuit
of
nuclear
capabilities,
and
allows
U.N.
inspectors
daily
unlimited
access
to
mines,
equipment
manufacturing,
and
processing
sites.
He
added
that
further
attempts
by
the
Congress
to
toughen
sanctions
could
potentially
undermine
progress,
divide
the
international
community,
drive
Iran
to
take
an
even
harder
line,
and
damage
ultimate
prospects
for
a
nuclear-free
Iran.
One
thing
is
certain.
We
cannot
afford
another
costly,
destructive
American
military
action
in
the
Middle
East .
Congress
needs
to
step
back
and
give
diplomacy
every
chance
to
work.

Committee
&#8211;
briefed
me
on
the
important
work
being
done
for
Hibbing
Community
College&#8217;s
Upward
Bound
program,
which
strives
to
help
low-income
students
succeed
through
federal
programs
like
TRIO
and
Gear
Up.
Eric
Dahlberg
of
Duluth
and
Wyatt
Soderquist
of
Cambridge,
two
students
studying
Transportation
and
Logistics
Management
at
the
University
of
Wisconsin-Superior,
were
in
town
attending
the
annual
Transportation
Research
Board
Convention.
I
couldn&#8217;t
resist
taking
these
two
on
my
signature
tour
of
the
U.S.Capitol,
which
naturally
includes
the
iconic
shot
in
front
of
the
Dome.
Briefly...
Last
week
I...
&#8226;
Met
with
Jennifer
Smith ,
originally
from
Brainerd
and
now
with
the
United
Way
of
Crow
Wing
County ,
on
Tuesday
regarding the
importance
of
the
tax
deductibility
for
charitable
contributions,
as
well
as important
local
needs related
to
the
omnibus
budget
bill.
&#8226;
Joined
Congresswomen
Cheri
Bustos
(D-IL)
and
Kristi
Noem
(R-SD)
and
two-dozen
other
lawmakers
in
expressing
our
concern
over
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(EPA)&#8217;s
proposal
to
reduce
the
renewable
volume
obligations
(RVOs)
under
the
Renewable
Fuel
Standard
(RFS).
This
is
the
first
time
the
EPA
has
proposed
a
reduction
in
the
amount
of
ethanol
blended
into
our
nation&#8217;s
gasoline
supply,
and
could
have
severe
economic
consequences
for
our
agricultural
industry.
As
I
noted
above,
biodiesel
and
ethanol
fuels
are
cheaper
-
what's
more,
they
reduce
our
carbon
footprint .
&#8226;
Signed
a
bipartisan
letter
to
the
Administration
noting
that
while
Congress
may
be
compelled
to
act
with
additional
sanctions
if
the
U.S.-Iran
nuclear
agreement
fails
to
produce
results,
we
believe
firstly
that
diplomacy
must
be
given
a
chance .
With
all
the
inspectors
having
full
daily
access,
we're
confident
we'll
know
if
a
violation
of
the
agreement
takes
place,
and
whether
further
sanctions
will
be
necessary.
Coming
Up
In
Minnesota
Our
&#8220;Make
It
In
America&#8221;
tour
of
8th
District
entrepreneurs,
manufacturers,
and
businesses
is
off
to
a
terrific
start
in
2014!
Today
I
visited
the
reconstruction
site
of
Remer
Cut-Stock
Lumber ,
which
tragically burned
to
the
ground last
July,
yet
despite
the
frigid
temperatures,
workers
were
still
out
laying
blocks
this
morning.
Also
this
week
I&#180;ll
be
checking
out
the
top-of-the-line
camping
trailers
produced
by
Scamp
Trailers
in
Backus,
trying
on
a
Duluth
Pack
at
their
facility
in
Duluth,
and
traveling
to
Cloquet
to
see
how
Sappi
uses
cellulose
to
produce
paper
products
and
textiles
for
distribution
around
the
world.
Meanwhile,
I&#180;ll
also
be
meeting
with
elected
officials
from
Walker
and
Cass
County
to
discuss
federal
funding
for
a
new
HUD
housing
project
in
Remer,
sitting
down
with
local
Labor
leaders ,
members
of the
Izaak
Walton
League ,
and
local
elected
officials
in
Duluth
and
Carlton
County
later
in
the
week.
I&#180;ll
also
stop
by
the
EPA&#180;s
Duluth
Headquarters ,
to
meet
with
administrators
about
projects
in
the
area,
including
my
ongoing
efforts
to
address
regional
haze
throughout
northern
Minnesota.
Coming
Up
In
Washington
Members
of
Congress
are
back
in
our
districts
this
entire
week,
meeting
with
folks
and
sharing
news
of
what
we&#180;re
working
on
in
Washington
and
learning
from
people
of
the
8th
what
they
believe
needs
to
be
fixed.
When
we
return
to
DC
a
week
from
now,
we&#180;ll
most
likely
be
hammering
out
the
final
details
of
the
stalled
Farm
Bill ,
including
critical
reforms
to
dairy,
conservation
and
other
programs
vital
to
rural
America.
We've
managed
to
secure
a
reauthorization
of
the
PILT
program ,
crucial for
all
the
local
governments
in
Minnesota's
8th district,
and
one of
the
reasons an
updated Farm
Bill is
so
important. I&#8217;ll
be
sure
to
keep
you
posted
once
I
return.
Finally...Free
to
Be
Funny
With
Rep.
Betty
McCollum,
Shez
Cassim,
Susan
Burns
in
the
Capitol.
Here's
a
young
man
who,
just
a
month
ago,
was
in
an
Abu
Dhabi
prison
for
posting
online
a
humorous,
satirical
video
portraying
life
in
the
United
Arab
Emirates.
Now,
thankfully,
he's
grinning
alongside
Rep.
Betty
McCollum,
his
lawyer,
Susan
Burns,
and
me,
in
front
of
the
statue
of
one
of
America's
great
satirists,
Will
Rogers.
Shez
Cassim ,
a
graduate
of
the
University
of
Minnesota ,
had
been
confined
since
April.
Fortunately,
thanks
to
the
diplomatic
efforts
of
Sen.
Amy
Klobuchar,
Sen.
Al
Franken,
Rep.
Betty
McCollum,
and
yours
truly,
Shez
was
finally
officially
charged,
sentenced,
and
freed
&#8211;
happy
to
be
home
in
the
U.S.
with
his
family.
It&#180;s
good
to
have
you
back
on
American
soil,
Shez.
