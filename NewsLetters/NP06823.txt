Dear
Friend,
Everywhere I traveled this week in Central Florida, people expressed
their outrage at the barbaric murder of American journalist James
Foley.
In several speeches, I reminded my fellow citizens of the
dangerous world in which we live and how fortunate we are to wake up each day
in the United States, even with some of the domestic challenges we
face.
Those who commit terrorist acts on our country or our
citizens must be held accountable.
No federal responsibility is
more important than our national security.
While we all hope and
pray for a peaceful world, the United States must act in a responsible
and respected manner and hold those accountable who violate our
sovereignty and terrorize our citizens, our diplomats and our service men
and women.
Our thoughts and prayers are extended to the
Foley family and to the families of our service men and women who have
died in defense of our nation.
Most
respectfully,
John L. Mica
