Dear Friend:
To all of our moms out there, I hope you had a great Mother's Day
surrounded by the ones you love. Thank you for everything you do to
make our families stronger. In this week's newsletter you will find the
results from our recent survey
on the Benghazi investigation - as well as the latest news
and developments coming out of Florida's Second Congressional District.
Benghazi Survey Results
Earlier this week our constituent survey asked if you support the
creation of a House select committee to investigate the deadly attacks
on our U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. With over 4,000 responses,
62% of participants voiced their support for the special committee -
while 34% said no and 4% needed more information. While the
investigation over the attacks has generated lots of attention, it is
clear most Americans agree justice must be served to those responsible
for murdering our four fellow countrymen. I am hopeful the House select
committee will help provide answers for the families of the victims and
deliver justice to those who brought them harm.
Fighting for Florida Fishermen
The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council's recent decision to
shorten the red snapper season to only 9 days amounts to another slap
in the face for our hardworking fishermen and coastal communities. It
is clear the current management system is not working and is being
driven by a job-crushing agenda that is focused more on putting
fishermen out of business than helping foster economic growth. While I
am disappointed, it only reinforces my commitment to ensuring
much-needed changes are brought to how red snapper is managed in the
Gulf of Mexico.

on Jim Wilson's Fishing News Network. Part one can be found here:

Creating Opportunity Through Education
I recently had the opportunity to tour the construction site for the
North Bay Haven Charter Academy - a local example of how important
school choice is to the success of our children. Too many young people
continue to fall behind as a result of being stuck in a failing school
at no fault of their own.
That's why I was proud that a bipartisan majority of the House joined
me in passing legislation (H.R. 10) that expands school choice and
encourages innovation in education by modernizing our charter school
system.
This means new opportunities for Bay County students to access
a quality education tailored to their needs, rather than the mandates
set by Washington bureaucrats.
Congressional Art Competition
It was with great pleasure that I announced Destiny Moss of Marianna
High School as this year's Congressional Art Competition winner.
Destiny's stunning artwork, titled "Sylph Vision," will now be featured
in the U.S. Capitol for the next year.
Congratulations to Destiny and
all the talented students who participated in the competition. Also,
special thank you to Panama City's Paul Brent for serving as this year's
judge.
Speaking with Gulf County Students
I recently had the opportunity to spend the day visiting students at
Wewahitchka High School and Port St. Joe High School. I always
appreciate hearing from our young people and encouraging them to get
involved in the legislative process. As The Star newspaper pointed out
, our discussions focused on some of the
biggest issues facing our country.
Sincerely,
Steve Southerland, II

Dear

To

I
hope
you

a

surrounded

Benghazi
Survey
Results

our

on
our
U.S.

in

for
the
special
committee
&#8211;

the
investigation
over

it
is
clear
most
Americans
agree
