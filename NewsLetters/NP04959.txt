Nate Silver: A remarkable 10 states remain competitive
Friend -- Nate Silver reports, &ldquo;This year&rsquo;s Senate election is close. Republicans have the clearer path to a majority, but it&rsquo;s a treacherous one.&rdquo;
Silver reports our &ldquo;ground game&rdquo; could help us SURGE: &ldquo;Democrats are investing more into it this year, and that could help them.&rdquo;
With the election in five days -- ALARMINGLY soon -- the Senate is still ANYONE&rsquo;S to take.
We can secure victory with our Final Weekend Get Out The Vote Push!
But it&rsquo;s at risk of being cut: We&rsquo;re still $1,586,001 short with 24 hours left.
