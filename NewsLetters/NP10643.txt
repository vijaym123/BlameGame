Dear Friend,
This week, the full House approved a balanced budget for Fiscal Year
2015 that stops spending money we don't have, eliminates much of the
waste in government, maintains a strong national defense, encourages
job creation, and begins the important task of paying down our debt.
America's national debt stands at an astonishing $17 trillion. It is
wrong to take more money from hardworking American families to spend in
Washington. Our Path to Prosperity budget balances in 10 years without
raising taxes and cuts wasteful spending while reforming government. It
also promotes job creation by eliminating much of the overregulation
and red tape standing in the way of America's small businesses. And it
boosts businesses and job creation through an overhaul of the tax code
that increases wages, brings jobs home from abroad, and allows our
businesses to be more competitive.
This budget protects our nation by rejecting the Obama Administration's
cuts to national security and by providing our military as well as our
men and women in uniform with the equipment, training, and compensation
they deserve. We also keep faith with America's veterans who have
served and protected this country.
Congresswoman Hartzler's floor speech in support of the FY 2015 Path to
Prosperity Budget
This budget also strengthens America's safety net by giving more
control in this area to the states. The states would have more
flexibility to tailor programs to the needs of their citizens and would
have the power to cut a lot of the fraud, waste, and abuse that exists.
This budget puts our country on a sustainable path to growth. I
strongly urge the Senate to take up and pass this bold outline for
America's economic future.
On another matter, I worked with my colleagues on the House Agriculture
Committee to pass the Customer Protection and End-User Relief Act -
H.R. 4413 - and sent it to the full House for consideration. This
bipartisan bill reauthorizes and reforms the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (CFTC) by adding transparency to the current system and
expanding customer protections to prevent the type of fraud that lead
to the MF Global and Peregrine Financial failures and thousands of
farmers see their investments disappear.
There are several good components to this legislation. But first and
foremost I am pleased that our farmers, ranchers, small businesses, and
manufacturers to better manage their financial risks in a secure
environment.
I look forward to seeing this common sense legislation
advance in the full House.
Finally, I want to share an update with you on the deeply troubling
events in Ukraine and on Russia's expansionist actions. My House Armed
Services Committee (HASC) colleagues and I heard from senior Defense
Department officials this week who testified on the current
developments regarding the Russian military, Ukraine, and its
implications for U.S. force posture and NATO allies.
The witnesses testified that the U.S. military and NATO have supported
our response to the invasion through material assistance to the people
of Ukraine by delivering 300,000 MREs to Ukrainian troops.
Ten F-15's
along with over 100 Air Force personnel have been deployed to Lithuania
in support of NATO's Baltic Air Policing mission and a dozen F-16
fighter jets and nearly 300 service personnel have been sent to Poland.
European Union countries have pledged approximately $15 billion as part
of a package of support with the International Monetary Fund to help
out.
This, of course, is an unfolding crisis that HASC members are watching
very closely to be sure that it does not evolve into a broader Russian
campaign to move into Eastern Ukraine and challenge the West in Europe.
The plain truth is that Russia is modernizing and re-arming its
military,while violating the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF)
Treaty in the process. Unconfirmed reports cite 80,000 Russian troops
at Ukrainian's border and U.S. General Breedlove, Supreme Allied
Commander-Europe of Allied Command Operations and EUCOM commander, said
Russian forces possess "a potent mix of warplanes, helicopter units,
artillery, infantry, and commandos with field hospitals and sufficient
logistics to sustain an incursion into Ukraine."
I learned much during our briefing, coming out with a further resolve
to do all I can to stop proposed spending reductions to our military
and to restore the cuts that have already been made. With rogue nations
and terrorists threatening our country and Russia demonstrating a
blatant disregard for international boundaries, now is definitely NOT a
time to even consider stripping away vital funding for our national
defense. I remain committed to adequately funding our defense and
protecting our homeland.
Have a great week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler

Dear
Friend,
This
week,
the
full
House
approved
a
balanced
budget
for
Fiscal
Year
2015
that
stops
spending
money
we
don&#8217;t
have,
eliminates
much
of
the
waste
in
government,
maintains
a
strong
national
defense,
encourages
job
creation,
and
begins
the
important
task
of
paying
down
our
debt.
America&#8217;s
national
debt
stands
at
an
astonishing
$17
trillion.
It
is
wrong
to
take
more
money
from
hardworking
American
families
to
spend
in
Washington.
Our
Path
to
Prosperity
budget
balances
in
10
years
without
raising
taxes
and
cuts
wasteful
spending
while
reforming
government.
It
also
promotes
job
creation
by
eliminating
much
of
the
overregulation
and
red
tape
standing
in
the
way
of
America&#8217;s
small
businesses.
And
it
boosts
businesses
and
job
creation
through
an
overhaul
of
the
tax
code
that
increases
wages,
brings
jobs
home
from
abroad,
and
allows
our
businesses
to
be
more
competitive.
This
budget
protects
our
nation
by
rejecting
the
Obama
Administration&#8217;s
cuts
to
national
security
and
by
providing
our
military
as
well
as
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
with
the
equipment,
training,
and
compensation
they
deserve.
We
also
keep
faith
with
America&#8217;s
veterans
who
have
served
and
protected
this
country.
C ongresswoman
Hartzler&#8217;s
floor
speech
in
support
of
the
FY
2015
Path
to
Prosperity
Budget
This
budget
also
strengthens
America&#8217;s
safety
net
by
giving
more
control
in
this
area
to
the
states.
The
states
would
have
more
flexibility
to
tailor
programs
to
the
needs
of
their
citizens
and
would
have
the
power
to
cut
a
lot
of
the
fraud,
waste,
and
abuse
that
exists.
This
budget
puts
our
country
on
a
sustainable
path
to
growth.
I
strongly
urge
the
Senate
to
take
up
and
pass
this
bold
outline
for
America&#8217;s
economic
future.
On
another
matter,
I
worked
with
my
colleagues
on
the
House
Agriculture
Committee
to
pass
the
Customer
Protection
and
End-User
Relief
Act
&#8211;
H.R.
4413
&#8211;
and
sent
it
to
the
full
House
for
consideration.
This
bipartisan
bill
reauthorizes
and
reforms
the
Commodity
Futures
Trading
Commission
(CFTC)
by
adding
transparency
to
the
current
system
and
expanding
customer
protections
to
prevent
the
type
of
fraud
that
lead
to
the
MF
Global
and
Peregrine
Financial
failures
and
thousands
of
farmers
see
their
investments
disappear.
There
are
several
good
components
to
this
legislation.
But
first
and
foremost
I
am
pleased
that
our
farmers,
ranchers,
small
businesses,
and
manufacturers
to
better
manage
their
financial
risks
in
a
secure
environment.
I
look
forward
to
seeing
this
common
sense
legislation
advance
in
the
full
House.
Finally,
I
want
to
share
an
update
with
you
on
the
deeply
troubling
events
in
Ukraine
and
on
Russia&#8217;s
expansionist
actions.
My
House
Armed

(HASC)
colleagues
and
I
heard

senior
Defense

this

who
testified
on

and
its

a

that
it
does
not
