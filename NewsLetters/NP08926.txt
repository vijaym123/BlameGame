The Hill Report
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of June 2 - 6, 2014
This week, I enjoyed spending time in the 32nd Congressional District
visiting with constituents and businesses to discuss the current
direction of our country and the issues impacting North Texas.
Business Roundtable & Company Visit
On Tuesday, I participated in a business roundtable luncheon at H&S;
Manufacturing with representatives from some of Rowlett's top
employers. It was a great opportunity to learn more about the issues
facing North Texas businesses and to discuss my work in Congress to
reduce regulations, strengthen America's energy independence, and make
it easier for businesses to thrive and create jobs.

I also visited Ascend Custom Extrusions, which with approximately 150
employees
is the 7th largest employer in Wylie.
Ascend is a
manufacturer and designer of custom aluminum extrusions for industries
including building construction, transportation, consumer durables, and
electrical and machinery equipment. I enjoyed touring the facility and
getting the opportunity to discuss a variety of topics including
ObamaCare, energy independence, and EPA regulations.

Dallas Chapter of Military World Wars & TC Marsh Visit
This week, I also had the opportunity to speak to the Dallas Chapter of
Military World Wars, which is a national organization of American
Military Officers, Warrant Officers, Flight Officers and their
descendants of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard,
National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, and the United
States Public Health Service. It includes active, reserve component,
retired, or former service members. During the meeting, I spoke about
the importance of the military and honoring those who have served, as
well as the importance of instilling honorable values in our community's
youth.
On Wednesday, I visited TC Marsh Middle School's museum.
The museum
was established May 8, 2012, and features military uniforms and
memorabilia dating back to World War I from each of the five branches
of the United States military.
I appreciated getting a chance to see
the museum and receive an update on Marsh's Leadership Cadet Corps,
which has won the national championship among middle schools for three
of the past six years under the direction of Cpl. David Bates.

Foundation Fighting Blindness Event
On Tuesday, I served as an event co-chair for the Foundation Fighting
Blindness' 7th Annual Visionary Awards Dinner in Dallas.
As you may
know, the Foundation Fighting Blindness drives research that will
provide treatments and cures for people affected by retinitis
pigmentosa, macular degeneration, and the entire spectrum of retinal
degenerative diseases.
I support both private and public sector
investment in retinal disease research, and I look forward to
continuing to work with organizations such as Foundation Fighting
Blindness and with the National Institutes of Health to ensure that
researchers can work together to determine successful treatments that
could enhance the visual abilities of millions of Americans.
Congressman Sessions speaking at the FFB dinner
May Jobs Report
Today the Department of Labor released the monthly jobs report, which
stated that our nation's unemployment rate remained unchanged.
While
I'm pleased to learn that some Americans were able to find work last
month, there is much more that can be done to spur job creation and
economic growth.
Just last week, the Department of Commerce released
its revised GDP report showing that our economy shrank by one percent
in the first quarter of 2014 - marking the worst quarter in three
years.
The American people deserve the job creation that comes with a
growing economy but are instead stuck with the mediocre job growth that
comes with a sluggish economy.
On Monday, the Administration's EPA announced new proposed regulations
on power plants that could cost 224,000 jobs annually and impose
unnecessary compliance costs on American businesses.
Instead of proposing onerous regulations that kill jobs,
the Administration should encourage Senate Democrats to work with House
Republicans on the dozens of bills we've passed to help bolster our
economy.
Dynamic job growth and a thriving economy is not the result
of big government and more regulations. I will continue to fight to get
Washington out of the way in order to give the people of North Texas
the opportunities they deserve.
Have a good weekend.
Sincerely,
Pete Sessions
Member of Congress

May
Jobs
Report Today
the
Department
of
Labor
released
the
monthly
jobs
report,
which
stated
that
our
nation&#8217;s
unemployment
rate
remained
unchanged.
While
I&#8217;m
pleased
to
learn
that
some
Americans
were
able
to
find
work
last
month,
there
is
much
more
that
can
be
done
to
spur
job
creation
and
economic
growth.
Just
last
week,
the
Department
of
Commerce
released
its
revised
GDP
report
showing
that
our
economy
shrank
by
one
percent
in
the
first
quarter
of
2014
&#8211;
marking
the
worst
quarter
in
three
years.
The
American
people
deserve
the
job
creation
that
comes
with
a
growing
economy
but
are
instead
stuck
with
the
mediocre
job
growth
that
comes
with
a
sluggish
economy.
On
Monday,
the
Administration&#8217;s
EPA
announced
new
proposed
regulations
on
power
plants
that
could
cost
224,000
jobs
annually
and
impose
unnecessary
compliance
costs
on
American
businesses.
Instead
of
proposing
onerous
regulations
that
kill
jobs,
the
Administration
should
encourage
Senate
Democrats
to
work
with
House
Republicans
on
the
dozens
of
bills
we&#8217;ve
passed
to
help
bolster
our
economy.
Dynamic
job
growth
and
a
thriving
economy
is
not
the
result
of
big
government
and
more
regulations.
I
will
continue
to
fight
to
get
Washington
out
of
the
way
in
order
to
give
the
people
of
North
Texas
the
opportunities
they
deserve.
Have
a
good
weekend.
