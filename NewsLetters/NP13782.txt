Dear Friend:
Utah received an early Christmas present with
the announcement this week by the U. S. Air Force
that Hill Air Force Base will be the first
operational squadron of the F-35 stealth fighter
aircraft starting in 2015. The review
process for the delivery of the F-35 Joint Strike
Fighter was extensive, and the world class
facilities and wonderful personnel at Hill Air
Force and throughout our state make this the
right choice for our state and our country.
Ive been proud to stand with the Utah
congressional delegation and state leaders to
continue pushing for this opportunity for Utah
and our country, and I look forward to seeing the
F-35 at Hill soon.
This week also brought sad news with the death
of former South African President Nelson Mandela,
one of the worlds greatest leaders and
freedom fighters. From combatting the immoral
apartheid regime to his time presiding over the
countrys peaceful transition to democracy
as President of South Africa, Nelson
Mandelas dignity, courage and conviction
made him a lion among men. Who but Nelson Mandela
could have healed such a wounded and divided
nation through peaceful means
not violent
retribution - and bring South Africa into the
modern age where discrimination by race is not
tolerated. To his family and the people of South
Africa, the world mourns with you. The loss of
such a great man will be felt and borne by us
all.
Sincerely,
Orrin Hatch
