Department of Veterans Affairs
Our veterans deserve our care, our respect, and our support, and I know
that my colleagues and I in Congress are determined to hold those
persons accountable who have broken that trust between the American
people and our veterans. The terrible stories emanating from the
Phoenix VA hospital of secret waiting lists and the possibility that
this practice was being used in other VA hospitals around the country
is so disturbing that the VA Secretary resigned from his post last
week. While resignation is a serious consequence, it doesn't fix the
problem, which seems to be deeply-rooted in a culture of obfuscation.
*	Washington Post. Secretary Shinseki resigns from the VA
.
*	CNN. Shinseki resigns, but will that improve things at VA
hospitals?
*	MSNBC. Congress, VA face off at hearing.
The positive news that we can take from this terrible incident is that
the American people are now demanding answers and accountability.
The
House has already passed a bill making it easier to fire senior VA
officials who have engaged in wrong-doing
.
The Senate must now act and send the bill to the
President. The House and Senate Veterans Affairs Committees have
already held hearings and I am certain that there will be more in the
future to find the truth.
Congress has prioritized our veterans funding and increased the VA's
budget by 122 percent over the past ten years.
Earlier this year, the
House passed a bill to fund the VA at the levels the VA requested.
This shameful episode isn't about money; it is about management, and we
will get to the bottom of it.
I encourage you to visit the House Veterans Affairs Committee website
for the most updated information on what the House is doing
to find justice for our veterans.
Honoring America's Gulf War Veterans
One bill that you might not have seen considered in Washington this
week was H.R. 503.
Known as the "National Desert Storm and Desert
Shield War Memorial Act," it authorizes construction of a memorial in
Washington, D.C., to recognize those who have served our nation -
including many from Georgia - in Operation Desert Storm and Operation
Desert Shield.
We must never forget to honor those who have
voluntarily put themselves in harm's way to protect our nation's
hard-earned freedoms, and I was proud to join my colleagues in
unanimously passing this bill.
*	ABC News. House passes bill to establish a Gulf War Memorial.
This memorial will be constructed on federal lands using private
dollars.

GDP Falls
On Thursday, the
Commerce Department
reported
that Gross Domestic Product declined
in the First Quarter by an annualized rate of 1.0%.
Given this winter's cold weather and difficult job market, these
results are disappointing, though they are not entirely unexpected.
As
the following chart indicates, economic growth has been weak and
unpredictable coming out of the Great Recession.
In fact, this is one
of the worst post-recession "recoveries" in my lifetime.
To make
matters worse, even though we have seen some growth, we still have a
stubbornly high and unacceptable unemployment rate with low labor force
participation.
These results are unacceptable to me, and I know they
are unacceptable to you.
As you know, my colleagues and I in the House have passed numerous
bills to get the government out of the way of job creators and foster
economic growth.
Currently, there are more than 40 jobs bills that the
House has passed, but that remain unaddressed in the Senate.
Please
take a moment to review our jobs bill tracker here -
http://majorityleader.gov/JobsTracker/
.
There is a time and place to debate new regulations that will raise
costs and slow productivity-regulations like the ones that President
Obama just announced on carbon.
But America hasn't even fully
implemented all of the previous rounds of regulations.
Dodd-Frank to
reregulate financial services isn't complete, though it passed into law
in President Obama's first term.
Obamacare to reregulate healthcare
isn't complete, though it passed into law in President Obama's first
term.
We all want a safe and clean America, but we also all want a job
and economic opportunity for our families.
Can't we agree to stop
changing the rules and making it harder at least until American
families get back on their feet?
Until our economy is growing again-
not at one or two percent, the new anemic normal-but at four and five
percent, as we must have to recover, I will resist any and all efforts
to continue the march toward a regulation nation.
House Passes Third Appropriations Bill for FY15
The House passed the Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations
bill
in
the early morning hours of May 30th by a strong bipartisan vote of
321-87. While the House has nine more appropriations measures to vote
on to reach our goal of passing each individual bill before the end of
the Fiscal Year, the cooperative spirit shown during the CJS debate
fills me with hope that we will be able to tackle the tough issues that
face this country together.
When the President signed the Bipartisan Budget Act in December 2013,
funding levels were set to allow the House and Senate to fund the
government on time for the first time in a decade.
Passing three
appropriations bills in May puts the House well on its way to meeting
that goal, but unfortunately, the Senate has yet to take
up the House
bills or passing any others of its own.
While I never underestimate
the ability of the Senate to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, I
remain hopeful that we can put the days of "continuing resolutions"
behind us.
2014 Special Olympics Georgia Summer Games
On Friday I had the honor of participating in the opening ceremonies
for the 2014 Special Olympics Georgia Summer Games
.
This
year's games were held at Emory University and featured more than 2,200
athletes, coaches, and unified partners, participating in nine events
-- making it the largest games in Georgia history.
It was wonderful to
see the excitement on the faces of the many athletes who had worked all
year to prepare for the games; and the pride and joy of the parents,
families, coaches, volunteers, and friends of the participants was on
full display.
I want to congratulate all those who competed, and offer
my best wishes to the athletes who will be representing the State of
Georgia at the 2014 Special Olympics USA Games later this month in New
Jersey.
The Week Ahead
This week I am happy to be back in Georgia hosting our June Town Hall
Meeting
series beginning on Tuesday.
While I
available to you any time, if any of these times and locations are
convenient for you, I hope to see and visit with you then.

House
Passes
Third
Appropriations
Bill
for
FY15
The
House
passed
the
Commerce,

(CJS)
Appropriations
bill
in
the
early
morning
hours
of
May
30th
by
a
strong
bipartisan
vote
of
321-87. While
the
House
has
nine
more
appropriations
measures
to
vote
on
to
reach
our
goal
of
passing
each
individual
bill
before
the
end
of
the
Fiscal
Year,
the
cooperative
spirit
shown
during
the
CJS
debate
fills
me
with
hope
that
we
will
be
able
to
tackle
the
tough
issues
that
face
this
country
together.
When
the
President
signed
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act
in
December
2013,
funding
levels
were
set
to
allow
the
House
and
Senate
to
fund
the
government
on
time
for
the
first
time
in
a
decade.
Passing
three
appropriations
bills
in

puts
the
House
well
on
its

to
meeting
that
goal,
but
unfortunately,
the
Senate
