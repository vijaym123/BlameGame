CONSTITUENT SERVICES
VISITING DC
March 28, 2014
This past Sunday marked the four year anniversary of
Obamacare becoming law, a day marked by broken promises, numerous
delays, and special exemptions. Just this Tuesday,
the
President offered the 30 th
delay to his signature
legislative accomplishment .
Before and after Obamacare was
enacted, the President promised that "if you like your health care plan, you
can keep it.
This statement was repeated by the Presidents
allies in Congress, defended by his allies in the media, and for which
he was awarded Lie of the Year by Politifact in 2013.
Unfortunately, The Presidents health care law has left millions of Americans
with cancelled health plans
at least 4.7 million according to the
Associated Press.
President Obama also promised affordable
health care, claiming that Obamacare would bring down premiums for
families by $2,500.
Instead, Americans have watched their premiums
increase by an average of 41% in the individual market with reports of
more double digit increases on the way.
Senate Democrats
clearly see Obamacare as a problem for them, and have already begun
holding hearings about follow-on healthcare reforms.
Rather than
absorbing the lessons of the last four years, Senate Democrats appear eager
to double down on the Obamacare experiment by getting the government
even more involved in healthcare.
The American people have a
vested interest in the direction our nation's health care system is
headed, and reform legislation must be focused on empowering them and their
doctorsnot the government.

Monday, both Senate leaders signed on as co-sponsors to the ABLE Act,
giving new hope to the severely disabled and their families across America.
ABLE is a commonsense piece of legislation that would allow
parents of the severely disabled to use a 529 college savings account to
save for disability expenses
such as housing, education and
medical expenses.
New data from the CDC yesterday reaffirms why
we need to pass the ABLE Act.
The CDC study identified 1 in 68
children (1 in 42 boys and 1 in 189 girls) as having an autism spectrum
disorder, with North Carolina as one of the states with the highest
prevalence.
The prevalence of autism is substantially worse than
we ever thought.
Children and adults with autism face enormous
daily challenges, and it is important that we do what we can to support
these individuals and their families as they deal with the day-to-day
struggles presented by autism spectrum disorders.
This is why
Senator Casey and I introduced the ABLE Act, to help give these families
peace of mind in knowing that they can better save for their loved
ones.

Last evening the Senate passed a
piece of legislation I introduced called The Military and Veterans
Caregiver Resolution, which would designate the month of April as
Military and Veterans Caregiver Month.
When our brave men and women
go into combat, many come back with both visible and invisible wounds
from their service and require extensive care.
The primary
caregivers of these men and woman make tremendous personal sacrifices of
their own, saving the United States millions of dollars in health care.
This resolution is just one small gesture to honor those
caregivers and thank them for their time and sacrifice.
I also
introduced this week a resolution to designate April 5, 2014 as Gold
Star Wives Day.
This day provides an opportunity to honor the
members of Gold Star Wives of America.
Out of love and duty to
their country, members of Gold Star Wives have taken on responsibilities
that consume significant amounts of time and energy.
Members of
Gold Star Wives are both women and men who have lost someone extremely
important to them in service to our country, yet they still have
compassion to serve others.
Our nation owes these individuals and
families a huge debt of gratitude, and by designating April 5 as Gold
Star Wives Day, we can offer a small token of appreciation for their
patriotism, service, and sacrifice.

In case you missed it, Shawn Flynn interviewed me
on Capital Tonight, which aired on Monday. You can catch the full
segment

Finally, tomorrow is a day to
honor our Vietnam veterans.
While we cannot right the wrong
done to the men and women returning from Vietnam, tomorrow we have an
opportunity to recognize their service and thank them for entering harms
way.
While we remember the sacrifices these veterans made to
preserve our freedom, we also honor the ultimate sacrifice made by their
fallen comrades.
Thank you to all of those who served in
Vietnam, and belated welcome home.
Sincerely,
Richard Burr
