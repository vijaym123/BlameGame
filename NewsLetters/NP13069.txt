NEED HELP WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT?
Constituent services continue to be my first and foremost focus. From
helping our local veterans with access to VA healthcare to cutting
through the bureaucratic red-tape at the Social Security
Administration, my staff and I are ready to assist people who have
problems with the federal government. Please refer to the "Serving You"
section of my website for services my office can
provide. (Reminder: All casework and personal information is protected
under federal privacy laws.)
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
After heavy pressure from myself and my colleagues
, the Obama Administration has
backtracked on their efforts to reclassify volunteer firefighters as
employees under Obamacare for the communities they serve. This
announcement will now prevent what was a disaster-in-the-making for
dozens of South Jersey communities who rely on volunteer first
responders. Check out the story here
and join the discussion
on
Facebook.
LATEST NEWS
Despite stiff competition from other states, New Jersey was selected as
one of six test sites for commercial unmanned aerial systems (UAS) for
the safe integration into our domestic airspace. In partnership with
Virginia and with the FAA Technical Center in Egg Harbor Township
playing a critical lead role, our state will be at the forefront of new
economic opportunities in this growing aviation field. As Chairman of
the House Aviation Subcommittee, I led New Jersey's Congressional
efforts with the full support of Governor Christie to ensure our
strongest application was put forward to the FAA for a test site
designation. Read about it here.
SOUTH JERSEY "HOT PIC"
I was pleased to introduce New Jersey Senator Cory Booker to the
leadership and recruits at the U.S. Coast Guard Training Center in Cape
May earlier this month. We were joined by Captain Todd Prestidge, Cape
May County Freeholder Director Gerry Thornton and Cape May Mayor Edward
Mahaney.
