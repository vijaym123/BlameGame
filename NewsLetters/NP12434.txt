Dear friend,
I
hope you and your family are keeping safe and warm through these cold
winter months. But even as we weather through the cold, Im proud to say
there was no shortage of MooreMart volunteers who took time out of
their afternoon today to come to the National Guard Armory in Nashua to
put together more than 600 care packages for our troops serving
overseas. I always enjoy spending time with MooreMart volunteers, and today
was no exception.
Year after year, Granite Staters join
MooreMart in this wonderful tradition that honors the work and sacrifices
of our men and women in uniform, sending more than 61,000 packages to
members of the U.S. military serving overseas since 2004. The time
and unwavering support of volunteers in this effort underscores how we
in New Hampshire will always salute the work of our armed
services.
Whether it's sending care packages to our troops
overseas or fighting for military families here at home, we have a
responsibility to honor the service of our military men and women who have put
their lives on the line to protect our country. And along those lines,
I was glad to have been a leader in the effort to bring Congress
together to
restore the cost of living adjustments (COLA)
for military retirees.
This was the right thing to do, and
I'm encouraged by the bipartisan work that went into undoing these cuts
to protect future COLA for military retirees in a way that does not
add to the deficit.
I hope to see the same bipartisan
commitment as we move forward in addressing issues facing our armed
services, our veterans, and our country as a
whole.
Sincerely,
Jeanne
Shaheen
