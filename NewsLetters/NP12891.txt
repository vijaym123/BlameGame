Friends,
Tuesday night President Obama will deliver the State of the Union
Address before Congress. The President will reportedly use the speech
to announce a "Year of Action." There's no question action is needed in
this country, but it matters what kind of action and what direction it
takes us.
For instance, we need action on jobs. More than 20 House-passed jobs
bills
currently languish in the Senate - bills that would surely
pass if the President would remove his objections. These include:
- The REINS Act, which would stop runaway regulation by requiring
Congressional approval of those that could drastically affect jobs;
- The Northern Route Approval Act, which would allow for the
construction of the Keystone Pipeline;
- The SKILLS Act, which would provide much needed job training to the
long term unemployed; and,
- Numerous House bills which would give the same breaks from ObamaCare
to hardworking Americans that President Obama has already given to big
business and labor unions.
Unfortunately, all indications point to more of the same from President
Obama. More "pie in the sky" rhetoric based in ideology rather than
reality. More about politics, less about the people.
And he is promising more, not less, overreaching executive actions. Our
Constitutional constraints on government may not be convenient for
President Obama's political agenda, but they are necessary for
preserving our basic system of checks and balances.
And the last time I checked, the government still derives its authority
from the people, not the other way around.
Meet Cathy
After President Obama delivers his "State of the Union" address, the
GOP response this year will come from my friend and colleague, Rep.
Cathy McMorris Rodgers.
As the Chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, Cathy is an
inspiring leader. She's also very much a real, normal person. Like me,
she balances duties in Congress with being a wife and mom. Actually,
when Riley and I were considering whether I should run for Congress and
weighing the decision's impact on our family, it was Cathy who
convinced me by saying, "you can do this!"
Cathy is also the mother of a special needs child, and I know that
parents of special needs children in particular can identify with Cathy
as well. Americans need to see that "realness" in leaders, maybe now
more than ever.
I'm grateful for Cathy's friendship, thankful for her leadership in the
House, and eager to listen to her articulate a conservative message to
Americans in response to President Obama.
Traveling the District
Last week marked the first "District Work Week" of 2014, and I made a
number of important stops throughout the district.
Pike County
I spent most of the day Tuesday in Pike County, starting with a visit
to Pike County High School where I spoke to students in the banking and
finance academy. Next, I was off to the Walmart distribution facility
in Brundidge which is one of the top employers in Pike County. I
enjoyed touring the facility and hearing from some of the employees. We
ended in the day in the town of Banks for a meeting with Mayor Lisa
Cullpepper and the town council. We also made a stop at the local
Buy-Rite, a Banks institution. I appreciate all of those who came out
to say hello and share their views and concerns.
Montgomery
On Wednesday, I attended a lunch meeting in Montgomery with members of
the Alabama Association of Nurse Anesthetists. I learned about issues
important to their industry and shared a brief update on healthcare
matters in Washington. From there, I headed to the Central Alabama
Veterans Health Care System in Montgomery to meet with Director James
Talton about the issue last month with the Christmas gifts. As you may
remember, a young lady from Wetumpka tried to bring Christmas cards and
goodies to veteran patients at the facility only to be denied because
the cards contained the word "Christmas." My meeting with Mr. Talton
was very productive. Even though he wasn't present when the incident
occurred, Mr. Talton took full responsibility for what happened and
said efforts would be made to clear up confusion in the future. More
leaders could learn from Mr. Talton's "buck stops here" style. I
appreciate his time on what was a very busy day at the VA.
Eufaula
On Thursday, I headed to the "Bass Fishing Capitol of the World" -
Eufaula.
First up was a stop by Lakeside School to meet with Mrs.
Munn's first grade class and also upper school students.
Lunch with
the Eufaula Rotary Club presented a great opportunity to listen to
ideas and concerns from those in attendance. Next, we visited the
state-of-the-art Humminbird manufacturing facility. All the fishermen
out there know Humminbird for their fishfinders, depth sounders, marine
radios, and GPS systems. Humminbird is a great example of a homegrown
Alabama business, and I was pleased to get to know those involved in
their operation. We wrapped up the day at the Barbour Medical Center
for a meeting with hospital administrators from across the Second
District. I heard a lot about ObamaCare and the impact it is having on
the health care industry.
I appreciate all of those who took time to host me at their business
and those who just came out to say hello. More than anything, I
appreciate the opportunity to listen to those I represent and better
understand their views on the issues. These weeks of travel help me
better represent you in Washington.
As always, please feel free to contact me
to share your opinion on legislation up for debate in
Washington or any issue important to you. My staff and I are here to
help.

Friends,
Tuesday
night
President
Obama
will
deliver
the
State
of
the
Union
Address
before
Congress.
The
President
will
reportedly
use
the

to
announce
a
&#8220;Year
of
Action.&#8221;
There&#8217;s
no
question
action
is

in
this
country,
but
it
matters
what
kind
of
action
and
what
direction
it
takes
us.
For
instance,
we
need
action
on
jobs.
More
than
20
House-passed
jobs
bills
currently
languish
in
the
Senate
&#8211;
bills
that
would
surely

-
The
REINS

which

by

of
those
that
could
drastically
affect

-
The

-

and,
-
Numerous

Unfortunately,
all

to
more
of
the

from
President

More
&#8220;pie

the

rhetoric
based
in

More
about
politics,
less
about
the
people.
And
he

Our

for
President

political
agenda,
but
they
are
necessary
for

And
the
last
time
I

the
government
still
derives
its

from
the
people,
not
the
other
way
around.
Meet
Cathy
After President
Obama
delivers
his
"State
of
the
Union"
address,
the
GOP
response
this
year
will
come
from
my
friend
and
colleague,
Rep.
Cathy
McMorris
Rodgers.
As
the
Chairwoman
of
the
House
Republican
Conference,
Cathy
is
an
inspiring
leader.
She's
also
very
much
a
real,
normal
person.
Like
me,
she
balances
duties
in
Congress
with
being
a
wife
and
mom.
Actually,
when
Riley
and
I
were
considering
whether
I
should
run
for
Congress
and
weighing
the
decision's
impact
on
our
family,
it
was
Cathy
who
convinced
me
by
saying,
"you
can
do
this!"
Cathy
is
also
the
mother
of
a
special
needs
child,
and
I
know
that
parents
of
special
needs
children
in
particular
can
identify
with
Cathy
as
well.
Americans
need
to
see
that
"realness"
in
leaders,
maybe
now
more
than
ever.
I'm
grateful
for
Cathy's
friendship,
thankful
for
her
leadership
in
the
House,
and
eager
to
listen
to
her
articulate
a
conservative
message
to
Americans
in
response
to
President
Obama.
Traveling
the
District
Last
week
marked
the
first
&#8220;District
Work
Week&#8221;
of
2014,
and
I
made
a
number
of
important
stops
throughout
the
district.
Pike
County
I
spent
most
of
the
day
Tuesday
in
Pike
County,
starting
with
a
visit
to
Pike
County
High
School
where
I
spoke
to
students
in
the
banking
and
finance
academy.
Next,
I
was
off
to
the
Walmart
distribution
facility
in
Brundidge
which
is
one
of
the
top
employers
in
Pike
County.
I
enjoyed
touring
the
facility
and
hearing
from
some
of
the
employees.
We
ended
in
the
day
in
the
town
of
Banks
for
a
meeting
with
Mayor
Lisa
Cullpepper
and
the
town
council.
We
also
made
a
stop
at
the
local

a

institution.
I
appreciate
all
of
those
who
came
out
to
say
hello
and
share
their

and
concerns.
Montgomery
On
Wednesday,
I
attended
a
lunch
meeting
in
Montgomery
with
members
of
the
Alabama
Association
of
Nurse
Anesthetists.
I
learned
about
issues
important
to
their
industry
and
shared
a
brief
update
on
healthcare
matters
in
Washington.
From
there,
I
headed
to
the
Central
Alabama
Veterans
Health
Care
System
in
Montgomery
to
meet
with
Director
James
Talton
about
the
issue
last
month
with
the
Christmas
gifts.
As
you
may
remember,
a
young
lady
from
Wetumpka
tried
to
bring
Christmas
cards
and
goodies
to
veteran
patients
at
the
facility
only
to
be
denied
because
the
cards
contained
the
word
&#8220;Christmas.&#8221;
My
meeting
with
Mr.
Talton
was
very
productive.
Even
though
he
wasn&#8217;t
present
when
the
incident
occurred,
Mr.
Talton
took
full
responsibility
for
what
happened
and
said
efforts
would
be
made
to
clear
up
confusion
in
the
future.
More
leaders
could
learn
from
Mr.
Talton's
"buck
stops
here"
style.
I
appreciate
his
time
on
what
was
a
very
busy
day
at
the
VA.
Eufaula
On
Thursday,
I
headed
to
the
&#8220;Bass
Fishing
Capitol
of
the
World&#8221;
&#8211;
Eufaula.
First
up
was
a
stop
by
Lakeside
School
to
meet
with
Mrs.
Munn&#8217;s
first
grade
class
and
also
upper
school
students.
Lunch
with
the
Eufaula
Rotary
Club
presented
a
great
opportunity
to
listen
to
ideas
and
concerns
from
those
in
attendance.
Next,
we
visited
the
state-of-the-art
Humminbird
manufacturing
facility.
All
the
fishermen
out
there
know
Humminbird
for
their
fishfinders,
depth
sounders,
marine
radios,
and
GPS
systems.
Humminbird
is
a
great
example
of
a
homegrown
Alabama
business,
and
I
was
pleased
to
get
to
know
those
involved
in
their
operation.
We
wrapped
up
the
day
at
the
Barbour
Medical
Center
for
a
meeting
with
hospital
administrators
from
across
the
Second
District.
I
heard
a
lot
about
ObamaCare
and
the
impact
it
is
having
on
the
health
care
industry.
I
appreciate
all
of
those
who
took
time
to
host
me
at
their
business
and
those
who
just
came
out
to
say
hello.
More
than
anything,
I
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
listen
to
those
I
represent
and
better
understand
their
views
on
the
issues.
These
weeks
of
travel
help
me
better
represent
you
in
Washington.
As
always,
please
feel
free
to
contact
me
to
share
your
opinion
on
legislation
up
for
debate
in
Washington
or
any
issue
important
to
you.
My
staff
and
I
are
here
to
help.
