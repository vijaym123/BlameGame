THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT OUR SENIORS
It's no secret that West Virginians live in one of the most naturally
beautiful states in our nation.
We pride ourselves on a special quality
of life that visitors from across the globe travel to enjoy.
Whether
hunting, embracing our rich history and blend of cultures or simply
enjoying our gorgeous rolling hills, we love our state, and we want to
enjoy it with our children, grandchildren and even our great
grandchildren.
It is so important to continue to better our state, especially for those
who made it better for us - our seniors.
Indeed, we always need to think about our "most experienced" citizens.
Our seniors should be able to live comfortably in our great state, be
independent and have access to the services they need and deserve.
As your former Governor, my Administration dedicated more than $386
million to West Virginia's seniors - more than any previous
Administration. In fact, one of my proudest accomplishments was to place
trucks in all 55 counties to deliver hot and cold meals. In the first
year, they delivered 2.6 million meals.
Now as your United States Senator, I proudly serve as a member of the
Special Committee on Aging, and senior services remain a top priority
for me. I have asked my state staff to partner with the Social Security
Administration and the West Virginia Bureau of Senior Services to host
four informational sessions across the state, titled "Keeping Our
Promises to West Virginia's Seniors."
These agency outreach events will take place at the following locations:
Date: Tuesday, March 25, 2014
Time: 10:30 a.m.
Location: Raleigh County Commission on Aging, 1614 S. Kanawha St.,
Beckley.
Date: Tuesday, March 25, 2014
Time: 10:30 a.m.
Location: Anna Mae Reedy Senior Center, 103 West 5th Ave., Ranson.
Date: Wednesday, March 26, 2014
Time: 10:30 a.m.
Location: Marshall County Senior Center, 805 5th St., Moundsville.
Date: Wednesday, March 26, 2014
Time: 10:30 a.m.
Location: Lewis County Senior Citizens Center, 171 W. 2nd St., Weston.
These events are open to the public, and I invite you to come and speak
directly with members of my staff and representatives from the Social
Security Administration and the West Virginia Bureau of Senior Services.
This is a great opportunity for you, your family, community leaders and
caregivers to ask about important services and programs that foster
independence, sustain health and wellness and provide aid in times of
need.
Since our population is getting older in West Virginia, we should better
educate ourselves about the services that are out there. Please join my
staff for one of these important sessions. By working together, we can
keep our promises to our seniors.
