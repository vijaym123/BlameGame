Obamacare Oversight
Dear Friends,
Unlike private businesses that are required to inform their customers in the event of stolen information, the Department of Health and Human Services does not have to tell anyone.
Americans personal information is at risk online and people will not be told if their information is stolen.
The bill we passed in the House, H.R. 3811The Health Exchange Security and Transparency Act, requires HHS to inform enrollees whose personal information has been compromised or stolen when the exchange websites are hacked or improperly accessed by government employees.
As we continue to fight for the American people, please
contact me
or tell us how Obamacare has affected you at

Sincerely,
Join the conversation! Stay connected to me through

I look forward to hearing from you soon!
