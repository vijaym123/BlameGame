Dear David,
As we approach
Thanksgiving, I hope we can all find the time to join our friends,
families, and loved ones to give thanks for all of the blessings that
have been given to ourselves and our
country.
In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln delivered a proclamation
declaring the last Thursday of November as a day of Thanksgiving and Praise
to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens. He called upon
God to heal the wounds of the nation during its most trying time.
Today, it is just as appropriate to come together, amidst the difficult
times we face, and express our gratitude for the blessings that have
been bestowed upon us.
We should all be
thankful to our Founding Fathers for preserving in our constitution the
God-given right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We must
also thank our veterans and those men and women overseas who
selflessly serve to protect and defend these rights. Their sacrifice is
greater as they are still away from their home and family during this
Thanksgiving and many other holidays and family events. Our country is
fortunate to have such bravery and
commitment.
I wish you and your family a joyful Thanksgiving. May God bless
you and may he continue to watch over our great
country.
Sincerely,
