Latest on Obamacare
Deception of Americans is never acceptable:
Recently the Salt Lake Tribune
editorial board argued that while the President "should have been"
aware that his campaign promises were untrue, it is "sometimes better
to ask for forgiveness than permission." Here's why I think the Tribune
is wrong.
As I explained
to Fox News host Martha MacCallum, the
President seems to be making this stuff up as he goes. This was a
terribly conceived law. Millions of people are losing their insurance
plans, and they have a website that doesn't work. This is unacceptable.

my response to the President's press
conference on Obamacare.
What went wrong with healthcare.gov?
The introduction of Obamacare has been a complete disaster. As Nancy
Pelosi said, we are still finding out what's in the bill. As part of
this process, the House Oversight Committee conducted a hearing
examining the rollout of Healthcare.gov. I took an opportunity to ask
for more details
regarding hired website hackers.
States Attorneys General Share Obamacare Concern
Attorneys General from various states, including Utah, sent a letter to
HHS Secretary Sebelius expressing grave concern regarding state
healthcare exchanges. Take a look at the letter here
.
Working to make a more secure border
A recent report released by the federal Office of Special Counsel (OSC)
found that the overtime component within the Border Patrol pay system -
Administraviely Uncontrollable Overtime (AUO) - is being abused. To
better understand abuses within the system, I conducted a hearing where
I pressed DHS
officials to explain the current system.
They couldn't even answer a few basic questions.
Read more about the hearing here
.
I offered a long-term solution that would save taxpayers more than $1
billion over 10 years by introducing bipartisan legislation
that would reform the system. Recently the Washington Post
explained how this bill would help the system.
Striking a Better Balance between Jobs and Recreation
The Bureau of Land Management announced that it will defer an
additional 99,960 acres of land in Eastern Utah from its quarterly oil
and gas lease sale. Nearly three times as much land in Emery County is
protected from development for every acre that is leased for oil and
gas. We need to strike a better balance.
Members of the Utah delegation have been working on the Utah Public
Lands Initiative. View a status report here

Secret Service Scandal
Eighteen months ago the DHS Office of Inpector General (OIG) promised
Congress it would conduct an independent review of the culture of the
United States Secret Service. Recently we learned
that one of the supervisors involved in
investigating the sexual misconduct in Cartagena, Colombia last year
has himself been disciplined for sexual misconduct.
This type of misconduct threatens the security of the President of the
United States. We expect more from these agents.
