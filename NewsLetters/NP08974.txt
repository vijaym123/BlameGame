ISSUES
June 8, 2014
Dear Friend,
Since coming to Congress a year and a half ago, I have continuously
advocated for the people of San Antonio.
My job is to be your voice
and I take great pride in that responsibility. I've worked to ensure
students can access and afford a high-quality education, our
servicemembers and veterans are receiving the care and benefits they
have earned, and folks have access to first-rate, affordable
healthcare.
This week, I delivered my second State of the District speech.
This
was an opportunity for me to reflect on my time in Congress and provide
San Antonians with an update on what I have been doing for them both in
the district and up in Washington, DC.
As I mentioned during my speech, the first priority in my office is
making sure that I am properly serving the people that I represent.
My
office has worked tirelessly for the folks of the 20thDistrict of Texas
by:
*
Assisting constituents with over 1000 cases with federal
agencies;
*
Recovering over $1.6 million owed to folks from federal
agencies; and
*
Responding to over 20,000 letters on important topics ranging
from immigration reform to foreign policy
Today and in the future, I will continue to work to ensure all San
Antonians have opportunities to get ahead and reach their American
dreams.
Meeting with VA Secretary
On Friday, I met with Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) Sloan
D. Gibson in San Antonio to discuss the ongoing investigations at VA
hospitals of officials tampering with medical appointment data. These
allegations, that VA hospitals' officials tampered with waitlists in
order to hide long wait times at VA treatment facilities, are deeply
troubling and I want to ensure that folks are held accountable and-most
importantly-that our veterans receive the care they deserve moving
forward. I welcomed the opportunity to meet with him and discuss the
allegations of mismanagement at VA medical centers, as well as discuss
how to hold folks accountable and reform the system so that these
issues do not hamper access to first rate care for our veterans.
First and foremost, my job in Congress is to serve the people that I
represent.
From looking into issues folks may have with federal
agencies to visiting with and learning from people in San Antonio to
ensuring hard-working Americans are aware of opportunities available to
them, I am here to help however I can.
My door is always open, both in
San Antonio and in Washington.
Sincerely,
Member of Congress

COMMENT:
Avoid
tables
that
are
more
than
a
single
"page"

inches

because
they

COMMENT:
You
can,
however,
stack
shorter

Dear
Friend,
Since
coming
to
Congress
a
year
and
a
half
ago,
I
have
continuously
advocated
for
the
people
of
San
Antonio.
My
job
is
to
be
your
voice
and
I
take
great
pride
in
that
responsibility.
I&#8217;ve
worked
to
ensure
students
can
access
and
afford
a
high-quality
education,
our
servicemembers
and
veterans
are
receiving
the
care
and
benefits
they
have
earned,
and
folks
have
access
to
first-rate,
affordable
healthcare.
This
week,
I
delivered
my
second
State
of
the
District
speech.
This
was
an
opportunity
for
me
to
reflect
on
my
time
in
Congress
and
provide
San
Antonians
with
an
update
on
what
I
have
been
doing
for
them
both
in
the
district
and
up
in
Washington,
DC.
As
I
mentioned
during
my
speech,
the
first
priority
in
my
office
is
making
sure
that
I
am
properly
serving
the
people
that
I
represent.
My
office
has
worked
tirelessly
for
the
folks
of
the
20 th District
of
Texas
by:
Assisting
constituents
with
over
1000
cases
with
federal
agencies; Recovering
over
$1.6
million
owed
to
folks
from
federal
agencies;
and Responding
to
over
20,000
letters
on
important
topics
ranging
from
immigration
reform
to
foreign
policy
Today
and
in
the
future,
I
will
continue
to
work
to
ensure
all
San
Antonians have
opportunities
to
get
ahead
and
reach
their
American
dreams.
Meeting
with
VA
Secretary
On
Friday,
I
met
with
Acting
Secretary
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
Sloan
D.
Gibson
in
San
Antonio
to
discuss
the
ongoing
investigations
at
VA hospitals
of
officials
tampering
with
medical
appointment
data. These
allegations,
that
VA
hospitals&#8217;
officials
tampered
with
waitlists
in
order
to
hide
long
wait
times
at
VA
treatment
facilities,
are
deeply
troubling and
I
want
to
ensure
that
folks
are
held
accountable
and&#8212;most
importantly&#8212;that
our
veterans
receive
the
care
they
deserve
moving
forward. I
welcomed
the
opportunity
to
meet
with
him
and
discuss
the
allegations
of
mismanagement
at
VA
medical
centers,
as
well
as
discuss
how
to
hold
folks
accountable
and
reform
the
system
so
that
these
issues
do
not
hamper
access
to
first
rate
care
for
our
veterans.
First
and
foremost,
my
job
in
Congress
is
to
serve
the
people
that
I
represent.
From
looking
into
issues
folks
may
have
with
federal
agencies
to
visiting
with
and
learning
from
people
in
San
Antonio
to
ensuring
hard-working
Americans
are
aware
of
opportunities
available
to
them,
I
am
here
to
help
however
I
can.
My
door
is
always
open,
both
in
San
Antonio
and
in
Washington.
Sincerely,
Member
of
Congress
