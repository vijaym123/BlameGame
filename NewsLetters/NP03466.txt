Contact Rep. Fattah
Dear Friend,
Last week, I was sworn in
to my 11 th
term in the House of Representatives. It
remains a great privilege to serve my country and my hometown of
Philadelphia in the United States Congress.
As I enter the
114 th
Congress and my 21 st
year in office, I look forward
to new opportunities to produce and pass legislation that will grow
Americas middle class, graduate more young people from high school and
college, and increase our countrys competitive edge.
Coming
off one of my most effective years ever, I also plan to continue
building on the success of my five legislative priorities: manufacturing,
brain research, youth mentoring, cooperatives, and GEAR UP, the
college access program I created more than 15 years ago.
As we
look ahead, it is also an important time to reflect on my successes of
the past Congress. Together, and with the support and efforts of many,
we accomplished a great deal:
Expanded the Fattah Neuroscience Initiative ,
a non-incremental policy initiative designed to
make progress in understanding the human brain
and
find cures and treatments for brain disease and disorder by elevating
brain research as a top federal
priority
Secured funding for GEAR UP, which includes
$29.1 million for the School District of
Philadelphia
and $22.1 million for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; and
$301.6 million overall
in the 2015
federal spending bill
Helped secure
passage of the Workforce Innovation &amp;
Opportunity Act (WIOA) , which included key components of my Urban
Jobs Act bill
Passed legislation to
name the Philadelphia Veterans Medical Center
after Medal of Honor recipient
Corporal Michael J.
Crescenz, and
legislation to rename
Philadelphias 30 th
Street Station
in honor of the
late Congressman William H. Gray
III
Increased funding for national youth
mentoring
programs to $90 million in the 2015 federal spending
bill
Introduced
Americas FOCUS Act ,
bipartisan legislation that would grow
the United States global competitiveness through increased investments
in our youth, our health, and our communities, and the bipartisan
REDEEM Act
to reform the
countrys criminal justice system; I will re-introduce both bills in the
114 th
Congress
Unveiled two
significant urban redevelopment projects in Philadelphia: the
Schuylkill Banks Boardwalk , completed
with millions of dollars in federal grants I helped to secure since
the paths inception in 2006, and the
Dilworth
Plaza renovation at City Hall
with $15 million in
federal funding from the Department of
Transportation
Joined in the
groundbreaking of the
Queen Lane Apartments, a new affordable
housing
development made possible by my idea in 1990 to find alternatives to
high-rise public housing
Supported the
Presidents call for a
permanent extension of
the American Opportunity Tax Credit , a piece of legislation
I created that has benefited at least 9.4 million families each year
since 2011
Secured more than $260 million
in grant funding to support public and nonprofit organizations in
Pennsylvanias 2nd Congressional District, including millions for
SEPTA resiliency and disaster relief
projects ,
Community Development Block
Grants , TIGER grant funding to create a
sustainable transit strategy for Roosevelt Boulevard ,
and other
transportation, housing, and infrastructure
projects
Traveled to
Israel
and
Ireland
to speak and participate in international neuroscience
conferences while promoting global brain research collaboration on behalf
of the United States
Announced the
launch of the Charles Colson Task Force on Federal
Corrections , a nine-member panel that will evaluate and
identify policy options to address prison
reform
Championed the
new federal guidelines
for educational equity
released by the Department of
Education, a document that stems from my involvement in the Equity and
Excellence Commission
Joined
President Obama and Mayor Michael Nutter to announce
West Philadelphias selection as one of the first five
Economic Promise Zones
in the
country
Helped
lead
the call that resulted in a successful renewal of contributions by
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the National Housing Trust
Fund , an entity that will increase the supply of affordable rental housing
across the U.S.
2014 was an incredibly
productive year; millions were helped as a result of my initiatives, but
we have much more to accomplish, both in the Philadelphia region and
around the country.
Constituent services will remain a top
priority for both my Washington and Philadelphia offices.
Starting
later this month, our staff will offer mobile office hours at
locations around the district to better reach residents who may not be able
to visit the Philadelphia officestay tuned for more
details.
I am excited to continue our work, serving you, the people of
Pennsylvanias 2 nd
Congressional District.
Very truly
yours,
Please Feel Free to Tell a Friend
