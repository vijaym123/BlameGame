Baldwin, for working with me on creating a successful bipartisan process.
The result is the selection of a well-qualified jurist, James D.
Peterson, who will serve the nation and the people of Wisconsins western

Milwaukee Journal
Sentinel:
Coverup on Benghazi does make a
difference
By: Ron
Johnson
Fifteen months ago, I
asked then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton why she hadn't simply
picked up the phone and talked to the Benghazi survivors to find out
what had actually happened. Instead of being straightforward, she
deflected this uncomfortable question with a now-infamous question of her
own: "What difference, at this point, does it
make?"
The answer to that question
and the motive behind this administration's lies and coverup are
finally becoming quite clear. The belated release of a Sept. 14, 2012,
talking points email from deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes
proves that senior White House officials were fully engaged in directing
the coverup and perpetuating the
lies.
