Dear Friend,
If you&rsquo;re anything like me, you&rsquo;ve got an overflowing inbox to deal with. So I&rsquo;ll get right to the point:
this is a fundraising email.
I&rsquo;m sending you this email because you&rsquo;re one of my supporters, and right now, my campaign needs support. Financial support, to be specific. If you can contribute $5 to our campaign, I&rsquo;d be grateful. You&rsquo;ll help us get closer to our $55,000 goal before tomorrow&rsquo;s deadline.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Why do we need this money? Two reasons: first, campaigns cost money. Second, outside groups are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on this year&rsquo;s races, and they can jump into Massachusetts at a moment&rsquo;s notice.
With so much on the line -- the Tea Party only needs to pick up six seats to take the Senate -- we have to be prepared for anything. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking you for money. You can help us hit our $55,000 goal by making a $5 contribution before midnight tomorrow.
Thanks.
Ed
