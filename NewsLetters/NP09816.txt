Dear
friends,
This week, I joined a majority of my House colleagues in
voting to create a select committee to investigate the Benghazi
terrorist attack of September 11, 2012.
As youll recall, it was on
that day that U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens and three
other Americans were killed in a terrorist assault on the U.S. diplomatic
mission in Benghazi, Libya.
However, within hours of the attack
and continuing through today
the Obama administration has
stonewalled Congress and misled the American people about what happened in
Benghazi and why it occurred.
Through a select committee, we will
hold the administration accountable and spur greater action to bring
the perpetrators of the attack to justice.
The assassination
of Ambassador Stevens was the first killing of an American ambassador
since 1979.
Under international law, the murder of an
ambassador is normally considered an act of war.
And yet, the
administration responded to the attack by deflecting attention away from those
responsible for it.
Instead of placing the blame squarely where
it belonged
on the terrorists who have thrived in Libya since the
administrations bombing campaign toppled the Libyan government in 2011
the administration blamed an obscure filmmaker living in America,
claiming that his film
which was critical of Islam
caused
spontaneous protests that got out of hand.
There was never any evidence
for this claim
even though US Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice repeated
it on five Sunday talk shows.
In the heat of a presidential
campaign, their story changed over and over again, even while they
charged Republicans with politicizing the issue.
The only thing
that Republicans have asked for is the truth.
And weve been
clamoring for the truth because the American people are demanding
it.
In the twenty months since the attack, a steady drip of revelations
has made it clear that the White House has been untruthful about
Benghazi and they have been working to cover it up.
Just last week, a
court order revealed that the White House ignored a Congressional
subpoena by withholding an email about Benghazi from Congressional
investigators.
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney compounded the
damage by claiming that the email was not about Benghazi.
Carneys preposterous spin was the impetus for Speaker Boehners decision to
seek a select committee, and it was the right
one.
The American people have a right to know what happened in
Benghazi.
They want the truth
all of it
and they deserve it.
With
the administration continuing to stonewall, Congress is taking it upon
itself to get answers for the American people, asserting its oversight
authority over the executive branch.
Under the leadership of
Chairman Trey Gowdy
who will lead the committee
we will get to the
bottom of what happened and make sure it never happens
again.
