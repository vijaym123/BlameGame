Mother's Day
Congressman Yoder with his daughter Caroline and his mother

Happy Mother's Day to all of the moms in the

my mom Susan, and my wife Brooke.

Bartiromo on Fox Business Network's

to discuss
the 2016 Presidential Election, the House of Representatives' work thus

Manufacturing Legislative
Excellence Award
YRC Worldwide CEO
James Welch recognizing Representative Yoder for receiving the
Manufacturing Legislative Excellence Award.
I was honored to
be chosen for the Manufacturing Legislative Excellence Award by the
National Association of Manufacturers for my work during the 113th
Congress.
A healthy manufacturing sector is the
key to a healthy economy. Its clear now more than ever Congress
needs to promote policies that help our manufacturers compete on the
global stage. I will continue to work with my colleagues in the House of
Representatives to remove the red tape in the form of government
regulation in order to foster an environment where our Kansas manufacturers,
who already provide more than 160,000 jobs, can expand at a faster
rate.
National Teacher Appreciation Week

Last week was National Teacher Appreciation
Week. Often times, teachers end up being some of the most influential
people in our lives.
Congressman Yoder with Blue Valley West social
studies teacher and assistant track and football coach, Josh
Koerkenmeier.
As a product of public
schools, I have advocated for early-childhood education programs like Head
Start throughout my career. Earlier this year, I was recognized as one
of only two Republicans in the House of Representatives as an
inaugural recipient of the PROMISE Award by the National Head Start
Association for my efforts.

Lungren, and Alexander Falk of Piper Middle
School.
Thank you to all of the teachers in the Third
District for your hard work and dedication to our children and the future
of our country.

Middle School social studies teacher Judith
Schieszer.
Small Business
Week
Last week was also National Small
Business Week. Small businesses are what keep this nation thriving, and are
what will continue to drive our economy into the 21st
Century.
Here are some interesting facts about small business in
America:
A small business is generally defined as any
enterprise with fewer than
500
employees .
There are an estimated
28 million
small
businesses in the United States.
Half of Americas workforce
is employed at a
small business.
99.7 percent of
all U.S. employers
are small
businesses.
Americas small businesses create roughly
7 out of every 10
new
jobs.
Last year, the U.S.
ranked 46th
in ease of starting a business
according to a World Bank report. In 2007, it ranked 3rd.
Small
businesses create
more than
half
of our gross domestic product.
Small
businesses produce
16.5
times
more patents per employee than large
firms.
In Kansas:
Kansass small businesses employ
over half
or
595,048 of the states private workforce.
Association of Americans for Civic Responsibility
On
Friday, I gave the closing remarks to the Association of Americans for
Civic Responsibility conference in Overland Park hosted by the Asian
American Chamber of Commerce of Kansas City. Highlighting National Small
Business Week, we discussed the role of small business in our local
community and the importance of giving back. Thank you to Joe Melookaran
for inviting me to participate in this important
discussion.
National Day of Prayer
Last
Thursday, we observed the National Day of Prayer. Officially established in
1952, the day traces its roots back to the Second Continental Congress
in 1775. Our nation was founded on the principle of the free exercise
of religion, and every year through the National Day of Prayer we
celebrate that right endowed by our creator and enshrined in our
Constitution.
Fact of the
Week
Since 2008, more small businesses
have closed
than have opened. This is
the first time business deaths have exceeded business births since data
has been recorded on the issue.
Military Appreciation
Month
May is Military Appreciation
Month. Designated by Congress in 1999, Military Appreciation Month
encourages US citizens to observe this month in a symbol of unity, and honor
the current and former members of our military, including those who
have died in the defense of our freedom.
As a part of Military
Appreciation Month, last Friday marked the 70th Anniversary of VE Day
when we honor the Greatest Generation, led by fellow-Kansan General
Dwight D. Eisenhower, who fought for our freedom in World War
II.
Please join me in thanking all of our nation's courageous
veterans, active duty servicemembers, and their families for their
dedication to keeping America safe.
