Strengthening Protections for Pregnant Women
Earlier this week I joined with Senator Lisa Murkowski to introduce the Pregnancy Discrimination Amendment Act to strengthen protections for pregnant women in the workplace. The bill would amend a 1978 law to ensure that expecting moms have access to reasonable accommodations from their employers if health issues arise from pregnancy.
