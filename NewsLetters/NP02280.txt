David -- The Republican letter to Iran is really backfiring. Like, BIG TIME. Check out this headline from Rachel Maddow: &ldquo;GOP scrambles in the wake of sabotage fiasco.&rdquo;
That&rsquo;s all thanks to you!
Because you stood up for President Obama, Republicans who signed the letter are running away from it as fast as they can!
Now, let&rsquo;s make sure they can&rsquo;t escape this egregious mistake.
You need to show them that they should have NEVER, EVER disrespected your President.
We still need $75,000 for the Republican Accountability Fund by TONIGHT at MIDNIGHT to get the word out. Will you step up?
