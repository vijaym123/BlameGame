Dear Friend:
As you may know, earlier this year Congress passed legislation giving eligible veterans access to health care at non-VA facilities if they are experiencing long wait times for appointments or live 40 miles or more from a VA clinic.
The VA recently began mailing out Veterans Choice Cards on a rolling basis for veterans to use at non-VA facilities, and by the end of January all 9 million veterans who use the Veterans Health Administration should receive their cards.
More information on the Veterans Choice Program and answers to frequently asked questions are available on the
VA website . If you are a veteran and need help accessing the benefits you have earned, please do not hesitate to
contact my office .
The Veterans Choice Program is a good first step to improving veterans' health care, but there is much more to be done.
Be assured that I will keep working to ensure that the VA fulfills its obligation to provide the best quality and timeliest health care for our nation's veterans.
We owe these brave men and women nothing less.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
