Dear Friend,
Memorial Day weekend
traditionally kicks off the start of summer, when many Utah families look
forward to spending time as a family and traveling throughout our
state.
This year, as I started thinking about the summer driving
season, I visited
The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administrations (NHTSA) website . I was impressed by the significant
amount of helpful information available on the site, and thought you
might also find it useful.
There is no time like the present to
remember steps we can take to keep our families safe on the
road.
In particular, I found the following sections of the
NHTSA site to be useful:
1.
Driving Safety Tips
- As the parents of a fifteen year old, my wife and
I will be spending time this summer teaching our oldest son to
drive.
This section of the NHTSA site has great resources for
encouraging safe teen driving as well as tips for pedestrian safety, school
bus rules, tips to recognize and avoid aggressive driving,
recommendations for sharing the roadway with bicycles, suggestions for avoiding
distracted driving, and tips for older
drivers.
2.
Vehicle Safety
-
We have heard in
the news, and discussed in my committee in Congress, recent reports of
automobile recalls.
I find it helpful to have an official,
unbiased site to visit for information on product safety, testing, and
recommended standards.
This section of the NHTSA site includes
comprehensive information on crash tests, brakes, air bags, head restraints
and all vehicle recalls.
3.
Products
-
It is amazing how much technology changes
and improves on an annual basis.
In particular, child seats
undergo rigorous testing and are regularly updated to the best and safest
measures available.
This section of the NHTSA site helps parents
select the
appropriate type and size of child
seat , something pediatricians agree is the frontline for preventing
serious childhood injuries.
Another related and important section
features suggestions for proper installation of child seats.
Finally, this section of the site offers
guidance on tire
purchase and maintenance .
I hope you and your
family have a safe and happy summer.
It is an honor to serve in
Congress on behalf of Utah families like yours. As your representative,
I always appreciate hearing from you on current topics and issues
affecting you and our community. Please let me know areas you find
especially interesting or where I can provide you with additional
information. I value your ideas and look forward to hearing from
you.
Sincerely,
U.S.
Representative
4th District of
Utah
