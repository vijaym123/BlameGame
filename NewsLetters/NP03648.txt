Working for You
Monday, December 29, 2014
Dear Friend,
With 2014 and the 113th Congress both coming to a close, I wanted to take a brief moment to share with you a wrap up of some of the things I and my office have accomplished on behalf of the residents of the Central Coast over the last two years. I also want to remind you that my office may be able to assist you in a variety of ways, whether it is setting up a tour of the U.S. Capitol or White House or helping cut through bureaucratic red tape.
If you want to keep in touch or reach out to my office, please contact me through my
website , by liking my
Facebook
page, following me on
Twitter , or sending me an
email .
Sincerely,
Lois Capps
MEMBER OF CONGRESS
