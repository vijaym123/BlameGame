Dear
Friend,
Today, news and key updates can develop in an instant.
You
get this newsletter about every two weeks, but a lot happens in
between. If you want to stay up to date on the latest happenings in Congress,
the best way to do that is by liking me on
Facebook
and
following me on
Twitter .
Click
here
right now to stay up to
date with my
Facebook
posts.
Heres a great
example:
This week, I joined a loud chorus of voices in opposition to the Supreme
Courts decision in the Hobby Lobby case. I stood with my colleagues
from the House of Representatives with Senators and advocates to say
that a woman's healthcare decisions are hers and not the Supreme
Court's, not politicians', and certainly not her boss'. I introduced a bill
this week that would fix the Hobby Lobby decision, and with that
introduction, we have high-quality
videos , beautiful
photographs , and fun
infographics
that
you can share with your friends and neighbors. Joining me on
Facebook
and
Twitter
is a great way to engage with the work that I
do on your behalf as your representative.
Of course,
youll still receive this chock full of information LouiseLine, and your
phone calls and letters remain an important part of our communication,
but Im always finding new ways to keep in touch!
