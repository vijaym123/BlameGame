The Congressional Connector
Week of Feb 2 - 8,
2014
Its Time
for Congress to Reward Work
There has been a lot of discussion lately about income
inequality in America.
Despite the current economic recovery,
middle- and low-income households have had a harder time making ends
meet.
As a new
report
by Joint Economic
Committee Democrats states, Middle-class incomes have stagnated, with the
average American household making less in 2012 than it did in 1989
(adjusted for inflation).... Economic mobility in the United States is
lower than in most other advanced economies.
Raising the minimum wage is one thing that
Congress could do to help reduce the number of Americans working in
poverty.
Right now a full-time minimum wage worker makes just $14,500 a
year.
Rep. Levin has joined over 180 other members of the House
in sponsoring H.R. 1010, which would raise the federal minimum wage for
working Americans in stages to $10.10 per hour.
Raising the
minimum wage would immediately help lift 4.6 million out of
poverty.
Around 60 percent of workers benefitting from a higher minimum wage
are women.
1.7 Million Americans Cut Off Unemployment
Insurance
Nearly
1.7 million people
including 59,946 in Michigan
have been cut off
their unemployment benefits since the expiration of the federal
Emergency Unemployment Compensation program on December 28, according to a new
analysis
released by Rep. Levin and Ways and
Means Committee Democrats.
Every week, 72,000 people, on average,
are losing their benefits.
House Republicans have blocked
multiple efforts to bring up legislation to extend the program on the House
floor.
Unemployment benefits provide critical assistance for jobseekers as they look
for work, helping them to feed and clothe their families and allowing
them to pay their mortgages, said Rep. Levin.
Millions of
Americans depend on it, as does our
economy.
Rep. Levin Backs
Resolution to Raise Cancer Awareness
According to the World Health Organization (WHO),
worldwide cancer rates are expected to drastically increase 57% over the
next twenty years.
Early diagnosis, treatment, and appropriate
management of cancer can help to control symptoms and improve the
quality of life.
Since cancer affects so many individuals and those
diagnosed with cancer face such severe challenges, it is important to
recognize and put emphasis on research and raising
awareness.
Rep. Levin has joined other
concerned Members in Congress as an original cosponsor of a
Resolution
expressing support for the designation of February
4th as National Cancer Prevention
Day.
