We Must
Increase Our Energy Independence and
Create Jobs with the Keystone XL
Pipeline
Dear Friend,
As I have traveled across the Fifth
District, I consistently hear about the
variety of negative impacts that high fuel
costs create. High gas prices hurt families
trying to pay their bills, making it more
expensive to fill their tanks and
increasing the price of groceries and other
goods. Rising fuel prices harm small
businesses and farms that need reliable
energy to operate their machinery,
inhibiting their ability to succeed and
grow. And energy costs impact schools, as
filling up school buses takes more and more
resources away from teachers and
classrooms.
These examples and many others clearly
demonstrate that our failure to adopt a
strong national energy strategy is
hindering our economic growth and burdening
families at a time when we can least afford
it. As the summer months with traditionally
higher fuel costs approach, Washington
needs to move forward with pro-growth
energy policies that focus on the needs of
families, small businesses, and farms.
One important step we could take right
away is approval of the Keystone XL
Pipeline. It is a key piece of an
all-of-the-above energy strategy aimed at
reducing our dependence on foreign sources
of energy and giving Americans more
affordable domestic energy choices. This
project represents an opportunity to make
our nations energy future more
secure and will create an estimated 20,000
American jobs while investing billions into
our struggling economy.
The application to build the Keystone XL
Pipeline was submitted over five years ago,
but the Obama administration has used a
variety of tactics to delay and frustrate
the project's progress. Numerous exhaustive
reviews have been performed by the
administration showing that the project
will have limited environmental impacts and
meets the requirements for approval. The
House has voted to approve this project
seven times with strong bipartisan support,
but the president will not budge. Making
matters worse, the administration recently
announced that a decision on the pipeline
will be postponed indefinitely. The overtly
political nature of the delay likely
postpones a decision until after this
years midterm elections if not
longer.
If the United States refuses to build
the Keystone XL Pipeline, China will
instead seize the opportunity to access
Canadas rich supply of oil and the
economic growth associated with possessing
greater energy resources. In this highly
competitive global economy, we cannot pass
up this dynamic opportunity to increase our
economic output and instead allow a
competitor to capture that growth.
It is time that the President and the
Senate join the House in supporting the
approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline as the
first step of an all-of-the-above energy
approach that will lower gas prices, create
new American jobs, reduce our dependence on
foreign oil, strengthen our national
security, and make life easier for our
families, Main Street businesses, and small
farms.

Robert visited the Old Bust Head Brewing
Company, which recently opened in
Warrenton, where he spoke with one of its
co-owners, Ike Broaddus.
Robert met with John Schied of Green
Pastures and Jessie Swan of Quailwood Farm
following an roundtable discussion with
local leaders in the agriculture industry
in Fauquier.
