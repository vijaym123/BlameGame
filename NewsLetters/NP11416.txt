[cid:image006.jpg@01CF3F96.CAF80590]SMALL TOWN AMERICA SHOULDNT RESEMBLE A WAR ZONE: Please take a minute to read my latest op-ed in The USA Today . County, city and small-town police departments across the country are now acquiring free military-grade weapons from the Pentagon. We have to ask ourselves as a nation C is this who we really are? There are countless stories of police departments getting (and often later selling) assault weapons, drones, and other military-grade equipment that is absolutely ill-suited for America's main streets. The Pentagons 1033 program, which provides or transfers surplus Department of Defense military equipment to state and local civilian law enforcement agencies without charge, is a big part of this disturbing trend. Thats why Im considering legislation to reform the 1033 program before Americas main streets and civilian police militarize any further. For more, click HERE .
INTERSTATE TAXATION & E-COMMERCE: As the ranking member of the House Judiciary subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law, my committee has recently been addressing interstate taxation and e-commerce C specifically Internet sales tax solutions. By closing the online sales tax loophole, states across the country could add much-needed revenue to build schools, roads, bridges, and other infrastructure projects that put Americans back to work.
Numerous House Judiciary Committee hearings have been held on this issue. We understand the problem, and we know it must be addressed. The Senate has already reported legislation on this subject that is overwhelmingly bipartisan. Its time for the House Judiciary Committee follow suit.
As the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, I look forward to working together with my Republican and Democratic colleagues on this important issue. For more, click HERE .

FIGHTING FRAUD: More than $4.3 billion in FY 2013 and a total of $19.2 billion over the last five years in fraudulent payments in Medicare and related programs have been recovered for the benefit of U.S. taxpayers. One of the key goals of the Affordable Care Act was cracking down on waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare and other federal health care programs. The Affordable Care Act provides agencies new tools to crack down on fraud. The results today show these tools are working. This is the fifth consecutive year that the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program has increased recoveries over the previous year, climbing from $2 billion in FY 2008 to over $4 billion every year since FY 2011.

Dear
F riends,
I took action this week by signing a discharge petition that would force an up-or-down vote to extend unemployment insurance for more than 2 million Americans. The bill extends emergency
unemployment insurance for nearly 5 million Americans looking for work through the end of the year. More than 2 million Americans, including about 76,000 here in Georgia, have been cut off from this vital lifeline for more than 2 months. Now is the time for
action on unemployment insurance. For more, click
