Subject: GOOD news! David, I&rsquo;ve got some bad news: As you read this, Republicans are in the midst of a multi-million dollar ad blitz.
If we&rsquo;re not prepared, Democrats like Brad Schneider could be left hanging. But don&rsquo;t worry -- I&rsquo;ve also got some good news:
There&rsquo;s still time to close the gap. The election is exactly 13 days away. If you step up right now, Brad can fend off the attacks, get out the facts to Illinois voters, and win.
The choice is yours, David. Can I count you in? Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Now or never.
