Better Serving Our
Veterans
Recently, I met with
officials at the Veterans Affairs Regional Benefit Office in Winston-Salem
to discuss the challenges they face in serving our veterans. Veterans
Affairs (VA) hospitals across the country have come under scrutiny
following terrible reports of mismanagement and misconduct. It saddens
me to hear about these cases, yet it is encouraging to see that some VA
centers, such as the one in Winston-Salem, are committed to providing
our veterans with the care they
deserve.
My staff and I have also worked with the folks at the Charles George
VA Medical Center in Asheville, another VA facility that is putting
the needs of our veterans first. I'm grateful for the work these VA's
are doing and look forward to continuing to partner with them to better
serve our veterans. If you need assistance with the VA, my office has
set up an email dedicated to helping with VA issues. You can email us
at:
VAHelp@mail.house.gov.

President Obama Signs Bill Honoring Officer
Jason Crisp
On August 8, President Obama signed into law a bill to name the Ranger
Station in Nebo, North Carolina the Jason Crisp Forest Service
Building, in honor of fallen U.S. Forest Service Officer Crisp. I
introduced the legislation (H.R. 4360) in April with the support of the entire
North Carolina House delegation following Officer Crisps death in the
line of duty in March. While on a manhunt for a homicide suspect in
Burke County, NC, Crisp and his K-9, Maros, were shot and killed. The
Ranger Station will serve as a memorial to Officer Crisp for his
selfless service to the community.

Countering the
Myth of the "Do-Nothing
Congress"
Many of you have contacted our office lately regarding
the"Do-Nothing Congress. I understand the frustration you have regarding
Congress inability to move legislation forward. However, I can tell you
that day-in and day-out many of my colleagues and I are working to
pro-actively address the issues that matter most to our constituents.
Unfortunately, despite our best attempts, our efforts are often thwarted
in the Senate.
Currently, 332
House-passed, bipartisan bills are sitting in the Senate waiting for Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid to act and take them up for a vote.The American
people deserve more than inaction and stonewalling. That is why I
will continue to work across the aisle when possible to encourage the
Senate to act. If youd like to read more about the myth of the
"Do-Nothing Congress", check out this
