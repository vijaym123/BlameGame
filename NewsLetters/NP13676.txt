News from Representative John Delaney
December 12, 2013
Dear Friend,
I write to you tonight to share some important news. Today the House of
Representatives took a critical step towards enacting the first
bipartisan budget agreement to come out of a divided Congress since
1986. With only a month left until the expiration of government
funding, Democrats and Republicans in the House came together to pass
H.J.Res. 59, the Bipartisan Budget Act, by a vote of 332 to 94. The
agreement, which authorizes funding for federal agencies through fall
of 2015 and avoids a government shutdown for another two years, now
heads to the Senate for a vote.
Today's bipartisan agreement marked needed progress towards a better
functioning government. This year, our country suffered a 16-day
government shutdown and a near default on our nation's debt, all
because Congress couldn't find common ground. These kinds of partisan
standoffs are damaging to our economy, to our families and businesses,
and to our country's faith in public institutions.
I saw firsthand how painful the recent shutdown was for my district,
which is home to thousands of dedicated federal civil servants, and I
was happy to see a compromise that will keep our government running.
Coming from the private sector, I am of the fundamental belief that
good policy comes at the intersection of principle and compromise.
While H.J.Res. 59 did not have everything I believe our nation's budget
should include, the deal avoids a government shutdown for the next two
years and sends a powerful message that when we come together, examine
the problem and talk about the facts, we can reach an agreement that
works for our country.
With that said, I believe Congress can do more to support a budget that
encourages job creation, values the contributions of federal employees,
reduces unemployment, and invests in science, research and education
that will keep our nation competitive. While the budget agreement didn't
action on all of these priorities, H.J.Res. 59 was better than the
alternative, which was gridlock, more uncertainty, and a continued
inability to focus on the real problems facing the country.
Please take a moment to let me know what you think our nation's budget
priorities should be in the coming year.
With a budget agreement that keeps government open, meets our national
security needs, and positions us to invest in the future, we have a
foundation to focus on our nation's top priorities. I was sent to
Washington to break partisan gridlock and rebuild our nation's economy,
and with a bipartisan budget behind us, it's time to get to work,
John

News
from
Representative
John
Delaney
December
12,
2013
Dear
Friend,
I
write
to
you
tonight
to
share
some
important
news.
Today
the
House
of
Representatives
took
a
critical
step
towards
enacting
the
first
bipartisan
budget
agreement
to
come
out
of
a
divided
Congress
since
1986. With
only
a
month
left
until
the
expiration
of
government
funding,
Democrats
and
Republicans
in
the
House
came
together
to
pass
H.J.Res.
59,
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act,
by
a
vote
of 332
to
94.
The
agreement,
which
authorizes
funding
for
federal
agencies
through
fall
of
2015
and
avoids
a
government
shutdown
for
another
two
years,
now
heads
to
the
Senate
for
a
vote.
Today&#8217;s
bipartisan
agreement
marked
needed
progress
towards
a
better
functioning
government.
This
year,
our
country
suffered
a
16-day
government
shutdown
and
a
near
default
on
our
nation&#8217;s
debt,
all
because
Congress
couldn&#8217;t
find
common
ground.
These
kinds
of
partisan
standoffs
are
damaging
to
our
economy,
to
our
families
and
businesses,
and
to
our
country&#8217;s
faith
in
public
institutions.
I
saw
firsthand
how
painful
the
recent
shutdown
was
for
my
district,
which
is
home
to
thousands
of
dedicated
federal
civil
servants,
and
I
was
happy
to
see
a
compromise
that
will
keep
our
government
running.
Coming
from
the
private
sector,
I
am
of
the
fundamental
belief
that
good
policy
comes
at
the
intersection
of
principle
and
compromise.
While
H.J.Res.
59
did
not
have
everything
I
believe
our
nation&#8217;s
budget
should
include,
the
deal
avoids
a
government
shutdown
for
the
next
two
years
and
sends
a
powerful
message
that
when
we
come
together,
examine
the
problem
and
talk
about
the
facts,
we
can
reach
an
agreement
that
works
for
our
country.
With
that
said,
I
believe
Congress
can
do
more
to
support
a
budget
that
encourages
job
creation,
values
the
contributions
of
federal
employees,
reduces
unemployment,
and
invests
in
science,
research
and
education
that
will
keep
our
nation
competitive.
While
the
budget
agreement
didn&#8217;t
action
on
all
of
these
priorities,
H.J.Res.
59
was
better
than
the
alternative,
which
was
gridlock,
more
uncertainty,
and
a
continued
inability
to
focus
on
the
real
problems
facing
the
country.
Please take a moment to let me know what you think our nation's budget priorities should be in the coming year.
With
a
budget
agreement
that
keeps
government
open,
meets
our
national
security
needs,
and
positions
us
to
invest
in
the
future,
we
have
a
foundation
to
focus
on
our
nation&#8217;s
top
priorities.
I
was
sent
to
Washington
to
break
partisan
gridlock
and
rebuild
our
nation&#8217;s
economy,
and
with
a
bipartisan
budget
behind
us,
it&#8217;s
time
to
get
to
work,
