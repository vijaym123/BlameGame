March 23, 2014
Dear Friend,
Whether it's attaining your higher education degree or getting that job
offer or promotion in the workplace, when we are given opportunity and
work hard, we can succeed.
Those opportunities should be widely
available to all, no matter your gender. Over the past century, our
country has made great strides in ensuring American women have equal
footing to get ahead, but there is still a lot of work to be done.
Women are an integral part of our society and our nation's success. As
businesses owners, educators, and dedicated members the armed forces,
women are innovators, initiators, and a critical driving force behind
the prosperity of our nation. However, there are still a few challenges
that must be overcome:
*	Women make up almost half of all workers, including nearly
two-thirds of minimum wage earners, and 40% of working women are the
primary providers for their families.
*
Yet, women still only earn 77 cents for every dollar that their
male peers earn for the same work.
*
In Texas, 50 years after President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay
Act, Texas women earn $7,859 less than men.
*
A single mother with two children, working full-time,
year-round, and earning the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 per
hour only makes $15,080 per year, or $4,450belowthe federal poverty
level for a family of three. If that single mother were earning $10.10
per hour instead, she could bring home roughly $21,000 per year.
Too many women in our country, who work equally as hard, are struggling
to support their families, pay their bills, and put food on the dinner
table.
By addressing the economic challenges and investing in job
training and education opportunities for women and their families,
including paycheck fairness, poverty levels, and minimum wage, women
will have the tools and economic security they need to support
themselves and their families.
We must act to ensure gender equality in this country and to strengthen
the rights of women in the workplace.
We must work to level the
playing field for women because when women succeed, America succeeds.
Women's Economic Forum in San Antonio
In celebration of Women's History Month, I hosted a Women's Economic
Forum last Saturday with Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and over 150
women at the Young Women's Leadership Academy in San Antonio to talk
about the economic issues affecting women in our country.
Community
leaders discussed topics such as the critical importance of paycheck
fairness, the challenges of work-family balance and the need for
childcare for working parents. It was a great opportunity to hear from
folks in the community and discuss how Congressional Democrats are
working to elevate the issues facing women.
There's One Week Left
There is still one week left to enroll in affordable, quality
healthcare coverage under the Affordable Care Act before the March
31stdeadline.
Over 5 million people, including nearly 300,000 Texans,
have already selected the health care plan that works best for
themselves and their families.
If you haven't done so already, I encourage you to check out your
options for affordable, quality healthcare insurance before Monday,
March 31st.
There will also be in-person enrollment events held
throughout the city through March 31stto assist folks in exploring
their options and selecting a coverage plan that is best for them and
their families.
Here are some helpful resources:
*
Deadline to Enroll in the Open Marketplace: March 31st

We in Congress must work to ensure that issues like equal pay, women's
health and minimum wage are addressed.
I have been a proud cosponsor
of legislation that ensures women in our nation are empowered and I
remain committed to championing these efforts.
Sincerely,
Member of Congress

Avoid
tables

are
more
than
a
single

because
they

You
can,

Dear
Friend,
Whether
it&#8217;s
attaining
your
higher
education
degree
or
getting
that
job
offer
or
promotion
in
the
workplace,
when
we
are
given
opportunity
and
work
hard,
we
can
succeed.
Those
opportunities
should
be
widely
available
to
all,
no
matter
your
gender.
Over
the
past
century,
our
country
has
made
great
strides
in
ensuring
American
women
have
equal
footing
to
get
ahead,
but
there
is
still
a
lot
of
work
to
be
done.
Women
are
an
integral
part
of
our
society
and
our
nation&#8217;s
success. As
businesses
owners,
educators,
and
dedicated
members
the
armed
forces,
women
are
innovators,
initiators,
and
a
critical
driving
force
behind
the
prosperity
of
our
nation. However,
there
are
still
a
few
challenges
that
must
be
overcome:
Women
make
up
almost
half
of
all
workers,
including
nearly
two-thirds
of
minimum
wage
earners,
and
40%
of
working
women
are
the
primary
providers
for
their
families.
Yet,
women
still
only
earn
77
cents
for
every
dollar
that
their
male
peers
earn
for
the
same
work.
In
Texas,
50
years
after
President
Kennedy
signed
the
Equal
Pay
Act,
Texas
women
earn
$7,859
less
than
men. A
single
mother
with
two
children,
working
full-time,
year-round,
and
earning
the
current
federal
minimum
wage
of
$7.25
per
hour
only
makes
$15,080
per
year,
or
$4, 450 below the
federal
poverty
level
for
a
family
of
three.
If
that
single
mother
were
earning
$10.10
per
hour
instead,
she
could
bring
home
roughly
$21,000
per
year.
Too
many
women
in
our
country,
who
work
equally
as
hard,
are
struggling
to
support
their
families,
pay
their
bills,
and
put
food
on
the
dinner
table.
By
addressing
the
economic
challenges
and
investing
in
job
training
and
education
opportunities
for
women
and
their
families,
including
paycheck
fairness,
poverty
levels,
and
minimum
wage,
women
will
have
the
tools
and
economic
security
they
need
to
support
themselves
and
their
families.
We
must
act
to
ensure
gender
equality
in
this
country
and
to
strengthen
the
rights
of
women
in
the
workplace.
We
must
work
to
level
the
playing
field
for
women
because
when
women
succeed,
America
succeeds.
Women&#8217;s
Economic
Forum
in
San
Antonio
In
celebration
of
Women&#8217;s
History
Month,
I
hosted
a
Women&#8217;s
Economic
Forum
last
Saturday
with
Democratic
Leader
Nancy
Pelosi
and
over
150
women
at
the
Young
Women&#8217;s
Leadership
Academy
in
San
Antonio
to
talk
about
the
economic
issues
affecting
women
in
our
country.
Community
leaders
discussed
topics
such
as
the
critical
importance
of
paycheck
fairness,
the
challenges
of
work-family
balance
and
the
need
for
childcare
for
working
parents.
It
was
a
great
opportunity
to
hear
from
folks
in
the
community
and
discuss
how
Congressional
Democrats
are
working
to
elevate
the
issues
facing
women.
There&#8217;s
One
Week
Left
There
is
still
one
week
left
to
enroll
in
affordable,

31 st deadline.
Over
5
million
people,
including
nearly
300,000
Texans,
have
already
selected
the
health
care
plan
that
works
best
for
themselves
and
their
families.
If
you
haven&#8217;t
done
so
already,
I
encourage
you
to
check
out
your
options
for
affordable,
quality
healthcare
insurance
before
Monday,
March
31 st .
There
will
also
be
