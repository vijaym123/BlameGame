New Years Resolutions for
2015
With 2014 quickly fading into the history books, I respectfully
recommend that Americans everywhere resolve to show continuing support for
two irreplaceable groups of individuals: 1) members of our Armed
Forces and the their families; and 2) members of the law enforcement
community and all first responders.
These selfless people work
every day to preserve our security, often at their own peril.
They
protect our safety and preserve the peace with courage and character
and they deserve our gratitude every day of
2015!
Americas Economy? More Work to Do in 2015!
The
American people are resilient!
The ongoing recovery,
such as it is, from the worst recession in recent memory can be
attributed to the hard work and persistence of the individuals at their jobs
and small business men and women who have doggedly run or started new
enterprises.
Government "support" had very little to do with our
economic revival.
Of course, in 2015, we have
much more work to do.
For 137 years, the United States has
dominated the global economy
and as recently as 2000, we produced nearly
three times as much as China. But in the last few years, our
production rate and global output has not maintained the growth of our
competitors.
Today, China has surpassed the U.S. as the worlds
largest economy! So not only are Americans struggling with costs at home,
but our country is falling globally as well.
Yes, I
realize that the Feds just reported that our economy grew impressively
during the third quarter of 2014. However, we only have to look back
to the first quarter of this year, when our economy actually
contracted, to see that we need the government to "get off the backs and out of
the way" of American businesses.
Notably Obamacare and other
unnecessary regulations have thrown a "wet blanket" over economic
progress.
It is time for economic reform across-the-board. Success
abroad is dependent on success at home
more jobs and better pay
will translate to greater productivity and a robust national
economy.
As the new Congress convenes next week, many reforms are at
the top of our list.
Our mission as the House Majority is to
change that, to move America in the right direction:
Creating jobs in
a growing economy is our top priority.
Of course, the
House and the Senate must work together. We have a number of bills that we
can quickly move to the Presidents desk.
We are encouraging
him to work with us to put America first.
After all, we all
know that the United States does not belong in second
place.
American Legions Family Support
Center
When a servicemember deploys, like the 200 members of the New Jersey
National Guard who recently landed in Bahrain, or returns home from a
deployment, it is often his or her family that feels the most
strain.
The American Legion has gathered all of the various resources
and services that it offers these servicemen and women and their
families into its
Troop and Family Support
Center - a comprehensive, online hub that provides links to apply for the
Legion's Family Support Network (FSN), Operation Comfort
Warriors (OCW), Temporary Financial Assistance (TFA) and
scholarship opportunities.

Repeating Iraq
Mistakes?
President Obamas Sunday announcement that our combat mission in
Afghanistan is ending is a somber occurrence. Of course, no one wants to
see our military men and women in harms way, but as weve seen in Iraq
with the rise of ISIL, arbitrary, political deadlines on war are
rarely observed or honored by our terrorist
enemies.
Senator John McCain, incoming Chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, believes that we are on the verge of repeating the mistakes we
made in withdrawing from Iraq.
I agree.
This was a recurring
theme I heard personally from leaders across the Persian Gulf and
Middle East.

Our goal must be to preserve the hard-won gains of our troops and
meet our national security
objectives.

Thank you to the
Semper Fi Fund and Greentree
Development Group
for donating a condominium in Wanaque to a
local Wounded Warrior, retired Marine Matt Todd, who suffered
injuries to his leg and toes in his first deployment to Iraq and then was
injured again after redeploying in 2007.
I was honored to attend
the ceremony during which Matt received the keys to his new home. Read
