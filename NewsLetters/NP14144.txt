Highlights in the Legislative Program
Major breakthrough in LIHEAP funding for NMI - Families receiving help on their utility bills from Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program can look forward to more assistance after January 1. After two years of work by your congressional office, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has decided to increase the annual grant we receive to the maximum allowed by law. I spotted the opportunity in 2011 and got all of the territorial representatives in Congress to co-sign a letter
to the Secretary asking for the increase. We pointed out the high percentage of low-income families in our islands and the high cost of utilities - as much as four times the national average. Sebelius promised a review, but it took a second letter this August ,with newly available income statistics from the U.S. Census and updated information on electricity rates, to finally get action. HHS informed your congressional office this week that the territorial set-aside, which has remained unchanged since 1981, would now go from 0.135 percent of total funding to 0.5 percent, the statutory maximum. LIHEAP grants can be used to pay for electricity, make home improvements that save energy, and, in a crisis, prevent service interruptions. As many as 300 families in the Northern Marianas have in recent years received up to $58 in monthly assistance from the federal program. The number of NMI families who are eligible and the monthly aid amount can significantly increase now.

[I delivered a statement this week on the House floor to reinforce the need for more help to the people of the Philippines who continue to suffer from the devastation in the wake of Supertyphoon Yolanda.
Although our nation was quick to respond to the relief effort, I know there is more that needs to be done.
So I took the opportunity to tell Congress of the need for more assistance.]

US responds to Yolanda disaster - America has a long history with the people of the Philippines, so we are responding quickly and forcefully to the humanitarian needs there in the wake of Typhoon Yolanda. The U.S. Government is already providing more than $22 million in assistance for emergency shelter, water, and sanitation, as well as helping with airlifts of government and private relief supplies to storm-battered areas. Latest reports indicate the typhoon affected 8.7 million people, leaving 819,000 homeless, and causing up to 4,460 deaths. In the Northern Marianas we know what it feels like to be hit by a typhoon. So, our hearts and prayers go out to the people of the Philippines. Members of Congress are prohibited by ethics rules from using official resources to solicit or collect donations of goods, funds, or services on behalf of private organizations, but I have provided a link of my official website, http://sablan.house.gov, to official government websites that give details about how constituents may help, if you want to.

[Fighting for improved benefits for Rota and Tinian - I continue to push for increased food stamp benefits for Rota and Tinian, where food costs are very high. This week I met with a Department of Agriculture official, Mr. Scott Carter of the Food and Nutrition Service, to make the case. I gave him the Commonwealth Commerce Department's recent report showing that prices on Rota are up 10.5 percent and on Tinian 16.5 percent since 2010. Food stamp recipients throughout the Northern Marianas should all be able to buy the same amount of food each month. Increasing the benefit for Rota and Tinian will make sure everyone has equal buying power under the food stamp program.]
Water resources bill moves forward - The House has appointed its members to the conference committee on the Water Resources Reform and Development Act. The conference committee will reconcile differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill and recommend final passage. The House version of H.R.3080
includes my provision doubling the waiver of the local match requirement for Army Corps projects in the Northern Mariana Islands. This will increase the current $200,000 waiver, set in 1986, to reflect inflation over the last 27 years. The new waiver should be in excess of $400,000, meaning projects can go forward without $400,000 of Commonwealth money. Last week, I joined with 29 other Members from both sides of the aisle calling for appointment of the conferees in a letter to Speaker John Boehner (Ohio) and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (California) . I appreciate their quick response to our request. Typical Army Corps projects in the NMI recently have included the Rota Harbor improvements completed in 2008 and the on-going Susupe-Chalan Kanoa Drainage Plan to address flooding in those villages. If WRRDA is enacted with my provision, the planned Outer Cove Marina project and the Saipan Lagoon Aquatic Ecosystem Restoration project could each cost the Commonwealth over $200,000 less.

Ms. Esther Kia'aina met with me on Wednesday, prior to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing on her nomination by President Obama to be Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Insular Areas. Ms. Kia'aina and I worked together in the office of the late Senator Daniel K. Inouye of Hawai'i back in the 1980s. She was an intern; I was a congressional fellow. I am pleased that the President has named an islander to this important post and look forward to working with Ms. Kia'aina when she is confirmed by the U.S. Senate.
$165,565 awarded to Department of Public Safety - The U.S. Department of Transportation has announced the award of $165,565 to the Commonwealth's Department of Public Safety. The grant will support state highway safety programs aimed at improving driver behavior to reduce deaths and injuries. Congratulations to DPS.

[Jack and Becky Cruz and their grandson, Brandon, visited their congressional office this week while touring the nation's capital.

Another REAP grant for alternative energy in the NMI - Servino & Associates, Inc. is the recipient of a $2,633 Renewable Energy Assistance grant from the Department of Agriculture. The company will use the funds to buy a 5 kilowatt, grid-tied photovoltaic system for its offices on Saipan. This is the second REAP grant announced in the Northern Marianas this month. Earlier Marianas Business Plaza was granted $500,000, also to use for solar electrical generation. Congratulations to Servino & Associates.
