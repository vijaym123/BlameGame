I'm disgusted.
Boehner&rsquo;s Republicans just BLOCKED consideration of a Constitutional amendment to overturn
Citizens United .
The American people deserve better -- and Republicans just proved they&rsquo;re not willing to change. That's why I'm coming directly to you.
It's time to go on the offensive and expose the Kochs' friends in the House -- and we need just $47,000 by midnight to make it happen. Can you pitch in $5 right now? ALL GIFTS TODAY MATCHED! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
Nancy
