Dear Friends,
Recently, the Senate Intelligence
Committee, of which I am vice chairman, released a
declassified bipartisan report
on the September 11, 2012, terrorist
attacks that killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya. This report
provides many needed and deserved answers to the American people, and most
importantly, to the families of those lost in the
attacks.
Based on dozens of Committee hearings, briefings and interviews,
including with survivors of the attacks, and the review of thousands of
pages of Intelligence Community, Department of Defense, and State
Department materials from the time of the attack until now, the committee
worked in a bipartisan manner to get to the truth of what happened in
the attacks.
As a result of these investigations, the
Intelligence Committees report confirms that
these attacks
were preventable . The Intelligence Community provided ample
warnings of the worsening situation and terrorist activity in Libya, and it
is now clear the U.S. government simply did not do enough to ensure
the safety of those serving our country in Benghazi. The State
Department failed to adequately respond to the threat and the U.S. military
personnel were not properly positioned to respond to the
attacks.
Despite the confusion immediately following the attack and the
misleading CIA talking points, we know that this was a
terrorist attack , and the U.S. government must continue to work
to swiftly bring these attackers to justice.
Based on the
findings of this report, the Intelligence Committee provided 18
recommendations to improve security and the process for sharing unclassified
information with policymakers. There have been too many unanswered
questions since these attacks, and I hope that the Administration, the
Intelligence Community, the State Department, and our military will
review this bipartisan report carefully and quickly adopt the committees
recommendations.
Moving forward, it is important that we
learn from the mistakes that were made leading up to, during, and
following these attacks, and that we do everything possible to prevent
another tragedy such as this.
