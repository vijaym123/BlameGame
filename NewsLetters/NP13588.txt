Victory On Volcker Rule
There is good news for those who want a safe and sound financial system
that doesn't blow up our economy. Last week regulators finalized a rule
authored by Senator Merkley along with Senator Carl Levin of Michigan
to rein in the big bets by banks on Wall Street. The rule will ban
risky trades by banks that take taxpayer-insured deposits. The rule,
dubbed the Volcker Rule, after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker, would create a firewall between traditional banking and hedge
fund-style gambling.

Hedge fund-style trading at our nation's largest financial firms was a
high-risk, conflict-ridden activity that played a central role in the
2008 financial crisis. Banks should be in the business of serving
customers on Main Street - including taking deposits from and making
loans to ordinary families and businesses. It's fine for people to make
speculative investments, but it needs to happen outside of banks so if
the bets go bad they don't imperil the lending so critical to our
economic growth.

Manufacturing
Last week, Jeff held a "Rebuilding American Manufacturing" hearing on
the state of American manufacturing. As Chair of the Senate Banking
Subcommittee on Economic Policy, Jeff called the hearing to focus on
the challenges and opportunities that domestic manufacturers face, in
addition to manufacturing's critical role in the economy and creating
middle class jobs.
Senator Merkley has traveled throughout Oregon on his "Made In Oregon"
tour to listen to manufacturers and hear the challenges and
opportunities they face. He invited Oregon Iron Works to testify at the
hearing.
In his effort to boost Oregon manufacturing, Jeff introduced this week
the Level the Playing Field in Global Trade Act to take action against
substandard wages, working conditions and environmental practices that
undercut Oregon businesses and cost us jobs. The bill would help
American manufacturers compete by reversing the trend of a global "race
to the bottom" in manufacturing conditions and rewarding responsible
companies that adhere to high global standards.
Jeff believes strongly that if we don't build things here in America,
we won't have a middle class in America.
Rural Energy
Investing in energy efficiency renovations is one of the best ways can
be creating good middle class jobs. Jeff has been fighting to create
and expand programs to help folks renovate their homes to save energy
and create jobs. Last week, the Administration implemented one of
Jeff's ideas to allow rural electric co-ops to offer their customers
low-interest loans from USDA to provide affordable financing for energy
efficiency improvements. The customers then pay back the loans through
the savings on their electric bills.
Jeff first put forward the idea in 2010 in a bipartisan partnership
with Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN). Under the new USDA program, low-cost
loans from the USDA's rural development program will be provided to
rural electric cooperatives and utilities, who will then re-lend the
money to help homeowners or businesses make energy efficiency
improvements. The loans may be used for upgrades to heating, lighting,
other appliances, and insulation, and conversions to more efficient or
renewable energy sources.

Jeff is a native of Myrtle Creek, Oregon and the son of a millwright.
The first in his family to go to college, Jeff still lives in the same
working class neighborhood that his parents eventually settled in and
his kids go to the same public high school he attended. Making the
American Dream a reality for others as it has been for him is what got
Jeff Merkley involved in public life and is what continues to keep him
fighting for Oregon families.
In the five years he has been in the U.S. Senate, Jeff Merkley has been
focused on creating jobs and getting our nation back on track. He led
the fight against high-risk gambling on Wall Street, has been a leading
voice for aggressive action to take on the foreclosure crisis, and
wrote the law that helps small businesses raise money on the internet
so they can grow and create jobs.
Jeff and his wife Mary have been married for twenty years and have two
children, Brynne and Jonathan, and an Airedale terrier, Sadie.
