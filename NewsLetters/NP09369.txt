Dear Friend,
On this Memorial Day, we pause as a nation to honor and pay tribute to
those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to secure our safety and
freedom.
We remember these fallen heroes who served our nation valiantly - in
the icy snows at Valley Forge, on the fields of Antietam and
Gettysburg, in the jungles of Vietnam, the waters of the Persian Gulf,
the mountains of Afghanistan, and the sweltering deserts of Iraq - as
brave members of the United States Armed Forces.
Today, we will remember all of them with solemn reverence for the
sacrifices they have made in the pursuit of our liberty and freedoms.
And we will remember the sacrifice their friends and families have
endured in losing them. Knowing that while we cannot measure the depth
of their loss, nor comprehend the weight of their sorrow, we will let
them know we will honor their loved ones by never forgetting their
sacrifice.
So this Memorial Day, let's all take the time to remember the fallen,
honor those who have served, and pray for those who continue to protect
America at home and abroad.
May God bless our fallen heroes and their families. And may God Bless
the United States of America.
In Liberty,

Dear
Friend,
On
this
Memorial
Day,
we
pause
as
a
nation
to
honor
and
pay
tribute
to
those
who
have
made
the
ultimate
sacrifice
to
secure
our
safety
and
freedom.
We
remember
these
fallen
heroes
who
served
our
nation
valiantly
&#8211;
in
the
icy
snows
at
Valley
Forge,
on
the
fields
of
Antietam
and
Gettysburg,
in
the
jungles
of
Vietnam,
the
waters
of
the
Persian
Gulf,
the
mountains
of
Afghanistan,
and
the
sweltering
deserts
of
Iraq
&#8211;
as
brave
members
of
the
United
States
Armed
Forces.
Today,
we
will
remember
all
of
them
with
solemn
reverence
for
the
sacrifices
they
have
made
in
the
pursuit
of
our
liberty
and
freedoms.
And
we
will
remember
the
sacrifice
their
friends
and
families
have
endured
in
losing
them.
Knowing
that
while
we
cannot
measure
the
depth
of
their
loss,
nor
comprehend
the
weight
of
their
sorrow,
we
will
let
them
know
we
will
honor
their
loved
ones
by
never
forgetting
their
sacrifice.
So
this
Memorial
Day,
let&#8217;s
all
take
the
time
to
remember
the
fallen,
honor
those
who
have
served,
and
pray
for
those
who
continue
to
protect
America
at
home
and
abroad.
May
God
bless
our
fallen
heroes
and
their
families.
And
may
God
Bless
the
United
States
of
America.
In
Liberty,
