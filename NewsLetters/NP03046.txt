Dear Friends,
Today, I'm celebrating Earned Income Tax Awareness day, a nationwide
effort to increase awareness about the Earned Income Tax Credit, known
as the EITC, and free tax preparation sites. For 40 years, the EITC has
made life easier for millions of hardworking Americans by putting money
back in their pockets.
Last year, more than 27 million workers received more than $65
billion in EITC refunds. In Delaware, 73,000 workers claimed the
credit, receiving $2,309 on average. Even with that many people taking
advantage of the credit, though, countless more Delawareans who
qualified missed out on this easy, simple tax refund.
This year, as we enter tax season, I am doing my best to keep eligible
Delawareans from missing out on this helpful, hard earned tax refund.
The EITC is available to families and single parents with children,
married couples without children, and even some individuals who file
taxes on their own.
If a worker had income of less than $52,427 last year, they should
check their eligibility for EITC. EITC can mean up to a $6,143 refund
for workers with qualifying children. Workers without a qualifying
child could be eligible for a smaller credit up to $496.
To ensure that you don't miss out on your tax credit, I encourage all
Delawareans to visit the IRS information page on the EITC
. There are also a number of organizations in our state that can
help you find out if you are eligible for this, and other tax credits.
You can find more information on those services at revenue.delaware.gov
. Don't leave money on the
table this tax season!
Sincerely,
