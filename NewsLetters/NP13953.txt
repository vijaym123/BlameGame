Shop a Small
Business this Holiday Season
This week,
we gather our families together to celebrate a day of giving thanks
for our blessings.
In his 1789 Thanksgiving proclamation,
President George Washington called the occasion a day of public thanksgiving
and prayer to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the
many signal favors of Almighty God especially by affording them an
opportunity peaceably to establish a form of government for their safety
and happiness.
We truly are blessed to live in a country
that is more prosperous than any other this world has ever known.
Even though its not perfect, we live in the greatest country on
Earth.
A country where a dream, hard work and a little common sense
can take you anywhere you want to go.
In
that vein, Americans have recently begun a new tradition that recognizes
our nations entrepreneurs.
Sandwiched between Black Friday and
Cyber Monday is Small Business Saturday, a day to support local
businesses that are at the heart of our communities.
Americas
small businesses are the engines of job creation and economic growth
responsible for creating about 7 out of 10 new jobs.
For every
$100 spent with locally-owned small business stores, an estimated $68
returns to the community through local taxes, payroll, and other
expenditures.
But for small businesses to continue being our
best economic catalysts, they need our support.
Small Business
Saturday is the perfect opportunity for consumers to get their holiday
shopping accomplished while supporting small businesses that will help
bolster the economy.
I hope you will take the time to
shop local this Saturday, and I wish you and your family a safe and Happy
Thanksgiving.

Sincerely,
Sam
