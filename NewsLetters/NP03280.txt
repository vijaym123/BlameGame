President sets nations goals in annual address to Congress
The State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday gave President Obama the opportunity to report how our nation is doing and, as importantly, set goals for our future. The President began in office when America was in the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Now, he can point to lower unemployment, strong economic growth, improved graduation rates, reduced dependence on foreign energy, and world-leading cuts in carbon pollution. There are still individuals in America who have not recovered and geographic areas that are doing less well than the nation as a whole. But even in the Northern Mariana Islands we see improvement. Tourism is up. We are sending more students to college. And some businesses and homeowners are shifting away from imported oil to renewable energy sources. I thought the President laid out the right strategies to build on current growth. In particular Congress needs to move forward on the Presidents education agenda:
*
helping more students attend and succeed in community colleges,
*
making sure that those students get trained to fill jobs in our economy,
*
putting more resources into early education.
As a member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, I expect to be involved in the debate on these proposals and to make sure that the Northern Mariana Islands participate fully.

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson hosted a briefing for Members of Congress this week and listened to our concerns about how the Department is operating nationwide and in our districts. Mr. Johnson brought his top management team. Pictured clockwise: Federal Emergency Management Administrator Craig Fugate, Vice Commandant of the Coast Guard Vice Admiral Peter Neffenger, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Len Rodrguez, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Sarah Saldaa, Transportation Security Administration Acting Deputy Administrator Mark Hatfield, Customs and Border Protection Commissioner R.

CBP Commissioner Kerlikowske and I huddled during a break in the meeting to discuss planned development of the Tinian airport to accept direct, international flights. This will require Customs and Border Protection agents on site to process incoming passengers. I wanted to be sure that the Commissioner was well aware that his agency would need to be ready to assign personnel to Tinian when all the necessary work at the airport is completed and airlines flights have been locked in.
Hoyer resolution would restore the vote for Delegates
House Democratic Whip Steny H. Hoyer (MD) introduced H. Res. 44
this week, which would amend the House rules to allow the Delegates of the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico to vote in the Committee of the Whole House. I was able to vote on the floor of the House on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
and other vital legislation during my first two years in office. When Republicans took the majority in 2011, however, they took away the vote that representatives of non-state areas enjoyed under Democratic leadership. I am re-introducing legislation to provide House Delegates and the Resident Commissioner with the right to vote in the Committee of the Whole House so that the nearly five million Americans they represent have a voice in Congress, Mr. Hoyer said. I strongly urge the House Republican leadership to reconsider
so that Delegates and the Resident Commissioner have the opportunity to show their constituents where they stand on issues, and their constituents can hold them accountable for their votes. Thank you, Mr. Hoyer. I could not agree more.

Setting reasonable limits on campaign financing
This week, I decided to be an original cosponsor of H.J. Res. 22 , legislation that begins the process of amending the U.S. Constitution to state clearly that Congress may set reasonable limits on campaign financing and may also prohibit corporations or other artificial entities created by law from spending money to influence elections. The proposed Constitutional amendment is a response to recent Supreme Court rulings that amplify the voices of those with money at the expense of ordinary Americans. Five years ago, in the case of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission , the Court granted corporations the right to spend unlimited sums of money in our elections. Last year, in McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission,
the Court lifted the $123,200 limit on individual contributions to candidates, so that now the wealthy may spend more than $6 million in each federal election cycle to candidates, parties, and joint election funds. We can see the results: in the 2014 midterm elections, the top 100 donors to political campaigns gave $323 million, about the same as the donations of the 4.75 million Americans who gave $200 or less. That is a system that needs to be brought back into balance so all Americans have a more equal voice.
