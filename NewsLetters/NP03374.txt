Dear Friend,
At a time when the
world is on high alert for terrorist attacks, this
week Republicans threatened to withhold funding for the Department of Homeland
Security. Clearly, the GOP is on the wrong track in jeopardizing our
national security with a tactical bill that is part of their radical
anti-immigrant agenda.
We must remember that America is a nation of
immigrants and must strive to make
America a land without poverty and
prejudice.
On Monday our nation will commemorate the birth
of civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who fought
to
'live together as brothers.'
As a young man, I was moved
by Dr. King's vision of peaceful co-existence and proudly marched
alongside Dr. King in 1963 from Selma to Montgomery. The march was
difficult, but Dr. Kings incredible leadership kept us going through. Little
did we know then that we were paving the path for the passage of
landmark legislation such as the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act of
1964. From my own election to Congress to the historical presidency of
Barack Obama, we have made so much progress as a nation. However,
until everyone in America is afforded the same opportunities to succeed,
we have much to go to fulfill Dr. King's
Dream.
Throughout this weekend, we pay tribute to Dr. Kings
accomplishments, and assess the work that remains in the struggle against
inequality. My commitment remains strong to making the Dream of an America
without poverty and prejudice a reality for all. With so much violence in
our world, we must remember Dr. King's message: 'darkness cannot drive
out darkness; only light can do that.'
His legacy will live on
as long as we keep shining that light.
My video honoring Dr. King:
I will
celebrate Dr. King's service
throughout our district, including
at The Apollo Theater's Hear Our Voices event reflecting on our work
to realize Dr. King's dream and at a screening of "Selma" at the
Abyssinian Baptist Church. Tell me: How will you #HonorMLK?

LEGISLATIVE UPDATE
I applaud President Barack Obama's recent deregulations
easing travel and trade restrictions with Cuba. I have
re-introduced my bill , the Free Trade with Cuba Act, to reflect
these needs and desires for change.
I have
consistently pushed for this bill over the past two decades but I have
never been so optimistic about its passage until now. I am grateful to
many of my colleagues
for joining me in this
effort to make history and tear down this barrier
.

with Cuba? Yes No Don't Know *By
