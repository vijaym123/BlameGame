Dear
Friend,
Our tax code is too complicated, too full of special interest
tax breaks, and woefully out of date. The last time Congress did a
major overhaul of our tax code was 1986. Since then, most of our global
competitors have adjusted their tax systems to compete in the global
economy. Every day we do not improve our outdated system of taxation, we
put our country at a competitive disadvantage with the rest of the
world.
A more transparent, modern, and simpler
tax code would
boost our economy and increase confidence within our
system.
One simplifying approach that just about everyone across the
political spectrum supports is the concept of reducing the number of
tax breaks in our code and lowering the overall tax rates.
This
is known as lowering rates and broadening the tax base. However, while
there is widespread support for this concept, disagreement starts as
soon as suggestions are made about which tax breaks should be
eliminated.
We all like the idea of lower tax rates.
As your representative, I am interested in hearing from you about which
tax breaks you think should stay in the tax code, and which ones you
would support eliminating.
Please let me know by participating
in the brief survey below.
I always appreciate hearing from you
on current topics and issues affecting you and our
community.
Sincerely,
U.S. Representative
4th District of
Utah
