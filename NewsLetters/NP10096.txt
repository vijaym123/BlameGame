Working to Fight Tax Fraud in NH
Hi All!
I hope you all had a great weekend. I spent last week fighting to
protect medical professionals in New Hampshire from tax fraud and
meeting with constituents in Washington.
Preserving Cybersecurity for Granite Staters
Following reports that over 140 medical professionals in New Hampshire
had been victims of tax fraud over the last year, I called on the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) to work with the Secret Service and
the Internal Revenue Service to identify and swiftly remedy any
vulnerabilities in their cybersecurity systems. Criminals somehow
obtained the Social Security numbers of doctors, dentists, and nurses,
and used them to falsely file tax returns in their names, presumably in
an attempt to steal tax refunds.
In my letter to CMS and DEA, I
expressed deep concern over how these criminals were able to obtain the
Social Security numbers.
These reports are gravely concerning and have impacted the ability of
medical providers in our state to file their tax returns. In addition
to these affected individuals, I am very concerned that many more of
our neighbors may have become targets for tax fraud. New Hampshire
taxpayers deserve to live their lives without fear of tax fraud and
abuse.
With Fire Marshal Degnan
Meeting With NH First Responders
Last week, I had the pleasure of meeting with NH Fire Marshal Bill
Degnan and other firefighters from the Granite State. We discussed the
many ways in which fire departments in New Hampshire are working to
innovate and better protect our communities. We must support our first
responders by ensuring they have the resources and equipment they need
to perform their important duties. That is why I was proud to advocate
for robust funding for the SAFER and AFG grant programs, which provide
assistance to fire departments in New Hampshire and across our country.
With Secretary James and Senator Ayotte
Welcoming the Secretary of the Air Force to NH
Friday morning, I joined Senators Shaheen and Ayotte at Pease Air
National Guard Base to welcome Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee
James to New Hampshire. We had the opportunity to tour the base,
including the KC-135 refueling tanker, before a Wing All Call in the
hangar. Secretary James gave an informative update on her work to
ensure that our Air Force and Air National Guard have what they need to
continue keeping our country safe, and commented on how impressed she
was with the facilities and personnel at Pease. It was wonderful having
her here to see all of the exciting things happening in the Granite
State!
With McKenzie and her painting, Great Horned Owl
Celebrating Talented Artists in the Granite State
Later on Friday, I hosted a reception at the Kimball Jenkins School of
Art in Concord to announce the winner of the 2014 Congressional Art
Competition. I am proud to announce that Peterborough student McKenzie
West has won this year's art competition. McKenzie is a senior at
ConVal High School in Peterborough. Her winning painting, Great Horned
Owl, will be displayed at the U.S. Capitol, and McKenzie has been
invited to attend a reception in Washington, D.C. later this month to
view the display in person. During the reception, I also presented
certificates to other Second District students who participated in the
competition in recognition of their accomplished submissions.
I'm so proud of McKenzie and all the students who took part in this
year's Congressional Art Competition. So much talent, passion, and
creativity shone through each of the pieces of art they submitted for
the competition, and I congratulate all the students for putting in so
much hard work and effort. We must support arts education programs in
schools so we can to continue to encourage the extremely talented,
creative young minds we have here in the Second District.
Helping Granite Staters
Earlier this year, I was contacted by a constituent named Frederick
Prevo from Nashua who needed a copy of his military service record in
order to apply for benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs. My
staff was able to work with theNational Personnel Records Center to
expedite the process and obtain a copy of the necessary records for
Frederick. If my office may ever be of assistance with a problem you
are facing, please contact my staff at 603-226-1002 so we may help you
resolve your problem or get you the information you need.
Have an excellent week and thanks for everything you do to make New
Hampshire such a wonderful place to live!

Working
to
Fight
Tax
Fraud
in
NH
Hi
All!
I
hope
you
all
had
a
great
weekend. I
spent
last
week
fighting
to
protect
medical
professionals
in
New
Hampshire
from
tax
fraud
and
meeting
with
constituents
in
Washington.
Preserving
Cybersecurity
for
Granite
Staters
Following
reports
that
over
140
medical
professionals
in
New
Hampshire
had
been
victims
of
tax
fraud
over
the
last
year,
I
called
on
the
Centers
for
Medicare
and
Medicaid
Services
(CMS)
and
the
Drug
Enforcement
Administration
(DEA)
to
work
with
the
Secret
Service
and
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
to
identify
and
swiftly
remedy
any
vulnerabilities
in
their
cybersecurity
systems.
Criminals
somehow
obtained
the
Social
Security
numbers
of
doctors,
dentists,
and
nurses,
and
used
them
to
falsely
file
tax
returns
in
their
names,
presumably
in
an
attempt
to
steal
tax
refunds.
In
my
letter
to
CMS
and
DEA,
I
expressed
deep
concern
over
how
these
criminals
were
able
to
obtain
the
Social
Security
numbers.
These
reports
are
gravely
concerning
and
have
impacted
the
ability
of
medical
providers
in
our
state
to
file
their
tax
returns. In
addition
to
these
affected
individuals,
I
am
very
concerned
that
many
more
of
our
neighbors
may
have
become
targets
for
tax
fraud.
New
Hampshire
taxpayers
deserve
to
live
their
lives
without
fear
of
tax
fraud
and
abuse.

Last

I
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
with
NH
Fire
Marshal
Bill

and
other

from
the
Granite

discussed
the

for
the
SAFER
and
AFG
grant
programs,
which
provide

to
fire

in

Friday
morning,
I
joined
Senators
Shaheen
and

and
commented
on
how
impressed
she
was
with
the
facilities
and
personnel
at
Pease. It
was
wonderful
having
her
here
to
see
all
of
the
exciting
things
happening
in
the
Granite
State!
With
McKenzie
and
her

Later
on
Friday,
I
hosted
a
reception
at
the
Kimball
Jenkins
School
of
Art
in
Concord
to
announce
the
winner
of
the
2014
Congressional
Art
Competition.
I
am
proud
to
announce
that
Peterborough
student
McKenzie
West
has
won
this
year&#8217;s
art
competition. McKenzie
is
a
senior
at
ConVal
High
School
in
Peterborough.
Her
winning
painting,
Great
Horned
Owl,
will
be
displayed
at
the
U.S.
Capitol,
and
McKenzie
has
been
invited
to
attend
a
reception
in
Washington,
D.C.
later
this
month
to
view
the
display
in
person.
During
the
reception,
I
also
presented
certificates
to
other
Second
District
students
who
participated
in
the
competition
in
recognition
of
their
accomplished
submissions.
I&#8217;m
so
proud
of
McKenzie
and
all
the
students
who
took
part
in
this
year&#8217;s
Congressional
Art
Competition. So
much
talent,
passion,
and
creativity
shone
through
each
of
the
pieces
of
art
they
submitted
for
the
competition,
and
I
congratulate
all
the
students
for
putting
in
so
much
hard
work
and
effort.
We
must
support
arts
education
programs
in
schools
so
we
can
to
continue
to
encourage
the
extremely
talented,
creative
young
minds
we
have
here
in
the
Second
District.

I
