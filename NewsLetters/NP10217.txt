Dear David,
I wanted to take a moment to give you a brief update on what I've been
up to these past couple of weeks in Arkansas. Between newsletters, don't
forget to follow me on Twitter
or like my Facebook
page for daily updates! As always, please do not
hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns, or simply
want to express your opinion. I'm always happy to hear from you.
Sincerely,
Fountain Lake High School Visit
Last week, I visited 9th grade students at Fountain Lake High School in
Hot Springs to talk about financial literacy
. We a great discussion about
responsible personal finance practices. We also talked about our
out-of-control national debt and how financial literacy plays a roll in
our national budgeting practices.
Rep. Tom Cotton discusses financial literacy at Fountain Lake High
School in Hot Springs
One student asked: who holds the majority of our national debt and will
we ever pay it off? For those of you who are also curious, I wanted to
take a moment to answer that question here in the newsletter.
While China is the largest foreign holder of our national debt, the
largest share of outstanding debt lies in the savings and retirement
accounts of hardworking Arkansans and taxpayers across the country.
Unfortunately, the larger our debt in relation to the size of our
economy, the higher the risk that global financial markets will lose
faith in our ability to fulfill our obligations, which could lead to a
serious fiscal crisis. However, I'm confident that if we limit spending
increases and start practicing some real fiscal restraint in Washington
our national debt will shrink in proportion to our economic output. It's
going to take hard work to change the Washington "spend more" culture,
but I know we can do it.
Spotlight: The Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation (SAVE) Act
Human trafficking generates $9.5 billion yearly in the United States
and an estimated 300,000 children are at risk of becoming victims.
Unfortunately, the Internet has opened a new avenue for human
trafficking in the United States as traffickers are increasingly
turning to online classified websites to advertise their victims.
Rep. Tom Cotton tours the new St. Vincent Hospital in Hot Springs
That is why I sponsored the Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation
(SAVE) Act with my colleague Congresswoman Ann Wagner (MO-02),
legislation that would close Internet marketplaces that host
advertisements for the commercial exploitation of minors. Specifically,
it makes it a federal crime for certain web sites to knowingly
distribute advertising that offers a commercial sex act with minors,
which will allow prosecutors to charge the web sites that facilitate
such abhorrent activity.
St. Vincent Hot Springs Hospital Visit
Recently, I also visited the new St. Vincent Hospital in Hot Springs.
St. Vincent employs 2,000 people and provides high quality care to the
Hot Springs Community I spent the morning touring the facility, meeting
employees, and learning more about the hospital's operations. Be sure
to click here
for additional
photos from my tour. Thank you to St. Vincent for a wonderful visit and
for all you do for Arkansas.
Healthcare Town Hall
Last week, I spent an afternoon in Waldron discussing Obamacare.
Arkansans are rightly concerned about this law and the impact it will
have on their healthcare. I gave a brief legislative update on numerous
measures I've voted for to protect Arkansans from the worst effects of
Obamacare including the Save American Workers Act
and the No Taxpayer Funding For Abortion
Act
. I also answered several individual
questions about this unworkable law. I plan to hold several more
healthcare town halls around Arkansas in the coming months. Please be
sure to check the events section of my website
for more information.

Fighting Back Against Obamacare: Amicus Brief in Support of Obamacare
Lawsuit
Earlier this year, Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson filed a lawsuit
against the federal government over the Obama administration's special
treatment of Congress and its staff under Obamacare. As you may know,
Members of Congress and their staffs received preferential treatment
and were provided with unlawful subsidies for their health insurance. I
sponsored several bills to prevent this special treatment, including
the No Special Deal for D.C. Insiders Act
.
This week, I joined 38 of my colleagues in supporting Senator Johnson's
efforts by filing an amicus brief with the court. The brief says, in
part, that the Obama Administration's unlawful actions are part of an
ongoing campaign by the Executive Branch to rewrite the Affordable Care
Act ('ACA') on a wholesale basis. If left unchecked, that campaign
threatens to subvert the most basic precept of our system of
government: The President of the United States is constitutionally
obligated to take care that the law be faithfully executed; he does not
have the power to modify or ignore laws that have been duly enacted by
Congress and that he believes are constitutional." I look forward to
the court's decision on this important case.
Coffee with your Congressman
I enjoyed spending time in both Nashville and Rison for Coffee with
your Congressman. I always appreciate the opportunity to visit with
Arkansans one on one and hear your concerns. I heard lots of questions
about Obamacare, foreign policy, entitlement abuse, and our national
debt. There was a great turnout at both events, including Nashville
Mayor Billy Ray Jones. Please continue to check the events section of
my website for information about upcoming Coffee with your Congressman
events!

which
could
lead
to
a
serious
fiscal
crisis.
However,
I&#8217;m
confident
that
if
we

increases
and
start
practicing
some
real
fiscal
restraint
in
Washington
our
national
debt
will
shrink
in

It&#8217;s
going

take
hard

to
change

but
I

we
can
do
it.

Fighting
Back
Against
Obamacare:
Amicus
Brief
in
Support
of
Obamacare
Lawsuit
Earlier
this
year,
Wisconsin
Senator
Ron
Johnson
filed
a
lawsuit
against
the
federal
government
over
the
Obama
administration&#8217;s
special
treatment
of
Congress
and
its
staff
under
Obamacare.
As
you
may
know,
Members
of
Congress
and
their
staffs
received
preferential
treatment
and
were
provided
with
unlawful
subsidies
for
their
health
insurance.
I
sponsored
several
bills
to
prevent
this
special
treatment,
including
the
No
Special
Deal
for
D.C.
Insiders
Act .
This week,
I
joined
38
of
my
colleagues
in
supporting
Senator
Johnson&#8217;s
efforts
by
filing
an
amicus
brief
with
the
court.
The
brief
says,
in
part,
that
the
Obama
Administration&#8217;s
unlawful
actions
are
part
of
an
ongoing
campaign
by
the
Executive
Branch
to
rewrite
the
Affordable
Care
Act
('ACA')
on
a
wholesale
basis.
If
left
unchecked,
that
campaign
threatens
to
subvert
the
most
basic
precept
of
our
system
of
government:
The
President
of
the
United
States
is
constitutionally
obligated
to
take
care
that
the
law
be
faithfully
executed;
he
does
not
have
the
power
to
modify
or
ignore
laws
that
have
been
duly
enacted
by
Congress
and
that
he
believes
are
constitutional."
I
look
forward
to
the
court&#8217;s
decision
on
this
important
case.
