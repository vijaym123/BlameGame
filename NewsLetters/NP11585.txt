Dear friends,
I'm happy to report some good news out of Central New York and
Washington.
Back home last weekend, I awarded a Purple Heart medal to World War II
veteran Staff Sergeant Richard Faulkner of Auburn. His story is
exceptional, and it was an honor to present him with his long overdue
and much-deserved Purple Heart.
Mr. Faulkner joined the Army Air Corps at the age of 18 and faced
combat bravely as a ball turret gunner. After his plane crashed over
France on March 18, 1944 during World War II, he spent 29 days behind
enemy lines evading German Gestapos before reaching friendly forces.
When he was offered a Purple Heart medal initially, Mr. Faulkner turned
it down out of humility and respect for his fallen comrades.
After his daughter-in-law contacted our office asking for help
obtaining the Purple Heart medal for Mr. Faulkner, my staff and I
worked with the Department of Defense to secure it. It was with great
pride and sincerity that I awarded it to him at his home in Auburn
nearly 70 years after he was injured in combat, and I was thankful to
join his family and friends to recognize his selfless service to our
nation.
You can check out the CBS Evening News story on Mr. Faulkner here

The House is in session this week, and on Monday I introduced the Job
and Opportunity Bonus (JOB) Tax Credit Act, which will help address the
immediate need of employers in Central New York who are facing the
"skills gap"-the gap between the labor force available for hire and the
labor force they need. This bill, which was a recommendation included
in my jobs plan and education plan, creates a temporary tax credit for
employers to use to help pay for the cost of training their employees.
Employers across Central New York have told me time and again that it
is difficult to find workers with the training necessary to perform the
highly-skilled jobs available. So many of our local businesses want to
invest in training for current and new employees, but don't have the
resources to do it. My bill helps address this issue by providing a tax
credit for worker training programs. The JOB Tax Credit Act is a
win-win for employers and workers - it will grow our local economy by
helping businesses train and keep highly-skilled workers in Central New
York and will give workers the tools they need to compete in today's
job market.
You can read more about the bill here
.
I encourage you to contact my office to share your thoughts and
concerns. As always, it is an honor to represent you in the U.S. House
of Representatives.
Sincerely,
Member of Congress

Dear
friends,
I&#8217;m
happy
to
report
some
good
news
out
of
Central
New
York
and
Washington.
Back
home
last
weekend,
I
awarded
a
Purple
Heart
medal
to
World
War
II
veteran
Staff
Sergeant
Richard
Faulkner
of
Auburn.
His
story
is
exceptional,
and
it
was
an
honor
to
present
him
with
his
long

and
much-deserved

Mr.

joined
the
Army
Air

at
the
age
of
18
and
faced
combat
bravely
as
a
ball
turret
gunner.
After
his
plane
crashed
over
France
on
March
18,
1944
during
World

he
spent
29

When

Mr.

The
House
is
in

this

and
on
Monday
I
introduced
the
Job

which
will
help

the
immediate
need
of
employers
in
Central

who
are
facing
the

gap&#8221; &#8211; the
gap
between
the
labor
force
available
for
hire
and
the
labor
force
they
need.
This
bill,
which
was
a
recommendation
included
in
my
jobs

and

plan,
creates
a
temporary
tax
credit
for
employers
to
use
to
help

for
the
cost
of
training
their
employees.
Employers
across
Central
New
York
have
told
me
time
and
again
that
it
is
difficult
to
find
workers
with
the
training
necessary
to
perform
the
highly-skilled
jobs
available.
So
many
of
our
local
businesses
want
to
invest
in
training
for
current
and
new
employees,
but
don&#8217;t
have
the
resources
to
do
it.
My
bill
helps
address
this
issue
by
providing
a
tax
credit
for
worker
training
programs.
The
JOB
Tax
Credit
Act
is
a
win-win
for
employers
and
workers
&#8211;
it will
grow
our
local
economy
by
helping
businesses
train
and
keep
highly-skilled
workers
in
Central
New
York
and
will
give
workers
the
tools
they
need
to
compete
in
today&#8217;s
job
market.
You

more
about
the
bill
here .
I
encourage
you
to
contact
my
office
to
share
your
thoughts
and
concerns.
As
always,
it
is
an
honor
to
represent
you
in
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives.
Sincerely,
Member
of
Congress
