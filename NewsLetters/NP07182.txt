Barack Obama is now the first President in American history to face a lawsuit from the House of Representatives.
It&rsquo;s a brazen attempt by House Republicans to block us from making progress.
Barack, You, and I have already accomplished so much together for the American people. Over these last six years, we&rsquo;ve expanded quality health care to millions, promoted equal rights for all Americans, and put the middle class first.
And now, the Republicans are suing us. It's outrageous. BUT -- with Republican outside groups outspending us 2-to-1 right now -- we simply don&rsquo;t yet have the resources we need to fight back in this election.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking for your help. It&rsquo;s pretty simple: either we hit this 50,000 donation goal before the mid-month deadline, or we risk handing even more power to the Republican obstructionists. Can I count on you to chip in today? All Gifts Today Triple-Matched! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
If this just came down to who had the best ideas, Democrats would win -- hands down. And the Republicans know that. That&rsquo;s why they're spending millions to muddy the waters.
We need to fight back and make sure voters have the facts. That's how we win, but we can&rsquo;t do it without your help: http://dccc.org/Chip-In
