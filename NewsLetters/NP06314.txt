I&rsquo;m not Nate Silver.
So if you&rsquo;re wondering who will control Congress after the November election, I&rsquo;m the wrong person to ask.
But here&rsquo;s what I do know:
-- Republicans in the House are attempting to win their largest majority in 60 years.
-- Thanks to
Citizens United , the GOP&rsquo;s wealthy backers are outspending us 2-to-1. -- There are just 52 days until Election Day.
If the GOP gains ground this year, Congress could pass huge tax cuts for the wealthy and for big corporations, while leaving the middle class out in the cold. Americans need to know that Republicans aren&rsquo;t fighting for them -- they&rsquo;re fighting against them.
That&rsquo;s why your help is needed. The biggest fundraising deadline of the year is just days away.
