Friend,
I wanted to send you a quick email wishing you and your family a happy New Year.
The last year has been filled with countless blessings, and I have you to thank for many of them. Your support throughout the years has been the cornerstone of our efforts, and all we have accomplished would not have been possible without you.
It is my hope that 2015 will be a year of change- a time for us to get more people back to work with good paying jobs, ensure college is affordable for everyone, and rise above the partisan gridlock to move our country forward.
I have no doubt that many of my colleagues share the same sentiments, and I look forward to working with them in the months to come.
Thank you again for the faith you have placed in me. I hope you have a wonderful, joyful and safe New Year.
Be well,
Ami
