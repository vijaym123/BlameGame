Dear
Friend,
Recent decades have seen positive steps being taken to
harness the Third Districts industrious past, in order to revitalize
the regions mill cities. Just last month, the City of Lawrence
launched the Lawrence Partnership,
an important
initiative and coalition of public and private organizations which
will work towards the revitalization of Lawrence. Read more about this
project in this edition of
Congress in your
Inbox.
On December 4, the House of Representatives passed the FY 2015
National Defense Authorization Act, which authorizes funding and sets policy
for the Department of Defense. The bill, which contains over a dozen
provisions I authored, will now move to the Senate.
Below you will find more information about the NDAA
and my statement
regarding its benefits and its shortcomings.
Also in
this edition, you will find video and news clippings about a recent
hearing I held to examine the
Pentagons 1033 program , which provides military equipment to local police
forces. There is also information about
World AIDS
Day, the rise of student loans
and the recent actions taken by the
President on
immigration .
As
always, I look forward to your feedback via my website, or on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
I
hope you and yours had a wonderful Thanksgiving and are gearing up
for a happy and healthy holiday season. Thank you for staying engaged
and enjoy this week's edition of
Congress in your
Inbox.
Sincerely,
Niki
Tsongas
