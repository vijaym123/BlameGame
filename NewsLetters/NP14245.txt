Dear Friend,
Today I join Americans across the nation in honoring and
paying tribute to the men and women of the United States Armed
Forces, past and present.
From the bottom of my heart, I say thank
you to all of our veterans for their service and the sacrifices they
made in the name of freedom and democracy.
This morning I had
the honor of participating in the annual City of Sacramento Veterans
Day Parade.
It was a great opportunity to thank the many
veterans and service men and women we have right here in the Sacramento
region.
During this years celebration, we honored a true American
hero, Master Sergeant George Hudson, Jr., an original member of the
famed Tuskegee Airmen.
Master Sergeant Hudson fought unparalleled
odds, including segregation, to serve our great nation and we cannot
thank men and women like him enough for their honorable
service.
After fighting for our nation overseas, no
veteran should have to fight for the tools they need to be successful here
at home.
We must ensure no veteran is left behind.
This
includes speedy claims, top-notch health care, counseling services,
housing and educational and job opportunities.
These are promises we
made to them, and they are bonds between a grateful nation and its
soldiers that must be fulfilled.
Last week, I joined student
veterans at Sacramento State for a discussion on the challenges they
face as student veterans and to promote the fantastic services offered
by the university at their Veterans Success Center.
The veterans
I met talked about the importance of a support system when
transitioning to civilian life.
I heard about how critical educational
benefits are in supporting themselves, their career development and their
families.
In recent years Congress has increased
funding for the VA, raised soldier pay, and passed the New GI Bill of
Rights for the 21 st
Century which increases education benefits
for our nations veterans, such as those I met at Sacramento
State.
These are all critical steps, but there is far more work to be
done.
I am committed to continuing to advocate for our troops and
our veterans in the years to come.
If you are a member of
our Armed Forces, or an honored veteran, and need help navigating your
benefits, have health care questions or are struggling to find
employment or housing assistance, please dont hesitate to reach out to my
office at (916) 498-5600.
I hope you and your loved ones have
a wonderful Veterans Day.
And again, thank you to all of our
veterans and the men and women who currently wear the uniform.
We
are honored by your service.
Sincerely,
DORIS O. MATSUI
Member of
Congress
