Monday, March 31 is the deadline to enroll in a quality health plan under the Affordable Care Act ... See Important info below for weekend signups!
Time is running out to enroll in a health care plan if you and your family do not have health coverage. The deadline is Monday March 31
five short days from now. If you and your family need one-on-one assistance to review the options, there are many opportunities in Tampa Bay from Friday, March 28, through the weekend to Monday, March 31.
Affordable health care options have been a godsend for Floridians -- many of whom were barred from coverage before the law or had no affordable option. Did you know that Florida leads the nation in the number of people signing up in the federal marketplace? More than 400,000 Floridians have a new plan - and nearly 90 percent have received financial help from
new tax credits
that makes health insurance even more affordable for our middle-class families.
Ask family and friends to make sure they are covered!
If not , come prepared with the
required documents/information
