Feb. 9-Ft. Riley Listening Session
Next Monday, the U.S. Army will hold a "Fort Riley Listening Session"
for members of the Junction City community and Flint Hills region to
express their support for Fort Riley in light of yet another budget
from President Obama that puts the future of our military at risk.
Despite an increasingly dangerous world with growing demands on the
service members and military families who call Kansas home, Department
of Defense resources to protect our country and its citizens are
dwindling. Today, the U.S. Army faces force reductions that could
create unmanageable risk in training and readiness.
As a Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Member, I determine how
the Department of Defense prioritizes its resources during the
appropriations process. For example, I will have the opportunity to
make the case for Kansas installations when I meet with Army Force
Management Director Brigadier General Cloutier and others visiting from
Army Headquarters in Washington prior to the listening session. I am
hopeful we will have a productive conversation about the future of the
Big Red One.
Kansans could not be more proud of the service members and their
families who sacrifice so we are able to live in the strongest, freest
nation in the world. The listening session next week at Fort Riley will
give citizens and local leaders the opportunity to share how
instrumental Fort Riley is to the community in areas like education,
partnerships and construction investments on base. I encourage you to
attend the Fort Riley Listening Session on February 9, 2015, from
3:30-5:30 p.m. at the Geary County Convention Center.

Kansas Common Sense
February 2, 2015
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thank you for your continued interest
in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
Celebrating Kansas' 154th Birthday
On Thursday, we celebrated Kansas Day. The story of Kansas is one of
farmers, factory workers, teachers, parents and all the unsung heroes
who work hard every day to improve our communities and state for the
next generation. These Kansans share the spirit of the pioneers who
settled our state and tamed the West 154 years ago under the tenets of
freedom and individual responsibility. This is the same legacy we want
to leave behind for our children and grandchildren. Bright days lie
ahead for Kansas and I will do all I can to make certain we leave
behind a stronger, freer and more prosperous place to call home. May
God bless the great state of Kansas. Click here
to watch a slideshow of photos I've taken
during my travels around our state.
Kansas Now Represented on Powerful Senate Appropriations Defense
Subcommittee
I was honored to be selected by the U.S. Senate Committee on
Appropriations to serve as a Defense Appropriations Subcommittee (SACD)
Member for the 114th Congress. The SACD Subcommittee allocates defense
spending for the entire Department of Defense - including the Armed
Services, military facilities and sustainment, research, and matters
related to the health and well-being of our service members. The
primary reason I sought a seat on this subcommittee was to support
Kansas military installations and give a strong voice to those who
serve our country including the soldiers of Fort Riley and Fort
Leavenworth, airmen of McConnell Air Force Base and Forbes Field, and
Kansans in the National Guard and Reserve.
In recent years, President Obama's defense spending cuts and
sequestration put the future of our Armed Forces in jeopardy. In order
to protect Kansas installations and our state's contributions to
defense systems, we could not afford to not have a Kansan on this
subcommittee. I look forward to overseeing Department of Defense
funding and the opportunity to meet with military and defense officials
on behalf of Kansas service members and their families. I recently met
with Secretary of the Army John McHugh and Army Chief of Staff General
Ray Odierno to discuss the future of the Army and the value provided by
Kansas military installations. As looming sequestration cuts continue
to shape the annual budget of the military, it is necessary that
Kansans have an advocate with a direct connection overseeing the
Department. Military bases and the surrounding communities will be
paying close attention to this year's budget, and I look forward
actively protecting and fighting for Kansas interests.
Our nation's defense and those who serve must be equipped to safeguard
Americans from terrorists who attempt to destroy and attack our way of
life. Their selfless efforts to defend the freedoms we hold dear
combined with the aerospace and critical defense assets produced in
Kansas make our state invaluable to America's national security.
Kansans could not be more proud of the service members and their
families who sacrifice so we are able to live in the strongest, freest
nation in the world. Protecting Kansas' military installations and the
communities that support them is my priority.
Senate Approves Keystone XL Pipeline
On Thursday afternoon, the U.S. Senate passed S.1, a resolution to
approve construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, by a vote of 62 to
36. The new Senate Majority has shown in just a few short weeks what
can be accomplished when the United States Senate returns to its roots
of regular order, allows open debate on good ideas, and allows for a
fair amendment process. While this vote to approve the Keystone XL
Pipeline should have happened years ago, I am pleased the Senate has
finally been given the opportunity to take bipartisan action on an
issue of such importance to American job-creation and energy
independence. When this legislation reaches President Obama's desk, he
will finally be forced to decide whether increases in energy security
and American jobs trump special interest politics.
There is overwhelming support for construction of the Keystone XL
Pipeline across the country because Americans understand the importance
of this shovel-ready project to job creation and increasing the supply
of North American energy. The Senate has listened to Americans and
taken action. This is merely the first of many issues to finally
receive the Senate's attention in the new Congress after years of being
denied votes.
Senate Votes on Lesser Prairie Chicken Amendment
An amendment I offered to remove the lesser prairie chicken from the
threatened species list under the Endangered Species Act was considered
by the Senate this week. While a bipartisan majority of Senators
supported my efforts by a vote of 54 to 44, the amendment failed to
clear the 60-vote threshold needed for adoption as an amendment to S.1 -
the Keystone XL pipeline legislation. However, I was able to take the
opportunity to educate my colleagues in both a floor speech and
personal conversations about the importance of this issue to Kansans.
As I told my colleagues, the listing was based off artificially low
population estimates due to the prolonged, historic drought that we
experienced. In fact, the last aerial survey showed a 20 percent
increase in the lesser prairie chicken's population due to normalizing
rain and snowfall levels.
Listing the bird as a threatened species is not the answer - what we
need is more rainfall, not more regulation. I am confident there are
ways to conserve the species without hindering economic development in
rural communities, and I will continue to push for this
straightforward, simple solution. It is time to give Kansas and other
states like Colorado, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Texas the opportunity to
improve habitats and reduce the economic damage that's already being
done by the listing.
Holding Corrupt VA Senior Executives Accountable
As a Member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I led the
introduction on Wednesday of the Increasing VA Accountability to
Veterans Act of 2015, legislation to give the Secretary of Veterans
Affairs (VA) more authority to hold corrupt executives accountable for
their actions. This legislation - cosponsored by Senator Kelly Ayotte
of New Hampshire, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Senator John
McCain of Arizona - would give the VA secretary authority to reduce the
pensions of executives convicted of a crime, limit the amount of time
VA senior executive service (SES) employees can spend on paid
administrative leave, and help end VA's sordid bonus culture by
reforming the Department's performance appraisal system for senior
executives.
Despite the passage of the Choice Act last year, the VA is still not
doing enough to hold those responsible accountable for their corrupt
behavior when treating our nation's veterans. The Choice Act, which was
signed into law in August 2014, contained civil service reforms that
gave the VA Secretary the authority to fire senior executives based on
misconduct or incompetency. Still, not a single VA senior executive has
been fired for wait time manipulation. Instead, corrupt VA employees
have been placed on paid administrative leave for several months.
The television cameras may have turned their focus elsewhere, but we
will not. This legislation will help make certain VA senior executives
found guilty of crimes that put veterans' lives at risk are held
accountable. Our veterans deserve the best our nation has to offer. We
cannot allow a system that rewards mediocrity and failure to remain
intact. Click here
to learn more about the specific provisions
of the Increasing VA Accountability to Veterans Act of 2015.
Senate Continues Work on Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2015
My colleagues on the Senate Banking Committee and I met this week to
continue our work on legislation regarding U.S. economic sanctions on
Iran. A large bipartisan majority of the Committee voted to support the
legislation that affirms U.S. policy that Iran must not be allowed to
develop nuclear weapons capability. Nuclear weapons are not an
ingredient in any possible recipe for peace in the Middle East. It is
critical that we reduce the threat of a belligerent or nuclear capable
Iran - falling short of this goal carries risks the world cannot afford
to take. This legislation, the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2015,
would reapply suspended sanctions if current talks fail to result in an
agreement by the summer deadline. The bill will receive the attention
of the full Senate in the coming weeks.
The Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act
This week, I joined Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona and a bipartisan
group of colleagues in introducing The Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act,
which would end travel restrictions to Cuba and remove restrictions on
banking transactions resulting from travel to Cuba. Only 90 miles from
Florida, Cuba is the only country in the world to which Americans are
forbidden from traveling. Lifting these restrictions provides Kansans
and all Americans greater freedom, but I believe this bill will work to
improve the lives of 11 million Cubans living under the repressive
Castro regime. Allowing U.S. citizens to travel to Cuba will advance
freedom and liberty by further exposing Cubans to democratic thought
and free market principles. As the standard of living among Cubans
increases, they will be enabled to make greater demands on their own
government to increase individual and political rights. I hope the
Senate considers legislation in the near future.Click here
to learn more about our legislation.
Introducing the PARTS Act to Preserve Rural Therapy Care
On Tuesday, I introduced S. 257, the Protecting Access to Rural Therapy
Services (PARTS) Act. This bipartisan legislation would make certain
rural and other patients have access to a full range of outpatient
therapeutic services in hospitals in their own communities. S. 257 is
an updated version of the PARTS Act I introduced last Congress as S.
1143.
"Outpatient therapeutic services" include services such as pulmonary
rehabilitation, certain behavior health assessments and counseling,
demonstration/evaluating the use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and
certain casting/splinting procedures. Hospital outpatient therapeutic
services have always been administered by licensed, skilled
professionals under the overall direction of a physician. However, in
2009 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) abruptly
shifted policy to require that outpatient therapeutic services must be
furnished under the "direct supervision" of a physician who is required
to be physically present in the department at all times that Medicare
beneficiaries receives these services. While the need for this level of
supervision is recognized for certain high risk, complex outpatient
services, CMS' policy often applies to even low risk services, such as
some medication injections and minor wound debridement. For many years,
these procedures have been safely administered in hospital outpatient
departments under "general supervision," a standard that permits
services to be furnished under the general oversight and control of a
supervising practitioner without requiring his or her physical
presence. In fact, in December 2014 President Obama signed into law
H.R. 4067 - legislation I originally introduced last year that was
unanimously passed by Congress - that suspended enforcement of these
burdensome regulations on Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) and other
small rural hospitals in 2014.
Rural hospitals need reasonable flexibility to appropriately staff
their facilities so they can provide a full range of services to their
communities. Many hospitals find CMS' direct supervision requirements
impossible to meet, which jeopardizes access to this important care.
The PARTS Act would preserve patient safety and oversight while easing
unreasonable supervision requirements for therapy care. This bill is
crafted to make certain federal regulations reflect the realities of
rural health care and address this issue on a permanent basis. Click

Visiting with Tabor College President Jules Glanzer
Also this week, I met with Tabor College President Dr. Jules Glanzer to
visit about the latest developments in Hillsboro and at Tabor. Dr.
Glanzer was in Washington, D.C. for a meeting of the Council for
Christian Colleges & Universities. He provided me with an update on
Tabor's efforts to offer the best equipment and facilities for students
to learn and thrive, and pursue the college's mission of preparing
individuals for a life of learning, work, and service for Christ and
His kingdom.
We discussed Tabor's Signature Campaign - the largest fundraising
project in the history of the college - to build a campus home for the
fine arts. In a few years, Tabor is planning to open the new Shari
Flaming Center for the Arts. This facility will include a comprehensive
fine arts performance venue and worship center, a stage for the music
and drama programs, a studio theater, and recital hall and gallery
space for the visual arts. Tabor alumni and friends have donated nearly
$13 million of the $16.2 million total of the Signature Campaign goal.
This is a great example of a Kansas college and its community working
together to help shape the lives current and future students for
generations to come. I appreciate Dr. Glanzer taking time while he was
in Washington to update me on this project.

Fort
Riley
and
Fort
Leavenworth,
airmen
of
McConnell
Air
Force
Base
and
Forbes
Field,
and
Kansans
in
the
National
Guard
and
Reserve.
In
recent
years,
President
Obama's
defense
spending
cuts
and
sequestration
put
the
future
of
our
Armed
Forces
in
jeopardy.
In
order
to
protect
Kansas
installations
and
our
state's
contributions
to
defense
systems,
we
could
not
afford
to
not
have
a
Kansan
on
this
subcommittee.
I
look
forward
to
overseeing
Department
of
Defense
funding
and
the
opportunity
to
meet
with
military
and
defense
officials
on
behalf
of
Kansas
service
members
and
their
families.
I
recently
met
with
Secretary
of
the
Army
John
McHugh
and
Army
Chief
of
Staff
General
Ray
Odierno
to
discuss
the
future
of
the
Army
and
the
value
provided
by
Kansas
military
installations.
As
looming
sequestration
cuts
continue
to
shape
the
annual
budget
of
the
military,
it
is
necessary
that
Kansans
have
an
advocate
with
a
direct
connection
overseeing
the
Department. Military
bases
and
the
surrounding
communities
will
be
paying
close
attention
to
this
year's
budget,
and
I
look
forward
actively
protecting
and
fighting
for
Kansas
interests.
Our
nation's
defense
and
those
who
serve
must
be
equipped
to
safeguard
Americans
from
terrorists
who
attempt
to
destroy
and
attack
our
way
of
life.
Their
selfless
efforts
to
defend
the
freedoms
we
hold
dear
combined
with
the
aerospace
and
critical
defense
assets
produced
in
Kansas
make
our
state
invaluable
to
America's
national
security.
Kansans
could
not
be
more
proud
of
the
service
members
and
their
families
who
sacrifice
so
we
are
able
to
live
in
the
strongest,
freest
nation
in
the
world. Protecting
Kansas'
military
installations
and
the
communities
that
support
them
is
my
priority.
Senate
Approves
Keystone
XL
Pipeline
On
Thursday
afternoon,
the
U.S.
Senate
passed
S.1,
a
resolution
to
approve
construction
of
the
Keystone
XL
Pipeline,
by
a
vote
of
62
to
36.
The
new
Senate
Majority
has
shown
in
just
a
few
short
weeks
what
can
be
accomplished
when
the
United
States
Senate
returns
to
its
roots
of
regular
order,
allows
open
debate
on
good
ideas,
and
allows
for
a
fair
amendment
process.
While
this
vote
to
approve
the
Keystone
XL
Pipeline
should
have
happened
years
ago,
I
am
pleased
the
Senate
has
finally
been
given
the
opportunity
to
take
bipartisan
action
on
an
issue
of
such
importance
to
American
job-creation
and
energy
independence.
When
this
legislation
reaches
President
Obama's
desk,
he
will
finally
be
forced
to
decide
whether
increases
in
energy
security
and
American
jobs
trump
special
interest
politics.
There
is
overwhelming
support
for
construction
of
the
Keystone
XL
Pipeline
across
the
country
because
Americans
understand
the
importance
of
this
shovel-ready
project
to
job
creation
and
increasing
the
supply
of
North
American
energy.
The
Senate
has
listened
to
Americans
and
taken
action.
This
is
merely
the
first
of
many
issues
to
finally
receive
the
Senate's
attention
in
the
new
Congress
after
years
of
being
denied
votes.
Senate
Votes
on
Lesser
Prairie
Chicken
Amendmen t
An
amendment
I
offered
to
remove
the
lesser
prairie
chicken
from
the
threatened
species
list
under
the
Endangered
Species
Act
was
considered
by
the
Senate
this
week.
While
a
bipartisan
majority
of
Senators
supported
my
efforts
by
a
vote
of
54
to
44,
the
amendment
failed
to
clear
the
60-vote
threshold
needed
for
adoption
as
an
amendment
to
S.1
&ndash;
the
Keystone
XL
pipeline
legislation.
However,
I
was
able
to
take
the
opportunity
to
educate
my
colleagues
in
both
a
floor
speech
and
personal
conversations
about
the
importance
of
this
issue
to
Kansans.
As
I
told
my
colleagues,
the
listing
was
based
off
artificially
low
population
estimates
due
to
the
prolonged,
historic
drought
that
we
experienced.
In
fact,
the
last
aerial
survey
showed
a
20
percent
increase
in
the
lesser
prairie
chicken's
population
due
to
normalizing
rain
and
snowfall
levels.
Listing
the
bird
as
a
threatened
species
is
not
the
answer
&ndash;
what
we
need
is
more
rainfall,
not
more
regulation.
I
am
confident
there
are
ways
to
conserve
the
species
without
hindering
economic
development
in
rural
communities,
and
I
will
continue
to
push
for
this
straightforward,
simple solution.
It
is
time
to give
Kansas
and
other
states
like
Colorado,
Oklahoma,
New
Mexico and
Texas
the opportunity
to
improve habitats
and
reduce
the
economic damage
that's
already
being
done
by
the
listing.
Holding
Corrupt
VA
Senior
Executives
Accountable
As
a
Member
of
the
Senate
Veterans'
Affairs
Committee,
I
led
the
introduction
on
Wednesday
of
the
Increasing
VA
Accountability
to
Veterans
Act
of
2015 ,
legislation
to
give
the
Secretary
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
more
authority
to
hold
corrupt
executives
accountable
for
their
actions.
This
legislation
&ndash;
cosponsored
by
Senator
Kelly
Ayotte
of
New
Hampshire,
Senator
Marco
Rubio
of
Florida
and
Senator
John
McCain
of
Arizona
&ndash;
would
give
the
VA
secretary
authority
to
reduce
the
pensions
of
executives
convicted
of
a
crime,
limit
the
amount
of
time
VA
senior
executive
service
(SES)
employees
can
spend
on
paid
administrative
leave,
and
help
end
VA's
sordid
bonus
culture
by
reforming
the
Department's
performance
appraisal
system
for
senior
executives.
Despite
the
passage
of
the
Choice
Act
last
year,
the
VA
is
still
not
doing
enough
to
hold
those
responsible
accountable
for
their
corrupt
behavior
when
treating
our
nation's
veterans.
The
Choice
Act,
which
was
signed
into
law
in
August
2014,
contained
civil
service
reforms
that
gave
the
VA
Secretary
the
authority
to
fire
senior
executives
based
on
misconduct
or
incompetency.
Still,
not
a
single
VA
senior
executive
has
been
fired
for
wait
time
manipulation.
Instead,
corrupt
VA
employees
have
been
placed
on
paid
administrative
leave
for
several
months.
The
television
cameras
may
have
turned
their
focus
elsewhere,
but
we
will
not.
This
legislation
will
help
make
certain
VA
senior
executives
found
guilty
of
crimes
that
put
veterans'
lives
at
risk
are
held
accountable.
Our
veterans
deserve
the
best
our
nation
has
to
offer.
We
cannot
allow
a
system
that
rewards
mediocrity
and
failure
to
remain
intact.

Senate
Continues
Work
on
Nuclear
Weapon
Free
Iran
Act
of
2015
My
colleagues
on
the
Senate
Banking
Committee
and
I
met
this
week
to
continue
our
work
on
legislation
regarding
U.S.
economic
sanctions
on
Iran.
A
large
bipartisan
majority
of
the
Committee
voted
to
support
the
legislation
that
affirms
U.S.
policy
that
Iran
must
not
be
allowed
to
develop
nuclear
weapons
capability.
Nuclear
weapons
are
not
an
ingredient
in
any
possible
recipe
for
peace
in
the
Middle
East.
It
is
critical
that
we
reduce
the
threat
of
a
belligerent
or
nuclear
capable
Iran
&mdash;
falling
short
of
this
goal
carries
risks
the
world
cannot
afford
to
take.
This
legislation,
the
Nuclear
Weapon
Free
Iran
Act
of
2015,
would
reapply
suspended
sanctions
if
current
talks
fail
to
result
in
an
agreement
by
the
summer
deadline.
The
bill
will
receive
the
attention
of
the
full
Senate
in
the
coming
weeks.
The
Freedom
to
Travel
to
Cuba
Act
This
week,
I
joined
Senator
Jeff
Flake
of
Arizona
and
a
bipartisan
group
of
colleagues
in
introducing
The
Freedom
to
Travel
to
Cuba
Act ,
which
would
end
travel
restrictions
to
Cuba
and
remove
restrictions
on
banking
transactions
resulting
from
travel
to
Cuba.
Only
90
miles
from
Florida,
Cuba
is
the
only
country
in
the
world
to
which
Americans
are
forbidden
from
traveling.
Lifting
these
restrictions
provides
Kansans
and
all
Americans
greater
freedom,
but
I
believe
this
bill
will
work
to
improve
the
lives
of
11
million
Cubans
living
under
the
repressive
Castro
regime.
Allowing
U.S.
citizens
to
travel
to
Cuba
will
advance
freedom
and
liberty
by
further
exposing
Cubans
to
democratic
thought
and
free
market
principles.
As
the
standard
of
living
among
Cubans
increases,
they
will
be
enabled
to
make
greater
demands
on
their
own
government
to
increase
individual
and
political
rights.
I
hope
the
Senate
considers
legislation
in
the
near
future. Click

Introducing
the
PARTS
Act
to
Preserve
Rural
Therapy
Care
On
Tuesday,
I
introduced
S.
257,
the
Protecting
Access
to
Rural
Therapy
Services
(PARTS)
Act. This
bipartisan
legislation
would
make
certain
rural
and
other
patients
have
access
to
a
full
range
of
outpatient
therapeutic
services
in
hospitals
in
their
own
communities.
S.
257
is
an
updated
version
of
the
PARTS
Act
I
introduced
last
Congress
as
S.
1143.
"Outpatient
therapeutic
services"
include
services
such
as
pulmonary
rehabilitation,
certain
behavior
health
assessments
and
counseling,
demonstration/evaluating
the
use
of
an
inhaler
or
nebulizer,
and
certain
casting/splinting
procedures. Hospital
outpatient
therapeutic
services
have
always
been
administered
by
licensed,
skilled
professionals
under
the
overall
direction
of
a
physician.
However,
in
2009
the
Centers
for
Medicare
and
Medicaid
Services
(CMS)
abruptly
shifted
policy
to
require
that
outpatient
therapeutic
services
must
be
furnished
under
the
"direct
supervision"
of
a
physician
who
is
required
to
be
physically
present
in
the
department
at
all
times
that
Medicare
beneficiaries
receives
these
services.
While
the
need
for
this
level
of
supervision
is
recognized
for
certain
high
risk,
complex
outpatient
services,
CMS'
policy
often
applies
to
even
low
risk
services,
such
as
some
medication
injections
and
minor
wound
debridement.
For
many
years,
these
procedures
have
been
safely
administered
in
hospital
outpatient
departments
under
"general
supervision,"
a
standard
that
permits
services
to
be
furnished
under
the
general
oversight
and
control
of
a
supervising
practitioner
without
requiring
his
or
her
physical
presence. In
fact,
in
December
2014
President
Obama
signed
into
law
H.R.
4067
&ndash;
legislation
I
originally
introduced
last
year
that
was
unanimously
passed
by
Congress
&ndash;
that
suspended
enforcement
of
these
burdensome
regulations
on
Critical
Access
Hospitals
(CAHs)
and
other
small
rural
hospitals
in
2014.
Rural
hospitals
need
reasonable
flexibility
to
appropriately
staff
their
facilities
so
they
can
provide
a
full
range
of
services
to
their
communities.
Many
hospitals
find
CMS'
direct
supervision
requirements
impossible
to
meet,
which
jeopardizes
access
to
this
important
care.
The
PARTS
Act
would
preserve
patient
safety
and
oversight
while
easing
unreasonable
supervision
requirements
for
therapy
care.
This
bill
is
crafted
to
make
certain
federal
regulations
reflect
the
realities
of
rural
health
care
and
address
this
issue
on
a
permanent
basis.

Visiting
with
Tabor
College
President
Jules
Glanzer
Also
this
week,
I
met
with
Tabor
College
President
Dr.
Jules
Glanzer
to
visit
about
the
latest
developments
in
Hillsboro
and
at
Tabor. Dr.
Glanzer
was
in
Washington,
D.C.
for
a
meeting
of
the
Council
for
Christian
Colleges
&amp;
Universities.
He
provided
me
with
an
update
on
Tabor's
efforts
to
offer
the
best
equipment
and
facilities
for
students
to
learn
and
thrive,
and
pursue
the
college's
mission
of
preparing
individuals
for
a
life
of
learning,
work,
and
service
for
Christ
and
His
kingdom.
We
discussed
Tabor's
Signature
Campaign
&ndash;
the
largest
fundraising
project
in
the
history
of
the
college
&ndash;
to
build
a
campus
home
for
the
fine
arts.
In
a
few
years,
Tabor
is
planning
to
open
the
new
Shari
Flaming
Center
for
the
Arts.
This
facility
will
include
a
comprehensive
fine
arts
performance
venue
and
worship
center,
a
stage
for
the
music
and
drama
programs,
a
studio
theater,
and
recital
hall
and
gallery
space
for
the
visual
arts. Tabor
alumni
and
friends
have
donated
nearly
$13
million
of
the
$16.2
million
total
of
the
Signature
Campaign
goal. This
is
a
great
example
of
a
Kansas
college
and
its
community
working
together
to
help
shape
the
lives
current
and
future
students
for
generations
to
come. I
appreciate
Dr.
Glanzer
taking
time
while
he
was
in
Washington
to
update
me
on
this
project.
My
email
address
is
