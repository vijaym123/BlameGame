NEW DEVELOPMENT: Republican heavy hitters pour in big cash for Dold
David -- Boehner. Cantor. Ryan.
The royal triumvirate of GOP heavy hitters just cut huge checks for Bob Dold&rsquo;s campaign.
What&rsquo;s going on? Election day is just around the corner and a new poll shows the margin in our race is RAZOR-THIN.
Republicans think with enough cash they can just buy this election. Well, if we don&rsquo;t fight back and get out the facts to Illinois voters, they could be right. David, that&rsquo;s where you come in.
Let&rsquo;s turn the tide and show Republicans what we&rsquo;re made of. Are you in?
David Johnson DEADLINE: MIDNIGHT

Fighting for Illinois is my top priority. I&rsquo;m fighting to raise the minimum wage, to protect our environment, and to ban discrimination against LGBT employees.
But Republicans like Boehner, Ryan and Cantor are eager to impose their anti-middle class, anti-environment, anti-woman and anti-equality agenda on Illinois families.
You&rsquo;re our only hope to fight back. Please chip in before it&rsquo;s too late. http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/Fight-for-IL
