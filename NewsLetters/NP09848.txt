Dear Friend,
Thank you very much for signing up for our eNewsletter. I appreciate
the opportunity to serve as your Representative. I wanted to give you
this update on our activities in the Second District and Washington,
D.C.
Last Friday I started my fourth round of town halls throughout the
Second District. I made stops in Craig, Delaware, Mayes, Nowata, and
Ottawa counties.
Met some great people at the Ottawa county town hall held at
Northeastern Oklahoma A&M; College in Miami.
IRS Oversight
This week the House of Representatives passed two resolutions calling
for oversight of the Internal Revenue Service: passage of H.Res. 574,
holding Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress, and passage of H.Res. 565,
calling on Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a special counsel
for the purpose of investigating the IRS targeting of conservative
non-profit groups.
For far too long, we have gone without answers when it comes to the
abuse of power by the IRS and the unfair treatment of conservative
non-profit groups. The actions by the IRS are not only offensive, but
clearly cross a line. Americans should not have to live with the fear
of being singled-out and punished because of their beliefs.
In order to bring about greater transparency and accountability, this
week the House took action. We called out this Administration for its
lack of leadership and openness, and demanded answers. The political
maneuvers at the expense of our freedoms must be stopped.
The American people are fed up. It's that simple. They deserve answers
and we are demanding answers on their behalf.
This week we signed the Water Resources Reform and Development Act
(WRRDA) out of conference. I
was honored to work alongside my
colleagues on bipartisan legislation that brings about much needed
water infrastructure reform.
I had a great visit with some of my fellow members of the Oklahoma
Rural Electric Cooperatives this week.
Benghazi Investigation
The House of Representatives approved H.Res. 567, the Establishment of
the Select Committee on Benghazi. For the second time this week, we
found ourselves asking for accountability from this Administration.
Four Americans were lost on that tragic day in Benghazi nearly two
years ago. Yet after these many months, we still don't know what really
happened.
The cloud of secrecy exhibited by the White House is unsettling to say
the least. We have a President who has resorted to deception and
cover-ups that now must be rectified. By establishing this select
committee, we are committing to the families who lost loved ones during
the attack, and to the American people, that answers will be found.
I commend Representative Trey Gowdy for agreeing to lead the bipartisan
investigative committee and am confident he will leave no stone
unturned. Many want to say our actions are politically based, yet
finding out the truth as to why American lives were lost is the
farthest thing from political.
Met with ALS Advocacy Day attendees from Oklahoma this week. Reminds me
of my friend Zack Green who we lost to Lou Gehrig's disease, and just
how important awareness is.
