Dear Friends,
Congressman Collins speaking against EPA overreach under the Clean
Water Act at Stein Farms in LeRoy. (Left to Right: New York Farm Bureau
President Dean Norton Congressman Collins, Dale Stein and Shelley
Stein.
As we finally say goodbye to the cold and hopefully move toward warmer
weather, I wanted to share some Congressional updates from this last
month with you.
Farmers in our community are all too familiar with the aggressive
overreach of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). So it came as
no surprise when the EPA proposed a massive expansion of federal
control under the Clean Water Act (CWA).
This proposal would put ditches, natural or man-made ponds, flood
plains, and even large divots in the ground that fill with rain water
under federal jurisdiction, robbing farmers of control over their own
land. In an effort to block this ridiculous proposal, I sent a letter
to the EPA Administrator voicing my strong concern. In the end, 231 of
my colleagues from both parties in the House signed onto my letter,
sending a strong bipartisan message that this proposal should be
abandoned immediately. The EPA's plan contradicts prior U.S. Supreme
Court decisions and is based on incomplete scientific and economic
analyses. On behalf of our hardworking famers in NY-27 and all across
this country, I will continue to fight EPA overreach.
The House Majority recently passed a budget that I was proud to
support, which includes a provision I secured to protect Medicare
Advantage from future cuts. The budget makes necessary reforms and
structural changes to Medicare in 2024 to strengthen the current
program and sustain it for future generations.
The House Republican Budget balances in 10 years, saving taxpayers $5
trillion by shrinking big government and cutting wasteful spending, and
reducing the country's historic debt. This budget does what so few
Washington budget proposals do - it actually balances. The American
people understand we cannot keep borrowing money from China to pay our
bills, bankrupting our children and grandchildren's future in the
process.
Congressman Collins received the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Spirit of
Enterprise Award at McGard in Orchard Park. (Left to Right: McGard
President Durham McCauley, Zachary Hutchins from the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, President and CEO of the Buffalo Niagara Partnership Dottie
Gallagher-Cohen and McGard Executive Vice President Peter McCauley.)
In an effort to get the economy moving and leave taxpayers with more of
their hard-earned money, the House Republican Budget also includes
significant tax reform to bring down rates and level the playing field
for small businesses and hard working families. The budget also
relieves the burdens of ObamaCare for the countless Americans who have
seen their premiums skyrocket, their coverage dropped, or their hours
cut.
Those opposed to the House Republican Budget will continue to demonize
it without advancing a spending plan of their own. The American people
want Washington to get its head out of the sand and deal with our
out-of-control spending and staggering debt. The House Republican
Budget does just that.
In April, I also had the chance to welcome the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
to New York's 27th Congressional District. During at stop at McGard
LLC, in Orchard Park, the Chamber presented me with its annual Spirit
of Enterprise Award. It was an honor to be recognized with this award
for my support of pro-business policies during my first year in
Congress. As a member of the House Committee on Small Business, and a
businessman and entrepreneur myself, I understand how important it is
to support legislation that encourages business growth and creation.
Clockwise from top: Congressman Collins visits McGard in Orchard Park,
Congressman Collins meets with his Veterans Advisory Board in Genesee
County, Congressman Collins visits Markin in Covington, Congressman
Collins meets with his Agriculture Advisory Board at Noblehurst Farms
and Congressman Collins visits FTT Manufacturing in Geneseo.
As always, thank you to everyone who continues to contact my office.
Your questions, input and feedback allow me to better represent you in
Washington.
Sincerely,
CHRIS COLLINS
Member of Congress
Vision: The United States of America will reclaim its past glory as the
Land of Opportunity, restoring the promise of the American Dream for
our children and grandchildren.

Dear
Friends,
Congressman
Collins speaking
against
EPA
overreach
under
the
Clean
Water Act
at
Stein
Farms
in
LeRoy.
(Left
to
Right:
New
York
Farm
Bureau
President
Dean
Norton
Congressman
Collins,
Dale
Stein
and
Shelley
Stein.
As
we
finally
say
goodbye
to
the
cold
and
hopefully
move
toward
warmer
weather,
I
wanted
to
share
some
Congressional
updates
from
this
last
month
with
you.
Farmers
in
our
community
are
all
too
familiar
with
the
aggressive
overreach
of
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(EPA).
So
it
came
as
no
surprise
when
the
EPA
proposed
a
massive
expansion
of
federal
control
under
the
Clean
Water
Act
(CWA).
This
proposal
would
put
ditches,
natural
or
man-made
ponds,
flood
plains,
and
even
large
divots
in
the
ground
that
fill
with
rain
water
under
federal
jurisdiction,
robbing
farmers
of
control
over
their
own
land.
In
an
effort
to
block
this
ridiculous
proposal,
I
sent
a
letter
to
the
EPA
Administrator
voicing
my
strong
concern.
In
the
end,
231
of
my
colleagues
from
both
parties
in
the
House
signed
onto
my
letter,
sending
a
strong
bipartisan
message
that
this
proposal
should
be
abandoned
immediately.
The
EPA&#8217;s
plan
contradicts
prior
U.S.
Supreme
Court
decisions
and
is
based
on
incomplete
scientific
and
economic
analyses.
On
behalf
of
our
hardworking
famers
in
NY-27
and
all
across
this
country,
I
will
continue
to
fight
EPA
overreach.
The
House
Majority
recently
passed
a
budget
that
I
was
proud
to
support,
which
includes
a
provision
I
secured
to
protect
Medicare
Advantage
from
future
cuts.
The
budget
makes
necessary
reforms
and
structural
changes
to
Medicare
in
2024
to
strengthen
the
current
program
and
sustain
it
for
future
generations.
The
House
Republican
Budget
balances
in
10
years,
saving
taxpayers
$5
trillion
by
shrinking
big
government
and
cutting
wasteful
spending,
and
reducing
the
country&#8217;s
historic
debt.
This
budget
does
what
so
few
Washington
budget
proposals
do
&#8211;
it
actually
balances.
The
American
people
understand
we
cannot
keep
borrowing
money
from
China
to
pay
our
bills,
bankrupting
our
children
and
grandchildren&#8217;s
future
in
the
process.
Congressman
Collins received
the
U.S.
Chamber
of
Commerce Spirit
of
Enterprise
Award
at
McGard
in
Orchard
Park.

President

an

and

the

The

Republican
Budget
does
just
that.
In
April,
I
also
had
the
chance
to
welcome
the
U.S.
Chamber
of
Commerce
to
New
York&#8217;s
27th
Congressional
District.
During
at
stop
at
McGard
LLC,
in
Orchard
Park,
the
Chamber
presented
me
with
its
annual
Spirit
of
Enterprise
Award.
It
was
an
honor
to
be
recognized
with
this
award
for
my
support
of
pro-business
policies
during
my
first

in
Congress.
As
a
member
of
the
House
Committee
on
Small
Business,
and
a
businessman
and
entrepreneur
myself,
I
understand
how
important
it
is
to
support
legislation
that
encourages
business
growth
and
creation.

Congressman

As

who
continues
to
contact
my

to
