Dear Friend,
Everyone's heard Alan Jackson's song " Chattahoochee ."
Last week,
I was thinking about one line in particular:
" never
knew how much that muddy water meant to me ."
That muddy
water means
a lot
to Northeast Georgia's economy, thanks in no
small part to the Chattahoochee National Fish Hatchery.
In
fact, that hatchery is the source of about $30.3 million per year
that flows into the local economy.
That's a $40 return on each and
every taxpayer dollar invested in the facility.
Last
week, I made a special appearance before one of the House Natural
Resources subcommittees to share this information because the Fish and
Wildlife Service recently reported they are considering closing the
hatchery at Chattahoochee.
I hope you'll take a minute to
hear what I told the
committee .
Our local issues like the future of the Chattahoochee
hatchery sometimes mean a lot more than you might think.
As
always, I hope you'll help
keep me informed !
Sincerely,
Doug
Collins
Member of Congress
"We're concerned
about the moms and dads going to work every day."
The other day I
provided a little Northeast Georgia perspecitive to the weekly press
availability for House Republicans.
See what I shared
about our cold winter
in the mountains and what the House of Representatives is doing to
#EasetheSqueeze
on
families.
