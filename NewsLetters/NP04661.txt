Friends,
I wanted to send you a quick update on the state of our race.
Yesterday the Registrar of Voters began to count the tens of thousands of ballots that still remain uncounted.
After the last count, we gained over 800 votes.
As expected, our race is tightening and we expect to pull into the lead as more of these late ballots are processed and counted.
There are still over 79,000 ballots countywide left to count, so we know this will take time.
The Registrar is being thorough and making sure that every valid vote is counted - however,
we are preparing for the possibility that Doug Ose and the Republican Party will draw the ballot counting out and potentially call for a recount.
At this time, we are raising money to both ensure that the ballot counting process is fair and neutral, and to prepare for a possible recount. Can you donate to our recount fund right now?
If you&#39;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Support our Recount Fund: $5
Support our Recount Fund: $25
Support our Recount Fund: $50
Support our Recount Fund: $100
Support our Recount Fund: $250
Or donate another amount.
We have to raise this money in order to be prepared for any possible eventuality.
In the event that the funds are not needed for this process, we will have the option of returning your contribution.
Thank you for sticking with us through this process.
Be well,
Ami
