Make It in America
Manufacturing is the backbone of our economy that provides good
paying jobs and the industrial base necessary for our national defense
and future prosperity.
The U.S. manufacturing sector took it on
the chin during the 2000s, when nearly 4.5 million manufacturing jobs
were lost, but since 2010, U.S. manufacturing employment has added
half a million jobs.
We need policies that build on this
progress.
In particular,
the U.S. must invest in advanced high-tech manufacturing.
As we
reported earlier, Michigan recently won a national competition to
host a new $148 million initiative to spur manufacturing in the area of
advanced metals.
The advanced metals hub will be the 4th U.S.
manufacturing institute with the goal of giving U.S. firms the tools they
need to compete with other countries in the area of advanced
manufacturing.
But foreign nations have a big lead on us.
Germany
alone has 60 innovation hubs.
Rep. Levin recently joined a
bipartisan group of House lawmakers in sponsoring the Revitalize
Manufacturing and Innovation Act to establish a national network of
public/private centers for manufacturing
innovation.
Scientists Sound the
Alarm on Climate Change
The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)
just released a stark report on global warming called, What We Know:
The Reality, Risks and Response to Climate Change.
The report
states that 97% of climate scientists agree that climate change is
happening here and now, and is going to get worse over the next 10-20
years.
The report also underscores that humans are driving climate
change, and that the sooner we act, the lower the risk and cost of
taking action.
The
18-page
AAAS
report
was written to help the American people
better understand the overwhelming scientific evidence of human-caused
climate change and the dangers it poses to all of
us.
Levin Urges
Immediate Action to Extend Unemployment
Insurance
The Senate may be close to
breaking the logjam on extending jobless benefits to workers who have lost
their jobs through no fault of their own.
The Dec. 28
expiration of the federal emergency unemployment insurance program has now cut
off unemployment benefits to more than two million people.
The
proposed Senate compromise would extend benefits for another five
months while requiring long-term recipients to get job training and
referrals to re-employment services.
Meanwhile, House Democrats have filed a rare discharge
petition to force a vote on Rep. Levins bill that would extend emergency
unemployment insurance.
The discharge petition, filed by Rep. Brad
Schneider of Illinois, would force a vote on the House floor to
extend unemployment insurance if 218 members of Congress sign on.
So
far, 191 members have
signed.
