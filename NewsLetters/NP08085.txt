Dear Friend, Democrats are under attack from coast to coast. And progressive Democrats like me could become an endangered species in the Senate if we&rsquo;re not prepared.
Big oil billionaires like the Koch brothers have been taking aim at environmental activists for a long, long time -- and they know that I&rsquo;m never going to stop fighting for meaningful action on climate change, for clean energy jobs and for an economy that doesn't depend on foreign oil.
That&rsquo;s part of why they&rsquo;ve pledged to raise $290 million this year: They want to buy a Senate that will pretend climate change doesn&rsquo;t exist. But as long as I have grassroots supporters like you, I know I can stand up to the Kochs&rsquo; millions. Can you give $5 today to keep our campaign running strong?

We&rsquo;re not taking anything for granted on this campaign, and we&rsquo;re already organizing on the ground to win in November. But the Koch brothers and their Big Oil allies are doing the same thing. That&rsquo;s okay, though --
no one
is going to outwork this campaign.
Whether it&rsquo;s Medicare, Social Security, medical research, or making college more affordable, progressive Democrats like me are going to keep fighting, no matter what the Koch brothers and their special interest allies throw at us. And you can help us stay in the fight. Make a $5 contribution to give our team the resources it will need in the home stretch of this campaign.
Thank you for your continued support.
