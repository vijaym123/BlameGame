Dear Friend -
While the number of Californians who have enrolled in quality, affordable healthcare is impressive and far exceeds the rest of the nation, there is much to be done in the next 17 days.
If you haven't enrolled yet, join me
TOMORROW at the
WE Connect
enrollment fair at 9:00 a.m. at Santa Ana High School, 520 W. Walnut, Santa Ana, CA,92701
or one of our other upcoming events before March 31st.
Find events near you on my website: http://1.usa.gov/1kT000M .
Thanks as always,
Loretta Sanchez
Member of Congress
