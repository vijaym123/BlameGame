Rep. Cuellar Hosts STEM Video with Google and National Science Foundation
Dear Friends,
Every month, I film an informative cable show for the residents of the 28th District of Texas.
For the month of May, I invited the National Science Foundation and Google to join me for a discussion on the importance of investment in science research and technology and outlining resources for students and families interested in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields.
The Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) field is one of the fastest growing sectors in our economy and the impact of technology is increasingly visible in our everyday lives.
It is vital that young people learn about the opportunities available in STEM fields and become familiar with technology from an early age.
That is why I invited Google and the National Science Foundation, both leaders in the field of research and investment in science and technology, to join me for an informational discussion.

District to explore the STEM resources available to them and use this opportunity to learn more about this important field.
