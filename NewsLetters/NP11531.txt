Friend,
It&#39;s been a few weeks since I started as the Campaign Manager at Bera for Congress, and let me tell you -- the momentum of our grassroots support has blown me away.
Harnessing that momentum is key, which means one thing: it&#39;s time to open our first office.
We need volunteers on the streets, on the phones, and working hard to reach out to voters.
This is where you come in.
Our office is opening this Monday, and we need to stock up on supplies to make sure the office is in good shape.
Those costs can really add up -- take a look below:
-
$5:
a clipboard for a volunteer to knock on doors
-
$35:
a box of paper to print out our targets
-
$50:
snacks and water for our volunteers to fuel their work
-
$75:
keeping the internet up and running for one month
-
$200:
one month of phone lines for volunteers to use to call voters
Not to mention paying the rent and keeping the lights on!
This is exciting-- and you can make a real difference in what our office looks like this month.
Can you pitch in $5 or more today to help sponsor supplies for our new office?
I know buying a ream of paper doesn&#39;t seem very exciting, but these supplies are vital to the success of our volunteers -- and trust me, our volunteers are going to be the life blood of our campaign.
This stuff is important.
Click here to give $5 or more now to ensure that our volunteers have what they need.
Thanks -- and talk again soon!
Best,
Danny Kazin
Campaign Manager, Bera for Congress
P.S.
Pens, clipboards, paper, and snacks may seem like small things, but these supplies are what keep our volunteers going.
We have so much work to do and your donation will help us get to the finish line with a victory in November.
Can you chip in $5 right now?
