News from Representative Richard Nugent
Dear Friends,
Every year around this time, at least in the House, Congress gets
together and members produce various budget proposals.
Here are the
highlights:
I'll walk you briefly through the "Ryan Budget" first.
This year's
"Ryan Budget" more or less mirrors what he's proposed in the past.
This year's edition balances the budget within ten years and does so
without raising taxes.
Defense spending is put at a level sufficient
to carry out the strategy that the President has called for and the
so-called auto-pilot programs that account for a majority of our
overall budget are put on sustainable footing.
All in all, there are
definitely some things I would do differently, but as a general
concept, I think it's a very realistic plan for how to get us to where
we need to be.
If you are interested in reading the specifics, you can go through the
whole plan at http://budget.house.gov
.
This is the budget I supported.
As for the "Progressive Caucus" alternative. well. it's definitely
progressive.
The Democrats' 2014 "Progressive Caucus" budget is
(questionably) titled the "Better Off Budget".
I looked twice and they
definitely did not include a question mark after 'better off'.
A couple of quick top-line highlights - The "Better Off Budget" would
increase spending by $3.3 trillion. That increase, by the way, is
nearly equivalent to a full year of total federal expenditures.
The "Better Off Budget" would also result in some tax increases.
Not a
big surprise there - all Democrat budgets do.
But the real jaw dropper
of the "Better Off Budget" is the scale of the tax increases.
Over the
next ten years, the "Better Off Budget" calls for tax increases
totaling. wait for it. $6.6 trillion.
Six point six trillion in new
taxes.
That's not the total amount of taxes collected mind you, that's
just the increase the Democrats are proposing.
To put that number in perspective, our total annual GDP in America (or
the measure of our total economy) is only about $14 trillion. So yes,
$6.6 trillion in new taxes is a lot.
It is an unfathomably big tax
increase.
And you could certainly be forgiven for wondering if the
American people will in fact be "better off" under this plan.
The real kicker to me though is that even if the "progressives" got
every last nickel in new taxes that they are asking for, their budget
would still never reach balance - never. Not-even-close.
Even with all
of that $6.6 trillion in new taxes, the "progressives" find a way to
spend every nickel.
Now in fairness to the Democrats, they did have other budget proposals.
Some only raise taxes by a trillion dollars and some by two trillion
dollars, but none of them ever balance.
Not one Democrat proposal.
So when people say there is a big gap between the parties on fiscal
policy, they are right.
I voted against one of the Republican
proposals because I think it reforms Medicare more abruptly than is
necessary to save the program from bankruptcy, but it is at least a
budget that balances.
In the end, there is a responsible, workable way
forward. But I sincerely question how on earth we are going to bridge
the gap between Republicans and Democrats when we can't even agree that
a balanced budget is a goal worth pursuing for the American people.
And every year when we go through this exercise, my belief is
continually reinforced the only way that we'll ever truly be able to
put America on a sound financial footing is to require a balanced
budget - just as the states manage to do each year with a fraction of
the tax revenue that the federal government gets.
I was as proud as I've ever been as a member of Congress when I was
asked to bring the Balanced Budget Amendment to the House floor for
debate.
And I have never been as disappointed as I was when I saw
people who had voted for it in the past change their minds and bring
the amendment down.
The fiscal challenges that we are facing as a
nation are enormous.
There is no question about it.
And cutting
valuable programs isn't as much fun as handing out freebies to
everybody who bothers to ask.
But the reality is that is our job.
We
have a fiduciary responsibility to manage the taxpayers affairs in a
way that benefits them - not us.
I remain hopeful that as we move
through the next few years, the two sides can start to reach a
consensus - if not on how we get to a balanced budget, but at least a
consensus on the need to do so.
As I have in the past, I will remind my dear readers that within ten
years our annual interest payments on our national debt are scheduled
to grow from $200 billion annually to over $800 billion annually.
That
is more than we spend now on the military, on Medicare, or on Social
Security.
Interest payments alone will be our second biggest line
item.
Is that really a legacy that we want to leave for our children?
I certainly don't think so.
But as always, I am interested to hear what you think.
If you have a
moment, please drop me a line.
And if you have any questions about any
of the budget proposals (or anything else going on in Washington), just
let me know.
Thanks again.
Sincerely,
Rich Nugent
Member of Congress

Richard
Nugent
Dear
Friends,
[if gte mso 10]>
<![endif]
Every
year
around
this
time,
at
least
in
the
House,
Congress
gets
together
and
members
produce
various
budget
proposals.
Here
are
the
highlights:
I&#8217;ll
walk
you
briefly
through
the
&#8220;Ryan
Budget&#8221;
first.
This
year&#8217;s
&#8220;Ryan
Budget&#8221;
more
or
less
mirrors
what
he&#8217;s
proposed
in
the
past.
This
year&#8217;s
edition
balances
the
budget
within
ten
years
and
does
so
without
raising
taxes.
Defense
spending
is
put
at
a
level
sufficient
to
carry
out
the
strategy
that
the
President
has
called
for
and
the
so-called
auto-pilot
programs
that
account
for
a
majority
of
our
overall
budget
are
put
on
sustainable
footing.
All
in
all,
there
are
definitely
some
things
I
would
do
differently,
but
as
a
general
concept,
I
think
it&#8217;s
a
very
realistic
plan
for
how
to
get
us
to
where
we
need
to
be.
If
you
are
interested
in
reading
the
specifics,
you
can
go
through
the
whole
plan
at
http://budget.house.gov .
This
is
the
budget
I
supported.
As
for
the
&#8220;Progressive
Caucus&#8221;
alternative&#8230;
well&#8230;
it&#8217;s
definitely
progressive.
The
Democrats&#8217;
2014
&#8220;Progressive
Caucus&#8221;
budget
is
(questionably)
titled
the
&#8220;Better
Off
Budget&#8221;.
I
looked
twice
and
they
definitely
did
not
include
a
question
mark
after
&#8216;better
off&#8217;.
A
couple
of
quick
top-line
highlights
&#8211;
The
&#8220;Better
Off
Budget&#8221;
would
increase
spending
by
$3.3
trillion .
That
increase,
by
the
way,
is
nearly
equivalent
to
a
full
year
of
total
federal
expenditures.
The
&#8220;Better
Off
Budget&#8221;
would
also
result
in
some
tax
increases.
Not
a
big
surprise
there
&#8211;
all
Democrat
budgets
do.
But
the
real
jaw
dropper
of
the
&#8220;Better
Off
Budget&#8221;
is
the
scale
of
the
tax
increases.
Over
the
next
ten
years,
the
&#8220;Better
Off
Budget&#8221;
calls
for
tax
increases
totaling&#8230;
wait
for
it&#8230;
$6.6
trillion.
Six
point
six
trillion
in
new
taxes.
That&#8217;s
not
the
total
amount
of
taxes
collected
mind
you,
that&#8217;s
just
the
increase
the
Democrats
are
proposing.
To
put
that
number
in
perspective,
our
total
annual
GDP
in
America
(or
the
measure
of
our
total
economy)
is
only
about
$14
trillion.
So
yes,
$6.6
trillion
in
new
taxes
is
a
lot.
It
is
an
unfathomably
big
tax
increase.
And
you
could
certainly
be
forgiven
for
wondering
if
the
American
people
will
in
fact
be
&#8220;better
off&#8221;
under
this
plan.
The
real
kicker
to
me
though
is
that
even
if
the
&#8220;progressives&#8221;
got
every
last
nickel
in
new
taxes
that
they
are
asking
for,
their
budget
would
still
never
reach
balance
-
never.
Not-even-close.
Even
with
all
of
that
$6.6
trillion
in
new
taxes,
the
&#8220;progressives&#8221;
find
a
way
to
spend
every
nickel.
Now
in
fairness
to
the
Democrats,
they
did
have
other
budget
proposals.
Some
only
raise
taxes
by
a
trillion
dollars
and
some
by
two
trillion
dollars,
but
none
of
them
ever
balance.
Not
one
Democrat
proposal.
So
when
people
say
there
is
a
big
gap
between
the
parties
on
fiscal
policy,
they
are
right.
I
voted
against
one
of
the
Republican
proposals
because
I
think
it
reforms
Medicare
more
abruptly
than
is
necessary
to
save
the
program
from
bankruptcy,
but
it
is
at
least
a
budget
that
balances.
In
the
end,
there
is
a
responsible,
workable
way
forward.
But
I
sincerely
question
how
on
earth
we
are
going
to
bridge
the
gap
between
Republicans
and
Democrats
when
we
can&#8217;t
even
agree
that
a
balanced
budget
is
a
goal
worth
pursuing
for
the
American
people.
And
every
year
when
we
go
through
this
exercise,
my
belief
is
continually
reinforced
the
only
way
that
we&#8217;ll
ever
truly
be
able
to
put
America
on
a
sound
financial
footing
is
to
require
a
balanced
budget
&#8211;
just
as
the
states
manage
to
do
each
year
with
a
fraction
of
the
tax
revenue
that
the
federal
government
gets.
I
was
as
proud
as
I&#8217;ve
ever
been
as
a
member
of
Congress
when
I
was
asked
to
bring
the
Balanced
Budget
Amendment
to
the
House
floor
for
debate.
And
I
have
never
been
as
disappointed
as
I
was
when
I
saw
people
who
had
voted
for
it
in
the
past
change
their
minds
and
bring
the
amendment
down.
The
fiscal
challenges
that
we
are
facing
as
a
nation
are
enormous.
There
is
no
question
about
it.
And
cutting
valuable
programs
isn&#8217;t
as
much
fun
as
handing
out
freebies
to
everybody
who
bothers
to
ask.
But
the
reality
is
that
is
our
job.
We
have
a
fiduciary
responsibility
to
manage
the
taxpayers
affairs
in
a
way
that
benefits
them
&#8211;
not
us.
I
remain
hopeful
that
as
we
move
through
the
next
few
years,
the
two
sides
can
start
to
reach
a
consensus
&#8211;
if
not
on
how
we
get
to
a
balanced
budget,
but
at
least
a
consensus
on
the
need
to
do
so.
As
I
have
in
the
past,
I
will
remind
my
dear
readers
that
within
ten
years
our
annual
interest
payments
on
our
national
debt
are
scheduled
to
grow
from
$200
billion
annually
to
over
$800
billion
annually.
That
is
more
than
we
spend
now
on
the
military,
on
Medicare,
or
on
Social
Security.
Interest
payments
alone
will
be
our
second
biggest
line
item.
Is
that
really
a
legacy
that
we
want
to
leave
for
our
children?
I
certainly
don&#8217;t
think
so.
But
as
always,
I
am
interested
to
hear
what
you
think.
If
you
have
a
moment,
please
drop
me
a
line.
And
if
you
have
any
questions
about
any
of
the
budget
proposals
(or
anything
else
going
on
in
Washington),
just
let
me
know.
Thanks
again.
Sincerely, Rich
Nugent Member
of
Congress
