Dear friends,
While I hope you
have a chance to spend time with loved ones this Memorial Day
weekend, I hope you will also join me in remembering and honoring the brave
men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of our country.
New Hampshire has a proud tradition of military service, and Memorial
Day is a time to recognize those who gave their lives for
us.
One way we can honor them
is to renew our commitment to taking care of our veterans who return
home. Everyone who
has served in uniform deserves our eternal gratitude, and it
disappoints me to say that right now the VA isnt getting the job done. Im
working to address the ongoing backlog at the
VA, an d this week we took steps in the right direction
when we
advanced legislation
I authored
to make important investments that will help
reduce the backlog. But the bottom line is that we need to do better. We
must make good on our promise to our veterans, and whats happening
right now is simply unacceptable.
Lets also take time this weekend to keep
those currently serving overseas in our hearts and minds. We owe all who
have served our country a tremendous amount of
gratitude.
Sincerely,
My Office
