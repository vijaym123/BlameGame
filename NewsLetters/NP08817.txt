Duluth-Area Heroes Pack Vets Round Table
Speaking outside of the Duluth Vet Center with veterans who attended
the first of several Veterans Round Tables we're holding throughout the
8th District. Click here
for the full schedule.
Dear Friend,
Just one day before our nation marked the 70th anniversary of the D-Day
invasion that began the liberation of Europe during World War II, I was
honored to welcome so many Duluth-area heroes to the first of our
district-wide summer veterans round tables last week - including one
Vietnam vet who posted on my Facebook page:
"I attended this meeting today with Congressman Nolan for us
Veterans and our healthcare and other concerns and found it to be very
informative and helpful. He listens and takes notes and his staff is
very helpful as well. Top Shelf.... Capt Tom, Machinist Mate 3/C U.S.
Navy 1962-1966 Vietnam Veteran."
Vets who served during the Vietnam - Iraq - Afghanistan eras packed the
Duluth Vet Center, joining St. Louis County Veterans Services officers
and representatives of the Minnesota Assistance Council for Veterans
(MAC-V) for a wide-ranging discussion of problems and issues veterans
face everyday, and legislation I'm working on in Congress to directly
address those concerns.
You've heard me say it again and again. We have a sacred obligation to
protect and serve the veterans who have put themselves in harm's way to
protect and serve us.
In that regard, we talked about the Military Construction-Veterans
Affairs bill (H.R.4486) we recently passed to provide more resources
for veterans' education, medical and mental health services, housing,
and job opportunities - as well as resources to help eliminate the
unconscionable backlog in processing disability benefits. During our
discussion, several things stood out - loud and clear:
.
We need to fix the problems at the VA once and for all, and
install tough new management. The Veterans Backlog Reduction Act
(H.R.1739) I have cosponsored provides provisional benefits for any vet
with a claim more than 125 days old.
.
Vets need access to good local medical care. No veteran
should be required to travel a long distance to a VA clinic for
treatment when facilities exist close-by. That's why I'm working hard
to pass H.R.635 - The HEALTHY Vets Act - to allow vets who live a long
way from VA clinics to get the help they need locally.
.
Vets need jobs, housing, education, and retraining
opportunities. We talked about several bills I've co-sponsored
including the Hire More Veterans Act (H.R.3474) to provide small
businesses with incentives to hire vets, and the Veterans Economic
Opportunity Act (H.R.2481) to establish a Veterans Economic Opportunity
Administration to focus on vocational rehabilitation, job training, and
employment.
You can review a longer list of bills I'm working on here
, as well as watch KQDS news' coverage of our
veterans round table here:

Thanks again to all the vets who took time to join me in Duluth. I look
forward to our upcoming vets round tables in Little Falls, Brainerd,
Center City, and Hibbing. Just click here for the schedule
. And have a great week.
Sincerely,

When (Hibbing) Women Succeed - America Succeeds
Speaking with an attendee after our panel discussion at last week's
Women's Economic Forum in Hibbing.
Women need solid, everyday support systems in place to help them, and
their families, succeed. In Hibbing last week, that was the message I
heard from working women, women business owners and community leaders
who joined me and our distinguished panel at the last in our current
series of economic forums we call, "When Women Succeed, America
Succeeds."
In relating their own stories - meeting the challenges of starting
businesses, joining and rejoining the workforce, going back to school,
and raising families - the women who joined us in Hibbing echoed those
who attended previous forums in Chisago City, Brainerd, and Duluth:
they expect those of us in Congress to keep up the fight for paid
family leave, equal pay, fair employment and workplace policies,
affordable child care and student loan rates that make education
available to everyone.
And front and center, they emphasized the need to raise the federal
minimum wage to make it a living wage - at least $10.10 an hour with
periodic adjustments for inflation. Why? Because two out of every three
minimum wage earners are - you guessed it - women. I'm committed to all
these worthy efforts, and will head back to Washington this week
reenergized by all the great women (and men) who took time to join us
at these forums. We'll be doing more as time goes on.

Fixing the Affordable Care Act - One Step at a Time
The Affordable Care Act was the first step - not the last - in
reforming our nation's health care. Now we roll up our sleeves and fix
what needs fixing. To that end, I was proud to offer a bipartisan,
common-sense solution to alleviate some of the concerns of
business-owners and workers by introducing a bill, along with Rep.
David McKinley (R-WV) that would delay for three years the ACA's
"transitional reinsurance program."
This program would have forced additional costs onto working families -
up to $252 this year for a family of four - by unfairly targeting
employers and unions who "self-insure," such as Polaris Industries in
Wyoming, MN, or ALLETE, headquartered in Duluth, and subjecting them to
a yearly fee to pay for the transitional reinsurance program - a
program from which these companies do not actually benefit.
I'm proud to say that our bipartisan bill addresses this problem
without delaying the program itself, giving employers more flexibility
and time to comply with the law, and reducing costs across the board.
Minnesota Senator Al Franken has introduced the bill on the Senate
side. Read more about our bill here

Congratulations to our 2014 Service Academy Appointees
Each year I have the enormous privilege of nominating accomplished and
motivated students for acceptance into our nation's service academies -
including the Military Academy at West Point, the Naval Academy in
Annapolis, MD, the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, the Coast
Guard Academy in New London, CT, and the Merchant Marine Academy at
King's Point, NY.
After a rigorous application process that considered academic and
athletic achievements, leadership skills, character, extra-curricular
activities, and drive to succeed, a committee of former Military
Academy graduates interviewed potential nominees and made
recommendations. I'm so very proud to announce that the following
students from Minnesota's 8th District have accepted an offer to
appointment at the following academies:
U.S. Military Academy (West Point)
Dalton Calicher, from Grand Rapids
Timothy Porter, from Duluth
Nicholas Decenzo, from Eveleth
Katheryn Moonen, from Sturgeon Lake (Enrolling in the U.S.
Military Academy Prep School this fall)
U.S. Naval Academy (Annapolis)
Eric Dewitte, from Carlton
Tyler Haig, from Goodland
U.S. Air Force Academy (Colorado Springs)
Ryan De La Hunt, from Park Rapids
Alisha Martin, from Duluth
Congratulations to all of you - you have shown leadership, fortitude,
and a commitment to your country which no doubt will serve you well. I
have great hopes for your futures and for the future of our nation with
you in its service.

Welcoming the "Good Neighbor" to Biwabik
I was happy to speak with WCCO Radio's Chad Hartman as he brought his
"Good Neighbor" crew up north to explore our sport fishing lakes,
hiking trails, hunting and camp grounds, golf courses, and other
attractions in his summer series "Goin' to the Lake." Chad's first stop
last Friday was Giant's Ridge near the beautiful Range community of
Biwabik. Listen in
(my segment begins
around 28:15) as Chad and I talk politics, golf, and summer in our
beautiful northern Minnesota lake country. Travel to Minnesota's
northern lake country all summer and get paid for it? Now that's a
great job.

Best Outdoor City in America? Duluth Gets My Vote!
Outside Magazine's head-to-head competition for best outdoor city in
America is down to two finalists - our own beautiful city of Duluth,
Minnesota, and Provo, Utah. Now I ask you - how is this even a contest?
With hiking, jogging, skiing, surfing, swimming, fishing, sailing,
climbing, cycling, and sightseeing second to none - as well as the
world-class Duluth International Airport shuttling tourists in daily
for which we've brought millions in dollars in funding, and the
in-progress Northern Lights Express high-speed rail that would bring
Twin Cities visitors up in just 2 hours - Duluth should win this hands
down. Click here

Our Week in Pictures
A group of Hibbing Upward Bound program students surprised me in the
hallway as I was on my way to our women's forum at Hibbing Community
College, to thank me for my support of their TRIO program. I was so
touched - and so proud to keep fighting for this worthy program that
for 50 years has been helping low and middle-class families prepare for
college and beyond.
More than 85 WWII & Korean War veterans from northern Minnesota, and
more than 90 "Guardians" (many of whom were Vietnam, Iraq, and
Afghanistan vets), flew from Duluth, MN, to Washington, D.C., Saturday
on the 7th Honor Flight Northland trip.
I was honored to join these veterans in Duluth early Saturday morning
to thank them for their service and wish them a safe journey to D.C. on
the 7th Honor Flight Northland trip. Here I am with WWII vet Alden
Palmer of Grand Marais. Visit my Facebook page

Finally...
Welcome to Our Summer Interns!
D.C. interns, from left to right: Myles Hotlzer, Andy Landkammer, Sam
Wanous, Savannah Kochinke, and Samantha Bisogno.
Duluth intern and Brainerd native David Adamson and me in my Duluth
office.
Every fall, spring, and summer, I invite college students from
Minnesota's 8th District to come and intern in my Washington, D.C. or
Duluth offices. This year, we've got a huge, talented batch - David
Adamson of Brainerd, a rising senior at Concordia College in Moorhead,
MN, assists us in our Duluth office. In D.C., we have: Savannah
Kochinke, a rising junior at Georgetown University, Samantha Bisogno,
of University of Minnesota-Duluth who sits on the board of the
Minnesota Public Interest Research Group, Sam Wanous, a fourth-year
Poli-Sci and Econ double-major at St. Cloud State, Andy Landkammer,
another double Poli-Sci and Econ major who interned at the Minnesota
State Legislature, and Myles Hotlzer, a Brainerd grad who'll be
attending the University of North Dakota in the fall. (We've also got
one more intern - Kale Wurdeman - coming in July; more about him later
this summer.)
Our interns are truly what make the office tick - interns do everything
from reading constituent letters and answering office phones, to
attending briefings in the Capitol and giving tours to visiting 8th
District residents. We couldn't do it without them. If you're a college
student and are interested in interning in either of my offices in the
fall,

Dear
Friend,
Just
one
day
before
our
nation
marked
the
70th
anniversary
of
the
D-Day
invasion
that
began
the
liberation
of
Europe
during
World
War
II,
I
was
honored
to
welcome
so
many
Duluth-area
heroes
to
the
first
of
our
district-wide
summer
veterans
round
tables
last
week
&#8211;
including
one
Vietnam
vet
who
posted
on
my
Facebook
page:
"I
attended
this
meeting
today
with
Congressman
Nolan
for
us
Veterans
and
our

and
found
it
to
be
very

helpful
as
well.

Vets
who
served
during
the
Vietnam
&#8211;
Iraq
&#8211;
Afghanistan
eras
packed
the
Duluth
Vet
Center ,
joining
St.
Louis
County
Veterans
Services
officers
and
representatives
of
the
Minnesota
Assistance
Council
for
Veterans
(MAC-V)
for
a
wide-ranging
discussion
of
problems
and
issues
veterans
face
everyday,
and
legislation
I&#8217;m
working
on
in
Congress
to
directly
address
those
concerns.
You&#8217;ve
heard
me
say
it
again
and
again.
We
have
a
sacred
obligation
to
protect
and
serve
the
veterans
who
have
put
themselves
in
harm's
way
to
protect
and
serve
us .
In
that
regard,
we
talked
about
the Military
Construction-Veterans
Affairs
bill (H.R.4486) we
recently
passed
to
provide
more
resources
for
veterans&#8217;
education,
medical
and
mental
health
services,
housing,
and
job
opportunities
&#8211;
as
well
as
resources
to
help
eliminate
the
unconscionable
backlog
in
processing
disability
benefits.
During
our
discussion,
several
things
stood
out
&#8211;
loud
and
clear:
&#8226;
We
need
to
fix
the
problems
at
the
VA
once
and
for
all,
and
install
tough
new
management .
The
Veterans
Backlog
Reduction
Act
(H.R.1739)
I
have
cosponsored
provides
provisional
benefits
for
any
vet
with
a
claim
more
than
125
days
old.
&#8226;
Vets
need
access
to
good
local
medical
care .
No
veteran
should
be
required
to
travel
a
long
distance
to
a
VA
clinic
for
treatment
when
facilities
exist
close-by.
That&#8217;s
why
I&#8217;m
working
hard
to
pass
H.R.635
&#8211;
The
HEALTHY
Vets
Act
&#8211;
to
allow
vets
who
live
a
long
way
from
VA
clinics
to
get
the
help
they
need
locally.
&#8226;
Vets
need
jobs,
housing,
education,
and
retraining
opportunities.
We
talked
about
several
bills
I&#8217;ve
co-sponsored
including
the
Hire
More
Veterans
Act
(H.R.3474)
to
provide
small
businesses
with
incentives
to
hire
vets,
and
the
Veterans
Economic
Opportunity
Act
(H.R.2481)
to
establish
a
Veterans
Economic
Opportunity
Administration
to
focus
on
vocational
rehabilitation,
job
training,
and
employment.
You

Women
Succeed
-
America
Succeeds
Speaking
with
an
attendee
after
our
panel
discussion
at
last
week's
Women's
Economic
Forum
in
Hibbing.
Women
need
solid,
everyday
support
systems
in
place
to
help
them,
and
their
families,
succeed.
In
Hibbing
last
week,
that
was
the
message
I
heard
from
working
women,
women
business
owners
and
community
leaders
who
joined
me
and
our
distinguished
panel
at
the
last
in
our
current
series
of
economic
forums
we
call,
" When
Women
Succeed,
America
Succeeds ."
In
relating
their
own
stories
&#8211;
meeting
the
challenges
of
starting
businesses,
joining
and
rejoining
the
workforce,
going
back
to
school,
and
raising
families
&#8211;
the
women
who
joined
us
in
Hibbing
echoed
those
who
attended
previous
forums
in
Chisago
City,
Brainerd,
and
Duluth:
they
expect
those
of
us
in
Congress
to
keep
up
the
fight
for
paid
family
leave,
equal
pay,
fair
employment
and
workplace
policies,
affordable
child
care
and
student
loan
rates
that
make
education
available
to
everyone.
And
front
and
center,
they
emphasized
the
need
to
raise
the
federal
minimum
wage
to
make
it
a
living
wage
&#8211;
at
least
$10.10
an
hour
with
periodic
adjustments
for
inflation.
Why?
Because
two
out
of
every
three
minimum
wage
earners
are
&#8211;
you
guessed
it
&#8211;
women.
I&#8217;m
committed
to
all
these
worthy
efforts,
and
will
head
back
to
Washington
this
week
reenergized
by
all
the
great
women
(and
men)
who
took
time
to
join
us
at
these
forums.
We&#8217;ll
be
doing
more
as
time
goes
on.
Fixing
the
Affordable
Care
Act
-
One
Step
at a
Time
The
Affordable
Care
Act
was
the
first
step
-
not
the
last
-
in
reforming
our
nation's
health
care.
Now
we
roll
up
our
sleeves
and
fix
what
needs
fixing.
To
that
end,
I
was
proud
to
offer
a
bipartisan,
common-sense
solution
to
alleviate
some
of
the
concerns
of
business-owners
and
workers
by
introducing
a
bill,
along
with
Rep.
David
McKinley
(R-WV)
that
would
delay
for
three
years
the
ACA's
"transitional
reinsurance
program."
This
program
would
have
forced
additional
costs
onto
working
families
-
up
to
$252
this
year
for
a
family
of
four
-
by
unfairly
targeting
employers
and
unions
who
"self-insure,"
such
as
Polaris
Industries
in
Wyoming,
MN,
or
ALLETE,
headquartered
in
Duluth,
and
subjecting
them
to
a
yearly
fee
to
pay
for
the
transitional
reinsurance
program
-
a
program
from
which
these
companies
do
not
actually
benefit.
I'm
proud
to
say
that
our
bipartisan
bill
addresses
this
problem
without
delaying
the
program
itself,
giving
employers
more
flexibility
and
time
to
comply
with
the
law ,
and
reducing
costs
across
the
board.
Minnesota
Senator
Al
Franken
has
introduced
the
bill
on
the
Senate
side.

bill

Welcoming
the
"Good
Neighbor"
to
Biwabik
I
was
happy
to
speak
with
WCCO
Radio's
Chad
Hartman
as
he
brought
his
"Good
Neighbor"
crew
up
north
to
explore
our
sport
fishing
lakes,
hiking
trails,
hunting
and
camp
grounds,
golf
courses,
and
other
attractions
in
his
summer
series
"Goin&#8217;
to
the
Lake."
Chad&#8217;s
first
stop
last
Friday
was
Giant&#8217;s
Ridge
near
the
beautiful
Range
community
of
Biwabik .
Listen
in
(my
segment begins
around
28:15) as
Chad
and
I
talk
politics,
golf,
and
summer
in
our
beautiful
northern
Minnesota
lake
country .
Travel
to
Minnesota&#8217;s
northern
lake
country
all
summer
and
get
paid
for
it?
Now
that&#8217;s
a
great
job.

surprised
me
in

I
was
so
touched

and
so
proud

that
for
50
years
has
been
helping
low

Duluth
intern
and
Brainerd
native
David
Adamson
and
me
in
my
Duluth
office.
Every
fall,
spring,
and
summer,
I
invite
college
students
from
Minnesota's
8th
District
to
come
and
intern
in
my
Washington,
D.C.
or
Duluth offices.
This
year,
we've
got
a
huge,
talented
batch
-
David
Adamson
of
Brainerd,
a
rising
senior
at
Concordia
College
in
Moorhead,
MN, assists
us
in
our
Duluth
office.
In
D.C., we
have:
Savannah
Kochinke ,
a
rising
junior
at
Georgetown
University,
Samantha
Bisogno ,
of
University
of
Minnesota-Duluth
who
sits
on
the
board
of
the
Minnesota
Public
Interest
Research
Group,
Sam
Wanous ,
a
fourth-year
Poli-Sci
and
Econ
double-major
at
St.
Cloud
State,
Andy
Landkammer ,
another
double
Poli-Sci
and
Econ
major
who
interned
at
the
Minnesota
State
Legislature,
and
Myles
Hotlzer , a
Brainerd
grad
who'll
be
attending
the
University
of
North
Dakota
in
the
fall.
(We've
also
got
one
more
intern
-
Kale
Wurdeman
-
coming
in
July;
more
about
him
later
this
summer.)
Our interns
are
truly
what
make
the
office
tick
-
interns
do
everything
from
reading
constituent
letters
and
answering
office
phones,
to
attending
briefings in
the
Capitol
and
giving
tours
to
visiting
8th
District
residents. We
couldn't
do
it
without
them.
If
you're
a
college
student
and
are
interested
in
interning
in
either
of
my
offices
in
the
fall,
visit
my
