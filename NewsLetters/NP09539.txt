Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Recently, the House of Representatives passed a bill that I cosponsored called the Success and Opportunity through Charter Schools Act, which provided expanded educational choice and opportunity for parents and students. While I was in the district last week, I visited quite a few educational facilities, including several charter schools. I met teachers, answered questions from students, and visited lots of classrooms.
On Monday, I stopped by Hope Charter School and Legacy High School in Ocoee to meet with one of the founders, Crystal Yoakum. I received a tour of their current facility and also visited their expansion site. I had the opportunity to address a couple of high school classes, observe the kindergarten students, and meet many of the teachers and administrators. The school has a 100% graduation rate so far, and is doing an exceptional job in educating their students, many of whom are disadvantaged or facing learning disabilities.
Some of the other schools I visited last week included:
- West Orange High School to present the Danniel J. Petro educational scholarship awards
-
Blankner Elementary Schools 4th grade class in Orlando
-
Oak Ridge High School with City Year Orlando
-
Cornerstone Charter Academy and High School in Belle Isle
-
Treasures of Life Academy in Winter Haven
-
Milestones Community Charter School in Leesburg
-
Carver Middle Schools 7th grade civics class in Leesburg

Last Tuesday, I toured the Lake Eustis Care Center, a skilled nursing and assisted living facility that offers therapy and medical services. I enjoyed talking with the residents, including Irene and her husband, who have been married for 77 years.
Earlier that day, I also stopped by Woodlands at Church Lake to answer questions and talk to the Lake County seniors living in that retirement community.

With over one hundred brands worldwide, Mars, Inc., is a private, family-owned manufacturer of chocolates, confectioneries, petcare, and dozens of other products.
On Wednesday, I met with executives in Orlando to hear more about the Mars family and corporate goals, and to explore the exclusive merchandise they offer at the M&amp;M Retail Store in the Florida Mall.

Last week was recognized as National Small Business Week, and I had the opportunity to visit many small businesses, including Dr. Al Turris newest office for Harmony Hearing Centers in Dr. Phillips. In 2009, Dr. Turri opened his first office in Clermont, and has now expanded to five locations in the Central Florida area.
Last Tuesday, I stopped by the Lake Technical Center to meet with local mentors from SCORE and thank them for their assistance to area entrepreneurs. Celebrating their 50th anniversary this year, SCORE offers free counseling and advice to small business owners to help them grow and succeed. Click here to

Constituent Corner:
In late 2012, a constituent from Winter Garden filed a dependency claim with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), but after a long wait, had still not received a response. At his request, my office submitted a Congressional inquiry on his behalf, and continued to monitor the status of his claim. Despite additional delays, my office was able to remain in contact with the VA to determine where the problems were, and was pleased to hear that the claim was finally processed and a retro check had been issued.
Constituent Services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
We owe our veterans a debt we can never repay. Recently, reports revealed that processing delays at a VA Hospital may have cost the lives of over 40 veterans. Do you believe that this is a serious problem that should be dealt with in the swiftest and harshest of terms?
Yes

Legislative Update:
The Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) will create jobs, spur our economy, streamline and enhance the transparency of the approval process for projects, and protect our environment
all without a single earmark. Due to eliminating unnecessary and outdated projects, the bill actually cuts more than it spends. Investing in our infrastructure boosts trade, increases American competitiveness, and positions our country, and the State of Florida in particular, for economic growth. Of the 34 total projects authorized in this bill, 9 are located in Florida, representing a more than $2 billion investment in growing Floridas 21st century economy.
Nearly a third of the United States approximately $17 trillion GDP is derived from international trade, with 99% of that passing through our ports. Floridas port activity already supports 680,000 jobs, and the authorization of projects to enlarge, enhance and modernize these ports in preparation for increased trade opportunity resulting from the widening of the Panama Canal will only further strengthen our states economy and create more jobs.
The WRRDA bill also authorizes needed restoration efforts in the Everglades that will protect the natural habitat and restore historic water flows, while making critical investments to the environmental and economic value of the River of Grass.
The bottom line is that this bill is a big win for Florida.
It will strengthen our economy, create jobs, and move our country and the State of Florida forward.
Last fall, I was selected by Speaker Boehner to be part of the Conference Committee that was appointed to work with the Senate to finalize the Conference Report.
