Kansas Common Sense
May 18, 2015
Hello,
Welcome to Kansas Common Sense. It was a productive week on Capitol
Hill. Thank you for your continued interest in receiving my weekly
newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and
friends if it would interest them.
Video: A Tradition of Listening to Kansans
Too often, elected officials do too much talking and not enough
listening. As Kansas United States Senator, I have the privilege of
taking my marching orders directly from Kansans. When it comes to
making certain your voice is heard on Capitol Hill, I believe I can
best serve my constituents if Ive personally listened to your
questions and concerns.
As a Member of the House of Representatives, I launched the Big First
Listening Tour and held annual town hall meetings in each of the First
Districts 69 counties. I have continued this tradition as Senator with
the Kansas Listening Tour, and travel to each of our states 105
counties. Last month, I wrapped up my latest Kansas Listening Tour with
a town hall meeting at the South Hutchinson Public Housing Authority.
Now, with 210 completed during my time as U.S. Senator, my next Kansas
Listening Tour is on Saturday, June 6 in Hays.
You can learn more about my upcoming Kansas Listening Tour stops by
subscribing to my weekly newsletter at www.moran.senate.gov.
The VA Must Prioritize Veterans Access to Mental Health Care
I am pleased to join U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) as a sponsor of
the Prioritizing Veterans Access to Mental Health Care Act (S.841).
The legislation would allow veterans to receive immediate access to
mental health treatment outside the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
and offers incentives to prioritize hiring more mental health care
professionals at the VA.
>From the startling veteran suicide rate, to ongoing delays in hiring
the thousands of licensed professional mental health counselors (LPMHC)
and marriage and family therapists (MFT) needed within the VA, it is
clear we have a crisis in this country when it comes to addressing the
invisible wounds of war our veterans face. At a time when 50 percent of
our service men and women returning home seek mental health care
treatment, it is critical that the VA follow through on its commitment
and responsibilities to offer the best quality health care our nation
can provide. This legislation will help make certain no veteran feels
abandoned by the country they served by supporting the development of a
VA system capable of offering first-rate mental health care services.
As the VA system attempts to reform, it is essential for veterans to
have the opportunity to utilize the expertise of outside organizations
and mental health professionals in their community. Click here
to learn more.
The VA Choice Program Must Work Better for Veterans
In The Hill this week, Rep. Mullin (R-Okla.) and I outline our plan to
help fix the VAs flawed implementation of the Choice Program. The
Veterans Access to Community Care Act of 2015 (S. 207) would make
certain veterans like those in largely-rural states like Kansas are not
excluded from accessing care promised through the Choice Program simply
because of where they live. Our legislation calls on the VA to use its
authority to provide veterans access to non-VA health care when the
nearest VA medical facility within 40 miles drive time from a veterans
home does not offer the care sought by the veteran.
With the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee reviewing the Choice
Program this afternoon, I am hopeful the commonsense changes offered by
the Veterans Access to Community Care Act will be adopted. We must make
the Choice Program work as intended if we are to live up to our
commitment to care for those who sacrificed so much for our country.

Senate Begins Debate on Trade Promotion Authority
This week, the Senate voted to begin debate on Trade Promotiona l
Authority (TPA). I supported the procedural vote as I believe that
trade issues, including TPA, warrant a full and open discussion in
Congress. Trade impacts almost everyone and every industry in our
state; farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, small businesses, and workers
are just some of those directly impacted by global commerce. As the
United States continues to engage economically with other nations, I
believe it is important for Congress to provide oversight over trade
negotiations and make sure we are advancing fair trade policies that
benefit American workers, consumers and the U.S. economy.
TPA sets Congressional directives and priorities for any agreement
being negotiated by our U.S. trade representative. It requires
transparency in the negotiating process and public disclosure of
potential agreements before approval. Importantly, TPA also ensures
that Congress retains full authority to approve or disapprove any
potential agreement
its essential that the American people get final
say on any future trade deal through their elected representatives in
Congress. In the coming days I will continue to monitor and engage on
TPA and other trade issues that have potential to greatly impact
Kansans. Its an important issue for our country, and one that deserves
a full debate in the Senate.
Medical Research must be a Priority to Confront Alzheimers and other
Diseases
On Thursday, I spoke on the Senate floor about the importance of
prioritizing biomedical research supported by the National Institutes
of Health (NIH) to confront the staggering challenges of disease and
illness. One such challenge is Alzheimers disease, a devastating and
irreversible brain disease that slowly destroys an individuals
cognitive functioning, including memory and thought.
As Congress crafts appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2016, we face
the challenging task of balancing effective, efficient government
operation with the necessity of righting our nations fiscal course
during challenging times. Therefore, it is extremely important that we
prioritize initiatives that effectively serve the American people and
demonstrate sufficient return on the investment of taxpayer dollars. No
initiative meets these criteria better than biomedical research
supported by the NIH. NIH-supported research has raised life
expectancy, improved quality of life, lowered overall health care
costs, and is an economic engine that strengthens American global
competitiveness.
Today, more than 5.3 million Americans are living with Alzheimers
disease. Every minute, someone in our country develops Alzheimers
disease. It is the sixth leading cause of death in U.S., and it is the
only cause of death among the top ten in America that cannot be
prevented, cured, or even slowed. Within these grim statistics are
immeasurable suffering and stress this disease places on individuals,
families, and friends. In addition to this personal pain and distress,
the growing Alzheimers crisis is jeopardizing Medicare. This year, the
direct costs to America of caring for those with Alzheimers will total
an estimated $226 billion.
Half of these annual costs will be borne by
Medicare.
These daunting numbers mean that nearly one in five Medicare
dollars is spent on individuals with Alzheimers disease and other
dementias.
In 2050, this amount will be one in every three Medicare
dollars.
We must commit to a national strategy for speeding the development of
effective interventions for Alzheimers disease and related dementias.
Current research advances give us reason for hope.
NIH is directing
researchers to work smarter, faster, and more collaboratively to
determine the best path for progress in Alzheimers disease research.
As a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the
NIH, I am committed to prioritizing NIH and support for Alzheimers
research.
Alzheimers disease is a defining challenge of our
generation.
The health and financial future of our nation are at stake
and we simply cannot afford to ignore such a threat.
Together, we can
make a sustained commitment to Alzheimers research that will benefit
our nation and bring hope and healing to future generations. Click here

USDA to Invest $6.5 Million in Ogallala Aquifer Region
This week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced it will
invest $6.5 million in the Ogallala Aquifer region this year to help
conserve billions of gallons of water and improve water quality. This
funding will be targeted to seven priority areas in five states
including Kansas to support their primary water source and strengthen
rural economies. Parts of 36 Kansas counties are within the states
targeted priority area, including: Cheyenne, Rawlins, Decatur, Norton,
Phillips, Jewell, Republic, Sherman, Thomas, Sheridan, Wallace,
Greeley, Wichita, Scott, Lane, Barton, McPherson, Hamilton, Kearny,
Finney, Hodgeman, Pawnee, Stafford, Reno, Harvey, Sedgwick, Stanton,
Grant, Haskell, Gray, Ford, Edwards, Pratt, Kiowa, Morton and Stevens
counties.
Water is the lifeblood of Kansas communities and our states farm
economy, and we need to do all we can to protect it for future
generations. The Ogallala Aquifer has long been the main water supply
for communities, businesses, homes and agriculture production in the
high plains region of the United States, but it is being depleted at an
unsustainable rate
. This investment, through the
Ogallala Aquifer Initiative
(OAI) and USDAs Natural Resources
Conservation Service (NRCS), will help protect and improve Ogallala
Aquifer water quality while also helping farmers and ranchers find
additional methods to reduce water usage without impacting production.
This conservation investment builds on $66 million that NRCS has
invested through OAI since 2011, which helped farmers and ranchers
conserve water on more than 325,000 acres. Much of the funding invested
by USDA has been matched or supplemented by individual producers. Click

Greeting the Kansas Honor Flight at the WWII Memorial
I was fortunate to greet an Honor Flight of Korean War and World War II
veterans from Kansas on Thursday at the World War II Memorial in
Washington, D.C. These veterans represent the best of American ideals.
I am always reminded when I visit the World War II, Korea and Vietnam
Memorials that these men and women answered the call of duty in their
countrys time of need because they believed in America. They served
and sacrificed for the principles of our Founding Fathers, and the
liberties and freedoms they provide.
It was good to see John Bird (front right), a WWII vet from Plainville
and friend of my father, at the Memorial this week with his guardian
for the trip, Joe Shaffer. To the delight of the veterans visiting on
Thursday, former Kansas Senator Bob Dole greeted them as they passed
through their Memorial. Senator Dole was a driving force in the
creation of the WWII Memorial and it was a special experience for
everyone in attendance.
Our country owes our veterans a great debt and it was a pleasure to
welcome these veterans as they visited the World War II and Korean
Memorials built in their honor. I am thankful for the service of our
veterans and I will continue my work on their behalf, ensuring that
they receive the benefits they have earned.
Senate Passes Legislation Calling for Release of Americans Held Captive
in Iran
On Monday, the Senate approved a legislative measure expressing that it
is the policy of the United States that the Iranian governments
detainments of Americans Pastor Saeed Abedini, former Marine Amir
Hekmati and journalist Jason Rezaian are unjust, that these men should
be released immediately, and that the United States should make every
effort and utilize all diplomatic tools to secure their freedom. The
measure also calls on Iran to assist the United States in the search
for retired FBI agent Robert Levinson.
As the Obama Administration pushes for a nuclear accord with Iran, it
is impossible to ignore the injustice suffered by Americans at the
hands of the Iranian government. This resolution should make clear
that, despite the Obama Administrations efforts to separate these
unjust detainments from ongoing nuclear negotiations, the United States
disapproves of this behavior from the Iranian government.
Sponsoring Older Americans Act Reauthorization
I recently sponsored the Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of
2015 (S. 192), which would reauthorize the Older Americans Act (OAA)
through 2018. The OAA directs the delivery of a wide range of social
services and programs for older persons. These services include
home-delivered nutrition services; family caregiver support; and
services to prevent the abuse, neglect and exploitation of older
persons. This law also helps support senior centers in Kansas, which
serve as a base for a wide range of important initiatives such as Meals
on Wheels, health screenings, counseling and other support services for
seniors and their families. S. 192 would update the OAA for the first
time in almost a decade and was approved by the Senate Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on February 3, 2015. Such a
reauthorization is more than three years overdue.
The availability of these health, nutrition and community services
often determines whether Kansas seniors can remain in the communities
they call home. Reauthorization of this law is long overdue. I urge the
Senate to take up this important legislation and look forward to voting
for the measure. This bipartisan bill would update and improve Meals on
Wheels and other senior nutrition initiatives. It would also support
senior centers and senior transportation programs, strengthen elder
abuse protections, and improve coordination of senior programs among
local, state and federal governments. Click here

Supporting Rural Broadband at FCC Budget Hearing
This week, I also joined a group of 60 Senators in writing to FCC
Chairman Wheeler to encourage the commission to complete its transition
of the Universal Service Fund from a telephone support program into one
that supports broadband in rural areas. On Tuesday, I had an
opportunity to follow up with Chairman Wheeler in a hearing in the
Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee to examine the
FCCs FY2016 budget request. I questioned Chairman Wheeler about the
upcoming broadcast incentive auction, rural call completion issues, and
transitioning the Universal Service Fund from telephone support to
broadband support in rural areas. I was pleased to learn the FCC is
planning to pursue modifying this rural broadband support system by the
end of the year. I often hear from Kansans about inadequate broadband
access and mobile coverage. I will continue to encourage the FCC
pursues commonsense policies that help deliver these services to more
Kansans. To view clips of my questioning of Chairman Wheeler, please

and
concerns.
As
a
Member
of
the
House
of
Representatives,
I
launched
the
&#147;Big
First
Listening
Tour&#148;
and
held
annual
town
hall
meetings
in
each
of
the
First
District&#146;s
69
counties.
I
have
continued
this
tradition
as
Senator
with
the
&#147;Kansas
Listening
Tour,&#148;
and
travel
to
each
of
our
state&#146;s
105
counties.
Last
month,
I
wrapped
up
my
latest
Kansas
Listening
Tour
with
a
town
hall
meeting
at
the
South
Hutchinson
Public
Housing
Authority.
Now,
with
210
completed
during
my
time
as
U.S.
Senator,
my
next
Kansas
Listening
Tour
is
on
Saturday,
June
6
in
Hays.

The
VA
Must
Prioritize
Veterans&#146;
Access
to
Mental
Health
Care
I
am
pleased
to
join
U.S.
Senator
Joni
Ernst
(R-Iowa)
as
a
sponsor
of
the
Prioritizing
Veterans&#146;
Access
to
Mental
Health
Care
Act
(S.841).
The
legislation
would
allow
veterans
to
receive
immediate
access
to
mental
health
treatment
outside
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
and
offers
incentives
to
prioritize
hiring
more
mental
health
care
professionals
at
the
VA.
From
the
startling
veteran
suicide
rate,
to
ongoing
delays
in
hiring
the
thousands
of
licensed
professional
mental
health
counselors
(LPMHC)
and
marriage
and
family
therapists
(MFT)
needed
within
the
VA,
it
is
clear
we
have
a
crisis
in
this
country
when
it
comes
to
addressing
the
invisible
wounds
of
war
our
veterans
face.
At
a
time
when
50
percent
of
our
service
men
and
women
returning
home
seek
mental
health
care
treatment,
it
is
critical
that
the
VA
follow
through
on
its
commitment
and
responsibilities
to
offer
the
best
quality
health
care
our
nation
can
provide.
This
legislation
will
help
make
certain
no
veteran
feels
abandoned
by
the
country
they
served
by
supporting
the
development
of
a
VA
system
capable
of
offering
first-rate
mental
health
care
services.
As
the
VA
system
attempts
to
reform,
it
is
essential
for
veterans
to
have
the
opportunity
to
utilize
the
expertise
of
outside
organizations
and
mental
health
professionals
in
their
community.

The
VA
Choice
Program
Must
Work
Better
for
Veterans
In
The
Hill
this
week,
Rep.
Mullin
(R-Okla.)
and
I
outline
our
plan
to
help
fix
the
VA&#146;s
flawed
implementation
of
the
Choice
Program.
The
Veterans
Access
to
Community
Care
Act
of
2015
(S.
207)
would
make
certain
veterans
like
those
in
largely-rural
states
like
Kansas
are
not
excluded
from
accessing
care
promised
through
the
Choice
Program
simply
because
of
where
they
live.
Our
legislation
calls
on
the
VA
to
use
its
authority
to
provide
veterans
access
to
non-VA
health
care
when
the
nearest
VA
medical
facility
within
40
miles
drive
time
from
a
veteran&#146;s
home
does
not
offer
the
care
sought
by
the
veteran.
With
the
Senate
Veterans&#146;
Affairs
Committee
reviewing
the
Choice
Program
this
afternoon,
I
am
hopeful
the
commonsense
changes
offered
by
the
Veterans
Access
to
Community
Care
Act
will
be
adopted.
We
must
make
the
Choice
Program
work
as
intended
if
we
are
to
live
up
to
our
commitment
to
care
for
those
who
sacrificed
so
much
for
our
country.

Senate
Begins
Debate
on
Trade
Promotion
Authority
This
week,
the
Senate
voted
to
begin
debate
on
Trade
Promotiona
l
Authority
(TPA).
I
supported
the
procedural
vote
as
I
believe
that
trade
issues,
including
TPA,
warrant
a
full
and
open
discussion
in
Congress.
Trade
impacts
almost
everyone
and
every
industry
in
our
state;
farmers,
ranchers,
manufacturers,
small
businesses,
and
workers
are
just
some
of
those
directly
impacted
by
global
commerce.
As
the
United
States
continues
to
engage
economically
with
other
nations,
I
believe
it
is
important
for
Congress
to
provide
oversight
over
trade
negotiations
and
make
sure
we
are
advancing
fair
trade
policies
that
benefit
American
workers,
consumers
and
the
U.S.
economy.
TPA
sets
Congressional
directives
and
priorities
for
any
agreement
being
negotiated
by
our
U.S.
trade
representative.
It
requires
transparency
in
the
negotiating
process
and
public
disclosure
of
potential
agreements
before
approval.
Importantly,
TPA
also
ensures
that
Congress
retains
full
authority
to
approve
or
disapprove
any
potential
agreement
&#150;
it&#146;s
essential
that
the
American
people
get
final
say
on
any
future
trade
deal
through
their
elected
representatives
in
Congress.
In
the
coming
days
I
will
continue
to
monitor
and
engage
on
TPA
and
other
trade
issues
that
have
potential
to
greatly
impact
Kansans.
It&#146;s
an
important
issue
for
our
country,
and
one
that
deserves
a
full
debate
in
the
Senate.
Medical
Research
must
be
a
Priority
to
Confront
Alzheimer&#146;s
and
other
Diseases
On
Thursday,
I
spoke
on
the
Senate
floor
about
the
importance
of
prioritizing
biomedical
research
supported
by
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
(NIH)
to
confront
the
staggering
challenges
of
disease
and
illness.
One
such
challenge
is
Alzheimer&#146;s
disease,
a
devastating
and
irreversible
brain
disease
that
slowly
destroys
an
individual&#146;s
cognitive
functioning,
including
memory
and
thought.
As
Congress
crafts
appropriations
bill
for
Fiscal
Year
2016,
we
face
the
challenging
task
of
balancing
effective,
efficient
government
operation
with
the
necessity
of
righting
our
nation&#146;s
fiscal
course
during
challenging
times.
Therefore,
it
is
extremely
important
that
we
prioritize
initiatives
that
effectively
serve
the
American
people
and
demonstrate
sufficient
return
on
the
investment
of
taxpayer
dollars.
No
initiative
meets
these
criteria
better
than
biomedical
research
supported
by
the
NIH.
NIH-supported
research
has
raised
life
expectancy,
improved
quality
of
life,
lowered
overall
health
care
costs,
and
is
an
economic
engine
that
strengthens
American
global
competitiveness.
Today,
more
than
5.3
million
Americans
are
living
with
Alzheimer&#146;s
disease.
Every
minute,
someone
in
our
country
develops
Alzheimer&#146;s
disease.
It
is
the
sixth
leading
cause
of
death
in
U.S.,
and
it
is
the
only
cause
of
death
among
the
top
ten
in
America
that
cannot
be
prevented,
cured,
or
even
slowed.
Within
these
grim
statistics
are
immeasurable
suffering
and
stress
this
disease
places
on
individuals,
families,
and
friends.
In
addition
to
this
personal
pain
and
distress,
the
growing
Alzheimer&#146;s
crisis
is
jeopardizing
Medicare.
This
year,
the
direct
costs
to
America
of
caring
for
those
with
Alzheimer&#146;s
will
total
an
estimated
$226
billion.
Half
of
these
annual
costs
will
be
borne
by
Medicare.
These
daunting
numbers
mean
that
nearly
one
in
five
Medicare
dollars
is
spent
on
individuals
with
Alzheimer&#146;s
disease
and
other
dementias.
In
2050,
this
amount
will
be
one
in
every
three
Medicare
dollars.
We
must
commit
to
a
national
strategy
for
speeding
the
development
of
effective
interventions
for
Alzheimer&#146;s
disease
and
related
dementias.
Current
research
advances
give
us
reason
for
hope.
NIH
is
directing
researchers
to
work
smarter,
faster,
and
more
collaboratively
to
determine
the
best
path
for
progress
in
Alzheimer&#146;s
disease
research.
As
a
member
of
the
Senate
Appropriations
Subcommittee
that
funds
the
NIH,
I
am
committed
to
prioritizing
NIH
and
support
for
Alzheimer&#146;s
research.
Alzheimer&#146;s
disease
is
a
defining
challenge
of
our
generation.
The
health
and
financial
future
of
our
nation
are
at
stake
and
we
simply
cannot
afford
to
ignore
such
a
threat.
Together,
we
can
make
a
sustained
commitment
to
Alzheimer&#146;s
research
that
will
benefit
our
nation
and
bring
hope
and
healing
to
future
generations.

USDA
to
Invest
$6.5
Million
in
Ogallala
Aquifer
Region
This
week,
the
U.S.
Department
of
Agriculture
(USDA)
announced
it
will
invest
$6.5
million
in
the
Ogallala
Aquifer
region
this
year
to
help
conserve
billions
of
gallons
of
water
and
improve
water
quality.
This
funding
will
be
targeted
to
seven
priority
areas
in
five
states
including
Kansas
to
support
their
primary
water
source
and
strengthen
rural
economies.
Parts
of
36
Kansas
counties
are
within
the
state&#146;s
targeted
priority
area,
including:
Cheyenne,
Rawlins,
Decatur,
Norton,
Phillips,
Jewell,
Republic,
Sherman,
Thomas,
Sheridan,
Wallace,
Greeley,
Wichita,
Scott,
Lane,
Barton,
McPherson,
Hamilton,
Kearny,
Finney,
Hodgeman,
Pawnee,
Stafford,
Reno,
Harvey,
Sedgwick,
Stanton,
Grant,
Haskell,
Gray,
Ford,
Edwards,
Pratt,
Kiowa,
Morton
and
Stevens
counties.
Water
is
the
lifeblood
of
Kansas
communities
and
our
state&#146;s
farm
economy,
and
we
need
to
do
all
we
can
to
protect
it
for
future
generations.
The
Ogallala
Aquifer
has
long
been
the
main
water
supply
for
communities,
businesses,
homes
and
agriculture
production
in
the
high
plains
region
of
the
United
States,
but
it
is
being
depleted
at
an
unsustainable
rate .
This
investment,
through
the
Ogallala
Aquifer
Initiative
(OAI)
and
USDA&#146;s
Natural
Resources
Conservation
Service
(NRCS),
will
help
protect
and
improve
Ogallala
Aquifer
water
quality
while
also
helping
farmers
and
ranchers
find
additional
methods
to
reduce
water
usage
without
impacting
production.
This
conservation
investment
builds
on
$66
million
that
NRCS
has
invested
through
OAI
since
2011,
which
helped
farmers
and
ranchers
conserve
water
on
more
than
325,000
acres.
Much
of
the
funding
invested
by
USDA
has
been
matched
or
supplemented
by
individual
producers.

Greeting
the
Kansas
Honor
Flight
at
the
WWII
Memorial
I
was
fortunate
to
greet
an
Honor
Flight
of
Korean
War
and
World
War
II
veterans
from
Kansas
on
Thursday
at
the
World
War
II
Memorial
in
Washington,
D.C.
These
veterans
represent
the
best
of
American
ideals.
I
am
always
reminded
when
I
visit
the
World
War
II,
Korea
and
Vietnam
Memorials
that
these
men
and
women
answered
the
call
of
duty
in
their
country&#146;s
time
of
need
because
they
believed
in
America.
They
served
and
sacrificed
for
the
principles
of
our
Founding
Fathers,
and
the
liberties
and
freedoms
they
provide.
It
was
good
to
see
John
Bird
(front
right),
a
WWII
vet
from
Plainville
and
friend
of
my
father,
at
the
Memorial
this
week
with
his
guardian
for
the
trip,
Joe
Shaffer.
To
the
delight
of
the
veterans
visiting
on
Thursday,
former
Kansas
Senator
Bob
Dole
greeted
them
as
they
passed
through
their
Memorial.
Senator
Dole
was
a driving
force
in
the
creation
of
the
WWII
Memorial
and
it
was
a
special
experience
for
everyone
in
attendance.
Our
country
owes
our
veterans
a
great
debt
and
it
was
a
pleasure
to
welcome
these
veterans
as
they
visited
the
World
War
II
and
Korean
Memorials
built
in
their
honor. I
am
thankful
for
the
service
of
our
veterans
and
I
will
continue
my
work
on
their
behalf,
ensuring
that
they
receive
the
benefits
they
have
earned.
Senate
Passes
Legislation
Calling
for
Release
of
Americans
Held
Captive
in
Iran
On
Monday,
the
Senate
approved
a
legislative
measure
expressing
that
it
is
the
policy
of
the
United
States
that
the
Iranian
government&#146;s
detainments
of
Americans
Pastor
Saeed
Abedini,
former
Marine
Amir
Hekmati
and
journalist
Jason
Rezaian
are
unjust,
that
these
men
should
be
released
immediately,
and
that
the
United
States
should
make
every
effort
and
utilize
all
diplomatic
tools
to
secure
their
freedom.
The
measure
also
calls
on
Iran
to
assist
the
United
States
in
the
search
for retired
FBI
agent
Robert
Levinson.
As
the
Obama
Administration
pushes
for
a
nuclear
accord
with
Iran,
it
is
impossible
to
ignore
the
injustice
suffered
by
Americans
at
the
hands
of
the
Iranian
government.
This
resolution
should
make
clear
that,
despite
the
Obama
Administration&#146;s
efforts
to
separate
these
unjust
detainments
from
ongoing
nuclear
negotiations,
the
United
States
disapproves
of
this
behavior
from
the
Iranian
government.
Sponsoring
Older
Americans
Act
Reauthorization
I
recently
sponsored
the
Older
Americans
Act
Reauthorization
Act
of
2015
(S.
192),
which
would
reauthorize
the
Older
Americans
Act
(OAA)
through
2018.
The
OAA
directs
the
delivery
of
a
wide
range
of
social
services
and
programs
for
older
persons.
These
services
include
home-delivered
nutrition
services;
family
caregiver
support;
and
services
to
prevent
the
abuse,
neglect
and
exploitation
of
older
persons.
This
law
also
helps
support
senior
centers
in
Kansas,
which
serve
as
a
base
for
a
wide
range
of
important
initiatives
such
as
Meals
on
Wheels,
health
screenings,
counseling
and
other
support
services
for
seniors
and
their
families.
S.
192
would
update
the
OAA
for
the
first
time
in
almost
a
decade
and
was
approved
by
the
Senate
Health,
Education,
Labor
and
Pensions
Committee
on
February
3,
2015.
Such
a
reauthorization
is
more
than
three
years
overdue.
The
availability
of
these
health,
nutrition
and
community
services
often
determines
whether
Kansas
seniors
can
remain
in
the
communities
they
call
home.
Reauthorization
of
this
law
is
long
overdue.
I
urge
the
Senate
to
take
up
this
important
legislation
and
look
forward
to
voting
for
the
measure.
This
bipartisan
bill
would
update
and
improve
Meals
on
Wheels
and
other
senior
nutrition
initiatives.
It
would
also
support
senior
centers
and
senior
transportation
programs,
strengthen
elder
abuse
protections,
and
improve
coordination
of
senior
programs
among
local,
state
and
federal
governments.

Supporting
Rural
Broadband
at
FCC
Budget
Hearing
This
week,
I
also
joined
a
group
of
60
Senators
in
writing
to
FCC
Chairman
Wheeler
to
encourage
the
commission
to
complete
its
transition
of
the
Universal
Service
Fund
from
a
telephone
support
program
into
one
that
supports
broadband
in
rural
areas. On
Tuesday,
I
had
an
opportunity
to
follow
up
with
Chairman
Wheeler
in
a
hearing
in
the
Financial
Services
and
General
Government
Subcommittee
to
examine
the
FCC&#146;s
FY2016
budget
request.
I
questioned
Chairman
Wheeler
about
the
upcoming
broadcast
incentive
auction,
rural
call
completion
issues,
and
transitioning
the
Universal
Service
Fund
from
telephone
support
to
broadband
support
in
rural
areas.
I
was
pleased
to
learn
the
FCC
is
planning
to
pursue
modifying
this
rural
broadband
support
system
by
the
end
of
the
year.
I
often
hear
from
Kansans
about
inadequate
broadband
access
and
mobile
coverage.
I
will
continue
to
encourage
the
FCC
pursues
commonsense
policies
that
help
deliver
these
services
to
more
Kansans.
