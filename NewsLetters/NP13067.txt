State of the Union essay competition for high school students
I was excited to announce a State of the Union essay competition for high school students in my district. I look forward to reading their essays and having the winner of the competition accompany me to hear President Obama speak later this month.
One winner will accompany me to President Obamas State of the Union address at 9:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday, January 28, 2014. I will provide travel and lodging for the student and a parent or guardian. The winners name and essay will also be featured on my website.
The contest is open to current high school freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors who live in Arkansass Second District.
Essays may not exceed 1,000 words and should explain why the student would like to attend the State of the Union address. Essays will be evaluated on originality, clarity of thought, appropriateness to contest theme and grammar.
Entries must be e-mailed as an attached document (preferably Microsoft Word) to tim.griffin@mail.house.gov
by 5:00 p.m. CT this Tuesday, January 21, 2014 , with SOTU Essay in the subject line of the e-mail. Entrants must include their full name, mailing address, telephone number, high school and any other important contact information in the body of their e-mail.
