Happy Holidays from my family to yours!
Happy New Year! As we look ahead to 2014, I wanted to touch
base with you about some of my legislative priorities for the next year.
The Farm Bill. The lead Farm Bill negotiators have outlined the reforms
they agree can be made in the bill. Right before Christmas, they got
estimates back to see how much these reforms would cost - or in some
cases, save. Now, it's a matter of tweaking the bill to make sure all
the numbers add up, but we are on track to finish a comprehensive
five-year farm bill during the first part of 2014.
Sex Trafficking. Sadly, this is an issue South Dakota has seen more of
in recent years. I've already been pushing the End Sex Trafficking Act,
which would strengthen the federal law when it comes to those who
solicit, patronize or obtain the services of a trafficked victim, but
I'll also be exploring other needed reforms in the coming year.
School Lunch Reform. We all want our kids to be healthier, but we don't
want them to go hungry either. In mid-December, I introduced a new bill
to lift the current law's onerous meat and grain limitations, giving
schools more flexibility to decide what they will feed our kids at
lunchtime. Simply put - bureaucrats in Washington shouldn't be able to
dictate what goes on our kids' plates in South Dakota.
I'll be working on these issues and many more over the course of the
next year. I look forward to keeping you updated through this
enewsletter as progress is made.
All the best,
Kristi

Happy
Holidays
from
my
family
to
yours!
Happy
New
Year!
As
we
look
ahead
to
2014,
I
wanted
to
touch
base
with
you
about
some
of
my
legislative
priorities
for
the
next
year.
The
Farm
Bill.
The
lead
Farm
Bill
negotiators
have
outlined
the
reforms
they
agree
can
be
made
in
the
bill.
Right
before
Christmas,
they
got
estimates
back
to
see
how
much
these
reforms
would
cost
&#8211;
or
in
some
cases,
save.
Now,
it&#8217;s
a
matter
of
tweaking
the
bill
to
make
sure
all
the
numbers
add
up,
but
we
are
on
track
to
finish
a
comprehensive
five-year
farm
bill
during
the
first
part
of
2014.
Sex
Trafficking.
Sadly,
this
is
an
issue
South
Dakota
has
seen
more
of
in
recent
years.
I&#8217;ve
already
been
pushing
the
End
Sex
Trafficking
Act,
which
would
strengthen
the
federal
law
when
it
comes
to
those
who
solicit,
patronize
or
obtain
the
services
of
a
trafficked
victim,
but
I&#8217;ll
also
be
exploring
other
needed
reforms
in
the
coming
year.
School
Lunch
Reform.
We
all
want
our
kids
to
be
healthier,
but
we
don&#8217;t
want
them
to
go
hungry
either.
In
mid-December,
I
introduced
a
new
bill
to
lift
the
current
law&#8217;s
onerous
meat
and
grain
limitations,
giving
schools
more
flexibility
to
decide
what
they
will
feed
our
kids
at
lunchtime.
Simply
put
&#8211;
bureaucrats
in
Washington
shouldn&#8217;t
be
able
to
dictate
what
goes
on
our
kids&#8217;
plates
in
South
Dakota.
I&#8217;ll
be
working
on
these
issues
and
many
more
over
the
course
of
the
next
year.
I
look
forward
to
keeping
you
updated
through
this
enewsletter
as
progress
is
made.
All
the
best, Kristi Washington,
