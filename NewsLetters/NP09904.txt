Dear Friend,
Last week , I introduced legislation that would immediately authorize construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. Along with Sen. Hoeven, R-ND, and 54 other senators, we&rsquo;re pushing to get this pipeline built now.
The construction of the Keystone pipeline will creat e tens of thousands
of high-paying jobs, push our economy forward and send a signal to the world that North America intends to step up to the competition and become an energy powerhouse.
Click here to Urge the Senate to pass my bill to approve Keystone XL now.
It is time to stop studying and start building. We cannot lose this opportunity to create tens of thousands of jobs and $20 billion in economic activity. This pipeline is in our national interest. The legislation Sen. Hoeven and I have introduced will green-light the construction of the pipeline immediately.
I have worked for the past three years to urge the administration to approve the pipeline&rsquo;s construction,
beginning with a letter to Secretary Clinton in March 2011 that was signed by a bipartisan coalition of senators .
Sen. Hoeven and I have partnered together over the years
to build a strong a broad coalition necessary to push construction all the way through to approval. I will continue fighting for Keystone&rsquo;s construction until we break ground.
The time to build is now.
Sincerely,
Please contact Sen. Landrieu at
the office nearest you .
