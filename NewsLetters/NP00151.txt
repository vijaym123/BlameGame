Dear Fellow Nevadan,
Today I demanded an explanation
from the Department of Veterans Affairs on their proposal to take funds
from the Filipino Veterans Equity Compensation Fund (FVEC) to pay for
cost overruns at the mismanaged Denver VA project.
In a
letter to VA Secretary Robert McDonald, which I signed alongside Senator
Dean Heller and Senator of Hawaii Mazie Hirono, we underscored the
importance of the FVEC, which provides much-delayed compensation to more
than 200,000 Filipino veterans who served alongside American soldiers
during World War II, and slammed the VA for proposing to tap the fund
to pay for their gross mismanagement.

letter

Dear Secretary McDonald:
We write to you today to express our deep
concern over the reprogramming proposals contained in the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) plan for completion of the Denver Replacement
Medical Center which was publically released on June 5, 2015. In
particular we are very disappointed that the VA proposed to reprogram $35
million from the Filipino Veterans Equity Compensation (FVEC) fund which
Congress created to recognize the dedicated service of the over 200,000
Filipinos who fought under the U.S. flag during World War II.
While the Senate was ultimately able to
come up with a bill that provides additional flexibility to VA to
transfer other monies, we remain concerned as to why the FVEC was proposed
in the first place and also that VA may consider reprogramming funds
from the FVEC in the future. The VAs June 5 plan did not contain an
adequate explanation for the $150 million in reprogramming requests and
we urge the VA to provide a more detailed justification for all
reprogramming proposals in the future.
The fact the FVEC would be considered as a means to cover VAs
mismanagement of a major construction project is an affront to those
Filipino veterans who gave their lives in service to our nation and those
Filipino veterans whose FVEC claims appeals are still pending. We
understand VA has the authority to reprogram the FVEC funds without the
approval of Congress but ask that in the future, should such proposals be
sent to Congress for consideration, that detailed justification is
provided. In addition, we view it as essential that any reprogramming
request of FVEC funds include a plan for VA to replenish those
funds.
As strong supporters of all of our
nations veterans, we look forward to working with you to ensure our
commitments to them are kept. We would appreciate your attention to
this matter and look forward to your response.
