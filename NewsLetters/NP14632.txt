Congressional Report
Dear Friends,
I would like to share with you several updates during my Congressional Work Week across the 28th District of Texas.
Starr County Weatherization Workshop
On Thursday, my Outreach Coordinators hosted a Home Repair and Energy Efficiency Workshop to provide a broad array of information on home weatherization, preservation, and repairs for Starr County residents.
The program was designed to provide senior citizens, low-income families, Americans with disabilities, and veterans the opportunity to meet with Federal and State agencies and apply for programs that meet their specific needs.
Starr County residents browse federal agency booths to learn more about grant opportunities for home repair and weatherization.
I thank all of the organizations that joined us to make this event possible:
Texas Department Housing and Community Affairs (TDHCA)

Webb County Health Insurance Marketplace Community Seminar
Last weekend, I spoke at an Health Insurance Marketplace Community Seminar for Webb and La Salle Counties at Laredo Community College. The Affordable Care Act allows Americans to take personal responsibility for the costs of their health care and provides universal access to quality and affordable health insurance. Our District includes some of the counties that have the highest rate of uninsured Americans in the country. This is why I partnered with local agencies and organizations to host a Health Insurance Marketplace Community Workshop in Laredo to raise awareness and educate the public.

Outreach Events throughout District 28
On Monday, I joined the Wilson County community to honor Deputy Ollie F. Sammy Childress Jr. of the Wilson County Sheriffs Department, who made the ultimate sacrifice 30 years ago on Nov. 4, 1983. I presented a flag to the Childress family for the unveiling of Deputy Childress memorial and the retiring of his badge number. Deputy Ollie Childress gave his life in the line of duty for the people of this great nation and we will continue to honor his bravery and service.

Rio Grande City Relay for Life
Last weekend, my Outreach Coordinator for Starr County, Nichole Hernandez, attended a Relay for Life event organized by Rio Grande City and the American Cancer Society. Cancer survivors from all across Starr County came out "to give the boot to cancer" and to raise funds for a cure around the Joe R. Sanchez Stadium - Track.
Attendees participated to support cancer research at the Joe R. Sanchez Stadium - Track in Rio Grande City.
Opportunity to Apply for Federal Surplus Property
The Surplus Property Program provides access to local governments, non-profits, public health centers, schools, colleges, and universities to an array of property from across federal agencies at very low cost. Examples of items include vehicles, furniture, teaching and research equipment, computing hardware, printing supplies, and much more.
Organizations eligible to receive federal surplus property donations must register via a simple application to the Texas Facilities Commission. If approved, the registration must be renewed every three (3) years. There is also a sister program for State of Texas surplus property.

A special note to schools: Both the federal and State of Texas governments have a computers in schools donation program, which provides free used, refurbished computers for teaching and learning. This is a great and inexpensive way to equip a school computer lab. Learn more about the programs here:
