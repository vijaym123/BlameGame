More Jobs & Less Red Tape
Small Airplane Bill Heads for President's Desk
Dear Friend,
Despite the gridlock and partisanship that marks Washington, it's still
possible to get things done and help create good middle-class jobs for
the American people.
Senator Amy Klobuchar and I proved it again last week when our
bipartisan bill to cut red tape and unleash new technologies in
America's small airplane industry passed the House unanimously, and now
heads for the President's desk to be signed into law.
The Small Airplane Revitalization Act of 2013 is a common-sense measure
that requires the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to recognize
that small, high-technology planes like those produced by Cirrus
Aircraft in Duluth should be viewed and regulated differently from
giant airliners that carry hundreds of people across thousands of miles.
For example, thanks to Cirrus technology, a small plane can deploy a
parachute and float back to Earth if engines fail - obviously
impossible for a 747. When it comes to aircraft, one-size regulation
does not fit all.
By getting rid of outdated, unnecessary government regulations, this
bill will help unleash long-delayed investment to produce a whole new
generation of the world's safest, most technologically-advanced
airplanes.
This is exactly the approach we need to take across the board to
encourage "Make It In America" manufacturers to grow, provide more good
jobs, and improve our quality of life. We will keep at it while we
celebrate this victory for northern Minnesota.
Have a great week.

Voting to Keep A Promise In northern Minnesota, where I grew up and
raised my family, a promise made is a promise kept. So on Friday, I
joined 38 of my Democratic colleagues in voting YES to the "Keep Your
Health Plan Act," which would honor the federal government's promise to
allow people to keep their existing health insurance plans if they
wish. My vote was about keeping that promise to the American people.
And it was about allowing those whose policies were cancelled to have
more time to consider what will hopefully be better, less expensive
alternatives available under the Affordable Care Act.
Moreover, the bill I supported is very similar to what the President
has proposed to do administratively. It would provide a one year
extension in a more inclusive fashion that treats all Americans alike.
I think this will move us in the right direction, and I'm glad to see
that for the first time, some of my colleagues in the House are working
on fixing and improving the Affordable Care Act, rather than trying to
repeal it. We need to put aside politics and partisanship and provide
Americans with the health care they need and deserve.
Appointed By Leadership to the Water Resources Conference Committee
Last week, the House agreed to go to conference committee to work out
differences with the Senate on the Water Resources Reform & Development
Act (WRRDA), and Yours Truly was selected by the House leadership to be
one of the Democratic Conferees. I worked hard to include several
amendments for the 8th District in this important piece of legislation,
including one that would open up Duluth harbor to operate at 100%
capacity so tens of millions of dollars more in ore, timber, crops, and
manufactured goods can pass through the Port of Duluth to national and
international markets.
I was also able to insert two absolutely critical amendments closing
the St. Anthony Lock and Dam to protect our tourism & sport-fishing
industry on lakes like Mille Lacs and Gull Lake, as well as the Crow
Wing, Rum, Pine, and Mississippi Rivers, from invasive species such as
Asian carp and zebra mussels. I'll be doing everything I can to ensure
those amendments make it into the final bill. Read more about my
amendments here.
"Thank You For Your Service!"
Honoring Our Veterans in Pierz & Little Falls
Addressing the crowd of more than 1,500 residents of Pierz, MN, on
Veterans Day
This Veterans Day, I was proud to join more than 1,500 residents of
Pierz in their annual Veterans Day event, and later joined in the Color
Guard Ceremony at St. Otto's Care Center in Little Falls. As you can
tell from the photo above, the entire town came out to say thank you to
our vets. I told the crowd that when we send our best and brightest
into harm's way to protect and serve us, then our grateful nation has a
sacred obligation to protect and serve them when they return. A sacred
obligation to ensure they have the best medical and mental health
services, the best training for jobs worthy of their experience and
expertise, and the best support we can give them to build a home, raise
a family, and live the American dream of opportunity they sacrificed
and fought for. I've sponsored legislation to do each and every one of
these things.

Make It In America Tour Passes Through Park Rapids
On the production floor of Black Swan Barrels in Park Rapids during my
ongoing tour of 8th District manufacturers. 29-year-old owner Heidi
Karasch crafts customizable barrels based on her father's patented
barrel-making technology
While home in Crosby last week, I continued my ongoing tour of local
manufacturers and entrepreneurs with a stop first to the Park Rapids
Rotary Club to praise them for their efforts to eradicate polio around
the world (they've teamed up with UNICEF, the World Health
Organization, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation), and then with
a stop to Black Swan Barrels. Black Swan is owned by the amazing
29-year-old Heidi Karasch, who uses her father's patented technology to
give new life to the age-old artisan craft of barrel-making. What a
terrific example of makin' it in the 8th!
Climate Change and What We Can Do About It The science is clear. The
globe is getting warmer, the seas are rising higher, storms are
becoming more intense, and the cost in dollars ($136 billion federal
clean-up dollars last year alone, according to an analysis done by the
Center for American Progress using U.S. Treasury figures) and in lives
lost and damage is staggering. The question is, what can Americans and
their public policymakers do about it? We examined climate change and
its growing effects on our region and our planet, as well as some steps
we can all take, this past Saturday as I joined area climate and
environmental scientists and representatives from Minnesota's energy
industry in a public forum on climate change hosted by the University
of Minnesota-Duluth's Masters of Advocacy and Political Leadership
program and the Citizens Climate Lobby. Read more here
.
Honored by the Civil Air Patrol On Veterans Day I also visited the Crow
Wing Composite Squadron of the Civil Air Patrol to recognize and thank
them for the vital role the Squadron plays in search-and-rescue
operations and critical disaster relief missions. I was humbled to
accept their invitation to join the Congressional Squadron, comprised
of members of Congress and other federal officials. I plan to use my
honorary rank of lieutenant colonel to bring as much attention as I can
to the importance of CAP's service.
Outrageous! U.S. Loan to Australian Ore Project Threatens Range Jobs
U.S. companies should never be forced to compete with foreign
operations financed by U.S. funds. Yet in a move nothing short of
outrageous, the U.S. Export-Import Bank announced approval last week of
a $694-million loan to the Roy Hill Iron Ore Project, a huge Australian
operation that plans to double the amount of iron ore on the world
market. The result on Minnesota's Iron Range may well be lower iron ore
prices and lost jobs. Worse yet, the Roy Hill project is owned and
operated by Gina Rinehart, who, according to multiple sources, is one
of the richest women in the world. Congress has 35 days to comment on
the loan. Rest assured I will fight it every step of the way.
Nolan to Zelle: Hwy 169 South Route is Safest and Best Minnesota
Department of Transportation (MnDOT) Commissioner Charlie Zelle and I
met last week in Washington to again discuss rebuilding the 5.7-mile
Highway 169 Eagle's Nest Corridor between Tower and Ely. And once
again, I pointed out that local citizens and business people, safety
experts, and public officials all support the South Route in order to
fix that dangerous stretch of highway. The Commissioner promised our
strong support for the South Route would factor heavily in the
Department's final decision. I will stay on top of this matter and keep
you posted.

Briefly...
Last week I:
.
Co-sponsored the U.S. Call Center and Worker Protection Act
(H.R.2909), to keep call centers - and the good-paying jobs they
support - here in America. The bill would require businesses with more
than 50 employees to notify the Department of Labor if they move a call
center outside the U.S., and would also give customers who call the
company the option of speaking to someone in the U.S. if they request
it.
.
Sat down with Dr. Larry Goodwin, St. Scholastica College's
President, to discuss the latest happenings at this top-ranked college.
.
Met with General Frank J. Grass, 27th Chief of the National
Guard Bureau and a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Colonel
Chris Finnerty, to discuss the upcoming National Defense Authorization
Act.
.
Welcomed Melanie Benjamin, Chief Executive of the Mille Lacs
Band of Ojibwe, who was in Washington for the White House Tribal
Leaders Conference and stopped by my office to brief me on several
initiatives the Tribe is working on.
.
Voted against two bills (H.R.982 and H.R.2655) that would
have restricted an individual's right to sue (including victims of
asbestos-related diseases such as mesothelioma.)

On Tuesday, I'm co-hosting a discussion at the Capitol to
draw attention to domestic child sex-trafficking. Senator Orrin Hatch
(R-UT), Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Rep. David Reichert (R-WA),
will join me to discuss and share the "Our Daughters Are Not For Sale"
resolution to end the commercial sexual exploitation and trafficking of
children across the country.
.
This week we welcome families of the World War II Code
Talkers for a very special ceremony at the Capitol. The Code Talkers
were a select group of American Indians dispatched to critical combat
areas during World War II. Because their language was so obscure, they
were able to talk openly with each other over the radios, preventing
the Axis powers from knowing the American forces' movements. These Code
Talkers suffered heavy casualties on the front lines, and I'm proud to
be able to welcome members of the Fond du Lac Band to Washington this
week for the special recognition they deserve.

Small
Airplane
Bill
Heads
for
President's
Desk
Dear
Friend,
Despite
the
gridlock
and
partisanship
that
marks
Washington,
it&#8217;s
still
possible
to
get
things
done
and
help
create
good
middle-class
jobs
for
the
American
people.
Senator
Amy
Klobuchar
and
I
proved
it
again
last
week
when
our
bipartisan
bill
to
cut
red
tape
and
unleash
new
technologies
in
America&#8217;s
small
airplane
industry
passed
the
House
unanimously,
and
now
heads
for
the
President&#8217;s
desk
to
be
signed
into
law .
The
Small
Airplane
Revitalization
Act
of
2013
is
a
common-sense
measure
that
requires
the
Federal
Aviation
Administration
(FAA)
to
recognize
that
small,
high-technology
planes
like
those
produced
by
Cirrus
Aircraft
in
Duluth
should
be
viewed
and
regulated
differently
from
giant
airliners
that
carry
hundreds
of
people
across
thousands
of
miles.
For
example,
thanks
to
Cirrus
technology,
a
small
plane
can
deploy
a
parachute
and
float
back
to
Earth
if
engines
fail
&#8211;
obviously
impossible
for
a
747.
When
it
comes
to
aircraft,
one-size
regulation
does
not
fit
all.
By
getting
rid
of
outdated,
unnecessary
government
regulations,
this
bill
will
help
unleash
long-delayed
investment
to
produce
a
whole
new
generation
of
the
world&#8217;s
safest,
most
technologically-advanced
airplanes .
This
is
exactly
the
approach
we
need
to
take
across
the
board
to
encourage
"Make
It
In
America"
manufacturers
to
grow,
provide
more
good
jobs,
and
improve
our
quality
of
life .
We
will
keep
at
it
while
we
celebrate
this
victory
for
northern
Minnesota.
Have
a
great
week.
Voting to
Keep
A
Promise
In
northern
Minnesota,
where
I
grew
up
and
raised
my
family,
a
promise
made
is
a
promise
kept .
So
on
Friday,
I
joined
38
of
my
Democratic
colleagues
in
voting
YES
to
the
"Keep

Health
Plan
Act,"
which
would
honor
the
federal
government's
promise
to
allow
people
to keep
their
existing
health
insurance
plans
if
they
wish.
My
vote
was
about
keeping
that
promise
to
the
American
people.
And
it
was
about
allowing
those
whose
policies
were
cancelled
to
have
more
time
to
consider
what
will
hopefully
be
better,
less

alternatives
available
under
the
Affordable

Moreover,
the
bill
I
supported
is
very
similar
to
what
the

to
do
administratively .
It
would
provide
a
one
year
extension
in
a
more
inclusive
fashion
that
treats
all
Americans
alike.
I
think
this
will
move
us
in
the
right
direction,
and
I'm
glad
to
see
that
for
the
first
time,
some
of
my
colleagues
in
the
House
are
working
on
fixing
and
improving
the
Affordable
Care
Act ,
rather
than
trying
to
repeal
it.
We
need
to
put
aside
politics
and
partisanship
and
provide
Americans
with
the
health
care
they
need
and
deserve.

Climate

About
It
The
science
is

The

are
becoming

and

is,
what
can

I
was
humbled
to
accept
their
invitation
to
join
the

I
plan
to

as
I
can
to
the
importance
of

Yet
in
a
move
nothing
short
of
outrageous,
the
U.S.
Export-Import
Bank
announced
approval
last
week
of
a
$694-million
loan
to
the
Roy
Hill
Iron
Ore
Project,
a
huge
Australian
operation
that
plans
to
double
the
amount
of
iron
ore
on
the
world
market.
The
result
on
Minnesota&#8217;s
Iron
Range
may
well
be
lower
iron
ore
prices
and
lost
jobs .
Worse
yet,
the
Roy
Hill
project
is
owned
and
operated
by
Gina
Rinehart,
who,
according
to
multiple
sources,
is
one
of
the
richest
women
in
the
world.
Congress
has
35
days
to
comment
on
the
loan.
Rest
assured
I
will
fight
it
every
step
of
the
way.

Mille
Lacs
Band
of
Ojibwe ,
who
was
in
Washington
for
the
White
House
Tribal
Leaders
Conference
and
stopped
by
my
office
to
brief
me
on
several
initiatives
the
Tribe
is
working
on.
&#8226;
Voted
against
two
bills
(H.R.982
and
H.R.2655)
that
would
have
restricted
an
individual's
right
to
sue
(including
victims
of
asbestos-related
diseases
such
as
mesothelioma.)

On
Tuesday,
I'm
co-hosting a
discussion
at
the
Capitol
to
draw
attention
to
domestic
child
sex-trafficking.
Senator
Orrin
Hatch
(R-UT),
Senator
Dick
Durbin
(D-IL),
and
Rep.
David
Reichert
(R-WA),
will
join
me
to
discuss
and
share
the
"Our
Daughters
Are
Not
For
Sale"
resolution
to
end
the
commercial
sexual
exploitation
and
trafficking
of
children
across
the
country.

This
week
we
welcome
families
of
the
World
War
II
Code
Talkers
for
a
very
special
ceremony
at
the
Capitol.
The
Code
Talkers
were
a
select
group
of
American
Indians
dispatched
to
critical
combat
areas
during
World
War
II.
Because
their
language
was
so
obscure,
they
were
able
to
talk
openly
with
each
other
over
the
radios,
preventing
the
Axis
powers
from
knowing
the
American
forces'
movements.
These
Code
Talkers
suffered
heavy
casualties
on
the
front
lines,
and
I'm
proud
to
be
able
to
welcome
members
of
the
Fond
du
Lac Band
to
Washington
this
week
for
the
special
recognition
they
deserve.

Up

Hard
to
believe,
but
we've
already
had
over
225
Congress
Comes
to
You
Meetings
throughout
our
8th
District
-
and
we've
got
even
more
planned
before
the
year
is
out.
Be
sure
to
visit
my
website
often
to
check
when
my
intrepid
district
team
will
be
in
your
town
to
help
you
with
any
question
or
issue:

Finally...
Hope you
all
had
a
safe
and
successful
deer
opener! As
a
member
of
the
Congressional
Sportsmen's
Caucus,
I
make
sure
proper
attire
and
gun
safety
are
top
priorities
while
we
hunt.
