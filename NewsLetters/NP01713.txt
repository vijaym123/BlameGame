Working with Colorado
Colleagues to Solve the VA Hospital
Mess
3/31/15
This
week, Congressman Doug Lamborn has partnered with Senator Cory Gardner and
Congressman Mike Coffman (CO-06) on the VA Hospital Construction,
Accountability, and Reform Act. This legislation is designed to address
the failures plaguing the construction of a new VA Hospital in Aurora,
Colorado.
"The Colorado
Congressional Delegation is deeply troubled by the mismanagement and
waste that has gone on during the VA Hospital fiasco. We are dedicated to
finding solutions that bring this much needed resource to completion.
That's why I'm pleased to partner with Senator Gardner and
Congressman Coffman on good legislation designed to move beyond the failures of
the past on put us on the pathway to state of the art healthcare for
the brave veterans who have earned this
benefit."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
(CO-05)
Legislative Information
Increases the cap on
the Aurora, Colorado VA replacement medical facility.
This
measure would prevent another abrupt work stoppage which will add as much as
$100M to the final cost.
The authorized spending cap on the
project will be reached in mid-May.
Prohibits VA from awarding any bonuses until the project is
completed.
This measure offers enough funding to offset the budget
should supplemental appropriations be necessary.
Additionally,
freeing up these funds would enable the VA to fund the hospital without
seeking substantial reprogramming from other construction projects, a
move that could delay hospital construction in other
states.
Strips VAs authority to build medical
facilities costing more than $10 million.
The VA will never again
be placed in a position to waste over $1 billion of Americans tax
dollars on a mismanaged construction project ever again.
Moreover,
the Associated General Contractors of America recently announced their
position that VAs construction program should be moved to a more
capable federal agency.
Requires the GAO to review VAs internal Administrative Investigation
Board on the project for thoroughness and accuracy. The review will also
look into when senior VA officials knew about the substantial cost
overruns and why that information was withheld from
Congress.
