Dear Friends:
This week I decided to set the record straight
the record of repeated abuses of
executive authority by the Obama
Administration. In a speech on the Senate
Floor I outlined a pattern of executive overreach
on a number of topics, from the Department of
Justices recent push for mass clemency, to
the Department of Homeland Securitys
refusal to enforce immigration laws, to the
administration's repeated violation of statutory
provisions contained in the Presidents
health care law.
Unfortunately executive abuses have become all
too common under this Administration, especially
since President Obama announced his new
pen and phone strategy of
unilateral action specifically designed to bypass
Congress and evade constitutional
restraints. It is essential to the
continued well-being of our nation, to the
legitimacy of our government, and to the
liberties of our citizens, that the exercise of
executive power is kept within lawful
bounds. Doing so requires continual
vigilance
by the court, by Congress, and
by the American people
to uphold the
standards of the Constitution.
To read the entire speech, please visit
here.
And as always please do not hesitate to
contact me with any concerns or suggestions you
may have to address the issues facing our state
and nation.
Sincerely,
Orrin Hatch
