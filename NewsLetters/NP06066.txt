Friend,
I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I&rsquo;m tired of seeing these emails from other campaigns:
We&rsquo;re giving up.
We&rsquo;re going home.
Throwing in the towel.
Turning off the lights.
Other races may be quitting&mdash;but we&rsquo;re fighting back.
We&rsquo;re going to win this&mdash;because of people like you.
Yes, the outside groups may be pouring money into our race, but we&rsquo;re giving this all we&rsquo;ve got.
Join me in fighting back today: pitch in $5 to help us exceed our goal by midnight on Tuesday.
We shouldn&rsquo;t be throwing in the towel.
We should be using every resource we have to run a smarter, more aggressive campaign.
We&rsquo;re fighting for a brighter future for our families&mdash;and I can tell you that my team isn&rsquo;t quitting on that.
We&rsquo;re locked in one of the toughest races in the country, but we&rsquo;re optimistic and we&rsquo;re working harder than our opponent.
We have $11,595 left to raise to hit our goal
on Tuesday .
Can you help us with $5 right now?
I won&rsquo;t be sending you any emails about going home, because I have faith that our grassroots support can overcome these special interest groups who are dumping in millions.
Instead, let&rsquo;s stand together and tell them: Bring it on.
We&rsquo;re ready.
Here&rsquo;s to the fight ahead,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
P.S.
Giving up isn&rsquo;t who we are, especially when there&rsquo;s so much on the line.
Let&rsquo;s use these challenges to motivate us and push us forward &ndash; towards victory in November.
Click here to help us hit our goal by the deadline
on Tuesday .
