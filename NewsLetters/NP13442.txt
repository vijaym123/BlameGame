Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
The
holiday season can be a complicated one; but what I love best about this
time of year is the reminder about the simplicity in life, and of what
is truly important to us. Our Founding Fathers summarized in one
sentence no more profound or truer words about priorities:
that
all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator
with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and
the pursuit of Happiness.
Those words are so simple, and yet
so fundamental to who we are as individuals and as a
nation.
Unfortunately, the gridlock that rules Washington often affects us,
our fellow citizens, and those serving our nation. This week though,
there was progress in getting the business of the nation done as the
House passed H.J.Res.59, the Bipartisan Budget Act.
First, I want
you to know that I was vehemently opposed to the provision (Section
403) in this legislation that affects military retirees. I had several
frank conversations with Members of House Leadership prior to this
bill coming to the floor for a vote to let them know of my concerns --
that we cannot and should not balance the budget on the backs of the
servicemembers who have given their all for our country. Furthermore, I
am taking immediate action to repeal this provision through legislation
to restore the cost of living reduction.
While I was opposed
to the military retiree provision, I ultimately voted in favor of
H.J.Res. 59 because it restores over $31 billion of sequestration cuts to
our military in Fiscal Year 2014 and 2015.
As the Chairman of
the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness, I have been
watching the devastating impact the sequester cuts are having on our
servicemembers.
I am also distressingly alarmed about the increased risk
they face because of insufficient training and not being properly
equipped.
In recent weeks I led numerous briefings to educate
Members on the effects of sequester cuts to our nations military. Members
learned the devastating effects of these cuts on training and
equipping those who serve our nation in uniform. It is the Constitutional duty
of the Congress to provide for our nations defense, and this bill
restores some of the indiscriminate cuts decimating our nations defense
needs.
I feel it is my duty to ensure that our all-volunteer
force is properly trained and equipped; this bill takes a significant
step toward that end.
My best to you, your family and
friends for a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
