Dear Friend,
This Thanksgiving week, an in-district work week, gave me an
opportunity to visit with constituents in Sedalia to listen to their
concerns.
A visit to Bothwell Regional Health Center gave me a chance to see the
new Cancer and Cardiovascular Center and hear about the great new care
options for people in our district.
I was impressed and glad to see
such a wonderful facility helping so many families in our area.
Bothwell Regional Health Center is the second largest employer in
Pettis County. - providing valuable health care services to citizens of
Pettis and neighboring counties.
I am so pleased that this quality
care is available to them.
I also appreciated the opportunity hear from health care professionals
regarding some of the impact they are feeling and will continue to feel
from the President's health care law. Hospital administrators informed
me they had estimated the Affordable Care Act would cost them $22
million over seven years. Renewed estimates now put that cost at
approximately $35 million - much of it due to huge reductions in
Medicare reimbursement under the new law. This will be a challenge for
many hospitals to navigate unless it can be changed and one of the
reasons I believe this law needs to be repealed and replaced with a
better system that lowers costs while increasing access for all.
In
the meantime, I commend all the dedicated professionals at Bothwell
Regional and wish them much success with their new facility.

My Sedalia visit gave me an opportunity to call on State Fair Community
College (SFCC)'s new President, Dr. Joanna Anderson. She comes with a
wealth of experience in community college leadership and a heart for
Missouri higher education as she is originally from Missouri.
SFCC is
a public, non-profit college that offers high quality education to more
than 5,000 students - primarily at the Sedalia campus but also with
classes offered in Boonville, Clinton, Lake of the Ozarks, Warsaw,
Eldon, and at Whiteman Air Force Base. State Fair Community College has
agreements with four-year schools that ensure credit earned at SFCC
transfers to those institutions, as well. It is a wonderful asset to
the community.
At the Pettis County Courthouse in downtown Sedalia, the 40 & 8 Honor
Society of Veterans presented me with a petition urging me to do what I
can to ensure that the brave service members who were victims of the
2009 terrorist attack by U.S. Army Major Nidal Hasan at Fort Hood,
Texas, receive the benefits they have earned. The petition reads, in
part:"We the undersigned members of Voiture 333, 40 & 8 Honor Society
of Veterans, Sedalia, Missouri, petition and urge you to actively
support any and all legislative efforts . to re-classify the Fort Hood
attack to what it was - a terrorist attack / combat action, and to
properly award the Purple Heart Medal to the victims (posthumously) and
survivors of this horrendous attack, thus ensuring their proper
current, and future, veterans benefits commensurate with their service
and sacrifice in a combat action during a time of war, and undoing this
erroneous and unjust classification of 'workplace violence' by the
Department of Defense."
Congresswoman Hartzler receives petition from 40 & 8 Honor Society of
Veterans on steps of Pettis County Courthouse
There is no doubt this was an act of terrorism. It is only appropriate
that the victims of this horrific act, committed by a man who
acknowledged engaging in an act of jihad, receive the benefits they
have so justly earned. I have co-sponsored H.R. 3111 to address this
injustice and look forward to taking their petitions back to Washington
to help secure its passage.

veterans, including 93-year-old Julie Arnold (left), the first woman
admitted into the 40 & 8
It was an honor to meet with so many veterans who came out on a cold
day in Sedalia to ask for justice. I am committed to working with my
congressional colleagues to have this terrorist act re-classified as an
act of war. We owe these Fort Hood heroes no less.
Before leaving Sedalia, I spoke to the Sedalia Rotary Club, sharing an
update on important legislation in Washington. Among the issues raised
by Rotary Club members was the progress of the Farm Bill. As a member
of the House Agriculture Committee, I am looking forward to seeing the
outcome of a House-Senate conference committee that is trying to iron
out the differences in the two chambers' versions of this important
legislation. I remain cautiously optimistic that an agreement can be
reached before the end of the year to protect both consumers and
farmers while maintaining America's safe, plentiful, and affordable
food supply.
Finally, Americans throughout our country are joining family and
friends this Thanksgiving weekend to celebrate and to thank our Creator
for the blessings we enjoy living in the greatest nation on earth.
Many of us learned, as children, that the first Thanksgiving was
observed at Plymouth following the harvest of 1621. The Pilgrims had
endured a perilous first year and were grateful for God's provision and
faithfulness.
We also learned that the first Thanksgiving recognized by the U.S.
government came during the Civil War when President Lincoln issued a
proclamation in October of 1863, reminding all of us that our nation's
many blessings 'should be solemnly reverently and gratefully
acknowledged as with one heart and voice by the whole American people.'
This year marks 150 years since he penned those words, yet their truth
remains. We have been blessed with fruitful fields, industry and
technology second to none, strong communities, caring neighbors,
unparalleled opportunity, and the gift of freedom. A loving and
Almighty God has blessed this nation and its people.
As we gather this Thanksgiving weekend family and friends, let us give
thanks to God for all He has given us. Let us also thank the brave men
and women of the U.S. Armed Forces whose sacrifices preserve our
freedoms and allow us to enjoy God's bounty.
Have a great week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler

Dear
Friend,
This
Thanksgiving
week,
an
in-district
work
week,
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
visit
with
constituents
in
Sedalia
to
listen
to
their
concerns.
A
visit
to
Bothwell
Regional
Health
Center
gave
me
a
chance
to
see
the
new
Cancer
and
Cardiovascular
Center
and
hear
about
the
great
new
care
options
for
people
in
our
district.
I
was
impressed
and
glad
to
see
such
a
wonderful
facility
helping
so
many
families
in
our
area.
Bothwell
Regional
Health
Center
is
the
second
largest
employer
in
Pettis
County.
-
providing
valuable
health
care
services
to
citizens
of
Pettis
and
neighboring
counties.
I
am
so
pleased
that
this
quality
care
is
available
to
them.
I
also
appreciated
the
opportunity
hear
from
health
care
professionals
regarding
some
of
the
impact
they
are
feeling
and
will
continue
to
feel
from
the
President&#8217;s
health
care
law.
Hospital
administrators
informed
me
they
had
estimated the
Affordable
Care
Act would
cost
them
$22
million
over
seven
years.
Renewed
estimates
now
put
that
cost
at
approximately
$35
million
&#8211;
much
of
it
due
to
huge
reductions
in
Medicare
reimbursement
under
the
new
law.
This
will
be
a
challenge
for
many
hospitals
to
navigate
unless
it
can
be
changed
and
one
of
the
reasons
I
believe
this
law
needs
to
be
repealed
and
replaced
with
a
better
system
that
lowers
costs
while
increasing
access
for
all.
In
the
meantime,
I
commend
all
the
dedicated
professionals
at
Bothwell
Regional
and
wish
them much
success
with
their
new
facility.

Congresswoman
Hartzler
receives
petition
from
40

Honor
Society
of
Veterans
on
steps
of
Pettis
County
Courthouse
There
is
no
doubt
this
was
an
act
of
terrorism.
It
is
only
appropriate
that
the
victims
of
this
horrific
act,
committed
by
a
man
who
acknowledged
engaging
in
an
act
of
jihad,
receive
the
benefits
they
have
so
justly
earned.
I
have
co-sponsored
H.R.
3111
to
address
this
injustice
and
look
forward
to
taking
their
petitions
back
to
Washington
to
help
secure
its
passage.
At
the

Courthouse,

including
93-year-old
Julie
Arnold
(left),
the
first
woman
admitted
into

It
was
an
honor
to
meet
with
so
many
veterans
who
came
out
on
a
cold
day
in
Sedalia
to
ask
for
justice.
I
am
committed
to
working
with
my
congressional
colleagues
to
have
this
terrorist
act
re-classified
as
an
act
of
war.
We
owe
these
Fort
Hood
heroes
no
less.
Before
leaving
Sedalia,
I
spoke
to
the
Sedalia
Rotary
Club,
sharing
an
update
on
important
legislation
in
Washington.
Among
the
issues
raised
by
Rotary
Club
members
was
the
progress
of
the
Farm
Bill.
As
a
member
of
the
House
Agriculture
Committee,
I
am
looking
forward
to
seeing
the
outcome
of
a
House-Senate
conference
committee
that
is
trying
to
iron
out
the
differences
in
the
two
chambers&#8217;
versions
of
this
important
legislation.
I
remain
cautiously
optimistic
that
an
agreement
can
be
reached
before
the
end
of
the
year
to
protect
both
consumers
and
farmers
while
maintaining
America&#8217;s
safe,
plentiful,
and
affordable
food
supply.
Finally,
Americans
throughout
our
country
are
joining
family
and
friends
this
Thanksgiving
weekend
to
celebrate
and
to
thank
our
Creator
for
the
blessings
we
enjoy
living
in
the
greatest
nation
on
earth.
Many
of
us
learned,
as
children,
that
the
first
Thanksgiving
was
observed
at
Plymouth
following
the
harvest
of
1621.
The
Pilgrims
had
endured
a
perilous
first
year
and
were
grateful
for
God&#8217;s
provision
and
faithfulness.
We
also
learned
that
the
first
Thanksgiving
recognized
by
the
U.S.
government
came
during
the
Civil
War
when
President
Lincoln
issued
a
proclamation
in
October
of
1863,
reminding
all
of
us
that
our
nation&#8217;s
many
blessings
&#8216;should
be
solemnly
reverently
and
gratefully
acknowledged
as
with
one
heart
and
voice
by
the
whole
American
people.&#8217;
This
year
marks
150
years
since
he
penned
those
words,
yet
their
truth
remains.
We
have
been
blessed
with
fruitful
fields,
industry
and
technology
second
to
none,
strong
communities,
caring
neighbors,
unparalleled
opportunity,
and
the
gift
of
freedom.
A
loving
and
Almighty
God
has
blessed
this
nation
and
its
people.
As
we
gather
this
Thanksgiving
weekend
family
and
friends,
let
us
give
thanks
to
God
for
all
He
has
given
us.
Let
us
also
thank
the
brave
men
and
women
of
the
U.S.
Armed
Forces
whose
sacrifices
preserve
our
freedoms
and
allow
us
to
enjoy
God&#8217;s
bounty.
Have
a
great
week.
