Dear Friends,
America faces many challenges. But the
greatest challenge we face today is leaving our country better than we
found it so our children and grandchildren
like my grandsons, Liam and
Kaden
can live the American dream, too. As we fight to restore
fiscal responsibility and government accountability in Washington, I
could not be more grateful to represent you and the people of
Arkansass Third District. During this Christmas Season, I am reminded of what
a blessing this is.
Thank you.
I look forward to
continuing to work on your behalf in the coming Congress to get America
back on track and preserve our great nation for our children and
grandchildren.
Merry
Christmas!
Congressman Steve Womack
