I know everyone on earth has been emailing you. But please read this one from start to finish -- it&rsquo;s incredibly important: Six Democratic women
Friend -- I know everyone on earth has been emailing you.
But please read this one from start to finish
-- it&rsquo;s incredibly important:
Six Democratic women have an opportunity to shatter the Senate&rsquo;s glass ceiling on Election Day.
SIX!
If they win, we&rsquo;d completely derail a Tea Party takeover. It&rsquo;d be a heartbreaking loss for the Republicans.
We could win the South and utterly transform the political landscape. Would the GOP ever recover from such a massive setback?
But you&rsquo;re running out of time to make it happen. The election is in just 12 DAYS. And with GOP financiers pouring in last-minute millions, we need Democrats like you to step up.
Friend, will you pitch in today to help Democrats mobilize voters, win in key battlegrounds, and send six incredible women to the Senate?
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
or donate another amount.
I can&rsquo;t overstate how disastrous a Mitch McConnell-led Senate would be for women and families. Equal pay? Forget it. Minimum wage raise? Not a chance. Birth control? Be prepared to ask your boss.
But we can STOP McConnell&rsquo;s takeover if we can fully fund our unprecedented voter mobilization program.
Our staff and volunteers are ready to go in must-win states. All we need is YOU.
Will you pitch in? We have almost no time left -- if you&rsquo;re going to step up, please do it now!
Thank you,
Senator Patty Murray
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
