LEGISLATION
June 07, 2015
Dear David,
Dozens of health insurers selling plans under Obamacare are planning
steep premium increases for 2016, according to
information released by the Obama Administration
last
Monday.
Although premium increases range significantly, most premium fee
increases are in the double digits. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North
Carolina have planned a
26 percent premium
increase , which would impact
397,000
customers . In New Mexico, Health Care Service Corp. is asking for an
average hike of
51.6 percent
in
premiums next year, and Alliant Health Plans in Georgia is seeking
increases as high as
85 percent
for some of their
plans. To check on the proposed premium increases for your insurance,
click here . Final premium rates for 2016 will be
disclosed in November.

Story Since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, have you been
satisfied with the quality of your health care? What
action do you think Congress and the President should
take? Repeal the entire law
and replace it with pro-patient, free market reforms. Go through the law piece by piece
to improve it. Leave the law as is. Overall, how would you rank Obamacare? A success.
A failure. Somewhere in between. Please share any
