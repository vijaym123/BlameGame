Dear
David,
Happy New Year! The new Congress officially kicked off the new
year with a lot of activity.
I was able to enjoy some special
moments with my daughters who joined me for the swearing-in
ceremony.
There were big bipartisan votes on
veterans
initiatives ,
health care reform , and
building the Keystone pipeline
to help North American
energy and our economy.
Check out some of the video links and
photos below to see some of my activities, which included:
holding a press conference with colleagues to repeal the medical
device tax ;
taking action on health care
reform ;
speaking on the House floor for our law
enforcement community ; and take a look at
this weeks
edition of Eriks Correspondence Corner .
Please contact
me if I can be of help to you or your family in any way. Join the
conversation online by visiting my
website ,
Facebook page ,
Twitter , and don't
forget to watch my weekly video,
Erik's
Correspondence Corner .
Sincerely,
Erik Paulsen
