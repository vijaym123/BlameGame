Riverside County Reaches Health Care Enrollment Milestone
Last week, Covered CA announced that Riverside County has attained 103%
of its enrollment goal. From October 1, 2013, to February 28, 2014,
41,756 Riverside County consumers enrolled in Covered California health
insurance plans, surpassing its six-month enrollment goal of 40,377.
In the release, Covered CA detailed adjustments made to increase the
enrollment rate saying, "The impressive pace of enrollments in the
Inland Empire is due in part to enhanced aspects of Covered California's
customer service. The agency has increased staff to answer consumer
calls, added phone lines, improved its website efficiency, expanded its
live Web chat function and upgraded its Spanish-language Web pages.
DHCS is continuing its work with counties and Covered California to
process the vast number of applications and quickly deliver health
coverage to all who are eligible."
Upon the release of the figures, Rep. Mark Takano said, "The recently
released enrollment figures from Covered CA further prove the need for
the ACA in Riverside County. With more than 24 percent of my
constituent's uninsured, the need for affordable health care in our
community is high and the recently released numbers reflect that need,
as enrollments have surged. I am happy to see that we have reached our
six-month goal and I encourage anyone who has yet to enroll to do so by
next Monday."

Rep. Takano Holds "When Women Succeed" Event
Last week, Rep. Takano held an event at Moreno Valley Community College
titled "When Women Succeed, America Succeeds."
During the event, Takano discussed the biggest economic challenges
facing women and family saying, "American women have made great
strides, but we all know there is still much more to be done. 'When
Women Succeed, America Succeeds' is an economic agenda that builds on
the work that was done in Seneca Falls and hopes to address the needs
of working women and families."

Rep. Takano Op-Ed: Our Kids Deserve Much Better
Last week, Rep. Takano wrote an op-ed for the Orange County Register
titled, "Our Kids Deserve Much Better." In it, Takano debunked some of
the recycled scare tactics and advocated for meaningful reforms to our
education system.
"Prior to being elected to Congress, I worked for 23 years as a teacher
in the Rialto Unified School District where I taught predominantly
low-income Latino and African American students. Even now, I am
maintaining my teaching credentials and will always make teaching - in
one way or another - part of what I do. Teachers are overworked and
underpaid; the line is a bit clich, but it is still true. For those of
us who teach, it is more than a job; it's a calling, a career and a
life-long commitment. It is the classroom teacher who is on the
front-line, working to address the deep and complex issues our schools
and student are facing. We do it because we want to give back to our
communities and see future generations succeed.
But even our best teachers sometimes come up short, often because we
aren't providing the tools and training they need to get better.
However, instead of moving to support educators, Gov. Bush and his
allies advocate for a punitive response.
It's just not true that teachers and their workforce protections are to
blame for increased turnover and lower educational quality in our
poorest schools.
Rather, this is a systemwide teacher placement issue. Our schools,
regardless of location, socioeconomic makeup, or other demographic,
should strive for a balance of new teachers and veteran teachers, and
it is up to administrators to make sure that is achieved."

Takano recently sent letters to the Consumer Financial Protection

Financial Research requesting information about single family rental
backed securities.
In the letters, Rep. Takano said, "I am writing to bring to your
attention the recent increase in investor owned rental properties and
the development of single family rental backed securities and ask that
your agencies address unanswered questions about these new financial
products"."I believe that your offices are perfectly positioned to
provide further details on these new financial products and the impact
they could have on homeowners and renters."

&#8220;The
