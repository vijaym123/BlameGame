Affordable Care Act funds to CHCC hit $42 m., $67 million still available
New Medicaid funding from the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, drawn down by the Commonwealth reached $41,982,993 as of this week. The ACA provided $109 million in new Medicaid money to the Northern Marianas. So we still have another $67 million available between now and the end of 2019. The money pays for the medical care of some 15,000 lower-income Northern Mariana Islanders. This Affordable Care Act money is in addition to the regular Medicaid funding of $15 million and Childrens Health Insurance Program funding of $3 million we have received over the last three years. Without these federal funds
$60 million in all
it would have been very difficult to keep our hospital open after the CNMI government stopped underwriting the costs of CHC.

Marvin Tamangided of Dr. Rita Inos Jr./Sr. High School is our new State Teacher of the Year. I attended the awards dinner at which, also, Preston Basa of Marianas High School was announced State Teacher Aide of the Year and Norissa Camacho of Kagman High School was named State Instructor of the Year. Each public school selects its own nominees for the distinction; and I presented a congressional certificate of commendation to all of these fine people, who guide our childrens lives and learning.

The Commonwealth Development Authority is managing $13.1 million in funds Congress made available in the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. The money can provide cash collateral when a business wants a bank loan or allows CDA to buy part of a loan as another way of encouraging banks to lend. Over 125 individuals attended a CDA expo on the program last Saturday.
NMI businesses benefiting from federal credit funds
Local banks and businesses turned out in force on Saturday to learn about the $13.1 million in credit available in the Northern Marianas through the U.S. Treasurys State Small Business Credit Initiative. President Obama proposed the program in January 2010, as part of the ongoing effort to lift the nation out of recession; and the Democratic Congress passed the measure in September of that year. Treasury phoned me in November concerned that the Commonwealth had not yet applied to be a participating state. I alerted the Governor that the 60-day window of opportunity was closing and the CNMI got on board. So it was good to see, four years later, the program now working and the Commonwealth Development Authority encouraging more participation. Nationally, 61 percent of available funds have been deployed. Here, only about 3 percent is in use; and we will lose access to the remainder, if most of the first $4 million is not committed by June 2015. Any SSBCI funds that are successfully used will remain available for Commonwealth businesses in perpetuity. Treasurys annual report on SSBCI is available here . For more information about the program locally contact Aaron Wood at loan@cda.gov.mp
or by calling 670.234.6245 x 306/308.

Medicare Open Enrollment is here
The Medicare Open Enrollment period has begun and runs until December 7. For those in a Medicare health or prescription drug plan, it's a chance to review current coverage, compare current coverage with other options, and make changes for the next year. If changes are made to coverage, new coverage plans will start on January 1. If current coverage satisfies needs and is still being offered, there is no need to do anything. If a friend or family member of yours is in a Medicare health or prescription drug plan, we encourage you to share this message with them. You can enroll in Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) and/or Medicare Part B (medical insurance) in the following ways:
Online at http://socialsecurity.gov./.
By calling Social Security at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY users 1-800-0778), Monday through Friday, from 7AM to 7PM EST.
In person at your local Social Security office.

In light of Ebola Senate should confirm Surgeon General
Our country needs all hands on deck to respond to public health threats, such as the Ebola virus. But the Senate has been sitting on President Obamas nomination for Surgeon General of the United States for almost a year. Dr. Vivek Murthy has the strong backing of the Pacific Islander, Native Hawaiian, and Asian American communities, as expressed by the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus and by the Asian & Pacific Islander American Health Forum. And this week I joined 90 other Members of the U.S. House of Representatives in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also urging the confirmation
of the Presidents nominee. We all want to know that our government is on top of the Ebola threat. But with the Surgeon Generals office vacant we feel less secure. The Senate will have the opportunity to act when Congress returns to work after the November election. back to top

This week Mrs. Remedio Diaz and her children accepted a flag flown in honor of her husband and their father Mayor Francisco Diaz.
The late Francisco Diaz was elected the 6th Mayor of the Municipality of Saipan in November of 1977 and served from January 8, 1978 to January 7, 1982. Mayor Diaz continued to serve his community for many years after leaving office as a volunteer and civic leader.
For his distinguished service to the people of the Northern Mariana Islands we recognize his commitment to our community and for improving the lives of all the people in our islands.
NOAA rule supports fishery development in the NMI
This week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued its final rule
allowing the Commonwealth government to sell a portion of its quota to U.S. vessels with the proceeds to be used to support fishery development projects in our community. Under the rule, the NMI and other territories are each allowed a catch limit of 2,000 metric tons, for longline bigeye tuna and may transfer up to 1,000 metric tons of that limit to U.S. longline fishing vessels based in other U.S. territories or Hawaii. The Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council, which includes council members from the NMI, will annually review and recommend to NOAA the catch and allocation limits for the next fishing year. Previously, NOAA had not implemented annual catch limits for bigeye tuna in the territories because the historical level of catch in each territory was so low or near zero.

NMI power plants fall under carbon rule thresholds
As a follow up to their proposed guidelines for states to reduce carbon pollution from existing power plants, the Environmental Protection Agency has released this week their supplemental emission guidelines proposal
but for Puerto Rico and Guam only. In this supplemental action, EPA determined that the power plants in the NMI did not have 25 MW (megawatt) units and even if they did, EPA is only proposing limits for certain energy generating units, which does not include diesel units that the NMI uses. According to EPA, during the past five years, they have had no Clean Air Act investigation or enforcement action involving the Commonwealth Utility Corporation. The NMI is the third lowest in the nation in releasing toxic chemicals into the air. In addition to seeking comments for the supplemental carbon goals for territories, EPA is seeking public comments on their notice of data availability which is a compilation of ideas and information submitted by a broad range of stakeholders since proposing the Clean Power Plan
in June. Comments for the notice of data availability
and supplemental plan are due by December 1 and 19, respectively. You may submit your comments via email at A-and-R-Docket@epa.gov
or through the federal eRulemaking portal , and include Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2013-0602 on the subject line.
