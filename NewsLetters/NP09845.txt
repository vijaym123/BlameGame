Do you think there should be a Select Committee on Benghazi?
Yes - The House of Representatives needs to find the truth about
Benghazi
Maybe - If it is going to be established, it must include an equal
number of Democrats and Republicans working together to ensure the
bipartisan review of every single piece of evidence
No - The House of Representatives has spent too much time and money
investigating; we have all the answers

Monday night marked the 66thanniversary of Israel's independence, known
as Yom Ha'atzmaut. With the darkness of the Holocaust still fresh in
the mind of the world, the State of Israel was formed as a shining
beacon of freedom and democracy.
As the son of Jewish immigrants, I am especially proud to point out
that the United States was the first country to recognize the new
nation of Israel.
Since 1948, Israel has persevered against threats large and small,
while at the same time building a thriving, dynamic, innovative economy.
Today, we are proud of our unbreakable bonds with Israel, built on our
common foundation of freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of
law.
Israel is without question the United States' closest ally in the
region, and one of our closest friends in the world.
The Israeli people continue to be a symbol of democratic courage in the
Middle East and around the world.
I am reminded of the words of President John F. Kennedy, who said,
"Israel was not created in order to disappear-Israel will endure and
flourish. It is the child of hope and home of the brave. It can neither
be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success. It carries the
shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom."
SB I-710 Connector Closing On May 10th
As part of the nearly $1 billion Gerald Desmond Bridge Replacement
Project, the I-710 (Long Beach) Freeway connector to westbound Ocean
Boulevard on Terminal Island will be closed for approximately 30
months. The route will be diverted onto southbound Pico Avenue, then to
westbound Ocean Boulevard.

Commemorating Fallen FBI Agents
This week, representatives from my district staff attended the 28th
Annual Memorial Service at the Federal Building Headquarters in West
Los Angeles that honored those in law enforcement who have lost their
lives in the line of duty.
While I could not attend because votes were being held in Washington,
D.C., my staff relayed to me that it was a very moving ceremony
complete with bagpipes and the ringing of a bell, and a processional of
family members with a picture of their loved one and a yellow rose for
each of the sixty fallen law enforcement officers.
Letting the People Draw the Lines
On Tuesday, I spoke at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia
about gerrymandering. My bill, the "Let the People Draw the Lines Act,"
would eliminate gerrymandering as we know it and sets clear and uniform
national guidelines for redistricting that require each state to put in
place independent citizen panels to draw new congressional districts
every ten years.

The National Climate Assessment
The White House recently released its 2014 National Climate Assessment,
which calls for urgent action to combat human-caused climate change.
This is not a war on any industry, nor is this a political game. These
are our lives and the lives of our children and grandchildren.
The science is conclusive - climate change is happening. We must act on
climate now before it is too late. I will keep fighting until Congress
finally acts to curb climate change.

"Select Committee"
This week, the House voted to set up a Select Committee to investigate
the 2011 attacks on the U.S. facilities in Benghazi. A special, or
"select," committee is usually tasked with investigating or addressing
a very specific issue, such as the attack on 9/11, the Watergate
scandal, or in this case the Benghazi attacks. Select Committee members
are announced by the Speaker of the House, and then the House of
Representatives must vote on a House Resolution to approve the
committee's establishment.
Once approved, the Select Committee is then recognized as any other
congressional committee. This means that they are allowed to hold
hearings, debate, and vote on pieces of legislation related to their
investigation or issue.
(I voted against the newly-formed Select Committee on Benghazi because
it did not include an equal number of Democrats and Republicans, which
would ensure a bipartisan review of the evidence.)
Should the Veterans Benefits Administration hire more staff to process
the overwhelmingly large number of backlogged claims?
81.0% Yes - We must do anything we can to help our Veterans
15.2% Maybe - The Veterans Benefits Administration should find a way to
address the issue without hiring more paid staff
0.0% No - It will cost too much money
3.8% I do not know

&#8220;Select
Committee&#8221;
This
week,
the
House
voted
to
set
up
a
Select
Committee
to
investigate
the
2011
attacks
on
the
U.S.
facilities
in
Benghazi.
A
special,
or
&#8220;select,&#8221;
committee
is
usually
tasked
with
investigating
or
addressing
a
very
specific
issue,
such
as
the
attack
on
9/11,
the
Watergate
scandal,
or
in
this
case
the
Benghazi
attacks.
Select
Committee
members
are
announced
by
the
Speaker
of
the
House,
and
then
the
House
of
Representatives
must
vote
on
a
House
Resolution
to
approve
the
committee&#8217;s
establishment.
Once
approved,
the
Select
Committee
is
then
recognized
as
any
other
congressional
committee.
This
means
that
they
are
allowed
to
hold
hearings,
debate,
and
vote
on
pieces
of
legislation
related
to
their
investigation
or
issue.
( I
voted
against
the
newly-formed
Select
Committee
on
Benghazi
because
it
did
not
include
an
equal
number
of
Democrats
and
Republicans,
which
would
ensure
a
bipartisan
review
of
the
evidence .)
