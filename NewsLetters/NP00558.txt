Friend
In case you missed it, today marked a
critical next step
in the House of Representatives lawsuit challenging the Presidents healthcare law, as the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia heard arguments on the motion to dismiss filed by the Administration.
The arguments today addressed the threshold question of whether the House has a right to have its
claims
heard in federal court. The Administration is arguing that it does not. Why is this is so important? Because if the executive branch is able to spend public funds without an appropriation from Congress
as the Administration is doing
while Congress is excluded from challenging this action in federal court, then Congress power of the purse is all but meaningless. Congress decision making authority over funding federal programs is foundational to Congresss ability to serve as a check to the powers of the executive branch and crucial to our governments trisected division of power.
At the end of the day, the protection of the American peoples rights depends on the three branches of governments ability to effectively check and balance one another. That is why this fight matters.
I will keep you posted.
