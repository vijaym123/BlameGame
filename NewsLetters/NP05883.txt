Thank you to
everyone who submitted photos of the District for our first photo
contest. Every submission was a fantastic view of
#AZ06!
From beautiful
sunrises and sunsets, to close-ups of desert flora, it became very clear
that it was going to be hard to choose a winner. So, we ended up choosing
two winners! The first place winner will have their photo displayed
on the
website
and the second place winner will
have their photo displayed as my
Facebook
Timeline
photo.
Congratulations to Tracy and Howard and thank you again for
participating!
