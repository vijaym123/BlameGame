JUSTICE AGAINST SLAVERY SUMMIT
We brought together school administrators, national advocacy groups,
parents, healthcare professionals and others to find a better way to
combat trafficking in South Dakota.
Dear Friend,
Human trafficking is something I always knew was out there, but like
many, I thought of it as a problem that happens in Europe or Southeast
Asia, not in America - let alone in South Dakota. Human trafficking is
happening in our backyard and as a parent, an aunt, a friend, I'm very
alarmed that this evil is out there and that kids are being targeted in
schools, on Facebook, and at malls and truck stops here in South Dakota.
On Monday, I held the Justice Against Slavery Summit to help bring
awareness to this issue and have a conversation with local and national
advocates about better ways to combat sex trafficking in South Dakota.
The discussion was very productive and I gathered a number of ideas for
reform from the Summit.
This week, I'll be taking those ideas to congressional leaders. I've
been recruited by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor to be part of a sex
trafficking task force that will work to put together an
anti-trafficking package. We're expecting to have legislation ready for
the House floor sometime this spring.
If you want to learn more about this issue, please take a moment to
read an article I wrote for the Argus Leader this week. (Click here to

Addressing this issue begins with building awareness. Please forward
this email to your friends, colleagues and family members. Kids who are
trafficked have been mistaken for prostitutes, migrant farm workers and
runaway youth because of a lack of awareness, so this is an important
first step.
If you have any questions on this or any other issue, please reach out
to my office nearest you
or click here
to send me an email directly.
Thanks,
Kristi
