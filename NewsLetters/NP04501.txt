Dear Friends,
This past Tuesday was Veterans Day.
To every patriot who has ever
answered the call of duty, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Your noble service is an inspiration to every American. O ur
freedom and our rights -- and those of so many around the globe -- are
more secure because of your selflessness. Our families and our homeland
are safer because of your sacrifices. Thanks to you, America remains the
shining beacon of liberty and hope to the rest of the world. May God
bless you always, and may He continue to watch over the nation which you
so heroically defended. Last March, I was very proud to support the
Hire More Heroes Act , which will encourage businesses to hire more veterans to help strengthen our economy. It also offers a commonsense solution to protect those who have served in uniform from the harmful consequences of Obamacare. I look forward to this bill finally being passed by the new Senate in the upcoming Congress and then becoming law -- as long as President Obama signs it. Read more about it
here .
Sincerely,
Rep. Kelly Calls for Keystone Pipeline Construction, Scolds Opposition on House Floor
WATCH HERE
Rep. Kelly delivered a speech on the floor of the House of
Representatives yesterday in support of H.R. 5682, a bill to approve the
Keystone XL Pipeline, which was introduced by Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-LA)
on Wednesday. The House passed the bill by
252-161
with bipartisan support earlier today.
Highlights from Rep. Kelly's speech:
"This is a jobs bill. It's a jobs bill, not only in the House of Representatives, but it is a
job
bill in the Senate."
"In the House of Representatives, Dr. Cassidy's bill is about
creating tens of thousands of jobs for hardworking Americans. It's about
an eight billion dollar private investment that will not cost the
American taxpayer one cent. It's about energy independence. It is about
America taking the lead in energy."
"For six years this House has passed pieces of legislation that
would've created the Keystone Pipeline. Every one of those pieces of
legislation died in the Senate. Now, miraculously ... the Senate now is
entertaining this because of one job. The tens of thousands of jobs of
all these Americans who you turned a deaf ear and a blind eye to are now
being answered by the Senate,
because of one job, one ... one
Senator who has the possibility of losing her seat
because of the
Keystone Pipeline not being able to go through the Senate."
"It is truly a jobs bill. It is an American bill. It is a bill that
is going to create billions of dollars in revenue. And I would just ask
my friends on the other side, please look no further than last Tuesday.
Last Tuesday's vote was a referendum on incompetency, not on incumbency.
I would like you to please open your eyes to the American people and
let them rise. Let us create jobs, let us reach the energy independence
that we need to succeed in the global economy."
Rep. Kelly Statement in Support of Rally to Keep Erie Postal Facility Open
Rep. Kelly issued the following statement
today in support of today's rally in Erie to halt
the scheduled closure of the U.S. Postal Service distribution center on
East 38th Street in Erie.
"I want to thank those who put together today's rally for continuing to
raise awareness on this issue. While certainly there need to be reforms
made to the postal service, we need to make sure reforms are done in a
strategically smart manner.
Also, we must ensure that seniors and rural
communities in particular continue to receive the service reliability
that they depend on. That is why I have joined a bipartisan group of my
colleagues in asking for a one-year moratorium on the closure of the
Erie distribution center so that Congress can continue to work on a
postal reform package that will accomplish these goals."
NOTE:
On September 3, 2014, Rep. Kelly co-signed
a bipartisan letter
to the leaders of the House Committee on Appropriations to include
language in the Fiscal Year 2015 Continuing Resolution to impose a
one-year moratorium on the slated closure of the Erie postal facility
along with 81 other U.S. Postal Service mail processing facilities
across the nation.
