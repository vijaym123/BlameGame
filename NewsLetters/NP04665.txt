Rep. Bob Goodlatte
Remembering Those Who Have Served
President Calvin Coolidge
once said, &ldquo;The nation which forgets its defenders will itself be forgotten.&rdquo; While these words were spoken long ago, they are still words
that we must abide by today. We cannot forget our defenders of freedom who have sacrificed so much for this great nation. As Americans, we must
remember the men and women who have answered the call to serve both in times of war and peace. Our veterans have stood guard on distant battlefields
and here at home to protect the liberties at the core of the United States.
The
Sixth District is home to many veterans . I am thankful for their service.
It is altogether
fitting that we honor the sacrifices these men and women make on our behalf by ensuring they receive the care and support they deserve both during and
after their service. Unfortunately, the scandal within the Department of Veterans Affairs that was brought to light earlier this year is a stark
reminder that we must remain vigilant and steadfast in this effort. Cover-ups, backlogs, and delayed services do not best serve the nearly 20 million
veterans currently living in the U.S. Without a doubt, those who have fought in defense of freedom should have an accessible VA system that actually
works &ndash; and we must do more to ensure they have it.
While Congress has already approved bipartisan
reforms to improve access to care for our veterans in response to this gross mismanagement, we must continue to work with the current Administration
to guarantee greater accountability within the system. In addition, it is critical that Congress work to help combat the unacceptably high rates of
unemployment among our veterans, and work to meet the needs of our returning veterans who suffer from the mental and physical wounds of war.
Both young and old, we have much to learn from the stories and experiences of our
veterans. Some stories are difficult to say aloud, others are a struggle to remember, and many more tell of great valor in the line of duty. I am
truly grateful to hear these stories, as I have on many occasions when traveling throughout the Sixth District. These are people and moments in our
history that we cannot afford to forget as a nation, and I pray we never do.
As we celebrate Veterans Day, I encourage you to remember those who have served. If you know a veteran, take a moment to hear their story and
share your gratitude for their service. I am extremely thankful for the members of our Armed Forces past and present and I also want to express my
sincerest appreciation to our military families. They, too, have made countless, and often unrecognized, sacrifices.
For generations, our veterans have made sacrifice after sacrifice so that we could live freely. I ask that
you continue to keep these brave Americans in your thoughts and prayers not just during this time of year, but every day.
We pay tribute to those who
have made our nation great, strong, and most importantly &ndash;
free .

-- You may be interested in my new paper, &quot;The President&rsquo;s Duty to Faithfully Execute the
Law,&quot; which can be
found on
the Heritage Foundation's
website .
It looks closely at the requirement of the President in Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution to
&ldquo;take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed&rdquo; as well as the growing problem of executive overreach.
