Dear Friends,
Students are increasingly using social
media sites like Facebook and Twitter to bully their classmates, and
schools across the country are working to respond to incidents of
cyberbullying. I held the first in a series of roundtables on cyberbullying
Tuesday in Charleston, bringing together educators and officials from
Facebook to talk about how to address bullying online. I thank everyone
who attended and look forward to my next roundtable, which is
tentatively scheduled for January in Martinsburg.
For more on how
you can keep yourself and your children safe online, please visit

WEST
TEAYS ELEMENTARY
I visited West Teays Elementary Wednesday, speaking to
students about my work in Congress and the importance of education. Thank
you so much to the students for being such great
listeners.
BUFFALO SENIOR CENTER
As you may have seen in this
newsletter, I hold mobile office hours weekly across the Second District.
I stopped by my mobile office hours Wednesday in Buffalo to meet with
seniors at the Buffalo Senior Center.
If you need
assistance with a federal agency or would just like to say hello to my staff,
I hope you willl stop by a mobile office near you.
This will be my
last update for 2013; my e-newsletter will resume Jan. 17. I would
like to wish you and your family a very merry Christmas and a safe and
prosperous New Year.
Thank you for reading my weekly
e-newsletter, and as always, you can join in the conversation on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Shelley
