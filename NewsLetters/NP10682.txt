Dear friend,
Our Arizona colleges and businesses are working together to address the
cost of higher education and post-graduation career prospects for our
students.
President Crow (ASU), President Haeger (NAU), and President Hart (U of
A), joined me in writing an op-ed in this weekend's Arizona Republic
that addresses these issues.
Please take a moment to read our op-ed, and feel free to let me know
what you think of it.
Sincerely,
Excellent education, reasonable cost: Arizona has it
Today's students and families are concerned not only with the cost of
education, but also with career prospects post-graduation. Across the
nation, the cost of higher education continues to grow while news
articles point to examples of college graduates working in the
fast-food industry.
To confront these issues head-on, the U.S. House Education and the
Workforce Committee recently convened a hearing in Arizona. We had the
opportunity to discuss these important issues between members of
Congress and local Arizona experts.
It was a great opportunity to share that, although there is still much
to be done, Arizona universities and community colleges are on the
cutting edge of creative initiatives to deliver high-quality education
while working to resolve the financial challenges of the contemporary
world.
Quality of education is as important, if not more so than the cost. In
order for Arizona to be globally competitive, we need to ensure that
our students are graduating with the skills necessary to forge a great
career and to adapt to the ever-changing, global workforce.
Nearly 30,000 students will graduate from Arizona's four-year public
universities this year. If we are to maintain a competitive edge in
education and the global economy, all schools should be held to a high
standard of excellence. Transparency and accountability for
institutions of higher education allow prospective students a clearer
choice.
All higher-education institutions, whether public or private
universities, career colleges or community colleges, should be held to
an equal standard of accountability, including gainful employment
measures if they move forward. We look forward to the process of
developing the details behind this proposal.
Arizona's Constitution states that university instruction "shall be as
nearly free as possible." The average national cost of education has
experienced inflation twice as high as general inflation over the past
several years, averaging about 8 percent annually.
To give our next generation of graduates a fighting chance, we must
continue to work together on the challenge of affordability while
ensuring that they have the skills needed by top employers. Students
need an education that will not leave them still making payments on
student loans when they send their own children off to college.
Arizona universities and community colleges have partnered to provide
seamless credit transfer and even joint- admissions processes. These
innovative, low-cost models provide options for earning a world-class
degree at lower total cost. A low-cost education would mean nothing if
students were unable to find good work post-graduation.
To maintain strong workforce relevance, our Arizona universities
actively partner with local and international industry to shape
curricula that prepare students for in-demand jobs. Expansion of
programs in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) and
health fields are two examples of responsiveness from our Arizona
universities to meet the high demands of businesses.
This will have a positive impact on Arizona's economy and serve our
graduates in well-paying, recession-proof careers that advance the
state's competitiveness in the global innovation marketplace.
We look forward to the discussions surrounding the upcoming
reauthorization of the Higher Education Act because it is the key
federal policy affecting our schools and, consequently, our future
workforce. We are encouraged that the House Committee on Education and
the Workforce has held several hearings on this legislation.
The recent hearing in Mesa with committee members, including Chairman
John Kline, R-Minn., demonstrated the important role Arizonans have in
shaping the discussion. It is necessary to create an environment where
institutions of higher education can implement innovative strategies to
best prepare graduates for careers in an ever-changing economic
landscape.
Our Arizona schools, leaders and businesses are taking the lead on this
initiative, and the field hearing provided the venue to showcase the
great work done here in the Grand Canyon State.

House of Representatives and is a member of the House Committee on
Education and the Workforce. Michael Crow is president of Arizona State
University. John Haeger is president of Northern Arizona University.

Dear
friend,
Our
Arizona
colleges
and
businesses
are
working
together
to
address
the
cost
of
higher
education
and
post-graduation
career
prospects
for
our
students.
President
Crow
(ASU),
President
Haeger
(NAU),
and
President
Hart
(U
of
A),
joined
me
in
writing
an
op-ed
in
this
weekend's
Arizona
Republic
that
addresses
these
issues.
Please
take
a
moment
to
read
our
op-ed,
and
feel
free
to
let
me
know
what
you
think
of
it.
Sincerely,
Excellent
education,
reasonable
cost:
Arizona
has
it
Today's
students
and
families
are
concerned
not
only
with
the
cost
of
education,
but
also
with
career
prospects
post-graduation.
Across
the
nation,
the
cost
of
higher
education
continues
to
grow
while
news
articles
point
to
examples
of
college
graduates
working
in
the
fast-food
industry.
To
confront
these
issues
head-on,
the
U.S.
House
Education
and
the
Workforce
Committee
recently
convened
a
hearing
in
Arizona.
We
had
the
opportunity
to
discuss
these
important
issues
between
members
of
Congress
and
local
Arizona
experts.
It
was
a
great
opportunity
to
share
that,
although
there
is
still
much
to
be
done,
Arizona
universities
and
community
colleges
are
on
the
cutting
edge
of
creative
initiatives
to
deliver
high-quality
education
while
working
to
resolve
the
financial
challenges
of
the
contemporary
world.
Quality
of
education
is
as
important,
if
not
more
so
than
the
cost.
In
order
for
Arizona
to
be
globally
competitive,
we
need
to
ensure
that
our
students
are
graduating
with
the
skills
necessary
to
forge
a
great
career
and
to
adapt
to
the
ever-changing,
global
workforce.
Nearly
30,000
students
will
graduate
from
Arizona's
four-year
public
universities
this
year.
If
we
are
to
maintain
a
competitive
edge
in
education
and
the
global
economy,
all
schools
should
be
held
to
a
high
standard
of
excellence.
Transparency
and
accountability
for
institutions
of
higher
education
allow
prospective
students
a
clearer
choice.
All
higher-education
institutions,
whether
public
or
private
universities,
career
colleges
or
community
colleges,
should
be
held
to
an
equal
standard
of
accountability,
including
gainful
employment
measures
if
they
move
forward.
We
look
forward
to
the
process
of
developing
the
details
behind
this
proposal.
Arizona's
Constitution
states
that
university
instruction
"shall
be
as
nearly
free
as
possible."
The
average
national
cost
of
education
has
experienced
inflation
twice
as
high
as
general
inflation
over
the
past
several
years,
averaging
about
8
percent
annually.
To
give
our
next
generation
of
graduates
a
fighting
chance,
we
must
continue
to
work
together
on
the
challenge
of
affordability
while
ensuring
that
they
have
the
skills
needed
by
top
employers.
Students
need
an
education
that
will
not
leave
them
still
making
payments
on
student
loans
when
they
send
their
own
children
off
to
college.
Arizona
universities
and
community
colleges
have
partnered
to
provide
seamless
credit
transfer
and
even
joint-
admissions
processes.
These
innovative,
low-cost
models
provide
options
for
earning
a
world-class
degree
at
lower
total
cost.
A
low-cost
education
would
mean
nothing
if
students
were
unable
to
find
good
work
post-graduation.
To
maintain
strong
workforce
relevance,
our
Arizona
universities
actively
partner
with
local
and
international
industry
to
shape
curricula
that
prepare
students
for
in-demand
jobs.
Expansion
of
programs
in
the
STEM
(science,
technology,
engineering
and
math)
and
health
fields
are
two
examples
of
responsiveness
from
our
Arizona
universities
to
meet
the
high
demands
of
businesses.
This
will
have
a
positive
impact
on
Arizona's
economy
and
serve
our
graduates
in
well-paying,
recession-proof
careers
that
advance
the
state's
competitiveness
in
the
global
innovation
marketplace.
We
look
forward
to
the
discussions
surrounding
the
upcoming
reauthorization
of
the
Higher
Education
Act
because
it
is
the
key
federal
policy
affecting
our
schools
and,
consequently,
our
future
workforce.
We
are
encouraged
that
the
House
Committee
on
Education
and
the
Workforce
has
held
several
hearings
on
this
legislation.
The
recent
hearing
in
Mesa
with
committee
members,
including
Chairman
John
Kline,
R-Minn.,
demonstrated
the
important
role
Arizonans
have
in
shaping
the
discussion.
It
is
necessary
to
create
an
environment
where
institutions
of
higher
education
can
implement
innovative
strategies
to
best
prepare
graduates
for
careers
in
an
ever-changing
economic
landscape.
Our
Arizona
schools,
leaders
and
businesses
are
taking
the
lead
on
this
initiative,
and
the
field
hearing
provided
the
venue
to
showcase
the
great
work
done
here
in
the
Grand
Canyon
State.
