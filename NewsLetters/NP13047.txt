Friend,
We&#39;re better than this.
Speaker Boehner has refused to renew emergency unemployment insurance.
Because of his inaction, over one million job seeking Americans have lost benefits that they rely on -- to feed their families, to keep a roof over their heads, to simply survive.
Will you join me in telling the Speaker that we cannot turn our backs on these struggling families?
The Senate has already taken steps to extend these vital benefits. There&#39;s simply no excuse for the House not to do the same.
Sign here
to let Speaker Boehner know that we demand action.
Thank you for joining me in sending this important message.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
P.S.
