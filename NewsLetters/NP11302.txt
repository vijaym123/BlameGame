Dear Friend,
As a lifelong resident of our district and a small-business owner, I know what&rsquo;s at stake when our communities are at risk of catastrophic flooding and damage. That's why I worked so hard to secure funding for critical flood control projects in
Coconino ,
Pinal
and
Navajo
counties.
Below, you can read more about those projects, along with my activities with
veterans ,
seniors
and
small-business owners . As always, feel free to forward this eNewsletter to family and friends who live in District One.
Sincerely,
Ann Kirkpatrick U.S. Representative, Arizona District One

Big wins in infrastructure
RIO DE FLAG
I secured $1.6 million for the
Rio de Flag
flood control project, a top priority for the city of Flagstaff, which is vulnerable to catastrophic flooding damage. In 2010, for example, the financial impact of the Schultz Fire and its subsequent flooding surpassed $130 million.
Flagstaff Mayor Jerry Nabours said : &ldquo;Congresswoman Kirkpatrick has relentlessly pursued funding for the Rio de Flag, including facilitating meetings with the city council delegation and key members of the Army Corps and OMB. Her support and pursuit of funding for this project has been unwavering, and without her support this project may not have received funding. We are extremely grateful for her efforts.&rdquo;

WINSLOW LEVEE
I secured $750,000 for the Little Colorado River Levee at
Winslow , the first time this critical infrastructure project has been included in the president's budget. This is will help protect our residents, cultural resources and local economies.
Jesse Thompson, chairman of the Navajo County Board of Supervisors, said , &ldquo;This project is critical to protecting the lives and property of businesses and residents in Winslow. We appreciate our partnership with the Army Corps of Engineers and everything Congresswoman Kirkpatrick has done to help us improve the Winslow Levee.&rdquo;
LOWER SANTA CRUZ WATERSHED
I secured $300,000 in funding for the
Lower Santa Cruz Watershed Project
in Pinal County, launching it as an official Army Corps of Engineers project. The watershed has a long history of catastrophic flooding, resulting in severe and costly damage to homes, businesses, crops and infrastructure.
Christian Price, Mayor of Maricopa, said:
&ldquo;Against all odds, Congresswoman Kirkpatrick made this happen and we thank her. This is so important to the people of Maricopa. As our community grows, so does the need to prevent major flood damage to our homes and businesses.&rdquo;

Supporting Arizona veterans
Ride for the Warrior:
I spoke about veterans issues at the Ride for the Warrior event in Casa Grande (as shown in photo). And I was so happy to see Brad Hazell, my former veterans caseworker (wearing black vest in photo). Brad is now the Arizona VFW&rsquo;s Veterans Service Officer &amp; a volunteer for Ride for the Warrior event benefiting the AZ Military Emergency Relief Fund &amp; Pinal County Veterans Memorial.
Veteran Stand Down:
My southern Arizona staff assisted constituents at the Veteran Stand Down in Tucson (as shown in photo), which provided more than 125 veterans with resources for education, housing, health services, moral support and more.
Farmer Veteran Coalition:
This national nonprofit is working to cultivate a new generation of farmers and create viable career options for veterans. My veterans caseworker (Palmer Miller, third from right in bottom photo) attended a gathering in support of creating a coalition chapter here. Attendees included folks from the Arizona Farm Bureau, Small Business Association, UofA Master Farmer Program and Lucky Nickel Organic Ranch.
Around the district
Small business in Camp Verde:
Main Street in Camp Verde has a good mix of small businesses, and it has seasonal festivals and events that attract many visitors. I took a walking tour of several of these small businesses and then hosted a roundtable (as shown in photo) to talk about the local economy.
Supporting Medicare &amp; Social Security:
I met for coffee with folks at the Superior senior center (as shown in photo) as well as the Globe senior center to talk about protecting Medicare and Social Security.
Tribal communities:
I spent some time in San Carlos, home of the San Carlos Apache Tribe. My visit included a stop at their Cultural Center (as shown in photo) to meet with folks there and talk about tribal issues and the local economy.
