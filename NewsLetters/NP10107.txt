Dear Friend,
With only a few hours left to reach our $15,000 goal for April, I wanted to let you know where we stand. As of 4:00pm EDT, we&rsquo;re still about $1,115 short of our goal. You can get us closer now with a $5 contribution.
People outside Massachusetts tend to think that Democrats don&rsquo;t even have to work to win in the Bay State.
But we know better, and we&rsquo;re not taking anything for granted. To fuel our campaign&rsquo;s efforts, we need resources from grassroots supporters like you -- give $5 and help us reach our $15,000 April goal by midnight tonight.
Thank you for all your support and hard work.
