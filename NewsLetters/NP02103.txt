Forbes to Carter: Administration Putting IRS, EPA Above National Security
Washington, D.C.
Congressman J. Randy Forbes (VA-04), Chairman of the House Armed Services Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, today
questioned
Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter on the Presidents threat to veto legislation that removes defense spending from sequestration.
Secretary Carter has admitted that sequestration is devastating to our national defense. Yet the President has threatened to veto legislation removing defense from sequestration. I find it simply unconscionable that the Administration is jeopardizing our national security in order to avoid cuts at the Internal Revenue Service, Environmental Protection Agency, and other domestic agencies, Congressman Forbes said. The United States military should not be held hostage by the Administration.
