OUR DISTRICT
Dear Friend,
Last week, two of the committees on which I sit passed legislation dealing with job creation and restoring the constitutional balance of power. I provide an update of these actions below, along with a few other items of interest.
Have a great week!
Steve Chabot
Small Business Committee
Last week, I supported a number of bills, which passed out of the House Committee on Small Business, that would reform the federal contracting process and help create greater opportunities for small businesses and hardworking Americans. These policy measures include raising the small business contracting goal for federal contracts and improving the contracting process for veteran-owned businesses. Read more about each bill

Judiciary Committee Markup
In response to Obama Administration's unilateral efforts to sidestep Congress and rewrite the law, the House Committee on the Judiciary approved three bills to rein in the growing problem of executive overreach and restore balance to the separation of powers enshrined in our Constitution. One of those bills, the Faithful Execution of the Law Act, was passed by the whole House on Thursday and sent to the Senate for consideration.
The bills include:
The Faithful Execution of the Law Act (H.R. 3973)
The Executive Needs to Faithfully Observe and Respect Congressional Enactments of the Law (ENFORCE the Law) Act (H.R. 4138)
The Immigration Compliance Enforcement (ICE) Act (H.R. 3732).
Here is a news report highlighting this issue.
In the News
The Administration quietly released a report a short time ago, which concluded nearly two-thirds of small businesses
65 percent to be exact
will suffer health care premium increases due to Obamacare.
This means that Obamacare will ratchet up costs for roughly 11 million Americans who receive their health insurance through a small business. Read the
Washington Post
article and see health care solutions that I have
sponsored
which will actually lower costs.
