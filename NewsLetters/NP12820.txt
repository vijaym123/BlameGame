7th DISTRICT
January 31, 2014
Dear Friend,
Join me in viewing with pride A Heros Welcome; a Super
Bowl commercial that highlights the return from Afghanistan our own Lt.
Chuck Nadd.
The NFL Championship ad, filmed in our 7th
District, highlights City of Winter Park citizens and other Central
Floridians welcoming Lt. Nadd back home. The Budweiser sponsored
commercial, which will warm your heart and renew our faith and commitment to
those in uniform, is scheduled to air in the 3rd quarter of Super Bowl
XLVIII.
For a sneak peak, you can watch it
here .
Sincerely,
John L. Mica
