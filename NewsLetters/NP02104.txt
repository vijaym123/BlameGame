Dear Friends,
I was back in the Valley this week, where I enjoyed having a townhall meeting with around a hundred Cigna employees who discussed ObamaCare, jobs,
water, and other issues with me. Hundreds of Cigna jobs in Visalia had been jeopardized by ObamaCare regulations that put U.S. insurers at a disadvantage with foreign-based companies in issuing health plans for Americans living overseas. However, a bipartisan
group of House members passed a law I co-authored to cancel those regulations, and the cancellation was enacted into law
in December. You can read about the townhall meeting
here
and
here .
