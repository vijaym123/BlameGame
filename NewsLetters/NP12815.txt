Dear Friend,
President Obama's 2014
State of the Union Address has reminded the country that, with
optimism for the future and action on all of our parts, we can expand
economic opportunities for everyone in America. I'm excited about advancing
the President's progressive proposals, such as raising the federal
minimum wage, implementing a new retirement savings account, launching
manufacturing initiatives, empowering women, and making college
affordable, which will help more Americans find work, and more workers find the
economic security they deserve. In America, if you work hard and play
by the rules, you should have the opportunity to
succeed.
Full Employment Caucus : In effort to get Americans back
to working full-time I joined, as a founding member of the
Congressional Full Employment Caucus, a group dedicated to advocating for
legislative action that can help solve the problem of unemployment and
underemployment across the country. It's important that we work to remove
barriers to success and ensure that there are opportunities available
for everybody. I'll keep working hard to help rebuild our economy and
create sustainable jobs.
SNAP Cuts : I voted
against the billions of dollars cuts on the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as food stamps). Without SNAP,
many families would literally be unable to put food on their tables.
Ninety dollars doesn't sound like much when you have money, but when
you're struggling to put food on your table, it can make a big difference.
Unfortunately, the measure passed the House with a vote of 251 to 166
and now heads to the Senate, which is expected to give final approval
by Friday.
Immigration Reform:
On Thursday,
House Republicans released a set of principles for comprehensive
immigration reform that signal their willingness to move forward on fixing
America's broken immigration system. America has always been a place
where people can pursue their dreams and I am determined to continue
to fight to help create a pathway to citizenship for millions of people
who deserve an opportunity to achieve the American
Dream.
