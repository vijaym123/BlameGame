The Scalise Capitol
Report

Protecting and
defending freedom at home and abroad
We continue to
live in a dangerous world, faced with enemies wanting to destroy the
American way of life. Last week, the president addressed the nation
outlining his proposal to "degrade and destroy" the terrorist organization
the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). I have been concerned
about the threat that ISIL poses to Americas national security
f or some time now . My colleagues and I are committed to
defending our homeland, and we will uphold that promise by remaining
vigilant, determined, and unified in our support of a strong national
defense.
Supporting Israel and its right to
self-defense
Last week, I sat down with Israel's Ambassador to the
United States Ron Dermer to discuss the unbreakable bond shared between
our two great nations. Israel is our greatest friend and ally in an
increasingly unstable region -- a region which has publicly called for
Israel's extinction. I will continue to stand with Israel and support its
right to defend its people.
Fulfilling the presidents broken
promises
"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it. Period." That
oft-broken promise by President Obama regarding his signature health
care law has been followed by millions of canceled and disrupted health
insurance plans for hard-working taxpayers. The House acted to uphold
the Presidents broken promise by passing a bill that will help
millions of Americans at risk of losing their health plans they have and
like. The Employee Health Care Protection Act, authored by my good friend
and colleague Congressman Bill Cassidy, allows health insurance plans
currently offered for small businesses to continue to be offered.
This bill would at least give peace of mind to the millions of Americans
who have health plans they like that are in jeopardy of losing them
due to the president's failed health care
law.
Making Hoops for
Youth
I recently played in the 16th annual
Congressional Basketball Game with a bipartisan group of colleagues. The
charity event is an opportunity to help young kids in tough situations, and
this year we raised $180,000. Not to mention, the Members were
victorious in a 46-40 win! While we are all working hard to take care of our
daily responsibilities, it is also important to take some time to give
back to others who are less fortunate.
It
is an honor to represent you in Congress. For more information please
