Hi,
In a welcome change from the gridlocked Senate of years past, today we are shifting into high gear to vote on a slew of amendments to ensure a leaner federal budget. As of this morning, I've filed amendments that would eliminate more than $6 billion from the budget - cutting taxpayer funding to egregious items including agricultural subsidies for millionaires, first-class airline tickets for federal employees, and Amtrak's food and beverage service.
In addition, I've offered a number of amendments to rein in out-of-control federal agencies. That group includes amendments to override the Justice Department's inexplicable decision to stop prosecuting illegal border crossers under Operation Streamline, stop another IRS attempt to target nonprofit groups, and eliminate a secretive federal carbon cap used by the administration to determine whether some projects get funded.

P.S. Here are summaries and background information on all 21 of my amendments to the budget.
Flake Amendment #665: To Impose Impartiality on Project Labor Agreements
Summary
Would establish a spending neutral reserve fund to prohibit the federal government from awarding contracts based on awardees entering or not entering into agreements with labor organizations.
Background
In Feb. 2009, Pres. Obama signed Executive Order 13502, which states that it is "the policy of the federal government to encourage executive agencies to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements (PLAs) in connection with large-scale construction projects." While this Executive Order does not require federal agencies to use PLAs, subsequent implementing guidance and regulatory changes have led some agencies to interpret the executive order as requiring the agencies to at least consider the use of PLAs. This has led to bid protests, strained resources, and bureaucratic preferences that may result in giving some bidders advantages over others.

Flake Amendment #677: To Prevent Political Targeting by the IRS
Summary
Would establish a deficit neutral reserve fund related to preventing of IRS rulemaking related to 501(c)(4)s, including the new candidate-related political activity definition.
Background
In the aftermath of the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) political targeting scandal, in which IRS agents manipulated the "facts and circumstances" standard used to determine political activity, the agency issued a proposed rule broadly defining political activity. The overly broad nature of this definition would even limit non-partisan activities, like the issuance of non-partisan voter guides, and would force many social welfare organizations to quit civic engagement activates or shut down altogether. After a record 90,000 public comments were submitted to the IRS, that rulemaking was postponed. The IRS in now in the process of crafting a new rule, notwithstanding that investigations into the targeting scandal by the House, Senate and Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) are still ongoing.

Flake Amendment #678: To Prosecute First-Time Illegal Border Crossers
Summary
Would establish a spending-neutral reserve fund seeking to reduce recidivism of illegal border crossers, including removing any prohibition on the Federal prosecution of first-time border crossers.
Background
According to reports, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Arizona will no longer be prosecuting those apprehended crossing the border illegally for the first time and there is concern that refusing to provide discretion to prosecute first-time illegal border crossers will jeopardize border security gains.
A key to those gains in Arizona's Yuma Sector has been the implementation of Operation Streamline. With a "zero-tolerance" approach, the Yuma County Sheriff's Office cites 100 percent prosecution of illegal border crossers as a shared goal of a partnership including Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies. Among the various consequences delivered to illegal crossers by the Department of Homeland Security implemented in various sectors in the southern border region, Operation Streamline is associated with a recidivism rate that is well below average and has seen a steady decrease in recidivism in recent years.

Flake Amendment #667: To Stop Double Dipping of Benefits
Summary
Would create a spending-neutral reserve fund to ensure that individuals do not simultaneously receive unemployment compensation and disability insurance benefits.
Background
With the Disability Insurance (DI) Trust Fund projected to be bankrupt during 2017, preventing this double-dipping is a common-sense reform.
The Disability Insurance (DI) program was designed as a safety net of last resort for disabled Americans who cannot work.
On the other hand, the Unemployment insurance (UI) program was designed as a safety net for unemployed Americans who are actively seeking work.
The two programs have conflicting eligibility requirements, yet individuals can simultaneously be classified as both "able and available for work" under the UI program and "disabled" under the DI program.
According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), these overlapping federal payments are costing the Social Security Disability Insurance program $1.2 billion over 10 years. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) most recently mentioned this issue on March 4, 2015 in testimony before the Senate Budget Committee recommending, "Congress should consider passing legislation to prevent individuals from collecting both full Disability Insurance benefits and Unemployment Insurance benefits that cover the same period." Additionally, President Obama has addressed this issue in his FY2014 and FY2015 budget proposal.

Flake Amendment #666: To Eliminate Crop Insurance Subsidies for Millionaires
Summary
Would eliminate premium subsidies provided by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation on behalf of any person or legal entity with an average adjusted gross income in excess of $750,000.
Background
The wealthiest farmers in our country do not need federal subsidies for crop insurance premiums. When millionaires receive these subsidies, it is no longer a safety net but a form of corporate welfare.
A March 18, 2015 GAO report states that "about 1 percent of crop insurance participants would have been affected if premium subsidies had been reduced for the highest income participants from 2009 through 2013." The GAO went on to say that "reducing crop insurance subsidies for the highest income participants would have a minimal effect on the program and save millions of dollars." According to GAO, "If premium subsidies had been reduced by 15 percentage points for the highest income participants from 2009 through 2013, the federal government would have saved more than $70 million over the 5-year period ...The current income limit, enacted in 2014 for farm and conservation programs, would likely affect fewer crop insurance participants than did the previous limit. Consequently, the savings would be smaller."
By eliminating federal subsidies for millionaire farmers, the federal government could save millions of dollars while leaving intact, and even strengthening, the existing farm safety net for those farmers most in need.

Flake Amendment #669: To Cut Remaining Amounts Available for the ATVM Program Credit Subsidy
Summary
Would cut $4.2 billion in budget authority from the energy function (270) and reduce the overall caps by the commensurate amount in accordance with the GAO's suggestion about rescinding all or part of the remaining $4.2 billion credit subsidy associated with the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program.
Background
On March 4, 2015, GAO reported that "The Department of Energy (DOE) has not yet demonstrated a demand for these loans that would substantially use the remaining [$4.2 billion in] credit subsidy appropriations."
GAO recommended in 2011 that "DOE accelerate its efforts to engage the engineering expertise needed for effective technical oversight and develop sufficient, quantifiable performance measures for its program goals."
GAO followed that report in 2013, noting that "DOE was not actively considering any applications for using the remaining $16.6 billion in loan authority or $4.2 billion in credit subsidy appropriations...." At the time, DOE officials told GAO that it was unlikely to use the remaining ATVM loan authority "given the current eligibility requirements." This amendment would follow GAO's recommendation by cutting the remaining credit-subsidy authority.

Flake Amendment #668: To Support Government Reform and Efficiency
Summary
Would establish a spending neutral reserve fund relating to achieving savings through the use of performance data or scientifically rigorous evaluation methodologies for the elimination, consolidation, or reform of Federal programs, agencies, offices and initiatives, the sale of Federal property, or the reduction of improper payments.
Background
With over 2 million employees and hundreds of agencies, duplication and overlap are prevalent in the federal government while our gross national debt exceeds $18 trillion. In 2014, GAO found billions of dollars in potential savings. This amendment supports legislation to reduce wasteful government practices to save taxpayer dollars and help return our nation to fiscal sustainability.
This amendment was included in the 2013 Senate-passed budget, but not in the FY 2016 budget.

Flake Amendment #674: To Prohibit Amtrak from Spending Taxpayer Dollars to Subsidize Food and Beverage Services
Summary
Would cut $53.2 million from the transportation function (400) and reduce the overall caps by the commensurate amount to assure that taxpayers aren't subsidizing Amtrak's Food and Beverage losses.
Background
According to its own budget justification, Amtrak projects that its food and beverage service will incur a loss of $53.2 million for 2016. Amtrak itself has recognized the problem and in 2013 President and CEO Boardman committed to eliminate these losses over five years. This amendment would simply prevent taxpayers from footing the bill for another year of these losses.

Flake Amendment #676: To Prohibit HHS Officials From Spending Taxpayer Dollars to Subsidize Business and First-Class Airline Seating
Summary
Would cut $6.27 million to assure that taxpayers aren't subsidizing the bill for HHS officials to upgrade their flights to business and first class.
Background
According to a recent media report, between 2009 and 2013 officials at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) took 7,000 first class and business class flights costing the taxpayers over $31 million.
Examples include one FDA staffer who spent an additional $10,000 in federal dollars to fly first class to San Francisco to DC. Another example includes a flight from DC to LA and Australia and Germany costing $26,469.23 due to an upgrade because of a medical disability. In 2013, those flights totaled $6.27 million.
Considering our current fiscal environment, Congress needs to be good stewards of federal dollars and taxpayers should not be on the hook to pay for this kind of spending.

Flake Amendment #671: To Cut Funding to Harvest Price Option Subsidies
Summary
Would cut $1.665 billion in budget authority from the agriculture function (350) and reduce the overall caps by the commensurate amount in accordance with CBO's estimate of the savings that would be achieved by eliminating subsidies for Harvest Price Option (HPO) policies in FY2016.
This amendment would cut funding for premium subsidies being paid on any federal crop insurance policy with a HPO. The amendment does nothing to prohibit the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Risk Management Association from offering HPO or any other policy.
Background
HPO is a Cadillac-coverage hybrid of a standard crop insurance policy that ensures a farmers profits. HPOs are the same as the standard policy except for one significant and costly difference; if actual harvest price ends up higher than the estimated harvest price used to calculate the policy at planting, the revenue guarantee is recalculated using the higher price. That means that farmers with HPO policies are actually collecting more in insurance payouts than they were ever expecting when they planted their crops. Essentially, HPOs allow for the equivalent of your car insurance company surprising you with a Cadillac after you total your Taurus.
In two years, the program's costs have ballooned $10 billion. Even the president's budget has called for a reduction of 10 percent in premium subsidies for revenue coverage, which includes additional coverage for the price at harvest
CBO estimates this amendment would save $18.9 billion over 10 years while not affecting the premium subsidies received by farmers who opt for standard crop insurance policies.

Flake Amendment #673: To Eliminate Funding for the Economic Development Administration
Summary
Would eliminate all $254 million in funding from the budget for the EDA.
Background
The Economic Development Administration (EDA) provides grants and loans to local governments and business that are supposed to be distressed, with the intention of savings jobs.
GAO reports that they are skeptical of EDA's claims of success and it does not promote products and services that people wants to buy. This program subsidizes business - the government should not be in this business. This program is duplicative of many existing federal programs and agencies. The idea of using federal funding to boost local economic growth is inherently harmful to the sustainability of the communities because they become dependent on the funding. With over $18 trillion of crushing federal debt, we need to focus eliminate duplicative and beneficially dubious funding from the budget.

Flake Amendment #672: To Establish a Point of Order Against the Consideration of Earmarks
Summary
Would establish a point of order against considering a bill, joint resolution, motion, amendment, amendment between the Houses, or conference report that includes an earmark.
The point of order could be waived or appealed with a two-thirds vote.
If the point of order is sustained, the earmark would be stricken. Should there be disagreement regarding whether a specific provision is an earmark, the question would be put to the Senate and decided in the affirmative with a two-thirds vote.
Background
The history of earmarks is by now well known.
Congress has chosen to no longer continue the practice. This point of order would ensure that the current prohibition continues.

Flake Amendment #675: To Eliminate Funding for SelectUSA
Summary
Would eliminate $10 million in discretionary spending, the level at which the SelectUSA program was funded at in FY 2015.
Background
The Department of Commerce's SelectUSA program was launched in 2013 by the administration with the goal of attracting foreign direct investment to the United States. According to the program, SelectUSA provides state, regional, and local economic development organizations with information assistance, ombudsman services, investment advocacy, and promotional platforms - including "high-profile events" including summits, forums, road shows, and missions to trade fairs. Investor confidence in the United States remains strong and programs like SelectUSA are wasteful.

Flake Amendment #670: To Eliminate Funding for the USDA Single Family Housing Direct Loan Program
Summary
Would eliminate funding for the USDA's Single Family Housing Direct Loan program, which is estimated to be $60.7 million in FY 2016.
Background
Through this program, the USDA provides direct loans to low-to-moderate income (less than 80% of median income) homebuyers in qualified rural areas. The homebuyer must be unable to obtain credit elsewhere. Borrowers may receive 100% financing and interest rate subsidies for homes that do not exceed area loan limits. This program duplicates or overlaps 160 housing assistance programs and tax expenditures within 20 departments and agencies. This is a prime example of wasteful and duplicative spending in the federal government.
Flake Amendment #822: To Evaluate and Consolidate Duplicative Federal Green Building Programs
Summary
Would amend Section 346 (Deficit-Neutral Reserve Fund to Provide Energy Assistance and Invest in Energy Efficiency and Conservation) to implement the GAO's recommendation to evaluate and consolidate 94 Federal green building programs that span 11 different Federal agencies.
Background
In its 2012 annual report on Opportunities to Reduce Duplication, Overlap and Fragmentation, Achieve Savings, and Enhance Revenue, GAO found that as of 2011 there were 94 federal initiatives to foster green building in the nonfederal sector. According to GAO, many of these initiatives provide similar types of assistance such as grants, technical assistance, and tax credits.
In responding to GAO, agencies reported difficulties in establishing goals and measures for these programs, challenges with gathering reliable data, and trouble tracking funds.
As a result, "Congress, agency heads, and the public have incomplete information about the results of individual and overall federal efforts to foster green building in the nonfederal sector and the efficiency of these efforts."
In a 2014 update, GAO reiterated this point noting that "without comprehensive information about each individual initiative's progress toward fostering green building, and without collaboration across federal agencies to establish green building goals and ways to measure progress, Congress, agency heads, and the public have incomplete information about the results of individual and overall federal efforts to foster green building in the nonfederal sector and the efficiency of these efforts."
Flake Amendment #818: To Eliminate OPIC's "Carbon Cap"
Summary
Would create a spending-neutral reserve fund to prohibit the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) from taking into consideration a project's greenhouse gas emissions when considering whether to fund a project
Background
In 2007, OPIC committed itself to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from OPIC-supported projects by 20 percent over a period of ten years, and established an annual emissions cap for all new OPIC-supported projects with significant greenhouse gas emissions. Then, in March 2009, OPIC announced its intent to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions from 20 to 30 percent in OPIC-supported projects over a ten-year period.
In December 2009, the fiscal year 2010 omnibus measure included language that required OPIC to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent over a ten year period, and 50 percent over a 15 year period.
Testimony heard by the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on African Affairs and Global Health Policy indicates that these policies have had the effect of removing OPIC altogether from the business of financing projects that deal in natural gas.
While there are some areas of rural Africa that would benefit from alternative energy projects, natural gas is still needed to power Africa.
OPIC should not be constrained from supporting projects that deal in natural gas.
Flake Amendment #820: To End the "Defense Rapid Innovation Project"
Summary
Would create a spending-neutral reserve fund to end the Defense Rapid Innovation Program.
Background
In the wake of the ban on earmarks to for-profit companies in 2010, a new program was established in the FY 2011 National Defense Authorization Act called the Defense Rapid Innovation Program.
According to the authorizing bill, the intent of the program was "to stimulate innovative technologies and reduce acquisition or lifecycle costs, address technical risks, improve the timeliness and thoroughness of test and evaluation outcomes, and rapidly insert such products directly in support of primarily major defense acquisition programs, but also other defense acquisition programs that meet critical national security needs."
At the time of its conception, CQ reported that "skeptics see it as a possible end run around recent earmark restrictions."
While the Pentagon has never requested funds for this program, Congress has appropriated $845 million dollars over the course of four years for this program.
At a time when we have resorted to using off-budget "war funding" to fund programs critical to national security, we should not be spending funds for anything the Pentagon does not want.

Flake Amendment #821: To Prohibit the Forest Service from Finalizing and Implementing its Proposed Groundwater Directive
Summary
Would establish a spending-neutral reserve fund prohibiting the Forest Service from finalizing and implementing its proposed groundwater directive.
Background
On May 6, 2014, the Forest Service published a proposed directive to establish guidelines for the management of groundwater on Forest Service land. The proposal contains several flaws. It would enable the Forest Service to interject itself in the state water right application process for water rights on lands adjacent to National Forest System lands, potentially interfering with private property rights.
It also assumes a hydraulic connection between groundwater and surface water; an assumption that runs contrary to water law in some states like Arizona.
The current proposal was developed without sufficient consultation with states and Native American tribes, all of whom could be affected by the Forest Service's final decision. Finally, the legal authority for claiming jurisdiction over groundwater below National Forest System land is questionable.
The Forest Service has indicated that it plans to identify a path forward this year.
Flake Amendment #823: To Reduce Duplicative Federal Financial Literacy Programs
Summary
Would establish a deficit neutral reserve fund to implement the Government Accountability Office's (GAO) recommendation related to duplication of Financial Literacy Programs
Background
In 2013, then-U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) offered an amendment to the budget to eliminate program duplication, fragmentation, and overlap within the 15 "financial literacy" programs under 13 departments and agencies identified by the 2012 GAO on duplication.
In an April 2014 report, GAO updated Congress on the recommendations it made in the 2012, noting its recommendation to Treasury and CFPB that the Financial Literacy and Education Commission identify for federal agencies and Congress options for consolidating federal financial literacy efforts into the agencies and activities best suited or most effective" has not been implemented. That report noted progress - the elimination or defunding of 3 out of 16 financial literacy programs and 1 out of 4 housing counseling programs - but stressed the need for determination of the most effective allocation of federal resources, without which "policy makers lack information to avoid overlap."
This amendment requires the Commission to implement GAO's recommendation.

Flake Amendment #819: To Repeal the Wind Production Tax Credit
Summary
Would establish a spending neutral reserve fund to relating to repeal of the wind production tax credit (PTC) 2014 extension.
Background
The wind PTC was enacted in 1992 to give the nascent wind industry a boost, and 23 years later wind-power generation is no longer an infant industry, and is no longer in need of federal support. This extension costs over $6 billion over a ten year period.

Flake Amendment #824: To Create Transparency in Federal Crop Insurance Subsidies
Summary
Would establish a spending-neutral reserve fund to create
transparency in the Federal crop insurance program, which may include disclosing the names of recipients of Federal subsidy payments for crop insurance.
Background
In FY 2014, taxpayers spent more than $8.7 billion on federal crop insurance. Yet, there is no transparency in who receives these premium subsidies from the federal government, unlike other federal agriculture programs, including conservation programs and other commodity supports.
This amendment would require USDA to extend the same transparency standards used for the direct payments program to individuals or entities that obtain federally subsidized crop insurance. Specifically, it would enable the Secretary of Agriculture to disclose the names of recipients of federal subsidy payments for crop insurance for the purposes of increasing transparency and accountability.

Would establish a spending neutral reserve fund relating to achieving savings through the use of performance data or scientifically rigorous evaluation methodologies for the elimination, consolidation, or reform
of Federal programs, agencies, offices and initiatives, the sale of Federal property, or the reduction of improper payments.
Background
With over 2 million employees and hundreds of agencies, duplication and overlap are prevalent in the federal government while our gross national debt exceeds $18 trillion. In 2014, GAO found billions of dollars
in potential savings. This amendment supports legislation to reduce wasteful government practices to save taxpayer dollars and help return our nation to fiscal sustainability.
This amendment was included in the 2013 Senate-passed budget, but not in the FY 2016 budget.

Flake Amendment #674: To Prohibit Amtrak from Spending Taxpayer Dollars to Subsidize Food and Beverage Services
Summary
Would cut $53.2 million from the transportation function (400) and reduce the overall caps by the commensurate amount to assure that taxpayers aren&#8217;t subsidizing Amtrak&#8217;s Food and Beverage losses.
Background
According to its own budget justification, Amtrak projects that its food and beverage service will incur a loss of $53.2 million for 2016. Amtrak itself has recognized the problem and in 2013 President and CEO
Boardman committed to eliminate these losses over five years. This amendment would simply prevent taxpayers from footing the bill for another year of these losses.

Flake Amendment #676: To Prohibit HHS Officials From Spending Taxpayer Dollars to Subsidize Business and First-Class Airline Seating
Summary
Would cut $6.27 million to assure that taxpayers aren&#8217;t subsidizing the bill for HHS officials to upgrade their flights to business and first class.
Background
According to a recent media report, between 2009 and 2013 officials at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) took 7,000 first class and business class flights costing the taxpayers over $31 million.
Examples include one FDA staffer who spent an additional $10,000 in federal dollars to fly first class to San Francisco to DC. Another example includes a flight from DC to LA and Australia and Germany costing $26,469.23 due to an upgrade because of a medical
disability. In 2013, those flights totaled $6.27 million.
Considering our current fiscal environment, Congress needs to be good stewards of federal dollars and taxpayers should not be on the hook to pay for this kind of spending.

Flake Amendment #671: To Cut Funding to Harvest Price Option Subsidies
Summary
Would cut $1.665 billion in budget authority from the agriculture function (350) and reduce the overall caps by the commensurate amount in accordance with CBO&#8217;s estimate of the savings that would be achieved by
eliminating subsidies for Harvest Price Option (HPO) policies in FY2016.
This amendment would cut funding for premium subsidies being paid on any federal crop insurance policy with a HPO. The amendment does nothing to prohibit the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#8217;s (USDA) Risk Management
Association from offering HPO or any other policy.
Background
HPO is a Cadillac-coverage hybrid of a standard crop insurance policy that ensures a farmers profits. HPOs are the same as the standard policy except for one significant and costly difference; if actual harvest
price ends up higher than the estimated harvest price used to calculate the policy at planting, the revenue guarantee is recalculated using the higher price. That means that farmers with HPO policies are actually collecting more in insurance payouts than they
were ever expecting when they planted their crops. Essentially, HPOs allow for the equivalent of your car insurance company surprising you with a Cadillac after you total your Taurus.
In two years, the program&#8217;s costs have ballooned $10 billion. Even the president&#8217;s budget has called for a reduction of 10 percent in premium subsidies for revenue coverage, which includes additional coverage
for the price at harvest
CBO estimates this amendment would save $18.9 billion over 10 years while not affecting the premium subsidies received by farmers who opt for standard crop insurance policies.

Flake Amendment #673: To
Eliminate Funding for the Economic Development Administration
Summary
Would eliminate all $254 million in funding from the budget for the EDA.
Background
The Economic Development Administration (EDA) provides grants and loans to local governments and business that are supposed to be distressed, with the intention of savings jobs.
GAO reports that they are skeptical of EDA&#8217;s claims of success and it does not promote products and services that people wants to buy. This program subsidizes business &#8211; the government should not be in this business. This program is duplicative of many existing
federal programs and agencies. The idea of using federal funding to boost local economic growth is inherently harmful to the sustainability of the communities because they become dependent on the funding. With over $18 trillion of crushing federal debt, we
need to focus eliminate duplicative and beneficially dubious funding from the budget.

Flake Amendment #672: To
Establish a Point of Order Against the Consideration of Earmarks
Summary
Would establish a point of order against considering a bill, joint resolution, motion, amendment, amendment between the Houses, or conference report that includes an earmark.
The point of order could be waived
or appealed with a two-thirds vote.
If the point of order is sustained, the earmark would be stricken. Should there be disagreement regarding whether a specific provision is an earmark, the question would be put to the Senate and decided in the affirmative
with a two-thirds vote.
Background
The history of earmarks is by now well known.
Congress has chosen to no longer continue the practice. This point of order would ensure that the current prohibition continues.

Flake Amendment #675: To Eliminate Funding for SelectUSA
Summary
Would eliminate $10 million in discretionary spending, the level at which the SelectUSA program was funded at in FY 2015.
Background
The Department of Commerce&#8217;s SelectUSA program was launched in 2013 by the administration with the goal of attracting foreign direct investment to the United States. According to the program, SelectUSA provides
state, regional, and local economic development organizations with information assistance, ombudsman services, investment advocacy, and promotional platforms &#8211; including &#8220;high-profile events&#8221; including summits, forums, road shows, and missions to trade fairs.
Investor confidence in the United States remains strong and programs like SelectUSA are wasteful.

Flake Amendment #670: To Eliminate Funding for the USDA Single Family Housing Direct Loan Program
Summary
Would eliminate funding for the USDA&#8217;s Single Family Housing Direct Loan program, which is estimated to be $60.7 million in FY 2016.
Background
Through this program, the USDA provides direct loans to low-to-moderate income (less than 80% of median income) homebuyers in qualified rural areas. The homebuyer must be unable to obtain credit elsewhere. Borrowers
may receive 100% financing and interest rate subsidies for homes that do not exceed area loan limits. This program duplicates or overlaps 160 housing assistance programs and tax expenditures within 20 departments and agencies. This is a prime example of wasteful
and duplicative spending in the federal government.
Flake Amendment #822: To Evaluate and Consolidate Duplicative Federal Green Building Programs
Summary
Would amend Section 346 (Deficit-Neutral Reserve Fund to Provide Energy Assistance and Invest in Energy Efficiency and Conservation) to implement the GAO&#8217;s recommendation to evaluate and consolidate 94 Federal
green building programs that span 11 different Federal agencies.
Background
In its 2012 annual report on
Opportunities to Reduce Duplication, Overlap and Fragmentation, Achieve Savings, and Enhance Revenue,
GAO found that as of 2011 there were 94 federal initiatives to foster green
building in the nonfederal sector. According to GAO, many of these initiatives provide similar types of assistance such as grants, technical assistance, and tax credits.
In responding to GAO, agencies reported difficulties in establishing goals and measures for these programs, challenges with gathering reliable data, and trouble tracking funds.
As a result, &#8220;Congress, agency heads, and the public have incomplete information
about the results of individual and overall federal efforts to foster green building in the nonfederal sector and the efficiency of these efforts.&#8221;
In a 2014 update, GAO reiterated this point noting that &#8220;without comprehensive information about each individual initiative&#8217;s progress toward fostering green building, and without collaboration across federal agencies to establish green building goals and ways
to measure progress, Congress, agency heads, and the public have incomplete information about the results of individual and overall federal efforts to foster green building in the nonfederal sector and the efficiency of these efforts.&#8221;
Flake Amendment #818: To Eliminate OPIC&#8217;s &#8220;Carbon Cap&#8221;
Summary
Would create a spending-neutral reserve fund to prohibit the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) from taking into consideration a project&#8217;s greenhouse gas emissions when considering whether to fund
a project
Background
In 2007, OPIC committed itself to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from OPIC-supported projects by 20 percent over a period of ten years, and established an annual emissions cap for all new OPIC-supported projects
with significant greenhouse gas emissions. Then, in March 2009, OPIC announced its intent to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions from 20 to 30 percent in OPIC-supported projects over a ten-year period.
In December 2009, the fiscal year 2010 omnibus measure included language that required OPIC to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent over a ten year period, and 50 percent over a 15 year period.
Testimony heard by the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on African Affairs and Global Health Policy indicates that these policies have had the effect of removing OPIC altogether from the business of financing projects that deal in natural gas.
While there
are some areas of rural Africa that would benefit from alternative energy projects, natural gas is still needed to power Africa.
OPIC should not be constrained from supporting projects that deal in natural gas.
Flake Amendment #820: To End the &#8220;Defense Rapid Innovation Project&#8221;
Summary
Would create a spending-neutral reserve fund to end the Defense Rapid Innovation Program.
Background
In the wake of the ban on earmarks to for-profit companies in 2010, a new program was established in the FY 2011 National Defense Authorization Act called the Defense Rapid Innovation Program.
According to the
authorizing bill, the intent of the program was &#8220;to stimulate innovative technologies and reduce acquisition or lifecycle costs, address technical risks, improve the timeliness and thoroughness of test and evaluation outcomes, and rapidly insert such products
directly in support of primarily major defense acquisition programs, but also other defense acquisition programs that meet critical national security needs.&#8221;
At the time of its conception,
CQ
reported that &#8220;skeptics see it as a possible end run around recent earmark restrictions.&#8221;
While the Pentagon has never requested funds for this program, Congress has appropriated $845 million dollars over the course
of four years for this program.
At a time when we have resorted to using off-budget &#8220;war funding&#8221; to fund programs critical to national security, we should not be spending funds for anything the Pentagon does not want.

Flake Amendment #821: To Prohibit the Forest Service from Finalizing and Implementing its Proposed Groundwater Directive
Summary
Would establish a spending-neutral reserve fund prohibiting the Forest Service from finalizing and implementing its proposed groundwater directive.
Background
On May 6, 2014, the Forest Service published a proposed directive to establish guidelines for the management of groundwater on Forest Service land. The proposal contains several flaws. It would enable the Forest
Service to interject itself in the state water right application process for water rights on lands adjacent to National Forest System lands, potentially interfering with private property rights.
It also assumes a hydraulic connection between groundwater and
surface water; an assumption that runs contrary to water law in some states like Arizona.
The current proposal was developed without sufficient consultation with states and Native American tribes, all of whom could be affected by the Forest Service&#8217;s final decision. Finally, the legal authority for claiming jurisdiction over groundwater below National
Forest System land is questionable.
The Forest Service has indicated that it plans to identify a path forward this year.
Flake Amendment #823: To Reduce Duplicative Federal Financial Literacy Programs
Summary
Would establish a deficit neutral reserve fund to implement the Government Accountability Office&#8217;s (GAO) recommendation related to duplication of Financial Literacy Programs
Background
In 2013, then-U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) offered an amendment to the budget to eliminate program duplication, fragmentation, and overlap within the 15 &#8220;financial literacy&#8221; programs under 13 departments and
agencies identified by the 2012 GAO on duplication.
In an April 2014 report, GAO updated Congress on the recommendations it made in the 2012, noting its recommendation to Treasury and CFPB that the Financial Literacy and Education Commission identify for federal agencies and Congress options for consolidating
federal financial literacy efforts into the agencies and activities best suited or most effective&#8221; has not been implemented. That report noted progress &#8211; the elimination or defunding of 3 out of 16 financial literacy programs and 1 out of 4 housing counseling
programs &#8211; but stressed the need for determination of the most effective allocation of federal resources, without which &#8220;policy makers lack information to avoid overlap.&#8221;
This amendment requires the Commission to implement GAO&#8217;s recommendation.

Flake Amendment #819: To Repeal the Wind Production Tax Credit
Summary
Would establish a spending neutral reserve fund to relating to repeal of the wind production tax credit (PTC) 2014 extension.
Background
The wind PTC was enacted in 1992 to give the nascent wind industry a boost, and 23 years later wind-power generation is no longer an infant industry, and is no longer in need of federal support. This extension
costs over $6 billion over a ten year period.

Flake Amendment #824: To Create Transparency in Federal Crop Insurance Subsidies
Summary
Would establish a spending-neutral reserve fund to create
transparency in the Federal crop insurance program, which may include disclosing the names of recipients of Federal subsidy payments for crop insurance.
Background
In FY 2014, taxpayers spent more than $8.7 billion on federal crop insurance. Yet, there is no transparency in who receives these premium subsidies from the federal government, unlike other federal agriculture
programs, including conservation programs and other commodity supports.
This amendment would require USDA to extend the same transparency standards used for the direct payments program to individuals or entities that obtain federally subsidized crop insurance. Specifically, it would
enable the Secretary of Agriculture to disclose the names of recipients of federal subsidy payments for crop insurance for the purposes of increasing transparency and accountability.
