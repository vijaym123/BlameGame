Dear Neighbor,
This week, our office opened its
6,000 th
constituent case ! It&rsquo;s something that rarely makes headlines but it&rsquo;s the most important part of the job. Our first and most important job is to be a resource for everyone in the district to help navigate through bureaucratic red tape and confusion.
That&rsquo;s why we hold so many town halls (more than 130 so far, with
four more this weekend ) &ndash; to be as accessible as possible.
Our district covers 11 counties &ndash; together about the size of New Jersey &ndash; but we have five offices across the district and a great team ready to help. Our door is always open &ndash;
stop by or give us a call .
REED HOSTS SENIOR RESOURCE EVENT
We were in Chautauqua County early this week for a senior resource event bringing together Social Security, health care, veterans and a host of other experts under the same roof. The event was also a chance to talk about what we&rsquo;re doing in Washington to reauthorize the
Older Americans Act
and secure long-term support for our
rural hospitals .
REED PROTECTS EMPLOYEE PAYCHECKS, WORK HOURS
I voted in the House this week to increase workers&rsquo; paychecks and hours threatened under Obamacare&rsquo;s 30-hour rule. The
Save American Workers Act
restores the traditional 40-hour work week that Obamacare reduces to 30 hours. It&rsquo;s not fair that the President&rsquo;s health care law is taking hours away from employees and making their paychecks smaller. Families rely on a 40-hour work week to support their families.
VIDEO: TOM REED RECOGNIZES APRIL AS SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH
This week, I led the House in recognizing April as Sexual Assault Awareness Month by inviting my colleagues to join me to spread the word about the importance of awareness and prevention. My colleague Rep. Gwen Moore and I also introduced a resolution supporting the goals and ideals of sexual assault awareness. Please join me this and every month to talk about sexual assault prevention &ndash; more ways to get involved
here .
REED CONCENTRATES ON OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT
The bipartisan
Natural Gas Caucus
met with leading experts to talk about how to best prepare the next generation of American workers in the rapidly changing field of domestic energy production. Panelists from academia, research and the natural gas industry focused on the skills gap between the labor force and employers and how we can fill that gap to get Americans back to work.
