Merry Christmas
My family
and I wish you and your loved ones a very Merry Christmas and Happy
Hanukkah. At this time of celebration and fellowship, we are reminded of
how blessed we are to live in a nation that respects, protects and
celebrates individual freedom and human dignity. We are also mindful that
too many of our fellow citizens are still struggling
today
to make ends meet and to provide for their families
and pursue their dreams. May the new year bring new opportunity as we
strive to work toward positive solutions to the myriad of challenges
facing our great nation.
God bless and Happy New Year.
Talking Budget and
Economy
In an interview that aired this
Sunday on C-SPANs Newsmakers, I joined Greta Brawner of C-SPAN, Damian
Paletta of the Wall Street Journal and Andrew Taylor of the Associated
Press in a discussion about the fiscal and economic challenges facing
the nation. The interview focused on the role the House Budget
Committee
which I will have the honor of chairing in the upcoming 114th
Congress
will play in helping craft solutions to move the country
forward in the new year.

U.S.-Cuba Policy
Last week, President Obama announced that his administration would be
seeking significant changes in U.S. policy towards Cuba. Unfortunately,
this is the latest example of the Obama Administration's disturbing
tendency to try and curry favor with brutal, oppressive regimes who
don't share our values or commitment to individual freedom while
alienating our allies who do. It's neither diplomatically shrewd nor in the
best interests of those within these nations who desire to live in a
free and open society. While we raise these concerns and look to get more
answers about the Administration's actions, we welcome and are
thankful for the news that Alan Gross has been returned to his
family.
