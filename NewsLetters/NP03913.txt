Blaine's Bulletin
While you were with your family and loved ones on Thanksgiving Eve getting ready to enjoy some turkey, the Obama Administration was busy preparing an extra helping of regulations, 3,415 to be exact. With the release of its annual regulation road map the administration has made clear that it plans on continuing its burdensome regulatory agenda in 2015 and beyond.
One proposed regulation from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone per the requirements of the Clean Air Act. Essentially, the EPA could lower the level from 75 parts per billion (ppb) in the atmosphere to 60 ppb.
Let me explain this further. Currently, the EPAs requirement for ozone was issued in 2008 and is only now being implemented and it continues to drive billions of dollars in new environmental compliance costs. Not only are billions of dollars being spent, the proposed regulation cost is even more frightening. By the EPAs own analysis this regulation could end up costing more than a trillion dollars over the next ten years and has the potential to lead to nearly 2.9 million fewer jobs. A study done by the National Association of Manufacturers found that these job losses could be more than 40,000 in Missouri alone.
To combat this regulation, I am a cosponsor of the
Clean Air and Strong Economies Act
which would force the EPA to consider economic impacts and the feasibility of its regulations. It would not allow the EPA to update the current requirement until at least 85 percent of counties in the country have come into compliance with the existing rule. In addition, it would require the EPA to issue a cost-benefit analysis without cherry picking data by using co-benefits.
Another regulation that has received a lot of attention is the Waters of the U.S. proposal. The EPA has said the final rule definition will be released in 2015, even though a large, bipartisan group of members in Congress have opposed this proposed rule. I have been out front of this issue and I have consistently said this proposed rule is a federal grab of our nations waters. I am a proud cosponsor of legislation to combat Waters of the U.S and earlier this year, the House voted and passed a measure to rescind the rule.
Another frustrating fact is these two proposed regulations, and the hundreds of proposed regulations, will not have any significant impact in improving our nations environment. It is simply hurting our nations small businesses, farmers, ranchers and individuals by forcing them to comply with more rules.
Since Ive been in Congress, I have been committed to combatting the burdensome regulations and this latest batch has proved to be even more worrisome. I have heard from far too many of you about the numerous regulatory burdens from the EPA that threaten jobs and increase energy prices and I will continue to support legislation to reverse those troubling trends.
