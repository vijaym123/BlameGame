Dear Friend,
There is a lot to report from
the Second District this week, but first I would like to say that my
thoughts and prayers are with the families of the paratroopers that were
killed and wounded in a training accident in Ft. Bragg Friday morning.
We owe a debt of gratitude to the men and women of our armed forces,
both at home and abroad, for the sacrifices they make every
day.
In this newsletter, you will find information and photos from
some of my activities that took place this week across the district. On
Wednesday, I moderated a panel discussion in Cary on the issue of
immigration reform. This is an important and complex issue that affects us
here in the Second District in many ways. This discussion was only
the first of several events I hope to host, which will allow for
constituents to voice their concerns and be heard on this
issue.
Also this week, I visited several local businesses -- touring their
facilities, meeting with and taking questions from employees -- including
LabCorp, MOM brands and Challenge Printing.
You will find
several photos below from my visit to the Lee County Innovation Center
at CCCC where I spoke with company directors and instructors
and had the chance to meet with students in the welding program.
I
also spoke to the Asheboro Rotary Club and visited with Asheboro City
Manager John Ogburn and Mayor David Smith. Meeting with company and
city leaders throughout this last week was both informative and
insightful. I am thankful for these invitations to stop by and visit, as it
allowed for me to meet and discuss their questions and
concerns.
At the end of the week, I appeared
"On the
Record" with Greta Van Susteren
to discuss what the Energy and
Commerce Committee is doing in response to FCC attempts to violate
journalists' First Amendment rights. The FCC is unfairly interfering in
journalists editorial processes with a media study that would send
researchers into newsrooms. You will find a link to the video of that
interview in the right sidebar. Please share this information by forwarding
this email to your friends.
It is such an honor to
represent the people of the Second District. Please contact my offices in
Dunn, Asheboro and Washington with your questions, concerns and requests
for assistance. We are here to serve you!
Opening the Discussion on Immigration
The issue of immigration is a tough one that must be
addressed. There is no one who would claim that our current system is
working. This week, I hosted a panel discussion on the issue with local
business and faith leaders who talked about how immigration affects their
companies and communities.
The event was open
to the public, and I was pleased to see attendance exceeded
expectations. Some of the media accounts from the event can be found below
under
In the News .

Rep. Ellmers moderates
immigration reform discussion in Cary
NBC 17
WNCN
"Congresswoman Renee Ellmers moderated a panel of local
business leaders as part of a discussion on immigration reform and its impact
on North Carolina's economy. The panel stopped short of laying out a
specific plan for immigration reform..."
Ellmers shows courage on immigration
reform
Editorial - Raleigh News &amp; Observer
"Congress has
avoided doing anything meaningful about immigration for decades, and
presidents who have tried to lead have typically given up after finding
a lack of determination on Capitol Hill. That Ellmers would even
demonstrate an interest in doing something and offer general ideas about
how to do it represents political courage."
Rep. Ellmers calls for updated immigration reform
laws
Time Warner Cable/News 14
Carolina
"Congresswoman Renee Ellmers wants to bring federal immigration policies up
to date. During a forum on immigration reform in Cary on Wednesday,
Ellmers said new laws would improve North Carolina's work force and
attract companies here."
