Dear Friend,
America lost a true patriot this week with the passing of my
predecessor and respected friend, former Congressman Ike Skelton. I
have appreciated our conversations over the past two and a half years
and the commitment we shared to see Missouri's 4th District prosper. I
am thankful for Ike's tireless efforts on behalf of our men and women
in uniform and know our country is safer as a result of his unwavering
leadership.
The day following Ike's passing, House Armed Services Committee
Chairman Buck McKeon best summed up how Ike, who had previously chaired
the committee, was viewed by military men and women. Buck said: "It was
always difficult to have a conversation with Ike in public because our
troops were always stopping him to thank him, to have their picture
taken with him, or to let him know how his service had made theirs
better. Ike was always humble when he met them. There is no tribute we
can offer that can ever match the gratitude of those men and women."
My thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time.
I am thankful for the opportunity to have known him and know the
country is safer as a result of his efforts.
On a related note, the House approved several pieces of legislation
this week that will benefit veterans.
H.R. 2189 establishes a commission or task force to evaluate the
backlog of disability claims of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
This is a problem I have been focusing on since my time began in the
House. Many veterans in Missouri's 4th District have been waiting far
too long for determination on their claims. This task force will
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of those claims at the VA and give
priority in the claims process to veterans who are older than 70, are
terminally ill, have a life-threatening illness, are homeless, were
awarded the Medal of Honor, or who are former prisoners of war. I am
hopeful this will help address this long-standing issue.
The House also approved H.R. 2011 - the Veterans' Advisory Committee on
Education Improvement Act, reauthorizing the Veterans' Advisory
Committee on Education through December of 2015, and modifying the
composition of the Committee to include veterans of recent operations
in Iraq and Afghanistan. This committee is involved with education and
training programs for veterans. Committee members advise the Secretary
of Veterans Affairs on existing education benefit programs and
services, while recommending needed new education benefit programs and
services.
We passed H.R. 1742 - the Vulnerable Veterans Housing Reform Act - to
make sure severely disabled veterans are not penalized for receiving VA
benefits when applying for in-home aid, Section 8 or public housing
rental assistance.
The final veterans' bill we passed this week was H.R. 2481 - the
Veterans Economic Opportunity Act of 2013. It establishes the Veterans
Economic Opportunity Administration to manage the GI Bill, Home Loan
Guarantee and Rehabilitations and Employment programs.
We owe our veterans and their families so much. I urge the Senate to
quickly approve these common sense ideas to improve the lives of our
veterans and to send these bills to President Obama.
Lastly, I had the honor this week of meeting a Korean War veteran who
was one of three brothers to have proudly served our country.
84-year-old Gene Boyd served in Korea after his two brothers,
85-year-old Charles Boyd and 83-year-old Raymond Boyd, served during
World War II. I met with Gene, his wife Pat, and their three daughters
in St. Robert, near Fort Leonard Wood. Gene's family members are so
proud of him and were eager to share so many wonderful memories.
The three brothers were orphaned at an early age, went their separate
ways, and happily were able to reconnect in their later years. Gene and
Raymond live in Richland while their brother, Charles, now lives in the
State of Washington. All three are headed to Washington, D.C. next week
to visit the World War II Memorial, and had requested that I meet with
them there. I will not be in Washington during their visit, but I
wanted to meet with them to thank them on behalf of a grateful nation.
I was so honored to have met with Gene and, while his brothers were
unable to attend our meeting, I thank all three of these heroes for
their service to our country.
Have a great week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
America
lost
a
true
patriot
this
week
with
the
passing
of
my
predecessor
and
respected
friend,
former
Congressman
Ike
Skelton.
I
have
appreciated
our
conversations
over
the
past
two
and
a
half
years
and
the
commitment
we
shared
to
see
Missouri's
4th
District
prosper.
I
am
thankful
for
Ike's
tireless
efforts
on
behalf
of
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
and
know
our
country
is
safer
as
a
result
of
his
unwavering
leadership.
The
day
following
Ike&#8217;s
passing,
House
Armed
Services
Committee
Chairman
Buck
McKeon
best
summed
up
how
Ike,
who
had
previously
chaired
the
committee,
was
viewed
by
military
men
and
women.
Buck
said:
&#8220;It
was
always
difficult
to
have
a
conversation
with
Ike
in
public
because
our
troops
were
always
stopping
him
to
thank
him,
to
have
their
picture
taken
with
him,
or
to
let
him
know
how
his
service
had
made
theirs
better.
Ike
was
always
humble
when
he
met
them.
There
is
no
tribute
we
can
offer
that
can
ever
match
the
gratitude
of
those
men
and
women.&#8221;
My
thoughts
and
prayers
are
with
his
family
during
this
difficult
time.
I
am
thankful
for
the
opportunity
to
have
known
him
and
know
the
country
is
safer
as
a
result
of
his
efforts.
On
a
related
note,
the

that

H.R.

establishes
a

or

of

claims
of
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs.
This
is
a
problem
I
have
been
focusing
on
since
my
time
began
in
the
House.
Many
veterans
in
Missouri's
4th
District
have
been
waiting
far
too
long
for
determination
on
their
claims.
This
task
force
will
conduct
a
comprehensive
evaluation
of
those
claims
at
the
VA
and
give
priority
in
the
claims
process
to
veterans
who
are
older
than
70,
are
terminally
ill,
have
a
life-threatening
illness,
are
homeless,
were
awarded
the
Medal
of
Honor,
or
who
are
former
prisoners
of
war.
I
am
hopeful
this
will
help
address
this
long-standing
issue.
The
House
also
approved
H.R.
2011
-
the
Veterans&#8217;
Advisory

reauthorizing

This

the
Secretary
of
Veterans
Affairs
on
existing

while
recommending
needed
new

to
make

The
final

bill
we
passed
this

was
H.R.

the

It
establishes
the
Veterans

We

so
much.
I

the
Senate
to
quickly
approve
these
common
sense
ideas
to
improve
the
lives
of
our
veterans
and
to
send
these

Lastly,
I
had
the
honor
this
week
of
meeting
a
Korean
War
veteran
who
was
one
of
three
brothers
to
have
proudly
served
our
country.
84-year-old
Gene
Boyd
served
in
Korea
after
his
two
brothers,
85-year-old
Charles
Boyd
and
83-year-old
Raymond
Boyd,
served
during
World
War
II.
I
met
with
Gene,
his
wife
Pat,
and
their
three
daughters
in
St.
Robert,
near
Fort
Leonard
Wood.
Gene&#8217;s
family
members
are
so
proud
of
him
and
were
eager
to
share
so
many
wonderful
memories.
The
three
brothers
were
orphaned
at
an
early
age,
went
their
separate
ways,
and
happily
were
able
to
reconnect
in
their
later
years.
Gene
and
Raymond
live
in
Richland
while
their
brother,
Charles,
now
lives
in
the
State
of
Washington.
All
three
are
headed
to
Washington,
D.C.
next
week
to
visit
the
World
War
II
Memorial,
and
had
requested
that
I
meet
with
them
there.
I
will
not
be
in
Washington
during
their
visit,
but
I
wanted
to
meet
with
them
to
thank
them
on
behalf
of
a
grateful
nation.
I
was
so
honored
to
have
met
with
Gene
and,
while
his
brothers
were
unable
to
attend
our
meeting,
I
thank
all
three
of
these
heroes
for
their
service
to
our
country.
Have
a
great
week.
