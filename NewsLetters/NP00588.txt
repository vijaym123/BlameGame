This month, the House passed the annual defense policy bill ( H.R. 1735 ), which
seeks
to maintain current capabilities, prepare for future threats, sustain Americas technological advantage in the years ahead, and maintain a stable military balance to deter conflict and secure the interests of the United States and its allies. This bill was overwhelmingly passed by the House Armed Services Committee and later passed by a bipartisan vote on the House floor.
Defense Secretary Ash Carter, however, openly
rejected
the proposal, calling it a road to nowhere at a Senate hearing. Despite the fact that Secretary Carter acknowledged sequestration would be devastating for the military and cause a crisis in national defense, he stated his support of the Administrations determination to veto any bill that lifts sequestration from defense, if it does not also lift it from the IRS, EPA, and other federal agencies that are not related to national security. Watch Congressman Forbes questioning Secretary Carter about the impacts of sequestration on national security,
