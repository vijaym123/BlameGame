Preventing Predators From Slipping Through Cracks
This is a great time of year. Students across the country are packing lunches, lining up at the bus stop, and arriving at school excited about what the day will bring. I experience this each fall with my own three children.
Unfortunately, since January 1, 325 teachers have been arrested for sexual misconduct with children. Seventeen of those were Pennsylvania teachers. This is horrifying and heartbreaking, and we should never stop doing all we can to prevent it.
That is why I introduced the bipartisan Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act with Democratic Senator Joe Manchin. This bill would require regular background checks of school employees who have access to children -- preventing employees from slipping through the cracks.

Serving With Honor
Just got a great note from Sharon Moore of Phoenixville, Pa. about her daughter, Cadet Shawna Moore!
Shawna was awarded the "Best Overall New Cadet of West Point Class of 2018." I was honored to nominate her to the
United States Military Academy at West Point .
I'm so proud of her accomplishments and her desire to serve our country.
Travelling Across Pennsylvania
This Congress,
I've visited each and every one of Pennsylvania's 67 counties . It is important to me to listen to what is on the minds of folks all across Pennsylvania.
In fact, in August alone, I met with Pennsylvanians in 20 different counties.
I held town hall meetings and business forums, toured manufacturing companies, and visited with veterans associations, women business leaders, crisis shelter managers, and the Boy Scouts.
I heard a lot of concerns about the excessive regulation, taxes, red ink, and spending coming out of Washington.
I agree that these problems must be addressed.
I'll continue to travel across this great state to hear what Pennsylvanians have to say and to inform my decisions in Washington.
Coaching With Dignity
Chuck Noll was one of the greatest coaches in NFL history and played a huge part in turning the Steelers franchise into the powerhouse we know today. His hands-on approach earned him four Super Bowl titles, nearly 200 career wins, and a place in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
Along with Senator Bob Casey,
I have commemorated Noll's achievements
by designating Sunday, September 7, 2014 as "Chuck Noll Day" as the Steelers take on their division rival - the Cleveland Browns. Go Steelers! (Photo credit: Rick Stewart, Getty Images)
