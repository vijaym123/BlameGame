Wicker Renews Efforts to Uphold
10 th
Amendment Protections
Excessive Executive Action Threatens Constitutional System
of
Checks and Balances
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution,
nor prohibited
by it to the States, are reserved to the States
respectively, or to the people.
U.S. Constitution, 10 th
Amendment
The Obama
Administration has made it clear that it is willing to circumvent
Congress to achieve its priorities.
An overhaul of immigration law,
unreasonable rules on carbon dioxide emissions, and dozens of major
changes to Obamacare are a few examples of the Presidents
oversteps.
Like many Americans, I am troubled that these actions
blatantly supersede the authority of the executive branch as set forth in
the Constitution.
Our founding document gives Congress the sole
authority to create and enact legislation.
The President is
directed to take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed
not rewrite
them.
Bill of Rights Limits
Federal Power
The Administrations repeated
unilateral overreach is a direct challenge to the separation of powers
at the heart of our democracy.
Rather than governing by
consensus, the President has routinely attempted to impose his agenda
singlehandedly, putting the will of federal bureaucrats over the will of the
people.
Many of these decisions to bypass Congress have ended up
in the courts, creating long and costly legal battles.
In
the coming days, I plan to reintroduce the Restoring the
10 th
Amendment Act as a way to help rein in the federal
governments rampant power grabs and hold the Administration accountable.
As part of the Bill of Rights, the 10 th
Amendment
provides a clear limit on Washingtons encroachment into Americans
lives.
My bill would uphold our countrys critical
system of checks and balances by returning power to where it belongs
with states and individuals.
It would offer state officials another
tool to challenge the Administrations unconstitutional
actions.
Specifically, the bill would ensure that these officials have
standing in court to dispute proposed federal regulations that violate the
10 th
Amendment.
A Flood of Rules and Regulations
The broad
scope of federal agencies rulemaking should not be ignored.
The Federal Register, which publishes proposed and final agency
regulations, reached nearly 80,000 pages last year.
According to the
Competitive Enterprise Institute, five of the six years with the greatest
number of Federal Register pages have occurred during the Obama
Administration.
So far, the Administration has issued approximately
21,000 rules, averaging 3,500 each year.
Meanwhile, public
confidence in the federal government is at historic lows.
The
most recent General Social Survey, conducted by the independent
research organization NORC at the University of Chicago, shows only 11
percent of Americans have great confidence in the executive branch. A
record-high 44 percent have hardly any confidence at all.
Our
Founding Fathers understood the danger of unchecked power and set forth
principles like the 10 th
Amendment to safeguard our
republics limited government.
Members of Congress have a
responsibility to make sure that the Administration does not abuse these
principles for its own gain.
My Restoring the 10 th
Amendment
Act would uphold this responsibility while defending the rights of
states and the American people.
