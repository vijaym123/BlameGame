Dear Friends,
This week I
will continue a push for transparent, honest dialogue with the
Veterans Administration. Problems are only solved when we can look each
other in the eye and talk openly about solutions. Recent and ongoing
allegations into VA health care system are disturbing. Nothing is more
serious, however, than those reports that have surfaced from the
Albuquerque VA Medical Center. These veterans are our neighbors, our friends,
our brothers and sisters.
I was disappointed Friday when the
Albuquerque VA Medical Center refused to allow media into the meeting
I had with its administrators. But during the meeting,
seven veterans, State Senator and disabled veteran Craig
Brandt, Secretary of Veterans' Services Tim Hale and I were able to speak directly
with the VA staff to begin a dialogue.
We discussed a
number of issues, including allowing veterans to see local doctors,
assigning patient advocates, wait times and scheduling. The veterans
shared their stories. Some had struggled greatly and some had success
stories.
I asked the Albuquerque VA administration
for answers and solutions. I have asked them to return to the table in
the next few weeks.
Most
urgently, I have requested that the VA allow our rural veterans to seek care with
their local doctors. This is something I have sought for many years.
Now, with what has come to light in recent weeks, it is time to allow
veterans the option to see local providers without delay.
There is no reason our veterans should wait six months to a year for
an appointment, and drive up to five hours, one way, for care.
The price is too high -- for the veteran's health and for the
government.
I also have ongoing, serious concerns that the
national audit released by the VA last week does not reflect a true picture
of how our veterans are served. According to the federal audit,
performed using the VA's internal computer system, established patients
only waited eight days to see a doctor. It also showed that only 8
percent of patients had appointments scheduled beyond 45
days.
These numbers do not reflect what veterans report to be true. I asked
Interim Director Dr. James Robbins about this data. He also
questioned the validity of the numbers and reported problems with the
scheduling system.
The VA's downplaying of this disastrous
situation needs to end. Until we shine a light on this, we can't start
fixing the problem. This week, I will release information that will
confirm what New Mexico's veterans have been saying, and what I have been
hearing from them, for years.
This is the time for real
answers. We need transparency and open dialogue. I will continue to push
the VA for open meetings and further discussions.
Have you heard
"Congressional Review" this week?
Every weekend, I'm on the radio across New
Mexico discussing important legislation, events in New Mexico, and my
work in Congress.
Be sure to tune in!
If you haven't
heard the show, call your local radio station to ask when Congressional
Review is on the air in your hometown! ?xml:namespace

job growth, veterans, and other issues important to New
Mexicans.
