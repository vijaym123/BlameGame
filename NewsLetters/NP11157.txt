David -- This time tomorrow, Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s top deputy will be on his way to our district to headline a huge fundraiser with ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling.
The amount of money this fundraiser could bring in for Schilling is nothing less than disturbing. We have to take action immediately. David -- according to our records, it appears you haven&rsquo;t made an online gift for Cheri in 2014. Well, this could not be a better moment to give.
