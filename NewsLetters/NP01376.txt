Dear Fellow Earthlings,
Today we celebrate the 45th anniversary of Earth Day. Earth Day is one
of my favorite days of the year because it inspires people around the
world to come together in appreciation of our planets many gifts. Its
also a day that reminds me of a special memory. I was a young naval
flight officer stationed near San Francisco in 1970 and I joined
thousands of people there to celebrate one of the very first Earth
Days. It was a transformative experience for me and served as an
inspiration for me to pursue a life in public service.
Protections for our environment have come a long way since 1970. Later
that year the Environmental Protection Agency was established by
President Richard Nixon and since its founding, important legislation
and regulations have cleaned up our water and air tremendously. But
there is still more to be done to ensure a healthy planet for our
children and grandchildren.
As ranking member of the Senate Subcommittee on Clear Air and Nuclear
Safety, I work together with my colleagues almost every day to confront
our countrys environmental challenges. Some opponents to environmental
laws and regulations have said that a clean environment comes at the
expense of a strong economy. We know now more than ever that this is a
false choice and a tradeoff we dont have to make. Failing to protect
the environment or dealing with climate change is the most costly
option there is
especially for our low-lying and coastal state, which
is susceptible to sea-level rise and extreme weather events like Super
Storm Sandy.
The good news is many of the best ways to combat climate change and
clean our environment are also some of the best ways to strengthen our
economy. There are countless economic benefits for you and our country
when we recycle, use vehicles and appliances that are more fuel
efficient, and invest in our clean energy future. On Earth Day and
every day, lets recommit to our individual and collective efforts to
do our part to ensure Earths thriving future.
As always, I hope you will reach out to me to discuss this issue or any
other on Twitter
or Facebook
.
Happy Earth Day,

Dear
Fellow
Earthlings,
Today
we
celebrate
the
45th
anniversary
of
Earth
Day.
Earth
Day
is
one
of
my
favorite
days
of
the
year
because
it
inspires
people
around
the
world
to
come
together
in
appreciation
of
our
planet&#146;s
many
gifts.
It&#146;s
also
a
day
that
reminds
me
of
a
special
memory.
I
was
a
young
naval
flight
officer
stationed
near
San
Francisco
in
1970
and
I
joined
thousands
of
people
there
to
celebrate one
of
the
very
first
Earth
Days.
It
was
a
transformative
experience
for
me
and
served
as
an
inspiration
for
me
to
pursue
a
life
in
public
service.
Protections
for
our
environment
have
come
a
long
way
since
1970.
Later
that
year
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
was
established
by
President
Richard
Nixon
and
since
its
founding,
important
legislation
and
regulations
have
cleaned
up
our
water
and
air
tremendously.
But
there
is
still
more
to
be
done
to
ensure
a
healthy
planet
for
our
children
and
grandchildren.
As
ranking
member
of
the
Senate
Subcommittee
on
Clear
Air
and
Nuclear
Safety ,
I
work
together
with
my
colleagues
almost
every
day
to
confront
our
country&#146;s
environmental
challenges.
Some
opponents
to
environmental
laws
and
regulations
have
said
that
a
clean
environment
comes
at
the
expense
of
a
strong
economy.
We
know
now
more
than
ever
that
this
is
a
false
choice
and
a
tradeoff
we
don&#146;t
have
to
make.
Failing
to
protect
the
environment
or
dealing
with
climate
change
is
the
most
costly
option
there
is
&#150;
especially
for
our
low-lying
and
coastal
state,
which
is
susceptible
to
sea-level
rise
and
extreme
weather
events
like
Super
Storm
Sandy.
The
good
news
is
many
of
the
best
ways
to
combat
climate
change
and
clean
our
environment
are
also
some
of
the
best
ways
to
strengthen
our
economy.
There
are
countless
economic
benefits
for
you
and
our
country
when
we
recycle,
use
vehicles
and
appliances
that
are more
fuel
efficient,
and
invest
in
our
clean
energy
future.
On
Earth
Day
and
every
day,
let&#146;s
recommit
to
our
individual
and
collective
efforts
to
do
our
part
to
ensure
Earth&#146;s
thriving
future.
As
always,
I
hope
you
will
reach
out
to
me
to
discuss
this
issue
or
any
other
on
Twitter
or
