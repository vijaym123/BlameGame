Friends,
I want to share with you some of the work I have been doing to create
jobs and economic opportunity in Central New York.
If we want to grow our economy and create jobs, we need to get serious
about making smart investments in infrastructure. Unfortunately, lack
of investment in local infrastructure has hindered our region's ability
to grow and prosper at the pace it could. Crumbling roads and bridges,
decaying water systems, lack of access to high-speed internet in some
areas and the need for more efficient transportation options into and
out of Central New York are some of the most pressing challenges facing
our region.
That's why on Monday I joined local community leaders at the Erie Canal
Museum in Syracuse to announce a new infrastructure plan for Central
New York. This plan was the result of a number of meetings and
Infrastructure Roundtables I held across the 24th district, as well as
feedback from a survey I sent to people across the region. My plan
includes recommendations to make infrastructure a priority, protect
local resources, and invest in the transportation networks that will
help businesses thrive in Central New York. This includes modernizing
roads and bridges, airports, ports, high-speed rail systems, water and
sewer systems, energy smart grids, and high-speed internet. I encourage
you to read the full plan here
and
read the op-ed
I wrote in last
Sunday's Post-Standard about my plan to invest in infrastructure.
Rep. Maffei announcing his infrastructure plan in Syracuse on Monday.
In order to increase economic opportunities for job seekers in Central
New York and connect local businesses, organizations, and agencies with
skilled workers, I will be hosting a Job and Opportunity Fair on
Monday, July 21st from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM at the Holiday Inn; 441
Electronics Parkway, Liverpool, NY 13088. Our last Job and Opportunity
Fair in January was a great success, and I hope you'll join us in a few
weeks and spread the word to people in your community who might be
interested in attending.
As always, I encourage you to contact my office to share your thoughts
and concerns. It is an honor to represent you in the U.S. House of
Representatives.
Sincerely,
Member of Congress

Friends,
I
want
to
share
with
you
some
of
the
work
I
have
been
doing
to
create
jobs
and
economic
opportunity
in
Central
New
York.
If
we
want
to
grow
our
economy
and
create
jobs,
we
need
to
get
serious
about
making
smart
investments
in
infrastructure.
Unfortunately,
lack
of
investment
in
local
infrastructure
has
hindered
our
region's
ability
to
grow
and
prosper
at
the
pace
it
could.
Crumbling
roads
and
bridges,
decaying
water
systems,
lack
of
access
to
high-speed
internet
in
some
areas
and
the
need
for
more
efficient
transportation
options
into
and
out
of
Central
New
York
are
some
of
the
most
pressing
challenges
facing
our
region.
That&#8217;s
why
on
Monday
I
joined
local
community
leaders
at
the
Erie
Canal
Museum
in
Syracuse
to
announce
a
new
infrastructure
plan
for
Central
New
York.
This
plan
was
the
result
of
a
number
of
meetings
and
Infrastructure
Roundtables
I
held
across
the
24th
district,
as
well
as
feedback
from
a
survey
I
sent
to
people
across
the
region.
My
plan
includes
recommendations
to
make
infrastructure
a
priority,
protect
local
resources,
and
invest
in
the
transportation
networks
that
will
help
businesses
thrive
in
Central
New
York.
This
includes
modernizing
roads
and
bridges,
airports,
ports,
high-speed
rail
systems,
water
and
sewer
systems,
energy
smart
grids,
and
high-speed
internet. I
encourage
you
to
read
the
full
plan
here
and
read
the
op-ed
I
wrote
in
last
Sunday&#8217;s
Post-Standard
about
my
plan
to
invest
in
infrastructure.
Rep.
Maffei
announcing
his
infrastructure
plan
in
Syracuse
on
Monday.
In
order
to
increase
economic
opportunities
for
job
seekers
in
Central
New
York
and
connect
local
businesses,
organizations,
and
agencies
with
skilled
workers,
I
will
be
hosting
a
Job

AM
to
3:00
PM
at
the
Holiday
Inn;
441
Electronics
Parkway,
Liverpool,
NY
13088.
Our
last
Job
and
Opportunity
Fair
in
January
was
a
great
success,
and
I
hope
you&#8217;ll
join
us
in
a
few
weeks
and
spread
the
word
to
people
in
your
community
who
might
be

in
attending.
As
always,
I

you

It
