Honoring America's strengths on Independence Day
Dear David,
Families are gathering across the country today to host barbeques, shoot off fireworks, and enjoy our outdoors.
It's a time to celebrate all that America is and has to offer, and to reflect on what makes our country - and Montana - the greatest in the world.
The men and women who serve - and have served - in our armed forces are the reason we've been able to enjoy our freedom for the past 238 years.
That's why I'm working hard to make sure we do a better job of taking care of our service members when they return home.
It's a responsibility that we all share, and one that I don't take lightly.
But for our democracy to remain the envy of the world, we must strengthen the freedoms that many take for granted - and fight back against those who want to chip them away.
That's why I'm protecting our privacy rights by fighting against the bulk collection of Americans' personal information, and standing up for a woman's right to make her own health care decisions.
And I'm making sure people and their ideas, not corporations and their money, decide our elections.
Today, let's remember the freedoms that our founding fathers guaranteed us, and the men and women who have fought to protect them.
Happy Fourth of July,
