Dear Friend:
I want to share with you a blog I wrote about common sense.
Our ranch
The cold weather across much of the country reminds me of a point made by the speaker at the Amarillo Community Prayer Breakfast this year.
He spoke about growing up on a ranch and how that experience leads one to understand that there are consequences to our actions.
If you dont cut the ice, the horses cant drink.
If you dont fix the fence, the cattle will get out.
It sounds simple.
Most of us call it common sense.
But as someone told me one time, The thing about common sense in Washington is that it is not very common.
I think of those things when reading a column by Peggy Noonan that talks about President Obama and common sense.
She points out that he has had very little experience with concrete, tangible things.
His life has been lived with words, and he somehow seems to think that if he speaks the words, it automatically happens.
Things on a ranch dont work that way.
Talking does not get the job done, and in many situations, the fewer words spoken, the better.
Noonan goes on to say that the Administration seems full of people who have seen the movie but never read the book.
They talk in sound bites, worry what the political effects may be, but never really dig down into the substance to fix a problem.
They dont worry about the complexities or think that something may not turn out just like they imagine it; they spout out movie lines.
The health care bill may have sounded good but in reality has been a mess.
And it will get worse.
I probably did not always appreciate the lessons I was learning on those freezing cold days cutting ice or those searing hot days digging post holes, but in any job learning basic common sense is invaluable.
