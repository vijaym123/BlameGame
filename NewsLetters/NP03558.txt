Rogers Co-Sponsors Bill to Repeal Obamacare 30-Hour Rule
Applauds House Passage of the "Save American Workers Act"
WASHINGTON, D.C.
- U.S. Rep. Harold "Hal" Rogers (KY-05) cosponsored and voted for the "Save American Workers Act" ( H.R. 30 ) to repeal an Obamacare mandate that redefined a full-time work week as 30 hours, hampering job creation and cutting American paychecks by as much as 25 percent. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill on Thursday afternoon.
"As Obamacare has rolled out, we've seen the terrible impact the law has had on working families. The wrong-headed 30-hour rule is no exception, as it's destroying jobs and opportunities for lower-income Americans," said Rogers. "The rule forces employers to offer health insurance to employees working 30 hours or more. The unfortunate result is that employers have instead cut employee hours from 40 or more down to 29 or less, meaning many of these workers are losing what they need the most: experience, opportunity and a steady paycheck. The bill we passed will benefit employees by allowing work schedule flexibility and the potential for up to 10 more hours a week, and also help employers focus on growing their business and creating jobs."
A recent study performed by the Labor Center at the University of California, Berkeley and the Hoover Institution showed 2.6 million workers or 3.1% of the United States workforce are at the greatest risk for a reduction of hours due to Obamacare's 30-hour rule.
Rogers urges the Senate to act swiftly on this legislation and encourages President Obama to help fix this job-killing portion of his healthcare law.
Rogers also warned that Obamacare's individual mandate also kicks in this year, and he remains committed to fully repealing the law. Individuals without health insurance will be penalized by a $325 tax or 2% of taxable income. The House attempted to delay the individual mandate last year, but the measure died in the Senate.
The Galen Institute reported "more than 46 significant changes already have been made to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act: at least 28 that President Obama has made unilaterally, 16 that Congress has passed and the President has signed, and 2 by the Supreme Court."
Rogers has served Kentuckys 5th Congressional District since 1981. With a focus on economic development, job creation, fighting illegal drugs and preserving Appalachias natural treasures, he has a reputation for listening to his constituents and fighting for the region he represents.
