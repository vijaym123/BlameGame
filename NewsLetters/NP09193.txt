Wicker Amendments
Reinforce
Preparedness, Security in Defense
Bill
Provisions Support Mississippi's Dynamic
Role in Keeping Our
Military Strong
With
overwhelming bipartisan support, the Senate Armed Services Committee
recently approved this year's "National Defense Authorization Act" (NDAA).
The legislation outlines America's military priorities and
national security interests for the coming years.
As a senior member of the Armed Services Committee,
I was successful in adding several provisions to the bill that would
ensure our troops have the resources they need to fulfill their
missions and keep our nation secure.
Some of the highlights
include:
Strengthening our amphibious
fleet.
I am pleased that NDAA recognizes the importance of
amphibious warships to the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, which utilize
them for diverse tasks
from major combat missions to disaster relief.
Unfortunately, our military's amphibious fleet is aging as
warships reach the end of their expected service lives.
In response to
these challenges and future demands, NDAA includes my amendment to
authorize funding for a twelfth LPD-17 warship.
Keeping our
amphibious fleet ready and capable is important to projecting U.S. power and
countering threats around the
world.
Protecting Mississippi's 155th.
The National
Guard is facing drastic changes under the Obama Administration's
proposal to reduce Army personnel and restructure its aviation program.
I am glad the Committee approved an NDAA amendment I sponsored
with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) to delay these changes for one year
until an independent commission can assess the Army's needs.
The
amendment would also postpone the transfer of the National Guard's
Apache attack helicopters to the Army as outlined in the Army's Aviation
Restructuring Initiative.
As Mississippians know, units like our
state's 155th Heavy Brigade Combat Team have provided critical support
for U.S. operations at home and abroad.
It would be a mistake to
jeopardize this experience and investment by taking ill-considered
action that limits the National Guard's current
capabilities.
Fighting to keep C-130Js at
Keesler.
I have continually asked Air Force officials for more
information about a proposed transfer of 10 C-130J transport aircraft from
Keesler Air Force Base to Little Rock Air Force Base.
Under the
new NDAA bill, the Air Force would be prohibited from transferring the
aircraft until 60 days after submitting a certified report to Congress.
These reports would evaluate the move's national security
implications and its impact on the facility losing the aircraft.
A
detailed assessment is needed to demonstrate whether the transfer from
Keesler
widely recognized as the top Air Force installation in
America
would actually produce projected budgetary
savings.
Preventing military suicides.
Another important amendment I sponsored in this year's NDAA would
assist service members in getting the mental health care they may
need.
Currently, those who are deployed receive the most
comprehensive screenings, despite the fact that the majority of military suicides
occur among those who have never been deployed.
To combat this
tragic and increasingly pervasive problem, my amendment with Sens. Joe
Donnelly (D-Ind.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) would require
in-person mental health screenings each year for all members of the
military.
This year's NDAA still has to
be approved by the full Senate, but its Committee passage represents
significant progress in creating a blueprint for America's defense
spending.
With top-notch Air Force bases and versatile National
Guard units, Mississippi continues to do its part in keeping our military
strong.
Although the reality of sequestration's defense cuts
remains a challenge, there is bipartisan agreement that America's
readiness and security must be prioritized.
