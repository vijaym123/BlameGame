Dear
Friends,
The House of Representatives passed a series of bills this week to
address our nation's energy needs and ensure that all Americans have
access to affordable, abundant domestic energy. I'm proud to support
these bills and efforts to create more jobs here at home by putting our
energy resources to work for West Virginians and Americans all across
the country.
The first bill, the Domestic Prosperity and
Global Freedom Act, would expedite the export of liquefied natural gas
by reduing the backlog of pending export applications at the U.S.
Energy Department.
New technologies have unlocked vast resources
of natural gas across the country, and if you want to see what this
can do for a region, look at northern West Virginia. The Marcellus and
Utica shales mean more jobs for West Virginians. This bill will create
jobs in West Virginia and across the country, grow our nations
economy, and strengthen our relationships with our allies.
The
second bill, the Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an America that Works
Act, would expand domestic oil production, which would help to lower
gasoline prices for families at the pump.
We need to
develop the energy resources we have here in America, including coal,
natural gas and oil. Embracing an all-of-the-above energy strategy will
allow us to use our resources to create American jobs, lower energy
prices, grow our economy and strengthen our national security by reducing
our dependence on foreign energy. This House-passed legislation will
help put our nation on a path to energy independence and affordable
energy for American families.
