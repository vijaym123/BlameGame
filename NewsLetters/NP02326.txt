Dear
Friend,
This week, the House Armed Services Committee held a
hearing to discuss President Obamas proposed Authorization for
Use of Military Force (AUMF) against ISIL . I had the
opportunity to question Ms. Christine Wormuth, Undersecretary of Defense
for Policy and General Lloyd Austin, Commander of U.S. Central Command,
about the costs and long term impacts of an AUMF. Below you will find
the video of my conversation during this hearing.
In this
weeks edition of
Congress in your Inbox
is an
opinion piece I co-wrote with Representative Joe Kennedy III
on
the importance of community colleges. Community colleges are uniquely
positioned to prepare students for the demands of our modern economy
and as a former dean at Middlesex Community College I have seen
firsthand how community colleges can provide a ladder to success for their
students.
Also in this weeks newsletter, you can find an
article about my visit to the
Merrimack Chamber of
Commerces Legislative Breakfast
and information about how to send
submissions to the
2015 Congressional Art Competition .
You can also listen to a recording of my recent
telephone town hall meeting , held on February 24. And finally,
Washington, D.C. got a little more Patriotic this past week when
New England Patriots
owner Robert Kraft stopped by the Capitol
with the Lombardi Trophy!
As always, I look forward to
your feedback via my website, or on
Facebook
and
Twitter . Thank you for staying engaged and enjoy
this edition of
Congress in your Inbox.
Sincerely,
Niki Tsongas
OpEd: Community colleges
open doors
By Representative Niki Tsongas
&amp; Representative Joe Kennedy III
As a former dean at a
community college (Tsongas) and Honorary Chair of the Governors STEM
Council (Kennedy), we have seen firsthand how these institutions
provide a highly individualized ladder to success. You dont need a
microscope to see how a responsible investment in our community colleges and
their students will have far-reaching and long-lasting benefits. ...
