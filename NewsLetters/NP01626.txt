Nominating District 28 Students Into Military Academies
On March 30, I spoke with San Antonio Christian School student Isaiah Meuchelboeck, son of Peter and Lottie Meuchelboeck, regarding his recent acceptance into the United States Military Academy at West Point. Nominating students from my district to military service academies is a responsibility I take very seriously and I look forward to seeing Isaiah succeed in his future endeavors.
In the photo above, I am presenting a Congressional Certificate of Recognition to Isaiah together with his parents and city leaders from his hometown of Windcrest. Pictured from left to right
