The traffic and exploitation of human beings is a $32
billion industry which has become the fastest growing form of organized
crime in the world.
Addressing this issue is one of my top
priorities for this new Congress.
We must be aggressive in our response
if we are to stop trafficking in our lifetime.
As a result, I
have worked tirelessly with my colleagues to introduce twelve bipartisan
bills that address the horrors of human trafficking at home and
abroad, and strengthen protections and assistance for trafficking victims.
These bills will help empower law enforcement, increase public
awareness, punish traffickers, and provide essential resources for
victims.
These bipartisan bills are:
1.
The
Human Trafficking Prevention,
Intervention, and Recovery Act , a bill I cosponsored which would allow
existing Department of Justice grants to be used for emergency housing for
trafficking victims.
2.
The
Stop
Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act
would make it illegal for
websites to advertise sex with minors and would give courts the tools to
prosecute such websites.
3.
The
Human
Trafficking Prioritization Act empowers the Department of States
Bureau to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons to put pressure on
other countries to combat sex trafficking.
4.
The
Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act would focus
on pursuing and prosecuting criminals involved in any part of sex
trafficking.
5.
The
International Megans
Law to Prevent Demand for Child Sex Trafficking
directs
Homeland Security to notify foreign governments when U.S. citizens who are
confirmed child sex offenders travel to their
countries, presumably with the goal of paying for sex with minors.
6.
The
Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking
Act
would make it easier for states to pass safe-harbor laws that help
minors involved in sex trafficking by directing victims toward
child protective services.
7.
The
Human
Trafficking Prevention Act would require training for all federal
personnel who come in contact with victims of human trafficking.
8.
The
Human Trafficking Detection
Act would require training federal employees on how to effectively detect,
deter, disrupt, and prevent human trafficking.
9.
The
Enhancing Services for Runaway and Homeless Victims for
Youth Trafficking Act would allow federal agencies to use street
outreach programs to identify and help homeless youth and bring them in
off the streets.
10.
The
Trafficking Awareness Training for
Health Care Act
would facilitate educating and equipping
healthcare professionals to recognize signs of human trafficking.
11.
The
To Improve The Response To Victims Of Child Sex Trafficking
Act
would modify the language used by the National Center for Missing
and Exploited Childrens to include
child sex
trafficking
to ensure that children who were previously reported as child
prostitutes are treated as victims and not criminals.
12.
The
Strengthening Child Welfare Response to Trafficking
Act
would ensure that every state has appropriately trained welfare workers to
identify victims.
Human trafficking is an immoral,
reprehensible, and downright criminal act that we must work to end. By
providing resources to combat human trafficking and help the victims
of these vile acts, we can help diminish and eliminate this cruel
practice. These bills are an important first step toward ending human
trafficking, but much work remains in our efforts to ensure that all human
lives are treated with
dignity.
Sincerely,
Ileana
