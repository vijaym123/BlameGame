 to inform me that he will be resigning.
I have been close to the Attorney General ever since I recommended him to President Bill Clinton to be the first African American United States Attorney for the District of Columbia.
As hard as it is to see him go, we have to understand that he would want to return to his private life after being one of the countrys longest-serving Attorneys General.
He leaves behind a long list of accomplishments, among them holding Wall Street accountable for the Great Recession, addressing the harshness of federal mandatory minimum sentencing for low level drug offenders, and finding ways to continue to enforce voting rights after a crippling Supreme Court decision.
The day after he announced his resignation, Holder told
the Congressional Black Caucus Foundations Annual Leadership Conference that It is long past time for every citizen to be afforded his or her full responsibilities and full rights.
This was in keeping with his long-held public view on D.C. voting rights and in keeping with his work at the Department of Justice that helped our congressional effort on the D.C. House Voting Rights Act to give D.C. residents the same vote that other tax-paying American citizens have.
Ensuring the White House is Not Off Limits to the Public
Last week, following security breaches at the White House, U.S. Secret Service Director Julia Pierson called me after I wrote her requesting
a meeting.
I told her that I strongly object to jumping to conclusions, such as check points in front of the White House, without a thorough investigation into what went wrong.
Access to the perimeter around the White House and Lafayette Park area is a First Amendment area, and an area that tourists flock to.
The Secret Service has the necessary expertise to protect the President without making the White House a fortress.
I hope that a hastily-called, rare hearing when Congress is in recess is a problem solving exercise, not a show hearing for the upcoming elections.
Members of Congress know well that the Secret Service say very little about problems in protecting the President.
I am a senior member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee and will participate in the hearing in Room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, at 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday, September 30.
It can be live-streamed here .
No More NFL Tax Payer Subsidies Until a Name Change
On Tuesday, I announced
that, once Congress reconvenes, I will introduce legislation to strip the National Football League (NFL) of its tax exempt status as long as it continues to promote for profit a racial slur, as found by an extensive decision of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) has introduced the Senate version.
Why should taxpayer dollars here and across the nation continue to subsidize a mega-rich organization that promotes a racial slur?
Protecting Federal Workers in the Capitol Building
Last Wednesday, I sent a letter
to the Architect of the Capitol after my staff met with Capitol Visitor Center workers, who told them about potential federal labor violations and even violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
My letter asked for a comprehensive review of working conditions.
Defending the Citys New Gun Law
Last Tuesday, after the Council responded to a court ruling striking down the Districts ban on carrying a handgun outside of the home by approv ing legislation allowing
it under narrow circumstances, I warned Congress that if they interfere with this local law, they are in for a fight.
Forums Held on Statehood and Scarce Black Male Teachers
On Thursday, I held two important forums at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundations Annual Leadership Conference, one on next steps
following the unprecedented momentum generated by the first-ever D.C. statehood hearing in the Senate, and another on the positive impact
of more black male teachers in the classroom.
Among the speakers at the statehood forum were some new leaders that have also been working for statehood.
I thank Darrel Thompson, Former Deputy Chief of Staff for Intergovernmental and External Affairs for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid; Josh Burch, Founder of Neighbors United for DC Statehood; Robert Schlesinger, Managing Editor for U.S. News & World Report; and Tim Hampton, Cofounder, Let Us Vote DC for their participation.
