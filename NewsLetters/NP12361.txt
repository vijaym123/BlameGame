D e ar Friends,
Winter Storm Pax is slated to hit the
New York metropolitan area late Wednesday night.
Although
weather projections can change, I encourage you to take precautions
and remain alert as this storm approaches.
Please avoid
traveling by car if you can do so. Should you need to drive during the
storm, please use additional caution as the roads may be
slick.
I have every confidence that the people of the 16th District
