Friends,
I wanted you to see to two recent pieces regarding Mike's work that have enormously positive impacts on Kansas jobs and Kansas families.
Aviation is Good For Kansas Families
This week, the Wichita Eagle recognized that Mike's Small Aircraft Revitalization Act will have a major impact on our airplane builders and all who rely upon them for their jobs:

Mike worked with the Federal Aviation Administration, hard-working Kansas union workers, and our great aviation companies, as well as many others, to craft this important legislation.
We expect the President to sign this bill into law in the next 10 days.
Great news for South-Central Kansas.
Energy Infrastructure Creates Jobs
We all depend on affordable energy--to heat and cool our homes and also to provide energy for making things that let businesses hire more Kansans.
This past week, H.R. 1900, Mike's bill that allows the construction of more pipelines that transport natural gas, passed the House of Representatives and is now headed for the Senate.
Mike's pipeline bill will create more jobs. Click here to read more!
We have to create opportunity for all, and Mike's work on these two important bills will make life better for many, many Kansans.
On behalf of Mike and our entire team that serves the Fourth District of Kansas, have a blessed Thanksgiving.
Sincerely,
Toni Porter
District Director
Office of Congressman Mike Pompeo
