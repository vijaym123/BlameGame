Dear Friends,
I joined officials from the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, the Kanawha County Commission and West
Virginia American Water on Wednesday to sign an agreement for a new water
project in Alum Creek.
I helped secure $250,000 in funding for
this project through the Central West Virginia Environmental
Infrastructure Fund, section 571 of the Water Resources Development Act. The
Olcott-Alum Creek project will expand access to municipal drinking
water to 204 residents.
Expanding the access to municipal
drinking water will improve the quality of life for residents in Olcott and
Alum Creek. The Army Corps of Engineers has the experience needed to
ensure this project will succeed, and I am proud to have helped secure
the funding needed to see this project come to
fruition.
The signing ceremony was held in the Kanawha County Commission Chamber
at the Kanawha County Courthouse, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
Colonel Leon Parrott and Kanawha County Commissioner Hoppy Shores are
pictured above signing the agreement.
CRACKING DOWN ON DRUG
TRAFFICKING
Federal assistance is on the way to two West
Virginia counties to help local law enforcement address drug trafficking.
On Monday, the Office of National Drug Control Policy announced that
Berkeley and Harrison counties will be designated as High Intensity
Drug Trafficking Areas.
This designations will allow officials
in Berkeley and Harrison counties to access federal resources to
address drug trafficking, as well as helping to coordinate efforts among
local, state and federal law enforcement officials.
I
requested this designation in a May letter to Michael Botticelli, acting
director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. Berkeley and
Harrison counties proximity to three major interstates
70, 79 and 81
makes this designation critical in addressing the drug
trade.
With the significant role that out-of-state drug traffickers play
in fueling West Virginias drug problem, it is critical that law
enforcement fight back with a regional approach.Our local officials need
access to state and federal resources to help address the drug trade and
safeguard our communities.
I thank Acting Director
Botticelli and the Office of National Drug Control Policy for recognizing this
need and providing additional resources to help fight drug
trafficking in Berkeley and Harrison counties.
COAST
GUARD DEDICATION
On Monday, I participated in the dedication of the new
U.S. Coast Guard Operation Systems Center in Kearneysville.
I
was joined by Senator Joe Manchin, U.S. Coast Guard Deputy Assistant
Commander Thomas P. Michelli and dignitaries from Jefferson County in
celebrating the facilitys opening.
The Coast Guard already
has a strong presence in Jefferson County, and this facility will
further cement the partnership between West Virginia and the Coast Guard.
Projects like this show employers considering relocating or expanding
to West Virginia that our counties and our state are tremendous
partners for future investments, both public and private.
