Dear Friends,
This week, Senate Republicans shot down an amendment put forth by Sen. Elizabeth Warren aimed at reducing interest rates on student loans. With nearly 40 million borrowers in the United States carrying almost $1.2 trillion in debt, it&rsquo;s crucial Congress realizes we can&rsquo;t keep pushing this issue aside. Students across Connecticut and the country continue to speak out against the rising cost of a college education (pictured below).
I&rsquo;m proud to be a co-sponsor of similar legislation in the House, introduced by Rep. Joe Courtney. We must continue the fight for much needed reforms to student loan policies. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ll continue to host Student Forums on College Affordability across the First District. Please join me for our
next event :
Student Forum on College Affordability
Monday, March 30th, 5PM-6PM
Manchester Community College
330 Great Path Academy, Community Commons Room

Map it!
Change doesn&rsquo;t begin in Washington. It begins when we make our voices heard in our schools and communities
Those who attend are invited to share their thoughts and questions about the rising price of a college education. Refreshments will be provided. Please RSVP online above or by calling my office at 860-278-8888. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this crucial issue.
Sincerely,
