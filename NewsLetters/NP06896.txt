President Obama is right:
That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re going door-to-door (and inbox-to inbox) to reach Michelle Obama&rsquo;s goal: 1 million
commitments to vote in 2014.
So far, we&rsquo;re up to
183,457
commitments to vote! But if we&rsquo;re going to get to the
1 million
mark, we have more work to do.
