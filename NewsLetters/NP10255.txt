Every year, I am honored to nominate aspiring young people who desire to serve our country in the Military Service Academies. This year, nine of the students that I nominated were accepted, including three into the US Naval Academy, three in the US Air Force Academy, two into West Point, and one in the US Merchant Marine Academy. As they prepare to begin their training, I hosted a luncheon in recognition of their achievement, and thanked them for their willingness and desire to serve our country.

On Thursday, I had the privilege of welcoming 56 new Americans as they swore an oath of citizenship to the greatest country on earth. There were many tears as these individuals renounced all fidelity to their former countries and pledged allegiance to the United States of America, swearing the oath to support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America. It was an honor to welcome them as they join the heritage of America and the rights and privileges of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

Last year, Matt McClean traveled up to Washington to meet with me on issues regarding citrus greening and problems affecting the agriculture industry. On Wednesday, I went to Uncle Matts Organic headquarters, where I met additional employees and members of the family, who are fourth generation Florida citrus growers in Central Florida. The McCleans took me on a tour of their orange and peach groves in Clermont to show me firsthand the challenges and successes they are experiencing with organic agriculture.

SunRail will begin operations while I am in Washington next week, so I took a preview of the Lynx Central Station in Orlando to tour the construction site and receive an update and briefing on the commuter operations. When I was in the Florida legislature, I worked hard to support and provide funding SunRail, and over two decades later, it is good to see the project launching in Central Florida. SunRail will provide an alternative to commuting on Interstate 4, and is estimated to generate $8.8 billion in economic impact to our Central Florida region.

As I spent the week in the district, I visited several other businesses and organizations, including:
-	Florida Community Loan Fund
-	Leesburg Noon Rotary
-	Groveland Fire Department
-	Green Light Fire Bag in Montverde
-	Coalition for the Homeless of Central Florida
For more pictures and information on these and additional visits that I made in the district this week, you can follow me on Twitter @RepWebster or go to my Facebook page, Representative Daniel Webster.
Constituent Story
Recently, a constituent from Orlando contacted my office and requested that his application for a replacement Naturalization Certificate be expedited.
His company had requested that he provide it within 30 days or else his employment would be terminated.
My office submitted the expedite request and after USCIS reviewed the file they requested current forms of identification to finish the process. When we provided a scanned copy of his passport, the file was adjudicated and the constituent received his replacement certificate.
Legislative Update
This week, President Obama once again punted on making a decision until likely after the election in November regarding the Keystone XL Pipeline. During this indefinite review process, which has now lasted nearly 4 years and spanned 10 federal agencies and departments, the Administration has continued to brush aside the outreach of our Canadian allies who support the project, and stunted the growth, jobs and security that comes with construction of the pipeline.
While the Washington Post even called the Administrations indecision irresponsible and embarrassing
, some stakeholders that traditionally support this Administration went even further
with accusations that this decision was a political one.
With the escalating unrest in Russia and other areas around the world, it is increasingly important to safeguard our access to energy production and reduce our reliance on foreign energy exporters who do not share our values. I have joined a bipartisan group of my colleagues in the House in passing multiple bills and amendments
aimed at getting this job producing project started. It is my hope that the Senate will either quit stalling these important measures, or the President will reverse course and finally embrace the potential Keystone offers for our economy and energy security.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster

Dear Friend,
Each spring, I sponsor a local high school art competition as part of a nationwide program designed to recognize and encourage young artistic talent. Last Monday, I hosted a teacher viewing and judges reception, then visited high schools to personally congratulate the winners.
The grand prize was awarded to Victor Fan from Dr. Phillips High School, and first runner up went to Josiah Bender from Lake Minneola High School. Individual county winners included Jean Bezerra, Lea Warren, and Analiese Majetich for Orange County; and Annabelle Pullen, Vy Mai, and Yazmina Williams for Lake County. I also congratulated winners from Tavares High School, Boone High School, and Olympia High School.
My theme for the 2014 Congressional Art Competition was The Natural Beauty of America, based on the patriotic song, America the Beautiful. Photos of each entry and the art contest winner presentations can be viewed on
my website ,

Constituent Corner:
Recently, a constituent from Orlando contacted my office and requested that his application for a replacement Naturalization Certificate be expedited.

My office submitted an expedited request and after USCIS reviewed the file they requested current forms of identification to finish the process. After we provided a scanned copy of his passport, the file was adjudicated and the constituent received his replacement certificate.
Constituent Services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
With the continued volatility of world affairs, recent advancements of new natural gas technologies opening the door for a domestic energy boom, and rising energy costs causing American families and businesses to reach deeper into their wallets and pocketbooks, how important is it for the federal government to help move the United States toward energy independence?
Very important
Somewhat important
Not very important
