Thanksgiving Day Message | NOVEMBER 27, 2013
Fellow Alaskans,
As we begin to gather around the dinner table with friends and family this Thanksgiving, Im reminded of the many things to be thankful for this year. I am eternally grateful for the servicemen and women who serve to protect the freedoms we hold near and dear to our hearts in our great nation. These men and women, who are often far and away from loved ones during the holidays, serve for a cause much greater than their own. To the people of Alaska, I continue to appreciate the opportunity and support to serve the 49 th
state in Congress over these last 40 years. Im thankful to God, for blessing me with good health and the love of family; my two daughters, sons-in-law and 14 grandchildren.
As you join together in good company this holiday season, I hope you may also reflect on the many things that bring you and your family happiness and joy this year. I wish you a very warm beginning to your holiday season.
Don Young
Congressman For All Alaska
