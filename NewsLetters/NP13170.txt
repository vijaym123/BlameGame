Dear Friend,
Thank you very much for signing up for our eNewsletter. I appreciate
the opportunity to serve as your Representative. I wanted to give you
this update on our activities in the Second District and Washington,
D.C.
It was great to visit Northeastern Oklahoma A&M; College in Miami with
my family this week. Thanks to NEO President Hale and Wrestling Coach
Renfro for the warm welcome.

New Year
At the beginning of each new year, we have the opportunity look back at
what we've accomplished, and look ahead by setting goals for a lot of
great opportunities. My first year in office serving as your
Representative has been an honor and I have worked tirelessly since day
one to best represent my constituents. It is an honor, but it's also a
sacrifice. The minute I start enjoying my time here, that's the minute
I need to go home. As constituents of the Second District, you gave me
the responsibility to represent you and your values, and I take that to
heart every day.
As the only Oklahoman on the House Transportation and Infrastructure
Committee, last year I was part of drafting the Water Resources Reform
& Development Act (WRRDA) that will protect over $5 billion in
investments and the over 8,000 high quality jobs between the ports of
Muskogee and Catoosa. I have also been named to the Conference
Committee reconciling the House and Senate versions of this critical
legislation for all of eastern Oklahoma.
The Second District of Oklahoma has one of the largest inland water
ports in the nation at the Tulsa Port of Catoosa. Combined with the
Port of Muskogee and the entire McClellan-Kerr Arkansas Navigation
System, Oklahoma businesses are able to use the waterway to compete in
the world marketplace. This legislation is crucial to our state and
nation and I look forward to what we will accomplish in Conference
Committee.
In December, the President signed into law H.R. 2319, my bill that
creates a Native American Veterans Memorial at no cost to the taxpayer.
As one of only two Native Americans in Congress, it was a privilege to
sponsor this legislation. These brave soldiers, including my own
grandfather Kenneth Morris, sacrificed much for the country they love,
and it is important that we properly honor these brave soldiers and
tell their story for generations to come.
Over the past year, I have cast a number of votes to help put this
nation back on responsible fiscal footing. The federal government
cannot continue to spend money it does not have only to pass along a
legacy of debt and higher taxes to future generations. I also
co-sponsored legislation to help improve the management of federal
forests and provide a steady stream of revenue for the Secure Rural
Schools program in counties containing National Forest land.
For work to be completed in Washington we have to work together. We all
must have that sense of responsibility to do what is right not for
party, but for country. Our primary focus should be getting the country
back on stable ground and keeping the country's best interest in mind.
I look forward to the great work we will accomplish in 2014.
Health Exchange Security and Transparency Act of 2014
This week I voted in support of H.R. 3811, the Health Exchange Security
and Transparency Act of 2014, as the House worked to create protections
for Americans at risk of data compromise within the health care
exchanges. The House passed the measure with a vote of 291-122.
Obamacare has been flawed since the beginning. So it should be no
surprise that we had to act today in order to help counter the failures
of this Administration.
H.R. 3811 will require individuals to be notified by the Department of
Health and Human Services if a federal or state exchange's security
system has been breached and their personal information has been
illegally accessed or stolen. These notifications must come within two
business days of the breach.
Security and infrastructure concerns for Healthcare.gov existed before
its launch on October 1, and those concerns continue to grow as the
rollout continues to struggle.
The Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services
reported on August 2, 2013 that "several critical tasks remain to be
completed in a short period of time, such as the final independent
testing of the Hub's security controls, remediating security
vulnerabilities identified during testing, and obtaining the security
authorization decision for the Hub before opening the exchanges."
If Americans are going to be subjected to this health care mandate, we
must do our best to make sure they are protected. Today's step does not
come near to fixing the failure that is Obamacare, but we have made a
move that will provide transparency and keep individuals informed on
the critical issue of their identity and medical information.
We had Latimer County Commissioner Roy Alford stop by our Washington,
D.C. office this week, along with the Executive Director of the
Association of County Commissioners of Oklahoma Gayle Ward and OCCEDB
Executive Director Randy Robinson.
Mobile Offices
In 2014, Oklahoma's Second Congressional District will see the
introduction of mobile offices by our district team. We have re-tooled
the mission of our capable team so they will get out more into each
county in our district.
Through multiple rounds of town hall meetings, we found people are very
engaged in what is happening with their government, and that is great.
People need to stay engaged. So it makes sense for our office to shift
away from the traditional office environment and set up mobile office
locations closer to where people live and work. This way, people in
rural areas won't have to drive across multiple counties to meet with
one of our field representatives or caseworkers.
The Second District encompasses 26 counties in eastern Oklahoma that
stretch to the west from Okfuskee and Hughes counties to the state's
eastern border with Arkansas and from the borders with Kansas and
Missouri to the border with Texas.
Each field representative will hold monthly mobile office hours in
different counties of their field area. Caseworkers will also hold
mobile office hours for anyone needing assistance with a federal
agency. Mobile office hours and locations will soon be released and
will be available on the website, www.mullin.house.gov
.

Dear
Friend,
Thank
you
very
much
for
signing
up
for
our
eNewsletter.
I
appreciate
the
opportunity to
serve
as
your
Representative.
I
wanted
to
give
you
this
update
on
our
activities
in
the
Second
District
and
Washington,
D.C.
It
was
great
to
visit
Northeastern
Oklahoma
A&amp;M
College
in
Miami
with
my
family
this
week.
Thanks
to
NEO

New
Ye a r
At
the
beginning
of
each
new
year,
we
have
the
opportunity
look
back
at
what we've
accomplished,
and
look
ahead
by
setting
goals
for
a
lot
of
great
opportunities.
My
first
year
in
office
serving
as
your
Representative
has
been
an
honor
and
I have
worked
tirelessly
since
day
one
to
best
represent
my
constituents.
It
is
an
honor,
but
it&#8217;s
also
a
sacrifice.
The
minute
I
start
enjoying
my
time
here,
that&#8217;s
the
minute
I
need
to
go
home.
As
constituents
of
the
Second
District,
you
gave
me
the
responsibility
to
represent
you
and
your
values,
and
I
take
that
to
heart
every
day.
As
the
only
Oklahoman
on
the
House
Transpor&shy;tation
and
Infrastructure
Committee,
last
year
I
was
part
of
drafting
the
Water
Re&shy;sources
Reform
&amp;
Devel&shy;opment
Act
(WRRDA)
that
will
protect
over
$5
billion
in
invest&shy;ments
and
the
over
8,000
high
quality
jobs
between
the
ports
of
Muskogee
and
Catoosa.
I
have
also
been
named
to
the
Conference
Committee
reconcil&shy;ing
the
House
and
Senate
versions
of
this
critical
legislation
for
all
of
eastern
Oklahoma.
The
Second
District
of
Oklahoma
has
one
of
the
largest
inland
water
ports
in
the
nation
at
the
Tulsa
Port
of
Catoosa.
Combined
with
the
Port
of
Muskogee
and
the
entire
McClellan-Kerr
Arkansas
Navigation
System,
Okla&shy;homa
businesses
are
able
to
use
the
waterway
to
compete
in
the
world
mar&shy;ketplace.
This
legislation
is
crucial
to
our
state
and
nation
and
I
look
forward
to
what
we
will
accomplish
in
Conference
Committee.
In
December,
the
President
signed
into
law
H.R.
2319,
my
bill
that
creates
a
Native
American
Veterans
Memorial
at
no
cost
to
the
taxpayer.
As
one
of
only
two
Native
Americans
in
Congress,
it
was
a
privilege
to
sponsor
this
legislation.
These
brave
soldiers,
including
my
own
grandfather
Kenneth
Morris,
sacrificed
much
for
the
country
they
love,
and
it
is
important
that
we
properly
honor
these
brave
soldiers
and
tell
their
story
for
generations
to
come.
Over
the
past
year,
I
have
cast
a
num&shy;ber
of
votes
to
help
put
this
nation
back
on
responsible
fiscal
footing.
The
fed&shy;eral
government
cannot
continue
to
spend
money
it
does
not
have
only
to
pass
along
a
legacy
of
debt
and
higher
taxes
to
fu&shy;ture
generations.
I
also
co-sponsored
legislation
to
help
improve
the
management
of
fed&shy;eral
forests
and
provide
a
steady
stream
of
revenue
for
the
Secure
Rural
Schools
program
in
counties
containing
National
Forest
land.
For
work
to
be
completed
in
Washington
we
have
to
work
together.
We
all
must
have
that
sense
of
responsibility
to
do
what
is
right
not
for
party,
but
for
country. Our
primary
focus
should
be
getting
the
country
back
on
stable
ground
and
keeping
the
country&#8217;s
best
interest
in
min d .
I
look
forward
to
the
great
work
we
will
accomplish
in
2014.
Health
Exchange
Security
and
Transparency
Act
of
20 1 4
This
week I
voted
in
support
of
H.R.
3811,
the
Health
Exchange
Security
and
Transparency
Act
of
2014,
as
the
House
worked
to
create
protections
for
Americans
at
risk
of
data
compromise
within
the
health
care
exchanges.
The
House
passed
the
measure
with
a
vote of
291-122.
Obamacare
has
been
flawed
since
the
beginning.
So
it
should
be
no
surprise
that
we
had
to
act
today
in
order
to
help
counter
the
failures
of
this
Administration.
H.R.
3811
will
require
individuals
to
be
notified
by
the
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
if
a
federal
or
state
exchange&#8217;s
security
system
has
been
breached
and
their
personal
information
has
been
illegally
accessed
or
stolen.
These
notifications
must
come
within
two
business
days
of
the
breach.
Security
and
infrastructure
concerns
for
Healthcare.gov
existed
before
its
launch
on
October
1,
and
those
concerns
continue
to
grow
as
the
rollout
continues
to
struggle.
The
Inspector
General
of
the
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
reported
on
August
2,
2013
that
&#8220;several
critical
tasks
remain
to
be
completed
in
a
short
period
of
time,
such
as
the
final
independent
testing
of
the
Hub&#8217;s
security
controls,
remediating
security
vulnerabilities
identified
during
testing,
and
obtaining
the
security
authorization
decision
for
the
Hub
before
opening
the
exchanges."
If
Americans
are
going
to
be
subjected
to
this
health
care
mandate,
we
must
do
our
best
to
make
sure
they
are
protected.
Today&#8217;s
step
does
not
come
near
to
fixing
the
failure
that
is
Obamacare,
but
we
have
made
a
move
that
will
provide
transparency
and
keep
individuals
informed
on
the
critical
issue
of
their
identity
and
medical
information .
We
had
Latimer
County
Commissioner
Roy
Alford
stop
by
our
Washington,
D.C.
office
this
week,
along
with
the
Executive
Director
of
the
Association
of
County
Commissioners
of
Oklahoma
Gayle
Ward
and OCCEDB
Executive
Director Randy
Robinson.
Mobile
Off ic es In
2014, Oklahoma's Second
Congressional
District will
see
the
introduction
of mobile
offices by
our
district
team. We
have
re-tooled
the
mission
of
our
capable
team
so
they
will
get
out
more
into
each
county
in
our
district.
Through
multiple
rounds
of
town
hall
meetings,
we
found
people
are
very
engaged
in
what
is
happening
with
their
government,
and
that
is
great.
People
need
to
stay
engaged.
So
it
makes
sense
for
our
office
to
shift
away
from
the
traditional
office
environment
and
set
up
mobile
office
locations
closer
to
where
people
live
and
work.
This
way,
people
in
rural
areas
won&#8217;t
have
to
drive
across
multiple
counties
to
meet
with
one
of
our
field
representatives
or
caseworkers.
The
Second
District
encompasses
26
counties
in
eastern
Oklahoma
that
stretch
to
the
west
from
Okfuskee
and
Hughes
counties
to
the
state&#8217;s
eastern
border
with
Arkansas
and
from
the
borders
with
Kansas
and
Missouri
to
the
border
with
Texas.
Each
field
representative
will
hold
monthly
mobile
office
hours
in
different
counties
of
their
field
area.
Caseworkers
will
also
hold
mobile
office
hours
for
anyone
needing
assistance
with
a
federal
agency.
Mobile
office
hours
and
locations
will
soon
be
released
and
will
be
available
on
the
website,
www.mullin.house.gov .
