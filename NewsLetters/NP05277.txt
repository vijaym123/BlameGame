We&rsquo;re nearly out of time -- so we won't waste any:
Two new polls show the race for Congress in a DEAD HEAT. And now Boehner&rsquo;s allies have launched the largest TV ad buy of the election ($2O,OOO,OOO!!!) to try and break the tie.
To be blunt about it: our ad buy deadline is in 2 hours. If we can&rsquo;t get to our goal now, we can just throw in the towel. Go home. Give up. UPDATE: A dedicated group of Democratic supporters are TRIPLE-MATCHING all donations until 6pm TONIGHT.
We just ran the numbers: it&rsquo;ll take another 337 donations before 6pm to be able to compete. David -- if you&rsquo;re planning to chip in soon, we could really use your support right now.
