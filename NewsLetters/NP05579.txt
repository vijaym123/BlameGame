Friend -- The latest projection shows Republicans losing by just one seat: Democrats 51 - Republicans 49.
That&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re leading in FIVE Southern states -- enough to STOP McConnell&rsquo;s takeover and DRAMATICALLY shake up the national political landscape.
ABC
News reports,
&ldquo;If Republicans... fall one seat short of controlling the Senate, it will rank among the most crushing failures in recent political history.&rdquo;
But they warn that for the GOP, &ldquo;Senate control is so tantalizingly close.&rdquo;
President Obama just emailed you to say that,
&ldquo;The final fundraising deadline of the election is in 72 hours.
It&rsquo;s not an exaggeration to say that what you do before then could decide the Senate.&rdquo;
Will you step up today?
SINGLE-DAY TRIPLE-MATCH: Pitch in before the FINAL FEC deadline so we can clinch control of the Senate.
