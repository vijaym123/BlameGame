Click the picture above to see Kristi talk about this issue with KSFY
at the Disabled American Veterans Convention in Aberdeen on May 2
I am infuriated by recent reports that veterans have not only
dealt with tremendous backlogs at veterans' hospitals across the
country, but have lost their lives waiting for care.
Today, I helped the U.S. House of Representatives pass new legislation
to better hold Veterans Affairs (VA) employees accountable. One of the
big problems we've seen is that bureaucratic red tape gets in the way
of firing senior VA officials who are no longer serving our veterans.
With the Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act
, we're cutting through that red tape so the VA Secretary has
more authority to fire those in the agency who are failing our
veterans.
In April, the House also passed a funding bill that sets aside more
money to address the backlog issue for our veterans and I'm glad that
there is an investigation set up to dig further into the issue. We've
already seen staff changes as a result of public pressure, including
the resignation of Robert Petzel, the VA's undersecretary for health. I
will not stop until everyone involved is held accountable and our
veterans get the care they deserve in a timely fashion.
Before I let you go, I wanted you to know that if you or a loved one
ever has problems with the VA or any federal agency, I have put a team
in place to help you. Just visit my website
or my nearest
office
.
Sincerely,
Kristi

about
this
issue
with
KSFY
at
the
Disabled
American
Veterans
Convention
in
Aberdeen
on
May

I
am
infuriated
by
recent
reports
that
veterans
have
not
only
dealt
with
tremendous
backlogs
at
veterans'
hospitals
across
the

Today,
I
helped
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives
pass
new
legislation
to
better
hold
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
employees
accountable.
One
of
the
big
problems we've
seen is
that
bureaucratic
red
tape
gets
in
the
way
of
firing
senior
VA
officials
who
are
no
longer

our
veterans.
With
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
Management
Accountability
Act ,
we&#8217;re
cutting
through
that
red
tape
so
the
VA
Secretary
has
more
authority
to
fire
those
in
the
agency
who
are
failing
our
veterans.
In
April,
the
House
also
passed
a

bill
that
sets
aside more
money
to
address
the

issue
for

I&#8217;m
glad
that
there
is
an

set
up
to
dig
further into
the
issue. We&#8217;ve

staff
changes
as
a

of
public
pressure,
including
the
resignation
of
Robert
Petzel, the

will
not
stop
until
everyone
involved
is
held
accountable
and
our
veterans
get
the
care
they
deserve
in
a
timely
fashion.
Before
I
let
you
go,
I
wanted
you
to
know
that
if
you
or
a

one
ever

with

I
