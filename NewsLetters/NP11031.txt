Update from Senator Bob Corker

2014
Ukraine Bill Sends Strong Message
Following
Senate passage, by a 98 to 2 vote, of the Ukraine bill that he
co-authored, Senator Corker, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, said the legislation sends a strong message of support to
the Ukrainian people and a strong signal to Russia by imposing tough
sanctions on the Putin regime for its illegal actions in
Crimea.
This bill sends a strong message of support to the Ukrainian
people and a strong signal to Russia that there will be severe costs for
Putins illegal actions in Crimea and for any further intervention in
Ukraine, said Corker. Going forward, the administration must
demonstrate a long-term commitment to stop Russian aggression and a
willingness to drive shock waves into the Russian economy to make the
consequences clear to Putin should he continue on his current
course.

In
advance of Thursdays vote, Senator Corker said the U.S. should begin
to implement sanctions against Russian banks to turn up the volume on
the Putin regime.
[Y]ou dont want to throw the kitchen
sink on the front end and not have anything left, otherwise Putin has
nothing to lose. On the other hand, I do think that our response has
been timid. And I would like to see some greater sectorial
responsesThere are three, four banks [in Russia], if we were to sanction them,
would send incredible shock waves through their economy, said Corker.
I think [Putins] calculating, again, is he going to pay a big price
if he goes in or not?... I'm afraid that were sounding and acting
slightly timid right now. We need to turn the volume
up.
Senator Corker also responded to recent polling indicating 57 percent of
Americans oppose the presidents handling of the crisis in
Ukraine.
I think what overall Americans are seeing in these
numbers is that the administration has created an air of permissiveness all
around the world, an air of weaknessand I think Americans are
responding to that, said Corker.
Housing Finance Reform Markup
Scheduled
Senator Corker issued the following statement Friday after
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson (D-S.D.) and Ranking Member
Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) announced the committee will markup the
Housing Finance Reform and Taxpayer Protection Act
(S.1217) , a bipartisan bill written last year by Corker and Senator Mark
Warner (D-Va.) and cosponsored by a bipartisan group of 10 senators, on
Tuesday, April 29, 2014 at 10:00 A.M.
After a dozen
hearings on housing finance reform and S.1217, the committee is well
prepared to act, and I look forward to a successful markup at the end of
April. It's time for Congress to move forward on modernizing our housing
finance system to protect the American taxpayer from any more
bailouts. I appreciate Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Crapo's strong
commitment to this important issue, said Corker.
In June
2013, Corker and Warner
introduced
S.1217 to
strengthen Americas housing finance system by replacing
government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with a privately
capitalized system that preserves market liquidity and protects taxpayers
from future economic downturns.
In 2008, Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac were taken into government conservatorship and given a $188
billion capital injection from taxpayers to stay afloat. As a result
of this bailout, the private market has almost completely disappeared,
and so nearly every loan made in America today comes with a full
government guarantee. Despite this unsustainable situation, there still has
been no real reform to our housing finance system since the financial
crisis.
