Featured Funding Opportunities and Grant
Assistance:
FEMA offers three
Hazard
Mitigation Assistance (HMA)
grant programs
the Hazard
Mitigation Grant Program (HGMP), the Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM)
program and the Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) program
to help states,
territories, tribal governments, local communities, private
non-profits and businesses implement cost-effective, long-term mitigation
measures for all natural hazards. As part of this effort, FEMA has produced
this digest of HMA program operational terms and references. The
HMA Program Digest
is intended to be an easy-to-read,
easy-to use, brief summary of the basic HMA program elements. While
the HMA Program Digest is primarily intended for those unfamiliar with
the HMA programs, it also may serve as a reference for employees,
applicants, and other stakeholders with many years of experience with the
programs. Because the digest is not exhaustive, either in topics or in
detail, information should be verified with the FEMA HMA Unified
Program Guidance and FEMA HMA program officials before becoming the basis
for decision making.
National
Endowment for the Humanities Grant Workshop: Friday, September
19, 2014, 8:30 a.m. - 1:30 p.m. at Siena College. Dr. Russell Wyland,
Deputy Director of NEH Research Program will discuss NEH funding
opportunities and offer tips for writing competitive proposals.
