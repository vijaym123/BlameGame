December 19, 2014
Dear Friends,
The Senate adjourned on Tuesday, ending the 113th Congress. The 114th
Congress will convene at noon on Tuesday, January 6, 2015.
Prior to the adjournment, the Senate voted on a number of pending
nominations, as well as a bill to retroactively extend a number of tax
deductions.
As we move into 2015 with a Republican majority, I will work with
Republican leadership to advance comprehensive changes to our tax
system that are long overdue.
I look forward to continuing my work on the Senate Committee on Finance
in the 115th Congress, and I welcome your suggestions on how to
simplify, make fairer and lower the current tax burden borne by
taxpayers. Together, we can make a difference to craft a tax code for
the 21st century.
Government Funding and Amnesty
On December 13, 2014, the Senate passed H.R.83, the appropriations
legislation to fund the government for nine months that was previously
passed by the U.S. House on December 11, 2014.
Unfortunately, there has been a great deal of confusion regarding this
legislation and its impact on immigration funding and policy, as well
as on Obamacare. While this is not the bill I would have written, I
supported it because it included several key victories for conservative
principles and for the state of Georgia, while also setting up the
opportunity for the new Republican majority in the Senate to make more
progress next year.
First, the appropriations bill does not authorize the Obama
administration to spend a single dime on the president's new
immigration initiatives. I share the concern of many Georgians that it
would be a blatant violation of the Constitution's separation of powers
for the president to unilaterally change immigration policy without the
consent of Congress. That is why I voted to support a point of order
raised by U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, R-Texas, declaring President Obama's
plan to halt the deportations of millions of illegal immigrants
unconstitutional. Additionally, the funding bill gives the Department
of Homeland Security, which funds immigration, only enough funding to
operate until February 2015. This will allow Congress to revisit the
agency's budget in February and begin the process of de-funding and
dismantling the amnesty plan. I am committed to working with the new
Republican majority in the Senate next year to block the president's
unconstitutional power play.
As for Obamacare, the legislation prevented additional funding from
reaching the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to pay for
Obamacare, and it cut almost $350 million from the Internal Revenue
Service, the administration's primary tool for enforcing Obamacare. It
also prohibits taxpayer funds from being used to bail out insurance
companies that lose money on Obamacare, a key step toward reversing the
administration's efforts to hide the true cost of this law from the
American people. I continue to fight to repeal and replace this
terribly flawed law through legislation, funding cuts and through the
courts.
Georgia's priorities were at the forefront of my mind when making my
decision to support this legislation. First, the bill included funding
to ensure the federal share of funding for Georgia's number one
economic development project -- the expansion and deepening of the Port
of Savannah
. The appropriations bill
included $1.52 million in construction funding that will keep this
project on track.
The bill also included a provision to rein in the Environmental
Protection Agency's (EPA) overreach with respect to the 'waters of the
United States' proposal, which would subject Georgia's farmers to
costly and intrusive federal regulation and would harm Georgia's
biggest industry.
As the 113th Congress draws to a close, Senate Republicans are gearing
up for their new majority in January. Omnibus appropriations bills are
never a good way to do business, and come January 6, 2015, the new
Republican Senate majority will return to doing individual and
transparent appropriations bills throughout the year in a timely
fashion. The American people deserve no less.
Next year, I will continue my fight to reform America's budget and
spending process from an annual to a biennial budget, which would
reserve every other year for mandatory oversight to ensure that we
demand accountability from existing programs before we spend money on
new ones.
Army Retirement Policy Reversal
In November, U.S. Senator Patty Murray, D-Wash., and I led a bipartisan
group of colleagues in sending a letter
to U.S. Army Secretary John McHugh over the Army's
treatment of a significant number of captains and majors who are former
non-commissioned officers and who were being forced to retire at their
highest previous enlisted rank.
We were concerned about the Army's use of Enhanced-Selective Early
Retirement Boards, which would have resulted in a significant decrease
in lifetime retirement benefits for the impacted soldiers -- as much as
$1,000 per month or more for some, or just more than $1 million over a
40-year retirement in the case of a captain forced to retire as a
sergeant first class.
This week, Secretary McHugh announced a reversal of this policy. I am
thrilled Secretary McHugh responded quickly and is taking the steps
necessary to rectify this situation and allow these deserving men and
women to retire at the rank they have earned and appropriately honor
their service to our nation. You can read more about this issue in the
Army Times' article here
.
Cuba
On Wednesday, President Obama announced that the United States had been
in long-time negotiations with Cuba regarding a prisoner exchange and
that he plans to use executive actions to ease economic and travel
restrictions on Cuba and to work with Congress to end the trade embargo.
I am pleased that Alan Gross has been safely reunited with his family
after five years of unjust imprisonment at the hands of the Castro
regime. However, I am deeply troubled to hear that three convicted
Cuban spies were exchanged as a part of this deal. Mr. Gross did not
commit any crimes and should have been released unconditionally.
As for the Obama administration's plans for a major shift in policy
toward Cuba, I look forward to hearing specific details on how the
administration plans to hold Cuba accountable for its well-documented
disregard for the basic rights of its people and the principles of
democracy.
What's on Tap?
The Senate is not in session next week in observance of Christmas or
the following week in observance of New Year's Day. I look forward to
sharing this special time of year with my family and friends. Dianne
and I will be sharing a traditional Christmas Eve dinner with our
children and nine grandchildren. We wish you all a Happy New Year, and
ask you to join us in a prayer for those serving our nation especially
at this time of year.

Johnny Isakson

Government
Funding
and
Amnesty
On
December
13,
2014,
the
Senate
passed
H.R.83,
the
appropriations
legislation
to
fund
the
government
for
nine
months
that
was
previously
passed
by
the
U.S.
House
on
December
11,
2014.
Unfortunately,
there
has
been
a
great

of
confusion
regarding
this
legislation
and
its
impact
on
immigration
funding
and

as
well
as
on
Obamacare.

I

Georgia,

does
not
authorize
the
Obama

of
many
Georgians
that
it
would
be
a
blatant
violation
of
the
Constitution's
separation
of

for
the

policy
without

That
is

I

raised
by
U.S.
Senator
Ted

R-Texas,
declaring
President
Obama's

the
funding

gives
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security,
which
funds
immigration,
only
enough

This

allow

I

Army
Retirement
Policy
Reversal
In
November,
U.S.
Senator
Patty
Murray,
D-Wash.,
and
I
led
a
bipartisan
group
of
colleagues
in
sending
a
letter
to
U.S.
Army
Secretary
John
McHugh
over
the
Army's
treatment
of
a
significant
number
of
captains
and
majors
who
are
former
non-commissioned
officers
and
who
were
being
forced
to
retire
at
their
highest
previous
enlisted
rank.
We
were
concerned
about
the
Army's
use
of
Enhanced-Selective
Early
Retirement
Boards,
which
would
have
resulted
in
a
significant
decrease
in
lifetime
retirement
benefits
for
the
impacted
soldiers
--
as
much
as
$1,000
per
month
or
more
for
some,
or
just
more
than
$1
million
over
a
40-year
retirement
in
the
case
of
a
captain
forced
to
retire
as
a
sergeant
first
class.
This
week,
Secretary
McHugh
announced
a
reversal
of
this
policy.
I
am
thrilled
Secretary
McHugh
responded
quickly
and
is
taking
the
steps
necessary
to
rectify
this
situation
and
allow
these
deserving
men
and
women
to
retire
at
the
rank
they
have
earned
and
appropriately
honor
their
service
to
our
nation.

this
issue

Cuba
On
Wednesday,
President
Obama
announced
that
the
United
States
had
been
in
long-time
negotiations
with
Cuba
regarding
a
prisoner
exchange
and
that
he
plans
to
use
executive
actions
to
ease
economic
and
travel
restrictions
on
Cuba
and
to
work
with
Congress
to
end
the
trade
embargo.
I
am
pleased
that
Alan
Gross
has
been
safely
reunited
with
his
family
after
five
years
of
unjust
imprisonment
at
the
hands
of
the
Castro
regime.
However,
I
am
deeply
troubled
to
hear
that
three
convicted
Cuban
spies
were
exchanged
as
a
part
of
this
deal.
Mr.
Gross
did
not
commit
any
crimes
and
should
have
been
released
unconditionally.
As
for
the
Obama
administration's
plans
for
a
major
shift
in
policy
toward
Cuba,
I
look
forward
to
hearing
specific
details
on
how
the
administration
plans
to
hold
Cuba
accountable
for
its
well-documented
disregard
for
the
basic
rights
of
its
people
and
the
principles
of
democracy.
What's
on
Tap?
The
Senate
is
not
in
session
next
week
in
observance
of
Christmas
or
the
following
week
in
observance
of
New
Year's
Day.
I
look
forward
to
sharing
this
special
time
of

with
my

Dianne
