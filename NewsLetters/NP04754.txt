&ldquo;Romney predicts big Republican year&rdquo; The Hill (11-02-14)
Has Mitt Romney lost his mind?
He&rsquo;s bragging about a big Republican year. Even saying "You're finding Democrats across the country pretty desperate at this stage.&rdquo; But Democrats are surging all across the country! We could even win in deep-red states like Nebraska.
And get this: FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, our top supporters have agreed to 4X-MATCH ALL GIFTS today.
