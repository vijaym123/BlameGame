Congressman Poliquin Votes
Against Fast-Track : On Thursday, the House of
Representatives voted to grant President Obama fast-track authority,
again.
Once again, I
voted against granting the President fast-track trade negotiating
authority.
A s Maines Second District Congressman, I will always
fight to protect our mills, factories and other employers to make sure
they are able to compete on a level playing field. Maine has the most
skilled workers in the Country; put us on a level playing field and we
can compete with anybody.
Poliquin Raises Grave
Concerns Over Inspector General Report on TOGUS : On
Wednesday, he Department of Veterans Affairs Office of the Inspector
General released their report on the VA Maine Healthcare System at Togus
Mismanagement of Mental Health
Consults and Other Access to Care Concerns.
This report, clearly, shows that
Togus has failed to give our veterans the proper healthcare they were
promised, earned and deserve. Our veterans, and their families, answered
the ultimate call of duty to protect this Great Nation and they
deserve better than this.

Repealing ObamaCares Medical Device
Tax : On Thursday, the House of Representatives passed the
Protect Medical Innovation Act, of which Congressman Bruce Poliquin is
an original cosponsor, to repeal ObamaCares penalizing medical
device tax.
Im
proud to have voted in support of repealing ObamaCares penalizing
medical device tax in order to help strengthen medical innovation, help
our businesses grow and create more jobs in Maines Second District
and beyond. I will continue to repeal the parts of ObamaCare that hurt
our seniors, families and businesses.
