Heller Cosponsors Bipartisan
Sportsmen's Act of 2014
Praises House passage
(Washington, D.C.)
U.S. Senator Dean Heller
(R-NV) yesterday announced that he is
cosponsoring the Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act
of 2014. The bill, which was introduced by
Senators Kay Hagan (D-NC) and Lisa
Murkowski (R-AK) yesterday, includes
policies to enhance opportunities for
hunting, fishing, and outdoor recreation.
It would also make it easier for businesses
involved in outdoor recreation to grow and
hire.
The House of Representatives passed
similar legislation this afternoon.
Nevadans have a long history of
hunting, fishing, hiking, boating and other
activities. Outdoor recreation is an
important economic driver in the Silver
State, and this bipartisan legislation
ensures continued opportunities. I
appreciate the efforts of everyone involved
in collaborating on this and look forward
to working with my Senate colleagues in
order to move the bill forward, said
Senator
Dean Heller .
The bill has ten cosponsors: Senators
Mark Begich (AK), John Boozman (AR), Dean
Heller (R-NV), John Hoeven (ND), Mary
Landrieu (LA), Joe Manchin (WV), Rob
Portman (OH), Mark Pryor (AR), Jon Tester
(MT) and David Vitter (LA).
Measures Heller has previously
supported included in the
Sportsmens Act:
Federal Land Transaction
Facilitation Act Reauthorization
(S.368) reauthorizes FLTFA, a program
that enables the Bureau of Land
Management (BLM) to sell public land to
private owners, counties, companies and
others for ranching, community
development and other projects. This
Land for Land approach
creates jobs and generates funding for
Bureau of Land Management (BLM), US
Forest Service (USFS), National Park
Service (NPS) and U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service. (USFWS) to acquire critical
in-holdings from willing sellers. Nevada
has benefited from the FLTFA more than
any other state, with over $88 million in
BLM land sales and $35 million in
Secretarial approvals for conservation
projects since FLTFAs enactment in
2000.
Recreational Fishing and Hunting
Heritage Opportunities Act (S.170)
requires the BLM and the Forest Service
to keep their lands open to hunting,
recreational fishing, and shooting, and
facilitate the use of and access to
federal public lands and waters for these
activities.
Target Practice and Marksmanship
Training Support Act (S.1212) enables
states to allocate a greater proportion
of federal funding to create and maintain
shooting ranges on federal and
non-federal lands. The bill also
encourages federal land agencies to
cooperate with state and local
authorities to maintain shooting
ranges.
