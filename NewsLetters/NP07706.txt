Earlier this month, hostilities between Hamas
a Palestinian militant group
and Israel escalated following the kidnapping and killing of three Israeli teenagers.
Hamas
fired rockets
from the Gaza Strip, a Hamas-controlled territory, toward Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and Israel struck back with a series of
air strikes .
In an effort to end the violence, Egypt proposed
a cease-fire agreement ; however, it failed to gain support from Hamas.
As a result, Israel resumed air strikes to combat the continual firing of rockets.
Last week, the House of Representatives passed a
resolution
by unanimous consent, condemning the attack on Israel and reaffirming support for Israels right to defend its citizens.
Question of the week:
Should the U.S. affirm the right of Israel to defend itself?
( ) Yes.
( ) No.
( ) I dont know.
( ) Other.
