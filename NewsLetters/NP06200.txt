Dear Friend, Imagine it&rsquo;s November 5th.
The election is over, and the results are on the front page of every newspaper and website in the country. What do you want those headlines to say?
If the pollsters and the pundits are right, those headlines will read &ldquo;GOP GAINS CONTROL OF SENATE.&rdquo; But if we work hard every day between now and the election, we can prove them all wrong. Success in November depends on the work we put in now. Give our organizers the resources they need by contributing $5 before the FEC deadline.

Or donate another amount.
If Republicans pick up the six seats they need to take over the Senate, we&rsquo;ll officially have a shutdown Congress. That&rsquo;s what the GOP leadership in the House did, and it&rsquo;s what the GOP leadership in the Senate says it will do if they win.
If Republicans win, we&rsquo;ll be stuck with a Congress that puts the NRA ahead of children and families. We&rsquo;ll be stuck with a Congress that wants to end Medicare as we know it and turn Social Security over to the Wall St. casino. It&rsquo;s up to us to prevent that from happening. Help us keep Massachusetts&rsquo; Senate seat blue by giving $5, $10, or more before the FEC deadline.
Thank you for your hard work. It will make a difference in November -- both in our vote totals and in the next day&rsquo;s headlines.
