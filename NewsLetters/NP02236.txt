Human trafficking is modern-day slavery, plain and
simple.
But we can win the fight against
it.

This week, the Senate is considering the
Justice for Victims of
Trafficking Act , a bipartisan bill
I
introduced
to crack down on this heinous crime.
This
bill:
punishes both "Johns" and
pimps for buying and selling trafficked
victims;
uses fines from
perpetrators to create a 'Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund' to pay for
victims' recovery programs - at zero cost to
taxpayers;
treats trafficked
children as the victims they are -
not as
criminals.
You can read more about it in my
joint op-ed with co-sponsor Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) in
CNN .
