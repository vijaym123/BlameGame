Dear David,
I hope this letter finds you well on this wonderful day of
Thanksgiving.
As we gather together in celebration today, let us be sure to bow our
heads in appreciation for the rich history of our great country and the
freedoms we enjoy.
Let us also take a moment to remember our troops, near and far, and
their families.
They have all sacrificed so much in the name of our
freedom.
We will be forever indebted to them and we are thankful for
their dedication to their duty.
Today, and everyday, I am thankful for my family and friends and the
many blessings God has showered upon us all.
I am also thankful to
have had the opportunity to serve you, both in Congress and in the
United States Army.
Both experiences have filled me with gratitude for
my country, my fellow countrymen, and my fellow Arkansans
Happy Thanksgiving and may God bless you and your families throughout
this holiday season.
Sincerely,
