Dear Friend,
Far too many Hoosiers suffer the financial and emotional strains of unemployment or underemployment. Creating new jobs and protecting existing American jobs is my number one priority in Congress. I am doing everything I can to connect job seekers with companies that are currently hiring. That&rsquo;s why I am hosting my annual Central Indiana Job Fair in cooperation with Ivy Tech Community College again this year.
This event will take place on
Wednesday, August 6th from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Ivy Tech&rsquo;s Corporate College and Culinary Center (2820 N. Meridian Street) . The job fair will provide attendees with an opportunity to speak with a diverse group of companies from various sectors that are looking to hire new employees here in Central Indiana.
For more information about the job fair please click

As always, please feel free to call or email my office if there is anything I can do for you.
Sincerely,
Andr&eacute; Carson

Helping Cut Red Tape
My office is here to help if you or your family needs assistance working with a federal agency.
Recently, we were able to help Scott and Amy of Indianapolis reclaim their educational credit after the IRS sent them a letter stating their educational credit from 2010 was denied.
The letter also indicated the couple&rsquo;s 2013 return was being withheld in order to pay back the credit erroneously claimed.
Amy and Scott have both been in school since 2010 and believed they justly claimed the educational credit.
My office was able to work with IRS to get the proof needed to apply the educational credit.
The IRS has already begun the process of issuing a refund to Amy and Scott.
The couple will receive $3,700 in four to six weeks!
