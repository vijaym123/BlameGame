Dear

Rep. Grijalva shared two important
announcements for
veterans
in February:
Rep.
Grijalva launched a new
Veteran Resouce Guide
to provide valuable information about services and benefits available
to veterans.
He also
announced a new fellowship in
his office through the Wounded Warrior Program. Full details about

Valentines for
Veterans
Rep. Grijalva organized a very successful
Valentines for Veterans
drive, thanks to students from 40 elementary
schools throughout our community who made amazing Valentine's Day
cards for local heroes. Rep. Grijalva's office had the pleasure
of delivering them to the Tucson Veterans Administration hospital,
University of Arizona and Pima College Veterans Centers, and American
Legion Veterans Halls.
One of the more than 4,000 Valentine's Day cards collected by my
staff from students throughout the 3rd Congressional
District.
For the Love of
Reading
Rep. Grijalva participated in
Love of Reading
events at 6
schools around Tucson. He read to more than 240 students, and received warm
birthday wishes from the students of the Ili Uusim Mahtawapo Pascual
Yaqui Head Start program!

What Do You
Think??? The Supreme Court is hearing arguments
right now about whether the people of Arizona are allowed to draw the
boundary lines for Congressional districts. Republicans in the state
legislature want to take that power away, and place it back in the hands
of politicians.
Should districts be drawn by politicians or the people? District lines should be decided by the
people of Arizona to avoid partisan influence. District lines should be decided by political
parties. *By answering this survey, you are subscribing to my newsletter If you are having trouble, click here.
