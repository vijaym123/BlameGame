Dear Friend, The Koch brothers&rsquo; network has committed to raising $290 million for their political activity this year.
That activity includes attacking Democrats like me in Senate races across the country.
That&rsquo;s an enormous amount of money -- so why are successful businessmen like the Koch brothers spending so much?
Because they see it as an investment.
The Koch family fortune comes from fossil fuels. To most of us, better gas mileage means paying less at the pump, but to the Koch brothers, it means smaller profits.
The same goes for the President&rsquo;s proposal to end our long, dirty power plant era by strengthening emissions standards -- good for the American people, bad for the Kochs&rsquo; bottom line. That&rsquo;s why the Kochs announced their latest spending spree --
$290 million in this cycle alone
-- in response to the President&rsquo;s proposal. Here&rsquo;s the good news: you can help make sure that the Kochs have made a losing bet. We&rsquo;re aiming to raise $36,000 before the FEC filing deadline on June 30 -- can you get us $5 closer to that goal?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
And here&rsquo;s the bad news: the Kochs will stop at nothing to buy a Senate that will do their bidding. If their candidates win, we&rsquo;re looking at a Senate that is of Big Oil, by Big Oil, and for Big Oil.
That&rsquo;s an agenda I&rsquo;ll never support. I&rsquo;m going to keep fighting for middle class families and for a future that unleashes a clean energy revolution, and frees us from fossil fuels. The Kochs can follow the money too -- and they can see our grassroots support. Pitch in $5 to send a message that the Kochs&rsquo; billions can&rsquo;t buy your vote.
Thank you.
