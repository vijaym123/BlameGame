Dear Friend,
While fuel prices have
fallen, it is important to note that Middle Eastern oil interests can
drive our US domestic oil producers out of business since costs to
frack and extract will curtail American production.
Keystone can
help keep long term energy costs down and competitive supplies
stable.
WITH
THIS AND THOUSANDS OF JOBS AT STAKE, IT IS TIME FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA TO
SIGN INTO LAW THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE BILL PASSED BY THE U.S. HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES AND NOW THE U.S.
SENATE.
With my regards and best wishes, I
remain
Most respectfully,
John L.
Mica
