David -- I don't like emailing on the weekend, but this is important.
The latest poll shows us in a dead heat against Republican Bob Dold. It's just one more piece of evidence that our race will go down to the wire.
In 2012, we won by only 1 percent. This year, the
Washington Post
called our election one of the top races to watch in the entire country.
I can't win without your help. Will you join me? David Johnson

David, I'm fighting everyday for the priorities you care about most -- from growing our economy and expanding on-the-job training, to protecting women's health care rights and banning workplace discrimination against LGBT employees.
If Illinois's 10th District falls back into Republican hands, all the progress we've made could come to a screeching halt.
Let's keep fighting. http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/Rapid-Response
