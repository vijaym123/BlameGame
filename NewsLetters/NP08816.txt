I had the opportunity to speak with hundreds of 7th District residents
last week at my two in-person town hall meetings in Buford and Cumming
and during my telephone town hall meeting last Tuesday. I want to thank
all of you who were able to visit with me and share your passion for
America.
The last of our June town hall series will be a telephone town hall
meeting on Thursday, June 12th at 7pm
. Please take the opportunity to call in and
join me in a discussion.
Rep. Rob Woodall hears from 7th District residents at the Gwinnett
County Town Hall Meeting in Buford on June 3rd.
Meeting with 7th District Leaders
Visiting with constituents and community leaders is a top priority for
me.
Last Tuesday I had a great conversation with the folks at Gwinnett
Sunrise Rotary and am grateful for their willingness to invest their
time in me.
These men and women understand the importance of being
involved and serving their neighbors.
I shared with them the status on
many issues facing Congress, and in turn they had a lot of questions
about items that are near and dear to them.
Their feedback is a great
help to me.
With that kind of leadership here at home, it makes my job
of working for limited government in Washington and preserving local
control much easier.
Rep. Rob Woodall meets with members of the Gwinnett Sunrise Rotary Club
on June 3rd.
Sergeant Bergdahl Prisoner Exchange
Congress and the American people have been trying to understand and
assess the consequences of President Obama's announcement last week
that the United States had traded five Guantanamo Bay prisoners for the
release of an American POW, Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl. Like most
Americans, I am heartened to know that Sergeant Bergdahl is on his way
home to his family and friends. No matter your political persuasion,
the thought of an American serviceman in the hands of our terrorist
enemies is abhorrent. What most concerns me about this incident is that
the President has seemingly violated the law by refusing to work with
Congress. This isn't a Democrat or Republican issue. This is an issue
of respecting the rule of law.

In the coming weeks, I expect that Congress will investigate the

that we can hold him accountable for his actions.
Working Together to Provide for America's Veterans
This week the House Veterans Affairs Committee is going to hold an
important hearing assessing the extent to which VA officials have been
manipulating data about wait times at VA hospitals. We are all angry
and dismayed at the lack of compassion that our veterans at the Phoenix
VA hospital were subjected to by bureaucratic roadblocks. The House has
already passed a bill making it easier to fire VA officials who
mismanaged veterans' cases, and also the Senate has come to a
bipartisan agreement to move toward allowing veterans to access private
health care options if the VA is failing to serve them.
You can read
more about that bipartisan agreement below.

You may remember that my office hosted a Veterans Assistance Open House
in Gwinnett County
this past January to bring government agencies at the
Federal and state level together with veterans in our area to ensure
that our veterans are getting the services they have earned.
On
Friday, June 27th I am hosting another Veterans Assistance Open House,
this time at the Cumming Regional Readiness Center at 100 Aquatic
Circle in Cumming.
You will be hearing more about this event in the
coming weeks, but I hope you put it on your calendar now and tell any
veterans you know in Forsyth County that they are welcome to attend.
Supporting Georgia National Guard
On Saturday I had the opportunity to speak at the National Guard
Association of Georgia's (NGAGA) state conference about how important
it is that Congress and the National Guard work together.
In the past
decade, we have called on our National Guard soldiers to shoulder a
heavy burden -- both here and abroad -- to protect us from terrorism
and to secure our homeland.
Just as we must take care of our active
duty military personnel, we must do the same for our National Guard
soldiers.
I was proud to work with my friends in the Georgia National
Guard earlier this year to support their goals in the National Defense
Authorization Act, and I hope that our relationship will grow in the
future.
Rep. Rob Woodall speaks at the National Guard Association State
Conference in Stone Mountain, Georgia on June 7th.
Please take a moment to visit the NGAGA's website
to learn more about how you can support our National Guard.
The Week Ahead
This week the House will consider the Transportation and Housing and
Urban Development (THUD) Appropriations Act of 2015
. I
expect that we will be debating amendments late into the night tonight
and tomorrow. And I'm so pleased that we will because that means that
not only is the House continuing to move forward on our essential
function to fund the government but we're doing in an open and
transparent manner that takes into account the needs of every
Congressional district. I look forward to working together with my
colleagues to pass a bipartisan THUD bill.
The House Rules Committee, on which I sit, may also consider the
Agriculture and Food and Drug Administration Appropriations Act of 2015
and a number of bills to extend expired tax credits on charitable
contributions and small businesses.
