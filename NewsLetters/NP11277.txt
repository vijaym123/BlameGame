Health Care Law Creates Tax
Confusion
As tax season approaches, many Americans are
busy organizing their W-2s and other necessary information to properly
file their taxes. I hear from Kansans who are already confused about
the overly complex and complicated tax code. But now, Americans may run
into even more confusion during tax time. The
Wall Street
Journal
published an article last week explaining how the confusion and
complications involved with the Affordable Care Act will lead to
problems for Americans around tax time.
"Headaches over the health-care overhaul are likely to grow in the
coming year as tens of millions of Americans face the task of
establishing that they have insurance coverage to avoid paying penalties, tax
experts say." - Wall Street
Journal.
Very serious flaws with the implementation of this
law still remain. The administration has already unilaterally granted
numerous exemptions to big businesses, labor unions, special interest
groups and others. But the administration has still not granted
individuals and small businesses the same fairness under the law that others
have received. The House has worked to fix this important problem and
give all Americans a reprieve from the penalties, yet the Senate and
the president refuse to act.

Health Insurance Premiums to Double,
Triple for Some
In a double-dose of bad news for
Americans, some health industry officials are speculating that insurance
premiums may double, or even triple, next year for many of those who receive
insurance through the Affordable Care Act
exchanges.
"Health industry
officials say ObamaCare-related premiums will double in some parts of
the country, countering claims recently made by the administration. The
industry complaints come less than a week after Health and Human
Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius sought to downplay concerns
about rising premiums in the healthcare sector. She told lawmakers rates
would increase in 2015 but grow more slowly than in the past." -

Visiting St. Luke's South
I had an
informative visit to
St. Luke's South Hospital
in
Overland Park last week. It was good to visit with CEO Jani Johnson, and I
thank her for taking the time to share with me the mission and vision of
St. Lukes South, as well as her concerns about increasing costs and
burdens from changes in federal health care policy. We had a great
tour and I especially enjoyed seeing the
E-Intensive Care Unit
(E-ICU)
and got to see the excellent care doctors can
provide through technology when distance and proximity is an issue for
Kansans.
Meeting with me
last week at St. Luke's South was Tim Van Zandt, VP of Public
Affairs; Jani Johnson, CEO of St. Lukes South; my wife Brooke; Julia Woods,
VP and Chief Nursing officer; and Jennifer Bruning, Director of Public
Affairs
Kansas City Air Route Traffic Control
Center
I enjoyed touring the
Kansas City Air Route Traffic Control
Center
in Olathe. Thank you to Lowell Hought, Executive
Officer to the Air Traffic Manager, for showing me around the entire
facility last week. Kansas City Air Route Traffic Control Center is one of
just over 20 similar facilities across the US as part of the US National
Airspace System. The facility is home to around 225 air traffic
controllers and over 90 technicians with a supporting staff and management
team. The center oversees safe air traffic averaging 4,700 operations
per day.
Thank you
to Lowell for the tour, and for all the managers and staff at the KC
Air Route Traffic Control Center for the very important work they
do.
KU Advancement Board Breakfast in Overland
Park
Last Monday, I attended the 2nd
Annual
KU Advancement Board
"Brackfest," where we heard NCAA
bracket picks and discussion by former KU basketball coaches and
players. The KU Advancement Board is an advisory group made up of
members of the University of Kansas Medical Center, The University of Kansas
Hospital and the University of Kansas Physicians. The Advancement
Board aims to help improve Kansas City-area medical research and health
care services.
It was
great to hear from KU basketball greats Dave Robisch and Ted
Owens.
KCK Area Chamber of Commerce Coffee
Event
I enjoyed stopping by the
KCK Area Chamber of
Commerce
in downtown Kansas City, Kansas on Thursday
morning to visit with folks at their morning coffee and networking event. Ed
Doering with
Kansas City SCORE
was there to answer
questions about their mentoring services and efforts to educate
entrepreneurs. The SCORE Foundation was formed in 2001 and is a nonprofit
public charity dedicated to providing business counseling and training
for American small businesses.
Thanks to Ed for his work at SCORE helping area small businesses
grow, and thank you for the KCK Chamber for organizing the morning coffee
and networking event.
In Studio with KMBZ's Darla
Jaye
Last week, I went in studio to speak with
Darla Jaye
during her KMBZ radio
program. We discussed several important topics including the
investigation following the IRS targeting of conservative political groups; the
president's foreign policy and the situation in Ukraine involving
Russia and Crimea; the administration's continued use of executive orders;
and more. I also answered a few questions that listeners texted to
Darla.
Thank you, Darla - it's
always good to visit with you and your
listeners.
