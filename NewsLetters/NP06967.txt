Friend -
The devastating onslaught of persecution of Christians that we have seen in Iraq is both gut-wrenching and heartbreaking. We can't even begin to wrap our minds around the horror and suffering. I am praying for them as they flee their homes in search of safety, and for all the innocents in peril in Iraq right now.
Yours in service,
Randy
