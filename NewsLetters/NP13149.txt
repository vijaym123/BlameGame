Dear Friend:
As our nation continues to grapple with the
effects of Obama Care and continued enrollment
challenges; Ive been working this week to
address two important components of
ObamaCare.
Protect Americans Private
Health Care Information
I joined a group of members of Congress this
week in backing legislation to help protect
Americans private health care information.
The Health Exchange Security and Transparency Act
(S. 1902), introduced by U.S. Senators John
Barrasso (R-WY) and Mike Johanns (R-NE), will
require the Secretary of Health and Human
Services to notify Americans within two business
days if their personal information has been
stolen due to a breach of security on the
insurance exchanges included in the
Presidents health care law.
The American people deserve nothing less than
to know their information is secure when
enrolling for healthcare. As Ive said in
the past, the Obama Care exchanges
with
the lack of security and safeguards
are a
fraudsters dream. With so much uncertainty
in the website and reports that this information
may be susceptible to hackers, its
imperative Americans have peace of mind that
their privacy will be protected.
In addition to me, the Health Exchange
Security and Transparency Act is co-sponsored by
Senators Tom Coburn (R-OK), Thad Cochran (R-MS),
Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and Jerry Moran (R-KS).
The Health Exchange Security and Transparency
Act mirrors legislation introduced in the House
of Representatives on January 6th by
Representative Joe Pitts (R-PA).
National Health Spending Report. .
.ObamaCare Has Not Reduced Costs of Health
Care in America
In other ObamaCare news, a report from the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) on
national health spending trends for 2012 confirms
ObamaCare hasnt reduced health care costs
in America as the President promised it
would.
This
report
shows that the Administration's promise
that ObamaCare would rein in the skyrocketing
health care costs is false. The reality is that
our weak economy, coupled with millions of
Americans getting kicked off of their health
insurance, has led to a dip in national health
care costs. But this doesn't take into account
the soaring premiums and higher deductibles that
are about to hit the pocketbooks of hard-working
families or ObamaCare's unprecedented Medicaid
expansion that will cripple state budgets. This
report shouldn't be a cause for celebration, but
rather is a precursor to higher costs and more
broken promises.
This weeks
report
specifically stated,
The Affordable Care Act (ACA), which
was enacted in March 2010, had a minimal impact
on overall national health spending growth
through 2012.
In September 2013, CMS released a
report
saying the Affordable Care Act will
actually increase health care costs moving
forward.
I will continue to work diligently to address
the challenges that continue to plague Utahns
because of ObamaCare and work to find solutions
that make sense for our nation and its
citizens.
Sincerely,
Orrin Hatch
