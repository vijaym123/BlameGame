Year-End Update
Dear Friend,
The first session of the 113th Congress has come to an end, and I
wanted to provide you with a summary of the year's legislative
activities.
It's been a frustrating year in Congress, characterized primarily by
gridlock over government spending - particularly spending to implement
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
The conflict came to a head in October with the 16-day federal
government shut-down. Cooler heads prevailed, eventually, and Congress
approved a bill (H.R. 2775
) which:
*	funded the federal government through January 15, 2014;
*	required a House-Senate conference committee to produce a
budget for 2014 by December 13, 2013; and
*	suspended the national debt limit through February 7, 2014.
This legislation, which I supported
, provided temporary funding for federal
government operations and pre-empted default on the national debt so
that a compromise budget for 2014 could be worked out and more time
would be available to address the debt limit.
The first goal has been met. House and Senate negotiators managed to
reach an agreement on a budget for 2014 and 2015 (H.J.Res. 59, the
Bipartisan Budget Act
) by the
December 13 deadline, and it was approved by both bodies of Congress.
I voted in support of
the Bipartisan Budget Act
.
While I was dissatisfied with many
provisions in the legislation - most notably its inadequate funding
levels and its failure to extend federal unemployment benefits -
H.J.Res. 59
did roll
back some of the misguided and arbitrary spending cuts made under
"sequestration" and authorized funding for federal operations for 2014
and 2015. The House-Senate conference committee split the difference
between the House-passed budget ($966 billion) and the Senate version
($1.058 Trillion) at $1.012 Trillion, increasing funding levels for
important programs like Head Start.
I thought it was important for Congress to take a step back from the
edge of the cliff and to "keep the lights on" while we wrestled with
the debt limit and 2014 spending. I also thought it was important to
express my support for a return to "regular order" - and my strong
opposition to crisis-driven decision-making. I'm fed up with certain
Members of Congress holding the federal government and/or our economy
hostage time and again in order to impose policies that they can't
enact through the normal legislative process. I believe it slows down
job creation and economic growth, hurts American households and
businesses, and undermines our democratic system of government.
When the Second Session of the 113th Congress begins in January,
Congress will have a lot on its plate. We need to pass legislation
funding the federal government for the rest of the year by January 15.
We need to address the debt limit by February 7. In addition, I want to
revisit the parts of the budget agreement that I found unacceptable -
most notably the failure to extend federal unemployment benefits for
the long-term unemployed and the cuts made in cost of living
adjustments for military retirees under the age of 62.
Congress will have a lot on its plate the rest of the year, as well. I
believe that our top priority should continue to be promoting economic
growth and more rapid job creation - and that the austerity policies
supported
by the Republican-led Congressional
majority are misguided and counterproductive. In addition, we need to
finish work on the "farm bill" - legislation controlling federal
agriculture and nutrition programs. We ought to take up immigration
reform; the Senate passed a comprehensive bipartisan immigration reform
bill some time ago, but the House Majority Leadership refuses to bring
it to the Floor for a vote. The authorization for federal surface
transportation programs expires in September 2014 unless Congress acts.
I'd like to see Congress enact tougher gun control legislation as well.
Whether any of that will happen is an open question. Congress, like the
American public, is deeply divided over the question of what the
federal government should - and shouldn't - do, along with how much it
should spend and how much it should raise in revenues. Compromise on
such big differences is extremely difficult.
I will continue to work to enact legislation that I believe is in our
nation's best interest. On economic and budget issues, I will support
legislation to create new jobs and encourage economic growth. I will
work to protect essential safety net programs like the Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program from cuts. I will work to enact
comprehensive immigration reform that creates a path to citizenship.
And I will work to promote federal policies like education and job
training that provide every American with opportunities to find a good
job, work hard, support a family, and eventually retire without undue
fears about poverty and unaffordable health care.
It is an honor to serve you and all of the residents of Pennsylvania's
14th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Please feel free to contact me whenever you want to request my
assistance or share your views on particular federal government
policies.
Until next time, I am

Year-End
Update
Dear
Friend,
The
first
session
of
the
113th
Congress
has
come
to
an
end,
and
I
wanted
to
provide
you
with
a
summary
of
the
year&#8217;s
legislative
activities.
It&#8217;s
been
a
frustrating
year
in
Congress,
characterized
primarily
by
gridlock
over
government
spending
&#8211;
particularly
spending
to
implement
the
Patient
Protection
and
Affordable
Care
Act.
The
conflict
came
to
a
head
in
October
with
the
16-day
federal
government
shut-down.
Cooler
heads
prevailed,
eventually,
and
Congress
approved
a
bill
( H.R.
2775 )
which: funded
the
federal
government
through
January
15,
2014; required
a
House-Senate
conference
committee
to
produce
a
budget
for
2014
by
December
13,
2013;
and suspended
the
national
debt
limit
through
February
7,
2014.
This
legislation,
which
I
supported ,
provided
temporary
funding
for
federal
government
operations
and
pre-empted
default
on
the
national
debt
so
that
a
compromise
budget
for
2014
could
be
worked
out
and
more
time
would
be
available
to
address
the
debt
limit.
The
first
goal
has
been
met.
House
and
Senate
negotiators
managed
to
reach
an
agreement
on
a
budget
for
2014
and
2015
( H.J.Res.
59,
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act )
by
the
December
13
deadline,
and
it
was
approved
by
both
bodies
of
Congress.
I
voted
in
support
of
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act .
While
I
was
dissatisfied
with
many
provisions
in
the
legislation
&#8211;
most
notably
its
inadequate
funding
levels
and
its
failure
to
extend
federal
unemployment benefits
&#8211;
H.J.Res.
59
did
roll
back
some
of
the
misguided
and
arbitrary
spending
cuts
made
under
&#8220;sequestration&#8221;
and
authorized
funding
for
federal
operations
for
2014
and
2015.
The
House-Senate
conference
committee
split
the
difference
between
the
House-passed
budget
($966
billion)
and
the
Senate
version
($1.058
Trillion)
at
$1.012
Trillion,
increasing
funding
levels
for
important
programs
like
Head
Start.
I
thought
it
was
important
for
Congress
to
take
a
step
back
from
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
to
&#8220;keep
the
lights
on&#8221;
while
we
wrestled
with
the
debt
limit
and
2014
spending.
I
also
thought
it
was
important
to
express
my
support
for
a
return
to
&#8220;regular
order&#8221;
&#8211;
and
my
strong
opposition
to
crisis-driven
decision-making.
I'm
fed
up
with
certain
Members
of
Congress
holding
the
federal
government
and/or
our
economy
hostage
time
and
again
in
order
to
impose
policies
that
they
can&#8217;t
enact
through
the
normal
legislative
process.
I
believe
it
slows
down
job
creation
and
economic
growth,
hurts
American
households
and
businesses,
and
undermines
our
democratic
system
of
government.
When
the
Second
Session
of
the
113th
Congress
begins
in
January,
Congress
will
have
a
lot
on
its
plate.
We
need
to
pass
legislation
funding
the
federal
government
for
the
rest
of
the
year
by
January
15.
We
need
to
address
the
debt
limit
by
February
7.
In
addition,
I
want
to
revisit
the
parts
of
the
budget
agreement
that
I
found
unacceptable
&#8211;
most
notably
the
failure
to
extend
federal
unemployment
benefits
for
the
long-term
unemployed
and
the
cuts
made
in
cost
of
living
adjustments
for
military
retirees
under
the
age
of
62.
Congress
will
have
a
lot
on
its
plate
the
rest
of
the
year,
as
well.
I
believe
that
our
top
priority
should
continue
to
be
promoting
economic
growth
and
more
rapid
job
creation
&#8211;
and
that
the
austerity
policies
supported
by
the
Republican-led
Congressional
majority
are
misguided
and
counterproductive.
In
addition,
we
need
to
finish
work
on
the
&#8220;farm
bill&#8221;
&#8211;
legislation
controlling
federal
agriculture
and
nutrition
programs.
We
ought
to
take
up
immigration
reform;
the
Senate
passed
a
comprehensive
bipartisan
immigration
reform
bill
some
time
ago,
but
the
House
Majority
Leadership
refuses
to
bring
it
to
the
Floor
for
a
vote.
The
authorization
for
federal
surface
transportation
programs
expires
in
September
2014
unless
Congress
acts.
I&#8217;d
like
to
see
Congress
enact
tougher
gun
control
legislation
as
well.
Whether
any
of
that
will
happen
is
an
open
question.
Congress,
like
the
American
public,
is
deeply
divided
over
the
question
of
what
the
federal
government
should
&#8211;
and
shouldn&#8217;t
&#8211;
do,
along
with
how
much
it
should
spend
and
how
much
it
should
raise
in
revenues.
Compromise
on
such
big
differences
is
extremely
difficult.
I
will
continue
to
work
to
enact
legislation
that
I
believe
is
in
our
nation&#8217;s
best
interest.
On
economic
and
budget
issues,
I
will
support
legislation
to
create
new
jobs
and
encourage
economic
growth.
I
will
work
to
protect
essential
safety
net
programs
like
the
Supplemental
Nutrition
Assistance
Program
from
cuts.
I
will
work
to
enact
comprehensive
immigration
reform
that
creates
a
path
to
citizenship.
And
I
will
work
to
promote
federal
policies
like
education
and
job
training
that
provide
every
American
with
opportunities
to
find
a
good
job,
work
hard,
support
a
family,
and
eventually
retire
without
undue
fears
about
poverty
and
unaffordable
health
care.
