You Just Can't Make This Stuff Up
Tuesday, February 18, 2014
In an Energy and Commerce Committee business meeting on
February 6, 2013
(video 2 at 32 minutes and 43 seconds), Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) was discussing the planetary problem of climate change and said, You know, in Chicago, we had 335 days without snow, which is a record.
And as I was saying yesterday at the hearing, you know, we all get cards around the holidays of these wonderful snow scenes.
And it caught my heart for a minute thinking I am going to explain to my grandchildren that this was Chicago, these were the kind of scenes that we would see in the Midwest every winter.
That is how it was.
Well, according to the
Chicago Tribune ,
by 6pm yesterday,
the Windy City has received a total of 66.8 inches of snow this 2013-2014 winter season.
This most recent snowfall pushed the city to its fifth-snowiest winter season ever.
You would have to go back to the winter of 1951-1952 to come close to seeing as much snow as they have seen this season!
And of course, the 2013-2014 winter is not yet over.
In a
written opening statement
submitted to the Committee in
late January
(other remarks in video 2 at 1 hour and 22 minutes), Rep. Schakowsky said, Last year was the fourth-hottest in history.
Now, in 2014, we are dealing with record cold.
My hometown of Chicago has closed schools today and will again tomorrow
with wind chill temperatures more than 30 degrees below zero.
Already, this is the third-snowiest winter on record in Chicago.
This extreme weather is a clear sign.
There is no question that climate change is real and that it is man-made.
Last year, climate change was responsible for Rep. Schakowsky having to explain to her grandchildren what a snowy winter is like.
This year, its responsible for Chicago getting the most snow it has seen since 1951-1952.
Folks, you just cant make this stuff up!
