In the
District
Last week and this week the House of Representatives
is not in session which affords members of Congress the opportunity to
spend time in the district chatting with constituents, attending local
events and touring local businesses. To that end, I spent the week
traveling throughout the Sixth District listening to folks share their
thoughts and concerns about how to make our dynamic community even
stronger.
Stops along the way
included a visit to the Georgia Eye Bank where we learned about the
incredible work they are doing on behalf of the visually impaired and a
visit to WellStars Kennestone Imaging Center in East Cobb to discuss the
importance of early screening in the fight against cancer. On
Thursday, I spoke at the North Atlanta Rotary Club where I was able to share
with folks different policy initiatives and issue areas that demand our
focus and time to help ensure we are solving the nations challenges
whether they be economical, fiscal, related to our health care
system or others.
Theres no doubt
there is plenty of work to be done to ensure more Americans are having
the opportunity to achieve success for themselves and their families.
As always, meeting and listening to folks all across the Sixth
District is critical to making sure we are fighting for positive, common
sense solutions.
