Do you think Congress should enact a National Ocean Policy?
Yes - It is critical for the protection and maintenance of the many
uses of our oceans
Maybe - A National Ocean Policy is critical, but States should decide
their ocean policies
No - A National Ocean Policy is an overreach of the federal government,
and it will hurt our economy

This was an emotional week for Americans. The Isla Vista shooting last
Friday was a powerful reminder of the fragility of human life and the
unpredictable nature of gun violence in our communities. While a
senseless tragedy, I hope it will serve as a wake-up call for Congress
to finally enact policies that put a stop to the gun violence that is
plaguing communities across the nation.
My heart aches for the families and friends affected by the senseless
massacre in Isla Vista.
It is astonishing to me that Congress has refused to address the
growing issue of gun violence in our society, especially as we
experience tragedy after tragedy. As I have said again and again, gun
violence is a public health issue.
We must also prevent individuals who are a danger to themselves from
owning weapons, and we must have an honest discussion on the balance
between Second Amendment rights and public safety. At the very least, I
believe that Republicans and Democrats can both agree that we must
focus on improving our mental health system.
Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership
On Wednesday, Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker designated Southern
California as one of the 12 Manufacturing Communities, as part of the
Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership (IMCP) initiative.
This designation recognizes the industrious and innovative spirit of
Southern California and will bring important resources to our vibrant
regional economy.
The Southern California manufacturing community is as vibrant as it is
diverse. I am thankful that Secretary Pritzker recognizes the ongoing
contributions they make to our regional community.

LAPD Gun Buyback On May 31st
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and the city's Office of Gang Reduction
and Youth Development recently announced an anonymous gun buyback
program for our region. In an effort to reduce gun violence in our
region, Ralph's Grocery Store gift cards will be offered to those who
turn in their firearms. This is a worry-free program, with no questions
asked and no repercussions.
Over the years, this buyback has taken nearly 12,000 guns off the
street. The gift card amount exchanged per firearm is $200 for assault
weapons and up to $100 for handguns, rifles, and shotguns.
People can surrender their firearms between 8:00 AM and 3:00 PM on May
31st at four locations:
Central Los Angeles

For Maya Angelou
This week, the world lost a poet, a leader, and a timeless icon.
Maya Angelou's words have pushed the boundaries of our culture and
society, made us look inside our own characters, and helped us cherish
and celebrate the spirit of strength and love. Having grown up during
the Civil Rights Movement, it was such a joy to have seen her
involvement with the cause for civil rights and equality for all. I
will never forget her prose and her endless determination that was
conveyed so beautifully through poetry.
The Case for a National Ocean Policy
This week, the House of Representatives voted on the annual Commerce,
Justice, and Science (CJS) Appropriations Bill, which distributed
previously-authorized funding to various federal government agencies
and their programs. The CJS bill is one of the twelve appropriations
bills that the House votes on.
The CJS bill contained many amendments, or revisions, that altered some
of the bill's provisions. Some were good and some were bad. One of the
bad amendments, which unfortunately passed, would make no funds
available for the establishment of a National Ocean Policy (NOP). Such
a policy would set-up a commission to ensure the responsible use of the
oceans that surround our nation.
I believe the 47th District is an area that perfectly highlights the
need for ocean coordination and information sharing between local,
state, and federal governments, the military, ports, carriers, energy
developers, recreational users, and many other stakeholders. A NOP
would help us achieve this.
The Port of Long Beach is the second busiest port in the U.S., moving
$140 billion in goods and supporting 1.4 million jobs in the U.S.;
offshore oil platforms extract crude oil in San Pedro Bay less than a
mile from Long Beach's city center; San Clemente Island in our district
has a Navy training ground and a ship-to-shore firing range; nearby
waters are home to seabirds, fisheries, and migrating whales;
and, sea
level rise and extreme weather threaten neighborhoods and businesses
all along the district and the entire coast of California .
These ocean uses are all interwoven
and it doesn't make sense to draft
policy regarding them on an ad-hoc, case-by-case basis or without all
of the stakeholders participating. Simply, we need smart ocean planning
and coordination.
For those reasons, I believe that the amendment offered was
counterproductive. Not only would it prohibit NOP coordination and
information sharing between federal and state agencies, tribes, and
local governments, but it would force us back to the inefficient,
costly, and overly buearacratic
methods previously in place.
The country and our district need a comprehensive approach to our ocean
resources, which the NOP provides. Hopefully, we will soon see the
establishment of such a policy.
Asian Pacific American Heritage Month
May is Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. I am proud to join with
thousands of people in my district and millions across our country in
celebration. The recognition of this month reminds us of the courage
and bravery with which millions of Asian Pacific Americans made the
journey to the United States to build a better life for themselves and
their children.
This week, I spoke on the House floor to honor this important month.

A Visit from Cypress High School Students
Earlier this week, on the steps of the United States Capitol, I met
with students from Cypress High School who were visiting Washington,
D.C. We discussed everything from comprehensive immigration reform and
student loans to bipartisanship and legislative procedure. It was such
a joy to hear how informed and interested they were in the political
process. As a former professor, it was walk down memory lane for me to
get to speak to students!
"Acting Chairman of the House and Speaker Pro Tempore"
When the House is in session and voting, there is always a Member of
Congress who presides, or oversees, the House floor. While this person
is usually the Speaker of the House, there are times when the Speaker
is unavailable to manage the time on the floor.
This is why there are designated Acting Chairmen, Acting Chairwomen, as
well as a Speaker Pro Tempore, to fill-in for the Speaker.
Typically, when the House is voting for hours on end, the Acting
Chairperson and Speaker Pro Tempore, the second highest position in the
House, will take turns presiding over the House. Even though they are
the ones who control the time on the House floor, they are still able
to cast their vote when the other Members of Congress do so.
Do you think oil and gas companies must be held to higher standards
when their drilling activities take place on public lands as opposed to
drilling activities on private land?
65.2%
Yes - It is critical for the protection of our public lands and
the safety of our communities
4.3%
Maybe -These companies should only be regulated on public lands
where endangered species and sensitive habitats are present
27.2%
No - These companies are already regulated enough
3.3%

This
was

The

last
Friday
was
a

of
the

While
a

My

aches
for
the
families

affected
by
the

It

For
Maya
Angelou
This
week,
the
world
lost
a
poet,
a
leader,
and
a
timeless
icon.
Maya
Angelou&#8217;s
words
have
pushed
the
boundaries
of
our
culture
and
society,
made
us
look
inside
our
own
characters,
and
helped
us
cherish
and
celebrate
the
spirit
of
strength
and
love.
Having
grown
up
during
the
Civil
Rights
Movement,
it
was
such
a
joy
to
have
seen
her
involvement
with
the
cause
for
civil
rights
and
equality
for
all.
I
will
never
forget
her
prose
and
her
endless
determination
that
was
conveyed
so
beautifully
through
poetry.
The
Case
for
a
National
Ocean
Policy
This
week,
the
House
of
Representatives
voted
on
the
annual
Commerce,
Justice,
and
Science
(CJS)
Appropriations
Bill,
which
distributed
previously-authorized
funding
to
various
federal
government
agencies
and
their
programs.
The
CJS
bill
is
one
of
the
twelve
appropriations
bills
that
the
House
votes
on.
The
CJS
bill
contained
many
amendments,
or
revisions,
that
altered
some
of
the
bill&#8217;s
provisions.
Some
were
good
and
some
were
bad.
One
of
the
bad
amendments,
which
unfortunately
passed,
would
make
no
funds
available
for
the
establishment
of
a
National
Ocean
Policy
(NOP).
Such
a
policy
would
set-up
a
commission
to
ensure
the
responsible
use
of
the
oceans
that
surround
our
nation.
I
believe
the
47th
District
is
an
area
that
perfectly
highlights
the
need
for
ocean
coordination
and
information
sharing
between
local,
state,
and
federal
governments,
the
military,
ports,
carriers,
energy
developers,
recreational
users,
and
many
other
stakeholders.
A
NOP
would
help
us
achieve
this.
The
Port
of
Long
Beach
is
the
second
busiest
port
in
the
U.S.,
moving
$140
billion
in
goods
and
supporting
1.4
million
jobs
in
the
U.S.;
offshore
oil
platforms
extract
crude
oil
in
San
Pedro
Bay
less
than
a
mile
from
Long
Beach&#8217;s
city
center;
San
Clemente
Island
in
our
district
has
a
Navy
training
ground
and
a
ship-to-shore
firing
range;
nearby
waters
are
home
to
seabirds,
fisheries,
and
migrating
whales;
and,
sea
level
rise
and
extreme
weather
threaten
neighborhoods
and
businesses
all
along
the
district
and
the
entire
coast
of
California
These
ocean
uses
are
all
interwoven
and
it
doesn&#8217;t
make
sense
to
draft
policy
regarding
them
on
an
ad-hoc,
case-by-case
basis
or
without
all
of
the
stakeholders
participating.
Simply,
we
need
smart
ocean
planning
and
coordination.
For
those
reasons,
I
believe
that
the
amendment
offered
was
counterproductive.
Not
only
would
it
prohibit
NOP
coordination
and
information
sharing
between
federal
and
state
agencies,
tribes,
and
local
governments,
but
it
would
force
us
back
to
the
inefficient,
costly,
and
overly
buearacratic
methods
previously
in
place.
The
country
and
our
district
need
a
comprehensive
approach
to
our
ocean
resources,
which
the
NOP
provides.
Hopefully,
we
will
soon
see
the
establishment
of
such
a
policy.

"Acting
Chairman
of
the
House
and

When
the
House
is
in
session
and
voting,
there
is
always
a
Member
of
Congress
who
presides,
or
oversees,
the
House
floor.
While
this
person
is
usually
the
Speaker
of
the
House,
there
are
times
when
the
Speaker
is
unavailable
to
manage
the
time
on
the
floor.
This
is
why
there
are
designated
Acting
Chairmen,
Acting
Chairwomen,
as
well
as
a
Speaker
Pro

to
fill-in
for
the
Speaker.
Typically,
when
the

is
voting
for
hours
on
end,
the
Acting
Chairperson
and
Speaker
Pro
Tempore,
the
second
highest
position
in
the
House,
will
take
turns
presiding
over
the

Even
though
they
are
the

on
the
House
floor,
they
are
still
able
to
cast
their
vote
when
the
other
