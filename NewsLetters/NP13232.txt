Bringing Certainty to Tax Policy
Recently, I've been getting questions
about expiring
tax laws and what that means for local businesses.
One deduction in
particular helps businesses invest in new equipment and increase jobs
and economic growth.
The Section 179 deduction
allows business owners to
purchase new equipment and deduct the entire depreciation amount in a
single year.
For instance, the lifetime depreciation of a tractor
could be deducted entirely during the year of its purchase, making the
purchase more affordable.
When businesses invest in new equipment,
that creates jobs across the economy.
So I'm a strong supporter of
this tax policy.
Unfortunately, Section 179 is one of many short-term tax policies that
expire every few years.
That's problematic because it doesn't give
businesses much certainty when planning ahead.
In years past, Congress
has renewed tax extenders after they've expired, and made sure that
they were retroactive so there wasn't a gap in these tax policies.
But
how do you think that affects businesses making plans right now?
Would
you invest in new equipment if you weren't sure how it would be taxed
this year?
Probably not.
That's why I'm advocating for comprehensive tax reform that gives
families and businesses certainty.
We need to make sure our tax policy
is designed to encourage economic growth.
And we need a system that is
simple, transparent, and easy to understand.
I'll keep working on your
behalf to make that a reality.
Supreme Court Reviews Recess Appointments
This week, the Supreme Court is taking up a case
that will determine whether or not
recent Presidential appointments were constitutional.
The
Constitution gives the President power to make appointments during
times when the Senate is out of session-or in recess, as we say.
But
when President Obama made these "recess appointments" in 2012, the
Senate was not in recess.
The Senate was still holding periodic
sessions, but the President decided that he had the authority to make
recess appointments and moved ahead with controversial nominees to the
National Labor Relations Board.
I don't think I have to tell you that the President's unilateral action
was problematic.
He side-stepped Senate approval to appoint high-level
executives to positions that have a broad ability to influence our
economy-positions that should be subject to the highest standards of
transparency and accountability.
What's worse, he violated our system
of checks and balances to do so.
I'll be following this case closely, and I'll keep you updated on the
Court's decisions.
The President is not above the law, and I'm hopeful
the Supreme Court will hold him accountable to the American people.
Farm Bill Update
Unfortunately, the Farm Bill hasn't yet been brought to the Farm Bill
Conference Committee for a vote yet.
I'm disappointed that we haven't
been able to get this done already, but I'm optimistic that we're
almost at the finish line.
Right now, one of the biggest issues that
remains undecided is how we'll manage dairy programs.
Dairy production
is important to Texas-it accounts for about ten percent
of
agricultural receipts.
And dairy policy has a direct effect on the
price you pay in the grocery store for milk, cheese, yogurt, and the
entire range of dairy products.
The Senate bill would require producers to cut milk production when
prices hit a certain level.
That means the government would be
determining how much milk they could supply to consumers.
There's a
reason Speaker of the House John Boehner calls it a "Soviet style
" program.
Unfortunately, despite an overwhelming House vote to
remove this provision from the Farm Bill, some lawmakers are intent on
putting it back in the bill.
Until that's resolved, we can't move
forward.
So I'm working to keep our market-based reforms in place to
support dairy producers and keep milk affordable for Texas families.

Bringing
Certainty
to
Tax
Policy
Recently,
I&#8217;ve
been
getting
questions
about
expiring
tax
laws
and
what
that
means
for
local
businesses.
One
deduction
in
particular
helps
businesses
invest
in
new
equipment
and
increase
jobs
and
economic
growth.
The
Section
179
deduction
allows
business
owners to
purchase
new
equipment
and
deduct
the
entire
depreciation
amount
in
a
single
year.
For
instance,
the
lifetime
depreciation
of
a
tractor
could
be
deducted
entirely
during
the
year
of
its
purchase,
making
the
purchase
more
affordable.
When
businesses
invest
in
new
equipment,
that
creates
jobs
across
the
economy.
So
I&#8217;m
a
strong
supporter
of
this
tax
policy.
Unfortunately,
Section
179
is
one
of
many
short-term
tax
policies
that
expire
every
few
years.
That&#8217;s
problematic
because
it
doesn&#8217;t
give
businesses
much
certainty
when
planning
ahead.
In
years
past,
Congress
has
renewed
tax
extenders
after
they&#8217;ve
expired,
and
made
sure
that
they
were
retroactive
so
there
wasn&#8217;t
a
gap
in
these
tax
policies.
But
how
do
you
think
that
affects
businesses
making
plans
right
now?
Would
you
invest
in
new
equipment
if
you
weren&#8217;t
sure
how
it
would
be
taxed
this
year?
Probably
not.
That&#8217;s
why
I&#8217;m
advocating
for
comprehensive
tax
reform
that
gives
families
and
businesses
certainty.
We
need
to
make
sure
our
tax
policy
is
designed
to
encourage
economic
growth.
And
we
need
a
system
that
is
simple,
transparent,
and
easy
to
understand.
I&#8217;ll
keep
working
on
your
behalf
to
make
that
a
reality.
Supreme
Court
Reviews
Recess
Appointments
This
week,
the
Supreme
Court
is
taking
up
a
case
that
will
determine
whether
or
not
recent
Presidential
appointments
were
constitutional.
The
Constitution
gives
the
President
power
to
make
appointments
during
times
when
the
Senate
is
out
of
session&#8212;or
in
recess,
as
we
say.
But
when
President
Obama
made
these
&#8220;recess
appointments&#8221;
in
2012,
the
Senate
was
not
in
recess.
The
Senate
was
still
holding
periodic
sessions,
but
the
President
decided
that
he
had
the
authority
to
make
recess
appointments
and
moved
ahead
with
controversial
nominees
to
the
National
Labor
Relations
Board.
I
don&#8217;t
think
I
have
to
tell
you
that
the
President&#8217;s
unilateral
action
was
problematic.
He
side-stepped
Senate
approval
to
appoint
high-level
executives
to
positions
that
have
a
broad
ability
to
influence
our
economy&#8212;positions
that
should
be
subject
to
the
highest
standards
of
transparency
and
accountability.
What&#8217;s
worse,
he
violated
our
system
of
checks
and
balances
to
do
so.
I&#8217;ll
be
following
this
case
closely,
and
I&#8217;ll
keep
you
updated
on
the
Court&#8217;s
decisions.
The
President
is
not
above
the
law,
and
I&#8217;m
hopeful
the
Supreme
Court
will
hold
him
accountable
to
the
American
people.
Farm
Bill
Update
Unfortunately,
the
Farm
Bill
hasn&#8217;t
yet
been
brought
to
the
Farm
Bill
Conference
Committee
for
a
vote
yet.
I&#8217;m
disappointed
that
we
haven&#8217;t
been
able
to
get
this
done
already,
but
I&#8217;m
optimistic
that
we&#8217;re
almost
at
the
finish
line.
Right
now,
one
of
the
biggest
issues
that
remains
undecided
is
how
we&#8217;ll
manage
dairy
programs.
Dairy
production
is
important
to
Texas&#8212;it
accounts
for
about
ten
percent
of
agricultural
receipts.
And
dairy
policy
has
a
direct
effect
on
the
price
you
pay
in
the
grocery
store
for
milk,
cheese,
yogurt,
and
the
entire
range
of
dairy
products.
The
Senate
bill
would
require
producers
to
cut
milk
production
when
prices
hit
a
certain
level.
That
means
the
government
would
be
determining
how
much
milk
they
could
supply
to
consumers.
There&#8217;s
a
reason
Speaker
of
the
House
John
Boehner
calls
it
a
&#8220; Soviet
style &#8221;
program.
Unfortunately,
despite
an
overwhelming
House
vote
to
remove
this
provision
from
the
Farm
Bill,
some
lawmakers
are
intent
on
putting
it
back
in
the
bill.
Until
that&#8217;s
resolved,
we
can&#8217;t
move
forward.
So
I&#8217;m
working
to
keep
our
market-based
reforms
in
place
to
support
dairy
producers
and
keep
milk
affordable
for
Texas
families.
