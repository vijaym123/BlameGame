May 11, 2014
Dear Friend,
When folks talk about the value of American freedom, Texans, and
especially San Antonians, understand those sacrifices in a deeply
personal way. Our state is home to the third largest active duty
military population with over 123,000 active personnel, 15 military
installations, and 1.7 million veterans living in the state.
As a Representative of Military City, USA and a member of the House
Committee on Armed Services and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs,
I feel a special obligation to ensure the safety and well-being of our
men and women in uniform, veterans, and their families.
I take that
responsibility extremely seriously.
Allegations recently emerged of Veterans Affairs (VA) officials
tampering with medical appointment data at some VA hospitals and
clinics, including in San Antonio and Austin.
These allegations, that
VA hospitals' officials tampered with waitlists in order to hide long
wait times at VA treatment facilities, are deeply troubling.
That is
why I wrote to Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki to ensure that
we get to the bottom of these charges. I look forward to the immediate
review of all procedures at all VA Medical Centers, especially in San
Antonio.
Also this week, during our work on the annual defense bill, the Armed
Services Committee debated for the first time an effort I championed to
determine whether to take sexual assault cases out of the chain of
command.
I worked with some of my colleagues to make the sexual
assault review process independent from the chain of command structure
by appointing a chief prosecutor who would be responsible for handling
sexual assault charges.
Unfortunately, our effort fell 5 votes short.
Progress within the military on this issue has come too slow and at too
high of a cost to our men and women in uniform. While this effort may
not have been successful this week, I'm optimistic that my colleagues
in Congress will continue to work together to rid sexual assault in our
armed forces and ensure justice for the victims.
Congressional Art Competition
Last weekend, my office hosted the annual Congressional Art
Competition-An Artistic Discovery.
This event was a wonderful
opportunity to recognize the artistic talent of the high school
students in our district. 38 students participated in this year's
competition. Their art showcased this year's theme: What San Antonio
Means to Me.
This year's winning piece of art is "Natalie" by Kendra Shearer from
Thomas Jefferson High School, which features cascarones.
We must ensure that we are caring for and supporting our service
members and veterans in every way we can and with the high quality they
deserve.
These brave men and women stood up for our nation. As a
nation, we must be sure to stand up for them.
Sincerely,
Member of Congress
Join Me....
In Case You Missed It
Congratulations to all of our San Antonio area students graduating this
month!
I want to wish all moms a Happy Mother's Day!

Dear
Friend,
When
folks
talk
about
the
value
of
American
freedom,
Texans,
and
especially
San
Antonians,
understand
those
sacrifices
in
a
deeply
personal
way.
Our
state
is
home
to
the
third
largest
active
duty
military
population
with
over 123,000 active
personnel, 15
military
installations,
and
1.7
million
veterans
living
in
the
state.
As
a
Representative
of
Military
City,
USA
and
a
member
of
the
House
Committee
on
Armed
Services
and
the
House
Committee
on
Foreign
Affairs,
I
feel
a
special
obligation
to
ensure
the
safety
and
well-being
of
our
men
and
women
in
uniform,
veterans,
and
their
families.
I
take
that
responsibility
extremely
seriously.
Allegations
recently
emerged
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
officials
tampering
with
medical
appointment
data
at
some
VA
hospitals
and
clinics,
including
in
San
Antonio
and
Austin.
These
allegations,
that
VA
hospitals&#8217;
officials
tampered
with
waitlists
in
order
to
hide
long
wait
times
at
VA
treatment
facilities,
are
deeply
troubling.
That
is
why
I
wrote
to
Veterans
Affairs
Secretary
Eric
Shinseki
to
ensure
that
we
get
to
the
bottom
of
these
charges.
I
look
forward
to
the
immediate
review
of
all
procedures
at
all
VA
Medical
Centers,
especially
in
San
Antonio.
Also
this
week, during
our
work on
the
annual
defense
bill,
the
Armed
Services
Committee
debated
for
the
first
time
an
effort
I
championed
to
determine
whether
to take
sexual
assault
cases
out
of
the
chain
of
command.
I
worked
with
some
of
my
colleagues
to
make
the
sexual
assault
review
process
independent
from
the
chain
of
command
structure
by
appointing
a
chief
prosecutor
who
would
be
responsible
for
handling
sexual
assault
charges.
Unfortunately,
our
effort
fell
5
votes
short.
Progress
within
the
military
on
this
issue
has
come
too
slow
and
at
too
high
of
a
cost
to
our
men
and
women
in
uniform.
While
this
effort
may
not
have
been
successful
this
week,
I&#8217;m
optimistic
that
my
colleagues
in
Congress
will
continue
to
work
together
to
rid
sexual
assault
in
our
armed
forces
and
ensure
justice
for
the
victims.
Congressional
Art
Competition
Last
weekend,
my
office
hosted
the
annual Congressional
Art
Competition- An
Artistic
Discovery.
This
event
was
a
wonderful
opportunity
to
recognize
the
artistic
talent
of
the
high
school
students
in
our
district. 38
students
participated
in
this
year&#8217;s
competition.
Their
art
showcased
this
year&#8217;s
theme:
What
San
Antonio
Means
to
Me .
This
year&#8217;s
winning
piece
of
art
is
&#8220;Natalie&#8221;
by
Kendra
Shearer
from
Thomas
Jefferson
High
School,
which
features
cascarones.
We
must
ensure
that
we
are
caring
for
and
supporting
our
service
members
and
veterans
in
every
way
we
can
and
with
the
high
quality
they
deserve.
These
brave
men
and
women
stood
up
for
our
nation.
As
a
nation,
we
must
be
sure
to
stand
up
for
them.
Sincerely,
Member
of
Congress
