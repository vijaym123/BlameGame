21 st
Century Cures
what does it mean for you?
Dear Friend,
As you probably know, last year I launched the
21 st
Century Cures
initiative with my colleague, Congresswoman Diana DeGette, D-Colorado. This breakthrough bipartisan initiative aims to take a comprehensive look at what steps Congress can take to accelerate the pace of medical cures in America.
So what does this mean for you?
It means that if we want to save more lives we have to make sure theres not a major gap between the science of cures and the way we regulate these therapies.
It means health research is moving quickly, but the federal drug and device approval regulations are relics from another era. And when our laws dont keep pace with innovation, we all lose.
It means that we have folks in Congress willing to tackle the toughest issues and work in a bipartisan manner in order to get the job done for you.
It means were committed to helping families living with tragic diagnoses, and ultimately, we hope to eradicate diseases like Alzheimers, cancer, and more.
It means were focused on keeping Southwest Michigan as a worldwide hub for medical innovation and the jobs that come with it.
As we work towards a legislative solution in the next few months to get 21 st
Century Cures to the presidents desk by the end of the year, I hope you will
follow along
on our progress.
Together, we will get this done. For all of us.
God bless,
Fred
