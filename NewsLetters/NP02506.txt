Republicans&rsquo; control over Congress has been just disastrous, with attacks on Social Security and Obamacare and now the threat of a partial government shutdown. And if the GOP takes control of the White House AND Congress in 2016?

David, now is the time to renew.
Republicans&rsquo; control over Congress has been disastrous, with attacks on Social Security and Obamacare and now the threat of a partial government shutdown. And if the GOP takes control of the White House AND Congress in 2016? It would be an unmitigated catastrophe.
We can&rsquo;t let that happen -- and with your help, we won&rsquo;t.
We just need to take four vulnerable Republican seats and we&rsquo;ll reclaim the Senate majority. And we have four in mind:
In New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania --
purple or blue states
that President Obama won in 2008 and 2012
In Illinois, where current GOP Senator Mark Kirk
actually
said that &ldquo;If we have a successful terrorist attack, all the dead Americans... should be laid at the feet of the Democratic caucus.&quot;
These are four seats that we
absolutely
can take back with your help.
Please renew your membership so we can hold Republican extremists accountable and WIN the election for Democrats.
