20TH DISTRICT
July 30, 2014
Dear David,
In February, I
spoke with almost 6,000 New Yorkers on a region-wide telephone town hall
to connect with constituents, answer questions, and hear about
important issues and concerns.
Next Tuesday,
August 5th at 7:25 p.m., I will hold a similar forum. You can be sure to
get an invitation to this call by
emailing
your name and phone number to me here . Your information
will be kept private and will only be used to contact you about this
particular event.
For more information about
my next telephone town hall, please call my office. As always, thanks
for reading and please contact me if I can ever be of service to
you.
My door is always open.
P.S. Don't forget to
follow me on twitter
and
connect with me on facebook .
