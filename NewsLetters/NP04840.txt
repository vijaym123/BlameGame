Dear Friend &ndash;
Halloween is all about the spook-factor (and I am pretty darn good at pranks), but this Halloween there is one thing I don&rsquo;t want you to be afraid of: getting enrolled in quality, affordable health care through Covered California.
Open enrollment is around the corner and I want to make sure you are able to enroll in the best health insurance plan for you and your family.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m continuing my &ldquo;Enroll OC&rdquo; initiative to connect Orange County residents with certified, in person bilingual health insurance enrollment services.
Join me on Saturday, November 15, 2014, from 1:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. at the Plaza Santa Ana on the northwest corner of 4th &amp; French St in Downtown Santa Ana to kick off Covered California open enrollment season with fun, information and enrollment services.
For more information, please feel free to reach out to my office at 714-621-0102.
Very truly yours,
Loretta Sanchez
Member of Congress
