Friend,
When you heard the National Republican Congressional Committee pledged to spend nearly 1 million dollars in our district, you stepped up in a big way. You were willing to fight back, and it makes a difference.
But, the fight against the big outside dollars is just beginning.
On top of that, we&#39;re also preparing for the first opportunity in the general election to go head-to-head with our opponent and show the strength of our grassroots team.
We&#39;re coming up on a huge fundraising deadline on
June 30th
- this is the first deadline we&#39;ll face since the primary election, and
everyone watching our race (including our new, self-funding opponent) will use the number we post to judge our momentum . In order to keep up with the NRCC, other outside money, and our opponent&#39;s own personal wealth, we need to raise $15,000 by next
Monday, June 30th .
That sounds like a lot, I know. But the good news is - we&#39;ve got a $3,000 head start because of your amazing support last week.
Now, in order to stay competitive, we have to hit this next goal - click here to chip in $5 to make sure we get there.
The election gets closer and closer every day, and the outside money isn&#39;t going to stop flowing in.
We can&#39;t rest, even for a second.
Click here and give $5 or whatever you can today.
Thanks for fighting alongside us.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th district
