Working Together to Stop Human Trafficking
Last month, more than 300 young girls in Nigeria were kidnapped by
terrorists threatening to sell them to individuals who would use them
for sex or labor. We should all be outraged by these atrocities.
Sadly, the stark reality is that these horrible crimes are also going
on in our own backyard in North Dakota, hurting women, men, and
children in communities across our state. Statistics show on average
children are 13 years old when they are forced to become victims of sex
trafficking. Around the world, it is estimated that more than 20
million individuals are trafficked for sex or labor - including
thousands in the United States.
North Dakota's law enforcement has been working hard to crack down on
these crimes. But all of us need to do our part to raise awareness and
help stop human trafficking.
Recently, I joined officials from the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security (DHS) to help train Fargo area residents on identifying and
reporting potential occurrences of human trafficking to make sure our
families, women, and children in North Dakota are safe. What the
experts stress boils down to this: if you see something, say something.
Potential signs of someone being trafficked include: disorientation,
fearfulness, lack of attendance at school or work, physical bruises,
substandard work conditions, and signs of having been denied food,
water, sleep, or medical care. You can learn more about what to look
for in your community and how to report it by visiting
www.dhs.gov/blue-campaign/join-fight
.
I have made combatting human and sex trafficking one of my top
priorities in the Senate. In November, I helped introduce bipartisan
legislation with Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) to improve victims'
access to resources to help them recover and give prosecutors more
tools to address sex trafficking. Last September, I held a Senate
hearing to bring about a larger discussion on human trafficking. And I
recently traveled to Mexico, Texas, Arizona, and Minneapolis to listen
to victims, advocates, and law enforcement. What I have learned is that
we have to work together, all of us, to end trafficking.
Ending human trafficking is not an easy task, but by working together,
we can stop it in North Dakota and around the globe. I'll keep fighting
to end these terrible crimes and I hope you will join me.
Sincerely,
Heidi

Working

to
Stop
Human
Trafficking
Last
month,
more
than
300
young
girls
in
Nigeria
were
kidnapped
by
terrorists
threatening
to
sell
them
to
individuals
who
would
use
them
for
sex
or

We
should
all
be
outraged
by
these
atrocities.
Sadly,
the
stark
reality
is
that
these
horrible
crimes
are
also
going
on
in
our
own
backyard
in
North
Dakota,
hurting
women,
men,
and
children
in
communities
across
our
state.
Statistics
show
on
average
children
are
13
years
old
when
they
are
forced
to
become
victims
of
sex
trafficking.
Around
the
world,
it
is
estimated
that
more
than
20
million
individuals
are
trafficked
for
sex
or
labor
-
including
thousands
in
the
United
States.
North
Dakota's
law
enforcement
has
been
working
hard
to
crack
down
on
these
crimes.
But
all
of
us
need
to
do
our
part
to
raise
awareness
and
help
stop
human

Recently,
I
