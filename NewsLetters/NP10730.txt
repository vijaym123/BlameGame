Dear Friend,
It was a true delight to
present the
2014 Evangelina Menendez Trailblazer
Awards
to six inspiring New Jersey women for their leadership,
accomplishments and tireless determination in making our state a better place
to live, work and raise a family.
Im so pleased
each honoree took a moment to share her thoughts about what being a
trailblazer means, especially for our future leaders.
Check out the video below to see what they had to
say:

A special
thanks must go to United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power and Former
Ambassador Meryl Frank for their wonderful
remarks at the ceremony, as well as the enthusiastic crowd at
Saint Peters University.
Lastly, I am where I am today because my mother, Evangelina
for whom
this award is named
had a deep reservoir of quiet strength which
gave her both the wisdom and the courage to leave Cuba so that she could
provide a better life for her children in America.
She was
my
trailblazer and it is in her honor
I congratulate these six New Jersey women.
Sincerely,
Robert
Menendez
United States
Senator
