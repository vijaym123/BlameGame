Dear
Friend,
The House of Representatives made 2 serious votes this week that show
the scope of the power of the People's House.
On Wednesday,
the House voted on bipartisan terms to
hold the former IRS Director of Exempt
Organizations, Lois Lerner, in contempt of Congress
for her
refusal to cooperate with our investigations into the egregious
targeting practices at the IRS.
The next day, we voted to
form the
select
committee on Benghazi .
As a Member of the
Oversight and Government Reform Committee, I've been part of the
investigation into what happened on that September 11, 2012 in Benghazi since I
took office last January. I'm glad we've formed this committee because
we have to know what happened in Benghazi. We have to know how and why
four American lives were lost, how and why our sovereign soil in
Libya was violated, and how and why President Obama's administration has
obstructed the effort to get these answers.
Empowering a
special select committee with all the enforcement powers to get these
answers now is the right step at the right time.
The events of
this week took place because this administration continues to require
incredibly extensive oversight.
These moves were not taken
lightly. They were taken on your behalf because this Congress is serious
about making your government accountable to you, and we'll do
everything in our power to do just that.
As always, I welcome
your thoughts
on this
or any other issue.
Sincerely,
Doug
Collins
Member of Congress
