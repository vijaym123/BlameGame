Dear Friends,
Happy Good Friday!
Tour of the Midlands
Yesterday, I visited communities in the Midlands as part of this year's
46 county tour. I stopped by ABBA's Sweet Treats in Winnsboro and got
the chance to enjoy some butter pecan ice cream.
I also visited PPG Industries in Chester. The employees gave me a brief
tour of the facility.
My last stop was Philippi Baptist Church in Union, where I spoke to
members of Union County Chamber of Commerce at their annual Awards
Banquet. Congratulations to all those who were honored!
Financial Literacy Month
During the month of April, we recognize financial literacy. Financial
literacy, like education, is an important key to accessing all the
powerful opportunities our country offers. I have seen firsthand the
ripple effects on families and communities when financial literacy is
made a priority.
I encourage individuals and families to use April to
take advantage of the programs available to assess their personal
financial health and create financial goals that work for them. Too
many families are faced with crippling debt, and ensuring they have the
tools to move forward is of critical importance to both our communities
and our nation as a whole.
I would like to wish you all a Happy Easter! Spending the Easter season
with your family and loved ones is very important.
