A
victory for religious freedom
Last week, the United States Supreme Court
defeated one of the many oppressive mandates of President Obamas signature
health care law in the case of
Burwell v. Hobby
Lobby .
The
decision is a victory for religious freedom, and a check against President
Obama's imperial presidency and his repeated attempts to write his own
laws and ignore the checks and balances placed in the Constitution by
our Founding Fathers. The Court's ruling was based on the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act - a 1993 law, which passed through Congress with
overwhelming bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. The
Health and Human Services (HHS) mandate overturned by the Court would have
required owners of certain companies and businesses to choose between
violating their religious beliefs or facing severe fines by the IRS
just to comply with Obamacare. I applaud Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood
for standing up for the religious freedom rights of all Americans.
Congress must act to repeal and replace Obamacare with a law that lowers
health care costs and puts hard-working taxpayers back in charge of
their health care decisions.
More Obamacare reports
underscore the obvious
Details included in two recent Obamacare
reports once again reiterate what we have known and feared: Obamacare
remains unworkable and unaffordable. A new HHS Office of Inspector General
report shows
2.6 million unresolved
inconsistencies
in applicant data were found
when individuals enrolled in a health care plan under Obamacare. These
significant errors occurred because the Administration did not have
effective controls in place to perform basic tasks, like validating
Social Security numbers and performing accurate proof of identity checks,
when people signed up on
healthcare.gov .
In other words,
the Obama Administration didn't have the systems in place for an
information verification plan. Instead they went on the honor system to
determine certain factors, such as income and citizenship status, to
determine eligibility for Obamacare subsidies.
Another recent
report by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office concludes they
are
unable to accurately estimate how much Obamacare is going to
cost .
Obamacare is so complex and far reaching that Congress's
budgeting office has even given up on estimating its financial
impact. These two reports are further proof that the complexity of Obamacare,
combined with the Administrations politically-motivated changes to the
law, have made it unworkable for American families,
and we must replace it with a common-sense solution that
puts
patients back in charge of their health care
decisions .
It is an honor to represent you in Congress. For more information
