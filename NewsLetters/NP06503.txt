15th District Update
Dear Neighbor,
Today, our nation comes together to remember September 11, 2001. We pray for the families who lost loved ones, for the first responders who saved many lives, and for our troops who protect and fight for American liberty. We will never forget what happened on that catastrophic day.
While today is a sad reminder of what evil can do, let it also serve as reminder of what strong will and bravery can achieve.
During a time when our beloved nation was in danger, emergency responders exemplified dignity and heroism to save the lives of others. This is how America operates. Despite our differences, we have persevered and have become a stronger, wiser and more determined nation.
Although we currently face a threat to our homeland, let us remember we are one nation under God and American pride will never perish. I promise to continue to fight for a secure America.
Your Congressman,
Dennis A. Ross
