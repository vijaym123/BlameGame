Supporting the Republican
Study Committee Obamacare
Alternative
6/8/15
The Republican Study Committee, the caucus of House Conservatives, has
released the American Health Care Reform Act (AHRCA). This bill,
cosponsored by Congressman Doug Lamborn, is designed to repeal Obamacare
and replace it with free-market solutions and patient-oriented reforms
and improvements.
"Any
replacement for Obamacare needs to improve on the mess it made of the
American health care system. That's why the reforms outlined in the AHRCA
are so vitally important to the future of this nation. Why should
Americans have to settle for a bloated, failed, and convoluted system like
Obamacare when there are comprehensive replace and reform packages
available? We must pass this legislation so that we can begin to expand
access, lower costs, and return patients to a position of control over
their own health care decisions."

Key Provisions
-
Fully Repeals Obamacare.
AHCRA goes
into effect on January 1, 2016 and fully repeals the presidents health
care law.
Increases
Access to Affordable, Portable Health Insurance.
AHCRA
levels the playing field between people who receive their insurance
through their employer and those who purchase it on
the individual market by
creating a standard deduction for health insurance. Under the RSCs plan, individuals with
qualifying insurance receive a $7,500 tax deduction and families
receive a $20,500 deduction.
Expands Insurance Access for Vulnerable
Americans.
AHCRA ensures those with pre-existing conditions have
access to health insurance by expanding federal support for
state high-risk pools and expanding portability so Americans can
easily move between insurance markets without fear
of discrimination based on health status.
Spurs Competition Between Insurers . AHCRA
allows people to shop for and purchase insurance plans across state
lines, like other forms of insurance already allow. The plan also allows
small businesses to pool together to negotiate for better
rates.
Encourages
Innovation.
AHCRA establishes an eight year, $15 billion spending fund
through the National Institute of Health (NIH) to develop biomedical
breakthroughs in the five diseases that cost the most American lives
each year: heart disease, cancer, stroke, Alzheimers and
diabetes. It would also create a $1 billion prize, similar to the X Prize, for a
cure to Alzheimer's disease.
