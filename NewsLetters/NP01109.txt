Dear Friend,
A few
months ago, I heard
this story on the
radio
of a 24 year old young woman from Texas, who spent many of her
teenage years forced into prostitution by human traffickers. After she
escaped these captors, she faced an unexpected obstacle as she tried
to rebuild her life: her criminal record for crimes she was forced to
commit. Her record made it hard to find meaningful employment and was
also an impediment to getting a loan, finding housing, and pursing a
higher education.
Some states,
Like New Hampshire, allow for survivors of human trafficking to have
their records cleared of prostitution and other low-level crimes that
occurred while they were being trafficked, through a legal process known
as vacatur.
After I heard this
story, I introduced a bill in the Senate to provide incentives for all
states to pass vacatur laws so that the victims of human trafficking
can finally have justice and reclaim their lives.
Last
week, my legislation passed the Senate
as part of a
broader, bi-partisan bill to address human trafficking.
You can learn
more about this womans story and my work on this legislation
in this NPR story that just aired
on the show
All Things Considered.
Thankfully, this young woman from Texas was able to clear her record through
a vacatur process in the state of Maryland. Shes now registered to
start college this summer and has a healthy new baby boy. Its my hope,
and the goal of my legislation, that more survivors will have this
same opportunity to clear their records so that they can finally live
free of the harrowing experience of being victims of human trafficking.
Sincerely,
Jeanne
