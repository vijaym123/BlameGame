Dear Friends,
Halloween
is the spookiest night of the year. Hordes of witches, wizards, and
vampires go door-to-door in search of treats. Even princesses and
superheroes want in on the fun.
I have enjoyed many trick-or-treats with my children, and
Halloween safety is just as important to me now as it was then. Below are
some tips from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that will help you protect
your ghosts and
goblins.
Dressing Up
Choose costumes that are bright and
reflective. Parents can also add reflective tape to costumes or candy
bags to ensure greater visibility.
Buy or use only
fire-retardant materials for costumes.
Costumes should be a
tad loose so that warm clothes can be worn underneath. Make sure that
any pants or skirts are not so long that children would
trip.
Masks can obstruct a childs vision so consider using facial
makeup instead. If masks are worn, make sure the eye, nose, and mouth
openings are large enough to accommodate your
child.
Using flashlights will help children and parents better navigate the
Halloween trail.
Hitting the Candy Trail
Never let young children go trick-or-treating
alone or without adult supervision.
Do not enter
strangers homes, apartments or cars and only go to homes where a porch
light is lit.
Walk, rather than run or fly, from
house to house. Do not cross yards where unseen objects or uneven terrain
may present tripping hazards.
Stay on sidewalks, or
walk on the left side of the road facing traffic if there are no
sidewalks.
No Tricks, Just
Treats
Check all treats before your children are allowed to eat
it. If it looks spooky or suspicious, then throw it out. Same goes
with homemade treats from strangers.
Give children an
early meal before going out so that they will be less tempted to eat
unchecked treats.
Let your children enjoy the spoils of
victory, but save some candy for the following days and
weeks.
I hope this Halloween brings more treats than
tricks. Have a safe evening, and watch out for witches on low flying
brooms!
Sincerely,
Eliot L.

Halloween.
