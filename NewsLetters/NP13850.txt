WHAT MAKES YOU THANKFUL?
As we prepare to rush from place to place and store to store this year, we need to make sure we think back on the things that make us thankful. For me, that list includes my family, all my good friends, our country, and the freedoms we enjoy as Americans.
I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOUWHAT MAKES YOU THANKFUL? PLEASE SHARE YOUR STORY ON MY FACEBOOK PAGE.
This has always been one of my favorite times of year because my extended family celebrates together, and I hope you take some time to give thanks with your family and friends, too.
Please know that I stand ready to help you with any issues you may have throughout the year, so do not hesitate to contact my office in Washington D.C. at (202) 225-2015, in Hilliard at (614) 771-4968, in Lancaster at (740) 654-2654, or in Wilmington at (937) 283-7049.
