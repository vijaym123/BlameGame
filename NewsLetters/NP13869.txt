Happy Thanksgiving
When President George Washington issued his Thanksgiving proclamation in 1789 he called on all Americans to set aside the day, to the service of that great and glorious Being who is the beneficent author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be, and to give our, sincere and humble thanks for His kind care and protection.
Today we take time to continue in that tradition of giving thanks for the many blessings afforded us.
We, as Americans, must be especially grateful for the blessing of being citizens in the freest country in the world.
We should also take time not just today but everyday to give thanks and say a prayer for those who put their lives on the line in the defense of this great nation as well as for their families who wait for their safe return home.
Today I want to thank you for the great honor and privilege of representing you in Congress.
I do not take it lightly and continue working every day make our country a better place.
Sincerely,
Jack Kingston
