LEGISLATION
April 12, 2015
Dear David,
On Thursday, April 2,
2015, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and U.S. Secretary of
State John Kerry
announced a general
framework
for a final agreement on limiting Iran's nuclear program.
This framework is not final, and more negotiations are underway.
The text of the framework can be viewed
here.
Under the agreement, Iran may pursue a peaceful
nuclear program
under specified
conditions . Irans installed centrifuges will be cut by two-thirds, only
one facility will be allowed to enrich uranium, and there will be no
fissile material allowed at its Fordow plant. Inspectors from the
International Atomic Energy Agency will have access to Iran's centrifuges,
supply chain, uranium mines and any suspicious sites. In exchange, U.S.
and international sanctions will be rolled back in phases, except for
the U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran for its support of terrorism and
human rights violations. If Iran is found to be cheating on the deal,
Secretary Kerry said nuclear-related sanctions will snap back into
place.
However, many believe that this proposal will still
allow Iran to develop the capability to produce nuclear weapons. Recently,
47 Senators signed
this letter
stating that any agreement by the Obama administration requires
Congressional approval.
What action do you believe Congress should take in
response to the agreement regarding the Iranian nuclear-weapons
program? The new
agreement on the Iranian nuclear weapons program is positive and shows
progress. Congress should take no action, and the Obama administration
should proceed to finalize negotiations. I agree with the letter sent by 47 Senators
asserting that any agreement regarding the Iranian nuclear weapons program
requires Congressional approval. Congress should approve S. 615, the Iran Nuclear
Agreement Act of 2015, which would require the President to submit the
text of the final agreement and certify its efficiency, and direct Sec.
Kerry to assess its adequacy. Congress should wait until the text of the final
negotiation is released before taking any action.
