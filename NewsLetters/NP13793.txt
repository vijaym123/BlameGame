News from Representative Richard Nugent
Dear Friends,
This week was the second to last week of the legislative year. And
since Congress doesn't do anything until the very last minute, that
means it was a very quiet week. On Tuesday, however, a mad scramble to
finish up the nation's business is likely to begin. The Farm Bill
remains outstanding, as does the National Defense Authorization and
some other fairly large ticket items.
For the life of me, I will never understand why this place decides to
do these things the way they do. We've had all year to move the ball
forward. The House finished the Defense authorization months ago.
Nevertheless, here we are. And we won't know until next week what is
going to get done and when.
In any case, the other major item left unresolved is the budget. For
the last couple of months, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan
and his Senate counterpart, Sen. Patty Murray, have been in conference
together trying to come up with a common budget document that both
chambers could pass. That's the way the process is normally supposed to
work.
Once a common budget resolution is agreed to, then the appropriations
committees have their top-line numbers that they can work within. Then
both the House and Senate pass twelve appropriations bills along with
their corresponding authorization bills and the American people can
rest easy knowing that their elected representatives have gone through
the nation's finances line-by-line to make good, informed decisions.
As of right now (well past the deadline), the two budget chairs are
reportedly getting close to reaching an agreement on the overall
top-line number. Never mind reaching agreement on how to get there.
In other words, there is still a very long way to go.
For my part, I am once again sure that the only way to restore fiscal
sanity to this place is to pass a Balanced Budget Amendment to the
Constitution. One of my proudest moments during my time in Congress was
when I was asked to bring the Balanced Budget Amendment to the floor
and to lead the debate on behalf of Republicans. I knew passing it
would obviously be a tall order, but I was extremely disheartened to
see a number of my colleagues who had previously voted in support of
such an amendment change their minds and vote no.
For as long as I am up here, I will continue pushing for a BBA. When
the United States Senate goes four years without passing a budget and
two years without a single one of the twelve appropriations bills - all
the while running trillion dollar deficits - you have to wonder if a
little extra discipline isn't in order. It took us passing a "No Budget
No Pay" bill to force the Senate into even adopting a budget in the
first place. I have a lot of faith in our system of government, but
sometimes it takes a little extra push to get the people who run that
government to do the right thing.
In any case, those are just my opinions. I'm always interested to hear
where you stand. And as things start to speed up next week, I'll make
sure you all are kept up to date. Thanks, as always, and have a great
weekend.
Sincerely,
Rich Nugent
Member of Congress

News
from
Representative
Richard
Nugent
Dear
Friends,
This
week
was
the
second
to
last
week
of
the
legislative
year.
And
since
Congress
doesn&#8217;t
do
anything
until
the
very
last
minute,
that
means
it
was
a
very
quiet
week.
On
Tuesday,
however,
a
mad
scramble
to
finish
up
the
nation&#8217;s
business
is
likely
to
begin.
The
Farm
Bill
remains
outstanding,
as
does
the
National
Defense
Authorization
and
some
other
fairly
large
ticket
items.
For
the
life
of
me,
I
will
never
understand
why
this
place
decides
to
do
these
things
the
way
they
do.
We&#8217;ve
had
all
year
to
move
the
ball
forward.
The
House
finished
the
Defense
authorization
months
ago&#8230;
Nevertheless,
here
we
are.
And
we
won&#8217;t
know
until
next
week
what
is
going
to
get
done
and
when.
In
any
case,
the
other
major
item
left
unresolved
is
the
budget.
For
the
last
couple
of
months,
House
Budget
Committee
Chairman
Paul
Ryan
and
his
Senate
counterpart,
Sen.
Patty
Murray,
have
been
in
conference
together
trying
to
come
up
with
a
common
budget
document
that
both
chambers
could
pass.
That&#8217;s
the
way
the
process
is
normally
supposed
to
work.
Once
a
common
budget
resolution
is
agreed
to,
then
the
appropriations
committees
have
their
top-line
numbers
that
they
can
work
within.
Then
both
the
House
and
Senate
pass
twelve
appropriations
bills
along
with
their
corresponding
authorization
bills
and
the
American
people
can
rest
easy
knowing
that
their
elected
representatives
have
gone
through
the
nation&#8217;s
finances
line-by-line
to
make
good,
informed
decisions.
As
of
right
now
(well
past
the
deadline),
the
two
budget
chairs
are
reportedly
getting
close
to
reaching
an
agreement
on
the
overall
top-line
number.
Never
mind
reaching
agreement
on
how
to
get
there.
In
other
words,
there
is
still
a
very
long
way
to
go.
For
my
part,
I
am
once
again
sure
that
the
only
way
to
restore
fiscal
sanity
to
this
place
is
to
pass
a
Balanced
Budget
Amendment
to
the
Constitution.
One
of
my
proudest
moments
during
my
time
in
Congress
was
when
I
was
asked
to
bring
the
Balanced
Budget
Amendment
to
the
floor
and
to
lead
the
debate
on
behalf
of
Republicans.
I
knew
passing
it
would
obviously
be
a
tall
order,
but
I
was
extremely
disheartened
to
see
a
number
of
my
colleagues
who
had
previously
voted
in
support
of
such
an
amendment
change
their
minds
and
vote
no.
For
as
long
as
I
am
up
here,
I
will
continue
pushing
for
a
BBA.
When
the
United
States
Senate
goes
four
years
without
passing
a
budget
and
two
years
without
a
single
one
of
the
twelve
appropriations
bills
&#8211;
all
the
while
running
trillion
dollar
deficits
&#8211;
you
have
to
wonder
if
a
little
extra
discipline
isn&#8217;t
in
order.
It
took
us
passing
a
"No
Budget
No
Pay"
bill
to
force
the
Senate
into
even
adopting
a
budget
in
the
first
place.
I
have
a
lot
of
faith
in
our
system
of
government,
but
sometimes
it
takes
a
little
extra
push
to
get
the
people
who
run
that
government
to
do
the
right
thing.
In
any
case,
those
are
just
my
opinions.
I&#8217;m
always
interested
to
hear
where
you
stand.
And
as
things
start
to
speed
up
next
week,
I&#8217;ll
make
sure
you
all
are
kept
up
to
date.
Thanks,
as
always,
and
have
a
great
weekend.
Sincerely, Rich
Nugent Member
of
Congress
