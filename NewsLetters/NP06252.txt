Dear Friends,
South Florida has been transfixed on the concerning news coming out
of the Middle East. Recently, I held a hearing of the Subcommittee on
the Middle East and North Africa, which I chair, in order to see how
we can destroy terrorist groups ISIL, al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, Hamas and
many others. These are all some of the most dangerous terrorist
organizations out there today. Though they all have their differences
different ideologies and different objectives
what they do have in common
is that they all need resources.
Turkey is known to be harboring several of
Hamas top operatives. Harboring these terrorists isnt where Turkey
stops
it provides financial, material, and political support for
this U.S. designated foreign terrorist organization, and has been doing
so for years, without repercussions.
Turkey isnt the only U.S.
ally, or at least U.S. partner that has been known to harbor Hamas
leadership and provide the terrorist group with funds. Qatar
the very same
country that the administration entrusted to monitor the Taliban 5,
who were swapped for Sergeant Bergdahl
has been known to be perhaps
Hamas largest financial patron.
Qatar also funds
Hamas salaries in Gaza, as well as its projects, building terror tunnels
from which to attack Israel rather than building up Gaza for the
Palestinian people.
The
Administration has not done nearly enough to curb Qatari support for terror. We
cannot continue to allow Qatari funds to go to terrorist groups
Hamas, or any other
unabated and
unaddressed.
We are currently in the open-ended ceasefire agreement between
Israel and Hamas. In the previous two months, Hamas terrorists fired over
4,500 rockets indiscriminately into Israel, including its most
populated areas, such as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.
Last month, Hamas admitted responsibility in the heinous crime of
kidnapping and murdering 3 Israeli teens. It is important to note where
this admission took place, and by whom. The announcement was made by a
known terrorist and Hamas operative in Turkey
where he lives
openly.
Our
nation is threatened by the financing of terrorist organizations that
can do us harm. We cannot allow this support for terrorism to continue
we must cut off the funds going to Hamas and other terror groups.
Only then can we begin to take down those terrorist groups and counter
their radical ideologies. It all starts with the ideology, but like a
flame without air, these radical ideologies without money and support
will die out.
Sincerely,
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
Member of
Congress
