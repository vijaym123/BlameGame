Expanding Private Sector Medical Care and Increasing Accountability For Our
Veterans
6/10/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn
cosponsored and voted for H.R. 4810, the Veterans Access to Care Act.
This bill incorporates the Congressman's call for expanding fee-basis,
private sector care for our brave veterans who are not currently
receiving the coverage they need from the VA. It passed the House by a
unanimous vote.
Also, last
night, Congressman Lamborn voted for H.R. 2072, the Demanding
Accountability for Veterans Act. It Requires the Secretary: (1) within 15 days
after such notification, to submit to the Inspector General a list of
the names of each responsible VA manager and the matter for which the
manager is responsible; (2) within 7 days after such submission, to
notify each such manager of the covered issue; (3) to direct such manager
to resolve the issue, (4) to provide the manager with appropriate
counseling and a mitigation plan for resolving the issue; and (5) to
ensure that a manager's performance review includes an evaluation of
actions taken with respect to such issue. Additionally, the legislation
prohibits the Secretary from paying a bonus or award to any manager whose
issue remains unresolved.

4810
"Mr. Speaker, I
rise today in support of H.R. 4810, the Veterans Access to Care Act.
Recent reports from within the VA have confirmed that the
manipulation of scheduling data and unacceptable wait times first highlighted
in Phoenix are systemic throughout the VA system. These findings
prompted me to author a letter last week that was signed by 35 of my
colleagues, urging Acting Secretary of the VA Gibson to expand the use of
fee-based care in order to clear the current backlog and address any
capacity
shortfalls."
"H.R. 4810 takes the next steps in addressing
those shortfalls by mandating that the VA expand access to fee-based
care and defines the parameters under which this care will be
administered.
In order to ensure this timely delivery of quality care
remains, H.R. 4810 also requires the VA to have an independent assessment
conducted on the Veterans Health Administration to evaluate the
departments performance and provide recommendations for
improvement."
"I fully support H.R. 4810 and ask that my colleagues support
this important piece of legislation as well."
