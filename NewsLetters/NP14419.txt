Dear David,
Today we celebrate Veterans Day, the Federal holiday on which we honor
and thank all military veterans.
The history of Veterans Day can be
traced back to the early part of the twentieth century.
In 1919,
President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed November 11th to be Armistice Day,
in recognition of the ceasefire between allied forces and Germany in
World War I that occurred one year earlier.
In the following years, November 11th continued to be recognized as an
important date in history and in 1926, Congress asked President
Coolidge to again proclaim November 11th as Armistice Day.
In 1938,
Armistice Day became an official holiday through an act of Congress-with
the primary purpose of honoring World War I veterans.
Following the end of World War II in 1954, President Eisenhower amended
the act to honor all veterans and its name was officially changed.
Veterans Day is now observed across the country each year on November
11th.
As the proud son and grandson of veterans, and as a veteran myself,
this day is particularly meaningful for me and my family-just as it is
for so many of yours.
As a member of the Old Guard at Arlington
National Cemetery, I often saw families come to visit the graves of
their loved ones on Veterans Day to honor their lives by remembering
their service.
Particularly moving, however, were the strangers who
came to pay their respects at Arlington Cemetery on Veterans Day.
It
was clear that, though they lacked a personal connection to the
soldiers, they wanted to honor the service and commitment of all our
veterans.
America's veterans have many different types of service, but each has
made an invaluable contribution to our lives.
This Veterans Day let us
each take a moment to remember and honor our brave veterans and to
thank them for their service.
As we pause, let us be reminded of their
courage, sacrifice, and commitment to our great country.
And may we
always remember the important cause for which they serve.
Sincerely,

Dear
David,
Today
we
celebrate
Veterans
Day,
the
Federal
holiday
on
which
we
honor
and
thank
all
military
veterans.
The
history
of
Veterans
Day
can
be
traced
back
to
the
early
part
of
the
twentieth
century.
In
1919,
President
Woodrow
Wilson
proclaimed
November
11th
to
be
Armistice
Day,
in
recognition
of
the
ceasefire
between
allied
forces
and
Germany
in
World
War
I
that
occurred
one
year
earlier.
In
the
following
years,
November
11th
continued
to
be
recognized
as
an
important
date
in
history
and
in
1926,
Congress
asked
President
Coolidge
to
again
proclaim
November
11th
as
Armistice
Day.
In
1938,
Armistice
Day
became
an
official
holiday
through
an
act
of
Congress&#8212;with
the
primary
purpose
of
honoring
World
War
I
veterans.
Following
the
end
of
World
War
II
in
1954,
President
Eisenhower
amended
the
act
to
honor
all
veterans
and
its
name
was
officially
changed.
Veterans
Day
is
now
observed
across
the
country
each
year
on
November
11th.
As
the
proud
son
and
grandson
of
veterans,
and
as
a
veteran
myself,
this
day
is
particularly
meaningful
for
me
and
my
family&#8212;just
as
it
is
for
so
many
of
yours.
As
a
member
of
the
Old
Guard
at
Arlington
National
Cemetery,
I
often
saw
families
come
to
visit
the
graves
of
their
loved
ones
on
Veterans
Day
to
honor
their
lives
by
remembering
their
service.
Particularly
moving,
however,
were
the
strangers
who
came
to
pay
their
respects
at
Arlington
Cemetery
on
Veterans
Day.
It
was
clear
that,
though
they
lacked
a
personal
connection
to
the
soldiers,
they
wanted
to
honor
the
service
and
commitment
of
all
our
veterans.
America&#8217;s
veterans
have
many
different
types
of
service,
but
each
has
made
an
invaluable
contribution
to
our
lives.
This
Veterans
Day
let
us
each
take
a
moment
to
remember
and
honor
our
brave
veterans
and
to
thank
them
for
their
service.
As
we
pause,
let
us
be
reminded
of
their
courage,
sacrifice,
and
commitment
to
our
great
country.
And
may
we
always
remember
the
important
cause
for
which
they
serve.
