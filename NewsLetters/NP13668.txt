Congressman
Steve Stockman
Representing the
36th District
December 12, 2013
Dear patriot,
I will be voting no on this
terrible budget deal . It explodes the spending caps, balloons the
deficit and betrays conservatives and the
Constitution.
Here in the House the only tool at our disposal is our vote.
It
is up to the Senate to stop this .
Conservative
senators must use every unique legislative tool the Senate allows to block
this bill.
Americans will be watching to see which senators lead by
fighting to block this vote, and who follows the D.C. establishment
by voting no, but it allowing the deal to move
forward .
This deal is absolutely not an incremental step to lower
spending. It increases spending.
And it makes Obamas exploding
deficits and budgets the official policy of the Republican Party.
We
will be watching to see which senators use the Senates rule to block
this bill.
Please contact your senators and member of
the House at 202-225-3121 to tell them what you
think.
Warmest wishes,
Congressman Steve Stockman
P.S.
I will
be voting against the proposed federal budget deal .
It
endorses rising spending and deficits, and makes them permanent by making
them Republican Party policy.
Here in the House we can
vote no, but senators have many legislative tools at their disposal
to block a vote .
It is up to the Senate to stop this .
Americans will be watching to see which senators lead, and who follows the
D.C. establishment by allowing a vote.
What do you
think?
You may contact your senators and House member at 202-225-3121
to let them know.
