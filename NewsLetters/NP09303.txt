MEMORIAL
DAY
On
Monday, we observe Memorial Day to honor the great American heroes who
made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our freedoms.
We owe no
greater debt than to these brave men and women in uniform who put
themselves in harms way to defend liberty.
I have the utmost
admiration and respect for our veterans, and I am forever grateful for their
unwavering heroism.
In
observance of the holiday and in remembrance of our fallen heroes, Ill
be giving the keynote speech at the American Legion Post 25 Memorial
Day Program in Gravette.
I hope you will join
us.

WEEK IN
REVIEW
On Tuesday, the House passed five bills to
address human trafficking: the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act
( H.R. 3530 ), the Stop Exploitation Through
Trafficking Act ( H.R. 3610 ), the Stop Advertising
Victims of Exploitation (SAVE) Act of 2014 ( H.R. 4225 ),
the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Improving Opportunities for Youth
in Foster Care Act ( H.R. 4058 ), and the
International Megan's Law to Prevent Demand for Child Sex Trafficking ( H.R. 4573 ).
In
addition, the House and Senate came together on a final conference report
for
H.R. 3080 , the Water Resources Reform and
Development Act (WRRDA) of 2014, and it passed the House by a vote of
412-4.
The passage of WRRDA clears the way for critical projects
that address the maintenance backlogs and modernization delays that have
plagued MKARNS for far too long and have put at risk the systems
ability to remain open for business.
And it does so in a fiscally
responsible way that contains no earmarks, saves taxpayer dollars, and
increases accountability and efficiency.
I am proud to have
supported it.
On Wednesday, I
introduced the Jumpstarting Occupational-learning and
Entrepreneurialism (JOE) Act, which exempts school-based enterprises
like House of
Grounds in Harrison, Arkansas
from new school-nutrition requirements
that will effectively run them out of business by significantly
limiting the hours of operation and the types of food and beverage they can
sell.
The JOE Act ensures that schools across the country can
continue to provide their students with practical, real-world experience
in these hands-on learning laboratories.
Arkansas job creators have told me repeatedly that
the cost of excessive and burdensome regulations coming out of
Washington means fewer jobs and reduced salaries back home.
Mandates
and red tape are making life more difficult for everyone, from our
health providers to individual taxpayers trying to file returns.
But
the impact of the ever-increasing regulatory burden doesnt stop
there.
Now, its targeting the kids running House of Grounds and
students all over America who are trying to equip themselves with skills
to become the entrepreneurs of tomorrow.

Also on
Wednesday, the House passed
H.R. 4031 ,
the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Management Accountability Act of
2014, by a vote of 390-33.
H.R. 4031 authorizes the secretary of
the VA to address the severe mismanagement and lack of accountability
at the Department of Veterans Affairs by removing senior executives
whose performance warrants it.
Currently, a performance-based
removal of these senior executives is a cumbersome, multi-step
process.
H.R. 4031 enables the secretary to remove them in the same manner
as a professional staff member of a member of Congress.
Within
thirty days of removing the individual, the secretary must notify the
House and Senate Committees on Veterans Affairs of the removal and the
reason for it.
I am proud to have voted in favor of
H.R. 4301 and to have cosponsored this bill.
The information
that has come to light about the treatment of veterans in Phoenix and at
several VA hospitals across the nation is minimally a breach of
competence and is, perhaps, criminal.
We need the truth, and I urge VA
leadership to get to the bottom of this as soon as possible and hold
accountable those who selfishly denied our veterans the health care
they earned.
Our nation owes no greater debt of gratitude than the
one we owe them.
On Thursday,
in addition to passing the USA FREEDOM Act ( H.R.
3361 ), the House passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)
for FY 2015 ( H.R. 4435 ) by a vote of
325-98.
In a time when bipartisanship and progress in Congress seem extinct,
passage of the NDAA is an example of Republicans and Democrats alike
coming together to do what is best for our troops and our national
security.
I applaud the passage of this necessary legislation,
which sets our military policies, provides guidance and certainty to our
troops throughout fiscal year 2015, and contains important provisions
that reject some of President Obamas military compensation cuts,
addresses critical readiness gaps, and protects the National Guards
operational capabilities.
Next
week, in addition to suspensions, the House will consider the Commerce,
Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2015
(H.R. 4660) and the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2015 (H.R. 4681).
