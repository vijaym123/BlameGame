Dear Friend,
On Monday, I had the pleasure of notifying two outstanding high school students, Matthew Salmon from Bishop Moore Catholic High School and Michael Rieker from Olympia High School, that they had been accepted into the US Air Force Academy. I am grateful for the men and women serving in our Armed Forces, and am happy to see exceptional young people from our schools following in their footsteps.

On Monday and Tuesday, I was in Polk County for several events, including a round of pickleball at the Mouth Olive Shores North senior community in Polk City. A cross between tennis and ping-pong, pickleball is a popular retirement sport in Polk County, and I enjoyed joining the Mt. Olive Shores group on Tuesday for a brisk game at the beginning of a chilly morning.
Some of the other businesses I visited and events I participated in this week in Polk County included:
-	Jacks Sea Plane Base in Winter Haven
-	The Polk County Farm Bureau/Cattlemans Association Legislative Luncheon
-	Haven Building Products, who just celebrated their 100th anniversary
-	The Polk Training Center for the Handicapped
-	Langs Taste of Florida Caf in Lake Alfred, a family business since 1951
-	State Farm Operations Center in Winter Haven

On Thursday, I spent the day in South Lake County, and dropped off a toy and some gifts at the Clermont Police Department. Partnering with Chief Charles Broadway and officers in Clermont, the Christian Men in Action members are part of a nonprofit community organization that seeks to meet the needs of families, young people, and the elderly. I was happy to thank the dedicated volunteers and hear about the work that they are doing this Christmas season to benefit those less fortunate than themselves.

That evening, I joined the Jr. Womens Club of Clermont for their annual Christmas party. It was pleasure to explain some of the services that my office provides and how we can assist people who are having difficulties with a federal agency. The Jr. Womens Club is involved in numerous areas of service, and I was honored to recognize their work and thank them for the support and benefit they provide to the community.
While I was in Clermont, I also visited:
-	Centennial Bank
-	Buffalo Wild Wings
-	The South Lake Tablet
-	Medical Neurological Center
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Earlier this year, our office was contacted regarding some medals that a constituent believed he should have received for his service during World War II. After submitting his documentation and a Congressional Inquiry to the Navy Personnel Command Center, they confirmed that the veteran was eligible for several medals and subsequently mailed the appropriate ones to my office on his behalf.
This week, I had the privilege of hosting a medal presentation ceremony, recognizing Lieutenant William Sheppard in front of his family and friends for the dedicated service he has given to our country. Captain Dick Morgan officially presented each of the medals to Lieutenant Sheppard, and I was honored to give him a flag that was flown over the Capitol as a token of gratitude for his service to our county.
