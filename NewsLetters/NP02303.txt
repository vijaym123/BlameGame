Dear
Friends,
Last week, 75 Republicans pressured by our
leadership and a weak-kneed Senate joined 182 Democrats in abandoning a
provision blocking President Obamas executive actions on immigration in
the Fiscal 2015 Department of Homeland Security spending bill. Without a
doubt, Congress ceded its constitutional authority when it gave up
the fight to ensure the president faithfully executes the laws of the
United States.
Unfortunately, the outcome was predictable. In
December, I cautioned the Republican Conference that separating DHS
from the rest of the budget was a losing strategy. It is with some
amusement that I read in the press that the Republicans who voted with
leadership and the Democrats to fund DHS are the grownups in the room.
These same Republicans voted with leadership back in December for the
funding bill that led to this disastrous outcome.
These
so-called "adults" ignored my warnings and those of many of the most
conservative members of the House that we could never win a fight that put
DHS funding in jeopardy. We suggested in December that Congress pass a
two-month funding bill to give House and Senate Republicans time to
come up with a winning strategy.
Nonetheless, even when we
didn't agree with the strategy, House conservatives continued to fight
to undo the President's illegal and unconstitutional executive amnesty.
But we lost because the Democrats and the White House outsmarted
ineffective GOP leadership.
Not only did our leaders rely on
Democratic votes, they caved to Senate Democrats who refused to let the
issue be debated. They rebuffed proposals from the newly formed House
Freedom Caucus
of which I am a founding member
to temporarily
extend the DHS spending bill so the constitutional process of negotiations
between the House and Senate could resolve our
differences.
In the end, I was among 167 Republicans who voted against
leaderships capitulation. I did so because I took an oath to uphold the
Constitution of the United States.
Our great country was founded
on the principle that we need a government strong enough to protect our
God-given rights but not so powerful as to encroach on individual
liberties. At the heart of the genius of the Constitution are the checks
and balances inherent in our three branches of
government.
Article I, Section 1 is not open to interpretation: All legislative
Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United
States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of
Representatives.
Presidents are charged with executing the law, not making it.
Yet President Obamas executive actions put 5 million people who came
to the U.S. illegally ahead of those who play by the rules
a
unilateral usurpation of congressional power.
Make no mistake; this
fight is not about differences over immigration policy, its about
protecting the constitutional prerogative of Congress to make law.
Instead of standing up for the separation of powers and the rule of law,
the House voted to cede its constitutional authority.
I fear
this loss of nerve will embolden this president and future presidents
of both parties to use executive action when they cant get what they
want from Congress.
Cant persuade Congress to enact more
environmental restrictions? Issue an executive order. Dont like the
capital gains tax? Quit collecting it. Sooner or later, every member of
Congress, regardless of ideology or party, will live to regret this
Congress' failure to stop President Obama's executive
actions.
Despite this grave setback, the battle is not over. I promise to
continue fighting for you.
