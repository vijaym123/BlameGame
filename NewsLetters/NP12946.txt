As we begin 2014,
millions of Americans are still asking,
Where are the
jobs?
While Florida has far outpaced the rest of the nation in job
creation over the last three years, thousands of Floridians are still looking
for well-paying, full-time work. Unfortunately, all too often,
Washington makes it harder for small businesses in Florida and across the
country to grow and create good, new jobs. We saw the effect of
Washingtons barriers to job creation in the January unemployment report,
which saw 347,000 Americans leave the workforce, while just 74,000 found
jobs
the worst jobs report in three
years .
My focus in Congress is on building an
environment where small businesses can expand and hire new workers. Often,
that means simply getting Washington out of the way by removing
unnecessary government barriers to economic growth and job creation. It means
expanding energy production to create jobs right away in the energy
sector, while bringing down energy costs so that small businesses and
manufacturers can hire new workers. It also means streamlining and
improving our federal job training programs, so that all Americans have the
opportunity to succeed in the 21st century workforce.
In
the House of Representatives, we have passed dozens of bills, many with
broad bipartisan support, to help create private sector jobs and
ensure workers in Florida and across the country have the knowledge and
skills to fill them. Unfortunately, most of the bills have not even
received a vote in the Senate. You can find a list of all the jobs
legislation passed by the House
here , as
well as summaries and status updates. Here is a sample of some of the
bills we have passed that Majority Leader Harry Reid refuses to bring
to the Senate floor for a vote. To learn more about a bill, or to
