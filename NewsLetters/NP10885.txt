Dear Fellow Nevadan,
The Senate will soon
consider legislation to give 28 million minimum wage workers a much-needed
raise, and our economy a much-needed boost. No American working full
time should live below the poverty line. So Democrats will push to make
the minimum wage a living wage, raising it to $10.10 per
hour.
Minimum wage workers spend their paychecks in local stores, gas
stations and restaurants. Thats why an increase in the minimum wage
will create 85,000 new jobs. This increase is the key to ensuring every
full-time worker has a shot at entering the middle
class.
Contrary to common belief, raising the minimum wage isnt just about
helping teenagers earn a little extra cash. The average minimum wage
worker is 35 years old, and earns half her familys income. The majority
of those making the minimum wage are women. And more than a quarter of
the workers that would benefit from a raise are supporting
children.
Raising the minimum wage should not be a tough call; it is
simply the right thing to do. Our country is strongest when we grow
from the middle out. So lets build a stronger middle class and a
stronger country. Lets give the middle class a raise.

In the Silver State
On
Thursday, March 20th, I joined the Clean Energy Project, CEO of the
American Wind Energy Association Tom Kiernan, Vice-President of
Communications at Solar Energy Industry Association Ken Johnson, and Governor
Brian Sandoval in releasing Nevadas latest clean energy report at the
famous Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign - which is entirely
solar-powered since this past January. The report highlights the many
successes as a result of clean energy investments in
Nevada.
On Friday, March 21st, I was proud to
join the Moapa Band of Paiutes, First Solar, and the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power for a groundbreaking event to celebrate the
start of construction of the 250 MW Moapa Southern Paiute Solar Project
in Clark County, Nevada. And I am proud that the first utility scale
solar project on tribal land is happening in Nevada. This project has
created the blueprint for Native American tribes to play an important
role in our countrys clean energy
future.
When I was home a few weeks ago I had the
pleasure of touring Community Services of Nevada, and visiting with the
Executive Director Margarita Rebollal and her staff. Community
Services of Nevada is a local bilingual, bicultural non-profit agency in
North Las Vegas that provides assistance to first time homebuyers and
foreclosure mitigation, among other
services.
I had a wonderful time meeting with the ladies of
the Las Vegas Chapter of the Links, Inc. This dynamic group of women is
committed to organizing and supporting educational, cultural, and
civic activities that enhance our community. It was a pleasure for me to
receive their award in recognition of my support to women in Southern
Nevada.
