Dear Friends,
Here is a quick note before you begin your Labor Day Weekend.
Community Office Hours
We&rsquo;ve added new cities to our
community office hours . My staff will now meet with constituents in La Mirada, South El Monte and Montebello. This is in addition to the current locations in Whittier, Pico Rivera and Norwalk.
Community office hours are an opportunity for you to get help with issues related to a federal agency. My staff can help advocate on your behalf with the Social Security Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, US Postal Service, IRS, and other government agencies.
For a list of community office locations, times, and dates, click

Internship Deadline
My office is now accepting applications for internships in my district office.
If you know a student who is interested in learning more about how a congressional office works, encourage them to apply. Deadline to submit an application is next Friday, September 12th. For more information visit my
website .
If you have any other questions, please contact my district office at (562) 860-5050.
Thank you again. I hope you have a safe and happy Labor Day Weekend.
Best,
Linda T. S&aacute;nchez
Member of Congress
