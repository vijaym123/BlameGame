I&rsquo;d like to share with you some of what I&rsquo;ve been working on in Washington and Tennessee this fall:
Standing up for Tennessee&rsquo;s three ROTC programs
On Nov. 6, I announced that the U.S. Army agreed not to close three Reserve Officers&rsquo; Training Corps (ROTC) programs in Tennessee as it had previously announced, and instead will give them two years to improve to meet the Army&rsquo;s current needs. We&rsquo;re proud of these programs &mdash; they&rsquo;ve produced some of our nation&rsquo;s outstanding military leaders. That makes the Army&rsquo;s announcement a major victory for East Tennessee State University, Tennessee Technology University and University of Tennessee Martin, and I applaud Congressmen Roe, Black and Fincher and Senator Corker for their leadership on this issue as well. On Nov. 8 I was in Johnson City, where I was glad to visit with students from the ROTC department at ETSU.

President Obama&rsquo;s HHS Secretary should resign
On Oct. 29 I went to the floor of the U.S. Senate and called on President Obama to relieve his Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, of her duties because of the disastrous rollout of Obamacare. Taxpayers have spent more than $400 million to create exchanges that after three-and-a-half years still don&rsquo;t work, and this is on top of Obamacare&rsquo;s rising costs and fewer choices. Secretary Sebelius is refusing to answer our questions on the exchanges and tell us what went wrong. No private sector executive would escape this kind of accountability after such a poor performance.

Holding the president accountable for his &ldquo;if you like your plan&rdquo; promise
On Nov. 5, I called on the Obama administration to put into law the president&rsquo;s promise that &ldquo;if you like your plan, you can keep it.&rdquo; During a hearing of the Senate health committee &ndash; of which I am the lead Republican &ndash; I asked Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, about that promise. Today, the White House&rsquo;s website still says: &ldquo;If you like your plan you can keep it and you don&rsquo;t have to change a thing due to the health care law,&rdquo; even though at least 5 million Americans are losing their policies starting Jan. 1, because many plans are outlawed under Obamacare. On Oct. 28, I introduced the
Exchange Information Disclosure Act , which would require the administration to provide weekly reports to Congress, the states and the public on the Obamacare exchanges.

Passing legislation to help prevent another meningitis outbreak
On Nov. 18, the U.S. Senate passed my legislation to help prevent another meningitis outbreak like the one that killed 16 Tennesseans and sickened so many others. The House passed the legislation on Sept. 28, and it will soon become law. This legislation will fix the uncertainty over who is in charge of the sort of compounding facilities that were tied to the meningitis outbreak. We need to make it clear exactly who is on the flagpole for preventing another one.

Fixing our $17.1 trillion federal debt
We need to redouble our efforts to fix the country&rsquo;s $17.1 trillion federal debt. We could start by passing the plan I&rsquo;ve introduced with Senator Corker, the
Fiscal Sustainability Act , which would reduce the growth of out-of-control entitlement spending by $1 trillion over the next 10 years. The entitlement programs driving the federal debt are unsustainable. If Congress and President Obama don&rsquo;t make tough decisions now to address out-of-control spending, young Americans will be forever known as the debt-paying generation. We will have watched America pass from the hands of the &ldquo;greatest generation&rdquo; to the &ldquo;debt-paying generation,&rdquo; with nothing to show for it but the bill.

Discussing jobs and workforce needs with the Northeast Tennessee Workforce Investment Board
On Nov. 8, I gathered with dozens of business, education and community leaders and members of the Northeast Tennessee Workforce Investment Board to talk about jobs and workforce needs. I heard from many different people about what this part of the state needs to build on its success.
Fighting to help protect Tennesseans from IRS abuses
I&rsquo;m working with U.S. Rep. Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn.) to pass the
IRS Abuse Protection Act
to require the federal government to tell taxpayers whenever the Internal Revenue Service has accessed their tax returns or other tax information. The IRS violated the First Amendment rights of the American people when it created what amounted to an enemies list of conservatives, including Tennessee Tea Party groups, to keep people quiet. This legislation, which I introduced in the U.S. Senate on Sept. 10, would require the U.S. Treasury to notify taxpayers, in writing, each time the IRS accesses their tax accounts, tax returns or other tax return information &ndash; and tell them why and how it was used. This legislation would help give taxpayers better protection to stop the IRS from violating their First Amendment constitutional rights to speak up and speak out.
