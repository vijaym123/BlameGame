Dear Friends
The August District Work period is right around the corner, and weve got a lot of events going on around the district for you during the month. This is the longest stretch of time in the year that I can spend visiting with and listening to folks in the 12th District.
From jobs fairs to grants workshops to health fairs, weve got a packed schedule, and I hope one of these events will be helpful to you.
For starters, this weekend, on Saturday, August 2 nd , Im hosting another round of Congress on the Corner town hall meetings in Jeff Davis, Appling, and Coffee Counties. These are a great chance for us to visit, and they also wrap up a series of town halls that I start in June that brought me to every single county in the district over the last two months.
If you or someone you know is interested in joining us this weekend, please visit
barrow.house.gov/congressonthecorner
for the details.
As I mentioned, I'll be hosting some great events in the district in August, so if youre interested, mark your calendars. The details for each of the following events are available at
