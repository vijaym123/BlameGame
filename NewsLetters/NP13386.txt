Merry Christmas, Friends.
Brooke,
Caroline and I want to wish you and your families a very Merry Christmas.
As we spend the holidays together with loved ones, we reflect on all
the blessings our family has received this past year, and we truly
count your friendship among them.
This year we welcomed our greatest blessing, baby Caroline into
our lives. May your stockings be as full as our hearts this
Christmas.
We are especially blessed
to have so many of America's bravest men and women serving in our
military both at home and abroad - many of whom are spending the holidays
away from their families. The sacrifices made by our soldiers are
great, and our thanks to them is deep. During the holiday season, they are
never out of our minds for the courageous job they do - and we are
ever thankful.
We also hope if you
traveled long distances to be with your family for Christmas, that you
may have safe travels returning back
home.
From the Yoder family to yours, we wish you a very Merry
Christmas.
Sincerely,
Kevin Yoder
