Dear
Friends,
I'm
proud to have joined with 415 of my House colleagues this week to pass
a fiscal year 2015 Veterans Affairs appropriations bill that provides
for our veterans . We as a nation owe our veterans a great debt
of gratitude for their service, and this important piece of
legislation provides the Veterans Affairs Department with the resources they
need to serve veterans, their spouses and their
dependents.
By providing much-needed funding to reduce the claims backlog and
strengthen crucial veterans programs, including pensions, mental health and
suicide prevention, we can ensure a more responsive VA and better
care for our nations veterans.
This bill would provide $158
billion for the Veterans Affairs Department, a 7 percent increase from
fiscal 2014:
Fully fund programs to reduce the
claims and appeals backlog, including additional funding for digital
scanning of health records, centralized mail and
overtime
Fully fund pension payments for 519,000 veterans and their
survivors
Fully fund service-connected compensation payments for an
estimated 4,569,000 veterans, survivors and
dependents
$45 billion for VA medical services, an increase of $1.4 billion more
than fiscal year 2014 funding levels. This would provide for the
treatment of 6.7 million patients in fiscal year 2015
$7.2
billion for mental health programs
$7.4 billion for
homeless veterans support
$229 million for traumatic brain
injury
$133 million for suicide
prevention
KING COAL HIGHWAY
Today I
toured the entirety of the King Coal and Tolsia highways in Southern
West Virginia, advocating for completion of this important commerce and
transportation corridor. The day included stops in Wayne, Mingo, Logan
and Mercer counties and was led by King Coal Highway Authority
Executive Director Mike Mitchem. We held a meeting in Washington in April to
discuss the future of the King Coal Highway, and he invited me to
come see the state of the current road for myself.
As a senior
member of the House Transportation &amp; Infrastructure Committee, I
will work for a robust highway bill this year that will ensure safer,
more efficient roads and infrastructure.
Thank you for reading my
weekly
e-newsletter, and as always, you can join in the conversation on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Shelley
