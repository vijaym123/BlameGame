A Weekly e-Newsletter from
Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA)
May 22, 2015
Dear Friends,
This week, the Senate debated the passage of the Trade Priorities and
Accountability Act. In Georgia, 1.2 million jobs are directly related
to international trade. Last year alone, Georgia's farmers,
manufacturers, and companies exported $39.4 billion worth of goods
around the globe. Passing responsible trade promotion legislation would
further benefit American workers and promote American jobs by setting
out clear objectives mandated by Congress that the president must
achieve in international trade agreements. Under this legislation,
Congress retains the authority to either approve the agreement, or to
determine that the agreement will not benefit the United States and to
vote it down.
Protecting National Security
The Senate also debated the reauthorization of a critical national
security program that has served as a proven intelligence tool in
fighting terrorists since it was first passed by Congress in 2001.
Protecting both national security and personal privacy are paramount
responsibilities for the U.S. Congress. The threats around the world
and even on U.S. soil are growing at an alarming rate. These strong
security measures ensure that the intelligence gaps identified by the
9/11 Commission Report would never prove to be vulnerabilities to our
national security ever again.
We need to send a clear message to ISIL and all others who intend to
harm us that we stand here to preserve and protect, and we will not let
any obstacle stop our pursuit of those who seek to destroy our freedoms.
Denver VA Hospital
As chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, I spent a lot of
time this week working on the construction and management debacle in
the VA's project to build a new hospital in Denver. To date, the VA has
failed to demonstrate any leadership or hold accountable those
responsible for the nearly $1 billion-over-budget Denver VA project
the biggest construction failure in VA history. We are caught between a
rock and a hard place.
Construction is scheduled to stop on May 24,
2015, and the cost of stopping and restarting construction could be as
high as an additional $200 million for the American taxpayer.
As of
this writing, the Senate was trying to pass a short-term extension to
allow VA to use resources it already has to keep construction crews on
the job. We expect the VA and the Obama administration to accept
responsibility for what this is
an outright financial and management
disaster of catastrophic proportions
and to return immediately to the
critical task of developing a workable plan to fully fund and complete
the Denver VA medical center.
Listening to Our Veterans
On Wednesday, the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs was joined by
the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs to hear from multiple Veteran
Service Organizations about their legislative priorities for the year.
I want to thank the Paralyzed Veterans of America, AMVETS National
Headquarters, Military Order of the Purple Heart, USA, Military
Officers Association of America, Vietnam Veterans of America, Blinded
Veterans Association, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America and NCOA
USA for testifying.
You can watch my opening statement and questions at Wednesday's hearing

Improving Medicare for Chronic Health Conditions
Last week, the Senate Committee on Finance held a hearing on improving
Medicare for senior citizens and people with disabilities who have been
diagnosed with multiple chronic conditions. The prevalence of
conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer has grown
significantly since Medicare was created in 1965, yet aspects of the
program have not been updated to reflect the importance of coordinating
medical care to help these patients stay out of the hospital. To follow
up on this hearing, I am co-chairing a bipartisan working group with
Senator Mark Warner of Virginia to explore ways to strengthen
Medicare's coverage of chronic conditions and empower health care
providers and patients to develop innovative health solutions that save
money without compromising quality.
What's on Tap?
I hope that everyone has a safe and enjoyable Memorial Day weekend.
Please take a moment this weekend to remember our brave warriors and
their families
. Our fallen soldiers were
patriotic men and women with a great sense of duty, and they made the
ultimate sacrifice in seeking to protect our liberties and freedoms. We
will never be able to repay the tremendous debt we owe to those who
proudly served our country with honor.
You can also watch me on C-SPAN's Newsmakers this Sunday, May 24,
2015, at 10:00 a.m. ET or at 6:00 p.m. ET. I'll be discussing the
importance of taking care of our country's veterans and reforming the
culture of the Department of Veterans Affairs so that tragedies like
last year's wait time scandal at the VA hospital in Phoenix never
happen again.

Dear
Friends,
This
week,
the
Senate
debated
the
passage
of
the
Trade
Priorities
and
Accountability
Act .
In
Georgia,
1.2
million
jobs
are
directly
related
to
international
trade.
Last
year
alone,
Georgia's
farmers,
manufacturers,
and
companies
exported
$39.4
billion
worth
of
goods
around
the
globe.
Passing
responsible
trade
promotion
legislation
would
further
benefit
American
workers
and
promote
American
jobs
by
setting
out
clear
objectives
mandated
by
Congress
that
the
president
must
achieve
in
international
trade
agreements.
Under
this
legislation,
Congress
retains
the
authority
to
either
approve
the
agreement,
or
to
determine
that
the
agreement
will
not
benefit
the
United
States
and
to
vote
it
down.
Protecting
National
Security
The
Senate
also
debated
the
reauthorization
of
a
critical
national
security
program
that
has
served
as
a
proven
intelligence
tool
in
fighting
terrorists
since
it
was
first
passed
by
Congress
in
2001.
Protecting
both
national
security
and
personal
privacy
are
paramount
responsibilities
for
the
U.S.
Congress.
The
threats
around
the
world
and
even
on
U.S.
soil
are
growing
at
an
alarming
rate.
These
strong
security
measures
ensure
that
the
intelligence
gaps
identified
by
the
9/11
Commission
Report
would
never
prove
to
be
vulnerabilities
to
our
national
security
ever
again.
We
need
to
send
a
clear
message
to
ISIL
and
all
others
who
intend
to
harm
us
that
we
stand
here
to
preserve
and
protect,
and
we
will
not
let
any
obstacle
stop
our
pursuit
of
those
who
seek
to
destroy
our
freedoms.
Denver
VA
Hospital
As
chairman
of
the
Senate
Veterans
Affairs
Committee,
I
spent
a
lot
of
time
this
week
working
on
the
construction
and
management
debacle
in
the
VA's
project
to
build
a
new
hospital
in
Denver.
To
date,
the
VA
has
failed
to
demonstrate
any
leadership
or
hold
accountable
those
responsible
for
the
nearly
$1
billion-over-budget
Denver
VA
project
&#150;
the
biggest
construction
failure
in
VA
history.
We
are
caught
between
a
rock
and
a
hard
place.
Construction
is
scheduled
to
stop
on
May
24,
2015, and
the
cost
of
stopping
and
restarting
construction
could
be
as
high
as
an
additional
$200
million
for
the
American
taxpayer.
As
of
this
writing,
the
Senate
was
trying
to
pass
a
short-term
extension
to
allow
VA
to
use
resources
it
already
has
to
keep
construction
crews
on
the
job.
We
expect
the
VA
and
the
Obama
administration
to
accept
responsibility
for
what
this
is
&#150;
an
outright
financial
and
management
disaster
of
catastrophic
proportions
&#150;
and
to
return
immediately
to
the
critical
task
of
developing
a
workable
plan
to
fully
fund
and
complete
the
Denver
VA
medical
center.

On
Wednesday,
the
Senate
Committee
on

was
joined
by
the
House
Committee
on
Veterans'

to
hear
from
multiple
Veteran
Service
Organizations
about
their

for
the

I
want
to

the
Paralyzed

Improving
Medicare
for
Chronic
Health
Conditions
Last
week,
the
Senate
Committee
on
Finance
held
a
hearing
on
improving
Medicare
for
senior
citizens
and
people
with
disabilities
who
have
been
diagnosed
with
multiple
chronic
conditions.
The
prevalence
of
conditions
such
as
heart
disease,
diabetes,
and
cancer
has
grown
significantly
since
Medicare
was
created
in
1965,
yet
aspects
of
the
program
have
not
been
updated
to
reflect
the
importance
of
coordinating
medical
care
to
help
these
patients
stay
out
of
the
hospital.
To
follow
up
on
this
hearing,
I
am
co-chairing
a
bipartisan
working
group
with
Senator
Mark
Warner
of
Virginia
to
explore
ways
to
strengthen
Medicare's
coverage
of
chronic
conditions
and
empower
health
care
providers
and
patients
to
develop
innovative
health
solutions
that
save
money
without
compromising
quality.
What's
on
Tap?
I
hope
that
everyone
has
a
safe

enjoyable
Memorial

weekend.
Please
take
a
moment
this
weekend
to
remember
our
brave

Our

were
patriotic
