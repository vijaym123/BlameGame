Week in Review
The last couple of weeks, the
Senate focused on passing S. 178,
the Justice for Victims of
Trafficking Act of 2015. Although
the legislation came to an impasse
due to partisan politics, I
supported the bill and even filed
my
own
amendment . The amendment
ensures Department of Homeland
Security personnel are properly
trained to prevent human
trafficking. Senate Republicans are
determined to pass this
legislation. Young children are
waiting for our help, and it is my
hope the Democratic filibuster
comes to an end.
Alongside this focus, I also
introduced various pieces of
legislation.
I led a bipartisan group of
Senators in reintroducing
legislation to help end breast
cancer by 2020. The bill creates a
clearinghouse and catalyst for
research, public-private
partnerships, and
trans-disciplinary collaboration.
Breast cancer is one of the most
pressing health concerns in this
country. My family has been touched
by breast cancer, and I know the
difficulty that comes with the
day-to-day life of patients. That
is why I am determined to help
eradicate this illness. To read
more about the bill, click

I also introduced the
Nuclear
Waste Informed Consent Act
with
Senator Harry Reid. This act
permits the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) to authorize
construction of a nuclear waste
repository only if the Secretary of
Energy has secured written consent
from the governor of the host
state, affected units of local
government, and affected Indian
tribes. No state, including Nevada,
should be forced to accept waste
against its will. With no
conceivable path to building Yucca
Mountain, its time for
Washington to admit the obvious:
the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste
Repository is a figment of the
federal governments
imagination.
The coming weeks in the Senate
will be focused on the budget. It
is my wish that the Senate can
overcome partisan gridlock and pass
a budget to fund the country. If
not, I have a simple solution: No
Budget, No Pay. This bill
requires Members of Congress to
pass a budget on time in order to
receive pay.
