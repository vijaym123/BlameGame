News from Representative Randy Neugebauer
April 21, 2014
Happy Easter: He is Risen
Dana and I hope you all had a blessed Easter weekend.
We enjoyed
celebrating by reflecting on our faith with family and friends.
I hope
your day was filled with the joy and renewal this holiday brings.
A Political Delay for Keystone
The Keystone XL pipeline
could deliver safe and affordable
energy supplies from Canada to Texas refineries, bringing in 830,000
barrels of oil a day and helping to create or support 20,000 American
jobs.
For five years, however, the Obama Administration has been
dragging its feet.
On Friday, they announced yet another delay
-conveniently, one that would take
them past the mid-term elections.
The President is in a bind here.
Multiple reports by his own Administration have concluded that the
pipeline won't increase greenhouse gas emissions
, and that it has "a degree of safety
greater than
any typically constructed domestic oil pipeline."
Keystone XL also has
widespread bipartisan
support.
It's time for the
President to stop putting unproven environmentalist claims ahead of
American jobs and safe and affordable energy for American families.
District Events
I'm looking forward to a number of chances to meet with you this week
around West Texas and the Big Country.
I'll be at Dyess Air Force Base
for a ribbon cutting ceremony for the new C130J Aircrew Training Device
. Later in the week, I'll visit the
Texas Tech Southwest Special Collections Library
to see the American Agriculture Movement Exhibit
, which
commemorates the Tractorcade
of 1979 when farmers drove their tractors to
Washington, D.C. to influence agricultural policy. I'll also meet Laura
Johnston, a kindergartner from Roscoe Wilson whose artwork is going to
be displayed in my office this year.
Additionally, I'll join the
Lubbock Chamber of Commerce
for a reception
honoring Fred Underwood's work at the Texas Department of
Transportation.
I'll be touring Rise Academy
-a charter school in Lubbock that emphasizes early immersion
learning in lower grades and college preparatory work in higher grades
to prepare their students for success.
I will also visit with some
senior citizens and celebrating Eloise Coburn's 100th birthday.
In Big
Spring, I'll help to mark the groundbreaking
for the Ports to Plains
Truck Relief Route.
The new route should help improve
safety on Route 87, and improve commerce on the Ports to Plains
corridor.
Congratulations-Your Income is Now Your Own
Today-April 21-marks Tax Freedom Day
for 2014.
We're already 111 days into the year-nearly one-third of
2014 is over.
But we've just finished paying our tax obligations as a
nation.
In 2014, we will pay a total of $4.5 trillion in federal and
state taxes, which is roughly 30% percent of our income.
It's a sad
commentary on our nation's tax policies that a third of our income is
going to fund the government.
That's why I support comprehensive tax
reform, and I'm fighting for a simple, fair tax policy for all
Americans.
Still Time to Enter in the Congressional Art Competition
For all the talented high school students in West Texas, there's still
time to enter your artwork in this year's Congressional Art
Competition.
The contest is open until this Friday, April 25th.
We've
already gotten some great pieces this year, so I can't wait to see what
else will come in this week.
In case you haven't heard, the winning
piece from each Congressional district will be displayed in the U.S.
Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. for the next year.
All Members of
Congress, staff, and Capitol visitors will see the work of West Texas'
most talented high school artist.
Please remind students to check my
website for instructions
, and to submit their entry by this
Friday.
