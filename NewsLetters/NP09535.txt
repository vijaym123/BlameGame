Congressman Lamborn and Congresswoman Sanchez Introduce
Credit Reporting Legislation for Service
Members
5/19/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn (R-CO) and Congresswoman Linda
Snchez (D-CA) introduced H.R. 4672, the Credit Reporting Act for
Military Families. The bipartisan legislation would allow credit reporting
agencies to notify deployed military service members when a negative
information alert is posted on their credit
report.
The Credit Reporting Act for Military Families
allows deployed service personnel to notify credit reporting agencies
of a military deployment. Secondly, it authorizes reporting agencies
to contact deployed service members when an adverse action is posted on
their credit report. Both actions would give creditors more context
about the circumstances under which service members accrue missed
payments.
In addition to affecting
personal finances, poor credit can also negatively impact security
clearance for military personnel. According to VeteransPlus, a non-profit
that promotes financial literacy among military families, delinquent
indebtedness is the number one reason the Department of Defense denies
or revokes security clearances for service
members.
When men and women in uniform deploy on behalf
of our country they should not be stuck worrying about their credit
rating, said Congressman Lamborn. Im pleased to have the opportunity
to work with Representative Snchez on this important bill which will
provide enhanced credit protections for service members and help
ensure that our nations heroes have the tools they need to keep their own
finances in order while serving our
country.
Our service members make tremendous sacrifices for
our country, their credit score should not be one of them, said
Congresswoman Snchez. However, too many of them face challenges when they
return home because of missed payments incurred while they were
deployed. The Credit Reporting Act for Military Families will give service
members more control over their finances and the peace of mind that
they will not encounter unforeseen problems when they are ready to
purchase a car or a home.
In
addition to affecting personal finances, poor credit can also
negatively impact security clearance for military personnel. According to
VeteransPlus, a non-profit that promotes financial literacy among
military families, delinquent indebtedness is the number one reason the
Department of Defense denies or revokes security clearances for service
members.
