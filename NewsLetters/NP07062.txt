HOW CAN I HELP?

August 15, 2014
Dear
Friends:
This week, I had the opportunity to speak at the Commonwealth Club,
Americas oldest and largest public affairs forum. I discussed how
Americas debt of $17 trillion is the biggest threat to national
security, and how it presents an even larger danger than terrorist groups like
al-Qaida or the Islamic State.
Our debt has become a
crisis: on the current scale, in the year 2020 our interest payments will
equal the amount of money we spend on defense. If we do not reduce
spending between now and 2030, all of the entitlements that we pay for
will exceed the amount of tax revenues that we take in so that everything
we do from a discretionary standpoint will have to be borrowed. Who
will pay it back? It's not our generation.
We need to have a
long-term plan to pay this debt down. Friends, if we don't stare this
problem down and fix it, our children and grandchildren are going to
be the first generation of Americans to inherit a country that is not
as great as the one we inherited.
This world is just so
complex right now; it seems like one crisis after another develops and
then the previous crisis goes to the back burner, but this is one crisis
that's not going away. I will continue to work on this important
issue, and it is my hope that by the end of this year we will have a
foundation that we can build upon to really fix this problem
head-on.
