Chicago Sun-Times: Boehner: Illinois GOP will have best year in two decades
David --
Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s
obsessed
with Illinois.
Just look what he said on Monday: "This is a real opportunity... Illinois is probably going to have the best Republican year [in 2 decades]." David, here&rsquo;s the truth:
if we don&rsquo;t give Brad everything we&rsquo;ve got between now and Election Day, Boehner&rsquo;s Illinois wish will come true.
