Amnesty is Unacceptable
Dear Friends,
Last night the President announced new executive orders on immigration that effectively grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants.
President Obama expanded his controversial Delayed Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.
This is the same program that was a catalyst for last summers humanitarian crisis when tens of thousands of children flooded the border. Another part of this latest wave of orders allows people who cross the border illegally to stay in America while they then apply for citizenship.
These new actions will only increase the flood which shows why no legislation on immigration can be considered until the border is secured.
President Obamas actions mark a massive usurpation of legislative authority.
We will leave no stone unturned as we strive to find the best tool to fight this unprecedented overreach.
As I continue to fight for the laws of our nation, please
contact me
with your thoughts and concerns on these or any other issues.
Sincerely,
Cynthia M. Lummis
