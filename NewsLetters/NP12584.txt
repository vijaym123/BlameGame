"I strongly believe this legislation would create an opportunity for
every American to find a good paying job."

Dear Friends,
This past weekend I had the honor to join my colleagues in delivering
my second Weekly Republican Address since coming to Washington, DC.
I
was joined by Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (MI-6),
Representative Gregg Harper (MS-3) and Representative Martha Roby
(AL-2) in calling on President Obama to support bills passed by House
Republicans that address key issues he discussed in the State of the
Union.
While we have many strong disagreements with the President, we focused
on bipartisan solutions where the President and Congress can work
together to address job training, smarter energy solutions, research
funding and fairer workforce practices.
Specifically, I discussed the
SKILLS Act, vital legislation that will create an opportunity for
underemployed and unemployed Americans to improve their skills and find
good paying jobs.
There are currently 4 million open jobs in this
country that need to be filled.
The SKILLS Act will help us fill these
open positions by providing more immediate access to in-demand job
training. This bill would streamline 35 overlapping workforce training
programs within the federal government into a single Workforce
Investment Fund, reducing barriers to employment opportunities.
It is
time to get Hoosiers into job training and back to work and I urge
President Obama to call on the Senate to act on this legislation. We
can't let politics get in the way of progress.
Sincerely,
Susan W. Brooks
