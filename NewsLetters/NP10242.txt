Meeting Women from around the Second District
Hi Everyone!
I hope you all had a fantastic weekend. I spent last week visiting
businesses and schools throughout the Second District. After recently
unveiling my Women's Economic Agenda in Nashua, I set off on a
listening tour to hear directly from Granite Staters. During roundtable
events in Amherst, Rindge, and Hanover last week, I discussed many
critical issues facing New Hampshire women and families, including the
wage gap between genders, the importance of a fair minimum wage, tax
relief for working families, efforts to better support women
entrepreneurs, the urgent need to invest in the education of our
children from early-childhood through college, the need for women's
comprehensive reproductive health care, and the importance of job
training and workforce development.
At the Roundtable in Rindge
Talking with Incredible New Hampshire Women
I had the opportunity to meet with groups of women in Amherst on
Tuesday, at Franklin Pierce University on Wednesday, and at the Tuck
Business School in Hanover on Thursday. Each roundtable brought
together a diverse group of female business leaders to discuss my
Women's Economic Agenda and to share their own personal experiences
with some of the issues outlined in the agenda, including pay equity,
family leave time, and access to capital.
It is astonishing that even in the 21st Century, a New Hampshire woman
continues to only make 77 cents to the dollar of her male counterpart.
During the fruitful discussions this week, we heard from inspiring New
Hampshire women business leaders about how we can bridge the gender
wage gap and address other issues I've outlined in my Women's Economic
Agenda. I sincerely thank all of the participants for sharing their
heartfelt stories and ideas with me.
At the Adult Learning Center
Discussing Retirement Security in Nashua
On Tuesday, I joined the Granite State Organizing Project and the NH
Citizens Alliance for Action to discuss retirement security issues at
the Nashua Adult Learning Center. I had a productive conversation with
the participants about the importance of standing up for Social
Security and Medicare, programs I have pledged always to protect while
in office. I will continue to work every day on behalf of Granite State
seniors and workers!
Fighting Against Drug Abuse in New Hampshire
On Wednesday, I joined 19 other Members of Congress in sending a letter
to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration urging them to take immediate
action to recognize Naloxone as a safe and effective over-the-counter
(OTC) medication to reverse an opioid overdose. As heroin abuse in New
Hampshire has reached epidemic levels, we must come together and do
everything we can to reverse it. Too many New Hampshire families have
been affected by the scourge of heroin abuse, and Naloxone could make a
real difference for families with loved ones struggling with opioid
addiction. Increasing access to this life-saving medication will have a
major impact on the fight against drug abuse.
With Terry at the Co-op
Visiting an Innovative Co-op in Hanover
On Thursday, I had a great time taking a tour and sampling some of the
fresh, local foods at the Hanover Food Co-op. The staff gave me a
thorough tutorial on how they work with the local farmers who serve the
co-op and the region, and we discussed ways I can best support
sustainable food production on the federal level. Co-op General Manager
Terry Appleby highlighted the work that regional co-ops are doing to
foster the growth of local food sources. I am the first Representative
from New Hampshire to serve on the House Agriculture Committee in 70
years and I look forward to continuing to advocate for our state's
local producers and cooperatives!
Helping Granite Staters
Earlier this year, I was contacted by a constituent named Judith
Schiavone from Nashua who needed copies of employment documents in
order to pursue benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs. My
staff worked with the Defense Finance and Accounting Service to
expedite the process and obtain a copy of the necessary records for
Judith. If my office may ever be of assistance with a problem you are
facing, please contact my staff at 603-226-1002 so we may help you
resolve your problem or get you the information you need.
Have an excellent week and thanks for everything you do to make New
Hampshire such a wonderful place to live!

Meeting

Hi

I

you
all

the

the
need

and
the
importance
of
job

development.

I
had
the

to
meet

in
Amherst
on
Tuesday,
at
Franklin
Pierce

on
Wednesday,
and
at
the

Each
roundtable
brought
together
a

to

me.

must
come

Too
many
New

by
the
scourge
of
heroin
abuse,
and Naloxone
could
make
a
real

for

Increasing

the
co-op
and
the
region,
and
we
discussed
ways
I
can
best
support
sustainable
food
production
on
the
federal
level.
Co-op
General
Manager
Terry
Appleby
highlighted
the
work
that
regional
co-ops
are
doing
to
foster
the
growth
of
local
food
sources.
I
am
the
first
Representative
from
New
Hampshire
to
serve
on
the
House
Agriculture
Committee
in
70
years
and
I
look
forward
to
continuing
to
advocate
for
our
state&#8217;s
local
producers
and
cooperatives!
