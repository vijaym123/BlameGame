In Case You Missed It
Tipton fighting for rural counties: Rep. Scott Tipton voted against
consolidated appropriations legislation in the House that excluded
funding for the Payment-in-Lieu-of-Taxes (PILT) program on which many
Western counties rely to provide essential services. PILT reimburses
local governments for losses in tax revenues due to the presence of
large expanses of un-taxable federal lands, ensuring vital funding for
infrastructure, law enforcement, education and other essential
operations. Colorado received nearly $32 million in PILT payments in
2013, with just over $21 million going to counties in the 3rd District.

to notify individuals if their personal information has been

Tipton digs into waste and politics in Administration's war on coal:
During a House Natural Resources Committee hearing on the Obama
Administration's War on Coal: The Recent Report by the Office of the
Inspector General, Congressman Scott Tipton (R-CO) raised concerns on
the cost and suspect process behind the Administration's ongoing

over five years of environmental analysis and scientific consideration
before completion. The 2008 rule had not yet even been implemented
before the new Obama Administration scrapped it, despite the five years
of environmental analysis that went into its creation. Read more

adding
a

it
will
take
priority
over
the

Things
to
Avoid:
Microsoft's
Outlook
mail
client
in
particular
has
a

will
not
render.
COMMENT:
Do
not
use
Table
"cellpadding"
or
Style
"margin-padding"
as
both

stripped
out
by

2007

2010.
COMMENT:
Avoid
tables
that
are
more
than
a
single
"page"
(22
inches
or
1500

in
height
because
they
will
leave
mysterious
horizontal
gaps
or
blank
areas
between

that
otherwise
should
be
above

below
in
relation
to
each
other.
COMMENT:
You
may
however
stack
shorter

avoid
