Ann's Weekly Roundup
Dear Friend,
In just one week, President Obama has weakened both our national and
economic security.
Once again, President Obama is bypassing congress and governing by
executive fiat.
His administration continues to wage a war on
affordable energy, hardworking American families and businesses all
across the country.
On Monday, the president issued a new rule
that would cut carbon dioxide emissions by 30% in 2030.
The
president's plan would destroy millions of jobs and cause energy prices
to skyrocket for those who can afford it the least.
In Missouri, coal is responsible for over 80% of the electricity
generated. These abundant resources allow us to keep the factory lights
on, power our homes, and keep our families warm during the cold winter
months.
However, if President Obama gets his way, Missourians would be
left in the dark.
According to the U.S. Chamber
, a rule like this would be devastating for our already
fragile economy.
Lower US GDP by $51 billion on average every year through 2030
Lead to 224,000 fewer US jobs on average every year through 2030
Force US consumers to pay $289 billion more for electricity
through 2030
Lower total disposable income for US households by $586 billion
through 2030
In order to protect hardworking Missourians, I will be cosponsoring
legislation to repeal this job-killing regulatory overreach.
National Security
Recently, President Obama released five senior Taliban detainees from
Guantanamo Bay for American Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who had been held
by the Taliban since 2009.
We should have a commitment as a country to
leave no man behind, but I believe President Obama broke the law and
put our soldiers in jeopardy.
The law requires the president to notify Congress at least 30 days
before the transfer or release of a Guantanamo detainee.
This legal
requirement is not just something the president can dismiss or that
politicians can qualify as unimportant.
The law was written to protect
Americans.
The fact that the Obama Administration knowingly broke a
national security law, passed with bipartisan support and signed by the
president, is deeply disturbing.
The exchange of five senior Taliban detainees is unacceptable and sets
a dangerous precedent. The terms of this exchange create a strong
incentive for terrorists abroad to capture American soldiers with the
belief that they will be able to negotiate with the United States of
America. This is simply unacceptable.
Once again, we are left with more questions than answers.
As a result,
I will be attending classified briefings to get to the truth regarding
this unprecedented move.
At the end of the day we must always
remember, the greatest nation on earth, the beacon of freedom, does not
negotiate with terrorists.
Protecting our veterans:
Our veterans deserve the highest level of care which they have earned
through their valor and military service.
In light of the disturbing reports about the quality of VA health care
our veterans are receiving, my office is hosting a VA Intake Day to
hear firsthand from local veterans and their families. Unless specific
problems are brought to light, we may not find all areas requiring
corrective action.
If you or someone you know would like to share personal experiences
regarding wait times, quality of care and services received by the VA
St. Louis Health Care System, please stop by the 2nd Congressional
District office and meet with my staff.
When:
Saturday, June 14, 2014
9:00am - 1:00pm
Where:
301 Sovereign Court, Suite 201
Ballwin, MO 63011

Dear
Friend,
In just
one
week,
President
Obama
has weakened
both
our
national
and
economic
security.
Once
again,
President
Obama
is
bypassing
congress
and
governing
by
executive
fiat.
His
administration continues
to wage
a
war
on
affordable
energy,
hardworking
American
families
and
businesses
all
across
the
country.
On
Monday,
the
president
issued
a
new
rule
that
would
cut
carbon
dioxide
emissions
by
30%
in
2030.
The
president&#8217;s
plan
would
destroy
millions
of
jobs
and
cause
energy
prices
to
skyrocket
for
those
who
can
afford
it
the
least.
In
Missouri,
coal
is
responsible
for
over
80%
of
the
electricity
generated.
These
abundant
resources
allow
us
to
keep
the
factory
lights
on,
power
our
homes,
and
keep
our
families
warm
during
the
cold
winter
months.
However,
if
President
Obama
gets
his
way,
Missourians
would
be
left
in
the
dark.
According
to
the
U.S.
Chamber , a rule
like
this would
be
devastating
for
our
already
fragile
economy.
&#8226;
Lower
US

by
$51

on

In

I
will

this
job-killing
regulatory
overreach.
National
Security
Recently,
President
Obama released
five
senior
Taliban
detainees
from
Guantanamo
Bay
for
American
Sergeant
Bowe
Bergdahl,
who
had
been
held
by
the
Taliban
since
2009.
We
should
have
a
commitment
as
a
country
to
leave
no
man
behind,
but
I
believe
President
Obama
broke
the
law
and
put
our soldiers
in
jeopardy.
The
law
requires
the
president
to
notify
Congress
at
least
30
days
before
the
transfer
or
release
of
a
Guantanamo
detainee.
This
legal
requirement
is
not
just
something
the
president
can
dismiss
or
that
politicians
can
qualify
as
unimportant.
The
law
was
written
to
protect
Americans.
The
fact
that
the
Obama
Administration
knowingly
broke
a
national
security
law,
passed
with
bipartisan
support
and
signed
by
the
president,
is
deeply
disturbing.
The
exchange
of
five
senior
Taliban
detainees
is
unacceptable
and
sets
a
dangerous
precedent.
The
terms
of
this
exchange
create
a
strong
incentive
for
terrorists
abroad
to
capture
American
soldiers
with
the
belief
that
they
will
be
able
to
negotiate
with
the
United
States
of
America.
This
is
simply
unacceptable.
Once
again,
we
are
left
with
more
questions
than
answers.
As
a
result,
I
will
be
attending
classified
briefings
to get
to
the
truth
regarding
this
unprecedented
move.
At
the
end
of
the
day
we
must
always
remember,
the
greatest
nation
on
earth,
the
beacon
of
freedom,
does
not
negotiate
with
terrorists.
Protecting
our
veterans:
Our
veterans
deserve
the
highest
level
of
care
which
they
have
earned
through
their
valor
and
military
service.
In
light
of
the
disturbing
reports
about
the
quality
of
VA
health
care
our
veterans
are
receiving,
my
office
is
hosting
a
VA
Intake
Day
to
hear
firsthand
from
local
veterans
and
their
families.
Unless
specific
problems
are
brought
to
light,
we
may
not
find
all
areas
requiring
corrective
action.
If
you
or
someone
you
know
would
like
to
share
personal
experiences
regarding
wait
times,
quality
of
care
and
services
received
by
the
VA
St.
Louis
Health
Care
System,
please
stop
by
the
2nd
Congressional
District
office
and
meet
with
my
staff.
