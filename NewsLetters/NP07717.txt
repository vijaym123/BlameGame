Are you a victim of
government?
Sen. Johnson strongly believes that the root cause of
America's social and economic problems lies in the excessive laws,
rules, and regulations that constitute the government's intrusion in our
lives. If you have had, or are currently having, issues dealing with
the federal agencies that mandate these restrictions, we would like to
hear your story and work with you to resolve the issues. Share your
story with Ron's professional staff by emailing us at
VictimsofGovernment@ronjohnson.senate.gov .
