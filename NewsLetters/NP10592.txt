OUR DISTRICT
Dear Friend,
I wanted to take a moment to provide you an update on my work in Washington and in the district over the last several weeks. As always, if I can be of any help to you, do not hesitate to call my office at (513) 684-2723 or (202) 225-2216.
I hope that you and your family have a blessed and happy Easter.
Sincerely,
Steve Chabot
Budgets and Spending
Last week, the House considered a number of different budgets, each of which represents a distinct vision for our government and nation. Personally, I think growing our economy, creating jobs, and reducing our debt should be our first priorities. Two of my legislative initiatives to reduce wasteful spending were included in the Republican Study Committee's budget.
Read more about the different budgets offered
HERE
and watch my speech on both initiatives below.
Congressional Art Competition
This week, I spoke with dozens of talented youth from southwest Ohio, who submitted pieces of art for the 2014 Congressional Art Competition. The first place finisher's piece will hang in the Capitol Building for the next year. See the finalists
HERE!
Constituent Meetings
Since the House was not in session this week, I spent my time working from my district office and meeting with constituents. I also had the opportunity to formally congratulate Jake Barnhorst on being offered an appointment to the U.S. Air Force Academy. If you would like to
schedule a meeting
to discuss a federal issue or if you are interested in more information about
applying for an U.S. service academy nomination , please visit my
