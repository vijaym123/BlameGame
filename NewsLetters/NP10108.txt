Dear
Fellow Nevadan,
I am pleased to join parents and children in
Nevada and across the nation to celebrate the Da de los Nios. I am
proud to be an original cosponsor of the Dia de los Nios resolution,
which was approved by the Senate yesterday. This day highlights the
importance of receiving a good education, and honors the future leaders of
this great nation. Latino children account for thirty-three percent of
all children under the age of five in Nevada and twenty-five percent
in the United States. If we fail to invest in them today, many of these
children may not reach their full potential. As a consequence, our
nation will also fail to reach its full potential. As a grandfather and
father, I know the importance of a healthy childhood for our nations
future.
I have fought to reauthorize and improve the
Childrens Health Insurance Program
and secured millions in
funding for essential programs in Nevadas K-12 schools. I am a strong
supporter and an original co-sponsor of the DREAM Act, and led a
bipartisan, commonsense immigration reform bill through the Senate. However, we
still have a lot more to do. Every day that the Republican-led House
of Representatives refuses to act on immigration reform, more children
are separated from their parents. Our country does not benefit from
this, and it does not reflect our values as a nation. I will continue
to fight until all our children have a shot at a good future with their
parents by their sides.
