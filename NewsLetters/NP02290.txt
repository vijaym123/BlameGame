County Rights and Wyomings Expertise
Dear Friends,
Last week at a Natural Resources Committee hearing I spoke with Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell about a new BLM planning process called Planning 2.0.
One of my concerns is that even though Planning 2.0 is already being used in Colorado, Wyomings county commissioners were not informed of the new process and found out about it only this past week while at a convention in Washington, D.C.
It is crucial that county commissioners be informed of all new procedures and processes since it is their job and their statutory right to represent local interests in federal land management decisions within their respective counties.
Our county commissioners understand their rights in federal planning processes.
They know their rights so well that federal employees are flown out to Wyoming to be educated on county rights as applied to federal rules and management policies.
This is just one part of Wyomings expertise in countys rights.
Please let me know your
thoughts and concerns
on these and other issues.
Sincerely,
