Friends,
I wanted to give you an update on the work I've been doing in Central
New York and in Washington over the past few weeks.
Last week during the district work period, I was pleased to hold my
public "Strengthening the Middle Class" town hall meeting at Cayuga
Community College in Auburn. During the town hall, I took questions
from audience members about a wide range of issues and discussed the
work I've been doing to create jobs, improve the economy, and grow the
middle class in Central New York. It was a productive conversation, and
I am thankful to everyone who attended and participated.

Last week I also hosted an Arts and Humanities Grants Workshop to help
local organizations secure grants from the National Endowment of the
Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to
support local arts programming and jobs. The event had great turnout
with more than 70 people in attendance. This workshop was an
opportunity for representatives of arts and cultural organizations,
institutes of higher education, radio and television makers, and other
non-profits to meet directly with representatives from the NEA and NEH.
Arts and Humanities Grants Workshop
Since taking office, I have been committed to helping local
organizations secure federal funding to support their work across
Central New York. In addition to last week's grants workshop, I've held
numerous workshops to provide local first responders and law
enforcement agencies with information and guidance on applying for and
winning federal grants. Most recently, I announced that the Greater
Baldwinsville Ambulance Corps. has been awarded $57,600 and the
Fayetteville Fire Department has been awarded $212,268 in Assistance to
Firefighters Grant (AFG) funding that I strongly advocated for. These
grants will ensure that firefighters and first responders have the
equipment they need to do their jobs safely and effectively while
responding to emergencies in our community.
Delivering high-quality constituent services is one of my top
priorities, and I am particularly proud to share with you the news that
my office has returned more than $3 million in federal benefits that
people across Central New York have earned and deserve, from Social
Security checks to disability claims and veterans' benefits. Since
taking office in January 2013, I have advocated for over 1,700
constituents with casework issues and my office has closed more than
1,220 cases to date. Of the $3 million returned to Central New Yorkers,
over $2,760,000 were benefits for veterans and seniors.
In Washington this week, the House will take a vote on the National
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). As part of the NDAA, I proposed an
amendment that passed with unanimous support calling on the Department
of Defense to continue work on a vaccine for Eastern Equine
Encephalitis (EEE) and outline how to make the vaccine available to the
public.
EEE has had a devastating effect on our communities in Central
New York, and we must do everything we can to prevent this deadly
disease from taking more lives. Most recently, a young girl from Oswego
County died in 2011 after being infected by a mosquito carrying the EEE
virus. The Department of Defense has a vaccine for EEE, but it is
deeply troubling that this vaccine is not available to the public even
in the event of an emergency.
My amendment highlights the need for a vaccine to treat the potentially
fatal EEE Virus that has claimed lives in Central New York.
I am
hopeful my House colleagues will work together in a bipartisan way to
pass the NDAA into law so we can move toward getting this important
local provision signed into law. You can read more about my EEE
amendment in the Post-Standard story here
.
As always, I encourage you to contact my office to share your thoughts
and concerns. It is an honor to represent you in the U.S. House of
Representatives.
Sincerely,
Member of Congress

Arts
and
Humanities
Grants
Workshop
Since
taking
office,
I
have
been
committed
to
helping
local
organizations
secure
federal
funding
to
support
their
work
across
Central
New
York.
In
addition
to
last
week&#8217;s
grants
workshop,
I&#8217;ve
held
numerous
workshops
to
provide
local
first
responders
and
law
enforcement
agencies
with
information
and
guidance
on
applying
for
and
winning
federal
grants.
Most
recently,
I
announced
that
the
Greater
Baldwinsville
Ambulance
Corps.
has
been
awarded
$57,600
and
the
Fayetteville
Fire
Department
has
been
awarded
$212,268
in
Assistance
to
Firefighters
Grant
(AFG)
funding
that
I
strongly
advocated
for.
These
grants
will
ensure
that
firefighters
and
first
responders
have
the
equipment
they
need
to
do
their
jobs
safely
and
effectively
while
responding
to
emergencies
in
our
community.
Delivering
high-quality
constituent
services
is
one
of
my
top
priorities,
and
I
am
particularly
proud
to
share
with
you
the
news
that
my
office
has
returned
more
than
$3
million
in
federal
benefits
that
people
across
Central
New
York
have
earned
and
deserve,
from
Social
Security
checks
to
disability
claims
and
veterans&#8217;
benefits.
Since
taking
office
in
January
2013,
I
have
advocated
for
over
1,700
constituents
with
casework
issues
and
my
office
has
closed
more
than
1,220
cases
to
date.
Of
the
$3
million
returned
to
Central
New
Yorkers,
over
$2,760,000
were
benefits
for
veterans
and
seniors.
In
Washington
this
week,
the
House
will
take
a
vote
on
the
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
(NDAA).
As
part
of
the
NDAA,
I
proposed
an
amendment
that
passed
with
unanimous
support
calling
on
the
Department
of
Defense
to
continue
work
on
a
vaccine
for
Eastern
Equine
Encephalitis
(EEE)
and
outline
how
to
make
the
vaccine
available
to
the
public.
EEE
has
had
a
devastating
effect
on
our
communities
in
Central
New
York,
and
we
must
do
everything
we
can
to
prevent
this
deadly
disease
from
taking
more
lives.
Most
recently,
a
young
girl
from
Oswego
County
died
in
2011
after
being
infected
by
a
mosquito
carrying
the
EEE
virus.
The
Department
of
Defense
has
a
vaccine
for
EEE,
but
it
is
deeply
troubling
that
this
vaccine
is
not
available
to
the
public
even
in
the
event
of
an
emergency.
My
amendment
highlights
the
need
for
a
vaccine
to
treat
the
potentially
fatal
EEE
Virus
that
has
claimed
lives
in
Central
New
York.
I
am
hopeful
my
House
colleagues
will
work
together
in
a
bipartisan
way
to
pass
the
NDAA
into
law
so
we
can
move
toward
getting
this
important
local
provision
signed
into
law.

my
EEE
amendment

As
always,
I
encourage
you
to
contact
my
office
to
share
your
thoughts
and
concerns.
It
is
an
honor
to
represent
you
in
the
U.S.

Representatives.
