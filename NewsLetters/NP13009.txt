One of the demands of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s March on Washington was for a minimum wage that would provide every American with a decent standard of living.
But here we are 51 years after his famous &ldquo;I Have A Dream&rdquo; speech, and 1.1 million workers in Illinois are struggling to make ends meet on the current minimum wage.
In honor of Dr. King&rsquo;s spirit of service and equality, I hope you will join me in calling on Congress to ensure all Americans are able to earn a fair wage for their work. Click here to sign our petition calling on Congress to raise the federal minimum wage immediately &gt;&gt;
With the cost of gas, groceries and rent rising every single year, hardworking minimum wage earners in Illinois are no longer making a living wage. In fact, if minimum wage had kept up with inflation, it would be closer to $10 -- much higher than the minimum $7.25 millions of American workers are getting paid now.
It&rsquo;s time to see Dr. King&rsquo;s dreams through. Please, sign your name immediately: http://action.cheribustos.com/Fair-Wage
Thanks for standing up for American workers,
