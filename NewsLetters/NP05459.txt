Will you help out?

quick favor david?
David, I&rsquo;m sorry for emailing so much.
But we need more Democrats like Brad Schneider in Congress. Here&rsquo;s why:
Brad believes women deserve equal pay for equal work.
Brad believes all Americans should be able to marry the person they love.
Brad believes our Great Lakes must be protected from polluting companies.
We can re-elect Brad -- and hand Speaker Boehner a devastating defeat -- but we need your support immediately. So I need a quick favor:
Will you pitch in $5 or more to help keep Brad fighting for Illinois? Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thank you,
Debbie Wasserman Schultz
