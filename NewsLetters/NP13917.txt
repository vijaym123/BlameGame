This week, I had the privilege of speaking at the annual Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference (I/ITSEC), which serves to improve and promote modeling and simulation education and training programs.
Modeling and simulation involves complex computer models to create artificial environments that use combinations of sound, sight, and motion to make you feel as if you are experiencing an actual event.
According to the November 2013
report
published by the National Center for Education Statistics at the Department of Education, research shows:
the mathematics and science performance of U.S. elementary and secondary students lags behind their peers in many other nations;
the rates at which U.S. undergraduates choose STEM majors trail those of several key competitors;
the United States has one of the lowest ratios of STEM to non-STEM bachelors degrees in the world; and
top U.S. students, who have great potential to become future science and technology innovators, are eschewing careers in STEM fields.
It is critical that we are training students in these fields so we can meet our workforce needs domestically, and grow our economy.
I believe that incorporating modeling and simulation into K-12 education will increase interest in the STEM fields
science, technology, engineering and math
and hopefully lead students to pursue these majors in college. As Chairman of the
Modeling &amp; Simulation Caucus , I will continue working to ensure that we are training the next generation to unlock the innovative potential of modeling and simulation.
Yours in service,
Randy
