Dear
Friend,
This evening the House of Representatives voted on an amendment that
would authorize the Secretary of Defense to train and equip certain
Syrian rebel groups in the battle against the terrorist group known as
the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).
I voted
against this amendment and wanted to share with you how I came to my
decision.
There is no denying that ISIL is a lethal terrorist
organization and that we must confront the difficult questions that the
President has raised about the serious threats it poses. But, this
amendment is a back door vote that has the potential to lead to an
expanded and open-ended commitment spilling into future administrations. It
calls for us to make a near term decision with long term
consequences, raising substantial and unpredictable risks that havent been fully
considered.
For example, I have appreciated the Presidents
continued commitment to not send U.S. ground troops into combat.
However, yesterdays comments made by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff suggesting that he could recommend ground troops in the future
raise serious concerns over the slippery slope we may find ourselves on
as a result of this vote and crystallizes the alarming uncertainties
surrounding this effort.
Many significant questions remain
regarding the cost, commitment of American servicemembers, the
timetable, the nature of the support we have from regional partners who must
take more direct responsibility, the exit strategy, and how we will
define success, to name a few. Given the seriousness of the many
questions that are being asked by both Republicans and Democrats, the
multifaceted decisions underlying this all-too-simple vote require a much
broader discussion and more robust debate in Congress than what it has
received to date.
Thank you for staying engaged and please
