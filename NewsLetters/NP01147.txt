David, sorry to be blunt, but we need at least 25O Democrats to step up in the next 24 hours to hit Cheri&rsquo;s April fundraising goal.
Will you contribute $5 immediately?
David Johnson
SUGGESTED SUPPORT: $5.OO
No matter what, Cheri is going to stay focused on the issues -- she&rsquo;ll never stop fighting to end
Citizens United
and defend Medicare and Social Security.
But right now, we&rsquo;re not even close to hitting our goal. If we&rsquo;re going to keep fighting for our Democratic values in Congress -- and stop Boehner from buying Illinois&rsquo; 17th district -- we&rsquo;ve got to close the gap.
Will you donate $5 to help us get closer to our goal?
$5
$35
$50
$100
$250

Thanks,
