House Passes Legislation that Encourages Small Businesses to Hire U.S. Veterans
Rep. Miller says legislation provides small businesses with needed relief from Obamacare and greater access to highly-qualified employees
WASHINGTON &#8211; Today, U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10) issued the following statement after the House passed the Hire More Heroes Act (H.R. 22), legislation she cosponsored that exempts veterans already enrolled in healthcare through
the Department of Veterans Affairs or TRICARE from being counted as part of Obamacare&#8217;s 50 full-time employee threshold that requires small businesses to provide insurance to its employees:
&#8220;Small businesses, which account for approximately 70 percent of new jobs created in the U.S., are struggling to comply with the costly requirements imposed on them by Obamacare.
In fact, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 71 percent of small business owners say that Obamacare has made hiring more difficult &#8211; an unfortunate reality impacting many of the businesses in my district.
&#8220;Today, the House overwhelmingly passed commonsense legislation that provides growing businesses with relief from Obamacare as well as access to a pool of highly-qualified employees.
It also promotes the hiring of our nation&#8217;s well-trained veterans who have sacrificed for this country and, perhaps more than anyone else, deserve a chance to join America&#8217;s growing workforce.&#8221;
The Hire More Heroes Act (H.R. 22)
amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow employers to exclude employees who get their health care under TRICARE or from the Veterans Administration from the calculations
used to determine whether an employer is an applicable large employer and therefore subject to the employer mandate under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
This would apply to all months beginning after December 31, 2013, thus providing retroactive and prospective
relief from the ACA.
