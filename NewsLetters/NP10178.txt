Dear Friend,
Over the past several years,
I have championed legislation
that will boost
local and national footwear manufacturing while simultaneously supplying
U.S. servicemembers with the best equipment possible. Last Friday,
the Department of Defense
announced it
will change its policy based on this legislation
that I authored
with Rep. Mike Michaud of Maine, and provide recruits with
American-made footwear.
Congress passed the Berry Amendment in 1941
to ensure that American soldiers trained and operated, to the greatest
extent possible, with American-made uniforms and equipment.
However, since FY 2002, the Defense Department has circumvented this
policy by issuing cash allowances to new recruits for training shoes which
are not required to be Berry Amendment-compliant.
On
Friday, April 25, Acting Deputy Secretary of Defense Christine Fox sent
me a letter announcing that the Department of Defense will
provide military recruits with American-made
footwear .
In the letter, Secretary Fox wrote:
DoD
has an interest in having our recruits purchase domestically
manufactured athletic shoes to the maximum extent practicable in order to
abide by the spirit of the Berry Amendment.
Massachusetts
manufacturer New Balance now produces a 100 percent Berry
Amendment-compliant shoe that costs less than the current Army allowance. There is
at least one other footwear manufacturing company that can currently
provide a 100 percent Berry Amendment-compliant athletic shoe, and at
least five other companies have begun the process to begin making such
footwear.
The DoD has spent approximately $180 million on
the athletic footwear cash allowance program to date, which is money
that could have gone to American jobs and manufacturing.
I
applaud the Department of Defense for making this policy
change.Innovative companies, such as New Balance, are able to provide our
servicemembers with quality products and keep business here on American soil.
This policy change will boost job growth, spur economic development
and innovation and give the brave men and women of our armed forces
better gear. It is a win all around.
Please be sure to scroll
down to read more information on some of the other topics on which I
have been working.
As always, I hope that you continue to
provide me with your thoughts, feedback, and opinions on these or any
other subjects via my
website
or on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Niki Tsongas

INNOVATION CENTER
Last week, Governor Patrick visited Lowell
to announce the creation of the University of Massachusetts Lowells
new Innovation Center at 110 Canal Street in the Hamilton Canal
District of Lowell. The Governor also announced $1 million in additional
capital funding to help complete the construction of the building, which
will house UMLs new Innovation Hub and the expansion of the
Universitys successful Medical Device Development Center. Massachusetts has
always invested in and marshaled some of the best minds and resources in
the world. This announcement helps secure Massachusetts as a leading
hub of American
innovation.
MILITARY SUICIDES
This week I introduced
the Department of Defense Suicide Tracking Act, which will provide
much-needed tools to better track and assess suicides by servicemembers and
their family members. Specifically, the DOD Suicide Tracking Act
addresses two major areas on which suicide data is not currently collected
in a standard way military families and members of the National
Guard and Reserves. The bill requires the DOD to establish a standardized
suicide tracking policy for the Guard and Reserves. It also requires
the DOD to establish a process to track, retain and assess suicide data
for military family members.
Military members and their
families sacrifice so much in service to this country, and we have a
responsibility to do everything we can to protect and serve them. This
bill is supported by several organizations, including the National
Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS), and the National Military
Family Association.

CLOUD SECURITY
&amp; CYBER RANGE
Congressman Derek Kilmer
(WA-6) and I introduced two pieces of legislation to make the Department
of Defense information technology systems stronger, more efficient and
more secure.
The Department of Defense Cloud Security Act
directs the Comptroller General of the United States and the Chief
Information Officer of the Department of Defense to assess the cloud
security requirements of the Department of Defense. A "cloud" is a remote
site where data is backed up enabling users to access data/documents
from many locations.
The other bill is cyber range
legislation that would require the DOD to make specific improvements to the
way these facilities are managed across the department. Cyber ranges
are networks used by DOD military, civilian, and contractor personnel
for a variety of initiatives.

DEVENS FD
I have been a strong advocate for the
main federal programs supporting local fire departments by helping
them buy equipment and provide adequate training.
On Wednesday,
April 23 new fire equipment arrived at Devens Fire Department that was
purchased with more than $200,000 in federal Assistance to Firefighters
Grant funding. The equipment included state-of-the-art breathing
apparatus and protective clothing.
