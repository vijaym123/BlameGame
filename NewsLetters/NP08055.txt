Religious Freedom &amp; Workers'
Rights
At the beginning of last week, the
Supreme Court announced two more major decisions. In the Hobby Lobby
ruling, the Court affirmed that religious freedom is a right, not a
suggestion -- that Washington cannot mandate one violate one's
conscience.
In Harris v. Quinn, the Supreme
Court ruled that there ought to be some common sense applied to the
extent of union involvement in the American workplace. In this case,
the decision appropriately puts the rights of workers above the
interests of union leaders. The Court's ruling also came out the same week
that the Employee Rights Act (HR 3485) -- legislation I've introduced to
protect and expand workers' rights -- reached 100 cosponsors in the
House. This is an important milestone and will hopefully put more
momentum behind these reforms. You can learn more about our workplace

Both rulings come at a time when our economy is sadly
still very much under performing to the detriment of millions of
Americans. This past Thursday's jobs report was positive in the number of
jobs created, but it masks the fact that the rate of participation in the
workforce is at low levels not seen in decades and our nation's GDP
actually contracted by nearly three percent last
quarter.
This is a new normal under the current
economic policies that the Obama Administration insists on pursuing
despite dismal results. Meanwhile, in the House of Representatives we've
passed bill after bill to encourage economic growth and opportunity --
including most recently reforms to our tax code and greater American
energy production. All of these solutions sit over in the Senate where
the majority refuses to act. President Obama ought to stop giving
speeches lamenting the gridlock in Washington and call the Senate majority
leader and ask him to get to work.
The House will continue to draft, debate and pass positive
solutions for greater economic growth.
