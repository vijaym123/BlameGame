Ann's Weekly Roundup
Fighting for Jobs
Dear Friend,
As we start a new year, I pledge to you that I will continue to focus
my efforts on creating an environment for good-paying jobs, getting
people back to work, spurring economic growth, reducing our national
deficit and restoring the American Dream for generations to come.
Time and time again, the House has passed pro-growth economic policies
that will help jump-start this economy.
In fact, the House has passed
nearly 150 bills that are sitting on Harry Reid's desk in the Senate.
These pro-growth economic policies will provide job skills training for
the unemployed; stop job-destroying policies on small businesses;
promote innovation and education; create energy projects and affordable
energy prices for all; and replace ObamaCare with free-market-based
solutions that will lower health care costs and make it easier to grow
the economy and hire more workers.
There are still far too many Americans unemployed in President Obama's
economy.
Rather than starting yet another year with the same old
failed policies of more government, more taxes, and less freedom, it's
time we turn the page and begin a new era of economic prosperity for
all Americans.
Here are just a few of the pro-growth economic policies that have
passed the House and are awaiting action in Harry Reid's do-nothing
Senate:
SKILLS Act: Millions of Americans remain unemployed in this country
despite the fact that employers have millions of jobs to fill.
The
problem is that many people who are unemployed do not have the skills
that employers are currently seeking.
That is why the House passed the
SKILLS Act in March of 2013.
This common-sense legislation would
ensure that the millions of Americans who remain unemployed get the
adequate training that they need to obtain the millions of job postings
that remain unfilled.
Northern Route Approval Act:
Building the Keystone XL pipeline would
instantly create 20,000 jobs and would allow the import of enough oil
into the country from Canada to equal half the amount the U.S. imports
from the Middle East.
Yet President Obama has waited for over 5 years
to issue an approval despite the support of the majority of people in
the U.S.
If the President or Democrats in the Senate were serious
about unemployment, they would approve the Keystone pipeline
immediately and put more Americans to work while decreasing our
country's dependence on oil from the Middle East.
Retail Investor Protection Act:
It's not just about putting people
back to work; it's about creating opportunities for them to save and
invest their hard earned money.
That is why I introduced and the House
passed last year the Retail Investor Protection Act, which will
preserve and enhance access to savings vehicles for American families.
This legislation provides some important checks and balances for
Washington bureaucrats so they don't harm the ability of Americans to
save for the future.
REINS Act:
Costly government regulations have stifled small business
and job creation for years.
That is why I was proud to support the
REINS Act, which passed the House last year.
The REINS Act would
require Congressional oversight and approval of any regulation with an
economic impact of $100 million or more.
Such measures would prevent
government bureaucracy from enacting unnecessary and expensive
regulations that prohibit job growth in our communities.
Working Families Flexibility Act of 2013:
In this recession, many
working families must make tough choices and hard sacrifices when it
comes to earning money for their family.
In many cases due to heavy
time commitments, workers must use paid time off in order to meet
family obligations.
This bill would provide private-sector workers the
opportunity to use comp time instead of paid time off in order to meet
those obligations.
This will give hardworking Americans more
flexibility in choosing how they spend their time between work and
family without sacrificing pay.
Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act:
By constantly contending with frivolous
lawsuits in this country, businesses are exhausting far too much money
and effort into defending themselves, and fewer resources into creating
family-supporting jobs.
As a result, the House recently passed the
Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, which would hold attorneys, law firms, and
the parties who file ridiculous lawsuits accountable by paying the
other parties' legal fees.
Imposing this measure allows businesses the
freedom to invest their money back in their business and not deplete
their resources fighting meritless claims.
Providing More Transparency from ObamaCare:
This week, the House passed two bills that will provide more
transparency to the American people from the devastating consequences
of ObamaCare.
One of these bills, the Health Exchange Security and Transparency Act
was introduced by my good friend, Diane Black from Tennessee.
This
bill will force the federal government to notify individuals if their
personal information has been stolen or unlawfully accessed through an
ObamaCare exchange.
To watch my floor speech, please click on the image below:
Since the disastrous rollout of ObamaCare on October 1st, we have heard
story after story of security threats and privacy concerns with the
troubled ObamaCare insurance exchanges.
These include the Chief
Information Officer at CMS saying "there is also no confidence that
personable identifiable information will be protected", the
Administrator at CMS claiming that the Obamacare website "exposed a
level of uncertainty that can be deemed as high risk", and a computer
security expert calling the Obamacare website "a hacker's dream."
It is clear that the ObamaCare exchanges were never ready to be
launched, and it is unconscionable that this Administration would
expose millions of Americans' personal information to cyber threats and
identity theft.
That's why I took to the floor and hosted a special
order and urged my colleagues to vote "yes" on this common-sense
measure.
As always, it is truly an honor to serve you and I look forwarding to
speaking with you again soon.
Sincerely,
Ann Wagner

Ann's
Weekly
Roundup
Fighting
for
Jobs
Dear
Friend,
As
we
start
a
new
year,
I
pledge
to
you
that
I
will
continue
to
focus
my
efforts
on
creating
an
environment
for
good-paying
jobs,
getting
people
back
to
work,
spurring
economic
growth,
reducing
our
national
deficit
and
restoring
the
American
Dream
for
generations
to
come.
Time
and
time
again,
the
House
has
passed
pro-growth
economic
policies
that
will
help
jump-start
this
economy.
In
fact,
the
House
has
passed
nearly
150
bills
that
are
sitting
on
Harry
Reid&#8217;s
desk
in
the
Senate.
These
pro-growth
economic
policies
will
provide
job
skills
training
for
the
unemployed;
stop
job-destroying
policies
on
small
businesses;
promote
innovation
and
education;
create
energy
projects
and
affordable
energy
prices
for
all;
and
replace
ObamaCare
with
free-market-based
solutions
that
will
lower
health
care
costs
and
make
it
easier
to
grow
the
economy
and
hire
more
workers.
There
are
still
far
too
many
Americans
unemployed
in
President
Obama&#8217;s
economy.
Rather
than
starting
yet
another
year
with
the
same
old
failed
policies
of
more
government,
more
taxes,
and
less
freedom,
it&#8217;s
time
we
turn
the
page
and
begin
a
new
era
of
economic
prosperity
for
all
Americans.
Here
are
just
a
few
of
the
pro-growth
economic
policies
that
have
passed
the
House
and
are
awaiting
action
in
Harry
Reid&#8217;s
do-nothing
Senate:
&#8226;
SKILLS
Act :
Millions
of
Americans
remain
unemployed
in
this
country
despite
the
fact
that
employers
have
millions
of
jobs
to
fill.
The
problem
is
that
many
people
who
are
unemployed
do
not
have
the
skills
that
employers
are
currently
seeking.
That
is
why
the
House
passed
the
SKILLS
Act
in
March
of
2013.
This
common-sense
legislation
would
ensure
that
the
millions
of
Americans
who
remain
unemployed
get
the
adequate
training
that
they
need
to
obtain
the
millions
of
job
postings
that
remain
unfilled.
&#8226;
Northern
Route
Approval
Act :
Building
the
Keystone
XL
pipeline
would
instantly
create
20,000
jobs
and
would
allow
the
import
of
enough
oil
into
the
country
from
Canada
to
equal
half
the
amount
the
U.S.
imports
from
the
Middle
East.
Yet
President
Obama
has
waited
for
over
5
years
to
issue
an
approval
despite
the
support
of
the
majority
of
people
in
the
U.S.
If
the
President
or
Democrats
in
the
Senate
were
serious
about
unemployment,
they
would
approve
the
Keystone
pipeline
immediately
and
put
more
Americans
to
work
while
decreasing
our
country&#8217;s
dependence
on
oil
from
the
Middle
East.
&#8226;
Retail
Investor
Protection
Act :
It's
not
just
about
putting
people
back
to
work;
it's
about
creating
opportunities
for
them
to
save
and
invest
their
hard
earned
money.
That
is
why
I
introduced
and
the
House
passed
last
year
the
Retail
Investor
Protection
Act,
which
will
preserve
and
enhance
access
to
savings
vehicles
for
American
families.
This
legislation
provides
some
important
checks
and
balances
for
Washington
bureaucrats
so
they
don't
harm
the
ability
of
Americans
to
save
for
the
future.
&#8226;
REINS
Act :
Costly
government
regulations
have
stifled
small
business
and
job
creation
for
years.
That
is
why
I
was
proud
to
support
the
REINS
Act,
which
passed
the
House
last
year.
The
REINS
Act
would
require
Congressional
oversight
and
approval
of
any
regulation
with
an
economic
impact
of
$100
million
or
more.
Such
measures
would
prevent
government
bureaucracy
from
enacting
unnecessary
and
expensive
regulations
that
prohibit
job
growth
in
our
communities.
&#8226;
Working
Families
Flexibility
Act
of
2013 :
In
this
recession,
many
working
families
must
make
tough
choices
and
hard
sacrifices
when
it
comes
to
earning
money
for
their
family.
In
many
cases
due
to
heavy
time
commitments,
workers
must
use
paid
time
off
in
order
to
meet
family
obligations.
This
bill
would
provide
private-sector
workers
the
opportunity
to
use
comp
time
instead
of
paid
time
off
in
order
to
meet
those
obligations.
This
will
give
hardworking
Americans
more
flexibility
in
choosing
how
they
spend
their
time
between
work
and
family
without
sacrificing
pay.
&#8226;
Lawsuit
Abuse
Reduction
Act :
By
constantly
contending
with
frivolous
lawsuits
in
this
country,
businesses
are
exhausting
far
too
much
money
and
effort
into
defending
themselves,
and
fewer
resources
into
creating
family-supporting
jobs.
As
a
result,
the
House
recently
passed
the
Lawsuit
Abuse
Reduction
Act,
which
would
hold
attorneys,
law
firms,
and
the
parties
who
file
ridiculous
lawsuits
accountable
by
paying
the
other
parties'
legal
fees.
Imposing
this
measure
allows
businesses
the
freedom
to
invest
their
money
back
in
their
business
and
not
deplete
their
resources
fighting
meritless
claims.
Providing
More
Transparency
from
ObamaCare:
This
week,
the
House
passed
two
bills
that
will
provide
more
transparency
to
the
American
people
from
the
devastating
consequences
of
ObamaCare.
One
of
these
bills,
the
Health
Exchange
Security
and
Transparency
Act
was
introduced
by
my
good
friend,
Diane
Black
from
Tennessee.
This
bill
will
force
the
federal
government
to
notify
individuals
if
their
personal
information
has
been
stolen
or
unlawfully
accessed
through
an
ObamaCare
exchange.
To
watch
my
floor
speech,
please
click
on
the
image
below:
Since
the
disastrous
rollout
of
ObamaCare
on
October
1st,
we
have
heard
story
after
story
of
security
threats
and
privacy
concerns
with
the
troubled
ObamaCare
insurance
exchanges.
These
include
the
Chief
Information
Officer
at
CMS
saying
&#8220;there
is
also
no
confidence
that
personable
identifiable
information
will
be
protected&#8221;,
the
Administrator
at
CMS
claiming
that
the
Obamacare
website
&#8220;exposed
a
level
of
uncertainty
that
can
be
deemed
as
high
risk&#8221;,
and
a
computer
security
expert
calling
the
Obamacare
website
&#8220;a
hacker&#8217;s
dream.&#8221;
It
is
clear
that
the
ObamaCare
exchanges
were
never
ready
to
be
launched,
and
it
is
unconscionable
that
this
Administration
would
expose
millions
of
Americans&#8217;
personal
information
to
cyber
threats
and
identity
theft .
That&#8217;s
why
I
took
to
the
floor
and
hosted
a
special
order
and
urged
my
colleagues
to
vote
&#8220;yes&#8221;
on
this
common-sense
measure.
As
always,
it
is
truly
an
honor
to
serve
you
and
I
look
forwarding
to
speaking
with
you
again
soon.
