It has been our
nation's motto
for over
five
decades. We sing about it in our national anthem, and allude to it in our Pledge of Allegiance. It is inscribed on our coins and our currency, and engraved in both the House and Senate chambers, as well as in public buildings across our nation. It hangs in my office and in many other elected officials offices in Congress and across the country: In God We Trust.
I still believe these words and believe they still serve as hope for America.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.
Although it is increasingly under attack, religious liberty remains one of the foundational pillars this great nation was built upon. Read about the work I am doing to preserve Americans constitutionally protected faith freedoms:
