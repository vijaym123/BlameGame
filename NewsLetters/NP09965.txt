DEADLINE APPROACHING
Stay Informed by Subscribing to My E-Newsletter
Friend:
House rules prohibit Members of Congress from sending mass communications less than 90 days before a federal primary or general election- that includes e-newsletters to non-subscribers. In Tennessee, our communications "blackout" begins later this week and will last more than six months!
To make sure you still receive my updates from Washington, you must sign up to receive my newsletters. To do so, just click
here
or visit www.roe.house.gov.
Though I will be temporarily unable to send mass communications, my newsletter will still go out to those that have opted to receive them, and my offices will be open for constituent services as usual. You can also follow my Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages for updates.
I hope you'll consider opting in so that we can stay in touch about issues important to East Tennessee.
Feel free to contact my office if we can be of assistance to you or your family. Our contact information can be found on our website,
www.roe.house.gov .
Thank you,
Phil
