BREAKING: Republicans JUST voted to advance lawsuit against President Obama
John Boehner and Paul Ryan must be high fiving in the halls of Congress.
Moments ago, House Republicans voted to advance Boehner&rsquo;s lawsuit against President Obama. This could be a massive roadblock for the President&rsquo;s second term agenda.
With this vote today, we need 1O,OOO grassroots donors to step up in response. If we hit our goal today, we&rsquo;ll show Boehner that he made a grave mistake when he decided to sue President Obama.
This is one of the most significant fights we&rsquo;ve faced together. Will you be a part of it? Name: David Johnson Suggested Support: $5.00 ALL GIFTS TODAY TRIPLE-MATCHED!
