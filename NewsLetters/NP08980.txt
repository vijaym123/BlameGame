Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
I had a great week in the Bluegrass and enjoyed visiting with many of
you as I traveled the district.
Thank you for the opportunity to update you on my work for you and your
neighbors.
Honoring America's Greatest Generation
Friday, on the 70th Anniversary of the Normandy landings, I was beyond
humbled by the opportunity to join an incredible group of Veterans from
both World War II and the Korean War, who flew to Washington, D.C. for
the day to see monuments erected in their honor.
It was a day filled with incredible stories and memories from our
nation's Greatest Generation, and a solemn remembrance of those who
paid the ultimate sacrifice. They were not fighting for fame, riches,
or glory, but simply because their nation needed them. I was truly
moved to be able to participate in this well-deserved tribute to men
who have sacrificed so much for our country.
This anniversary of the D-Day landings serves as an important
opportunity to reflect on those that have fought for freedom and those
who paid the ultimate sacrifice. Thank you to all who have served and
to those who now proudly wear the colors of liberty and justice as
members of the greatest military the world has ever known - your
country and the free world owe you a debt of gratitude that can never
be fully repaid.
Special thanks to the Honor Flight Bluegrass Chapter
for making this special day happen!

This was the second year that I was able to attend the Blessing of the
Bikes in Owingsville. Thank you to Brother Lowell Rice and the
Owingsville First Church of God for inviting me to be a part of this
wonderful day, which included great gospel music by Mark 209 and an
amazing lunch. I was also honored to present WWII Veteran Nobel Adams
with a Congressional Record Statement in recognition of his service to
our nation.
It was a pleasure to meet with the employees and leadership of the R.J.
Corman Railroad Group on Monday. Our meeting highlighted the importance
of rail transportation both throughout central Kentucky and the United
States. This family business is a true testament to the foresight of
the late Rick Corman and his many contributions to both the railroad
industry and our community.
Visiting the Camp Nelson Civil War Heritage Park in Jessamine County is
a great reminder of the historical significance our region has had in
the shaping of a more perfect union. Camp Nelson has been recognized by
the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom as an important
Civil War site and recently, Camp Nelson was recognized as a National
Historic Landmark.
Congratulations to the 2014 Graduates of Paris High School! I had the
privilege of addressing these bright young people on Thursday evening
at their Commencement. In my remarks, I emphasized the importance of
persistence and optimism in the road ahead.
I wish all
44 graduates well in their next step. Special thanks to
Paris Independent Superintendent Gary Wiseman and Paris High School
Principal Jami Dailey for their invitation to participate in the
graduation festivities!

This
was
the
second
year
that
I
was
able
to
attend
the
Blessing

in
Owingsville.
Thank
you
to
Brother
Lowell
Rice
and
the
Owingsville

God
for
inviting
me
to
be
a
part
of
this
wonderful

which
included
great

and

I
was
also
honored
to
present
WWII
Veteran
Nobel
Adams
with
a
Congressional
Record
Statement
in
recognition
of
his

It
was
a
pleasure
to
meet
with
the

the
R.J.
Corman
Railroad
Group
on
Monday.
Our
meeting
highlighted
the
importance
of
rail
transportation
both
throughout
central
Kentucky
and
the
United

This
family
business
is
a
true
testament
to
the
foresight
of
the
late
Rick
Corman
and
his
many
contributions
to
both
the
railroad

Visiting
the

Nelson
Civil

Heritage
Park
in
Jessamine
County
is
a
great
reminder
of
the
historical
significance
our

has
had
in

Camp
Nelson
has
been
recognized
by

Freedom
as

important
Civil
War
site
and
recently,
