Rep. Garrett joined volunteers to serve food for the Thanksgiving holiday in Bergen County this week.
Dear Friend,
As you gather with family and friends this holiday, allow me to wish you and your loved ones a happy and plentiful Thanksgiving.
This week, I was fortunate enough to join a host of volunteers at Hackensacks Emmanuel Christian Fellowship and the Center for Food Action to help package food for distribution to the poor this holiday.
I commend the spirit and enthusiasm of the volunteers I worked with, and everyone who has made time to brighten someone else's holiday season.
In addition to all those volunteering their time this Thanksgiving, I am especially thankful for the men and women serving in the armed forces.
Both domestically and abroad, our servicemen and servicewomen fight to protect our freedom and liberty and I wish them well this Thanksgiving.
If you have a minute, let me know what you are thankful for this holiday season on my
Facebook page

Happy Thanksgiving!
Sincerely,
Scott Garrett
