Friends,
From our family
to yours, Happy Labor Day weekend!
I hope you're enjoying
a fun farewell to summer. On Monday, we celebrate the American
workforce and all the contributions they have made to our nation's economy
and heritage.
There are lots of community events
going on throughout Northeast Ohio this weekend, and I've loved talking
with so many of you while traveling around the
district.
The Great Geauga County Fair certainly lives up to its name. Kelly and I
are always impressed by the many young people who dedicate their time
to raising livestock to show and sell. I had a lot of fun talking to
Isaac, who was proud to show me his award-winning
turkey.
On
Friday night, I enjoyed watching my alma mater, West Geauga High, take on
Chardon. Chardon Police Chief Scott Niehus and I shared a friendly
handshake as alums, but his Hilltoppers trumped my Wolverines 8-6. It was
great to catch opening weekend of high school football on such a
beautiful evening. I'm sure many of you are also glad Friday night lights
are finally back!
As always, it is an honor to represent
you. Enjoy the rest of the holiday
weekend!
-Dave
