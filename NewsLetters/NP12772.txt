Friends,
As you know,
President Obama recently delivered the State of the Union Address.
As I sat on the House floor for my second State of the Union as a
Member of Congress, I couldnt help but reflect on the stories Ive heard
from constituents over the past year
stories that portray the real,
gritty state of our union.
I thought about a letter I received
from a self-employed pastor in Rowan County whose
health insurance premium increased by 119% because of the Presidents
harmful health care takeover. I thought about a conversation I had with
a single mother in Davidson County who is struggling to make ends meet
in our weakening economy. And I thought about a phone call I had from
a small business owner in Scotland County who faces frustration and
uncertainty due to the Affordable Care Acts red
tape.
Despite the presidents reassurances to the contrary, many Americans are
still suffering and our country faces difficult
challenges.
Our federal
government is saddled under more than $17 trillion of debt. Years of
reckless spending have led our country into a dire economic situation,
putting the burden on our hard-working families, small
businesses and local communities.
Millions of Americans are
struggling to find a job, while others are desperate to keep the ones they
have. The December jobs report confirmed that more than 91 million people
are out of work, and the labor force participation rate fell to the
lowest level since
1978.
The bottom line is we have a jobs crisis in this
country
and the President failed to offer detailed plans on
how we are going to get people back to work. The American people are
desperate for pro-growth policies that encourage private-sector
expansion, shrink out bloated bureaucracy, create jobs, and ensure a meaningful
livelihood for our hardworking citizens. What we need now, and what
we have failed to see year after year, is
real action to back
up the job creation and year of action rhetoric . Words are
cheap, while the cost of living for millions of workers is
not.
Last session, the
House passed dozens of pro-growth jobs bills like the SKILLS Act
which will modernize workforce development programs and empower our
job-seekers, but these bills remain sitting idle in the Senate.
The
Keystone XL pipeline would create 20,000 jobs and lower energy prices
at home, yet the Administration has waited for over 5 years to issue
an approval.
It's not fair that Washingtons bureaucrats
continue to stand in the way of solutions hard-working Americans so
desperately need.
My hope is that we can find common ground on
these initiatives to expand opportunity and put Americans back to
work .
Sincerely,
Richard
Hudson
Member of Congress (NC-08)
