Kansas Common Sense
March 24, 2014
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thanks for your continued interest in
receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
Fourth Anniversary of Obamacare
Sunday was the fourth anniversary of Obamacare becoming law. While the
President promised this law would lower health care costs and
strengthen our health care system, the reality is it increasing health
insurance premiums, slowing economic recovery, hindering job growth,
and has caused millions of Americans to lose their preferred health
care coverage. I continue to believe that the best path forward is to
totally replace this flawed law.
When more than 5 million individuals learned last year that Obamacare
actually caused their health plan to be canceled, the President
announced he would allow some people to keep their soon-to-be canceled
plans. However, this one-year canceled plan delay set the stage for
another round of cancellation notices sent to Americans in Fall 2014,
around the time of midterm congressional elections. So, earlier this
month the President unilaterally extended this delay again, until after
the 2016 elections. Despite these political "fixes," millions of
Americans will still be forced to buy an insurance plan mandated and
approved by Obamacare, regardless of what they may want or prefer. The
Administration's calculated delays and unilateral changes are designed
to mask Obamacare's harmful effects and protect endangered political
allies. These moves are not about serving Americans' best interests -
they are being done for political convenience. After four years, it is
long past time to scrap Obamacare and pursue practical, common sense
reforms that are workable and will actually reduce health care costs.
Kansas Listening Tour Stops in Caney, Sedan, El Dorado and Minneapolis
On Tuesday, I held Kansas Listening Tour stops in in Montgomery and
Chautauqua Counties. According to the Montgomery County Chronicle, my
town hall meeting in Caney was the first time in almost 50 years a U.S.
Senator had visited their community. Thanks to the more than 20 area
residents who came out for an interesting discussion on a variety of
topics including health care, EPA regulation, agriculture and banking.
Thanks to the City of Caney for hosting my visit.
In Sedan, I met with a dozen area residents and we discussed the budget
deficit, tax reform, immigration and access to health care. The
community showed me plans for the construction of a new library, which
will include a storm/emergency shelter. Thanks to Chautauqua County
Farm Bureau for hosting my stop.
My next listening tour stop was Wednesday morning in Butler County at
the El Dorado Chamber of Commerce. More than 50 area residents stopped
by to share their thoughts on a broad range of issues affecting Kansans
including veterans' issues, health care, education, border security and
infrastructure needs. Thanks to Susie Carson and the chamber for
hosting the event.
My final Kansas Listening Tour stop of the week was in Ottawa County.
It was good to see 25 area residents who came out to discuss a number
of issues impacting their community including access to health care -
specifically for veterans - transportation and infrastructure, as well
as maintaining their local post office.
The issues I focus on and work I do in Washington, D.C., are largely
based on the conversations I have with Kansans during these town hall
meetings. Thanks to all the folks who came out and shared a dose of
Kansas common sense. Check my website for upcoming Kansas Listening
Tour stops.
South Central Kansas Medical Center
I traveled to Cowley County Tuesday to tour South Central Kansas
Medical Center (SCKMC) in Arkansas City. SCKMC, a 37-bed acute care
hospital has been serving residents of Cowley County and the
surrounding area since 1905. Just a few years ago, SCKMC opened a new
facility, replacing the hospital's aged infrastructure with a modern
facility that significantly improves SCKMC's ability to deliver quality
health care to patients. As Ranking Member of Senate Appropriations
Health Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over most agencies within
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that impact hospitals
and health care providers, meeting with Kansas hospital administrators
and other providers gives me insight on the unique challenges they face
caring for patients.
During my visit, we discussed concerns with federal regulations that
fail take into account the realities of providing care in rural
communities. Examples include flawed and onerous Medicare audit
regulations, and unreasonable physician supervision rules specifically
with outpatient therapeutic services, which include drug infusions,
blood transfusions, wound debridement and cardiac and pulmonary
rehabilitation services. These unrealistic and overly burdensome
federal regulations jeopardize Kansans' access to important health care
services. The ability of our health care providers to meet the needs of
patients is greatly affected by decisions in Washington, D.C. I will
continue to make certain I understand the real consequences of these
decisions through conversations with Kansas health care providers.
Thanks to SCKMC CEO Steve Perkins for hosting my visit.
Manhattan Rotary Club
This week, I joined the Manhattan Rotary Club for their weekly meeting.
It was great to visit with Rotarians and guests during lunch and I gave
remarks on the importance of health care, technology, and the value of
strong Kansas communities. I'm grateful to everyone who attended and
will keep their feedback in mind as I return to Washington this week.
Thanks to Club Vice President Scott Emley and Manhattan Chamber
President/CEO and Rotarian Lyle Butler for the warm welcome, and thanks
to Manhattan Rotary Club for their continued commitment to Manhattan
and the goodwill of others.
Working to Defeat Alzheimer's Disease
This week, I had the opportunity to visit with leadership of the
Alzheimer's Association including President and CEO Harry Johns of
Chicago and Vice President of Public Policy and Advocacy Robert Egge,
as well as National Board Members about the urgent need to address
Alzheimer's disease and a national commitment to medical research.
Alzheimer's disease affects more than 5 million Americans. Experts
predict that with the aging of the U.S. population, the number of
Alzheimer's cases may triple by the year 2050. The health and financial
future of our nation are at stake and the United States cannot afford
to ignore such a threat. A sustained federal commitment to research for
Alzheimer's disease will lower costs and improve health outcomes for
people living with the disease today and in the future. As Ranking
Member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the
National Institutes of Health, the focal point for our nation's medical
research infrastructure, I am committed to prioritizing funding for
Alzheimer's research to bring hope to future generations of Americans.
Thanks to the Alzheimer's Association for their partnership in the
effort to defeat Alzheimer's disease.
Kansas City Startup Economy Receives International Attention
At South by Southwest (SXSW) Interactive - a conference for startup
companies and tech enthusiasts held in Austin, Texas, last week - there
was ongoing chatter about Kansas City's reputation as a growing tech
hub and hotbed for startup companies. Since then, the buzz has been
echoing on both sides of the Atlantic.
The rest of the world is now learning what we've known for some time:
KC is a great place for entrepreneurship and innovation. Kansas City's
economy benefits from the innovations of our region's fast-growing
startups and a willingness among long-standing area companies to invest
in the community. Companies like Sprint, Cerner and Hallmark, as well
as Kansas City's own Kauffman Foundation and a number of individual
community leaders, recognize that innovation is the key to economic
growth. Their efforts have helped Kansas City leverage its local
resources to become America's most entrepreneurial city. Click here
to learn more.
Smoky Hills Public Television Q&A;
Friday night I hosted a 60-minute, live question-and-answer forum on
Smoky Hills Public Television, which was moderated by Fort Hays State
University's Chapman Rackaway and Hays Daily News' Patrick Lowry.
Thanks to the Kansans who called in, asked questions, and shared
feedback with me on the critical issues facing Kansas and the nation.
World Down Syndrome Day
Friday was World Down Syndrome Day - a day to raise world-wide
awareness of Down syndrome, to help raise awareness of what Down
syndrome is, what it means to have Down syndrome, and how individuals
with Down syndrome play a vital role in our lives and communities. As a
U.S. Senator, one of my highest priorities is to enhance the
independence of all
individuals so that they can live, learn, work and
pursue the American Dream. I am a sponsor of the Achieving a Better
Life Experience (ABLE) Act, legislation that would establish tax-exempt
"ABLE" accounts to assist an individual with a disability in building
an account to pay for qualified disability expenses. ABLE Accounts
would be structured similar to the 529 tax-advantaged savings program
that allows families to save for college education. These accounts
would allow individuals with disabilities or the parents of a child
with a disability to save money to cover long-term expenses such as
education, housing, transportation, and employment support. The ABLE
Act currently has 66 cosponsors in the Senate, and I urge Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid to bring this bill to the Senate floor for a
vote.
Additionally, medical research holds great potential for improving the
lives of individuals with Down syndrome. During a Senate Appropriations
Health Subcommittee hearing last month, I asked Dr. Francis Collins,
Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), about the
connection between Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease - about half
of all people with Down syndrome will eventually develop Alzheimer's
disease.
NIH is exploring this connection with the hope that it will
lead us to a better understanding of both conditions, potentially
benefiting those with Down syndrome as well as those with Alzheimer's
disease. Please click here
