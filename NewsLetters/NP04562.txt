To Americas veterans and your families:
Thank you.
From one generation to the next, your service and many sacrifices have protected our freedoms and changed the world. You have been the wall between us and evil. You are our heroes.
This day is often filled with words of gratitude, and we must be sure to back up those words with action.
As a result of reforms passed by Congress, the Veterans Affairs Department has started righting its many wrongs. Changes include greater access to non-VA care, additional doctors and nurses, and disciplinary action against thousands of VA employees.
This amounts to just the first step. The truth is that many veterans have not seen improvements and are still waiting for care.
All the gratitude in the world doesnt mean a thing if a veteran can't see a doctor or has a claim backlogged for years.
We have a sacred obligation to provide the best possible care. Veterans will know our nation is truly grateful when every day at the VA feels like Veterans Day.
If you are a veteran having trouble with the VA, please contact our congressional offices in Dalton (706-226-5230) or Rome (706-290-1776) - we are ready to help.
Freedom First,
Veterans in Georgias 14th Congressional District are encouraged to contact Congressman Graves offices in Dalton (706-226-5230) or Rome (706-290-1776) for assistance if they are having trouble with the VA.
