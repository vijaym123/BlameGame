Friends,
This week, the House passed the Keystone XL Approval Act, which will now be sent to the president's desk! This common-sense jobs bill has bipartisan support from across the political spectrum. In the Senate, it was passed with the support of nine Democrats, and it passed the House with the support of 29 of my Democrat colleagues. The Keystone XL pipeline has been subject to five safety and environmental reviews by the presidents own State Department, and is even supported by labor unions. Yet, the president still threatens to veto this jobs bill. As Ive said before, I truly hope that, once a bill is sitting on his desk, the president will not turn his back on all of the Americans who would have the opportunity to work as a result of this pipeline. It's time to build!
Small Business Certainty &amp; Job Security
Just today, I voted in favor of Americas Small Business Tax Relief Act, legislation that would make current small business expensing levels permanent. This legislation could provide the extra certainty needed for small business owners to hire another employee, expand their companys operations or make a long-term investment. It will also provide job security for small business employees and their families by ensuring the cost of business does not skyrocket after the current expensing levels expire, potentially putting jobs at risk. Im proud to vote for this common-sense bill, and I hope the Senate and president will partner with the House in making it law.
Thank You
I want to thank everyone who participated in my first Telephone Town Hall of the 114th Congress last night. We had a great conversation.
I'll host more Tele-Town Halls in the coming months, so be on the lookout.
