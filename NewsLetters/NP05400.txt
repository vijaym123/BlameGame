Dear Friend,
We&rsquo;re at 69,839 donors -- only 161 more, and we&rsquo;ll reach our 7O,OOO Donor Weekend of Action goal!
That&rsquo;s 7O,OOO Americans standing together to prove that grassroots fundraising still works in the post- Citizens United
era.
We&rsquo;re so close, and you could be the new donor who puts us over the top.
Give $5 and join the 69,839 who&rsquo;ve already contributed to our campaign.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
We&rsquo;re almost there.
Thank you for making this campaign possible.
Ed
