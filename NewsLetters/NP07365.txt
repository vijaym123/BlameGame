Dr. Coburn to Hold Town Hall Meetings in Oklahoma (WASHINGTON, D.C.) &ndash;
U.S. Senator Tom Coburn, M.D. (R-OK) will hold a series of town hall meetings in the state before resigning from the U.S. Senate at the end of the current Congress. &ldquo;One of the highlights of serving as a U.S. Senator for Oklahoma is the ability to travel the state to talk to fellow Oklahomans and hear what they think about the issues we face as a nation,&rdquo; Coburn said.
&ldquo;It is always encouraging and inspiring to me to talk with friends and neighbors across the state.
Our people make this such a special place to live.
So many good ideas and initiatives that my office has worked on over the years have resulted from conversations at these town hall meetings.&rdquo; The town hall meetings will take place the first two full weeks in August. Coburn concluded, &ldquo;As I prepare to hold my series of town hall meetings, I am reminded how grateful I am to the people of Oklahoma who entrusted me to serve them in Washington.
I am proud and honored to be from Oklahoma, and my hope is this series of meetings will be an opportunity to reflect on what we have accomplished together over the last decade and a chance look to the future to continue working to make sure America remains the greatest nation in the world.&rdquo;
