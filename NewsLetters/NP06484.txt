Rep. Bob Goodlatte
Protecting America From Terrorist Threats
Protecting the American
people from threats against the nation is the highest priority of the federal government. However, in direct contrast to this goal, the Obama
Administration recently approved a final regulation to lift a 30-year prohibition on Libyans coming to the U.S. to attend flight school, to work in
aviation maintenance or flight operations, or to study or seek training in nuclear science. Once Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Jeh
Johnson signs this regulation, it will go into effect unless further action is taken.
The Obama Administration argues that this prohibition is no longer needed by claiming that the United States&rsquo; relationship with
Libya has &ldquo;normalized,&rdquo; yet it is anything but normal. This shift in policy is misguided and ignores reality. Many extremist and terrorist
groups operate without restraint in Libya. Terrorists attacked the U.S. consulate in Benghazi just two years ago, leaving four Americans dead. This
summer, Americans working at the U.S. embassy in Tripoli were evacuated due to rival rebel groups battling each other for control of the area.
Lifting this longstanding ban is not in the best interest of the American people
and needlessly places our country at risk. Just a few days ago, I joined Reps. Trey Gowdy and Jason Chaffetz to introduce the
Protecting the
Homeland Act
(H.R. 5401) . This legislation, which was
approved by the Judiciary Committee on Wednesday by a bipartisan vote, would stop the Obama Administration from lifting the prohibition on Libyans.
A lack of accountability has been the hallmark of this Administration.
If they will not forgo this foolish plan, the
Protecting the Homeland Act
would prevent the repeal of the Libya prohibition and help to
protect our nation as part of the ongoing effort to thwart potential terrorist threats. Click

More Obamacare
Broken Promises
President Obama&rsquo;s promise that &quot;if you like your health
care plan you&rsquo;ll be able to keep your health care plan&quot; has proven to be blatantly false. Millions of Americans have seen their plans
cancelled and now
250,000 Virginians
are also expected to
lose their plans this year. I have opposed Obamacare from the start and this is just another symptom of a fundamentally flawed law. The
Employee
Health Care Protection Act
approved by the House this week would allow more Americans to keep plans that they like. I urge the Senate to take up
this legislation and join the House in protecting the American people from the broken promises of Obamacare.
