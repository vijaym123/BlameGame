BREAKING: Senate moves forward on Constitutional amendment to overturn
Citizens United (!)
Honestly, we did NOT expect to be sending you this email&hellip;
Moments ago, the Senate voted to move forward on a measure overturning
Citizens United . We can hardly believe it!
Now, the ball is in Boehner&rsquo;s court. Up until now, Boehner&rsquo;s refused to bring a vote on overturning Citizens United to the House floor. But as today&rsquo;s Senate vote proves, we can force Republicans to do the right thing if we stand together and demand action. We have to move quickly to force Boehner&rsquo;s hand: Congress is only in session for 2 more weeks.
Will need to raise $100,000 immediately to call out
Citizens United -defending House Republicans.
