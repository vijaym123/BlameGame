A Budget thats Best for All of Us
In
recent weeks several federal budget plans have been put forward. As
your Congresswoman, I support the Congressional Progressive Caucus
Peoples budget that rewards hard work and invests in our country. It is a
budget that makes sure everyone has an opportunity to get a quality
education, find a good job, live in a safe and secure home, put food on
the table, have affordable health care, save for retirement and maybe
have a little left over. And yes, we can afford these basic things.
The budget I support includes my legislation, the Fairness in Taxation
Act. It will raise tax rates on millionaires and billionaires to
between 45 and 49 percent. Those rates are more than fair: after all, Ronald
Reagan's Administration had higher top rates for most of his time in
office.
Also, this week I introduced the Stop Corporate Tax
Dodging Act. This legislation will stop the countrys most profitable
corporations from sheltering income in the Cayman Islands and other tax
havens. It will also end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs and
factories overseas.
In addition, the Stop Corporate Tax Dodging
Act will raise hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade
that could be invested into infrastructure, education, research and
development, retirement security, and other
priorities.
When Storms Strike
Last week we were reminded that
inclement weather can devastate our community and our state. Central
Illinois sustained tornadoes that left two dead, several injured and the
town of Fairdale was nearly wiped out. It was also reported that a
house fire in Mt. Prospect was storm related. If you have been impacted
by recent storms or if you are in the future I want to make sure you
know what resources are available. You can visit
www.ready.gov
for severe weather guidance. Also, as most of you know,
when storms and heavy rains hit many of our neighborhoods we can
experience flooding that can endanger lives and seriously damage property. In
May, I am bringing together local, county, state and federal agencies
to provide information to our community about water and sewage
infrastructure projects that will decrease the risk of flooding. For more
information, please stay tuned to my website and follow me on social
media.
In Our Community
When I am not
at the Capitol, I have been visiting throughout our community, meeting
with business owners, students, health care advocates and many
others. The photos below are from some of those meetings. Hopefully I will
meet you in the near future.
