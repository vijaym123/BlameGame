Dear friend,
I hope
you all had a chance this past Tuesday to celebrate Earth Day outdoors
like I did. This day always provides a great reminder of how lucky we
are to live in a state with such beautiful outdoor
treasures.
I also met with environmental leaders and stakeholders from around
the state at Earth Day roundtables in Durham and Concord. And the
takeaway from these meetings was clear: we must act to address carbon
dioxide and other pollutants in our air that cause climate
change.
The economic, health and environmental consequences of
climate change are very real for us here in New Hampshire, particularly
with respect to our $9.3 billion tourism industry. Ive repeatedly said
we
need to address climate change
and that we
must act now. And I've also said that we should start by investing in
energy efficiency - an approach that has strong bipartisan support. My
bill with Senator Rob Portman will
promote energy
efficiency around the country
and is good for our environment and
good for our economy. It will save people $16.2 billion, create 190,000
jobs, and reduce pollution by the equivalent of taking 22 million cars
off the road - all by 2030.
Energy efficiency represents
one of the cheapest, fastest ways to address our energy needs, it makes
both economic and environmental sense, and it has strong bipartisan
support. That's why I hope we can act on our plan quickly, possibly even
in the next few weeks.
Ill continue to fight for
the environment in New Hampshire and across the country and I hope
youll join me. Earth Day provides a great reminder - we need to think
about our environment year round, and we need to act now to address
climate change.
Sincerely,
Jeanne
Shaheen
