Life Lessons from Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr.
On April 4, 1968, I was just six years old, but I knew something in our
world had changed. Because, just down the road in Memphis, Tennessee,
our nation's beloved civil rights hero, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. had
been assassinated. Growing up, I developed a strong interest in
history, especially the civil rights movement-which blossomed further
while attending Little Rock Central High School. This curiosity
encouraged me to delve deeper into Dr. King's life and his far-reaching
impact on our country. And, every year, as the King Holiday nears, I
take the opportunity to reflect on the lessons he taught me.
Working Together: "We must learn to live together as brothers or
perish together as fools."
Perseverance: "Human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable...
Every step toward the goal of justice requires sacrifice, suffering,
and struggle; the tireless exertions and passionate concern of
dedicated individuals."
Service: "Life's most persistent and urgent question is, 'What are
you doing for others?'"
Love: "We must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive. He who
is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love."
One of the greatest lessons I learned from Dr. King came from his
speech when he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize. He said: "We have
inherited a big house, a great 'world house' in which we have to live
together - black and white, Easterners and Westerners.a family unduly
separated in ideas, culture, and interests who, because we can never
again live without each other, must learn, somehow, in this one big
world, to live with each other." Despite all the progress we've made
since Dr. King's death, our world often still thinks in divisions.
Democrat versus Republican, rural versus urban, male versus female-the
list goes on and on. As we celebrate the King Holiday, I hope we'll
take Dr. King's life lessons to heart and work together to make our
world a better place.
