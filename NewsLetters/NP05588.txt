Dear Friend,
I&rsquo;m Ed&rsquo;s Finance Director, and with election day just 22 days away,
I&rsquo;m writing you to ask for money.
I&rsquo;m not going to hide behind euphemisms like &ldquo;resources,&rdquo; or &ldquo;fuel.&rdquo; This email is an ask for money -- cash, dinero, simoleons -- because that&rsquo;s what we need in the final weeks of this campaign. We&rsquo;ve got an amazing team of organizers and volunteers here in Massachusetts, but they need cash to fund our operation. And Wednesday is the last day to reach our $8O,OOO FEC pre-general election filing deadline goal. Help us get there with a $5 contribution.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Why should you give money to us? Good question.
Ed&rsquo;s fighting for an end to
Citizens United
and a return to sanity in our campaign finance system. But until that happens, eschewing money in a campaign is unilateral disarmament -- and a sure-fire way to let special interests buy the Senate.
The Koch brothers aren&rsquo;t exactly shy about spending money to support what they believe in. We can&rsquo;t be either. And while no single person can keep pace with those two big-oil billionaires&rsquo; spending spree, we can stand up to them if we all band together. If all of our grassroots supporters chip in $5 before midnight on Wednesday, we&rsquo;ll blow past our $8O,OOO FEC deadline goal in a heartbeat. Show your support by chipping in $5.
So, there it is. My finance ask. If you support Ed and want to send him back to the Senate, please contribute.
Thanks for reading this.
Colleen
