April 11, 2014
Friend,
It has been a busy week in Washington, but I wanted to take a moment to
share an update about my work and invite you to my next neighborhood
conversation, which I will be hosting Tuesday, April 15th at 5:30 p.m.
at the Greenville Public Library.
As always, I hope you will be able
to join me on Tuesday and I look forward to hearing directly from you
about your priorities.
Helping Unemployed Americans
On Monday, the U.S. Senate led by my colleague Senator Jack Reed voted
to extend unemployment insurance for Americans who are out of work.
Now Speaker Boehner is the only thing standing in the way of this
legislation becoming law, and on Thursday he adjourned the House for
almost three weeks without taking action on this important bill.
It is
outrageous that Speaker Boehner would leave town without allowing a
vote to
renew this critical lifeline upon which so many Americans
depend.
That's why I launched a new plan today to help put a human
face on the unemployment crisis and continue to pressure Speaker
Boehner to allow a vote on this critical issue.
I will be collecting
the names, pictures, and stories of unemployed Rhode Islanders and
sharing them with my Republican colleagues with the hope it will help
change their minds on this issue.
If you are an unemployed Rhode
Islander and willing to share your story, we want to hear from you.

heard.
A Budget That Reflects Our Values As a Nation
Yesterday, House Republicans narrowly passed their version of the
Fiscal Year 2015 budget.
Unfortunately, this Republican proposal does
not address the most pressing needs of middle class families.
Instead
of creating more jobs here in America, it would protect loopholes for
the wealthiest and incentivize corporations to ship jobs overseas.
Instead of investing in education, infrastructure projects, and science
and research, it would slash funding for programs that would boost our
economy.
Instead strengthening Medicare, it would endanger the
Medicare guarantee as we know it.
This is the wrong course for our
country. The budget should reflect our nation's values and priorities,
this version does not.
Let's tackle the issues that really matter to everyday Americans.
Issues like job creation, economic growth, and education.
This week I
spoke on the floor about a bill that will create 1.9 million new jobs.

Fighting for Equal Pay
This week marked the anniversary of Equal Pay Day. It is completely
unacceptable that in 2014 women still get paid less than men do for the
same work.
It has been over 50 years since President John F. Kennedy
signed the Equal Pay Act into law and we are still fighting to ensure
that women receive the wages they deserve.
We have made some progress
toward a fairer workplace, but Equal Pay Day serves as an important
reminder that there is still more work to be done.
Congress needs to
pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, which strengthens the Equal Pay Act by
closing loopholes and providing effective remedies to women who are not
being paid equal wages for doing equal work.
This is a commonsense
piece of legislation and I will continue to fight for its passage.
As always, if you or someone you know has a question or needs
assistance on a matter relating to the federal government, please
contact my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at

Friend,
It
has
been
a

I
wanted

On

the

by
my

Senator
Jack

and
on
Thursday
he
adjourned
the

As

Yesterday,
House
Republicans
narrowly
passed
their

of
the
Fiscal

Unfortunately,
this

does
not

of

Instead
of
creating

here
in

it
