Doug
Congressman Lamborn
Supports Permanent Sustainable Growth Rate
Fix
3/14/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn joined a bipartisan majority of 237
to 182 in supporting H.R. 4015, the
SGR Repeal and Medicare
Provider Payment Modernization Act of
2014 .
Today, I was happy to support a permanent
Sustainable Growth Rate fix for our nations healthcare providers. This is a
problem that Congress has worked to fix since 1997. For years, I have
heard from Colorado doctors about their first-hand experiences dealing
with these temporary and expensive fixes. This bipartisan, bicameral
policy reform ends the temporary fixes that caused annual uncertainty
and doubt in our medical community. The bill is also fully paid for by
delaying the Obamacare individual mandate tax penalty for the next
five years and will result in nearly $21 billion in deficit reduction.
Under this legislation, providers would be able to focus on patient
care without the twin burdens of financial and regulatory uncertainty
hanging over their heads.
- Congressman Doug Lamborn (CO-05)
