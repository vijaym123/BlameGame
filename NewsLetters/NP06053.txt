David,
This is it! We are entering the final stretch of this election.
We can elect Democrats who&rsquo;ll fight for us -- but we need YOUR help. You are a critical part of our victory team!
This weekend is our FINAL SPRINT Weekend of Action! All weekend long, we are going out to fire up voters and excite them about November&rsquo;s election! We&rsquo;ve got a pretty big list to go through. Will you help us make calls, knock on doors, and reach out to as many voters as we can?
EVENT:
Ballot Chase Weekend of Action in Glenview! DATE:
Fri 26 Sep 2014 TIME:
1:00 pm CDT CLICK HERE FOR MORE INFORMATION
The whole race could come down to just a few hundred votes, so every voter contacted matter!
Thank you for your support!
