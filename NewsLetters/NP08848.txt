Capitol Update
Full disclosure in VA scandal is a must: Editorial by Congressman Cook
Our nation has a moral responsibility to care for veterans who bear the
scars of war in defending our freedoms.
As a combat veteran and United States representative, my primary duty
to veterans is to ensure that they receive medical care befitting a
person who risked life and limb on the battlefield. However, we must
have faith in the leadership of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
to carry out this duty.
In light of recent developments, I welcome the resignation of VA
Secretary Eric Shinseki.
A recent report by the VA Inspector General indicates that problems
discovered at the Phoenix VA Hospital, where as many as 40 people died
while waiting for treatment, are not isolated but systemic. If these
allegations prove to be accurate, it signifies a shameful chapter in
our nation's treatment of veterans.
This failure demonstrates a culture of disregard and disrespect
throughout the VA system and in many VA hospitals nationwide. The
falsification of veteran medical records, such as at the Phoenix VA
Hospital, is not only disgraceful, it's a betrayal of our veterans. I'll
do everything in my power to see that a criminal investigation is
conducted and VA officials are held accountable.
Shinseki's failure to eliminate this culture of callousness from taking
root at the VA and his unwillingness to take decisive action to remedy
this disaster left me with no confidence in his ability to lead the VA.
His resignation clears the way for new leadership that can clean house
and reform this broken institution. I look forward to working with the
new leadership and my fellow members of Congress to implement real
reform.
As a member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, I've taken part in
hearings to get to the bottom of this disaster. Again and again, VA
officials claim they are under instructions from lawyers not to answer
any questions. This is unacceptable. These government officials work
for America's veterans, not for lawyers, and our veterans deserve
answers.
The first step to fixing the VA is to end this legal charade and
require VA officials to provide a full report of what happened in
Phoenix and the steps they are taking to hold people accountable.
To be sure, I don't mean to implicate every VA hospital, and I believe
the overwhelming majority of VA employees want what is best for our
veterans. The bureaucratic mismanagement, either in Washington, D.C.,
or locally, is preventing them from doing their jobs, and it must end.
Politicians and political appointees must face their failures with
selflessness and honor, just as our veterans faced the enemy on the
battlefield.
No veteran should escape the perils of war just to suffer at the hands
of our government. It's un-American, and it's unacceptable. We can do
better, and we must do better. There is no excuse for these failures.
This op-ed originally appeared in the San Bernardino Sun.
Learning from the Greatest Generation
On Friday, Congressman Paul Cook issued the following statement
commemorating the 70th anniversary of D-Day:
"Seventy years ago today, more than 160,000 Allied troops landed on the
French coastline to fight Nazi Germany on the beaches of Normandy. The
Allied Forces, led by General Dwight D. Eisenhower, launched the
largest maritime invasion in history to free Europe from Nazi
oppression. Thanks to these heroes, the Allies liberated a continent,
ended the Holocaust, and preserved freedom for future generations.
Their courage is still an inspiration to us today and is a reminder
that we have a duty to take care of all those who serve to protect our
way of life."
House Passes Cook-Sponsored Bill to Increase Veterans Access to Care
Today, Rep. Paul Cook (R - Apple Valley) voted in favor of H.R. 4810,
the Veterans Access to Care Act, a bipartisan bill that easily passed
in the House of Representatives. This bill will give veterans immediate
access to care from the private sector. The Veterans Access to Care Act
allows veterans who have been forgotten to receive the medical care
they desperately need.
Under this legislation, veterans may now seek care from the private
sector under the following circumstances: when they reside more than 40
miles from the nearest VA facility, when they have waited longer for an
appointment than the established wait time goals, or when they have
been notified that an appointment is unavailable within the VA wait
time goals. The VA will be required to report to Congress every quarter
on the care provided under this authority and enter a contract with a
third party or parties to assess the quality of care. Performance
awards and bonuses for VA employees will be suspended for the next two
years.
Cook said, "For veterans, our government should never be the enemy.
Clearly, the VA isn't getting the job done and now we are in crisis
mode. The House has acted to help our veterans, and now it's time for
the Senate to join us in passing this bipartisan bill."

CalVet, State Controller to Reunite 95,000 Veterans with Unclaimed
Property
After running data and cross-referencing files, the California
Department of Veterans Affairs (CalVet) has identified more than 95,000
California veterans, or their heirs, that have more than $36 million in
unclaimed property and cash being held by the state of California.
Following Governor Brown's directive to work more closely with state
agencies and departments to better serve California Veterans, CalVet
Secretary Peter J. Gravett joined with State Controller John Chiang
today to announce the findings of this new partnership.
Under a partnership agreement between the State Controller's Office and
CalVet, the department found 95,305 veterans that may have unclaimed
property at the Controller's Office waiting to be claimed.
According
to the data run CalVet completed, the veterans have more than $36.3
million available to claim with an average value of approximately $300.
"As Americans who enjoy the freedoms provided by their service, we
support those who wear and have worn the uniform," said Chiang.
"As
thanks for their duty and sacrifice, we strive to continually look for
opportunities to do more for our fighting men and women.
This includes
this latest partnership between CalVet and my office to return tens of
millions of dollars to California's veterans."
"The CalVet mission is to serve our state's veterans and their families
and help them connect with the benefits and services they have earned
through their honorable service in the U.S. Military," said Secretary
Gravett.
"This latest effort is just one of our ways to make sure our
veterans are served well."
"When someone serves in the military, many times they move around a lot
and family heirlooms are forgotten, utility deposits are ignored and
things get lost.
This cooperative effort will help thousands of
California veterans recover their forgotten, lost or misplaced
valuables," said Gravett.
Gravett noted that in order to preserve the confidentiality of the
veterans' records, CalVet will be sending letters over the next several
months directly to the veterans notifying them of the unclaimed
property program.

Capitol
Update
Full
disclosure
in
VA
scandal
is
a
must:
Editorial
by
Congressman
Cook Our
nation
has
a
moral
responsibility
to
care
for
veterans
who
bear
the
scars
of
war
in
defending
our
freedoms.
As
a
combat
veteran
and
United
States
representative,
my
primary
duty
to
veterans
is
to
ensure
that
they
receive
medical
care
befitting
a
person
who
risked
life
and
limb
on
the
battlefield.
However,
we
must
have
faith
in
the
leadership
of
the
U.S.
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
to
carry
out
this
duty.
In
light
of
recent
developments,
I
welcome
the
resignation
of
VA
Secretary
Eric
Shinseki.
A
recent
report
by
the
VA
Inspector
General
indicates
that
problems
discovered
at
the
Phoenix
VA
Hospital,
where
as
many
as
40
people
died
while
waiting
for
treatment,
are
not
isolated
but
systemic.
If
these
allegations
prove
to
be
accurate,
it
signifies
a
shameful
chapter
in
our
nation&#8217;s
treatment
of
veterans.
This
failure
demonstrates
a
culture
of
disregard
and
disrespect
throughout
the
VA
system
and
in
many
VA
hospitals
nationwide.
The
falsification
of
veteran
medical
records,
such
as
at
the
Phoenix
VA
Hospital,
is
not
only
disgraceful,
it&#8217;s
a
betrayal
of
our
veterans.
I&#8217;ll
do
everything
in
my
power
to
see
that
a
criminal
investigation
is
conducted
and
VA
officials
are
held
accountable.
Shinseki&#8217;s
failure
to
eliminate
this
culture
of
callousness
from
taking
root
at
the
VA
and
his
unwillingness
to
take
decisive
action
to
remedy
this
disaster
left
me
with
no
confidence
in
his
ability
to
lead
the
VA.
His
resignation
clears
the
way
for
new
leadership
that
can
clean
house
and
reform
this
broken
institution.
I
look
forward
to
working
with
the
new
leadership
and
my
fellow
members
of
Congress
to
implement
real
reform.
As
a
member
of
the
House
Veterans
Affairs
Committee,
I&#8217;ve
taken
part
in
hearings
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
disaster.
Again
and
again,
VA
officials
claim
they
are
under
instructions
from
lawyers
not
to
answer
any
questions.
This
is
unacceptable.
These
government
officials
work
for
America&#8217;s
veterans,
not
for
lawyers,
and
our
veterans
deserve
answers.
The
first
step
to
fixing
the
VA
is
to
end
this
legal
charade
and
require
VA
officials
to
provide
a
full
report
of
what
happened
in
Phoenix
and
the
steps
they
are
taking
to
hold
people
accountable.
To
be
sure,
I
don&#8217;t
mean
to
implicate
every
VA
hospital,
and
I
believe
the
overwhelming
majority
of
VA
employees
want
what
is
best
for
our
veterans.
The
bureaucratic
mismanagement,
either
in
Washington,
D.C.,
or
locally,
is
preventing
them
from
doing
their
jobs,
and
it
must
end.
Politicians
and
political
appointees
must
face
their
failures
with
selflessness
and
honor,
just
as
our
veterans
faced
the
enemy
on
the
battlefield.
No
veteran
should
escape
the
perils
of
war
just
to
suffer
at
the
hands
of
our
government.
It&#8217;s
un-American,
and
it&#8217;s
unacceptable.
We
can
do
better,
and
we
must
do
better.
There
is
no
excuse
for
these
failures.

House
Passes
Cook-Sponsored
Bill
to
Increase
Veterans
Access

Today,
Rep.
Paul

(R

4810,
the
Veterans

that
easily
passed
in
the
House
of
Representatives.
This
bill
will
give
veterans
immediate
access
to

The
Veterans
Access
to
Care
Act
allows
veterans
who
have
been
forgotten
to
receive
the
medical
care
they
desperately
need.
Under
this
legislation,
veterans
may
now
seek
care
from
the
private
sector
under
the
following
circumstances:
when
they
reside
more
than
40
miles
from
the
nearest
VA
facility,
when
they
have
waited
longer
for
an

than
the
established
wait
time
goals,
or
when
they have
been
notified
that
an

is
unavailable

goals. The
VA
will
be
required
to
report

and
enter

Performance

CalVet
Secretary
Peter

found
95,305
