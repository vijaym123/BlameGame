Montana Priorities
Recognizing his 23 years of experience as a Navy SEAL, and

sustainable timber harvest plan that allows rural Montanans to grow their
economies and strengthen their communities.
Ryan remains focused on protecting Montanans
rights to our public lands and preserving traditional Montana values by
helping introduce the following bills:

hunting and fishing rights on public
lands
