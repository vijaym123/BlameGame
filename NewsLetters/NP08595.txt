Dear Friends,
On behalf
or Rep. Nunnelee, I wanted to send an
update.
The Nunnelee family is in good spirits, and they send
their thanks for the outpouring of prayers and support that they have
received during this time.
The
Congressman continues to recover and is making progress after his first
week of rehabilitation at TIRR Memorial Hermann in Houston, Texas. He
is undergoing daily therapy, and his speech continues to improve.
Although he has difficulty with his left side mobility, there are signs of
improvement. Doctors continue to be pleased with his recovery after
surgery, but they have confirmed that his follow-up treatment will
require radiation and chemotherapy.
The Congressman will continue speech and mobility rehabilitation in
Houston for a couple of weeks. Then he will go to Johns Hopkins in
Baltimore, Maryland, in proximity to the Washington, D.C. office, for
radiation and chemotherapy treatment and outpatient
rehabilitation.
The Congressman is committed to
recovery, communicating to family and staff, attitudes are contagious, so
you better make sure yours is worth
catching.
We appreciate your continued prayers and thoughts for
the Nunnelee family. Please continue to let us know if our office can
be of assistance.
Sincerely,
Elizabeth
Elizabeth C. Parks
