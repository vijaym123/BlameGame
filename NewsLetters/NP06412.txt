Dear David,
Tonight President Obama will address the country in a prime time television broadcast to discuss his plans to combat the terrorist threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as the jihadist group ISIS.
The group has terrorized minority groups in Iraq and Syria over the course of the last several months and most recently took responsibility for the deaths of U.S. journalists Steve Sotloff and James Foley.
Key military figures have labeled them a serious threat to U.S. national security and that has prompted President Obama to explore the possibility of additional military action against the group.
Taking military action against foreign targets is a serious policy decision and I want to make sure I have your input.
Will you take a minute to share your opinion with me?
