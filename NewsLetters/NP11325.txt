Dear Friend,
While wildlife trafficking is largely dealt with off the shores of the
United States, it has a critically important connection to our own
national security.
The illegal trade of endangered wildlife products is worth in the range
of $7 billion to $10 billion annually; the legal trade is valued at
$300 billion.
The concern most people think of when they hear about illegal poaching
is the tragic decline, and elimination, of animals like the African
forest elephant or rhinoceros. Last year alone, there were over 32,000
elephants poached, which is an increase from 2012. A decade ago fewer
than 100 rhinos were killed, but last year more than 1,000 were poached
for their horns.
However, a security threat has continued to evolve as more animals have
been poached - the intersection of wildlife trafficking with terrorism.
This is a growing risk that the U.S. must work to stop and dismantle
quickly.
As chairman of the House State and Foreign Operations Appropriations
subcommittee I am deeply engaged on this national security issue to
ensure our country has the tools it needs to act with force to prevent
wildlife trafficking from being a primary method for extremist to fund
their attacks.
Extremist groups like Al Shabaab in East Africa are finding financial
support through the illegal ivory trade. One such reason is that it's
very difficult to trace the financial transactions when an elephant
tusk or rhino horn is sold on the black market. As extremist groups
struggle for funding in part because of the U.S. along with our allies
successfully drying up their financial resources, they are looking for
new ways to pay for their operations.
What the U.S. is also learning is that the financial cost to fund
terrorist attacks abroad can be accomplished at a minimal cost, which
also directly relates to the illegal sale of ivory. For example, the
estimated cost of the terrorist attacks on the two U.S. embassies in
Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania in 1998 cost approximately
$50,000. This is the cost equivalent of selling 1.6 elephant tusks. In
other words, the poaching of one middle-aged elephant could have funded
the embassy bombings. As these animals become more scarce the black
market costs for their parts have only increased.
The United States has made poaching and wildlife trafficking,
especially as it relates to national security, a priority. A new
National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking was unveiled in
February to strengthen the U.S. leadership on this issue. This new
approach aims to strengthen enforcement of current laws, reduce the
demand for illegally traded wildlife and expand international
cooperation.
As the illegal world of poaching evolves, the U.S. has to be on the
forefront of preventing these activities before they destroy a
population of magnificent animals and allow for the funding of more
terrorist related destruction.
Sincerely,
Kay Granger
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
While
wildlife
trafficking
is
largely
dealt
with
off
the
shores
of
the
United
States,
it
has
a
critically
important
connection
to
our
own
national
security.
The
illegal
trade
of
endangered
wildlife
products
is
worth
in
the
range
of
$7
billion
to
$10
billion
annually;
the
legal
trade
is
valued
at
$300
billion.
The
concern
most
people
think
of
when
they
hear
about
illegal
poaching
is
the
tragic
decline,
and
elimination,
of
animals
like
the
African
forest
elephant
or
rhinoceros.
Last
year
alone,
there
were
over
32,000
elephants
poached,
which
is
an
increase
from
2012.
A
decade
ago
fewer
than
100
rhinos
were
killed,
but
last
year
more
than
1,000
were
poached
for
their
horns.
However,
a
security
threat
has
continued
to
evolve
as
more
animals
have
been
poached
-
the
intersection
of
wildlife
trafficking
with
terrorism.
This
is
a
growing
risk
that
the
U.S.
must
work
to
stop
and
dismantle
quickly.
As
chairman
of
the
House
State
and
Foreign
Operations
Appropriations
subcommittee
I
am
deeply
engaged
on
this
national
security
issue
to
ensure
our
country
has
the
tools
it
needs
to
act
with
force
to
prevent
wildlife
trafficking
from
being
a
primary
method
for
extremist
to
fund
their
attacks.
Extremist
groups
like
Al
Shabaab
in
East
Africa
are
finding
financial
support
through
the
illegal
ivory
trade.
One
such
reason
is
that
it&#8217;s
very
difficult
to
trace
the
financial
transactions
when
an
elephant
tusk
or
rhino
horn
is
sold
on
the
black
market.
As
extremist
groups
struggle
for
funding
in
part
because
of
the
U.S.
along
with
our
allies
successfully
drying
up
their
financial
resources,
they
are
looking for
new
ways
to
pay
for
their
operations.
What
the
U.S.
is
also
learning
is
that
the
financial
cost
to
fund
terrorist
attacks
abroad
can
be
accomplished
at
a
minimal
cost,
which
also
directly
relates
to
the
illegal
sale
of
ivory.
For
example,
the
estimated
cost
of
the
terrorist
attacks
on
the
two
U.S.
embassies
in
Nairobi,
Kenya
and
Dar
es
Salaam,
Tanzania
in
1998
cost
approximately
$50,000.
This
is
the
cost
equivalent
of
selling
1.6
elephant
tusks.
In
other
words,
the
poaching
of
one
middle-aged
elephant
could
have
funded
the
embassy
bombings.
As
these
animals
become
more
scarce
the
black
market
costs
for
their
parts have
only increased.
The
United
States
has
made
poaching
and
wildlife
trafficking,
especially
as
it
relates
to
national
security,
a
priority.
A
new
National
Strategy
for
Combating
Wildlife
Trafficking
was
unveiled
in
February
to
strengthen
the
U.S.
leadership
on
this
issue.
This
new
approach
aims
to
strengthen
enforcement
of
current
laws,
reduce
the
demand
for
illegally
traded
wildlife
and
expand
international
cooperation.
As
the
illegal
world
of
poaching
evolves,
the
U.S.
has
to
be
on
the
forefront
of
preventing
these
activities
before
they
destroy
a
population
of
magnificent
animals
and allow
for
the funding
of
more
terrorist
related
destruction.
