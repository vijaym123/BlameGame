In this week's Rokita Report
*	Honoring Our Veterans
_____
I hope that all of you enjoyed time with your families and friends over
the Memorial Day weekend.
I know our family had been looking forward
to the beginning of summer.
As we enjoyed family time last weekend, I
can't tell you how special it is to be able to explain to Teddy and
Ryan what Memorial Day means.
The day was set aside to honor the more than one million Americans who,
as Abraham Lincoln said, 'gave the last full measure of devotion' in
service to our great nation. We must never forget the human toll that
comes with committing our servicemen and women to combat, and must do
all that we can to avoid it.
Rep. Rokita Speaks at Avon's World War II Memorial Dedication
>From the first militiamen that fell at Lexington and Concord, to the
war fighters who sacrificed their lives in the War on Terror, we must
always remember the brave patriots who gave their all to secure our
country, so that we may hand down the blessings of liberty to future
generations.
We must also take care of those who risked their lives, and thankfully,
returned home.
That is why the House has worked hard in recent weeks
passing legislation in response to the recent reports of avoidable
patient deaths, falsified records, secret waiting lists, and cancelled
appointments in our Veterans' Affairs facilities.
Veterans ought to expect timely and effective care.
The troubling
reports of backlogs and poor service at VA medical facilities are
unacceptable.
Those who are directly or indirectly responsible must be
held accountable, starting with being fired for their negligence.
I
will continue fighting for our veterans by pursuing legislation and
other remedies to correct these problems.
Below are some of the recent actions the House has taken to protect our
veterans:
_____
Demanding Accountability from the President
Two weeks ago, I joined with other Hoosier lawmakers in sending a
letter to the President
demanding the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki for the service
being shown our veterans.
For once, the President finally listened, as
the Secretary resigned today.
These problems, however are bigger than
one person.
The resignation of Secretary Shinseki is an important
first step, but it must be the beginning of much larger changes.
To
best serve our veterans, the bureaucratic culture must change, and
fast.
Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act - H.R.
4031
Last week, the House considered and passed the Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA) Management Accountability Act
, H.R. 4031, to address
the recent troubling report of avoidable patient deaths, falsified
records, secret waiting lists, and cancelled appointments in our VA
facilities.
This legislation holds the management and employees
responsible for this negligence.
Gulf War Health Research Reform Act - H.R. 4261
This bill makes the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Illnesses
an independent committee, appointed by Congress, within the VA.
It
also requires the Institute of Medicine reports on the health efforts
of toxic exposures veterans were subjected to during the Gulf War, and
how best to treat the afflicted veterans.
_____
Serving Our Veterans
I stand ready to help veterans who are experiencing trouble with the VA
bureaucracy.
To date, we have assisted with over 1,000 cases.
Cases
we have assisted with have ranged from VA disability benefits to
education benefits, and many others.
We also have been able to assist
resolving pay issues for active duty service members.
National Guard Adjutant General, Maj. Gen. R. Martin Umbarger and Rep.
Rokita present Sgt. Spink with a Silver Star
I have also assisted in ensuring veterans are properly recognized for
their service.
In August of 2012, I had the great honor of
participating in a ceremony to present retired Sgt. Frank Spink with a
Silver Star for heroic actions in Vietnam over 40 years before.
Due to
a bureaucratic error, he didn't learn that he should have received the
medal until earlier that year.
Other veterans contacted my office on
his behalf, and my staff and I worked with military officials to get
his medal and to present it to him at a special ceremony at Stout
Field.
Learn more about Sgt. Spink's story here
.
Contact my Danville office at 317-718-0404 if you or a relative is
experiencing difficulty with the VA or any federal agency.

Thank you for your continued interest in Congress and for supporting my
efforts in Washington. Take care.
Sincerely,
Todd Rokita

In
this
week's
Rokita
Report Honoring Our
Veterans
I
hope
that
all
of
you
enjoyed
time
with
your
families
and
friends
over
the
Memorial
Day
weekend.
I
know
our
family
had
been
looking
forward
to
the
beginning
of
summer.
As
we
enjoyed
family
time
last
weekend,
I
can't
tell
you
how
special
it
is
to
be
able
to
explain
to
Teddy
and
Ryan
what
Memorial
Day
means.
The
day was set
aside
to
honor
the
more
than
one
million
Americans
who,
as
Abraham
Lincoln
said,
&#8216;gave
the
last
full
measure
of
devotion&#8217;
in
service
to
our
great
nation.
We
must
never
forget
the
human
toll
that
comes
with
committing
our
servicemen
and
women
to
combat,
and
must
do
all
that
we
can
to
avoid
it.
Rep.
Rokita
Speaks
at
Avon's
World
War
II
Memorial
Dedication
From
the
first
militiamen
that
fell
at
Lexington
and
Concord,
to
the
war
fighters
who
sacrificed
their
lives
in
the
War
on
Terror,
we
must
always
remember
the
brave
patriots
who
gave
their
all
to
secure
our
country,
so
that
we
may
hand
down
the
blessings
of
liberty
to
future
generations.
We
must
also
take
care
of
those
who
risked
their
lives,
and
thankfully,
returned
home.
That
is
why
the
House
has
worked
hard
in
recent
weeks
passing
legislation
in
response
to
the
recent
reports
of
avoidable
patient
deaths,
falsified
records,
secret
waiting
lists,
and
cancelled
appointments
in
our
Veterans'
Affairs
facilities.
Veterans
ought
to
expect
timely
and
effective
care.
The
troubling
reports
of
backlogs
and
poor
service
at
VA
medical
facilities
are
unacceptable.
Those
who
are
directly
or
indirectly
responsible
must
be
held
accountable,
starting
with
being
fired
for
their
negligence.
I
will
continue
fighting
for
our
veterans
by
pursuing
legislation
and
other
remedies
to
correct
these
problems.

are
some
of
