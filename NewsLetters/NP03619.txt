A Year of Progress
As we prepare to welcome in 2015, I would like to thank each one of your for your dedicated commitment to our beautiful city and our nation. 2014 has truly been a year of progress and growth &ndash; from continued,
uninterrupted job growth , to
expanded health coverage
for tens of millions of Americans, to a reprieve for millions of hard-working, law-abiding families who can now celebrate the holidays free from fear of separation because of the
President&rsquo;s Executive Action on Immigration . I would like to wish each and every one of you a Merry Christmas, happy holidays, and best wishes as we head into a new year together.
Please feel free to
forward this information to your family and friends . To learn more about these efforts, to express your views, or to sign up for email updates,
please visit my website . I am also on
