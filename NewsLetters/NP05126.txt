David, I&rsquo;ll cut right to the chase.
I&rsquo;m asking for $5.
The election is 12 days away and our race is in single-digits. I&rsquo;m not exaggerating when I say what you do right now could determine whether Cheri wins or loses. We need at least one person from the 60659 zip code to donate $5 to Cheri&rsquo;s campaign to stay competitive.
David, can we count you in?
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Boehner, Ryan, Rove
-- you name it --
they&rsquo;re going ALL IN to bring ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling back to Washington.
If you believe Illinois deserves a leader who will put the middle class first ( not
his big money backers) Cheri needs your support today.
Please chip in $5 or more on our website: http://action.cheribustos.com/Donate
Thanks,
