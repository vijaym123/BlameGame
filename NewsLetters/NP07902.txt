Dear Friend,
The Supreme Court&rsquo;s
Hobby Lobby
decision is getting a lot of press, but that&rsquo;s not the only front in the ongoing assault on women&rsquo;s rights.
In a second case, the Court overturned a Massachusetts buffer zone law that protected women who were trying to exercise their constitutional rights. In overturning that law, the Justices have made it more likely that acts of violence and intimidation against women will occur. We should be expanding safe access to health care for women, not restricting it.
I&rsquo;m committed to that fight, but with extremists on the right doing everything they can to turn back the clock on years of progress for women&rsquo;s reproductive rights, I can&rsquo;t do it alone.
Contribute $5, $10 or whatever makes sense to you to help me keep fighting.

Taken together, the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decisions make it harder for women to access contraception, while empowering extremists and corporate interests. That should be an outrage to everyone who values the lives of American women, and I am not going to simply accept this defeat -- I&rsquo;m going to fight back. Women can no longer depend on the Supreme Court to look out for their rights, and we need to find legislative remedies to the problems the Court has created. That&rsquo;s why we cannot allow the Tea Party to complete its takeover of the Senate. Help me keep fighting by giving $5 today.
Thanks for your support.
