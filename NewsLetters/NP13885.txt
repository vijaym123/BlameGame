This month, I had the great honor of awarding three WWII and Korean War
veterans with military service medals that they never received at the
Bridges Senior Living Community in Waterloo.
*	Frank Lape, a Korean War veteran, was presented with the Good
Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Korean Service
Medal, and the United Nations Service Medal.
*	Robert Manahl, a World War II veteran was presented with the
Good Conduct Medal, European African Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with
Silver Service Star and Bronze Battle Star, and the World War II Victor
Medal.
*	Ralph Adams, a World War II veteran, was honored for his
service in the US Marine Corps. During World War II, he served on
Okinawa and the Consolidation of Northern Solomons.
You can learn more about these brave veterans on my website.
My office has already helped many Iowa veterans recover lost medals or
obtain medals that were never received. Please feel free to contact my
office at any time

Renewable Fuel Standard
Bruce Braley supports RFS
We should be working hard every day to create jobs and grow our economy
here in Iowa. One way is through a strong Renewable Fuel Standard.
The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is critical to promoting the
continued expansion of homegrown, renewable energy -- a vital component
of Iowa agriculture and our economy. As a national leader in biofuels,
Iowa's renewable energy industry is responsible for 4 percent of Iowa's
GDP and supports over 60,000 jobs.
However, the Obama administration is considering weakening the RFS, and
I'm not going to stand for it. That's why I sent a letter to the
President
to urge him to oppose this
reckless reduction and come to Iowa to see how the RFS is helping our
economy firsthand.
Folks in Washington should be working every day to grow the economy,
not hurt it. If these changes go into effect, Iowa's economy will
suffer. That's why the President needs to immediately abandon any
efforts to reduce the RFS standard.

Travis: A Soldier's Story
Travis Mills and Taylor
Morris
Cedar Falls native Taylor Morris and his friend Travis Mills have
become well-known across the country for their inspiring and courageous
recoveries after being critically injured on the battlefield in
Afghanistan.
And earlier this month, I had the privledge of hosting a screening of
the documentary Travis: A Soldier's Story
at the US Capitol. The film tells the inspiring true story
of Travis, who was critically injured by an IED while serving in
Afghanistan and is now living as a quadruple amputee.
Taylor and Travis are two of only five quad amputees living in the US
with injuries sustained while serving our country in Iraq or
Afghanistan.
As wounded warriors, they both have a powerful story to tell. Their
stories are those of resilience, determination, and most of all, hope.
I was proud to have them join me to share Travis' story with Members of
Congress - a story too powerful not to tell.
You can learn more about Travis' documentary here.

Making Adoptions Easier
Watch the video!
November is National Adoption Month, a month focused on raising
awareness of the thousands of children waiting to find permanent,
loving families. Deciding to adopt a child is one of the most caring
and important decisions any family could make.
That's why this month I've been pushing my colleagues in Congress to
pass the Children in Families First Act
which would streamline the international adoption process so
adoptive families are able to pursue international adoptions with
confidence.
Over the past nine years, the number of international adoptions by US
families has dropped significantly, from 22,000 per year to just 8,000
per year. The Children in Families First Act aims to address the
obstacles making international adoptions difficult to pursue.
Earlier this week, I met with Jonathan and Kayla Craig, of Orange City
, who adopted their son Joseph from
Nigeria two years ago. Although their adoption almost fell through due
to red tape, we were able to help the Craigs navigate the barriers put
in place by the US and Nigerian governments and finally bring Joseph
here to Iowa.
Their story highlights the need for this legislation, and it's my hope
that politicians from both sides of the aisle can come together and
pass this common sense bill to make it easier for families to bring a
child into a loving home.

Renewable
Fuel
Standard
We
should
be
working
hard
every

to
create
jobs
and
grow
our
economy
here
in
Iowa.
One
way
is
through
a

The
Renewable

Standard
(RFS)
is
critical
to
promoting
the
continued
expansion
of

--
a

component
of
Iowa
agriculture
and
our

As

is
responsible
for
4

and
supports

However,
the

administration
is
considering

and
I'm
not

That's

RFS
standard.

across

country
for
their
inspiring
and

earlier

I
had
the

they

have
a

Their

are
those
of
resilience,
determination,

hope.
I
was
proud
to
have
them
join
me
to
share
Travis'
story
with
Members

Congress
&#8211;
a
story
too
powerful
not

Making
Adoptions
Easier
November
is
National
Adoption
Month,
a
month
focused
on
raising
awareness
of
the
thousands
of
children
waiting
to
find
permanent,
loving
families.
Deciding
to
adopt
a
child
is
one
of
the
most
caring
and
important
decisions
any
family
could
make.
That's
why
this
month
I've
been
pushing
my
colleagues
in
Congress
to
pass
the
Children
in
Families
First
Act
which
would
streamline
the
international
adoption
process
so
adoptive
families
are
able
to
pursue
international
adoptions
with
confidence.
Over
the
past
nine
years,
the
number
of
international
adoptions
by
US
families
has
dropped
significantly,
from
22,000
per
year
to
just
8,000
per
year.
The
Children
in
Families
First
Act
aims
to
address
the
obstacles
making
international
adoptions
difficult
to
pursue.
Earlier
this
week,
I
met
with
Jonathan
and
Kayla
Craig,
of
Orange
City ,
who
adopted
their
son
Joseph
from
Nigeria
two
years
ago.
Although
their
adoption
almost
fell
through
due
to
red
tape,
we
were
able
to
help
the
Craigs
navigate
the
barriers
put
in
place
by
the
US
and
Nigerian
governments
and
finally
bring
Joseph
here
to
Iowa.
Their
story
highlights
the
need
for
this
legislation,
and
it's
my
hope
that
politicians
from
both
sides
of
the
aisle
can
come
together
and
pass
this
common
sense
bill
to
make
it
easier
for
families
to
bring
a
child
into
a
loving
home.
As
always,
if
you
ever
have
questions,
concerns,
or
need
help
with
a
federal
agency,
please
do
not
hesitate
to
contact
me
at
any
time.
All
the
