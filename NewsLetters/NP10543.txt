Dear Friend,
At a time when we are facing a growing
$17 trillion debt, Republicans, Democrats,
and Independents in Congress all agree that
we must change course and get our economy
back on track. We disagree, however, in the
action we must take to achieve that.
This past month, President Obama
released his budget, which represents a
disregard for todays realities of a
sluggish economy, unacceptably high
unemployment, and a troubling federal
deficit. It increases spending, raises
taxes, and adds trillions of dollars to our
already skyrocketing debt over the next
several years. Furthermore, it fails to
address how we can preserve our Social
Security and Medicare programs to ensure
that they are viable for future
generations, a promise he made to the very
people who elected him. The
Presidents proposal includes more of
the same tax and spend policies that led
our country down a path of debt and
decline, and the American people simply
cannot afford it.
That is why this past week, House
Republicans offered a responsible
alternative. Our budget balances in 10
years and will lead to more jobs, increased
opportunity, a healthier economy, and
ultimately a stronger America. It will cut
spending by $5.1 trillion over the next 10
years, target waste, fraud, and abuse,
overhaul our tax code, and reform the
drivers of our debt. It rejects the
Presidents cuts to national security
and will ensure that our men and women in
uniform receive the necessary training and
equipment that they need. Our plan
strengthens Medicare for current and future
generations and requires the President and
Congress to work together to ensure the
vitality of our Social Security program. We
know must act now to keep our promise to
those in and near retirement.
The American people are presented with
two clear and very different visions for
the future of our country. Our future is
one of fewer taxes, less debt, less
regulation, increased economic growth, and
more employment opportunities. The
Presidents budget would lead to
higher taxes, disastrous levels of debt,
and the eventual insolvency of key programs
that our seniors rely on.
We face challenging times ahead, and it
is critical that we make the tough but
necessary choices to advance policies that
hold the promise of a better future for
those who will come after us. It is time
that the Senate and the President join the
House in working to build a more prosperous
America.
Great visit to University Hospitals
in Cleveland. I toured the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit and the Harrington
Heart and Vascular Institute. Wonderful
staff and certainly an asset to Northeast
Ohio
Thanks to my friend Paul Ryan for
visiting us in Cleveland to talk job
creation and tax reform
