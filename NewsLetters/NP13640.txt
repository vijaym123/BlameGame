Tomorrow: Forbes to Chair Hearing on
Chinese Military Modernization
Washington, D.C.
- Congressman J. Randy Forbes (VA-04), Chairman of the House Armed Services Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, will chair a hearing on the modernization of Chinese naval forces on Wednesday, December 11 at 3:30 PM. The hearing will be part of the Armed Services Committees bipartisan Asia-Pacific Security Oversight Series, which Congressman Forbes co-leads.
As recent events in the East China Sea have demonstrated, Chinas growing assertiveness and opaque military modernization efforts have created a potentially volatile situation in the Asia-Pacific, Congressman Forbes said. As China has undergone a concerted effort to again become a strong maritime power, it is critical that we understand the challenges this development poses if we are to adequately structure and resource our forces in the region to continue to safeguard U.S. interests.
