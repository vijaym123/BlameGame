The Time for Immigration Reform is Now
It's been 272 days since the U.S. Senate passed immigration reform.
Thats why House Democrats will launch a petition in the House of Representatives to demand a vote to finally fix our broken immigration system.
Join
Congressman Joe Garcia (FL-26), Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (CA-12) ,
Congressman Xavier Becerra (CA-34) ,
and several immigration reform advocates, including SEIU's Eliseo Medina and Nuns on the Bus leader Sister Simone Campbell, for a lively discussion about the House Democrats' decision to file the petition.

A bipartisan group of 200 House Members has signed onto H.R. 15, the bipartisan Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, which if enacted will secure our borders, protect our workers, unite families by stopping deportations, and offer hardworking immigrants an earned pathway to citizenship. Yet, the House Republican leadership refuses to take action.
The time is now to enact commonsense immigration reforms that reaffirm our values, advance our ideals and honor our history as a nation of immigrants.
