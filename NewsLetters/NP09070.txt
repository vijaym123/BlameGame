Important Notice:
The Auburn satellite office will be closed, effective immediately.
We have received an early lease termination due to the revitalization of the downtown Auburn area. Our offices located in Issaquah and Wenatchee remain open and ready to serve the 8th district. Please visit our website for a full list of contact numbers and hours of operation for each location:
