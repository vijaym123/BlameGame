Friends,
Over the past three
weeks our country has remembered the fallen on Memorial Day and
honored our WWII veterans on the 70th anniversary of D-Day.
Ironically, the nightly news has been dominated by deadly VA scandals
distressing our veterans at home and now, the Administrations
questionable foreign policy decisions impacting our troops
abroad.
Early last week, in a desperate attempt to get the Administrations
follies out of the news, the President acted unilaterally and released
five Taliban leaders in exchange for American soldier Army Sgt. Bowe
Bergdahl.
When the soldier swap soured and the Presidents
Democratic allies called the action into question, he then used the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a backdoor to enact his liberal
cap-and-trade agenda in hopes of changing the narrative once
again.
Endangering American soldiers by releasing Taliban war criminals,
cutting the legs out from underneath our economy by imposing
job-killing energy regulations, turning a blind eye to 18 Inspector General
reports revealing deadly VA wait times, and outing our CIA Station Chief
in Kabul
all have one thing in common: these actions are
outrageous, if not unlawful.
This
Administrations continuous disregard for our laws and Congress is
unprecedented.
It is time Congress takes a
stand.
I will continue to urge my colleagues to consider my Stop This
Overreaching Presidency
( STOP)
Resolution , so we can hold the President accountable for his
actions and restore our nations laws.
The House passed the
ENFORCE Act earlier this year, which looks very similar to my STOP
Resolution but with one very important distinctionit requires a vote of the
Senate and signature by the President.
I highly doubt that will
happen any time soon.
The STOP Resolution provides a
mechanism for the House, without a vote of the Senate, to sue the
President to enforce the Constitution.
It currently has 118
cosponsors, but will likely not get a vote until after November.
We must
keep the pressure on Members of Congress to consider the STOP
Resolution so we can put an end to backdoor policies and unlawful
negotiations, and restore our country's laws.
Comming Soon: 600+
Jobs
Ruiz Foods, a California-based company that produces bestselling
frozen Mexican foods, has purchased the H.J. Heinz facility in Florence
and
plans to hire more than 500
employees.
This $55 million investment will breathe new life in to the Pee Dee and
the I-95 corridor.
A longstanding South Carolina
company, SoPakCo, announced last week it plans to expand in Marion
County,
creating more than 120 jobs and infusing $3.4 million
into our local economy.
Job announcements like these
prove that our district has a lot to offer, and I will continue to work
on attracting new jobs and companies to our
district.
