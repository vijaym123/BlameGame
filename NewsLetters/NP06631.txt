2014 SURVEY: We have 1 question. What's your #1 issue?
The final tally is in: we had our BEST AUGUST EVER for online donations. Thanks everyone! Now, we&rsquo;re asking for 1 more thing: your opinion. What&rsquo;s your #1 issue?
NAME:
David Johnson
Take our 1 question survey &gt;&gt;
David -- Hopefully you&rsquo;re enjoying some time off on this Labor Day.
But if I can get 60 seconds of your time, we have some GREAT news to share:
Yesterday&rsquo;s deadline was wild.
It was touch-and-go there for a while&hellip; we knew we HAD to find a way to fight the Republicans&rsquo;
$2.2 million
ad blitz&hellip; But
you came through!
You matched Boehner, Rove AND the Koch brothers dollar-for-dollar &ndash; plus some! In total, you contributed
$2.4 million
online. That&rsquo;s in just the last 4 days!
Thanks to you, we&rsquo;re fighting Republican attacks on-the-air and on-the-ground. In fact, we&rsquo;re launching our largest ever get-out-the-vote program! Together, we want to register, organize, and mobilize
1 million voters
in this election.
I could go on and on about how amazing you all have been. But I promised I&rsquo;d keep it short &ndash; so 1 last thing: You make our campaigns possible, so we want to run a campaign worthy of your contributions.
