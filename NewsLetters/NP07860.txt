BREAKING: House Republicans holding Congressional hearings TODAY to sue President Obama &gt;&gt;
Republican leaders are claiming they already have 1OO,OOO signatures backing Boehner's baseless lawsuit, so we need to fight back. We&rsquo;ve set an ambitious goal of 2OO,OOO people denouncing Boehner&rsquo;s plan to use our tax dollars to sue the President.
Sign our petition demanding Boehner drop his lawsuit now:
NAME:
David Johnson
Sign Your Name &gt;&gt;
David --
BOEHNER&rsquo;S GONE TOO FAR.
First, he allows the Tea Party to shut down the government. Now, Boehner is suing the President for simply trying to do his job and get things done for the American people.
And he wants to use YOUR tax dollars to do it!
We want to get
2OO,OOO
signatures on our petition telling Boehner we do NOT want him using our tax dollars to pay for his frivolous lawsuit against President Obama. Sign our petition to show Boehner that you won&rsquo;t let your tax dollars be spent to fund his crusade.
Thanks,
DCCC Alert
P.S. Before Boehner files his lawsuit, we need to show that thousands of people are standing against it.
