Dear Friends,
The last day to sign up for a health insurance plan through Covered California&rsquo;s open enrollment is February 15. If you don&rsquo;t currently have insurance or would like to change your plan, I invite you to join me for Healthcare 411: Information &amp; Advice about the Affordable Care Act on January 24 in Daly City, or January 31 in San Mateo.
Covered California&rsquo;s website is up and running, and I want to make sure you have the tools to make an informed decision to select the best and most affordable healthcare plan that meets the needs of your family.
Since the Affordable Care Act became law, an estimated 3.4 million previously uninsured Californians now have health insurance coverage. In San Mateo County, almost 27,000 individuals signed up for coverage during the first enrollment period last year and 83% of them received federal subsidies. Similar levels of subsidies are available this year.
We will hold one event in Daly City on January 24 and one in San Mateo on January 31. You can take advantage of a Covered California website workshop with certified Covered California Educators, one-on-one informational appointments with insurance exchange experts, and free preventative health screenings. San Mateo County Health System public health nurses will offer free flu vaccines to all individuals ages six months and older at both events.
Please sign up for the event in
Daly City
or
San Mateo
and please forward this email to relatives and friends who might also benefit from the events.
I look forward to seeing you at the end of the month.
All the best,
