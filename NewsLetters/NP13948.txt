Tipton leads charge to keep PILT intact: Stressing that many rural
county budgets are already stretched thin as they strive to deliver
vital services, Rep. Scott Tipton (R-CO) today led a bipartisan group
of 46 of his House colleagues in urging Budget Conferees to provide
certainty for counties and prioritize funding for the
Payment-in-Lieu-of-Taxes (PILT) program. PILT reimburses local
governments for losses in tax revenues due to the presence of large
expanses of un-taxable federal lands, ensuring vital funding for
infrastructure, law enforcement, education and other essential
operations. Read more

Grand Junction Daily Sentinel Editorial: A smoother run for ski-area
water rights: Good news from the U.S. Forest Service last week: The
agency announced it no longer plans to demand that ski areas give up a
portion of their water rights in exchange for the renewal of their
permits to operate on federal lands. Better news out of Congress last
week: A bill by two Colorado congressmen that would prohibit the Forest
Service or other federal agencies from trying to implement such a
policy against ski areas or other water-rights holders in the future
passed out of committee. The Water Rights Protection Act, sponsored by
Republican Scott Tipton and Democrat Jared Polis, now goes to the House
floor for a vote. Read more

Tipton testifies on Hermosa Creek legislation in Senate: Rep. Scott
Tipton, testified in support of the Hermosa Creek Watershed Protection
Act of 2013 in the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Subcommittee. Tipton and Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO) have introduced
companion bills in the House (H.R. 1839) and Senate (S.841) to protect
the Hermosa Creek Watershed, an area in the San Juan National Forest
north of Durango, as well as protect multiple use of the land. Read

Grand Junction Daily Sentinel: Feds back down, won't eliminate measures
of snowpack:
The Natural Resources Conservation Service says it has
dropped consideration of reducing the number of Colorado snow survey
sites this winter, an idea that had been driven by budget cuts. Udall,
Bennet and Tipton jointly signed a letter to the Department of
Agriculture Friday calling on the department and NRCS to make the
manual sites a budget priority. "In the face of prolonged drought,
significant population growth and climate change, NRCS' snow program
data provides vital information on precipitation and future water
supplies essential for Colorado and the entire American West," their
letter said. Read more

Steamboat Today: Rep. Scott Tipton: Coloradans deserve affordable,
accessible health care: "We have an opportunity to work together to
pass an alternative solution that truly expands affordability and
accessibility - a patient-centered approach that allows for portability
and pooling of coverage and ensures coverage of pre-existing
conditions." Read more

Avoid
