You've been getting a lot of emails asking you to join our campaign to defeat Koch Brothers-backed Republicans. Please, don&rsquo;t say no again.
The only way we can make the lasting progressive change we need is by winning elections. And we simply can&rsquo;t win if we&rsquo;re getting outspent 3-to-1 (or worse) by the Koch Brothers and Republican outside groups.
David, your grassroots power is the only way we can fight back.
