7th
DISTRICT
February 14, 2014
Dear Friend,
I wanted to take the opportunity to share
with you some of my efforts to expand economic development and
opportunity in our Seventh Congressional District.
I recently convened an investigative
panel of Congress, which I chair, at the Kennedy Space Center to
examine the progress made in utilizing NASAs and the Air Forces excess
federal buildings and property.
With the Space Shuttle Program
ending in 2010, NASA has seen a dramatic shift in operations and a
decrease of employment from 18,000 to less than 8,000 last year.
Of
the 240 square miles occupied by NASA, 144,000 acres contains more than
700 structures of which nearly 40% were vacant.
Also at the
Cape, the Air Force controls an additional 16,000 acres.
With
NASAs significant mission change, my investigative hearing targeted
current and future utilization at the Cape.
With thousands of
Floridians unemployed and hundreds of structures vacant and underutilized,
it is imperative that everything in our power is done to maximize the
productivity of the taxpayers investment and put federal assets to
work.
By making these assets, structures and property available
for use by business, industry and other agencies, we can save
substantial taxpayer dollars and create significant economic opportunity for
the State and the nation.
Hearing testimony highlighted that
both NASA and the Air Force are actively soliciting proposals from the
public and private sector to improve the utilization of excess
property.
The witness from the Cape Canaveral Port testified that with
a land use agreement from the Air Force and rail access through NASA
property, the Port and region could increase employment by more than
5,000.
For more information on this or other efforts to
expand economic opportunity in Central Florida, please visit our

With my regards and best wishes, I
remain
Most respectfully,
