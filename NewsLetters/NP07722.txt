I wanted to update you on the bill I wrote to you about last month to ban state and local governments from taxing Internet access.
I am pleased to tell you that the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act passed the House this week by voice vote.

Taxing internet access?
Friend
Access to the Internet should never be taxed. And yet, many states and localities are looking to do just this. Pull out your most recent phone bill -- look closely, and you'll notice a list of access taxes tacked onto your bill each month. If you look at the bill from your Internet service provider, those same taxes are not there.
I am championing a bill to permanently ensure that citizens cannot be taxed for Internet access: the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act. Take a look at
H.R.3086 . Let's keep access to the Internet tax-free.
Yours in service,
Randy
