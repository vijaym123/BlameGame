Dear Friends,
Throughout our history, the United
States has been a beacon of freedom, a land of innovation and
opportunity.
As a political refugee who arrived in this country
after fleeing Castros cruel dictatorship, I know that all can achieve
success in our nation regardless of their background or circumstances as
long as they are willing to work hard.
This American dream
has inspired and fostered generations of innovators and has made our
nation an economic power.
However, the economic downturn,
poor fiscal management, and burdensome regulations have created an
atmosphere that threatens that American dream for the next
generation.
I am committed to creating an opportunity economy that restores
the American dream for our children and grandchildren.
An
opportunity based economy is one that empowers individuals to chart
their own paths toward success.
There are three pillars that
make up this new American opportunity economy; tax reform,
strengthening small businesses and increasing access to education. Reforming our
broken tax system is an important step in creating an opportunity
based economy.
Creating a simpler tax code without unfair
loopholes will be fairer for everyone, bring jobs home, and help make South
Floridas innovators and manufacturers more
competitive.
Small businesses are the backbone of our nation.
I am proud
to represent a community with so many mom and pop shops and family
owned businesses.
A thriving American economy is dependent on
the empowerment of small businesses throughout our
community.
It is vital to rein in and remove unnecessary government barriers
in order to strengthen the ability of American businesses to build,
grow, and compete. We must also work to make it easier for our
businesses to have access to new markets.
Opening new
opportunities for American-made goods will help lower prices for consumers,
create better, higher-paying jobs for workers, and attract new investments
to our communities.
We must also expand the educational
opportunities available to young Americans.
This can be done
by reforming outdated education policies to empower parents with the
choice and ability to seek great schools and teachers for their
children. We must also work to help better prepare students for
tomorrows job market by increasing access to STEM programs and making college
more affordable for our children and grandchildren.
By
reducing bureaucratic barriers and encouraging innovation, we can ensure
a competitive economy that can meet the demands of our times. I look
forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to
help create an opportunity economy that helps our children and
grandchildren continue to achieve the American
dream.
Sincerely,
Ileana
