Supporting the 2016 Intelligence Authorization
Act
6/17/15
This week, Congressman Doug Lamborn supported the passage of
the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. Among many
important national security items, the bill contained language authored by the
Congressman to strengthen our anti-tunneling defenses and
efforts in the United States and Israel.
"The tunnel threat is real and growing. American bases and
embassies around the world could be at risk, and we obviously have a very
serious tunnel threat on our southern border as well.
CENTCOM,
which is in charge of our military in the Middle East, has likewise
been very clear regarding the need to address this threat.
Our ally
Israel is seeing it in Gaza, and there is growing concern about
Israels northern border as well. Finally, rebels in Syria have used
tunnels to attack regime forces. Language I authored in the base bill
requires that the Director of National Intelligence designate an official to
manage our intelligence on tunnels. Combined with this amendment,
which requires reporting on the tunnel threat, we will ensure that our
Intel Community stays focused on this threat. Going forward, partnership
is the best way to address this growing threat. As we have seen with
Iron Dome and other missile defense efforts, working with a vital ally
like Israel enables both countries to learn quickly while sharing
costs and new technologies.
There are also many items in this bill that are vitally important to
our intelligence missions and efforts across the globe. I am honored
to support this strong bill. It will allow us to fully utilize our
assets, deter our enemies, and protect American interests around the
world."

Lamborn (CO-05)
