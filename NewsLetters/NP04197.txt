Friend -
I need your help: I want to hear firsthand how the Presidents healthcare law has impacted you
either as a small business owner, employer, or employee in the Fourth District of Virginia. How has it impacted your business, or your workplace?
Your story matters, and your insight on this issue is valuable to me.

Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.
Accessible, affordable healthcare is an important priority, but it cannot come at the cost of our small businesses viability. Freeing up small businesses to grow, thrive, and create jobs is the key to lighting up our economy
and the government needs to be an enabler, not a barrier, to that growth. Read about my work to accomplish that,
