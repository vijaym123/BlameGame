Finding Relief for the
Middle Class
Last week, I
traveled to Chillicothe, Cameron, Trenton and Gallatin, talking with
small business owners, farmers, and families.
As part of my Small
Business &amp; Middle Class Relief Forum Tour, these events featured a
productive dialogue about ways for the middle class to achieve relief
from overbearing regulations.
Blake Hurst, President of the Board
of Directors for the Missouri Farm Bureau, also joined me at the
events to offer his insight and perspective.
In all parts of the Sixth District, one thing I
constantly hear from constituents is how frustrated they are with the Obama
Administrations regulatory rampage.
Over the past four years,
the Administration has single-handedly issued major rules that added
$70 billion in new costs to our economy.
This atmosphere has
created a lack of accountability, allowing agencies to issue rules that are
costly, complex, and ineffective.
As Chairman of the House Small Business Committee, I have made
scrutinizing federal regulations a top priority.
One item in
particular we've looked at is the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), which
requires federal agencies to assess the economic impact of their
regulations on small businesses, and if significant, consider less
burdensome alternatives.
Although the law has been on the books for more
than three decades, agencies still fail to fully comply with the RFA's
requirements.
To address this
shortcoming, the Small Business Committee approved the Regulatory
Flexibility Improvements Act.
The bill, which has since been passed
by the House, would require agencies to consider indirect impacts of
regulations, so the consequences on the economy are better
understood.
Its time to pump the brakes
on how this Administration has been doing business
lately.
Sincerely,
Sam
