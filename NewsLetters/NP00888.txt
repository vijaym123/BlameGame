House Passes Poliquin Amednment :
Today, the House of Representatives passed the
National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA). Included in this
bill is an amendment,
which Poliquin
drafted , to help adjust the requirements of the Historically
Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) program under the Base Realignment and

The
Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act : On Thursday,
Congressman Poliquin supported the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act to give
Mainers a voice on the Iran deal.
The Iran Nuclear Agreement
Review Act will allow Mainers to review all the details and have a say in
the agreement process. While traveling the Second District, I heard
from several people who voiced their concerns of a nuclear Iran, and I
will be sure to remind the President and his Administration about their
concerns.

Member of the Week : On
Friday, Congressman Poliquin was featured on the House Republicans
website as the member of the week. Be sure to check out his video

Hearing on Dodd-Frank
Act : On Wednesday , Congressman Poliquin questioned witnesses at a House
Financial Services Committee
hearing on the Dodd-Frank Act. This Act casts a large net of regulations
that are hurting our community banks, credit unions and small
businesses in the Second District. We shouldn't be enacting legislation that
hurts our businesses and job creators. We need more jobs, not more job
killing laws. Share if you agree with me that the Dodd-Frank Act is
hurting our community banks, credit unions and small
businesses.
Meetings in
DC : Congressman Poliquin had a great time meeting and talking to
Mainers this week in DC. If you are planning a trip to DC, be sure to use
