Dear
Friends,
Happy Thanksgiving! Last week,
as we celebrated the 150 th
anniversary of the Gettysburg
address, I was reminded of how blessed we are to live in this great
nation. As Abraham Lincoln stated in his
address,
It is for us the living, rather,
to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us- that from
these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which
they gave the last full measure of devotion- that we here highly
resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain-
that this
nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom- and that government
of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from
the earth .
The Battle of Gettysburg was a turning point in our countrys
history, reversing the tide of the war and beginning the process that
led to reunification and healing. While it may seem like Washingtons
gridlock is at an all-time high, America is still the greatest
country in the world and we are still unified in fighting for the same
ideals that Abraham Lincoln defended 150 years agolife, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness.
Shortly after the
Gettysburg Address, it was also Lincoln who officially declared
Thanksgiving as a national holiday in 1863. So between watching football and
eating pumpkin pie, I hope youll take some time this week to think
about all we have to be thankful for as a country, a state and in your own
family. Especially during this upcoming holiday season, may we
resolve to be kind and courteous to those around
us.
As Theodore Roosevelt said, Let us remember that, as much has
been given us, much will be expected from us, and that true homage
comes from the heart as well as from the lips, and shows itself in
deeds.
From my family to yours, Happy
Thanksgiving!
As always,
