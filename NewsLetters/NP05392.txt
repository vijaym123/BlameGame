Friend -- This is how the GOP thinks they&rsquo;ll win the election:
By suppressing the vote.
It&rsquo;s an utter OUTRAGE!!
They&rsquo;ve passed what the
New York Times
called the &ldquo;nation&rsquo;s most extensive effort at voter suppression&rdquo; in North Carolina. They&rsquo;re trying to keep tens of thousands of newly registered voters off the rolls in Georgia. They&rsquo;ve cut off early voting in Ohio. The list goes on and on!
And all for one purpose: To win the election.
They don&rsquo;t care about basic democratic fairness, or about the appalling legacy of voter suppression. It&rsquo;s absolutely SHAMEFUL!
Will you sign our petition to the GOP telling them to drop these outrageous, undemocratic tactics? Add your name &gt;&gt;

Voter Suppression:

According to the
New York Times,
Republicans &ldquo;are sowing confusion and changing voting procedures&hellip; [in] states that could help determine control of the Senate.&rdquo;
For example, in Georgia, the
Washington Post
reports that &ldquo;mass voter confusion looms as Election Day nears.&rdquo; Tens of thousands of voters might arrive at the polls only to find that their
registration forms were never processed!
And those votes could make the difference in this election.
We MUST fight back against the GOP&rsquo;s skullduggery:
Tell Republicans to stop suppressing voters! Add your name &gt;&gt;
Thank you for taking action,
DSCC Rapid Response
P.S. Democrats aren&rsquo;t taking these appalling efforts lying down. We&rsquo;re fighting back with a $60 million project to register nontraditional voters and get them to the polls -- no matter what the GOP does.
Will you pitch in? &gt;&gt;
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
Thank you for your continued support.
