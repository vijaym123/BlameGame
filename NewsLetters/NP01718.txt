Florida is the state with the highest per capita rate of reported fraud and other types of complaints, according to a report released earlier this month by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
Thats why Ive invited experts from the FTC, Hillsborough County Consumer Protection Agency, Tampa Police Department, Hillsborough County Sheriffs Office, AARP, among others, to my:
Consumer Protection &amp; Fraud Prevention Workshop
Wednesday, April 1, 10 a.m.
Noon
Barksdale Senior Center, 1801 N. Lincoln Ave., Tampa.
Please let your family and friends know about attending this important workshop. These days, there are many more faces of fraud and scams can go viral rapidly. Victims can be left in the dust
financially and emotionally drained if they dont quickly recognize and report fraud activity. Please come hear from federal and local representatives who will equip you with the information you need to detect, deter and report fraud activity.
I look forward to see you there and if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact my office at 813-871-2817.
Sincerely,
Kathy Castor
