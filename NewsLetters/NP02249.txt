Winter is almost done and spring is around the corner.
During this changing of the seasons, Im asking you to send my office your digital photos of your favorite sights and memories from this winter so we can highlight and showcase Ohios 15th Congressional District!
All photos can be sent to PhotosOH15@gmail.com. Please include your name, your city, where the photo was taken and a description of the photo.

We look forward to sharing your photographs in future newsletters, on our social media pages and with visitors to our offices!
