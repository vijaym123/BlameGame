.
FOOD STAMP PROGRAM: I know some of you have been frustrated by the state's problem-plagued SNAP or food stamp system over the past several months, which has prevented thousands of people from receiving critical assistance.
Please know my office is doing what we can to help constituents navigate the cumbersome state system.
In the meantime, the federal government has given the state of Georgia
a 30-day deadline to show significant progress. If it fails to meet that deadline, the federal government might begin withholding $15 million in federal funds from Georgia as soon as May 14, 2014.
The federal government will continue to provide technical assistance to Georgia and hope the withholding of administrative funds will not be necessary.

ARTS COMPETITION: I'm pleased to announce we are holding this year's Congressional Arts Competition awards program on Saturday, April 26 at the Lou Walker Senior Center at 10 a.m. The annual event displays the community's finest young artists. Eligible high school students throughout the district, which include parts of DeKalb, Gwinnett, Newton and all of Rockdale county, have entered this year's contest to compete for more than $23,000 in scholarships from the Art Institute of Atlanta and the Savannah College of Art & Design. Hope to see you there. For more, click HERE .
SOCIAL SECURITY POLICY CHANGE: The Social Security Administration said this week that it will no longer collect taxpayers' debts that are more than 10 years old. This move comes after it was revealed that the Treasury Department was intercepting the federal and state tax refunds of debtors' children - even if the debts were decades old. The debts stem from overpayments by Social Security that the agency had been trying to recoup even if the original recipients had died. For more, click HERE .

Dear
F riends,
I&#8217;m pleased to report that eight million Americans have now enrolled for health coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces &#8211; joining the three million young adults who have been able to remain on their parents&#8217; plans, and the
millions more who are securing new coverage for themselves and their families through the expansion of Medicaid.
Unfortunately, Georgia's leadership continues to play politics with Medicaid expansion that would cover an additional 650,000 Georgians who do not have coverage today.
The good news is more than 220,000 Georgians are now getting healthcare coverage from plans offered on the exchanges. I will continue to work with my colleagues to strengthen and improve these historic protections and urge my Republican
friends at the state level to expand Medicaid. The law is already helping provide personal and economic freedom to millions of students, seniors, entrepreneurs and families. What we need in Washington is not yet another vote to repeal or destroy the law, but
partners on the other side of the aisle who will work with us to improve the law and make it better. For more, click
