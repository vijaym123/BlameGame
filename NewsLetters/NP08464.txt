Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
As we prepare to celebrate our countrys birthday and 238 years of independence, I participated in Faith Lutheran Church and Schools Annual Patriotic Party in Eustis this past weekend. It was an honor to join the North Lake community in recognizing the liberty and freedom we enjoy by highlighting, in a unique way, the stories of those who helped lay the foundation for our great country. The French philosopher Alexis de Toqueville once wrote that America is great because America is good. As our communities come together, it is refreshing to see the spirit of America still alive and well as we celebrate our heritage as friends and neighbors.

Yesterday, I joined the West Orange Habitat for Humanity to dedicate a new home in Winter Garden for the Jamie Morss family. The West Orange Habitat program began in 1990 and for the past twenty-five years, dedicated volunteers and leaders have assisted local residents by providing them with a hand up rather than a hand out. It has been my privilege to partner closely with the Habitat for Humanity program and support the work they are doing to provide opportunities for our families and enhance our communities.

During an Aviation Subcommittee hearing with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure this week, I listened to testimony from agencies, airports and airlines regarding financing airport improvements, including specific details regarding expansion at the Orlando International Airport.

Last summer, I had the opportunity to visit one of Andy Rosens Pizza Hut restaurants in Ocoee. It was great to receive an update from him this week regarding the effect that federal policies have on his local business in Central Florida. We specifically discussed the Presidents healthcare law and the uncertainty surrounding the burdensome federal tax code.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
A constituent from Orlando recently contacted my office regarding the petition she had filed on behalf of her husband for an immigrant visa. Due to the high volume of cases at the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), there were some delays and my office was able to submit a Congressional Inquiry and assure her the delays were due to agency workload rather than the petition itself. We were happy to report that the petition was approved late last year and was forwarded to the National Visa Center (NVC) for further processing. My office followed up to verify that everything was progressing, and received a grateful response from the constituent for our assistance.
Constituent Services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
Congress has been investigating the admitted IRS targeting of American citizens for their political beliefs for over three years. Recently, the IRS admitted to Congress that due to a computer crash the Agency "lost" over two years worth of emails from Lois Lerner, the senior official at the center of this scandal. It appears that the IRS shared this information with White House officials, but kept it secret from Congress and the America people for months. It has also been reported that the IRS has also "lost" emails from up to six other employees allegedly involved in this scandal.
The IRS expects American taxpayers to keep up to 7 years of tax information in case of audit, but was apparently unable to adequately store the emails of a senior employee, who was under investigation by Congress, for a matter of months.
Do you believe the IRS simply "lost" thousands of Lois Lerner's emails due to a computer crash?
Yes
No

Legislative Update:
Americas transportation and infrastructure system is the backbone of our economy and is a critical element for growth and job creation. Last week, I introduced new transportation legislation entitled the
TIFIA 2.0 Act . By prioritizing investable infrastructure,
TIFIA 2.0
will improve access to affordable infrastructure financing for states and local governments, promote innovative public-private partnerships and accelerate delivery of large-scale public transportation projects and the jobs that support them.
In an era of bloated government spending, wise and calculated investments are crucial.
TIFIA 2.0
provides new money to the transportation and infrastructure system that will bolster our economy and expand opportunity for growth and success without raising taxes.
The
TIFIA 2.0 Act
improves the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) by transforming it into a sustainable, revolving fund that will continuously grow to meet our nations infrastructure needs.
Focusing on funding roads, bridges, tunnels, transit and intermodal projects,
TIFIA 2.0
will generate new transportation revenues and attract new investment capital. Projects that reduce risks to taxpayers and have a record of prior prompt repayment of loans are given priority consideration under this legislation.

TIFIA
2.0
