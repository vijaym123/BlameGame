Recently, comments made by MIT Professor Jonathan Gruber, the
self-proclaimed
architect of Obamacare, have come to the publics attention in which Professor Gruber fundamentally said American stupidity and a lack of transparency were key factors in getting Obamacare passed into law.
Rather than give the American people a chance for honest debate about how to best reform our health care system by drafting the law in a transparent and straightforward manner, the authors of Obamacare chose to draft the law in a manner that masked the true cost and impacts of the law.
While Obamacare may currently be the law of the land, the debate about the future of health care in American is far from over.
I believe that Obamacare should be repealed and replaced with patient-centered reforms, like the American Health Care Reform Act (H.R. 3121) and the Empowering Patients First Act (H.R. 2300), that give Americans the freedom to pick the health care that is best for them. Please
