Dear
Friend,
I began this week seeing off several dozen veterans on their way
to Washington, D.C. as part of an Honor Flight leaving Castle Airport.
These men, part of the greatest generation, and their families were a
pleasure to meet. Their service and sacrifice are inspiring, and it
is a joy to see them visit the memorials dedicated to them.
You can view
more photos of the veterans and their families through my Facebook
page.
On Tuesday, I hosted the
Honorable Han Dong-man, consul general of the Republic of Korea, for
a Korean War Medal Presentation at CSU Stanislaus in Turlock. The
Consul General and I awarded Ambassador for Peace medals and
certificates to over a hundred Korean War vets. Some received medals
posthumously, with family members accepting the awards in their place. Young
cadets from the Stanislaus Military Academy served as escorts to help the
Korean War vets across the stage and many of the veterans brought
children and grandchildren with them. It was an honor to be with so many
brave men and women who served our nation in Korea, and to see young
people showing appreciation for their service.
The
Turlock Journals story about the presentation has more details from
several of the vets in attendance .
It was great to visit with the Korean War veterans at Tuesday's
ceremony.
I donated a new
flag, first flown over the U.S. Capitol, to the Ripon Chamber of
Commerce this week.
Thanks to the Ripon Fire Department for letting me
borrow their ladder to hang the
flag!
I spoke to members of the Modesto Rotary Club about some of
the most pressing issues to our area
alleviating our water crisis and
creating jobs here at home were two topics of
interest.
My staff, my wife Sonia and I visited the Modesto Gospel Mission
bright and early on Wednesday morning to provide breakfast for the centers
occupants. We enjoyed meeting many of the people staying at the
center and serving them a square meal to start the day.
I
visited Walnut Elementary Education Center in Turlock to honor Brett
Sutterly, who in August received the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys
Presidential Innovation Award for Environmental Education (PIAEE) for
his contribution to environmental protection and helping the school
go green. On Wednesday I stopped by Daniel Savage Elementary School to
talk to their 6 th
grade social studies classes about life
as a Congressman.
Im looking forward to another busy week
at home. Dont forget to go to the polls on Tuesday! Happy
Halloween!
