Dear Friend,
This week, President Obama's administration selected Memphis to be
included in a brand new program aimed at growing our local economy, I
voted to help protect our veterans from substandard care, and I
commemorated the life of Rev. Frank McRae on the House Floor. Keep
reading to learn what else happened this week.

Fighting for Veterans Who Fought For Us
With Memorial Day approaching, President Obama spoke to the nation on
Wednesday about widespread reports calling into question the management
of and quality of care provided at Veterans Affairs Medical Centers
(VAMCs) in several states including Tennessee. Both President Obama and
I are committed to ensuring that those who risked life and limb for
this country receive the finest care available when they come home-and
I am very disappointed with these reports. With more and more of our
nation's veterans returning from combat suffering from PTSD and other
serious conditions, I will continue working with President Obama to
make sure they are treated with the utmost respect and receive timely,
high-quality care at the Memphis VAMC or any other VAMC.
Immediately after the VA Inspector General released a report
documenting three deaths at the Memphis VAMC that may have been
preventable, I invited Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric K. Shinseki
to visit our city's VAMC so that he could see firsthand the problems
there and better understand the needs of the Memphis veteran community.
This week, I also voted to pass bipartisan legislation that would give
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs broader authority to remove failing
or ineffective VAMC employees from their posts. People who provide
substandard care to our soldiers don't deserve to be rewarded by being
able to keep their jobs, they should be punished.
Whether fighting to ensure the VA has the resources necessary to reduce
its backlog or working to bring Secretary Shinseki to Memphis to assess
the best way to improve care, I will do everything I can-as I always
have-to support the dedicated Memphians who put their lives on the line
and to see that they are treated with dignity and respect and that they
receive the finest medical care possible.
Extending TennCare to More Tennesseans
I am committed to ensuring that all Tennesseans are able to take
advantage of the important protections made available by President
Obama's Affordable Care Act (the ACA), not just citizens who already
have health coverage. That's why I sent another letter to Governor Bill
Haslam yesterday offering to help him expand TennCare, our state's
Medicaid program, to more Tennesseans who cannot afford to purchase
coverage and are unable to take advantage of many protections in the
ACA because of the Governor's inaction.
By failing to expand TennCare, Tennessee is conveying a message that
the State has little concern for the neediest, sickest, and most
desperate of its citizens. While this may not be the Governor's
intention, the reality of the situation remains that thousands of
Tennessee's poorest citizens are going without the health coverage that
their counterparts in 27 other states (nine of which are led by
Republican governors) are receiving. It's unnecessary and it's
preventable. Governor Haslam should work with the Tennessee General
Assembly and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to
resolve this problem. I stand ready to assist him in making that happen.
Stimulating Economic Recovery and Growth in Memphis
This week, President Obama's administration selected Memphis to be one
of the first communities in America eligible for a new technical
assistance program called "311 for Cities," which is aimed at helping
grow our economy and reduce unemployment. I hope we are able to make
the most of the President's selection and use these new resources as a
stepping stone on the path towards getting a Promise Zone designation
as soon as possible.
Celebrating Memphis in May
The Memphis in May International Festival is a special time for our
city, and it draws people from around the world. From the music
festival to the World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest and to the
crown jewel of Memphis in May - the Sunset Symphony - Memphis in May
has something for everyone and everyone has a great time in the Bluff
City. On Monday, I spoke on the House Floor to congratulate the
organizers of the festival and to thank all the volunteers for their
tireless work to make this year's Memphis in May a success. You can
watch my speech here
.
Remembering the Late Reverend Frank McRae
This week, our city lost one of its greatest sons and leaders, Reverend
Frank McRae, who took urban ministry to new heights in Memphis. Before
Dr. King was assassinated, Frank marched alongside him and the
sanitation workers. And after the assassination, Frank led a group of
ministers to City Hall to urge the mayor to settle the strike.
Rev. McRae knew that the church needed to do good deeds, and that it
needed to help people. He founded Friends for Life, which helped people
with AIDS and HIV, and he helped found the Memphis Interfaith
Association that provided food and clothing to people in need. He
opened the doors of his church and made it into a soup kitchen and
pantry for the less fortunate.
I am fortunate to have known Frank McRae and Memphis is fortunate he
came our way. I was pleased to be able to honor his life on the House
Floor earlier this week, and you can watch my speech here
. He was a great man who helped make Memphis the City of Good Abode,
as it is well known. Rev. McRae will be greatly missed by the Bluff
City, his wife, his two children and his three step-children.
Finding Justice for the Unfairly Incarcerated
Earlier this week, I spoke to a large crowd at a briefing on the
President's use of his executive clemency power that was hosted by the
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Families Against Mandatory
Minimums (FAMM). At the briefing, we heard from four Americans whose
sentences were commuted by previous Presidents about how they are
making the most of their second chances by leading full lives and
contributing to our society. After the briefing, I met with Kemba
Smith, whose sentence was commuted by President Clinton, and her son
Armani. She described how she has turned her life around since being
given a fresh start.
Executive clemency is one of the few unfettered powers the President
has under the Constitution. Unfortunately though, President Obama has
one of the lowest rates in recent history of issuing pardons and
commutations. One of my top priorities over the last few years has been
urging the President to use this power more broadly to bring justice to
those who should not still be serving lengthy sentences for non-violent
drug crimes. Slowly but surely, we are making progress.
In 2010, the President signed the Fair Sentencing Act into law, which
dramatically reduced the sentencing disparity between crack and
cocaine. That was a major achievement, but because it wasn't made
retroactive, the people who were sentenced prior to that law are now
sitting in prison serving sentences that Congress has found void
against public policy. For these men and women, every day that they
continue to sit in prison, separated from their families and their
communities, is an injustice-and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s "fierce
urgency of now" demands that we help them immediately.
Just a few weeks ago, the President's Department of Justice announced a
new clemency initiative aimed at finding more deserving candidates for
Presidential pardons and commutations. I am glad that we are slowly
breaking through and the President is making more-and bigger-moves to
bring justice to thousands of Americans serving unfair sentences.
Recognizing the Monuments Men
I have long been an advocate for the arts as well as for our brave men
and women in uniform, so I did not hesitate to support the
first-of-its-kind 2007 Congressional bill to recognize the work that
the Monuments Men did to protect and preserve artistically and
culturally important artifacts that the Nazi's planned to destroy
during World War II.
On Monday, the House voted to approve the Monuments Men Recognition
Act, which I cosponsored with Congresswoman Kay Granger (a Republican
from Texas), and the Senate voted to pass it this week as well. Now
that it has passed both houses of Congress, our bipartisan legislation
will ensure that the World War II unit known as the Monuments Men
receives a Congressional Gold Medal, Congress' highest recognition for
distinguished achievements and contributions. After single-handedly
securing nearly half the signatures required and being credited by
Representative Granger as the person responsible for the bill's
passage, I am glad to see that the Monuments Men are being recognized
by Congress. Just before the bill passed the House, I spoke in support
of it on the House Floor. A video of my speech is available here
.
Protecting Privacy and Ending Domestic Spying
This week, the House of Representatives voted to pass a bill that would
end the bulk collection of telephone metadata of Americans. The bill
was the result of bipartisan negotiations and compromise, and I was
pleased to support it. I will continue working, as I have been with my
FISA Court legislation
, to protect personal privacy and liberty while keeping our
nation safe and secure from terrorists.
Working to Bring Back Our Girls and Preventing Human Trafficking
Last month, more than 200 young Nigerian girls were kidnapped by
terrorists from the Boko Haram group. In recent years, Boko Haram has
targeted churches, schools, mosques, government installations,
educational institutions, and entertainment venues across Nigeria to
strike fear in local communities.
Earlier this month, I reached out to the U.S. Department of State and
the House Foreign Affairs Committee to see what we could do to help
rescue the kidnapped girls and was pleased when President Obama's
Administration announced that they had sent an interdisciplinary team
as well as troops to help save these girls. I've also helped lead a
bipartisan Congressional letter to Secretary of State John Kerry
stressing our commitment and support of the Administration's efforts to
help resolve this tragedy, and I am glad that this week the House
passed H. Res. 573, a resolution condemning these kidnappings and
encouraging efforts to Bring Back Our Girls.
As a member of the Human Trafficking Caucus, I am concerned about the
trafficking of children both throughout the world and right here in the
United States. Frequently, law enforcement and the public encounter
difficulties in identifying human trafficking victims. Worse still, the
victims of this terrible and dehumanizing crime are themselves often
treated as criminals, dropped into a judicial system not equipped to
provide the health and protective services that these victims often
need. That's why I was pleased to support several bipartisan bills this
week seeking to end child sex trafficking by strengthening
investigation and prosecution tools and providing support services to
victims.
Strengthening our Nation's Freight Infrastructure
I was proud to vote in favor of the bipartisan Water Resources Reform
and Development Act (WRRDA) of 2014 when it passed the House this week.
This bill is an important step in the right direction towards
strengthening our nation's freight infrastructure, the lifeblood of our
local Memphis economy. As a member of the House Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee, I will continue to advocate for Memphis
whenever the House considers important measures that invest in the
roads, rivers, runways, and railways that are integral in keeping our
local economic engine running.
Make Sure to Claim Unclaimed Property
The State of Tennessee maintains a searchable database of unclaimed
property, which can include bank accounts, stocks and dividends, wages,
refunds, insurance payments, gift certificates, credit balances and
overpayments, and a number of other things. There is no cost for
accessing the database, and you may find that you are owed money or
property. If you have not searched the database yet or if you haven't
searched in a while, you can visit https://www.claimittn.gov
and see for yourself whether the state is holding
any property or assets for you. And you may pass this information along
to your friends and family as well!
I hope you have a great Memorial Day!
As always, I remain.
Most sincerely,
Steve Cohen

Fighting
for
Veterans
Who
Fought
For
Us
With
Memorial
Day
approaching,
President
Obama
spoke
to
the
nation
on
Wednesday
about
widespread
reports
calling
into
question
the
management
of
and
quality
of
care
provided
at
Veterans
Affairs
Medical
Centers
(VAMCs)
in
several
states
including
Tennessee.
Both
President
Obama
and
I
are
committed
to
ensuring
that
those
who
risked
life
and
limb
for
this
country
receive
the
finest
care
available
when
they
come
home&#8212;and
I
am
very
disappointed
with
these
reports.
With
more
and
more
of
our
nation&#8217;s
veterans
returning
from
combat
suffering
from
PTSD
and
other
serious
conditions,
I
will
continue
working
with
President
Obama
to
make
sure
they
are
treated
with
the
utmost
respect
and
receive
timely,
high-quality
care
at
the
Memphis
VAMC
or
any
other
VAMC.
Immediately
after
the
VA
Inspector
General
released
a
report
documenting
three
deaths
at
the
Memphis
VAMC
that
may
have
been
preventable,
I
invited
Secretary
of
Veterans
Affairs
Eric
K.
Shinseki
to
visit
our
city&#8217;s
VAMC
so
that
he
could
see
firsthand
the
problems
there
and
better
understand
the
needs
of
the
Memphis
veteran
community.
This
week,
I
also
voted
to
pass
bipartisan
legislation
that
would
give
the
Secretary
of
Veterans
Affairs
broader
authority
to
remove
failing
or
ineffective
VAMC
employees
from
their
posts.
People
who
provide
substandard
care
to
our
soldiers
don&#8217;t
deserve
to
be
rewarded
by
being
able
to
keep
their
jobs,
they
should
be
punished.
Whether
fighting
to
ensure
the
VA
has
the
resources
necessary
to
reduce
its
backlog
or
working
to
bring
Secretary
Shinseki
to
Memphis
to
assess
the
best
way
to
improve
care,
I
will
do
everything
I
can&#8212;as
I
always
have&#8212;to
support
the
dedicated
Memphians
who
put
their
lives
on
the
line
and
to
see
that
they
are
treated
with
dignity
and
respect
and
that
they
receive
the
finest
medical
care
possible.
Extending
TennCare
to
More
Tennesseans
I
am
committed
to
ensuring
that
all
Tennesseans
are
able
to
take
advantage
of
the
important
protections
made
available
by
President
Obama&#8217;s
Affordable
Care
Act
(the
ACA),
not
just
citizens
who
already
have
health
coverage.
That&#8217;s
why
I
sent
another
letter
to
Governor
Bill
Haslam
yesterday
offering
to
help
him
expand
TennCare,
our
state&#8217;s
Medicaid
program,
to
more
Tennesseans
who
cannot
afford
to
purchase
coverage
and
are
unable
to
take
advantage
of
many
protections
in
the
ACA
because
of
the
Governor&#8217;s
inaction.
By
failing
to
expand
TennCare,
Tennessee
is
conveying
a
message
that
the
State
has
little
concern
for
the
neediest,
sickest,
and
most
desperate
of
its
citizens.
While
this
may
not
be
the
Governor&#8217;s
intention,
the
reality
of
the
situation
remains
that
thousands
of
Tennessee&#8217;s
poorest
citizens
are
going
without
the
health
coverage
that
their
counterparts
in
27
other
states
(nine
of
which
are
led
by
Republican
governors)
are
receiving.
It&#8217;s
unnecessary
and
it&#8217;s
preventable.
Governor
Haslam
should
work
with
the
Tennessee
General
Assembly
and
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
to
resolve
this
problem.
I
stand
ready
to
assist
him
in
making
that
happen.
Stimulating
Economic
Recovery
and
Growth
in
Memphis
This
week,
President
Obama&#8217;s
administration
selected
Memphis
to
be
one
of
the
first
communities
in
America
eligible
for
a
new
technical
assistance
program
called
&#8220;311
for
Cities,&#8221;
which
is
aimed
at
helping
grow
our
economy
and
reduce
unemployment.
I
hope
we
are
able
to
make
the
most
of
the
President&#8217;s
selection
and
use
these
new
resources
as
a
stepping
stone
on
the
path
towards
getting
a
Promise
Zone
designation
as
soon
as
possible.
Celebrating
Memphis
in
May
The
Memphis
in
May
International
Festival
is
a
special
time
for
our
city,
and
it

around

Memphis
in
May
has
something
for
everyone
and
everyone
has
a
great
time
in
the
Bluff
City.
On
Monday,
I
spoke
on
the
House
Floor
to
congratulate
the
organizers
of
the
festival
and
to
thank
all
the
volunteers
for
their
tireless
work
to
make
this
year&#8217;s
Memphis
in
May
a
success.

Remembering
the
Late
Reverend
Frank
McRae
This
week,
our
city
lost
one
of
its
greatest
sons
and
leaders,
Reverend
Frank
McRae,
who
took
urban
ministry
to
new
heights
in
Memphis.
Before
Dr.
King
was
assassinated,
Frank
marched
alongside
him
and
the
sanitation
workers.
And
after
the
assassination,
Frank
led
a
group
of
ministers
to
City
Hall
to
urge
the
mayor
to
settle
the
strike.
Rev.
McRae
knew
that
the
church
needed
to
do
good
deeds,
and
that
it
needed
to
help
people.
He
founded
Friends
for
Life,
which
helped
people
with
AIDS
and
HIV,
and
he
helped
found
the
Memphis
Interfaith
Association
that
provided
food
and
clothing
to
people
in
need.
He
opened
the
doors
of
his
church
and
made
it
into
a
soup
kitchen
and
pantry
for
the
less
fortunate.
I
am
fortunate
to
have
known
Frank
McRae
and
Memphis
is
fortunate
he
came
our
way.
I
was
pleased
to
be
able
to
honor
his
life
on
the
House
Floor
earlier
this
week,
and
you
can
watch
my
speech
here .
He
was
a
great
man
who
helped
make
Memphis
the
City
of
Good
Abode,
as
it
is
well
known.
Rev.
McRae
will
be
greatly
missed
by
the
Bluff
City,
his
wife,
his
two
children
and
his
three
step-children.
Finding
Justice
for
the
Unfairly
Incarcerated
Earlier
this
week,
I
spoke
to
a
large
crowd
at
a
briefing
on
the
President&#8217;s
use
of
his
executive
clemency
power
that
was
hosted
by
the
American
Civil
Liberties
Union
(ACLU)
and
Families
Against
Mandatory
Minimums
(FAMM).
At
the
briefing,
we
heard
from
four
Americans
whose
sentences
were
commuted
by
previous
Presidents
about
how
they
are
making
the
most
of
their
second
chances
by
leading
full
lives
and
contributing
to
our
society.
After
the
briefing,
I
met
with
Kemba
Smith,
whose
sentence
was
commuted
by
President
Clinton,
and
her
son
Armani.
She
described
how
she
has
turned
her
life
around
since
being
given
a
fresh
start.
Executive
clemency
is
one
of
the
few
unfettered
powers
the
President
has
under
the
Constitution.
Unfortunately
though,
President
Obama
has
one
of
the
lowest
rates
in
recent
history
of
issuing
pardons
and
commutations.
One
of
my
top
priorities
over
the
last
few
years
has
been
urging
the
President
to
use
this
power
more
broadly
to
bring
justice
to
those
who
should
not
still
be
serving
lengthy
sentences
for
non-violent
drug
crimes.
Slowly
but
surely,
we
are
making
progress.
In
2010,
the
President
signed
the
Fair
Sentencing
Act
into
law,
which
dramatically
reduced
the
sentencing
disparity
between
crack
and
cocaine.
That
was
a
major
achievement,
but
because
it
wasn&#8217;t
made
retroactive,
the
people
who
were
sentenced
prior
to
that
law
are
now
sitting
in
prison
serving
sentences
that
Congress
has
found
void
against
public
policy.
For
these
men
and
women,
every
day
that
they
continue
to
sit
in
prison,
separated
from
their
families
and
their
communities,
is
an
injustice&#8212;and
Dr.
Martin
Luther
King,
Jr.&#8217;s
&#8220;fierce
urgency
of
now&#8221;
demands
that
we
help
them
immediately.
Just
a
few
weeks
ago,
the
President&#8217;s
Department
of
Justice
announced
a
new
clemency
initiative
aimed
at
finding
more
deserving
candidates
for
Presidential
pardons
and
commutations.
I
am
glad
that
we
are
slowly
breaking
through
and
the
President
is
making
more&#8212;and
bigger&#8212;moves
to
bring
justice
to
thousands
of
Americans
serving
unfair
sentences.
Recognizing
the
Monuments
Men
I
have
long
been
an
advocate
for
the
arts
as
well
as
for
our
brave
men
and
women
in
uniform,
so
I
did
not
hesitate
to
support
the
first-of-its-kind
2007
Congressional
bill
to
recognize
the
work
that
the
Monuments
Men
did
to
protect
and
preserve
artistically
and
culturally
important
artifacts
that
the
Nazi&#8217;s
planned
to
destroy
during
World
War
II.
On
Monday,
the
House
voted
to
approve
the
Monuments
Men
Recognition
Act,
which
I
cosponsored
with
Congresswoman
Kay
Granger
(a
Republican
from
Texas),
and
the
Senate
voted
to
pass
it
this
week
as
well.
Now
that
it
has
passed
both
houses
of
Congress,
our
bipartisan
legislation
will
ensure
that
the
World
War
II
unit
known
as
the
Monuments
Men
receives
a
Congressional
Gold
Medal,
Congress&#8217;
highest
recognition
for
distinguished
achievements
and
contributions.
After
single-handedly
securing
nearly
half
the
signatures
required
and
being
credited
by
Representative
Granger
as
the
person
responsible
for
the
bill&#8217;s
passage,
I
am
glad
to
see
that
the
Monuments
Men
are
being
recognized
by
Congress.
Just
before
the
bill
passed
the
House,
I
spoke
in
support
of
it
on
the
House
Floor.
A
video
of
my
speech
is
available
here .
Protecting
Privacy
and
Ending
Domestic
Spying
This
week,
the
House
of
Representatives
voted
to
pass
a
bill
that
would
end
the
bulk
collection
of
telephone
metadata
of
Americans.
The
bill
was
the
result
of
bipartisan
negotiations
and
compromise,
and
I
was
pleased
to
support
it.
I
will
continue
working,
as
I
have
been
with
my
FISA
Court
legislation ,
to
protect
personal
privacy
and
liberty
while
keeping
our
nation
safe
and
secure
from
terrorists.
Working
to
Bring
Back
Our
Girls
and
Preventing
Human
Trafficking
Last
month,
more
than
200
young
Nigerian
girls
were
kidnapped
by
terrorists
from
the
Boko
Haram
group.
In
recent
years,
Boko
Haram
has
targeted
churches,
schools,
mosques,
government
installations,
educational
institutions,
and
entertainment
venues
across
Nigeria
to
strike
fear
in
local
communities.
Earlier
this
month,
I
reached
out
to
the
U.S.
Department
of
State
and
the
House
Foreign
Affairs
Committee
to
see
what
we
could
do
to
help
rescue
the
kidnapped
girls
and
was
pleased
when
President
Obama&#8217;s
Administration
announced
that
they
had
sent
an
interdisciplinary
team
as
well
as
troops
to
help
save
these
girls.
I&#8217;ve
also
helped
lead
a
bipartisan
Congressional
letter
to
Secretary
of
State
John
Kerry
stressing
our
commitment
and
support
of
the
Administration&#8217;s
efforts
to
help
resolve
this
tragedy,
and
I
am
glad
that
this
week
the
House
passed
H.
Res.
573,
a
resolution
condemning
these
kidnappings
and
encouraging
efforts
to
Bring
Back
Our
Girls.
As
a
member
of
the
Human
Trafficking
Caucus,
I
am
concerned
about
the
trafficking
of
children
both
throughout
the
world
and
right
here
in
the
United
States.
Frequently,
law
enforcement
and
the
public
encounter
difficulties
in
identifying
human
trafficking
victims.
Worse
still,
the
victims
of
this
terrible
and
dehumanizing
crime
are
themselves
often
treated
as
criminals,
dropped
into
a
judicial
system
not
equipped
to
provide
the
health
and
protective
services
that
these
victims
often
need.
That&#8217;s
why
I
was
pleased
to
support
several
bipartisan
bills
this
week
seeking
to
end
child
sex
trafficking
by
strengthening
investigation
and
prosecution
tools
and
providing
support
services
to
victims.
Strengthening
our
Nation&#8217;s
Freight
Infrastructure
I
was
proud
to
vote
in
favor
of
the
bipartisan
Water
Resources
Reform
and
Development
Act
(WRRDA)
of
2014
when
it
passed
the
House
this
week.
This
bill
is
an
important
step
in
the
right
direction
towards
strengthening
our
nation&#8217;s
freight
infrastructure,
the
lifeblood
of
our
local
Memphis
economy.
As
a
member
of
the
House
Transportation
and
Infrastructure
Committee,
I
will
continue
to
advocate
for
Memphis
whenever
the
House
considers
important
measures
that
invest
in
the
roads,
rivers,
runways,
and
railways
that
are
integral
in
keeping
our
local
economic
engine
running.
Make
Sure
to
Claim
Unclaimed
Property
The
State
of
Tennessee
maintains
a
searchable
database
of
unclaimed
property,
which
can
include
bank
accounts,
stocks
and
dividends,
wages,
refunds,
insurance
payments,
gift
certificates,
credit
balances
and
overpayments,
and
a
number
of
other
things.
There
is
no
cost
for
accessing
the
database,
and
you
may
find
that
you
are
owed
money
or
property.
If
you
have
not
searched
the
database
yet
or
if
you
haven&#8217;t
searched
in
a
while,
you
can
visit
https://www.claimittn.gov
and
see
for
yourself
whether
the
state
is
holding
any
property
or
assets
for
you.
And
you
may
pass
this
information
along
to
your
friends
and
family
as
well!
I
hope
you
have
a
great
Memorial
Day!
As
always,
I
remain.
Most
sincerely,
