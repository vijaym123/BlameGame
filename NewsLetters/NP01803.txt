David Johnson
President Obama asked for your help last night. The Republicans just raised $17.5 million in one single night. We're launching a TRIPLE-MATCH to fight back.
Can you chip in $5 or more?
David -- President Obama asked for your help.
Nancy Pelosi asked for your help.
And we&rsquo;re still in DEEP trouble -- so we&rsquo;re asking one more time.
The Republicans just shattered every fundraising record in the books: They brought in $17.5 MILLION in one single night.
We won&rsquo;t sugarcoat this: If you can&rsquo;t respond, we&rsquo;re in danger of getting buried under all that dirty corporate cash.
That&rsquo;s why President Obama wrote you: You&rsquo;re our last hope. Will you step up before tomorrow&rsquo;s quarterly deadline?
24 HOURS LEFT: ALL GIFTS TRIPLE-MATCHED! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
With a wave of grassroots support, we can stand up to the Republicans' wealthy financiers and WIN. Let&rsquo;s show the Republicans what we&rsquo;re made of!
