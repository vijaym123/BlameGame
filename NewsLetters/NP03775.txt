Like so many Ohioans preparing to celebrate the holidays and ring
in the new year, I have spent a lot of time reflecting on what the past
year has brought us.
This past week, Congress ended its work for the year, and the new
Congress will be sworn in after the first of the year. I am hopeful the
new Congress will be more productive and focused more on issues that
affect us as Ohioans and Americans.
Last week, I also hosted one of our monthly telephone town hall
meetings with thousands of Ohioans from all walks of life and also had
an employee town hall in northeast Ohio with factory workers,
administrative staff and executives. There were lots of points of view
but also a common thread to much of what I heard. Ohioans are tired of
gridlock in Washington, and they want Congress to get things done that
help them and their families.
I agree with them, and that's why I've
worked again this past year with folks on both sides of the aisle to
accomplish important things for the people of Ohio, even in a very
partisan atmosphere.
Even in a Congress with so much gridlock, I have remained focused on
solutions and addressing the issues I hear about from people all across
Ohio -- from protecting Lake Erie to helping people connect with jobs,
to removing regulatory roadblocks for Ohio's small business owners
struggling in a weak economy.
Fighting for Ohio's Workers and Jobs
My top priority remains boosting the Ohio economy and creating
an environment where new jobs can thrive. In the 113th Congress, I had
15 of my bills signed into law, as well as a number of amendments and
resolutions. I also introduced 69 bills to help Ohio.
Among other accomplishments, I've successfully fought for Ohio workers
who are being hurt by the unfair trade practices of our competitors
around the world. For example, we were recently able to win a victory
before the International Trade Commission to crack down
on countries that
illegally dump their steel in the U.S. market, hurting Ohio steel
workers.
I've also worked to ensure that all Ohioans have the skills they need
to take advantage of the new jobs that are coming to our state. When
I'm on the road in Ohio, I often hear that employers are having trouble
finding workers with the skills needed to fill available jobs. That's
why workforce training has been a major focus of mine, and I was
pleased when major provisions of my CAREER Act
were signed
into law. These provisions will help train Ohioans for and connect them
with good-paying jobs.
Improving Government Efficiency and Transparency
I'm also committed to making Washington do all that it can to ensure
that your taxpayer dollars are not wasted. Earlier this year, my
Digital Accountability and Transparency (DATA) Act
was signed into law. The DATA Act
allows taxpayers and lawmakers to track the dollars spent by federal
agencies and more easily identify waste, fraud, and abuse in order to
create a more efficient government. It expands the Federal Funding
Accountability and Transparency Act to require full disclosure of all
federal agency expenditures.
Boosting Ohio's Resources
Closer to home, it's crucial that we're protecting Lake Erie and Ohio's
other freshwater bodies for both their environmental and economic
benefits to our state. I was pleased when my legislation to combat
harmful algal blooms, the Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia Research and
Control Amendments Act
, was signed into law.
I was able to create a specific
section for the Great Lakes that will ensure federal agencies
appropriately prioritize efforts to protect Lake Erie and other
freshwaters.
Protecting National Security and Ohio Military Installations
Ohio also plays a critical role in ensuring our national
defense capabilities are second to none.
This year's National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) includes several
of my provisions to strengthen Ohio's military installations including
my amendment
to improve Wright Patt's Air Force Research Lab's ability to hire
science, technology, engineering, and math bachelor's and master's
degree students directly into the lab.
As part of my ongoing efforts to support C-130 modernization
, I co-sponsored an amendment to the NDAA that would allow the
Air Force to use alternative programs and funding to modernize the
C-130 aircraft fleet.
The NDAA also provided critical funding for the Joint Systems
Manufacturing Center in Lima, ensuring that the important national
security work done at the plant can continue.
Advocating On Behalf Of Ohioans, Helping Solve Problems, and Getting
Results
Finally, an important part of my job is to help Ohioans navigate their
way through a vast federal bureaucracy. As a senator, I believe I was
hired as an advocate for fellow Ohioans when they need assistance in
their dealings with federal agencies. In 2014, our casework team worked
on over 2,900 new cases for Ohioans who came to our office in need of
aid. We were able to resolve over 74% of all of these cases favorably.

some of our casework success stories.
If you have any casework questions, please call our toll-free number
for more information: 1-800-205-6446 (OHIO) or e-mail our team at
casework@portman.senate.gov.
I'm proud of our record this past Congress, but I believe we can
accomplish even more in the months to come with the new leadership of
the Senate.
No matter what party is in charge or how divisive
Washington can sometimes be, I will always put the needs of the men and
women of Ohio first.
Wishing you and your family a Merry Christmas and a safe and happy
holiday season.
All best,

Like
so
many
Ohioans
preparing
to
celebrate
the
holidays
and
ring
in
the
new
year,
I
have
spent
a
lot
of
time
reflecting
on
what
the
past
year
has
brought
us.
This
past
week,
Congress
ended
its
work
for
the
year,
and
the
new
Congress
will
be
sworn
in
after
the
first
of
the
year.
I
am
hopeful
the
new
Congress
will
be
more
productive
and
focused
more
on
issues
that
affect
us
as
Ohioans
and
Americans.
Last
week,
I
also
hosted
one
of
our
monthly
telephone
town
hall
meetings
with
thousands
of
Ohioans
from
all
walks
of
life
and
also
had
an
employee
town
hall
in
northeast
Ohio
with
factory
workers,
administrative
staff
and
executives.
There
were
lots
of
points
of
view
but
also
a
common
thread
to
much
of
what
I
heard.
Ohioans
are
tired
of
gridlock
in
Washington,
and
they
want
Congress
to
get
things
done
that
help
them
and
their
families.
I
agree
with
them,
and
that's
why
I've
worked
again
this
past
year
with
folks
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
to
accomplish
important
things
for
the
people
of
Ohio,
even
in
a
very
partisan
atmosphere.
Even
in
a
Congress
with
so
much
gridlock,
I
have
remained
focused
on
solutions
and
addressing
the
issues
I
hear
about
from
people
all
across
Ohio
--
from
protecting
Lake
Erie
to
helping
people
connect
with
jobs,
to
removing
regulatory
roadblocks
for
Ohio's
small
business
owners
struggling
in
a
weak
economy.
Fighting
for
Ohio&#8217;s
Workers
and
Jobs
My
top
priority
remains
boosting
the
Ohio
economy
and
creating
an
environment
where
new
jobs
can
thrive.
In
the
113th
Congress,
I
had
15
of
my
bills
signed
into
law,
as
well
as
a
number
of
amendments
and
resolutions.
I
also
introduced
69
bills
to
help
Ohio.
Among
other
accomplishments,
I've
successfully
fought
for
Ohio
workers
who
are
being
hurt
by
the
unfair
trade
practices
of
our
competitors
around
the
world.
For
example,
we
were
recently
able
to
win
a
victory
before
the
International
Trade
Commission
to
crack
down
on
countries
that
illegally
dump
their
steel
in
the
U.S.
market,
hurting
Ohio
steel
workers.
I've
also
worked
to
ensure
that
all
Ohioans
have
the
skills
they
need
to
take
advantage
of
the
new
jobs
that
are
coming
to
our
state.
When
I'm
on
the
road
in
Ohio,
I
often
hear
that
employers
are
having
trouble
finding
workers
with
the
skills
needed
to
fill
available
jobs.
That's
why
workforce
training
has
been
a
major
focus
of
mine,
and
I
was
pleased
when
major
provisions
of
my
CAREER
Act
were
signed
into
law.
These
provisions
will
help
train
Ohioans
for
and
connect
them
with
good-paying
jobs.
Improving
Government
Efficiency
and
Transparency
I'm
also
committed
to
making
Washington
do
all
that
it
can
to
ensure
that
your
taxpayer
dollars
are
not
wasted.
Earlier
this
year,
my
Digital
Accountability
and
Transparency
(DATA)
Act
was
signed
into
law.
The
DATA
Act
allows
taxpayers
and
lawmakers
to
track
the
dollars
spent
by
federal
agencies
and
more
easily
identify
waste,
fraud,
and
abuse
in
order
to
create
a
more
efficient
government.
It
expands
the
Federal
Funding
Accountability
and
Transparency
Act
to
require
full
disclosure
of
all
federal
agency
expenditures.
Boosting
Ohio&#8217;s
Resources
Closer
to
home,
it's
crucial
that
we're
protecting
Lake
Erie
and
Ohio's
other
freshwater
bodies
for
both
their
environmental
and
economic
benefits
to
our
state.
I
was
pleased
when
my
legislation
to
combat
harmful
algal
blooms,
the
Harmful
Algal
Blooms
and
Hypoxia
Research
and
Control
Amendments
Act ,
was
signed
into
law.
I
was
able
to
create
a
specific
section
for
the
Great
Lakes
that
will
ensure
federal
agencies
appropriately
prioritize
efforts
to
protect
Lake
Erie
and
other
freshwaters.
Protecting
National
Security
and
Ohio
Military
Installations
Ohio
also
plays
a
critical
role
in
ensuring
our
national
defense
capabilities
are
second
to
none.
This
year's
National
Defense
Authorization

(NDAA)
includes
several
of
my

to

Ohio's

including
my

Wright

ability

science,

math
bachelor's

students
directly

the
lab.
As

C-130

the
NDAA

the

The
