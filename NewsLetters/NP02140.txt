Friend,
Real quick
wanted to be sure you had seen this good news. Recently, there was controversy at Robins Air Force Base in Georgia when a complaint was made over Airmen saying "have a blessed day as part of their greeting to visitors at the security gate entrance.
The phrase was not part of official protocol, but rather a traditional southern phrase offered voluntarily by the greeters.
After review, the Air Force reinforced that the phrase is perfectly acceptable under the new AFI 1-1 policy protecting religious freedom. You can read the Robins Air Force Bases statement on their facebook page,
here .
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. I will keep working to protect the ability of our men and women in uniform to exercise the very freedoms they are fighting for. To stay up to date on these issues,
