The Power of School Choice
On Monday we will be hosting Choosing Excellence
, a forum bringing educational
leaders from across the country together to discuss the power of school
choice.
Each child in America deserves access to the very best education so
they can maximize their potential. Sadly, that's not happening in every
community for every child, and we simply must do better.
When parents
have a choice, kids have a chance, and I will continue working, through
my CHOICE Act, seat on the Senate Education Committee and other ways,
to put educational decisions back in the hands of parents and teachers.
To RSVP email ChoiceForum@scott.senate.gov!
The IRS is a Mess, and the White House Wants to Increase Their Budget?
Today brought reports that the IRS has rehired thousands of former
employees with troubled records, showing once again that the agency is
a mess. I joined Greta Van Susteren on FOX
earlier this week to discuss how in
the world the President thinks that pouring more money into the IRS, as
his budget calls for, can possibly be a smart use of taxpayer dollars.
I also questioned the IRS Commissioner in Finance Committee
this week about his agency's
targeting of conservative groups, and what he plans to do to stop this
from ever happening again. As the committee with oversight of the IRS,
the Finance Committee will continue to keep the pressure on this year.
Supporting our Veterans
I was proud to join my Senate colleagues in voting for the Clay Hunt
Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act to help improve mental
health services for our nation's veterans.
We must support those who defend us, and this important bill does so by
improving programs at the Veterans Health Administration, aiding
veterans in their transition to civilian life, and increasing access to
health care for our veterans. I will continue working to ensure we keep
our nation's promises to our veterans, and look forward to the
President signing this important legislation into law.
We also announced that we will be holding two veterans job and resource
fairs
next month - March 9th in North Charleston and March
25th in Greenville. To register for one of the upcoming veterans job
and resource fairs or for more information, call my offices at (843)
727-4525 (Lowcountry), (803) 771-6112 (Midlands) or (864) 233-5366
(Upstate).
Black History Month
I enjoyed visiting with the students of Morehouse College and the
Atlanta University Center Consortium this week as we celebrate Black
History Month. As the Associated Press
reported, I discussed "conservative policies on education,
spending and taxes, saying that his party's approach, not the
president's, will help the nation and the GOP expand its reach into
minority communities."
