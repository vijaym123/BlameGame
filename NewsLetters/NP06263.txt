Over the last few decades, the federal government
has regulated the activities of the American people in increasingly
minute detail.
This micro-regulatory state is strangling
businesses and preventing new hiring.
Even worse, this degree of
regulation is incompatible with a free people enjoying a limited
representative government.
I support numerous pieces of legislation that
would reduce the regulatory burdens on Americans and protect the
individual freedom of all.
Bills like the REINS Act (H.R. 367),
which would require Congressional approval for new major regulations,
would be a good first step to stopping new harmful regulations.
Unsurprisingly, the allies of big government and special interests in the
U.S. Senate have blocked the bills that the House has passed to
address this problem.
Regulations are supposed to make peoples
lives better, but over time bad intentions have replaced that lofty
goal and now regulations exist mainly as job security for hordes of
bureaucrats and a way for the politically connected to secure undeserved
privilege.
Predictably, this leads to diminished job opportunities
and higher costs for the average American.
Sadly, it is the low
skilled, the young new worker, and those who already suffer from
chronic unemployment who are harmed the most.
The story of
America is the story of someone starting out with nothing and achieving
their American Dream.
The secret to our success has always been
our free and dynamic society that enables everyone to fully realize
their unique human potential.
It is time for Congress to decide
whether it values people or paperwork.
Its time we stopped
regulating the American Dream out of existence.
