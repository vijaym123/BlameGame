One Minute Speech: The President Refuses to Secure the Border
The President wants taxpayers to shell out $3.7 billion to deal with a problem he created. His proposal does not solve the problem.
Without a secure border, this is just the beginning.
Members of both parties must demand that the President finally secure the border and faithfully execute the law.
This is a matter of national security and national sovereignty.
