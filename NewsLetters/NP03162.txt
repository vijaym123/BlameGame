The new Republican Congress has ALREADY attacked Social Security, Obamacare, AND abortion rights.
Worse: The
New York Times
reports GOP megadonors are pledging to buy the 2016 elections.
That means the Republicans could win the White House AND Congress -- an unparalleled disaster.
You can stop them.
If we can get 50,000 Democrats to renew their membership by the first FEC deadline of the year in 72 hours, we&rsquo;ll keep pace and win the White House and Senate. But if we can&rsquo;t, the GOP could gain an insurmountable early lead!
Will you renew your DSCC membership by the crucial FEC deadline in 72 hours?
