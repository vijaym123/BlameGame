New York Times:
GOP budget plan &ldquo;a recipe for increasing both poverty and inequality&rdquo;
RENEW NOW TO FIGHT BACK &gt;&gt;
David -- The
New York Times
has some harsh words for Republicans&rsquo; just-released budget proposal. And so do we:
It would make huge cuts to Medicare and Medicaid
It would let the ultra-wealthy keep getting away with their tax loopholes
It would take health care away from 16.4 million people by repealing the Affordable Care Act (&ldquo;Obamacare&rdquo;)
In short, the Republican budget would be a DISASTER for seniors and working families.
But the scariest part is, the GOP&rsquo;s deep cuts
could very well become law!
Republicans control both houses of Congress -- and they&rsquo;ll push through their catastrophic budget
unless you fight back.
