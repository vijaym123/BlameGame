This week, on the 12th anniversary of the Iraq War, I joined with Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI-02) to launch the Congressional Post-9/11 Veterans Caucus. The Congressional Post-9/11 Veterans Caucus will include a bipartisan group of Members who have served in the military after 9/11, and who are dedicated to issues related to our newest generation of veterans. The caucus legislative agenda will focus on the 2.8 million veterans who have served and deployed since 9/11, and provide a forum for this new generation of veterans to voice their concerns and ideas.
Congress has a duty to honor the service of the those who wear
and wore
our countrys uniform and sacrificed so that we may enjoy the blessings of freedom. Thousands of Americans have served selflessly around the world and many of them carry emotional, psychological and physical scars from their service, which raises many complicated public policy challenges, such as helping Veterans to transition to civilian life, confront mental health challenges and find employment. In recent years, Congress has passed legislation to expand Veterans health care options, hold the VA more accountable and improve access to mental health services. But we have much more work to do and Im honored to join my colleague Congresswoman Gabbard to confront these challenges and do right by our Nations true heroes and their families.
In addition to launching the Post-9/11 Veterans Caucus, the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Oversight and Management Efficiency, which I chair, held a hearing Wednesday on the security implications of small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS or drones) in the domestic airspace and technologies to mitigate associated threats. Some predict that 400,000 small UAS could be purchased this year. As small UAS continue to proliferate, the threats posed by accidental and malicious operators will increase. Recent examples of a quadcopter crashing on the White House lawn and unidentified small UAS flying over Paris landmarks demonstrate the challenges that law enforcement face.
Lone wolf terrorists, drug smugglers, and foreign spies dont care about FAA rules. DHS must help protect against these bad actors from perverting this technology for their objectives.
Law enforcement faces a significant challenge in assessing UAS incidents as they occur. It will be impossible to distinguish the accidental from the intentional, the benign from the malicious, said Dr. Todd Humphreys. His research at the University of Texas at Austin has shown that small UAS GPS signals can be hijacked.
The former Chief of Safety for the U.S. Air Force, Retired Major General Frederick Roggero, testified that small UAS provide an affordable asymmetric tool to those who want to use them for nefarious purposes. Unfortunately, the Administration has failed to outline a strategy to deal with this threat. Roggero stated technology typically outstrips policies, and this technology has certainly stretched the capacity of the US governments bureaucracy to swiftly provide a counter drone strategy.
This is why we need a comprehensive strategy to deal with the potential homeland security threat that rogue drones could play.
Sincerely,
Scott G. Perry
