Carper's Connection
October 31, 2014
Dear Friends,
I first fell in love with Delaware as I was flying into Dover Air Force
Base and saw how beautiful it was from the window of my military
transport aircraft. That was back in 1973 during my first year in the
U.S. Navy. I was instantly enamored with the First State and I have
been ever since. The beauty and distinctiveness of Delaware's landscape
and people is something that I deeply admire.
Delaware is a sight to see and the place to be during the fall. From
the rolling hills of the Brandywine River Valley, to the storied Green
in Dover, to apple farms and fall festivals in Sussex County, Delaware
offers endless possibilities for travelers and families seeking the
perfect travel destination.
It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve Delaware. I invite
everyone to come and experience the state that I have come to love so
much. Check out www.visitDelaware.com
to learn more about what you can
explore and discover in Delaware this season.
I also encourage you to share your fall photos this season with me on
Twitter @SenatorCarper
and on Facebook at
facebook.com/tomcarper
.
We hope to see you soon,
