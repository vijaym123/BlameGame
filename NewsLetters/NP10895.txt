Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Although the cherry blossoms are arriving late this year due to the cold weather in Washington, I joined the 2014 Credit Union Cherry Blossom Ten Mile Run preview last week to thank them for the generous donation to the Childrens Miracle Network Hospitals across the country. Two members of my Washington staff participated in the run, and I was glad for an opportunity to publicly recognize the support that the credit union is providing to childrens health and quality care.
I spoke at the 5th Annual Wounded Warrior/Lone Sailor 5K &amp; 10K Run on Saturday to honor our wounded warriors and thank the participants for showing such strong support to our local veterans. Proceeds from the run are helping to support a monument in Baldwin Park, and we broke ground for the new Lone Sailor Navy Memorial following the race. Some of my district staff members participated in this run, and I am grateful to have such dedicated professional staff who assist me in personally supporting these worthy causes and who share my commitment to serve our community.

German Ambassador Peter Ammon joined me, Rep. Tim Walberg from Michigan, and Rep. Randy Hultgren from Illinois, in my office last week to discuss the importance of quality education for all children and the vital role that parents play in their childrens upbringing. It is my desire to see school choice and personal freedom continue to expand around the globe.

Tourism remains vital to Central Floridas economy by supporting thousands of local jobs. Last Wednesday, I met with Florida members from the American Hotel &amp; Lodging Association, including representatives from Central Florida attractions, restaurants, and hotels, to discuss issues important to their industry and our region.
Several constituent groups also met with me in Washington last week, including:
-	Jim Van Rens, from RIEGL USA
-	Advocates for cystic fibrosis care for children
-	Leaders and government representatives from Polk County
-	Local members of the American Orthotic &amp; Prosthetic Association

On Saturday, I participated in the Blue &amp; Gold Awards Banquet for Cub Scout Pack 114 in Orlando. In recognition for their pack's achievements and impact on the community, I presented a flag that had been flown over the Capitol. It is heartening to see the next generation eager to help benefit our community.

Last Saturday, I also joined a team of committed volunteers to dedicate the new KaBOOM playground in Oakland. Built in a single day by community members, local leaders and volunteers from Disney, the KaBOOM playground will be a great asset to the spirit and ambiance of the Town of Oakland.
Your servant,

Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Thousands of taxpayers have received phone calls recently from criminals allegedly calling on behalf of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In an effort to notify constituents and help protect them from falling victim to this fraud, I sent out a letter to our senior citizens with information on how they could avoid this bogus scam. You can
read the full letter here.
As the mail arrived this week, constituents from all over the district called my office to share with me their experiences with fraud and scam calls. If you or a loved one believes they have fallen victim to a scam, please dont hesitate to contact my office at (407) 654-5705.
Constituent Services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
The Department of Labor reported the monthly employment numbers last week, revealing the national unemployment rate remaining at 6.7%. While the unemployment rate has dropped somewhat over the past few years,
the labor force participation rate
continues to reveal a weak labor market that remains unacceptably low.
Do you have family or friends who are currently unemployed, underemployed and have been searching for a better employment opportunity or have given up looking for a job altogether?
Yes
No
I don't know

Response from the
previous survey question:
"Would you support efforts to simplify and flatten our existing tax code, even if it meant certain deductions were repealed in exchange for a lower overall rate and simpler filing system?" Yes - 87%
No - 8%
I don't know - 5%
Legislative Update:
Among Obamacares most job-crushing provisions, redefining a full-time work week ranks near the top.
The 40-hour work week has been called the backbone of the American middle class. Regrettably, Obamacares employer mandate included a 30-hour work week definition that is causing hourly workers to see a reduction in the number of hours they are allowed to work.
In some cases, hourly employees are losing the equivalent of a full weeks paycheck or more each month.
While millions of hourly workers across our nation stand to see hours cut and take home pay reduced, this rule hurts those who can least afford another hit to their bottom line.
The truth is young employees and women will likely bear the greatest burden due to the Obamacare 30-hour rule.
Last week, I joined a bipartisan group in passing the Save American Workers Act, which repeals the shortsighted 30-hour rule from Obamacare.
This critical legislation embraces the dignity of work by safeguarding the 40-hour work week.
