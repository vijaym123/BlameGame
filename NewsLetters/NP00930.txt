Stabenow Introduces Early Pell Promise Act to Help Make College a
Reality for Disadvantaged Students
Last week, Senator Stabenow introduced legislation to make sure that
students who work hard to get into college can enroll regardless of
their financial circumstances. The Early Pell Promise Act will dedicate
two years of Pell Grants to qualifying middle school students, and make
that funding available upon graduation to help pay for tuition at a
college or university. "Every child in America, no matter their
financial situation, should know that if they work hard, study hard,
and get good grades, the opportunity to attend college will be
available after high school," said Senator Stabenow.
