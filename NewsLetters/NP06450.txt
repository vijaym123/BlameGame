HOW SHOULD THE US
RESPOND TO ISIL?
Last night, President Obama
delivered an address to the American people about the threat posed by the
terrorist group the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), and
his strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy this
organization.
Your input would be a valuable resource for me going forward and
Id like to know what you think of the strategy the President
proposed. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I will be
monitoring the issue closely. Please take a minute to share your thoughts on
the President's plan and the U.S. response.
You can share

Do you support President Obama's proposed strategy
to combat ISIL? Why or Why not? *By
