Dear David,
As we prepare to celebrate Thanksgiving with
our families, friends, and loved ones, let us remember to give thanks
to our servicemen and women.
Our nation's men and women in
uniform serve tirelessly, often sacrificing being together with their
families and loved ones over the holidays, in order to protect the
freedoms we enjoy.
This Thanksgiving, I encourage you to take
a few moments and join me in honoring and thanking our brave military
heroes for all that they do to keep America safe.
As
always, I invite you to join the conversation online by sharing your
thoughts on my
Facebook
page, on
Twitter , on
YouTube , and on
Instagram .
Sincere regards,
Washington D.C.
