Yesterday, President Obama asked for your help.
Then Vice President Biden. Then Nancy Pelosi.
They wouldn&rsquo;t email you back-to-back-to-back unless something serious was happening. NPR just reported that a right-wing mega-donor gave
$1O MILLION
to Karl Rove&rsquo;s group.
Control of Congress is at stake. And now Rove has the cash he needs to blast TVs in battleground races with Obama-bashing ads.
Up until now, our Democrats have held on to narrow leads. But we&rsquo;re in for some excruciating losses if we can&rsquo;t fight Rove&rsquo;s Obama-bashing attacks.
David, can you respond to President Obama&rsquo;s ask for help?
