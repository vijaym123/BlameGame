For decades, Social Security has provided millions of Americans the opportunity to retire with dignity. But Boehner&rsquo;s Republicans just voted to undermine this critical program. If you agree we&rsquo;ve got to protect Social Security, we need your signature today:

David --
For generations, we&rsquo;ve made a promise to our seniors:
If you work hard and play by the rules, we&rsquo;ll make sure you get the retirement security you deserve.
Social Security has kept that promise. But Speaker Boehner and House Republicans don&rsquo;t care -- they just voted to undermine Social Security.
With ZERO Democratic support, Republicans rammed through new rules that advocates for seniors are warning could be used to push through cuts to the program. Cheri&rsquo;s standing strong against their radical plan, but she needs your help.
If you agree we&rsquo;ve got to protect Social Security, now&rsquo;s the time to say it:
