Mobile Office
Hours Begin in Philadelphia and Montgomery
County
I am pleased to
announce that my district office will begin mobile office hours at five
locations throughout Philadelphia and Montgomery County starting this
week. The format offers additional opportunities for constituents to
interact face-to-face with Congressional representatives and have their
questions answered. The office hours will continue on a weekly basis
throughout 2015.
During
the office hours, representatives from my district staff will be
available to offer assistance to Second District constituents on
services and issues including Veterans Affairs, Social Security, Internal
Revenue Services, and other matters dealing with federal agencies or
legislative issues.
My staff remains committed to serving every constituent in our
district, but we realize that sometimes its not possible for you to visit
us in our District Office. I hope these mobile office hours will allow
more accessibility and ease for those individuals who may need help
with a federal agency or department, have casework, or are interested in
learning more about my work in the Philadelphia area and
Washington.
Staff in
my Philadelphia office
always remain available in-person and
via telephone to assist constituents.
Mobile office locations will each be open from
10AM-5PM on their specified day and no appointment is
necessary.
