Standing Up to IRS Stonewalling
The Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) has continued to stonewall Congress' investigation
into the Tea Party targeting scandal. Late last week, the agency
informed Congress that it "lost" two years' worth of relevant emails from
the time period of IRS targeting due to an alleged computer crash. But
the American people arent buying the dog-ate-my-homework excuse. I
will continue to demand transparency and accountability from the IRS.
The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, on which I serve,
is holding a hearing next week on this blatant obstruction of justice.
I will demand answers.
I penned an op-ed published in The
Hill on the matter. You can read it
here .
Ranger Station to be
named in honor of Officer Jason Crisp
This week,
the House voted to name a Ranger Station within the Grandfather
Ranger District in Nebo, North Carolina the Jason Crisp Forest Service
Building, in honor of U.S. Forest Service Officer Jason Crisp, who
was killed in the line of duty. I introduced the bill to do so in
April with the support of the entire North Carolina House delegation.
Officer Jason Crisp served his community bravely and selflessly. I'm
grateful for his service and it was an honor to recognize him in this
way. You can watch my speech on the House floor encouraging
support for it

Meeting with Advocates on Capitol
Hill
It was a pleasure to meet Carter, age 8,
a young delegate with Prevent Blindness America. He was in town for
the Eyes on Capitol Hill event to raise awareness for eye health and
safety. I'm always happy to meet with various advocacy groups and hear
their thoughts and concerns.
Prayer for the Abducted
Israeli Teens
Last week, three Israeli
teenage boys, Eyal, Gilad, and Naftali, were abducted by terrorists while
simply walking down the street. Naftatli, 16, is a dual U.S./Israeli
citizen with an American passport. No one should have to live in a
constant state of fear that they may become a victim of terrorism. I ask
that you pray for the safe return of these boys and that those
responsible are held accountable. Debbie and I have spoken with Israeli
Ambassador Ron Dermer about the situation. He is committed to seeing that
these boys are returned home safely and shares our deep commitment to
preserving the important relationship between the U.S. and
Israel.
With Ambassador Ron Dermer and his wife Rhoda.
