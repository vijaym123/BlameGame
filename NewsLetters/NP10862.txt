Friends,
I am always on the lookout for suspicious and overreaching activity
within federal agencies, especially those that threaten jobs in our
state. That's why this week I questioned the Department of Labor and
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) about efforts
to target the southeastern auto industry
.
Recently, OSHA launched a special initiative
targeting auto parts manufactures in Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi.
This industry employs as many as 17,000 workers in Alabama alone, and I
take serious issue with OSHA singling out Alabama's auto manufacturing
industry without any credible cause for doing so.
I recognize that certain aspects of heavy manufacturing are dangerous
and accidents do unfortunately sometimes occur, but I am not aware of a
rash of injuries or deaths in Southeastern facilities. In fact, the
most recent data publicly available shows that Alabama's transportation
manufacturing industry has a lower rate of injury than the national
average.
I had the opportunity to question the Secretary of Labor
, Thomas Perez about his OSHA division's
selective targeting of the southern automotive industry during a
hearing last week. In the hearing, Secretary Perez brazenly claimed
that there was a safety "problem" in
Alabama, only the data he cited was outdated, incomplete, and
irrelevant.
What makes this issue particularly alarming are reports revealing that
union representatives have been accompanying OSHA inspectors into
non-union facilities against the will of the businesses. According to
an article in National Review
, "union organizers are showing
up at (OSHA) inspections" of non-unionized businesses. It is
understandable that many perceive these steps to be part of a
coordinated effort to advance a pro-union agenda within the growing
Southeastern automotive manufacturing industry, which is thriving due
in part to the pro-business environment and skilled workforce found in
our region.
As you may know, employees in Southeastern auto facilities have
repeatedly resisted unionization, most recently in February at the
Volkswagen assembly plant in Chattanooga
. It
is concerning that a federal government agency may be advancing a
pro-union agenda on Southeastern workers that they do not want.
To be clear, we all believe workplace safety, and there are times when
dangerous practices need to be corrected. But what we've seen lately is
a pattern of aggressive, punitive action from OSHA toward a specific
industry. For such a powerful federal agency to use its authority to
intimidate southern businesses and push a pro-union agenda is just
plain wrong.
Our work on this issue is not finished. We will continue to push
Secretary Perez and OSHA to explain the reasoning for targeting the
southern auto manufacturing industry. I will keep you posted.
Restoring Wages
Under ObamaCare, 2.6 million Americans
are at risk of
having their wages cut. Of those, 59% are younger than 34 and 63% are
women. This is due to a provision in the law that reduces the
definition of a full time employee to someone who works more than 30
hours. This had an especially hard effect on wage earners, who may have
seen their hours cut in order for businesses to avoid new tax penalties.
The House on Thursday passed the bipartisan "Save American Workers Act
" which would restore the 40 hour work week
and ease the squeeze on hard working Americans. Under the House-passed
bill, wage earners would no longer have to worry about seeing their
hours cut and paychecks shrink.
The 30 hour rule is just another example of how ObamaCare is hurting
Americans. Countless individuals have already seen their health plans
cancelled, their insurance rates skyrocket, or access to the doctor of
their choice restricted. The "Save American Workers Act" shows that the
House is serious about eliminating some of the harmful effects of
ObamaCare as we work towards a replacement plan over the coming months.
Martha's Mailbag
In this week's "Martha's Mailbag,"
I answered questions from Geneva,
Montgomery, and Wetumpka. I explained how foreign aid makes up less
than one percent of the budget, but it still must be subject to
diligent oversight. I also shared the story of one young woman who
continues to be given the runaround when signing up for ObamaCare.
Finally, I responded to criticism that I was unnecessarily targeting
OSHA.
If you didn't already know, "Martha's Mailbag" is a way for you to ask
questions and get a response via video. You can submit your question by
visiting my Facebook
page, Twitter
, or website
. You can also send a question simply by responding to
this email.
The Week Ahead
The focus in Washington now turns to passing a budget resolution that
would cut $5.1 trillion in spending, repeal ObamaCare, and balance the
budget in ten years. Unfortunately, the Democratic-controlled Senate
has shown no interest in passing a budget at all. On the Appropriations
Committee, we expect to finalize the Military Construction and Veterans
Affairs and Legislative Branch appropriations bills.
Specifically, next week the House is expected to consider:
*	H.R. 1871
, the Baseline Reform Act which changes
the way the Congressional Budget Office and Office of Management and
Budget score legislation;
*	H.R. 1872
, the Budget and Accounting Transparency
Act which brings off-budget programs on-budget to provide more accurate
accounting; and
*	A budget resolution
authored by Rep. Paul Ryan.
As always, please do not hesitate to contact me
if you have a question or if my office can be of help
to you. My staff and I work for you.

Friends,
I
am
always
on

for
suspicious

activity
within
federal
agencies,
especially
those
that
threaten

in
our

That&#8217;s

this

I
questioned
the
Department
of

and
the
Occupational

(OSHA)
about
efforts
to
target
the
southeastern

Georgia,

This

and I
take
serious
issue
with
OSHA
singling
out
Alabama&#8217;s
auto

industry
without
any
credible
cause
for
doing
so.
I

that

unfortunately

but
I
am
not

the
most

data
publicly
available
shows
that
Alabama&#8217;s
transportation
manufacturing
industry
has
a
lower
rate
of
injury
than
the
national
average.
I
had
the
opportunity
to
question
the
Secretary
of
Labor ,
Thomas
Perez
about
his
OSHA
division&#8217;s
selective
targeting
of
the
southern
automotive
industry
during
a
hearing
last
week.
In
the
hearing,
Secretary
Perez
brazenly
claimed
that
there
was
a
safety
&#8220;problem&#8221;
in
Alabama,
only
the
data
he
cited
was
outdated,
incomplete,
and
irrelevant.
What
makes
this
issue
particularly
alarming
are
reports
revealing
that
union
representatives
have
been
accompanying
OSHA
inspectors
into
non-union
facilities
against
the
will
of
the
businesses.
According
to
an
article
in
National
Review ,
&#8220;union
organizers
are
showing
up
at
(OSHA)
inspections&#8221;
of
non-unionized
businesses.
It
is
understandable
that
many
perceive
these
steps
to
be
part
of
a
coordinated
effort
to
advance
a
pro-union
agenda
within
the
growing
Southeastern
automotive
manufacturing
industry,
which
is
thriving
due
in
part
to
the
pro-business

and
skilled

found
in
our

As
you
may

employees
in
Southeastern
auto
facilities
have
repeatedly
resisted
unionization,
most
recently
in
February
at
the
Volkswagen

in
Chattanooga .
It
is
concerning
that
a
federal
government
agency
may
be
advancing
a
pro-union
agenda
on
Southeastern
workers
that
they
do
not
want.
To
be
clear,
we
all
believe
workplace
safety,
and
there
are
times
when
dangerous
practices
need
to
be
corrected.
But
what
we&#8217;ve
seen
lately
is
a
pattern
of
aggressive,
punitive
action
from
OSHA
toward
a
specific
industry.
For
such
a
powerful
federal
agency
to
use
its
authority
to
intimidate
southern
businesses
and
push
a
pro-union
agenda
is
just
plain
wrong.
Our
work
on
this
issue
is
not
finished.
We
will
continue
to
push
Secretary
Perez
and
OSHA
to
explain
the
reasoning
for
targeting
the
southern
auto
manufacturing
industry.
I
will
keep
you
posted.
Restoring
Wages
Under
ObamaCare,
2.6
million
Americans
are
at
risk
of
having
their
wages
cut.
Of
those,
59%
are
younger
than
34
and
63%
are
women.
This
is
due
to
a
provision
in
the
law
that
reduces
the
definition
of
a
full
time
employee
to
someone
who
works
more
than
30
hours.
This
had
an
especially
hard
effect
on
wage
earners,
who
may
have
seen
their
hours
cut
in
order
for
businesses
to
avoid
new
tax
penalties.
The
House
on
Thursday
passed
the
bipartisan
&#8220; Save
American
Workers
Act &#8221;
which
would
restore
the
40
hour
work
week
and
ease
the
squeeze
on
hard
working
Americans.
Under
the
House-passed
bill,
wage
earners
would
no

about
seeing
their

cut
and
paychecks
shrink.
The
30

is
just
another

of
how
ObamaCare
is
hurting
Americans.
Countless

have
already
seen
their

rates
skyrocket,
or
access

The
&#8220;Save

shows
that
the
House
is
serious
about
eliminating
some
of
the
harmful
effects
of
ObamaCare
as
we
work
towards
a
replacement
plan
over
the
coming
