Rubio Supports Passage Of Iran Nuclear

Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of
2015, Marco delivered remarks on the
floor of the Senate urging passage of the
bill.

Rubio: So at the end of the
day,
if left to the choice we
have now, I dont think
theres any doubt that were
in a better position if this bill passes,
because at a minimum at least it creates
a process whereby the American people
through their elected representatives can
debate an issue of extraordinary
importance.
Rubio Calls For Reauthorization Of
FISA Authorities
Earlier this week, Marco joined Senators
Richard Burr (R-NC), Tom Cotton (R-AR), and
Jeff Sessions (R-AL)
on
the Senate floor
to discuss the need to
extend current authorities under the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act
(FISA).

Rubio: One day, I hope that
Im wrong, but one day there will
be an attack thats successful. And
the first question out of
everyones mouth is going to be,
why didnt we know about it? And
the answer better not be because this
Congress failed to authorize a program
that might have helped us know about
it.
This is a serious threat, and I
hope we reauthorize this bill.
In Senate Hearing, Rubio Challenges
Obama Administration On Cuba,
Colombia
On Tuesday, Marco
held
a budget authorization hearing
to
review the budget requests of the U.S.
State Departments Bureau of Western
Hemisphere Affairs, the Bureau of
Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, and the
Office of Global Womens Issues.
In his opening remarks, Marco addressed
the importance of these issues for the
Department of State and for Americas
role in the world, and reviewed some of the
challenges facing the U.S. in the Western
Hemisphere and around the world.
In his exchanges with Obama
Administration officials, Marco expressed
his concerns regarding the security of our
Interests Section in Cuba and the
possibility of the Interests Section in
Havana being infiltrated by Cuban
intelligence agents, and asked about the
impact of these concerns on the transition
of the Interests Section into an
embassy.
Marco also inquired whether the U.S. had
received a request from the Colombian
government to release narco-terrorist
Simn Trinidad, who is currently in U.
S. custody, as part of its peace
negotiations with the FARC, to which the
administration replied that at the present
time there were no discussions about his
release.

statement and the full exchanges is

remarks is available

ICYMI: My Vision For Europe
On the 70
th
anniversary of the allied
victory in Europe, Marco wrote an op-ed
outlining his vision for Europe. Read an
excerpt of the op-ed below and the full
version
here .
Rubio: As we face our own
challenges today, let us never forget the
sacrifices made by our ancestors 70 years
ago. Let us always remember that the
freedoms we cherish now were preserved by
those who came before us, and that just
like the greatest generation, we have a
duty to preserve liberty for all those in
the transatlantic community and
beyond.
Marco also commented on the national
election in the United Kingdom. Reach an
excerpt below and his full statement

Rubio: The British people have
spoken, and my wife Jeanette and I
congratulate Prime Minister David Cameron
on the Conservatives victory. I
look forward to continuing to work with
Prime Minister Camerons government
in the years ahead as we tackle problems
around the globe, especially in the
Middle East and with Russias
continued aggression in
Ukraine.
Constituent Casework Corner
Constituent Jennifer recently got
married and needed her name changed in the
Medicare system (CMS). She had already
submitted the change to the Social Security

not being reflected by Medicare. Senator
Rubios staff contacted CMS and SSA,
and the correction was made
immediately.
