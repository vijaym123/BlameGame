Putting Children First - My Visit to the Indiana Math & Science Academy
In my role as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood,
Elementary, and Secondary Education, I visit schools throughout
Indiana.
This Thursday, I visited with students and teachers at the
Indiana Math & Science Academy
(IMSA) - North.
The IMSA charter schools are free K-12 college prep schools that focus
on math, science, and technology - the very subjects and skill sets
that will be required of our students in the global marketplace they
will be entering.
IMSA is practicing many of the same tenets that drove the Student
Success Act - the No Child Left Behind rewrite that I introduced and
led to passage in the House earlier this year as Chairman of the
Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education.
The Student Success Act
prioritizes the success of students by putting those closest to
the children in direct guidance of their education - parents, teachers,
and local communities - not Washington bureaucrats.
Innovative education models that prioritize each student's unique
learning style are leading the way to a brighter future for our young
Hoosier students.
I look forward to more school visits throughout 2014.

Listening to Business, Fighting Red Tape - Indiana Motor Truck
Association Directors' Meeting
On Tuesday, I was the guest speaker for the Indiana Motor Truck
Association Board of Directors' Meeting.
I updated the board members on the recent 2-year Ryan-Murray Budget, as
well as transportation and logistics issues before Congress.
As many Rokita Report readers may know, many of the issues that impact
our transportation and logistics companies very rarely come before
Congress, and instead originate within the maze of federal bureaucracy.
Thousands of pages of rules and regulations are issued each year by
agencies like the Department of Transportation that have a negative
impact on Hoosier businesses and workers.
That is why, along with the Indiana Chamber of Commerce
, we created the Red Tape Rollback program to solicit
input from Hoosier businesses, like our transportation companies, on
arbitrary, senseless, and ultimately, costly regulations that are
stopping economic growth in our state and killing much-needed jobs.
Learn more about our Red Tape Rollback program and more on the 33
victories we've achieved since launching the program in 2011.

Engaging the Next Generation about our Debt at the Harvard Institute of
Politics
On Monday, I delivered my debt presentation at the Harvard University
Institute of Politics
(IOP).
IOP was founded in 1966 as a memorial to President
Kennedy and educates undergraduate students in politics and public
service careers.
This is the same debt presentation I've delivered all over Indiana and
on the House floor (which you can watch on YouTube
).
You can
also read a PDF copy of the presentation here
.
I enjoyed meeting the students there and discussing the debt that, if
unaddressed, they, along our children and grandchildren, stand to
inherit.
It is always a surprise to people what makes up the bulk of
our federal spending - social entitlement spending - and how large the
problem really is.
Thank you to IOP's director Trey Grayson for the invitation and to the
students who took time out during final exam week to engage on this
important issue facing them and their future.
I look forward to
visiting additional campuses in the new year to deliver the debt
presentation.

"You Can Keep Your Plan" - The Politifact "Lie of the Year" - ObamaCare
Insurance Cancellations Continue
It has been widely reported that millions of Americans are being sent
cancellation notices of their insurance policies
due to ObamaCare.
Just last week, the nonpartisan
political fact-finding site, Politifact.com ranked the President's
claim that, "if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep your
plan," the "Lie of the Year.
"
This lie is one that he reused
time and again in selling ObamaCare and seeking reelection.
Yet,
cancellations keep arriving in mailboxes all over the country.
Yesterday, I appeared on Fox News America's News HQ to talk about the
impact of ObamaCare and a better way forward - the American Health Care
Reform Act
.
You can watch my interview with Erich Shawn here
.
If you or someone you know has had a similar experiences due to
ObamaCare, please send me your story, your cancellation notice, or rate
increase documents at InsuranceCancellations@mail.house.gov.

Thank you for your continued interest in Congress and for supporting my
efforts in Washington. Take care.
Sincerely,
Todd Rokita

On

I
updated
the

as

Engaging

about
our
Debt at the
Harvard
Institute

On
Monday,
I
delivered
my

presentation
at
the

University
Institute

(IOP).
IOP
was
founded
in
1966
as

I

meeting

that,

Trey

for
the

and to
the
students
who
took
time
out
during
final
exam
week
to
engage
on
this
important
issue
facing
them
and
their
future.
I
look
forward
to
visiting
additional
campuses
in
the
new
year
to
deliver
