Citizens United
&gt;&gt;
Citizens United
is a threat to our democracy. In 2012, outside groups spent millions to sway elections around the country and that was just the beginning.
David, we can&rsquo;t let a select few dictate the outcome of our elections.
Please take a stand with us to demand Congress curb the effects of
Citizens United
immediately:
David --
Our democracy is being challenged.
Ever since the Supreme Court&rsquo;s
Citizens United
decision, right-wing outside groups have poured tons of money into key races to defeat strong Democrats.
In 2012 alone, shadowy groups and SuperPACs spent over $5 MILLION against Brad. This year, all signs indicate outside groups will dump in even more cash to defeat Brad.
David, we can&rsquo;t sit idly by and let
Citizens United
go on un-checked. Stand with Brad to demand Congress stop the effects of
Citizens United . Sign our petition before midnight. Click here to add your name to our petition to stop
Citizens United
&gt;&gt;
David, sign our petition before midnight and we&rsquo;ll count you in against
Citizens United : http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/Stop-Citizens-United
