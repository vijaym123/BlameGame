Dear
Friend,
Unfortunately while the American people wanted us to work together,
the President has taken unilateral action regarding illegal aliens that
only further divides the Congress and the American people.
As
the grandson of law-abiding and hardworking legal immigrants, I believe
this executive order diminishes respect for the law and will only
encourage more people in the future to violate our
borders.
Today, we know what President Obama has done.
In the past, this is
what the President has said:
President Obama, June
16, 2013 (asked by Univision if he could use executive power to legalize
millions of illegal immigrants if the House didnt pass the Senate
bill):
very important for us to recognize
that the way to solve this problem has to be
legislative.
President Obama, September 28, 2011 (remarks to
Hispanic Roundtable):
this notion that
somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true.
But
the fact of the matter is there are laws on the books that I have to
enforce.
We live in a democracy.
You have to pass bills
through the legislature
President Obama,
March 28, 2011 (Univision):
for me to
simply through an executive order, ignore those Congressional mandates
would not conform with my appropriate role as
President.
President Obama, January 30, 2013 (asked by Univision
if he would consider a moratorium on deportations of illegal
immigrants without a criminal record):
I am not a
king. I am head of the Executive Branch of government.
I am
required to follow the law.
President Obama,
February 2013 (asked during a Google Hangout if he could unilaterally
stop enforcing the law against illegal immigrants with American
family members):
I am not the emperor of the
United States.
My job is to execute laws that are
passed.
Be assured that I will continue to work with my
colleagues in Congress to address our nation's immigration
crisis.
Sincerely,
John L. Mica
