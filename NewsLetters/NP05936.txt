Calling on Lois Lerner to
Speak Under Oath Before Congress
For nearly a
year, Lois Lerner has refused to testify before Congress, yet last
week, she granted an interview to POLITICO. In that interview, Ms.
Lerner said she "didn't do anything wrong," and indicated she felt that she
was a scapegoat for higher-ups at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
If Ms. Lerner truly believes she didnt do anything wrong, as she
stated, then there is absolutely no reason for her to not testify under
oath before Congress and provide answers to the American people. Read
my full statement on Lois Lerner's POLITICO interview
here .

Meeting Miriam
Ibrahim
I had the honor and privilege of meeting
Miriam Ibrahim at this year's Values Voter Summit. Earlier this year,
Miriam was sentenced to death in Sudan--her only crime: refusing to
reject her Christian faith. While in prison Miriam gave birth to her
daughter Maya (pictured). After months of pressure from the U.S. and
mass public outcry, Miriam was released from prison and is now safe in
the U.S. Miriam serves as an inspiration to all of us to stand up for
what we believe in. God bless her and her family.

Touring NC
State
Earlier this week, while touring North Carolina State
University, I had the opportunity to watch live testing of firefighters'
turnout gear-- the flame-resistant uniforms they wear on the job. The NC
State College of Textiles has helped develop one of the safest and
lightest-weight uniforms for firefighters. I'm grateful to our NC
firefighters who put it all on the line to protect and serve the
community.

Praying for the Safety of Our
Men and Women in Uniform
This week, the
United States began airstrikes on targets in Syria. The President recently
announced that several thousand ground troops are currently stationed
in Iraq to help combat ISIS. He also informed the American people that
U.S. troops would be sent to Africa to try to fight the ebola
outbreak. While I don't always agree with the President's policy decisions, I
am always unwavering in my support of the U.S. military. As our men
and women in uniform are deployed to dangerous locales, I pray for
their safety. God bless the troops.
