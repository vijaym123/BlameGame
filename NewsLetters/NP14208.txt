Keep Your Plan
When the President pushed Obamacare through Congress, he made a lot of
promises. He promised that it wouldn't raise taxes, but we now know it
includes more than 20 new taxes
, including the individual mandate. He promised
that everyone's premiums would decrease, but the truth is that
individual market premiums are going up by about 41%
and employer-based plans have seen premium increases of 3%
to 4%
. And of
course, he promised that if you like your plan, you could keep it. But
in the past few months, millions of Americans
have
received cancellation notices and many more are coming.
I've received dozens of emails from constituents like you that are
facing these problems.
I shared one of these stories
on the House floor last week: a family in Levelland whose
daughter is battling a rare form of cancer was recently notified that
their plan is being canceled.
They feel they were lied to, and I don't
blame them.
On Friday, the House addressed these cancellations by passing a bill
called the Keep Your Health Plan Act
.
I was a cosponsor of this bill, which
allows insurance providers to continue to offer existing health plans
through 2014 so families don't have to face immediate cancellation.
The President threatened to veto the bill, despite its bipartisan
support.
I hope we can move this bill forward, because it provides
important relief for families that have lost their coverage.
But my
priority remains finding a permanent solution that protects Americans
from the high costs and dangerous consequences of Obamacare.
I'm also working to ensure that the data collected under Obamacare
remains secure.
Tomorrow, the Science Committee will hold a hearing
on the security of the data passing through the Healthcare.gov website.
We'll talk about what measures are in place to protect personal data
from hackers and misuse. According to testimony before the Homeland
Security Committee, hackers have already tried to attack the
Healthcare.gov website, so it's critical that we do everything possible
to ensure your information is protected.
Giving States Control Over Energy Production
This week, we'll be voting on H.R. 2728, the Protecting States' Rights
to Promote American Energy Security Act
.
This is commonsense
legislation that gives states that already regulate hydraulic
fracturing, or fracking, the right to continue doing so.
The bill
allows the federal government to set baseline standards for states that
don't already have fracking regulations in place.
But it reaffirms the
state-based regulation system that's been successful for generations.
For more than 60 years, states-including Texas-have safely regulated
fracking.
We've done so without a single case of groundwater
contamination.
In a country like ours, state-based regulation makes
sense.
The geologic formations in Texas are very different from those
in Pennsylvania.
So production methods and regulations should be
tailored to each region.
Our country's future depends on developing
our energy resources, and fracking is a critical component of an "all
of the above" energy strategy.
So I'll be supporting this legislation
to allow states to implement the regulations that work best for their
industries.
Action Item: Mobile Office Hours
I love it when constituents come visit me in my offices in Lubbock,
Abilene, Big Spring, and Washington, D.C.
But I know it's not always
easy to reach these places - especially Washington.
So this week, my
staff is coming to you.
Mobile Office Hours allow my staff to set up shop in your neighborhood
so you can talk to them about whatever is on your mind.
If you're
having trouble getting your social security benefits, navigating the
claims process at Veterans Affairs, or figuring out the naturalization
process, we can help.
You can also share your opinion on the issues
facing Congress.
Starting tomorrow, you can visit my staff in Floydada
in the morning and then
Plainview
later that afternoon.
Wednesday morning they'll be at the Breckenridge
Chamber of Commerce, and
Wednesday afternoon they'll be in Albany
.
If you're in the southern
part of the district, I hope you can make it to Gail
in the morning or Snyder
in the afternoon.
I hope
you'll visit my staff with your questions, concerns, and opinions so
they can pass them along to me in Washington.

Keep
Your
Plan
When
the
President
pushed
Obamacare
through
Congress,
he
made
a
lot
of
promises.
He
promised
that
it
wouldn&#8217;t
raise
taxes,
but
we
now
know
it
includes
more
than
20
new
taxes ,
including
the
individual
mandate.
He
promised
that
everyone&#8217;s
premiums
would
decrease,
but
the
truth
is
that
individual
market
premiums
are
going
up
by
about
41%
and
employer-based
plans
have
seen
premium
increases
of
3%
to
4% .
And
of
course,
he
promised
that
if
you
like
your
plan,
you
could
keep
it.
But
in
the
past
few
months,
millions
of
Americans
have
received
cancellation
notices
and
many
more
are
coming.
I&#8217;ve
received
dozens
of
emails
from
constituents
like
you
that
are
facing
these
problems.
I
shared
one
of
these
stories
on
the
House
floor
last
week:
a
family
in
Levelland
whose
daughter
is
battling
a
rare
form
of
cancer
was
recently
notified
that
their
plan
is
being
canceled.
They
feel
they
were
lied
to,
and
I
don&#8217;t
blame
them.
On
Friday,
the
House
addressed
these
cancellations
by
passing
a
bill
called
the
Keep
Your
Health
Plan
Act .
I
was
a
cosponsor
of
this
bill,
which
allows
insurance
providers
to
continue
to
offer
existing
health
plans
through
2014
so
families
don&#8217;t
have
to
face
immediate
cancellation.
The
President
threatened
to
veto
the
bill,
despite
its
bipartisan
support.
I
hope
we
can
move
this
bill
forward,
because
it
provides
important
relief
for
families
that
have
lost
their
coverage.
But
my
priority
remains
finding
a
permanent
solution
that
protects
Americans
from
the
high
costs
and
dangerous
consequences
of
Obamacare.
I&#8217;m
also
working
to
ensure
that
the
data
collected
under
Obamacare
remains
secure.
Tomorrow,
the
Science
Committee
will
hold
a
hearing
on
the
security
of
the
data
passing
through
the
Healthcare.gov
website.
We&#8217;ll
talk
about
what
measures
are
in
place
to
protect
personal
data
from
hackers
and
misuse.
According
to
testimony
before
the
Homeland

hackers
have
already
tried
to
attack
the
Healthcare.gov
website,
so
it&#8217;s
critical
that
we

is

Giving
States
Control
Over
Energy
Production
This
week,
we&#8217;ll
be
voting
on
H.R.
2728,
the
Protecting
States&#8217;
Rights
to
Promote
American
Energy
Security
Act .
This
is
commonsense
legislation
that
gives
states
that
already
regulate
hydraulic
fracturing,
or
fracking,
the
right
to
continue
doing
so.
The
bill
allows
the
federal
government
to
set
baseline
standards
for
states
that
don&#8217;t
already
have
fracking
regulations
in
place.
But
it
reaffirms
the
state-based
regulation
system
that&#8217;s
been
successful
for
generations.
For
more
than
60
years,
states&#8212;including
Texas&#8212;have
safely
regulated
fracking.
We&#8217;ve
done
so
without
a
single
case
of
groundwater
contamination.
In
a
country
like
ours,
state-based
regulation
makes
sense.
The
geologic
formations
in
Texas
are
very
different
from
those
in
Pennsylvania.
So
production
methods
and
regulations
should
be
tailored
to
each
region.
Our
country&#8217;s
future
depends
on
developing
our
energy
resources,
and
fracking
is
a
critical
component
of
an
&#8220;all
of
the
above&#8221;
energy
strategy.
So
I&#8217;ll
be
supporting
this
legislation
to
allow
states
to
implement
the
regulations
that
work
best
for
their
industries.
