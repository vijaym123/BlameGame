This week, the House Select Committee on Benghazi held its first
hearing
to examine implementation of the recommendations made by the Accountability Review Board.
The Accountability Review Board issued a
report
in December of 2012, which found that systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies at the State Department resulted in security that was grossly inadequate to address the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, that took the lives of four Americans.
The Review Board made over twenty recommendations, including designing courses that integrate high threat training to better prepare diplomatic security personnel assigned to high-risk posts, and revising regulations to include disciplinary action when poor performance by senior officials is related to a security incident.
In September of 2013, the State Department's Office of the Inspector General issued a
report
noting that while the Department has taken action to implement the recommendations, it may not be doing so in a manner that reflects the intent of the Review Board.
