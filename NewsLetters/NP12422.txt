RAND'S NEWSLETTER UPDATE
FEBRUARY 14, 2014
Please allow me to update you on this week's happenings in Washington, D.C.
Dr. Rand Paul
Meets with Director of Fish and Wildlife
Earlier this week, I joined Sens. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Reps. Hal Rogers (KY-05) and Ed Whitfield (KY-01) in a meeting with Daniel M. Ashe, Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. We discussed the water levels at Lake Cumberland and urged the agency to complete its study on the duskytail darter, a 2.5 inch minnow on the federal endangered species list, in a timely manner that would allow for restoring the pre-2007 water levels on which the local community relies.
This is an issue of great importance to our state and we appreciate Dan Ashe coming to the Capitol today to hear our concerns regarding the water level of Lake Cumberland and its impact on the Kentucky economy and jobs.
The past seven years of reduced water levels have not only hurt small businesses that rely on tourism, but have also strained local governments as local towns have had to lower their water intake. We urge the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife to move quickly and ensure the water levels of Lake Cumberland are raised adequately to support tourism prior to the peak season in 2014.

Dr. Rand Paul Announces 2014 Service Academy Nominations
On Tuesday, I announced my nominations to the U.S. service academies, consisting of 40 individuals from across the Commonwealth of Kentucky. A very rewarding aspect of being a United States Senator is the opportunity to nominate young men and women from across the state to attend our nation's prestigious service academies.
I commend each of these students for their dedication and desire to serve in the United States military, and wish them the best through the remainder of the selection process. I have no doubt the students chosen will proudly represent the Commonwealth of Kentucky in the service academies. Click

Dr. Rand Paul Speaks at the Vera Institute of Justice Public Forum
Also on Tuesday, I had the honor of speaking at the Vera Institute of Justice Public Forum on Criminal Justice. I discussed the need to mandatory minimum sentencing reforms and the restoration of voting rights. I also met with Attorney General Eric Holder to further the implementation of these much needed reforms within our justice system. Sentencing and voting reforms are not a Republican or Democrat issue, but rather an issue of justice and personal freedom.
Dr. Rand Paul Meets with Kentucky Manufactured Housing Institute
On Tuesday, I also had the opportunity to sit down with members of the Kentucky Manufactured Housing Institute. We discussed small business, environmental regulations and other issues that directly affect their industry.

Share Your Obamacare Stories
Since the implementation of Obamacare, hundreds of thousands of
Kentuckians have received cancellation notices from their current health
care providers. For every Kentuckian that has enrolled in Obamacare, 40
have been dropped from their coverage. Obamacare has been presented to
the American people through twisted rhetoric, smoke and mirrors.
Obamacare is not good for America and it certainly not good for
Kentucky.
I would like you hear how Obamacare affected you, your family or your small business. Share your story by visiting my website:
