MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: All Gifts TRIPLE-MATCHED
President Obama, Joe Biden, and Hillary Clinton asked for your help. Now before the critical FEC deadline at midnight, all donations are
TRIPLE-MATCHED.
Just a few hours ago, we were celebrating the new poll showing
Democrats have taken the lead&hellip;
&hellip;but now we have a MAJOR problem on our hands:
BREAKING NEWS: Boehner boosted by billionaire-backers Roll Call just reported that Republican outside groups &ldquo;have reserved nearly $12 million on the television airwaves in competitive races through Election Day.&rdquo;
Now, we suddenly have 7 different Republican groups trying to tear us down. It&rsquo;s just awful.
David -- we can contain the damage and maintain our lead, but we HAVE to hit 25O,OOO donations to President Obama&rsquo;s call-to-action. And we have to do it before tonight&rsquo;s midnight deadline. So please -- stop what you&rsquo;re doing: This is your LAST chance before midnight to take advantage of this
Triple-Match
opportunity.
