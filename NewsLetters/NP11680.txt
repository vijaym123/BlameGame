Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
I hope this finds you well. Thank you for the opportunity to share some
updates on my work for the Sixth District.
Working for Real Bipartisan Healthcare Reform
Last week, Congressmen Ami Bera, M.D. (D-CA) and I introduced H.R.
4106, the bipartisan Saving Lives, Saving Costs Act, because there is
nothing partisan about finding practical solutions to improve patient
health outcomes. Americans deserve healthcare reform that will help
lower the cost of care and protect the sacred patient-doctor
relationship. Our bill will lead to better, more affordable, and
evidence-based patient care by removing the need for physicians to
worry about practicing defensive medicine, instead allowing them to
focus on their patients' actual needs.
This legislation would lower healthcare costs and improve patient care
by reducing medical malpractice and insurance fraud using
evidence-based guidelines developed by doctors. Doctors who practice
using these guidelines would be eligible for liability protection,
known as a "safe harbor," if the case involves a federal statute or if
federal money was used to pay for care.
"The bipartisan Saving Lives, Saving Costs Act is a practical way to
bring down the skyrocketing cost of healthcare, and to make the system
work better for patients that people from both parties can get behind,"
said Congressman Bera. "As a doctor, I know that physicians want to do
what's best for their patients, and promoting evidence-based medicine
will help us do that."
I look forward to working with Congressman Bera to advance this
bipartisan healthcare reform!

Signature Industry Spotlight: Convening the Congressional Horse Caucus
In continuing my work to promote the Sixth District's signature equine
industry, I was honored to host the first meeting of the bipartisan
Congressional Horse Caucus with my Co-Chair, Congressman Paul Tonko of
New York. It was a great opportunity to raise awareness about the
enormous impact the American equine industry has on our economy and
provide more information about the industry directly to Members of
Congress and their staff.
The Caucus was glad to be joined by Mr. Stuart Janney III, a prominent
horseracing icon and owner of Orb, last year's Kentucky Derby winner,
who shared insights and observations about the racing industry and
answered our questions about how Congress could best address some of
the challenges facing the industry.
The Caucus also discussed legislation I introduced, H.R. 2212, which
would place all racehorses on a three-year depreciation schedule, a
provision which expired at the end of 2013.
I am confident this meeting has created positive momentum for the
equine industry on Capitol Hill and as Chairman of the Caucus, I will
continue my work to promote the American horse industry and the
hundreds of thousand of jobs directly associated with it, as well as
the $102 billion it contributes to the U.S. economy.

Protecting Kentuckians from Unexpected Flood Insurance Increases
On Tuesday, the House passed H.R. 3370, the Homeowner Flood Insurance
Affordability Act, which advances pragmatic and much-needed solutions
to implementation problems with the National Flood Insurance Program.
This bipartisan legislation allows a gradual, affordable transition so
that homeowners, small businesses and new homebuyers are not hit with
devastating and unexpected increases. The legislation also requires
modern, high-tech mapping and advance notification so that we can be
confident that the flood risk is being accurately assessed.
I have heard repeatedly over the last 14 months from constituents
concerned about the sudden increase in their flood insurance rates as a
result of current law and the threat it poses to their homeownership,
as well as cases in which the new maps were proven to be erroneous.
This legislation appropriately reforms the National Flood Insurance
Program while continuing to improve the program's solvency - protecting
homeowners as well as the taxpayers that backstop the program. The
bill's costs are fully offset and do not add to the federal deficit.
Kentuckians in the Capitol
I was glad to meet with Lexington and Louisville representatives from
CARE to discuss the International Violence Against Women Act, food aid
reform and humanitarian efforts in Syria.
Thanks to Mr. Jim Davis from Berea and Mr. David West from
Nicholasville, who were in town with the National Funeral Directors
Association, for stopping by the office.
A big thank you to the Kentucky Medical Association members who stopped
by my office to discuss my new medical malpractice bill, the Saving
Lives, Saving Costs Act. We also discussed the challenges facing
physicians under the Affordable Care Act, and the importance of
replacing the Sustainable Growth Rate in Medicare. I want to thank them
for their insight into the realities of our health care system on the
ground and their commitment to serving their patients and our
community.
I met with the Council on Foundations and Forum of Regional
Associations of Grantmakers about the vital role that non-profit and
philanthropic organizations play in our community. We discussed the
importance of the charitable tax deduction, as these organizations
provide importance services to central and eastern Kentucky, and one in
nine people in Kentucky are employed by nonprofit organizations.
I enjoyed meeting with Dr. Craig Carter who works at UK's Veterinary
Diagnostic Laboratory. We talked about the important work he and his
colleagues do at their Coldstream Research Campus facility to protect
Kentucky's livestock from disease.
I enjoyed meeting with a group of students studying osteopathic
medicine in Pikeville about the importance of funding graduate medical
education and residency slots in medicine. I want to thank them for
their commitment to primary care and for their work in eastern
Kentucky.

Around the District
Last Saturday, I enjoyed visiting with constituents at Hinton Mills
31st Annual Seed Days in Plummers Landing. Seed Days is an annual
customer appreciation event, and I was happy to honor the Hintons for
their service to the community.
I also participated in a moving ceremony that honored the victims and
the surviving families of the devastating Menifee County tornado that
ravaged eastern Kentucky two years ago. In the face of adversity,
communities find a way to come together. Over the last two years, the
citizens of Menifee have banded together, leaned on each other and come
out of this tragedy stronger than ever. The people of Frenchburg and
communities across the Commonwealth have renewed this hope and promise
of healing. This catastrophic event has reminded us that when tragedy
strikes, it strikes in the hearts of us all.
It is a testament to the character and compassion of Kentuckians that
individuals from all across the Commonwealth were willing to step in
and help so that the victims of these storms did not have to carry the
burdens alone.
Thanks to everyone who made it to my Meet Your Congressman event in
Bath County last Saturday! I truly appreciate people taking the time
out of their weekend to come and share their concerns about the
challenges they face and look forward to taking Kentuckians' concerns
to Washington to advocate for solutions.
I enjoyed stopped into the Preston General Store to grab an Ale-8-One
before heading into Menifee County.
On Saturday, I was pleased to honor the Right to Life of Central
Kentucky. As a strongly pro-life father of two young girls, I consider
protecting the unborn and the most vulnerable among us as one of my
greatest responsibilities as a parent and legislator. This
organization's mission is to increase public awareness and restore
legal protection to those members of our human family who are
threatened by abortion or infanticide. The Right to Life Association of
Central Kentucky works tirelessly to advocate for the dignity and worth
of all human life.
I commend my friends with the Right to Life Association of Central
Kentucky for their leadership, and I would like to thank them for all
that they do for our community.
Fighting for the Future of Kentucky Coal
Kentucky families depend on coal to keep the lights on. That is why I
am glad that the House passed legislation I cosponsored which provides
a future for the coal industry with benefits for the environment and
American economy.
H.R. 3826, the Electricity Security and Affordability Act, would roll
back the EPA's disastrous greenhouse gas standards that essentially ban
coal on principle, and requires the agency to acknowledge that
different fuels and technologies need different standards tailored to
the available control technologies. This legislation would allow the
EPA to issue standards based on demonstrable, commercialized technology
because as even Kentucky's top climate policy official warned the EPA,
"they need to look deeper and look at the economic impacts because one
size doesn't fit all here."
This is a major step toward preventing the EPA's attempt to turn the
lights out on Kentucky families and our economic recovery.

&#8220;As
a
doctor,
I
know
that
physicians
want
to
do
what&#8217;s
best
for
their
patients,
and
promoting
evidence-based
medicine
will
help
us
do
that.&#8221;

Signature
Industry
Spotlight:
Convening
the
Congressional
Horse
Caucus
In
continuing
my
work
to
promote
the
Sixth
District&#8217;s
signature
equine
industry,
I
was
honored
to
host
the
first
meeting
of
the
bipartisan
Congressional
Horse
Caucus
with
my
Co-Chair,
Congressman
Paul
Tonko
of
New
York.
It
was
a
great
opportunity
to
raise
awareness
about
the
enormous
impact
the
American
equine
industry
has
on
our
economy
and
provide
more
information
about
the
industry
directly
to
Members
of
Congress
and
their
staff.
The
Caucus
was
glad
to
be
joined
by
Mr.
Stuart
Janney
III,
a
prominent
horseracing
icon
and
owner
of
Orb,
last
year&#8217;s
Kentucky

winner,
who
shared
insights

about
the

and
answered
our

I
am
confident
this
meeting
has
created
positive
momentum
for
the
equine
industry
on
Capitol
Hill
and
as
Chairman
of
the
Caucus,
I
will
continue
my
work
to
promote
the
American
horse
industry
and
the
hundreds
of
thousand
of
jobs
directly
associated
with
it,
as

I
was

to
meet
with
Lexington
and
Louisville
representatives
from
CARE
to
discuss
the
International
Violence
Against
Women
Act,
food
aid
reform
and
humanitarian
efforts
in
Syria.
Thanks
to
Mr.
Jim
Davis
from
Berea
and
Mr.
David
West
from
Nicholasville,
who
were
in
town
with
the
National
Funeral
Directors
Association,
for
stopping
by
the
office.
A
big
thank
you
to
the
Kentucky
Medical
Association
members
who
stopped
by
my
office
to
discuss
my
new
medical
malpractice
bill,
the
Saving
Lives,
Saving
Costs
Act.
We
also
discussed
the
challenges
facing
physicians
under
the
Affordable
Care
Act,
and
the
importance
of
replacing
the
Sustainable
Growth
Rate
in
Medicare.
I
want
to
thank
them
for
their
insight
into
the
realities
of
our
health
care
system
on
the
ground
and
their
commitment
to
serving
their
patients
and
our
community.
I
met
with
the
Council
on
Foundations
and
Forum
of
Regional
Associations
of
Grantmakers
about
the
vital
role
that
non-profit
and
philanthropic
organizations
play
in
our
community.
We
discussed
the
importance
of
the
charitable
tax
deduction,
as
these
organizations
provide
importance
services
to
central
and
eastern
Kentucky,
and
one
in
nine
people
in
Kentucky
are
employed
by
nonprofit
organizations.
I
enjoyed
meeting
with
Dr.
Craig
Carter
who
works
at
UK&#8217;s
Veterinary
Diagnostic
Laboratory.
We
talked
about
the
important
work
he
and
his
colleagues
do
at
their
Coldstream
Research
Campus
facility
to
protect
Kentucky&#8217;s
livestock
from
disease.
I
enjoyed
meeting
with
a
group
of
students
studying
osteopathic
medicine
in
Pikeville
about
the
importance
of
funding
graduate
medical
education
and
residency
slots
in
medicine.
I
want
to
thank
them
for
their
commitment
to
primary
care
and
for
their
work
in
eastern
Kentucky.

Around
the
District
Last
Saturday,
I
enjoyed
visiting
with
constituents
at
Hinton
Mills
31st
Annual
Seed
Days
in
Plummers
Landing.
Seed
Days
is
an
annual
customer
appreciation
event,
and
I
was
happy
to
honor
the
Hintons
for
their
service
to
the
community.
I
also
participated
in
a
moving
ceremony
that
honored
the
victims
and
the
surviving
families
of
the
devastating
Menifee
County
tornado
that
ravaged
eastern
Kentucky
two
years
ago.
In
the
face
of
adversity,
communities
find
a
way
to
come
together.
Over
the
last
two
years,
the
citizens
of
Menifee
have
banded
together,
leaned
on
each
other
and
come
out
of
this
tragedy
stronger
than
ever.
The
people
of
Frenchburg
and
communities
across
the
Commonwealth
have
renewed
this
hope
and
promise
of
healing.
This
catastrophic
event
has
reminded
us
that
when
tragedy
strikes,
it
strikes
in
the
hearts
of
us
all.
It
is
a
testament
to
the
character
and
compassion
of
Kentuckians
that
individuals
from
all
across
the
Commonwealth
were
willing
to
step
in
and
help
so
that
the
victims
of
these
storms
did
not
have
to
carry
the
burdens
alone.
Thanks
to
everyone
who
made
it
to
my
Meet
Your
Congressman
event
in
Bath
County
last
Saturday!
I
truly
appreciate
people
taking
the
time
out
of
their
weekend
to
come
and
share
their
concerns
about
the
challenges
they
face
and
look
forward
to
taking
Kentuckians'
concerns
to
Washington
to
advocate
for
solutions.
I
enjoyed
stopped
into
the
Preston
General
Store
to
grab
an
Ale-8-One
before
heading
into
Menifee
County.
On
Saturday,
I
was
pleased
to
honor
the
Right
to
Life
of
Central
Kentucky.
As
a
strongly
pro-life
father
of
two
young
girls,
I
consider
protecting
the
unborn
and
the
most
vulnerable
among
us
as
one
of
my
greatest
responsibilities
as
a
parent
and
legislator.
This
organization&#8217;s
mission
is
to
increase
public
awareness
and
restore
legal
protection
to
those
members
of
our
human
family
who
are
threatened
by
abortion
or
infanticide.
The
Right
to
Life
Association
of
Central
Kentucky
works
tirelessly
to
advocate
for
the
dignity
and
worth
of
all
human
life.
I
commend
my
friends
with
the
Right
to
Life
Association
of
Central
Kentucky
for
their
leadership,
and
I
would
like
to
thank
them
for
all
that
they
do
for
our
community.
Fighting
for
the
Future
of
Kentucky
Coal
Kentucky
families
depend
on
coal
to
keep
the
lights
on.
That
is
why
I
am
glad
that
the
House
passed
legislation
I
cosponsored
which
provides
a
future
for
the
coal
industry
with
benefits
for
the
environment
and
American
economy.
H.R.
3826,
the
Electricity
Security
and
Affordability
Act,
would
roll
back
the
EPA&#8217;s
disastrous
greenhouse
gas
standards
that
essentially
ban
coal
on
principle,
and
requires
the
agency
to
acknowledge
that
different
fuels
and
technologies
need
different
standards
tailored
to
the
available
control
technologies.
This
legislation
would
allow
the
EPA
to
issue
standards
based
on
demonstrable,
commercialized
technology
because
as
even
Kentucky's
top
climate
policy
official
warned
the
EPA,
&#8220;they
need
to
look
deeper
and
look
at
the
economic
impacts
because
one
size
doesn&#8217;t
fit
all
here.&#8221;
This
is
a
major
step
toward
preventing
the
EPA&#8217;s
attempt
to
turn
the
lights
out
on
Kentucky
families
and
our
economic
recovery.
