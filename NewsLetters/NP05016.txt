David, I'm asking for your help.
With just 10 days to go, a brand new poll shows us trailing Bob Dold by 2 points, within the margin of error.
We&rsquo;re doing everything we can to pull ahead &ndash; knocking on doors and making calls around the clock &ndash; whatever it takes to get every last Illinois voter to the polls.
But David, we need you with us. If you can, click here and make one last gift to help us out. http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/10-days

We&rsquo;re running out of time -- so we'll get straight to the point. A brand new poll shows us trailing Republican Bob Dold by 2 points.
And as you read this, FOUR different outside groups are pounding the Chicago airwaves to help Dold squeak out a win. If we get outspent now -- with just 11 days to go -- the damage could be irreversible.
We just checked: we need 174 more donations by 11:59 PM Central to stay on track and respond to Boehner&rsquo;s attacks. So David, if you were planning to chip in for Brad&rsquo;s progressive campaign, it&rsquo;s critical you do so immediately.
