Help With a Federal Agency
Dear Friend-
It has been said that a veteran is someone who, at one point in his or
her life, has written a check payable to the "United States of America"
for an amount "up to and including my life."
Today, we will celebrate
Veterans Day. Those who have placed their lives on the line in defense
of our freedoms deserve the respect of our nation. They represent the
epitome of honor and integrity.
Please take a moment this weekend to
thank your friends and family members who have served.
Many constituents have expressed their concerns about ObamaCare as they
face cancellation notices and rate increases. How has ObamaCare
impacted your family? Share your experience with House Republicans by
clicking here.
Last week, I shared with you that I have introduced the If You Like
Your Health Care Plan You Can Keep It Act. This legislation will
overrule the ObamaCare regulations that are causing the cancellation of
existing health insurance plans. Action News Jacksonville reported on
this important legislation - watch the full interview by clicking here.
Rep. DeSantis training with local Army ROTC cadets at Embry-Riddle
Aeronautical University.
Recently, I had the opportunity to join several local Reserve Officers'
Training Corps (ROTC) detachments at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical
University for their morning physical training. It was a pleasure to
share with them how my experiences in the military have significantly
shaped the way that I approach policies related to our national defense
and service members.
This week, I also visited businesses and constituent groups throughout
the district to discuss their concerns and share how I am working on
their behalf. Hearing from you is my number one priority - please
continue to connect with me both online
and off!
For more frequent updates on legislation and events, please follow me
on Facebook
and Twitter
. I look forward to hearing from you; please do not
hesitate to contact either my Washington, DC or Port Orange office
should you need any assistance.
Sincerely,
Congressman Ron DeSantis

Avoid
tables
that
are
more
than
