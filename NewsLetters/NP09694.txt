Dear
Friend,
This job is all about listening. Listening to concerns
about what's happening in Northeast Georgia, listening to ideas about
what we could all be doing better--it's the best part of this
job.
Last week I had two incredible opportunities to listen and
learn.
I went out to
Cabe Farm
in Franklin County to see how a modern family
farm has turned to diversification for survival.
Of course we're
known in Northeast Georgia for our poultry production, but at Cabe,
in addition to
With future farmer Deacon Cabe at Cabe Farm in Franklin
County
poultry, there's livestock
and a hay bailing operation.
It was a great opportunity for me to
see for myself the ingenuity of Georgia farmers who face mountains of
federal regulations in doing their jobs yet continue to, quite
literally, feed the world.
I also spent some time in Gainesville
with the folks who founded and operate
Rahab's Rope .
Rahab's Rope is a nonprofit
based right in our own backyard that's on the leading edge of fighting
global human trafficking.
I was impressed and inspired by the
ways our neighbors are finding to fight this horrific form of modern
slavery and protect the basic human rights of women across the
globe.
I've always been proud to be from Northeast Georgia, and
seeing more examples of our resolve and ingenuity, whether it's in
business or in serving our community, makes me even more proud to represent
you.
I want to see and hear more.
If you'd like us to come
see your business or learn more about your charitable efforts,
please let me
know .
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
