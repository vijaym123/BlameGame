Wicker Reaffirms Importance of
Local
Banks and Credit Unions
New Bill
Would Protect Smaller Financial
Institutions
From Excessive
Rulemaking
Four years ago, Democratic super-majorities in Congress rammed
through some of the most sweeping changes to the U.S. financial system in
nearly eight decades.
The 848-page law
commonly known as the
Dodd-Frank Act
drastically expanded the role of the federal
government, giving bureaucrats incredible regulatory power over both small and
large financial
institutions.
Particularly troubling is the impact of Dodd-Frank on community
banks and credit unions, which have been saddled with excessive rules
and compliance costs.
These burdens adversely affect local
economic development, making it more difficult for Americans to start a
business or buy a home.
In many ways, the legislation that was
supposed to prevent another financial collapse on Wall Street has unfairly
hurt Main Street.
Eliminating Duplicative
Regulation
In September, I introduced the
"Financial Regulatory Clarity Act of 2014" to help alleviate the
onslaught of onerous rulemaking on the financial sector.
The bill
would require federal officials to assess whether new regulations are
duplicative or in conflict with existing guidelines and then resolve these
issues.
Inconsistent rules cause uncertainty, preventing local
banks and credit unions from serving their customers
effectively.
The sheer number of regulations
associated with Dodd-Frank is overwhelming.
According to the
American Action Forum, a nonprofit policy organization, the law's 398
new regulations had imposed more than $21.8 billion in costs and 60.7
million hours of paperwork by its fourth anniversary.
Moreover,
Dodd-Frank has yet to be fully implemented.
Fixing the
Volcker Rule
One of the
costliest and lengthiest regulations is the Volcker Rule, which
restricts banks from making speculative trades with their own accounts.
Although the rationale for the rule's adoption was to prevent large
banks from engaging in the kinds of risky behavior that contributed to
the 2008 financial crisis, the version that financial regulators
actually developed last December would have had significant, unintended
consequences for banks in Mississippi.
Earlier this year, I joined West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin
in introducing legislation to amend Dodd-Frank to protect community
banks in our states and across the nation from losing millions of
dollars on their investments.
The Volcker Rule would have forced these
institutions to dump traditional investments without warning, even
though they were never intended for speculative trading.
In
response to our legislation, financial regulators changed their position and
have altered the original rule accordingly.
Community banks
were not responsible for the economic meltdown in 2008 and should not be
punished by a bureaucratic
glitch.
Supporting
Economic Growth
Local
financial institutions in Mississippi and across the country are vital to
our economic recovery.
They provide credit and capital to
consumers and small businesses, which use it to create the majority of new
jobs.
Burdensome rules that force these banks and credit unions
to limit lending and devote significant resources to regulatory
compliance pose obstacles to job creation and economic growth.
In fact,
Dodd-Frank regulation has led to industry consolidation and forced
some banks and credit unions to go out of business entirely.
Others have chosen not to offer new products or services to customers
because of the cost and uncertainty associated with these new
rules.
Last year, Ben Bernanke, former
chairman of the Federal Reserve, noted the sluggish recovery, intense
competition, and mounting regulatory burden faced by community bankers.
He said, "Some observers have worried that these obstacles
particularly complying with regulations
may prove insurmountable."
I
am hopeful that my "Financial Regulatory Clarity Act" will lead to the
implementation of streamlined reforms.
Although the misconduct
that led to the financial crisis called for corrective action, these
measures should not impede financial institutions' role in promoting
economic development.
