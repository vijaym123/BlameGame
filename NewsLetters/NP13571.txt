A Small But Positive
Step
On Thursday, an overwhelming,
bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives passed a budget agreement that
had been negotiated between the House and the Senate. There is no
doubt that this agreement is a small step -- but it is a positive step in
the right direction. It contains more than $20 billion in
deficit reduction compared to current law, and it includes zero tax
increases. While it does not solve our large and long-term fiscal challenges,
it does reflects both common ground and our
principles.
Less noted, though just as important, is the
fact that this agreement will help jumpstart the appropriations
process so that future spending decisions reflect our
priorities. Moving forward, the manner in which spending reductions occur will not be
based on arbitrary cuts that usurp the proper role of Congress in
determining the nation's budget priorities. Instead, this package relies
on smarter cuts and common sense reforms, which make incremental
progress toward the ultimate goal
a smaller, more efficient and
accountable Washington.
It is
increasingly obvious that success
particularly in divided government
has to
be measured in positive steps, not leaps and bounds. This agreement
shows that we can abide by our obligation to work together to find
common ground without sacrificing the principles we hold
dear.
H.R.
2300 Takes Center Stage on Special Report's Center
Seat
On Wednesday, I was the featured guest on the
Fox News Channel's "Special Report with Bret Baier." Sitting in the
"Center Seat," I discussed H.R 2300, the
Empowering Patients
First Act
-- our comprehensive, patient-centered alternative
to Obamacare that was recently scored by former Congressional Budget
Office Director Douglas J. Holtz-Eakin, who found that the bill would
save American taxpayers $2.34 trillion in its first decade alone. To
