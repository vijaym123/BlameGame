Wildfires in Central Washington
My thoughts are with all those currently
impacted by the catastrophic wildfires now
burning in north Central Washington.
I will continue to be in close
communication with federal, state, and
local authorities on the ground and I
remain committed to ensuring they have the
necessary resources they need going
forward.

Not My Bosss Business: Ensuring
Contraceptive Coverage in the Aftermath
of Disastrous Hobby Lobby Supreme Court
Ruling
Last week, Senate Republicans
filibustered my
Protect
Womens Health from Corporate
Interference Act , also referred to as
the
Not My Bosss Business Act.
This bill would restore the
contraceptive coverage requirement
guaranteed by the Affordable Care Act that
was put in jeopardy by the misguided
Supreme Court decision in Hobby Lobby, and
protect the coverage of other federally
required health services for women and
their covered dependents from employers who
want to impose their beliefs by denying
benefits. This straightforward and simple
legislation was
cosponsored
by 46 Senators and endorsed by over 120
organizations , and fell just 2 votes
short of the required 60 votes to
proceed. But we are not done, and
will keep fighting.
Im extremely disappointed that my
Republican colleagues refused to even
proceed to a debate on this critical
legislation, but the fight is far from
over. Senators like me and Senator
Udall, who joined me and 45 of our
colleagues in this legislation, are not
going anywhere. The advocates, doctors, and
organizations that supported this
legislation are not going anywhere. And the
millions of women across the country who
were outraged at the Supreme Courts
decision arent going anywhere.
I will continue standing up for women and
their health care.

Bipartisanship at Work: President
Obama Signs Murrays Job Training
Bill into Law
I am so proud that this week, President
Obama signed my Workforce Innovation and
Opportunity Act into law. This bill
received overwhelming, bipartisan support
in the Senate and the House, and goes to
show that both chambers of Congress are
still capable of breaking through the
gridlock and investing in American workers
and the economy. Ive seen
firsthand that federal workforce programs
can change lives, boost our economy, and
get people back to work, but we cant
expect to adequately train Americans for
jobs at Boeing or Microsoft with programs
designed in the 1990s. 95 percent of
each chamber of Congress agreed with me,
and Im thrilled that this long
overdue legislation is now signed into
law.

Ensuring Fair Treatment for Children
at the Border
Recently, I was able to question top
Administration officials on the treatment
of unaccompanied children and refugees
detained near the Southwest border after
fleeing widespread violence in their home
countries. These are not people
coming here to take American jobs. These
are not people coming here for a free ride.
These are children, many of them only 7 or
8 years old, fleeing terrible violence in
their home countries. Theyre sent by
desperate mothers and fathers who have had
to look them in the eyes and literally tell
them to run for their lives. And as a
mother, and a grandmother, I just
cant imagine what that would feel
like. I believe that this is a humanitarian
and refugee crisis that were seeing
along our Southern border. I will
continue to monitor this situation and I am
very focused on ensuring we have the
resources we need to protect these children
and treat them humanely while theyre
detained.

Giving Working Parents a Fair Shot
This month, I introduced the Helping
Working Families Afford Child Care Act,
which would increase the tax credit working
families can receive for child care costs
and expand the credit to countless
low-income families who currently are not
eligible. At a time when parents are
struggling to meet the skyrocketing cost of
child care, households next year could see
a credit of $1,600 for one child or $3,200
for more than one child
nearly
three times the maximum benefit many
families are eligible to receive under
current law
if this legislation
passes Congress.
Updating this tax credit to reflect the
needs of families in todays economy
would be a critical step forward in terms
of our larger effort to make sure working
parentsdads and momshave a
fair shot. I believe that by putting
in place policies to make child care more
affordable, by making sure women get the
equal pay they deserve, by raising the
minimum wage so that millions of workers
have a better shot at lifting themselves
out of poverty, and by taking steps to
ensure students arent overwhelmed by
debt after graduating from college, we
could break down some of the very real
barriers that are holding families and our
economy back. And there is no reason we
shouldnt start with right now, with
the bill I introduced.
