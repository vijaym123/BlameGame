HPSCI Adopts New Subcommittees
Washington, D.C. &ndash; At today&rsquo;s organizing meeting of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the committee adopted a new subcommittee structure and named its subcommittee chairmen, ranking members, and members. Chairman Devin Nunes released the following statement:
&ldquo;The Intelligence Committee has adopted a new subcommittee structure designed to enhance oversight of the relevant agencies and departments. I welcome the subcommittee chairmen &ndash; Congressmen LoBiondo, Westmoreland, Rooney, and Heck &ndash; who have all shown their dedication to this committee&rsquo;s work. At a time when our nation faces growing threats ranging from terrorist bombings to cyberattacks, these chairmen will serve vital roles in helping to maintain and improve our nation&rsquo;s intelligence capabilities. I look forward to working on a bipartisan basis with the subcommittee chairmen and ranking members, Ranking Member Adam Schiff, and all other committee members to ensure rigorous oversight of the Intelligence Community&rsquo;s operations and to preserve important capabilities of the intelligence community designed to keep our country safe.&rdquo;
Ranking Member Adam Schiff released the following statement:
&ldquo;In order to improve oversight of our nation&rsquo;s intelligence community, the Committee is adopting a new agency-specific subcommittee structure.
I know that the new Ranking Members of these subcommittees together with their respective Members will work closely with their Republican counterparts to continue the strong bipartisan tradition of this committee, and maximize the scrutiny we are able to give these large agencies. There&rsquo;s no shortage of issues that will come before Congress this session &ndash; from addressing new threats of terrorism at home and around the world, to reforming our surveillance capabilities and oversight, as well as securing and reinforcing our nation&rsquo;s cybersecurity &ndash; and I look forward to working with Chairman Nunes and our colleagues to do everything possible to preserve both our security and privacy.&rdquo;
