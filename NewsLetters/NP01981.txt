HOURS AWAY: Senate vote on Obamacare-killing budget
Time is running incredibly short:
TUESDAY:
Boehner&rsquo;s mega-fundraiser brought in $17.5 MILLION in one night
YESTERDAY:
Boehner rewarded all those donors by passing a budget that hands millionaires LAVISH tax breaks
If we get buried under the GOP&rsquo;s onslaught of corporate cash, the Republicans&rsquo; agenda could actually pass.
The Senate GOP votes TONIGHT on their disgusting budget -- you need to stop them. We need 3,000 more Democrats to step up.
Suggested Action for David Johnson
