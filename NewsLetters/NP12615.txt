Should climate change policy play a larger role in the conservation and
preservation of public lands?
Yes - It is critical for us to address climate change now so as to
protect public lands for future generations
Maybe - Climate change policy is good for public lands, but it will not
affect public lands in our lifetime
No - Climate change policy will hurt our public lands

February is nationally recognized as Black History Month. This year's
theme is "Civil Rights in America," focusing on the 50th anniversary of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
This landmark piece of legislation, signed into law by President Lyndon
Johnson, outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or
national origin, including barring discrimination in all facilities
open to the public, thereby ending the Jim Crow era. Despite the
significance of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the strides we have
made since, there is much more work that needs to be done to protect
the rights of all Americans, especially their voting rights.
In early 2013, the Supreme Court struck down Section 4 of the Voting
Rights Act. This critical component of the Act provided voting
protection to areas of the country where racial discrimination against
minority voters was still prevalent. Congress must recommit its efforts
to renew and strengthen the protections of the Voting Rights Act that
guard Americans' right to vote. Voting rights, just like civil rights,
are fundamental to a vibrant democracy.
Our national public lands generate $646 billion in outdoor recreation
spending each year, another $39.9 billion in federal tax revenue, and
are tied directly to more than 6.1 million jobs. All of this is
threatened by the steadily worsening reality of climate change.
On Wednesday, the House voted on the "Sportsmen's Heritage and
Recreational Enhancement Act," which claims to preserve our nation's
public lands. However, the Act would actually impair federal management
of these lands and undermine important existing public land and
environmental laws, rules, and processes. The bill is shortsighted and
does not, at any point, address any climate change mitigation
strategies.
This is why I cosponsored an important climate change amendment to the
Act.
The amendment allows the Secretary of the Interior to consider the
detrimental effects of climate change when making decisions related to
recreation and conservation on public lands. Unfortunately, the bill
passed the House without the amendment by a vote of 268 to 154. Despite
the climate change amendment being defeated, I will continue to fight
for policies that address climate change head-on. It is, in my opinion,
a matter of national security.
Last weekend, I was proud to take part in the annual Tet Parade in
Westminster. As many of you know, this is one of the most attended
cultural events in the district, and it was an honor to help ring in
the Vietnamese Lunar New Year with thousands of constituents from the
community.
Marching in the annual Tet Parade in Westminster
I also visited with a few of the Vietnamese media outlets in
Westminster during the Lunar New Year celebrations. We discussed human
rights, the Lunar New Year, and ways for us to work together in the
future.

Amendments
An amendment changes the text of an existing bill or of another
existing amendment. Members of Congress can offer amendments either in
committee sessions or on the House floor. Amendments can be offered to
add text, remove existing text, or remove existing text and replace
them with substitute language.
Another kind of amendment is a Constitutional amendment, which makes
formal changes to the U.S. Constitution. These amendments require a 2/3
supermajority of both the Senate and the House to be sent to the states
for ratification. Three-quarters of the states must then approve a
Constitutional amendment for it to be ratified. There have been 33
Constitutional amendments and all but six have been ratified.
Interestingly, four of these six unratified amendments, some dating
back to the 1700s, are technically still pending before state lawmakers.
What did you think about the President's State of the Union address?

February
is
nationally
recognized

Black

Month.
This
year&#8217;s
theme
is
&#8220;Civil

of

Despite
the
significance
of
the
Civil

Act
of
1964,
and
the
strides
we
have
made
since,
there
is
much
more
work
that
needs
to
be
done
to
protect
the
rights
of
all
Americans,
especially
their
voting
rights.
In
early
2013,
the
Supreme
Court
struck
down
Section
4
of
the
Voting
Rights
Act.
This
critical
component
of
the
Act
provided
voting
protection
to
areas
of
the
country
where
racial
discrimination
against
minority
voters
was
still
prevalent.
Congress
must
recommit
its
efforts
to
renew
and
strengthen
the
protections
of
the
Voting
Rights
Act
that
guard
Americans&#8217;
right
to

Voting
rights,
just
like
civil
rights,
are
fundamental
to
a
vibrant
democracy.
Our
national
public
lands
generate
$646
billion
in
outdoor
recreation
spending
each

another
$39.9

and
are

All

This
is
why
I

the

The
amendment
allows
the
Secretary

head-on.
It
is,
in
my
opinion,
a

national
