"Sometimes Stuff Just Happens"
"Sometimes stuff just happens."
That's how former IRS official Lois Lerner explained
the "loss" of two years of her emails subpoenaed
by Congress as part of our investigation into the IRS's political
targeting. And it isn't just Lerner's emails that are missing-the IRS
has failed to produce emails from no less than six other IRS employees
who are central to our investigation, citing a supposed computer crash.
That excuse certainly wouldn't have been accepted for the conservative
groups subjected to harassment and improper questioning by the IRS like
Tennessee's own "Linchpins of Liberty"
and it
shouldn't' be allowed to stand now that the IRS itself is the agency in
question.
A leading information technology expert has called the IRS's story
"simply not feasible"
and now the even the mainstream media is
ridiculing
their claims. My colleagues and I on the Ways and Means Committee
aren't buy the story either. That is why, today, we called IRS
Commissioner John Koskinen before us to give an account of what he know
about these missing documents and when he knew it. In my questioning, I
told Commissioner Koskinen directly that his claims were "very curious"
and pointed how unlikely it was that his agency somehow "lost" volumes
of documents requested by our committee but has never reported losing
any taxpayer information. You can watch a video of my questioning here
.
If the IRS cannot turn over these missing documents, I believe it is
time to make them answer to someone who can. That is why I am fighting
for a special prosecutor to fully investigate the IRS. Last month, the
House of Representatives voted to do just that with the passage of H.
Res. 565. This resolution earned the support of 26 House Democrats-proof
that even members of President Obama's own party aren't buying his
claim that there is not a "smidgen of corruption" within this agency.
Our efforts to demand accountability from the IRS are ongoing, and I
won't rest until justice is served on behalf of every American whose
First Amendment rights were violated by this government intrusion. As
our work continues, I hope you will keep up-to-date with the latest on
these investigations at www.gop.gov/IRS
and consider joining me in my demands for a special prosecutor
by becoming a Citizen Cosponsor of H. Res. 565 HERE
.
Together, we are fighting back!

"Sometimes
Stuff
Just
Happens"
&#8220;Sometimes
stuff
just
happens.&#8221;
That&#8217;s
how
former
IRS
official
Lois
Lerner
explained
the
&#8220;loss&#8221;
of
two
years
of
her
emails
subpoenaed
by
Congress
as
part
of
our
investigation
into
the
IRS&#8217;s
political
targeting.
And
it
isn&#8217;t
just
Lerner&#8217;s
emails
that
are
missing&#8212;the
IRS
has
failed
to
produce
emails
from
no
less
than
six
other
IRS
employees
who
are
central
to
our
investigation,
citing
a
supposed
computer
crash.
That
excuse
certainly
wouldn&#8217;t
have
been
accepted
for
the
conservative
groups
subjected
to
harassment
and
improper
questioning
by
the
IRS
like
Tennessee&#8217;s
own
&#8220;Linchpins
of
Liberty&#8221;
and
it
shouldn&#8217;t&#8217;
be
allowed
to
stand
now
that
the
IRS
itself
is
the
agency
in
question.
A
leading
information
technology
expert
has
called
the
IRS&#8217;s
story
&#8220;simply
not
feasible&#8221;
and
now
the
even
the
mainstream
media
is
ridiculing
their
claims.
My
colleagues
and
I
on
the
Ways
and
Means
Committee
aren&#8217;t
buy
the
story
either.
That
is
why,
today,
we
called
IRS
Commissioner
John
Koskinen
before
us
to
give
an
account
of
what
he
know
about
these
missing
documents
and
when
he
knew
it.
In
my
questioning,
I
told
Commissioner
Koskinen
directly
that
his
claims
were
&#8220;very
curious&#8221;
and
pointed
how
unlikely
it
was
that
his
agency
somehow
&#8220;lost&#8221;
volumes
of
documents
requested
by
our
committee
but
has
never
reported
losing
any
taxpayer
information.
You
can
watch
a
video
of
my
questioning
here .
If
the
IRS
cannot
turn
over
these
missing
documents,
I
believe
it
is
time
to
make
them
answer
to
someone
who
can.
That
is
why
I
am
fighting
for
a
special
prosecutor
to
fully
investigate
the
IRS.
Last
month,
the
House
of
Representatives
voted
to
do
just
that
with
the
passage
of
H.
Res.
565.
This
resolution
earned
the
support
of
26
House
Democrats&#8212;proof
that
even
members
of
President
Obama&#8217;s
own
party
aren&#8217;t
buying
his
claim
that
there
is
not
a
&#8220;smidgen
of
corruption&#8221;
within
this
agency.
Our
efforts
to
demand
accountability
from
the
IRS
are
ongoing,
and
I
won&#8217;t
rest
until
justice
is
served
on
behalf
of
every
American
whose
First
Amendment
rights
were
violated
by
this
government
intrusion.
As
our
work
continues,
I
hope
you
will
keep
