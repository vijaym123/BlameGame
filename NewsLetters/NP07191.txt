3rd District Job Fair on
Thursday
This Thursday, August 14th, Kansans who are looking for a
job are invited to attend our
4th Annual 3rd District Job
Fair
at the
Great Mall of the Great Plains
in
Olathe. These job fairs have been a tremendous success in the past and
have allowed job seekers to make important contacts with
employers. Approximately one hundred employers will be on hand to meet
face-to-face with job seekers looking to fill hundreds of open positions. I
encourage everyone looking for work to
attend.
Congressman Yoder greets a veteran during the first hour of last year's 3rd
District Job Fair.
It's
heartbreaking to see that the unemployment rate for our nation's
military veterans is considerably higher than the national average for
civilians - even over
twenty percent for veterans aged 18-24 years
old . We must continue to do more for America's bravest once
they return home from serving abroad. That is why the first hour of
this year's 3rd District Job Fair is once again
exclusively for
veterans only
- giving them the first opportunity to meet in
person with employers looking to hire. Then, from
10 a.m.
to 1 p.m. , the job fair is open to the public. There's no
charge to attend - simply dress for success, and bring several copies of
your resume.

year's 3rd District Job Fair - approximately 1,400 job seekers attended,
and several employers were hiring on the spot.

Startup Day Across
America
Once again this year, we recognized and celebrated
Startup Day Across
America . Last Tuesday, August 5th, I participated in a fascinating roundtable
conversation with several local innovators and entrepreneurs at
Kansas City Startup
Village
(KCSV) . I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of the
Start Up Act 3.0 , bipartisan legislation to encourage
more college students to study science, technology, engineering and math
(STEM) in order to be prepared for newer tech fields after graduating.
We also spoke about jobs and the economy,
the Email Privacy Act , education,
important national and local startup issues, and more. Our community is
fortunate to be home to Kansas City Startup Village, as well as the
Ewing Marion Kauffman
Foundation
-
a foundation focused on entrepreneurship and
education.
Rep. Yoder speaks
with several startup business leaders at Kansas City Startup
Village.
I'm proud to be a member of
the
House Congressional
Caucus on Innovation and Entrepreneurship , a bipartisan group
of representatives who recognize the importance of startups and
innovative small businesses in our country. Small businesses
create
two-thirds of all new jobs in our economy , and startups are
often times launching the businesses of tomorrow
today.
Thanks to KCSV for hosting our great
discussion - it was a very informative meeting. Keep up the great
work!
"Service Above Self" - Shawnee Mission Rotary
It
was a pleasure to address the
Rotary Club of Shawnee Mission Kansas
in Mission last
week. I gave an update on our work in Congress this summer and
appreciated the questions and input from the audience about issues
important to them.
As a
Rotarian myself, I believe in the Rotary motto, "service above self," and I
thank this group for their service to our
community.
Also at the Rotary Club of Shawnee Mission
meeting, I had the pleasure of visiting with
Dr. John Hollyman,
DDS . Hes 99 years young, a past Rotary District Governor, a
World War II veteran, and the very first Mayor of
Countryside.
It was wonderful speaking with
Dr. Hollyman and I thank him for his many years of public
service.
Connecting with Constituents - Telephone Town Hall
Forums
I enjoyed speaking directly with constituents last week during two
telephone town hall forums. These are great opportunities for me to
connect with thousands of constituents and to answer questions directly
from Kansans from the comfort of their homes. I provided an update about
the work Congress has done the past few months, as well as important
legislation before Congress this fall. We also covered several topics
important to 3rd District Kansans, including the federal budget,
growing support for
my
bipartisan Email Privacy Act legislation , the immigration
crisis, scientific and medical research, the economy, the ongoing
situation in the Middle East, and more. I appreciated the dozens of thoughtful
questions presented.
As your
representative in Congress, listening to you is my most important job.
If you were unable to join me on the call and would like to be
included in our next Telephone Town Hall, please
email
us.
As I continue these town hall
meetings, I look forward to continuing to listen to your concerns. Details
for the next town hall will be announced on my website, social media
pages, and distributed through my weekly
e-newsletter .
Thank you to everyone who joined our discussion and for the
important questions. I value these telephone town hall forums
greatly.
Visiting with Dana and
Parks
I had the opportunity to visit with
Dana Wright and Scott
Parks in studio at KMBZ
radio last Friday. It was a good
chance to catch up on current events and legislation before Congress. We
spoke about the current situation in Iraq, the humanitarian immigration
crisis on the southern border, veterans unemployment, and the upcoming
3rd District Job Fair.
It was good to visit with Dana and
Scott and I appreciate the opportunity to speak with the listening
audience.

Great Plains SPCA Visit
I
enjoyed touring the
Great
Plains SPCA Veterinary Care Center
in Merriam last week. Great
Plains SPCA cares for more than
35,000 pets each
year
and finds a home for more than 95 percent of them. It was an
informative visit and I appreciate hearing about the work these veterinarians
and animal specialists are doing in our community. For more
information about
volunteering
or
adopting
a furry four-legged friend visit the
Great Plains SPCA website
or call (913)
831-SPCA (7722).
Thank
you to Heidi Wooten and Courtney Thomas for showing me around their
facility.

Town Hall Forum Focusing on Federal Funding for Critical
Research
Discussion to feature comments by National Institutes of Health,
Patient Advocacy Groups and Local Research
Institutions
I invite you to a town hall forum I am hosting in
Overland Park to discuss the role of federal funding for critical
lifesaving research. The forum will be held on
Tuesday, August
19th , at the
KU Edwards campus . This event is open
to the public and I encourage everyone to attend and join in a
discussion with national, regional, and local experts about the role and
value of federal research. We plan to have an important dialogue about the
impact this research is having on the local economy and patients and
researchers fighting life-altering disease right here at
home.
Dr. Christopher Austin,
M.D., Director, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences at
the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
will travel to the 3rd
District to participate in this public forum to highlight the role of
the NIH and the impact NIH research efforts have in
Kansas.
Im excited to welcome Dr. Austin to
the 3rd District of Kansas. I am a strong supporter of biomedical
research, and believe the NIH research taking place at the University of
Kansas and by local entrepreneurs is having a positive impact on the
health and life of Kansans across the state. I hope this forum will allow
everyone in the community to fully understand the value of the NIH
and the importance of continued medical research in our efforts to
improve and save lives.

President Obama Signs VA Reform
Bill
The House and Senate worked in a bipartisan way to
pass needed reforms
to
the VA Administration. These reforms will cut down on wait times for
veterans seeking treatment, allow veterans to visit qualified health
facilities outside the VA system, provide more incentives for doctors,
nurses and health care providers to work in the VA, and
more.
I voted " Yes " on this
important legislation.
Now, the
president has signed the bipartisan legislation making the reforms law. I'm
pleased the president agreed with the House and Senate and signed
this bipartisan legislation into law. We need to continue doing our best
for the brave men and women who have sacrificed so much to serve our
country.
