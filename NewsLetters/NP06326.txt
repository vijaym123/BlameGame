MAJOR UPDATE: Boehner doubles down on his ad buy against Brad
Here we go:
Late Friday night, we got word Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s campaign machine is dumping $1,850,000 on Chicagoland T.V. to blast Brad&rsquo;s progressive record.
Boehner thinks with enough Republican spending, we&rsquo;ll give up and hand them a victory on a silver platter. Well, David, he&rsquo;s dead wrong.
We&rsquo;ve been gearing up for this fight since day one -- working round the clock to build the strongest grassroots campaign Illinois has ever seen. And so far, it&rsquo;s working.
We&rsquo;re proud of the more than 20,000 Founding Members supporting Brad&rsquo;s first re-election campaign.
But David, we don&rsquo;t see your name on the list.
Chip in today and we&rsquo;ll mark you down as a Founding Member.
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Here in Illinois, we need strong Democrats like Brad who will fight for our middle class, fight to protect our environment, and fight to ensure equality for all Americans.
In the face of so much outside money, we need every last supporter to make sure Brad wins.
Can we count you in? Chip in here: http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/Founding-Member
