Representative
Scott
Perry
NOVEMBER 16, 2014
This week, the House took action to create over 40,000 good-paying jobs, reduce our dependence on Middle East oil and lower energy costs for hardworking Americans by again approving the Keystone XL Pipeline with a strong bipartisan majority. Unfortunately, the President still says hell veto this job-creating measure. Throughout this term, House Republicans have remained focused on efforts to spur economic growth, create jobs and lighten the crushing debt burden were piling up.
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that an annual increase of just 0.1% in economic growth would reduce the deficit by more than $300 billion over 10 years.
Two ways the House has sought to boost economic growth is through increased energy production and reducing regulatory burdens. The Keystone legislation would could create an estimated 40,000 new jobs and deliver approximately 83,000 barrels of oil a day, substantially reducing our reliance on energy from unstable sources.
In addition to boosting North American energy production and reducing burdensome regulations, Ill continue to support ongoing efforts in the House to create opportunities for private sector economic growth by controlling spending, simplifying our tax code and fostering innovation. Its time to unleash the American economy.
Sincerely,
Scott G. Perry
