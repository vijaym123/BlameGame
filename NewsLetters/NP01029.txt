Dear Friend, This week the House passed two major appropriations bills to fund a series of very important priorities for fiscal year 2016:
the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs (MilCon-VA) Appropriations Act
and
the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act .
The MilCon-VA bill is crucial for supporting the needs of our military personnel and making significant improvements to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for those who've served our country.
It will boost funding for veterans programs by 5.6 percent above last year's level and ensure that our military personnel have the infrastructure they need, including quality housing and medical facilities for them and their families. It also calls for the modernization of the VA's electronic health record system by tying funding to its ability to demonstrate progress on the system's functionality.
The Energy and Water bill provides funding for our national defense nuclear weapons activities, the Army Corps of Engineers, various programs under the Department of Energy, and other related agencies.
It will upgrade America's electric grid, cut the Obama administration's red tape that is hurting our energy industry, and help drive us closer toward energy independence.
The bill also represents a major victory for Americans concerned with the administration's reckless "Waters of the United States" proposal. From the east to the west, water touches the life of every American and is indispensable to our national well-being. I am proud to stand with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to protect America's farmers and small businesses from WOTUS's potentially devastating effects.
Most importantly, this bill funds the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, which is incredibly beneficial to the Third District since it directly supports dredging in the port of Erie, the maintenance of Presque Isle, the operation of our locks and dams, and all of the jobs and recreational opportunities that they provide.
Sincerely,
Rep. Kelly Applauds House Passage of Congressional Balanced Budget Resolution
House-Senate agreement will balance budget within 10 years
Rep. Kelly issued the following statement today in support of the final budget agreement between the House and Senate for fiscal year 2016, also known as
the Conference Report to S. Con. Res. 11 , which was passed by the House of Representatives yesterday evening by a vote of 226-197.
"For the first time in more than a decade, the People's House has passed a plan produced by both chambers of Congress that will balance the federal budget in less than 10 years and put our country on a sustainable path to real economic growth. This is a monumental achievement by America's new Congress, which is fulfilling its promise to put commonsense priorities first and get things done for the American people.
"This bicameral plan will finally reverse our nation's record high debt without raising any taxes-a far cry from all seven of President Obama's proposed budgets, including his latest proposal, which includes more than $2 trillion in tax increases and never even comes close to balancing. As the world's dangers continue to grow, our budget will properly increase funding for our men and women in uniform to help them do their jobs and keep us safe. It will also fully preserve Medicare and begin the important process of repealing and replacing Obamacare.
"Families in Western Pennsylvania and Americans from coast to coast are expected to live by a responsible budget every single year. With this historic budget agreement, Washington is finally doing the same."
