Dear
Fellow Nevadan,
I join the Mexican-American community in
Nevada and across the country in commemorating the 152 nd
anniversary of the Battle of Puebla, where brave Mexican soldiers in their
fight for freedom defeated the invading French army near the city of
Puebla. In the United States, Cinco de Mayo is a celebration of Hispanic
heritage. Throughout our nations history, Latinos have enriched the
fabric and culture of the United States. I am proud to have joined my
friend, Senator Mark Udall of Colorado, as a cosponsor of the Cinco de
Mayo resolution.
In Nevada, nearly one quarter of the
population is of Latino origin, and their influence is evident throughout
the state. The name of the state and the name of our most famous city,
Las Vegas, are both Spanish words. As we celebrate Cinco de Mayo, I
reaffirm my commitment to fight for issues important to the Hispanic
community such as job creation, education, access to affordable, quality
health care, and strong housing protections. Last year, the Senate
passed a bipartisan, common-sense bill that would fix our nations
broken immigration system. Speaker Boehner and House Republicans should
bring immigration reform to a vote. It is time for the Republican-led
House of Representatives to put an end to the separation of
families.
