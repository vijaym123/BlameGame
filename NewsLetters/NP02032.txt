Dear
Friend,
This week marked the 12th anniversary of the
start of the Iraq War --
I introduced
two separate bills to rethink twice before engaging in military
conflict and to share the burden of we just go to war.
My Draft Act
calls for reinstating the military draft for all males and females from
18-25, and the War Tax Act levies a tax for war funds whenever
Congress autorizes a declaration of war or use of military force. You can
watch my video about the bills below:
Yesterday, I joined Rep. Sheila Jackson
Lee and several of my colleagues at a press conference to urge
confirmation of Loretta Lynch for Attorney General.
We implored the
Senate to do the right thing and confirm Lynch as soon as possible.
Loretta Lynch is more than qualified.
Your opinion is
valuable to me. So please visit my website at
www.Rangel.house.gov
for more information, and to engage with
me on
Facebook
and on
Twitter . It's always a great honor serving
you.
Best regards,
Charles B. Rangel
