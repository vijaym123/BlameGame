Friend -- Nate Silver writes,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s remarkable how many [Senate] races have remained competitive.&rdquo;
Democrats are SURGING at exactly the right moment, but TWELVE races are still polling within 5 points -- too close!
If we can fully fund our Final Get Out The Vote Push,
NPR
reports that we can win: &ldquo;A good turnout operation can add one or two points, and in a tight race... that could make the difference.&rdquo;
But if we don&rsquo;t have enough grassroots support, we could see the Tea Party dominating on Election Day and McConnell leading the Senate -- a disaster you simply can&rsquo;t allow.
Friend, will you pitch in to our Final GOTV Push before the end-of-month deadline in 72 hours? We&rsquo;ll triple-match all gifts made today!

Michelle Obama wrote this morning, &ldquo;Far too much is at stake in this election to leave the outcome up to chance.&rdquo;
You CAN&rsquo;T sit back and hope we win. You have to FIGHT for the win -- by heeding Michelle&rsquo;s call to action and stepping up right now. If you do, we could be saying ADIOS to Mitch McConnell in a mere 7 days, and getting back to work on a progressive agenda!
