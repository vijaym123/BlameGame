Dear Friend,
As you receive this email, I will be returning to the United
States from Iraq and the Middle East.
I was there on an Oversight
Committee mission to review the status of our work to defeat ISIS and
evaluate our embassy, US facilities and personnel security.

In Baghdad, we were the first Congressional Delegation to
meet with the new Iraqi President and Minister of Defense.
We
also conferred with Christian and minority leaders to discuss their
plight.
In Erbil, Iraq we reviewed mutual efforts to eliminate ISIS
with the Kurdish Prime Minister and their Minister of
Defense.
I can report that you would be proud of our American service
men and women that I met on land, in the air and aboard the USS Carl
Vinson in the Arabian Sea who are all working nonstop for our
country.
We must keep them in our prayers.
As I
depart this troubled area of the world, I am thankful for their
commitment and that of the Canadian service personnel, who I met, and other
coalition partners who have pledged to defeat ISIS and the terrorist
threat.
I joined Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa and
Democrat Foreign Relations Committee Member Juan Vargas this week to
insure America and other nations win this battle and keep our citizens
safe at home and overseas.
With my regards and best wishes, I
remain
Sincerely,
John L. Mica
Member of
Congress

P.S.
On this day, we were told, while in Baghdad, 19 were killed in the
city of Baghdad where currently ISIS is on three sides of the
city.
The Kurds told us they lost 25 soldiers who were killed.
Yesterday, stopping ISIS from retaking the Mosul Dam, photos on TV here
showed ISIS beheading soldiers, then putting their heads on fence
spikes.
This was rather disturbing to say the
least.
