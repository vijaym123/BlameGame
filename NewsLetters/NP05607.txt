Statement on VA Firings
10/7/14
Today,
Congressman Doug Lamborn released the following statement in response to the
termination of four senior executives at the
VA.
"Today the VA announced the firing of four senior executives
that were responsible for patient neglect, the falsification of records,
and obstructing VA investigators as they attempted to get to the
bottom of the problems plaguing the VA. I n August, legislation that I cosponsored granted the Secretary of
the VA with new authorities to hold individuals accountable for
patient neglect and mismanagement. These firings are the first time that
these new tools have been exercised and are an encouraging indicator that
new VA Secretary Robert McDonald is serious about changing the
culture in the VA and rebuilding veteran trust, a process that must start
with removing bad actors that dont put our veterans
first. Although these actions are a step in the right direction, there are many more
individuals who presided over the widespread negligence and
mismanagement at the VA. They cannot be trusted with caring for our veterans
and must be held accountable as
well."

(CO-05)
