Congratulations to Military Academy
Nominees
This
week, we hosted a reception at our Hendersonville office for the 11th
District military academy nominees and their families. It is a true honor
to nominate 10 students from Western North Carolina for admission to
our highly-competitive service academies.

These impressive young
people went through a rigorous selection process, demonstrating their
leadership in the classroom, extracurricular activities and community
involvement. Each nominee would represent the 11th District with
distinction, and I commend their strong desire to serve our
country.

Swain County Payment Bill
Introduced
The Great
Smoky Mountains National Park Agreement Act of 2013, which I introduced
today, would authorize the release of funds already appropriated by
Congress to Swain County. It is my hope that this bill will cut through
the bureaucracy and put us on a path toward Swain County being paid in
full for the land they conveyed to the National Park Service more than
70 years ago.
Over the past year, I have worked with
Senator Hagan, former Congressman Shuler, Swain County officials, the
National Park Service and the Department of Interior to find resolution
on this issue, and this bill is a product of this effort. I look
forward to continuing to work with all parties and finally putting this
issue to rest. The federal government should keep its word to the people
of Swain County, and it is time that we correct the broken promises
of the past.
Congressional Record Presentation to Primitive
Quartet
On Friday, I had the honor of presenting members of the Primitive
Quartet with the official Congressional Record recognizing their 40-year
commitment to spreading the Gospel through music.
