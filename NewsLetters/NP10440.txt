Dear
Friends,
Hurricane season officially begins on June 1, and even though
experts are not expecting a very active season, it is still extremely
important that we take all the necessary steps to protect our families
and homes from those possible storms. It is better to be
over-prepared than to be caught by surprise.
As South Floridians, we know
too well the devastating effects of hurricanes. I can still remember
Hurricane Andrews catastrophic aftermath. Our local and federal
emergency personnel work hand-in-hand to prevent the loss of lives,
but we cannot depend completely on their availability during a natural
disaster; we must take precautionary measures to protect ourselves and
loved ones.
Plan
The first step in
preparation is having a well thought out emergency plan for you and your family;
you should be ready for any situation.
Your plan should
include an evacuation route that is easy to remember and follow, a central
meeting place in case loved ones get separated and a plan for your
pets, because a majority of shelters do not allow animals. Each member
of your household should have a copy of the plan along with close
relatives and friends. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
website is an excellent resource that provides detailed information and
additional emergency plans ( www.Ready.gov/hurricanes ).
Prepare
It is also imperative to maintain
a fully stocked disaster kit that includes: at least three to seven
gallons of water per person, non-perishable food such as canned food, a
first aid kit, a battery-powered radio, flashlights, extra batteries,
cash, and important legal documents. Now is the time to think about
additional items that you or family will need. This may include
medication for diabetes patients or diapers for a baby. Keep in mind that in
time of emergencies these items can become scarce so preparing
beforehand is vital.
If a hurricane were to strike, the mail service
may be stopped or delayed.
For those who currently receive
federal benefits, such as Social Security via the postal service, you may
want to consider receiving benefits electronically to prevent
delay.
Ready
Staying informed during a hurricane
watch or warning is crucial and helps secure your safety. Storms are
unpredictable, and change by the hour or even minutes. Make good use of the
National Weather Service and other weather services to track any new
developments of the storm. If power is lost, use your battery powered
radio to tune in to your local radio station for updates.
I
urge everyone to stay prepared, stay informed, and stay safe this
hurricane season. Please incorporate the hurricane information located on
my website into your hurricane plan at
ros-lehtinen.house.gov/resources/disasters-preparedness . Planning and
preparing with anticipation will bear fruit for you and your family
this hurricane season.
Sincerely,
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
