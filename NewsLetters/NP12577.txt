I Need Your Input
As we look ahead to 2014, I wanted to take the opportunity to hear your opinions and views on the issues facing our country. As your Representative in Congress, your input is important to me.
Click Here: Take the 2014 Issues Survey
In my first year representing Ohios 2nd District, some of my top priorities have been to meet and listen to Ohioans from all walks of life, tour local businesses, meet with students, and address veterans and their issues. In each of the districts eight counties, I have hosted both a town hall and Coffee with your Congressman to listen directly to you.
Unfortunately, Washington faces considerable gridlock . The issues I came to Congress to help solve: debt and deficits, jobs and economic growth, energy security, and health care reform
are not being adequately addressed.
In 2013, the House of Representatives passed legislation to:
Spur growth and job creation by limiting the overreach of federal bureaucracies (REINS Act)
Build the Keystone XL pipeline and secure energy independence
Improve and streamline job training programs (SKILLS Act)
Reform federal spending and balance the budget
Repeal, defund, and delay Obamacare
Unfortunately, the Senate has refused to consider them.
We still have a lot of work to do. Our employers and employees need tax reform to align our tax code with the 21st century economy. Our childrens generation deserves reforms that will ensure Social Security and Medicare are in place for them and so that
our
spending today is not
their
responsibility. Our Armed Forces need stability and certainty to be at the ready to protect our nation. We need to balance our federal budget.
I want to hear directly from you.
Please take a few minutes to let me know where you stand on the
pressing issues facing our nation.
Your input is needed as Congress weighs these issues in 2014.
In your service,
Brad Wenstrup
U.S. Representative
Ohios 2nd Congressional District
