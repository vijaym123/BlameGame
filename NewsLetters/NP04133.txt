Scott
Perry
NOVEMBER 27, 2014
Today, like millions of other families across America, Christy and I gather with our family and friends to share a Thanksgiving meal. Were thankful for the many generations that worked to make ours the greatest Nation the world has ever known.
We also remember and say a special prayer for our Service Members who serve tirelessly and selflessly to defend Her
especially the Soldiers, Marines, Sailors and Airmen far from home and facing danger.
To every resident of the 4th District, know that Im truly grateful for and humbled by the privilege of serving you.
From my family to yours, please enjoy a safe, happy, and blessed Thanksgiving.
