Dear Friend,
For this week's newsletter I wanted to take a break from talking about
my work in Congress and instead recognize Mother's Day and the
immeasurable impact mothers have on all of our lives.
My mom had her hands full raising two active kids (my younger brother
came along much later) in a small house. She was the rock upon which
our family was built. When my father was injured in a sudden workplace
incident, my mother took on even more responsibility, going back to
work and supporting him as he made his recovery while also managing our
household. Those were difficult days for our family, but my mother was
the glue that held us together. Her strength and dedication left a
lasting impression on me, and having her support throughout my life and
career has helped me through many trying times.
Today, I find myself in awe of another remarkable woman, my wife, Lisa,
the mother of our three children. Being in Congress and serving in the
U.S. Army Reserve means I spend a lot of time away from home. When I am
unable to be home, Lisa somehow finds the time and energy to be both
mother and father, while remaining active in our church and continuing
the volunteer work she does to support military families.
Being an
elected official can sometimes take a toll on our family, but Lisa
handles it all with grace, dignity, and a smile. Without her unwavering
support, and the support of my mother, I would not be the person I am
today.
I want to wish all of the mothers who receive my newsletter a very
happy Mother's Day. I do not know where we would be without you!
Sincerely,
DR. JOE HECK
Member of Congress
P.S. Meet the newest members of the Heck family!
Several months ago our beloved family dog Kahlua passed away,
devastating our family. After a number of family discussions, the
unanimous decision was made to adopt another dog. But one wasn't
enough! As Lisa said, "Why rescue one when we can rescue two?" I am
proud to introduce Denver [left] and Aspen [right], the newest members
of the Heck family. Denver, a malamute, husky and wolf mix weighing in
at nearly 150 pounds, is a good-natured, loveable pup who often forgets
his own size. Denver was raised together with Aspen, a female Siberian
Husky, who has proven to be quite crafty as she has already discovered
where her treats are hidden. We appreciate the opportunity to share our
new additions with you and hope that you consider adopting a rescue
animal if your family decides to bring home a pet.

Dear
Friend,
For
this
week's
newsletter
I
wanted
to
take
a
break
from
talking
about
my
work
in
Congress
and
instead
recognize
Mother's
Day
and
the
immeasurable
impact
mothers
have
on
all
of
our
lives.
My
mom
had
her
hands
full
raising
two
active
kids
(my
younger
brother
came
along
much
later)
in
a
small
house.
She
was
the
rock
upon
which
our
family
was
built.
When
my
father
was
injured
in
a
sudden
workplace
incident,
my
mother
took
on
even
more
responsibility,
going
back
to
work
and
supporting
him
as
he
made
his
recovery
while
also
managing
our
household.
Those
were
difficult
days
for
our
family,
but
my
mother
was
the
glue
that
held
us
together.
Her
strength
and
dedication
left
a
lasting
impression
on
me,
and
having
her
support
throughout
my
life
and
career
has
helped
me
through
many
trying
times.
Today,
I
find
myself
in
awe
of
another
remarkable
woman,
my
wife,
Lisa,
the
mother
of
our
three
children.
Being
in
Congress
and
serving
in
the
U.S.
Army
Reserve
means
I
spend
a
lot
of
time
away
from
home.
When
I
am
unable
to
be
home,
Lisa
somehow
finds
the
time
and
energy
to
be
both
mother
and
father,
while
remaining
active
in
our
church
and
continuing
the
volunteer
work
she
does
to
support
military
families.
Being
an
elected
official
can
sometimes
take
a
toll
on
our
family,
but
Lisa
handles
it
all
with
grace,
dignity,
and
a
smile.
Without
her
unwavering
support,
and
the
support
of
my
mother,
I
would
not
be
the
person
I
am
today.
I
want
to
wish
all
of
the
mothers
who
receive
my
newsletter
a
very
happy
Mother's
Day.
I
do
not
know
where
we
would
be
without
you!
Sincerely,
DR.

P.S.
Meet
the
newest
members
of
the
Heck
family!
Several
months
ago
our
beloved
family
dog
Kahlua
passed
away,
devastating
our
family.
After
a
number
of
family
discussions,
the
unanimous
decision
was
made
to
adopt
another
dog.
But
one
wasn&#8217;t
enough!
As
Lisa
said,
"Why
rescue
one
when
we
can
rescue
two?"
I
am
proud
to
introduce
Denver
[left]
and
Aspen
[right],
the
newest
members
of
the
Heck
family.
Denver,
a
malamute,
husky
and
wolf
mix
weighing
in
at
nearly
150
pounds,
is
a
good-natured,
loveable
pup
who
often
forgets
his
own
size.
Denver
was
raised
together
with
Aspen,
a
female
Siberian
Husky,
who
has
proven
to
be
quite
crafty
as
she
has
already
discovered
where
her
treats
are
hidden.
We
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
share
our
new
additions
with
you
and
hope
that
you
consider
adopting
a
rescue
animal
if
your
family
decides
to
bring
home
a
pet.
Thank
you
for
your
time,
and
please

me
your
thoughts
