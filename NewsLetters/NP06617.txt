-- Our biggest fundraising deadline of the election is TONIGHT
-- President Obama called on us to hit the goal by midnight -- We&rsquo;re going to fail to hit the goal
Unless things change quickly, we&rsquo;ll fail to live up to President Obama&rsquo;s expectations tonight.
That hasn&rsquo;t happened before. Every time he&rsquo;s asked us to step up, we&rsquo;ve met the challenge. But not tonight.
I still have hope, David. I wouldn&rsquo;t bother with this email if I didn&rsquo;t. But we&rsquo;ll need ALL our best supporters right now to step up. And there are only a few hours left.
David, will you give us a chance to hit this goal for President Obama? MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: ALL GIFTS TRIPLE-MATCHED! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
