Great news for South Central Kansas!
Its been a long haul, but the United States Air Force has just made its final decision to base the new KC-46A tankers at McConnell Air Force Base.
This decision represents the Air Forces continued support of and commitment to keeping McConnell Air Force Base the premier tanker refueling base in the world.
We can now count on the next generation of Air Force mobility being led from right here in Kansas.
This is only the latest in a long history of McConnells impressive service to our area and the rest of the nation, and there is no doubt that these fine airmen and the community that supports them will succeed in their new mission.
Thanks for all of the hard work of Friends of McConnell, the good folks of Derby and Wichita, Gov. Brownback, Sen. Pat Roberts, and Sen. Jerry Moran that led to this special day.
And, of course, a special thank you to the hardworking men and women of McConnell Air Force Base for continuing to demonstrate the kind of excellence that keeps America safe.
Sincerely,
Mike Pompeo
Member of Congress
