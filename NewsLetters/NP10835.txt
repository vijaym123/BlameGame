Dear Friends,
As Benjamin Franklin once
said, In this world
nothing can be said to be
certain, except death and
taxes. Were
just about 10 days away from
the deadline to file your
taxes for 2013, and I want to
ensure every Delawarean is
aware of the ways Delaware
and the IRS can make this
process as easy as
possible.
If you have questions
about filing taxes online,
the IRS
1040
Central
provides all of
the information youll
need to file your individual
tax return quickly and
easily. If youre
comfortable doing your taxes
and determining your
potential tax credits on your
own, you can use
IRS
Free File
and prepare
your taxes quickly and
without paying a cent.
If youre not
comfortable navigating the
tax forms online, try calling
302-286-1654 for help or
visiting one of the the
IRS Taxpayer Assistance
Centers in all three counties
that provide face-to-face
help and can ensure that you
save time and money on your
tax filings:
Kent
611 S. Dupont Hwy.,
Dover, DE 19901
New Castle:
844 King St.,
Wilmington, DE
19801
Sussex:
21309 Berlin Rd.
Unit 13, Georgetown, DE
19947
For elderly or low- to
moderate-income people who
cannot prepare their own
taxes, the IRS Volunteer
Income Tax Assistance Program
(VITA) and Tax Counseling for
the Elderly (TCE) provide
free, in-person help. To find
the nearest VITA or TCE
program for you or someone
you know, you can visit the
VITA/TCE
information page .
While most of us are
working on filing our 2013
tax returns, there are
thousands of Delawareans who
should also be filing returns
for 2010 they never filed
three years ago or claiming a
2010 refund that never made
it to their pocketbook. Did
you know that there are
nearly 4,000 Delawareans who
are leaving an average of
about $600 each in federal
tax refunds on the table from
2010? Fortunately, there is
still an opportunity to file
that return or claim that
money. But you have to act by
this April 15th so find out
how here:

I hope these resources
will help make your tax day
as smooth and straightforward
as possible. As always, you
can reach out about this, or
anything else, through
email
or
