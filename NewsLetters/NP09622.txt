VISITING DC
May 16, 2014
Yesterday, the Veterans Affairs committee held a
hearing on The State of VA Health Care.
During the hearing we
heard from Secretary Shinseki, Under Secretary Petzel, various veterans
groups, and oversight entities, like the Office of Inspector General
(OIG) and the Government Accountability Office (GAO). To watch the full
hearing,

I believe the hearing confirmed how systemic this problem is.
Veterans and their families across the country have faced delayed, or
in some cases, no access to health care. Given so many warnings and
red flags raised by the Inspector General and the Government
Accountability Office, this crisis can only be described as a dereliction of duty
on the part of senior leadership at the
VA.
We still have much to learn about the size and scope of
the problem at VA
this hearing is not the solution and certainly not
the end. VAs progress and the outcomes of the Inspector General's
various investigations will be closely monitored by Congress and will help
inform our next steps.

On Wednesday, Senator King and I
introduced legislation that would make it easier for service-disabled veterans
to do business with the federal government by eliminating confusing
differences between veterans contracting programs at the Department of
Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Small Business
Administration.
During their service, veterans gain
valuable knowledge and develop unique skills that are put to good use when
they return home and open a small business. To help these veteran-owned
businesses succeed, we should make sure there are clear-cut rules and
regulations that do not hinder their business's ability to prosper.
With this legislation we will ensure that our veterans don't have to
fight massive bureaucracy after returning home from war. Read more

On Thursday,
the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee held a hearing
entitled Progress and Challenges: Tobacco Use and Regulation in the
United States, which covered the Food and Drug Administrations
regulation of tobacco products.
At this hearing, I raised my serious
concerns about how federal regulations are hamstringing innovations that
would give Americans more choices and the ability to transition from
conventional cigarettes to tobacco products that are less
harmful.
I pressed the witnesses from the CDC and the FDA to look at the
science surrounding electronic cigarettes and not to lose sight of the
potential public health benefit of cigarette smokers transitioning to
non-combustible tobacco products. My remarks and questions from
todays hearing can be found

Richard
Burr
