Dear Friend,
I wanted to take a moment to update you on what the House is doing to
stop government abuse. This week, the House voted on a series of bills
that would rein in the Executive Branch, keeping them from making life
harder for everyday Americans. I've heard from many fellow citizens of
the bureaucratic and regulatory challenges that they face. Whether it's
a lack of government transparency or the government intentionally
targeting groups because of their political leanings, this type of
abuse of trust is unacceptable.
This week the House voted on several bills to increase transparency.
Taxpayers deserve to know that their hard-earned money is being used
responsibly and efficiently by the government. That's why we passed
H.R. 1423, the Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act. This bill would provide
taxpayers with a yearly report outlining whether government programs
were good stewards of taxpayer dollars. The American people deserve to
have transparency from their government, and this bill is a step in the
right direction.
The House also passed H.R. 3308, the Taxpayer Transparency Act of 2014,
a bill that I proudly cosponsor. This bill would require that all
government advertisements include a statement indicating that it was
paid for at taxpayer's expense. Congressional offices already abide by
this rule; it's time that the Executive Branch do too.
An issue that hundreds of Missourians have contacted me about is the
IRS targeting of Conservative groups. The power of taxation is one of
the most powerful tools the government has at its disposal. It is
unconscionable that the IRS would target political enemies for further
scrutiny. This week, the House took action to stop this abuse once and
for all. The House passed H.R. 3865, the Stop Targeting of Political
Beliefs by the IRS Act of 2014. This bill would prevent the IRS from
targeting individuals for further scrutiny for political reasons. I
believe the IRS should not be involved in politics, and this bill is an
important step to stopping government abuse.
I believe that government should work for the people, not against them.
That's why I'm proud to support legislation that gets government off
the backs of the people. I appreciate your time, and it's an honor to
be your voice in Congress.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
I
wanted
to
take
a
moment
to
update
you
on
what
the
House
is
doing
to
stop
government
abuse.
This
week,
the
House
voted
on
a
series
of
bills
that
would
rein
in
the
Executive
Branch,
keeping
them
from
making
life
harder
for
everyday
Americans.
I&#8217;ve
heard
from
many
fellow
citizens
of
the
bureaucratic
and
regulatory
challenges
that
they
face.
Whether
it&#8217;s
a
lack
of
government
transparency
or
the
government
intentionally
targeting
groups
because
of
their
political
leanings,
this
type
of
abuse
of
trust
is
unacceptable.
This
week
the
House
voted
on
several
bills
to
increase
transparency.
Taxpayers
deserve
to
know
that
their
hard-earned
money
is
being
used
responsibly
and
efficiently
by
the
government.
That&#8217;s
why
we
passed
H.R.
1423,
the
Taxpayers
Right-to-Know
Act.
This
bill
would
provide
taxpayers
with
a
yearly
report
outlining
whether
government
programs
were
good
stewards
of
taxpayer
dollars.
The
American
people
deserve
to
have
transparency
from
their
government,
and
this
bill
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction.
The
House
also
passed
H.R.
3308,
the
Taxpayer
Transparency
Act
of
2014,
a
bill
that
I
proudly
cosponsor.
This
bill
would
require
that
all
government
advertisements
include
a
statement
indicating
that
it
was
paid
for
at
taxpayer&#8217;s
expense.
Congressional
offices
already
abide
by
this
rule;
it&#8217;s
time
that
the
Executive
Branch
do
too.
An
issue
that
hundreds
of
Missourians
have
contacted
me
about
is
the
IRS
targeting
of
Conservative
groups.
The
power
of
taxation
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
tools
the
government
has
at
its
disposal.
It
is
unconscionable
that
the
IRS
would
target
political
enemies
for
further
scrutiny.
This
week,
the
House
took
action
to
stop
this
abuse
once
and
for

IRS

This
bill
would
prevent
the
IRS
from
targeting
individuals
for
further
scrutiny
for
political
reasons.
I
believe
the
IRS
should
not
be
involved
in
politics,
and
this
bill
is
an
important
step
to
stopping
government
abuse.
I
believe
that
government
should
work
for
the
people,
not
against
them.
That&#8217;s
why
I&#8217;m
proud
to
support
legislation
that
gets
government
off
the
backs
of
the
people.
I
appreciate
your
time,
and
it&#8217;s
an
honor
to
be
your
voice
in
Congress.
