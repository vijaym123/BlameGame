Dear
Friends,
Today we remember the 168 Oklahomans, including
young children, who were killed in an evil act of domestic terrorism
in Oklahoma City. We remember the rescue workers, the
firefighters and everyone who rushed to the scene to provide aid and extend
comfort. What arose from the rubble that day was the Oklahoma
Standard
strangers helping strangers,
giving sacrificially for the betterment of our great state.
Since then,
the rest of the nation has seen this rich characteristic on display
time and again as Oklahomans pull up their boots in trying times and
walk forward with hope that comes from banding
together.
Since the horrific event, hundreds of thousands of visitors from
around the world every year come to the Oklahoma City National Memorial
and Museum where they can seek comfort, strength, peace, and hope as
well as the opportunity to learn. I have held it as one of my
highest responsibilities over the course of the past two decades in the
Senate to ensure this place of remembrance is properly
resourced.
On Thursday, I joined my colleague Sen. James
Lankford in introducing a Senate resolution ( S.Res.139 ) that commemorates the 20th anniversary of the terrorist
attack, commends the remarkable efforts of the first responders,
and applauds the people of Oklahoma City for making tremendous
progress over the past two decades. Together the entire Senate, in passing
the resolution Thursday evening, recognized the perseverance
of Oklahomans as youve stood as a beacon to the rest of the United
States attesting to the strength of goodness in overcoming evil wherever
it arises in our midst.
May we stand in solidarity
today to remember the victims, to give thanks to first responders, and
to continue to pray for Oklahoma and the families and friends who lost
loved ones on April 19, 1995.
