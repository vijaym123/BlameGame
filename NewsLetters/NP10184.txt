Dear Friends,
We did it. After more than a year of building support for a select
committee to investigate the Benghazi attacks, we learned today that it
will finally become a reality. This news comes just a few days after I
had a long discussion with House GOP Leadership about the importance of
creating a select committee that can methodically delve into the
details and find answers. I also reiterated in that meeting what I've
said from the beginning, that my colleague Trey Gowdy is the person
most qualified to lead this investigation.
This week's revelations that the White House was not forthcoming in
turning over documents to the House of Representatives was
disappointing but not at all surprising. The Obama Administration has
been anything but transparent on this topic. The American people have
the right to know what happened before, during, and after the attacks
on Benghazi, how they could have been prevented, and why the
Administration continued to mislead the public about the cause of the
attack.
The investigations conducted by the various committees up until this
point have been very important. However, due to time restraints
established by the committees, their size, and the decentralized nature
of the process, the investigation had reached as far as it could
through traditional means. Only a select committee that is empowered
with the full authority of the legislative branch can investigate the
truth, and bring justice and closure to the families impacted by this
act of terrorism.
Blessing and Liberty,

Dear
Friends,
We
did
it.
After
more
than
a
year
of
building
support
for
a
select
committee
to
investigate
the
Benghazi
attacks,
we
learned
today
that
it
will
finally
become
a
reality.
This
news
comes
just
a
few
days
after
I
had
a
long
discussion
with
House
GOP
Leadership
about
the
importance
of
creating
a
select
committee
that
can
methodically
delve
into
the
details
and
find
answers.
I
also
reiterated
in
that
meeting
what
I&#8217;ve
said
from
the
beginning,
that
my
colleague
Trey
Gowdy
is
the
person
most
qualified
to
lead
this
investigation.
This
week&#8217;s
revelations
that
the
White
House
was
not
forthcoming
in
turning
over
documents
to
the
House
of
Representatives
was
disappointing
but
not
at
all
surprising.
The
Obama
Administration
has
been
anything
but
transparent
on
this
topic.
The
American
people
have
the
right
to
know
what
happened
before,
during,
and
after
the
attacks
on
Benghazi,
how
they
could
have
been
prevented,
and
why
the
Administration
continued
to
mislead
the
public
about
the
cause
of
the
attack.
The
investigations
conducted
by
the
various
committees
up
until
this
point
have
been
very
important.
However,
due
to
time
restraints
established
by
the
committees,
their
size,
and
the
decentralized
nature
of
the
process,
the
investigation
had
reached
as
far
as
it
could
through
traditional
means.
Only
a
select
committee
that
is
empowered
with
the
full
authority
of
the
legislative
branch
can
investigate
the
truth,
and
bring
justice
and
closure
to
the
families
impacted
by
this
act
of
terrorism.
