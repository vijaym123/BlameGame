Cutting Medicare Costs for Seniors
Dear Friends,
As the 114th Congress begins, controlling the rising cost of health care while protecting critical programs for seniors remain top priorities for me.
That&rsquo;s why I joined Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and four other colleagues to introduce the
Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act , legislation that would empower Medicare to negotiate for the best possible price of prescription medication for America&rsquo;s seniors who are enrolled in Medicare Part D. During my campaign for Senate, I pledged to join efforts to close this loophole in the Medicare program.
Allowing prescription drug price negotiation in Medicare would save billions of dollars without compromising care or shifting the cost burden onto seniors. The federal government should be allowed to negotiate for lower prices for Medicare recipients, just like the Department of Veterans Affairs does. I will continue to fight for these reforms on the Budget Committee and in my new role as a member of the Senate Aging Committee.
As we grapple with tough budget challenges, we cannot afford to put off commonsense reforms that lower health care spending and save taxpayer money.

Sincerely,
Senator Tim Kaine
