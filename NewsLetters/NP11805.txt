Dear Friend,
Thank you very much for signing up for our eNewsletter. I appreciate
the opportunity to serve as your Representative. I wanted to give you
this update on our activities in the Second District and Washington,
D.C.
Propane Crisis Solution
This week the House of Representatives helped address the current
propane crisis affecting the Second District and the nation as a whole.
The bitter cold has caused an unwelcome rise in heating costs,
resulting in financial strain for individuals and organizations across
Oklahoma's 2nd District. As a result, we worked to ensure the issues
with heating fuel transportation and distribution are resolved and
relief is finally available to thousands of Americans.
I was cosponsor of
H.R. 4076, the Home Heating Emergency Assistance
Through Transportation (HHEATT) Act of 2014 which passed the House and
now heads to the Senate. Large numbers of people being unable to heat
their homes becomes a public safety issue, and we had to provide
certainty to those in need of heat for their homes and businesses.
Click the picture below to hear my remarks on the House floor
discussing the propane crisis solution.
Last month the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Motor Carrier
Safety Administration (FMCSA), through an extension of an emergency
declaration, eased the federal hours-of-service regulations for areas
of the country critically affected by propane shortages.
This allowed
commercial trucks to quickly transport the much needed propane to
cities and states that were in desperate need. Even though the FMCSA
emergency declaration covers Oklahoma, it was only extended to March 1,
2014.
Rather than continually operating on 30-day emergency extensions, the
HHEAT Act extends the emergency declaration and eases the
hours-of-service regulations until May 31, 2014.
Extremely cold temperatures caused a spike in demand earlier this
winter. Additionally, the high use of propane for grain drying last
fall depleted some of the inventory prior to the onset of winter, and
the exporting of more than 20 percent of the country's propane caused a
shortage.
We enjoyed a visit from the Lillard Family of Miami this week in
Washington, D.C.
Conflict with Russia
Being on the opposite side of Russia in a conflict is nothing new for
the United States. History tells us that John F. Kennedy and Ronald
Reagan faced such conflicts while maintaining our country's safety as a
top priority. They boldly navigated what often seemed like impossible
circumstances, focusing on resolving the conflict swiftly and securely.
As a result, the United States came out of both events stronger than
before.
But instead of a committed focus to the current foreign policy conflict
with Russia, this week the President chose to make a politically-driven
speech on minimum wage in Connecticut. The lack of focus and the lack
of leadership displayed by this President show the difference between a
leader and a politician.
Protection from Obamacare Penalties
The President has, over the past year, delayed or changed numerous
portions of Obamacare. While businesses received a one-year exemption
from the enforcement of Obamacare employer mandate penalties, American
individuals and families were not offered that same suspension and
therefore will be financially penalized.
Knowing the shortcomings of Obamacare, the House worked to protect
people from the individual mandate penalty for the remainder of the
year - granting them the same relief given by the Obama Administration
to businesses.
H.R. 4118, "The SIMPLE Fairness Act" passed the House and is about
bringing some measure of fairness to the penalties that individuals
will face if they don't comply with this government-mandated fiasco.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that by enacting H.R. 4118,
the federal deficit would be cut by about $10 billion between the years
2014-2019.
The Oklahoma Association of Career and Technology Education stopped by
our Washington, D.C. office where we discussed the positive impact
Career and Technology Education has had on Oklahoma's business
community.
Reigning in Regulation
In Washington, I remain focused on reigning in the regulations and red
tape that hinder job growth. That's why I supported a bipartisan piece
of legislation that reduces red tape for construction projects that are
funded, undertaken or reviewed by the federal government-H.R. 2641, the
Responsibility And Professionally Invigorating Development (RAPID) Act.
A 2011 study found 351 projects that would translate into 1.9 million
jobs a year during construction, were stuck in the permitting process.
H.R 2641 streamlines and simplifies regulatory review and project
approvals for infrastructure, energy and other construction jobs. This
includes setting firm deadlines for environmental assessments and a
deadline for an Environmental Impact Statement.
Next Week
The House will respond to the countless episodes of executive overreach
through a series of bills next week. Additionally, we could see
consideration of H.R. 4015, the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) Repeal
and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014.

Dear
Friend,
Thank
you
very
much
for
signing
up
for
our
eNewsletter.
I
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
serve
as
your
Representative.
I
wanted
to
give
you
this
update
on
our

in
the
Second

Propane
Crisis
Solution
This

the
House
of
Representatives helped
address
the
current
propane
crisis
affecting
the
Second
District
and
the
nation
as
a
whole.
The
bitter
cold
has
caused
an
unwelcome
rise
in
heating
costs,
resulting
in
financial
strain
for
individuals
and
organizations
across
Oklahoma's
2nd
District.
As

we
worked
to
ensure
the
issues
with
heating
fuel
transportation
and
distribution
are
resolved
and
relief
is
finally
available
to
thousands
of

I
was
cosponsor

Emergency

Act
of

which
passed
the
House
and
now
heads
to
the
Senate.
Large
numbers
of
people
being
unable
to
heat
their
homes
becomes
a
public
safety
issue,
and
we
had
to
provide
certainty
to
those
in
need
of
heat
for
their
homes
and
businesses.
Click
the
picture
below
to
hear
my
remarks
on
the
House
floor
discussing
the
propane crisis
solution.
Last
month
the
U.S.
Department
of
Transportation
Federal
Motor
Carrier
Safety
Administration
(FMCSA),
through
an
extension
of
an
emergency
declaration,
eased
the
federal
hours-of-service
regulations
for
areas
of
the
country
critically
affected
by

shortages.
This
allowed
commercial
trucks
to
quickly
transport
the
much
needed
propane
to
cities
and
states
that
were
in
desperate
need.
Even
though
the
FMCSA
emergency
declaration
covers
Oklahoma,
it
was
only
extended
to
March
1,
2014.
Rather
than
continually
operating
on
30-day
emergency
extensions,
the
HHEAT
Act
extends
the
emergency
declaration
and
eases
the
hours-of-service
regulations
until
May
31,
2014.
Extremely
cold
temperatures
caused
a
spike
in
demand
earlier
this
winter.
Additionally,
the
high
use
of
propane
for
grain
drying
last
fall
depleted
some
of
the
inventory
prior
to
the
onset
of
winter,
and
the
exporting
of
more
than
20
percent
of
the
country&#8217;s
propane
caused
a
shortage.
We
enjoyed
a

in
Washington,

Conflict
with
Russia
Being
on
the
opposite
side
of
Russia
in
a
conflict
is
nothing
new
for
the
United
States.
History
tells
us
that
John
F.
Kennedy
and
Ronald
Reagan
faced
such
conflicts
while
maintaining
our
country&#8217;s
safety
as
a
top
priority.
They
boldly
navigated
what
often
seemed
like
impossible
circumstances,
focusing
on
resolving
the
conflict
swiftly
and
securely.
As
a
result,
the
United
States
came
out
of
both
events
stronger
than
before.
But
instead
of
a
committed
focus
to
the
current
foreign
policy
conflict
with
Russia,
this
week
the
President
chose
to
make
a
politically-driven
speech
on
minimum
wage
in
Connecticut.
The
lack
of
focus
and
the
lack
of
leadership
displayed
by
this
President
show
the
difference
between
a
leader
and
a
politician.
Protection
from
Obamacare
Penalties
The
President
has,
over
the
past
year,
delayed
or
changed
numerous
portions
of
Obamacare.
While businesses
received
a
one-year
exemption
from
the
enforcement
of
Obamacare
employer
mandate
penalties,
American
individuals
and
families
were
not
offered
that
same
suspension
and
therefore
will
be
financially
penalized.
Knowing
the
shortcomings
of
Obamacare,
the
House
worked
to
protect
people
from
the
individual
mandate
penalty
for
the
remainder
of
the
year
&#8211;
granting
them
the
same
relief
given
by
the
Obama
Administration
to
businesses.
H.R.
4118,
&#8220;The
SIMPLE
Fairness
Act&#8221;
passed
the House
and
is
about
bringing
some
measure
of
fairness
to
the
penalties
that
individuals
will
face
if
they
don&#8217;t
comply
with
this
government-mandated
fiasco.
The
Congressional
Budget
Office
estimates
that
by
enacting
H.R.
4118,
the
federal
deficit
would
be
cut
by
about
$10
billion
between
the
years
2014-2019.
The

the
positive
impact

Oklahoma's
business
community.

In
Washington,
I remain
