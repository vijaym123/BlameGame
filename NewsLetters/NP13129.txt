Congress Holds Line on Discretionary Spending for Fourth Year in Row,
First Time Since Korean War
Congress took a major step to hold the line on spending with passage of
the fiscal year 2014 Omnibus Appropriations bill - legislation that
cuts big-government programs, refuses to rely on tax increases and
protects national security from devastating defense cuts. Our most
basic responsibility is to fund government operations and we
accomplished that goal this week.
As Chairman of the Subcommittee that funds the Internal Revenue
Service, I made sure that Obamacare receives no additional funds from
the IRS under the legislation. We also prohibit this agency from using
funds to target groups based on political belief - a practice that has
no place in a free society.
For the fourth year in a row, Congress has cut discretionary spending,
an accomplishment that has not happened since the Korean War.
We are
serious about changing Washington's culture of spending to a culture of
saving and have matched words with action.
NOTE: You can view my Wednesday, House floor speech in support of the
fiscal year 2014 Omnibus on my official web site at

Naval Station Mayport Cruiser Funding in Omnibus
Tough fiscal choices are part of the job on Capitol Hill, but I will
not sacrifice our military infrastructure, including Navy ships that
still have years of life left in them, for short-term budget cuts.
That's why I supported the fiscal year 2014 Omnibus Appropriations bill
on Wednesday, joining my colleagues in passing a comprehensive
agreement that protects our national security and our troops wherever
they serve.
The bill retains funding for three Ticonderoga-Class cruisers at Naval
Station Mayport. These ships are a critical part of our fleet and are
needed to accomplish the national security missions asked of our Navy.
Under the legislation, the USS Gettysburg (CG-64), the USS Hue City
(CG-66) and the USS Vicksburg (CG-69) will continue to sail proudly,
and the sailors that serve on them will continue to be a part of the
Mayport community.

Americans Deserve Answers About Obamacare, House Passed Bill Will Help
Get Them
Americans should not have to rely on political spin from the
Administration as a substitute for the facts about Obamacare. They
deserve transparency about the implementation of our new health care
law.
The Exchange Information Disclosure Act, which passed the House on
Thursday with my support, takes necessary steps in that direction by
requiring detailed published reports about the number of signups,
interactions, and efforts to fix problems.
Every day it becomes clearer and clearer that the nation's new health
care law has not delivered on its promises. That's why I will continue
my fight to delay, defund and repeal Obamacare and replace it with
patient-centered health care reform that doesn't harm the economy or
hurt job creation.
