2014: Year in
Review:
Here is a quick look - by the numbers - of my work in 2014. My first
priority is to always put the concerns of Eastern Kansans first and
to continue listening and taking your advice to Washington. There is
more work to be done and I'm prepared to continue serving
you!
In 2014, my office helped many folks with their
veterans benefits, social security benefits, IRS issues, Medicare claims,
and much more. It can be difficult navigating the maze that is the
Federal Government, but my office is here to help you connect with the
appropriate Federal Agencyand partner with you through these sometimes
long and complicated cases. If you have any questions or concerns, I
encourage you to contact my office and see how I can be of any
assistance.
Happy New
Year:
Americas new Congress is eager to get to work on solutions that empower
all Americans and help everyone get ahead and achieve a better
life.
House Republicans will continue to pass legislation with
bipartisan support and find solutions to get our economy moving again,
lower healthcare costs, and put more money in peoples
pockets.
In the 114 th
Congress, House Republicans intend to
lead, and we hope the President will work with us
instead of acting
through executive action
to get our country back on
track.
