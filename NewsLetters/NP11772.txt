Dear Friends,
As we approach the election season, rules in the U.S. House of Representatives limit the types of communication my office can have with you during the 90 days before an election unless you have personally signed up to receive updates. My top priority is keeping you informed about what is going on in our Valley and my work on your behalf here in Washington DC. As the June 3rd California primary approaches, please visit my
Exercise your Right to Vote
page for useful information about voter registration and how to make your voice heard.
Communicating with you through
Facebook ,
Twitter , and email helps me keep a pulse on the issues that are important to you and our community. My e-newsletter is an especially valuable and cost-effective tool to keep our conversation going about how we can improve our Valley. I encourage you to stay engaged and consider
becoming a subscriber .
