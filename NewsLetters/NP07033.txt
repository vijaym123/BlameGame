Boehner&rsquo;s gonna be
FURIOUS . YESTERDAY
-- Boehner launched a massive $30 million ad blitz in an effort to secure his largest Congressional majority yet.
BUT TODAY
-- President Obama emailed you, and something AMAZING happened. YOU. STEPPED. UP. Now we&rsquo;re within range of a JAW-DROPPING 15,000 online donations for the day. That&rsquo;s just since 9am!!! David, this is exactly the kind of response President Obama was looking for!
If we can hit our goal, we&rsquo;ll be able to fight back against Boehner&rsquo;s ads and deliver him a humiliating defeat.
