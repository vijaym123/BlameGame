ICYMI: Rubio: Raise Ladders Of
Opportunity
In an op-ed for
The
South Florida Sun-Sentinel , Marco
highlighted the importance of restoring
the American Dream in the 21
st
century by increasing
access to opportunity. An excerpt of the
piece is below.
Lets take the example of a
single mom in Miami working at a fast
food restaurant and making $8 an hour.
What concrete things can we do to bring
the transformational power of the
American Dream within her reach?
Democrats will tell you the answer
is to simply raise the minimum wage.
But like nearly every other industry,
food service is rapidly changing due to
technological advances. Raising the
minimum wage will only pressure this
womans employer to move faster
toward the inevitable step of replacing
her position with a touchscreen or
similar technology.
To truly transform this
womans life, she needs the
opportunity to go from making $8 an
hour as a cashier to making $30 an hour
in her restaurants corporate
office, or in one of the many new
industries emerging in this
century.
To raise these ladders of
opportunity, our leaders need to focus
on three goals. First, we need to grow
the economy and accelerate the creation
of high-paying 21st century jobs.
Second, we need to help her access the
skills she needs for these jobs. And
third, we need to assist her with the
rising cost of living.

Rubio Congratulates NASA On Success
Of Orion Test Flight
On Friday, Marco issued the following
statement regarding the successful test
flight of NASAs Orion spacecraft
from Kennedy Space Center:
Id like to
congratulate NASA, Floridas
entire space community and all the
dedicated Americans who worked to make
Fridays test flight of the Orion
spacecraft an overwhelming success. The
Exploration Flight Test 1 mission was
an important step forward in
mankinds quest to discover and
explore the solar system, and in our
countrys goal of one day leaving
boot prints on Mars. Its a
testament to American ingenuity and
only the latest of many recent glimpses
into what lies ahead for the American
people in the 21
st
century.
Rubio Condemns Chinas
Suppression Of Democracy In Hong
Kong
Marco, the Ranking Member of the
Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on
East Asian and Pacific Affairs,
criticized the Chinese governments
response to peaceful protests in Hong
Kong and condemned its repressive,
authoritarian nature.
An excerpt of his remarks during
Wednesdays subcommittee hearing is
below:
Senator Rubio:
But heres my final
point. I think that the lesson to be
learned by all this is, that all this
talk out there
that the hopes
that these economic interchanges and
dialogue with China was going to change
the nature of the central government
is a fairytale. Its
wishful thinking. This government, as
its currently structured in China,
this is their nature
is to
control, to be authoritarian. And every
instance in which they have been
challenged in that, or challenged toward
more of a democratic or societal opening,
they have pushed back against. And Hong
Kong is the latest example of it.
And I think there is a lesson
to be learned there, that if we are
hanging our hopes on the fact that more
economic interchange with them is going
to somehow transform them into a more
open, more liberalized and more
inclusive government, it doesnt
seem that way at this point. Certainly,
from their reaction with whats
happened in Hong Kong. And I think
thats a factor that we need to
accept today as a reality, and base our
policy based on that reality because
this does not leave me hopeful that
this is a government, that at any point
in the near future, is going to be more
open and more accommodating.
In fact, it is the tactics of
a government thats becoming
increasingly more centralized, more
authoritarian and more willing to take
strong actions against those who
challenge the authority of the
Communist Party in the central
government. And I think that bodes ill
for the future of the region, and,
quite frankly, of the world as China
takes on a greater economic and
military importance.

Agency Updates
Scam Phone Calls Continue; IRS
Unveils New Video to Warn Taxpayers
IRS YouTube Video:
Tax Scams:
English
As incidents of an aggressive
telephone scam continue across the
country, the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) unveiled a new YouTube video with a
renewed warning to taxpayers not to be
fooled by imposters posing as tax agency
representatives.
The new Tax Scams video describes some
basic tips to help protect taxpayers from
tax scams.
These callers may demand money or may
say you have a refund due and try to
trick you into sharing private
information. Here are five things the
scammers often do but the IRS will not
do. Any one of these five things is a
tell-tale sign of a scam. The IRS will
never:
Call to demand immediate payment,
nor will the agency call about taxes
owed without first having mailed you a
bill.
Demand that you pay taxes without
giving you the opportunity to question
or appeal the amount they say you
owe.
Require you to use a specific
payment method for your taxes, such as
a prepaid debit card.
Ask for credit or debit card
numbers over the phone.
Threaten to bring in local police
or other law-enforcement groups to have
you arrested for not paying.
If you get a phone call from someone
claiming to be from the IRS and asking
for money, heres what you should
do:
If you know you owe taxes or think
you might owe, call the IRS at
1.800.829.1040. The IRS workers can
help you with a payment issue.
If you know you dont owe
taxes or have no reason to believe that
you do, report the incident to the
Treasury Inspector General for Tax
Administration (TIGTA) at
1.800.366.4484 or at
www.tigta.gov .
If youve been targeted by
this scam, also contact the Federal
Trade Commission and use their
FTC Complaint Assistant
at FTC.gov. Please add "IRS Telephone
Scam" to the comments of your
complaint.
Remember, too, the IRS does not use
email, text messages or any social media
to discuss your personal tax issue. For
more information on reporting tax scams,
go to
www.irs.gov
and type
scam in the search box.
Additional information about tax scams
is available on IRS social media sites,
including YouTube
http://www.youtube.com/user/irsvideos
and Tumblr
http://internalrevenueservice.tumblr.com ,
where people can search
scam to find all the
scam-related posts.
