Dear David,
As we sink into the cold winter months,
poor families and young people in our state are looking at their energy
bills and trying to ensure they can enjoy the holidays with their
families without having to worry about making ends meet. Bad energy
policies hurt the most vulnerable in our state the most, which is why I've
been very outspoken against the EPA's onerous regulations - and I'll
continue to fight the Obama Administration's gross executive over-reach
in Washington.
Yesterday, I
spoke
on the Senate floor about several costly regulations that hurt our
state, and I highlighted my support for U.S. Senator Rand Paul's (Ky.)
bill , the "REINS Act," which would require
Congress to approve every new major rule proposed by the executive branch
that has an annual economic impact of $100 million or more. I also
discussed my
introduction
of the "ENFORCE the Law
Act," which would help ensure the president upholds his constitutional
obligation to "take care that the laws be faithfully
executed."
Last week, I filed
comments
urging the EPA to
withdraw the Clean Power Plan rule for existing power plants, which
is an unprecedented, sweeping action to regulate the entire U.S.
electric power sector. I also strongly
criticized
the
Obama Administration's Thanksgiving Eve decision to launch what's been
called the "most expensive regulation ever."
I recently
spoke
about
this topic at the Senate GOP Leadership Stakeout, and stressed the fact
that bad energy policies disproportionately hurt the poorest families
and young people in Missouri. And I
addressed
the Missouri Farm Bureau's 100th annual meeting on Monday, where I
discussed
the administration's proposed Clean Water
Act (CWA) rule, which represents a massive land grab.
I am
calling
on the administration to conduct a full
analysis of all their proposed regulations and share the impact of
those regulations on families and job creators. If you'd like to read
more, I hope you'll check out my recent
op-ed
on
this topic, and join the conversation online by visiting my

Sincere regards,
Washington D.C.
