Last week, I wrapped up my District Work period by visiting Wilcox
County Farm Bureau to talk to farmers, attending the Vietnam Traveling
Memorial Wall Opening Ceremony in Ashburn, and speaking at American
Textile Company's expansion in Tifton.
American Textile's continued
investment in Tifton highlights the fact that South Georgia is open for
business.
I applaud the company's efforts to not only expand within
the US, but to also reinforce their commitment to the area and create
jobs in the state of Georgia
.
This August, I traveled 2,312 miles to visit 19 out of the 24 counties
in the Eighth District.
Along with constituent
meetings, "Coffee with Your Congressman" events, and small business
tours, I visited 6 rural healthcare facilities, toured 13 manufacturing
facilities, and spoke at 11 public engagement and civic groups.
I had the privilege to hear from many of you on the issues that concern
you most, and I look forward to carrying your thoughts and concerns
back up to Washington tomorrow.
It is an honor to serve as a voice for
the Eighth Congressional District of Georgia.
To view photos from some of my tours and visits, please visit my
facebook

I look forward to heading
back up to Washington on behalf of the Eighth District to focus on our
nation's defense, creating a pro-growth business environment, and
getting America's economy back on its feet.
Sincerely,
Austin Scott
Member of Congress
