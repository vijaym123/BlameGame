This week, I also hosted several listening sessions and hear about the issues that are important to you. In Lake County, I sat down with residents of Hawthorne Retirement Community, Lake Port Square Community, and Kings Ridge. It was a pleasure interacting with so many constituents, and I was grateful to hear their thoughts and concerns.

The Orlando Union Rescue Mission celebrated their 65th anniversary on Wednesday, and I was honored to recognize their faithful service. Since 1948, the Orlando Union Rescue Mission has provided both physically and spiritually for the homeless community of Central Florida. Those who seek refuge at the Mission are provided nutritious meals, safe shelter, and personal development programs that equip them to lead fulfilling, self-sufficient lives. In celebration of their 65th anniversary, the Orlando Union Rescue Mission featured 65 individuals who, upon successful completion of the Mission's programs, have been freed of the burdens of homelessness.

Constituent Corner:
In August, a veteran from Auburndale was surprised to receive a letter informing him that his retirement pay was being suspended. He had recently changed banks and the paperwork had not been imputed in a timely manner, resulting in the check being returned and triggering the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) to suspend benefits.
Although the constituent had the Social Security office verify his identity, the issue was not resolved. Our office contacted DFAS and provided an alternative to have the Auburndale Police Department (APD) confirm his identity. After contacting both DFAS and APD on behalf of the constituent, my office was able to get the correct information provided to DFAS and a check was deposited into the constituents new account.

Veterans Day Update:
On Veterans Day, we honor the men and women who have selflessly served our great nation. I am humbled and grateful to remember the sacrifices that have been made by veterans for our safety and freedom. Since our founding, the United States military has not only faithfully defended our country, but also defended our friends around the world against their enemies. As a result of their unrelenting heroism, liberty continues to triumph over tyranny and terrorism.
We owe our veterans a debt that we can never repay. It is my privilege to express appreciation and support for our veterans who have served our country so faithfully and sacrificed so much on our behalf.
