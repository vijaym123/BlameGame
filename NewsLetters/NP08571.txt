June 20th, 2014
Dear Friend,
This week marked the 149th anniversary of Juneteenth, my work to bring
senior VA officials to Memphis paid off, and I voted to ensure that our
troops have the resources they need to stay safe and protected as they
defend the United States from international threats. I also announced
my next "Building a Healthier Memphis" wellness event, and a new report
came out that shows Tennesseans are saving almost 70% on their health
insurance through the Affordable Care Act's tax credits. Keep reading

Bringing Senior VA Leadership to Memphis to Address Veterans' Concerns
Any delay in providing care to the brave men and women who risked their
lives for our safety is unacceptable, and they deserve to receive the
highest quality of care available. Since reports calling into question
the quality of care provided at the Memphis VAMC were uncovered, I have
repeatedly requested that high-ranking VA officials visit our facility
to ensure that the agency fully understands the needs of the Memphis
veteran community here on the ground.
This week, my efforts to secure a visit from senior leadership at the
U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs have paid off, with Acting Deputy
Under Secretary for Health for Operations and Management Jan Murphy set
to visit the Memphis Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) next week,
tour its medical facilities, and meet with Mid-South veterans to
address their concerns. This visit by senior VA leadership will also
serve to reassure the nearly 200,000 veterans served by the VA Medical
Center in Memphis that the Department takes safety concerns seriously
and is working to address them.
While the Memphis VA under the leadership of Director C. Diane Knight
has implemented the recommendations of the VA Inspector General, I have
also been working closely with President Obama's administration to
bring senior VA leadership to Memphis. I am pleased that Deputy Under
Secretary Murphy has accepted my invitation and will be able to address
our veteran community's concerns in person.
Veterans who would like to attend the Town Hall meeting should RSVP to
my Memphis office at 901.544.4131. Due to space constraints, proof of
veteran status will be required.
Building a Healthier Memphis
More than 8 million Americans have enrolled in high-quality, affordable
health insurance coverage through the marketplaces created by President
Obama's landmark health care reform law. With so many Americans now
enrolled, President Obama is right when he says "the Affordable Care
Act is here to stay."
The Affordable Care Act is already helping millions of Americans get
covered and receive the care they need, but we can do more. In
February, I launched my "Building a Healthier Memphis" series on health
and wellness in the Ninth District with a panel discussion and
education session focused on racial disparities in breast cancer
outcomes in Memphis; I continued the series in April with an event
focused on stemming the rising tide of diabetes diagnoses in Memphis.
During these events, experts have helped identify how Memphians can
take advantage of provisions of the President's Affordable Care Act
that include no co-pay and no deductible preventive services to address
the disparities and improve outcomes for themselves, their families,
and their communities.
I am pleased to invite you to my next event in my "Building a Healthier
Memphis" series on the Tuesday, July 8th at Church Health Center
Wellness beginning at 9:30 AM. I hope you can join us for a discussion
about maternal health and infant mortality, an issue that
disproportionately affects Memphis families. If you are interested in
attending, please RSVP to 901.544.4131.
Commemorating Juneteenth
On June 19, 1865, Major General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston,
Texas and announced in the town square that all slaves were free.
Although this came nearly three years after the issuance of the
Emancipation Proclamation, the newly freed men and women rejoiced in
the streets with jubilant celebrations, and thus, the Juneteenth
holiday was born.
This year, the Memphis Juneteenth celebration was very different from
past celebrations. First, the Board of Directors changed the name of
the celebration from the 'Juneteenth Freedom & Heritage Festival' to
the 'Juneteenth Urban Music Festival.' Second, the celebration took
place in the Robert R. Church Park on Beale Street in Downtown Memphis
instead of the historic Douglass Neighborhood, where the celebration
has taken place for the past twenty years. The importance of this
change in location to the Robert R. Church Park is especially
significant to the celebration of this important day in history because
Robert R. Church continues to be a prominent and revered political
figure in Memphis for his work to make the processes of government
inclusive to all members of society, regardless of race or social
class. As such, the Juneteenth celebration this year focused on the
same mission: expanding the Juneteenth celebration so that thousands
more people may take place in this joyous celebration.
This year, the celebration included a variety of musical performances
varying from gospel performers to neo soul artists. In addition to
these performances, the celebration offered a poetry slam and a
showcase featuring majorettes, drummers, cheerleaders, and steppers. By
appealing to all members of the community and relocating to a larger
space, the Juneteenth celebration provided the people of Memphis with a
celebration that was consistent with the mission of Robert R. Church: a
mission of inclusiveness that we should all strive for as we continue
to serve the people of our great nation.
Saving Memphians Money on Their Health Insurance
Earlier this week, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
released a report
showing that Tennesseans saved an average of almost 70% on
health insurance plans with tax credits selected through the
HealthCare.gov marketplace. With the tax credits available through the
Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplace, the average
Tennessean's monthly premium dropped from $281/month to just $86/month.
The report also found that nearly 80% of Tennesseans selected plans
with tax credits and those who selected silver plans, the most popular
plan type, paid just $78 per month for their insurance. Of the
Tennesseans who selected insurance plans with tax credits, 42% paid $50
per month or less.
This new report makes it clear the President's landmark health care
reform law is achieving its goal of making high-quality, affordable
health coverage a right, not just a privilege. With Tennesseans saving
more than 2/3rds on their health insurance coverage, there can be no
question that the Affordable Care Act is working. But while the law is
working and Memphians are seeing many of the law's benefits, thousands
of Tennesseans are without coverage because of Govornor Haslam's
refusal to expand our state's Medicaid program, TennCare. It is time
for Republican leaders to put the political brinksmanship behind them
and stop blocking the law's benefits and end their attempts to take the
law's protections away from the American people.
Stopping Animal Abuse and Cruelty
Hundreds of animal rights advocates came to Washington this week to
support a bill that Republican Congressman Ed Whitfield of Kentucky and
I have sponsored to prevent the cruel horse training method known as
"soring." How we treat animals is a direct reflection of our character,
both as individuals and as a society. When we allow the mistreatment
and disrespect of any conscious being, we also devalue our own
humanity. And there can be no question, soring is animal cruelty, plain
and simple.
In an era of partisan gridlock, our PAST Act is a rare diamond in the
rough that has broad bipartisan support and a large consensus that
agrees with preventing soring. The PAST Act proves that Congress can
still come together to find common ground. 292 members of the House and
56 Senators from all across the political spectrum are cosponsoring our
bill.
Now, we just need House Leadership to bring it to the floor so that
Congress can have its say. I am confident that, if Speaker Boehner
allows a vote on our bill, it will pass overwhelmingly. With two-thirds
of the House and a majority of the Senate already in support of the
PAST Act, I hope that the outpouring of grassroots support this week at
the PAST Act Walk on Washington helps convince my colleagues in the
Capitol that it is time to ensure that horses are treated humanely and
that we need to act to prevent this horrendous form of animal abuse.
Protecting our Environment and Saving Money
On Wednesday, I introduced the Clean and Efficient Public Safety
Vehicles Act of 2014 to help municipal public safety and law
enforcement agencies save money on fuel costs and reduce their negative
effects on our environment. Many emergency vehicles like ambulances
must run continuously in order to power critical on-board systems. But
this constant engine idling uses significant amounts of fuel while
waiting at the scene of an emergency or while waiting to be called into
action. My bill will encourage local government agencies like fire and
police departments to invest in technology that reduces both fuel
consumption and environmental impacts, which will save local
governments money and protect the air we breathe.
Stopping New Taxes on the Internet
This week, the House Judiciary Committee approved the Permanent
Internet Tax Freedom Act, which I have cosponsored to help keep
internet access tax free. Taxing internet service hurts low-income
families and stifles expansion into underserved areas that need access
to this critical, essential service.
President Obama Seeking Mentors for Young People
It is important that all children can count on caring adults who are
engaged in their lives, but too many young people lack this important
support. That's why President Obama is calling on Americans to sign up
as long-term mentors to young people through his new "My Brother's
Keeper" initiative. The President is seeking people from all walks of
life who want to develop sustained and direct mentoring relationships
that will play vital roles in the lives of young people in Memphis and
around the country. If you are interested in signing up to help young
adults in our city stay on track, you can do so here
.
Make Sure to Claim Unclaimed Property
The State of Tennessee maintains a searchable database of unclaimed
property, which can include bank accounts, stocks and dividends, wages,
refunds, insurance payments, gift certificates, credit balances and
overpayments, and a number of other things. There is no cost for
accessing the database, and you may find that you are owed money or
property. If you have not searched the database yet or if you haven't
searched in a while, you can visit https://www.claimittn.gov
and see for yourself whether the state is holding
any property or assets for you. And you may pass this information along
to your friends and family as well!
As always, I remain.
Most sincerely,
Steve Cohen

Any

in
providing

to
the
brave
men
and
women
who
risked
their
lives
for
our
safety
is
unacceptable,
and
they
deserve
to
receive
the
highest
quality
of
care
available.
Since
reports
calling
into
question
the
quality
of
care
provided
at
the
Memphis
VAMC
were
uncovered,
I
have
repeatedly
requested
that
high-ranking
VA
officials
visit
our
facility
to
ensure
that
the
agency
fully
understands
the
needs
of
the
Memphis
veteran
community
here
on
the
ground.
This
week,
my
efforts
to
secure
a
visit
from
senior
leadership
at
the
U.S.
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
have
paid
off,
with
Acting
Deputy
Under
Secretary
for
Health
for
Operations
and
Management
Jan
Murphy
set
to
visit
the
Memphis
Veterans
Affairs
Medical
Center
(VAMC)
next
week,
tour
its
medical
facilities,
and
meet
with
Mid-South
veterans
to
address
their
concerns.
This
visit
by
senior
VA
leadership
will
also
serve
to
reassure
the
nearly
200,000
veterans
served
by
the
VA
Medical
Center
in
Memphis
that
the
Department
takes
safety
concerns
seriously
and
is
working
to
address
them.
While
the
Memphis
VA
under
the
leadership
of
Director
C.
Diane
Knight
has
implemented
the
recommendations
of
the
VA
Inspector
General,
I
have
also
been
working
closely
with
President
Obama&#8217;s
administration
to
bring
senior
VA
leadership
to
Memphis.
I
am
pleased
that
Deputy
Under
Secretary
Murphy
has
accepted
my
invitation
and
will
be
able
to
address
our
veteran
community&#8217;s
concerns
in
person.
Veterans
who
would
like
to
attend
the
Town

should
RSVP
to

Due

Building
a
Healthier
Memphis
More
than
8
million
Americans
have
enrolled
in
high-quality,
affordable
health
insurance
coverage
through
the
marketplaces
created
by
President
Obama&#8217;s
landmark
health
care
reform
law.
With
so
many
Americans
now
enrolled,
President
Obama
is
right
when
he
says
&#8220;the
Affordable
Care
Act
is
here
to
stay.&#8221;
The
Affordable
Care
Act
is
already
helping
millions
of
Americans
get
covered
and
receive
the
care
they
need,
but
we
can
do
more.
In
February,
I
launched
my
&#8220;Building
a
Healthier
Memphis&#8221;
series
on
health
and
wellness
in
the
Ninth
District
with
a
panel
discussion
and
education
session
focused
on
racial
disparities
in
breast
cancer
outcomes
in
Memphis;
I
continued
the
series
in
April
with
an
event
focused
on
stemming
the
rising
tide
of
diabetes
diagnoses
in
Memphis.
During
these
events,
experts
have
helped
identify
how
Memphians
can
take
advantage
of
provisions
of
the
President&#8217;s
Affordable

that
include
no
co-pay
and
no
deductible
preventive
services
to
address
the
disparities
and
improve
outcomes
for
themselves,
their
families,
and
their
communities.
I
am
pleased
to
invite
you
to
my
next
event
in
my
"Building
a
Healthier
Memphis"
series
on
the
Tuesday,
July
8th
at
Church
Health
Center
Wellness
beginning
at
9:30
AM.
I
hope
you
can
join
us
for
a
discussion
about
maternal
health
and
infant
mortality,
an
issue
that
disproportionately
affects
Memphis
families.

Commemorating
Juneteenth
On
June
19,
1865,
Major
General
Gordon
Granger
arrived
in
Galveston,
Texas
and
announced
in
the
town
square
that
all
slaves
were
free. Although
this
came
nearly
three
years
after
the
issuance
of
the
Emancipation
Proclamation,
the
newly
freed
men
and
women
rejoiced
in
the
streets
with
jubilant
celebrations,
and
thus,
the
Juneteenth
holiday
was
born.
This
year,
the
Memphis
Juneteenth
celebration
was
very
different
from
past
celebrations.
First,
the
Board
of
Directors
changed
the
name
of
the
celebration
from
the
&#8216;Juneteenth
Freedom
&amp;
Heritage
Festival&#8217;
to
the
&#8216;Juneteenth
Urban
Music
Festival.&#8217;
Second,
the
celebration
took
place
in
the
Robert
R.
Church
Park
on
Beale
Street
in
Downtown
Memphis
instead
of
the
historic
Douglass
Neighborhood,
where
the
celebration
has
taken
place
for
the
past
twenty
years.
The
importance
of
this
change
in
location
to
the
Robert
R.
Church
Park
is
especially
significant
to
the
celebration
of
this
important
day
in
history
because
Robert
R.
Church
continues
to
be
a
prominent
and
revered
political
figure
in
Memphis
for his
work
to
make
the
processes
of
government
inclusive
to
all
members
of
society,
regardless
of
race
or
social
class.
As
such,
the
Juneteenth
celebration
this
year
focused
on
the
same
mission:
expanding
the
Juneteenth
celebration
so
that
thousands
more
people
may
take
place
in
this
joyous
celebration.
This
year,
the
celebration
included
a
variety
of
musical
performances
varying
from
gospel
performers
to
neo
soul
artists.
In
addition
to
these
performances,
the
celebration
offered
a
poetry
slam
and
a
showcase
featuring
majorettes,
drummers,
cheerleaders,
and
steppers. By
appealing
to
all
members
of
the
community
and
relocating
to
a
larger
space,
the
Juneteenth
celebration
provided
the
people
of
Memphis
with
a
celebration
that
was
consistent
with
the
mission
of
Robert
R.
Church:
a
mission
of
inclusiveness
that
we
should
all
strive
for
as
we
continue
to
serve
the
people
of
our
great
nation.
Saving
Memphians
Money
on
Their
Health
Insurance
Earlier
this
week,
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
released
a
report
showing
that
Tennesseans
saved
an
average
of
almost
70%
on
health
insurance
plans
with
tax
credits
selected
through
the
HealthCare.gov
marketplace.
With
the
tax
credits
available
through
the
Affordable
Care
Act&#8217;s
health
insurance
marketplace,
the
average
Tennessean&#8217;s
monthly
premium
dropped
from
$281/month
to
just
$86/month.
The
report
also
found
that
nearly
80%
of
Tennesseans
selected
plans
with
tax
credits
and
those
who
selected
silver
plans,
the
most
popular
plan
type,
paid
just
$78
per
month
for
their
insurance.
Of
the
Tennesseans
who
selected
insurance
plans
with
tax
credits,
42%
paid
$50
per
month
or
less.
This
new
report
makes
it
clear
the
President&#8217;s
landmark
health
care
reform
law
is
achieving
its
goal
of
making
high-quality,
affordable
health
coverage
a
right,
not
just
a
privilege.
With
Tennesseans
saving
more
than
2/3rds
on
their
health
insurance
coverage,
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
Affordable
Care
Act
is
working.
But
while
the
law
is
working
and
Memphians
are
seeing
many
of
the
law&#8217;s
benefits,
thousands
of
Tennesseans
are
without
coverage
because
of
Govornor
Haslam&#8217;s
refusal
to
expand
our
state&#8217;s
Medicaid
program,
TennCare.
It
is
time
for
Republican
leaders
to
put
the
political
brinksmanship
behind
them
and
stop
blocking
the
law&#8217;s
benefits
and
end
their
attempts
to
take
the
law&#8217;s
protections
away
from
the
American
people.
Stopping
Animal
Abuse
and
Cruelty
Hundreds
of
animal
rights
advocates
came
to
Washington
this
week
to
support
a
bill
that
Republican
Congressman
Ed
Whitfield
of
Kentucky
and
I
have
sponsored
to
prevent
the
cruel
horse
training
method
known
as
&#8220;soring.&#8221;
How
we
treat
animals
is
a
direct
reflection
of
our
character,
both
as
individuals
and
as
a
society.
When
we
allow
the
mistreatment
and
disrespect
of
any
conscious
being,
we
also
devalue
our
own
humanity.
And
there
can
be
no
question,
soring
is
animal
cruelty,
plain
and
simple.
In
an
era
of
partisan
gridlock,
our
PAST
Act
is
a
rare
diamond
in
the
rough
that
has
broad
bipartisan
support
and
a
large
consensus
that
agrees
with
preventing
soring.
The
PAST
Act
proves
that
Congress
can
still
come
together
to
find
common
ground.
292
members
of
the
House
and
56
Senators
from
all
across
the
political
spectrum
are
cosponsoring
our
bill.
Now,
we
just
need
House
Leadership
to
bring
it
to
the
floor
so
that
Congress
can
have
its
say.
I
am
confident
that,
if
Speaker
Boehner
allows
a
vote
on
our
bill,
it
will
pass
overwhelmingly.
With
two-thirds
of
the
House
and
a
majority
of
the
Senate
already
in
support
of
the
PAST
Act,
I
hope
that
the
outpouring
of
grassroots
support
this
week
at
the
PAST
Act
Walk
on
Washington
helps
convince
my
colleagues
in
the
Capitol
that
it
is
time
to
ensure
that
horses
are
treated
humanely
and
that
we
need
to
act
to
prevent
this
horrendous
form
of
animal
abuse.
Protecting
our
Environment
and
Saving
Money
On
Wednesday,
I
introduced
the
Clean
and
Efficient
Public
Safety
Vehicles
Act
of
2014
to
help
municipal
public
safety
and
law
enforcement
agencies
save
money
on
fuel
costs
and
reduce
their
negative
effects
on
our
environment.
Many
emergency
vehicles
like
ambulances
must
run
continuously
in
order
to
power
critical
on-board
systems.
But
this
constant
engine
idling
uses
significant
amounts
of
fuel
while
waiting
at
the
scene
of
an
emergency
or
while
waiting
to
be
called
into
action.
My
bill
will
encourage
local
government
agencies
like
fire
and
police
departments
to
invest
in
technology
that
reduces
both
fuel
consumption
and
environmental
impacts,
which
will
save
local
governments
money
and
protect
the
air
we
breathe.
Stopping
New
Taxes
on
the
Internet
This
week,
the
House
Judiciary
Committee
approved
the
Permanent
Internet
Tax
Freedom
Act,
which
I

Taxing

President
Obama
Seeking
Mentors
for
Young
People
It
is
important
that
all
children
can
count
on
caring
adults
who
are
engaged
in
their
lives,
but
too
many
young
people
lack
this
important
support.
That&#8217;s
why
President
Obama
is
calling
on
Americans
to
sign
up
as
long-term
mentors
to
young
people
through
his
new
&#8220;My
Brother&#8217;s
Keeper&#8221;
initiative.
The
President
is
seeking
people
from
all
walks
of
life
who
want
to
develop
sustained
and
direct
mentoring
relationships
that
will
play
vital
roles
in
the
lives
of
young
people
in
Memphis
and
around
the
country.
If
you
are
interested
in
signing
up
to
help
young
adults
in
our
city
stay
on
track,
you
can
do
so
here .
Make
Sure
to
Claim
Unclaimed
Property
The
State
of
Tennessee
maintains
a
searchable
database
of
unclaimed
property,
which
can
include
bank
accounts,
stocks
and
dividends,
wages,
refunds,
insurance
payments,
gift
certificates,
credit
balances
and
overpayments,
and
a
number
of
other
things.
There
is
no
cost
for
accessing
the
database,
and
you
may
find
that
you
are
owed
money
or
property.
If
you
have
not
searched
the
database
yet
or
if
you
haven&#8217;t
searched
in
a
while,
you
can
visit
https://www.claimittn.gov
and
see
for
yourself
whether
the
state
is
holding
any
property
or
assets
for
you.
And
you
may
pass
this
information
along
to
your
friends
and
family
as
well!
As
always,
I
remain.

sincerely,
