Friends,
Its hard to forget the
first job you ever had and the invaluable lessons it embeds in your
mind. For me, my first job was working construction every summer with
my father. Id be lying to you if I said I woke up every day itching to
get to the construction site - it was hard work and we all know that
summers in North Carolina can be scorching - but I would end every day
with a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment.
I learned a
lot of lessons building houses that I still carry with me today: the
value of a hard days work, the importance of teamwork and the
necessity of a solid foundation devoid of
cracks.
Much like the foundation of a building, our nation
is built on a solid foundation carefully planned and established by our
Founding Fathers. This foundation is our Constitution, which created
three branches of government and a unique set of checks and balances
to ensure that one single branch does not become too powerful and that
all branches remain responsive to the will of the people. It laid out
a detailed blue print for each branch of government and designed each
to uphold the laws of the land.
One thing the Constitution
makes clear - it's Congress' job to write our laws and the Presidents
job to enforce those laws.
To quote President Obama directly,
...
I am obliged to execute the law. That's what the Executive
Branch means. I can't just make the laws up by
myself.
Despite his admission to the very clear
guidelines of our Constitution, President Obama chose to single-handedly
act on his own and rewrite our immigration laws, granting amnesty to
nearly five million illegal immigrants. Ever since then, I have been
working with my colleagues in Congress to find the best tactic to
successfully block the Presidents illegal actions.
Two weeks ago, I
led my like-minded conservative colleagues to call on House Republican
Leadership
demanding
that we stand firm in our
efforts to oppose the Presidents executive action and immediately ban
funding for its
implementation.
Friends, Im pleased to announce that last week the
House took
action
to do just that.
Not only
did we fund the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in a
responsible manner, but in a series of amendments to the DHS funding bill, we
one by one:
blocked the Presidents executive
amnesty,
rolled back the prosecutorial discretion that
allowed him to turn a blind eye to those in the country
illegally,
prohibited funding for further Deferred Action
applications,
forced the Administration to treat any illegal
immigrants convicted of any form of domestic abuse or sexual crime as the
highest priority for deportation,
and put the needs of
American workers and those who arrived in our country legally before those
who cheated the system.
In addition to blocking
the Presidents illegal executive amnesty,
this legislation
champions conservative reforms that make the most out of each tax dollar
to invest in critical security and law enforcement efforts that
protect our nation against threats and strengthen security at our
borders.
By pursuing illegal
executive actions, President Obama established a dangerous precedent that
erodes our stable foundation and threatens the stability of our
nation.
I share the belief with the American people that the rule of
law must be upheld, not unilaterally changed at the whim of a
President.
I made a promise that I would fight to block the
Presidents unconstitutional actions and Im proud of the legislation the House
passed last week.
Now, it's up to the Senate to continue the
fight and put this critical legislation on the President's desk to
make him choose between the will of the American people and our nations
rule of law or his unconstitutional, unilateral
actions.
Until
next week,
Richard
Hudson
Member of Congress (NC-08)
