non-profit dedicated to supporting and advocating for active-duty military

(Hon. Steve and Patti Stockman)
The Jewish holiday of Passover &amp;
Christianity's holiest day, Easter, share millennia of history, themes of
redemption, hope and growth, even signature foods, rarely do they
coincide. This year, thanks to the dynamics of the lunar calendar, the
basis of the Jewish year, they also share a weekend.
Both
Passover and Easter are to be commemorated and remembered as a time of
redemption and freedom from bondage.
May you experience the
joy of this Easter and Passover
season.
