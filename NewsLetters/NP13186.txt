Holding the Department of "Injustice" Accountable
Dear Friend,
On Thursday, I objected to the decision by Eric Holder's Department of
Justice to grant early release to Lynne Stewart, a former lawyer
convicted of aiding terrorism. News reports suggest a massacre of
tourists in Egypt may have occurred because of her actions.
Eric Holder's Department of "Injustice" continues to ignore the rule of
law and common sense. Lynne Stewart's early release is a travesty of
justice. After being found guilty of her treasonous acts, she was
sentenced to a meager 10 years in prison. And now she's getting out
early? It's unfathomable that a traitor and facilitator of terrorism
would ever see the outside of a cell. Americans are disgusted and I
again call on Attorney General Holder to resign immediately. His lack
of regard for justice continues unabated. Click HERE

No More Taxypayer Bailouts
On Wednesday, I announced my co-sponsorship of the ObamaCare Taxpayer
Bailout Prevention Act (H.R.3541), which prevents taxpayer bailouts
under ObamaCare. This legislation repeals the part of ObamaCare that
grants the Obama Administration unilateral authority to establish a
program that could result in taxpayer-funded bailouts of companies
forced to do business under ObamaCare.
Hardworking taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook for ObamaCare's
failures. We simply can't allow this Administration to pass bad policy
and then bail itself out to avoid admitting that ObamaCare is an
unworkable disaster. I urge my colleagues to act swiftly to pass this
bill. Click HERE
to read more about this.
Protecting ObamaCare Identity Theft Victims
On Friday, I voted in favor of and the House passed the Health Exchange
and Transparency Act (H.R. 3811), which requires the Obama
Administration to notify within two business days any individual whose
personal information has been unlawfully accessed through an ObamaCare
exchange. Any private business that used sloppy and negligent safety
methods that resulted in a breach of private information would be held
accountable in a court of law.
The Federal Government should have at
least some similar responsibility.
Millions of Americans were required to enter their personal information
on a website that the Obama Administration knew was insecure and was
not fully tested. Now these people are at risk for identity theft.
While I will continue to fight for a full repeal of ObamaCare, this
bill is a step toward protecting Americans from one of the many harmful
effects of ObamaCare. Click HERE

Nominating Future Leaders
On Monday, I nominated 9 young men from the Fourth Congressional
District to attend the United States Service Academies. These young
people are some of our nation's best and brightest. I'm proud of their
patriotism, their dedication and their commitment to serve and defend
our nation. I'm confident they will grow into true leaders at their
academies.
The nominees went through a competitive interview process with my
Review Board, which consists of Gen. Jim Hunt, Lt. Col. Robert Leech
and 1st Lt. Jim Muhr. The honor of attending a service academy comes
with an obligation and commitment to serve in the military for a
minimum of five years upon graduation. Click HERE

Accountable
Dear

On

the

Eric

Department
of

to
grant
early
release
to
Lynne

And

It&#8217;s

Americans
are

and
I
again

His
lack
