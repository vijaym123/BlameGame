Sexual violence on college campuses is a crisis .
It's an issue of particular importance in our region, home to one of
the largest concentrations of colleges and universities in the
nation. Over the last several weeks, I've worked with some of our region's
top experts on campus safety issues to develop recommendations for
reducing assault and ensuring victims receive the care they
need.
We're also working to protect your sensitive
personal data from cyberattack. This week I chaired a hearing on the
work being done by both law enforcement and the private sector to keep
your personal information secure.
Meanwhile, my
colleagues and I in the House of Representatives continue our work to reduce
the burdens of big government on our job creators, eliminate wasteful
spending, and hold the Obama administration accountable for its
failures implementing Obamacare

Students on Campus from Sexual Violence
Congressman Meehan meets with the Campus Sexual Violence
Advisory Council at Penn State-Brandywine on March 17,
2014
Law enforcement statistics indicate that as many as one in five
females will be the victims of rape or attempted rape during their time
in college. While colleges, law enforcement and federal agencies
have taken important steps towards preventing sexual assault on
campus, there's more that can and should be done both to prevent assault
and protect victims.
Earlier this
year, President Barack Obama ordered the creation of a White House Task
Force to examine the issue of sexual assault and develop policies to
combat it. Our region has significant experience in campus safety
issues, and this experience can benefit and inform the White House's work.
That's why I formed the Campus Sexual Violence Advisory Council of
Southeastern Pennsylvania, made up of experts like the Vice President for
Public Safety at the University of Pennsylvania, the Executive
Director of the Clery Center for Security on Campus, and the superintendent
of the Radnor Township Police
Department.
On Monday, our advisory council unveiled a report that made concrete
recommendations to the White House Task Force.
I co-authored an op-ed in the Philadelphia Inquirer that
summarizes our
findings.
Protecting Your Personal Information
Recent data
breaches like those that occurred at Target and Neiman Marcus
demonstrate just how serious the threat of cybercrime is to American
consumers. As Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee's Subcommittee
on Cybersecurity, I've introduced legislation that will strengthen the
federal government's ability to prevent cyberattack while protecting
Americans' privacy.
On Wednesday, I
chaired a hearing at Drexel University that examined the issue of
cybercrime in depth, as well as how we're responding to it. We heard testimony
from experts including Delaware County District Attorney Jack Whelan,
representatives from the Secret Service and the FBI, as well as the
president of a local bank.

School, the winner of the 2014 Congressional Art Competition, on April 10,
