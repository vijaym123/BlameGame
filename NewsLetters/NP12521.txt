2014
I am proud to announce that I
have taken on two new leadership positions in the House Appropriations
Committee. I was appointed to the Appropriations Subcommittee on
Defense and the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Science
(CJS). I will continue serving in my leadership role as Chairman of
the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, which I have held
since 2013.
I am incredibly
thankful my neighbors who continue to send me to Washington to vote on their
behalf, including those in uniform. My new committee assignment to
Defense will allow me to battle for our troops on a whole new level. We
have to make military readiness a priority. I will remain committed to
ensuring our soldiers and their families receive the proper care,
training, equipment and support they need to protect this great
nation
On Monday, February, 3, I voted to pass
H.R. 357 , the G.I. Bill Tuition Fairness Act of
2013. This bill passed the House by a vote of 390-41. ( See Roll Call #33 ). H.R. 357, would expand education opportunities
for veterans by allowing them to attend the state-run higher-education
institution of their choice at the in-state tuition
rate.
On Wednesday, February 5, I voted to pass
H.R. 3590 , the Sportsmens Heritage and Recreational
Enhancement Act of 2013. This bill passed the House by a vote of 268-154.
(See
Roll Call #41 ). H.R. 3590 is a bipartisan
package of eight individual bills to protect Texans right to fish and
hunt.
It will remove government roadblocks to on certain public
lands and cuts through the red tape that threatens to block or limit
access to hunting and fishing.
The bill protects American jobs and
economic growth by supporting recreational opportunities on these
federal lands.
