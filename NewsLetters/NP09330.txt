This success isnt spontaneous, but the result of serious conversations and hard work over the course of the last year. My colleagues and I worked together to ensure our men and women in uniform and their families have the support they need. Im proud to be a part of the 53 rd
consecutive, bipartisan NDAA to pass the House Armed Services Committee.
