Congressional Report
Dear Friend,
Today, I would like to provide you with some updates from my work week in Washington, D.C.
Service Academy Day at UTSA
Bexar County Outreach Coordinator, Pete Arguello, is pictured here at an event my office hosted in collaboration with other local organizations to provide more information on the nomination process to U.S. service academies.
Last weekend, my office hosted the annual Academy Day at University of Texas San Antonio in collaboration with other local organizations. It was an information session for students, parents, counselors and educators regarding the five service academies
the United States Military Academy, the United States Merchant Marine Academy, the United States Naval Academy, the United States Coast Guard Academy and the United States Air Force Academy, and the nomination process for congressional offices.

Housing and Urban Development Grant for Colonias
On Tuesday, my office joined the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to announce $1.6 million in grants to stimulate job growth and business opportunities in chronically underserved rural areas along the Texas-Mexico border region.
My Hidalgo County Outreach Coordinator, Alexis Gallegos, attended the event along with HUD Region VI Administrator, Tammye Trevio.
My Hidalgo County Outreach Coordinator met with officials from USDA, HUD, and other agencies to discuss ways my office can collaborate and create more affordable housing opportunities in the Valley. Left to Right:

Improving the quality of life for people living in
colonias
has been a priority of mine both as a Texas state legislator and as a member of Congress.
I represent part of the over 1,300
colonia
communities in Hidalgo, Starr, Webb, and Zapata Counties and many people living in those areas suffer from a lack basic services that negatively impacts their quality of life.
This is especially true in regards to resources for job growth and business development.
I am very pleased to see this federal investment benefitting these areas in my district and I thank the Department of Housing and Urban Development and Tammye Trevio in particular for recognizing and working to meet the need in these communities.
HUD announced grants to the following organizations:
Laredo Veterans Ceremony
In addition to honoring the group of Laredo Veterans, my outreach coordinator was able to speak with them about issues that are currently affecting veterans residing in District 28.
On Sunday, my staff had the opportunity to honor a group of veterans in Laredo. They presented a Congressional Certificate of Recognition and a US Flag flown over the Capitol, which will be displayed in the office of Veterans Service Officer David Garza. Thank you for your service and defense of our country.
