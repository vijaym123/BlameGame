Greetings,
This past Thursday, President Obama addressed the nation and committed an overreach of his Executive authority.
Instead of working with Congress to craft a true solution to the immigration crisis, as required under the Constitution, the President proposed we simply ignore current law and provide legal status for nearly five million illegal immigrants.
Immigration is a wonderful American tradition, which is why we have a thorough process in place for those who wish to enter America legally.
To ignore that system sets a dangerous precedent by placing politics ahead of the rule of law.
My office has assisted many Kansans who have patiently gone through the process of our immigration system, which can take years for some.
Is the message now that we are a country that promotes the lawlessness of bypassing the rules countless others had to follow?
Nearly 100 people from 36 countries gathered at Intrust Bank Arena
on February 3, 2014 for their Naturalization Ceremony.
President Obamas action will only serve to exacerbate the underlying problem and drive more people to illegally cross our borders.
Instead of ignoring our laws, the White House should finally enforce them by ending the flood of illegal immigrants at our borders.
Thank you to those of you who have called into my office to share your concern about the Executive Order.
Rest assured I will do everything in my power to see the rule of law returned.
Kansans deserve better from Washington and the President.
Sincerely,
Mike Pompeo
Member of Congress
