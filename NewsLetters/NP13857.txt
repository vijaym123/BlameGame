Dear Friends,
As we sit down with family and friends this Thanksgiving, I wanted to share with you a few ways to offer a helping hand in your neighborhood.
By visiting the
Feeding America
website, you can easily find locations of local food banks in Connecticut. There, you can discover ways to support these food banks through a variety of volunteer opportunities.
You can also check out
United We Serve
for resources to help you assist military families and veterans this holiday season. Whether at home or abroad, these men and women have dedicated their lives to keeping us safe and deserve the support of their communities.
Wishing you and yours a safe and cheerful Thanksgiving this year!
Sincerely,
