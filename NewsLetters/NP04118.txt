Happy Thanksgiving
For many of us, Thanksgiving is a time to gather with family and friends, give thanks for our many blessings, and hopefully enjoy a home-cooked meal. On this day we often reflect on the passing year and express gratitude for all of the good that has happened, and the people who have been there along the way.
This year, I am thankful for our men and women in uniform as well as their families, especially those who are currently deployed. It is not uncommon for members of our military to spend the holiday season apart from their families. This is one of the many sacrifices our servicemen and women make in order to protect our freedoms, and I am most thankful for their commitment.
If you are missing a family member or friend this holiday season I encourage you to visit my
Facebook
page and share a special message.
I hope you and your family have a blessed and Happy Thanksgiving.
In your service,
Steven M. Palazzo
Member of Congress
