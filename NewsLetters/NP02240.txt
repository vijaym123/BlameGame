Friend,
Six years ago the Supreme Court began hearing arguments in the Citizens United v. FEC case. They eventually ruled to allow corporate special interests to spend unlimited money to buy our elections.
That&rsquo;s why I cosponsored the Government by the People Act
to give a voice back to the American people and reduce the power of corporate special interests.
It&rsquo;s time to remove the &ldquo;for sale&rdquo; sign from our elections and give the power back to the people&mdash; sign your name in support of campaign finance reform.
We have lived with Citizens United for too long and now it&#39;s time to restore our democracy.
But if we are serious about campaign finance reform, we can&rsquo;t stand idly by--
add your support today.
Be well,
Ami
