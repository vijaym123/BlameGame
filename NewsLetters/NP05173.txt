An out-of-state billionaire dumped $2 MILLION on Chicago T.V. to beat up Brad&rsquo;s record.
A brand new poll showed Brad
trailing
Republican Bob Dold by 2 points.
Ok, at this point, we were feeling like things were outside of our control. But then, something AMAZING happened...
Supporters from every corner of Illinois and across the country stepped up for Brad!
As of 3:05 PM we&rsquo;re within range of hitting 5,000 donations for Brad --
just this week!
If we can hit this mark by midnight, it&rsquo;ll be a
STUNNING comeback
for our campaign.
But if we fall short, we could be in
DEEP TROUBLE
heading into the final 11 days of this election.
According to our records, it looks likes you haven&rsquo;t had a chance to chip in for Brad this week.
