The Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in
Citizens United
sent our democracy down a dark road -- one where outside special interests can spend millions of dollars to try and buy our elections.
Super PACs can form and spend money against candidates at will. Special interest groups can spend millions of dollars without disclosing where it comes from. And we&rsquo;re expected to pay no attention to the Big Oil Koch brothers behind the curtain.
We need to reverse the effects of
Citizens United.
We need to peel back that curtain once and for all.
And we need your help to do it. I've teamed up with some allies to gather support to reverse
Citizens United . Join us -- add your name today.
Tea Party Republicans in the Senate just blocked an attempt to reverse
Citizens United . Surprised? I&rsquo;m not. As a recent study featured in the Washington Post pointed out:
&ldquo; Citizens United
elected more Republicans.&rdquo;
Republicans in the Senate are looking out for themselves -- and simultaneously putting the Kochs before middle class families. But one small loss doesn&rsquo;t mean we back down.
If we&rsquo;re going to stop
Citizens United , we have to do the work. We have to put in the time. We build a network stronger than ever before. Add your name to our petition to stop
Citizens United
right now.
Thank you for all of your help.
