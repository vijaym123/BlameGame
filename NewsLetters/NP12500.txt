Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
On Thursday evening, I attended the West Orange Chambers Annual Big Orange Awards presentation. Several prominent leaders from West Orange County were recognized for their contribution to the community, including Walter Toole. Walter and Patty Toole own several Ace Hardware stores in the Central Florida area, and Walter was presented with the 2013 Danniel J. Petro Bright Future of West Orange award. This award is given in recognition of entrepreneurial tenacity and steadfast determination that facilitates opportunity through investment in community and lifelong relationships that keeps our future bright. I was honored to also present Walter with a copy of the Congressional Record, recognizing his commitment to the Central Florida community.

Florida board members from the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals came to my office this week to discuss current aspects of the housing industry. Local representatives from the Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) also met with me this week to talk about the commercial real estate situation in Central Florida and discuss tax reform and other legislation that affects their industry.

This week, a delegation of Peruvian congressional leaders came for a meeting to discuss certain political reforms that they could implement in order to make their legislative process more transparent and open to the public. When I was Speaker of the Florida House, there were specific changes that I made to open up the process, push down the pyramid of power, and allow every legislative member to be a significant contributor. I have been advocating for many of these same reforms in Washington, and was happy to share them with the congressional leaders visiting from Peru as well.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Recently, a constituent from Mount Dora called my office after being informed by the IRS that the dollar amounts he had submitted on his tax return did not match the numbers that were submitted by his related financial entities. After researching the situation, the constituent was able to provide documents showing that the numbers actually did match. When the constituent called my office, we placed a call and submitted a Congressional inquiry to the Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS). Within a short time, my office received a phone call from TAS stating that IRS had indeed made a mistake and the taxpayer would be receiving a letter of apology from the IRS.
Constituent Services is a critical element to the work that my office provides on a local level. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need help navigating its bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.
The IRS also offers a service called IRS Free File, which is a unique public-private partnership that makes free federal tax filing available to almost all taxpayers. Fourteen commercial companies freely offer their brand-name software for individuals or families who made $58,000 or less last year. Free File is available from January 17-Ocotber 15, 2014, and is
available online .
Share Your View:
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a report this week that estimates Obamacare will result in the equivalent of over two million fewer full time workers in the labor force over the coming year. Rather than recognizing this tragedy, the White House actually embraced this announcement, claiming that reduced hours somehow benefited families trying to make ends meet.
Do you believe that the Executive Branch should continue to impose more regulations and tell Americans what is best for them, their employment, or their families?

Legislative Update:
Outdoor recreational activities like hunting and fishing are an important part of our American tradition. This week, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3590, the Sportsmens Heritage and Recreation Enhancement (SHARE) Act, to ensure that this heritage remains protected. I voted in support of this bipartisan legislation that cuts down on government red tape and emphasizes the protection of our Second Amendment rights.
The SHARE Act covers many aspects of outdoor sportsmanship, including protecting access for hunting and fishing on public lands and supporting recreational shooting. In accordance with the Second Amendment, this legislation protects the use of traditional ammunition and fish tackle, while eliminating specific unnecessary government regulations.
