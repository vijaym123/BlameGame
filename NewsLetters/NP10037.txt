Discussing Benghazi Developments on Fox
News
On Friday, I appeared on Fox News with host
Gretchen Carlson to discuss the House of Representatives' latest
efforts to get answers from the Administration surrounding the 2012
Benghazi terrorist attack that left four Americans dead, including U.S.
Ambassador to Libya Chris
Stevens.
Following new revelations this week that the White House
witheld crucial documents from Congress, the House Oversight and
Government Reform Committee, on which I serve, subpoenaed Secretary of
State John Kerry. Speaker Boehner also announced his intention to
bring a resolution on the floor calling for
the
formation of a Select Committee focused on getting to the bottom of this
tragic incident.
You can watch my appearance below:
Victory
for Habitat for Humanity and Other Nonprofits
I'm very pleased to announce that earlier this week the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) decided to make changes to
its mortgage rules to ensure access to credit for certain nonprofit
organizations. This is a huge victory following a lengthy battle on
Capitol Hill.
The issue was first brought to my attention by a constituent, who
informed me that Henderson County Habitat for Humanity, an organization
that helps provide low-income homeownership opportunities to families,
was being hurt by harsh rules intended to regulate big banks, credit
unions and other traditional mortgage
providers.
I sponsored legislation and
sent numerous letters to CFPB to have these rules changed, and was
ultimately victorious. This change in policy will protect organizations
that serve those in need in our community and in communities across
the nation.

Meeting With Young
Republicans
Debbie
and I had the privilege of meeting with several members of the
Buncombe County Young Republicans while traveling in the District last week.
It's always a pleasure to meet with up-and-coming young
leaders.
National Day of Prayer
2014
On the annual National Day of Prayer,
I took time to reflect on the many blessings we enjoy as a nation.
My prayers this year were for the continued safety and security of
our great nation and for the brave men and women in our armed forces
who fight to defend and protect our
freedoms.
