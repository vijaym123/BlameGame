We had a big deadline...
But then, David
And we
crushed
it!
So far this cycle, we&rsquo;ve received over 5,000 online donations from all corners of Illinois, and even across the country!
That&rsquo;s incredible! And with your help, David, we&rsquo;re one step closer to keeping the Tea Party out of Illinois. But, if we&rsquo;re going to win in November, it&rsquo;s absolutely critical we keep our momentum going strong.
