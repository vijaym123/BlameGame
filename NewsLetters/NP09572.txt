Rep. Mark Takano Celebrates Two-Year Anniversary of Work for Warriors
Program - Announces Additional Funding
Last week, Representative Mark Takano celebrated the two-year
anniversary and the success of the California National Guard's "Work
for Warriors" employment program, which has helped more than 2,400
unemployed and underemployed guardsmen and reservists find jobs.
Takano also announced that the Work for Warriors program will be
receiving an additional $1 million in funding from the Department of
Defense, and that he will be introducing legislation that will create a
pilot program for other states to replicate the California National
Guard's success.
At the event, Takano said, "Work for Warriors has worked incredibly
well in its two years of existence, especially for Riverside County
residents Captain Joel Barret, who found a job selling clean energy at
SolarCity, and for Specialist Derek Ramirez, who was unemployed for 10
months before hearing about Work for Warriors. I relayed their stories,
and the twenty four hundred others to the Department of Defense and I'm
proud to announce that they have agreed to an additional $1 million in
funding to the Work for Warriors Program.
"We need to replicate the success of the Work for Warriors Program.
That's why I will be introducing legislation with Representative Cook
called the Work for Warriors Act that will create a pilot program that
will explore taking Work for Warriors nationwide. This would enhance
the efforts of the Department of Defense as they look to provide
employment services to members of the Guard and Reserve. We know how
successful the program is and I believe that it can be replicated. Two
thousand four hundred guardsmen have been placed in jobs so far, and I
know that that number is bound to grow."
"The National Guard is a force built on the support of strong
communities and civic leaders," said Maj. Gen. David S. Baldwin,
adjutant general of the CNG. "Without the support of leaders like
Representative Takano and patriotic employers, this vital program might
not exist and thousands of our service members still might be out of a
job."

other
states
to
replicate
the
California
National

success.
At
the
event,
Takano
said,
&#8220;Work
for
Warriors
has
worked
incredibly
well
in
its
two
years
of
existence,
especially
for
Riverside
County
residents
Captain
Joel
Barret,
who
found
a
job
selling
clean energy
at
SolarCity,
and
for
Specialist
Derek
Ramirez, who
was
unemployed
for
10 months
before
hearing
about
Work
for Warriors.
I
relayed
their
stories,
and
the
twenty
four hundred
others
to
the
Department
of Defense
and
I&#8217;m
proud
to
announce that
they
have
agreed
to
an
additional
$1
million
in funding
to
the
Work
for
Warriors
Program.
&#8220;We
need
to
replicate
the
success
of
the
Work for
Warriors
Program. That&#8217;s
why
I
will
be
introducing
legislation with
Representative
Cook called
the
Work
for
Warriors
Act
that will
create
a
pilot
program
that will
explore
taking Work
for
Warriors
nationwide.
This
would
enhance
the
efforts
of
the Department
of
Defense
as
they look
to
provide
employment
services to
members
of
the
Guard
and Reserve. We
know
how
successful
the
program
is
and
I
believe that
it
can
be replicated.
Two
thousand
four
hundred
guardsmen have
been
placed
in jobs
so
far,
and
I
know
that
that
number
is
bound to
grow.&#8221;
&#8220;The
National
Guard
is
a
force
built
on
the
support
of
strong
communities
and
civic
leaders,&#8221;
said
Maj.
Gen.
David
S.
Baldwin,
adjutant
general
of
the
CNG.
&#8220;Without
the
support
of
leaders
like
Representative
Takano
and
patriotic
employers,
this
vital
program
might
not
exist
and
thousands
of
our
service
members
still
might
be
out
of
a
job.&#8221;
