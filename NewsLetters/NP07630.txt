Rep. Miller Votes for Legislation to Promote Michigan as International Tourist Destination
Washington
&#8211; Today, U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10) issued the following statement after House passage of
the
Travel Promotion, Enhancement, and Modernization Act of 2014 that reauthorizes Brand USA, a public-private partnership designed to increase international tourism in the U.S., including Michigan, through
its promotion of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation&#8217;s Pure Michigan campaign:
&#8220;Leveraging the partnership between public and private sectors with shared interests in tourism, Brand USA has helped promote the U.S. as a premier destination for international travelers. In 2013 alone, reports show the public-private
partnership accounted for approximately 1.1 million additional international visitors and $3.4 billion in additional revenue, including new tourists to Michigan through Brand USA&#8217;s promotion of Pure Michigan.
&#8220;Using fees collected by foreign visitors and private contributions, Brand USA helps draw tourists to Michigan, generating revenue and jobs for our local communities. Today&#8217;s passage of the
Travel Promotion, Enhancement, and Modernization Act is an important step to ensuring our tourism industry remains a vibrant part of our economy.&#8221;
The
Travel Promotion, Enhancement, and Modernization Act of 2014 (H.R. 4450):
Launched in 2010 under the Travel Promotion Act (TPA), Brand USA is a non-profit, public-private partnership that assists in financing an international advertising campaign for the United States as a travel
destination. Under Brand USA, a $10 fee is assessed once every two years on visa-free international visitors who enter the United States under the Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). This federal contribution
is capped at $100 million a year and requires a matching contribution from the U.S. tourism industry.
Under current law, TPA and Brand USA will expire on September 30, 2015. H.R. 4450 would extend these efforts through September 30, 2020.
