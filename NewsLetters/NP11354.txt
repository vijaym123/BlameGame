Dear Friends,
This is a final reminder about our water rally tomorrow at 9:00 am at Fresno City Council Chambers, 2600 Fresno Street. It will take place just before the House Natural
Resources Committee holds a field hearing on the water crisis. I hope you, your friends, and your family will join me and numerous other Members of Congress in sending the message that the Valley needs more water now.
Sincerely,
Devin Nunes
MEMBER OF CONGRESS
