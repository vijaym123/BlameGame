Friend,
We&#39;ve got a race on our hands.
After we emailed you this morning, we learned that Doug Ose has reserved nearly $1.4 million in TV ads over the next six weeks.
That comes on top of the millions that outside groups have already spent, and the millions that national Republicans have committed to spend between now and the election - which is a mere 48 days from now.
We need to hit this $10,000 goal, and we need to hit it quickly. Click here and give $5 or more right now.
Our second ad started running today, and every dollar we raise will help us keep it on the air. The ad contrasts why I&#39;m in Congress with why Doug Ose wants to return to Congress.
The differences are stark.
Congress should be a place of service.
Click here and help me keep it that way.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
PS - I&#39;m doing everything I can to win this thing, but I need your help. It&#39;s vital that we keep this ad up on the air - to do that, we need to hit $10,000 by Friday.
Please click here and give what you can right now.
