Rubio: Summit Of The Americas Going
From Bad To Worse
Earlier this week, Marco commented on
Panamas
detainment of Cuban activist Rosa
Mara Pay
the week before
hosting the Summit of the Americas and
called on the Panamanian government to
guarantee that all members of
Cubas democratic movement, along
with those from Venezuela and every other
country, be welcomed to the Summit and
encouraged to exercise their free speech
rights.
Rubio: What happened in
Panamas airport this weekend
sent a chilling message to members of
Cubas pro-democracy movement,
one that cannot go unanswered.
President Obamas Cuba policy and
his support for Raul Castros
participation in this Summit have sent
the wrong kind of message to the rest
of the hemisphere that being democratic
and respecting human rights are
negotiable and no longer prerequisites
for participating in this forum. The
President and his administration must
make sure that members of Cubas
real civil society are never again
intimidated and threatened the way they
have been so far.
On Thursday, following the beating by
Cuban regime thugs of several American
citizens and Cuban dissident leaders who
were in Panama City, Panama for the
Summit of the Americas, Marco
issued
the following statement
explaining
how the Summit is going from bad to
worse:
Things at the Summit of the
Americas have gone from bad to worse,
and its clear that the Cuban
regime feels there are no consequences
for continuing their human rights
abuses, even on foreign soil. Cuban
regime thugs beat up several Cuban
dissident leaders and American citizens
visiting Panama for the summit.
Panamanian authorities subsequently
detained this group after being
attacked and at one point reportedly
threatened to deport them, while
letting the Cuban regime attackers walk
free.
Its hard to imagine a
more sickening start to this summit.
Its reflecting poorly on Panama,
reminding us of the true nature of the
Castro regime, and showing just how
nave President Obamas Cuba
policy is. Cuba has done nothing to
earn the legitimacy President Obama
continues to bestow on the regime. It
is a grave mistake to de-list Cuba from
the state sponsors of terrorism list,
one that will further embolden the
regime to step up their actions against
Americas interests.
The State Department should
insist that Panama guarantee the free
and safe participation in the summit of
the group that was attacked yesterday,
along with all other democracy
advocates from all over the hemisphere.
The U.S. government should also ask the
Panamanian government what it is doing
to bring to justice the Castro regime
thugs that attacked the group of Cubans
and Americans.
President Obama should
strongly condemn these actions on both
the Cuban regimes and Panamanian
authorities part, and he should
make meeting with this group and
supporting them his priority while
hes in Panama instead of further
legitimizing the Cuban regime by
insisting on meeting with Raul
Castro.
With all the important
priorities we have in Latin America,
President Obama and all the governments
of the region have themselves to blame
for allowing Cuba to participate in
this Summit and run amok.

Rubio, Boxer, Ayotte, Shaheen Urge
China To Release Detained Political
Prisoners
Marco, along with Senators Barbara
Boxer (D-CA), Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) and
Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH)
called
on China
to release all political
prisoners detained for the peaceful
exercise of their fundamental rights.
In a
letter
to Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai ,
the senators highlighted the cases of
five womens rights activists who
were detained March 6 and 7 on charges of
creating a disturbance by planning to
raise public awareness about sexual
harassment in conjunction with
International Womens Day on March
8, and urged their immediate and
unconditional release. The senators also
urged the release of 2010 Noble Peace
Prize recipient Liu Xiaobo and human
rights attorneys Pu Zhiqiang and Xu
Zhiyong.
According to the Constitution
of the Peoples Republic of
China, citizens enjoy freedom of
speech, of the press, of assembly, of
association, of procession and of
demonstration and the state
respects and preserves human
rights,
the senators wrote . The
ongoing detention of these female
activists who have championed gender
equality and womens rights calls
into question Chinas commitment
to these principles.
Therefore, we respectfully
request that the Chinese government
immediately and unconditionally release
these five female activists and that
while in detention, authorities take
all measures to guarantee their welfare
and security, including access to
adequate medical treatment and regular
and unrestricted access to their
lawyers, family, and
friends,
the senators added .
