Remarks as prepared:
Mr./ Madam President, I would first like
to thank Senators Gillibrand, McCaskill,
Ayotte and Fisher for all of their hard
work on this issue.
As someone who strongly believes in
bipartisanship, I am glad to see the Senate
moving forward today on debating and voting
on this issue.
While we all may not agree on how to
best solve this issue, we can all agree
that it is too important not to debate and
ultimately vote on ways to address
it.
Mr./Madam President, our military is the
greatest fighting force the world has ever
known. The freedoms we enjoy as
Americans are because men and women
continue to volunteer to serve and protect
our nation.
The vast majority of these men and women
serve with honor and integrity.
However, there are a few bad actors in our
military who commit crimes against their
fellow service members.
The question the Senate faces is whether
or not the militarys justice system
is equipped to properly handle sexual
assault within the ranks.
After careful consideration and weighing
all the facts, I feel the military today is
not equipped, and that is why I support
Senator Gillibrands approach.
Like everyone in this chamber, I am
disappointed we ever got to this
point. No soldier should have their
service degraded due to dishonorable
conduct in the ranks.
But there has been ample opportunity for
the military to address this issue within
its ranks, and too much time has passed
without this problem being resolved.
It is Congresss responsibility
now to step in to protect the best America
has to offer.
Congress needs to address what is
currently lacking for victims.
Victims need to feel confident in
reporting crimes of sexual assault, must be
protected from retaliation, and must be
confident that justice will be
served.
Senator Gillibrands legislation
will accomplish these goals.
If the Senate passes this bill today,
loopholes in the military structure will no
longer be an option to protect sexual
assailants. These changes are long
overdue and will hold the military to the
highest standards they strive toward.
I encourage the rest of my colleagues to
join me in supporting her efforts and
keeping our commitment to protect the men
and women who are honorably serving our
nation.
