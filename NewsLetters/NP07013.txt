Our
Commonsense Plan for a Stronger Economy
and a Brighter Future
Dear Friend,
NBC News and the Wall Street Journal
recently revealed
the
results of a nation-wide poll , which
found that more than 70 percent of
Americans believe we as a nation are headed
in the wrong direction. With the
unemployment rate in many Fifth District
localities remaining above the national
average and a national debt exceeding $17
trillion, this comes as no surprise. More
than ever before, Americans need
solutions.
Creating jobs, boosting our economy, and
providing a foundation for a brighter
tomorrow: these are the simple facets of
House Republicans plan for expanding
opportunity for all Americans. We in the
House have passed over 40 bills to create
an economic environment that will lead to
more jobs and better opportunities for
Americans; however, our colleagues in the
Senate have failed to follow through and
take up our job creating legislation.
We must, first and foremost, eliminate
unnecessary and burdensome bureaucratic red
tape that is hindering growth by American
small businesses, which are the backbone of
our economy. We must also make meaningful
reforms to Washingtons current
out-of-control spending culture that is
stifling job creation across the
nation.
One House-passed solution to the current
roadblocks to job creation is a bill that I
introduced,
the
Small Business Capital Access and Job
Preservation Act . This bill
passed
the House with bipartisan support
because of its commonsense approach to
reducing unnecessary regulations that
inhibit investments in small businesses. By
reducing over-regulation, this bill will
promote greater access to capital for small
businesses, encouraging the creation of new
jobs and economic stimulation across the
country. However, it remains stuck in the
Senate.
We in the House have also advanced the
most significant spending reductions in
recent history and passed measures that
would cut taxes for American families and
small businesses. We have put forth job
training reforms that would help unemployed
Americans gain the skills they need to
acquire the jobs they want and we have
adopted agriculture policies that support
our family farms. We have passed
legislation to repeal the presidents
health care law and replace it with real
market-based healthcare reform.
It is time for the Senate to join the
House in our efforts to spur economic
growth and lay the groundwork for a
brighter future for our children and
grandchildren. It is my hope that our
House-passed bills will garner the
Senates support in the very near
future so we can begin to create the jobs
Americans need and get America back to
work.
