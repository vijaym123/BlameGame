News from Representative Randy Neugebauer
January 6, 2013
Happy New Year!
Congress has a busy agenda for 2014.
First up is the Farm Bill, a bill
to fund the government, and legislation to protect your information
under Obamacare.
Farm Bill
We're continuing the negotiations to reconcile the House and Senate
versions of the Farm Bill.
The 2008 Farm Bill expired in September of
2012, and our one-year extension of that bill expired this past
September.
So we're on borrowed time.
The good news is that we're
getting close to a deal.
I'm hopeful that the Farm Bill Conference Committee can get together to
vote on a final bill sometime in the next two weeks.
What will be in
it?
While many of the details aren't yet final, we know that the next
Farm Bill will move away from direct payments, which are sent out
regardless of how much farmers are producing. Instead, this bill will
be much more tuned to the free market by strengthening crop insurance
which lets farmers pay premiums for coverage which only pays out if
they suffer a loss.
We're also making progress on nutrition
assistance.
My goal for the final bill is to close loopholes and
reduce program abuse that wastes taxpayer dollars.
We want to be sure
that nutrition assistance is going to families in need, and that we're
empowering them to play an active role in the workforce and their
communities.
Funding the Government
Congress is also working on legislation to fund the government.
The
current funding expires on January 15, so we
have a relatively short
timeline. The budget deal
that passed in December set the
numbers for this spending bill-the legislation we're working on now
determines how that money is allocated among federal agencies.
Normally, funding decisions are made through appropriations bills.
We
consider them one at a time for each major issue area-for example,
defense, transportation, or energy.
When we consider all of our
spending at once like this, we call it an omnibus bill.
The budget
deal allows for over $1 trillion in spending for this omnibus.
As you can imagine, this will be a huge bill-distributing $1 trillion
among every single federal agency will be complicated.
That's one of
the reasons
I have been advocating so strongly for a return to passing
funding bills one by one - it's not that I support the process for the
process's sake, it's that considering each issue separately allows us
to make better decisions about how we're using taxpayer dollars.
As
Members of Congress, we have a responsibility to do right by taxpayers,
and regular order helps us do that.
As you know, I
didn't support
the budget deal
when it passed, and although I haven't seen the omnibus bill yet, I
have some concerns about it.
I'll keep you posted as more details
become available.
Action Item: Protecting Your Identity Under Obamacare
In my role on the Science Committee, I've been actively working
to determine whether Americans' can trust that their data is
secure on healthcare.gov.
Unfortunately,
security
concerns are another major "glitch" in Obamacare.
This week, the House
will take up two bills that protect your identity and promote greater
transparency and accountability from Obamacare.
H.R. 3362, the
Exchange Information Disclosure Act,
requires the
Administration to provide weekly reports on problems with
healthcare.gov and efforts being made to address them.
And the Health
Exchange Security and Transparency Act
requires Health and Human Services to quickly notify
individuals of any breach on the health care law exchanges that
endangers personal information.
I'm co-sponsoring this bill in the
hopes that we'll be able to better protect people from this flawed law.

News
from
Representative
Randy
Neugebauer January
6,
2013
Happy
New
Year!
Congress
has
a
busy
agenda
for
2014.
First
up
is
the
Farm
Bill,
a
bill
to
fund
the
government,
and
legislation
to
protect
your
information
under
Obamacare.
Farm
Bill
We&#8217;re
continuing
the
negotiations
to
reconcile
the
House
and
Senate
versions
of
the
Farm
Bill.
The
2008
Farm
Bill
expired
in
September
of
2012,
and
our
one-year
extension
of
that
bill
expired
this
past
September.
So
we&#8217;re
on
borrowed
time.
The
good
news
is
that
we&#8217;re
getting
close
to
a
deal.
I&#8217;m
hopeful
that
the
Farm
Bill
Conference
Committee
can
get
together
to
vote
on
a
final
bill
sometime
in
the
next
two
weeks.
What
will
be
in
it?
While
many
of
the
details
aren&#8217;t
yet
final,
we
know
that
the
next
Farm
Bill
will
move
away
from
direct
payments,
which
are
sent
out
regardless
of
how
much
farmers
are
producing.
Instead,
this
bill
will
be
much
more
tuned
to
the
free
market
by
strengthening
crop
insurance
which
lets
farmers
pay
premiums
for
coverage
which
only
pays
out
if
they
suffer
a
loss.
We&#8217;re
also
making
progress
on
nutrition
assistance.
My
goal
for
the
final
bill
is
to
close
loopholes
and
reduce
program
abuse
that
wastes
taxpayer
dollars.
We
want
to
be
sure
that
nutrition
assistance
is
going
to
families
in
need,
and
that
we&#8217;re
empowering
them
to
play
an
active
role
in
the
workforce
and
their
communities.
Funding
the
Government
Congress
is
also
working
on
legislation
to
fund
the
government.
The
current
funding
expires
on
January
15,
so
we
have
a
relatively
short
timeline.
The
budget
deal
that
passed
in
December
set
the
numbers
for
this
spending
bill&#8212;the
legislation
we&#8217;re
working
on
now
determines
how
that
money
is
allocated
among
federal
agencies.
Normally,
funding
decisions
are
made
through
appropriations
bills.
We
consider
them
one
at
a
time
for
each
major
issue
area&#8212;for
example,
defense,
transportation,
or
energy.
When
we
consider
all
of
our
spending
at
once
like
this,
we
call
it
an
omnibus
bill.
The
budget
deal
allows
for
over
$1
trillion
in
spending
for
this
omnibus.
As
you
can
imagine,
this
will
be
a
huge
bill&#8212; distributing
$1
trillion
among
every
single
federal
agency
will
be
complicated.
That&#8217;s
one
of
the
reasons
I
have
been
advocating
so
strongly
for
a
return
to
passing
funding
bills
one
by
one
&#8212;
it&#8217;s
not
that
I
support
the
process
for
the
process&#8217;s
sake,
it&#8217;s
that
considering
each
issue
separately
allows
us
to
make
better
decisions
about
how
we&#8217;re
using
taxpayer
dollars.
As
Members
of
Congress,
we
have
a
responsibility
to
do
right
by
taxpayers,
and
regular
order
helps
us
do
that.
As
you
know,
I
didn&#8217;t
support
the
budget
deal
when
it
passed,
and
although
I
haven&#8217;t
seen
the
omnibus
bill
yet,
I
have
some
concerns
about
it.
I&#8217;ll
keep
you
posted
as
more
details
become
available.
Action
Item:
Protecting
Your
Identity
Under
Obamacare
In
my
role
on
the
Science
Committee,
I&#8217;ve
been
actively
working
to
determine
whether
Americans&#8217;
can
trust
that
their
data
is
secure
on
healthcare.gov.
Unfortunately,
security
concerns
are
another
major
&#8220;glitch&#8221;
in
Obamacare.
This
week,
the
House
will
take
up
two
bills
that
protect
your
identity
and
promote
greater
transparency
and
accountability
from
Obamacare.
H.R.
3362,
the
Exchange
Information
Disclosure
Act,
requires
the
Administration
to
provide
weekly
reports
on
problems
with
healthcare.gov
and
efforts
being
made
to
address
them.
And
the
Health
Exchange
Security
and
Transparency
Act
requires
Health
and
Human
Services
to
quickly
notify
individuals
of
any
breach
on
the
health
care
law
exchanges
that
endangers
personal
information.
I&#8217;m
co-sponsoring
this
bill
in
the
hopes
that
we&#8217;ll
be
able
to
better
protect
people
from
this
flawed
law.
