Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
For the past three years, I had the opportunity to roll back my salary to 2008 levels and take a personal check over to the U.S. Treasury to help pay down the debt.
Individuals, families and businesses across Central Florida have tightened their belt in the last few years and learned to do more with less. If were ever going to get serious about reducing our debt, it will take more than talk, it will take action. Although this alone wont solve our nations fiscal woes, it is a small example of how the federal government can reduce its habitual excessive spending.

This year, the Wings of Freedom Tour celebrated 25 years of service to World War II veterans. Dedicated to education and honoring those who served in WWII, the Wings of Freedom Tour began in 1989 and has made nearly 3,000 stops around the country with their fully restored authentic WWII aircraft.
It was my pleasure to commend the Wings of Freedom Tour by recognizing them in the Congressional Record and welcoming them to the Leesburg airport.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Last year, a constituent from Winter Haven contacted my office regarding an immigrant visa petition she filed on behalf of her son.
Once a visa number became available and the visa was approved, the constituent realized that there was a misspelling on his last name.
Our office went back and forth with the constituent and Embassy and were finally informed that the issue had been resolved in time for her son to arrive in the United States for the holiday season.

Legislative Update:
This week, I supported the Exchange Information Disclosure Act in order to bring more transparency to the Obamacare website and ongoing implementation. This legislation, which passed the House, requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to submit weekly reports describing the enrollment and consumer interaction on the Obamacare website. Government accountability is critically important, and this bill ensures transparency and responsibility to those overseeing enrollment through the Obamacare website.
