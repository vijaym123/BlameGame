Join Congressman Joe Garcia Tonight at 5:30 PM for a Live Discussion on Flood Insurance Reform
Dear Friend,
Tonight, February 18th at 5:30 pm, please join me as I host a
live
Telephone Town Hall to discuss flood insurance rate increases and the impacts they have had on homeowners like you. It is unacceptable that people in my district are seeing rate increases from $2,000 to $49,000 on a home worth $180,000. This is a crisis I have been working hard to address.
During the call, I will be providing updates on legislation introduced in Washington, D.C. and agency initiatives aimed at finding a solution to these skyrocketing and unaffordable flood insurance premiums. I want to hear your concerns and will be answering your questions.

Sincerely,
Joe Garcia, U.S. House Representative (FL-26)
