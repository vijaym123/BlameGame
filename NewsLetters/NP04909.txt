Friend -- Both the President and the First Lady just emailed you.
They wouldn&rsquo;t both email if this wasn&#39;t absolutely critical.
I need Democrats in the East, West, South, and Midwest -- EVERYWHERE -- to READ THIS:
Twelve Senate races -- including Mitch McConnell&rsquo;s Kentucky -- are within five points. TWELVE!
The Republicans need to win just six to take over.
It&rsquo;s terrifying that our odds of winning the entire Senate are just 50-50.
We&rsquo;re ready to launch a massive Final Weekend Get Out The Vote Operation to get Democrats to the polls and WIN.
But we badly need your help to fund it before the final end-of-month deadline in just 72 hours, or Mitch McConnell and the Republicans could win.
Will you pitch in to fund our Final Weekend Get Out The Vote Operation? Remember: Gifts will be TRIPLE-MATCHED.
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
Take a second to really think about this:
After leading 141 filibusters and spending 30 years creating gridlock in Washington, Mitch McConnell could be gone in exactly one week.
That would mean no more McConnell-led filibusters. That means no more McConnell-led shutdowns. Never again.
But to do that -- and stop a McConnell-led Senate takeover -- I NEED your help before the final end-of-month deadline in 72 hours.
Will you pitch in to help us go on offense, get every Democrat to the polls, and win the Senate?
We&rsquo;re counting on you.
Thanks for your help,
Harry Reid
Senate Majority Leader
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
