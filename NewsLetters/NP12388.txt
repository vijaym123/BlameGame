Dear Friends,
With the Winter Olympics underway in Sochi I am proud of how our
athletes have performed, winning twelve medals so far.
Our men and
women have performed with class and sportsmanship that exemplifies the
American spirit.
Security concerns still remain however, and I spoke
about this on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace last Sunday.

Legislative Update
This week Congress voted to raise the debt ceiling until March of 2015.
I voted against giving the Obama administration another blank check.
We are a nation $17 trillion in debt but this week we raised our credit
limit without any additional measures to substantially limit our
spending.
Significant spending cuts will only be accomplished through
reforms to our unsustainable entitlement programs.
Families across my
district and America recognize that going deeper into debt is no way to
handle their finances.
Apparently that lesson is lost on Congress and
this administration when it comes to its ongoing spending addiction.
On Monday the president announced he was once again taking unilateral
action and delaying the employer mandate portion of ObamaCare for
another year
.
Once again this
president has sidestepped the legislative branch of government and
taken the law into his own hands, picking and choosing who will suffer
the consequences of his healthcare law. Instead of a political maneuver
to ease the pain of those who work for small businesses until after the
midterm elections, the president should recognize the failures of
ObamaCare and permanently delay the law for all Americans.
With Best Regards,
Michael T. McCaul
