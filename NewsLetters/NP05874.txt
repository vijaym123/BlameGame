TELL REPUBLICANS TO STOP MAKING IT HARDER TO VOTE
In a democracy like America, it is unacceptable to trample on civil rights. That is exactly what Republicans are doing. Sign your name and tell Republicans to protect the right to vote:
Sign Your Name &gt;&gt;
The United States was founded to be a democracy &ldquo;of the people, for the people, by the people.&rdquo; However, there has been an effort by Republican governors and legislators across the country to disenfranchise voters.
They have been trying to make it harder for young people, the elderly, and minorities to vote, and it undermines the fundamental American principle of democracy.
As Democrats, we believe that voting should be easily accessible to everyone.
David, join me in telling Republicans that all Americans have the right to vote. http://our-right-to-vote.com/dccc
Thanks,
