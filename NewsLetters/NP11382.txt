Friend,
Later this month, Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan is expected to unveil his latest budget proposal.
We already know that it will be full of the same irresponsible policies as his last budget. His plan will gut Medicare. It will unfairly burden middle class families in the name of protecting tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. It will cut vital education programs that everyone from pre-schoolers to college students count on.
We can&#39;t let this happen. We need to make clear to Paul Ryan and his Tea Party friends that this irresponsible budget does not represent the will of the American people. That&#39;s why we&#39;re standing ONE MILLION STRONG against the Ryan Budget.
Can you sign here to add your name and help us reach one million strong against Paul Ryan&#39;s reckless agenda?
We need to address our debt and deficit, but we need to do it in a way that doesn&#39;t slow our economic recovery or hurt our middle class or our seniors. As a medical doctor, I can say with certainty that cuts to Medicare would hurt senior citizens. We need to keep the promises we&#39;ve made to our seniors, not play politics with their healthcare. We need to help our middle class thrive, not balance the budget on their backs. We need to invest in our children and our students for the sake of America&#39;s future, not leave them behind in order to cut costs. This budget cannot stand.
Join with us today - sign here and help us reach 1 million strong against the Ryan Budget.
Thanks for making your voice heard.
Be well,
