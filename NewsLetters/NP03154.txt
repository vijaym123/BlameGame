Rep. Lipinski Opposes Giving Up
Congressional Authority and Allowing President to Fast-Track International
Trade
Agreements
Statement from Congressman Dan Lipinski
(IL-3):
"In his State of the Union
Address, President Obama requested that Congress grant him Trade
Promotion Authority - also known as fast-track authority - so that Congress
would only be allowed an up-or-down vote on any trade agreement with
no amendments.
Unfortunately, I believe Republicans seem ready,
if not eager, to give the President this authority.
But Congress
has already ceded too much power to the executive and judicial
branches, and Americans deserve more transparency and an opportunity for
input, not less.
It would be especially problematic for the
American people - especially the middle class - if Congress gave up its
authority when it comes to trade agreements, considering how harmful many
of these deals have been to American workers over the past 20
years.
"Since NAFTA was signed, Illinois alone has
lost 293,000 manufacturing jobs. [1]
These were quality jobs with high
wages and good benefits that supported middle class families.
Since
that time, weve seen Democratic and Republican presidents continue
to negotiate trade agreements with policies that have led to a soaring
trade deficit, stagnant wages, and continued
outsourcing.
"President Obama lobbied Congress to pass the Korea-U.S. Free
Trade Agreement a few years ago.
We were promised 70,000 new
jobs and soaring exports, but the cold reality is a loss of 60,000 in
jobs in the past two years and a 25% increase in the manufactured goods
trade deficit with Korea. [2]
Right now, the
President is negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership with 11 major
Asian countries that comprise 40% of the United States' goods
trade. [3]
The United
States already has a more than $40 billion manufacturing trade deficit with
these countries and past experience with trade deals indicate this
could get much worse, costing more American jobs. [4]
Making matters worse, U.S.
manufacturers, such as automakers and the steel industry, have serious
concerns about currency manipulation by Japan and others, which directly
undercuts American jobs and export opportunities, and theres no assurance
that the Presidents trade negotiators will fight to prevent this
type of economic deceit in the trade pact. [5]
"I've always said that American manufacturers are the best and
most innovative globally, but they can't compete if we keep ramming
through free trade agreements with countries that aren't being held to a
high standard and a level playing field.
The passage of my
bipartisan manufacturing strategy legislation last Congress was an important
step forward for reinvigorating this sector, but even the passage of
legislation like that doesnt change the reality that America's
workers and businesses cannot prosper if our trade policies force them to
compete with one hand tied behind their
backs.
"That's why I believe Congress needs to consider any trade agreement
through regular order procedures that include real debate and the ability to
offer amendments, not just one up or down vote on an agreement that
was negotiated without transparency.
Otherwise, we're just
passing an agreement that repeats the mistakes of the past, putting
Americans out of work, threatening our environment, weakening food standards,
and lowering workers' rights
globally."
