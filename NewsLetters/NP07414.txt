Dear Fellow
Nevadan,
McCarran International Airport has been selected to
participate in a Department of Homeland Security public-private partnership
that will expand services of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)
personnel. McCarran International Airport is one of five airports
chosen for this program in 2014, a promising sign of Nevadas continued
economic recovery.
In May, I wrote to the Secretary of
Homeland Security urging him to consider McCarran International Airport as a
part of this pilot program. McCarran International Airport was listed
as the nations 9th busiest airport in 2013 and it is on pace to serve
more than 40 million passengers this year. But due to CBP staff
shortages, McCarran has experienced delays at its Federal Inspection
Stations that have caused many airlines to divert their operations.
Travelers coming to southern Nevada should not be welcomed by long lines and
delays at customs. They should be processed quickly and safely so they
can enjoy Las Vegas hotels, restaurants, entertainment and outdoors.
With the expansion of CBP services and personnel, McCarran will be
better equipped to accommodate international flights and
passengers.
Nevadas economy depends on tourism, and while our economy is
improving, we are not in the clear yet. Programs like this will help
grow and support one of our states primary industries. In 2010, I
advocated for the Travel Promotion Act to increase international travel
to the United States and worked to secure funds that allowed McCarran
to continue building a new control tower, which will be completed in
2015. I will continue to support programs such as these to ensure
that our state is well-positioned to capitalize on its great economic
potential.
