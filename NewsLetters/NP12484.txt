House Passes Bills to Cut
Red Tape
On Wednesday, the House passed
H.R. 3590, the
Sportsmens Heritage and Recreational Enhancement
Act . H.R. 3590 is a bipartisan package of eight individual bills that
protect the traditional right of American sportsmen to fish and hunt.
It removes government roadblocks to these activities on certain
public lands and guards against new regulations. By supporting recreational
opportunities on these federal lands, the bill protects American jobs
and economic growth.
As a member of the Congressional
Sportsmen's Caucus, I was pleased to join with my House colleagues to
pass this legislation. In Western North Carolina and across the country,
these outdoor sports enjoyed by so many men and women should be
protected and encouraged.
H.R. 2954, the
Public Access and
Lands Improvement Act , passed the House on Thursday with my
support. H.R. 2954 is a bipartisan package of ten bills to protect and
promote public access to lands; improve opportunities by removing red
tape that stands in the way of responsible, local economic development
and jobs; and encourage transparent, community-centered land
management.
House Republicans agree we need a year of action, which
is why our focus remains on creating jobs and growing the economy to
improve the lives of hardworking Americans and their
families.
In the
News
Last week, I spoke with Greta Van Susteren "On the Record" about
President Obama's pledge to bypass Congress in order to accomplish his
agenda. Despite what he says, the President cannot use his pen to
rewrite our nations laws.

On Thursday, the House Oversight and
Government Reform Committee hosted a hearing on IRS targeting. Though
President Obama claims there was not a "smidgen of corruption"
demonstrated by the IRS, the personal stories we heard in this hearing from
targeted groups suggest a much different picture. We continue to pursue
the truth.
Watch my post-hearing interview on
"America's News Headquarters" for a recap .

Reagan's Wisdom
President Ronald
Reagan would have celebrated his 103rd birthday on Thursday. In his
words:
"Freedom is never more than one generation away from
extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must
be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the
same."
