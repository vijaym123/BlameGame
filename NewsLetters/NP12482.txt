COLLINS RANKED MOST CONSERVATIVE GEORGIAN IN CONGRESS
Northeast Georgias Congressman is #16
Nationally
WASHINGTON
In its
annual rating of Congress released Thursday,
National
Journal
identified Congressman Doug Collins (GA-09) as the most
conservative member of Georgias Congressional Delegation and the sixteenth
most conservative Member of the House of Representatives
overall.
On studying the rankings,
Congressman Collins said,
I tell people all the time that Northeast
Georgia is where youll find the complete conservativethose highly
informed citizens who carefully consider both social and economic
factors when they make their decisions. As the elected representative of
Northeast Georgians, this ranking came as no surprise to
me.
Collins continued,
My district
wants to see conservatism that works.
They want to see their
values expressed in an effective way.
Thats what Ive set
out to do for them, and Im glad one of the most fair and respected
publications in Washington recognized that.
National Journal has been assessing and
ranking Members of Congress on the ideological scale since 1981.
The nonpartisan ranking system took into consideration the 641 House
votes taken in the first session of the
113 th
Congress.
