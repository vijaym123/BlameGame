Doug Ose adds another $700K in tight House race
Look, we didn&rsquo;t see this coming.
We just learned that Doug Ose is loaning himself another $7OO,OOO.
It&rsquo;s clear he&rsquo;ll spend anything to buy this election. And with only 10 days left, his plan might just work.
Folks, we can&rsquo;t let that happen.
We don&rsquo;t need to match Ose dollar-for-dollar, but we can&rsquo;t let his personal fortune blow us out of the water.
Can you rush $5 or more to our Rapid Response Fund and help us fight back for Ami? Every dollar helps.
