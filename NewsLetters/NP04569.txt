Friends,
As of 11:00 am this morning, the Registrar of Voters still has tens of thousands of votes to count in Sacramento County.
And, as of
Monday , we are only 530 votes down.
Ose&#39;s lead is shrinking fast - and in a race this close, a race that could come down to a few hundred votes, we must make sure that
EVERY LEGAL VOTE
is counted fairly.
We have a team on the ground to ensure a fair process, and we need to keep them there for as long as it takes. To do that, we need your help. Click below right now and help support our efforts.

Best,
Team Bera
