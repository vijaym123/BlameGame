Doug
Lamborn and Colleagues Call For Removal of Agendas
From Dietary Guidelines
4/1/15
Congressman Doug Lamborn
has joined his Congressional colleagues in expressing his sincere
disappointment with the recent actions of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory
Committee (DGAC).
"Rather than sticking to the science and preparing recommendations
designed to educate the American people on the variety of foods available in
our nation, the DGAC has instead decided to take an ill-advised foray
into a kind of social engineering. The American people must have the
freedom to make their own dietary decisions. We do not need the heavy
hand of government attempting to centrally plan the types of food we
can or cannot eat. This report is so far off base that it even
contradicts years of scientific research on the health benefits of lean beef. I
join my colleagues in strongly urging the Agriculture and Health and
Human Services Departments to revisit this DGAC
report."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
(CO-05)
