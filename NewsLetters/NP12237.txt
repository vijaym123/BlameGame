Rubio Proposes Ideas For Higher
Education Reform At Miami-Dade
College
On Monday, Marco delivered a speech at
Miami-Dade College proposing new ideas to
make higher education more affordable and
equip students and adults with the skills
needed for 21
st
century jobs. Marco
addressed the challenges of paying for
college while outlining alternatives to
the traditional college approach that
could reduce student loan burdens and
help students pursue higher education in
new ways.
Rubio: [Higher education
reform] is a national priority of the
highest order, and one that we have to
confront. Because if we fail to
confront it, what we will slowly, but
surely, become is a stratified economy,
divided between haves and have-nots
between those who have higher
education and those who do not have
higher education.
Watch the full speech

Marco discussed higher education
reform on
Squawk
Box with CNBCs Joe
Kernen , on
FOX
News Americas
Newsroom,
and with
Bill
Bennett.
He also delivered remarks to a
community
college summit
and wrote an
op-ed
with Senator Wyden.
Marcos proposals received
positive feedback from a variety of
experts:
George Leef:
Most politicians are happy to
go into the cheerleading mode whenever
the subject is education.
One
politician who is not just a cheerleader
is Floridas Senator Marco
Rubio. (George Leef,
Senator Rubio Advances Reform
Ideas About Higher Ed,
NRO ,

Richard Vedder:
Rubio hits a home run with his
third new proposal. He wants to create a
framework where investors can buy equity
in students as opposed to lending to
them. In effect, students sell stock
instead of bonds in themselves.
Under these Income Share Agreements
(ISAs), a student agrees to pay the
investor a certain percent of his or her
income for a fixed number of years -say
five percent for 10 years in return for a
$15,000 investment in college
costs. If the student ends up
making $125,000 a year well before 10
years are up, the investor makes a huge
profit; if the student makes only $30,000
a year, the investor likely loses on the
student. The risks of borrowing move to
the investor away from the
student. (Richard Vedder,
Four Ideas for Higher
Education,
Minding
The Campus , 2/11/14)
AEIs James Pethokoukis:
New reforms proposed by GOP
senators Mike Lee and Marco Rubio attempt
to deal with the college cartel and the
related issue of how to make higher-ed
more market-like. What their ideas have
in common are a variety of market-based
approaches to improving educational
opportunity. Among them: (a) give
students better info on outcomes and
costs; (b) lower barriers to entry by
creating alternative, state-level
accreditation systems so new providers of
cheaper courses and programs could
compete against existing players; (c)
leverage private capital to finance
individual students through income-share
agreements.
(James
Pethokoukis, Lee and Rubio
understand the need to disrupt the
higher-ed status quo,

Rubio: World Must Wake Up To
Whats Happening Now In
Venezuela
Marco, a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, issued the following
statement condemning the ongoing wave of
repression by the government in
Venezuela:
The world must wake up to
whats happening in Venezuela as
the governments unprecedented
wave of repression is beating, jailing
and even killing innocent Venezuelans,
particularly its young people.
Courageous Venezuelans who want nothing
more than a better future dictated by
true democratic order deserve the
American peoples solidarity.
President Obama should
condemn all violent reprisals by
government-affiliated groups against
peaceful student marches. The President
and his administration should
vigorously enforce all existing U.S.
laws to identify and sanction
individuals engaging in these human
rights violations. And I urge the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee to
swiftly approve the Global Human Rights
Act pending before it, as a means of
countering threats against individual
freedoms in places like Venezuela.
Nicols Maduro and his
thugs should know that the world is
watching, and that they will be held
accountable for their cruelty and
violations of human rights. The people
of Venezuela have suffered long enough
and, as they continue taking to the
streets in peaceful protest, I stand
with them and against the Venezuelan
governments brutal and lethal
tactics. Our condolences go out to the
families who have lost their loved ones
during this unsettling time.
Marco also condemned Venezuelan
President Nicols Maduro and his
regime in a
series
of tweets .
Rubio Introduces Legislation To
Bring Greater Accountability To
Veterans Affairs
On Tuesday, Marco introduced the
VA Management Accountability Act of
2014 , a bill that would give Veterans
Affairs (VA) Secretary Eric Shinseki and
future VA secretaries complete authority
to fire or demote VA Senior Executive
Service (SES) or equivalent employees
based on performance. The bill was
introduced in the House by House
Committee on Veterans Affairs
Chairman Jeff Miller (R-FL).
Rubio:
Widespread lack of
accountability and a mounting disability
benefits backlog has left many of our
veterans without proper care, even
resulting in the tragic and preventable
deaths of at least 31 veterans. The least
we can do in return for our
veterans courageous service and
sacrifice is ensure that they receive the
quality care and treatment they deserve.
This bill equips VA leaders with the
tools needed to address and correct the
problems at hand. Giving the VA secretary
complete authority to manage executives
based on their performance discourages
career employees from evading appropriate
punishments and helps restore the
publics faith in the
organization.
Constituent Casework Corner
Jason is a small business owner in
South Florida who imports fish to the
United States. He contacted Senator
Rubios office because he was
getting conflicting information from
various agencies about licensing
requirements, specifically a waiver he
was advised was necessary to complete the
transactions.A member of the staff
was able to connect him with a
representative of the Commerce Department
who provided the guidance he required.
They specified the waiver was not
required, so Jason was able to finalize
the importation process.
