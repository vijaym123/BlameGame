Dear Friend:
In response to unprecedented Republican obstruction, the Senate recently made an important rules change to ensure that President Obama&rsquo;s judicial and executive nominees can be confirmed with an up-or-down vote.
In our country&rsquo;s history, there have been a total of 168 filibusters against a President&rsquo;s executive and judicial nominations &ndash; and half of them have occurred since President Obama took office fewer than five years ago.
Stopping qualified people from running important agencies and stopping judges from being confirmed is another way to shut down the government, and it&rsquo;s wrong.
I believe that we must end this unprecedented abuse of the filibuster. The rules change is an important step toward breaking through the gridlock in Congress, so we can get the work of the American people done.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
