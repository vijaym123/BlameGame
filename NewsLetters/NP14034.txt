The Webster Wire
Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
On Saturday, I began the week by joining the South Lake Junior Womans Club for their Second Annual Holiday of Hopes Festival in Clermont. It was a pleasure donating an American flag that had flown over the Capitol for their silent auction, and supporting their efforts to benefit homeless and less-fortunate children during the holiday season. I was honored to join the other sponsors, donors, and community members who donated their time, talent, and resources to help make this event so successful.

Over the weekend, I also participated in the Central Florida Railroad Museums 100th Anniversary Celebration. Partnering with the Winter Garden Heritage Foundation, the Museum documents the history and growth of Central Florida transportation and resulting economic expansion. Built in 1913, the Tavares and Gulf Railroad Depot, now designated as the Central Florida Railroad Museum, is home to rich historical information and memorabilia. I was privileged to join the Winter Garden Vice-Mayor, Bob Buchanan, and others as we shared the history of Winter Garden, celebrated our heritage, and enjoyed the legacy that Winter Garden continues to build in West Orange County.

Last Sunday, my family and I participated in Open Door Baptist Churchs 30th anniversary celebration to commemorate their many years of ministry. Open Door has impacted many people through their desire to meet individuals spiritual and physical needs, and it was my pleasure to recognize their dedication to serving the Clermont community.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Over the last few months, my office has been working with a constituent whose application for military service benefits was denied. After we inquired further, it was discovered that the mail had been misdirected, and the VA was unable to confirm the address of our constituent. My office worked with the VA to have the claim re-established and facilitate the requested documents. Just this week, we were happy to call the 80 year old constituent with the good news that her claim was awarded, along with the appropriate retroactive payment.
Thanksgiving Update:
As Americans, we have so much to be thankful for. Sandy and I send our deepest wishes to you and your family for a happy Thanksgiving and enjoyable holiday weekend. As we gather with family and friends, we remember and give thanks for the many blessings that fill our lives. Our country has such a rich heritage and we have the privilege of celebrating our inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Many of our bravest and most dedicated Americans will celebrate Thanksgiving by sacrificing to serve and protect us, so I want to extend a special note of gratitude to the men and women of our Armed Forces. May we all be filled with gratitude this Thanksgiving for the innumerable little gifts and blessings in our lives.
