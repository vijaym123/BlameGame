Reed Charity Bill Passes House
Last week the House passed my
Fighting Hunger Incentive Act
as part of the
America Gives More Act
by a vote of 279-137. I believe this is a victory for those in need. My bill provides incentives for businesses to partner with food banks and charities to provide otherwise wasted food to those that need it most. I am proud to have played a role in a bill that touches and helps people with real immediate needs. I care deeply about our community here in the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes, and this bill will bring much needed relief.
That is why I took to the House floor to advocate for those that face the specter of hunger and to appeal to the heart of my colleagues and the President. Despite our political differences, this bill will truly help those that need it most. With its passage, it is my hope that we will set aside party politics and embrace the golden rule - love your neighbors &ndash; that is at the heart of what it means to be American.
Giving our Small Businesses and Farmers Tax Certainty
Last week, the House passed the
America&acute;s Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2015
to provide much needed tax certainty to Southern Tier and Finger Lakes small businesses and farmers.
Providing tax certainty is only fair to our small businesses and farmers. As the main source of jobs we should ensure every effort to encourage their growth and expansion. We need to take common sense steps to give our job creators more certainty and more control over their own financial situation. Southern Tier and Finger Lakes small businesses and farmers need to know the tax landscape in advance so that they can make investments in equipment and employees. I am proud to support this bill and our local Upstate small businesses and farmers.
*The small business provision outlined in Section 179 of the tax code allows business owners and farmers to immediately deduct the cost of investments and upgrades in property, equipment and software instead of depreciating those costs over time. For tax years 2010 through 2014, the expensing limit for small businesses was $500,000. That expensing limitation expired at the end of last year, drastically dropping the limit for tax years after 2014 to $25,000. Under the House-passed provision, Section 179 of the tax code would become permanent at the 2014 level, giving small business owners greater opportunities to invest in their businesses.*
Upcoming Town Halls
I will be holding five town hall meetings this month. The first meeting will be held on Thursday, February 19 in Owego. The second will be held on Friday, February 20 in Penn Yan. The remaining meetings will take place on Saturday, February 21 in Ellington, Portland, and Clymer.
I am looking forward to meeting with constituents from Tioga, Chautauqua, and Yates Counties, to listen to their thoughts and take their suggestions back to Washington
Based on the feedback I have received from the 150+ town hall meetings I have held so far, it&acute;s clear the real solutions come from moms and dads, small business employees, and our local entrepreneurs - not bureaucrats in Washington. The voices of taxpayers on the ground are the voices we need to be listening to, so we can better care for the places we call home.
I have held over 150 town hall meetings throughout the eleven counties that comprise New York&acute;s 23rd congressional district. Town hall meetings will be held on the following dates:
Thursday, February 19
