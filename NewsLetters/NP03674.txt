11th District
December 31, 2014
Dear Friend,
As we close the
books on another year and the 113th Congress, I wanted to write you a
quick note wishing you and your family a happy holiday
season.
We've accomplished a lot over the past
two years, from combating substance abuse to pushing for comprehensive
immigration reform. Here are some of the accomplishments I am most
proud of:
It has been my privelage to represent the 11th District and I am
looking forward to a productive 114th Congress.
Consider forwarding this email or tell your friends and
family to

Remember I am here to work for you. If you
