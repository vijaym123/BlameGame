Happy Father's Day!
Being a parent is one of the most important jobs there is and I am
especially grateful to my Dad for all he has done for me in my life and
for being such a great Dad! I hope you will take the time today to
pause and thank fathers for all the important work they do and to honor
your father or grandfather.
On this Father's Day, we should be especially grateful to the fathers
who serve our country in uniform and are overseas and away from their
families in order to protect our freedom. Thank you for your sacrifice.
I want to thank all the fathers who lead by example, work hard and
sacrifice for their families. I hope you all have a very Happy Father's
Day.
My best always,
David Cicilline
