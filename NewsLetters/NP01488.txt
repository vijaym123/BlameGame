Dear
Friends,
Since 2008, my office has compiled an Annual
Accomplishments Report outlining initiatives and accomplishments made each
year by my office for the great state of
Oklahoma.
This week, I released the 2014 Annual Accomplishments
Report, which details the ways I fought to protect Oklahoma from
Washington bureaucracy and oppressive regulations and to preserve our values by
passing legislation that improves the livelihood of
Oklahomans.
Successes in this report include passage of the National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, the Water Resources
Reform and Development Act, the American Airlines employee retirement
security legislation (H.R. 2591) and other pieces of legislation that
I worked on during 2014.
However, the greatest
accomplishment and honor of all was ending 2014 by being
elected once again to serve you in Washington.
I hope you will take
a moment to read the report, and that you will find it helpful and
informative:
