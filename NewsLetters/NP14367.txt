Dear
David,
Below you will find the latest newsletter from
my office.
We honor and recognize
the men and women in uniform for their service to our country on this
Veterans Day.
We are grateful to the families and those currently
serving and to all who have served.
Last month,
I wrote an op-ed
featured in our local newspaper
asking for my colleagues in Congress to end political gamesmanship and
do what is best for the people of this nation.
I hope you can
take the time to read it.
Also, on Saturday, November 23,
2013, I will be hosting a Holiday Season Scam Stoppers Town Hall
Meeting in the City of Ontario.
I have invited officials from the
Federal Trade Commission and local law enforcement to provide a community
briefing and answer questions on how consumers can protect themselves
from the most typical scams committed during the holidays.

for more information.
As your
representative, I would like to hear your thoughts on issues facing
the nation.
Please fill out this months latest survey found below
to lend your voice.
It is an honor to represent you in
Congress.
Respectfully,
Gloria Negrete
