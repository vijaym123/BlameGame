UNTIL 5:59PM: All Donations
Triple-Matched President Obama and President Clinton asked for your help.
Now until 5:59PM, we&rsquo;re making an emergency extension of the Triple-Match for today&rsquo;s huge ad buy deadline. Can you help?
Bill Clinton wouldn&rsquo;t have emailed you yesterday if it wasn&rsquo;t critically important:
FIRST:
A Fox News poll showed the race for Congress is a dead heat.
THEN:
This morning, Boehner launched his biggest ad blitz of the election -- $2O,OOO,OOO worth of deceitful, Obama-bashing ads -- to take the lead.
We won&rsquo;t mince words: Boehner&rsquo;s $2O,OOO,OOO smear campaign could cost us the whole election.
David, control of Congress is at stake. We can&rsquo;t do this on our own.
Please chip in before the triple-match deadline at 6pm -- when your donation can make the biggest impact.
