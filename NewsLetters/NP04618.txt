Nate Silver&#39;s final prediction: &ldquo;Democrats could win in a shocker&rdquo;
Friend --
The polls don&rsquo;t close until 1 AM ET in Alaska, and campaigns are telling us they still need funds, so we&rsquo;re going to keep Getting Out The Vote until this election is over!
Remember, SIX races are still a coin flip: KY 44-43 (McConnell&rsquo;s race), NC 43-42, GA 47-47, CO 45-43, IA 47-47, and AK 46-45.
We just need to win three to win the entire Senate!
We&rsquo;re sending funds out to the battlegrounds at 6:30 PM -- will you pitch in before then? All gifts will be triple-matched -- it&rsquo;s your last chance!!!

WE COULD MAKE HISTORY: The
Associated Press
reports, &ldquo;A Grimes victory [over McConnell] would rank among the greatest upsets in modern politics.&rdquo;
Let&rsquo;s beat McConnell and win this thing!!
