Dear
David,
Fixing
our nations broken immigration system should be one of Congress
first priorities. But, instead of passing bipartisan legislation, I
believe congressional Republicans are trying to punish the president for
doing his job and are playing politics with funding for the Department of
Homeland Security.
Because of this, we are days away from
a partial shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security, risking
border security, cyber security, airport security, funding for local
firefighters, and more.
Secretary of the Department of Homeland
Security Jeh Johnson said to Congress that, every governor, mayor,
police chief, county sheriff, emergency manager, and fire chief should
care about this, and hes right.
Its Congress duty to
keep the American people safe: risking a partial shutdown stands in the
way of that goal, and its wrong.
We cant play political
games with our nations security, it's that simple. Thats why Ill
continue to push for a clean, bipartisan funding bill for the Department
of Homeland Security.
