Eastern North Carolina Update with Congressman Walter B. Jones
WASHINGTON, D.C. - As we move into the month of May, I want to provide
you with a brief update on my work for Eastern North Carolina in recent
weeks.
On April 24, I met with officials at Fleet Readiness Center (FRC) East
to be briefed on depot activities
. I
viewed the aircraft, including F-35Bs, that were undergoing maintenance
and met with a wounded service member hired by FRC East as part of
their ongoing initiative to recruit veterans - which I strongly
support.
Working for Service Members and Veterans
*
On April 30, I voted to increase funding for veterans programs
by
$1.5 billion. This money will be used to provide funding for VA medical
services and support efforts to reduce the growing backlog of VA
disability claims and appeals.
*
On May 1, I was honored to receive a letter of commendation
from The Beirut Families, a coalition of surviving victims and family
members of those killed in the 1983 bombing of the United States Marine
Corps barracks in Beirut, Lebanon.
*
This week, I was pleased to learn that as a result of my
efforts
on behalf of New Hanover Regional Medical Center, the
Department of Defense reversed a critical ruling that would have cost
the hospital millions of dollars and potentially caused NHRMC to leave
the Tricare network.
Defending the Constitution and Rule of Law
*
I am fighting against
the House leadership's efforts to grant amnesty to
individuals who have broken our laws and entered the country illegally.
*
I am calling for a House subcommittee to block funding for
Common Core State Standards
in the
upcoming year.
Authority over the education of our young men and women
is reserved by the Constitution for the states, not the federal
government.
*
On April 4, I cosponsored a bill
that would prohibit President Obama from bypassing Congress to transfer
control of vital Internet functions to a body of foreign governments -
including those with authoritarian regimes that have taken active steps
to thwart Internet freedom.
Protecting Eastern North Carolina's Coast
*
I am pleased to announce that the chairman of the House
appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over President Obama's
proposed closure of the Beaufort NOAA lab has pledged support
for my efforts to keep the lab open.
This is a critical
step in ensuring the lab receives the funding it needs.
*
I have called for an additional public hearing
in Dare County on the federal proposal to list the Rufa Red
Knot as a "threatened" species.
Classifying this shorebird as such
could significantly impact the Eastern North Carolina economy.
*
On April 8, I testified before a House subcommittee
in
support of a bill I introduced to correct a decades-old federal mapping
error that has wrongly prohibited a large part of North Topsail Beach
from accessing the National Flood Insurance Program and other disaster
assistance.
*
On April 10, I joined North Carolina's senators in requesting a
meeting
between federal and Dare County officials regarding the county's
proposed shore protection project for the Buxton Village area.
*
In addition, I am asking federal officials to meet
with
Dare County leaders and me regarding maintenance dredging of Oregon
Inlet - a critical piece of the coastal economy that has been
effectively closed to marine traffic after shoaling in to less than
four feet.
Defending Religious Freedom
*
I am petitioning the Air Force
to update its regulations on religious freedom, which run
contrary to the Constitution and current law by placing limits on the
First Amendment rights of airmen in leadership positions and excluding
the protection of free "expression" of religious belief.
*
Last month, I filed an amicus curiae brief
in a case involving the Mt. Soledad Veterans
Memorial, which an appeals court has declared unconstitutional because
it includes a commemorative cross.
The brief urges the Supreme Court
to hear the case and recognize in its ruling that Mt. Soledad's cross
is absolutely consistent with the First Amendment.
*
My dedication to religious freedom and the Judeo-Christian
values upon which our nation was founded is drawing fire
from a leading national atheist organization.
*
In addition, my stand for conservative principles based on my
religious convictions has garnered awards from the American
Conservative Union
and the
Family Research Council
.
Thank you for taking the time to read about some of my work for the 3rd
District.

Eastern

Update

Walter

WASHINGTON,
D.C.
-
As
we
move

the

of
May,
I
want
to
provide
you
with
a

on
my

for

On

leadership's efforts
to
grant

to
individuals
who
have
broken
our
laws
and

country

I am
calling
for
a
House
subcommittee
to
block
funding
for
Common
Core
State
Standards
in
the
upcoming

Authority

to
keep
the

This
is
a
critical

in
ensuring
the

receives
the
funding
it
needs. I
have
called
for
an
additional
public

in
Dare
County
on
the
federal

to
list
the
Rufa

Classifying
this

as

could
significantly
impact
the

economy.
On
April
8,
I
testified
before
a

in
support
of
a

I
introduced
to
correct
a
decades-old
federal

that
has

between
federal
and
Dare
County
officials
regarding
the
county&#8217;s
proposed
shore
protection
project
for
the
Buxton
Village
area.
In
addition,
I
am
asking
federal
officials
to
meet
with
Dare
County
leaders
and
me
regarding
maintenance
dredging
of
Oregon
Inlet
&#8211;
a
critical

that
has
been
effectively
closed

four

Defending
Religious
Freedom I
am
petitioning
the
Air
Force
to
update
its
regulations
on
religious
freedom,
which
run
contrary
to
the
Constitution
and
current
law
by
placing
limits
on
the
First
Amendment
rights
of
airmen
in
leadership
positions
and
excluding
the
protection
of
free
&#8220;expression&#8221;
of
religious
belief.
Last
month,
I
filed
an
amicus

in
a
case
involving
the
Mt.
Soledad
Veterans
Memorial,
which
an
appeals
court
has
declared
unconstitutional
because
it
includes
a
commemorative
cross.
The
brief
urges
the
Supreme
Court
to
hear
the
case
and
recognize
in
its
ruling
that
Mt.
Soledad&#8217;s
cross
is
absolutely
consistent
with
the
First
Amendment.
My
dedication

religious
freedom
and the
Judeo-Christian

upon
