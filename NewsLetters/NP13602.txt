I wanted to let you know that I will be guest hosting The John Fredericks Show tomorrow morning from 6:00 AM to 10:00 AM.
Joining me as guests will be Rep Rob Wittman, Chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee; Tonya Mallory, CEO of Health Diagnostic Laboratory; Senator Tim Kaine; Rep Jeff Miller, Chairman of Veterans' Affairs; and Governor Bob McDonnell. Topics for discussion will range from national defense to addressing gridlock in Washington to the latest innovations in healthcare.
I hope you will tune in on your commute to work or as you go about your morning tomorrow. You can listen live,
here .
Yours in service,
Randy
