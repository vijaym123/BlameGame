Dear
Constituents,
Last week I was proud to advocate for our nation's veterans by
pursuing measures that would reduce the claims backlog at the
Veterans Affairs Administration and provide funding for the Wounded Warrior
program.
The first
is a fiscally responsible bill that would redirect funds toward the
digital scanning of health and benefit files, and reduce the claims
backlog without any new spending. As an emergency medicine doctor, I
understand the importance of efficiency in healthcare and by committing
resources to digitizing health and benefit files, we will further
increase the VAs capacity to tackle the claims backlog, ensuring veterans
receive the benefits they have earned - faster.
This critical measure passed the House
with bipartisan support, and will go on to the Senate as a part of the
legislation that funds military construction and the Department of
Veterans Affairs. Click below to hear

pressing issue facing seniors in Riverside County? Quality of Healthcare Access to Healthcare Retirement Security Attempts to Defraud Seniors Other *By answering this survey, you are subscribing to

The second measure provided additional funding for the Wounded Warrior
fellowship program, which provides paid fellowships for injured
veterans returning home from military service to work in Congressional
offices across the country. My amendment would have done this at no
additional cost to taxpayers by transferring funds from the Government
Printing Office, which provides redundant paper copies of the Congressional
Record and Calendar to Members of
Congress.
There has never been a more important time
for the heroes who have defended our country to play a pivotal role
in shaping our laws.
You can watch the full video below to
learn more about how the Wounded Warrior Program is helping veterans
right here in Riverside County and see why we must put solutions over
ideology, and ensure our veterans have a voice in
Congress.
Sincerely,
Raul Ruiz,
M.D.
