If youre like me, you like to use the beginning of the new year to get organized. In this day and age though
with more accounts, insurance policies, and other documents than ever before
sorting through and organizing health benefits information and paperwork can be both overwhelming and time-consuming.
To help with that, my office put together this
Health Benefits Toolkit
as a guide to managing your health benefits information. Having this information organized and in one place is extremely helpful in emergency situations
and I wanted to be sure you had access to this guide. I hope you find this information helpful. Dont forget, please feel free to contact me at any one of my
Congressional offices , or online at
forbes.house.gov
if my staff and I can assist you or your family in dealing with a federal health issue.
Yours in service,
Randy
