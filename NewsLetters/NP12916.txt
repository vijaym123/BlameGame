Dear Constituent:
I have regularly asked for input from my constituents during one-on-one meetings, round table discussions, and Tele-Town Hall meetings.
In fact, in November, I held my third
Tele-Town Hall meeting where over 4,800 constituents participated in the call and had the opportunity to ask questions live.
Today, I would like your input on a number of issues prior to my inaugural State of the District and Town Hall meeting.
By completing my Constituent E-Survey, it will allow me to know where my constituents stand on important issues facing the 3 rd
Congressional District and our Nation.
It is an honor to serve you and thank for taking the time to complete this survey.
Please click the provided link to access the survey:

There is still time to RSVP to the Town Hall meeting that will take place this Thursday, January 30 th , from 5:30pm to 7:00pm at Columbus State Community College located at 315 Cleveland Ave. Parking will be available directly across Cleveland Ave. from the event building.
Please call 614-220-0003 to RSVP.
Sincerely,
Member of Congress, OH-03
