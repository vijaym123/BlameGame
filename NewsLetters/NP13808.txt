With the launch of Obamacare marred by an ineffective website and
reports that millions of Americans are being booted from
their health care plans, and many forced to buy new, more expensive
plans,
I want to get an update from my constituents about your
experiences with Obamacare. Please share your story below.
Obamacare
Whats your story? Have you attempted to use the government-run website,
healthcare.gov, to sign up for a new health care plan? Yes, and I signed up for a new plan without
problems or delays. Yes, I attempted to use the website but the site either did not work or
the delays were too long. No, I have not attempted to use the site, but I plan to try
later. No, I have not
tried to use the site and I dont plan to try later. Are there any stories
youd like to tell about your experience with the Obamacare
website? Has your insurance coverage been affected by
the implementation of the new health care law? Yes, my insurance policy was cancelled, but I
am pleased with my new plan. Yes, my insurance policy was cancelled, and I wish I could
keep my old plan. No,
my insurance coverage has not been affected. Im not sure yet whether Ill be able to keep
my plan. Have
your health care costs been affected by Obamacare? Yes, my health insurance costs are
going up. Yes, my health
insurance costs are going down. No, my costs are staying the same. I dont know yet what my health insurance
