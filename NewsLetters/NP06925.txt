Last week, I made several visits throughout the district to discuss
rural healthcare issues with constituents and businesses. As we
continue to seek solutions to lower healthcare costs and ensure access
to care for Americans, we must take into account the particular
realities of providing healthcare in rural environments. It is
important that I hear from patients and providers so I can take their
thoughts and experiences back to Washington to better serve as a voice
for the Eighth District.
Rural healthcare providers are vital in small
communities, and I applaud them for the good work they are doing in
South Georgia. Below are a few pictures from some of my visits.
U Save It Pharmacy: A lot of senior citizens have a hard time
traveling, and it is important to ensure that they have access to the
pharmacist that's closest to them and that they want to use.
Hospice of Tift Area: I enjoyed meeting with staff and patients to
discuss the impact of Medicare rate cuts and the difficulties of
serving patients under new restrictive regulations. It was great to
share stories with Mr. Harper (pictured above) about growing up in
Tifton.
Colquitt Regional Hospital: I am happy to see Colquitt Regional succeed
and expand despite a challenging environment for rural healthcare
providers.
Happy Hour Service Center: Happy Hour Service Center in Warner Robins
has been serving developmentally challenged adults in Houston County
since 1956.
Georgia Farm Bureau Commodity Conference:
Last Thursday, I spoke to farmers from across our state at the Georgia
Farm Bureau Commodity Conference and discussed the implementation of
the Farm Bill that Congress passed earlier this year. Out state's
agriculture producers make a significant impact on our nation's
economy, and I am proud to work on their behalf on the House
Agriculture Committee.
Thank You Summer Interns:
Thank you to our Tifton and Warner Robins District Office Summer
Interns! I appreciate your hard work for the Eighth Congressional
District!
Reminder: Coffee with Your Congressman:
I hope you can join me for a cup of coffee this Wednesday August 20,
2014 in Forsyth. I will be hosting another "Coffee with your
Congressman" so that I can hear about issues that concern you most.
Drop-in any time between 9:00am - 10:00am . I hope to see you there!
