Five-Year Farm Bill Passes Congress - Becomes
Law
After months of negotiations, House and Senate
conferees finished discussions and sent a five-year Farm Bill to both
chambers for passage.
President Obama signed the legislation into law
on February 7.
The final version of the bill
was not perfect but made some reforms that will improve current
government programs.
Above all, the bill gives America's farmers
certainty over the next five years to plan and conduct business without
political interference from Washington.
The final Farm Bill
includes some savings by increasing the amount of low-income energy
assistance needed to automatically qualify for other benefit programs from $1
to $20.
The final bill also eliminates direct payments to
farmers, and included important dairy provisions that will help dairy
producers in Wisconsin by allowing the USDA to buy retail dairy products in
order to counter over-supply.
I voted for final passage of the
Farm Bill because it takes many of the right steps to benefit our local
farmers.
Congressional Budget Office: Obamacare will
Reduce Working Hours
On February
4, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
released a report
which estimates that, due to the new
health care law, there will be fewer full-time workers because people
will choose to work fewer hours in order to keep government subsidies
for health insurance.
In the report, CBO estimates that the
equivalent of two to two-and-a-half million jobs worth of hours will be
dropped from the economy.
This is not the
message government policy should be sending.
We already have a
poverty trap where low-income families are discouraged from working harder
or getting a raise because they would be worse off financially, due in
large part to the phase-out of government programs.
This report
shows that the same problem will be felt in middle class families.
Government policies should encourage work which in turn promotes
greater productivity and allows individuals to reach their financial
goals.
We need to eliminate all government-imposed disincentives,
regardless of income level.
Congress Repeals Cuts to Military Pension
COLAs
On February 11, the House
passed legislation repealing the cuts to military pension
cost-of-living-adjustments for current active duty personnel that was included as part
of last year's budget agreement.
The Senate passed the bill the
next day, sending the legislation to President Obama's desk for
signature.
I supported
this bill when it passed the House by a vote of 326 - 90.
I
certainly understand the need to reduce government spending, but we should
keep the promises we made to current active duty military and
retirees.
Congratulations to Service Academy Nomines from
the Sixth District
Each year I make
nominations to the U.S. Service Academies from Wisconsin's Sixth
District based on the recommendations of a Commission of Congressional
Appointments.
The commission personally interviews each
candidate and thoroughly reviews their academic performance, extracurricular
activities, leadership skills, and writing ability.
Final
acceptances are made by the individual academies and candidates must pass
rigorous physical fitness and medical
examinations.
I am pleased to announce this year's recommendations.
These young men and women represent the best and brightest in our area,
and I'm confident they will represent Wisconsin
well.
