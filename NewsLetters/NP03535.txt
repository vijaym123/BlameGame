Dear Friend,
As we enter a new year, we also enter a
new Congress. Im honored to have the
opportunity to return to Washington to
serve you. I look forward to working with
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to
grow our economy and reduce the squeeze on
hardworking Ohioans over the next two
years.
With a Republican-controlled House of
Representatives and Senate, I am confident
that several of the more than 300
House-passed bills that never received a
vote in the Senate will now see the light
of day upon re-introduction. This includes
the Hire More Heroes Act, a bipartisan bill
that passed the House last year by a vote
of 406-1.
Yesterday, the House unanimously passed
the Hire More Heroes Act to make it easier
for small businesses to hire more veterans.
By exempting veterans who are already
enrolled in healthcare plans through the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or the
Department of Defense (DoD) from the
mandates within the Presidents
health care law, businesses will be
incentivized to hire them. Additionally,
providing businesses with this relief may
keep them from cutting back on employees
and reducing employee hours in order to
comply with the burdensome employer mandate
provision outlined in the Presidents
health care law. Its a commonsense
bill that I expect will once again gain
broad bipartisan support.
As it was a priority in the last
Congress, ensuring that we take care of our
servicemen and women will remain a top
priority throughout the 114
th
Congress. This past year, the
House and Senate came together to pass the
Veterans Access to Care through
Choice, Accountability, and Transparency
Act to bring more accountability and
necessary reforms to the VA. We also
approved the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention
for American Veterans (SAV) Act. This
legislation, which passed the House with
bipartisan support, would increase access
to mental health care by creating a
one-stop, interactive website with all of
the information and services offered for
veterans with mental health issues. Lastly,
I was proud that two bills I cosponsored,
the Veterans Advisory Committee on
Education Improvement Act and the
Vulnerable Veterans Housing Reform Act,
were approved by the House. These bills are
central to veterans transition back
to civilian life by providing them access
to affordable housing and the education and
job training that they need and
deserve.
I know that there is much more that
needs to be done to restore our promise to
veterans. When the new Cleveland Veterans
Affairs Regional Office Director was
appointed, I made it a point to visit with
him and the Veteran Service Organizations
that provide claims assistance. Though
there is much work to be done, the Hire
More Heroes Act is an important first step
to helping veterans find work and I am
proud to support it.
Im dedicated to connecting
Ohios veterans with valuable
educational tools and serving as a resource
to them. That is why I hosted a
Veterans Health and Wellness
Resource Fair this past June and a
Veterans Forum the previous year. I
encourage you to visit our website at

veterans. I also encourage you to visit our
