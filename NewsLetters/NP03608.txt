Dear Friend,
Sally and I want to wish all of you a very Merry Christmas.
Christmas reminds us of the hope that came into and remains in the world. Whatever our problems, the fact that God sent his son into our broken world reminds us that enormous good can come from any situation. May we continue to pray for our country and for those who serve it.
Merry Christmas and happy holidays from our family to yours.
