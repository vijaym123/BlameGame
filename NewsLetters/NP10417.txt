Happy Easter! Chag
Sameach!
I hope you and your loved
ones have enjoyed a blessed Holy week. Today, we celebrate the power
and joy of Gods incomprehensible sacrifice-- a day in which light
conquered darkness and goodness conquered sin.
This
Easter has been a unique week of reflection for Wrenzie and me.
Last
August, we had the opportunity to visit Israel with my colleagues in
Congress to learn more about the U.S.-Israel relationship.
During this privately funded trip, we visited Bethlehem (Jesus'
birthplace), Jerusalem (where Jesus made His humble, triumphal entry on Palm
Sunday), and Via Dolorosa (the street Jesus walked carrying His cross on
the way to His crucifixion). Our recent visit made this Easter
celebration exceptional, as Wrenzie and I were able to share with our family
the impact this trip had on our lives.
I would like to share some
pictures from our trip to the Holy Land with you:

Grand Strand Veterans Take Final Flight
to Memorials
My DC staff had the honor last
week of greeting 76 veterans from our district at the World War II
memorial. These heroes were participating in Honor Flight Grand Strands
final flight to Washington. Our nation loses 1000 WWII veterans each
day, and the Honor Flight Network has made it its mission to fly our
veterans to DC to visit their national memorials for free.
We will
never be able to thank our veterans enough for the sacrifices they have
made for our freedoms, but I will fight my hardest to preserve the
freedoms they risked their lives for each day.
God Bless our
Veterans and God Bless America! View more pictures on my Facebook page

Launch of New
Congressional Caucus
Last week, I joined Congressman Brad
Schneider (D-IL), Congressman Steve Stivers (R-OH), and Congressman Jared
Polis (D-CO) in launching the bipartisan Congressional Caucus for
Middle Market Growth.
In our district, there are
approximately 200 middle market companies.
Together, these companies employ
more than 58,000 people.
I strongly believe the
Congressional Caucus for Middle Market Growth will serve as a foundation to
identify ways to collaborate with mid-market
businesses.
Congressman Schneider, one of my Democrat colleagues on the Small
Business Committee, and I will serve as Freshman Co-Chairs and
Congressman Polis and Stivers will serve as Co-Chairman.
Together, we
will strive to grow and improve economic competitiveness in this segment
of our economy and educate our colleagues on the economic impact of
the middle market.
Have a good
week,
