Fighting to Make College Education More Affordable
Senator Stabenow joined Senator Elizabeth Warren to introduce
legislation that would save millions of borrowers money on their student
loans.
Their legislation would offer students with high interest rates
the option to refinance at the lower rates that Congress established
last year, saving hundreds-- even thousands--of dollars a year. "Too
many people in Michigan are saddled with decades of debt just because
they wanted a fair shot to go to college and get ahead," Stabenow said.
"That is why I'm fighting alongside my colleagues to make college more
affordable and to help borrowers who are already weighed down by
exploding and unsustainable levels of student debt. Helping these
borrowers will improve the lives of millions of Americans and boost our
economy by allowing them to spend their money on a home, a car, and the
needs of their families instead of on interest payments," she added. The
legislation is fully funded by enacting the so-called "Buffett Rule"
which would limit special tax breaks that allow millionaires and
billionaires to pay lower effective tax rates than middle-class
families.

Women Senators Urge Action on Kidnapped Nigerian Girls
All 20 women U.S. Senators strongly condemned the abduction and
mistreatment of more than 200 girls by the terrorist group Boko Haram in
Nigeria. The bipartisan group of Senators called on the UN to target
Boko Haram with additional international sanctions. "I am outraged that
these young women have been kidnapped, mistreated, and may be sold into
slavery just because they were trying to get an education and build
better lives for themselves," said Stabenow. "Education is a basic
right, and all people should be able to pursue education without fear of
violence or retribution. We stand united in condemning this horrifying
act, and I urge everyone to speak out to demand that these girls be
freed immediately." The Senate unanimously passed a resolution on
Tuesday condemning the abductions.
