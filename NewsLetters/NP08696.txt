The VA recently released an
audit , which found 57,000 veterans waited longer than three months for an initial visit with a doctor and over the last decade, 64,000 veterans who requested an appointment never received one.
These systemic issues of mismanagement are deeply disturbing and must be remedied. Our veterans deserve better.
The House unanimously passed legislation to provide access to care for our veterans. The Veterans Access to Care Act would require, for two years, the agency to offer non-VA care to any enrolled veteran who can not get an appointment within 14 days or who lives more than 40 miles from a VA medical center.
The bill also bans bonuses for all VA employees for the next two years.
The House and Senate have both passed legislation reforming the VA health system and will now work together to send legislation to the Presidents desk.
On Monday, I had the opportunity to speak at the American Legion post in Greenville and update our veterans on these potential changes to the VA.
I will share with you what I shared with them, which is that while these reforms are appropriate and past due, it is a shame it took the deaths of veterans for these changes to be proposed and passed.
Congress should make reforms and changes before people lose their lives.
