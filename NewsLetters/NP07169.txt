David, I hate to ask you this on a Sunday, but I really need your help. Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s coming to our district TOMORROW to host a massive fundraiser for my opponent, Bobby Schilling.
Every dime he raises will pay for ads propping up Mr. Schilling&rsquo;s campaign -- and attacking me.
So whether you can chip in $5 or $50, I&rsquo;m asking you rush a contribution before the big fundraiser to help us fight back. If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
If we can hit 200 online gifts before tomorrow&rsquo;s big event, it&rsquo;ll make Speaker Boehner think twice the next time he wants to raise money in our district.
Please David, can I count on you? http://action.cheribustos.com/chip-in
Thanks so much,
Cheri
