This week I had the opportunity to speak on the House floor about a shocking use of hard-earned American tax dollars. U.S. taxpayers provided upwards of $440 million in assistance in the current fiscal year to the Palestinian Authority.
In April of 2011, the Palestinian Authority Registry published a government resolution granting all Palestinian prisoners imprisoned in Israel for security and terror-related offenses a monthly salary from the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority defined eligible beneficiaries as anyone imprisoned in Israel's prisons as a result of his participation in the struggle against the occupation. This means that Palestinians convicted of crimes such as theft do not receive a salary, but prisoners serving time for terror-related offenses such as members of Hamas and Fatah receive hefty payments.

In 2011, the Palestinian Authority paid $60 million in salaries to terrorists in prison. Like any salary, payments to prisoners follow a sliding scale based on quality. This rationale means the more heinous the act of terrorism, the greater the salary, the more violent the terrorist act, the longer the Israeli prison sentence - and subsequently, the higher the monthly compensation. This policy incentivizes terrorism.
Its shocking to me that U.S. tax dollars are being spent on Palestinian terrorists salaries. I'll continue to work with my colleagues to end this Palestinian Authority program, even if that means ending all U.S. aid to the Palestinian Authority. This waste of hard-earned American tax dollars simply is unacceptable and I wont stand for it.
Sincerely,
Scott G. Perry
