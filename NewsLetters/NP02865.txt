This Weeks
Month in Review:
This week
in his month in review video Judge talks about his excitement to work
with a dominantly Republican Congress. He discusses the Homeland
Security Appropriations Bill that was passed and stresses the importance
of securing our borders.
Thanks to Congressman Carter's hard work
with county and city officials, a new stretch of Highway 195 in
Florence has been opened. This is a massive project that is expanding
Highway 195 from Fort Hood to I-35 in Georgetown. Pictured above,
Congressman Carter discusses the economic benefits of the new highway at the
grand opening of 195.

America's New
Congress
The New Year brought us the 114 th
Congress
Americas New
Congress.
This is the first time in nine years that Republicans
have had control of both the House and the Senate, allowing Congress
to finally make a difference for a brighter future.
In the short
time the New Congress has been in session we have already been
working on positive solutions that will strengthen local economies - not
Washington's economy.
I promise to represent your strong,
conservative values that prioritize our veterans, economic growth in Central
Texas, small business owners, education and ensuring our border is
secure.
House Passes the DHS Appropriations Bill
My
2015 Homeland Security Appropriations bill (H.R. 240), which was passed
by the House of Representatives on Wednesday, January 17, 2015,
prohibits DHS funding from being used to implement the Presidents executive
order.
I am proud that my colleagues are joining me in fighting
back against this President's policies, which, in my opinion,
continually bypass Congress to further his own agenda.
The safety of our
homeland should be top priority. In a time when we are facing
potential attacks on our homeland by terrorists, there are people who want to
focus on giving amnesty to people here illegally. This bill puts
money where it needs to be: on our border. The FY 15 Homeland Security
bill will fund DHS through the remainder of the year.
The bill was
passed by the House of Representatives by a vote of 236 to 191.
The
Senate must now vote for the bill and send it to the President to sign
in to law.
