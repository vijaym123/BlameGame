Obama Threatens to Veto Keystone
Dear Friends,
This week saw the start of the 114 th
Congress. We have already passed two bills dealing with serious issues in Obamacare and we have also passed a bill to allow construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.
Legislation for this pipeline has already passed the House and it has been approved by the Presidents own State Department and the states through which the pipeline would run.
The now Republican Senate is expected to take up and pass the bi-partisan legislation and send it to the Presidents desk.
And the White House response? A veto threat.
Construction of this pipeline would create jobs, grow our economy, and shore up North Americas global energy leadership.
It is time for President Obama to join us and the American people and get this pipeline moving.
Please
share your thoughts and concerns
with me as we continue working through the new Congress.
Sincerely,
