Healthcare.gov is NOT Secure
Dear Friends,
At a recent hearing of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, my colleagues and I questioned information security experts from the private sector and academia about the security of the Obamacare website Healthcare.gov.
They ALL agreed that the website is not secure and would not be secure by November 30.
The websites systemic security flaws leave our personal information open to hacking, making identity theft through the website a serious risk.
Like you, I also have to go on the Obamacare exchanges but I will wait until I am forced by law to enter my information and take this risk.
As I continue to fight Obamacare and deal with its rollout, please continue to
let me know
your thoughts and concerns. Thank you!
Sincerely,
Join the conversation! Stay connected to me through
,
,
and
I look forward to hearing from you soon!
