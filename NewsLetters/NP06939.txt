Dear Friend,
Tomorrow marks a major milestone in our race --
it&rsquo;s the FEC pre-primary filing deadline.
All eyes will be watching to see how our grassroots network responds. We&rsquo;re trying to raise $25,000 before the deadline, and we&rsquo;re a little short. Can you contribute $5 to help out?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
November will be here in the blink of an eye, and we need to capitalize on every single day between now and then.
To do that, we need to give our team the resources it needs to run an effective statewide campaign -- and we count on the support of people like you to make that happen. Your support will power this campaign to victory. Give $5, $10, or whatever amount makes sense for you and help us keep fighting.
Thank you.
Ed
