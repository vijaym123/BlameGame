Dear Friends,
As many of you may know, I
am passionate about
recycling. In a smaller state
like Delaware, where open
space is limited, its
important that we reduce
waste in landfills, for the
simple reason that we just
dont have enough space
to store trash if we
dont have to. However,
there is more to recycling
than just glass, aluminum and
paper. Each day nearly all of
us use electronics that,
after they break or become
obsolete, end up in
landfills, often times
polluting our environment
with dangerous chemicals.
Thats why I held a
hearing yesterday to learn
about how the government is
recycling its electronics and
what more we can be doing to
cut down on waste. I was
amazed to hear that the
federal government discards
up to 10,000 computers a day!
These are electronics that
have real value, especially
considering that many have
raw materials which can be
re-used or refurbished,
providing jobs and keeping
valuable materials in our
supply chain. When I was
Governor, I created a program
to repurpose outdated state
government computers so
students throughout Delaware
could use them. This was just
one small way we were able to
reduce our footprint and
repurpose a valuable
resource. The federal
government can and should be
a leader in embracing similar
programs to reduce its
E-footprint, particularly
since its the largest
consumer of electronic goods
in the U.S. By leading
by example and leveraging
market forces, the federal
government can help expand
opportunities for e-recycling
for all consumers.
For now, Delaware
residents can bring their
unwanted or old electronics
to any of our states
Electronics Good Recycling
stations, which
can
be found here . If
your school or non-profit
organization wants to get
involved, you can arrange to
have electronics picked up,
cost-free, by calling the
Delaware Solid Waste
Authority at
1-800-404-7080.
As always, I welcome
hearing from all of you on
this topic, or any
other. Please continue
