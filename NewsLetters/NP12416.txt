Judge's Boarding Pass - February 10
14
On Tuesday, February 11, I voted
against
legislation to increase the debt limit
without any spending cuts. I voted against this legislation because
spending by the federal government is out-of-control and I believe we must
begin to balance our budget.
Unfortunately this legislation
passed the House by a vote of 221-201 with the support of only 28
Republicans (See
Roll Call
#61 ).
Additionally on Tuesday, the Ways &amp; Means Committee approved
H.R. 3865,
the
STOP Targeting of Political
Beliefs by the IRS Act , which I am a cosponsor of. This
legislation stops the IRS from implementing rules that continue to unfairly
target conservative groups and basically removes them from the public
square until Congress has completed a proper and full investigation into
the IRS scandal. The Obama Administration has done all it can to sweep
this scandal under the rug, however I will continue to fight to make
sure the truth of this scandal is revealed and the corruption in the
IRS is permanently eliminated.
Wednesday,
February 12, I had the honor of meeting with the U.S. Army Chief of
Staff , Gen. Raymond Odierno . We discussed changes to
the army force structure and the importance of keeping the army and
Fort Hood strong.
I am now headed back to
Texas to work in the district for the next week. Our next session
begins February 25.
