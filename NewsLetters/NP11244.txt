Dear Fellow New Mexican,
Quality and affordable health care coverage is within reach for New Mexicans now more than ever before. Yet many across the state who are eligible for free or low-cost health care coverage don't know they are eligible, or don't know how to sign up. That is why I am committed to helping our community get the facts and get covered.
The following steps can help ensure you and your family get quality health care coverage that fits your budget.
I signed up through the Health Insurance Exchange, and you can too.
Keep in mind that t he deadline to enroll without paying a fine is Monday, March 31, 2014.
Step 1:
Become a health care champion for your family and learn about coverage opportunities under Medicaid or the Health Insurance Exchage.
Find information:

Step 2:
Connect with a live, well-trained enrollment specialist who can help with both Medicaid and Health Insurance Exchange enrollments.
