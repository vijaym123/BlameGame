Congressman Andrews Announces $574M Contract for Lockheed Martin
Moorestown to Advance High-Tech Missile System
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Last week, Congressman Andrews announced that
Lockheed Martin received a $574 million contract with the U.S.
Department of Defense to continue production of a high-tech missile
system. The award will help sustain thousands of jobs at the South
Jersey facility and provide our military with the best weapons
available. Congressman Andrews was a staunch supporter of the funding
which came through the National Defense Authorization Act which was
signed into law last month.
The $574 million contract will allow workers at Lockheed Martin in
Moorestown to continue engineering, modernizing and producing the Aegis
Combat System (ACS), which uses an integrated network of advanced
sensors, computers, and weapons to destroy incoming threats.
Known as
"the Shield of the Fleet," the high-powered radar component performs
search, tracking, and missile guidance functions simultaneously,
protecting the fleet from a variety of threats, including ballistic
missiles.
This contract with the Department of Defense will pay for
Aegis systems for seven Destroyer warships.
"These are South Jersey jobs that will produce the tools to help
protect our nation, our troops, and our allies against missile attacks,"
said Congressman Andrews.
"I'm very proud of the men and women of New
Jersey's defense industry for their leadership role in producing the
system."
As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Andrews remains
committed to supporting our troops by giving them the best tools in the
field to get the job done and secure the safety of our nation.
