Dear Friend,
Since the health care website's rollout, I have received numerous phone
calls, emails and letters from constituents who are concerned about
ObamaCare's impact on their personal health care and our nation's
health care system. As an ObamaCare enrollee myself, I share your
concerns, especially after seeing the ongoing problems with the
website.
Even though some of the website's bugs have now been resolved, there
are still lingering problems with the website and the overall
implementation of the health care law. Many people signing up for
health insurance on the federal government's website are being told
they have completed the process and have health insurance, but are
later finding out their information was never transmitted to the actual
insurance companies, or the forms the insurance company received were
incorrect or incomplete. Without correct and complete information from
the federal government website, insurance companies cannot provide the
health insurance coverage people are expecting.
Another serious concern I have is about the security of the federal
exchange website. When registering for coverage, people have to supply
a significant amount of personal information; this includes IRS
information and data like your social security number. Testimony, and
documents, from Health and Human Services officials have revealed that
the website did not go through all of the necessary security testing
that was needed before the website went live.
These are just some of the many issues with HealthCare.gov and the new
law in general. I am not surprised that these problems have come up,
which is why I voted for legislation that would delay the requirement
that everyone have health insurance by 2014. As the holiday season is
upon us, Americans do not need this kind of uncertainty when it comes
to their health care coverage.
Sincerely,
Kay Granger
Member of Congress

during their weekly press conference to highlight many of these very
concerns. To watch my remarks, click here.

Dear
Friend,
Since
the
health
care
website&#8217;s
rollout,
I
have
received
numerous
phone
calls,
emails
and
letters
from
constituents
who
are
concerned
about
ObamaCare&#8217;s
impact
on
their
personal
health
care
and
our
nation&#8217;s
health
care
system.
As
an
ObamaCare
enrollee
myself,
I
share
your
concerns,
especially
after
seeing
the
ongoing
problems
with
the
website.
Even
though
some
of
the
website&#8217;s
bugs
have
now
been
resolved,
there
are
still
lingering
problems
with
the
website
and
the
overall
implementation
of
the
health
care
law.
Many
people
signing
up
for
health
insurance
on
the
federal
government&#8217;s
website
are
being
told
they
have
completed
the
process
and
have
health
insurance,
but
are
later
finding
out
their
information
was
never
transmitted
to
the
actual
insurance
companies,
or
the
forms
the
insurance
company
received
were
incorrect
or
incomplete.
Without
correct
and
complete
information
from
the
federal
government
website,
insurance
companies
cannot
provide
the
health
insurance
coverage
people
are
expecting.
Another
serious
concern
I
have
is
about
the
security
of
the
federal
exchange
website.
When
registering
for
coverage,
people
have
to
supply
a
significant
amount
of
personal
information;
this
includes
IRS
information
and
data
like
your
social
security
number.
Testimony,
and
documents,
from
Health
and
Human
Services
officials
have
revealed
that
the
website
did
not
go
through
all
of
the
necessary
security
testing
that
was
needed
before
the
website
went
live.
These
are
just
some
of
the
many
issues
with
HealthCare.gov
and
the
new
law
in
general.
I
am
not
surprised
that
these
problems
have
come
up,
which
is
why
I
voted
for
legislation
that
would
delay
the
requirement
that
everyone
have
health
insurance
by
2014.
As
the
holiday
season
is
upon
us,
Americans
do
not
need
this
kind
of
uncertainty
when
it
comes
to
their
health
care
coverage.

Kay
Granger
