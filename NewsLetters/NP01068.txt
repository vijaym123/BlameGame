pleased to announce the first place winner of the Congressional Art

"Deadly Beauty." Melanie will receive two complimentary round-trip plane
tickets to attend a national reception in Washington, D.C. this June,

Balanced Budget
Resolution
Last week, I was pleased to
support the passage of the conference report for the fiscal year 2016
budget blueprint. This marks the first time Congress has worked to pass a
joint 10-year balanced budget resolution that forces Washington to live
within its means since 2001. Our budget provides for a strong
national defense, repeals Obamacare in full, strengthens and protects
Medicare and Social Security for our seniors, and most importantly, balances
in ten years without putting a single cent on the backs of taxpayers.
This pro-growth budget puts us on a path to fiscal responsibility and
sustainability while supporting the critical programs Americans depend
on.

Supporting our Servicemembers and
Veterans
Last week, the
House passed with my support the fiscal year 2016 Military Construction
and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill. This vital bill would provide
funding to ensure that our veterans are receiving access to the
highest quality care, that our servicemembers' housing is supported, and
that the necessary infrastructure for wartime, crisis, and peace support
is maintained. I'm hopeful the Senate will act quickly to pass this
crucial bill for our nation's servicemembers and veterans.
