Friends,
As we lead up to Independence Day, it's a great time to reflect on all
the things we are grateful for in our nation.
Though there is much
work to be done, we are extremely fortunate to be living in the most
amazing country in the world, and I am confident that our brightest
days are still ahead.
Honoring a Valiant South Carolina Marine
I was honored to meet with a true American hero this week.
South
Carolina Corporal William "Kyle" Carpenter, U.S. Marine Corps (Ret) was
in Washington, DC, this week to receive the Medal of Honor, the highest
honor awarded to a member of our Armed Forces for bravery in battle.
Corporal Carpenter has done by 24 what most of us will never do in our
lifetimes: he has laid his life on the line to protect his country and
his fellow soldiers.
Corporal Carpenter is incredibly humble, and his message was very
simple: to remember to thank those who give so much to serve.
We are
eternally grateful to Corporal Carpenter and all who serve our country
so we can sleep in peace at night. It was an honor to be able to visit
with him during his time in Washington, DC
for the ceremony.
Working for Our Veterans
I have continued to press the VA for answers on the shameful delays in
treatment our veterans have received.
Recently, I met with veterans
from across the state to hear
firsthand the problems they are having
, and yesterday, I talked with representatives
from South Carolina's veterans service organizations, sharing our
findings and working together to find the best solutions for moving
veterans' healthcare forward.
Finally, I was troubled by reports today that more than 10 percent of
veterans seeking care wait more than a month for an appointment - more
than double the number of veterans than what the VA previously
reported. Last Thursday, I wrote Veterans Affairs Acting Secretary
Sloan Gibson
requesting answers to specific questions about
the existence of backlogs, official waiting lists, "secret" waiting
lists or unauthorized scheduling lists that exist at all 13 Veteran
Health Administration facilities in South Carolina.
?If you were not able to come to our veterans listening sessions and
need help with the VA or any other federal agency, please contact my
office here
.
It is an honor to serve as your voice in the United States Senate.
Please do not hesitate to contact my office if we can ever be of
service to you.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott

About
Tim
Constituent
Services
News
and
Media Friends,
As
we
lead
up
to
Independence
Day,
it&#8217;s
a
great
time
to
reflect
on
all
the
things
we
are
grateful
for
in
our
nation.
Though
there
is
much
work
to
be
done,
we
are
extremely
fortunate
to
be
living
in
the
most
amazing
country
in
the
world,
and
I
am
confident
that
our
brightest
days
are
still
ahead.
Honoring
a
Valiant
South
Carolina
Marine
I
was
honored
to
meet
with
a
true
American
hero
this
week.
South
Carolina
Corporal
William
"Kyle"
Carpenter,
U.S.
Marine
Corps
(Ret)
was
in
Washington,
DC,
this
week
to
receive
the
Medal
of
Honor,
the
highest
honor
awarded
to
a
member
of
our
Armed
Forces
for
bravery
in
battle.
Corporal
Carpenter
has
done
by
24
what
most
of
us
will
never
do
in
our
lifetimes:
he
has
laid
his
life
on
the
line
to
protect
his
country
and
his
fellow
soldiers.
Corporal
Carpenter
is
incredibly
humble,
and
his
message
was
very
simple:
to
remember
to
thank
those
who
give
so
much
to
serve.
We
are
eternally
grateful
to
Corporal
Carpenter
and
all
who
serve
our
country
so
we
can
sleep
in
peace
at
night. It
was
an
honor
to
be
able
to
visit
with him
during
his

the

reports
today
that more
than
10

of
veterans
seeking

wait
more

&#8211;
more
