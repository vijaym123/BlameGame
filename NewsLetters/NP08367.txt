Friend -
Last week, the House of Representatives passed the Americas Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2014,
H.R. 4457,
with my support. This bill makes Section 179 of the IRS Tax Code permanent, providing important tax relief to small U.S. companies. It helps small business streamline records, purchase equipment, and reduce uncertainty for planning. This legislation passed by a vote of 272
144.
Bottom-line:
Its simple. Washington needs to get out of the way. We need to eliminate burdensome regulations and reduce the crippling tax load on small businesses so that they have the freedom they need to work, earn, grow, and create jobs.
Yours in service,
Randy
