Friend,
You&#39;ve put us in a REALLY good mood.
After Tuesday&#39;s news of our local donors being willing to match donations up to $10,000, you stepped up to the tune of $7,000. Color us impressed.
This is the biggest response we&#39;ve seen this year. We always knew we could count on you, and this just proves it - we know you&#39;ll step up when it counts, and we know that you understand what&#39;s at stake here.
We&#39;re just about $3,000 away from generating $20,000 - can you click here to give $5 and help push us over the edge?
Here&#39;s a reminder of what we&#39;re facing -
a primary election in less than a week, a primary account that will be closing, and an individual fundraising limit that is cut in half after the deadline.
When does that happen? We thought you&#39;d never ask!
The books close
June 3rd . Help us hit $10,000 before then - which, with the dollar-for-dollar match, will become $20,000.
Click here to give $5 now .
Thanks for being there for us.
Talk soon,
Team Bera
P.S. Did we mention the book closes on
June 3rd ? Because we want to be clear that the book closes on
June 3rd . Click here and give $5 or more before then.
P.P.S.
June 3rd .
