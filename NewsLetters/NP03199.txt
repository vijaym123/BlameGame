Republicans&#39; control of Congress has
not
been pretty. While Democrats fight tooth and nail to help middle class folks,
the GOP has already gone after Social Security, a woman&rsquo;s right to choose, and President Obama&rsquo;s immigration plan .
But if Republicans take control of both the White House and Congress in 2016?
Everything
we&rsquo;ve worked for could be in jeopardy.
GOP megadonors are salivating at the thought -- they&rsquo;re already throwing in big bucks. Which is why I need you now: You can&rsquo;t let Democrats fall behind in early donations.
I&rsquo;ll ask directly because I need you: Will you renew your DSCC membership before the FEC deadline in just 24 hours?
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
I know you don&rsquo;t want to see the GOP control the White House and Congress. We need to fight with all we&rsquo;ve got for Democrats who will protect Social Security and ensure that all Americans can get affordable health care!
But this is the cold, hard truth: If committed Democrats don&rsquo;t step up now, Republicans could take an insurmountable lead.
That&rsquo;s why we need to step it up and show the Republicans what we&rsquo;re made of.
The first FEC deadline of the year hits in 24 hours. Please donate immediately to renew your membership and help us defeat the GOP.
I really appreciate your help.
