Recently, I had the pleasure of joining the Congressional Career and Technical Education Caucus. This bipartisan caucus was created to support and promote Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs across the country, as well as well-paying, family-sustaining jobs in fields including STEM disciplines, nursing, construction, information technology, energy, cyber security, and other areas that keep our nation competitive in the global economy.
The skilled trades are often the hardest jobs to fill in the United States. A
recent release
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics cited approximately 876,000 jobs open in the trade, transportation, and utilities sectors, and 330,000 jobs open in manufacturing. These CTE programs help businesses close the skills gap by training up a competitive workforce and equipping students to fulfill these 21 st
century demands.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. On the topic of higher education, I recently supported
H.R. 529
a bipartisan bill to improve college savings and prepaid tuition plans, making them more flexible. The bill passed the House by a vote of 401-20, with my support, and is now headed over to the Senate for consideration.
