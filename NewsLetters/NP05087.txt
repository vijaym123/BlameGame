A brand new poll shows Brad
trailing
Republican Bob Dold by 2 points.

This morning, the obstacles were stacking up. But then...
As of 7 PM we&rsquo;re within STRIKING distance of a JAW-DROPPING 15,000 donations for Brad &ndash; just this month!!!
Our FINAL WEEK ad buy deadline is TOMORROW. It could be our last chance to turn things around for Brad. If we can hit 15,000 donations before the deadline, it&rsquo;ll be a
