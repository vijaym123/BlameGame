SKILLS Act Success
Across the state and our nation, jobs sit unfilled largely because
there simply aren't enough people with the skills to fill them. With
that in mind, I introduced the SKILLS Act
to fill in the skills gap that exists
in our job market.
The SKILLS Act, part of my Opportunity Agenda
, was designed to help deliver
high-quality, efficient job skills training to Americans.
I am very proud to say that key elements of my SKILLS Act were
incorporated into a bipartisan compromise, the Workforce Innovation and
Opportunity Act (WIOA), that was passed by both houses of Congress and
signed into law by the President earlier this week.
Our nation has incredible resources, and the first among those is our
people.
It is my hope that WIOA will help us begin to address the
skills gap in our job market and get more Americans back to work in
good paying jobs.
Honoring Vietnam War Era Veterans
America's service men and women paid a heavy price in the Vietnam War,
and we can never thank them enough.
I have had the privilege of honoring our WWII
and Korean War era veterans
for the past two years, and this year we
will have a very special ceremony honoring all of those who served
during the Vietnam War era.
On Saturday, August 2, 2014 at 10 AM
at the First Baptist Church in Columbia, all Vietnam War
era veterans and their families are invited to come and be recognized,
and our doors are open to all who would like to come and thank them for
their service. More information can be found at
www.scott.senate.gov/veterans
or by calling
toll-free (844) 820-0146
.
I am honored to serve as your voice in the United States Senate.
Please don't hesitate to contact
my office if we can ever be of
service to you.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott
