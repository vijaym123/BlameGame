Our Nations Manufacturing Sector
Our nations
manufacturing sector is key to creating jobs and growing our
economy.
Earlier this month I completed my annual manufacturing tour.
I
enjoy this annual tour because not only can I highlight the important
work manufacturers and their employees are doing in our district, but
I get to hear from them about what is working and what is hindering
growth in their vital sector of the economy.
It should come
as no surprise that over regulation is a dominant theme I hear when I
visit manufacturers and other businesses in our district.
These
regulations are directly or indirectly the result of too much
Washington regulation.
Regulatory costs in America are difficult to
measure because many of their effects are hidden, but it is estimated the
cost is equal to over $14,000 per family, or 23 percent of a familys
average income.
Often the cost of regulation is highest for
small businesses that are ill-equipped to navigate the bureaucratic
compliance procedures that accompany many regulations.
One
important thing Washington can do to help manufacturers is remove the
government barriers to growth by cutting red tape and strengthening our
nations entrepreneurs' ability to build, grow their business, and compete
in a free and open market.
I am a proud supporter of the
Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny
(REINS)
Act .
The REINS Act reforms the outdated regulatory process by
requiring Congress to vote on any major new regulation with an economic
cost of $50 million or more.
I am also a cosponsor of the
Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act .
This legislation would establish a fund to create innovation centers
designed to partner with private business to commercialize inventions
discovered in basic research performed by universities and research
labs.
Developed products could then be brought to U.S. manufacturers
for production.
I believe it is important to hear from our
nations job creators about their efforts to produce products here at
home and create the jobs our economy needs.
Washington can help
unleash growth in the manufacturing sector by reining in over
regulation and allowing them to build, grow, and
compete.
