What a win!
Did you catch Thursdays game? What a win! Because I know the Warriors will be bringing home the OBrien trophy,
I made a friendly wager
with my friend, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge of Cleveland. On the line are some of the East Bays finest products: Clif bars, Ghirardelli Chocolates, Peets Warriors Ground Coffee, an autographed photo of Stephen Curry and an Oaklandish tote.
Im so proud to be showing off my Oakland pride during the NBA Finals
and Im sure you are too!

Protecting access to medical marijuana
The federal government should never come between patients and their medicine. This week, I was proud to join a bipartisan coalition in passing an amendment to protect state medical marijuana programs.
This amendment brings us one step closer to providing greater relief to those suffering from multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, cancer, HIV/AIDS and other medical conditions. Watch my floor speech on this critical civil rights issue

End the gun violence on our streets
On Wednesday, I joined people around the country and the world in wearing orange to call for greater action to address gun violence in our communities.
In Congress, Ive introduced
the Tiahrt Restrictions Repeal Act
(H.R. 1449) to address gun violence as the public health crisis that it is. Ending gun violence in our community is one of my top priorities
too many lives have already been lost. Its past time for action.
