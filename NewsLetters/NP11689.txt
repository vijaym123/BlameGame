Friends,
Too many American families are still struggling in this tough economy,
and rising energy bills are squeezing family budgets even more. One of
the coldest winters in years has made matters worse, driving up heating
costs nationwide.
That's why the House acted this week to lower energy costs through
commonsense reforms that will boost domestic energy production, reduce
red tape, and encourage energy efficiency.
One bill - the RAPID Act
- streamlines the environmental review
process for new construction projects and cracks down on junk lawsuits.
Another bill - the Electricity Security and Affordability Act
- is aimed to combat the Obama
Administration's "war on coal" by reining in overreaching regulations
imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
Another energy bill passed this week addresses the propane availability
problem that many Alabama farmers have faced this winter. I've heard
from many farmers who have had difficulty acquiring propane this
winter. It's especially a problem for our poultry farmers who need the
propane to heat their chicken houses. The HHEATT Act
eases restrictions that have hindered the
transportation of propane and put our farmers at risk.
House Republicans and a growing number of Democrats also continue to
put pressure on the Obama Administration to finally approve development
of the Keystone XL Pipeline. In addition to lowering costs and creating
jobs, approving the Keystone Pipeline would also be a key step towards
decreasing American reliance on foreign sources of energy.
President Obama said in 2008 that under his environmental plan,
"electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket,"
and that new regulations would "bankrupt" coal
producers. Unfortunately, President Obama and other environmentalists
would have middle class families foot the bill for their radical
agenda.
Americans experience the pain of high energy costs every time they fill
up at the pump or pay the power bill. We need an "all of the above"
energy strategy that includes the development of American oil and
natural gas, alternative energy sources such as solar, hydropower,
wind, and nuclear, and the continued development of clean coal. More
information on our comprehensive energy plan can be found online at
www.gop.gov/energy
.
Situation in Ukraine
What Russia has done is outrageous and should not be allowed to stand.
We need to bring all of our diplomatic and economic tools to bear,
provide leadership in the world and make it clear that Putin's actions
have consequences.
This week, the House is expected to vote on a resolution that would
encourage the Obama administration to bring economic sanctions against
the Russian government. The House has also passed legislation designed
to assist Ukraine with temporary loan guarantees in their time of need.
This is a time for America to speak with one voice - and to rally our
allies to speak up too. We also need to be looking two steps ahead.
Russia has shown every intention of interrupting our efforts to keep
Iran in check. We need to demonstrate our willingness to stand up to
Putin now before the consequences get even greater down the road.
The Week Ahead
As you know, I have long spoken out against the Obama administration
for the numerous occasions where they acted beyond the Constitutional
restraints on the Executive Branch. That's why I am glad the House will
focus this week on legislation designed to rein in executive
overreaches.
Specifically, the House is expected to vote on:
*	H.R. 3973
, the
Faithful Execution of the Law Act, to require federal officials to
report to Congress when the Administration fails to faithfully enforce
current law;
*	H.R. 4138
, the
ENFORCE Act, to establish procedures under which the House, or the
Senate, may authorize a lawsuit against the Executive Branch for
failure to faithfully execute the laws;
*	H.R. 311
, the Farmers
Undertake Environmental Land Stewardship Act, to direct the EPA to
change the spill prevention, control, and countermeasure for certain
farms - I am a proud cosponsor of this bill; and
*	H.R. 3474
, the
Hire More Heroes Act, to allow employers to exempt veterans from being
taken into account for purposes of the employer mandate under ObamaCare.
As always, I appreciate the opportunity to hear from you
directly about the issues of interest to you. My door
is always open, so I look forward to hearing from you,
Washington DC

Situation
in
Ukraine
What
Russia
has
done
is
outrageous
and
should
not
be
allowed
to
stand.
We
need
to
bring
all
of
our
diplomatic
and
economic
tools
to
bear,
provide
leadership
in
the
world
and
make
it
clear
that
Putin&#8217;s
actions
have
consequences.
This
week,
the
House
is
expected
to
vote
on
a
resolution
that
would
encourage
the
Obama
administration
to
bring
economic
sanctions
against
the
Russian
government.
The
House
has
also
passed
legislation
designed
to
assist
Ukraine
with
temporary
loan
guarantees
in
their
time
of
need.
This
is
a
time
for
America
to
speak
with
one
voice
&#8211;
and
to
rally
our
allies
to
speak
up
too.
We
also
need
to
be
looking
two
steps
ahead.
Russia
has
shown
every
intention
of
interrupting
our
efforts
to
keep
Iran
in
check.
We
need
to
demonstrate
our
willingness
to
stand
up
to
Putin
now
before
the
consequences
get
even
greater
down
the
road.
The
Week
Ahead
As
you
know,
I
have
long
spoken

against
the
Obama
administration
for
the
numerous
occasions
where
they
acted
beyond
the
Constitutional

why
I
am
glad
the

Specifically,
the

3973 ,
the

of
the
Law

to
require
federal

to
report
to
Congress
when
the
Administration
fails
to
faithfully
enforce
current
law; H.R.
4138 ,
the
ENFORCE
Act,
to
establish
procedures
under
which
the
House,
or
the
Senate,
may
authorize
a
lawsuit
against
the
Executive
Branch
for
failure
to
faithfully
execute
the
laws;
H.R.
311 ,
the
Farmers
Undertake
Environmental
Land
Stewardship
Act,
to
direct
the
EPA
to
change
the
spill
prevention,
control,
and
countermeasure
for
certain
farms
-
I
am
a
proud
cosponsor
of
this
bill;
and H.R.
3474 ,
the
Hire
More

Act,
to
allow
employers
to
exempt
veterans
from
being
taken
into

for

of
the
employer
mandate
under
ObamaCare.
As
