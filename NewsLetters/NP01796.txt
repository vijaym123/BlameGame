This week, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio
wishes all Christians a happy Easter, and
he wishes the Jewish community a blessed
Passover.
Rubio Wishes All Christians A Happy
Easter
This Sunday, my wife Jeanette and our
entire family will join our fellow
Christians in Florida and around the
world in celebrating Christs
Resurrection and the salvation His
sacrifice and unconditional love gave the
world.
During this Holy Week, I am reminded
of the men and women in our armed forces
whose service and personal sacrifice has
taken them away from their families
during this blessed holiday. I pray that
God protect them this Easter and bless
them and their families.
For many Christians, the miracle of
Easter offers hope and a spirit of
renewal to all who seek inspiration to
fulfill their individual promise. As we
remember all that Christ endured, we are
provided with an opportunity to reflect
and recommit ourselves to serving God and
following His sons example to love
and serve one another.
May you, your family, and our nation
continue to be blessed with God's gift of
love and peace, especially on this
special holiday.
Happy Easter.
Rubio Wishes The Jewish Community A
Happy Passover
With tonights sundown marking
the start of the Festival of Passover, I
would like to extend my best wishes to
the Jewish community in Florida, across
America and around the world.
Earlier this week, we hosted a
Passover Seder at my regional office in
Miami and joined in the Jewish tradition
of retelling the story of the Exodus and
the victory of faith over
oppression.
Passover commemorates the emancipation
of the Israelites from centuries of
slavery in ancient Egypt and celebrates
the values of every free society. As
Jewish families prepare to come together
for Passover Seder tonight, we remember
all the trials and tribulations endured
by the Jews to be sovereign and we give
thanks for the freedoms we enjoy as
Americans.
During this years Festival of
Freedom, I vow to continue to defend the
values of freedom and liberty for all. In
the midst of a crucial moment in the
Middle Easts history, this
Passover, I pray especially for a
peaceful and prosperous future for
Israel, and that our friends in the
Jewish state may have a safe and
meaningful celebration.
On behalf of my wife Jeanette and our
entire family, we wish you a Happy
Passover. Chag Sameach.
Constituent Casework
Corner
Gerald, a resident of Parrish, FL,
contacted our office with an urgent
passport case. He had applied for a
passport in February and was asked to
provide additional evidence before the
agency could process his application. He
submitted as much supporting evidence as
he could, but his passport was still
pending. Since Gerald had a scheduled
trip within 7 days, members of Senator
Rubios staff contacted the agency,
sent them copies of all his documentation
and requested that his case be
expedited.Within 24 hours, his
passport was processed, approved and
mailed overnight.

Agency Updates
Department of Veteran Affairs
(VA):
As of 3/24/15, the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs is
requiring veterans or survivors seeking
benefits to use standardized claims and
appeals forms when applying for
disability compensation, pension,
survivors pension, and dependency
and indemnity compensation (DIC). The
forms are designed to clearly help the
veteran list the symptoms or conditions
for which they are requesting benefits
and provide the information necessary for
the VA to start processing their claims
and appeals. Veterans can either use the
new paper forms or submit claims and
appeals online.
Additionally, as of 3/24/15, veterans
or survivors who need additional time to
gather information and evidence can
submit an Intent to File a Claim for
Compensation or Pension/or Pension or
Survivors Pension and/DIC. These
individual will have up to one year from
the date they submit an intent to file
form to submit their completed claim
form. If they are ultimately approved for
benefits, in most cases, the date at
which the benefits are originally
awarded, or effective date, will be the
start date for payment. So the intent to
file document preserves the
veterans claim date in most cases
but does not speed up the time needed to
actually process the claim or appeal.
VA:
VA Central Office issued a
news release on 3/30/15 saying it reduced
its inventory of backlogged claims from a
high of 611,000 claims in March 2013 to
few than 200,000 using new technology and
process solutions. In the release, VA
Under Secretary Hickey said a combination
of factors resulted in the 67% drop in
backlog: extra hours in evenings and on
weekends put in by VA employees,
procedural efficiencies, automation and
paperless claims processing, plus
training and quality assurance
programs.
