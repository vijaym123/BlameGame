Congressional Report
Dear Friends,
I would like to provide you with a few updates from my first week back in session in Washington after the holiday break.
My Legislative Record in 2013
According to the non-partisan group Gov Track's newly released Report Card, in 2013, I did not miss a single vote on the House Floor and was ranked the Texas Congressman who reached across the aisle the most.
I was also ranked the 8th most likely to reach commonsense solutions with Democrats and Republicans out of the 435 Members of the House of Representatives.
Remaining accountable to you by never missing a vote and finding commonsense solutions regardless of party lines or affiliations is my top priority.
I look forward to doing the same as your Congressman in 2014.
Congressman Cuellar serves the constituents of the 28th District of Texas in his Washington and Texas offices.

Outreach Coordinators Meet with Constituents in Universal City and La Vernia
This past week, my outreach coordinators Pete Arugello and Gilbert Lafuente visited constituents in University City and La Vernia.
In Universal City, Pete Arguello visited Kajun Kuisine restaurant, which provided delicious desserts for a meeting at the University City Public Library.
Pete talked to restaurant owners about ways in which my office can help grow jobs and the economy.
Pete Arguelloe meets with a Universal City business owner to discuss constituent services.
In La Vernia, Gilbert Lafuente met with Fire Chief Bruce Ritchey and Lieutenant Danny Pitts to discuss services my office can provide.
Congressman Cuellar's outreach coordinator meets with La Vernia Fire Department to discuss constituent services.
Gateway Community Health Center in Laredo and Atascosa Health Center in Pleasanton Earn Federal Funds
Gateway Community Health Center in Laredo and Atascosa Health Center in Pleasanton have both earned federal funds in a competitive grant process for specifically geared towards community health centers.
Gateway Community Health Center earned $130,182 in federal funds and Atascosa Health Center earned $63,955.
Local community centers like Gateway are where the rubber meets the road in implementation of the new health insurance marketplace.
Its simple
when we help local organizations help themselves, they can provide the kind of face to face, personalized care and assistance that gives taxpayers the guidance they need to enroll in new plans.
I congratulate Gateway Community Health Center and Atascosa Health Center and their staffs for the excellent job they have done in helping Webb, Zapata, Jim Hogg, Atascosa, and Wilson County residents gain access to quality, affordable health care

Healthcare Costs for Seniors Down Across TX28
Earlier this month, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid announced good news for seniors: The Affordable Care Act has reduced costs of prescription drugs and expanded access to preventative care for seniors in Texas and across the country.
Seniors across Texas rely on Medicare to cover their basic healthcare needs, and I am pleased to see that their costs have decreased during 2013. Prescription drug costs can be a huge burden on seniors, especially those seniors living under the Medicare Part-D donut hole that fails to cover costs that are not catastrophic.
