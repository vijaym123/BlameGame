Today we honor the patriots who selflessly gave their lives in
defense of our great nation.
It is their sacrifice that allows us
to enjoy our American way of life.
As your Congressman, I am humbled to
represent a region home to more than 66,000 veterans.
These brave
men and women deserve all the care and respect a grateful nation can
offer.
To date, more than one million Americans have given their lives in
service to our nation.
These heroes represent the very best of
America.
May God bless them and their families.
In an address to the nation on
January 16, 1984, President Ronald Reagan said, We will always
remember.
We will always be proud.
We will always be prepared,
so we may always be free.
Truer words have never been
spoken.
Please feel free to share
your thoughts with me on this Memorial
Day.
