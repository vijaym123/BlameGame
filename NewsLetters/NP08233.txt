Crisis at the Border: My Latest Update
I spoke to MSNBC recently about the ongoing immigration situation along the U.S.-Mexico border. I provided an update on the crisis at the border and discussed some of my solutions to address the deluge of illegal immigration at the border.
Over the past few weeks, I have been speaking out regarding the recent crisis of migrant children crossing the border into the U.S.
I joined my colleague, Senator John Cornyn, in sending a letter to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to express our concerns over the federal response to the crisis at the border. In the letters, we requested that both agencies report back to Congress on the security of unaccompanied minors and the growing crisis at the border.
To view the full text of the letters, please visit my website:

Sen. Cornyn, Rep. Cuellar Demand Answers from Administration on Growing Humanitarian Crisis in South Texas
This week, I worked with the Appropriations Committee to boost funding and support to Mexico and Central America that will increase our ability to stem the flow of illegal immigration and unaccompanied minors crossing our southern border. We are witnessing a humanitarian and resource crisis at the border and we can no longer afford to play defense on the United States-Mexico border.
We must take firm action to stem the flow of illegal immigration at its source and I feel that this weeks Committee action takes a strong step towards addressing the problem.
TX28 Students and Families in the US Capitol
Katie Morales, from Bruni, and Kelly Poore, from La Vernia, came by my D.C. office as a part of the Government in Action Youth tour. We discussed their interest in government and a career in public service.
Katie Morales and Kelly Poore, two students from TX28, were in Washington, D.C., as part of the Government in Action Youth tour and dropped by my office. I talked with them about their experience so far and heard their stories. Thanks for stopping by and I hope to see you two in D.C. again soon!
Paola Canales-Lozano and Christopher Godkin were both in Washington, D.C. and stopped by my office. They are representing South Texas as part of the National Youth Leaders Conference.
These two students came by my office and talked with me about their time spent with the National Youth Leaders Conference. This is a great program that helps students to get in touch with members of Congress. I enjoyed talking with you two!
This group of students from South Texas all recently graduated from high school and are preparing to start off in college. They came by my office and talked about the next steps in their education.
This group of recent high school graduates are enjoying their summer break before heading off to their freshman year in college. The group includes graduates from St. Augustine High School, Martin High School, Laredo ISD Early College High School, L.G. Cigarroa High School, United High School, and JW Nixon High School in Laredo. I emphasized the importance to continuing their education and they are excited about the opportunities ahead of them.
I met with two students from TX28 who stopped by my office as part of the GEAR UP Program. We discussed our shared enthusiasm for continued education.
I met with Ernesto Espinosa and Beatriz Ramirez Guevara, who were in Washington, D.C., representing South Texas in the GEAR UP Program. We discussed college preparedness and taking control of your education. I wish the best of luck to both you in your pursuits. Thanks for stopping by and come again!
Twitter Updates
The announcement that the U.S. is set to export oil for the first time since the 1970's could have a big impact on TX28 with the Eagle Ford Shale being such a productive source of oil and natural gas.
I spoke on the American Newsroom show for FOX News about the child migrant crisis going on in our District. The talk was productive and I will continue to search for a solution until it is resolved.
Sincerely,
