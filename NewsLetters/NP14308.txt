Dear Friends,
This week
in the District, my Arizona team and I have been focusing on two
matters that are deeply important to meVeterans and Valley
Fever.
Veterans Day
On Saturday, we hosted a pre-Veterans Day
open house at the office to honor the sacrifices our veterans have made
to protect our nation and our freedom.
Our featured speakers were students from the Veterans
Heritage Project (VHP), who shared with us what they learned in
interviewing local veterans.
Over the past six years, VHP students have
interviewed over 600 veterans for
compilations of stories that are submitted in annual books to the Library
of Congress.

Veterans Heritage Project collaboration and Veterans'
stories

Valley Fever
This week is also Valley Fever Awareness Week. Valley Fever is
an illness caused by a fungus found in desert soil that can cause
flu-like symptoms, pneumonia and even more serious effects requiring
hospitalization.
It impacts Arizona more than any other state in the
U.S.more than 150,000 cases go undiagnosed every year. Im pleased
to be able to lend my voice to help raise awareness of this disease,
which currently has no effective means of prevention, no cure and
limited treatment options.
On Monday, I joined Dr. John Galgiani from the University of Arizona
Valley Fever Center of Excellence at an educational forum hosted by
The 3000 Club.
Please join me
in raising awareness by sharing the video below with your friends and
family so more residents can learn to recognize the symptoms and
impacts of Valley Fever.

Holiday Travel and
Passports
My caseworkers
have asked me to remind those of you planning international travel for
the holidays to check your passports, including those of your family
members and children ravelling with you, to ensure they are valid and
up-to-date.
We get many last-minute calls close to the holidays from residents
whose travel plans are in danger of being derailed by passports that are
expired, missing or out of pages.
According to the U.S. State Department,
current delivery times are about 4 weeks for routine processing and about
2 weeks for expedited processing (which costs more).
District
residents who are experiencing issues or time delays in getting a
passport request processed can contact the District Office and speak to a
caseworker, who may be able to assist. Visit our
website
or call 480-946-2411 if you need
assistance.
Sincerely,
Five Veterans
Heritage Project students joined the open house to shared their
experiences interviewing service members.
