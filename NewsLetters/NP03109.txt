Friends,
I hope you are doing well
and enjoying the new year as we get into the thick of winter. On
Monday, our nation stopped to remember and honor the legacy of Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr., truly one of our country's greatest
leaders.
On Tuesday, President Obama delivered his annual State of the
Union address to Congress and I will tell you, I'm glad the pageantry of
the speech is over so my colleagues can join me in focusing on the
things we were elected to do
which starts with finding solutions to the
problems facing our constituents.
Regrettably, the
President made it clear hes not interested in working with us in Congress to
achieve those solutions, but rather spending more of our money. His
new proposals are going to cost $68 Billion more than the budget weve
agreed to. Im a numbers guy, and thats a 7% increase we cant afford
to spend.
The way I see it, my job is to roll up my
sleeves to help the middle class and grow our economy, so our small
businesses can succeed in a global marketplace without Washington regulations
holding them down.
This week I voted with my colleagues
in the House to pass
H.R. 161, the Natural Gas
Pipeline Permitting Reform Act , a bill to further America's energy
renaissance and increase access to natural gas. Over half the homes in the
U.S. are heated by natural gas, but in many places there is a shortage
of pipeline capacity as federal regulators are getting in the way -
causing delays that can drag on for months and leave construction
projects in limbo. This bill reforms the permitting process and ensures that
pipeline construction has a clear timeline.
I was glad to
back home on Friday a busy day of meetings with constituents and small
business owners. I participated in a forum with my fellow Congressmen
and Northeast Ohio Mayors and City Managers, as we discussed ways we
can all work together to do what's best for the region. I also had a
chance to stop by the Stow-Munroe Falls Library and deliver a
Congressional Proclamation of Recognition on their 90th
Anniversary.
As always, it is an honor to
represent you.
-Dave
