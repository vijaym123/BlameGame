Dear Friends,
On Wednesday I chaired a Homeland Security Committee hearing
delving into the White House's narrative on al-Qaeda. The
president and his administration have repeatedly told the American
people that al-Qaeda is on the run but in reality, al-Qaeda has evolved
and now has its largest presence in the Arab world. Downplaying the
situation as the White House continues to do is dangerous and opens us
up to further attacks. It is through America's stable leadership and
ability to clearly identify our enemies that we will secure the
Homeland and protect the American people.
The threat from al-Qaeda is one of the reasons I voted for the
discretionary funding bill for 2014
that
passed the house on Thursday.
This bill provides important relief from
the sequester for the Department of Defense while giving our troops a
much deserved pay raise.
Relief from the sequester will allow us to
maintain a strong national security apparatus and ensures our military
readiness will be preserved.
Cutting Spending
In addition to funding our military, the appropriations bill reduces
overall spending by $21.4 billion compared to the sequester spending
level from last year
This bill continues to turn the tide toward
reducing our debt, which began when Republicans took control of
the House four years ago.
Since 2010, Republicans have reduced
discretionary spending by $165 billion
,
and I will continue to push for reforms to our entitlement programs
where the greatest savings potential exists.
You can read my full
statement on the bill and its importance to national security and
securing our border here
.
NSA Reform
Along with Congressman Adam Schiff, I introduced the bipartisan
Intelligence Community Oversight Act, HR 3900
. Currently the Government Accountability Office, the
investigative, oversight arm of the Congress, is denied full access to
information by the Intelligence Community thereby impeding GAO's
oversight efforts. This legislation clarifies the authority of the
Government Accountability Office to conduct audits, investigations,
evaluations, and reviews of intelligence agencies, including NSA. GAO
has a long and successful history of assisting Congress in its
oversight duties with every other branch of the Federal Government. The
Intelligence Community is critical to our national security, however
its agencies should not be exempt from the jurisdiction of the GAO.
This bill will help Congress serve as a better check and balance to the
Intelligence Community and assure the American people that abuses in
intelligence gathering and invasions of privacy will not be tolerated.
Healthcare.gov Oversight
The House also passed the Exchange Information Disclosure Act, HR 3362
.
It
will require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to
provide weekly reports on the status of Healthcare.gov. Information
that will be included in these reports will allow Congress to conducts
its due diligence and oversight of Obamacare's progress and hold the
administration accountable for the law.
HID Global Ribbon Cutting Ceremony
Earlier in the week I was honored to participate in a ribbon cutting at
HID Global's new headquarters
in Austin. HID Global, which are moving its
headquarters from California to Austin and bringing 400 jobs to the
area, specializes in secure identification cards and was recently
awarded a contract to produce green cards for the U.S. Citizenship and
Immigration Services, a vital part of securing our borders.

Dear
Friends,
On
Wednesday
I
chaired
a
Homeland
Security
Committee
hearing
delving
into
the
White
House&#8217;s
narrative
on
al-Qaeda. The
president
and
his
administration
have
repeatedly
told
the
American
people
that
al-Qaeda
is
on
the
run
but
in
reality,
al-Qaeda
has
evolved
and
now
has
its
largest
presence
in
the
Arab
world.
Downplaying
the
situation
as
the
White
House
continues
to
do
is
dangerous
and
opens
us
up
to
further
attacks. It
is
through
America&#8217;s
stable
leadership
and
ability
to
clearly
identify
our
enemies
that
we
will
secure
the
Homeland
and
protect
the
American
people.
The
threat
from
al-Qaeda
is
one
of
the
reasons
I
voted
for
the
discretionary
funding
bill
for
2014
that
passed
the
house
on
Thursday.
This
bill
provides
important
relief
from
the
sequester
for
the
Department
of
Defense
while
giving
our
troops
a
much

Relief
from

sequester
will
allow
us
to
maintain
a
strong
national

apparatus
and
ensures
our
military
readiness
will
be
preserved.

In
addition
to
funding
our
military,
the
appropriations
bill
reduces
overall
spending

spending
