Dear Friend:
I hope that you are enjoying the company of family and friends on this
Easter Sunday.
As we celebrate, please join me in offering a special
prayer for those who are less fortunate and those who are separated
from their loved ones, especially our brave service members who have
sacrificed so much for our freedoms.
On behalf of my wife Susan and
the entire Southerland family, I pray that you have a joyous Easter
Sunday filled with many blessings.
Women's Small Business Roundtable
Last weekend, I was joined by Congresswoman Ann Wagner (R-MO) in
hosting a roundtable with more than 30 women business owners and
educators from across North Florida to discuss economic challenges and
the personal success they've had in growing local jobs.
Our
conversation covered a wide range of topics, including the impact of
Obamacare on our health care system, the growing burden of government
taxes, and the alarming rise of human trafficking in America.
I was
encouraged by our discussion and look forward to utilizing this
information to further strengthen our economy and create new
opportunities for hardworking women in Bay County.
Restoring Fiscal Sanity
I recently voted for the House-approved "Path to Prosperity" budget
that lowers taxes on hardworking families and the small businesses that
create local jobs.
This budget will balance by reducing $5 trillion in
wasteful Washington spending over the next decade, while eliminating
special interest tax loopholes.
And I have supported provisions that
will spur the comprehensive reform necessary to remove barriers that
make it more difficult for businesses to reinvest funds from overseas
in creating new, well-paying jobs here at home.
Fighting for Florida Fishermen
Following the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council's vote to
shorten the Gulf of Mexico's red snapper season from 40 days to 11
days, it is painfully obvious that the Gulf's red snapper fishery is
not being managed to foster growth and economic opportunity, but
instead to push our fishermen off the water and out of business.
When
this terribly shortsighted decision is implemented, it will be
impossible to restore the certainty our fishermen need to build a
business, support a family, and grow an economy.
Limiting our
fishermen to only 11 days of work has serious consequences, and I
believe we've been left with no choice but to consider new management
methods for red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico.
Visiting Deer Point Elementary
This past week I had the pleasure of spending time with students at
Panama City's Deer Point Elementary School.
During the visit, I was
provided the special opportunity of reading to the school's second
grade class and participating in a Social Studies lesson with fifth
grade students.
Following the schools dismissal, I was also provided
the unique opportunity to meet privately with teachers and parents to
personally hear any thoughts or concerns they may have.
Combating Sexual Assault in America
April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, a time that brings much-needed
attention to the challenges we still face as a nation in keeping our
moms, sisters, daughters, friends and neighbors safe.
As the father of
four daughters myself, I am personally invested in finding solutions
that protect women from the threat of physical violence and sexual
assault in America.

political bickering to address the safety of women in America, please

As

who
have
sacrificed
so
much
for

On

of
my

the
entire
Southerland
family,
I
pray

Women&#8217;s
Small

Last

I
was

by

on
our
health
care
system,
the
growing
burden

and
the
alarming
rise
of
human

in
America.
I
was
encouraged
by
our
discussion
and
look
forward
to
utilizing
this
information
to
further
strengthen
our
economy
and
create
new
opportunities
for
hardworking
women
in
Bay
County.

I
recently
voted

by
