Wicker Part of Effort to Prevent Military
Suicides
New Legislation Would Increase Mental
Health
Outreach for All Service
Members
Earlier this year, I had the
opportunity to meet the parents of Jacob Sexton
a member of the Indiana
National Guard who committed suicide while on leave from Afghanistan
in 2009.
The Sextons have been dedicated advocates for raising
awareness about suicide prevention in hopes of helping other military
families.
Jacob's story inspired the "Jacob Sexton Military
Suicide Prevention Act of 2014," which I introduced with Sen. Joe Donnelly
(D-Ind.) on May
7.
Unfortunately, Jacob is one of many American heroes we have lost to suicide
a
growing tragedy among U.S. troops in recent years.
Early
estimates show that more than 470 service members took their own lives last
year.
This follows an alarmingly high rate in 2012, when America
lost more active-duty troops to suicide than in combat in
Afghanistan.
Rates of suicide among veterans are similarly troubling,
underscoring the urgent need for better mental health care in the military.
Targeted Improvements to Mental Health
Services
The "Jacob Sexton Act"
would be a critical step toward improving the military's ability to
identify members struggling with mental health issues.
The
legislation would require annual in-person mental health screenings for all
service members
not just those being deployed.
Currently,
those in the deployment cycle get the most consistent screenings, while
members of the National Guard and Reserve may not have the same
access.
Although suicides by
active-duty troops have recently declined, suicides by National Guard and
Reserve members are still on the rise, reaching record numbers last
year.
In addition to mental health assessments, my legislation with
Sen. Donnelly would also target improvements to the existing care
provided to these
forces.
Specifically, the bill would establish a working group between the
Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Health and Human Services to
identify and recommend better approaches to the military's mental
health practices.
DOD would also be required to give Congress a
report each year detailing how it is responding to mental health issues
and follow-up care.
Military Suicide Prevention on Senate
Agenda
I am
encouraged by the bipartisan support already shown in Congress to address this
terrible problem and to ensure that our service members get the
assistance they need.
Last year, Sen. Donnelly and I
both members of
the Senate Armed Services Committee
offered an amendment that laid
the groundwork for the "Jacob Sexton Act" during consideration of the
Fiscal Year 2014 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).
It
was unanimously adopted by the committee, and we are optimistic that
the latest version of our legislation will again be incorporated into
NDAA when debate begins at the end of the
month.
America's troops face unique challenges in fulfilling
their missions on and off the battlefield, which is why access to
adequate mental health care is so important to their well-being.
Addressing military suicides is one way Congress can send a signal to
service members that they and their families will have the resources they
need for help.
In emphasizing effective care and patient privacy,
the "Jacob Sexton Act" would bring us closer to lowering what have
become heartbreaking statistics.
