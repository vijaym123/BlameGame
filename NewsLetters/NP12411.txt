Healthcare Update
New healthcare enrollment numbers were released this week
, and I want to report back to you. I invite you to read
and share this update on how healthcare reform is shaping up in our
state, ways I'm working to improve the law, and how to find important
healthcare resources.
Patrice's Story
"I was about to lose my life. In April, after 25 years at my job, I was
let go because I am diabetic. I immediately started fighting to try and
get health insurance, but I kept getting the same answer: 'You have a
pre-existing condition,' so no insurer would cover me.
"Without a
job and without health insurance, I could no longer afford
medication. I was unable to monitor my insulin, and I began getting
seizures.
"Then, thanks to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), everything changed. On
January 1st, I was enrolled in a plan on the Affordable Care Act's new
Marketplace. It's the best thing that ever happened to me. Like a lot
of people, I had trouble with the broken website, but I didn't give up.
"When I finally got through the website, I cried. I pay $36 per month
thanks to the ACA's financial assistance. When I got my insurance card,
I drove to my doctor with a smile on my face after 9 months of pain.
"I worked all my life. I've been fighting diabetes all my life, and the
Affordable Care Act saved my life."

Innovating Care
Dr. Barbara A. Walters
Dartmouth-Hitchcock is one of the first participants in the Affordable
Care Act's Pioneer Accountable Care Organizations
project, which supports
systems that are working on new models to improve coordinated and
preventive care, eliminate wasteful spending, and move away from
"fee-for-service" systems to a system that rewards quality instead of
quantity. My office interviewed Dr. Barbara A. Walters, Executive
Medical Director, who is leading the project.
Q: Why did Dartmouth Hitchcock decide to become one of the first
Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs)?
A: The ACO program is for organizations like Dartmouth-Hitchcock who
are interested in new and novel ways of managing quality and cost of
populations of patients. One of the things you can do more efficiently
is really pay attention to care across the continuum of care. So the
providers agree to take some responsibility for the cost and quality of
care, and say, let us step up and be part of the solution.
Q: What is it like to be a patient in an ACO?
A: We might call up patients before they even think to call us, and we
might say "Oh, Mrs. Jones, did you know it's been a year since your
last mammogram, and our guidelines say that you should have another
mammogram this year. Would you like to come in and see your doctor?"
Q: What has patient feedback been like?
A: Healthcare can become very complicated, especially for Medicare
patients, as people are lucky enough to live longer. So patients really
like that their doctors and our office team are working to develop care
plans, and feeling comfortable that they don't have to remember every
little thing that has to be done.
Q: What are your plans moving forward?
A: We want people across New Hampshire to have access to these kinds of
programs. Exeter Hospital, Catholic Medical Center, and St. Joseph have
just joined for 2014.

Consumer Access and
Network Adequacy
Network Adequacy Public Informational Hearing,
Concord, NH
On February 10th, the New Hampshire Insurance Department held a public
forum to discuss network adequacy. My prepared testimony was delivered
by letter to hearing attendees, since I was in D.C. for votes. Here's
an excerpt:
"I have been challenging Anthem's narrow network ever since its details
were announced. I believe that Anthem's decision to offer a narrow
network was wrong, especially since this year, it has a monopoly in the
Marketplace.
"The newly insured, those who had no insurance until they signed up
under the new healthcare law, are being directed to a much narrower
network than those who have employer based insurance or renewed their
Anthem policies by December 15, 2013.
"For a newly insured woman in the Ossipee area who needs prenatal care
now, the relief and happiness of finally having health insurance is
tempered by a longer drive to a hospital and doctor.
"The public deserves information about whether the network is too
narrow and lacks capacity. I am pleased that the NH Insurance
Department recently ordered Anthem to do a market conduct exam so we
would finally have some answers. Doctors and hospitals who are impacted
deserve to have a say on the effect Anthem's plan has had on them.
That's why I'm so disappointed that we don't have all the information
we should have today.
"Frisbie Hospital's Chief Executive Officer, Al Felgar, and I jointly
called on Anthem to allow the release of the results of the market
conduct exam so we would all have the results at this hearing.
Unfortunately, Anthem chose not to do so, so the public in the room
today does not have the results.
"I have seen the dedication of so many health professionals, community
advocates, elected officials, and others in the federal government and
in the state government
who are working together on behalf of the
citizens of New Hampshire. I am glad that state legislators are working
to craft new network adequacy regulations, but it is my hope that
Anthem will open its network to make our healthcare law work better for
the newly insured right now."
Bringing Home Competition
As we all know too well, New Hampshire's insurance market has
historically lacked robust competition. That means higher prices and
fewer choices.
We need more competition. That's why during the healthcare debate I
supported an option that would have allowed people to buy into
Medicare, and I was sorry it was not included in the final bill.
When I first heard the news that Anthem would be the only insurer to
offer plans in our Marketplace for 2014, I spoke directly to President
Obama about the need for more competition, especially from companies
that offer wider networks and better access.
In December, I was pleased to announce
that New Hampshire consumers
will have more health insurance options on the Marketplace. Minuteman
Health Inc. has been approved to expand into New Hampshire and form a
new health insurance CO-OP: a nonprofit, member-governed health
insurance company that will offer affordable health care plans to
Granite State families for coverage beginning in 2015. It has expressed
an intention to offer a wide network of hospitals and health care
providers.
Harvard Pilgrim is also expected to offer plans on the Marketplace next
year.
I will keep working to make sure that in New Hampshire, insurers
compete for our business and offer affordable, high-quality choices to
consumers.

Dr.
Barbara
A.
Walters
Dartmouth-Hitchcock
is
one
of
the
first
participants
in
the
Affordable
Care
Act&#8217;s
Pioneer
Accountable
Care
Organizations
project,
which
supports
systems
that
are
working

and
move
away
from
&#8220;fee-for-service&#8221;
systems
to
a
system
that
rewards
quality
instead
of
quantity.
My
office
interviewed
Dr.
Barbara
A.
Walters,
Executive
Medical
Director,
who
is
leading
the
project.
Q:
Why
did
Dartmouth
Hitchcock
decide
to
become
one
of
the
first
Accountable
Care
Organizations
(ACOs)?
A:
The
ACO
program
is
for
organizations
like
Dartmouth-Hitchcock
who
are
interested
in
new
and
novel
ways
of
managing
quality
and
cost
of
populations
of
patients.
One
of
the
things
you
can
do
more
efficiently
is
really
pay
attention
to
care
across
the
continuum
of
care.
So
the
providers
agree
to
take
some
responsibility
for
the
cost
and
quality
of
care,
and
say,
let
us
step
up and
be
part
of
the
solution.
Q:
What
is
it
like
to
be
a
patient
in
an
ACO?
A:
We
might
call
up
patients
before
they
even
think
to
call
us,
and
we
might
say
&#8220;Oh,
Mrs.
Jones,
did
you
know
it&#8217;s
been
a
year
since
your
last
mammogram,
and
our
guidelines
say
that
you
should
have
another
mammogram
this
year.
Would
you
like
to
come
in
and
see
your
doctor?&#8221;
Q:
What
has
patient
feedback
been
like?
A:
Healthcare
can
become
very
complicated,
especially
for
Medicare
patients,
as
people
are
lucky
enough
to
live
longer.
So
patients
really
like
that
their
doctors
and
our
office
team
are
working
to
develop
care
plans,
and
feeling
comfortable
that
they
don&#8217;t
have
to
remember
every
little
thing
that
has
to
be
done.
Q:
What
are
your
plans
moving
forward?
A:
We
want
people
across
New
Hampshire
to
have
access
to
these
kinds
of
programs.

Network
Adequacy
Public
Informational
Hearing,
Concord,
NH
On
February
10th,
the
New
Hampshire
Insurance
Department
held
a
public
forum
to
discuss
network
adequacy.
My
prepared
testimony
was
delivered
by
letter
to
hearing
attendees,
since
I
was
in
D.C.
for
votes.
Here&#8217;s
an
excerpt:
"I
have
been
challenging
Anthem&#8217;s
narrow
network
ever
since
its
details
were
announced.
I
believe
that
Anthem&#8217;s
decision
to
offer
a
narrow
network
was
wrong,
especially
since
this
year,
it
has
a
monopoly
in
the
Marketplace.
"The
newly
insured,
those
who
had
no
insurance
until
they
signed
up
under
the
new
healthcare
law,
are
being
directed
to
a
much
narrower
network
than
those
who
have
employer
based
insurance
or
renewed
their
Anthem
policies
by
December
15,
2013.
"For
a
newly
insured
woman
in
the
Ossipee
area
who
needs
prenatal
care
now,
the
relief
and
happiness
of
finally
having
health
insurance
is
tempered
by
a
longer
drive
to
a
hospital
and
doctor.
"The
public
deserves
information
about
whether
the
network
is
too
narrow
and
lacks
capacity.
I
am
pleased
that
the
NH
Insurance
Department
recently
ordered
Anthem
to
do
a
market
conduct
exam
so
we
would
finally
have
some
answers.
Doctors
and
hospitals
who
are
impacted
deserve
to
have
a
say
on
the
effect
Anthem&#8217;s
plan
has
had
on
them.
That&#8217;s
why
I&#8217;m
so
disappointed
that
we
don&#8217;t
have
all
the
information
we
should
have
today.
"Frisbie
Hospital&#8217;s
Chief
Executive
Officer,
Al
Felgar,
and
I
jointly
called
on
Anthem
to
allow
the
release
of
the
results
of
the
market
conduct
exam
so
we
would
all
have
the
results
at
this
hearing.
Unfortunately,
Anthem
chose
not
to
do
so,
so
the
public
in
the
room
today
does
not
have
the
results.
"I
have
seen
the
dedication
of
so
many
health
professionals,
community
advocates,
elected
officials,
and
others
in
the
federal
government
and
in
the
state
government
who
are
working
together
on
behalf
of
the
citizens
of
New
Hampshire.
I
am
glad
that
state
legislators
are
working
to
craft
new
network
adequacy
regulations,
but
it
is
my
hope
that
Anthem
will
open
its
network
to
make
our
healthcare
law
work
better
for
the
newly
insured
right
now."
Bringing
Home
Competition
As
we
all
know
too
well,
New
Hampshire&#8217;s
insurance
market
has
historically
lacked
robust
competition.
That
means
higher
prices
and
fewer
choices.
We
need
more
competition.
That's
why
during
the
healthcare
debate
I
supported
an
option
that
would
have
allowed
people
to
buy
into
Medicare,
and
I
was
sorry
it
was
not
included
in
the
final
bill.
When
I
first
heard
the
news
that
Anthem
would
be
the
only
insurer
to
offer
plans
in
our
Marketplace
for
2014,
I
spoke
directly
to
President
Obama
about
the
need
for
more
competition,
especially
from
companies
that
offer
wider
networks
and
better
access.
In
December,
I
was
pleased
to
announce
that
New
Hampshire
consumers
will
have
more
health
insurance
options
on
the
Marketplace.
Minuteman
Health
Inc.
has
been
approved
to
expand
into
New
Hampshire
and
form
a
new
health
insurance
CO-OP:
a
nonprofit,
member-governed
health
insurance
company
that
will
offer
affordable
health
care
plans
to
Granite
State
families
for
coverage
beginning
in
2015.
It
has
expressed
an
intention
to
offer
a
wide
network
of
hospitals
and
health
care
providers.
Harvard
Pilgrim
is
also
expected
to
offer
plans
on
the
Marketplace
next
year.
I
will
keep
working
to
make
sure
that
in
New
Hampshire,
insurers
compete
for
our
business

offer
affordable,
high-quality
