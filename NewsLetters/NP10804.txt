Dear Friend,
The board of the Maryland health exchange recently voted to abandon the
state's failed online exchange and to adopt the technology used in
Connecticut's exchange, instead of joining the federal exchange. This
is after Maryland already wasted hundreds of millions of dollars on its
own exchange. I hope that the Department of Health and Human Services
Inspector General's investigators, whom I requested to perform an
investigation, will be able to find out the truth as to how so much of
our tax dollars were wasted.
The board was right to stop throwing away even more taxpayer dollars on
a system that does not work. But going with the Connecticut technology
will still cost Marylanders tens of millions of dollars more-an
estimated $40 million to $50 million more.
And even after requisite testing, there is no assurance the new
platform will work in Maryland, given that our Medicaid system is
somewhat different from Connecticut's and we have a mere six months
till the next open-enrollment period this November. A recent editorial
in The Baltimore Sun surmises that the federal government will pick up
the tab. As if the $200 million-plus federal taxpayer dollars wasted on
Maryland's dysfunctional online exchange wasn't a big enough waste. All
we can hope for at this point is to avoid a situation of "new
technology, same old problems." Will the new Maryland exchange work?
We'll find out in November.
I appeared on national news outlets ahead of the vote to discuss the
fate of the Maryland exchange. Last week, I appeared on Fox News'
America's Newsroom. The interview can be found here
. I was also
interviewed for a story on Fox News' Special Report with Bret Baier,
which also aired last week. You can watch the interview here
. Thank you
for watching!
Also, thank you for your continued energy and enthusiasm, as reflected
in your letters and Facebook posts. If you haven't already, "like" my

Sincerely,

Dear
Friend,
The
board
of
the
Maryland
health
exchange
recently
voted
to
abandon
the
state&#8217;s
failed
online
exchange
and
to
adopt
the
technology
used
in
Connecticut&#8217;s
exchange,
instead
of
joining
the
federal
exchange.
This
is
after
Maryland
already
wasted
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
on
its
own
exchange.
I
hope
that
the
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
Inspector
General&#8217;s
investigators,
whom
I
requested
to
perform
an
investigation,
will
be
able
to
find
out
the
truth
as
to
how
so
much
of
our
tax
dollars
were
wasted.
The
board
was
right
to
stop
throwing
away
even
more
taxpayer
dollars
on
a
system
that
does
not
work.
But
going
with
the
Connecticut
technology
will
still
cost
Marylanders
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
more&#8212;an
estimated
$40
million
to
$50
million
more.
And
even
after
requisite
testing,
there
is
no
assurance
the
new
platform
will
work
in
Maryland,
given
that
our
Medicaid
system
is
somewhat
different
from
Connecticut&#8217;s
and
we
have
a
mere
six
months
till
the
next
open-enrollment
period
this
November.
A
recent
editorial
in
The
Baltimore
Sun
surmises
that
the
federal
government
will
pick
up
the
tab.
As
if
the
$ 200
million-plus
federal
taxpayer
dollars
wasted
on
Maryland&#8217;s
dysfunctional
online
exchange
wasn&#8217;t
a
big
enough
waste.
All
we
can
hope
for
at
this
point
is
to
avoid
a
situation
of
&#8220;new
technology,
same
old
problems.&#8221;
Will
the
new
Maryland
exchange
work?
We&#8217;ll
find
out
in
November.
I
appeared
on
national
news
outlets
ahead
of
the
vote
to
discuss
the
fate
of
the
Maryland
exchange. Last
week,
I
appeared
