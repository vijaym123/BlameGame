Dear Friends,
On Wednesday, the House passed an omnibus bill that funds the federal
government and provides a "fix" to cost of living adjustments (COLA)
for medically retired disabled veterans and survivors. I supported the
bill which passed 359-67. The Senate passed the bill Thursday 72-26.
The bill now heads to the President's desk.
While the omnibus provides a COLA relief for the most vulnerable
members of our veteran community, the medically retired disabled
veterans and survivors, it does not fix COLAs for working-age retirees
who are not disabled. As the legislative process continues this year,
through the National Defense Authorization Act - a bill that funds the
Department of Defense - I will continue to work to restore the previous
COLA levels for our men and women who served their country.
On a separate, but just as important note, U.S. Secretary of
Agriculture Tom Vilsack announced Wednesday federal relief for 22
counties in southwest Texas affected by drought.
Our farmers and ranchers have been hit by a terrible drought in Texas.
Now, these businessmen and women can seek help and protect their farms
and ranchlands through an emergency loan. I will continue to work with
Secretary Vilsack, and the House Agriculture Committee to make
resources available.
To learn which counties were designated, go to my website,
www.gallego.house.gov.
FSA considers each emergency loan application on its own merits, taking
into account the extent of production losses on the farm, and the
security and repayment ability of the farmer. Those affected by the
drought can apply for loans from the Farm Service Agency at
www.fsa.usda.gov.
Thank you for allowing me to represent and work for you. If I can be of
assistance, please contact any of our offices. The addresses and phone
numbers are below.
Sincerely,
Pete P. Gallego

Dear

On
