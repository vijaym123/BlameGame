This morning, we found out that Doug Ose just gave another $15O,OOO to his campaign for the last two days of this election.
That&rsquo;s his third loan in the last 10 days!!
Ose wouldn&rsquo;t keep pouring his own fortune into his campaign if our race wasn&rsquo;t a DEAD HEAT.
Folks, we can win this thing -- but we can&rsquo;t overcome Ose&rsquo;s millions without your grassroots support.
We&rsquo;ve got 48 HOURS to go. We know we can do it -- and win this for Ami -- but we need you right now. Are you in?
