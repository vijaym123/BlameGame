Dear Friend,
On Veterans Day, we paid tribute to all those who have worn the uniform
of our country and put their lives on the line to defend our freedom
and way of life.
As we continue to welcome home the brave men and
women who have been serving our nation faithfully in Afghanistan - and
those who returned from Iraq - let us rededicate ourselves to the work
of helping them transition back to civilian life. We must ensure that
they have access to the care they need to heal the physical and
psychological wounds of war, and create jobs that will help them secure
their place in a strong and growing middle class.
In this issue, I will be providing information on resources for
veterans, methods to stay better connected with my office and federal
investments in our community. Also, included is an update on key
initiatives in my legislative portfolio and opportunities for grants
and essay contests.
I hope that you will find this information useful. As always, please
feel free to contact my district office if you ever have any questions
or concerns at (619) 422-5963 or (760) 355-8800.
Sincerely,
JUAN VARGAS
Member of Congress
51st District, California

Rep. Vargas Awards the 2013 Veteran of the Year to Imperial County
Resident Lee Quarcelino
Rep. Vargas presents Lee Quarcelino and his wife Theresa with a
proclamation in honor of his service to our country.
It is always an honor to recognize those who have served our nation
with courage and distinction.
As we commemorate Veterans Day this
month, I had the privilege to name Lee Quarcelino as the "Veteran of
the Year" for California's 51st Congressional District.
Lee was born on September 22, 1947 in Owensboro, Kentucky and raised in
Clinton, Missouri, where he graduated from high school in 1965. Lee
attended Central Missouri State College, was subsequently drafted into
the U.S. Army, and later signed up for the U.S. Navy in 1966, during
the Vietnam Era. After completing boot camp, he was transferred to the
Naval Air Station Cubi Point in the Philippines where he was a military
police officer. He was then assigned to temporary active duty to the
Master-at-Arms in Da Nang, Vietnam, during which he escorted military
prisoners to the Philippines for transport back to the U.S.A. He spent
his last 8 months in the Navy stationed on the USS Bainbridge. Lee
retired from Peabody Coal as a manager after working there for 33
years. He later spent 10 years at the US Fish and Wildlife Service and
is currently working as Duty Supervisor at his local elementary school
district.
Lee uses his experiences as a veteran to serve in the Veterans
Employment Council as Veterans Advisor for Ryan Kelly of the Imperial
County Board of Supervisors. Lee is currently the Vice Commander for
the American Legion Department of California representing Area 5, and
District 22 Commander for the Veterans of Foreign Wars. He serves on
the Veterans Advisory Committee, the Employment Development Department's
Veterans Employment Committee, and organizes an annual Veterans Day
celebration at the veterans memorial wall in his current hometown of
Brawley, CA.
I would like to thank Lee for his continued service to our country and
for his outstanding dedication and accomplishments in the veterans
community.

Veteran Resources
On Veterans Day, we recognized the sacrifices made by over twenty-two
million living Americans who have distinguished themselves by their
service in uniform. Their devotion and sacrifice are the bedrock of our
sovereignty as a Nation, our values as a people, our security as a
democracy, and our offer of hope to those in other lands, who dream of
the freedoms we enjoy.
Below are resources provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
to ensure that our nation's veterans receive the quality medical care,
benefits, and memorial services they have dutifully earned.
VA offers benefits that can improve the lives of veterans and their
families. Some benefits may also be available to active-duty service
members. Explore VA to learn about such topics as disability
compensation, education and employment services, health care, home
loans, and memorial benefits. Veterans can also sign up to receive VA
updates and apply for benefits online.
www.va.gov/explore
The professionals at the veterans Crisis Line are trained and
experienced in helping veterans of all ages and circumstances. Many of
the responders are Veterans themselves and understand what veterans and
their families and friends have been through and the challenges
veterans of all ages and service eras face.
Veterans and their loved ones can call 1-800-273-8255 and PRESS 1, chat
online, or send a text message to 838255 to receive confidential
support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365days a year.
www.veteranscrisisline.net
VA is committed to ending veteran homelessness by the end of 2015. No
one who has served our country should ever go without a safe, stable
place to call home. Learn about VA's programs for veterans and find out
what you, your neighbors, and your community can do to help veterans
who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.
Know that one phone call can be the difference in the life of a veteran
who is homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. Make the call to
877-4AID-VET (424-3838) to be connected 24/7 with VA's services to
overcome or prevent homelessness for yourself or a veteran you know.
www.va.gov/homeless
VA administers a variety of education benefit programs. Through these
programs, veterans can pursue a college degree, on-the-job training,
apprenticeships, and non-college degree programs. Many Veterans and
active duty personnel can qualify for more than one education benefits
program. Learn more about the Post-9/11 GI Bill and other programs and
help a Veteran determine which program best fits their needs.
www.gibill.va.gov
VA has many resources available for veterans and family members. See
our locations listings by state to find your nearest VHA,VBA, and NCA
facilities. The map also provides locations for PTSD Programs, Vet
Centers, and Substance Use Disorder Programs.

VA is working hard to let women veterans know about the benefits and
services for which they may be eligible. The Department offers women
veterans a full range of comprehensive primary care. Women can receive
care tailored to their needs with gender-specific health care, mental
health care, military sexual trauma related care, and more.
www.va.gov/womenvet
Geriatrics and Extended Care provides services for veterans who are
elderly and have complex needs, and veterans of any age who need daily
support and assistance. Veterans can receive care at home, at VA
medical centers or in the community.
www.va.gov/geriatrics
The mission of ORH is to improve access and quality of care for
enrolled rural and highly rural veterans by developing evidence-based
policies and innovative practices to support the unique needs of
enrolled Veterans residing in geographically remote areas. Currently,
3.1 million rural veterans are enrolled in the VA system. This
represents 36% of the total enrolled Veteran population based on the
2010 US Census.

Hazel's Law
Earlier this year, I had the honor to introduce my first piece of
legislation, "The Child Protection Act of 2013", also known as Hazel's
Law.The bill, named after Hazel, is based on a San Diego case which was
delayed while the prosecution struggled to prove the trafficker knew
his victim was a minor.
Currently, if a trafficker does not cross
state lines, it falls on the prosecution to gather sufficient evidence
proving that the trafficker knew the age of the victim,. This is
extraordinarily difficult task since those forced into sexual slavery
are frequently scared to confront their traffickers.
Removing the
knowledge of age requirement would better reflect the strict liability
included in other established criminal statutes involving child
exploitation.
The trafficking and sexual exploitation of children continues to be a
growing epidemic. Human sex trafficking is the fastest-growing business
of organized crime and the third-largest criminal enterprise in the
world. The global market of child trafficking is more than $12 billion
per year with over 1.2 million child victims. In the United States
alone, an estimated 300,000 children are at risk each year for
commercial sexual exploitation. Approximately 80% of human trafficking
victims are women and nearly half are minors. Nearly 2.8 million
children run away each year in the United States. The average age of
entry for children victimized by the sex trade industry is only
12-years-old.
Do you think prosecutors should have to prove that child sex
traffickers knew that their victim was a minor?
Yes
No

Medicare Open Enrollment
Fall Open Enrollment is the time of year when you can change your
Medicare coverage. You can do this by joining a new Medicare Advantage
plan or by joining a new stand-alone prescription drug plan. You can
also return to Original Medicare with or without a stand-alone Part D
plan from a Medicare Advantage plan during this time.
People with Medicare can call 1-800-MEDICARE or visit www.medicare.gov
for plan information. If you are satisfied that your current
plan will meet your needs for next year, you don't need to do anything.

San Diego Center for Civic Engagement and U.S. EPA Award $45,000 in
Grants for New Park Space Along the U.S./Mexico Border
The San Diego Center for Civic Engagement's Opening the Outdoors
initiative and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA)
U.S.-Mexico Border 2020 Program this month awarded $45,000 to the
nonprofit group 4Walls International for the construction of a
bi-national park space that will use trash pulled from the Tijuana
River Valley and tributary canyons as building materials.
The re-purposed trash might have otherwise entered the Tijuana River,
negatively impacting the fragile ecosystem of the Tijuana River
National Estuarine Research Reserve in San Diego. This unique
bi-national collaboration will create a gateway to the rich shared
cultural and natural resources of the U.S.-Mexico Border.
Approximately half of the funds will be used by 4Walls International to
create park space and a nature reserve in a canyon in Tijuana just
south of the border fence known as "Los Sauces." The park will make use
of thousands of discarded plastic soda bottles stuffed with trash as
fill material for the construction of park benches and other
infrastructure. This innovative construction technique reduces the cost
of raw materials, such as cement, while increasing the structures'
strength.
On the U.S. side, 4Walls International will create an inviting,
culturally relevant "Border Gateway to Nature" by improving signage and
access points to the park, and by creating artistic elements and park
benches made of trash collected from the Tijuana River Estuary. The
Border Field State Park improvements were completed last month.
Mexico's Environment Ministry (SEMARNAT) is also contributing
significant resources to the beautification of Los Sauces Park. Through
the "Temporary Employment Program," SEMARNAT is employing approximately
100 local residents for 12 weeks to clean the park and replace invasive
vegetation with native plants. Phase one of the Los Sauces Park in
Tijuana was completed in September.
The Opening the Outdoors initiative at the San Diego Center for Civic
Engagement will help reclaim the region's natural beauty and create
world-class urban parks and gateways to nature. The initiative seeks to
bring together business, government, and the community to build public
awareness and support efforts to establish natural and urban spaces for
families to recreate, learn and enjoy. This is the first project of the
Opening the Outdoors initiative.
This project is also part of a broader effort under the U.S.-Mexico
Border 2020 Environment Program to improve bi-national watersheds and
the environment. Border 2020 is the latest environmental program
implemented under the 1983 La Paz Agreement.
The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Awarded the
International Rescue Committee a $250,000 Integration Grant
The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services has recently
awarded the International Rescue Committee (IRC) a competitive
Integration Grant in the amount of $250,000. Through this grant
program, 40 organizations will gain resources to support lawful
permanent residents in the naturalization process. Grant recipients are
located in 21 states and will serve more than 20,000 individuals from
countries around the world. IRC will use this award to expand the range
of citizenship preparation services available to lawful permanent
residents in order to help these individuals achieve their aim of
becoming U.S. citizens.

Currently,
3.1
million

Hazel's
Law
Earlier
this
year,
I
had
the
honor
to
introduce
my
first
piece
of
legislation,
&#8220;The
Child
Protection
Act
of
2013&#8221;,
also
known
as
Hazel&#8217;s
Law. The
bill,
named
after
Hazel,
is
based
on
a
San
Diego
case
which
was
delayed
while
the
prosecution
struggled
to
prove
the
trafficker
knew
his
victim
was
a
minor.
Currently,
if
a
trafficker
does
not
cross
state
lines,
it
falls
on
the
prosecution
to
gather
sufficient
evidence
proving
that
the
trafficker
knew
the
age
of
the
victim,.
This
is
extraordinarily
difficult
task
since
those
forced
into
sexual
slavery
are
frequently
scared
to
confront
their
traffickers.
Removing
the
knowledge
of
age
requirement
would
better
reflect
the
strict
liability
included
in
other
established
criminal
statutes
involving
child
exploitation.
The
trafficking
and
sexual
exploitation
of
children
continues
to
be
a
growing
epidemic.
Human
sex
trafficking
is
the
fastest-growing
business
of
organized
crime
and
the
third-largest
criminal
enterprise
in
the
world.
The
global
market
of
child
trafficking
is
more
than
$12
billion
per
year
with
over
1.2
million
child
victims.
In
the
United
States
alone,
an
estimated
300,000
children
are
at
risk
each
year
for
commercial
sexual
exploitation. Approximately
80%
of
human
trafficking
victims
are
women
and
nearly
half
are
minors. Nearly
2.8
million
children
run
away
each
year
in
the
United
States.
The
average
age
of
entry
for
children
victimized
by
the
sex
trade
industry
is
only
12-years-old.
Do you think prosecutors should have to prove that child sex traffickers knew that their victim was a minor?

initiative
and
the
U.S.
Environmental
Protection
Agency&#8217;s
(EPA)
U.S.-Mexico
Border
2020
Program
this
month
awarded
$45,000
to
the
nonprofit
group
4Walls
International
for
the
construction
of
a
bi-national
park
space
that
will
use
trash
pulled
from
the
Tijuana
River
Valley
and
tributary
canyons
as
building
materials.
The
re-purposed
trash
might
have
otherwise
entered
the
Tijuana
River,
negatively
impacting
the
fragile
ecosystem
of
the
Tijuana
River
National
Estuarine
Research
Reserve
in
San
Diego.
This
unique
bi-national
collaboration
will
create
a
gateway
to
the
rich
shared
cultural
and
natural
resources
of
the
U.S.-Mexico
Border.
Approximately
half
of
the
funds
will
be
used
by
4Walls
International to
create
park
space
and
a
nature
reserve
in
a
canyon
in
Tijuana
just
south
of
the
border
fence
known
as
&#8220;Los
Sauces.&#8221;
The
park
will
make
use
of
thousands
of
discarded
plastic
soda
bottles
stuffed
with
trash
as
fill
material
for
the
construction
of
park
benches
and
other
infrastructure.
This
innovative
construction
technique
reduces
the
cost
of
raw
materials,
such
as
cement,
while
increasing
the
structures&#8217;
strength.
On
the
U.S.
side,
4Walls
International
will
create
an
inviting,
culturally
relevant
&#8220;Border
Gateway
to
Nature&#8221;
by
improving
signage
and
access
points
to
the
park,
and
by
creating
artistic
elements
and
park
benches
made
of
trash
collected
from
the
Tijuana
River
Estuary.
The
Border
Field
State
Park
improvements
were
completed
last
month.
Mexico&#8217;s
Environment
Ministry
(SEMARNAT)
is
also
contributing
significant
resources
to
the
beautification
of
Los
Sauces
Park.
Through
the
&#8220;Temporary
Employment
Program,&#8221;
SEMARNAT
is
employing
approximately
100
local
residents
for
12
weeks
to
clean
the
park
and
replace
invasive
vegetation
with
native
plants.
Phase
one
of
the
Los
Sauces
Park
in
Tijuana was completed
in
September.
The
Opening
the
Outdoors
initiative
at
the
San
Diego
Center
for
Civic
Engagement
will
help
reclaim
the
region&#8217;s
natural
beauty
and
create
world-class
urban
parks
and
gateways
to
nature.
The
initiative
seeks
to
bring
together
business,
government,
and
the
community
to
build
public
awareness
and
support
efforts
to
establish
natural
and
urban
spaces
for
families
to
recreate,
learn
and
enjoy.
This
is
the
first
project
of
the
Opening
the
Outdoors
initiative.
This
project
is
also
part
of
a
broader
effort
under
the
U.S.-Mexico
Border
2020
Environment
Program
to
improve
bi-national
watersheds
and
the
environment.
Border
2020
