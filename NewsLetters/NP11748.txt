Dear Friend,
With tax day just six weeks away, I wanted to let you know about a
great free filing service available right now on the IRS website.
It's called Free File, and all taxpayers can use it at no cost.
This is a free public service that offers federal tax preparation and
e-file options for all taxpayers. Free File is made possible through a
public-private partnership between the IRS and Free File Alliance, a
coalition of industry-leading tax software companies.
This service aims to make the tax filing process quicker and simpler,
and has saved taxpayers an estimated $1.2 billion in filing costs over
the past 10 years.
If your income was $58,000 or less in 2013, you are eligible to use
Free File's easy filing software to prepare and e-file your federal tax
returns. They also offer a basic federal e-filing service with no
income limitations, so anyone can use their online fillable forms at no
cost.
Click here to learn more about Free File, and to get started on your
tax return today.
Also, if you make $52,000 or less and need assistance preparing your
tax returns you can visit the IRS website to find a location for the
IRS Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program near you. If you qualify,
IRS-certified volunteers can provide free basic tax return preparation
with electronic filing. These volunteers can also let you know if you
qualify for any special tax credits. Visit the IRS website to find a
VITA site near you:
