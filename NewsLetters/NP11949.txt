Dear Friends,
As
the widespread protests continue and more peaceful Venezuelans fall
victim to the forces of oppression, the U.S. and responsible nations
must stand in solidarity with the freedom seekers and pro-democracy
advocates of Venezuela.
They have taken to the streets to demand
an end to Nicols Maduros anti-democratic measures and his failed
economic policies that have caused a shortage of basic necessities, like
bread, electricity and more, despite the vast oil wealth that the
nation has.
But the harshest shortage is democracy. These unarmed
freedom seekers have predictably been met by the heavy hand of
Maduros state thugs, as the Venezuelan forces have responded with violence.
Maduro remains intransigent and vows to continue to unleash the
National Guard on these unarmed protesters under the false pretense of
protecting the people of Venezuela. Montesquieu said that there is no
crueler tyranny than that which is perpetrated under the shield of law and
in the name of justice, and that is what we see with Maduro in
Venezuela.
There have been over a dozen deaths, a high number of
arrests
including that of one of the most vocal critics of Maduro,
Leopoldo Lopez, who turned himself in even though he is facing serious
trumped up charges.
His case caused Amnesty International to
condemn Maduro, saying that the charges against Leopoldo were
politically motivated and an attempt to silence dissent in Venezuela.
I
hope my colleagues in the Congress are as vocal and engaged on the
crisis in Venezuela as they have been on the problem in Ukraine. It is
vitally important to highlight the democratic struggles of the people
of Venezuela, where over a dozen pro-democracy advocates have been
killed in the past weeks as Maduro unleashes his thugs in an effort to
silence the masses.
The people of Venezuela deserve better than
Maduros abuse of power, his corruption, and his anti-democratic
measures and they are pleading for help, looking to the world
turning to
the United States - to speak out against these injustices and to help
them as they fight for their fundamental rights.
This is why
I have introduced H. Res 488 a resolution that says to the people of
Venezuela, to Maduro and to the world that the United States stands on
the side of those who seek liberty and democracy in Venezuela and that
we will not remain silent while these abuses persist. This resolution
also deplores the inexcusable use of violence against opposition
leaders and the protesters
many of whom are just students
and the use
of intimidation to try to silence dissent.
House Resolution
488 also urges responsible nations to not sit quietly on the sidelines,
but to instead stand with them in solidarity with the people of
Venezuela and to actively encourage a process of dialogue to end the
violence.
We must stand together in support of freedom, in support
of peace, in support of nonviolence, and in support of those seeking a
peaceful, democratic process in Venezuela.
Sincerely,
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
Member of
Congress
