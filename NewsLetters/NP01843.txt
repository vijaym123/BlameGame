Wisdom of the District: Defense Spending
This week the House of Representatives considered a budget for the next fiscal year.
Fiscal conservatives like Congressman Scott Rigell have advocated for a spending plan that balances our nations expenses with our income, just like American families do, while fully protecting the nation.
However, right now America spends far more than it takes in, a trend that has created unsustainable debt, sort of like a family that keeps adding to its credit card debt without any plan to pay it down.
That puts a squeeze on how much we can spend on things like education, defense, and even roads.
As you know, across-the-board cuts will hit the defense community this September if Congress and the President do not act.
What do you think is the best way to move forward?
( )
Congress should increase defense spending even if it increases the debt.
( )
Congress should only increase defense spending if it can find a way to reduce spending.
( )
Congress should find a compromise to address this issue that includes a way to move towards a balanced budget that also addresses the debt.
( )
I dont know or I have another answer .
