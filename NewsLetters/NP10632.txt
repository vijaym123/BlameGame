Dear Friend,
As a member of the House Judiciary Committee, this week I participated in an oversight hearing for the United States Department of Justice. Attorney General Eric Holder testified before the committee about a variety of issues. When my turn came to question Attorney General Holder, I asked him if states do not have to comply with federal drug laws, why should they have to comply with ObamaCare? Unfortunately the Attorney General deflected my question.
The Obama&#45;Holder Justice Department does not have the authority to pick and choose which laws they want to enforce. The Constitution is clear &#45; Congress has the duty to write laws and, once they are enacted, it is the executive branch&#39;s responsibility to enforce the laws. Article II, section 3 of the U.S. Constitution declares that the executive &#34;shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.&#34; However, President Obama and Attorney General Holder have failed on multiple occasions to enforce acts of Congress that he disagrees with.
Judiciary Committee members pressed Attorney General Holder on his refusal to enforce federal immigration laws. The Attorney General was asked about his failure to enforce federal drug laws. Committee members asked the Attorney General about the legality of delaying the ObamaCare individual mandate for special interests. And finally, the Attorney General was asked about the Obama Administration ignoring welfare work requirements, a clear violation of the 1996 welfare reform law.
Just last month, the House of Representatives passed the
Executive Needs to Faithfully Observe and Respect Congressional Enactments of the Law Act
or
ENFORCE the Law Act
to restore balance to the separation of powers outlined in the Constitution. The
ENFORCE the Law Act
allows the House or the Senate to authorize a lawsuit against the Executive Branch for failure to execute the laws. The House also passed the
Faithful Execution of the Law Act
to strengthen current laws and to ensure that all federal executive officials fully execute the laws on the books. The
Faithful Execution of the Law Act
promotes transparency and honesty by requiring all federal executive officials who are not enforcing federal law to report to Congress on their reasoning for non&#45;enforcement.
The Obama&#45;Holder Justice Department has failed time and time again to uphold Article II, section 3 of the U.S. Constitution that says the executive &#34;shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.&#34; I remain committed to working with my colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee to hold Attorney General Holder accountable and restore the balance of power outlined in the Constitution.
EIGHTH ANNUAL CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT ART CONTEST
The Congressional Art Contest is a great way to recognize talented high school students in our Eighth Congressional District.

We hope to have participation from schools across our district. I encourage anyone who is interested in participating in the contest to contact my office.

THIS WEEK&#39;S HIGHLIGHTS
On Thursday, I honored the life and service of Sgt. Timothy Owens with a speech on the House floor. Sgt. Owens lived in Rolla and was killed in the senseless act of violence at Fort Hood last week. Please join me in honoring Sgt. Owens and lifting his family and friends up in prayer.

Tuesday I spoke to 500 rural broadband advocates at the NTCA Legislative & Policy Conference. Expanding opportunities through rural broadband investments will help schools, small businesses and families connect to the world. In addition to advocates from across the country, I was able to visit with folks from Steelville and Bernie.
Wednesday I met with a great group of 8th graders from Trinity Lutheran in Cape Girardeau. I talked to the students about my work in the House of Representatives and then my staff gave them a tour of the Capitol building.
Sincerely,
Jason Smith
Member of Congress
