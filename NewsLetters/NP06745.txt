important (don't delete)
I&rsquo;ve already emailed you this month. I&rsquo;m emailing you again because this is important.
Take 30 seconds to read this:
-- Republican outside groups are outspending us nearly 3-to-1.
-- That&rsquo;s nearly 3 times as many resources attacking our Democratic candidates.
-- The most important fundraising deadline we&rsquo;ve faced is in just 48 hours.
David, I don&rsquo;t want to lose this election because we didn&rsquo;t fight Republican attacks when we had the chance. We&rsquo;re down to our last 48 hours. If you can be one of the 15 people we need from the 60659 zip code before the fundraising deadline, please chip in what you can today. ALL GIFTS TODAY TRIPLE-MATCHED! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
Barack Obama
