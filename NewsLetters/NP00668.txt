Remembering those who served and sacrificed
Dear Friend,
As we join with friends and family this weekend to enjoy some much-deserved warmer weather, we must also pause to reflect on those brave American service members who made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms and for our nation.
Nearly 150 years ago a proclamation was issued by an organization of Union Civil War veterans to honor and decorate the graves of fellow Union soldiers killed during the Civil War. Now celebrated on the last Monday of May, Memorial Day is an occasion to remember American soldiers and service members of all wars who perished while serving our country and to honor the many sacrifices made by them and their families.
Just as important to remember are the sacrifices continued to be made by our troops today. They and their families continue to give so much for our country. We look forward to their safe return home and we keep their families in our thoughts as well.
Just this week in the House of Representatives we advanced
six bipartisan bills
that help our brave veterans and their families make the adjustment from military life to civilian life. Votes to help vets and their families are consistently the easiest ones I make and I always aim to work in a bipartisan manner with my colleagues in order to ensure our veterans and their families receive the quality support, care, and benefits they have rightfully earned.
Those service members who serve our country so bravely to preserve our freedoms and liberties were not only soldiers
they were mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters.
And when our country needed them most, they answered the call.
On Monday, we pay our respects to the many generations of heroes who sacrificed their tomorrows so that we may enjoy our freedoms today. We are all so proud of their service and sacrifice and we say thank you.
If you are a veteran or are a family member of a veteran in need of assistance, please contact my Kalamazoo District Office (269-385-0039) to speak to one of my dedicated veteran caseworkers.
God Bless,
-Fred
