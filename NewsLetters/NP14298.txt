ICYMI: Heller Shares Nevadans
Obamacare Stories
(Washington, D.C.)
Yesterday, on the Senate floor, U.S.
Senator Dean Heller (R-NV) shared stories
he has received from Nevadans whose
healthcare costs are rising, or whose plans
have been cancelled under ObamaCare.
Hellers speech centers on President
Obamas promise to the American
people that if they liked their health
insurance plan, they could keep their
health insurance plan.

Last week, Heller cosponsored the
If You Like Your Health
Plan, You Can Keep It Act
(S.1617)
introduced by Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI),
which allows Americans to keep their
current health insurance plan.
Excerpts from the speech below:
Weve all heard from the
laws supporters that ObamaCare would
give uninsured Americans access to health
insurance. Time and time again, they
promised that people who already had a
health plan they liked could keep it.
In fact, President Obama made
that exact promise on numerous
occasions.
But one of my constituents sent
me a letter last week telling me that
wasnt the case. Sunny from the Las
Vegas area wrote I wanted to tell
you that we have lost our wonderful health
insurance plan. Sunnys family
received a letter from their insurance
company telling them that their existing
plan didnt qualify under the
Affordable Care Act. They were
automatically reassigned to a new plan that
costs about $400 more per month.
But yet another one of my
constituents, Kirk from northern Nevada,
was just notified that his current health
insurance has been cancelled. He went to
the exchange to find a new policy and
shared his story with me. He wrote,
despite higher deductibles
and higher co-pays, my new insurance under
this devastating law will be more than 250%
of what I am paying now.
Marc received a letter telling
him that his current plan is no longer
offered. The plan, the letter detailed, was
cancelled in order to meet the
requirements of the new laws.
Marc was given the option to keep his plan
for one additional year if he accepts a
rate increase, even though he just saw a
rate increase in September.
I think Steven from Washoe County
would likely take issue with that
promise. He told me that he now has
health care that costs $293 per month.
However, he just received a letter from his
health care provider informing him that the
cost of his health care will increase to
$546 per month on January 1st. That means
health insurance costs will nearly double
next year. Theres nothing affordable
about that. Theres nothing secure
about that.
I have a letter here from a
father from Reno. He writes,
Im writing you to tell you
that Im now eating crow. A few weeks
back I wrote to you and expressed my
support for health reform and my
dissatisfaction with the government
shutdown. Since then, Ive received
notification from my insurance company
informing me that my current policy is
being discontinued. I then began shopping
for new policies for myself and family and
have found that rates are two to three
times of what Im currently paying
and that my max out of pocket will double,
all for basically the same plan as what I
have now. In essence, Ive been put
into a situation where I can either save
for my kids college education or buy
healthcare.
These stories dont fit
with the narrative weve heard for
nearly five years. Now, President Obama is
trying to backtrack on the dozens of times
he made his promise to the American
people.
These personal stories are why
Im proud to cosponsor the If
You Like Your Health Plan, You Can Keep It
Act, introduced by my colleague,
Senator Johnson from Wisconsin. This is a
simple, but necessary, bill to give
Americans the ability to keep their health
plans if they like them. The people of
Nevada deserve better, and they deserve to
have a government that keeps its
promises.
