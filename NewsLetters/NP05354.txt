Veterans Job Training Initiative
We owe our veterans and their families not just our thanks, but our
commitment to assisting their transition from military service back
into the civilian workplace.
I am proud to focus on easing that
transition by launching my Veterans Job Training Initiative to provide
a series of events including workshops, information on available
resources, and job fairs all over the state.
I encourage any South Carolinian veteran looking to explore new
employment opportunities and grow their skills to attend one of the
workshops or one of the job and resource fairs in the coming months.
Information on the first workshop, "Transferring Military Skills and
Certifications to the Civilian World," is below.

Ebola Travel Restrictions
First and foremost, my heart goes out to those infected with Ebola and
their families both in the United States and in West Africa. This is a
terrible virus, and one the world must work together to stop.
As infections continue to spread here in the United States, the trust
of the American people has been shaken by the administration's response
thus far. It is clear that a temporary travel ban for foreign nationals
traveling from Ebola-stricken nations in West Africa should be put in
place. The President has the authority to do so, and we have seen that
airport screenings and self-reporting simply are not enough.
While both the Centers for Disease Control and National Institutes of
Health state that patients without a fever are not contagious, recent
studies from West Africa show that almost 13 percent of confirmed cases
did not present with a fever. Screenings have also only been initiated
at five airports, and even at airports travelers' symptoms can be
masked by over-the-counter medications.
This is about the safety of the American people, and nothing more. As
the fight against Ebola continues, a temporary travel ban for foreign
nationals traveling from the epicenter of the outbreak is a necessity.
Yucca Mountain: Safe for a Million Years
Earlier this week, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a report
stating that Yucca Mountain is a repository for nuclear waste that will
be safe for up to one million years. It is time to move forward on
Yucca Mountain - the safest, most viable location for storing our
nation's nuclear waste. South Carolina has agreed to temporarily hold
some of this material, but we need a long-term strategy.
Our state alone has contributed more than a billion dollars towards
this project. Yucca Mountain is the law of the land and the U.S. needs
a permanent repository that will be safe for up to a million years--the
administration cannot continue to ignore existing law. It is well
beyond time to move forward.
I have enjoyed visiting with folks in Charleston, Hanahan, Anderson,
and Columbia this week-I look forward meeting more people out and about
in the great state of South Carolina! I am honored to serve as your
representative in the United States Senate.
Please do not hesitate to
contact my office at (843) 727-4525 with any questions, concerns, or
suggestions that you may have.
Sincerely,
Tim

Ebola
Travel
Restrictions
First
and
foremost,
my
heart
goes
out
to
those
infected
with
Ebola
and
their
families
both
in
the
United
States
and
in
West
Africa.
This
is
a
terrible
virus,
and
one
the
world
must
work
together
to
stop.
As
infections
continue
to
spread
here
in
the
United
States,
the
trust
of
the
American
people
has
been
shaken
by
the
administration&#8217;s
response
thus
far.
It
is
clear
that
a
temporary
travel
ban
for
foreign
nationals
traveling
from
Ebola-stricken
nations
in
West
Africa
should
be
put
in
place.
The
President
has
the
authority
to
do
so,
and
we
have
seen
that
airport
screenings
and
self-reporting
simply
are
not
enough.
While
both
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
National
Institutes
of
Health
state
that
patients
without
a
fever
are
not
contagious,
recent
studies
from
West
Africa
show
that
almost
13
percent
of
confirmed
cases
did
not
present
with
a
fever.
Screenings
have
also
only
been
initiated
at
five
airports,
and
even
at
airports
travelers&#8217;
symptoms
can
be
masked
by
over-the-counter
medications.
This
is
about
the
safety
of
the
American
people,
and
nothing
more.
As
the
fight
against
Ebola
continues,
a
temporary
travel
ban
for
foreign
nationals
traveling
from
the
epicenter
of
the
outbreak
is
a
necessity.
Yucca
Mountain:
Safe
for
a
Million
Years
Earlier
this
week,
the
Nuclear
Regulatory
Commission
issued
a
report
stating
that
Yucca
Mountain
is
a
repository
for
nuclear
waste
that
will
be
safe
for
up
to
one
million
years.
It
is
time
to
move
forward
on
Yucca
Mountain
-
the
safest,
most
viable
location
for
storing
our
nation's
nuclear
waste.
South
Carolina
has
agreed
to
temporarily
hold
some
of
this
material,
but
we
need
a
long-term
strategy.
Our
state
alone
has
contributed
more
than
a
billion
dollars
towards
this
project.
Yucca
Mountain
is
the
law
of
the
land
and
the
U.S.
needs
a
permanent
repository
that
will
be
safe
for
up
to
a
million
years--the
administration
cannot
continue
to
ignore
existing
law.
It
is
well
beyond
time
to
move
forward.
I
have
enjoyed
visiting
with
folks
in
Charleston,
Hanahan,
Anderson,
and
Columbia
this
week&#8212;I
look
forward
meeting
more
people
out
and
about
in
the
great
state
of
South
Carolina!
I
am
honored
to
serve
as
your
representative
in
the
United
States
Senate.
Please
do
not
hesitate
to
contact
my
office
at
(843)
727-4525
with
any
questions,
concerns,
or
suggestions
that
you
may
have.
