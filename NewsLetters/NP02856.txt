PRESS RELEASE
From the Hampton Roads Chamber of Commerce:
Elected, Business, Labor and Community Leaders to Host Open Discussion for Offshore Energy Exploration and Development TOMORROW
WHAT:
The Hampton Roads Chamber of Commerce will host a press conference regarding offshore energy exploration off Virginias coast.
Immediately following the press conference, the public is invited to make their comments as a part of the open discussion period associated with a recently announced U.S. Interior Department five-year strategy for oil and gas leasing from 2017-2022.
The draft plan includes an area of the Outer Continental Shelf off the Virginia coast.
Bipartisan support exists for offshore energy exploration and energy harvesting in Virginia waters.
The states Republican-led General Assembly has endorsed offshore activities as have some members of the Commonwealths congressional delegation, including U.S. Representative Scott Rigell of Virginia Beach.
Additional support comes from Governor Terry McAuliffe and Virginias Democratic U.S. Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine.
Elected officials insist that the Commonwealth share in the offshore royalties.
Broad-based regional support from the community is growing in part because of the possibility of significant job creation and revenue generation.
This exploration opportunity also could mean energy independence with the establishment of this region becoming the energy capital of the east coast. While the Chamber is excited by the potential economic impact this opportunity presents, it must be stressed we support due diligence to protect the environment, military readiness and other industry.
WHO:
Hampton Roads Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Bryan K. Stephens will be joined at the event by:
-Barry DuVal, President &amp; CEO, Virginia Chamber of Commerce
-Brett Vassey, Manufacturer
-Bruce Williams, a noted community leader
-Tommy Bell, Ironworkers Local Union #79 and the Virginia State Building and Construction Trade
WHEN:
Wednesday, February 11, 2015
2:30 P.M. - Press conference followed by public comment period
**We encourage participants to arrive at 2:00pm**
