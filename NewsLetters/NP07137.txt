Dear Friend,
The concepts of freedom and
equality are foundations of our country.
Throughout our
nations history, there has been tremendous personal sacrifice made to
preserve and expand these ideals.
Here in Utah, many of our ancestors
traveled great distances and showed immense bravery in the name of
freedom.
You may not know that this summer commemorates the
50 th
anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, a seminal piece of
legislation in the quest for freedom and equality in our country.
Specifically the Act outlaws discrimination based on race, color,
religion, sex, or national origin.
For many of us, including me,
it is impossible to remember a time when this landmark bill was not a
part of the fabric of our country.
Many events led up to the
passage of the Civil Rights Act, including the work of the Freedom
Riders, civil rights activists who traveled to the segregated South, to
promote integration and voting rights.
I traveled to Mississippi
and Alabama this spring as part of a delegation recognizing the
exceptional work of the Freedom Riders, following their travels and paying
respect to their sacrifices.
It was a tremendously powerful
experience for me, and an important reminder of how individual citizens
can affect change and work to combat injustice.
I was proud to
share this experience with colleagues from both sides of the aisle,
including Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights hero who marched with Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr.
Unfortunately, the work of
promoting and protecting equality is never finished.
Following
Supreme Court decisions about congressional boundaries and redistricting,
Congress needs to update and amend the Voting Rights Act.
This
legislation ensures that every American is afforded their voice in
government, and making certain through judicial oversight that there
cannot be deliberate attempts made to disenfranchise any group of
individuals.
I am proud to have joined my colleagues from both sides of
the aisle on a bill,
HR 3899
- a bipartisan plan
that strengthens protections for everyones right to
vote.
I am honored to serve in Congress on behalf of Utah families like
yours.
As your representative, I always appreciate hearing from you
on current topics and issues affecting you and our community.
Please
let me know
areas you find especially
interesting or where I can provide you with additional information.
I value your ideas and look forward to hearing from
you.
Sincerely,
U.S. Representative
4th
District of Utah
