Addressing the
Border Crisis
The Problem
Americas southern
border states have recently suffered a surge of over 52,000
unaccompanied children, teenagers, and families from Central America who are
attempting to illegally immigrate. The crisis at the border largely
rests on President Obamas shoulders due to his Deferred Action for
Childhood Arrivals (DACA) executive order. It has been widely reported that
parents in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador are sending their
children across the border because U.S. law is not enforced. This lax
enforcement has incentivized many to make the dangerous trek from Central
America during which they face extreme heat exposure, threats of
sexual molestation, and violence at the hands of drug cartels and others
involved in the smuggling. Not only are lives endangered due to lack of
U.S. border security, but the flood of Central Americans attempting to
enter the U.S. illegally is putting severe stress on border
communities.
Working Towards
a Solution
The American people agree
something must be done immediately to address the border crisis,
protect Americas border communities, and promptly remove incentives for
future illegal immigrants by
quickly returning these
unaccompanied children home . Unfortunately, President Obama has refused
to address this crisis of his own making. While this is grossly
irresponsible, it is not surprising. That is why, during the last week in
July, the House passed two bills to take action where the President has
not. These bills
H.R. 5230, a border supplemental appropriations act;
and H.R. 5272, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and
Executive Amnesty Freeze
are fully offset through cuts and
recessions of existing funds.

prohibit DACA and promptly return these children home,

While these bills address the immediate crisis,
we must continue to work toward a fully secure border and total
enforcement of current law if we are to prevent similar future
crises.

Improving
Access to Higher Education
As someone who
grew up in a family of educators, I understand the importance of quality
education and how it is directly tied to our students future
opportunities. That is why I want to ensure students across the nation and in
our great State of Texas receive the best education
possible.
Unfortunately the cost of higher-level education continues to rise
while the economy remains stagnant. In order to provide more students
access to postsecondary education and thus improve their chances for
greater future success, I voted in favor of four pro-education bills
this July. These bills would:
Provide greater
flexibility to institutions that want to provide students a more
personalized, cost-effective education
(H.R. 3136,
Advanced
Competency-Based Education Demonstration Project
Act );
Provide better financial counseling for parents and students
who take out education loans
(H.R. 4984,
Empowering
Students Through Enhanced Financial
Counseling );
Improve available information concerning institutions so parents and
students can make more informed decisions about what postsecondary
schools best meet their needs
(H.R. 4983,
Strengthening
Transparency in Higher Education Act ); and
Simplify
and improve education tax benefits so families can better use them
(H.R. 3393,
Student and Family Tax Simplification
Act) .
As Americas students prepare to begin a new school
year, I will continue my efforts on their behalf to improve our
nations education system. After all, children make up 25% of our population
and
100% of our future.

Lawsuit against President
Obama
Every President and Member of Congress, when
they are sworn in, makes an oath to uphold Americas Constitution and
protect our Nations democracy. It is our most important duty. A vital
part of our Constitutions foundation is that of proper checks and
balances
it is how our democracy, though imperfect, works. Because I
take this oath seriously, on July 30 I voted with the House to pass
H.Res. 676, a resolution to authorize a lawsuit against President Obama
for actions inconsistent with his duties outlined in the
Constitution.
I have been vocal in my opposition to this Presidents loose
interpretation of the Constitution since he was first elected to
office. He has ignored laws outright, selectively enforced others, and at
times created laws of his own through an abusive use of executive
actions. That is why I support Speaker Boehners lawsuit, which
specifically addresses the Presidents decision to twice waive ObamaCares
employer mandate and subsequent penalties for failing to comply with
it.
No President should be able to rewrite laws for convenience or
personal conscience. This lawsuit is necessary if we are to protect
and rebalance the Constitutions separation of powers. The American
people deserve true democracy.
