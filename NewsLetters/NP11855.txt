Dear Friend,
As February
comes to a close, I wanted to take this opportunity to highlight some
of the work being done in Washington, and to recognize some issues of
importance in our everyday lives.
Earlier this week,
the House announced the recovery of billions of dollars in Medicare
and related fraud.
One of the key goals of the Affordable Care Act
was cracking down on waste and abuse in Medicare and other federal
health care programs.
Since its enactment, the Department of
Health and Human Services has implemented a comprehensive anti-fraud
strategy which has allowed them to crack down on tens of thousands of health
care providers suspected of Medicare fraud.
As a result, they
have been able to recover $19.2 billion in Medicare and related fraud
for U.S. taxpayers over the last five years.
More than 50
million seniors and people with disabilities rely on Medicare and
similar programs.
I find it outrageous that there are people who would
attempt to defraud the program resulting in increased premiums and
other costs that these seniors then have to pay.
The
ACA provided agencies with new tools to crack down on fraud and these
results show that these tools are working.
I applaud the work that
these agencies have done and encourage them to continue their efforts
to root out fraud and abuse and to protect the integrity of the
program.
Throughout this month, we marked the annual celebration
of
Black History Month .
Each year we
continue to make great strides towards equality for all and it is important
that we take time each February to recognize
this.
Finally, during the month of February we also recognize
American Heart Month .
There are a number of risks
associated with heart disease and it is important to remember that a healthy
heart is a key to a healthy life. Although February has come to a
close, I encourage you to work with your doctors, and other health care
professionals to lower your risk for heart disease throughout the
year.
Thank you for your time and attention.
As
always, it is pleasure and honor to serve as your representative in
Congress.
Please feel free to visit
my website
for
updates, or contact me or my staff with any questions or concerns.
Sincerely,
Carolyn McCarthy
Member of
Congress
