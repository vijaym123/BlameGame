Pitch in now and have your gift triple-matched! &gt;&gt;
Friend --
This is INCREDIBLE news: Democrats are SURGING in the polls with three days left!
But since TEN races are still within three points and many are in red states,
CNN
reports, &ldquo;Democrats&rsquo;...
chances depend almost entirely on whether they&#39;re successful in encouraging [key groups] to vote.&rdquo;
That means we MUST get EVERY SINGLE VOTER in EVERY SINGLE BATTLEGROUND -- and we only have three days left to do it!
Friend, we have 72 hours left -- and we need you more than ever. Will you pitch in today? Your gift will be triple-matched and sent directly to the field!
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
Big-name Democrats like President Obama have already begged you to give, and now it&rsquo;s our turn.
We have a REAL CHANCE to win RED STATES like Georgia (Nate Silver&rsquo;s &ldquo;tipping point state&rdquo;) and McConnell&rsquo;s Kentucky! But CNN plainly warns: &ldquo;Senate control hinges on turnout.&rdquo;
So let&rsquo;s get as many voters to the polls as we can!
Will you pitch in today so we can run the most successful GOTV effort in midterm election history? Your gift will be triple-matched!
Thank you!
