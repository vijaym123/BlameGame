Honoring
the Sacrifices of Our Nation's
Veterans
Dear Friend,
Last week, Arthur Ordel of Albemarle
County and Robert L. Sales of Amherst
County each received the French Legion of
Honor as a token of gratitude for helping
liberate France from Nazi German
occupation. They were among six World War
II veterans awarded this medal by French
President Francois Hollande. I had the
privilege of attending their awards
ceremony, and it was an event I will not
forget.
Arthur Ordel fought with the U.S. Army
Air Corps as a bombardier in World War II,
and sixteen of his bombing missions were to
targets in France. For his 35 total
missions, he received the Distinguished
Flying Cross and the Air Medal with 4 Oak
Leaf Clusters.
Claiming he was older than he was,
Robert Sales joined the Virginia National
Guard in 1941. He fought through the first
wave of the D-Day offensive with the
Virginia National Guard. Sales was left
partially blind from the warfare but was
the only one of the 30 men in his landing
craft to survive the day. He was awarded
three Purple Hearts and the Silver Star for
his distinguished service.
I extended my congratulations to Mr.
Ordel and Mr. Sales upon receiving this
recognition for their bravery and service
to our nation and the world, and I remain
forever grateful for the sacrifices they
have made for our country.
Over 800,000 veterans call Virginia
home, and many of those heroes and their
families were concerned by a provision in a
recent budget bill that changed
veterans future retirement cost of
living adjustments. I too was concerned
about this change, and I was pleased to
vote in favor of a bill last week that
restored these cost of living adjustments
for military retirees. This legislation
passed both the House and Senate with
strong bipartisan support and now awaits
the Presidents signature.
Throughout the generations, veterans
like Arthur Ordel and Robert Sales have
selflessly served our nation and
courageously preserved our freedoms. I am
proud to represent these brave men and
women in Washington.
