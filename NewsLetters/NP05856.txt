-- President Obama emailed you.
-- Hillary Clinton emailed you.
-- And I emailed you&hellip;quite a bit. We tried to do all we could&hellip; but last night, we fell short.
I don&rsquo;t want you to get the wrong idea: We surpassed our initial goal of 1OO,OOO online donations in 5 days. It was amazing to watch.
But everything changed at 3:46pm yesterday.
That&rsquo;s when news broke that Republicans piled in $12 million to defeat us at the very last-minute. We tried our best to catch up -- but there just wasn&rsquo;t enough time.
I&rsquo;m not giving up. And you shouldn&rsquo;t either, David. With just a few hours remaining, we have one last chance to right this ship. To do it, we need 3 donors from 60659 zip code
to make a triple-matched donation by midnight. TRIPLE-MATCH EXTENSION: (for donations made TODAY ONLY) Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
Nancy
