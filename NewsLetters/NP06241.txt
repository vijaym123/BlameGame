Rep. Miller Honored as Guardian of Small Business by NFIB
Washington
&#8211; This week, U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10) was named a Guardian of Small Business by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) for her outstanding voting
record in the 113 th
Congress in support of America&#8217;s small business owners:
&#8220;Between 1993 and 2013, small businesses accounted for 63 percent of new jobs created in the U.S.,&#8221;
Miller stated.
&#8220;Their contribution to our economic vitality and ingenuity is indisputable, and Congress must work to prevent overreaching regulatory burdens that stifle their ability to operate and grow.
I appreciate this recognition and pledge to continue
to work with my colleagues to support America&#8217;s small businesses.&#8221;
NFIB President and CEO Dan Danner praised Rep. Miller for supporting small business.
&#8220;The record shows that Rep. Miller is a true champion of small business, supporting the votes that matter in the 113 th
Congress,&#8221;
said Danner.
&#8220;This award reflects our members&#8217; appreciation for supporting the NFIB pro-growth agenda for small business.&#8221;
