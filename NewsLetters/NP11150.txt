Sign Up for the Lamborn Ledger
E-Newsletter
Dear
Friend,
I know how important it is for the citizens
of the Fifth Congressional District to remain informed about what's
going on in Washington DC. Sometimes, the mainstream media isn't able
to cover what's happening. That's why, when Congress is in session, I
put out a regular email newsletter, the Lamborn Ledger, giving you a
personalized update on the important Washington events from the previous
week.
Many of
you already receive the
Lamborn
Ledger , but, in case you don't, please visit my
Congressional website at
lamborn .house.gov
and click on the
"E-Newsletter Sign-Up" button on the right side of the page to continue
receiving this and other email updates.
It is an honor to serve you in
Congress.
Sincerely,
Contact Info
