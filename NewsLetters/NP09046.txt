The release of five Taliban
extremists from Guantanamo Bay raises serious concerns.
Not only
does it potentially jeopardize the safety of our soldiers and
civilians, but it appears to contradict a longstanding policy against
negotiating with terrorists.
I hope you can take a minute to read the
attached letter I sent yesterday to the Pentagon demanding answers.
Please let me know what you think.
The
Honorable Chuck Hagel
Secretary of
Defense
1000 Defense
Pentagon
Washington, D.C. 20301-1000
Secretary
Hagel,
I am writing to ask how the Pentagon plans
to ensure that the release of five high-level Taliban terrorists will
not threaten American soldiers or
civilians.
The release of these Taliban extremists from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba
raises serious questions about negotiating with terrorists and, more
immediately, the threat posed by these five high-risk
terrorists.
Among the Afghan detainees released from Guantanamo
include two senior militant commanders tied to operations that killed
innocent Americans.
In fact, according to assessments by the
Pentagon in 2008, all five detainees were considered
high risk, as
they may pose a threat to the U.S., its interests and
allies.
It is no wonder why the Taliban has made several attempts over the
past 10 years to free these terrorists from
custody.
Why now are they no longer considered a high-risk
threat and their release suddenly
justifiable?
Therefore, I respectfully ask that the Department of Defense provide my
office with answers to the
following:
What measures have been put in place to ensure these
terrorists dont simply return to the secret Taliban hideaways to plot
reprisals against the United States and its
allies?
How can we be certain they will not begin to recruit and
replenish Taliban forces?
Do we
understand the consequences for the rest of our forces of a policy based on
negotiating with terrorists for the release of hostages or
prisoners?
And does that policy put in danger American troops stationed
abroad?
It is
imperative for the safety of Americans and our national security that the
questions above be answered.
I look forward to your response and
thank you for your time and attention to this
matter.
Sincerely,
Vern Buchanan
Member of Congress
