Dear
Friend,
Congress is continuing its work
to provide oversight of the Department of Veterans Affairs efforts to
provide care to our veterans. We also considered legislation last
week that will ensure our military has the resources it needs to protect
American interests across the
world.
Below is an overview of some of the work Im doing on your behalf. To
learn more about what I have been working on, please visit
my website ,

Sincerely,
Congressman Pat
Meehan
Visiting the VA in Horsham,
Montgomery County
After an nationwide audit by the
Department of Veterans Affairs, several VA facilities in our area have
been identified for further review. I recently visited the VA clinic
in Horsham for an update on their efforts to improve care for
veterans.
Read more about the visit
here.
The House has
passed a number of
bills
to help veterans get the timely medical care they
deserve.

health care issues while visiting the VA clinic in Horsham,

Discussing the
Crisis in Iraq
I sat down with FOX29 to discuss the
current crisis in Iraq. The unrest in the country is very concerning,
both for our own national security and for the security of our allies in
the region like Israel and Jordan. Click below to watch:
Innovation in Educating Students with
Autism
I the opportunity to visit the Garnet Valley School District to
observe how small humanoid robots are being used by teachers to educate
special needs students in the classroom. The district is the first in
Pennsylvania to acquire this groundbreaking technology. I was
impressed to see how positively the students interacted with the robots and
how truly engaged they were. To read more about my visit, click
