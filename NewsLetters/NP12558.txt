Rep. Bruce Braley -- Iowa's First
District
David,
My top priority is listening to you. That's why I need your feedback
today on what matters to you most in 2014.
Whether your focus is on creating jobs in Iowa, reducing the federal
deficit, or caring for our veterans when they come home, your opinion
matters to me. I wouldn't be able to do my job without your input.
Congress will be facing big challenges this year, and your input is
critical.
Click here to take this one-question survey and let me know what
Congress should focus on in 2014.
Your feedback today will help me do my job better for you and folks
across Iowa.
Thanks so much, and I hope to hear from you soon.
All the best,
Bruce
P.S. Please feel free to forward this email to your friends and family
