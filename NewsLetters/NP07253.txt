The House
Acts to Address the Crisis at the
Border
Dear Friend,
Our immigration system is undeniably
broken and in need of serious reform. This
administrations failure and refusal
to secure our borders has largely created
the humanitarian crisis we are seeing on
our southern border. President
Obamas blatant disregard for our
laws has encouraged tens of thousands of
people, many of them children, to risk
their lives making the dangerous journey to
cross the border illegally, jeopardizing
our national security, and undermining our
laws. It is imperative that we, first and
foremost, secure our borders, and
subsequently, return to an immigration
policy that is rooted in the rule of
law.
Virginias Fifth District saw
firsthand the effects of this crisis in
June when the
U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) planned to convert
the
recently-closed campus of Saint
Pauls College in Lawrenceville into
a detention center for 500 illegal
immigrants in a week's time without
consulting anyone in the community. After a
public meeting attended by over a thousand
concerned citizens, it was clear that the
community found the public health and
safety risks far too great and were
frustrated with the manner in which the
federal government attempted to force this
plan upon the community. Thankfully,
HHS
followed the will of the people and
withdrew the plan , but this episode
demonstrated that the consequences of this
administration's policies reach far beyond
the border states and that this crisis is
overwhelming our resources.
Last week,
the
House took critical steps
toward
addressing the current immigration crisis
at our southern border by passing key
legislation that addresses the root causes
of the crisis and stops the flow of illegal
border crossings. These bills will send
targeted resources to bolster our border
security personnel, allow border states to
deploy the National Guard, provide these
Central American children a safe and
expeditious return to their home countries,
and implement meaningful reforms that will
discourage, rather than encourage, illegal
migration.
Unfortunately, our counterparts in the
Senate and the White House have been
critical of our efforts despite taking no
action of their own to meet these
challenges. There are even reports that the
president is considering expanding the very
policies that generated the surge in
illegal border crossings in the first
place. I hope that the President and the
Senate will ultimately join us and support
these bills so that we will strengthen the
security at our border and renew the effort
to achieve an immigration policy that is
rooted in the rule of law.
