Lipinski and Bennett
Make Case in Washington
for Increased Investment in Local
Transportation;
Focus on Need for Rail
Underpasses
Palos Hills
Mayor Jerry Bennett recently testified at a hearing of the U.S. House
Transportation Committee Subcommittee of Highways and Transit about
the need for greater federal investment in local transportation
infrastructure. He talked about the importance of CREATE
the Chicago Region
Environmental and Transportation Efficiency program
and focused
specifically on the need for more funding for road underpasses at rail
crossing; these projects, critical to easing road congestion, are lagging
behind other CREATE projects. Bennett, who is also Chairman of the
Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, was invited to testify by
Congressman (IL-3) Dan Lipinski. For more on Bennetts testimony, check
out
this article
in the
Chicago Tribune .
CREATE is critical to easing congestion on the roads and
rails in northeastern Illinois, said Rep. Lipinski. In 2005, I was
able to secure $100 million to get CREATE started and since then another
$1.1 billion has been invested in this public-private partnership.
CREATE is reducing costly congestion, saving lives, and leading to more
jobs for the struggling middle class.
But not enough progress has
been made on funding the 25 underpasses that are part of CREATE. This
must be the focus as we move forward.
Lipinski: Federal Grant
for Public-Private Lab P uts Chicago on Cutting Edge of Manufacturing Innovation,
Creating
Jobs
Through the hard work of Congressman Dan Lipinski (IL-3), the Illinois
congressional delegation, state and local leaders, universities, and
private industry, Chicago-based UI LABS has been awarded a $70 million
grant from the U.S. Department of Defense to help form the Digital
Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute. The facility will be a
public-private partnership with industry having already promised to
contribute more than $250 million. The lab
headquartered on the northern end
of Goose Island in Chicago
will look to turn high tech research
into new products and good middle class manufacturing jobs. For more
information, click
here .
One of my top priorities
in Congress has been promoting American manufacturing to help create
good middle class jobs in northeastern Illinois and across our nation,
and one important way to do this is through public-private
cooperation, said Lipinski. That is why I worked with my colleagues to
fight for this federal grant for UI Labs.
