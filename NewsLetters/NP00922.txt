Each year for the past sixty-four years, the President has called the American people to a day united in prayer. We call it the National Day of Prayer, and today, we celebrate it once again.
As a nation, we have faced many daunting challenges throughout our history and have overcome them.
We are optimistic about Americas future because throughout her history, the prayers of our people have united and sustained us across impossible odds.
The first presidential call to prayer was issued by George Washington on October 3, 1789. He wrote, It is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey his will, to be grateful for his benefits, and humbly to implore his protection and favor.
Since then, there have been over 130 presidential calls to prayer and, in 1952, President Harry Truman signed a law making the National Day of Prayer an annual event. In honor of this day, I, along with Speaker Boehner and Co-Chairman of the Congressional Prayer Caucus Senator Lankford, led 53 other Members of Congress in writing an open letter on why prayer is an integral aspect of our national heritage. You can see a copy of the letter,
