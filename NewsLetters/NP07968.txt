This week was dedicated
to solving the crisis at our border. As many of you know,
I have been appointed to a House working group
put together
to solve this terrible crisis in Texas. Over the past week our group
met with the Ambassador of Honduras, the Ambassador of Mexico, and other
influential leaders about the influx of children crossing our border.
This is the most important issue in Texas right now, and I will
continue fighting diligently to fix this overwhelming problem and secure
our borders.
The FBI is the best investigative
agency in our country and they have agreed to conduct an
FBI investigation
into the criminal allegations at the Temple
VA facility. I believe that the FBI needs to be investigating the
Temple VA facility for criminal activities, and the Veterans Affairs
Administration needs to be investigating the facility as well to
administer cultural and bureaucratic reforms. If there are corrupt bureaucrats
at the Temple VA, I am confident the FBI will find them and they will
be held responsible.
On Wednesday, the House
passed
H.R. 803 , the
Workforce Innovation
and Opportunity Act , under a suspension of the rules by a vote of
415
6 (See Roll Call
#378 ).
H.R. 803
reauthorizes the Workforce Investment Act, streamlines workforce
development activities, eliminates 15 duplicative and ineffective workforce
programs, and strengthens the role of States and local governments in
directing workforce development programs.
On
Thursday, the House passed
H.R. 4923 , the FY15
Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act by a
vote of 253-170 (See Roll Call
#402 ). This bill
deregulates our nations natural energy resources and
blocks the Democrats
attempt to federally regulate all ditches,
mudflats and other wet areas on private lands.
H.R. 4923 also
funds our national defense nuclear weapons activities, the Army Corps of
Engineers and the Department of Energy.
I
will be back in D.C. next Monday to keep working on our nations crises.
I hope everyone had a great 4 th
of July and Ill be seeing
yall soon.
