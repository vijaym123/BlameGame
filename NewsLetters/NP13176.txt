Friends,
Thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter.
I appreciate having the
opportunity to share news from Washington and South Carolina, as well
as the work I am doing in the United States Senate on your behalf.
Restoring the 40-hour Workweek
This week, I introduced an amendment
that would
restore the 40-hour workweek that Obamacare has unraveled with its
employer mandate provision.
Many local businesses that have already
had to tighten their belts in our sluggish economy are faced with a
tough choice: provide healthcare for all employees working over 30
hours a week, or pay a hefty fine.
As a result, when the employer mandate goes into effect next year,
countless Americans who are earning hourly wages will see a 25% cut in
pay as employers scale down working hours to below the 30 hour
threshold, while still struggling to keep their doors open. Thanks to
Obamacare, not only will these workers not have healthcare, but they
will no longer have full time jobs.

Keeping up the Pressure on Iran
I joined fifty-seven of my colleagues to co-sponsor the Nuclear Weapon
Free Iran Act-an unequivocal message to the administration and the
world that we are serious about keeping Iran from developing nuclear
weapons.
The current sanctions are working, and this bill would allow for
further penalties to the Iranian economy should they persist in their
nuclear weapons program. Their development of nuclear weapons is
impermissible.
January is National Mentoring Month
Many children grow up lacking the example of a responsible, loving
adult, or having someone take the time to talk to them about their
lives, futures, and ambitions. Mentoring is an amazing way for us to
fill that gap.
I was lucky enough to find a mentor when I wasn't on
the right track as a kid, and between the principles shared by my
mentor and the discipline from my mother, I was able to reach my
potential to become the man I am today.
This January and every month, let's remember that these kids have
amazing potential, and come together as a community to ensure we
provide the very best possible start for them.
It is an honor to serve the people of South Carolina in the United
States Senate.
I appreciate hearing your feedback, and please don't
hesitate to contact my office with any questions or concerns.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott

Friends,
Thank
you
for
subscribing

my
e-newsletter.
I
appreciate
having
the
opportunity
to
share
news
from
Washington
and
South

as
well
as
the
work
I
am
doing
in

Senate
on

Restoring
the
40-hour
Workweek
This
week,
I
introduced
an
amendment
that
would
restore
the
40-hour
workweek
that
Obamacare
has
unraveled
with
its
employer
mandate
provision.
Many
local
businesses
that
have
already
had
to
tighten
their
belts
in
our
sluggish
economy
are
faced
with
a
tough
choice:
provide
healthcare
for
all
employees
working
over
30
hours
a
week,
or
pay
a
hefty
fine.
As
a
result,
when
the
employer
mandate
goes
into
effect
next
year,
countless
Americans
who
are
earning
hourly
wages
will
see
a
25%
cut
in
pay
as
employers
scale
down
working
hours
to
below
the
30
hour
threshold,
while
still
struggling
to
keep
their
doors
open.
Thanks
to
Obamacare,
not
only
will
these
workers
not
have
healthcare,
but
they
will
no
longer
have
full
time
jobs.
