I paid my respects during Memorial Day this past weekend and joined the community to commemorate the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.
I feel that the freedom we enjoy today is a credit to the members of the armed services who fought bravely for us around the world. During Memorial Day weekend, I met with my constituents to discuss the importance of educating the young people in our community about the importance of civic service and engagement.
I met with many veterans of past wars. during Memorial Day events this past weekend and discussed how my office can of assistance for any casework issues they may have.
My Outreach Coordinator for Wilson County, Gilbert Lafuente, presented certificates of recognition to a group of veterans in Sutherland Springs.
My Outreach Coordinator, Nichole Hernandez, attended the Operation Interdependence Kick-Off event with local Rio Grande Valley organizations to discuss our joint support for veterans and ways we can collaborate.
Laredo Energy Summit
Pictured here are (from left to right) Mexican Congressman Javier Trevino, former American Ambassador to Mexico Tony Garza, and Ross Ramsey of the Texas Tribune at the Mexican Oil and Gas Opportunities update. It is important that all parties get together to discuss the current energy climate and future plans.
This week, I spoke at the Mexican Oil and Gas Opportunities conference and provided an update on the shale oil boom we are experiencing in South Texas.
Today, Texas is the leading crude oil producing state in the nation, largely due to the growth of the Eagle Ford Shale.
The oil and gas development has the potential to dramatically change our communities for the better, as long as we make the long term investments in our communities and infrastructure.
Last week, I also invited officials from Pemex, Mexicos state oil company, to join me in Laredo for a discussion on oil and gas cooperation between the United States and Mexico.
We also discussed how our governments can collaborate on border security.

Rep. Cuellar joined officials from Pemex, Mexico's state oil company, to discuss the oil and gas shale boom and its impact on South Texas.
Successful Casework in Webb County
Elda Ramirez came to my Laredo office last year hoping to clear up issues with her passport approval process. My staff was able to coordinate with the State Department and successfully got Elda her passport in a timely manner.
Elda Ramirez is a graduating senior studying at the University of Texas in San Antonio. Last year, she had an opportunity to study abroad in Spain but she had issues hearing back about the status of her passport application.
She reached out to my caseworker, Martha Barrera, in Laredo for help. Martha was able to work with the State Department and make sure Elva got her passport in time to start her trip.
Elda, we are so happy you had the opportunity to travel abroad and have this experience. Congratulations on your graduation and best of luck in your next steps!
New Lytle Police Station Opens
Gilbert Lafuente, my outreach coordinator for Atascosa County, joined the Lytle Police Department and the Mayor of Lytle to mark the opening of the town's new police station. With the help of federal funding, this building was constructed so that the police could better protect the community of Lytle and keep its citizens safe.
My Outreach Coordinator for Atascosa County, Gilbert Lafuente, presented Mark Bowen, the Mayor of Lytle, with a certificate and a U.S. flag to commemorate the opening of a new police facility in Lytle, which received federal funds. With the addition of this new station, the Lytle Police force will be better equipped to protect serve their community. Our offices are equally committed to ensuring the public safety of Lytle and the surrounding community.
Meeting with DaVita Healthcare
My outreach coordinator for Starr County met with executives of DaVita Healthcare Partners, Inc. regarding methods to improve providing the proper care to constituents across Rio Grande Valley.
My outreach coordinator for Starr County, Jorge Trevino, met with executives of DaVita Healthcare Partners, Inc. in an effort to discuss ways in which they can improve their care for patients in Mission.
