Dear
Friends,
This week, April 19-27, is
National Park Week.
Its hard to believe it
was more than one year ago on
March 26, 2013 that Delaware
became the final state to
enter the National Park
System with the designation
of the First State National
Monument. Im still
wholeheartedly supporting the
effort to make our national
monument a national park, but
we dont have to wait
for any further designation
to enjoy our monument or any
of the other beautiful parks
found in our state.
The First State National
Monument is Americas
400th national park site and
it tells the important story
of Delawares role in
creating our great nation.
From the original Quaker
settlements along Woodlawn
Tract to the New Castle
Courthouse where Delaware
gained statehood down to the
site where Delaware became
the first state to ratify the
U.S. Constitution on the
Dover Green, the First State
National Monument preserves
our state and nations
history for generations to
come.
I encourage all
Delawareans to take the
opportunity to celebrate
National Park Week by
enjoying and exploring the
beauty and history of
Delaware that the First State
National Monument provides.
You can also visit any one of
Delaware's beautiful state
parks.
Have you visited the First
State National Monument yet?
