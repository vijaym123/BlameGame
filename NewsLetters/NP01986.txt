Friend
Just a quick note
wanted to let you know I recently sent a letter calling to end the use of federal dollars to push states to adopt or keep Common Core. You can read the letter,
here .
I strongly believe our education system is the most effective, and serves our children best, when the federal footprint in education is reduced, local control is restored, and parents and local education leaders are empowered to hold schools accountable for effectively teaching students.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S. If youd like to hear some of my more in depth thoughts on the issue, read the
recent column
I wrote on why we need common sense education, not Common Core.
