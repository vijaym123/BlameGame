RECENTLY IN WASHINGTON
LATEST ON THE BUDGET
The House passed HJRes 59, better known as the Ryan - Murray budget.
This legislation allows Congress to return to regular order by going
through the appropriations process instead of relying on continuing
resolutions. While the bill is far from perfect, the benefits outweigh
the costs.
I explain my decision here

PROTECTING OUR PRIVACY
New technologies are making it increasingly easy to track and log the
location of private citizens. As I told MSNBC recently, we need to make
sure laws are keeping up with technology to protect our privacy. Watch
that interview here
.
I also spoke on the House floor
about legislation I introduced with Sen. Wyden (D-OR).
Additionally, Sen. Wyden and I sent a letter
to Attorney General Eric Holder requesting the DOJ to release
two legal memos that allegedly give guidance on when GPS devices may be
used in the course of an investigation. Read more here

JUDICARY COMMITTEE UPDATE
Asylum
In a hearing conducted by the Judiciary Committee I joined fellow
lawmakers in questioning top Obama immigration officials about a sharp
rise in the number of people claiming asylum at the Southwest border.
Read the Wall Street Journal's recap of the hearing here
.
No More Patent Trolls
Patent trolls contribute nothing positive to the economy. In an attempt
to reduce the number of frivolous lawsuits brought on by these trolls,
the House passed the Innovation Act, which takes steps to combat the
ever increasing problem of abusive patent litigation.
