Dear Friend,
Ronald Reagan once said his fondest hope for young people is that they would love their country for her selflessness and idealism. As the school year comes to a close, I have reflected on all of the great schools I have had the pleasure of visiting while in Congress. From Rolla to Caruthersville, Sikeston to Gainesville, and Festus to Doniphan, I&#146;ve been bringing Congress to the classroom. When I speak with students, my message is simple&#58; You can make an impact no matter your age.
Young people don&#146;t have to wait until they are older to get involved in the political process. Since taking office, I have talked with bright students at more than 50 schools across the district and they have great ideas on how to move America forward. I encourage them to follow what is happening in Jefferson City and in Washington, D.C. to see how legislation affects their lives. They can make their voices heard now by contacting their elected officials through traditional methods like phone calls and letters, but also through Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
Even now students can have an immediate impact in their communities. Young people can volunteer with civic organizations, get involved in their churches or create their own opportunities to serve.
I am so proud of the students I have met around the area that are taking action. They are volunteering at food pantries, coaching teams for kids with disabilities, improving hiking trails and so much more.
As one of the youngest members of the House of Representatives, I want today&#146;s students to know that they are tomorrow&#146;s leaders. With hard work and perseverance these bright young people can accomplish anything.
THIS WEEK&#39;S HIGHLIGHTS
On Monday, I joined Potosi High School in honoring Washington County&#146;s World War II veterans. It&#146;s important that all of us learn from these veterans and preserve the history and wisdom of the Greatest Generation.
The EPA is threatening our rural property rights with its Waters of the United States rule. The farmers, ranchers and property owners in southeast and southern Missouri know how to protect our water resources better than an unelected bureaucrat in D.C. I&#146;m working to hold the EPA&#146;s feet to the fire and protect our rural way of life.

We must put a stop to painful late&#45;term abortions, especially when we are saving premature babies born at the same age. That is why this week I voted for H.R. 36, the Pain&#45;Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.
Sincerely,
Jason Smith
Member of Congress
