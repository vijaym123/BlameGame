&ldquo;Late Surge of Money Buoys Republicans in Races That Will Decide Control of Senate&rdquo;
Friend -- The
New York Times
reports that in the seven closest races,
&ldquo;Republicans held more cash in six of them.&rdquo; Six is exactly the number of states the GOP must win to take control!
We&rsquo;re launching a 24-Hour Emergency Media Campaign to answer every single Republican attack.
With the Senate TIED, you can&rsquo;t let this 19-day surge tip the Senate to the GOP at the last second.
We can match their advantage dollar for dollar -- but we need 6,187 Democrats to step up in the next 24 hours.
Will you pitch in to our Emergency Media Campaign to keep the Senate Blue? We&rsquo;ll match your gift and double your impact.
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
We&rsquo;ve fought so hard to gain leads in deep-red states. It&rsquo;ll be absolutely devastating if we&rsquo;re wiped out by a couple of checks from Republican billionaires.
But mark our words: We can -- and WILL -- win this election.
We can take away the Republicans&rsquo; chances and hand them a terribly disappointing loss on Election Day.
But we need 6,187 grassroots supporter to step up in the next 24 hours.
Will you pitch in to our 24-hour Emergency Media Campaign to keep the Senate blue?
