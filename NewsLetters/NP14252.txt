Dear Friends,
Let us all take a moment today to thank our
veterans. It is because of their courage and skill that America
remains the leader of the free world.
If you are a veteran, I want you to know you can always
look to my office to provide help dealing with the federal bureaucracy.
You can contact my office at
662-841-8808
or follow

to our website for
assistance.
Our obligation
to our troops does not end when a war is over. As your
Representative in Congress, I will do everything in my power to support our
veterans, and ensure the federal government honors the commitments made to
those military families who have sacrificed so much to defend this
great nation.
Stay in touch and God bless,
