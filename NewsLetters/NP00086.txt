New Video from Sen. Cornyn: "Fund Our
Troops"
In response
to the Senate Democrats' filibuster of the Defense Appropriations bill
last week, I released a video to highlight the necessity of this
funding.
We ask a lot of our men and women in
uniform. The very least we can do is pass legislation that provides for their
training and equipment that they need in order to accomplish their
mission and to ensure them the quality of life that they and their
families have earned.
