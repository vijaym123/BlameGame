Reducing
Burdensome Regulations
Last week, I
wrote that the House would be pursuing measures designed to reform our
federal regulatory system.
As part of Stop Government Abuse
Week, we cast a number of votes this week to do just
that.
Of note, we passed H.R. 2804, the ALERRT Act.
This legislation
represents an important effort to bring common sense and transparency
to an out-of-control regulatory process that is stifling growth,
especially among small businesses.
I was especially pleased that the
Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act , legislation I helped
author as Chairman of the House Small Business Committee, was
incorporated into the ALERRT Act.
For over 30 years, agencies
have been required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or RFA, to examine
the impacts of regulations on small businesses.
If those
impacts are significant, agencies must consider alternatives.
However,
agencies still fail to fully comply with the law.
In numerous
hearings over the years, the Small Business Committee has heard about
the consequences that burdensome regulations have on farmers, home
builders, manufacturers, and many others.
The
Regulatory
Flexibility Improvements Act
eliminates loopholes that agencies
have used to avoid compliance with the RFA.
It requires agencies
to genuinely scrutinize the impacts of regulations on small businesses
before theyre finalized, not wait until after the fact to witness
the negative effects.
Reducing unnecessary regulatory
burdens frees up scarce time, money, and resources that small businesses can
use to expand their operations and hire new
employees.
The
Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act
is bipartisan
legislation that has the strong support of the business community.
It simply requires agencies to do their homework before they regulate.
If agencies do their work, more Americans will be
working.
