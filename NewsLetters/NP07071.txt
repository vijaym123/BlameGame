HIGHLIGHTS IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
Army Corps seeking comments on harbor improvements - The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014
provides new eligibility for the Northern Marianas to receive funding to protect shorelines and areas vulnerable to flooding. President Obama signed the new law on June 10, and the Army Corps of Engineers is now taking comment on specifics of how the law will be implemented. WRRDA also affects harbor maintenance programs the Corps runs, as well as how the federal government supports remote and subsistence harbors, such as the $1.7 million dredging and revetment repair of the Rota Harbor. The Corps has scheduled four sessions in August and September
to listen to public input. Each session covers specific topics . Written comments may be submitted to wrrda@usace.army.mil . Section 1032, my provision that lowers the local match required for Army Corps projects in the NMI, is a straightforward calculation based on the rate of inflation over the last 28 years, so it is not one of the topics requiring public comment.

$83,070 awarded to NMI American Red Cross for emergency food and shelter - The Northern Mariana Islands Chapter of the American Red Cross was awarded a grant of $83,070, the Federal Emergency Management Agency announced this week. The funds come from the Emergency Food and Shelter Program and are to be used to provide assistance during a typhoon or other disaster. The Program is administered by a National Board, made up of representatives of the major charitable organizations and chaired by FEMA. The National Board determines how funds are distributed around the country based on population, unemployment, and income levels. Congress provided the underlying money for the Emergency Food and Shelter Program in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014, Public Law 113-76 .

Social Security is 79 years old - With Commonwealth government employees now enrolled in the U.S. Social Security system, it is more important than ever to pay attention to the fiscal health of the program. Social Security benefits are critical not only to individuals in our community, but also to our local economy. Social Security paid out $18,576,000 in retirement and disability benefits to 2,567 people in the Northern Mariana Islands last year. Another $7,716,000 went to the 1,063 persons here who qualify for the Supplemental Security Income program. Those numbers could grow as government employees qualify, then retire and begin receiving a Social Security pension. This week Social Security celebrates its 79th birthday. I will continue to support this important part of the social safety net, seek to strengthen the system, and oppose cuts to benefits for those who have contributed during their working lives.
