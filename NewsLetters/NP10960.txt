Dear Fellow New Mexican,
Yesterday, I spoke on the Senate floor in support of raising the federal hourly minimum wage. Everyone deserves a fair shot at success in this country. That is at the heart of why this issue truly matters -- especially for women, who make up a majority of minimum-wage workers today.
Watch my speech here &gt;&gt;
Raising the minimum wage is not just good for workers, it's good for business and for the economy at large. A higher minimum wage helps reduce turnover, increases productivity and boosts consumer demand. For many, raising the minimum wage means the difference between poverty and dignity, and it can mean a difference between a trip to the food bank and a trip to the grocery store.
New Mexicans are no strangers to hard work, we embrace the belief that if you work hard and play by the rules, you should be able to get ahead.
There are cities in New Mexico who are already taking the initiative on this issue. In Santa Fe, the minimum wage is $10.51 per hour, and in in Las Cruces, there is a growing grassroots effort to raise the city's minimum wage. As a former city councilor, I fought to raise the minimum wage in Albuquerque, and today it's $1.25 higher than the current federal rate.
It's time to ensure that every New Mexican -- every American -- has a fair shot. It's time to raise the minimum wage.
Please share your thoughts
with me on this and other issues important to you. It is an honor and privilege to serve you in the United States Senate.
Be well, and please keep in touch.
Sincerely ,
MARTIN HEINRICH
United States Senator
