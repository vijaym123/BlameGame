David --
There are over
two million
eligible voters in Illinois who aren't yet registered to vote.
Fortunately, local and national leaders are taking steps to ensure more voters have the chance to participate in our democratic process:
On Thursday, Hillary Clinton announced her commitment to instituting automatic voter registration nationwide.
And right now, a proposal in the Illinois State Senate would automatically register citizens to vote when they get a driver&rsquo;s license.
So David, Brad wants to know what you think:

While discriminatory Voter ID laws are being passed in many states across the country, Illinois could join Oregon as the only state to have an automatic voter registration law on the books.
