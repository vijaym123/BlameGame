Hog Tying Executive Orders with the Purse Strings
Dear Friends,
This week, I voted with the majority of my colleagues to pass
H.R. 240:
the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2015 . The amendments we made to this bill effectively hog-tie President Obamas executive actions on immigration with the purse strings.
The legislation defunds and forbids use of fees or appropriated funds to pay for the Presidents latest actions on immigration or other substantially similar orders that he may give in the future.
It also ensures the priority removal of sex offenders and domestic violence perpetrators and prevents any continued activity under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
The amended legislation also expresses the sense of Congress that illegal immigrants should not be put ahead of legal immigrants in line and that there should be no incentive to hire illegal aliens over an American citizen, like the $3,000 companies can often save by hiring an illegal who is not eligible for Obamacare and refusing legal citizens.
I am very pleased with this bill and I believe that it is a good start to getting our immigration system back on track.
Please
tell me your thoughts and concerns
on these and other issues.
Sincerely,
