Finding Insurance that Works for You
Monday, December 1, 2014
Dear Friend,
I wanted to remind you that enrollment in the Health Insurance Marketplace for 2015 is now open and available through February 15, 2015.
This means that Central Coast residents can log-on to
Covered California , a one-stop shop website to search for comprehensive health insurance available in our region. There you can join the 1.4 million Californians who signed up for insurance through Covered California during the 2014 sign-up period or review your current plan to see what would be your best option for next year. If you have Medicare, you are already covered and do not need to do anything with this website.
The health plans being offered ensure that a person can&rsquo;t be denied for pre-existing conditions, that consumers face no annual or lifetime limits on coverage, and that insurance companies can&rsquo;t discriminate against women by charging them higher rates.
On the Covered California website, residents can:
-
Compare health insurance policies
-
Look into whether you can receive financial assistance to make your premiums more affordable
-
Sign up for healthcare coverage
If you already have coverage, you can:
-
Log-on to renew your plan
-
Shop around for a different plan that may better suit your needs
-
See if you qualify for additional tax credits
-
Update personal information that needs to be updated annually
To learn more about obtaining health coverage, or to continue or change your current plan, visit
www.CoveredCA.com
or call 1-800-300-1506. The numbers of service center representatives have been increased and the service center hours have been expanded to help with answer your questions. You can also visit the
Covered California Frequently Asked Questions page .
If you are having additional issues, you can
reach out to one of my offices , or
send me an email . You can also stay in touch by
liking my Facebook page
or
