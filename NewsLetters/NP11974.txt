Taxpayer
Transparency Act
I am happy to report my
Taxpayer
Transparency Act
was passed unanimously by the House of
Representatives.
Every day, federal agencies spend money advertising
various programs without mentioning where the funding for these
programs or their ads comes from.
U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Louis Brandeis famously said, sunlight is said to be the best of
disinfectants.
I agree with that sentiment and that is why I
authored the
Taxpayer Transparency Act .
The legislation is
about shining a light on how taxpayer dollars are spent by requiring
Executive Branch agencies to disclose that these advertisements are paid
for at taxpayer expense.
Simply, the
Taxpayer
Transparency Act
extends similar requirements already imposed on
the House and Senate to the Executive Branch.
As members of
Congress we should all support an open and honest government, and this
legislation does that by requiring Executive Branch agencies to be
transparent with spending taxpayer dollars to promote federal
programs.
Protecting Free
Speech
All Americans had a right to be angry when we learned the IRS was
being used as a weapon to silence the political beliefs of certain
groups of Americans.
The IRSs gross misconduct raises
disturbing questions about the professionalism and neutrality of
bureaucrats who are supposed to enforce the law in a fair, even-handed
manner.
Evidently there was a concerted effort by IRS agents to delay,
deny and harass conservative political groups seeking 501(c) (4) tax
exempt status under the tax code.
This kind of unequal treatment
goes against the very heart of our nations laws and our societys
sense of justice.
All Americans, no matter what their personal
circumstances or ideological beliefs, should be equal before the
law.
Last November the IRS issued proposed rules to restrict
free speech of 501 (c) (4) organizations, but other tax-exempt groups
like labor unions would be not subject to the same the rules.
The
proposed rules would not allow 501 (c) (4) organizations to engage in
voter registration, get-out-the-vote activities, or hold candidate
forums without endangering their tax exempt status.
The proposed
rules would not impact 501 (c) (3)
groups.
On February 26 th
the House voted to rein in the
IRS when we passed the
Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by
the IRS Act of 2014
(H.R. 3865).
This
legislation prevents the proposed IRS regulations on 501 (c) (4) organizations
from taking effect for one year to allow for the House to complete its
IRS targeting investigation in an effort to stop the administration
for targeting groups because of their beliefs.
