Dear Friend,
Since being sworn in this past January, it has been an honor to serve
the people of south central Wisconsin as your representative in
Congress. As we near the end of 2013, I want to wish you a happy
holiday season and share some thoughts on the past year.
Submitting my first bill, The Right to Vote Amendment, in May.
In some ways, 2013 has been a year of progress. Across the nation, we've
seen 11 straight months of job growth, accounting for two million added
jobs this year. I celebrated and stood in solidarity with equality
advocates as the Supreme Court struck down the discriminatory Defense
of Marriage Act, closing a dark chapter of our history books once and
for all. And we have begun the process of bringing home our courageous
men and women serving in Afghanistan.
Yet as we approach 2014, many challenges remain for both our state and
our country. We need to work together to continue to grow our economy
and support job creation, promote a living wage for every worker,
protect voting rights for every American, and ensure that all of our
students receive an education befitting the challenges and
opportunities of the 21st century.
In the new year, I have faith that we can bring some Wisconsin
commonsense to Washington. As a new member of the House Education and
the Workforce Committee, I plan to use 2014 to serve as a voice for our
district's universities, teachers, students, and workers. And I will
continue to work with my colleagues, from both sides of the aisle, on
commonsense, balanced policies that will help grow our economy and put
the people of south central Wisconsin back to work.
Speaking with constituents in Monroe.
As always, I am committed to making sure your voice is heard in
Washington and I want you to know my door is open. I hope you enjoy the
upcoming holidays with family and friends, and I wish you a safe and
happy New Year.

Dear
Friend,
Since
being
sworn
in
this
past
January,
it
has
been
an
honor
to
serve
the
people
of
south
central
Wisconsin
as
your
representative
in
Congress.
As
we
near
the
end
of
2013,
I
want
to
wish
you
a
happy
holiday
season and
share
some
thoughts
on
the
past
year.
Submitting
my
first
bill,
The
Right
to
Vote
Amendment ,
in
May.
In
some
ways,
2013
has
been
a
year
of
progress.
Across
the
nation,
we&#8217;ve
seen
11
straight
months
of
job
growth,
accounting
for two
million
added
jobs
this
year.
I
celebrated
and
stood
in
solidarity
with
equality
advocates
as
the
Supreme
Court
struck
down
the
discriminatory
Defense
of
Marriage
Act,
closing
a
dark
chapter
of
our
history
books
once
and
for
all.
And
we
have
begun
the
process
of
bringing
home
our
courageous
men
and
women serving
in Afghanistan.
Yet
as
we
approach
2014,
many
challenges
remain
for
both
our
state
and
our
country. We
need
to
work
together
to
continue
to
grow
our
economy
and
support
job
creation,
promote
a
living
wage
for
every
worker,
protect
voting
rights
for
every
American,
and
ensure
that
all
of
our
students
receive
an
education
befitting
the
challenges
and
opportunities
of
the
21st
century.
In
the
new
year,
I have
faith
that
we
can
bring
some
Wisconsin
commonsense
to
Washington.
As
a
new
member
of
the
House
Education
and
the
Workforce
Committee,
I
plan
to
use
2014
to
serve
as
a
voice
for
our
district&#8217;s
universities,
teachers,
students,
and
workers.
And
I
will
continue
to
work
with
my
colleagues,
from
both
sides
of
the
aisle,
on
commonsense,
balanced
policies
that
will
help
grow
our
economy
and
put
the
people
of
south
central
Wisconsin
back
to
work.
Speaking
with
constituents
in
Monroe.
As
always,
I
am
committed
to
making
sure
your
voice
is
heard
in
Washington
and
I
want
you
to
know
my
door
is
open.
I
hope
you
enjoy
the
upcoming
holidays
with
family
and
friends,
and
I
wish
you
a
safe
and
happy
New
Year.
