Americans Want the Rule of Law to Prevail
Congressman Calls on Senate Democrats to End Filibuster of DHS Appropriations Bill
Washington, DC Congressman John Culberson (TX-07) joined House and Senate Republicans in calling on Senate Democrats to end their filibuster of the Department of Homeland Security funding bill. The funding legislation was already approved by the House earlier this year.
In his remarks, Culberson said, The American people want the rule of law to prevail in this country. They want the President, Democrats and the Congress to follow the Constitution and the law. The Republican House and Republican Senate will do that. We understood the message our constituents sent in November and we are following through on that promise, but for a handful of Democrats in the Senate who refuse to acknowledge or accept the message of this election. And I urge them to do the right thing, get out of the way, and fund the Department of Homeland Security and enforce the law.
On January 14, 2015, the House did the job our constituents asked us to do. We fully funded border security and law enforcement in the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill and blocked President Obamas unconstitutional executive amnesty. Just over 90 days ago, the American people decisively rejected President Obamas agenda. I will continue to do everything in my power to stop President Obama from doing further damage to the rule of law in our nation, and I will not rest until his unconstitutional amnesty for illegal aliens is stopped.
