The 114th Congress
This
week marks the beginning of the 114th Congress and the beginning of a
new Republican majority in both the House and Senate ready to draft,
debate and advance positive solutions. Where possible, we are eager to
find common ground with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle
and the president. After all, every new Congress represents a fresh
start
an opportunity to address the challenges we face as a nation and
seek to represent the American people and our communities to the best
of our ability.
No one expects
that Congress and President Obama will find agreement on every little
issue or every big challenge. But we ought to expect a good faith
effort. Republicans have said we hope to move sooner rather than later on
items that could or should receive bipartisan support and will help
more Americans find jobs. These include approval of the Keystone XL
Pipeline as well as the elimination of certain provisions within
Obamacare that are standing in the way of more hiring and more work
opportunities
particularly for our veterans. Again, these ought to receive
relatively strong bipartisan support, and we hope the president will find
a willingness to work with us on these sound policies and
others.
In the House Budget Committee,
where I will now serve as Chair, we will begin laying the ground work
for our budget resolution. This is a process that will develop over the
next few months as we look to craft a plan that is balanced and, as
Ive said before, speaks to the priorities of our diverse country, to
our fiscal realities and our economic aspirations, to our national
security concerns and the personal financial security of American
families.
There is much work to be
done. But, as always, there are many opportunities to build a stronger,
more prosperous nation
one that supports and nurtures the hopes and
dreams of the American people today and in the years to
come.
