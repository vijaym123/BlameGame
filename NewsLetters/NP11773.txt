Dear
Neighbor,
Mark Twain once said, History doesnt repeat itself but it does rhyme.
Well, Russia is quite the poet these days. To put it simply, Russia
still views the world as a Cold War chessboard, and Vladimir Putin
stands on-guard, ready to cease an opportunity with any country in order to
expand his influence. Thats exactly what he saw with Ukraine years
ago when he started to apply economic pressure to tilt the country
towards his sphere of influence. He made another move this past week when
he ordered 6,000 Russian troops into Ukraine. The parallels between
Putins aggression and Hitlers in the 1930s are
stark.
The turmoil in Ukraine has unfolded quickly in the past few
months. In November, the Ukrainian government rejected a European
Union Association Agreement, under pressure from Russia. Its citizens
long-standing dream to become part of Europe was dismissed. Protests
erupted and, desperate for control, the pro-Putin regime enacted severe
new anti-protest laws. This led to violence, kidnappings, and beatings.
On February 22, Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovych fled Ukraine,
running to Russia for safe-harbor. Eager for control, Putin sent in
Russian troops under the pretense of helping the people of Crimea, a
peninsula located in southern Ukraine. Russia now demands surrender from
Ukraine or else.
Putin believes he can act
like the 21 st
Century Hitler because Ukraine depends on
Russia to survive. He is correct. Russia has an economic stranglehold
around Ukraine and much of Eastern Europe. 70% of Ukraines gas supply
comes from Russia, making it almost totally dependent on the Kremlin.
Russia uses its gas exports as a weapon, twice turning off the fuel to
Ukraine in the last 10 years. I was in the Ukraine in the dead of
winter when Russia turned off the gas
it was freezing cold. The
Ukrainian people cannot survive if Russia permanently flips the switch on its
gas supply. This must stop now. Thats why I've introduced 2 bills
today:
1.
The FREE Act, or the
Fight Russian Energy Exploitation Act,
would expedite approval of
all permits to export LNG from the U.S. to Ukraine, all former Soviet
nations and members of the European Union. We can help end Russias
economic and dictatorial monopoly and pivot Eastern Europe to the
West.
2.
The Russia Visa Sanctions Act , which would
deny the visas or admission of Russian government officials into the
U.S. until its military invasion of Ukraine has ceased and Russia
respects the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of
Ukraine.
In addition, the U.S. should pursue
economic sanctions and explore other diplomatic solutions, such as not
attending the G8 summit scheduled to take place in Sochi, Russia; holding
a G7 summit without Russia, and postponing any government organized
trade delegations planned for Russia in the near
future.
The world must make clear that Ukraine is not President
Putins chess piece in a larger game of brinkmanship.
The
Ukrainian people have the right to freedom and autonomy, and they should not
be held back from joining a free, economically prosperous
West.
I want to hear your thoughts. Send me an e-mail
or post your thoughts on
Facebook
or
Twitter . And thats just the way it
is.

P.S. - In other news, Sen. Rand Paul and I recently
introduced the
Constitutional Check and Balance Act
(H.R.
4091). Time and time again, weve seen the Administration treat
current law as a mere suggestion. This bill would authorize Members of
Congress to file a lawsuit against the Administration when it fails to
enforce the laws. It all goes back to the simple principle that we learned
in civics: the system of checks and balances. Its time for Congress
to hold the Executive Branch accountable when it ignores the
Constitution and our laws.
