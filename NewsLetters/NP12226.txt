Friends,
I've had a great
week touring local businesses and meeting with community leaders and
constituents.
I live here and commute to Washington because I
understand how important it is to be connected to our community. I even
had the chance to stop by the grand opening of Concord's Sea Life
Aquarium, an attraction that has created jobs in our district, expanded
what is already the largest tourist attraction in N.C., and strengthened
our local economy. It was great to have the opportunity to meet with
some of our entrepreneurs and small business owners to see firsthand
the challenges and prospects our job-creators are
facing.
As your Representative, my top three priorities are jobs,
jobs, and jobs.
My main focus on this tour was to gain a better
understanding of how Washington's policies are affecting the economic
growth and future outlook of the manufacturing community. I had the
opportunity to visit some of our most promising local businesses to
discuss ideas that will encourage expansion and hiring.
I am so
impressed by the work going on at all of the facilities I visited and the
positive impact each one has on our local economies.
Unfortunately, these businesses struggle as they are forced to comply with
more rules, more paperwork and more red tape coming out of
Washington.
The Obama Administration has continuously relied upon
executive power to pass
nearly 300 economically significant
regulations , putting the burden on our economy and job creators and
pocketing more of American families' hard-earned money.
I'm
working to put an end to these job-killing regulations.
Last
session, the House passed dozens of pro-growth jobs bills like the
Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS)
Act
(H.R. 367), which will require any rule or regulation with an
economic impact of $100 million or more to come before Congress for a
vote before taking effect.
The REINS Act will prevent our
bloated bureaucracy from crushing our small businesses with unnecessary
costs and allow them to grow, expand and hire
people.
During my jobs tour, I also heard the need for more
efficient workforce training programs and more high-skilled workers.
Every year, $18 billion of your hard-earned taxpayer dollars are
spent on job-training programs, but only a fraction of workers receive and
complete the training necessary to get jobs. In fact, nearly 50% of
the people who go through the federal job training programs don't
complete the program with the needed skills.
That failure rate is
unacceptable.
The House passed the
Supporting
Knowledge and Investing in Lifelong Skills (SKILLS) Act
(H.R.
803) which will improve the way our job-training programs work. The
SKILLS Act consolidates and streamlines more than 30 separate federally
funded workforce development programs and protects taxpayer dollars by
requiring an independent evaluation of each training program every five
years.
The best part of the SKILLS Act is that it empowers
our job-seekers and gives more control to local
communities.
Unfortunately, both of these common-sense proposals
continue to collect dust on Harry Reid's desk.
I came to Washington
to fight for people, not bureaucrats and politicians.
I know
that the hard-working men and women who spend each day honing their
craft and producing for the local economy understand the needs of their
industry better than the folks in Washington.
I've got a plan
to create jobs, and it starts with getting government off the backs of
our job-creators and returning power to American workers and
entrepreneurs.
See my plan and tell me what you think at
Hudson.House.Gov/JOBS . It's past time for the Senate and the
President to work with Republicans to find common ground and put people
back to
work.
Until next week,
Richard Hudson
Member of Congress
(NC-08)

Success
Story
Recently, a
constituent
called my
Concord office because she was having trouble dealing with the Social
Security Administration (SSA). She applied for disability, but was denied
three times. My staff worked directly with the SSA to expedite her
social security disability hearing. The constituent was issued the needed
benefits a month after her
hearing.
If you need help navigating a federal
agency, please dont hesitate to call our Concord office at
704-786-1612 .
