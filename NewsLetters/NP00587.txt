 Those Social Security benefits added $19.8 million to our economy over the course of the year. Another 1,044 individuals received Supplemental Security Income in 2014, bringing in $7.7 million. That meant a total of $27.5 million from the two national programs, an increase of $1.3 million over 2013. Social Security provides a monthly benefit to workers and their family member, based on the workers covered earnings during his or her lifetime. The Supplemental Security Income program is for those who are old, blind, or disabled and is available to persons in the 50 States, the District of Columbia, andthanks to our Covenant the Northern Mariana Islands. All these benefits help recipients, but they also help fuel our economy. That is why I have and will continue to support congressional efforts to protect and strengthen Social Security.

Nineteen men and women of the Northern Mariana Islands have died in service to their nation during the present conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan alone, so most of us have some direct connection to the fallen we remembered this Memorial Day. In addition to reflecting on those who gave their lives for our freedom, I hope this solemn holiday reminded us all to give our sincerest thanks to the families and loved ones left behind for their own sacrifices and for the support they gave to our heroes.

Along with Chief Judge Ramona V. Manglona and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officer Diane Zedde, I welcomed twenty new citizens into the American family at a naturalization ceremony in the U.S. District Court on May 26th. I reminded them that they join the many of us in the Northern Marianas who were not born U.S. citizens, but who have proudly taken on the responsibilities of citizenship to ensure that the U.S. remains preeminent in the world and a beacon of democracy. Congratulations, citizens!
Protecting refugees from inhumane treatment
Women and children fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries should not be treated as criminals while seeking asylum or refugee status in the United States. That is why I joined 135 of my colleagues in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson
urging an end to the detention of families in prisons designed for dangerous criminals. The lack of proper medical care for children with serious health needs in these facilities is particularly troubling and out of step with our nations long history of compassionate response to humanitarian crises. We believe DHS has the capacity both to ensure public safety and at the same time maintain our standards of human decency.
