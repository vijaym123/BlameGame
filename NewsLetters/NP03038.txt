Well, its time for our boarding pass. Ive got the boarding pass in
my pocket and I am ready to catch my flight.
We just had our
last vote and passed
H.R. 351, the LNG Permitting
Certainty and Transparency Act
by a vote of 277-133 ( See Roll Call #50 ).
This bill requires the Department
of Energy to issue a final decision on applications to export liquid
natural gas within 30 days of conclusion.
This bill will ensure
exports to our allies do not have unnecessary delays therefore,
expediting the approval of liquefied natural gas exports.
LNG Exports
will create approximately 45,000 jobs and building our economy while
letting our natural gas producers
compete.
On Monday, January 26, 2015, and Tuesday, January 27,
2015, the House passed 12 bills ( see links below ) to combat human
trafficking with overwhelming bipartisan support.
In the United
States, human trafficking is estimated to be a $9.8 billion industry
that affects over 300,000 children.
Human trafficking is the
fastest-growing business of organized crime and the third-largest
criminal enterprise in the world.
Texas is an epicenter of human
trafficking and these bills will help us deal with human trafficking and
come down on those who are trafficking human
beings.
On Tuesday, January 27, 2015,
we
remembered
those who were liberated 70 years ago in
Auschwitz-Birkenau. We must never forget the survivors stories and remind the world to
never allow a repeat of the crimes of the
Holocaust.
Thats our boarding pass and Ill see all you folks
in Texas.
I get back to D.C. next Monday for another busy
week.
