Greetings from Washington D.C.!
This last week was one of important dialogues on poverty, race, and inequality in America. I remain hopeful and will continue to fight for a level playing field for all.
Please take a few minutes to read my update on happenings in Congress as well as events in the district over the next few weeks:
