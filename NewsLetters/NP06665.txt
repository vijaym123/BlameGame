Dear
David,
A preliminary injunction granted today by
U.S. District Court Judge Peter C. Economus restores early voting
days in Ohio that had been eliminated by the Ohio Legislature and state
directive.
In his decision, the judge found that these voting
law changes were unconstitutional and violated the Voting Rights Act of
1965.
I am ecstatic voting opportunities have
been restored to the people of Ohio.
By reducing early voting days
and hours and eliminating Golden Week
a one-week period in which
voters can register and vote at the same time the Ohio Legislature made
it harder for thousands of Ohioans to access the ballot box.
Moreover, these changes had a disparate, negative impact on some voters but
not others.
No democracy should seek to reduce voter
participation.
By granting a preliminary injunction, U.S. District Court
Judge Peter Economus has reversed the potential harm that unjust Ohio laws
and regulations would have caused and restored integrity to the
electoral process in time for the 2014 election.
