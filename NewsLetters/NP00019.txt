House votes 391-0 to urge Iran to release jailed Americans

Strengthening Health Care for All Americans
This week, the Republican House took action to improve health care with a repeal of Obamacare's medical device tax. This legislation, which I cosponsored, would lower the cost of medical devices for patients, and would also reverse the loss of more than 30,000 jobs that are directly related to this destructive tax.
Discussing the importance of strengthening Medicare with Paul Salles, President and CEO of the Louisiana Hospital Association, which provides support to nearly 100,000 Louisiana hospital employees as they care for those in our communities.
I also reaffirmed my commitment to fight for Louisiana senior citizens when I was honored with the 2015 Medicare Part D Patient Access Champion Award in Metairie yesterday. Louisiana seniors rely on vital programs like Medicare Part D to receive the quality health care they deserve. I am proud to fight for improved, structurally-sound, and patient-centered policies that promote the best health care options and choices.

Standing Up For Hostages Held By Iran
By a vote of 391-0, the House has passed a resolution calling on Iran to immediately release the three United States citizens that it holds, as well as provide all known information on any United States citizens that have disappeared within its borders. Iran's totalitarian regime continues to be an irresponsible actor in the global community and is destabilizing an already volatile region of the world. This resolution demands accountability from a habitual violator of human rights. As the House passes this resolution, American Jason Rezaian is being subjected to a secret trial based on trumped up charges. This is unacceptable. The freedom of these American hostages is long overdue and should be granted without delay, particularly as Iran is in the process of developing nuclear weapons and President Obama is considering softening sanctions against Iran.
It is an honor to represent you in Congress. For more information please visit my
