Combating Trafficking Wherever it Exists
Human and sex trafficking are some of the most atrocious crimes our
society is facing today. It is modern-day slavery, plain and simple,
yet the issue and its victims all too often remain in the shadows. Many
folks don't even realize it's happening in their own backyards,
including right here in North Dakota, where this growing threat is
having a profound impact on families and communities. We must not turn
our backs and say this can't happen here - it does and it is time to go
after traffickers and purchasers while making sure we provide a way out
and are offering the necessary services for victims. That's why I've
been fighting back.
In the Senate, I've been working to combat human trafficking,
introducing Safe Harbor legislation with Senator Amy Klobuchar from
Minnesota that would make sure survivors are treated as victims, not
criminals, when they come into contact with law enforcement and the
court system. It would also look at developing a comprehensive national
strategy to address human trafficking, something that is long overdue.
Over the past year and a half, I've also held Senate Committee
hearings, hosted trainings with folks across North Dakota, and met with
community leaders and advocates in the state and across the country to
shine a light on the horrific crimes being committed in our own
backyard.
See below to view a recent article, part of Forum News Service's
extensive "Trafficked Report"
series, about what I'm doing in the Senate to
combat human trafficking in North Dakota and throughout the country.
Last Sunday - National Human Trafficking Awareness Day - I also helped
lead a panel discussion in Fargo on the realities of human and sex
trafficking in North Dakota and what law enforcement, local advocates,
and elected officials are doing to eradicate these crimes.
Raising awareness of and fighting back against the scourge of human and
sex trafficking isn't always easy, but it's something we have to do -
together to keep our communities strong and safe. I hope you'll join me
in these efforts as we seek to improve lives and communities and stamp
out trafficking wherever it exists.
Forum News Service: Heitkamp, Klobuchar team up to battle human
trafficking
By Amy Dalrymple
WASHINGTON - As local police chiefs and sheriffs gathered in
Minot to discuss increased crime in North Dakota's Oil Patch, U.S. Sen.
Heidi Heitkamp interjected when one cited a spike in prostitution.
That may be human trafficking, she said.
"Understand that maybe behind that, what you're seeing as
prostitution is some of the worst victimization that's out there. There
may be somebody who is in fact being trafficked, forced to do this
against their will," said Heitkamp, D-N.D.
Raising awareness of human trafficking in her state while also
working to advance federal legislation to combat modern-day slavery has
been a major focus for Heitkamp, a former North Dakota attorney
general.
Working closely with her is U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of
Minnesota, another Democrat who also comes from a law enforcement
background. In a joint interview with Forum News Service in Heitkamp's
Washington office, the senators talked about their passion for an issue
that knows no state boundaries.
"This is an example of how Minnesota and North Dakota can work
together," Klobuchar said. Both have teamed with Cindy McCain, wife of
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and a national leader on anti-trafficking
issues. The three visited Mexico last year to learn how officials there
are addressing trafficking.
Klobuchar, a former top Hennepin County prosecutor, said it
became clear to her that changes needed to be made to human trafficking
laws while her office attempted to prosecute sex rings.
Often the victims would recant their stories, saying they were
scared of their pimp.
"Pretty soon you realized this isn't working very well. We're
not really, as a country, going after the people that are really doing
these crimes," Klobuchar said.
Following efforts to raise awareness in the state, Minnesota
adopted a Safe Harbor law, ensuring that minor victims of sex
trafficking are treated as such, not as criminals.
"The only way you're going to be able to build a case against
their pimp, someone running a sex trafficking ring, is if you have a
victim who's really able to tell the whole story," Klobuchar said.
Now, one federal initiative Klobuchar and Heitkamp are working
to advance would push all states to adopt Safe Harbor laws. That bill
did not pass last year, but it did elevate the importance of the issue.
Many states, including North Dakota, are now moving to adopt Safe
Harbor laws on their own.
They also support federal legislation aimed at increasing
penalties for traffickers, providing more services to domestic sex
trafficking victims and providing funding for runaway and homeless
youth programs.
More work needs to be done in both states, they say, although
Heitkamp said North Dakota is further behind.
"We've got a long way to go compared to Minnesota," Heitkamp
said. "Now it's our turn to pick up the ball, to be as aggressive as
Minnesota and learn from them as well."
Heitkamp and Klobuchar share concerns about the threat of sex
trafficking facing Native American populations in their states.
"It makes sense when you have people who are very poor who are
in a concentrated area, that you're going to see more of this
trafficking," Klobuchar said. "It's really one of the saddest things to
see these proud, Native American families have to deal with the fact
that their child is a victim of sex trafficking."
In addition to sex trafficking, Heitkamp also reminds people
that the potential for labor trafficking, particularly in the Bakken
where workers are in high-demand, needs attention, too. In North
Dakota, Heitkamp would like to see more funding invested for training
of law enforcement, victim service providers and others. She'd also
like to see resources dedicated to a shelter and helping victims.
"The best a lot of our domestic violence shelters can do in the
Oil Patch is a bus ticket. That's not an answer," Heitkamp said.
"Housing prices are so high, it's just really hard to help people
transition into a safe place. We really need to listen to what the
victim advocates are saying they need in western North Dakota, not just
on trafficking, but all crimes against women."
After touring programs such as Breaking Free and 180 Degrees in
Minnesota, Heitkamp said it gives her hope knowing that helping
sexually exploited women and girls leave the life is possible with the
right long-term programs.
"I'm so encouraged that you can, in fact, with a lot of hard
work, help people through recovery," Heitkamp said.

Combating

Human

It

Many

don't

in
their

including
right
here
in
North
Dakota,
where
this
growing
threat
is

a
profound

on
families
and

We

WASHINGTON
&#8211;
As

&#8220;Understand

what
you&#8217;re
seeing
as

is
some
of
the
worst
victimization
that&#8217;s
out

There
may
be
somebody
who
is
in
fact
being
trafficked,
forced
to
do
this
against
their
will,&#8221;
said
Heitkamp,
D-N.D.
Raising
awareness
of
human
trafficking
in
her
state
while
also
working
to
advance
federal
legislation
to
combat
modern-day
slavery
has
been
a
major
focus
for
Heitkamp,
a
former
North
Dakota
attorney
general.
Working
closely
with
her
is
U.S.
Sen.
Amy
Klobuchar
of
Minnesota,
another
Democrat
who
also
comes
from
a
law
enforcement
background.
In
a
joint
interview
with
Forum
News
Service
in
Heitkamp&#8217;s
Washington
office,
the
senators
talked
about
their
passion
for
an
issue
that
knows
no
state
boundaries.
&#8220;This
is
an
example
of
how
Minnesota
and
North
Dakota
can
work
together,&#8221;
Klobuchar
said.
Both
have
teamed
with
Cindy
McCain,
wife
of
Sen.
John
McCain,
R-Ariz.,
and
a
national
leader
on
anti-trafficking
issues.
The
three
visited
Mexico
last
year
to
learn
how
officials
there
are
addressing
trafficking.
Klobuchar,
a
former
top
Hennepin
County
prosecutor,
said
it
became
clear
to
her
that
changes
needed
to
be
made
to
human
trafficking
laws
while
her
office
attempted
to
prosecute
sex
rings.
Often
the
victims
would
recant
their
stories,
saying
they
were
scared
of
their
pimp.
&#8220;Pretty
soon
you
realized
this
isn&#8217;t
working
very
well.
We&#8217;re
not
really,
as
a
country,
going
after
the
people
that
are
really
doing
these
crimes,&#8221;
Klobuchar
said.
Following
efforts
to
raise
awareness
in
the
state,
Minnesota
adopted
a
Safe
Harbor
law,
ensuring
that
minor
victims
of
sex
trafficking
are
treated
as
such,
not
as
criminals.
&#8220;The
only
way
you&#8217;re
going
to
be
able
to
build
a
case
against
their
pimp,
someone
running
a
sex
trafficking
ring,
is
if
you
have
a
victim
who&#8217;s
really
able
to
tell
the
whole
story,&#8221;
Klobuchar
said.
Now,
one
federal
initiative
Klobuchar
and
Heitkamp
are
working
to
advance
would
push
all
states
to
adopt
Safe
Harbor
laws.
That
bill
did
not
pass
last
year,
but
it
did
elevate
the
importance
of
the
issue.
Many
states,
including
North
Dakota,
are
now
moving
to
adopt
Safe
Harbor
laws
on
their
own.
They
also
support
federal
legislation
aimed
at
increasing
penalties
for
traffickers,
providing
more
services
to
domestic
sex
trafficking
victims
and
providing
funding
for
runaway
and
homeless
youth
programs.
More
work
needs
to
be
done
in
both
states,
they
say,
although
Heitkamp
said
North
Dakota
is
further
behind.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve
got
a
long
way
to
go
compared
to
Minnesota,&#8221;
Heitkamp
said.
&#8220;Now
it&#8217;s
our
turn
to
pick
up
the
ball,
to
be
as
aggressive
as
Minnesota
and
learn
from
them
as
well.&#8221;
Heitkamp
and
Klobuchar
share
concerns
about
the
threat
of
sex
trafficking
facing
Native
American
populations
in
their
states.
&#8220;It
makes
sense
when
you
have
people
who
are
very
poor
who
are
in
a
concentrated
area,
that
you&#8217;re
going
to
see
more
of
this
trafficking,&#8221;
Klobuchar
said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s
really
one
of
the
saddest
things
to
see
these
proud,
Native
American
families
have
to
deal
with
the
fact
that
their
child
is
a
victim
of
sex
trafficking.&#8221;
In
addition
to
sex
trafficking,
Heitkamp
also
reminds
people
that
the
potential
for
labor
trafficking,
particularly
in
the
Bakken
where
workers
are
in
high-demand,
needs
attention,
too.
In
North
Dakota,
Heitkamp
would
like
to
see
more
funding
invested
for
training
of
law
enforcement,
victim
service
providers
and
others.
She&#8217;d
also
like
to
see
resources
dedicated
to
a
shelter
and
helping
victims.
&#8220;The
best
a
lot
of
our
domestic
violence
shelters
can
do
in
the
Oil
Patch
is
a
bus
ticket.
That&#8217;s
not
an
answer,&#8221;
Heitkamp
said.
&#8220;Housing
prices
are
so
high,
it&#8217;s
just
really
hard
to
help
people
transition
into
a
safe
place.
We
really
need
to
listen
to
what
the
victim
advocates
are
saying
they
need
in
western
North
Dakota,
not
just
on
trafficking,
but
all
crimes
against
women.&#8221;
After
touring
programs
such
as
Breaking
Free
and
180
Degrees
in
Minnesota,
Heitkamp
said
it
gives
her
hope
knowing
that
helping
sexually
exploited
women
and
girls
leave
the
life
is
possible
with
the
right
long-term
programs.
&#8220;I&#8217;m
so
encouraged
that
you
can,
in
fact,
with
a
lot
of
hard
work,
help
people
through
recovery,&#8221;
Heitkamp
said.
