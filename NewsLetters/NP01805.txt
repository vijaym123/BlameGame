Patients Should Be Able to Afford
Life-Saving Drugs
In America today, we have
life-saving drugs that treat debilitating diseases such as multiple
sclerosis, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Unfortunately, a patient in
need may have trouble paying for these miracle cures, even if they have
insurance. Some patients face out-of-pocket costs in the hundreds of
thousands of dollars.
That is why I re-introduced
bipartisan legislation this week to give patients and their family peace of
mind about paying for their treatment. The Patients Access to Treatment
Act (PATA) would make these specialty drugs affordable for all, with
predictable co-pays clear costs.
We held a press conference
with the Arthritis Foundation, the American College of Rheumatology,
and a young woman named Alexis treating her lupus with a specialty
drug, to announce the legislation. Here I am with Rep. Lois Capps (D-CA),
and Alexis.
Strengthening
Medicare
On Thursday, the House overwhelmingly passed bipartisan
legislation to protect access for seniors, save billions of dollars,
and strengthen Medicare. I was proud to support this reform that brought
Democrats and Republicans together to solve a real problem for
Americas seniors.
For too long, the sustainable growth rate,
which would cause destructive cuts to payments for Medicare doctors,
has hung over seniors and their care providers. With the legislation
passed this week, that threat is removed and seniors can have peace of
mind that Medicare will be there for them.
We Must
Combat Prescription Drug Abuse
This week, the
Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee held a hearing on
prescription drug abuse and what the federal government can do to combat it.
Watch my opening remarks here:
One of the effective programs we have encouraged is the High
Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program. I led a letter to
the Appropriations Committee to ensure this successful program receives
full funding in 2016. Read the letter

Visitors in Washington
We
had another great week of visitors to our DC office. It is always a
pleasure to see so many West Virginians make the trek to say hello and
petition their government. One of our guests this week was the West
Virginia Bankers Association:
Mountaineers Finale Update
The Mountaineers had a
great basketball season, and all their fans should be thankful. After
a terrific regular season, especially the dramatic finish over Kansas,
they made it out of the first weekend of March Madness and gave their
fans a season to be proud of. Looking forward to next season
already!
Have a great week,
David
