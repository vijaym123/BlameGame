Dear
Friend,
It seems that not a day goes by that I don't hear from someone who is
concerned about the effects of the Obama Administration's scandals.
Between the unanswered questions we still have about
Benghazi , and the
increasingly perplexing attitudes of the people at the
IRS
who refuse to answer questions about
their political targeting practices, my colleagues and I on the House
Oversight and Government Reform Committee have had our work cut out
for us.
I was asked to provide a quick update on our
investigations into these issues on FOX News last week.
Here's what I had to
say :
A few days later, the Oversight Committee heard
from the director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and
Explosives.
I've been looking into what happened with one of the
storefront operations they'd been running in Atlanta, called ATL Blaze.
Especially in the wake of Operation Fast and Furious, we have to
make sure our law enforcement agencies are cooperating and
communicating fully.
That didn't happen in Atlanta.
Learn more about what
happened.
As always, I welcome
your feedback
on these issues or any
others.
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of Congress
Welcoming the White County 9th
Grade Academy
Congressman
Collins met up with the 9th Grade Academy students visiting from White
County at the Lincoln Memorial during their trip to
Washington.
If you're coming to Washington this spring or summer, please let
us know by calling our office at 202-225-9893. We'd love to see
you!
