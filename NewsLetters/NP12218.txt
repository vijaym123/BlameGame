Dear Friend-
Next week, I will be testifying in front of the House Judiciary
Committee regarding the President's duty to faithfully execute the law
and the need to enact my Faithful Execution of the Law Act.
As I
prepared my testimony I was reminded of the maxim that ours is a
"government of laws, not of men."
This phrase was included in the
Massachusetts state constitution of 1780 by John Adams, who believed
(as the framers of the U.S. Constitution believed when they met in
Philadelphia in 1787) that allowing power to be accumulated in a single
branch of government was dangerous for liberty.
At the end of the day,
concepts such as the rule of law and separation of powers do not exist
simply to provide students with something to study in civics class;
instead, faithfulness to these principles is what helps ensure that the
liberty of the people will be respected.
In what should not come as a surprise to anyone, a recent report
from a fellow at the American Enterprise
institute estimates that American taxpayers will be forced to pony up
as much as $450 million to mitigate the losses incurred by one insurer
in the ACA health insurance exchanges. This is due to a provision in
the Obama health law that specifically earmarks taxpayer dollars for
this purpose.
CBO's estimate that this provision would net money to
the government doesn't seem to be panning out. The bottom line is that
taxpayers shouldn't be bailing out insurance companies at all.
Incredibly, as ObamaCare uses taxpayer money for bailouts and as the
administration continues to grant special relief to big businesses and
labor unions, it is becoming clear that a big loser in the whole
ObamaCare drama will be Medicare beneficiaries, especially those
seniors who choose Medicare Advantage plans.
Because the government is
cutting Medicare Advantage
to pay for
ObamaCare, millions of seniors will be facing higher costs, less access
to physicians, cancelled plans, and reduced benefits. Yesterday, House
Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that he plans to pursue
legislative remedies to protect seniors from the harmful effects of
ObamaCare.
Seniors should not have to see their health care decline so
that an unpopular law like ObamaCare can be propped up.
Rep. DeSantis meeting with the FL-06 Veterans Advisory Board, composed
of veteran representatives from throughout the district, to discuss
issues important to them.
As much of the world has been cheering for their countrymen and women
as they compete at the Winter Olympics in Sochi, there has been violent
unrest in several countries across the globe.
My thoughts and prayers are with the people of Ukraine as they fight
against authoritarianism and in support of freedom. The protestors do
not want to live under a modern day iron curtain controlled by Russian
strongman Vladimir Putin, but instead wish to join the West and to live
in a free society. They are bravely fighting the good fight against
corrupted and dictatorial rulers.
In Venezuela, the government is cracking down on protesters who reject
the policies of the nation's Havana-directed socialist rules.
The
corrupting effects of socialism have destroyed the Venezuelan economy
and have limited freedom and opportunity for her people. I condemn
President Nicols Maduro for the violent suppression of peaceful
protests, a technique of repression that he learned from his mentors in
the Castro regime. Freedom of speech is a fundamental human right, and
I stand with the people of Venezuela as they work to create a better
future.

hesitate to contact either my Washington, DC or Port Orange office

Dear
Friend&#8211;
Next
week,
I
will
be
testifying
in
front
of
the
House
Judiciary
Committee
regarding
the
President's
duty
to
faithfully
execute
the
law
and
the
need
to
enact
my
Faithful
Execution
of
the
Law
Act.
As
I
prepared
my
testimony
I
was
reminded
of
the
maxim
that
ours
is
a
"government
of
laws,
not
of
men."
This
phrase
was
included
in
the
Massachusetts
state
constitution
of
1780
by
John
Adams,
who
believed
(as
the
framers
of
the
U.S.
Constitution
believed
when
they
met
in
Philadelphia
in
1787)
that
allowing
power
to
be
accumulated
in
a
single
branch
of
government
was
dangerous
for
liberty.
At
the
end
of
the
day,
concepts
such
as
the
rule
of
law
and
separation
of
powers
do
not
exist
simply
to
provide
students
with
something
to
study
in
civics
class;
instead,
faithfulness
to
these
principles
is
what
helps
ensure
that
the
liberty
of
the
people
will
be
respected.
In
what
should
not
come
as
a
surprise
to
anyone,
a
recent
report
from
a
fellow
at
the
American
Enterprise
institute
estimates
that
American
taxpayers
will
be
forced
to
pony
up
as
much
as
$450
million
to
mitigate
the
losses
incurred
by
one
insurer
in
the
ACA
health
insurance
exchanges.
This
is
due
to
a
provision
in
the
Obama
health
law
that
specifically
earmarks
taxpayer
dollars
for
this
purpose.
CBO's
estimate
that
this
provision
would
net
money
to
the
government
doesn't
seem
to
be
panning
out.
The
bottom
line
is
that
taxpayers
shouldn't
be
bailing
out
insurance
companies
at
all.
Incredibly,
as
ObamaCare
uses
taxpayer
money
for
bailouts
and
as
the
administration
continues
to
grant
special
relief
to
big
businesses
and
labor
unions,
it
is
becoming
clear
that
a
big
loser
in
the
whole
ObamaCare
drama
will
be
Medicare
beneficiaries,
especially
those
seniors
who
choose
Medicare
Advantage
plans.
Because
the
government
is
cutting
Medicare
Advantage
to
pay
for
ObamaCare,
millions
of
seniors
will
be
facing
higher
costs,
less
access
to
physicians,
cancelled
plans,
and
reduced
benefits.
Yesterday,
House
Majority
Leader
Eric
Cantor
announced
that
he
plans
to
pursue
legislative
remedies
to
protect
seniors
from
the
harmful
effects
of
ObamaCare.
Seniors
should
not
have
to
see
their
health
care
decline
so
that
an
unpopular
law
like
ObamaCare
can
be
propped
up.
Rep.
DeSantis
meeting
with
the
FL-06
Veterans
Advisory
Board,
composed
of
veteran
representatives
from
throughout
the
district,
to
discuss
issues
important
to
them.
As
much
of
the
world
has
been
cheering
for
their
countrymen
and
women
as
they
compete
at
the
Winter
Olympics
in
Sochi,
there
has
been
violent
unrest
in
several
countries
across
the
globe.
My
thoughts
and
prayers
are
with
the
people
of
Ukraine
as
they
fight
against
authoritarianism
and
in
support
of
freedom.
The
protestors
do
not
want
to
live
under
a
modern
day
iron
curtain
controlled
by
Russian
strongman
Vladimir
Putin,
but
instead
wish
to
join
the
West
and
to
live
in
a
free
society.
They
are
bravely
fighting
the
good
fight
against
corrupted
and
dictatorial
rulers.
In
Venezuela,
the
government
is
cracking
down
on
protesters
who
reject
the
policies
of
the
nation&#8217;s
Havana-directed
socialist
rules.
The
corrupting
effects
of
socialism
have
destroyed
the
Venezuelan
economy
and
have
limited
freedom
and
opportunity
for
her
people.
I
condemn
President
Nicol&#225;s
Maduro
for
the
violent
suppression
of
peaceful
protests,
a
technique
of
repression
that
he
learned
from
his
mentors
in
the
Castro
regime.
Freedom
of
speech
is
a
fundamental
human
right,
and
I
stand
with
the
people
of
Venezuela
as
they
work
to
create
a
better
future.
