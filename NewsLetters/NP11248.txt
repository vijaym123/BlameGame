Dear Friend,
Yesterday, I hosted a terrific women's economic agenda forum at
Manchester Community College, and I was so pleased to have Connecticut
Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, NH House Speaker Terie Norelli, and NH
Senate Minority Leader Sylvia Larsen with me on the panel. MaryAnn
Manoogian of the Center for Women's Business Advancement at Southern
New Hampshire University moderated, and we discussed the women's
economic agenda titled, "When Women Succeed, America Succeeds."
Issues
included pay equity, balancing work and family, childcare, schools, and
retirement.
Please read WMUR's coverage of the event below.
I am
committed to supporting legislation that supports women, men, and
families.
Best Wishes,
Carol
Lawmakers meet in Manchester to discuss important role of
working women
Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, local lawmakers attend meeting

MANCHESTER, N.H. -From paycheck equality to minimum wage, 2014 is a
year headlined by concerns of women in the workforce.
On Friday, students at Manchester Community College were given a
firsthand account of the importance of the role they play and the
challenges that women still face.
Seventeen years ago, Connecticut Rep. Rosa Delauro first introduced a
bill addressing paycheck equity, and now that New Hampshire is on the
verge of passing its own law, she said she just had to join the meeting.
"The fact of the matter is women, no matter what job they are in, are
being paid 77 cents on the dollar, and in this congressional district
is 75 cents," said Delauro.
Flanked by Rep. Carol Shea-Porter and lawmakers in the New Hampshire
House and Senate, a rock-solid consensus can be found that in 2014,
women are a driving economic force.
"Women, just like men, take their paychecks and spend them in the
community, so small businesses have an interest in this as well," said
Shea-Porter.
"When we talk about the minimum wage, if we were to raise the minimum
wage to $10.10 an hour, that would impact thousands of women across
this country that are working really hard to lift their families out of
poverty," said Rep. Terie Norelli, New Hampshire's House Speaker.
Add to that the cost of child care, to access to affordable health
care, and they are all issues that are tied to the umbrella of women in
the workplace.
New Hampshire, of course, is recognized for the disproportionate amount
of women who lead our state both in Washington and in Concord.
"We hope we get to a point where we don't have to keep celebrating
gender equality. It should be a normal process of our lives," said Sen.
Sylvia Larsen, the minority leader in the State Senate.
There are opposing political views, gender notwithstanding, but in
2014, it's clear the issues facing women will not go without a
collective voice.

&#8212;From

2014
is
a

&#8220;The

is
women,
no

what
job
they
are
in,
are
being
paid
77

in

is
75

said
Delauro.
Flanked

a

if

raise
the

Add
to
that
the
