Dear Friend,

A day long coming
For all the challenges faced by our
nation, spending the week in the most beautiful congressional district
in the country leaves me revived and hopeful.
I hosted town
halls at Priest Lake, Bonners Ferry, Moscow, Lewiston and Cottonwood. On
Monday, Ill be in Emmett, on Tuesday, Cascade. The following week,
well have our final town halls of the August break in Nampa, Aug. 26,
and Meridian, Aug. 27. Ill have a summary of what I learned in a later
edition of the newsletter.
Today, Id like to focus on this
weeks highlight:
The long overdue recognition of a modest and
courageous American soldier, Sgt. Michael Atwell of
Osburn.
Atwell was just 18 years old when he put himself in the line of enemy fire
during the Battle of Dak To in 1967, keeping the enemy at bay during
a three-day battle. Now 65, he has finally been awarded the Silver
Star
the militarys third-highest decoration for valor.
Atwell
wouldnt have received the honor absent the intervention of two men
who served with him as they faced the North Vietnamese Army at Hill 875.
At a reunion in 2011, Col. Ron Leonard and Maj. Larry Moore decided
to petition the Army for the medal.
On Wednesday at the
American Legion Hall in Post Falls, I helped present the award, along with an
American Flag flown over the Capitol.
It is at last time to recognize this
soldiers extraordinary courage and valor, said Leonard, who traveled to
the ceremony from Fairfax Station, Va.
This day has been long
coming, said Moore, of Knoxville, Tenn. Mike Atwell is a brave
soldier.
Moore and Leonard described Atwell as quiet and
effective. Accepting the award, Atwell was brief:
Im not going to say a
lot. We had a lot of good people. This Silver Star is for all of them
couldnt have done it without them.
Then, the three men
hugged. It was a moment that brought tears for me and many in the
audience. The story made the Coeur dAlene Press, Spokesman Review online
and KIVI-TV.
During the Nov. 20 to Nov. 23, 1967, battle Atwell was operating from
an exposed forward position. He delivered continuous devastating fire
on the enemy, according to the Army citation. Atwell endured wave
after wave of enemy counterattackswhich ultimately allowed friendly
forces to secure Hill 875.
Private First Class Atwells
gallantry in action is in keeping with the finest traditions of military
service and reflects great credit upon himself, the 503d Airborne Infantry
Brigade and the United States Army, says the citation. Atwells
Company B was outnumbered by a ratio of 7-to-1.
After a 6-year
Army Career, Atwell worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. His
postings included Mountain Home Air Force Base and the Eastern
Environmental Office in Kellogg. He was twice deployed to Iraq and twice to
Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina. Atwell retired from the Corps in
2011.
Col. Leonard and Maj. Moore began collecting records about the
Battle of Dak To in 2011, submitting an application for the award to
the Army in 2012. Early in 2013, they brought the matter to my office.
Our expert on veterans affairs, Tori Shockey, helped revise the
application three times. On June 26, 2014, Secretary of the Army John
McHugh approved the award.
My highest priority as your
representative is to ensure your government is responsive. Sgt. Atwells story is
an example of how we can help.
