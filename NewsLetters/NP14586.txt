Dear Friends,
Since going live on October 1, 2013, healthcare.gov has been a disaster. Whether you want to call it a glitch or a complete unpreparedness, the websites problems are unacceptable. The Congress was told repeatedly the site would be ready, but that clearly was not the case and we need to know what happened.
I joined with Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-SC) and Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) to request information from the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Kathleen Sebelius, about how healthcare.gov was tested and clarification for her recent comments blaming House Republicans for the website's failures. We are hopeful that Secretary Sebelius will provide meaningful and honest answers to the American people.

Text of the letter:
October 28, 2013
The Honorable Kathleen Sebelius
U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services
200 Independence Avenue, S.W.
Washington, DC
20201
Dear Secretary Sebelius:
You have made a number of curious statements during your career in public life. Time and space do not allow for a full inventory.
Most recently you are quoted as saying the abysmal Obamacare rolloutfor which you had three years and more than $500,000,000 to prepare, test, and perfectwas the fault of House Republicans and the government shutdown.
If memory serves, Obamacare was signed into law in March of 2010, when Republicans controlled precisely no branch of government.
At a an event in Austin, Texas, on October 25 th , you said: "In an ideal world, there would have been a lot more testing . . . but we did not have the luxury of that with a law that says 'it's go time on October 1 st .'" You thenand in the interest of clarity we will editblame House Republicans and the government shutdown for your failure to provide a workable product.
In light of this newest explanation for the failure to provide a workable product, could you provide some additional clarification of your remarks, particularly by answering the following questions:
1)
When did you first test the website healthcare.gov?
2)
When did you last test the website healthcare.gov prior to October 1, 2013?
3)
Who limited your ability to test the website as often as you judged necessary?
4)
In the "ideal world" you make reference to, how many testings would you have conducted?
5)
What "law" are you referencing that says "it's go time on October 1, 2013"?
6)
Assuming arguendo you are able to cite said law, did you ask for an extension?
7)
Inasmuch as the website launched October 1 and the government shutdown began October 1, how precisely was the website launch affected by the shutdown?
8)
What changes did you make to the website from September 1, 2013, to October 1, 2013?
9)
Who, if anyone other than you, directed those changes be made?
Your prompt response to these questions would be most appreciated and helpful to those of us who eagerly await your testimony before congressional committees of appropriate jurisdiction.
