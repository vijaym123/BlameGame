Senator Johnson made these comments on
Judge William Griesbachs decision to schedule oral arguments in Johnson
v.
OPM:
Although it is not customary in the Eastern District of
Wisconsin, Judge Griesbach has scheduled oral arguments in Johnson v. OPM to
determine whether I have standing to challenge a rule implemented by
the Obama administration.
I am pleased that the court has
recognized that this case presents significant legal issues and important
constitutional questions." Read more

Senator Johnson made the following remarks about his trip
to Ukraine for the inauguration
ceremonies:
I was happy to
join Vice President Biden's delegation at the inauguration of newly
elected Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. American leadership is
crucial to a peaceful and prosperous world. The presence of our elected
officials is an important way of supporting a free Ukraine as it deals
with hostility from an aggressive neighbor, Russia. Read

Tribune: Wisconsin lawmakers' influence on foreign affairs

The
influence of Wisconsins congressional delegation on foreign affairs is

Senator
Johnson made the following comments on the student loan bill S.
2432:
It is unfortunate that government policy has helped drive
costs of a college education higher and enticed our children into
collectively incurring more than $1 trillion in student loan debt.
At
the same time, this administration has burdened our economy with taxes
and regulations that limit the job opportunities available to young
Americans graduating from college." Read more

Making law school free has consequences, it turns
out
Has the deluge of federal aid to students
about $2 trillion worth
since the 1960s
had an unintended effect of increasing the inflation
of college costs? It is certainly at least a possibility. Read

here.
No one told the
aspiring teacher to look before
borrowing
One of the worse unintended
consequences of good intentions in government is the way Washington
has eagerly helped young Americans accumulate huge piles of student
debt. Americans now owe $1.1 trillion
thats more than a million times a
million
for what they borrowed to attend college. Read
