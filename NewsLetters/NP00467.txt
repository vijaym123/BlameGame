Thoughts on Free Trade?
As we work to rebuild the American economy in the 21st Century, Congress could consider a number of trade related proposals in the weeks and months to come. Free trade is a critical component of our free market economy, and expanded trade opportunities grow our economy and create jobs here in America, deepen ties with allies, and let us write the rules of the 21st Century global economy, rather than China or Russia.
&gt;&gt; Take a moment to answer this 6-question survey on free trade &lt;&lt;
As I review possible upcoming legislation, including Trade Promotion Authority, your thoughts are important to me.
Do you think free trade is an important part of a free market economy?
