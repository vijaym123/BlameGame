Days after launching her presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton pledged her support for a Constitutional Amendment to overturn
Citizens United .
David, we couldn&rsquo;t agree more. Sign your name to stand with Hillary against
Citizens United :
SIGN YOUR NAME &gt;&gt;
David -- Citizens United v FEC
is one of the most destructive Supreme Court decisions in our nation&rsquo;s history. It opened the door for the Koch Brothers and outside groups to spend MILLIONS influencing our elections.
But the Kochs&rsquo; plans just experienced a MAJOR setback. Hillary Clinton just announced that campaign finance reform will be at the center of her campaign for President
-- and pledged her support for a Constitutional Amendment to overturn
Citizens United .
Will you join Cheri, Hillary Clinton and Democrats across the country in the fight to overturn
Citizens United ?
Our democracy shouldn&rsquo;t be sold to the highest bidder. If you agree, sign your name to stand with Cheri, Hillary and Democrats across the country against
Citizens United
now: SIGN YOUR NAME:
