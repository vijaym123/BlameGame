Our Own Worst Enemy
Dear Friends,
This past weekend, a former elected official asked me which airport in D.C. I use. I replied, &ldquo;Almost 100% of the time I fly into Reagan National.&rdquo; He recoiled and said, &ldquo;I never say the name of that man, I just say &lsquo;National Airport.&rsquo;&rdquo; I launched into my much-worn speech about my fear that if we continue this political tribalism, we will enfeeble this nation for our children and their children. But unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t believe I converted him. He went into what must be a much-worn speech of his own, a sort of, &ldquo;look what they do&rdquo; response. He said, &ldquo;They refuse to use correct English by saying &lsquo;Democrat party&rsquo; when they know the difference between a noun and an adjective.&rdquo;
So far, both parties of the 21st Century Congress have been so hell-bent on claiming or reclaiming the political majority, that both have sacrificed getting things done for the people, let alone enhancing the political well-being of this nation.
Unless we turn it around soon, this great country of ours will not perish from terrorist attacks or marauding armies, but from petty political partisanship.
