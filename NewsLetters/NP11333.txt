Dear Friend,
When our Founding Fathers created our government, they formed a system
of checks and balances to protect individual liberty. Congress is
tasked with writing the laws, and the President has a constitutional
duty to enforce and execute them.
Unfortunately, during President Obama's tenure, too many times he has
ignored his duty and made his own choices about when and where to
enforce the law. This is wrong, and it sets a dangerous example. If the
President himself doesn't follow the law, what does that say to the
American people?
This past week, the House took action to make sure that the current and
future Presidents do not ignore constitutional duties to faithfully
execute laws. Along with a majority of my colleagues, I voted for the
Executive Needs to Faithfully Observe and Respect Congressional
Enactments of the Law (ENFORCE the Law) Act. This bill grants Congress
the authority to file a lawsuit against the executive branch should
they fail to faithfully execute the laws.
This is not just about President Obama - regardless of your political
party or views, we can all agree that no President should be making
exceptions or unilateral changes to the law. It is unconstitutional and
challenges the foundation of our democracy. I will continue to be a
part of the effort to ensure that no branch of government abuses its
power. It is a sad state of affairs that it has even become a question,
and we need to restore the balance of power and protect the sanctity of
our democracy.
Sincerely,
George Holding

Friend,
When
our
Founding
Fathers
created
our
government,
they
formed
a
system
of
checks
and
balances
to
protect
individual
liberty.
Congress
is
tasked
with
writing
the
laws,
and
the
President
has
a
constitutional
duty
to
enforce
and
execute
them.
Unfortunately,
during
President
Obama's
tenure,
too
many
times
he
has
ignored
his
duty
and
made
his
own
choices
about
when
and
where
to
enforce
the
law.
This
is
wrong,
and
it sets
a dangerous
example.
If
the
President
himself doesn't
follow
the
law,
what
does
that
say
to
the
American
people?
This
past
week,
the
House
took
action
to
make
sure
that
the
current
and
future
Presidents
do
not
ignore
constitutional
duties
to
faithfully
execute
laws. Along
with
a
majority
of
my
colleagues,
I
voted
for
the
Executive
Needs

of
the

(ENFORCE
the

Act.
This
bill
grants
Congress
the
authority
to
file
a
lawsuit
against
the
executive
branch
should
they
fail
to
faithfully
execute
the
laws.
This
is
not
just
about
President
Obama
-
regardless
of
your
political
party
or

we
can
all
agree
that
no
President
should
be
making
exceptions
or

to
the
law.
It
is
unconstitutional
and

the

I
will

It

and
