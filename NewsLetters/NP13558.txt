Dear Friend,
With the House completing its legislative work for 2013, I wanted to
take a few moments to update you on legislation passed recently and
also provide a look ahead to 2014.
Despite the House adjourning for the remainder of the year, I will be
working in Nevada meeting with constituents hearing their concerns and
assisting them with cases involving problems with federal agencies. To
stay up-to-date on my work in Nevada, I urge you to connect with me on
social media
. I am on Facebook, Twitter, and
YouTube as Rep. Joe Heck.
I hope you will keep reading to learn about my recent work on your
behalf. It remains an honor and privilege to serve you in the House of
Representatives.
Sincerely,

Budget Bill Breaks Promise to Our Veterans
Last week, the House passed a budget bill to establish spending levels
for the federal government for the next two years. While I am in favor
of ending the pattern of crisis governing that has crippled Washington
recently, I could not support this bill
. The
bill broke a time-honored promise to our veterans by making changes to
military retirement for current retirees. We need stability in the
budget, but that should not be balanced on the backs of our veterans,
their families and survivors who have already sacrificed so much. While
I support replacing the indiscriminate cuts of the budget sequester, I
could not break faith with the men and women with whom I have served
over the past 23 years nor those who served before me. Click HERE

read the full statement on my vote against the budget bill.
Defense Authorization Includes Sexual Assault Prevention Provision
With time winding down to reach an agreement on the annual defense
authorization bill, House and Senate negotiators produced a bill that
authorizes spending for national defense programs and overseas military
operations.
I supported this bill because it maintains military
readiness, supports our troops and their families, and takes meaningful
steps towards preventing sexual assault in the military. The bill
contained a provision based on legislation I helped author called the
No Tolerance Act. The No Tolerance Act enhances protections for
prospective members of the Armed Forces against sexual assault and
unwanted sexual contact during entry-level processing and training. To
read more about my efforts to prevent military sexual assault and
another priority I worked to have included in the defense authorization
bill, click HERE

Kids First Research Act Puts Pediatric Research Ahead of Party
Conventions
Which is a better use of taxpayer dollars: political party conventions
or scientific research for pediatric diseases and disorders like cancer
and autism? I think pediatric research is more important and so I voted
for the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act. This bill strips
taxpayer funding for political party conventions and allows it to be
used for finding cures for diseases like the one that took the life of
10 year old Gabriella Miller. After being diagnosed with inoperable
brain cancer, Gabriella became an advocate for helping kids overcome
childhood disease. Her dream was to raise awareness of kids suffering
with life threatening diseases and secure increased funding for
research. Gabriella lost her battle with cancer six months ago, but the
House of Representatives helped keep her dream alive by passing this
bill with her name on it. To learn more about Gabriella and her dream,
watch the video
below.
A Look Ahead to 2014
We face many challenges in the upcoming year. As always, my top
priority is to enact policies that set the economic conditions for the
private sector to thrive and create jobs. In the year ahead, the House
will continue to pass legislation that makes it cheaper and easier for
companies to expand and spurs economic growth. My hope is that some of
these bills will be considered and passed by the Senate.
Another focus of mine in 2014 will be to pass the JOLT Act as Congress
continues its work on immigration reform. The JOLT Act
would bring much-needed jobs and economic
opportunity to southern Nevada by increasing the number of
international travelers and tourists that visit our many tourist
destinations. The JOLT Act does this by streamlining our inefficient
visa processing system, at no cost to the American taxpayer, so that
more of those tourists can come to the United States. If passed, it is
estimated that the JOLT Act could bring 98 million more visitors to the
U.S., create one million American jobs, and generate as much as $859
billion in revenue by 2020.

Kids
First
Research
Act
Puts
Pediatric
Research
Ahead
of
Party
Conventions
Which
is
a
better
use
of
taxpayer
dollars:
political
party
conventions
or
scientific
research
for
pediatric
diseases
and
disorders
like
cancer
and
autism?
I
think
pediatric
research
is
more
important
and
so
I
voted
for
the
Gabriella
Miller
Kids
First
Research
Act.
This
bill
strips
taxpayer
funding
for
political
party
conventions
and
allows
it
to
be
used
for
finding
cures
for
diseases
like
the
one
that
took
the
life
of
10
year
old
Gabriella
Miller.
After
being
diagnosed
with
inoperable
brain
cancer,
Gabriella
became
an
advocate
for
helping
kids
overcome
childhood
disease.
Her
dream
was
to
raise
awareness
of
kids
suffering
with
life
threatening
diseases
and
secure
increased
funding
for
research.
Gabriella
lost
her
battle
with
cancer
six
months
ago,
but
the
House
of
Representatives
helped
keep
her
dream
alive
by
passing
this
bill
with
her
name
on
it.

Gabriella
and
her
dream,

A
Look
Ahead
to
2014
We
face
many
challenges
in
the
upcoming
year.
As
always,
my
top
priority
is
to
enact
policies
that
set
the
economic
conditions
for
the
private
sector
to
thrive
and
create
jobs.
In
the
year
ahead,
the
House
will
continue
to
pass
legislation
that
makes
it
cheaper
and
easier
for
companies
to
expand
and
spurs
economic
growth.
My
hope
is
that
some
of
these
bills
will
be
considered
and
passed
by
the
Senate.
Another
focus
of
mine
in
2014
will
be
to
pass
the
JOLT
Act
as
Congress
continues
its
work
on
immigration
reform.
The
JOLT
Act
would
bring
much-needed
jobs
and
economic
opportunity
to
southern
Nevada
by
increasing
the
number
of
international
travelers
and
tourists
that
visit
our
many
tourist
destinations.
The
JOLT
Act
does
this
by
streamlining
our
inefficient
visa
processing
system,
at
no
cost
to
the
American
taxpayer,
so
that
more
of
those
tourists
can
come
to
the
United
States.
If
passed,
it
is
estimated
that
the
JOLT
Act
could
bring
98
million
more
visitors
to
the
U.S.,
create
one
million
American
jobs,
and
generate
as
much
as
$859
billion
in
revenue
by
2020.
