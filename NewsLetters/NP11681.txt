Getting the Truth from the
IRS
Click here to watch my interview on "America's News Headquarters"
following the hearing .
Former IRS director of
exempt organizations Lois Lerner appeared before the House Oversight and
Government Reform Committee on Wednesday as a continuation of our May
2013 hearing on IRS targeting. As she did last May, Lerner once again
invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to answer any questions from the
Committee.
In a
Wall Street
Journal
report the next day ,
Lerner's attorney confirmed that Lerner gave a full interview to the
Department of Justice (DOJ). This revelation raises numerous questions.
Why will Lerner talk to the DOJ, an agency that could actually put her
in jail, but not to Congress? Does her apparent lack of concern in
answering the DOJ's questions demonstrate that we should not take the
agency's investigation seriously?
Additionally, why
should Lerner be permitted to ignore the inquiries of Congress and the
American people while choosing to answer questions from another agency?
Hasn't she waived her Fifth Amendment right?
Our
Committee is looking into all options to ensure we hold Lois Lerner
accountable and get the truth.
Supporting Ukraine
On Thursday, the
House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a resolution condemning Russia's
violation of Ukrainian sovereignty, independence, and territorial
integrity.
Included in the final resolution was my
amendment urging President Obama and leaders of the other democratic states
to not attend the upcoming G8 summit in Sochi and to consider
expelling Russia from the group due to Vladimir Putin's international
aggression.
Honoring our
First Responders
This week, I introduced a House
resolution to annually designate October 28th as "Honoring the
Nation's First Responders Day."
Our country owes a debt of
gratitude to the more than 25 million first responders who serve our
nation by willingly putting their lives on the line to protect their
neighbors and communities. This holiday recognizes the contributions of all
fire, police, EMT, and volunteer service men and women across this
nation.
As with many of our initiatives, the idea for this
commemorative day came directly from a constituent of the 11th
District. He believes, like I do, that our first responders deserve to be
recognized for their service and sacrifice. Having met with so many of our
first responders in Western North Carolina, I have seen firsthand
that their dedication to our communities and our country is without
equal. I am excited to be proposing this national holiday to honor those
who devote their lives to protecting us.
