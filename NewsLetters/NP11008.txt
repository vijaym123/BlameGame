Dear Friend,
There are only three days left to sign up for quality affordable health
insurance through our state's health insurance marketplace: Covered
California.
If you don't sign up
by midnight on Monday March 31, you will have to wait until November to
enroll and your coverage will not start until next year, so the time to
enroll is now.
Get covered by March 31st
More than one million Californians have already signed up for quality
coverage through Covered California and no one should miss the
opportunity to get covered.
Financial assistance is available that can
lower the cost of coverage to well under $100 per month depending on
your income.
The coverage is high quality, with guaranteed benefits
like prescription drug coverage, primary care visits, mental health,
and pediatric dental.
And no one can be discriminated against because
of their gender, where they work, or a pre-existing condition.
If one of your friends or family members does not have coverage, please
encourage them to sign up.
Even if you are healthy now, having good
health insurance coverage can save you from the devastating costs of an
accident or serious illness.
Coverage can help you stay healthier and,
by helping you prevent or diagnose serious illnesses early, it can even
save your life.
Signing up is easy at CoveredCA.com, by calling 1-800-300-1506, or
through in person assistance throughout our area.

We expect there to be a surge of people applying at the last minute so
please start your application now
If you start your application in the next three days, you will have
until April 15 to complete your application.

Let's make sure everyone takes advantage of this tremendous opportunity.
