News from Representative Richard Nugent
Dear Friends,
Just a quick update for you this week on where we stand in the budget
process. First off, as you all probably know, we're officially into
budget season now. The President's budget was released earlier this
month and we've been going through it thoroughly. In particular, as
part of my role on the House Armed Services Committee, we've been
taking testimony from each of the service chiefs and examining the
close details of their respective budget requests. More on that in a
moment.
As a general matter, before I get too far into this, it's important to
remember that the President's budget is indeed a request. It does not
carry the force of law. Congress gets the final say about how much
money the government will or won't spend. What the document tells us is
what the government's finances would look like if the President could
have it any way he wanted.
On the spending side of the ledger, President Obama is requesting a
$791 billion increase in spending over the ten-year budget window. If
enacted, it would include a $56 billion increase in spending next year
- over and above the levels established in the bipartisan budget
agreement reached at the end of last year. His budget would cause total
spending to rise from current levels by roughly 63% over the next ten
years. Much of that growth is in so-called mandatory spending on items
such as Medicare and Social Security, but an enormous amount of the
growth is also due to an explosion in our annual interest payments on
our debt.
Under the President's fiscal plan, our interest payments to the nation's
creditors would rise from $223 billion this year to over $800 billion
annually within a decade. This shouldn't come as much of a surprise
(we've known about this for a while), but what is surprising is that in
spite of our exploding "credit card" payments, the President's budget
would never balance - ever. Just in the next ten years, under his plan,
we'll add another $5 trillion to the debt.
This increase in borrowing comes in spite of the President's call for
raising taxes by an additional $1.8 trillion over current levels. Keep
in mind he has already raised taxes by $1.7 trillion.
Meanwhile, despite the increase in spending. and taxes. and debt. we're
struggling just to keep our defense resources intact. Just this week,
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed legislation dealing with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and an aid package for Ukraine
that pays for the cost by implementing additional cuts to our military.
This is the public statement I put out on that legislation:
"I am absolutely appalled that members of the United States Senate, who
have sworn an oath to defend this nation, would seriously be
considering cuts to our own military in order to give that money away
to other countries. This government does a lot of things that I think
are wrong-headed, but cutting from the military to pay for the IMF is
about as bad as it can get.
"We've seen this all before where Congress weakens the military because
they think the world is free of threats and as soon as they do, our
adversaries see that weakness and they start testing us. If you don't
think that Russia and China and others are watching what we're doing
here and slapping high fives behind the scenes, you're crazy. Every
time America purposefully weakens itself, it has the effect of
purposefully strengthening our enemies and I would encourage my Senate
colleagues to think very carefully about that."
If you've been reading this newsletter for a while, then you know that
from time to time I am absolutely astonished at the collective wisdom
of Washington. And every time I think I've seen it all - that I couldn't
possibly be shocked at anything Congress decides to do - they run and
pass legislation like this. It's beyond comprehension.
In any case, when it comes to defense funding, I think our guiding star
is pretty simple - decide what it is you would like for our military to
do and then fund that mission adequately. In other words, what kind of
capabilities do we want our forces to have? What kind of threats do we
expect them to respond to? What sort of aggression from foreign actors
are we hoping to deter? Where will our military need to be and how
quickly? Do we want to maintain our ability to simultaneously engage in
two separate conflicts or are we satisfied being unable to fight a war
on two fronts? These are the kinds of questions you start with. When
you have the answers, then you know what level of resources will be
required? It is our duty, as I see it, to adequately fund those needs.
When we ask our troops to prepare against certain threats and then don't
provide them with the resources they need to carry out that mission,
then we put our kids at risk. That's unacceptable to me and hopefully,
Congress will come together to realize that and act accordingly.
In any case, that's where things stand this week. If you have any
questions or concerns, I hope you'll send them along. As always, I
appreciate your interest and your time. And if there is anything my
staff or I can do to be of service to you, please let me know.
Thanks again.
Sincerely,
Rich Nugent
Member of Congress

News
from
Representative
Richard
Nugent
Dear
Friends,
Just
a
quick
update
for
you
this
week
on
where
we
stand
in
the
budget
process.
First
off,
as
you
all
probably
know,
we&#8217;re
officially
into
budget
season
now.
The
President&#8217;s
budget
was
released
earlier
this
month
and
we&#8217;ve
been
going
through
it
thoroughly.
In
particular,
as
part
of
my
role
on
the
House
Armed
Services
Committee,
we&#8217;ve
been
taking
testimony
from
each
of
the
service
chiefs
and
examining
the
close
details
of
their
respective
budget
requests.
More
on
that
in
a
moment.
As
a
general
matter,
before
I
get
too
far
into
this,
it&#8217;s
important
to
remember
that
the
President&#8217;s
budget
is
indeed
a
request.
It
does
not
carry
the
force
of
law.
Congress
gets
the
final
say
about
how
much
money
the
government
will
or
won&#8217;t
spend.
What
the
document
tells
us
is
what
the
government&#8217;s
finances
would
look
like
if
the
President
could
have
it
any
way
he
wanted.
On
the
spending
side
of
the
ledger,
President
Obama
is
requesting
a
$791
billion
increase
in
spending
over
the
ten-year
budget
window.
If
enacted,
it
would
include
a
$56
billion
increase
in
spending
next
year
-
over
and
above
the
levels
established
in
the
bipartisan
budget
agreement
reached
at
the
end
of
last
year.
His
budget
would
cause
total
spending
to
rise
from
current
levels
by
roughly
63%
over
the
next
ten
years.
Much
of
that
growth
is
in
so-called
mandatory
spending
on
items
such
as
Medicare
and
Social
Security,
but
an
enormous
amount
of
the
growth
is
also
due
to
an
explosion
in
our
annual
interest
payments
on
our
debt.
Under
the
President&#8217;s
fiscal
plan,
our
interest
payments
to
the
nation&#8217;s
creditors
would
rise
from
$223
billion
this
year
to
over
$800
billion
annually
within
a
decade.
This
shouldn&#8217;t
come
as
much
of
a
surprise
(we&#8217;ve
known
about
this
for
a
while),
but
what
is
surprising
is
that
in
spite
of
our
exploding
&#8220;credit
card&#8221;
payments,
the
President&#8217;s
budget
would
never
balance
&#8211;
ever.
Just
in
the
next
ten
years,
under
his
plan,
we&#8217;ll
add
another
$5
trillion
to
the
debt.
This
increase
in
borrowing
comes
in
spite
of
the
President&#8217;s
call
for
raising
taxes
by
an
additional
$1.8
trillion
over
current
levels.
Keep
in
mind
he
has
already
raised
taxes
by
$1.7
trillion.
Meanwhile,
despite
the
increase
in
spending&#8230;
and
taxes&#8230;
and
debt&#8230;
we&#8217;re
struggling
just
to
keep
our
defense
resources
intact.
Just
this
week,
the
Senate
Foreign
Relations
Committee
passed
legislation
dealing
with
the
International
Monetary
Fund
(IMF)
and
an
aid
package
for
Ukraine
that
pays
for
the
cost
by
implementing
additional
cuts
to
our
military.
This
is
the
public
statement
I
put
out
on
that
legislation:
&#8220;I
am
absolutely
appalled
that
members
of
the
United
States
Senate,
who
have
sworn
an
oath
to
defend
this
nation,
would
seriously
be
considering
cuts
to
our
own
military
in
order
to
give
that
money
away
to
other
countries.
This
government
does
a
lot
of
things
that
I
think
are
wrong-headed,
but
cutting
from
the
military
to
pay
for
the
IMF
is
about
as
bad
as
it
can
get.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve
seen
this
all
before
where
Congress
weakens
the
military
because
they
think
the
world
is
free
of
threats
and
as
soon
as
they
do,
our
adversaries
see
that
weakness
and
they
start
testing
us.
If
you
don&#8217;t
think
that
Russia
and
China
and
others
are
watching
what
we&#8217;re
doing
here
and
slapping
high
fives
behind
the
scenes,
you&#8217;re
crazy.
Every
time
America
purposefully
weakens
itself,
it
has
the
effect
of
purposefully
strengthening
our
enemies
and
I
would
encourage
my
Senate
colleagues
to
think
very
carefully
about
that.&#8221;
If
you&#8217;ve
been
reading
this
newsletter
for
a
while,
then
you
know
that
from
time
to
time
I
am
absolutely
astonished
at
the
collective
wisdom
of
Washington.
And
every
time
I
think
I&#8217;ve
seen
it
all
&#8211;
that
I
couldn&#8217;t
possibly
be
shocked
at
anything
Congress
decides
to
do
&#8211;
they
run
and
pass
legislation
like
this.
It&#8217;s
beyond
comprehension.
In
any
case,
when
it
comes
to
defense
funding,
I
think
our
guiding
star
is
pretty
simple
&#8211;
decide
what
it
is
you
would
like
for
our
military
to
do
and
then
fund
that
mission
adequately.
In
other
words,
what
kind
of
capabilities
do
we
want
our
forces
to
have?
What
kind
of
threats
do
we
expect
them
to
respond
to?
What
sort
of
aggression
from
foreign
actors
are
we
hoping
to
deter?
Where
will
our
military
need
to
be
and
how
quickly?
Do
we
want
to
maintain
our
ability
to
simultaneously
engage
in
two
separate
conflicts
or
are
we
satisfied
being
unable
to
fight
a
war
on
two
fronts?
These
are
the
kinds
of
questions
you
start
with.
When
you
have
the
answers,
then
you
know
what
level
of
resources
will
be
required?
It
is
our
duty,
as
I
see
it,
to
adequately
fund
those
needs.
When
we
ask
our
troops
to
prepare
against
certain
threats
and
then
don&#8217;t
provide
them
with
the
resources
they
need
to
carry
out
that
mission,
then
we
put
our
kids
at
risk.
That&#8217;s
unacceptable
to
me
and
hopefully,
Congress
will
come
together
to
realize
that
and
act
accordingly.
In
any
case,
that&#8217;s
where
things
stand
this
week.
If
you
have
any
questions
or
concerns,
I
hope
you&#8217;ll
send
them
along.
As
always,
I
appreciate
your
interest
and
your
time.
And
if
there
is
anything
my
staff
or
I
can
do
to
be
of
service
to
you,
please
let
me
know.
Thanks
again.
Sincerely, Rich
Nugent Member

Congress
