Dear Neighbors,
This week, President Obama laid out his priorities for the year in the
State of the Union Address, and he reiterated the importance of and
renewed the call for comprehensive immigration reform. It was a message
I was hoping to hear.
To highlight the urgent need for immigration reform, I invited
Estefania Garcia, a DREAMer from Highwood, as my guest for the
President's Address. Her extraordinary story underscores and
personifies the strong need for comprehensive reform.
This week, I also used my blog to reiterate the full case for why I
support immigration reform, which you can read here: Highlighting the
Need for Comprehensive Immigration Reform
.
When Estefania shared her story a few
months ago at an immigration roundtable discussion I organized with
community and business leaders, she moved us all to tears. She came to
the U.S. at age seven, and since then has graduated from high school,
finished college on the Dean's List and begun a career in educational,
career and social services for immigrant and underserved families in
our community.
Her story, though powerful, is not unique. It is one of many. Many
talented, ambitious individuals want to build better lives for
themselves and their families and help move our country forward in the
21st Century, but can't because a broken system pushes them out or
keeps them away. I strongly believe in the economic and social benefits
of fixing our immigration system, which is why I also spoke on the
House floor, urging the rest of my colleagues to join me in support of
comprehensive reform. You can see that speech in this video:
Simply put: comprehensive immigration reform is a win-win proposal. We
can do well by doing right, and I hope that sharing more stories like
Estefania's will help us achieve the reform we need.
Thank you,
Brad Schneider
P.S. On February 20th, I'll host a Hiring Event in conjunction with
Rep. Tammy Duckworth. For job seekers looking to participate, please

Dear
Neighbors,
This
week,
President
Obama
laid
out
his
priorities
for
the
year
in
the
State
of
the
Union
Address,
and
he
reiterated
the
importance
of
and
renewed
the
call
for
comprehensive
immigration
reform.
It
was
a
message
I
was
hoping
to
hear.
To
highlight
the
urgent
need
for
immigration
reform,
I
invited
Estefania
Garcia,
a
DREAMer
from
Highwood,
as
my
guest
for
the
President's
Address.
Her
extraordinary
story
underscores
and
personifies
the
strong
need
for
comprehensive
reform.
This
week,
I
also
used
my
blog
to
reiterate
the
full
case
for
why
I
support
immigration
reform,
which
you
can
read
here:
Highlighting
the
Need
for
Comprehensive
Immigration
Reform .
When
Estefania
shared
her
story
a
few
months
ago
at
an
immigration roundtable
discussion
I
organized
with
community
and
business
leaders,
she
moved
us
all
to
tears.
She
came
to
the
U.S.
at
age
seven,
and
since
then
has
graduated
from
high
school,
finished
college
on
the
Dean&#8217;s
List
and
begun
a
career
in
educational,
career and
social
services
for
immigrant
and
underserved
families
in
our
community.
Her
story,
though
powerful,
is
not
unique.
It
is
one
of
many.
Many
talented,
ambitious
individuals
want
to
build
better
lives
for
themselves
and
their
families
and
help
move
our
country
forward
in
the
21st
Century,
but
can&#8217;t
because
a
broken
system
pushes
them
out
or
keeps
them
away.
I
strongly
believe in
the
economic
and
social
benefits
of
fixing
our
immigration
system, which
is
why
I
also
spoke
on
the
House
floor,
urging
the
rest
of
my
colleagues
to
join
me
in
support
of
comprehensive
reform.
You
can
see
that
speech
in
this
video:
Simply
put:
comprehensive
immigration
reform
is
a
win-win
proposal.
We
can
do
well
by
doing
right,
and
I
hope
that
sharing
more
stories
like
Estefania&#8217;s
will
help
us
achieve
the
reform
we
need.
Thank
you,
Brad
