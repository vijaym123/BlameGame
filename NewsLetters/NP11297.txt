Dear Friend,
I am thrilled to report I passed my first bill in Congress, the
Philippines Charitable Giving Assistance Act. This legislation, headed
to President Obama's desk, will empower Americans and help the Typhoon
Haiyan relief effort.
I am privileged to represent a vibrant and dynamic Filipino population.
Many of my constituents have friends or relatives in the Philippines,
and are asking how they can help.
This legislation makes it easier to help, allowing Americans to deduct
from their 2013 taxes (filed this year) monetary donations for Typhoon
Haiyan relief which are made after the bill is signed into law and
before April 15, 2014. Without this bill, a person would have to wait
until he or she filed their taxes next year to claim the deduction.
This typhoon was the most powerful storm ever to hit landfall and
caused destruction throughout the Philippines. Sixteen million people
were affected by the storm, four million were displaced, and over six
thousand perished. Hundreds of millions of dollars are needed for
relief, to help provide things like food, water, and shelter.
I expect this bill to be signed into law shortly. I will update you
when that occurs.
If you have any questions about the legislation, please contact me. You
can do so through my website, swalwell.house.gov
. In addition, on my website you can view my voting record and
visit my Twitter
and Facebook
pages.
Sincerely,
Eric Swalwell
