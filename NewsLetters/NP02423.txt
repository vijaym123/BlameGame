VISITING DC
February 28, 2015
This week was another busy week in Washington DC. I
introduced legislation to peel back bureaucratic red tape thats
increasing education costs for families; the President vetoed his first bill;
and I chaired a Senate hearing on whether the federal government is as
ready as it can be for national emergencies like Ebola.
A bill to reduce red tape for
colleges, and reduce cost on families:
This week I unveiled the " Supporting Academic Freedom through Regulatory Relief Act .
This legislation cuts the red tape that has been placed on colleges and
universities over the last six years of the Presidents
administration. This month, an independent report found that the cost of
Washington's overreach in higher education was high, costing families more every
year to educate their children.
Bureaucrats at the Department of Education have become
addicted to micromanaging nearly every aspect of campus life, wading
into issues Congress never authorized and most commonsense Americans
don't support. Worse, these reporting requirements ultimately are passed
down to students and parents in the form of higher tuition, as
colleges and universities become compliance-driven organizations, rather than
institutions of learning. My legislation rolls back much of this
burdensome red tape. Read the legislation
here
and access the report
here .
Presidents vetoes Energy Bill:
The President has vetoed
Congresss first jobs bill of 2015, the Keystone XL Pipeline Approval Act. The
legislation is a bipartisan, commonsense measure that garnered support
with the American people and was granted a favorable ruling by the
Presidents State Department. It passed both chambers with overwhelming
bipartisan support -- 62 to 36 in the Senate and 266 to 153 in the
House.
It's clear from
the President's first veto that he has no intention on working with
Congress to create jobs here at home.
My replacement for
Obamacare:
Monday, Senator Hatch, Representative Upton, and I sent a
letter
to the nations governors seeking
feedback on our recently released
Patient Choice, Affordability, Responsibility, and Empowerment (CARE)
Act . The Patient CARE Act is a patient-focused legislative blueprint
that devolves power from Washington to empower families, small
businesses, and states.
We
believe health care reform will be most successful when accomplished in
a transparent and inclusive manner, which is why we want to hear
directly from the states. You can ready more about our letter and about
the Patient CARE Act
here .
The Patient CARE Act,
which would replace Obamacare, also received an excellent write-up in the
President's home town paper, calling it the best blueprint weve
seen. The Chicago Tribune went on to say Their proposal, called the
Patient CARE Act, strips away much of Obamacare's overreach
Individual responsibility would be rewarded Consumers would have more
flexibility in choosing insurance. They ended the article saying
Burr-Hatch-Upton could be the framework for Plan B, as in bipartisan. Read the
full article

Hearing on public health preparedness, no more Ebola catastrophes:
On Thursday, I
chaired a Senate committee hearing on medical and public health
preparedness and response in the event of a situation like the Ebola
crisis. The basic question of our hearing asked if our nation is ready for
future threats. The American people expect us to do all that we can
to protect them from the full range of threats we may face, whether
they are naturally occurring, like Ebola, or are deliberate man-made
biological attacks.
Regardless of the source of these threats, we
must be well prepared to respond and protect the American
people.
Our witnesses at the
hearing included individuals from the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS), the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development
Authority (BARDA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
You can watch the hearing in full
here
or a compilation of my question and
answers

Government takes
over the Internet:
Thursday, the FCC ruled along party lines to regulate the
Internet. This is another sad abuse of executive power to heave more
regulations on one of our most innovative industries. I intend to work with
like-minded colleagues to see what actions we can take to roll back this
overreach in federal power.
Reverend Randy Cash opens the Senate with a
prayer:
Reverend Randy Cash, National Chaplain for The American
Legion and a North Carolinian, led the Senate in prayer on Tuesday.
Thank you Rev Cash for your powerful words.

Snow in DC and
NC:
Finally, I
hope all of you have been keeping safe and warm. While DC didnt get
quite as much snow as
some places in North
Carolina , we still received enough to put a decent coating on my car, inside
and out.
While we all think warm weather thoughts, check out this piece
from Coastal Living on the Happiest Seaside Town in 2015
which features Southport, NC.
Sincerely,
Richard Burr
