Dear Friend,
As you may be aware, much of the Second Congressional District has been placed under a Winter Storm Watch until Wednesday, January 29, 2014.
In order to prepare yourself and your home for these conditions, it is always best to plan ahead.
Please find several resources below which can be helpful to you as winter weather approaches our area:
Find out
how to be prepared
before, during, and after inclement weather.
Create a winter weather
emergency preparedness plan .
Listen to local TV broadcasts, local radio, or
NOAA Weather Radio
in an emergency.
Create an
emergency supply kit . Homes with senior citizens should include medications or other necessary supplies.
Sign up to receive
emergency alerts
to your mobile device for your area.
Ensure you are safe and prepared while driving by consulting
AAAs Inclement Weather Driving Tips .
In the event of a medical or life threatening emergency, please dial 911.
The safety and wellbeing of all South Carolinians is of the utmost importance to me. You may also find these resources by visiting the Winter Storm Safety section of my website at

As winter weather approaches the Second Congressional District, it is my hope that you and your family remain safe and take advantage of the services that are available to you.
It is an honor to represent the people of the Second Congressional District of South Carolina.
