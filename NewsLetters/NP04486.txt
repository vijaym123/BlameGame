Dear
David,
I'm sure you've seen the reports. President Obama is
threatening to ignore the will of voters and take unilateral executive action
on immigration as soon as this week.
According
to news reports, his
plan
could "protect up to
five million unauthorized immigrants from the threat of deportation and
provide many of them with work permits."
The president may
also
"allow family members of illegal
immigrants another avenue for citizenship through the military's delayed entry
program." But as
Fox News
noted, "Sources say
this avenue will likely be exploited, with people joining the military,
then not showing up for boot camp."
This is just the latest
example of President Obama's blatant executive over-reach. Once
again, he's ignoring the will of Missourians, and ignoring the fact that
we're a nation of laws.
I know you're tired
of this administration's executive over-reach. I am
too.
That's why I hope you'll join me in reaching out to tell
President Obama:
NO executive action on
immigration.
