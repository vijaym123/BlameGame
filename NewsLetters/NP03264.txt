Week in Review
First, thank you for subscribing to
my E-newsletter, intended to keep
all Nevadans up-to-date on what is
going on in Washington, D.C.
This week, the President gave his
State of the Union Address.
Out-of-control spending, a costly
health care law, and a seemingly
endless stream of red tape are
wreaking havoc on Nevadas
families and small businesses. The
Silver State has seen its share of
difficulties over the past years
and continuing down the same path
only serves as an impediment to our
needed comeback. Unfortunately, the
President failed to offer a
legitimate road map for job
creation or for turning the economy
around.
The
Senates new majority is
certainly a breath of fresh air and
our focus is to keep the priorities
of hardworking taxpayers at the
forefront. Im excited
about where Nevada can be in the
years to come, but its time
to turn the power back to the
American people and unleash our
nations entrepreneurs. I
look forward to working with my
colleagues on both sides of the
aisle in the year ahead, and I
sincerely hope President Obama will
join us in putting Americas
economy back on track.
I also attended a Senate
Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing
addressing the rules of the
committee in the 114th Congress and
pending legislation. I am dedicated
to finishing off what I started in
2013, by implementing all the bills
included in the VA Claims Backlog
Working Group, as well as focusing
specifically on the needs of
Nevada's veterans.
Here
is a story from the Reno Gazette
Journal from this week,
highlighting my dedication to
working with veterans and the
Department of Veterans' Affairs. To

hearing, click on the link to the

A
focus of mine in the last couple of
weeks has been specifically on
finances. I introduced legislation
aimed at making state and local
sales tax deductions permanent. I
also attended my first Senate
Committee on Finance hearing.
During this hearing, focusing on
jobs and a healthy economy, I
addressed the economic situation in
Nevada and offered solutions to
give the nation a more competitive
marketplace. To watch me speak at
the hearing, click on the link to

This week, I was presented with
many great opportunities to once
again begin work to benefit the
state. I look forward to taking
further steps in coming
weeks.
