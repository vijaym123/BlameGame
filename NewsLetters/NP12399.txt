VISITING DC
February 14, 2014
This week's legislative activity in the Senate was
cut short by the same storm that wreaked havoc across North
Carolina.
On Wednesday, the Senate voted on a one year suspension of
the debt limit, which passed 55-43. I voted against the legislation.
As I have said many times, Washington must curb its out of control
spending, and it must do so before we are in an even worse situation
than we are today.
We are limiting the opportunities of our
children and grandchildren because we refuse to make the tough choices
necessary to cut spending and start paying down our debt. Its time for
us to rein in spending and put our country on a sound fiscal
path.
This week, the Senate also voted on a piece of legislation from
the House that would repeal the cuts in military pension
cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) from last Decembers budget, and the legislation
was agreed to by a vote of 95-3.
The House legislation, which
is offset, repeals the cuts for veterans and those currently serving.
I voted to repeal the pension cuts, and I am pleased the
legislation passed the Senate and did so in a fiscally responsible
way.
I hope you and your family weathered the North Carolina storms
safely.
Sincerely,
Richard
Burr
