NOT
A SUBSCRIBER?
December 12, 2013
Dear Friends,
Today, I voted
for and the House passed a bipartisan budget bill which will fund the
government through September 30, 2015, lifting some of the harmful
sequester cuts and importantly, avoiding another government shutdown. The
deepest flaw in the bill is that it does not extend benefits for the
long-term unemployed. This is harsh and
harmful.
Supplemental unemployment benefits were enacted when the recession hit in 2008
and are still a critical lifeline for 1.3 million Americans who cant
find work. I have voted to extend these essential unemployment benefits
several times over the past five years, and I will continue to do
everything I can to extend this critical program.
The
Bipartisan Budget Act cuts the deficit by $23 billion over the next ten
years, as well as funding domestic and military needs. It does not cut
Social Security or Medicare benefits and it adds back resources for
scientific and medical research. Some fees will be raised but no new
revenues have been created by closing tax loopholes. I think this is an
opportunity squandered. A full summary of the savings achieved in the
legislation is available
here .
America
has always been composed of rivaling interests, but the spirit of
compromise has been woven into the fabric of our country since the highly
contentious Constitutional Convention in 1787. While this budget bill
does not achieve everything Id hoped for, it is the responsibility of
Congress to produce a budget for our nation, and for a change,
compromise was honored.
Should you have any questions or
comments, let me hear from you.
All my best,
Anna G. Eshoo
Member of
Congress
