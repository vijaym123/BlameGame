Dear Friends,
I&rsquo;m excited to invite you to join me as I speak at and host Ready, Set, SUCCEED: A Women&rsquo;s Small Business Seminar to be held on Monday, April 20, 2015 in Redwood City. The event is designed to give current and aspiring female business owners in the Bay Area some tools, advice, and resources for building their businesses. The importance of business development has been a key priority for me and you&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to hear more about that during this seminar.
California has the highest number of women-owned businesses and women entrepreneurs are the fastest growing segment in the small business community. However, while women have made great strides to reach economic parity with men in the world of business, major challenges still persist. The goal of Ready, Set, SUCCEED is to help women overcome these challenges.
The seminar will offer workshops on kick-starting a small business, the benefits of crowd funding and micro-lending, building an online presence, and accessing markets. We&rsquo;ll also hear words of wisdom from keynote speaker, co-founder and president of Luminalt, Jeanine Cotter. Jeanine will share her inspiring story of how she went from a lawyer to head of San Francisco&rsquo;s only woman-owned solar company, turning an idea into a $5.5 million business &ndash; all while raising three kids!
There are nearly 9.1 million women-owned businesses in the United States generating $1.4 trillion in sales annually. The economic impact of women-owned business is significant and should be celebrated, supported and recognized. We need our women business owners to be successful to drive economic growth.
When women succeed, America succeeds.
