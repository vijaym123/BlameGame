Senator Johnson Comments on
Continuing Resolution Vote in the
Senate
The United States Senate, under
the failed leadership of Democrat Senator Harry Reid, has not passed a
regular appropriations bill in nearly three years. As a result, there
is not the thoughtful debate or prioritization of spending that will be
necessary if we ever hope to have a more efficient and effective
federal government." Read more

Senator Johnson Comments on
Nomination to 69th U.N. General
Assembly
I appreciate President
Obama nominating me as one of the U.S. representatives to the 69th
Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. This temporary role
is an expansion of my duties as a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, and it will not interfere with my other responsibilities
representing the people of Wisconsin." Read

Victims of
Government
Sen. Johnson strongly believes that
the root cause of America's social and economic problems lies in the
excessive laws, rules and regulations that constitute the government's
intrusion in our lives. If you have had, or are currently having,
issues dealing with the federal agencies that mandate these restrictions,
we would like to hear your story and work with you to resolve the
issues. Share your story with Ron's professional staff by emailing us
