Dear
Friend,
This was a stunning week in Washington. Both
the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate passed a
BUDGET.
Can you imagine, its first budget in six
years?
The House also passed
significant legislation that will provide a doc fix so that rather than
scramble every year to pay health care providers, there will be stability
for doctors who provide Medicare and Medicaid service
professionals.
My proposal for privatizing FAA air
traffic control actually received serious consideration both from the
aviation industry and stakeholders at a Congressional hearing this
week.
This initiative would dramatically reform FAA and create an
employee stock ownership and stakeholder group that could administer
and advance technology for our nations next generation air traffic
control system.
Congress considers privatizing the air traffic control
system
The Washington
Post
Just several items from a productive week, long overdue,
in our Nations Capital.
With my
regards and best wishes, I
remain
Most
respectfully,
John L. Mica
