National Agriculture Day
Each year, farmers, agricultural associations, universities, government agencies, and other stakeholders come together on National Agriculture Day to recognize the abundant contributions of America&rsquo;s agricultural industry to our nation and the world.
As Ohio&rsquo;s first Senator on the Agriculture Committee in more than 40 years, Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) is honored to represent Ohio&rsquo;s farmers, livestock producers, and rural communities. Approximately one out of every seven Ohio jobs is in agriculture, the state&rsquo;s largest industry.
Today, Ohio farmers not only put food on our tables, but also provide renewable fuels for our vehicles and are helping create new biobased products.
Last year, Sen. Brown was able to help expand access to rural broadband and reinvest in aging water and sewer systems. These investments are critical to the long-term success of Ohio&rsquo;s rural communities. There are increasingly new business opportunities for smaller producers and family farmers through improving access to local foods and supporting farmers&rsquo; markets across the state. Sen. Brown has fought to encourage entrepreneurship and increase access to capital and economic development opportunities for Ohio farmers and small towns. He also successfully passed his
Local Farms, Food and Jobs Act
as part of the
2014 Farm Bill .
Sen. Brown believes agriculture policy should
reflect the locally-identified priorities
of Ohio&rsquo;s rural communities and bolster Ohio&rsquo;s number one industry to create jobs and strengthen our economy. On National Agriculture Day, join him in saying thank you to those involved in our state&rsquo;s agricultural sector.
