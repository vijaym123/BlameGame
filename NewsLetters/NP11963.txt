I&rsquo;d like to share with you some of what I&rsquo;ve been working on in Washington and Tennessee this past month:
Voting to restore military pensions &ndash; after I opposed those cuts in the first place
On Feb. 12, I voted to restore military benefits that were cut as part of the budget agreement Congress passed &ndash; and which I voted against &ndash; in December. Changing pensions in a way that treated military retirees worse than the federal government&rsquo;s civilian retirees was a bad idea in the first place, and that&rsquo;s one of the reasons I voted against the budget agreement. These benefits are important to the men and women who have worn the uniform of our Armed Services.

Attending the Faithful Men&rsquo;s Meeting with Dr. Ben Carson and thousands of Tennesseans
I attended the Faithful Men&rsquo;s Meeting in Powell, Tenn. on Jan. 18, where I had the chance to hear the children&rsquo;s choir and play a few gospel songs on the piano before Dr. Ben Carson shared his conservative vision for our country with thousands of fellow Christian men. Prior to the program, I had a chance to visit with Dr. Carson and Pastor Clarence Sexton.

Battling IRS attempts to target conservatives and limit free speech
The Internal Revenue Service violated the First Amendment rights of the American people when it created what amounted to an enemies list of conservatives, including Tennessee Tea Party groups, to keep people quiet. What the American people need now is their trust restored &ndash; not more federal overreach. That&rsquo;s why I cosponsored legislation on Feb. 11, and followed up with a letter to the IRS on Feb. 18, to stop proposed IRS regulations that are so broad they could further limit free speech. I also joined U.S. Rep. Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn.) to introduce the
IRS Abuse Protection Act , which would require the federal government to inform taxpayers when the IRS accesses their information.

Offering real answers to the issue of income inequality: free enterprise and school choice
I would have preferred that President Obama give a real answer to income inequality when he delivered the State of the Union address on Jan. 28. The first real answer is to liberate our free enterprise system from the president&rsquo;s own regulations, so it can create more good jobs. Another real answer is to give parents more freedom to choose a better school for their children. I introduced legislation to do just that the same day as the State of the Union.

Honored to have Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey as my guest at State of the Union
I was honored to invite Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey to be my guest at the president&rsquo;s State of the Union address. Lt. Gov. Ramsey is a good friend and we are better off as a state because of his smart, conservative leadership.
Fighting against wasteful wind subsidies and calling for a free-market approach to energy
The wind production tax credit, a wasteful subsidy that props up wind over other forms of energy, expired Jan. 1, and I&rsquo;ve been leading the fight to keep Congress from renewing it. On Feb. 11, I gave a speech before the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, in which I said America is at a fork in the road on our national energy policy &ndash; one that will determine whether our country can compete in a 21 st -century economy. The surest path toward cheap, clean, reliable energy is to end Washington&rsquo;s obsession with wasteful energy subsidies and instead liberate our free enterprise system. Or, we can take the path of Germany, which is subsidizing domestic wind and solar and buying energy from other countries as part of a costly cap-and-trade scheme that drives up the cost of electricity and chases away jobs.
