Blaine's Bulletin
Sportsmen in this country have always been among the most vocal and active advocates for conservation and wildlife management. Dating back to our nations founding, American pioneers were the first to recognize the need to develop a set base of laws that would not restrict their rights.
Later, a fellow sportsman, President Theodore Roosevelt, called for the first laws that would restrict the commercial slaughter of wildlife and created hunting and fishing licenses. Those laws helped to create the foundation of a conservation model that would foster the greatest conservation successes America has ever seen.
Growing up in rural Missouri, I have always believed American sportsmen are some of the best stewards of the land throughout our great country. Thats why, this week I was proud to support the Sportsmens Heritage and Recreational Enhancement (SHARE) Act. This bill would remove federal red-tape that threatens to unnecessarily block access to certain public lands for hunting and fishing.
Put simply, this legislation would protect the traditional right of American sportsmen to continue to fish and hunt, enjoying the natural beauty of America and preserving a way of life without facing unnecessary and burdensome regulation.
Among its many pro-sportsmen provisions, the bill allows law abiding citizens to bear arms on Army Corps of Engineers land, protects the use of traditional ammunition and fishing tackle by limiting the Environmental Protection Agencys regulatory authority, and makes sure federal duck stamps can be purchased online.
Even if you do not hunt or fish yourself, rolling back this unnecessary federal red-tape will have a positive impact on our still struggling economy.
According to data compiled by the non-profit Congressional Sportsmens Foundation, the activities of Missouris 1.28 million hunters and fishermen contributed more than $1.67 billion to our states economy in 2013 alone, which supported nearly 29,000 Missouri jobs in diverse sectors like manufacturing, retail, dining, and hospitality just to name a few.
It is important for American families to be able to hand down the tradition of hunting and fishing from one generation to the next, and I will continue to advocate for bills that protect this right for our children and grandchildren as well as give a boost to the economies of our local communities.
