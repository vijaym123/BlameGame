I&rsquo;m asking for your urgent support for my husband.

Folks, I&rsquo;m asking for your urgent support for my husband.
Here&rsquo;s why:
-- The Election is only 72 HOURS away
-- poll after poll says Ami&rsquo;s race is neck and neck
-- and Republicans are spending more money against him than any Democrat in the country
Look, I can&rsquo;t imagine losing Ami&rsquo;s strong voice for Sacramento County in Congress.
Trust me, no one&rsquo;s working harder for Sacramento families than Ami.
But if we don&rsquo;t get behind him today, we may fall short on Election Night.
So I have a personal request:
Will you pitch in for Ami while there&rsquo;s still time to make a difference? I&rsquo;d deeply appreciate it.
