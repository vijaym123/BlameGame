Friends ,
Last week was National Small Business
Week, a time when the nation joins together to celebrate and thank our
small businesses.
Im a big fan of this observance because it
puts the focus where it should beon our innovators, workers,
entrepreneurs and job-creators who keep our economy moving forward.
There is no doubt that small businesses are critical to our national
economy. Americas small businesses are responsible for creating nearly 7
out of 10 new jobs and half of our workforce is employed at a small
business. In North Carolina, we have good reason to celebrate. We have
hundreds of thousands of top-notch small businesses - manufacturers,
retailers, restaurants, technology startups and hotels just to name a
few.
These are the workhorses that drive our local economy,
accounting for nearly 1.5 million
jobs.
While I travel the district, I try to stop by
as many small businesses as I can.
Sometimes this means
touring one of our renowned businesses, like Cape Fear Arsenal in
Lumberton, to talk with employees, view their operations and understand what I
can do to ensure our local businesses continue to grow, create jobs
and thrive. And other times, I just stop by while Im on my way through
town.
From visiting with our
local veterans at Carms Caf in Concord, to grabbing a delicious hot
dog for lunch at Haps Grill in Salisbury, to picking up a few shot
gun shells at Bobs Sporting Goods in Biscoe, or buying tools at
Rockingham Hardware in Rockingham,
Im committed to supporting our
districts small
businesses.
Although a lot of our small businesses success revolves around
traditional brick and mortar, a growing number are turning to the
internet.
The rapid growth of social media has changed the
landscape for small businesses by opening up new opportunities to reach
customers and requiring new strategies to be successful.
Think
about itfolks are spending more and more time online, and its
important small businesses meet them there. Thats why I joined Facebook and
the Cabarrus Regional Chamber of Commerce last week for Facebook Boost,
an event to equip our small businesses with the tools necessary to
compete in todays digital economy and connect Main Streets across our
state to customers across the
globe.

Concord
At the event, I was able to
speak firsthand with our entrepreneurs and workers.
This helps me
gain a better understanding of how Washingtons policies are impacting
jobs.
I am so impressed by those who work incredibly hard
every day to build quality businesses that provide employment
opportunities and foundations for growth in our local economy. Now more than
ever, its clear to me that we need a pro-growth plan that gets
government off the backs of our small businesses and returns power to American
workers and
entrepreneurs.
As youve probably heard me say before, my top three priorities
are jobs, jobs and jobs.
I understand our economy is made
stronger and jobs are created not by government, but by the hard work of
our small business owners and workers. I know you work hard - for
yourself, for your family and for our community - and thats why Im
fighting in Congress on your behalf.
See my jobs plan and tell me

God blessed me with a loving, caring
mother who helped make me who I am today. Thank you to all of our special
moms - happy Mother's
Day!

It was my honor to attend a home dedication in
Concord for one of North Carolinas decorated veterans, Staff Sergeant

Because our community

Last Thursday, on the
National Day of Prayer ,
millions of Americans joined together to ask God for His guidance and
protection during such trying
times.
While the turmoil
across the globe, the threat of radical Islam and terrorists, and the
regular attacks against our values trouble us, we can find comfort
in prayer and the word of God.
