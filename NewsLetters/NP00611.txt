Every year, the government spends
billions
in duplicative programs. In the first four annual reports issued by The Government Accountability Office (GAO) from 2011 through 2014, 188 areas were identified where opportunities existed for executive branch agencies or Congress to reduce, eliminate, or better manage fragmentation, overlap, or duplication; achieve cost savings; or enhance revenue. Most recently, the GAOs
2015 Annual Report
identified 12 new areas of fragmentation, overlap, or duplication in federal programs and activities.
This year, a resolution has been introduced in the House of Representatives aimed at cutting down on duplicative, underutilized, and unnecessary government programs.
H.RES.45
requires that, when Congress proposes the creation of a new program or initiative, lawmakers must justify to the American people why the program is necessary and how it adds value, ensuring that it's not duplicative to programs already in place.
Congressman Randy Forbes is a cosponsor of this bill.
