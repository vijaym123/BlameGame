President Obama asked for your help yesterday.
The Republicans are going all-in on smearing President Obama to win this election.
Can you chip in $5 or more today to fight back? Your donation will be TRIPLE-MATCHED:
President Obama wouldn&rsquo;t have emailed you yesterday if it wasn&rsquo;t critically important:
FIRST: Boehner&rsquo;s allies launched $2O,OOO,OOO in nasty Obama-bashing attacks this week.
THEN: The Huffington Post released a shocking report: Big money mastermind Karl Rove has devised an &ldquo;October outside spending surge.&rdquo; Now 21 billionaires and their families have poured nearly $2O,OOO,OOO into Republican super PACs.
We won&rsquo;t mince words: Boehner and Rove&rsquo;s assault could cost us the whole election.
David, control of Congress is at stake. President Obama&rsquo;s agenda is on the line. And we&rsquo;re in real danger of falling behind. According to our records, you haven&rsquo;t chipped in to President Obama&rsquo;s call-to-action.

Can you chip in something today? Even if it&rsquo;s just $5? We can still win this election -- but we need everyone to do their part.
