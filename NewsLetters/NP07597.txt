Friend,
It&#39;s hard to believe, but we&#39;re now only
100 days from election day.
And this July 31st, we will face our first important monthly deadline of the general election. For that reason, we&#39;re setting an important goal -
we need to raise $5000 by the close of business on Thursday at midnight.
You&#39;ve been terrific in your support, and because of you, we&#39;re in a good position. We&#39;ve opened two campaign offices and have signed up hundreds of volunteers. We&#39;ve hired our staff, and are laying out our race - all due to your support. Thank you.
Now, we have less than 100 days to raise the remainder of the funds we need - which is why we need to hit this next goal.
We know this race will be exceptionally close. The Wall Street Journal lists it as one of the 10 races to watch around the country (this includes all Senate and Governor races). We can&#39;t take any chances, and we have to remain vigilant. Most importantly, we have to stay ahead of my opponent, Doug Ose.
While he can dump millions into the race in one fell swoop, we rely on donors like you to help us hit our goals.
Please donate $5 or more now.
We expect Doug Ose to use millions of dollars of his own money to try and beat us.
The last time he ran, he did just that - to the tune of $5 million dollars.
We rely on individual donors like you, and my campaign is built on the belief that many individuals are stronger than one multimillionaire.
Lets prove that Doug Ose can&#39;t buy the 7th Congressional District - click here and give $5 or whatever you can now.
Thank you for supporting me.
Be Well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
PS - This $5000 goal is an important one - we&#39;re running out of time to raise the grassroots funds we need before our opponent writes a big check to try to buy this seat. Click here now and give $5 to help us hit our goal.
