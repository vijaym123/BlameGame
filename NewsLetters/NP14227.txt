Friends,
What is your overall impression of the federal health care law called
the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare? I approve of the health care
law. I disapprove of the health
care law. I like some
parts of the health care law, but have serious concerns about
others. No
opinion. Other. *By answering this
survey, you are subscribing to my newsletter. If you are having

I'm a firm believer that
no matter how you feel about the health care law, if you like your
current health plan, you
should
be able to keep
it. Unfortunately, that's not the case for millions of Americans who
have already received cancellation notices regarding their current
plans.
This must be fixed immediately, which is why last week,
the House passed the
Keep Your Health Plan Act .
It's a bipartisan bill that would protect millions of Americans from
losing their current health coverage.
I wasn't in Congress
when the Affordable Care Act passed, but I believe it's
our responsibility to now protect Americans from any negative consequences of
the law. This bipartisan bill was a positive step in that direction,
and I hope my colleagues in the Senate will take it up
immediately.
I'd like to thank the hundreds of you who have taken the time
to write, call or email me regarding your experience with the health
care law so far. Good or bad, I want to hear from you so please,
continue to contact me. If you have some time, take the brief survey above
to let me know how you feel. It's an honor to represent you, and I
look forward to hearing from you soon,
All the
best,
Dave
