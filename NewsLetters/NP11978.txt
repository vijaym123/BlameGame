Dear David Johnson,
Last month, when I returned home to Queens after a stressful (and
cold!) week in Washington, my 4-year-old son Brandon offered to take my
jacket and hang it up. My husband Wayne explained that Brandon had
recently learned in pre-kindergarten to hang up and be responsible for
his jacket, and he was eager to help me with mine upon my return home.
Delighted, I accepted the offer.
Because I'm frequently away from home in Washington, I'm often
struck by the pace of Brandon's development. But on this occasion, I
was particularly struck by this Pre-K experience. He was not only
thinking logically and acting productively, but even more importantly
was developing the social skills of communication and empathy. Brandon's
jacket project and others like it will be the pillars of his ability to
learn and succeed in life.
Unfortunately, many 4-year-olds in our community will go without
these crucial, formative experiences.
Either their parents cannot
afford a Pre-K education, or their teachers lack the resources to
provide it. Furthermore, these children and their parents don't have
high-priced DC lobbyists or special interests to fight for them.
It is therefore up to young parents such as me to speak up for
early childhood education in America.
For this reason, Congressman
Jared Polis and I recently introduced the Early Childhood Education
Professional Improvement Act, which would authorize grants for states
to develop and educate their Pre-K workforces. States receiving such
grants would use the funds to provide scholarships for Pre-K teachers
to pursue undergraduate degrees in early-childhood education or a
closely related field; support Pre-K teachers in attaining credentials,
licensures, or endorsements demonstrating competence in early childhood
education; and provide ongoing professional-development opportunities
to Pre-K teachers and teacher assistants.
By age 2, affluent children already know 30 percent more words
than children from lower-income homes. It is therefore crucial that
these children be afforded quality Pre-K opportunities, so they don't
fall further, and permanently, behind. Unfortunately, our
early-childhood educators are currently not up to the task. A recent
University of Virginia study found that in observations of preschool
classrooms across 11 states found that teachers in less than 15 percent
of the classes demonstrated "effective teacher-student interactions."
And more than in any other area of education, high-quality preschool is
dependent on high-quality interactions between teacher and pupil.
Study after study has shown that investing in early-childhood
education will make America stronger. Such an investment will reduce
our long-term debt, as it costs far less to educate our youth today
than deal with the consequences of not doing so tomorrow. It will
improve our economy, as it will yield a more educated and capable
workforce. And in a recent letter to Members of Congress, 400 retired
generals, admirals and other senior military leaders asserted that
national security would be imperiled if America doesn't act to improve
the quality of its preschool education.
In New York, we're fortunate to have a Mayor and Governor who
both support universal Pre-K, but there has been much debate and some
rancor about how to pay for it. Less discussed is the possibility of a
federal financial contribution to New York's efforts, and that's where
my bill comes in.
Let's give all our children the kinds of opportunities that
Brandon has been afforded, and let's make the right investments in a
bright future for our country. If we're a society that truly values
equality of opportunity, then we must invest in universal Pre-K and the
improvement of our early-childhood-education workforce.
Sincerely,
Grace Meng

Dear
David Johnson ,
Last
month,
when
I
returned
home
to
Queens
after
a
stressful
(and
cold!)
week
in
Washington,
my
4-year-old
son
Brandon
offered
to
take
my
jacket
and
hang
it
up.
My
husband
Wayne
explained
that
Brandon
had
recently
learned
in
pre-kindergarten
to
hang
up
and
be
responsible
for
his
jacket,
and
he
was
eager
to
help
me
with
mine
upon
my
return
home.
Delighted,
I
accepted
the
offer.
Because
I&#8217;m
frequently
away
from
home
in
Washington,
I&#8217;m
often
struck
by
the
pace
of
Brandon&#8217;s
development.
But
on
this
occasion,
I
was
particularly
struck
by
this
Pre-K
experience.
He
was
not
only
thinking
logically
and
acting
productively,
but
even
more
importantly
was
developing
the
social
skills
of
communication
and
empathy.
Brandon&#8217;s
jacket
project
and
others
like
it
will
be
the
pillars
of
his
ability
to
learn
and
succeed
in
life.
Unfortunately,
many
4-year-olds
in
our
community
will
go
without
these
crucial,
formative
experiences.
Either
their
parents
cannot
afford
a
Pre-K
education,
or
their
teachers
lack
the
resources
to
provide
it.
Furthermore,
these
children
and
their
parents
don&#8217;t
have
high-priced
DC
lobbyists
or
special
interests
to
fight
for
them.
It
is
therefore
up
to
young
parents
such
as
me
to
speak
up
for
early
childhood
education
in
America.
For
this
reason,
Congressman
Jared
Polis
and
I
recently
introduced
the
Early
Childhood
Education
Professional
Improvement
Act,
which
would
authorize
grants
for
states
to
develop
and
educate
their
Pre-K
workforces.
States
receiving
such
grants
would
use
the
funds
to
provide
scholarships
for
Pre-K
teachers
to
pursue
undergraduate
degrees
in
early-childhood
education
or
a
closely
related
field;
support
Pre-K
teachers
in
attaining
credentials,
licensures,
or
endorsements
demonstrating
competence
in
early
childhood
education;
and
provide
ongoing
professional-development
opportunities
to
Pre-K
teachers
and
teacher
assistants.
By
age
2,
affluent
children
already
know
30
percent
more
words
than
children
from
lower-income
homes.
It
is
therefore
crucial
that
these
children
be
afforded
quality
Pre-K
opportunities,
so
they
don&#8217;t
fall
further,
and
permanently,
behind.
Unfortunately,
our
early-childhood
educators
are
currently
not
up
to
the
task.
A
recent
University
of
Virginia
study
found
that
in
observations
of
preschool
classrooms
across
11
states
found
that teachers
in
less
than
15
percent
of
the
classes
demonstrated
&#8220;effective
teacher-student
interactions.&#8221;
And
more
than
in
any
other
area
of
education,
high-quality
preschool
is
dependent
on
high-quality
interactions
between
teacher
and
pupil.
Study
after
study
has
shown
that
investing
in
early-childhood
education
will
make
America
stronger.
Such
an
investment
will
reduce
our
long-term
debt,
as
it
costs
far
less
to
educate
our
youth
today
than
deal
with
the
consequences
of
not
doing
so
tomorrow.
It
will
improve
our
economy,
as
it
will
yield
a
more
educated
and
capable
workforce.
And
in
a
recent
letter
to
Members
of
Congress,
400
retired
generals,
admirals
and
other
senior
military
leaders
asserted
that
national
security
would
be
imperiled
if
America
doesn&#8217;t
act
to
improve
the
quality
of
its
preschool
education.
In
New
York,
we&#8217;re
fortunate
to
have
a
Mayor
and
Governor
who
both
support
universal
Pre-K,
but
there
has
been
much
debate
and
some
rancor
about
how
to
pay
for
it.
Less
discussed
is
the
possibility
of
a
federal
financial
contribution
to
New
York&#8217;s
efforts,
and
that&#8217;s
where
my
bill
comes
in.
Let&#8217;s
give
all
our
children
the
kinds
of
opportunities
that
Brandon
has
been
afforded,
and
let&#8217;s
make
the
right
investments
in
a
bright
future
for
our
country.
If
we&#8217;re
a
society
that
truly
values
equality
of
opportunity,
then
we
must
invest
in
universal
Pre-K
and
the
improvement
of
our
early-childhood-education
workforce.

Grace
