Congressman Andrews: Announcement of 'change and thanksgiving'
Haddon Heights, NJ - Today, Congressman Rob Andrews (NJ-01) issued the
following special announcement:
"I want to share today with my constituents and colleagues an
announcement about change and thanksgiving.
Nearly twenty four years ago, the people of South Jersey afforded me
the opportunity, responsibility and honor of serving as their
Representative in the United States House of Representatives.
Through
times of prosperity and recession, great social change and war and
peace, I have gratefully accepted that responsibility and for nearly
twenty four years given my all to the tasks before our country and our
community.
Over the years, there have been many occasions on which the possibility
of pursuing other paths in life have been presented to me. On each of
these occasions, I concluded that the right choice was to continue my
public service in the Congress.
In recent days, a new opportunity has
come to my attention, which will allow me to continue to serve my
community in the private sector, which I believe is in my family and my
best interest to accept.
The House has always been a place of high energy and healthy division,
and it remains so today. My decision is, however, most emphatically not
a political decision about what is happening in Washington--it is a
personal decision about the best path for my family. I am proud to
serve with members of both parties, Democratic and Republican, liberal
and conservative.
Reflecting on nearly twenty four years of my public service in
Congress, together, we have lived through the horrors of 9-11, mourned
at the funerals of sons and daughters who served in Afghanistan and
Iraq, visited the families of fallen officers and other lost first
responders, and elected our first African-American President.
Reflecting on my time of public service, I am also proud that, with our
dedicated office staff, we have been able to accomplish much in these
twenty-four years to improve our nation and our community.
I am proud that the Affordable Care Act will serve as a pillar of
progress much as Medicare, Social Security and the Civil Rights
legislation of the 1960s have built a stronger and more prosperous
America. Already today, nine million Americans have secured health
insurance coverage under the new law, and health care costs are rising
at their lowest rate in decades.
I am proud that the Direct Student Loan Program, which I co-authored,
has opened the door to college for generations of students and will
continue to do so. As Camille and I tackle the challenge of paying for
higher education for our two daughters, we know personally the
importance of this work to South Jersey and American families.
Working together locally across party lines to invest in jobs and
better transportation, we have supported several billion dollars worth
of projects that have been brought into our community.
In the last
five years,
nearly 1.5 billion in transportation improvements alone
were secured, such as the Direct Connection project at 295 and 42,
which will ease traffic and encourage growth in South Jersey. Just last
Friday, we learned that the State will fully support another 200
million dollar project connecting 42 and 295.
I am honored to have been able to fight for and help secure nearly 60
million dollars in critical funding for police, firefighters and first
responders to keep our communities and families safer. Dozens of South
Jersey communities have shared in this opportunity.
Today, hundreds of families live in safe and high quality housing in
the City of Camden because of the nearly 300 million dollars that we
have been able to help secure for the Camden Housing Authority.
My office's special commitment to our veterans, including ensuring
these true American heroes receive the benefits and honors they
deserve, has facilitated everything from transportation to hospitals,
disability benefits, and receipt of medals. Today, because of this
commitment, high quality VA outpatient health clinics exist in
Turnersville and Camden that see thousands of veterans each year.
I have had the privilege of nominating hundreds of amazing, intelligent
young men and women to our service academies and awarding First
Congressional District Scholarship Awards over one thousand outstanding
high school graduates. These South Jersey young men and women are our
nation's future.
And, most importantly, when, on approximately 150,000 occasions, you or
your neighbor has called, written, emailed or visited us about a
hospital or utility bill not paid, a health care company's refusal to
allow a critically necessary procedure, a scholarship applied for, a
job lost, a Visa not issued, child support, a desire to adopt a child
from a foreign country or foster a child from our community, Medicare
or Social Security problems, a parent who needs assisted living, job
training, a missing traffic light, or a disabling injury, we have been
here to help.
As I reflect on nearly 24 years of our service together, these very
individual and personal opportunities to make a difference in a
person's life stand out as my most memorable moments of service. So
many constituents in supermarkets or diners have graciously thanked us
for clearing up their Mom's Medicare bills or helping their Dad secure
his military medals from years ago. Recently, a couple proudly visited
this office with two teenage sons.
When those boys were toddlers, we
had helped them clear immigration so that they could be adopted.
Last
Friday, we were delighted to inform a disabled veteran on the verge of
losing his home that his application for full disability had been
granted.
As I reflect on nearly twenty four years of our work
together, these instances of changing people's lives mean the most.
I am profoundly thankful to so many people who have supported me and,
without whom, these accomplishments would not have been possible. I am
very thankful to my wife Camille and my daughters Jacquelyn and Josie,
whose love and commitment are the core of my life.
I am grateful to my staff and many interns, now and over the years, for
the hard work and great abilities they bring every day to the service
of our constituents.
They do a great job, and I thank them all. I have
asked the House leadership that these dedicated professionals remain in
place until my successor has been elected. Our constituents have
entrusted us with more than 5,500 open casework matters and will
continue to be served in this way by these dedicated and compassionate
professionals.
And, of course, I am most thankful of all to my constituents - the
people of South Jersey.
It has been an honor to serve them. There has
never been a day that I did not walk up the steps of the Capital
humbled that a Bellmawr son of a Shipyard worker, who never graduated
from high school, was given this opportunity to serve our great nation.
As this change in my family's life, I am humbled by the support and
friendship of so many.

Congressman
Andrews:
Announcement
of
&#8216;change
and
thanksgiving&#8217;
Haddon
Heights,
NJ
&#8211;
Today,
Congressman
Rob
Andrews
(NJ-01)
issued
the
following
special
announcement:
&#8220;I
want
to
share
today
with
my
constituents
and
colleagues
an
announcement
about
change
and
thanksgiving.
Nearly
twenty
four
years
ago,
the
people
of
South
Jersey
afforded
me
the
opportunity,
responsibility
and
honor
of
serving
as
their
Representative
in
the
United
States
House
of
Representatives.
Through
times
of
prosperity
and
recession,
great
social
change
and
war
and
peace,
I
have
gratefully
accepted
that
responsibility
and
for
nearly
twenty
four
years
given
my
all
to
the
tasks
before
our
country
and
our
community.
Over
the
years,
there
have
been
many
occasions
on
which
the
possibility
of
pursuing
other
paths
in
life
have
been
presented
to
me.
On
each
of
these
occasions,
I
concluded
that
the
right
choice
was
to
continue
my
public
service
in
the
Congress.
In
recent
days,
a
new
opportunity
has
come
to
my
attention,
which
will
allow
me
to
continue
to
serve
my
community
in
the
private
sector,
which
I
believe
is
in
my
family
and
my
best
interest
to
accept.
The
House
has
always
been
a
place
of
high
energy
and
healthy
division,
and
it
remains
so
today.
My
decision
is,
however,
most
emphatically
not
a
political
decision
about
what
is
happening
in
Washington--it
is
a
personal
decision
about
the
best
path
for
my
family.
I
am
proud
to
serve
with
members
of
both
parties,
Democratic
and
Republican,
liberal
and
conservative.
Reflecting
on
nearly
twenty
four
years
of
my
public
service
in
Congress,
together,
we
have
lived
through
the
horrors
of
9-11,
mourned
at
the
funerals
of
sons
and
daughters
who
served
in
Afghanistan
and
Iraq,
visited
the
families
of
fallen
officers
and
other
lost
first
responders,
and
elected
our
first
African-American
President.
Reflecting
on
my
time
of
public
service,
I
am
also
proud
that,
with
our
dedicated
office
staff,
we
have
been
able
to
accomplish
much
in
these
twenty-four
years
to
improve
our
nation
and
our
community.
I
am
proud
that
the
Affordable
Care
Act
will
serve
as
a
pillar
of
progress
much
as
Medicare,
Social
Security
and
the
Civil
Rights
legislation
of
the
1960s
have
built
a
stronger
and
more
prosperous
America.
Already
today,
nine
million
Americans
have
secured
health
insurance
coverage
under
the
new
law,
and
health
care
costs
are
rising
at
their
lowest
rate
in
decades.
I
am
proud
that
the
Direct
Student
Loan
Program,
which
I
co-authored,
has
opened
the
door
to
college
for
generations
of
students
and
will
continue
to
do
so.
As
Camille
and
I
tackle
the
challenge
of
paying
for
higher
education
for
our
two
daughters,
we
know
personally
the
importance
of
this
work
to
South
Jersey
and
American
families.
Working
together
locally
across
party
lines
to
invest
in
jobs
and
better
transportation,
we
have
supported
several
billion
dollars
worth
of
projects
that
have
been
brought
into
our
community.
In
the
last
five
years,
nearly
1.5
billion
in
transportation
improvements
alone
were
secured,
such
as
the
Direct
Connection
project
at
295
and
42,
which
will
ease
traffic
and
encourage
growth
in
South
Jersey.
Just
last
Friday,
we
learned
that
the
State
will
fully
support
another
200
million
dollar
project
connecting
42
and
295.
I
am
honored
to
have
been
able
to
fight
for
and
help
secure
nearly
60
million
dollars
in
critical
funding
for
police,
firefighters
and
first
responders
to
keep
our
communities
and
families
safer.
Dozens
of
South
Jersey
communities
have
shared
in
this
opportunity.
Today,
hundreds
of
families
live
in
safe
and
high
quality
housing
in
the
City
of
Camden
because
of
the
nearly
300
million
dollars
that
we
have
been
able
to
help
secure
for
the
Camden
Housing
Authority.
My
office's
special
commitment
to
our
veterans,
including
ensuring
these
true
American
heroes
receive
the
benefits
and
honors
they
deserve,
has
facilitated
everything
from
transportation
to
hospitals,
disability
benefits,
and
receipt
of
medals.
Today,
because
of
this
commitment,
high
quality
VA
outpatient
health
clinics
exist
in
Turnersville
and
Camden
that
see
thousands
of
veterans
each
year.
I
have
had
the
privilege
of
nominating
hundreds
of
amazing,
intelligent
young
men
and
women
to
our
service
academies
and
awarding
First
Congressional
District
Scholarship
Awards
over
one
thousand
outstanding
high
school
graduates.
These
South
Jersey
young
men
and
women
are
our
nation's
future.
And,
most
importantly,
when,
on
approximately
150,000
occasions,
you
or
your
neighbor
has
called,
written,
emailed
or
visited
us
about
a
hospital
or
utility
bill
not
paid,
a
health
care
company's
refusal
to
allow
a
critically
necessary
procedure,
a
scholarship
applied
for,
a
job
lost,
a
Visa
not
issued,
child
support,
a
desire
to
adopt
a
child
from
a
foreign
country
or
foster
a
child
from
our
community,
Medicare
or
Social
Security
problems,
a
parent
who
needs
assisted
living,
job
training,
a
missing
traffic
light,
or
a
disabling
injury,
we
have
been
here
to
help.
As
I
reflect
on
nearly
24
years
of
our
service
together,
these
very
individual
and
personal
opportunities
to
make
a
difference
in
a
person's
life
stand
out
as
my
most
memorable
moments
of
service.
So
many
constituents
in
supermarkets
or
diners
have
graciously
thanked
us
for
clearing
up
their
Mom's
Medicare
bills
or
helping
their
Dad
secure
his
military
medals
from
years
ago.
Recently,
a
couple
proudly
visited
this
office
with
two
teenage
sons.
When
those
boys
were
toddlers,
we
had
helped
them
clear
immigration
so
that
they
could
be
adopted.
Last
Friday,
we
were
delighted
to
inform
a
disabled
veteran
on
the
verge
of
losing
his
home
that
his
application
for
full
disability
had
been
granted.
As
I
reflect
on
nearly
twenty
four
years
of
our
work
together,
these
instances
of
changing
people's
lives
mean
the
most.
I
am
profoundly
thankful
to
so
many
people
who
have
supported
me
and,
without
whom,
these
accomplishments
would
not
have
been
possible.
I
am
very
thankful
to
my
wife
Camille
and
my
daughters
Jacquelyn
and
Josie,
whose
love
and
commitment
are
the
core
of
my
life.
I
am
grateful
to
my
staff
and
many
interns,
now
and
over
the
years,
for
the
hard
work
and
great
abilities
they
bring
every
day
to
the
service
of
our
constituents.
They
do
a
great
job,
and
I
thank
them
all.
I
have
asked
the
House
leadership
that
these
dedicated
professionals
remain
in
place
until
my
successor
has
been
elected.
Our
constituents
have
entrusted
us
with
more
than
5,500
open
casework
matters
and
will
continue
to
be
served
in
this
way
by
these
dedicated
and
compassionate
professionals.
And,
of
course,
I
am
most
thankful
of
all
to
my
constituents
&#8211;
the
people
of
South
Jersey.
It
has
been
an
honor
to
serve
them.
There
has
never
been
a
day
that
I
did
not
walk
up
the
steps
of
the
Capital
humbled
that
a
Bellmawr
son
of
a
Shipyard
worker,
who
never
graduated
from
high
school,
was
given
this
opportunity
to
serve
our
great
nation.
As
this
change
in
my
family's
life,
I
am
humbled
by
the
support
and
friendship
of
so
many.
