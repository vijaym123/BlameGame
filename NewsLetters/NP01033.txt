Microbeads = mega-problems
Dear Friend,
Yesterday, members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerces Subcommittee on Health held a legislative hearing on microbeads.
So what are microbeads?
Microbeads are those tiny little scrubbers in your soap, cleaners, and even toothpaste. On their own, they are nearly invisible, smaller than a pinhead. But once theyve been flushed down the drain is when the real problems begin. Because they are so small, they escape water filtration systems and end up in our bodies of water, including the Great Lakes. They are known to absorb pollutants, and are often mistaken as food by fish and wildlife.
Simply put: microbeads are causing mega-problems.
This is why Im committed to working in a bipartisan manner to solve this problem. Ive cosponsored legislation, authored by Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone, D-New Jersey, that would require the Food and Drug Administration to prohibit the sale or distribution of personal care products containing microbeads by January 1, 2018. This legislation, H.R. 1321, the
Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2015 , would also establish a national standard to protect the environment and ensure that manufacturers do not face a patchwork of State laws.
As someone who grew up on Lake Michigan, I understand firsthand how important it is to maintain the beauty and integrity of our Great Lakes. The Great Lakes have survived many a foe
severe pollution, oil spills, discharge from refineries, zebra mussels, and attempts to steal our water
just to name a few. Our fight against Asian Carp also continues.
I will not stand for any activity that puts our beloved Great Lakes in jeopardy.
As the
Holland Sentinel
editorialized in March, Theres no reason keeping our faces clean should require us to trash our lakes.
I agree.
