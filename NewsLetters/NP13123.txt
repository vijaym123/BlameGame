Senator Shaheen spoke on the Senate floor this week to highlight New
Hampshire priorities in the bipartisan appropriations
bill.
Dear friend,
This week Republicans and Democrats finally came
together and agreed on a bipartisan bill to fund the government for
the rest of 2014. The plan we passed supports New Hampshire job
creation, economic growth, and our national security through investments at
our shipyard and Air National Guard Base. It also protects us from the
economic consequences of another government shutdown and cuts wasteful
spending in a smart, targeted way. Together, it represents the kind of
bipartisan compromise we need more of in Washington.
I was
pleased that this
budget contained so many
important provisions for New Hampshire
including:
Disaster relief funding for New England fisherman
A
fix to a Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) for disabled
veterans
Military construction resources for the Portsmouth Naval
Shipyard
Resources to complete the activation of the Federal
Corrections Institution (FCI) in Berlin
Funding for the
Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program
(LIHEAP)
Authorization for the continued development of the new KC-46A aerial
refueling tanker to be based at Pease Air National Guard
Base
This budget will help provide the certainty that small
businesses in New Hampshire and across the country need so badly. It makes
smart investments in New Hampshires future, and it was one that I was
proud to support.
I'm hopeful that we can build off this
bipartisan cooperation and work together to continue to grow the economy
and create jobs.
Sincerely,
Jeanne
Shaheen
