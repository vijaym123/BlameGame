To all who have served,
Today, and every day, we honor Americans who have served to protect freedom around the world. Recently, I had the distinct honor of presenting service medals and awards to veterans and their families.
Mr. Hank Beck was awarded the World War II Victory Medal, the United States Navy WWII Discharge Button, and the Honorable Service Lapel Pin.
Mrs. Judy Hanks and her family received medals, including the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart, for her father, Private Raymond Lee Clevenger, who died serving his country with the 517th Parachute Infantry 1st Airborne Task Force in France during World War II.
Ms. Gail Merkle received medals, including the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Purple Heart, earned by her uncle Corporal Howard P. Merkle, who served in the Army in Korea. Corporal Merkle was killed in action under extreme enemy fire on March 14, 1951.
Mr. Howard Anthony Constable received the Navy Good Conduct Medal, the World War II Victory Medal, the American Campaign Medal, and five other awards in honor of his service in World War II.
Please join me in honoring these heroes and all who have served in our Armed Forces on this Veterans Day.
