Friends,
Overregulation is
hurting hardworking Nebraska families and placing burdens on business
owners. This month, I wanted to share with you a video showing the
consequences of costly and misguided federal regulations and how I'm
working to cut through this red tape. Click

Pressing for Answers and Accountability at the IRS
I
wrote IRS Commissioner John Koskinen regarding a recent Treasury
report showing a number of IRS employees received bonuses despite being
cited for misconduct
including failure to pay taxes.
Rather than
rewarding government employees for bad behavior, the IRS should fire
these tax delinquents, pursuant to current law. I will continue to
demand accountability for this mismanagement at the IRS

Improving Job Training
to Get Americans Back to Work
I remain focused on
helping unemployed Americans find good-paying jobs.
I introduced an
amendment that would have helped local job training centers provide men
and women with tools to start their own businesses. Unfortunately the
Senate Majority Leader did now allow a vote on my commonsense measure

Another
proposal I offered this month to address gender-based pay discrimination
included a provision to help close the job opportunity gap. This measure
would help provide men and women with skills to grow and compete in
industries that report worker shortages due to a lack of candidates with
the necessary training

Encouraging Businesses to Hire More
Veterans
Im working on creative ways to encourage small business owners
to hire veterans. The Hire More Heroes Act would provide incentives
to job creators by removing one of the burdensome requirements of
ObamaCare preventing small businesses from hiring

Protecting Producers from More
Heavy-Handed Regulation
I recently joined several of my
colleagues in urging USDA, DOE, and EPA to refrain from pursuing
regulations on livestock emissions as part of the administrations climate
change plan. The agriculture community works hard to protect our
natural resources. More heavy-handed regulations will only create
unnecessary burdens and increase costs for consumers

PHOTOS OF THE MONTH
Senator
Johanns and I met with students from North Bend, Milford, and Clearwater
Orchard high schools during their weeklong Close-Up trip to Washington,
D.C.
The Senate
Armed Services Committee held a hearing with military leaders to discuss
budget requests and defense priorities for the upcoming fiscal year.
During the Senates recent state work period, I spent time in 15
communities across eastern and south central Nebraska. I held an open coffee
in Red Cloud, where I was able to speak directly with Nebraskans about
the concerns and issues on their minds.
I also enjoyed having lunch and discussing
education issues with student leaders and faculty at Alma Public
Schools.
