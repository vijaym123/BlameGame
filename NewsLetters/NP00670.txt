Dear Friend,
When we think of World War II, our thoughts often go to Pearl Harbor and the surprise attack by Japan that catapulted us into war. Just a few days ago, Sidney and I had the honor to stand on the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial, to reflect on the horror of that fateful day and to remember with profound gratitude the sacrifice so many fathers, husbands and sons made that day.
Today, on the island of Guam, a U. S. Territory, I had the sobering opportunity to participate in a wreath laying ceremony at Guam Veterans Cemetery where many of those who died when they liberated Guam from the Japanese in 1944 are buried.
Yesterday, I saw this photo on the wall at Joint Region Marianas Headquarters on Guam.
The caption below it reads "U. S. Coast Guardsmen and Marines join in prayer a few hours before storming the beaches of Guam. July 21, 1944."
Memorial Day is such a solemn day of remembrance by our nation of those who have given their lives in service and protection of America. It is a debt we can never repay, but we can honor them by remembering that they are the reason our great country is like no other in the world. We can also honor their memories by realizing that our freedom is so precious and can never be taken for granted. Let us remember what Christ said in Matthew 5:4 "Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. May God bless America!
Sincerely yours,
Gregg Harper
