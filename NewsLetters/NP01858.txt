You&rsquo;ve seen how disastrous this GOP Congress has been -- can you imagine how bad things would get if they took the White House AND Congress?
David -- You&rsquo;ve been a strong Democratic supporter in the past. So I was surprised to see from your record that you haven&rsquo;t renewed your DSCC membership for 2015 yet:
DSCC Membership Status:
pending
2015 Membership Rate:
$3
(renew now)
I&rsquo;m not kidding when I say we need you more than ever. You&rsquo;ve seen how disastrous this GOP Congress has been -- can you imagine how bad things would get if they took the White House AND Congress? Really, REALLY bad.
But we can stop them with your help.
Our
Back to Blue project
will spend the next two years pushing a robust progressive agenda that includes raising the minimum wage and protecting Social Security and Medicare. We&rsquo;ll hammer vulnerable Republicans in blue and purple states on their failed policies, and we&rsquo;ll win back the majority.
We&rsquo;ll make sure the next Democratic president has a Democratic Senate to work with.
But before we can launch on April 1, we desperately need another 18,000 Democrats to renew their membership. Will you join our Back to Blue campaign?
