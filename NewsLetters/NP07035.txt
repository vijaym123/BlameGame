David --
I know you&rsquo;re getting a lot of emails all of a sudden on this&hellip;
Nancy Pelosi, President Obama, and now me. Again.
Trust me: We wouldn&rsquo;t keep emailing, if we didn&rsquo;t
really
need your help:
Republican outside groups are outspending us 2-to-1 in key races. That&rsquo;s DOUBLE!
Our big fundraising deadline is in 24 HOURS.
As of 9am, we&rsquo;re still coming up 23,675 donations short of our goal. If we can't close this gap, we&rsquo;ll risk handing even more power to the Republicans. This is a make or break moment right here. Can I count you in? All Gifts Today Triple-Matched! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
Joe
