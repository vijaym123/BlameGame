CELEBRATING THE PATH: On Saturday, June 14, I attended the kick-off event of a month-long celebration to recognize that the 30-mile PATH hike/bike trail system, connecting Lithonia in DeKalb County to the Monastery of the Holy Spirit in Rockdale County, is now complete. With a grant from the National Park Foundation, Arabia Mountain National Heritage Area has designated June as "Try the Trail" month and has activities planned throughout the month. It was great to be a part of the ribbon cutting at the Monastery of the Holy Spirit. For more, click HERE .
HELPING THE HOMELESS: I'm pleased to announce more than $16 million in Housing and Urban Development (HUD) grants to provide permanent and transitional housing to homeless persons and their families in Georgia's Fourth Congressional District. These grants are the life blood of our efforts to end homelessness and help those who are experiencing both long-term homelessness as well as families confronting a sudden economic crisis. As our economy continues to recover, we must ensure everyone - no matter their circumstances - benefits from our efforts. For more, click HERE .

I served up my world-famous strawberry cobbler. It was a great opportunity to fellowship and share some incredible food with supporters.
All the chefs outdid themselves.
The annual event allows men who are members of the church, community leaders, and government officials, to serve up their dishes in support of the youth ministry.

Dear
F riends,
It was my great honor to present Snellville with a United States flag that flew over the Capitol in Washington, D.C., for their third annual Flag Day celebration on June 13 at City Hall.
Getting the opportunity to spend time with residents, city officials, public safety personnel and veterans was very special to me. I got a chance to share some thoughts on our nation&#8217;s banner after traveling
to Normandy, France, recently for the very humbling experience of celebrating 70 years since the Allied Invasion on D-Day &#8211; June 6, 1944.
It was our freedom &#8211; our very way of life &#8211; that was at stake during WWII, and I was honored to shake the hands of every veteran I could during the ceremony.
