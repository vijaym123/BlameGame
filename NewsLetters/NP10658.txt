Dear Friend,
Thank you for subscribing to my email updates. I appreciate your
continued interest and value this opportunity to share with you what
I'm doing in Washington and the 15th District. For more ways to stay in
touch, click on the social networking sites below.
Legislative Breakfast
Last weekend, I addressed Washington County Farm Bureau members
gathered at Little Nashville Restaurant in Nashville for their
legislative breakfast. Also speaking were State Senators David
Luechtefeld and Kyle McCarter and State Rep. Charlie Meier.
Subcommittee Acts To Keep Administration From Ceding Internet Control
On Thursday, the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on
Communications and Technology approved legislation I authored to
protect the free and open Internet. H.R. 4342
, the
Domain Openness Through Continued Oversight Matters (DOTCOM) Act, would
require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to review any
proposal to cede current U.S. Internet oversight responsibilities to a
group of international stakeholders.
The United States, through the National Telecommunications Information
Administration (NTIA) at the Department of Commerce, currently oversees
the matching of the numerical Internet Protocol (IP) address an
Internet browser needs to find a website (173.194.33.7, for example)
with that website's easier-to-remember domain name (google.com, in this
example). This matching process, administered for the U.S. by the
California-based Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
(ICANN), makes navigating the Internet possible for the average user.
Imagine the havoc and confusion a country like Russia could wreak on
the world if such authority were to fall into its hands. Typing in
cnn.com could take you to a Russian propaganda site. Or typing in
freedomworks.org could bring up nothing at all. Free and open access to
the Internet could be at risk. Click below to hear more of my concerns.
IRS Tax Breaks Are Available For Victims Of November Tornadoes
Victims of last November's tornadoes should be aware of the federal tax
relief available to them. Taxpayers in federally declared disaster
areas may deduct personal property losses that were not covered by
insurance or reimbursed through other means.
The IRS made this announcement last year, but I wanted to take this
opportunity to make sure that local residents who may be affected have
one more voice reminding them before the tax filing deadline April 15.
The federal disaster declaration included the counties of Champaign,
Douglas, Fayette, Jasper, Massac, Pope, Vermillion, Wabash, Washington,
and Wayne in the 15th Congressional District. The complete IRS
announcement is available online
.
Americans Will Work Until April 21 To Meet This Year's Tax Bill
Tax Freedom Day, the day on which Americans have earned enough income
to pay off the total federal, state, and local tax bill, comes on April
21, 111 days into the year and three days later than in 2013, according
to the Tax Foundation.
Although the national date arrives six days after the deadline for
filing taxes, each state's total tax burden varies greatly. Louisiana's
Tax Freedom Day, March 30, is the earliest. Tied for the latest date,
May 9, are New Jersey and Connecticut. Illinoisans work until April 28
to meet their tax obligations.
Americans will spend more on taxes in 2014 than they will on food,
clothing, and housing combined. They will pay $3 trillion in federal
taxes and $1.5 trillion in state and local taxes. A full report is on
the Tax Foundation's website
.
Announcements
All Academy Nights: The first of two All Academy Nights that I am
co-hosting with Congressman Rodney Davis (R, Illinois-13) will be
tomorrow, April 14, at the Armory, 600 East University Avenue in
Urbana. Students, parents, administrators, and guidance counselors are
all welcome to hear from representatives of each of the military
service academies and to discuss the nomination process with
Congressional staff. The second program will be April 28 at The Commons
on the campus of Lewis and Clark Community College, 5800 Godfrey Road,
Godfrey. Doors will open at 6:30 p.m. each night, with the events
officially beginning at 7 p.m. Please RSVP to Jennifer White of
Congressman Davis' office by email at Jen.White@mail.house.gov. For
more information on the academies or my nomination process, contact
Dora Rohan at (618) 288-7190.
Art Contest Deadline Thursday: High school students who wish to enter
the 2014 Congressional Art Competition for my 15th District must submit
their entries by Thursday, April 17, to any of my district offices.
Acceptable mediums include: paintings, drawings, collages, prints,
photographs, computer-generated art, and mixed media. Complete details
are on my website
. For additional information,
contact my Danville office at (217) 446-0664.
Stubblefield Memorial Scholarship: Family and friends have established
a scholarship in memory of Sara Elizabeth Stubblefield, who developed
epilepsy as a high school junior but went on to be valedictorian of her
graduating class, a 1996 honors graduate of Greenville College, and to
earn a Masters Degree in Social Work from Washington University in
1998. She was a fearless advocate for epilepsy education and research
who died much too young in 2011 at age 36. The recipient of the Sara
Elizabeth Stubblefield Memorial Scholarship, a one-year, $2,000 award,
should be a student who has shown courage in dealing with epilepsy and
seizure, commitment to her/his education, and perseverance in
eliminating the obstacles that epilepsy and seizures may present. The
application, due April 30, 2014, and more information are available
online
