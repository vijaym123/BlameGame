Dear Friend, Tomorrow, we have to report our numbers to the FEC for our pre-primary deadline.
I want to be able to show everyone -- not just the FEC but also the special interests who are watching our race -- just how strong Ed&rsquo;s network is. We have 32 hours left to reach our $25,000 goal. Put your shoulder to the wheel by making a $5 contribution right now.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Every goal we set is vital to this campaign, and any time we miss a goal, we have to make decisions about where to allocate resources. When we hit these goals, we can run one of the best campaigns in the country -- but if we miss our targets, we can&rsquo;t follow through on what we know is a winning plan. Help us reach our $25,000 goal by chipping in $5 before our deadline.
Thanks for helping Ed.
