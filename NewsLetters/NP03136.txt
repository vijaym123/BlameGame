State of the Union
Response
Click
here to watch Congressman Yoder's response to the State of the Union
Address.
Like many Kansans, I was interested to hear
the Presidents ideas on how we could solve many of the challenges
facing our country. Kansans are tired of the broken policies of the
past, and they are hopeful that the President will work with this new
Congress to actually get things done for the American people. Kansans know
that taxes are too high, that federal deficits are too large, and
that while there may be plenty of high paying jobs in Washington, there
arent enough at home in Kansas.
Sadly, the President decided to turn back the clock and double down on
those very broken policies that have hurt our country, slowed growth,
and dimmed the lights of our economic
future.
Even worse,
the President missed an opportunity to unite our country, and instead
he embraced the tired cynical politics that pit one group of America
against another and weaken and divide our
country.
Conversely, the House of Representatives has already
begun to lay out its positive vision for a brighter economic future for
our children and grandchildren. Weve begun to pass legislation that
will create energy jobs, jobs for veterans,
that will secure our
borders, remove regulations and keep taxes down on hard working American
families.
We must look forward, past the politics of division
that have held us back. Lets unite
and grow the economy for
everyone
lets encourage investment and saving
lets be that Shining City
on the Hill
the beacon of hope and freedom from around the
world.
House to Consider Legislation Expanding 529 College
Savings Accounts
Last week, President Obama traveled to The University of Kansas, just
two days after announcing a tax hike that would be devastating to many
of the families in Kansas who save to send their children to college
in Lawrence. Taxing the 529 college savings accounts of families who
have responsibly planned for their childrens future will make it that
much harder for struggling families to send their children to KU or
other institutions.
Rest assured,
I will work in the House of Representatives to stop the President's
proposal to tax family education savings from going forward and instead
will work to provide positive solutions to make higher education more
affordable for all, rather than placing one more governmental burden
on the opportunities of young Americans.
March
for Life
Last week, millions of Americans
showed up for the annual March for Life in Washington, DC. I was
excited that many of you made the trip from the Third District to
Washington for such an important cause. My office in DC hosted an Open House
with refreshments for particpants, and it was great to see so many of
you stop by.
I was especially honored to host
Archbishop Joseph Naumann of Kansas City, Kansas for a visit while he is
in town to participate in the March for Life. We discussed our shared
belief in the sanctity of life and opportunities to fight for the
protection of the unborn
Additionally, I have cosponsored two
important pieces of legislation that reflect my belief in the sanctity
of life, and my commitment to promoting the protection of life
wherever possible.
Pain
Capable Unborn Child Act -
HR
36
Prohibits an abortion
of an unborn child past 20 weeks after fertilization. Medical evidence
has shown that post-20 weeks, a child is capable of feeling pain.
This is not only the right thing to do, but it is also supported by most
of America, with 80% of respondents telling Gallup in 2013 they are
against third-trimester
abortions.
Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition
Act -
HR
217
Preserves taxpayer dollars and protects life by
prohibiting Title X family planning grants from being used by
organizations that provide abortions. These grants, even before Roe v. Wade, were
never supposed to be used in programs where abortions are used as a
family planning method. However, organizations like Planned Parenthood
continue to receive hundreds of millions of dollars to subsidize their
abortions.
Every Child
is a Blessing Act -
HR
281
Prohibits the recovery
of damages in a wrongful life or wrongful birth civil actions based on
a claim that but for the defendant's actions, a child would not have
been born. In these cases, the suit revolves around the claim that the
plaintiff would have aborted their child if they had known it was
going to be born disabled. Such lawsuits are demeaning and discriminatory
towards children with
disabilities.
It is my hope that with the new Republican Senate, these bills
will be quickly passed and sent to the Presidents desk for
approval.
Cosponsorships
Here are some of the
bills that I've joined as a cosponsor this week. I look forward to the
House of Representatives taking up these important pieces of
legislation as we move forward in the new Congress.
ObamaCare
Repeal Act -
HR
132
This bill does exactly what the title says it does. It repeals
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and restores
the provisions of law that were amended by it. Repealing and replacing
Obamacare with market-oriented health insurance solution remains a top
priority of mine in Congress.
Patient Freedom Act -
HR 143
Repeals
the individual mandate in Obamacare. Until we can achieve a full
repeal, we must also try to strip the law of its most toxic
features.
Federal Reserve Transparency Act -
HR 24
Provides for an
audit of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the
Federal Reserve banks. Bringing transparency to the federal
government also remains a top priority, and this bill takes an important step
towards doing just that.
Balanced Budget
Amendment -
HJ Res
2
Amends the Constitution to require a balanced budget each year. If
American families have to balance their budgets, so too should the
federal government.
Six-Day Mail Service Resolution -
H Res
12
Until Congress and the Post Office can develop a rational plan to address
shortfalls, I believe it is important to maintain six-day service,
which provides necessary coverage for seniors and those in rural Kansas
who don't have access to delivery services on a daily
basis.
First Baptist Church in KCK
Congressman Yoder presenting an American flag flown
over the US Capitol to First Baptist Church.
I was
honored to visit First Baptist Church in Kansas City, Kansas and present
them with an American flag that was flown over the United States
Capitol on November 23, 2014, the churchs 155th anniversary. This
historical congregation was formed by a small group of freed African-American
slaves in 1859 before Kansas was officially a state. I visited their
beautiful church that was built in 1919 and met with Rev. Cedric Rowan,
staff, and church leaders who continue to build on their legacy in the
community.
Kansas Contractors Association
Congressman Yoder addressing the Kansas Contractors
Association convention in Kansas City.
On Friday, I enjoyed
speaking at the Kansas Contractors Association convention in Kansas City.
I spoke about my priorities for the new Congress and highlighted how
they differ from the President's priorities outlined in the State of
the Union. I also addressed the need for a serious, long-term
transportation plan that can shore up the highway trust fund without raising the
gas tax. As the economy finally begins to get back on track, tax
increases are the last thing we need.
Fact of the Week
Kansas families are currently investing in
around 185,000 529 College Savings Accounts, setting aside a total of
$4.57 billion for their children's college
education.
President Obama announced at the State of the Union that
he will ask for a tax hike on these types of investment
accounts.

Arthritis Caucus
I was proud
to rejoin the Congressional Arthritis Caucus for the 114th Congress.
The caucus exists to raise awareness about arthritis among Members of
Congress and their constituents alike, while working towards supporting
federal and local efforts to address arthritis and its impact on our
communities.
Click here for more information on the
Congressional Arthritis Caucus.
Statistics
from the Arthritis Foundation:
More than 50 million
Americans are inflicted with arthritis.
More than 1 in 20
adults have to change jobs or stop working entirely due to the
effects of arthritis.
Arthritis disproportionately effects minority
populations, with 44.6% of Non-Hispanic Blacks and 43.2% of Hispanics
with arthritis reporting activity limitation.
