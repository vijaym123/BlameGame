Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and the House Republicans just
released their budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2015.
Every year, the President and the House Majority, in this case the
Republicans, release their own proposed budgets for the Congress to
consider. Each of these separate budget proposals represents a unique
perspective on the current status of our country, as well as a unique
vision of its future. The budget process, while arduous at times, is a
critical part of governing the United States; and each respective
proposal deserves attention, debate, and analysis.
While I strongly disagreed with Rep. Ryan's budget proposal last year,
and supported the Democratic budget, in the end, the Congress adopted a
compromise budget. I am hopeful that the spirit of compromise will
continue into 2014.

District Techies
This year marks the first annual Congressional Science, Technology,
Engineering and Math (STEM) Academic Competition, the "House Student
App Challenge."
Established by Members of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2013,
this competition is a nationwide event that allows high school students
from across the country to compete by creating and exhibiting their
software application, or "app," for mobile, tablet, or computer devices
on a platform of their choice. Throughout the completion period,
participating students will be provided opportunities to engage with
various STEM educational partners located within the community to
mentor and assist them with their app development. This competition is
designed to engage student's creativity and encourage their
participation in STEM education fields.
The "House Student App Challenge" is open to all high school students
in the 47th District. Students entering the competition must submit
their app's source code online during the Competition Submission Period
between 9 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on February 1, 2014, and 8:59 p.m.
Pacific Standard Time on April 30, 2014, as well as provide a YouTube
or VIMEO video demo explaining their app and what they learned through
this competition process.

Comprehensive Immigration Reform: Call For An Immediate Vote
Last week, I signed a discharge petition on H.R. 15, a bipartisan
comprehensive immigration reform bill. The bill is based on S.744, the
bipartisan bill passed by the U.S. Senate in June, 2013. H.R. 15
secures our borders, creates an earned clear pathway to citizenship,
and increases economic opportunities for all Americans. Furthermore,
passing this bill will save our country $900 billion over the next two
decades. This is why I spoke on the House floor in support of the
discharge petition, which could bring the bill to the House floor for
an immediate vote if it reaches 218 signatures. As of Wednesday, there
were 190 signatures.

Healthcare Enrollment Reaches 7.1 Million
More than 7.1 million Americans signed up for private insurance on the
health insurance marketplaces set up by the Affordable Care Act during
the first enrollment period that ended March 31. The law may not be
perfect, but it is working and helping millions of Americans. I am so
proud of the enrollment numbers, and I look forward to making the
Affordable Care Act work even better.

Supreme Court Rules On Campaign Money
Regrettably, in this week's McCutcheon vs. FEC decision, the Supreme
Court ruled in favor of big money in politics. The floodgates have now
been opened even wider than before - giving corporations and the
wealthiest few the green light to pour even greater amounts of money
into political campaigns. This is a serious blow to our democracy.
Now, more than ever, Congress needs to redouble its efforts in passing
campaign finance reform, including Congressman John Sarbanes'
"Government by the People Act" and a constitutional amendment to
overturn the Citizens United decision.
Proposed Budgets vs. Continuing Resolutions
Each year, the President releases a proposed budget, where it is then
given to Congress for their review. Congress then creates several
separate bills, called appropriations bills, that authorize government
spending that could be similar or completely different from what was in
the President's proposed budget.
If Congress cannot agree to spending levels in either the President's
proposed budget or in their appropriations bills, then they vote on a
Continuing Resolution (CR), which is a short-term bill to fund the
government. The CR is temporary measure that keeps the current level of
funding so that Congress has time to work out a longer term spending
plan. To keep the federal government running in the event of a failure
to pass a full budget, Congress must pass the CR, or the government
risks being shut down.
Do you think the President should utilize his executive authority on
issues that are unable to be decided upon by Congress?
47.7 %
Yes - Congress is currently too divided to pass effective
legislation, therefore the President must act whenever and wherever he
can
10.1 %
Maybe - He should only use his executive authority when it is a
matter of national security
41.1 %
No - It is an overreach of his Presidential duties
0.0 %
I do not know

Supreme
Court
Rules
On
Campaign
Money
Regrettably,
in
this
week&#8217;s
McCutcheon
vs.
FEC
decision,
the
Supreme
Court
ruled
in
favor
of
big
money
in
politics.
The
floodgates
have
now
been
opened
even
wider
than
before
&#8211;
giving
corporations
and
the
wealthiest
few
the
green
light
to
pour
even
greater
amounts
of
money
into
political
campaigns.
This
is
a
serious
blow
to
our
democracy.
Now,
more
than
ever,
Congress
needs
to
redouble
its
efforts
in
passing
campaign
finance
reform,
including
Congressman
John
Sarbanes&#8217;
&#8220;Government
by
the
People
Act&#8221;
and
a
constitutional
amendment
to
overturn
the
Citizens
United
decision.
Proposed
Budgets
vs.
Continuing
Resolutions
Each
year,
the
President
releases
a
proposed
budget,
where
it
is
then
given
to
Congress
for
their
review.
Congress
then
creates
several
separate
bills,
called
appropriations
bills,
that
authorize
government
spending
that
could
be
similar
or
completely
different
from
what
was
in
the
President&#8217;s
proposed
budget.
If
Congress
cannot
agree
to
spending
levels
in
either
the
President&#8217;s
proposed
budget
or
in
their
appropriations
bills,
then
they
vote
on
a
Continuing
Resolution
(CR),
which
is
a
short-term
bill
to
fund
the
government.
The
CR
is
temporary
measure
that
keeps
the
current
level
of
funding
so
that
Congress
has
time
to
work
out
a
longer
term
spending
plan.
To
keep
the
federal
government
running
in
the
event
of
a
failure
to
pass
a
full
budget,
Congress
must
pass
the
CR,
or
the
government
risks
being
shut
down.
Do
you
think
the
President
should
utilize
his
executive
authority
on
issues
that
are
unable
to
be
decided
upon
by
Congress?
47.7
%
Yes
-
Congress
is

10.1

Maybe
-
He
should
only
use
his
executive
authority
when
it
is
a
matter
of
national
security
