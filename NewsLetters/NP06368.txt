You&rsquo;re probably used to seeing this:
David Johnson Chipped in to Defeat Koch-Funded Republicans? NO DONATION Deadline: 11:59 PM Suggested Support: $5.OO
Let us explain&hellip; We have a simple theory: we&rsquo;d rather have lots of grassroots Democrats
chip in $5 , than rely on massive checks from Big Oil billionaires. Makes sense, right?
But here&rsquo;s the catch: our grassroots strategy only works if everyone does their part. And according to our records, you haven&rsquo;t contributed to back up President Obama this month.
We appreciate everything you&rsquo;ve already done -- truly, we do. But we&rsquo;re in a rough spot right now. The Republicans are already outspending us in key races -- and our mid-month fundraising deadline is TONIGHT.
At times like this, we turn to you.
David -- can we count on you? MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: ALL GIFTS MATCHED! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
