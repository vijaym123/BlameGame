Dear Friend,
Thank you very much for signing up for our eNewsletter. I appreciate
the opportunity to serve as your Representative. I wanted to give you
this update on our activities in the Second District and Washington, D.C
At the Hugo town hall event speaking about the importance of finding
common ground in our communities in order to set the tone in Congress.
Hugo is a great town that exemplifies this principle.
Town Halls
A few weeks ago, I traveled around Oklahoma's 2nd District, stopping in
every county in the district for town hall events. We had great turnout
and enthusiasm at each event, and I'm proud to say that Oklahomans are
remaining tentative to happenings in Washington.
One of the subjects
discussed at these events was the importance of community involvement
in issues facing our country along with holding our elected officials
accountable.
These town halls help ensure that I'm being transparent
to the people I represent, and I'm always glad to see constituents
actively engaging as a community.
I want to challenge my fellow
Oklahomans to continue to lead by example and work to find unity and
fellowship in our communities.
If we want Washington to change, we
have to set the tone back home.
Speaking with constituents one-on-one before beginning the Okemah town
hall.
Human Trafficking Legislation
Last Tuesday, the House passed legislation designed to address three
aspects of human trafficking: the buyer, the trafficker and the victim.
Additionally, measures were passed to end the link between those
leaving the foster care systems and human trafficking.
The Justice for
Victims of Trafficking Act provides funding for Child Advocacy Centers,
significantly expands the consequences for offenders who consume,
improves victim services, and helps states to prosecute offenders.
By using a victim and youth center approach, we have taken a step
forward in battling human trafficking.
In Oklahoma, law enforcement
officers and state officials have already done a tremendous job in
prosecuting offenders and helping victims of such terrible crimes. I'm
proud to join them in efforts to expand consequences for offenders and
help abused youth, who must be recognized as victims instead of
criminals.
These crimes are simply intolerable and have no place in our society.
It's very upsetting that youth all over this country fall victim to
such terrible acts, but I hope that our bipartisan efforts in the House
serve as a call to action.
Water Resources Reform and Development Act
Last week, Congress passed the Water Resources Reform and Development
Act, which authorizes the construction of major navigation and flood
risk management projects in a budget neutral manner with no new direct
spending. The bill provides the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps of
Engineers) the flexibility to work with non-federal sponsors such as
states and local communities on planning assistance, feasibility
studies, and project construction. Included are provisions that require
the Corps to meet deadlines and more expediently resolve all
environmental reviews, including the Endangered Species Act.
For Oklahoma, the Tulsa Port of Catoosa offers year around barge
service through the MKARNS its water access ways to the Arkansas River,
subsequently allowing Oklahomans to ship their products all over the
world.
However, the Corps of Engineers have designated the waterways
system leading to Catoosa as having a fifty percent failure rate within
the next five years.
If this waterways system was to fail, it would
have an estimated economic impact of $2 million per day just in
Oklahoma!
With waterways across the U.S. in similar condition, it is
absolutely critical that we take steps now to ensure the sustainability
of these systems. Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member Rahal have done
an incredible job in helping shape this bipartisan legislation, and I
thank them and the rest of my colleagues on the Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee for their hard work.

This Week
The House will focus on legislation to improve resources for veterans
and accountability at VA hospitals.
Many Oklahoman veterans that I've
spoken to are facing a variety of hardships, and I know veterans across
this country are in similar circumstances.
It's simply unacceptable
that those who have fought to defend our freedoms are burdened with
such difficulties.
This is why I look forward to moving legislation
forward this week that will help our prior service members.

Dear
Friend,
Thank
you
very
much
for
signing
up
for
our
eNewsletter.
I
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
serve
as
your
Representative.
I
wanted
to
give
you
this
update
on
our
activities
in
the
Second
District
and
Washington,
D.C
At
the
Hugo
town

event speaking
about
the

of
finding

I

Oklahoma's

Human
Trafficking
Legislation
Last Tuesday,
the
House
passed
legislation
designed
to
address
three
aspects
of
human
trafficking:
the
buyer,
the
trafficker
and
the
victim.
Additionally,
measures
were
passed
to
end
the
link
between
those
leaving
the
foster
care
systems
and
human
trafficking.
The
Justice
for
Victims
of
Trafficking
Act
provides
funding
for
Child
Advocacy
Centers,
significantly
expands
the
consequences
for
offenders
who
consume,
improves
victim
services,
and
helps
states
to
prosecute
offenders.
By
using
a
victim
and
youth
center
approach,
we
have
taken
a
step
forward
in
battling
human
trafficking.
In
Oklahoma,
law
enforcement
officers
and
state
officials
have
already
done
a
tremendous
job
in
prosecuting
offenders
and
helping
victims
of
such
terrible
crimes.
I&#8217;m
proud
to
join
them
in
efforts
to
expand
consequences
for
offenders
and
help
abused
youth,
who
must
be
recognized
as
victims
instead
of
criminals.
These
crimes
are
simply
intolerable
and
have
no
place
in
our
society.
It&#8217;s
very
upsetting
that
youth
all
over
this
country
fall
victim
to
such
terrible
acts,
but
I
hope
that
our
bipartisan
efforts
in
the
House
serve
as
a
call
to
action.
Water
Resources

Congress
passed
the
Water
Resources

which
authorizes
the
construction
of
major

have
designated
the

it

Shuster

done
an
incredible

this
bipartisan
legislation,

I
thank
them
and

rest
of

on

for
their
hard
work.
