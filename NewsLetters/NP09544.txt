Dear Friend,
This afternoon, the House approved
my legislation to award the men and women known as the
Monuments Men with the Congressional Gold Medal. This recognition is
Congress' highest honor for distinguished achievements and
contributions.
During, and after, World War II this special military unit was tasked
with helping to locate works of art confiscated by the Nazis and return
them to their rightful owners. They were able to locate, preserve, and
return almost five million cultural items, including many of the world's
greatest works of art.
Today, there are only six surviving members of the Monuments Men. And,
as Memorial Day approaches, I believe the veterans who participated in
these daring missions are certainty worthy and deserving of the
recognition of Congress' highest expression of appreciation.
Honoring the work of the Monuments Men has been a long-term effort of
mine going back to 2006 when I first learned the remarkable untold
story of this group of World War II soldiers. I am proud that their
contributions will now be forever remembered and recognized by the
United States.
Sincerely,
Kay Granger
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
This
afternoon,
the
House
approved
my
legislation
to
award
the
men
and
women
known
as
the
Monuments
Men
with
the
Congressional
Gold
Medal.
This
recognition
is
Congress&#8217;
highest
honor
for
distinguished
achievements
and
contributions.
During,
and
after,
World
War
II
this
special
military
unit
was
tasked
with
helping
to
locate
works
of
art
confiscated
by
the
Nazis
and
return
them
to
their
rightful
owners.
They
were
able
to
locate,
preserve,
and
return
almost
five
million
cultural
items,
including
many
of
the
world&#8217;s
greatest
works
of
art.
Today,
there
are
only
six
surviving
members
of
the
Monuments
Men.
And,
as
Memorial
Day
approaches,
I
believe
the
veterans
who
participated
in
these
daring
missions
are
certainty
worthy
and
deserving
of
the
recognition
of
Congress&#8217;
highest
expression
of
appreciation.
Honoring
the
work
of
the
Monuments
Men
has
been
a
long-term
effort
of
mine
going
back
to
2006
when
I
first
learned
the
remarkable
untold
story
of
this

World

soldiers.
I
am
proud
that
their
contributions
will
now
be
forever
remembered
and
recognized
by
the
United
States.
