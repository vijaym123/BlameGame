CLIP OF THE WEEK -- From
The
Hill (Washington, DC) --
Op-Ed: New Years
resolution: Fix our economy
Rep. Tony Crdenas
We all start each new year with resolutions
that usually last a few weeks, and sometimes a few months, depending
on our commitment. Some of us choose to lose weight. Others pledge to
get more organized, spend more time with family or rid ourselves of bad
habits.
Republicans are
once again showing that they cannot support common-sense solutions that
would grow good-paying, middle class jobs, when it comes to
immigration. Their New Years resolution appears to be doubling down on the
failed immigration policies of the past six
years.

Wall Street Journal (New
York) --
Comcasts Lobbying Machine Faces Test in
Washington
Members
of Congress dont have the power to approve or reject mergers, but they
can exert pressure on regulators. Last summer, some 50 House
lawmakers sent a letter to Comcast and Time Warner Cable raising concerns
about the merger and asking them to commit to carrying independent Latino
program providers.
In a
return letter, Mr. Cohen warned the lawmakers not to be swayed by
parochial business interestswhat he said was a desire by some content
providers to get space in Comcasts cable lineup. Rep. Tony Crdenas, a
California Democrat, said he found the response from Mr. Cohen
insulting.
From
L.A. Times (Los Angeles) --
A
voting-rights pioneer, Cuban dissidents among State of Union
guests
Rep. Tony Cardenas (D-Pacoima)
said he was honored that Olga Cordero, an immigrant mother who has
owned a jewelry repair business in his Valley district for 18 years,
accepted his invitation. She flew cross-country for the trip, and toured
the Capitol on Tuesday morning.
"When we close our eyes, Olga is what we see when we hear the
words 'American Dream,'" said Cardenas, who supports Obama's actions to
provide temporary deportation relief for several million immigrants
living here illegally.
From
NBC News (National) --
IRS Almost Never Audits
Dark Money Nonprofits, Documents show
Rep. Tony Crdenas, D-Calif., said Congress has so
far blown its opportunity to improve the IRS "by ensuring the law is
written properly to let [agency employees] do their jobs efficiently
and effectively."
"The
not-for-profit laws are very clear, that nonprofits must operate
exclusively outside the political realm," he wrote in a statement.
From
Huffinton
Post (Internet) --
Dreamers At State Of The
Union Hope Obama Continues To Push Forward On
Immigration
Crdenas' guest, Olga Cordero, is
a 45-year-old who has been in the U.S. since she was 17, after
immigrating from Mexico with her now-husband. The couple has four children,
all of whom were born in the U.S., meaning Cordero could be eligible
for Obama's latest deportation relief policy. Cordero and her husband
run their own jewelry store in the San Fernando Valley, and she hopes
that Obama's executive actions will make it easier for them to live
freely.
"It's really, really
hard for me and for my family to be in the shadows every day. So it's
really important for me and for the millions of people who live with
the same problem," Cordero said, referring to Obama's new
policies.

Martin Luther King Jr. celebrated in Pacoima
through prayer, song, dance
But for local politicians and others, it was Kings passion that

motivates him.
