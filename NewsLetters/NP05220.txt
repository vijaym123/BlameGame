I&rsquo;m not going to sugarcoat this:
Democrats are in a tough spot.
The election is in just 15 days -- and right now, we&rsquo;re facing an avalanche of spending by outside groups. You name them, and they&rsquo;re out there trying to tear down our Democratic campaigns.
That&rsquo;s why President Obama asked for your help. And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking for your help today.
Can you chip in right now to defend our Democrats facing Republican attacks? All Donations to this Email

There&rsquo;s so much we need to accomplish for the middle-class: a fair minimum wage, affordable education, and building a 21st century economy that works for everyone. But first we need to elect some more Democrats that will put the middle-class first.
