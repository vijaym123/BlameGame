June 08, 2014
Friends,
We
officially entered the month of June this week and I know many of you
are already getting excited and geared up for trips to the beach, the
mountains or to visit relatives.
Unfortunately, many of us are
also experiencing sticker shock as we budget out our travel expenses
and factor in the high cost of gas.
I know very well that
many cannot afford a vacation this year because youre either struggling
to make ends meet or cannot find a job. High gas prices only make
things worse.
I hear from folks in our district all the time who are
struggling and it breaks my heart. I know we have some of the best, most
hardworking people in the world.
We have so much potential for
growth, but we need the right policies in place to create an environment
where small businesses can thrive and our people can find the
opportunities they
deserve.
This past week, however, the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) took us in the wrong direction towards
achieving that goal by issuing a new regulation requiring power plants to
cut carbon emissions by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030. In addition to
the frustration that we all have with EPAs continued overreach of its
authority, this latest move concerns me deeply for the millions of
Americans who are still suffering in this anemic
economy.
The U.S. Chamber
of Commerces Institute for 21 st
Century Energy has said
the EPAs new rule will cost Americas economy over $50 billion a year
between now and 2030.
This could lead to over 200,000 fewer
U.S. jobs on average every year through
2030.
Furthermore, the
EPAs latest rule means
higher energy costs for everyone.
The Energy Institute estimates U.S. consumers will have to pay a
collective $289 billion more for electricity through 2030. This means
that U.S. households will see their disposable incomes drop by nearly
$590 billion through
2030.
With so many hardworking individuals still
struggling or out of work,
its very clear the American people
cannot afford more job-killing policies like this.
Instead, we
need to get the government out of the way of domestic energy
exploration and
production.
A balanced approach that develops more of
Americas own energy resources in an environmentally-responsible way
will reduce our dependence on Middle Eastern oil and create thousands of
jobs here at home.
North Carolina is home to potentially vast
resources off our coastline. The challenge does not lie in our
industry finding these resources, but in man-made government regulatory
hurdles that prohibit us from allocating the time and investment to
capitalizing on
them.
I believe adopting a market-led approach will allow us
to develop more American energy in an environmentally-responsible way
and unlock the potential for a more prosperous America. I will
continue to work with my colleagues
to advance commonsense
legislation that creates jobs, reduces our dependence on foreign energy, and
lowers costs for
everyone.
Until next week,
Richard
