Wanted to provide you with a quick update on Pastor Saeed Abedini -- the American citizen who was arrested in Iran, while on a trip to build an orphanage, for practicing Christianity in his native country and is still being held in an Iranian prison. President Obama recently met with Pastor Abedinis family, and in response, the Pastor penned
this letter
to the President from prison.
Im continuing to strongly urge the President to intervene for Pastor Abedinis release, so that he may safely return home to his wife and two young children. It is essential that the American people know their country will defend their fundamental human rights not just at home, but around the world.
Yours in service,
Randy
