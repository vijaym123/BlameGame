Dear Friend,
Last week, I had the opportunity to attend the 70th anniversary remembrances of D-Day in Normandy.
In this week's newsletter, I'd like to share with you my recent reflections on the experience.
So much has been written about D-Day over the last 70 years
and rightfully so.
Many historians contend it was the decisive moment of World War II, the costliest war the world has ever known.
The biggest battles took place in the East between the Soviets and the Nazis.
But if Hitler had been able to repel the invasion of France, he believed that he could make another deal with Stalin and turn all of his forces back against Great Britain and the United States.
Being part of the delegation attending the 70th anniversary remembrances at Normandy, one is struck by several things.
One is how young the soldiers were.
The fate of nations and civilizations fell on the backs of men whose average age was 26.
Another is the tremendous cost.
Estimates are that 4,413 American and Allied personnel died on that one day.
A similar number of Nazis and some French civilians also perished.
Looking down the rows of white crosses at the cemetery above Omaha beach (pictured), one cannot help but think of the young lives prematurely cut short.
Of course, the individual cost was not limited to those who died that day.
Visiting with veterans who participated in the landings, one senses pain, as well as pride in returning to the scene of their heroics.
D-Day should always remind us how short-sighted it can be to fail to confront evil in a timely way, for the cost of overcoming it later is much higher.
Finally, one is struck by how important it is to remember.
Some day we will have no more D-Day or World War II veterans among us.
The significance of June 6, 1944 may fade in our collective memory.
Yet remembering and honoring their courage, their sacrifice, and their achievement is important, not just for them but also for us.
For we will need those qualities again and again in different circumstances.
Dr. Craig Barnes has said that as he read the stories of World War II in Tom Brokows book,
The Greatest Generation , he was struck by the fact that none of the men was born a hero.
But they were able to reach down and find something heroic inside themselves when circumstances demanded.
That is certainly what happened that day 70 years ago on those French beaches.
For America, may it always be so.
