This week, U.S. Senator Marco
Rubio commented on the Office of Personnel
Management cyberattack, and urged Secretary
of State John Kerry to explain the purpose
of a meeting last weekend between a senior
Obama Administration official and the
suspected narco-trafficker and head of
Venezuela's National Assembly Diosdado
Cabello. Marco also introduced key
legislation on various issues, met with
Singapores Minister for Foreign
Affairs, and wrote an op-ed explaining how
last weeks signing of the Girls
Count Act would help ensure children around

Happy Fathers
Day As Fathers Day
approaches, Marco wishes a happy
Fathers Day to all dads across
America and to those serving our nation
overseas.
Rubio: I always say my most
important job isnt U.S. Senator,
its father. This Fathers Day,
I ask all fathers to join me in
recommitting to the greatest responsibility
we have to our children
to make the
choices and sacrifices today that will keep
America exceptional and ensure we leave our
children with a nation that is better off
than the one we inherited. Happy
Fathers Day to all the dads across
America and especially to those spending it
away from their families as they serve our
nation overseas.
Rubio Comments On OPM
Cyberattack As the slow
trickle of bad news regarding the Office of
Personnel Management cyberattack continues,
Marco called for all details that can be
shared with the public to be released
immediately and suggested actions to
prevent similar attacks in the future.
Read an excerpt of Marcos statement
about the cyberattack below and the full
statement
here .
Rubio: Going forward, the U.S.
needs an unparalleled offensive cyber
capability that can be used as a deterrent
against enemy state actors and
cybercriminals. Additionally, this massive
OPM breach further demonstrates that there
is much work to be done to create the
strongest possible cyber defenses to
protect our government networks, which are
under constant attack from bad actors
around the globe.
Rubio: No Exchange Of Ambassadors With
Venezuela Without Progress On Human
Rights, Political Prisoners,
Elections
Following
last
weekend's meeting
between a senior
Obama Administration official and Diosdado
Cabello, the head of Venezuela's National
Assembly who is reportedly under U.S.
investigation for drug trafficking, Marco
urged Secretary of State John Kerry to
explain the purpose of the meeting and
clarify to Venezuela that the U.S. would
not renew an exchange of ambassadors until
human rights are respected, political
prisoners freed, and elections scheduled.
Read an excerpt of the letter below and the
full letter
here .
Rubio: I am shocked at the recent
media reports describing a meeting between
State Department Counselor Thomas Shannon
and Mr. Cabello. I cannot begin to
understand what you hope to accomplish in
meeting with a suspected narco-trafficker
under U.S. investigation, a man suspected
in gross human rights violations that
includes the death of Venezuelan students,
and a man who many consider to be the most
corrupt person in Venezuela.
Rubio: Signing Of Girls Count Act A
Step Toward Ensuring Children Around The
World Are Registered At Birth
Following
last weeks signing of the Girls
Count Act , Marco wrote an op-ed to
explain the importance of birth
registration and why the U.S. is in a
position to end the epidemic of nonexistent
children.
Read an excerpt below and the full op-ed
here .
Rubio: The United States,
however, has the expertise and
technological might to help confront this
issue and make a difference in the lives of
millions. By demonstrating our moral
leadership and offering our assistance, we
can empower the governments and entities
that are committed to building a better
future.
That is why U.S. Sen. Jeanne
Shaheen of New Hampshire and I co-sponsored
the Girls Count Act, which removes a
significant impediment to progress that
millions of children face from the moment
they are born. The President signed the act
into law on June 12, and now U.S. foreign
assistance programs will be required to
address deficiencies in birth registration
systems in developing countries.
Working in Washington
Marco introduced three key pieces of
legislation this week. The bipartisan
Hizballah
International Financing Prevention Act of
2015 , introduced with Senator
Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), would block the
terrorist organizations financing
and limit the groups access to
logistical support. Read Marcos
statement and learn more about the bill
here .
Marco also joined with fellow Committee on
Commerce, Science, and Transportation
leaders, Senators John Thune (R-SD), Bill
Nelson (D-FL) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) to
introduce the
Coast
Guard Authorization Act of 2015 ,
which would enhance the Coast Guards
ability to enforce vital maritime
operations to counter illicit trafficking
of weapons, narcotics and people. Read
Marcos statement and learn more
about the bill

The third bill Marco introduced this week,
the
Wireless
Innovation Act of 2015
with
Senators Roger Wicker (R-MS), Kelly Ayotte
(R-NH), Cory Gardner (R-CO) and Ron Johnson
(R-WI), would reallocate spectrum used by
the federal government for commercial
wireless services, ensure greater
transparency and accountability of the
federal governments spectrum use,
and promote wireless innovation and
deployment. Read Marcos statement
and learn more about the bill
here .
On Thursday, Marco met with
Singapores Minister for Foreign
Affairs K Shanmugam in Washington to
discuss the U.S.-Singapore relationship and
the strategic and economic importance of
continued American engagement in Asia.
