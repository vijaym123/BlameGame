Dear Neighbor,
This past week marked my first 100 days in Congress. During this time I've had the incredible opportunity to meet with constituents from every corner of the 35th District and hear their concerns, ideas, and aspirations.
In case we haven't had the chance to speak in person, I hope you'll take a few seconds to share with me what issues is most important to you:

Since taking office, I've worked with my Democratic and Republican colleagues on a variety of issues, completed a district-wide
job creation listening tour , built a robust constituent services operation, hosted my inaugural
Congressional Art Competition , and just this past week, introduced my first stand-alone piece of legislation, the
DHS Communication Enhancement Act . Here is a closer look at what my staff and I have been up to during the last 100 days:

We've gotten a lot done in the past 100 days, and I'm looking forward to working even harder in the next 100 days and beyond.
I hope you'll stay in touch and let me know how I can best represent you.
I also encourage you to contact my Ontario office if you need help with a federal agency, and if you're planning a trip to Washington, DC, give my DC office a call for tours of the Capitol Building, the White House, and other DC landmarks.
