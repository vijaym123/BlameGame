&ldquo;[Outside groups] have become a shadow party that&rsquo;s effectively impossible to dislodge, and they will shape, if not control, the dialogue in key races&rdquo; --
New York Times , 7/27/14
Dear Friend, I wish I had a crystal ball
-- not so I could see how the Patriots are going to do this season (okay, that too), but so I could see how much money the special interests will end up spending between now and November.
But I don&rsquo;t have a crystal ball. All I have is the knowledge that this year&rsquo;s outside spending is unprecedented for a midterm election. All I have is the knowledge that there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;shadow party&rdquo; out there, and that they could change this race by writing a single check. We don&rsquo;t have a crystal ball. But we do have a grassroots network the special interests can&rsquo;t buy -- and we count on you for our fundraising support. Help out with a $5 contribution.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
If I had a crystal ball, I could tell all of you, &ldquo;Hey, this is how much outside groups will spend against Ed.&rdquo; Then we could plan exactly how much we need to raise and get on with the campaign. But we simply don&rsquo;t know how much outside money could find its way to Massachusetts
-- and we have to be prepared for anything. Help Ed hit his $55,000 goal for August -- give $5, $10, or whatever make sense for you.
If I get my hands on a crystal ball, I&rsquo;ll let you know. But until I do, we can&rsquo;t take anything for granted.
Thanks for your help.
