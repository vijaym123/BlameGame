Dear
Friends,
Welcome to the latest edition of
my e-newsletter.
Spring brought many Idahoans to Washington, D.C., this
month.
I was fortunate to visit with over 100 Idahoans during the April
work period. I appreciate Idahoans continued willingness to make their
voices heard and actively be engaged in the issues pending before
Congress.
Below are some highlights from the month:
Idahoans representing the National Alzheimers
Association stopped by my Washington, D.C., office this month to
advocate for important, life-saving Alzheimers research. More than
five million Americans, including 10 percent of Idahos seniors, are
living with Alzheimers disease.
Understanding the serious future
implications of this disease, I recently joined Massachusetts Senator
Ed Markey to introduce the Alzheimers Accountability Act.
This
bipartisan legislation requests the National Institutes of Health
devise a blueprint outlining a coordinated research path forward to
expedite scientific breakthroughs and discovery of an eventual cure for
Alzheimers, which is expected to triple in prevalence nationwide and cost
Medicare more than $800 billion annually to care for patients by
2050.
Initiatives like this are not only important to our nations
physical health, but our fiscal health as well.

Doug Jones from my hometown of Idaho Falls stopped by the office
this month.
As the president of Pro-Rental and Sales Inc., Doug
shared how the current economic climate and policies are impacting
his business and employees.
It is always a pleasure to hear from
Idahos small business ownersthe true drivers of our nations
economy.
I enjoyed visiting with Idaho 4-H participants and
representatives from the University of Idahos County Extension
program.
We stopped for a quick photo in the U.S.
Capitol.
Jeanette McKinney of Idaho Falls, the 2014
Elizabeth Dole Foundation caregiver fellow for Idaho, shared with me some of
her personal experiences as the primary caregiver for her
husband who suffered a traumatic brain injurty in the line of duty.
Jeanettes resiliency and positive spirit serves as an example to
all those who come in contact with her. Thank you for all your efforts
on behalf of Idahos military families, Jeanette!
I
welcomed members of the Idaho State Snowmobile Association to the
office for a discussion on the many issues affecting their
industry.
I welcomed 10-year old Brad Springer and his father
Zach from Boise to my Washington, D.C., office.
Brad is a
remarkable young man who, like me, is a cancer survivor.
I appreciated
the Springers willingness to share their story with me as they
represented Seventh Generations Campaign for a Toxin-Free
Generation.
Idahos Native American tribes contribute to Idahos
rich culture and are intrinsic to our states history and
development.
Recognizing the important role Idahos tribes play in our
communities, I am always pleased to visit with tribal members.
Dennis Smith, Chairman of the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of the Duck
Valley Reservation, and other council members provided an update on issues
of importance to the Tribe and the Duck Valley Project during a
meeting in my Washington, D.C., office.
Senator Risch joined me in welcoming U.S. Department of Energy Secretary
Ernest Moniz to the monthly Idaho Industries Breakfast.
We were
eager to share with Secretary Moniz the excellent work being done at the
Idaho National Laboratorythe nations distinguished nuclear energy
laboratory.
Congratulations to
high school student Savina Barini of Twin Falls on being named the
Poetry Out Loud Idaho State Champion.
Savinas commitment to
scholastic achievement was very evident when meeting her.
Keep
up the great work Savina! Youre making Idaho proud!
I had a productive discussion with
representatives from the United Fresh Produce Association, including
members of the Idaho Potato Commission, about the farm bill implementation,
immigration reform and food safety regulations.
EPAs New Effort To Wield Authority Over Water
Unacceptable
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers recently issued a proposed rule that would drastically
expand the definition of waters regulated under the federal Clean Water
Act (CWA).
The Waters of the United States rule would outline
significant expansion of federal authority, permitting the government
to exert more control over private landowners by deeming portions of
their land as jurisdictional.
This month, I joined my
Republican colleagues on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, of
which I am a member, to write the Administration to object to this new
blatant power grab by the agency.
What is most problematic is
that the rule is not aimed at industry or business, large and small,
but individual citizens as well.
Decisions with regard to
allocation, management and the use of water are uniquely state issues that the
federal government should not continue to interfere with.
The
EPAs efforts to, yet again, wield authority over water outside of the
scope of the CWA is an obvious overreach and must be stopped. To read
the letter and learn more, click here.
Idahoans are rightfully concerned about the EPAs
excessive, heavy-handed regulations and the implications in our
state.
I share these concerns and am very much aware that this alarming
trend is not limited to our nations environment and water
issues.
Whether it is the Internal Revenue Service targeting organizations
based on political beliefs or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
collecting and storing data on consumers financial transactions, I
have opposed and continue to fight these unnecessary overreaches and
intrusions into the lives of ordinary citizens.
Reining in the
federal government and preserving the way of life we enjoy in Idaho and
across the West remains one of my highest priorities in
Congress.
