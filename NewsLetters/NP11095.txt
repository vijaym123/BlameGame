Dear Friend,
As you may know, I've been fighting to make the federal tax code fairer
to New York families who face some of the highest costs of living in
the country. To do this, I asked Third Way, a centrist think focused on
middle-class issues especially relevant to families in our area, to
actually crunch the data on how much New Yorkers pay in federal taxes.
The study found that, while the federal tax code offers multiple tax
credits for middle-class families, it doesn't account for differences
in wages and cost of living across different regions.
This means that many New York families that are solidly middle class,
but may make more on paper than similar families elsewhere, do not
qualify for many income-based tax credits. For example, a worker in
low-cost, low-wage McAllen, Texas, can qualify for tax credits to help
with his rent and childcare costs, while a hard-working New Yorker, who
may earn more, but also pays more for housing, food and child care,
cannot receive the same benefits.
This glaring inequality is just plain wrong.
Two bills I've introduced would ease the burden on our taxpayers. The
Tax Equity Act would adjust tax brackets for all areas with a higher
cost of living than the national average, and the Student Loan
Employment Benefits Act would allow those working to set aside up to
$5,000 of their salary, tax-free, to repay their student loans. I am
also drafting legislation that would index future tax credits to
regional costs of living.

Thank you,

2014 Dear
Friend,
As
you
may
know,
I&#8217;ve
been
fighting
to
make
the
federal
tax
code
fairer
to
New
York
families
who
face
some
of
the
highest
costs
of
living
in
the
country.
To
do
this,
I
asked
Third
Way,
a
centrist
think
focused
on
middle-class
issues
especially
relevant
to
families
in
our
area,
to
actually
crunch
the
data
on
how
much
New
Yorkers
pay
in
federal
taxes.
The
study
found
that,
while
the
federal
tax
code
offers
multiple
tax
credits
for
middle-class
families,
it
doesn&#8217;t
account
for
differences
in
wages
and
cost
of
living
across
different
regions.
This
means
that
many
New
York
families
that
are
solidly
middle
class,
but
may
make
more
on
paper
than
similar
families
elsewhere,
do
not
qualify
for
many
income-based
tax
credits.
For
example,
a
worker
in
low-cost,
low-wage
McAllen,
Texas,
can
qualify
for
tax
credits
to
help
with
his
rent
and
childcare
costs,
while
a
hard-working
New
Yorker,
who
may
earn
more,
but
also
pays
more
for
housing,
food
and
child
care,
cannot
receive
the
same
benefits.
This
glaring
inequality
is
just
plain
wrong.
Two
bills
I&#8217;ve
introduced
would
ease
the
burden
on
our
taxpayers.
The
Tax
Equity
Act
would
adjust
tax
brackets
for
all
areas
with
a
higher
cost
of
living
than
the
national
average,
and
the
Student
Loan
Employment
Benefits
Act
would
allow
those
working
to
set
aside
up
to
$5,000
of
their
salary,
tax-free,
to
repay
their
student
loans.
I
am
also
drafting
legislation
that
would
index
future
tax
credits
to
regional
costs
of
living.
