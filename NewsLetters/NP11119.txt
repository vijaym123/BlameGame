Dear Friends,
I just
arrived back to Washington after a great week spent traveling around
Utah's 2nd Congressional District. It's always so enjoyable to spend
time with constituents. Let me highlight a few of things I did while
traveling around the district:
Presenting the Purple Heart:
A
definite highlight of the week was presenting the Purple Heart award
to U.S. Army Specialist, James McCloy of West Jordan, UT. As a
former military officer, it was an absolute honor to present him the
award for injuries he sustained during his deployment to Afghanistan in
2011.
He is such a brave and heroic soldier
an example
of the courageous men and women that are protecting the United
States around the world. You can watch a KSL TV segment about
the event
here , and read a Deseret News article
about the event
here .
Sevier County Mobile Office and Townhall
Meeting:
While I have offices in Salt Lake City and
St. George, I also want to be available to constituents that live in
all corners of the district. To facilitate this, I set up
a temporary office last week in Richfield, UT. It's important
for me to hear the questions and concerns of constituents, as
it helps shape my policy priorities in Washington. If you
are interested in meeting with me at one of my mobile office
locations,
request a meeting on my website .
While I was in Sevier County, I also held a town hall event
on Friday evening. I appreciate all who attended.
If you didn't get a chance to ask a question, please send me an
email through my website .
Endangered Species Improvement Act:
Last week, I also introduced the
Endangered Species Improvement Act of 2014 . As you know,
the Endangered Species Act was created to protect species from extinctionan
absolutely noble and needed cause. Unfortunately, not all laws are
perfect, and in this case, the interpretation of the law is resulting in
inaccurate data collection, potentially preventing healthy and growing
species from being removed from the threatened or endangered list. My
bill would amend the Endangered Species Act of 1973, to require the
federal government to count all species dwelling on both public and
private lands, in determining species recovery.
For example, in southern Utah, the Utah
prairie dog has been a listed species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA)
since 1973. In the species recovery plan for the Utah prairie dog,
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service counts only prairie dogs living on
federal land to determine whether or not the species is recovering and
could be delisted.
They do not count the thousands of prairie
dogs found on state, local and private lands in order to determine
recovery.
This is a
common-sense reform that simply asks for accurate population counts
when assessing the status of threatened or endangered species. I have
had conversations with the Interior Secretary, Sally Jewel, about this
problem and I am hopeful that we will be able to work together to find
a solution. Read more about this bill
