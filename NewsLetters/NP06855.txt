The
Scalise Capitol Report
August 25,
2014
Experiencing the
potential of American Energy
I believe in and
continue to promote an all-of-the-above energy strategy. In addition to
bringing Members of Congress to southeast Louisiana to see how oil and
gas is produced in the Gulf, I also travel to other parts of the country
to see different success stories in America's energy revolution. Last
week I had the opportunity to tour coal and natural gas facilities in
eastern Ohio with my colleague, Congressman Bill Johnson. We visited
a Rice Energy drilling site in southeast Ohio's Utica shale formation
and learned how this emerging leader in American energy is safely and
effectively developing tight gas shale formations. We also learned the
important impact Utica shale has on economic growth, energy security,
and job creation at the M3 Midstream tour. Finally, we toured a coal
mine, and I got to meet with local coal miners and listen to their
concerns about the Obama Administration's war on coal. Their radical
regulations are increasing food, gas, and electricity costs for American
families and are hurting hard-working taxpayers. I heard their message
and share that of so many other middle class families across the
country loud and clear, which is why I continue to fight these radical
regulations coming out of Washington that are threatening jobs as well as
jeopardizing America's energy security.
Continued American energy production has a tremendously positive affect on
economic growth and job creation. I will continue to fight to ensure the
right energy policies are in place to tap into that
potential.
Outlining RESTORE Act priorities with coastal
leaders
I recently met with local business and community leaders in New
Orleans to discuss the most effective ways we can revive and protect
Louisiana's wetlands and coastline using RESTORE Act funds. With many
Louisiana families still struggling in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon
disaster, it is imperative that this money be used for critical
coastal restoration projects and not be raided for unrelated purposes. Just
as we've made it clear to our colleagues in Congress that the BP
fines should not be used for unrelated spending in Washington, we will
work equally as hard to ensure that RESTORE Act funds will be focused on
coastal restoration and will not be siphoned off to pork barrel
projects in Louisiana. The signing of the RESTORE Act into law is without a
doubt the single most significant action taken to restore our coast in
Louisianas history, and we must not let these funds be squandered. I
am glad the Coalition for Coastal Resilience and Economy is committed
to ensuring that mistakes of Louisiana history don't repeat
themselves, and to ensuring that these vital funds will be used specifically on
coastal restoration projects.
Taliban
terrorist swap: report verifies what we already knew
Last
week, a report by the nonpartisan agency, the U.S. Government
Accountability Office verified
what we already knew : This Administration broke the law when swapping five Taliban
terrorists at Gitmo for U.S. Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl. It is unacceptable
that this Administration yet again ignored the law of the land and acted
on its own accord. I have grave concerns regarding the foreign policy
decision-making of this Administration under President Obama, and I
will continue to hold the Administration accountable for these
decisions.
It is an honor to represent you
in Congress. For more information please visit my
