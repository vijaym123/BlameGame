The Hill Report
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of January 27 - 31, 2014
This week, President Obama delivered the annual State of the Union
address.
Unsurprisingly, this year's speech was another missed
opportunity for President Obama to admit that his policies have failed
to meet the needs of the American people. Instead, he promised a "year
of action" - even if that means circumventing Congress and the
constitutional lawmaking process while making unilateral decisions
through executive orders. While I certainly would like to see a year of
economic action, when the president says that he wants action he means
that he wants more government.
North Texans know that more government
is not the vision that will create more jobs and get our country back
to work.
Rather than promoting policies that divide Americans, the president
should have made a commitment to working with Republicans to get our
economy back on track. At a time when the labor force participation
rate is at its lowest in 35 years, it is imperative that we work on
real solutions for an economic recovery - not just contrived
administrative "fixes" - to help the unemployed. House Republicans have
passed dozens of pro-growth bills that would reduce regulatory burdens,
expand energy production, and reenergize the free enterprise system.
It's time for the president to join with us and recognize that job
creation will come from a thriving economy, not Washington mandates.
The president also failed to address how he plans to give Americans
relief from ObamaCare. The disastrous health care law has led
businesses to stop hiring new employees and lay off current employees,
making it even more difficult for our nation's unemployed to find work.
Despite the president's promises, ObamaCare also forced millions off of
their preferred insurance plans and caused premiums and out of pocket
costs to skyrocket for families and businesses. Clearly, ObamaCare is a
train wreck. It's time to start over in order to actually give
Americans access to quality and affordable health care.
I believe that North Texans deserve better than another speech that is
heavy on rhetoric and light on real solutions to the problems facing
families across our nation. That's why I will continue to hold the
Administration accountable, fight to get Washington out of the way, and
support common-sense proposals to expand opportunities and rebuild the
American Dream.

Farm Bill Update
Following months of negotiations with the Senate, on Wednesday the
House passed the Agricultural Act of 2014, which is also known as the
Farm Bill. This legislation cuts spending by $23 billion, which
includes the most significant reduction to farm policy spending in
history. The Farm Bill saves American taxpayers $8.6 billion through
important reforms to our nation's food stamp program and ends the
direct-payment subsidy program for farmers that previously spent $5
billion annually regardless of actual need.
No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act
On Tuesday, the House approved H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for
Abortion Act.
Since 1976, the Hyde Amendment - which prohibits the
federal funding of abortions - has been renewed each year in Congress
through the appropriations process. After 38 years, it is time for this
life-saving amendment to become permanent law.
While I continue to
fight to repeal ObamaCare, it is vital that federal taxpayer subsidies
are not allowed to be used for abortions under ObamaCare health plans.
A majority of the American people believe that federal taxpayer dollars
should not be used for abortions and I was pleased to join them by
voting to codify our nation's long-held policy.
Fulbright Program
This month, six college students from the 32nd Congressional District
received the prestigious Fulbright award to study, lecture, or teach
abroad during the 2013-2014 academic year. The Fulbright Program,
America's flagship international exchange program, is sponsored by the
U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs.
The program was first established in 1946 and since its inception more
than325,000 people have participated in the program in 155 countries
worldwide.

Pete
Sessions Week

2014
This
week,
President
Obama
delivered
the
annual
State
of
the
Union
address.
Unsurprisingly,
this
year&#8217;s
speech
was
another
missed
opportunity
for
President
Obama
to
admit
that
his
policies
have
failed
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
American
people.
Instead,
he
promised
a
&#8220;year
of
action&#8221;
&#8211;
even
if
that
means
circumventing
Congress
and
the
constitutional
lawmaking
process
while
making
unilateral
decisions
through
executive
orders.
While
I
certainly
would
like
to
see
a
year
of
economic
action,
when
the
president
says
that
he
wants
action
he
means
that
he
wants
more
government .
North
Texans
know
that
more
government
is
not
the
vision
that
will
create
more
jobs
and
get
our
country
back
to
work.
Rather
than
promoting
policies
that
divide
Americans,
the
president
should
have
made
a
commitment
to
working
with
Republicans
to
get
our
economy
back
on
track.
At
a
time
when
the
labor
force
participation
rate
is
at
its
lowest
in
35
years,
it
is
imperative
that
we
work
on
real
solutions
for
an
economic
recovery
&#8211;
not
just
contrived
a dministrative
&#8220;fixes&#8221;
&#8211;
to
help
the
unemployed.
House
Republicans
have
passed
dozens
of
pro-growth
bills
that
would
reduce
regulatory
burdens,
expand
energy
production,
and
reenergize
the
free
enterprise
system.
It&#8217;s
time
for
the
president
to
join
with
us
and
recognize
that
job
creation
will
come
from
a
thriving
economy,
not
Washington
mandates.
The
president
also
failed
to
address
how
he
plans
to
give
Americans
relief
from
ObamaCare.
The
disastrous
health
care
law
has
led
businesses
to
stop
hiring
new
employees
and
lay
off
current
employees,
making
it
even
more
difficult
for
our
nation&#8217;s
unemployed
to
find
work.
Despite
the
president&#8217;s
promises,
ObamaCare
also
forced
millions
off
of
their
preferred
insurance
plans
and
caused
premiums
and
out
of
pocket
costs
to
skyrocket
for
families
and
businesses.
Clearly,
ObamaCare
is
a
train
wreck.
It&#8217;s
time
to
start
over
in
order
to
actually
give
Americans
access
to
quality
and
affordable
health
care.
I
believe
that
North
Texans
deserve
better
than
another
speech
that
is
heavy
on
rhetoric
and
light
on
real
solutions
to
the
problems
facing
families
across
our
nation.
That&#8217;s
why
I
will
continue
to
hold
the
Administration
accountable,
fight
to
get
Washington
out
of
the
way,
and
support
common-sense
proposals
to
expand
opportunities
and

the
American
Dream.

Bill
Update Following
months
of
negotiations
with
the
Senate,
on
Wednesday
the
House
passed
the
Agricultural
Act
of
2014 ,
which
is
also
known
as
the
Farm
Bill.
This
legislation
cuts
spending
by
$23
billion,
which
includ es
the
most
significant
reduction
to
farm
policy
spending
in
history.
T he
Farm
Bill
saves
American
taxpayers
$8.6
billion
through
important
reforms
to
our
nation's
f ood
s tamp
program
and
ends
the
direct-payment

program
for

that
previously
spent
$5

annually
regardless
of
actual
need .
No
Taxpayer
Funding
for
Abortion
Act
On
Tuesday,
the
House
approved
H.R.
7,
the
No
Taxpayer
Funding
for
Abortion
Act .
Since
1976,
the
Hyde
Amendment
&#8211;
which
prohibits
the
federal
funding
of
abortions
&#8211;
has
been
renewed
each
year
in
Congress
through
the
appropriations
process.
After
38
years,
it
is
time
for
this
life-saving
amendment
to
become
permanent
law .
While
I
continue
to
fight
to
repeal
ObamaCare,
it
is
vital
that
federal
taxpayer
subsidies
are
not
allowed
to
be
used
for
abortions
under
ObamaCare
health
plans.
A
majority
of
the
American
people
believe
that
federal
taxpayer
dollars
should
not
be
used
for

and
I
was
pleased
to
