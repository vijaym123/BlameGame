Dear
Friends:
Today, marks a year-and-a-half since terrorists
stormed the Special Mission in Benghazi, killing the Ambassador, an aide and
two Navy Seals on September 11, 2012. Today,
I
insisted that both the President and the Director of the FBI take action,
which is long-overdue, to bring to justice those who committed those
murders. I was joined by dozens of my House colleagues in sending this
message to the President and FBI Director who have failed to take
action.
Instead of making certain
these killers are held accountable, the President is off on his third
fundraising foray in a week, including Boston last week, New York
City tonight, and Miami and Key West this weekend. He needs to spend less
time raising political money and golfing while the murderers remain
at large. It is outrageous that terrorists can wantonly slaughter U.S.
officials without repercussions. We have photographs, videos of
suspects and the media have even interviewed some of the alleged
perpetrators, and still the FBI, Department of Justice and President have failed
to bring these criminals to
justice.
I intend to continue to hold this Administration accountable for
avenging the deaths of U.S. personnel in Libya. For additional
