(April 30, 2015 - President Barack Obama signs Senator
Shaheens
Energy Efficiency Improvement Act
into
law)
Dear Friend,
Its always tough to convince Washington
to not play politics with a good idea. Energy efficiency is the
fastest, cheapest way to address our nations energy challenges, but that
didnt stop some in Congress from playing political games with my
bipartisan energy efficiency legislation.
However, persistence
has paid-off as the President just recently signed my Energy Efficiency
Improvement Act into law, marking a big victory over Washington
gridlock.
This bill will save consumers money,
create jobs and reduce pollution .
Much more work on energy
efficiency needs to be done and getting this legislation over the
finish line demonstrates that theres broad support in Washington for
job-creating efficiency legislation. I will continue to reach across the
aisle to pass more common-sense energy efficiency bills because its
good for our economy and its good for our
environment.
Sincerely,
Jeanne Shaheen
