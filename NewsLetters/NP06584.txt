Click here to sign our petition demanding House Republicans take a government shutdown off the table &gt;&gt;
Last year's shutdown affected businesses and families all across our district. At Great Lakes Naval Station alone, more than 2,500 workers were sent home.
Once again, some Tea Partiers in Congress are threatening a new government shutdown. We can&rsquo;t let that happen.
Please sign our petition to say no to another government shutdown:
David -- there&rsquo;s no other way to put it.
Last year's government shutdown hit Illinois hard.
The shutdown affected businesses and families all across our district. The Great Lakes Naval Station alone had to send more than 2,500 workers home.
That shutdown was irresponsible and reckless. And yet once again some Tea Partiers in Congress are threatening a new government shutdown.
Brad won&rsquo;t stand by while politicians put their political ideology ahead of doing the people&rsquo;s work. That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s joining Democrats across the country to demand Republicans stop threatening another government shutdown.

The first shutdown didn't need to happen, and we can't let it happen again.
If you agree, we need to hear from you now.
