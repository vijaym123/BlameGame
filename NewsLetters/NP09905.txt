Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
In DC last week, I met with several constituent groups who came to my office to provide updates on their industries, share concerns, and advocate for legislative issues that are important to them. As Obamacare continues to pose big concerns with healthcare professionals, local members of the Florida Orthopedic Society came to my office to share their perspectives as physicians, including their thoughts on Medicare reimbursements and their ability to continue providing quality patient care.

Members of the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers who oversee infrastructure initiatives in Florida visited my office last week to discuss economic state development projects that will create jobs and spur growth in Central Florida. During the Water Resources and Environmental hearing last week, I also pressed Major General John Peabody, the Deputy Commanding General for Civil and Emergency Operations, for a date when the Civil Works Review Board would reconvene to consider and approve the Central Everglades Planning Project.

Instituted by Congress in 1952, the National Day of Prayer continues the tradition of acknowledging our firm reliance on God. Last Thursday morning, I joined fellow colleagues and national religious leaders as we paused to give thanks for our strong Christian heritage and gathered to ask God for His continued blessing on our nation.

Last Saturday, I attended the 2014 American Cancer Society Relay for Life in Lake County. It was a privilege to join the cities of Eustis and Tavares as they hosted this event to celebrate with those who have survived, encourage those who are still fighting, and commemorate the lives of others who live on in our hearts and memories.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
A constituent from Leesburg recently contacted my office about his concern with the delay he was experiencing in receiving his 2013 refund from the IRS. Because of his large monthly medical expenses, this unexpected delay was putting a strain on the constituents financial condition. My office reached out to the Taxpayer Advocate Service, and after reviewing the situation, they reported shortly afterward that his refund was direct deposited into the constituents account.
Constituent Services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
Last week,
further correspondence
from the White House surfaced regarding the Benghazi attacks that claimed the lives of four Americans on September 11, 2012. On Friday, Speaker Boehner announced that he would create a select subcommittee to investigate these attacks more specifically in an attempt to discover the full truth of what actually occurred.
As a
co-sponsor of a resolution
calling for the creation of a select investigative committee, I have been a vocal supporter of uncovering the truth behind what happened on that tragic day. Bringing justice to those who perpetrated this wanton act of violence against our countrymen should not be a partisan issue.
Do you think the attack that took the life of our US Ambassador and three other Americans in Benghazi was an act of terror?
Yes
No
I don't know

Response from the
previous survey question,
"With the continued volatility of world affairs, recent advancements of new natural gas technologies opening the door for a domestic energy boom, and rising energy costs causing American families and businesses to reach deeper into their wallets and pocketbooks, how important is it for the federal government to help move the United States toward energy independence?" Very important - 92%
Somewhat important - 5%
Not very important - 3%
Legislative Update:
After passing the budget last month, the House of Representatives began the appropriations process to specifically allocate federal funding. Last week, I supported the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2015, which details the mandatory and discretionary funds for military services.
The legislation includes funding for basic military construction, housing, and operations to ensure we support the promises we have made to our troops and their families.
The bi-partisan bill also funds medical health care and streamlines the exchange of medical data between the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense and the private sector in order to ensure quality care for our veterans.
Specifically, this bill seeks to end the backlog that has caused many of our returning Iraq and Afghanistan veterans to experience significant delays in receiving needed healthcare.
