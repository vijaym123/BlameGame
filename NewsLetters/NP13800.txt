Congressional Report
Dear Friends,
I would like to share with you several updates during my work week in Washington, D.C.
Visit to Randolph Field ISD
Congressman Cuellar meets with students at the Randolph ISD and discusses ways in which his office can be of assistance to the district.
On Friday, I visited Randolph Field Independent School District at Randolph Air Force Base. I enjoyed meeting with students, district administrative staff, board members, and base command as I toured the base and school campuses. We discussed the importance of Impact Aid funds and the role it plays in educating the children of our active military personnel.
Congressman Cuellar greets students during a tour of the Randolph ISD in which he discussed funding for school districts and education issues.
Wilson County Health Insurance Marketplace Community Workshop
Congressman Cuellar's office hosts a community workshop for Wilson County residents to provide more information about the health insurance marketplace.
This week, I hosted a Health Insurance Marketplace Community Workshop for residents of Wilson County. The event was free, open to the public, and gave participants the opportunity to enroll for health insurance with the assistance of certified organizations.
In Wilson County, 21% of residents do not have health insurance, some of whom may be eligible for coverage under the new Health Insurance Marketplace. I would like to thank all of the local agencies and organizations that partnered with us to host this event:
-
Cognosante
-
Young Invincibles
-
Enroll America
-
Alamo Area Council of Governments (AACOG)
-
Wilson Community Health Center
-
Texas Organizing Project
Congressman Cuellars Outreach Coordinator Pete Arguello with Mr. Kenneth Wiatrek after he signed up for a health insurance plan with Angelica Garza, a certified application counselor from Atascosa Health Center.
Almost 20 people attended the workshop and all had ample time for one on one questions with the various healthcare representatives.
During the event, the Office of Congressman Cuellar and representatives from the Atascosa Health Centers helped two residents of Floresville, Mr. Kenneth Wiatrek and Ms. Dorie Perez, enroll in health care plans under the exchange.
New District Office for State Representative Longoria
Outreach Coordinator Alexis Gallegos in attendance at the opening of Texas State Representative Oscar Longoria's new District Office in Peitas Texas.
Last week, Texas State Representative Oscar Longoria announced the Grand Opening of his District Office in Hidalgo County, Peitas Texas. Alexis Gallegos, my Hidalgo County Outreach Coordinator, attended the opening and discussed how we can work together to improve services for our community.
We congratulate Representative Longoria and wish him the best with his new office!
Lighting the San Antonio Riverwalk
Outreach Coordinators Pete Arguello and Gilbert Lafuente were on hand to help with the lighting of the San Antonio Riverwalk.
Lighting the Riverwalk in San Antonio is truly the beginning of the holiday season. My outreach coordinators, Pete Arguello and Gilbert Lafuente, volunteered this weekend to bring more light to a beautiful city.
Immigrants Boost the Texas Economy
Immigrants are a major driver of economic growth in Texas. A new report from the Federal Bank Reserve of Dallas illustrates the positive effects immigration has on our state.
-
Foreign born individuals make up 21 percent of the workforce in
Texas.
-
Texas immigrants are more likely to be working in the labor force and
one-third less likely to be unemployed.
-
Nearly 15 percent of recent domestic migrants hold a graduate or
professional degree, compared with 9 percent of the state population.
I invite you to read more about
the report
here
to better understand how our state can address the opportunities and challenges of a large immigrant population.

Intern Spotlight
Congratulations to one of our outstanding interns, Perla Salazar, for receiving the CHLI Fall 2013 Fellow Spotlight! This fall, Perla worked in my Washington, D.C. office through the Congressional Hispanic Leadership Institute (CHLI) Global Leaders Internship program. She did an outstanding job and brought a lot of enthusiasm to the team.
Congratulations to intern Perla Salazar for receiving the CHLI Fall 2013 Fellow Spotlight.
