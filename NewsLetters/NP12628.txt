VISITING DC
February 07, 2014
On Tuesday, I voted against final passage of the
Farm Bill. Not only does it carry a nearly $1 trillion price tag but most
of the funding has nothing to do with farming, let alone providing
any certainty to farmers. It also fails to include relief to farmers on
burdensome GIPSA Restrictions and Country of Origin Labeling (COOL)
rules. While I appreciate the efforts of the bills authors, its failure
to address the crucial needs of North Carolina farmers prevented me
from supporting the bill.
Yesterday, I sent a letter to IRS
Commissioner John Koskinen, along with Senators Grassley, Hatch,
Roberts, and Cornyn, to condemn the IRSs decision to award $62.5 million
of employee bonuses, despite government-wide budget cuts, and asked for
reconsideration of the decision and an explanation of current and
future bonus plans. The bonuses are an insult to taxpayers, especially
given the IRSs deterioration in performance and its targeting of
conservative organizations. What IRS employees need is accountability, not a
pat on the back.

In case you missed it, I made several media appearances this week,
including a special report on Benghazi and two interviews on the
Patient CARE Act. You can click below to watch the videos or visit
my Youtube page .
Finally, I will be giving this week's
Republican address on Saturday, with a focus on veterans. All
over our nation military veterans are going about their lives with the
expectation that their sacrifices will be honored and their service will
be reciprocated by the government and the people they ably served. It
is up to us to make sure our promise to them is
kept.
Sincerely,
Richard Burr
