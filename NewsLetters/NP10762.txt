Dear Friends,
On Wednesday the House Committee on Homeland Security held a hearing
which I chaired titled "The Boston Marathon Bombings, One Year On: A
Look Back to Look Forward."
It was a powerful and emotional day for
the witnesses, for me, and for the committee. We remembered the
anniversary of the Boston Marathon Bombings, and most importantly, the
victims and their families. We also examined the warning signs and red
flags that were missed prior to the attack that were included in a
report our Committee issued two weeks ago
. It is my sincere hope that the lessons learned
from this tragedy will help us stop further terrorist plots like it in
the future. You can watch my opening statement and questioning of the
witnesses, including former Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis, as
well as my appearance on Fox News discussing the hearing, below.

Legislative Update
This week I was proud the House of Representatives passed a fiscally
responsible budget for the fourth consecutive year. While the
President's budget
would raise $1.8 trillion in new taxes and the Senate
refuses to even take up a budget, House Republicans passed a budget
that cuts taxes and reduces spending by more than $5 trillion.
The
House "Path to Prosperity"
budget, which I supported, also balances in ten years,
reforms out-of-control entitlement spending to preserve programs like
Medicare for future generations, repeals ObamaCare, modernizes our tax
code, and bolsters our national security.
The House of Representatives also passed legislation that I supported,
H.R. 4357
, that would deny entry
to the United States to any representative to the United Nations who
has engaged in espionage or terrorist activities against the U.S. This
legislation is specifically aimed at barring the newly appointed
Iranian diplomat to the U.N. Hamid Aboutalebi from entering the U.S.
Hamid Aboutalebi served as a translator for the radical Iranians who
took American hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 sparking
the "Iranian Hostage Crisis" that lasted for 444 days.
