ICYMI: Rubio: Obamas Terror
Strategy Is Failing: U.S. Must Heed
Lessons Of 9/11
In
an
op-ed for FOXNews.com , Marco
highlights the failures of the Obama
Administrations strategy to defeat
terrorism, and urges the U.S. to learn
from the lessons of the 9/11 terrorist
attacks. An excerpt from the op-ed is
below:
Rubio: The United States and
all civilized countries need to
coordinate our efforts to fight the
Islamic State first by cutting them
off. We must counter their
message on social media; bolster allies
like Iraq and Jordan; and ensure that
we prevent suspected terrorists from
traveling back and forth between their
homelands and places like Syria, Libya,
and Yemen. Perhaps most
importantly, we have to help
governments eliminate the safe havens
that the Islamic State relies on to
gather strength.
Syria, Yemen, and Libya are
all examples of our failure to learn
one of the fundamental lessons of the
terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001
-- that failed and failing states breed
instability and are potential safe
havens for terrorists who will
eventually turn their attention toward
us.

Rubio Introduces Bill To Reform VA
Accountability
Marco joined Senators Jerry Moran
(R-KS), Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) and John
McCain (R-AZ) to introduce the S. 290,
Increasing
VA Accountability to Veterans Act of
2015 ,
legislation to give the
Secretary of the Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA) more authority to hold
corrupt executives accountable for their
actions. The legislation would give the
VA Secretary the authority to reduce the
pensions of executives convicted of a
crime, limit the amount of time VA senior
executive service (SES) employees can
spend on paid administrative leave, and
reform the Departments performance
appraisal system for senior
executives.
To fix the VA and make sure
it achieves its mission of providing
high quality and timely health care to
our veterans, we must eliminate the
culture of incompetence, negligence and
underperformance that has been
tolerated and, in some cases, even
covered up for too long,
said Rubio . Last year, I
was encouraged that my proposal
authorizing the VA secretary to fire
bad managers became law. Now we have to
make it clear that if youre a
senior VA executive found guilty of
criminal activity during your tenure,
you should have no guarantee of a bonus
or pension. We owe our veterans the
very best health care and customer
service, and thats going to be
hard to achieve as long as you have VA
officials believing there are no
consequences for poor work or even
criminal behavior.
Rubio Named Chairman Of The Senate
Foreign Relations Committees
Western Hemisphere Subcommittee
Marco was officially named this week
as chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committees Subcommittee
on Western Hemisphere, Transnational
Crime, Civilian Security, Democracy,
Human Rights and Global Womens
Issues. He will also be a member of the
Subcommittee on East Asia, The Pacific,
and International Cybersecurity Policy;
the Subcommittee on Near East, South
Asia, Central Asia, and Counterterrorism;
and the Subcommittee on Africa and Global
Health Policy.
Marco also announced the first hearing
to be held in the Western Hemisphere
subcommittee will be next Tuesday,
February 3 at 10:00 a.m. EST. It will
examine President Obamas changes
to Cuba policy, and its implications for
human rights in the island.
In assuming this chairmanship, Marco
issued the following statement:
Being from Florida,
Ive seen how events in the
Western Hemisphere not only impact our
state but our entire nation. For too
long, Congress and the Administration
have failed to prioritize our relations
in this hemisphere. This lack of
attention has kept us from seizing the
opportunities of a rising middle class,
emboldened tyrants and non-state actors
to erode democratic values, allowed
global competitors to deepen their
influence in the continent, and
diminished our ability to respond to
the proliferation of transnational
organized crime and the violence and
instability associated with it.
As chairman of the
subcommittee, I will promote bold
measures that improve U.S. economic and
security interests by addressing the
regions growing calls for
transparent institutions, access to
quality education, private sector
competitiveness, and respect for
political and economic freedom for
all.
I look forward to advocating
for closer ties with Canada, Mexico,
and other regional partners such as
Colombia as well as greater energy
cooperation and trade. The subcommittee
will be a platform for bringing light
and solutions to rising problems in the
hemisphere, such as growing
inhospitality for individual freedoms,
deteriorating security environments,
lagging competitiveness, ineffective
regional organizations, the need for
political stability and economic
prosperity in Haiti, and the promotion
and support of democracy in places
where individual freedoms are all but a
dream, such as Cuba and Venezuela.
I hope to also continue my
work on the U.S. governments
efforts to promote democracy and
advance human rights around the world,
to support the fair and equitable
treatment of women around the globe,
and increase religious freedom. This is
another set of issues that has far too
often been neglected by this
administration. I plan to continue to
be a voice for the oppressed, whether
they be in our own hemisphere or on the
other side of the globe. I look forward
to working to ensure that U.S. programs
aimed at advancing these freedoms are
effective and achieving results that
are consistent with our values as a
nation.
I also intend to remain
active on the East Asia and Pacific
subcommittee by supporting our strong
alliances in Asia and working to
address the challenges confronting that
vitally important region which will
play a significant role in shaping the
21st century. Its clear that
American leadership has achieved a
great deal in this region in recent
decades, and now its important
that we take none of our gains for
granted and continue working with our
allies to advance our security,
economic and human rights
agenda.
