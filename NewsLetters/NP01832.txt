Vote-a-Rama 2015: Balanced Budget Edition
This week was very busy at the U.S. Capitol for my colleagues and me.
Yesterday, at noon, we began voting on 43 amendments to the Senate
Budget Proposal. We did not finish until 3:30AM!
The U.S. Senate
ultimately passed a budget resolution that creates more opportunities
for hardworking taxpayers in South Carolina and throughout our country.
During this vote-a-rama, the Senate voted on my amendment to provide
consumers a clearer look at the costs associated with their health care
plans under the Affordable Care Act. It passed with a bipartisan 56-44
vote.
My amendment is designed to increase the number of insurance companies
that disclose exactly how much the new health insurance tax is
contributing to their monthly premiums. When American families go
shopping at the grocery store, they see on their receipt how much tax
they are paying. Unfortunately, that is not always the case with their
health insurance.
I am pleased it is included in the Senate Budget proposal.
Northside Initiative
I hopped on an afternoon flight to Greenville and joined former mayor
Bill Barnet on a tour of the Northside Initiative this afternoon. The
neighborhood leaders are working hard to revitalize the community in an
unprecedented way. Their initiative is an example of leadership within
the city of Spartanburg.
Veterans Workshop and Job Fair - Greenville, SC
On Wednesday, my Upstate office held a Veterans Training Workshop and
Job Fair at the Salvation Army Kroc Center in Greenville. Both events
come at the conclusion of a series of workshops through South Carolina
as part as a Veterans Job Training Initiative I started last year. The
workshop and job fair were in partnership with the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce.
Bipartisan Financial Literacy Legislation
I also introduced the Empowering Student Borrowers Act with my friend
Joe Donnelly (D-IN). This legislation aims to improve the financial
literacy of college students and ensure that student borrowers have
access to the best tools and information to make responsible borrowing
decisions.
Financial literacy is incredibly important for families across America,
and especially for those families and students who will be taking out
student loans in order to further their education. By developing best
practices to empower students and their families when making decisions
regarding their finances, we can help reduce loan debt and ensure more
folks have the opportunity to reach their educational goals.
Thank you again for subscribing!
Sincerely,
Tim
