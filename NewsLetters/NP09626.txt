Dear
friends,
I recently introduced a new, common-sense bill to improve Idahos
economy.
Its called the
Future Logging Careers
Act , and it would bolster one of Idahos most important
industries by allowing young people to learn the trade of logging at a
younger age.
Like farming and ranching, timber harvesting is
often a family-run business where the practice of harvesting and
transporting forest products from the forest to the mills is passed down
from generation to generation.
However, young men and women in
families who own and operate timber harvesting companies are denied the
opportunity to work and learn the family trade until they reach
adulthood.
While most industries, including the agriculture
industry, enjoy regulatory exemptions that allow family members between
the ages of 16 and 17 to work under their parents supervision, the
logging industry doesnt have that same right.
The end result is
that we are penalizing young people who want to enter the logging
industry and make it a career.
My bill would amend the
Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 so that 16 and 17 year olds can work in
mechanized logging operations under parental supervision.
By
lowering the age that young adults can operate safe and modern
machinery, we can revitalize one of Idahos key industries and bring
much-needed resources into the marketplace.
Over forty organizations
are supporting my bill.
They include American Loggers Council,
National Alliance of Forest Owners, Forest Resources Association, and
Caterpillar Forest Products.
A full list can be found
here .
This week, Senators Risch and Crapo
introduced the Senate version of my bill.
Its called the
Youth Careers in Logging Act .
With
legislation introduced in both Houses of Congress, our proposal stands
a much better chance of becoming law.
As a member of the House
Natural Resources Committee, I will certainly do all I can to make
that happen.
The time has come to put our people and our
land back to work.
The bill that Ive introduced will help us
do that.
With support growing across the political spectrum, Im
confident that we will succeed.
