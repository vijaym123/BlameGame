Friend,
I want to begin with a shout out to everyone who was able to make it
out to one of the events I held over the past few weeks. It's important
to me that you have the opportunity to speak with me personally and
tell me what's on your mind.
We had a bunch of great events - "Kilmer at Your Company" visits, a
terrific roundtable with the Hilltop Action Coalition, a fun (and
filling) visit to the Asia Pacific Cultural Center's New Year
celebration, and a whole lot more. Thank you to those who made it out
to my town halls in Port Orchard and Tacoma. I enjoyed talking with
folks about everything from education policy to the importance of
getting this economy moving again.
Also, thanks to those of you who were able to make it out to UW Tacoma
for my Federal Contracting Workshop and a big thank you to local
businesses, federal agency representatives, and the Procurement
Technical Assistance Center staff who participated. I'm proud to
support small businesses that are the backbone of our economy and are
critical to our economic recovery.
On to this week's update.
Giving Up Shutdown Pay
I was surprised to wake up this morning and find my picture on the
front page of The Washington Post
, but apparently it's big news these days when a
public servant keeps his word. I was strongly opposed to the government
shutdown and I chose to give up my pay because so many folks in our
community were being harmed during the shutdown. You can read about my
colleagues who kept their word and gave back their pay during the
shutdown here
.
When Women Succeed, America Succeeds
I believe that when women succeed, America succeeds. That's why next
Friday, March 7th, I'm hosting a Women's Economic Advancement Event at
the Tacoma Campus of Evergreen State College.
We'll have resources and speakers on financial security, food and
nutrition, childcare resources, job training programs, higher
education, and housing resources and rights. Also we'll be joined by
special guest Tacoma Mayor Marilyn Strickland.
This event is free and all, including children, are welcome to attend.
I hope to see you there. Here are the details:

In Case You Missed It: The Freshmen
Check out this episode of "The Delegation"
which aired on KCTS 9 last week. It
features a conversation between the freshmen of the Washington State
Congressional Delegation, Reps. Suzan DelBene, Denny Heck, and myself.
I was glad to be able to discuss my experience serving in Congress so
far, especially in an environment of severe gridlock. It's still a
fixer-upper. If you're interested, watch here to learn about why I want
to serve, the effects of the shutdown, and other thoughts looking back
on my first year.
Calling All High School Students
Finally, I'm excited to announce the 2014 Congressional Art Competition
for high school students living in the 6th District of Washington. This
is a unique opportunity for students to showcase their artistic talent
and to encourage creative thinking. I'm proud to invite high school
students across the district to show why supporting the arts in our
schools is so important.
The student whose artwork is selected will be invited to travel to
Washington, D.C. in June to attend a ceremony unveiling their artwork
and will be given two complimentary round-trip flights for the event.
For more info, see my website

Thanks as always for reading and don't hesitate to reach out if I or my
office can be helpful to you. I'm honored to work for you.
Sincerely,
Derek Kilmer

to
everyone
who
was
able
to
make
it
out
to
one
of
the
events
I
held
over
the
past
few
weeks.
It&#8217;s
important
to
me
that
you

Thank

Giving
