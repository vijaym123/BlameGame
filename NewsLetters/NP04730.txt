Friend -- I&rsquo;ve emailed again and again.
But this moment couldn&rsquo;t be any more urgent.
Election Day is in just 30 hours.
Please stop what you&rsquo;re doing immediately and read this:
Six Senate races are polling within TWO points.
The GOP must win three of those races to take the Senate majority.
The odds are 50-50 with 30 hours left, and you NEED to do everything possible to ensure Democrats win this tied election.
Will you pitch in before Election Day? Gifts will be triple-matched and sent IMMEDIATELY to tied battlegrounds for our Get Out The Vote push.

This race is nearly over. Time is almost out.
In two days, Mitch McConnell could be GONE. The Republicans could suffer a gut-wrenching loss. But we need every Democrat on board to win. Otherwise, we could fall one race short and we&rsquo;d lose everything we&rsquo;ve fought so hard for.
Election Day: 30 hours. Will you rush an urgent contribution to keep the Senate blue?
Thank you,
Harry Reid
Senate Majority Leader
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
