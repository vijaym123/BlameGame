Dear Friend, This week I am back in Indianapolis, talking to Hoosiers about how we solve our nation&rsquo;s problems and make our country even stronger.
From Beech Grove to Lawrence, I will be meeting with various community members and organizations talking about how we can work together to make Indianapolis a safe, enjoyable and productive place to live.
Here are just a couple of events going on this week that I wanted to make sure you knew about.
On Wednesday, I will be touring Central State, a new 150 acre redevelopment project on the city&rsquo;s west-side.
When complete, this $61 million development will consist of four projects that include apartments, a track and field space and a new school.
Later in the week, I will be joining our local letter carriers as they prepare to stamp out hunger.
We will be preparing for the state&rsquo;s largest single-day food drive by asking Hoosiers to place non-perishable food items next to their mailboxes this Saturday, May 9, 2015.
I look forward to keeping you updated on the work I&rsquo;m doing for you in Washington, and I look forward to seeing you around the district.
If there&rsquo;s anything I can do to help out, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to call on me.
INSIDE SCOOP:
FLAG REQUESTS The flag of the United States of America is the most visible symbol of our strength and values. I am pleased to inform you that at your request, my office is able to fly an American flag over the United States Capitol. To begin this process print, fill out, and mail this form to the address listed along with a check for the appropriate amount. Due to the high volume of flag requests the Capitol receives, flown flags can take 4-5 weeks to be returned to you.
