Farm Bill Passes Senate -- Heads to President's Desk for
Signature
Knowing of your interest in
agricultural issues, I wanted to let you know that the Senate approved the
five-year farm bill passed by the House last week sending it to
President Barack Obama for his
signature.
Though it did not include some of the larger reforms I and others had
hoped for, I am happy that this ends a two-year endeavor to find a
compromise that could successfully pass both the House and
the Senate.
The final conference report will most importantly give
America's farmers the assurance they need to plan for the future.
