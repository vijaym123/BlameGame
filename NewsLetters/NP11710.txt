Dear Friends,
My favorite part of this job is spending time in the district talking
with constituents. District work weeks provide a valuable opportunity
to meet with fellow Hoosiers and hear about the issues that are most
important to them.
During February's district work week, I had the chance to talk with
members of our emergency medical response community, local high tech
leaders, state legislators, school students and so many others. It was
a busy week, but one that will help me be a more effective voice for
Indiana's 5th District in Congress.
I was also able to introduce a piece of legislation that will help
Americans struggling under the weight of the President's healthcare
law. As the President continues to announce delays to his own law, it's
not fair that he continues to pick and choose which Americans those
delays impact. It's not fair that some people get the relief they need
and others don't. H.R. 4064, the FAIR Act, introduced by my colleague
Republican Study Committee Chairman Steve Scalise and me, fixes this
problem.
I hope you'll read more about some of these important events and the
FAIR Act in the sections below. As always, thank you for reading this
message and please feel free to be in touch with any thoughts or
questions you may have.
Best Wishes,
Susan W. Brooks

Rep. Brooks addresses the Indiana Senate.
Tech Listening Session:
Congresswoman Brooks partnered with TechPoint
to host a technology industry listening session on February 19 at the
Launch Fishers headquarters. Representatives from a wide range of
Hoosier internet, software, data storage and security companies
participated. Topics discussed included challenges presented by current
workforce visa rules, immigration guidelines and issues with net
neutrality.
Rep. Brooks is the Congressional Co-Chair of the Women's
High Tech Coalition, which seeks to connect women in high tech and
public policy fields to focus on issues of mutual concern.
Riverview Hospital Visit:
Rep. Brooks toured the Riverview Hospital
campus in Noblesville on February 19 and
participated in a listening
session with hospital employees where they discussed the impact of the
Affordable Care Act on hospitals.
She also met with Hamilton County
Health Department representatives and the Hamilton County Health
Medical Coalition.
Topics discussed included public health, medical
and EMS emergency response capabilities and her role as a member of the
Homeland Security Committee and Chairman of the Subcommittee on
Emergency Preparedness, Response and Communications.
Statehouse visit:
Congresswoman Brooks addressed members of the
Indiana House of Representatives and the Indiana Senate on February 20.
She discussed finding areas of common ground to improve life for all
Hoosiers, most especially our veterans. Rep. Brooks also presented a
Congressional Record to the family of the late Rep. Phyllis Pond
(R-Fort Wayne), a 37-year educator and a trailblazer for female
legislators.
Watch
Rep. Brooks discuss the FAIR Act on the
House Floor.
Congresswoman Brooks took to the House Floor recently in support of the
FAIR Act, a bill that provides individuals the same relief from the
Affordable Care Act that President Obama has already offered to
businesses. The legislation retroactively suspends Obamacare's
individual mandate penalties until 2016, as has been done to the
employer mandate most recently on February 10, 2014. It was introduced
by Congresswoman Brooks and Republican Study Committee Chairman Steve
Scalise (R-LA1) last week.
"This simple bill ensures that whenever the Obamacare employer mandate
is delayed the individual mandate is delayed as well," Congresswoman
Brooks explained. "House Republicans understand that fairness means not
treating people differently. It means government cannot pick and choose
which laws apply to which Americans. Mr. Speaker, let's pass this
common sense piece of legislation. It's the fair thing to do."

Rep.
Brooks
visits
with
Riverview
Hospital
staff
and
leadership.

Dear
Friends,
My
favorite
part
of
this
job
is
spending
time
in
the
district
talking
with
constituents.
District
work
weeks
provide
a
valuable
opportunity
to
meet
with
fellow
Hoosiers
and
hear
about
the
issues
that
are
most
important
to
them.
During
February's
district
work
week,
I
had
the
chance
to
talk
with
members
of
our
emergency
medical
response
community,
local
high
tech
leaders,
state
legislators,
school
students
and
so
many
others.
It
was
a
busy
week,
but
one
that
will
help
me
be
a
more
effective
voice
for
Indiana's
5 th
District
in
Congress.
I
was
also
able
to
introduce
a
piece
of
legislation
that
will
help
Americans
struggling
under
the
weight
of
the
President&#8217;s
healthcare
law.
As
the
President
continues
to
announce
delays
to
his
own
law,
it&#8217;s
not
fair
that
he
continues
to
pick
and
choose
which
Americans
those
delays
impact.
It&#8217;s
not
fair
that
some
people
get
the
relief
they
need
and
others
don&#8217;t.
H.R.
4064,
the
FAIR
Act,
introduced
by
my
colleague
Republican
Study
Committee
Chairman Steve
Scalise
and
me,
fixes
this

I
hope
you&#8217;ll
read
more
about
some
of

important

and the

As
always,
thank
you

the

Congresswoman

a
bill
that
provides
individuals
the
same
relief

that
President

has
already
offered
to
businesses.
The
legislation
retroactively
suspends
Obamacare&#8217;s
individual
mandate
penalties
until
2016,
as
has
been
done
to
the
employer
mandate
most
recently
on
February
10,
2014.
It
was
introduced
by
Congresswoman
Brooks
and
Republican
Study
Committee
Chairman
Steve
Scalise
(R-LA1)
last
week.
&#8220;This
simple
bill
ensures
that
whenever
the
Obamacare
employer
mandate
is
delayed
the
individual
mandate
is
delayed
as
well,"
Congresswoman
Brooks
explained.
"House
Republicans
understand
that
fairness
means
not
treating
people
differently.
It
means
government
cannot
pick
and
choose
which
laws
apply
to
which
Americans.
Mr.
Speaker,
let&#8217;s
pass
this
common
sense
piece
of
legislation.
It&#8217;s
the
fair
thing
to
do.&#8221;
