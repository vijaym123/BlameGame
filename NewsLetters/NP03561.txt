As Congress begins its
114 th
session, I am deeply humbled to serve as your Representative
in Washington and recommit myself to the battle to rebuild our nation
into the country it was designed to be
free, fair, virtuous and
prosperous.
I am inspired by the opportunities our nation has in the
coming two years.
Last November, the American people spoke,
and elected a new wave of thinking into both Chambers of Congress.
Rather than allow the bitter partisanship plaguing Washington to
continue, the public sought and made substantive change. This sweeping change
was not an affirmation of Republican principles, but rather an
indication of displeasure over the actions and direction taken by the Obama
Administration, and one to put a check on the Presidents
overreach.
Throughout New Mexico and across the nation, people are
concerned about their daily lives. Worse yet, they dont believe Congress
or anyone in Washington is doing anything to help ease their
concerns.
They fear core principles like - Liberty, Fairness, and a
Caring government have dissipated.
In America, real change
originates in the hearts of the people. When everyday Americans stand for
their beliefs, they have the power to affect change. The November
elections are proof of that principle.
Throughout the
country, Americans of all political persuasions are returning to the core
values that make our Nation great. These core values will put our
country back in the right direction.
Last year, revelations
were made about atrocities occurring at Department of Veterans Affairs
facilities nationwide.
The anger generated by the American people
over the terrible treatment of our veterans
spurred
lawmakers
to work together to find a solution. For the first time since its
creation, the VA underwent meaningful reform.
Changing
opinions of young women with access to technology, like sonograms, have
pressed State legislatures and Congress to reflect changing attitudes
towards abortion. In the last five years, more Americans than ever have
changed the way they think about the life of a child, and as a result,
nearly 25 percent of abortion facilities have shuttered across the
country, according to recent surveys reported in
The
Hill .
In 2011, newly-elected Wisconsin Governor, Scott
Walker, stood up to teachers unions to provide a better education system
for every student in his state, regardless of income. Despite $150
million spent in attacks from special interests and a recall election,
Governor Walker stuck to his principles, and was overwhelmingly elected
and reelected. The public wants to fix our broken education system, and
are willing to support anyone willing to try. After seeing that a
better education system is attainable, former Obama Chief of Staff and
current Democratic Mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, implemented similar
policies to improve the quality of education in his own
city.
From coast to coast, the American people are returning to values and
policies they know to be correct, and change is occurring.
This
is a message that must never be forgotten.
Together, we the
American people can move the nation in the right direction to restore our
prosperity and principles.
As Congress begins its
114 th
session, be assured that I will continue to fight
for all New Mexicans. As always, please do not hesitate to phone or
write me or my staff with any comments or concerns.
We look
forward to being of service.
