Did you see President Obama&rsquo;s email?
He&rsquo;s not fooling around. These Republican outside groups are spending hand-over-fist to knock out our Democratic candidates. So I&rsquo;ll be straight with you: if we can&rsquo;t close this 3-to-1 spending gap, we&rsquo;re going to be in for a rough election night this year.
Look -- this is no time to throw in the towel. When voters have all the facts, Democrats win. Our ideas are a whole lot better than what the other side is pitching. But we simply can&rsquo;t get the word out without your help.
David -- President Obama&rsquo;s asking. And now I&rsquo;m asking. Will you chip in $5 or more right now to fight Republican attacks with the facts? ALL GIFTS TODAY TRIPLE-MATCHED! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
Joe
P.S. I want you to remember this: If Democrats win a big electoral victory this year, it will be because of moments like this when you supported the candidates who put working folks ahead of Big Oil billionaires. Can you chip in something today -- even if it&rsquo;s just 5 bucks?
