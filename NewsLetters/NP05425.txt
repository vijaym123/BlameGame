Friend -- Early voting in many states has already started. Absentee ballots are going out right now.
That means our grassroots Get Out the Vote effort needs to happen TODAY -- not on November 4th.
And just how tough we can fight depends on how much we raise by the FEC deadline in 31 hours.
I don&rsquo;t have to tell you what&rsquo;s at stake if the Republicans take control of the Senate -- for women, for students, for seniors, and for working families. But that&rsquo;s what is on the line right now.
Friend, will you pitch in to our record-breaking Get Out The Vote Campaign to fight back and get every Democrat we can to the polls? Make your gift before the final fundraising deadline of the election in 31 hours.

Or donate another amount.
Karl Rove, the Koch brothers, and all the powerful interests are spending money in states like North Carolina and Georgia like they&#39;re aiming a fire hose.
That&rsquo;s why our campaigns are so close.
They know that spending millions of dollars to influence our elections is a drop in the bucket compared to the millions and billions of dollars in special breaks and tax loopholes they could receive from a Republican-controlled Senate.
The only way we can fight back against all that outside cash is to go door-to-door, person-to-person, talking to people about why it&rsquo;s so important that they vote.
This election is about who we are as a people, and what kind of country we want to be.
That may not be the easiest way to win, or the cheapest way to win, but it&rsquo;s the most effective way to win.
Will you pitch in to our record-breaking Get Out The Vote Campaign to fight back and get every Democrat we can to the polls? Make your gift before tomorrow -- the final fundraising deadline of the election.
There&rsquo;s one thing that the millionaires and billionaires can&rsquo;t buy with all their money: A tough, strong, committed grassroots team like you.
And that&rsquo;s why I know that if we mobilize enough voters -- and I know we can -- we&rsquo;ll protect the Democratic majority.
Best,
Sen. Elizabeth Warren
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
