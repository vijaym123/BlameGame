Hours ago, Republicans held a hearing to launch their biggest attack yet against President Obama -- they are suing the President.
The hearing made one thing clear: this is about blocking President Obama&rsquo;s action agenda and nothing else. Now we need to respond to Boehner&rsquo;s unprecedented legal threat in record numbers.
We&rsquo;re 13,247 donations away from hitting our goal of 200,000 strong since Boehner announced this frivolous lawsuit. Crushing that goal is the single most important thing we can do right now to get President Obama&rsquo;s back. Can you chip in to help us hit our target?
