 Efforts to de-fund the Department of Homeland Security are punitive and downright dangerous. It is wrong to play political football with something as sacred as our national security.

While many of us were digging our way out of the snow last Saturday, Congress was digging itself into a bigger hole on national security funding. You may have heard by now that
some lawmakers want to de-fund the Department of Homeland Security because they disagree with President Obama&#8217;s recent executive action on the deportation of undocumented immigrants. If we do not pass a funding bill by Saturday, the department will shut down.
A DHS shutdown will have dramatic effects on the security of our nation. Thousands of front-line DHS employees, including nearly 5,000 in Maryland, would be forced to work without
pay. Some would be furloughed. And worse, support for TSA screening at BWI Airport, cargo inspections at the Port of Baltimore, border security, FEMA disaster aid and critical grants that support state and local safety operations are at risk.
Even if you disagree with the President&#8217;s immigration policy, it is irresponsible to withhold funding from the agencies that protect Americans from terrorists. These
issues should be debated separately. I cosponsored a clean DHS funding bill and believe it would pass the House of Representatives if leadership would allow a vote.
On Tuesday, I took to the podium to urge my colleagues to pass a clean funding bill and keep the DHS open for business.
