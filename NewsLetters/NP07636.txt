Dear Friend-
Every day, I am
working in Congress to represent you and to make sure that your
priorities are heard here in the nation's capital.
Here in the House of
Representatives, we are in a constant fight to protect the programs
and services that the Bronx depends upon. Let me tell you about a few
of the things I have done lately.
Just one month ago,
I proposed and successfully passed an amendment to require that the
Postal Service continues to deliver mail six days a week, something that
is important for many Bronx residents who depend upon these important
services.
Two weeks ago, I supported legislation to
reform and update federal job training programs, which will ensure
that Bronx residents have greater access to opportunities to improve job
skills and wages.
And last week, as the lead Democrat
on an appropriations bill, I fought on the floor of the House of
Representatives to protect and expand funding for the vital agencies that
protect consumers and police Wall Street.
To learn more
about what I am doing in Washington to help the Bronx, please take a
moment to follow me on social media.

I
continue to fight for Bronx priorities in Congress every day. From housing,
to economic development, to immigration, to small businesses, I am here
working for you. If you have any questions or need help with a
federal agency, please do not hesitate to reach out to my office at

Sincerely,
Congressman Jos E.
Serrano
