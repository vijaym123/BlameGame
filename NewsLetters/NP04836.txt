Friend -- Some of the most important Democratic women in the nation have emailed you this week.
That&rsquo;s because with only FOUR days left until the election, we have an opportunity to make history:
SIX Democratic women are leading their polls.
If they all win, we&rsquo;d have a record-high 19 Democratic women in the Senate!
We&rsquo;d kick out Mitch McConnell, save the Senate, and set Republicans back for years!
But Friend, at this point in the game, it&rsquo;s all about getting out the vote.
If you support our Final Weekend Get Out The Vote Push, we&rsquo;ll be able to contact EVERY voter in EVERY battleground state and WIN.
But if you don&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;re in real danger of losing in the final days -- and we just can&rsquo;t let that happen.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking again: Will you pitch in to beat the GOP and keep the Senate blue? We&rsquo;ll triple-match all gifts before the end-of-month deadline at midnight!
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
I have some incredible news to share:
The DSCC could hit ONE MILLION DOLLARS in grassroots donations in a single day for the first time in HISTORY.
I am so, so thankful that I have the amazing, committed Democratic base on my side.
If we hit $1 million today, we can make our ambitious Final Weekend Get Out The Vote Push a reality, win the election, and hand Republicans an utterly heartbreaking defeat.
Can you help us hit $1,000,000? Pitch in today and we&rsquo;ll triple-match your gift and send it immediately to critical battlegrounds .
Thank you for everything,
Senator Patty Murray
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
