Dear Friends,
As you've
heard, Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki offered his resignation
this morning, which President Obama accepted.
The
resignation of Secretary Shinseki is coming too late for thousands of veterans
who have been let down by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The VAs
systemic failures demand investigation, reform and rebuilding, and
the secretarys resignation is just the beginning.
Our
veterans need to know that the VA will deliver timely, quality care, and we
must move quickly to ensure that the VA will deliver on its
commitments to all of our nations veterans.
If you are experiencing
or have experienced problems with care at the VA, please contact one
of my offices:

ENERGY: JOBS FOR WEST
VIRGINIANS
President Obama is expected to introduce sweeping new regulations on existing
coal-fired power plants on Monday, an action that may have a
devastating impact on West Virginia's energy economy.
In a
preemptive letter to the president this week, I explained that new regulations
would hurt West Virginia's families.
I urge you to
consider the impact that your administrations existing coal plant rule will
have on the people of my state of West Virginia who want to go to
work, provide for their families, and produce affordable energy that
powers our economy. I urge you to think of the impact that higher
electricity prices will have on senior citizens and others on fixed incomes. I
urge you to step back and listen to the voices of those who will be
harmed the most by the EPAs rulemaking and avoid proposing a rule that
will destroy economic opportunity in West Virginia and across our
country, I wrote.
I encourage you
to click here and read my letter
on the impact new
regulations may have on our state.
Thank you for reading my
weekly
e-newsletter, and as
always, you can join in the conversation on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Shelley
Moore Capito
