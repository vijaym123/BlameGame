Dear Friend,
I wanted to let you know that National Journal has ranked me as the
FOURTH most conservative member of the United States House of
Representatives and the MOST conservative member here in Tennessee.
You can view the rankings
here:http://www.nationaljournal.com/pictures-video/the-15-most-conservat
ive-representatives-20140206
I promised my constituents I would be an independent, conservative
voice in Congress and every day I work hard to meet that promise.
Talking the talk is not enough; I know that Tennessee's Fourth
Congressional District expects me to fight for the conservative
principles we hold no matter what. I will continue to do just that.
Also, last week Congressional Quarterly listed me as one of the TOP
FIVE Republican Members of Congress who has consistently voted against
President Barack Obama's agenda.
It is truly an honor to serve you in Congress and I look forward to
continuing our fight against the President Obama's big government
policies that have hurt job creation and landed us in more than $17
trillion of debt.
Thank you,
Rep. Scott DesJarlais, MD

my

independent,
conservative
voice

Congress
and
every
day
I
work
hard
to
meet
that
promise.
Talking
the
talk
is
not

I
know
that
Tennessee&#8217;s
Fourth
Congressional
District
expects
me
to

I
