Friend-
The government spends
billions
in duplicative programs every year. Thats why I believe that, when Congress proposes the creation of a new program or initiative, lawmakers should be required to justify to the American people why the program is necessary and how it adds value, ensuring that it's not duplicative to programs already in place.
I cosponsored
H.RES.45
to do just that. Duplicative government programs add needless and costly layers of bureaucracy to an already too bulky system -- limited government is effective government.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.
I will continue to aggressively scrutinize the way taxpayer dollars are spent, and work to cut back waste in duplicative, underutilized, and unnecessary government programs. Read about my specific efforts,
