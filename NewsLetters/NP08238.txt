Demanding Answers on EPA Negligence
W atch full video
here.
It was quite the week on Capitol Hill. The House Oversight
and Government Reform Committee, which I serve on, heard from the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner as well as the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator. Both answered questions about
gross incompetence and negligence within their agency. Last week we were
informed that the IRS "lost" years worth of emails related to the tea
party targeting scandal. This week I was told that the EPA also"lost"
numerous emails related to an EPA official currently under
investigation. This is wholly unacceptable. If the EPA continues tostonewall
Congress, the Oversight Committee will be forced to hold the agency in
contempt of Congress. I will continue to fight for more transparency from
these agencies.
Discussing
the EPA's "Lost Emails" with Neil
Cavuto
Watch the
full video
here.
On Thursday, I joined Neil Cavuto on Fox Business to discuss the
EPA's failure to archive email correspondences, which is likely in
violation of federal law. Earlier in the week, I questioned the EPA
Administrator over whether the agency was in violation of the Federal Records
Act for failing to back up email correspondences. These laws exist for
a reason. No agency has the right to pick and choose which laws to
follow.
Making Sure Our Veterans Have the Medical Care They
Deserve
This week, I introduced a bipartisan
bill along with Rep. Ami Bera (D-CA), that will help address wait
times at Veterans Affairs(VA)hospitals by boosting the number of VA
doctors. The Doctors Helping Heroes Act would allow foreign doctors trained
in the U.S. to extend visas to practice at VA hospitals and
underserved rural communities. Ourcountry is currentlyprojectedto have
ashortage of 63,000 doctors by 2015 and more than 130,000 by 2025,
according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Ensuring that our
brave veterans have the proper care they deserve is a top priority of
mine. You can read more about the bill

Hezbollah Sanctions Bill Advances Through
Committee
On Thursday, my bill, The
Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act of 2014,
H.R. 4411 ,advanced through the House Foreign Affairs
Committee. The bipartisan legislation seeks to cripple the terrorist
organization's vast network of illegal financing. The bill has wide support
from the majority of the House of Representatives with
315co-sponsors. The next step will be for the bill to be taken up for a vote on the
House floor. You can read more about it
