Dear David,
From the Obama Administration's
EPA's gross regulatory over-reach to the HHS's cherry-picking which
ObamaCare provisions to delay, this administration has a bad habit of
ignoring the law - and the Constitution.
Earlier this week,
I traveled across Missouri to talk with local leaders, young people,
and other members of a number of communities about the real impact of
the Obama Administration's executive over-reach and costly
regulations.

week.
I
introduced
the "ENFORCE the Law Act," a bill that
would help ensure the president upholds his constitutional duty to
faithfully execute the law. It's time for Congress to tell the president
that he cannot ignore the law. This bill has already passed in the
House. It's time for the Senate to vote.
I hope you will join
this important conversation online by sharing your thoughts on my
Facebook
page, on
Twitter , on
YouTube , and on
Instagram .
