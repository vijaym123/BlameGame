E-Alert: Visiting our Troops Overseas
Sitting in committee hearings and Capitol Hill offices is part of my job, but doesn't always allow me to get a true picture of how policies crafted in Washington DC are carried out in Ohio and across the globe. That's why I travel the 2nd District whenever I can, talking with families and businesses about the challenges and opportunities they face in Ohio every day.
Another part of my job in Congress, as a member of the House Armed Services Committee, is working closely with our armed forces, from readiness planning to decisions regarding military personnel.
That's why I traveled to Afghanistan and Africa earlier this month, to visit our troops, get on-the-ground updates about our anti-terrorism policies in action, and see firsthand what's working and what's not.
We cannot forget our troops are still serving the nation abroad, and I will do my part in Congress to support them in uniform and when they return home as veterans.
In Afghanistan,
I had the opportunity to visit some of our forward operating bases in the country where American troops are stationed and training Afghan nationals to take over their security. With the war there winding down, it's important that we equip the Afghan government with the ability to combat Taliban aggression in the years to come.
While
in Africa,
I toured Navy vessels stationed for anti-terror and anti-piracy assignments and met with commanders on the ground, who partner with governments to combat a growing terrorist presence in the continent. We've witnessed the horrific attack at a Kenyan mall last year, among others, and must work to prevent these types of plots before they go into action.
Empowering local forces to take ownership of their country's security will prevent threats from ever emerging at a global level.
I'm committed to standing for those who serve our nation in uniform and supporting their mission to combat terrorism around the globe.
In Your Service,
Brad Wenstrup
U.S. Representative
Ohio's 2nd Congressional District
