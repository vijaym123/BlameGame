Dear Fellow Nevadan,
I am pleased to
announce that Nevada will receive new electricity allocations from
Hoover Dam as a result of the Hoover Power Allocation Act. I first
introduced this legislation in 2009 and reintroduced it in 2011, the year it
was passed and signed into law. This law ensures that clean, renewable
electricity from Hoover Dam will continue to power Nevada through
2067.
This news means that Nevada's oldest renewable energy
project will deliver a new round of benefits to the Silver State. The
benefits from this announcement are the result of years of work to pass
the Hoover Power Allocation Act, and I was proud to join President
Obama in 2011 when my legislation was signed into law. This law expanded
the eligibility of entities in Nevada that could receive electricity
from Hoover Dam and it guarantees that Nevada will continue to reap its
benefits for another fifty years.
The following entities
have been awarded electricity from Hoover Dam by the Western Area Power
Administration:
City of
Henderson
City of Las Vegas
City of North Las
Vegas
Clark County School District
Clark County Water
Reclamation District
College of Southern
Nevada
Las Vegas Paiute Tribe
Las Vegas Valley Water
District
Nevada Department of
Corrections
Nevada Department of Administration
Nevada Department of
Transportation
University of Nevada Las
Vegas
In addition to these new entities, the Hoover Power Allocation
Act continues to provide affordable, renewable energy to the following
entities throughout Nevada including the Southern Nevada Water
Authority, Boulder City, Lincoln County, Overton Power District, Valley
Electric, and Nevada industries at the Basic Management Industrial Complex
near Henderson. The electricity generated at Hoover Dam also helps
Nevada to meet peak demands at lower costs.
RECENT
LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND :
In December
2011, President Obama signs the Hoover Power Allocation Act into
law.
In October 2011, the Senate passes the Hoover Power
Allocation.
In October 2011, the House of Representatives
passes the Hoover Power Allocation Act.
Senator Reid
lead the Nevada delegation in introducing the Hoover Power Allocation
Act in December 2009.
BACKGROUND ON HOOVER
DAM :
The Boulder Canyon
Project Act of 1928 authorized the Secretary of Interior to construct
Hoover Dam and enter into contracts for the sale of power generated at the
dam.
Hoover Dam is operated and maintained by the Bureau
of Reclamation and it was dedicated by President Roosevelt in
1935.
There are 17 main turbines in the Hoover Power Plant
nine on
the Arizona wing and eight on the Nevada wing.
According
to the Bureau of Reclamation, Nevada receives approximately 25 percent
of the electricity generated at Hoover Dam and the ten-year average
annual net generation for Hoover Dam through 2008 was about 4.2 billion
kilowatt-hours.
By statute, the Colorado River Commission
delivers some of that electricity to municipalities like Boulder City;
Lincoln County; Overton Power District; and Valley Electric. The
Commission also delivers power to the Basic Management Industrial Complex
near Henderson.
In 1984, Congress enacted the Hoover Power
Plant Act which authorized the Secretary of Energy to allocate the
power produced at the dam under three schedules, and the allocation of
power under these schedules was scheduled to expire in
2017.
