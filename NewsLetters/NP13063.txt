Rep. Miller: House Passes Responsible Budget Rolling Back Spending to 2009 Levels
Jan 15, 2014
WASHINGTON &#8211; U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10) today praised the U.S. House of Representatives strong bipartisan
passage (359 to 67) of the fiscal year 2014 Omnibus Appropriations bill (H.R. 3547) &#8211; a measure which provides responsible funding for every aspect of the federal government, from our national defense, to our transportation systems, to the education of our
nation&#8217;s children.
This measure realign&#8217;s the nation&#8217;s funding priorities back to where they belong by: Ending the habit of putting our spending on autopilot; continuing to cut wasteful spending and target precious tax dollars to important programs where
they are needed the most; and carrying forward the significant decrease in unneeded federal spending, putting our nation on a sustainable path to fiscal prosperity.
The bill now heads to the Senate for consideration.
Miller made the following comments:
&#8220;Since the spending binge of the first two years of the Obama Administration which drove the federal government to annual
budget deficits of over $1 trillion, the American people have been demanding that Washington get its fiscal house in order.
The government funding bill, I was proud to vote in favor of today in the House of Representatives and which passed with broad bipartisan
support, is a victory for everyone who has demanded fiscal responsibility and accountability in federal spending.
Outline of the reduction in Washington discretionary spending:
&#8226; Discretionary spending for Fiscal Year 2014 is $191 billion below the President&#8217;s vision for FY14 in his first budget request in 2009.
&#8226; FY14 is $79 billion below FY 2011 enacted levels.
&#8226; FY14 is $46 billion below the level called for in the FY14 Senate passed budget.
&#8226; Discretionary spending in 2014 will be less than what the government spent in 2009
&#8226; Discretionary spending in this bill is even $27 billion below the level set for FY14 in the Paul Ryan Budget passed by the House in 2011.
&#8220;While there is much more to be done, it is clear that those demanding fiscal restraint are winning the debate in Washington
and that fight will continue as we go forward.
The ultimate beneficiaries of the return of fiscal responsibility will be our children and future generations who will not be saddled with even more debt, increasing their ability to achieve their dreams.
This
bipartisan deal also ends the political gridlock that has kept Washington careening from crisis to crisis over the last several years with constant threats of government shutdowns and brings certainty that government will continue to function to the American
people and financial markets.
It also ends the practice of passing continuing resolutions that locks in unnecessary and wasteful spending and prevents Congress from performing its constitutional duty to exercise the power of the purse.
&#8220;When families or small businesses face budget difficulties they don&#8217;t just continue spending at current levels or reduce
spending across the board, as government does with the use of continuing resolutions.
Instead they set priorities and make appropriate decisions.
This is exactly what Congress has done with the passage of this appropriations measure, and that has allowed
us to spend additional needed resources on top priorities, such as providing the resources to our men and women of the military, supporting our veterans, increasing education funding for our children (such as restoring funding for Head Start programs), and
increasing funding for the National Institutes of Health to continue our nation&#8217;s needed medical research &#8211; while at the same time reducing or eliminating other spending.
&#8220;This appropriations measure has a very positive impact on us in Michigan.
The bill restores the full funding of a major
priority of mine: the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a fund dedicated to the health and viability of our most treasured resource, our Great Lakes and the rivers and habitats that support them.
Also included within the overall appropriations measure is
funding for the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund to maintain and improve some of our area&#8217;s harbors and waterways &#8211; projects which directly support commerce and recreation within our coastal communities.
Additionally, Michigan defense companies will receive
investments in programs such as the M1 Abrams and Stryker which will assist with our nation&#8217;s support of our military men and women, ensuring they have the best equipment to meet their missions and keep them safe.
Outline of Michigan-related budget priorities:
&#8226; Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI): The Omni provides full funding for the GLRI - $300 million.
-- Current examples of GLRI projects in MI-10 include: Anchor Bay/St Clair Flats Phragmites Control and Education, Port Huron St. Clair River Shoreline &#8211; South, Upper St. Clair River Shoreline, Cuttle Creek, Cottrellville Township &#8211; Shoreline, Marine City Drain,
Harsens Island Habitat Restoration, St. Clair In-River Habitat Restoration.
&#8226; State Revolving Funds:
The Clean Water SRF got $1.5B and the Drinking Water SRF got $907M.
Both of these are increases from FY13 sequestered levels.
&#8226; Increases funding for Army Corps of Engineers funding by 10% above FY13 levels.
&#8226; Provides $1 billion for activities related to Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund.
&#8226; Provides Operations &amp; Maintenance funding for:
-- Channels in Lake St. Clair ($173,000)
-- St. Clair River ($649,000)
-- Sebewaing River ($25,000)
&#8226; Includes a provision that provides the Army Corps with $3.5 million authorization for emergency measures to combat Asian carp
&#8226; Provides $55M for the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) at Michigan State University and establishes a new congressional reprogramming control point.
&#8220;While there is still a great deal of work to be done, this appropriations measure is a win for America &#8211; responsibly providing
the federal resources to move our nation forward and protecting the future generations to come.&#8221;
Note : The Omnibus contains all 12 regular
appropriations bills for fiscal year 2014, with no area of the government functioning under a Continuing Resolution. This allows every program to be weighed individually and prioritized, with funding targeted to the most important and effective programs while
lower-priority programs are reduced.
