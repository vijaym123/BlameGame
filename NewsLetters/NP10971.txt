introduction
Friends,
As you know, I am a vocal opponent of Common Core. I have been asked
though what, if anything, can I do at the federal level to fight
against it. I co-sponsored and helped pass the Student Success Act
in the House of Representatives, which would prohibit the federal
government from coercing states into adopting standards like Common
Core. I will continue to do what I can in Washington, but we need the
General Assembly in Tennessee to act. It is good to know there are a
few dedicated legislators and activists who are leading the charge. I
am rooting for you and will assist in any way possible.
My office is continuing to monitor the situation in Ukraine. I was one
of 17 Members of Congress to vote against authorizing President Obama
to send nearly a billion dollar to Ukraine without a long-term
strategy. I just don't see how we can justify borrowing money from
China to send to Ukraine, only to have it end up in the hands of
corrupt officials. This is especially true when we have so many
veterans who have had to endure unfair cuts.
On a personal note, I had the pleasure of being my daughter's date
to the United
Way's father-daughter dance in Winchester last weekend. It is certainly
an honor to serve in Congress, but the best job in the world will
always be being Maggie's dad. They grow up so fast!
Please stay in touch. Thank you for the honor of serving you in
Congress. Have a great weekend.

DesJarlais gives update on measures before Congress
On his way to his first tour of the Wacker Chemie North America plant
site, 4th District U.S. Congressman Scott DesJarlais sat down with the
Cleveland Daily Banner to talk about his work in Congress. DesJarlais
said while at the plant he planned on asking what he could do as a
Congressman that would help them.
The Chattanoogan
Rep. DesJarlais: Real Nation Building Should Start Here At Home
During my time as a congressman, one thing I have learned is that the
devil is always in the details. Legislation with the grandest of
intentions can lead to the most pernicious of outcomes.

One of the ways we can prepare our students to compete in a
twenty-first century economy is to create partnerships between colleges
and local industries so students graduate with real world skills and
experience. Here in Tennessee's Fourth District, Motlow College
has done exactly that by teaming
with Bridgestone and Nissan to create their mechatronics program. Click

introduction
Friends,
As
you
know,
I
am
a
vocal
opponent
of
Common
Core.
I
have
been
asked
though
what,
if
anything,
can
I
do
at
the
federal
level
to
fight
against
it.
I
co-sponsored
and
helped
pass
the
Student
Success
Act
in
the
House
of
Representatives,
which
would
prohibit
the
federal
government
from
coercing
states
into
adopting
standards
like
Common
Core.
I
will
continue
to
do
what
I
can
in
Washington,
but
we
need
the
General
Assembly
in
Tennessee
to
act.
It
is
good
to
know
there
are
a
few
dedicated
legislators
and
activists
who
are
leading
the
charge.
I
am
rooting
for
you
and
will
assist
in
any
way
possible.
My
office
is
continuing
to
monitor
the
situation
in
Ukraine.
I
was
one
of
17
Members
of
Congress
to
vote
against
authorizing
President
Obama
to
send
nearly
a
billion
dollar
to
Ukraine
without
a
long-term

I
just
don&#8217;t
see
how
we
can
justify
borrowing
money
from
China
to
send
to
Ukraine,
only
to
have
it
end
up
in
the
hands
of
corrupt
officials.
This
is
especially
true
when
we
have
so
many
veterans
who
have
had
to
endure
unfair
cuts.
On
a
personal
note,
I
had
the
pleasure
of
being
my
daughter&#8217;s
date
to
the
United

Winchester
last

It
is
certainly
an
honor
to
serve
in
Congress,
but
the
best
job
in
the
world
will
always
be
being
Maggie&#8217;s
dad.
They
grow
up
so
fast!
Please
stay
in

Thank
you

Have
