Dear
Fellow Nevadan:
We are fortunate to have year-round
opportunities to enjoy nature throughout our great state as we celebrate Great
Outdoors Month. I am proud to have sponsored legislation in 1993 that
designated the
Spring Mountains
as a national
recreation area, which includes
Mt. Charleston . It is
a great place to get outside and escape the hot summer in Southern
Nevada. Another way to stay cool is by visiting the
Lake Mead National Recreation Area . In recent years, we have been
able to fund critical projects at the lake including extending marinas
and building floating boat docks. This has kept the lake accessible
despite the falling water levels.
In Northern Nevada, everyone
knows the beauty we have at
Lake Tahoe . I will
continue the effort to pass the
Lake Tahoe
Restoration Act
in order to preserve the gem of the Sierras. Northern
Nevada is also home to several other lakes, rivers,
wildlife refuges , and hiking trails which are fun for the entire
family.
Of course, if you live in Eastern Nevada, or can take a
weekend trip or longer, I recommend visiting
Great
Basin National Park , Nevadas only national park. I am proud to
have sponsored the legislation to establish Great Basin in 1986. The
Lehman Caves within the park are a wonder you will never
forget.
We are blessed to live in a state with such magnificent natural
areas to explore. I hope you will take the time to enjoy them this
month and year-round.
