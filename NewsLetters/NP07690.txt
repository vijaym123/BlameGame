Ag Shipment Delays Hurt Everyone
Farming is more than simply a job for the nearly one in four North
Dakotans who are employed in the industry. Agriculture is a North
Dakota tradition that is engrained in the fabric of our state - and has
been for generations. It touches the lives of everyone - providing food
for families in North Dakota and across the nation.
For these reasons, it is essential we make sure our farmers overcome
the most pressing challenges facing their operations right now: serious
delays along the rails throughout the state that are preventing moving
grain to market.
Since the oil boom, North Dakota has seen a huge increase in the number
of railcars traveling through the state. Oil and gas are valuable
resources and major economic engines for North Dakota. However, this
increased traffic on the rails has led to an unacceptable deterioration
in service for our farmers since this past winter. The railroads need
to work hard to catch up on their shipment backlog, and make the
investments necessary to accommodate all of the shipping needs of the
state and the region because increased traffic along the rails should
not come at the expense of our agricultural shipments.
Recent reports have shown there are more than 4,500 past due cars in
North Dakota which are each about 30 days late. And many North Dakota
farmers I've spoken with are concerned that continued delays on the
railroads might interfere with their abilities to move out last year's
crops from storage in time for the coming crop year's harvest. Already,
North Dakota State University estimates agriculture shipment delays
have cost North Dakota farmers $66 million in revenue from January to
April. This is unacceptable and I'm pushing on all sides to end the
delays and support our farmers.
Since last winter, I have been working hard to provide farmers with the
rail certainty they need when transporting their harvests. With the
proper investments, both agriculture and oil can share the rails, and I
have been pushing the railroads to address these key issues. A few days
ago, I sent a letter to Canadian Pacific asking the company for an
update on how it plans to accommodate the fall harvest and resolve the
poor service. I have also been in regular contact with Burlington
Northern Santa Fe to pressure it to end the delays on its rails, and it
has pledged to make some needed investments. Since the delays began,
I've been in regular contact with one of the top federal transportation
officials - Surface Transportation Board Chairman Dan Elliott - to talk
about the challenges facing ag shippers in North Dakota and how to
overcome them.
Moving grain is one of the great challenges facing North Dakota
agriculture today, and we have to solve this situation. I will continue
to fight for our farmers so they can continue to provide us with the
food we rely on.

Ag
Shipment
Delays
Hurt
Everyone
Farming
is
more
than
simply
a
job
for
the
nearly
one
in
four
North
Dakotans
who
are
employed
in
the
industry.
Agriculture
is
a
North
Dakota
tradition
that
is
engrained
in
the
fabric
of
our
state
-
and
has
been
for
generations.
It
touches
the
lives
of
everyone
-
providing
food
for
families
in
North
Dakota
and
across
the
nation.
For
these
reasons,
it
is
essential
we
make
sure
our
farmers
overcome
the
most
pressing
challenges
facing
their
operations
right
now:
serious
delays
along
the
rails
throughout
the
state
that
are
preventing
moving
grain
to
market.
Since
the
oil
boom,
North
Dakota
has
seen
a
huge
increase
in
the
number
of
railcars
traveling
through
the
state.
Oil
and
gas
are
valuable
resources
and
major
economic
engines
for
North
Dakota.
However,
this
increased
traffic
on
the
rails
has
led
to
an
unacceptable
deterioration
in
service
for
our
farmers
since
this
past
winter.
The
railroads
need
to
work
hard
to
catch
up
on
their
shipment
backlog,
and
make
the
investments
necessary
to
accommodate
all

of
the
state
and
the

because
increased

should
not

of
our
agricultural
shipments.
Recent
reports
have
shown
there
are
more

4,500
past

cars
in
North
Dakota
which
are
each
about
30

And
many
North
Dakota
farmers
I've
spoken
with
are
concerned
that
continued
delays
on
the
railroads
might
interfere
with
their
abilities
to
move
out
last
year's
crops
from
storage
in
time
for
the
coming
crop
year's
harvest.
Already,
North
Dakota
State
University
estimates
agriculture
shipment
delays
have
cost
North
Dakota
farmers
$66
million
in
revenue
from
January
to
April.
This
is
unacceptable
and
I'm
pushing
on
all
sides
to
end
the
delays
and
support
our
farmers.
Since
last
winter,
I
have
been
working
hard
to
provide
farmers
with
the
rail
certainty
they
need
when
transporting
their
harvests.
With
the
proper
investments,
both
agriculture
and
oil
can
share
the
rails,
and
I
have
been
pushing
the
railroads
to
address
these
key
issues.
A
few
days
ago,
I
sent
a
letter
to
Canadian
Pacific
asking
the
company
for
an
update
on
how
it
plans
to
accommodate
the
fall
harvest
and
resolve
the
poor
service.
I
have
also
been
in
regular
contact
with
Burlington
Northern
Santa
Fe
to
pressure
it
to
end
the
delays
on
its
rails,
and
it
has
pledged
to
make
some

investments.
Since
the
delays
began,
I've
been
in
regular

with
one

the

the

facing
ag
shippers
in
North
Dakota
and
how
to
overcome
them.
Moving
grain
is
one
of
the
great
challenges
facing
North
Dakota
agriculture
today,
and
we
have
to
solve
this
situation.
I
will
continue
to
fight
for
our
farmers
so
they
can
continue
to
provide
us
with
the
food
we
rely
on.
