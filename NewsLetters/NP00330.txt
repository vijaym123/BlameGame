Senators Introduce Bill To Deny
Resources To Castro's Military And
Security Services
Earlier this week, Marco introduced
the
Cuban
Military Transparency Act ,
bipartisan legislation that would ensure
any increase in resources to Cuba reach the
Cuban people by prohibiting financial
transactions with the Castro regimes
military and security services.
Read Marcos statement about the bill
below and learn more
here .
Rubio: It is not in the interest
of the United States or the people of Cuba
for the U.S. to become a financier of the
Castro regimes brutality. The Cuban
Military Transparency Act would prevent
U.S. dollars from getting into the hands of
the Cuban military and would demand
accountability from the Obama
Administration regarding fugitives of
American justice in Cuba, the return of
stolen and uncompensated property and the
role of the Ministry of the Revolutionary
Armed Forces and the Ministry of the
Interior in Cuba.
Marco also wrote a letter to Secretary of
State John Kerry urging him to prioritize
action in four key areas as negotiations
continue regarding the normalization of
relations between the U.S. and Cuba and the
possible re-opening of the U.S. embassy in
Havana. Marco pledged to oppose the
confirmation of any nominee to be U.S.
ambassador to Cuba absent concrete results
on political reforms and human rights, the
repatriation of U.S. terrorists and
fugitives being harbored in Cuba, resolving
uncompensated property claims, and removal
of restrictions on U.S. diplomats in Cuba.
Read an excerpt of Marcos letter
below and the full letter
here .
Rubio: Despite more than five
months of discussions with the Cuban
government, I am very concerned about the
lack of political reforms, and progress on
human rights; the continued harboring of
known terrorists and other fugitives from
U.S. justice; the outstanding American
property claims and judgments against the
Cuban government; and the limitations that
continue to be placed on American diplomats
working in Havana. By conditioning any
normalization of relations with Cuba on
these topics and other areas, the U.S. can
leverage the prospect of improved bilateral
relations to obtain tangible benefits for
both the American and Cuban peoples."
Rubio, Shaheen Welcome House Passage Of
Girls Count Act, Call For Presidents
Signature This week, Marco
and Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) welcomed
the U.S. House of Representatives
passage of the
Girls
Count Act , a bill they
introduced
earlier this year
directing current
U.S. foreign assistance programming to
support the rights of women and girls in
developing countries by working to
establish birth registries in their
countries. Having
passed
in the Senate
last week, the bill now
awaits the Presidents signature to
become law.
Read Marcos statement below and
learn more about the bill
here .
Rubio: Passage of the Girls Count
Act in the House brings us one step closer
to solving the massive problem regarding
children for whom no official records exist
because they were not registered at birth
.
I hope President Obama will sign
the bill swiftly and solidify our
countrys commitment to helping all
kids get registered so we can make sure
every child worldwide is counted and able
to fully participate in and contribute to
their societies.
Rubio Comments On Passage Of USA
Freedom Act
This week, Marco voted against the
USA Freedom Act. Read an
excerpt of his statement about the vote
below and the full statement
here .
Rubio: The failure to renew the
expiring components of the PATRIOT Act was
a mistake. The USA Freedom
Act weakens U.S. national security
by outlawing the very programs our
intelligence community and the FBI have
used to protect us time and time again. A
major challenge for the next president will
be to fix the significantly weakened
intelligence system that the current one is
leaving behind."
Rubio: Tiananmen Anniversary A
Reminder That China Deserves No More Free
Passes On Human Rights
Marco and Representative Chris Smith
(R-NJ-4), co-chairs of the U.S.
Congressional Executive Commission on
China, wrote a letter to Chinese President
Xi Jinping commemorating the 26
th
anniversary of the Tiananmen
Square protests and urged the release all
prisoners of conscience prior to his visit
to the U.S. in September. Read the full
letter
here .
Marco also marked the anniversary by
writing an op-ed where he called on the
Obama Administration to take steps to bring
human rights to the forefront of our
relationship with China.
Read an excerpt below and the full op-ed
here .
Rubio: For too long, China has
gotten a free pass. With the approaching
U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue,
the president has an opportunity to
prioritize these issues
to charge
every participating U.S. government agency
to bring human rights to the forefront with
their Chinese counterparts, to present them
with lists of political prisoners and to
press, by name, for their unconditional
release. The administration can take
proactive steps today to impose visa bans
on Chinese government officials who are
perpetrators of grave human-rights
abuses.
