Dear Fellow Nevadan,
World
AIDS Day reminds us to take a moment to remember the lives lost to
AIDS. It is also a time where we rededicate ourselves to finding a cure.
In Nevada alone, there are thousands living with HIV/AIDS. These men
and women are our parents, our children, and our
neighbors.
While weve seen some remarkable improvements in how we treat and
prevent HIV/AIDS both at home and abroad, we still have a long way to go.
We are increasing access to important services like HIV testing and
treatments and investing in critical initiatives that help prevent AIDS
overseas, but there are still far too many people left
behind.
I pledge to work to achieve the goal of World AIDS Day: an
AIDS-free generation. And I will continue to work in Congress to protect
these programs and ensure access to the important resources these men and
women, gay and straight, need to live.
