Friends,
It was an eventful week
in our Nation's Capitol.
Fighting ISIL
This
week, President Obama formally sent to Congress his request for
Authorization for Use of Military Force
to fight ISIL, or
ISIS as the terrorist group is als known. You can find a good
breakdown of what is, and isn't, in this request
here .
Voting to authorize the use of military force is one of the most
important and serious actions Congress can take. I am glad the President
has rightfully come to Congress for this authorization. I have yet to
see a clear strategy from the President protecting the United States and
confronting this threat posed by ISIL. I look forward
to carefully reviewing this
authorization and hearing more details about the President's strategy in
the coming weeks from the administration and our military
leaders.
I also want to
hear from you. Please take my poll below so I can learn more about
what my constituents think about how to fight the growing terrorist
threat.
If you were in my
shoes, would you give the President the authority he requested in his
AUMF? Yes No Not Sure Do you have other opinons on the
situation you would like me to know? *By answering this survey, you are subscribing to my newsletter. If you are having trouble, click here.
Keystone
XL
After 6 years,
legislation approving
the Keystone XL Pipeline
is finally going to the President's
desk.
This project would help
make America more energy
independent by moving 830,000 barrels of oil per day and
creating
40,000 jobs. Though the President has threatened to veto this bill,
I hope he will change his mind, stop playing politics with the issue
and do what is right for the United States.
Speaking about the need for President Obama to approve the
Keystone XL
Pipeline.
Tax Certainty for Small
Businesses
For too long, small business owners have been hampered by too
much uncertainty coming out of Washington. So, this week we
passed
H.R. 636, Americas Small Business Tax Relief
Act
to give business the certainty they need for their companies to
thrive. No longer will they have to wait for an act of Congress to change
the tax code at the last minute, as has happened in recent years, to
determine whether they will be able to make the critical investments
they need for their company to succeed.
I hope you enjoy President's Day
tomorrow.
