Friends,
Agriculture is
a vital part of South Carolinas economy and it is important that I
hear about issues facing our farmers.
In order to better
serve you, I am hosting an agriculture tour of the 7th District and
hope you can join me at some of the stops listed below.
Congressman Mike Conaway (TX-11) of the House Committee on Agriculture, and
South Carolina Department of Agriculture Commissioner Hugh Weathers will
join me on the tour to discuss federal and state farming issues.
Our farmers work
tirelessly to provide our community with a reliable and safe food source.
This is not an easy task and one we must not take for
granted.
I look forward to thanking our farmers and listening to
their concerns and needs during this hands-on tour.

Saving American Workers
You
and I know tourism is a leading industry in our district, and we are
proud of it!
Tourism supplies our economy with thousands of
customer service jobs.
When I
worked in the service industry, I understood it was common for
part-time employees to pick up a shift or two for coworkers or work a
double during peak season.
This flexibility allowed
employees to make more money and helped employers adjust to customer
flow.
Obamacare
shortened the full-time employment status , changing full-time
employment status from 40 hours to 30 hours a week.
This massive
legislation also mandated businesses to purchase health insurance for
their employees if they employ 50 full-time workers or more.
This change has left part-time workers with less available
income.
I
have heard from restaurants, hotels, golf courses, and vacation rental
companies about the problems the 30-hour rule is causing.
I was proud to vote last week in favor of H. R. 2575, the
Save
American Workers (SAW) Act , which would restore the 40-hour work
week.
The
Save American Workers Act
passed the
House of Representatives with a vote of
248-179.

Last week, the House Budget Committee
met to finalize our 2015 Path to Prosperity Budget plan.
Our
budget balances in ten years, cuts waste, and makes much-needed
reforms--saving American taxpayers $5.1 trillion.
