Eastern North Carolina Update with Congressman Walter B. Jones
WASHINGTON, D.C. - As we move forward in the month of March, I wanted
to take a moment to update you on some of my work for Eastern North
Carolina thus far in 2014.
On February 27, I had the privilege of receiving the Family Research
Council Action True Blue Award
for my
votes in support of pro-life and pro-family values.
So far in 2014, I
have been honored to be named an American Conservative Union "House
Conservative"
and
ranked the top member
of the North Carolina congressional delegation in
the fight against illegal immigration, earning an "A" grade from
NumbersUSA.
Voting Against Increasing the Debt Ceiling
In February, Congress once again voted to raise the debt ceiling
.
As
the only member of Congress to vote against every debt ceiling increase
in the last 10 years, I could not in good conscience support the
proposal, which did nothing to curb wasteful spending.
The national
debt has reached $17 trillion, yet we continue to spend money we do not
have and borrow billions of dollars from foreign governments - only to
funnel much of that borrowed money back overseas to various foreign aid
projects.
I will stand firm in my opposition to legislation that
allows the government to continue its reckless spending.
Fighting Obamacare
President Obama's takeover of our healthcare system has infringed on
our constitutional freedoms, including our freedom of religion.
To
combat this attack on our liberty, I've joined a bipartisan coalition
of 71 House members and 15 senators in filing an amicus curiae brief
in Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.
In
this case, the Supreme Court will hear a challenge to the mandate in
Obamacare that requires businesses to provide health insurance that
covers contraceptives - even if those contraceptives violate the
business owner's religious beliefs.
Our brief argues that business
owners should be protected from Obamacare's infringement on their First
Amendment rights by the bipartisan Religious Freedom Restoration Act of
1993, among other laws.
In addition to Obamacare's attack on religious freedom, the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office released a February report
estimating that the law will cause the loss of 2.5 million
full-time jobs over the next 10 years.
This is unaffordable, and I
will continue to fight to repeal this harmful law.
Reining in the Federal Government
The last thing Eastern North Carolina needs is unnecessary government
regulation stifling job creation and economic growth.
That's why I
introduced legislation
to repeal excessive restrictions on human
access to Cape Hatteras National Seashore Recreational Area.
I am
pleased to announce that the House of Representatives approved my
proposal on February 6, 2014.
I believe my provision strikes the
appropriate balance between protecting wildlife and protecting the
taxpayers' right to access the recreational areas they own.
You can
view my speech on the House floor regarding this legislation here
.
I encourage you to join me in calling on
the Senate to also approve my proposal.
The federal government has also overstepped its boundaries by
infringing on individual and states' rights.
Perhaps the most
egregious example of this can be found in the U.S. Department of
Education's practice of coercion and overreach into state education
systems by tying federal funding to the adoption of the Common Core
State Standards.
I've cosponsored
H. Res.
476, which denounces this practice and supports individual state
authority over academic standards and assessments - where this
authority rightfully belongs under the Tenth Amendment.
The federal government has further abused its power by allowing the
Internal Revenue Service to unfairly target tax-exempt organizations
based on their political affiliations.
I voted
in favor of H.R. 3865, legislation that would end this practice by
delaying a rule prohibiting tax-exempt organizations from engaging in
actions or speech that the Obama administration deems to fall under the
category of "candidate-related political activity."
I believe this
legislation is necessary to protect our First Amendment rights.
Defending Our Military
Just as today's retired service members have rightfully earned the
benefits they receive through years of selfless service, future service
members will also make incredible sacrifices for our country.
That's
why I will continue to work
for a
full repeal of cuts to the cost of living adjustment (COLA) for retired
members of our armed forces - both current and future.
The COLA
reduction, enacted by the Ryan-Murray budget - which I voted against -
remains in place for future enlistees.
We cannot break faith with our
men and women in uniform in this manner.
In addition to advocating for our future service members' benefits, I
believe the equipment that our future service members rely upon should
be maintained in top condition.
That's why I called on
Navy Secretary Ray Mabus to fund the F-35 Vertical Lift Fan Repair and
Test Facility at Craven County's Fleet Readiness Center (FRC) East.
Locating the maintenance and testing of the F-35 vertical lift fan at
FRC East would be the right decision for Eastern North Carolina, the
service members who will depend on the F-35's readiness, and the
taxpayers who are funding the aircraft's acquisition and maintenance.

Eastern

Update
with
Congressman
Walter

Jones
WASHINGTON,
D.C.
-
As
we
move
forward
in
the
month
of
March,
I
wanted
to
take
a
moment
to
update
you
on
some
of
my

for
Eastern

thus
far
in
2014.
On
February

I

I

Voting
Against
Increasing
the
Debt

In
February,
Congress
once
again
voted
to
raise
the
debt
ceiling .
As
the
only

of
Congress
to
vote
against
every

ceiling
increase
in
the
last
10
years,
I
could
not
in

the

which
did
nothing
to

The

has
reached
$17

yet
we
continue
to

money
we
do
not
have
and
borrow
billions
of

from
foreign

&#8211;
only
to
funnel
much
of
that
borrowed
money
back
overseas
to
various
foreign
aid
projects.
I
will
stand
firm
in
my
opposition
to
legislation
that
allows
the
government
to
continue
its
reckless
spending.
Fighting
Obamacare
President
Obama&#8217;s
takeover
of
our
healthcare
system
has
infringed
on
our
constitutional
freedoms,
including
our
freedom
of
religion.
To

this
attack
on

I&#8217;ve

In
this
case,
the
Supreme

will
hear
a

to
the
mandate
in
Obamacare
that
requires
businesses
to
provide
health
insurance
that
covers
contraceptives
&#8211;
even
if
those
contraceptives
violate
the
business
owner&#8217;s
religious
beliefs.
Our
brief
argues
that
business
owners
should
be
protected
from
Obamacare&#8217;s
infringement
on
their
First
Amendment
rights
by
the
bipartisan
Religious
Freedom
Restoration
Act
of
1993,
among
other
laws.
In
addition
to
Obamacare&#8217;s
attack
on

the
nonpartisan
Congressional
Budget

released
a
February
report
estimating
that
the
law
will
cause
the
loss
of
2.5
million
full-time
jobs
over
the
next
10
years.
This
is
unaffordable,
and
I
will
continue

I
am

6,
2014.
I
believe
my

strikes
the
appropriate
balance
between
protecting
wildlife
and
protecting
the
taxpayers&#8217;
right
to
access
the
recreational
areas
they

You
can
view
my
speech
on
the
House

regarding
this
legislation
here .
I
encourage
you
to
join
me
in
calling

The
federal

has
also
overstepped

by
infringing

Perhaps
the
most
egregious
example
of
this
can
be

in
the
U.S.

I

Defending
Our

Just
as
today&#8217;s
retired

have
rightfully

the

they
receive
through
years
of
selfless

future

That&#8217;s

the
cost
of

(COLA)

&#8211;
both
current

The
COLA
reduction,
enacted
by

-
which
I
voted

-
remains
in
place
for
future
enlistees.
We
cannot

In
addition
to
advocating

I
believe
the
equipment
that
our

should
be
maintained
in
top
condition.
That&#8217;s

I
called
