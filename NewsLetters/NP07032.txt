Retirement Planning Workshop
Dear Friend,
If you would like to learn more about retirement planning, please join me at my upcoming workshop designed to give San Diegans nearing retirement, or those just planning ahead, the tools to plan for the future.
I am bringing experts from the Department of Labor and the Social Security Administration for a hands-on program that will focus on simplified approaches to retirement, 401(k) plans, home equity and other assets, spending and expenses now and in retirement, filling the gap in your retirement savings, Medicare, when to start Social Security benefits, and disability, medical and death benefits.
I hope to see you there!
