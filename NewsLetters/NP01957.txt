Nancy Pelosi doesn&rsquo;t send you an email unless it&rsquo;s important. She knows it&rsquo;s critical that Cheri hits her goal for the first public fundraising deadline of the election -- on March 31st. That&rsquo;s why she called on you to step up, David. So far, it looks like you haven&rsquo;t had a chance to reply to Nancy&rsquo;s call-to-action yet:
David Johnson Answered Nancy Pelosi's Call-To-Action?
Not Yet!
The FEC fundraising deadline will be the first major public test for this campaign. Boehner is ready to pounce if we show even a hint of weakness when Cheri files her fundraising report.
If we fall short, we&rsquo;ll be making up for it for the rest of the campaign.
David -- we need your help. Please chip in now:
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
