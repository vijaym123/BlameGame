Strengthening
Virginia's Agriculture Industry
Dear Friend,
This past week on our
Agriculture
and Small Business Tour , I traveled
across the Fifth District making over 30
stops in Franklin, Bedford, Lunenburg,
Charlotte, Campbell, Fauquier, Madison,
Nelson, Pittsylvania, Charlottesville, and
Danville. I visited a variety of farming
operations including beef, dairy, grain,
berry, apple, and other crop producers. I
also met with small businesses that are end
users of crops produced by Fifth District
farmers including a juice company, a saw
mill, and small breweries. Additionally, I
met with the next generation of farmers by
visiting Ag classes and school greenhouses at
Randolph-Henry and Fauquier High Schools.
Agriculture is the backbone of our economy
in Virginia. Combined with forestry,
agriculture represents the largest segment of
Virginias economy, generating more
than $70 billion annually and accounting for
nearly 415,000 jobs across the Commonwealth.
Our nation owes much of its prosperity to its
deeply rooted history of agriculture, and we
continue to rely heavily on its significant
contributions to our economy and our country.
Preserving and fostering our great legacy of
family farming in Virginia is one of my top
priorities. After meeting with farmers from
Rocky Mount to Warrenton this past week, it
remains clear that the federal government is
often out of touch with the needs of our
family farmers and agribusinesses.
A prime example of this disconnect is
overzealous environmental regulation. Last
year, the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
proposed a rule that would unilaterally
expand the Clean Water Acts scope to
essentially any body of water
including ditches, culverts, and farmland
ponds. This unilateral decision by EPA
bureaucrats has significantly increased both
uncertainty and costs on our family farmers
while ignoring the fact that Congress is the
only institution with the authority to change
the law. Our nations farmers, and all
those involved in agriculture, invest
significantly in clean water to ensure the
sustainability of the environment, as it is
essential to their livelihood. This week, the
House is scheduled to consider
the
Regulatory Integrity Protection Act ,
which would force EPA and the Corps to
withdraw this harmful rule and to develop a
new proposed rule.
Many farmers, including the Bennett family
in Campbell County, expressed concern over
how
devastating the estate tax
can be to
family farmers who want to have their
children and grandchildren continue their
lifes work. Last month, the House
voted to repeal the death tax - a significant
step toward implementing a simpler, fairer
tax code and ensuring that our small
businesses can continue to create the jobs
Virginias Fifth District needs, and it
is my hope that the Senate takes up this vote
soon.
I also heard time and again this week how
the Presidents healthcare law is
continuing to impose high healthcare costs on
small agribusinesses, preventing them from
expanding as much as they could be. These
businesses are unable to hire more employees
because they are forced to pay outrageous
premiums. I have supported, and will continue
to support, a full repeal of the
Presidents job-killing healthcare law,
efforts to reduce its harmful effects on the
American people, and policies that actually
reduce the cost of health care.
I cannot help make the government more
responsive to the needs of agriculture
without hearing from our local growers and
producers, so I greatly appreciated the
opportunity to meet with
so
many hardworking Fifth District
Virginians
this past week. I look forward
to continuing to work with my colleagues to
put forth policies that support our robust
agriculture industry.

LUMI Juice, an up-and-coming small business
in Charlottesville that uses locally grown
fruits and vegetables to create cold pressed
organic juices, with its founder Hillary
Lewis.
Robert visited
Fauquier County High Schools
Agriculture Class and heard from students
about the skills they are developing through
hands-on learning.
