Dear Friend,
Exactly four years ago this week, I was proud to join President Obama
as he signed the Affordable Care Act into law. Since then, we've seen
many benefits come from the provisions of the law already enacted.
Though the website has certainly experienced its fair share of hiccups,
the great good of this law is hard to deny. But the March 31st deadline
for open enrollment in 2014 is now just one week away.
Millions of Americans are visiting www.HealthCare.gov
and signing up for health care plans that are affordable,
comprehensive, and give them peace of mind. No longer can a person be
denied coverage just because they have a preexisting condition.
Lifetime caps on coverage are now a thing of the past. Today, young
people can stay on their parents' insurance until age 26. These are
just some of the benefits we've already seen, and people are now just
one click or call away from the care they deserve.
If you haven't enrolled in a plan yet, visit www.HealthCare.gov
today, or call 1-800-318-2596 to speak with someone who can help
you find a plan that works at a price you can afford. The deadline for
open enrollment for 2014 is just one week from today. You can also join
me on Facebook
and Twitter
in reminding your friends and followers by using the
#GetCovered hashtag.
Throughout my decades of service, I've fought for access to affordable
care for all because I believe that it should be a right and not a
privilege. We cannot sit idly by while our families get sick and suffer
for want of health care, all while the insurance companies continue to
rake in profits. The Affordable Care Act is a huge step in the right
direction to achieving this goal, and I hope those of you who need
coverage will take the time to enroll before Monday the 31st.

John D. Dingell

Dear

Exactly
four
years

this
week,
I
was
proud
to
join
President

But
the
March
31st
deadline

just
