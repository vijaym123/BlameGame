Dear Friends,
As Israel continues
to defend itself against Hamas onslaught of rockets from Gaza, I
would like to inform you about my recent trip to Israel, from which I
returned on July 4th.
We all know the tragic events of the past
month, in which three Israeli teens
Eyal, Gilad and Naftali
were
abducted and murdered, as Israeli authorities confirmed, by Hamas
operatives. But when I arrived in Israel with Congressman Ted Deutch, we
still had hope that these boys were still alive. In fact, Ted and I had
scheduled a meeting with the families for the morning of Tuesday, July
1, the day before we heard the horrific news.
It was about 8
at night when I received word that the Israelis had found three
bodies near Hebron
not too far from where the boys had been abducted.
Israeli officials quickly confirmed the worst nightmares of an entire
nation
the bodies were those of Eyal, Gilad and Naftali. I cannot
express to you the sadness I felt for the boys, their mothers and their
families, and the people of Israel. Instead of meeting with the families
to offer hope and support, Ted and I attended the funeral for Eyal,
Gilad and Naftali, seemingly joined by an entire nation.
Prime
Minister Netanyahu made the announcement to the Israeli people, and he
promised them that the Hamas operatives who were behind this would be
brought to justice. What I saw was a nation in mourning, but also a
nation of resilience and pride that was unified as one trying to
console their brothers and sisters. As President Reagan once said, the
people of Israel and America are historic partners in the global quest for
human dignity and freedom. We will always remain at each others
side. A strong America is a strong Israel, and a strong Israel is a
strong America.
But right now Israel is under siege, having seen
over 600 rockets fired at innocent civilian populations by Hamas. That
is why the United States must continue to support Israels right to
defend itself.
And that is also why we must press the Obama
Administration to enforce U.S. law
including one that I had authored,
the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act
which clearly states that no U.S.
assistance can go to a Palestinian government that includes
Hamas.
Sincerely,
Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen
Member of
Congress
