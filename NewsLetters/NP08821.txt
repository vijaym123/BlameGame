Dear Friend,
I wanted to be sure you knew: tomorrow night I'm holding my very first
telephone town hall. It will be an opportunity for me talk with
constituents across the 4th District about the issues that matter most
to their families and communities. From climate change to immigration
reform, STEM education to economic development, this will be a chance
for you and I to discuss whatever's on your mind - without you having
to leave your home!
If you are a resident of the 4th District and want to join the town
hall, please email your name, phone number, and address to
Press.MA04@mail.house.gov. A member of our team will confirm your
participation.
Thanks again for all of your input over the past year and a half. Hope
to talk to you tomorrow!
Best,
Congressman Joe Kennedy
