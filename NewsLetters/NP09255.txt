Dear Friend -
If you are like me, you have become increasingly alarmed at recurring
headlines like these:
TIME: Veteran Affairs Probe Widens to 26 Medical Facilities
AP: Secret lists, deaths: Claims roil Veterans Affairs
WASHINGTON POST: Shinseki letter reveals VA's early efforts to explain
hospital's 'secret list'
WHAT I'M DOING
Amidst the troubling reports of the mistreatment of our veterans, the
House took an important first step towards bringing increased
accountability to the VA and ensuring our veterans get timely access to
quality healthcare and other services. The legislation, called the
Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act, gives
Secretary of Veterans Affairs General Eric Shinseki the tools to
address problems like the claims backlog and unacceptable wait times by
granting him the authority - which he currently does not have - to
remove an employee of the Senior Executive Service if the Secretary
determines that the employee's performance warrants removal.
I co-sponsored and supported this legislation which passed the House
by an overwhelming 390-33 bipartisan vote.
Unfortunately, the Senate is refusing to even debate this legislation
that brings immediate accountability to VA management.
As a veteran and an active Army Reservist, I have dedicated myself to
supporting Nevada's veteran community both through case work and
outreach locally and legislation introduced in Washington.
When first elected, I formed a veterans advisory panel to be my "eyes
and ears" on issues affecting Nevada veterans. I meet regularly with
this group and take their invaluable insights on what more we can do to
support our vets back to Washington. Those insights allow me to bring
the perspective of our local veterans to critical policy debates in
Congress.
NEXT STEPS
Right now the VA is facing difficult questions, serious accusations,
and has a great deal of work to do to win back public trust in the
management of its facilities. And rightly so. But now is a time for
solutions and problem solving, not blame casting and finger pointing.
Wrongs done at the VA will only be made right if everyone - from
General Shinseki to local veterans service organizations - commits to
bringing about meaningful change. I will continue to work with local
veterans and VA officials, as well as my colleagues in Congress, to
make sure that the House of Representatives is responsive to the needs
of those men and women who have made great sacrifices for our country.
But I could also use your help.
Are you or someone you know having
trouble with the Department of Veterans Affairs? If so, my office may
be able to help you. In addition, just hearing your story will help
guide my decisions in Washington. You can reach my office by calling
702-387-4941 or by sending me an email
. Our veterans gave us their best. Let's work together
to ensure they get the best from the VA in return.
Sincerely,
DR. JOE HECK
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend
-
If
you
are
like
me,
you
have
become
increasingly
alarmed
at
recurring
headlines
like
these:

'secret

WHAT
I'M
DOING
Amidst
the
troubling
reports
of
the
mistreatment
of
our
veterans,
the
House
took
an
important
first
step
towards
bringing
increased
accountability
to
the
VA
and
ensuring
our
veterans
get
timely
access
to
quality
healthcare
and
other
services.
The
legislation,
called
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
Management
Accountability
Act ,
gives
Secretary
of
Veterans
Affairs
General
Eric
Shinseki
the
tools
to
address
problems
like
the
claims
backlog
and
unacceptable
wait
times
by
granting
him
the
authority
-
which
he
currently
does
not
have
-
to
remove
an
employee
of
the
Senior
Executive
Service
if
the
Secretary
determines
that
the
employee&#8217;s
performance
warrants
removal.
I
co-sponsored
and
supported
this
legislation
which
passed
the
House
by
an
overwhelming
390-33
bipartisan
vote.
Unfortunately,
the
Senate
is
refusing
to
even
debate
this
legislation
that
brings
immediate
accountability
to
VA
management.
As
a
veteran
and
an
active
Army
Reservist,
I
have
dedicated
myself
to
supporting
Nevada&#8217;s
veteran
community
both
through
case
work
and
outreach
locally
and
legislation
introduced
in
Washington.
When
first
elected,
I
formed
a
veterans
advisory
panel
to
be
my
"eyes

on
issues
affecting
Nevada
veterans.
I
meet
regularly
with
this

and
take
their
invaluable

on
what
more
we
can

to

our

Washington.
Those
insights
allow
me
to
bring
the

of
our
local
veterans
to

policy
debates
in

NEXT
STEPS
Right
now
the
VA
is
facing
difficult
questions,
serious
accusations,
and
has
a
great
deal
of
work
to
do
to
win
back
public
trust
in
the
management
of
its
facilities.
And
rightly
so.
But
now
is
a
time
for
solutions
and
problem
solving,
not
blame
casting
and
finger
pointing.
Wrongs
done
at
the
VA
will
only
be
made
right
if
everyone
-
from
General
Shinseki
to
local
veterans
service
organizations
-
commits
to
bringing
about
meaningful
change.
I
will
continue
to
work
with
local
veterans
and
VA
officials,
as
well
as
my
colleagues
in
Congress,
to
make
sure
that
the
House
of
Representatives
is
responsive
to
the
needs
of
those
men
and
women
who
have
made
great
sacrifices
for
our
country.
But
I
could
also
use
your
help.
Are
you
or
someone
you
know
having
trouble
with
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs?
If
so,
my
office
may
be
able
to
help
you.
In
addition,
just
hearing
your
story
will
help
guide
my
decisions
in
Washington.
You
can
reach
my
office
by
calling
702-387-4941
or
by
sending
me
an
email .
Our
veterans
gave
us
their
best.
Let's
work
together
to
ensure
they
get
the
best
from
the
VA
in
return.
