Dear David,
JOBS &amp; THE
ECONOMY
I know the most important
issue to most of you, and your family, is the availability of quality
jobs and a stronger American economy. As your representative in Congress,
I couldnt agree more.
I will keep fighting to make sure
working families can still make the American Dream a reality. Here are some
of the economic issues I am focused on to help residents of the
9 th
Congressional District and all Americans:
Increasing the Minimum
Wage
I am a co-sponsor of H.R. 1010, which would increase
the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10
giving 25 million
Americans a raise and lifting 1 million Americans out of poverty.
Equal Pay for
Equal Work
I am co-sponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act.
Currently, in Illinois, women only make 77 cents (or less) for every
$1 men make. That hurts women, their families and our entire
economy.
Renewing Unemployment Insurance
If the House takes up the
bipartisan Senate Bill to renew Unemployment Insurance for the long-term
unemployed, 153,400 Illinoisans would benefit and there would be $300
million boost to our state economy.
For all three of these measures I have signed what is called a
discharge petition to try to make sure that we get to debate them
this year.
If 218 members of the House of Representatives sign the
petition, we are guaranteed a vote.
At this point, more than190
members have signed each of the petitions; click the following to
learn more:

EARTH DAY
Yesterday, Earth Day, was a reminder to think about the importance and
value of the natural environment around us, but it was also a reminder
to commit to action. Now, more than ever before, we need to recognize
the opportunity that we have to protect our planet from the growing
threat of climate change and promote alternative energy sources that
will drive our economy into the future.

REAR VISIBILITY RULE
WILL SAVE LIVES
Starting in 2018, the Department of Transportation will implement a rear
visibility rule for vehicles made that year and beyond. I was the lead
sponsor of the bipartisan legislation calling for this rule. The
legislation, the Cameron Gulbransen Kids Transportation Safety Act, was
signed by President George W. Bush in 2008. It is named for Cameron
Gulbransen, a two year old, who died when his father accidently backed over
him while parking his SUV. On average, two children every week are
killed as a result of backover accidents. Families and other advocates
came to Washington to push this legislation and I am thankful for their
efforts. This is a big victory for consumers and it will save
lives.
SUCCESS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE
ACT

Numbers

Americans

health insurance
marketplace
35%

through Get Covered Illinois: 114,000 through the marketplace and 199,000
