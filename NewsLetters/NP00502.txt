Memorial Day
Following the conclusion of the Civil War in 1865, Union veteran leaders established an annual Decoration Day to commemorate the fallen Union and Confederate soldiers. In the years since, Decoration Day has expanded to honor all fallen soldiers from every theater of war, and we now know it as Memorial Day.
This Memorial Day we honor the Ohioans who have laid down their lives for their country in every conflict from the War of 1812 through the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have a sacred duty to carry on their stories and preserve the memories of their heroism.
To remember those who have served our nation in uniform and made the ultimate sacrifice for our country, the
Ohio Western Reserve National Cemetery
in Rittman will hold a ceremony on May 24 at 3:00 p.m., and on May 25 at 11:00 a.m. the
Dayton National Cemetery
will hold a ceremony.
As we pause to remember those who have fought to preserve the rights we hold dear, we must also stand up for their survivors. U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) is committed to serving our nation's military families and veterans.
As we observe Memorial Day, the Library of Congress continues to seek submissions for its Veterans History Project, which collects, preserves, and presents the stories of American veterans for future generations. If you would like to learn more about the project, you may visit the project&rsquo;s website

As the only Ohio Senator to serve a full term on the Senate Committee on Veterans&rsquo; Affairs, the welfare of Ohio&rsquo;s military members and veterans is an important issue for Sen. Brown. If you are a veteran or family member in need of assistance,
