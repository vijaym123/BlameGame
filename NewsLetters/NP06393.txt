Protecting your
Healthcare
On
Thursday, my
Employee Health Care Protection
Act
was passed by the House.
This bill would allow American
workers to keep their employer-sponsored health
insurance.
Obamacare's employer mandate will cause millions of Americans to lose
their health insurance.
The President should keep his promise to
American workers, and if they like their healthcare plan they should
be allowed to keep it.
Defending America
Last Wednesday, the President outlined his plan to defeat ISIL
terrorists in Iraq and Syria.
Our response must be
forceful, sustained and relentless.
ISIL must be destroyed and the
Presidents strategy will be judged against this
standard.
Preventing Government
Waste
Finally,
I
introduced a resolution
which would require Members of Congress to report
when Congressional funds are used for private chartered
planes.
Washingtons spending is out of control and taxpayer-funded
charter flights are one of the reasons why.
Ensuring that Washington
is transparent and our tax dollars are spent wisely remains one of my
priorities.
