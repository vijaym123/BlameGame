Quad-City Times: Boehner to campaign with Bobby Schilling
In less than FOUR days, Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s coming to Colona to headline a massive fundraiser for Cheri&rsquo;s opponent.
Every dollar he raises will go straight towards nasty ads targeting Cheri. If we don&rsquo;t respond, all that cash could devastate our Illinois campaign.
David, will you rush an urgent donation to Cheri to help us prepare for the onslaught of right-wing attacks?

Boehner&rsquo;s
desperate
to bring ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling back to Congress. He knows he can count on him to be a rubber stamp for his Tea Party agenda.
We can&rsquo;t let that happen.
So please, dig deep for Cheri: http://action.cheribustos.com/Beat-Boehner
