Dear Friends,
From our nation&rsquo;s budget to healthcare, debate continues in Congress. You deserve to know how decisions in Washington impact you.
That&rsquo;s why I will be hosting a Community Forum in East Granby. There I will take your questions and discuss a number of issues, including the recently
proposed budget by House Republicans
that stands to cut vital services to youth, students, seniors and our most vulnerable populations.
Upcoming Event
Community Forum in East Granby
Tuesday, April 15th, 5:30PM &ndash; 7:30PM
East Granby Community Center
20 Center Street, East Granby, CT 06026
