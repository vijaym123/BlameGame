December 14, 2014
Friends,
Late Thursday evening, after a
dramatic day,
the House of Representatives passed a $1.1
trillion spending package, referred to as the CRomnibus , on a
219-206 vote. This massive bill funds the federal government until
September and did nothing to address the Presidents immigration executive
action.
I received hundreds of calls last week urging me to vote no
for this legislation, and I would like to thank everyone that took
the time to call.
President Obamas immigration
executive action was a direct affront to voters and runs counter to our
nations rule of law.
Congress should not allow for any President to
ignore the Constitution and his oath of office without consequence. On
Monday, I joined 65 of my colleagues in offering an amendment to the
CRomnibus spending bill that removes all funding from programs
affected by the Presidents immigration directive. This amendment was voted
down by the House Rules Committee and not included in the final
spending bill.
Since our amendment was not adopted, this
CRomnibus did little to stop the President from circumventing his oath of
office.
As such, I voted against the
CRomnibus.

Unfortunately scams seem to spike this time of year because people are
desperate and also because people are spending more money.
OATH Resolution Introduced
Our
country is great today because
of
legal
immigration.
In fact,
our Founding Fathers bestowed the critical
responsibility of crafting our immigration laws upon
Congress
in Article I, Section 8, Clause 4 of the Constitution. For more
than two centuries, Congress has modified our immigration system to
meet the needs of our country. Today, most Americans agree that Congress
needs to modernize our countrys immigration laws again so they are
fair for workers, students, families, and businesses.
However,
Congress must restructure these laws, not the President or his
Administration.
Since President Obama announced he will defer
deportations for millions of illegal immigrants and unilaterally change our
immigration laws, I have explored ways to stop the Obama Administration
from bypassing Congress
again .
On
Monday,
I introduced a resolution that directs the House of
Representatives to authorize legal action against the Obama Administration for
implementing unilateral changes to our immigration
laws.
The Uphold the Oath Americans Trust and Honor (OATH)
Resolution,
H. Res. 772 , will restore
legislative order and force the President to govern within his
authority.
Questioning
Gruber
When President Obama, the White House, and Congressional Democrats
were crafting the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, they hired
consultants from the private sector to help them write the bill.
One
consultant, MIT Professor Jonathan Gruber, was paid nearly
half a million taxpayer dollars
for his
expertise and consultation services.
In recent weeks, videos have
surfaced of Professor Gruber stating that Obamacare is a deceptive law
with disguised taxes, and he purposefully wrote the law in a tortuous
manner so it would not receive a high price tag from the
Congressional Budget Office.
He then said the only reason the law
passed is because American voters are stupid.
Needless to say, this
caused outrage and backlash from voters and Congress.
Professor Gruber testified before the House Oversight Committee last
week and I had the opportunity to question him.

Stop 22 A Day
A 2012 report from the Department of Veterans Affairs revealed an
average of 18 to 22 veterans have committed suicide each day for more than
a decade, making suicide the number one issue facing post-9/11
veterans.
When I was meeting with Seventh District veterans in
October, I spoke with members of the Ladies Auxiliary Group at VFW Post 10804
in Little River.
The ladies expressed their concern over this
upsetting trend and requested that Congress do something to improve
mental health care for our veterans.
I am glad to let the
Ladies Auxiliary Group and you know that the House passed the Clay Hunt
Suicide Prevention for American Veterans (SAV) Act.
This bill was named after Clay Hunt, a marine that committed suicide
after returning from Afghanistan. The Clay Hunt (SAV)
Act improves suicide prevention programs and directs the VA to hire more mental
health physicians.
I encourage you to learn more about Clay
Hunt and this legislation

It is an honor and privilege to
represent you and your family.
Have a
good week,
