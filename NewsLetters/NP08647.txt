&ldquo;The spending levels from out-of-state Republican groups have already surpassed what Mitt Romney&rsquo;s campaign spent on ads during the entire 2012 New Hampshire primary.&rdquo;

Dear Friend, Outside spending -- in New Hampshire and around the country -- is at historic levels, and it could easily come our way next.
Bay Staters are feeling the effects of the unprecedented outside spending just to our north. And since Boston-based TV stations serve southern New Hampshire, many of us are seeing the ads, too. With so much outside money sloshing around, we have to make sure our grassroots campaign is prepared for some of it to land here. Can you help us get $5 closer to our $36,000 goal before this month&rsquo;s FEC filing deadline?

The Koch brothers, Karl Rove, and special interest groups who are trying to influence our elections can change a race in a heartbeat. They have hundreds of millions of dollars to spend, and they&rsquo;re not shy about throwing their weight around. Their goal is to knock people like me out of the Senate so they can force through their anti-middle class agenda.
But I&rsquo;ve got something they don&rsquo;t -- a team of grassroots supporters who can stand up to anything. We&rsquo;re halfway through the month, and we need a strong finish to the FEC fundraising quarter. Please give $5 or whatever you can to help us keep fighting.
Thanks for your help.
