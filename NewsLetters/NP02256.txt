Rep. Veaseys Statement on Naming of City of Fort Worth as Pilot Site for Federal Community Policing Program
Washington, D.C.
Congressman Marc Veasey, TX-33, member of the Congressional Black Caucus, released the following statement in response to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holders recent announcement that Fort Worth will be one of six pilot sites for the National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice, a
nationwide program designed to enhance procedural justice, reduce bias and support reconciliation:
Today more than ever, we must work together to reform our justice and law enforcement policies so that we may improve law enforcements relationship with the community and ensure we prevent the next Ferguson.
That is why I applaud the Department of Justice for launching the
National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice
pilot program in Fort Worth, in the 33 rd
Congressional District. When I co-hosted a Community Policing Summit this past January, participants made clear that we must have the communitys support and trust to be successful. I look forward to working with the Department of Justice to ensure that the Fort Worth community is active and involved in their efforts.
It is my hope during this critical time that we come together as a community and as a nation to work towards responsible solutions that serve everyones goal of a safe community.
