June 01, 2014
Friends,
After
two days of debate, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 4660, the
Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations
Act, 2015 , by a vote of 321-87.
This legislation outlines the
funding for the Department of Commerce, Department of Justice,
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Science
Foundation, and related agencies.
Due to the size and scope of
this bill, it rightfully attracted numerous amendments.
I
am glad to inform you that many of the amendments we passed cut
unnecessary government spending and ensure taxpayer dollars fund programs
that benefit them, not partisan agendas.
I would like to
highlight some of the amendments I
supported:
Rep. Steve King (R-IA) Amendment -
Curtails President Obamas prosecutorial discretion with illegal
immigration.
Rep. Jim Bridenstine
(R-OK) Amendment - Allocates $12 million to improve the
prediction of high impact weather events like hurricanes and
tornadoes.
Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC)
Amendment - Prohibits the Obama Administration from trying to
address climate change through trade agreements by barring funds for
trade agreements that establish a limit on greenhouse gas
emissions.
Overall, H.R. 4660,
the
Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act,
2015 , eliminates 33 programs, resulting in savings of more than $250
million.
Additionally, this bill spends nearly $400
million less than what we spent last year to fund these programs and
agencies.
New
Caucus A Win For Economy
On Thursday, I
joined three of my colleagues in launching the bipartisan Middle Market
Growth Caucus.
The middle market represents only three percent of
American businesses yet employs more than 44 million workers and
generates $10 trillion in combined revenues annually. We created our caucus
to educate our colleagues about the significant contributions of the
middle market and the vital role it plays in the U.S. economy. Read

VA Secretary Eric Shinseki
Resigns
While I appreciate
Secretary Shinsekis resignation, it does not resolve the lack of
accountability and inefficiency plaguing the Department of Veterans
Affairs.
This resignation resolves a political crisis for the
President.
Secretary Shinsekis resignation should be coupled with a
plan from the President and his Administration on how they intend on
overseeing the Department of Veterans Affairs and immediately addressing
the deadly wait times our war heroes are facing.
Our President is
ultimately the top executive of every government agency and our
veterans need to see action, not a pile of resignation forms and wait
slips.
Mr. President, we are anxiously awaiting your plan of
action.
70th Anniversary of
D-Day
This Friday marks 70 years since
160,000 Allied troops landed on the beaches of Normandy to fight Nazi
Germany.
By the end of the day, the soldiers gained control of
Normandy at a great loss.
More than 9,000 soldiers were killed or
wounded in the invasion.
After the D-Day invasion, more than
100,000 Allied troops began the march across Europe to defeat Hitler.
The world will never forget the sacrifices our soldiers made that
day.
To commemorate D-Day, here are some iconic images of the
invasion of Normandy, courtesy of the National
Archives:

building resources on the beachhead.
Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower speaks to 101st Airborne
Division
General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of the Allied
Expeditionary Force, speaks with Lieutenant Wallace C. Strobel, a
paratrooper in the 101st Airborne Division, at Greenham Common airfield on
the evening of June 5, 1944. Shortly after General Eisenhowers visit,
the men of the 101st Airborne Division boarded C-47 troop transports
and departed for Normandy.
Pointe du
Hoc
A US helmet sits atop a
captured German machine gun, marking the location at Pointe du Hoc of
fallen comrades, casualties of June 6. Although there is no official
figure, Allied casualties on June 6, 1944, are estimated at 10,000. The
number of Axis casualties is estimated between 4,000 and 9,000
men.
May we never forget these images and the sacrifices
our troops made for our freedom and for the freedom of millions across
the world.
God Bless Our Troops

U.S.A.
