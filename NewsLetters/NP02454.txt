Friend,
Today is Ami&rsquo;s birthday, and this week he&#39;s been receiving many cards in the mail.
We can assure you-- he&#39;s having a great birthday.
But this is our chance to make it his best celebration yet.
Tonight, we&#39;re going to send Ami the list of supporters who have chipped in for his birthday.
Can we send him 50 names for his 50th birthday?
We&#39;re close-- we only need 30 people to pitch in today.
Will you help us reach 50 supporters by midnight?
Chip in $5, $50 or any amount right now by clicking here.
Tomorrow will be too late-- help us celebrate Ami&#39;s 50th birthday with a small gift today.
Thanks for making this a memorable day!
Team Bera
P.S.
Will you be one of the 30 folks to dig deep and give a few dollars today?
