With USS New York Arrival, Navy Underscores Commitment to First Coast
as Anchor to National Security
With open arms, the First Coast today (12/6) welcomed the newest member
of the Navy family to the region - the USS New York. What an honor to
sail in to Naval Station Mayport this morning aboard this floating
tribute to freedom - the first of the three Naval Amphibious Readiness
Group ships that will homeport at the base.
The story will repeat itself again next year when the USS Iwo Jima, an
amphibious assault ship, and the USS Fort McHenry, a dock landing ship,
make the move to Mayport, according to the Navy. Along with local and
state representatives, Senator Bill Nelson, and Admiral William R.
Gortney, Commander, United States Fleet Forces, I joined in addressing
a large gathering during the New York's official arrival ceremony.
I thought you would be interested in reading the full text of my
statement regarding the meaning of this homeporting and others that are
scheduled in coming years.
"Looking around us, I think we can all agree that the First Coast is an
anchor to our national security. Today, the Navy underscores its
commitment to that mission with the arrival of this vessel - the USS
New York - the first of three Naval Amphibious Readiness Group ships
that will call Naval Station Mayport home.
"We welcome the USS New York and her crew of 360 with open arms. They
and their families will become a part of our community fabric.
And
while she is docked at these piers, our region's dedicated and
hard-working ship repair industrial base will keep her at the ready to
answer our nation's call.
"By 2014, the USS Iwo Jima and the USS Fort Mc Henry will join her in a
transition that will ultimately bring 3,000 sailors and their families
to Mayport and put this group of ships in a position to perform a wide
array of operations from humanitarian relief to providing combat-tested
Marines to the world's next hot spot wherever and whenever needed at
home and around the globe.
"Let us never forget that the men and women in uniform you see around
you are the heroes here. Living the Navy core values of honor, courage,
and commitment, they selflessly dedicate themselves to protecting us
every single day. They are as strong as the steel on these decks and I
am humbled to be with them today.
"We, as a nation, face difficult economic times - a reality that all
branches of our military are well aware of. As a member of the Defense
Appropriations Committee, my commitment to them, to this and ALL
military bases, and to the men and women who serve them stands
unwavering. I will not allow short-sighted budget decisions to turn
back a decade's worth of work rebuilding our military.
"I stand here with my friend Bill Nelson, and we are committed to
putting national security and the safety and protection of our nation
above the partisan bickering in Washington to get a common-sense budget
deal that will allow us to turn back the devastating cuts of
sequestration.
"We have already seen steep declines in the readiness of our forces
because of these cuts.
Make no mistake, ALL of these gains Senator
Nelson and I have fought so long for here at Mayport - our new ARG and
the littoral combat ships set to arrive in 2016 - will be AT RISK if we
do not work together.
That is not only a loss to our community, but it
will be an even greater loss to our nation.
"I am committed to forging a way forward that will bring stability to
our defense budget and I will work hard to convince my colleagues in
Washington that is the ONLY option to keep our nation safe and strong.
"Again, welcome all to the Mayport family!"

With
USS
New
York
Arrival,
Navy
Underscores
Commitment
to
First
Coast
as
Anchor
to
National
Security
With
open
arms,
the
First
Coast
today
(12/6)
welcomed
the
newest
member
of
the
Navy
family
to
the
region
-
the
USS
New
York.
What
an
honor
to
sail
in
to
Naval
Station
Mayport
this
morning
aboard
this
floating
tribute
to
freedom
&#8211;
the
first
of
the
three
Naval
Amphibious
Readiness
Group
ships
that
will
homeport
at
the
base.
The
story
will
repeat
itself
again
next
year
when
the
USS
Iwo
Jima,
an
amphibious
assault
ship,
and
the
USS
Fort
McHenry,
a
dock
landing
ship,
make
the
move
to
Mayport,
according
to
the
Navy.
Along
with
local
and
state
representatives,
Senator
Bill
Nelson,
and
Admiral
William
R.
Gortney,
Commander,
United
States
Fleet
Forces,
I
joined
in
addressing
a
large
gathering
during
the
New
York&#8217;s
official
arrival
ceremony.
I
thought
you
would
be
interested
in
reading
the
full
text
of
my
statement
regarding
the
meaning
of
this
homeporting
and
others
that
are
scheduled
in
coming
years.
"Looking
around
us,
I
think
we
can
all
agree
that
the
First
Coast
is
an
anchor
to
our
national
security.
Today,
the
Navy
underscores
its
commitment
to
that
mission
with
the
arrival
of
this
vessel
-
the
USS
New
York
-
the
first
of
three
Naval
Amphibious
Readiness
Group
ships
that
will
call
Naval
Station
Mayport
home.
&#8220;We
welcome
the
USS
New
York
and
her
crew
of
360
with
open
arms.
They
and
their
families
will
become
a
part
of
our
community
fabric.
And
while
she
is
docked
at
these
piers,
our
region&#8217;s
dedicated
and
hard-working
ship
repair
industrial
base
will
keep
her
at
the
ready
to
answer
our
nation&#8217;s
call.
&#8220;By
2014,
the
USS
Iwo
Jima
and
the
USS
Fort
Mc
Henry
will
join
her
in
a
transition
that
will
ultimately
bring
3,000
sailors
and
their
families
to
Mayport
and
put
this
group
of
ships
in
a
position
to
perform
a
wide
array
of
operations
from
humanitarian
relief
to
providing
combat-tested
Marines
to
the
world&#8217;s
next
hot
spot
wherever
and
whenever
needed
at
home
and
around
the
globe.
&#8220;Let
us
never
forget
that
the
men
and
women
in
uniform
you
see
around
you
are
the
heroes
here.
Living
the
Navy
core
values
of
honor,
courage,
and
commitment,
they
selflessly
dedicate
themselves
to
protecting
us
every
single
day.
They
are
as
strong
as
the
steel
on
these
decks
and
I
am
humbled
to
be
with
them
today.
&#8220;We,
as
a
nation,
face
difficult
economic
times
&#8211;
a
reality
that
all
branches
of
our
military
are
well
aware
of.
As
a
member
of
the
Defense
Appropriations
Committee,
my
commitment
to
them,
to
this
and
ALL
military
bases,
and
to
the
men
and
women
who
serve
them
stands
unwavering.
I
will
not
allow
short-sighted
budget
decisions
to
turn
back
a
decade&#8217;s
worth
of
work
rebuilding
our
military.
&#8220;I
stand
here
with
my
friend
Bill
Nelson,
and
we
are
committed
to
putting
national
security
and
the
safety
and
protection
of
our
nation
above
the
partisan
bickering
in
Washington
to
get
a
common-sense
budget
deal
that
will
allow
us
to
turn
back
the
devastating
cuts
of
sequestration.
&#8220;We
have
already
seen
steep
declines
in
the
readiness
of
our
forces
because
of
these
cuts.
Make
no
mistake,
ALL
of
these
gains
Senator
Nelson
and
I
have
fought
so
long
for
here
at
Mayport
-
our
new
ARG
and
the
littoral
combat
ships
set
to
arrive
in
2016
-
will
be
AT
RISK
if
we
do
not
work
together.
That
is
not
only
a
loss
to
our
community,
but
it
will
be
an
even
greater
loss
to
our
nation.
&#8220;I
am
committed
to
forging
a
way
forward
that
will
bring
stability
to
our
defense
budget
and
I
will
work
hard
to
convince
my
colleagues
in
Washington
that
is
the
ONLY
option
to
keep
our
nation
safe
and
strong.
&#8220;Again,
welcome
all
to
the
Mayport
family!&#8221;
