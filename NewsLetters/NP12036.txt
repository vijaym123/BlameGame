Kansas Chamber
of Commerce Annual Event
I enjoyed having the privilege
to be the Master of Ceremonies at the
Kansas Chamber of Commerce
annual event last
week in Topeka. Each year, members of the business community and state
leaders from both sides of the political aisle come together to
recognize and celebrate small businesses and community efforts to make Kansas
a great place to work, do business and raise a family. This year, more
than 1,000 people attended to hear economist and comedian Ben Stein
speak as the special
guest.
Congratulations to
Landoll
Corp ., a global agriculture, transportation and handling
equipment manufacturing business founded in Marysville, KS that employs more
than 500 employees worldwide, for receiving the
Kansas Chamber's 2014 Ad Astra Award ,
an honor presented to one business each year that exemplifies both
business and civic excellence within the
state.
Thank you to the many business leaders in
Kansas for their efforts to promote job creation and economic
growth.
I enjoyed the
opportunity to be the Master of Ceremonies and to visit with so many
business and community leaders once again.

Working to Check
an Abusive IRS
Most Americans remember and were shocked
by the news last year that the
IRS engaged in targeting Americans based on their political
beliefs and affiliations.
We watched as IRS and
administration officials were questioned before Congress, and rightly so. I
strongly believe no American should be targeted by the IRS based on any
political beliefs.
That is why I am
cosponsoring
H.R. 3865 -
the Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act of
2013 . The STOP Act would make certain that any employee of the Internal
Revenue Service who takes certain official actions for political
purposes, such as targeting groups or individuals based on beliefs or
political affiliation, would be terminated for their actions.

about this legislation.
Many
constituents contacted my office to voice their outrage at these
developments. They were concerned about intrusive and unnecessary audits and more
examples of an overreaching federal government. Many questions still
need to be answered, but this legislation is one more check and I'm
proud to cosponsor this bill.
Last year, I took the
lead and offered an appropriations amendment that passed out of
Financial Services Subcommittee to ensure the IRS would no longer target
Americans based on political beliefs. That was a first step. I will
continue to work on this issue on behalf of Kansans in the 3rd District.

Visiting Shawnee Mission South High School
It is always
energizing to start one of my days by speaking with high school
students. Last week I had the opportunity to visit students at
Shawnee Mission South High
School
in Overland Park. These smart students were engaged and had
great questions for me about current issues facing
Congress.
These bright students were interested
in the cost of attending college, innovation and the economy, as well
as many other important topics to a younger generation of
Americans.
Thank you for inviting me
to speak with you. Nothing Greater than a
Raider!
"Stop Government Abuse" Week
This week, the
House returns to the Washington after the District Work Week and will
focus on several bills in the House to push back against an overreaching
and abusive federal government. The House will debate several bills
that aim to increase personal and economic freedoms, as well as increase
transparency and accountability in
government.
Some of the bills the House will debate include
providing more awareness to the public regarding Federal unfunded mandates,
offering more disclosure on how the government purchases IT products
and services, requiring federal agencies to report to the public how
effective its programs are, denying federal funds to local and state
agencies that abuse eminent domain, as well as many
others.
You can view the House calendar on the side bar
of this newsletter.

Community Bankers Roundtable
Last week I sat down with a group
of community bankers in Overland Park. I appreciated their advice and
counsel regarding regulations coming out of Washington, our local and
national economic situation, and how we can best create a climate to
foster job growth in this still soft
economy.
Thank you to Federal Home Loan Bank of Topeka for
organizing the discussion.
John Deere Employee
Town Hall
I had the opportunity to visit the
John Deere Ag Marketing
facility in Olathe last week. The John
Deere Ag
Sales &amp;
Marketing Center
houses more than 400 employees who
provide support and service to John Deere branches around the world. I
held an employee town hall and had a good discussion about major issues
facing our country; including health care reform, broadband access to
rural areas, international trade, the national debt, Kansas
agribusiness and more.
I'm not only
concerned about our economy and getting more Kansans back to work. As
Vice Chair of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, I'm also
deeply concerned about our Kansas agriculture community as
well.
Overland Park Office Hours
I enjoyed
meeting with Ron Dover of
Overland Park with Parkinson's Action Network
during
office hours last week to discuss efforts to find a cure for the more
than one million Americans living with Parkinsons
disease.
As a member of
the
Congressional Caucus on Parkinsons Disease , I will continue to work
with my colleagues to increase research efforts at the federal level and
ensure Medicare patients receive the therapy they need to maintain
quality of life and independence.
Kansas
Automobile Dealers Association Conference
Last week I
addressed the
Kansas Automobile
Dealers Association
Conference. Thank you to these job
creators for their input and advice about how Washington can best create a
climate for job growth and economic recovery at home in
Kansas.
I appreciated the opportunity
to speak with you last week. Auto dealerships are a large part of the
local economy in many of our Kansas
communities.
Fact of the
Week
February isn't just important for hearts because of Valentine's Day.
