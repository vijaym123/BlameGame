Dear Friend,
The House was back in session this week and while I'd prefer the
Arizona sun to the humid D.C. climate, there was much work to be done
in our nation's capitol. Arizona has recently been in the spotlight for
multiple issues making national news so I want to thank all of the
engaged constituents who have contacted my office with your
perspectives. I count on you to be my eyes and ears on these critical
issues affecting our state.
House Acts to Quickly Help Clear VA Backlog
I have heard from an overwhelming number of veterans over the past
month about immediate changes needed with the VA. The message I am
hearing loud and clear is this:
"Let us get the care we want, where we want it!"
I could not agree more, and our veterans have earned the highest level
of medical care available. I have long believed that patient choice and
competition would have in part prevented many of the problems with the
VA. Veterans should have the right to choose their doctors. Choice
brings out competition and competition would have, at least in part,
reduced or eliminated delays as doctors competed for veteran business.
We have learned that there are thousands of veterans who need medical
help right now. That is why this week the House of Representatives
passed the Veterans Access to Care Act (H.R. 4810)
of which I am a
cosponsor. In an incredible act of bipartisanship, the vote for this
bill was unanimously supported by all members of Congress, Republican
and Democrat. This bill allows veterans who have been waiting for care
access private non-Department medical facilities across the country.
This legislation comes after shocking results from a nationwide audit
of veteran's access to care. In the report released on Monday, the
Inspector General of the VA reported he discovered premeditated
corruption was rampant amongst high-level supervisors within the
Department. In many facilities, VA staff said they felt threatened and
coerced to submit false data, while whistleblowers were disciplined for
not complying with this unethical cover up. It is difficult to imagine
anyone working for the VA believing that these actions were morally or
legally acceptable. I spoke about these issues on C-SPAN's Washington
Journal this past Wednesday. You can watch the video HERE

Upholding our Immigration Laws
This week brought us more information on the lawlessness of the
administration and Attorney General Eric Holder in regards to illegally
transporting immigrants to Arizona cities. The administration continues
to use taxpayer dollars to transport and house detained illegal
immigrants flooding across our porous southern border. I am encouraged
to see this egregious violation of the rule of law receive more
national attention from major news outlets. Pictures of illegal
immigrants being released into the public at bus stops as well as
inhumane, overcrowded detention facilities are being broadcasted on the
nightly news. The only way we can make our elected leaders uphold the
rule of law is if the people of this nation are engaged in the issue
and hold them accountable.

Many of you who follow my actions in Congress know that I introduced
H.RES.35
at the beginning
of the 113th Congress, which expresses no confidence in the Attorney
General and calls for his immediate resignation. It is time that the
members of the House and Senate let the public know with their votes,
whether or not they support an Attorney General who chooses not to
enforce the laws our nation. Additionally, this week I signed on as a
cosponsor of H.RES.411
which calls for
the impeachment of Eric Holder for his failure to enforce the laws of
our nation. I went on the Laura Ingraham show this past Tuesday and
discussed this issue in more detail. You can listen to the audio of
that interview HERE
.
I will continue to push my colleagues in the House to take up a full
investigation of the actions by multiple government agencies who are
participating in this alien smuggling. On Friday, I called for the
Administration to immediately terminate their flawed alien smuggling
policy, respond to pointed questions about the operations, secure the
border and stop giving amnesty to illegal aliens. Read more HERE
But I need your help. I need you to speak up and continue to contact
your elected members of government and tell them that the foundation of
our country begins to crumble when our President and Attorney General
decide to pick and choose which laws they want to enforce. The
integrity of our Constitutional Republic is at stake.
Four Amendments Passed This Week Targeting Spending
This week, the House continued the annual process of appropriating
federal funds to various government agencies and departments.
Throughout my entire career in Congress, I have focused on cutting
waste, fraud and abuse out of the federal government budget. I
successfully passed four amendments to two separate appropriation
bills. The amendments will limit the size and scope of The Department
of House and Urban Development (THUD) and the Department of Agriculture.
Amendment 1: "Stop Obama's Assault on the Suburbs
". This amendment prevents the federal government from using funds to
socially engineer our neighborhoods. The Department of Housing and
Urban Development (THUD) was attempting to create a thinly veiled set
of rules and regulations which would force communities to conform to
the utopian dreams of an ideological administration or face losing out
on billions of dollars in grant money. I spoke about this amendment on
Tuesday in an interview with Fox Business Network. You can watch that
interview HERE
.
(image via www.foxbusiness.com
)
Amendment 2: This amendment prohibits funds for the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration's National Roadside Survey: This
worthless road survey amounts to an invasion of privacy, a violation of
the Fourth Amendment, and a dereliction of duty to protect the public.
Last year's survey squandered almost $8 million dollars of taxpayer
money and did nothing to make our communities safer. Read more HERE
.
Amendment 3: This amendment cut funds from the wasteful and inefficient
Office of the Chief Financial Officer at USDA and redirected those
resources to the Department's Office of Inspector General to meet the
budget request. This measure will ensure the IG has the resources to
crack down on the widespread waste, fraud, and abuse within USDA. Read
more HERE
.
Amendment 4: My final amendment that passed this week cut $2.1 million
in spending that Obama wanted to use to hire more government attorneys,
many of which will be used to implement and defend the Administration's
overreaching land grabs, water grabs, and climate change policies. I
simply cannot, in good conscience, support funding to hire new
government bureaucrats that will impose more overreaching federal
regulations and infringe upon Arizona's Tenth Amendment right. Read
more HERE
.
So far this year I have successfully passed a dozen amendments that
have scaled back excessive government spending and fought federal
overreach. Every week I receive hundreds of emails and calls from
Arizonans telling me about some of the bloated government horror
stories that they read in the news. Even with a 17.5 TRILLION DOLLAR
NATIONAL DEBT
, our government still cannot seem to recognize
that we have a spending problem. These amendments are one way that we
can fight back against an out of control government and I plan to
continue listening to your comments and taking action.
Government Waste - Fact of the Week:
$35 million
was reportedly paid out by Medicare to 118
"phantom" medical clinics that never even existed.
Apparently these
"phantom" medical clinics were established by a network of criminal
gangs as a way to defraud the U.S. government.
Congressional District 4: Did You Know?
The hottest day in the history of Arizona was recorded on August 11,
1983 at 2:21 p.m. was 132 F. - recorded in the shade at the Bullhead
City Fire Department.

Dear
Friend,
The
House
was
back
in
session
this
week
and
while
I&#8217;d
prefer
the
Arizona
sun
to
the
humid
D.C.
climate,
there
was
much
work
to
be
done
in
our
nation&#8217;s
capitol.
Arizona
has
recently
been
in
the
spotlight
for
multiple
issues
making
national
news
so
I
want
to
thank
all
of
the
engaged
constituents
who
have
contacted
my
office
with
your
perspectives.
I
count
on
you
to
be
my
eyes
and
ears
on
these
critical
issues
affecting
our
state.
House
Acts
to
Quickly
Help
Clear
VA
Backlog
I
have
heard
from
an
overwhelming
number
of
veterans
over
the
past
month
about
immediate
changes
needed
with
the
VA.
The
message
I
am
hearing
loud
and
clear
is
this:
"Let
us
get
the
care
we
want,
where
we
want
it!"
I
could
not
agree
more,
and
our
veterans
have
earned
the
highest
level
of
medical
care
available.
I
have
long
believed
that
patient
choice
and
competition
would
have
in
part
prevented
many
of
the
problems
with
the
VA.
Veterans
should
have
the
right
to
choose
their
doctors.
Choice
brings
out
competition
and
competition
would
have,
at
least
in
part, reduced
or
eliminated
delays
as
doctors
competed
for
veteran
business.
We
have
learned
that
there
are
thousands
of
veterans
who
need
medical
help
right
now.
That
is
why
this
week
the
House
of
Representatives
passed
the
Veterans
Access
to
Care
Act
(H.R.
4810)
of
which
I
am
a
cosponsor.
In
an
incredible
act
of
bipartisanship,
the
vote
for
this
bill
was
unanimously
supported
by
all
members
of
Congress,
Republican
and
Democrat.
This
bill
allows
veterans
who
have
been
waiting
for
care
access
private
non-Department
medical
facilities
across
the
country.
This
legislation
comes
after
shocking
results
from
a
nationwide
audit
of
veteran&#8217;s
access
to
care.
In
the
report
released
on
Monday,
the
Inspector
General
of
the
VA
reported
he
discovered
premeditated
corruption
was rampant
amongst
high-level
supervisors
within
the
Department. In
many
facilities, VA
staff
said
they
felt
threatened
and
coerced
to submit
false
data,
while
whistleblowers
were
disciplined
for
not
complying
with
this
unethical
cover
up.
It
is
difficult
to
imagine
anyone
working
for
the
VA
believing
that
these
actions
were
morally
or
legally
acceptable.
I
spoke
about
these
issues
on
C-SPAN&#8217;s
Washington
Journal
this
past
Wednesday.

Upholding
our
Immigration
Laws
This
week
brought
us
more
information
on
the
lawlessness
of
the
administration
and
Attorney
General
Eric
Holder
in
regards
to
illegally
transporting
immigrants
to
Arizona
cities.
The
administration
continues
to
use
taxpayer
dollars
to
transport
and
house
detained
illegal
immigrants
flooding
across
our
porous
southern
border.
I
am
encouraged
to
see
this
egregious
violation
of
the
rule
of
law
receive
more
national
attention
from
major
news
outlets.
Pictures
of
illegal
immigrants

released
into
the
public
at
bus
stops
as
well
as
inhumane,
overcrowded
detention
facilities
are
being
broadcasted
on
the
nightly
news.
The
only
way
we
can
make
our
elected
leaders
uphold
the
rule
of
law
is
if
the
people
of
this
nation
are
engaged
in
the
issue
and
hold
them
accountable.

let

know
with
their

whether

not
they
support
an
Attorney
General
who
chooses
not

Additionally,
this

I

and
discussed
this
issue
in
more
detail.
You
can
listen
to
the
audio
of
that
interview

I
will
continue
to
push
my
colleagues
in
the
House
to
take
up
a
full
investigation
of
the
actions
by
multiple
government
agencies
who
are
participating
in
this
alien
smuggling.
On
Friday,
I
called
for
the
Administration
to
immediately
terminate
their
flawed
alien
smuggling
policy,
respond
to
pointed
questions
about
the
operations,
secure
the
border

stop
giving

But
I
need
your
help.
I
need
you
to
speak
up
and
continue
to
contact
your
elected
members
of
government
and
tell
them
that
the
foundation

decide
to
pick

choose

The
integrity
of
our
Constitutional
Republic
is
at
stake.
Four
Amendments
Passed
This
Week
Targeting
Spending
This
week,
the
House
continued
the
annual
process
of
appropriating
federal
funds
to
various
government
agencies
and
departments.
Throughout
my
entire
career
in
Congress,
I
have
focused
on
cutting
waste,
fraud
and
abuse
out
of
the
federal
government
budget.
I
successfully
passed
four
amendments
to
two
separate
appropriation
bills.
The
amendments
will
limit
the
size
and
scope
of
The
Department
of
House
and
Urban
Development
(THUD)
and
the
Department
of
Agriculture.
Amendment
1:
&#8220; Stop
Obama&#8217;s
Assault
on
the
Suburbs ".
This
amendment
prevents
the
federal
government
from
using
funds
to
socially
engineer
our
neighborhoods.
The
Department
of
Housing
and
Urban
Development
(THUD)
was
attempting
to
create
a
thinly
veiled
set
of
rules
and
regulations
which
would
force
communities
to
conform
to
the
utopian
dreams
of
an
ideological
administration
or
face
losing
out
on
billions
of
dollars
in
grant
money.
I
spoke
about
this
amendment
on
Tuesday
in
an
interview
with
Fox
Business
Network.
You
can
watch
that
interview
HERE .

Amendment
2:
This
amendment
prohibits funds
for
the
National
Highway
Traffic
Safety
Administration&#8217;s
National
Roadside
Survey :
This
worthless
road
survey
amounts
to
an
invasion
of
privacy,
a
violation
of
the
Fourth
Amendment,
and
a
dereliction
of
duty
to
protect
the
public.
Last
year&#8217;s
survey
squandered
almost
$8
million
dollars
of
taxpayer
money
and
did
nothing
to
make
our
communities
safer.

HERE .
Amendment
3:
This
amendment
cut
funds
from
the
wasteful
and
inefficient
Office
of
the
Chief
Financial
Officer
at
USDA
and
redirected
those
resources
to
the
Department&#8217;s
Office
of
Inspector
General
to
meet
the
budget
request. This
measure
will ensure
the
IG
has
the
resources
to
crack
down
on
the
widespread
waste,
fraud,
and
abuse
within
USDA.

Amendment
4:
My
final
amendment
that
passed
this
week
cut
$2.1
million
in
spending
that
Obama
wanted
to
use
to
hire
more
government
attorneys,
many
of
which
will
be
used
to
implement
and
defend
the
Administration&#8217;s
overreaching
land
grabs,
water
grabs,
and
climate
change
policies.
I
simply
cannot,
in
good
conscience,
support
funding
to
hire
new
government
bureaucrats
that
will
impose
more
overreaching
federal
regulations
and
infringe
upon
Arizona&#8217;s
Tenth
Amendment
right.
Read
more
HERE .
So
far
this
year
I
have
successfully
passed
a
dozen
amendments
that
have
scaled
back
excessive
government
spending
and
fought
federal
overreach.
Every
week
I
receive
hundreds
of
emails
and
calls
from
Arizonans
telling
me
about
some
of
the
bloated
government
horror
stories
that
they
read
in
the
news.
Even
with
a
17.5
TRILLION
DOLLAR
NATIONAL
DEBT ,
our
government
still
cannot
seem
to
recognize
that
we
have
a
spending
problem.
These
amendments
are
one
way
that
we
can
fight
back
against
an
out
of
control
government
and
I
plan
to
continue
listening
to
your
comments
and
taking
action.
