David,
I wanted to personally give you this news. With just 5 hours to go, we&rsquo;re only 88 short of hitting 25,000 online donations for the election!
That&rsquo;s an incredible showing, David. I&rsquo;m incredibly humbled by your grassroots support.
Your donations allow us to set the record straight and get the facts out to Illinois voters. But David, we&rsquo;re not there yet.
Please use the personalized link below to help us hit the mark before the election tomorrow. http://action.cheribustos.com/donate
I&rsquo;m so grateful to represent you,
Cheri Bustos
