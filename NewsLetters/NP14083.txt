Heller Files Amendments to Speed up
Veteran Disability Claims Process
(Washington, D.C.)
This
week, U.S. Senator Dean Heller (R-NV) filed
two amendments to S.1197, the National
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Both
amendments would speed up the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) disability claims
process and ensure that veterans receive
the benefits they earned and deserve in a
timely manner.
Its important that
Congress takes care of our nations
veterans by fulfilling the promises made to
them. Unfortunately, in Nevada, we have one
of the highest disability claims backlogs
in the country. Our current disability
claims processing system is broken and has
been an ongoing issue that severely impacts
our heroes and their families, said
Senator
Dean Heller . After everything
our veterans have been through and after
all the sacrifices they have made, it is
unacceptable for them to have to wait long
periods of time for their benefits. The
Senate should act quickly on these
amendments.
Background:
HAIMS Implementation
Amendment (SA 2311)
To process a veterans claim, the
VA must obtain records from the Department
of Defense (DOD). In an effort to
speed up the process, the DOD is developing
an electronic system, the Health Artifact
and Image Management Solution (HAIMS). This
system will electronically deliver critical
records to the VA. Implementation of
HAIMS will ensure that veterans receive a
decision on their claim in a timely
manner. This amendment would:
Set a deadline for the DOD to
implement HAIMS within 6 months.
Require the DOD to issue a report on
the success of HAIMS implementation and
the effect on the VAs claims
processing system.
DOD/VA Transfer of
Records Amendment (SA 2310)
According to a
2012 Government
Accountability Office (GAO) report , one
of the reasons that the veterans disability
claims backlog is so high is that the VA is
not receiving certain records it needs from
the DOD in a timely manner.
Hellers amendment directs to the
DOD to respond to a VA request for records
needed to process a claim within 30 days.
If the record cannot be transferred in 30
days, the DOD can request a 30-day
extension. If they dont respond
within 60 days, they must report to the VA
with the reason for the delay and when the
requested record will be provided.
