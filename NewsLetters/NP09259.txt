Dear David,
May has been a full month on both coasts. I helped pass legislation
that will bring more water infrastructure projects and jobs to Oregon,
introduced a bill to end costly and unnecessary government reports,
learned more about educational opportunities for deaf students at a
local school, and toured Portland's Veterans Affairs Medical Center.
Here's a rundown of May, including a schedule of my upcoming Town Hall
meetings.
Working to Extend Emergency Unemployment Benefits
Several people who lost emergency unemployment benefits spoke on the
Capitol steps about their ongoing efforts to find work. From young
parents unable to support their families, to mature, experienced
workers who can't find jobs, these diverse Americans exemplify the dire
need to extend emergency unemployment. I am collecting unemployment
stories from my constituents, so please send your story here
.
Supporting Water Resources & Infrastructure in Oregon
For the first time in seven years, Congress passed a water
infrastructure bill. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act
includes numerous provisions that benefit Oregonians including:
invasive species protection; ecosystem restoration; transfer of a boat
marina to the city of Warrenton, and a pilot project to provide
low-cost financing to local governments for water infrastructure
improvement. Read more here
.
New Legislation:
Government Reporting Efficiency Act
Following an article that discussed the thousands of unread,
unnecessary government reports, I introduced a bipartisan bill that
will sunset most reports after five years. This will save money and cut
down on the resources that agencies use to produce the reports. Read
more here
.
Advocating for a Well-Rounded Education
Several talented musicians joined me on Capitol Hill to promote arts
education. Representatives from the National Association of Music
Merchants along with drummer for the Red Hot Chili Peppers Chad Smith,
former New York Yankee and Grammy-nominated musician Bernie Williams,
and actor Doc Shaw, all joined me to discuss the role music played in
their lives. Former Secretary of Education, Richard Riley also spoke
about the importance of art in school. Read more here
.
Congresswoman in the Classroom
Continuing my Congresswoman in the Classroom tour, I visited deaf
students at Groner Elementary School in Hillsboro. I learned about the
technology they use to help their deaf students communicate with
others, and how the school incorporates American Sign Language (ASL)
into its curriculum. Groner is the only school in the Hillsboro School
District that has an ASL program, which is offered to all students.
Caring For Our Veterans
I toured Portland's VA medical center to learn more about the work they
are doing and to discuss the recent allegations that officials in other
states have attempted to conceal long waiting lists for veterans
needing care. While we await the results of the investigation into
these allegations, we must also ensure the VA has the resources it
needs to provide our veterans with the care they deserve. Read more

June Town Halls
During the first two weeks of June I will be holding eight town halls
across the First District. I encourage all my constituents to attend
and to discuss issues that are important to them. For a full list of
dates, times, and locations please visit my website
or
Facebook
page. I hope to see you there! Read more
