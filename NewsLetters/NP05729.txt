&ldquo;The odds of Republicans winning the Senate are growing&rdquo;
--
Washington Post , 9/29/2014
Dear Friend,
November is fast approaching, and for Democrats across the country, it&rsquo;s not looking good. The
Washington Post , the
New York Times , Nate Silver, and others are predicting a likely Republican takeover in the Senate.
The GOP only needs to pick up six seats to gain the majority in the Senate. We can&rsquo;t let that happen. Forecasters are giving the GOP the edge. We need to work harder than ever between now and Election Day, and that&rsquo;s going to take resources -- can you get us $5 closer to our $16O,OOO October goal?

Special interests are spending money like it&rsquo;s going out of style. Karl Rove and the Koch brothers are leading the charge. They&rsquo;re trying to buy a Senate that will rubber-stamp their radical agenda.
We don&rsquo;t know exactly what a Tea Party Senate would do, but we already know that the Tea Party House would end Medicare as we know it. If the GOP takes over the Senate, Massachusetts families are going to suffer. We need to raise $16O,OOO in October to keep fighting. Help us out with a $5 contribution.
Thanks for your support.
