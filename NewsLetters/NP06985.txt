Friend -
Recently, a government
report
showed that federal agencies have failed to report over $600 billion in awards, including grant and loans.
I supported the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA),
H.R. 2061 , to establish an independent body to track federal spending, including grants, contracts, loans and agencies internal expenses, on a single electronic platform, making all of the information available to the public.
Transparency and accountability are not just common sense, they are necessary in order to show the American people how their money is being spent.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.
