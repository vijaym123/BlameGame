What My School Nutrition Bill Does
It makes the USDA's temporary easing of the meat and grain requirements
permanent. That will allow schools more flexibility in serving meats
and grains while still staying within calorie maximums.
It gives administrators flexibility on some of the rules that have
increased costs for school districts.
KSFY: Noem to introduce school lunch guidelines bill
Representative Kristi Noem heard some South Dakota kids have been
grumbling about their empty stomachs and plans to introduce a bill to
stop the rumbling.
Good morning.
I hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving with
your friends and family!
As many of you know, the federal government put new limits on the
amount of food kids can have at lunch beginning in the 2012 school
year.
The new rules limit schools on the amount of meat and grains
they serve and add a number of other restrictions.
Those decisions
shouldn't be made in Washington. The school administrators, cooks and
nutritionists who see our kids walk through the lunch line every day
should have some flexibility to serve our kids what they need.
That is
something I'm trying to do with a new school lunch bill I'll be
introducing later this week.
I talked with Elisabeth Hasselbeck on Fox & Friends this morning about
my plan.
WATCH NOW
I'd love to hear from you about what you think about my proposal.
If
you agree, please forward this email on to your friends and family.
Ask them to sign up for this newsletter too!
I hope to hear from you
soon.
Thank you,
Kristi Noem

Good

I

As
many
of
you
know,
the
federal
government
put
new
limits
on
the
amount
of
food
kids
can
have
at
lunch
beginning
in
the
2012
school
year.
The
new
rules
limit
schools
on
the
amount
of
meat
and
grains
they
serve
and
add
a
number
of
other
restrictions.
Those decisions
shouldn't
be

Washington. The
school
administrators,
cooks
and
nutritionists who
see
our
kids
walk
through
the
lunch
line
every
day
should
have
some

serve
our
kids
what
they
need.
That
is
something
I'm
