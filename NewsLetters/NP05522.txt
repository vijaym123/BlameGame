Stopping Ebola in its Tracks in West
Africa
Last month President Obamas requested, and
Congress approved, $1 billion to send 4,000 American troops to West
Africa to help contain the Ebola epidemic that is raging across the
region.
As chairman of the House Defense Appropriations
Subcommittee, I had the obligation to thoroughly examine the Pentagons
plans before releasing the funds. Earlier this week, several of my
colleagues and I were provided with a comprehensive briefing.
As
this
article
in
The
Hill
reports, my questions and concerns about the Pentagons
proposal were addressed and I agreed to release the funds so the Pentagon
could go forward.
Please be certain that in the weeks
and months ahead, we will work to ensure that our troops are well
protected from the Ebola virus as well as from any groups that might be
interested in harming our soldiers during this humanitarian
mission.
The Fight Against ISIS: WSJ Discusses the holes in
Obamas strategy
President Obamas strategy to
degrade and ultimately destroy the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria
(ISIS) is increasingly appearing to be inadequate to its stated goal. As
the
Wall Street Journal
pointed
out earlier this week, ISISs siege of the Syrian city
of Kobani is showing the holes in Obamas
strategy.
Although air strikes led by the United States have increased in the past
few days, ISIS is reportedly in control of at least one-third of the
city. ISIS is a grave threat, not just to our interests in the Middle
East, but also here at home and in Europe. Until ISIS is destroyed, the
threat it poses will only continue to grow.
The
Daily Beast: Biden Apologizes for Telling the
Truth
Last week Vice President Joe Biden
spoke
some
uncomfortable truths about the growth of ISIS and how some of our
allies in the Middle East did not do enough to deter ISIS as it rushed to
fill the vacuum left when the United States completely withdrew from
Iraq.
The Vice President subsequently apologized for his
remarks to the President of Turkey and to the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi.
Unfortunately, Vice President Bidens comments only served to further
highlight the clear and compelling need for strong American leadership
in destroying ISIS.
Syria: A Complex and Difficult
Situation
The current state of affairs in Syria
grows increasingly complex as the United States focuses its attention on
fighting ISIS in Syria and forgets its pledge to remove Syrian
President Assad! This
analysis
in yesterdays
New York Times
is a must read for anyone
interested in better understanding the many conflicting forces and
interests that make Syria such a difficult
situation.
Latest Economic News Disappointing
Although the report
that the unemployment rate had dropped below six percent for the
first time since July 2008 is certainly welcome news, the United States is
still stuck in the slowest recovery from a recession since World War
II.
As the Bureau of labor Statistics reported, nearly 20
million people remain underemployed or unemployed. Heres the
breakdown:
9.3 million people are
unemployed;
7.1 million people are people working part-time jobs who would
rather work full time; and,
2.2 million people are
considered to be marginally attached to the labor force, because although
they want to work and have looked for a job over the past year, they have
become so discouraged they didnt even bother to look for a job
during the past four weeks.
The House has
passed
more than 40 bills to stimulate job creation and
opportunity for all Americans. Yet they remain stuck in the Senate. When the
Senate returns to Washington next month, I hope they will get to work
and move these bills forward.
Welcoming the
Ukrainian President to the Capitol
I was honored to
be named to the Official Escort Committee that greeted Ukrainian
President Poroshenko on his recent visit to the United States Capitol. I
spoke with him before his historic address to a Joint Meeting of Congress
and him that I am proud to represent so many Ukrainian Americans who
live in North Jersey and to have worked with them to get more
assistance to Ukraine from the United States.
Salute:
Totowa First Aid Squad
I was honored to attend the
unveiling last weekend at the Totowa First Aid Squad of a moving
monument
to those killed in the terrorist attacks of
September 11, 2011. Members of the Squad were among those who rendered aid
on 9-11 to people who were evacuated from lower Manhattan to Liberty
State Park in Jersey City.
I salute the men and women of
the Totowa First Aid Squad, and all first responders, who give so much
of themselves in service to their communities. They have my gratitude
and my thanks!
Salute:
U.S. Air
Force Maj. Joseph Crecca of
Bloomfield
Congratulations to Bloomfield resident Major Joseph Crecca, USAF, who was
inducted
yesterday into the Aviation Hall of Fame. A
Vietnam veteran, Major Crecca served as an F-4C Phantom Weapons Systems
Officer. On his 87 th
mission, his fighter was brought down
over North Vietnam. Captured by the North Vietnamese after being ejected
from the aircraft, he was held as a Prisoner of War, under brutal and
inhumane conditions, for six years and three months.
I
salute Major Crecca for his service to our nation. He is most deserving of
his induction in the Aviation Hall of
Fame.
Salute: Drew University
The 11 th
Congressional District is home to some of Americas finest institutions of higher
education. Among them is Drew University in Madison.
I
recently had the pleasure of meeting with Drews new President, Dr.
MaryAnn Baenninger, and taking a
campus
tour. I was
especially impressed with Drews Hall of Sciences, which has been
renovated since my last visit to Drew.
Promoting STEM
(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) education is key to Americas
future. I salute Drew for its commitment to educating the next
generation of STEM students!
