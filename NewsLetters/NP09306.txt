Dear
Friends,
The most important function of our
government is to provide for the common defense and to ensure that military
men and women who selflessly volunteer to serve and protect our nation
are properly cared for both during and after service.
If we cannot defend what we stand for,
then everything else that we do does not matter.
That is why I
was
pleased to support the National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year
2015 .
The NDAA for 2015 supports our military's ability to respond
and defend our nation's interests and safeguards national security.
It provides for and protects our nation's veterans, war fighters
and their families with the benefits they have earned.
NDAA for
2015 does all of this, while upholding a commitment to spending
taxpayer dollars wisely.
Veterans Management Accountability Act of
2014
I was incredibly upset and disturbed to
learn about VA hospitals allegedly falsifying data to hide long waits
for medical appointments resulting in the recent deaths of veterans who
were waiting for care. Our veterans deserve better.
They, their
families, and the American people deserve
answers.
The House took action and passed the
Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act of 2014 (H.R.
4031) which gives the VA Secretary additional tools to fire or remove
employees from service due to poor
performance.
It is imperative that trust is restored within the VA
system, and I will continue to fight for the rights and benefits of our
veterans.
Military
Appreciation
The
month of May marks National Military Appreciation Month.
However,
every month military, veterans, and their families should be
appreciated and celebrated for the commitment they have
made.
As we prepare to celebrate Memorial Day, please
join me in remembering the men and women who made the ultimate
sacrifice in defense of our nation.
I
hope you and your family have a safe and happy Memorial
Day.
Stay in touch and
God bless,
