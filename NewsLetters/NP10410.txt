April 20, 2014
Dear Friend,
This country was built on the promise of opportunity.
The promise that
people have the opportunity to work hard and support themselves and
their families. By addressing the economic challenges many folks face
and investing in job training and educational opportunities, we can
safeguard the promise of American opportunity.
Congress needs to make a sincere commitment to providing folks with the
opportunities and tools they need to provide for themselves and their
families. There is still much more that can be done to ensure that we
bolster hard-working Americans and spur economic growth.
A crucial factor in generating more economic opportunities for folks is
by reforming the tax code to ensure it protects hard-working Americans
and supports the creation and retention of good-paying jobs.
At the
end of 2013, 55 tax cuts expired and Congress has not yet acted on
extending these provisions.
These cuts lowered burdens on married
couples, parents and the working class and increased tax credits for
education and retirement savings.
We need to continue to prioritize measures that assist in job creation
for hard-working folks, improve and expand educational opportunities
for students, and strengthen our economy. Placing the burden on
middle-class families is simply not right.
Cut Taxes for the Middle Class Act
This week, on Tax Day, I introduced the Cut Taxes for the Middle Class
Act to restore tax fairness for America's middle class families.
This
bill extends 8 of the tax cuts that expired at the end of last year in
order to help lift hard-working Americans in this time of economic
recovery. Extending these tax cuts would benefit a range of Americans
such as Texans and those in states with no income tax, students
aspiring to get a higher education, and businesses that hire low-income
folks and veterans. I'm hopeful that Congress will extend these
common-sense tax cuts this year to put money back in the pocket of
middle class Texans and continue to strengthen our nation's economy.
*
Deduction for state and local general sales taxes
*	This deduction will benefit taxpayers working in states
that only have sales taxes and no income tax, such as Texas. It may
give a larger deduction to any taxpayer who paid more in sales taxes
than income taxes.
*
Deduction for tuition and higher education related expenses
*
Students, their spouse, or dependents can benefit from
a deduction of up to $4,000 on tuition and related expenses for higher
education.
*
Deduction for elementary and secondary school teachers' expenses
*
This provision provides a $250 above-the-line tax
deduction for teachers and other school professional for expenses
including amounts paid or incurred for books, supplies, computer
equipment, and supplementary materials used by the educator in the
classroom.
*
Deduction for businesses that hire low-income folks and veterans
*
The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) is a credit that
benefits employers and job seekers. It is available to employers for
hiring individuals from certain target groups who have consistently
faced significant barriers to employment.
*
Housing Credit Provisions for Members of the Armed Forces
*
This provision ensures that basic housing allowance
payments made to military personnel and families are not included in
income for determining low-income housing tax credit income eligibility
for buildings located in certain areas.
*
Credit for employers with activated military reservists
*
This provision extends a tax credit for eligible small
businesses of activated military reservists. This allows a small
business employer to take credit for the differential wage payments if
their employee is called to active duty with the Armed forces.
*
Credit for organizations investing in low-income communities
*
The New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) incentivizes
financial institutions to provide capital for economic development in
low-income communities. This credit is designed to stimulate and invest
in low-income, urban areas to increase development and create more jobs.
*
Credit for business research and experimentation expenses
*
This tax credit benefits businesses that are involved
in research and development, which in turn strengthens their business
and spurs innovation.
We must ensure that the economy continues to grow in order to
strengthen the middle class. I am committed to working with my
colleagues to find balanced solutions that will protect hard-working
families and put our fiscal house in order.
Sincerely,
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
This
country
was
built
on
the
promise
of
opportunity.
The
promise
that
people have
the
opportunity
to work
hard
and support themselves
and their
families. By
addressing
the
economic
challenges
many
folks
face
and
investing
in
job
training
and
educational
opportunities,
we
can
safeguard
the
promise
of
American
opportunity.
Congress
needs
to
make
a
sincere
commitment
to
providing
folks
with
the
opportunities
and
tools
they
need
to
provide
for
themselves
and
their
families. There
is
still
much
more
that
can
be
done
to
ensure
that
we
bolster
hard-working
Americans
and
spur
economic
growth.
A
crucial
factor
in
generating
more
economic
opportunities
for
folks
is
by
reforming
the
tax
code
to
ensure
it
protects
hard-working
Americans
and
supports
the
creation
and
retention
of
good-paying
jobs.
At
the
end
of
2013,
55
tax
cuts
expired
and
Congress
has
not
yet
acted
on
extending
these
provisions.
These
cuts
lowered
burdens
on
married
couples,
parents
and
the
working
class
and
increased
tax
credits
for
education
and
retirement
savings.
We
need
to
continue
to
prioritize
measures
that
assist
in
job
creation
for
hard-working
folks,
improve
and
expand
educational
opportunities
for
students,
and
strengthen
our
economy. Placing
the
burden
on
middle-class
families
is
simply
not
right.
Cut
Taxes
for
the
Middle
Class
Act
This
week,
on
Tax
Day,
I
introduced
the
Cut
Taxes
for
the
Middle
Class
Act
to
restore
tax
fairness
for
America&#8217;s
middle
class
families.
This
bill
extends
8
of
the
tax
cuts
that
expired
at
the
end
of
last
year
in
order
to
help
lift
hard-working
Americans
in
this
time
of
economic
recovery.
Extending
these
tax
cuts
would
benefit
a
range
of
Americans
such
as
Texans
and
those
in
states
with
no
income
tax,
students
aspiring
to
get
a
higher
education,
and
businesses
that
hire
low-income
folks
and
veterans.
I&#8217;m
hopeful
that
Congress
will
extend
these
common-sense
tax
cuts
this
year
to
put
money
back
in
the
pocket
of
middle
class
Texans
and
continue
to
strengthen
our
nation&#8217;s
economy.
Deduction
for
state
and
local
general
sales
taxes
This
deduction
will
benefit
taxpayers
working
in
states
that
only
have
sales
taxes
and
no
income
tax,
such
as
Texas.
It
may
give
a
larger
deduction
to
any
taxpayer
who
paid
more
in
sales
taxes
than
income
taxes.
Deduction
for
tuition
and
higher
education
related
expenses Students,
their
spouse,
or
dependents
can
benefit
from
a
deduction
of
up
to
$4,000
on
tuition
and
related
expenses
for
higher
education. Deduction
for
elementary
and
secondary
school
teachers&#8217;
expenses This
provision
provides
a
$250
above-the-line
tax
deduction
for
teachers
and
other
school
professional
for
expenses
including
amounts
paid
or
incurred
for
books,
supplies,
computer
equipment,
and
supplementary
materials
used
by
the
educator
in
the
classroom. Deduction
for
businesses
that
hire
low-income
folks
and
veterans The
Work
Opportunity
Tax
Credit
(WOTC)
is
a
credit
that
benefits
employers
and
job
seekers.
It
is
available
to
employers
for
hiring
individuals
from
certain target
groups who
have
consistently
faced
significant
barriers
to
employment. Housing
Credit
Provisions
for
Members
of
the
Armed
Forces This
provision
ensures
that
basic
housing
allowance
payments
made
to
military
personnel
and
families
are
not
included
in
income
for
determining
low-income
housing
tax
credit
income
eligibility
for
buildings
located
in
certain
areas. Credit
for
employers
with
activated
military
reservists This
provision
extends
a
tax
credit
for
eligible
small
businesses
of
activated
military
reservists.
This
allows
a
small
business
employer
to
take
credit
for
the
differential
wage
payments
if
their
employee
is
called
to
active
duty
with
the
Armed
forces. Credit
for
organizations
investing
in
low-income
communities The
New
Markets
Tax
Credit
( NMTC)
incentivizes
financial
institutions
to
provide
capital
for
economic
development
in
low-income
communities.
This
credit
is
designed
to
stimulate
and
invest
in
low-income,
urban
areas
to
increase
development
and
create
more
jobs. Credit
for
business
research
and
experimentation
expenses This
tax
credit
benefits
businesses
that
are
involved
in
research
and
development,
which
in
turn
strengthens
their
business
and
spurs
innovation.
We
must
ensure
that
the
economy
continues
to
grow
in
order
to
strengthen
the
middle
class.
I
am
committed
to
working
with
my
colleagues
to
find
balanced
solutions
that
will
protect
hard-working
families
and
put
our
fiscal
house
in
order.
Sincerely,
Member
of
Congress
