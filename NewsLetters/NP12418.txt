Farwell from Congressman Andrews and Important Constituent Information
Last week, I announced that I will be leaving the United States
Congress in order to take a position in the private sector. I am
profoundly humbled and grateful that you have given me this honor.
Over the last 24 years, your insight on the many issues facing our
community, region and country has been invaluable. Serving in the
United States Congress has been among the greatest of honors and I will
cherish the countless interactions I have had with people of all
backgrounds, parties and beliefs.
Effective February 18, 2014, I am no longer your Representative in
Congress.
Below you will find information regarding your ability to
receive services in our Congressional District.
Both the legislative and district staffs, under the supervision of the
Clerk of the House, will continue working on any problems or matters
you bring to the office. You are welcome to call, email or write to the
office at the addresses on this message.
If you already have a case open, you must give the office permission to
continue working on your case, which the staff will then work to
resolve. If the case is not resolved by the time a new Representative
is sworn in, it will be passed to the new Representative. In the next
few weeks, the Clerk will send you a letter detailing these procedures
and provide you with a form to notify the office of your desire. If you
want the current staff to stop working on your case, the office will
return to you any documentation in your file. It will then be your
decision as to whether to seek further help, perhaps from the new
Representative or from your U.S. Senators.
Whether you want the office
to either continue or stop working does not control the actions of the
government agency involved in your case.
Again, it has been and honor and privilege to serve as your
Representative in Congress. I wish you and your family the best in the
years to come.
Sincerely,
Rob Andrews

Farwell
from
Congressman
Andrews
and
Important
Constituent
Information
Last
week,
I
announced
that
I
will
be
leaving
the
United
States
Congress
in
order
to
take
a
position
in
the
private
sector.
I
am
profoundly
humbled
and
grateful
that
you
have
given
me
this
honor.
Over
the
last
24
years,
your
insight
on
the
many
issues
facing
our
community,
region
and
country
has
been
invaluable.
Serving
in
the
United
States
Congress
has
been
among
the
greatest
of
honors
and
I
will
cherish
the
countless
interactions
I
have
had
with
people
of
all
backgrounds,
parties
and
beliefs.
Effective
February
18,
2014,
I
am
no
longer
your
Representative
in
Congress.
Below
you
will
find
information
regarding
your
ability
to
receive
services
in
our
Congressional
District.
Both
the
legislative
and
district
staffs,
under
the
supervision
of
the
Clerk
of
the
House,
will
continue
working
on
any
problems
or
matters
you
bring
to
the
office.
You
are
welcome
to
call,
email
or
write
to
the
office
at
the
addresses
on
this
message.
If
you
already
have
a
case
open,
you
must
give
the
office
permission
to
continue
working
on
your
case,
which
the
staff
will
then
work
to
resolve.
If
the
case
is
not
resolved
by
the
time
a
new
Representative
is
sworn
in,
it
will
be
passed
to
the
new
Representative.
In
the
next
few
weeks,
the
Clerk
will
send
you
a

detailing
these
procedures
and
provide
you
with
a

to

the
office
of
your
desire.
If
you
want
the
current
staff
to
stop
working
on
your
case,
the
office
will
return
to
you
any
documentation
in
your
file.
It
will
then
be
your
decision
as
to
whether
to
seek
further
help,
perhaps
from
the
new
Representative
or
from
your
U.S.
Senators.
Whether
you
want
the
office
to
either
continue
or
stop
working
does
not
control
the
actions
of
the
government
agency
involved
in
your
case.
Again,
it
has
been
and
honor
and
privilege
to
serve
as
your
Representative
in
Congress.
I
wish
you
and
your
family
the
best
in
the
years
to
come.
