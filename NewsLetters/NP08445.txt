Lost IRS
Emails
This past Friday, my colleagues and I on the House Ways
&amp; Means Committee held a hearing focused on the investigation into
the IRSs targeting of American citizens. It followed on the heels of
news that broke the week prior that the IRS claims to have "lost"
countless emails from IRS officials including those authored by Lois Lerner
the official at the center of the agencys targeting of American
citizens. The agency is blaming a failure of computer hard drives. The
whole situation is a tad suspect to say the
least.
After a year's long investigation where
slowly but surely we have learned more and more troubling facts about the
abuse and targeting of citizens, to now have the IRS say they can't
provide years worth of information that might shed more light on what
happened only enhances, and rightfully so, the American peoples
mistrust and cynicism. Nevertheless, Congress has a responsibility to
discover all the facts. The IRS ought to be doing everything it can to
cooperate with this investigation and do so in a timely manner. Instead, the
agencys behavior continues to raise more questions and cause more
frustration on the part of Congress and those we
represent.
Welcoming New American Citizens
On
June 13th, I had the honor of participating in a naturalization
ceremony in Atlanta where 164 folks from 53 different countries took an oath
to become American citizens. These individuals completed a long and
surely at times arduous process to reach this moment of pride and
achievement. We wish them all the best and welcome them as fellow
Americans.
