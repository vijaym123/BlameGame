The Hill: House Votes to Boost Border
Security
6/19/14
In case you missed it, Congressman
Lamborn's efforts to protect our southern border were featured in an article
by The Hill by reporter Cristina
Marcos.
"The House on Wednesday gave voice vote approval to a proposal
from Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.) that would increase funding for the
Army National Guard to assist with border
security.
Lamborn's amendment to the 2015
Defense appropriations bill would boost the Army National Guard's budget by
$5 million by offsetting the same amount from the Defense Department's
administration operations
account.
Lamborn said his amendment would help give the Army
National Guard the necessary resources to help secure the border with
Mexico.
"They do
not have dedicated funding or the additional funding they need for this
border protection mission, and yet they're involved in trying to
establish order at the border," Lamborn
said.
Lamborn's amendment encountered no
opposition.
Earlier Wednesday, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) tried to
offer an amendment that would increase funding for the Army National
Guard by $41.4 million to deal with the influx of child migrants across
the
border.
"People in the administration are refusing and
failing to refuse to do the job and faithfully execute the laws of
this nation," Gohmert
said.
Gohmert's amendment would reduce the
Pentagon's Defense-wide operation and maintenance account by the same
amount.
But Gohmert's amendment was ruled out of order. Rep. Rodney
Frelinghuysen (R-N.J.), the chairman of the House Appropriations
Defense subcommittee, said the amendment would ultimately cause the
overall bill to cost
more.
Gohmert argued that his amendment was
offset, but was nonetheless
overruled.
"I think it's fuzzy math that
the CBO is engaged in," Gohmert
said.
The Defense appropriations
bill is being considered under a modified open rule, meaning that
members can offer an unlimited number of amendments with up to 10 minutes of
debate each."
