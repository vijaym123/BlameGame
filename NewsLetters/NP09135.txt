Putting Fish Before People
The draining of more than 70,000 acre feet of water from dams on the
American and Stanislaus rivers to meet environmental demands that place
fish above people was the focus of House floor remarks by Congressman
McClintock on May 8th.
A column by the Congressman discussing the same
issue was published by the Wall Street Journal on May 24th.
Putting Fish Before People
Mr. Speaker:
California is suffering one of the worst droughts in its history.
More
than a half-million acres of the most fertile farmland in the nation
have been devastated.
Some Central Valley farmers have been notified
that they will receive zero water allocations this year from the
federal system. The owners of long-held water rights are being cut off.
In some communities, "water police" go from door to door to enforce
water restrictions.
Homeowners are forbidden to water their lawns
except under the most rigid constraints. Sacramento offers an "app" so
people can turn in neighbors to the water authorities.
And yet, knowing full well we are facing a devastating drought and that
our dwindling water supply will be desperately needed by our people
this summer, over the past several weeks the Bureau of Reclamation has
released more than 70,000 acre feet of water from dams on the American
and Stanislaus rivers to meet environmental demands that place fish
above people.
That is enough water to meet the annual needs of a city of half a
million people - all sacrificed in order to flush salmon smolts to the
ocean (where they tend to swim anyway) and to keep the river at just
the right temperature for the comfort of the fish.

Remarks in Opposition to H.R. 2548 Overseas Private Investment
Corporation (OPIC) Reauthorization
On May 7th Congressman McClintock opposed reauthorization of the
Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC).
During House floor
debate on the measure the Congressman noted that OPIC pays for the bad
business decisions of large corporations and underwrites job creation
abroad, all at the expense of hard-working American taxpayers.
H.R. 2548 OPIC Reauthorization
Mr. Speaker:
One of the biggest complaints I hear is the practice of forcing
taxpayers to underwrite the losses and risks of politically
well-connected companies.
They reap the profits while American
taxpayers pay for their losses.
Today, the House considers a bill that perpetuates this policy with the
objective of creating jobs - not in America, but overseas.
Quietly
tucked into this bill is a provision to reauthorize the Overseas
Private Investment Corporation - or OPIC - for another three years.
OPIC provides political risk insurance, loan guarantees and direct
loans to U.S. Companies for their overseas investments - making U.S.
taxpayers responsible for their losses.
Recent beneficiaries include the Ritz Carlton in Istanbul, Citibank
branches in Pakistan, Jordan and Egypt and a Sun Edison solar farm in
South Africa.

Later on the 13th in Sonora he was interviewed on KVML Radio and by the
Sonora Union Democrat newspaper.
He also spoke to students at the
Mother Lode Adventist Academy in Sonora about the role the Constitution

On Memorial Day Congressman McClintock attended observances for
veterans at the Auburn Area War Memorial. Gold Star families were

Sainsbury and SPC Nicholas Burley were added to the War Memorial.
They
were killed in combat in recent wars.
Later that day the Congressman
was guest speaker at the American Legion Memorial Day Ceremony in
Roseville.
Memorial Day 2014
Roseville, CA
For many of our fellow citizens, Memorial Day marks the commencement of
the summer holidays.
For those who gather today at events like this,
it has far deeper meaning.
It is the day we set aside to honor those
who gave their lives in defense of - what exactly?
What exactly did they die defending?
We always say "they died defending our country."
And indeed they did.
But we need to remind ourselves that the blood they spilled and the
lives they sacrificed was for an oath NOT to preserve, protect and
defend the United States of America or the United States Government.
It was to preserve, protect and defend the CONSTITUTION of the UNITED
STATES.
That's the only oath they took, and they died for that oath.
They died
defending not our country, but our Constitution - that is the only
thing they pledged to defend.
And Preserve.
And Protect.
It is the
same pledge required of every person in our government and every
immigrant who becomes a citizen.
The people of other countries pledge their loyalty to their sovereign,
or their country or their government.
In America, the people are
sovereign and we pledge our loyalty to the Constitution.

Memorial
Day
2014 Roseville,
CA
For
many
of
our
fellow
citizens,
Memorial
Day
marks
the
commencement
of
the
summer
holidays.
For
those
who
gather
today
at
events
like
this,
it
has
far
deeper
meaning.
It
is
the
day
we
set
aside
to
honor
those
who
gave
their
lives
in
defense
of
&#8211;
what
exactly?
What
exactly
did
they
die
defending?
We
always
say
&#8220;they
died
defending
our
country.&#8221;
And
indeed
they
did.
But
we
need
to
remind
ourselves
that
the
blood
they
spilled
and
the
lives
they
sacrificed
was
for
an
oath
NOT
to
preserve,
protect
and
defend
the
United
States
of
America
or
the
United
States
Government.
It
was
to
preserve,
protect
and
defend
the
CONSTITUTION
of
the
UNITED
STATES.
That&#8217;s
the
only
oath
they
took,
and
they
died
for
that
oath.
They
died
defending
not
our
country,
but
our
Constitution
&#8211;
that
is
the
only
thing
they
pledged
to
defend.
And
Preserve.
And
Protect.
It
is
the
same
pledge
required
of
every
person
in
our
government
and
every
immigrant
who
becomes
a
citizen.
The
people
of other
countries
pledge
their
loyalty
to
their
sovereign,
or
their
country
or
their
government.
In
America,
the
people
are
sovereign
and
we
pledge
our
loyalty
to
the
Constitution.
