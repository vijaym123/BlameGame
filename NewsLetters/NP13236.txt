Help With a Federal Agency
Dear Friend-
I hope everyone had a Merry Christmas and I wish everyone a safe and
prosperous new year.
This newsletter provides a brief overview of some of the measures that
passed the House with my support in 2013.
Next week I will send an
overview of the work of the committees on which I serve: the Foreign
Affairs, Oversight & Government Reform, and Judiciary committees.
Economic Growth and Job Creation
1. Domestic energy production.
The House passed a series of bills
designed to expand the production of energy in the United States and in
North America.
The bills include approval of the Keystone XL pipeline,
reform of the permitting process for natural gas pipelines, and the
development of strategic and critical mineral production.
The goal of
these measures is three-fold: (i) to provide more opportunities for
good-paying jobs, particularly for blue collar workers; (ii) to put a
downward pressure on energy prices, thereby benefiting consumers and
lowering costs for businesses; and (iii) to enhance national security
by making the United States less dependent on - and hopefully
completely independent from - foreign sources of energy. The Senate did
not take up any of these bills, or any similar bills that would boost
jobs and lower energy costs.
2. Repeal, Defund and Delay of ObamaCare.
The biggest story of 2013 in
American politics was the unmasking of the deception used to engineer
passage of the 2010 health care law known as ObamaCare.
Told they
could keep their health plans, keep their doctors, and would see their
insurance premiums fall, Americans realized soon after the program's
October 1st launch that none of it was true.
The House voted at
various times to repeal, defund, and/or delay the law to mitigate the
damage the law is causing to America's patients, doctors, and health
care system.
The law should be completely replaced with a
patient-centered reform plan, such as the one authored by Dr. Tom
Price, which will provide access to affordable health care coverage for
all Americans, rein in out-of-control costs, solve insurance challenges
of portability and pre-existing illness, and improve the health care
delivery structure.
The Senate has not been willing to advance any
form of relief from ObamaCare for the American people.
3. Infrastructure: the Water Resources Reform and Development Act.
Improving the vital ports and waterways of the United States is
critical for economic growth and for America's global economic
competitiveness.
The WRRDA bill begins to reduce the bureaucracy and
red tape that stunts development of water resources projects, brings
more transparency to the process of project development, and modernizes
the water resources infrastructure network.
Though WRRDA has not yet
been signed into law, I expect a House-Senate conference to produce a
bill that will be enacted in early 2014.
4. Legal reform. The House passed two bills designed to reduce the
costs to our economy associated with excessive litigation.
The Lawsuit
Abuse Reduction Act adds teeth to provisions of current law that are
supposed to penalize parties who bring frivolous lawsuits.
The
Innovation Act protects businesses - especially those small businesses
and start-up companies who are least likely to be able to bear the
costs of frivolous lawsuits - from groundless patent infringement
claims brought by sue-happy plaintiffs known as patent trolls.
These
bills address a fundamental problem with America's modern legal system:
the cost of defending against baseless claims is so high that
unscrupulous plaintiffs can often times obtain a settlement for a
frivolous claim simply because defense of the claim is so expensive.
The legal system should be used to rectify harms, not as a means to
extract settlement payments for unmeritorious claims.
The Senate has
not considered either of these bills, or any bill designed to reduce
the costs associated with litigation.
5. SKILLS Act. This bill eliminates failed programs and empowers states
to consolidate job training resources to best equip American workers
with the skills that are most in demand by employers.
The Senate has
not considered this or similar legislation.
Reform of Government and the Bureaucracy
1. No Budget, No Pay.
Both houses of Congress are required by law to
pass a budget on an annual basis, but until this year the Senate had
not passed a budget in several years.
In January, the House passed a
bill linking the passage of a budget to the pay of lawmakers: no
budget, no pay.
Under the threat of having member pay withheld, the
Senate, lo and behold, finally decided to pass a budget in April.
2. Stop Government Abuse Act.
The government is supposed to serve We
the People, not the other way around.
Yet, from the misdeeds of the
IRS to waste of taxpayer money by bureaucrats in high places, it is
clear that the government is not adequately accountable to the American
people.
The Stop Government Abuse Act (i) allows citizens to record
meetings and phone conversations with federal bureaucrats, (ii) allows
senior-level executive agency employees to be placed on investigative
leave without pay, including those who take the Fifth Amendment before
Congress (iii) enhances termination authority so that reckless
government employees are relieved of duty.
The Senate did not consider
this bill, or any similar piece of legislation designed to protect
citizens from government abuse.
3. Accountability of the Bureaucracy.
The Regulations from the
Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act brings accountability to the
rules constantly imposed on society by unelected executive branch
officials by requiring Congress to approve all rules which carry a cost
to the economy of $100 million or more.
This brings accountability to
the process because it makes Congress responsible for major rules that
have a dramatic effect on society.
4. Keep the IRS Off Your Healthcare Act.
This bill prohibits the IRS
from implementing or enforcing any aspect of ObamaCare.
The IRS should
not be involved in the health care of the American people at all, let
alone in the intrusive fashion as mandated by ObamaCare.
Welfare reform
1. Preserving Welfare Work Requirements.
The House passed a bill that,
among other things, prevents the executive branch from waiving the work
requirements that serve as the foundation for the 1996 welfare reform
law.
Welfare programs should be a second chance, not a way of life;
all programs should incentivize work and personal responsibility.
2. Food Stamp Reform.
According to official statistics, the recession
ended in 2009, yet food stamp use has continued to increase over the
last several years.
The program is supposed to provide nutrition
assistance to those who cannot fend for themselves; it should not be
used as a means of relieving anybody of personal responsibility.
The
two key reforms included in the House reform bill are (i) allowing
states to require able-bodied adults with no dependents to work or look
for work as a condition of receiving taxpayer-financed assistance, and
(ii) limiting food stamp assistance to those individuals who satisfy
the income limitations.
These reforms will save money for taxpayers;
they will also reform the program to make it serve the needs of the
American people.

hesitate to contact either my Washington, DC or Port Orange office

Dear
Friend&#8211;
I
hope
everyone
had
a
Merry
Christmas
and
I
wish
everyone
a
safe
and
prosperous
new
year.
This
newsletter
provides
a
brief
overview
of
some
of
the
measures
that
passed
the
House
with
my
support
in
2013.
Next
week
I
will
send
an
overview
of
the
work
of
the
committees
on
which
I
serve:
the
Foreign
Affairs,
Oversight
&amp;
Government
Reform,
and
Judiciary
committees.
Economic
Growth
and
Job
Creation
1.
Domestic
energy
production.
The
House
passed
a
series
of
bills designed
to
expand
the
production
of
energy
in
the
United
States
and
in
North
America.
The
bills
include
approval
of
the
Keystone
XL
pipeline,
reform
of
the
permitting
process
for
natural
gas
pipelines,
and
the
development
of
strategic
and
critical
mineral
production.
The
goal
of
these
measures
is
three-fold:
(i)
to
provide
more
opportunities
for
good-paying
jobs,
particularly
for
blue
collar
workers;
(ii)
to
put
a
downward
pressure
on
energy
prices,
thereby
benefiting
consumers
and
lowering
costs
for
businesses;
and
(iii)
to
enhance
national
security
by
making
the
United
States
less
dependent
on
&#8211;
and
hopefully
completely
independent
from
&#8211;
foreign
sources
of
energy.
The
Senate
did
not
take
up
any
of
these
bills,
or
any
similar
bills
that
would
boost
jobs
and
lower
energy
costs.
2.
Repeal,
Defund
and
Delay
of
ObamaCare.
The
biggest
story
of
2013
in
American
politics
was
the
unmasking
of
the
deception
used
to
engineer
passage
of
the
2010
health
care
law
known
as
ObamaCare.
Told
they
could
keep
their
health
plans,
keep
their
doctors,
and
would
see
their
insurance
premiums
fall,
Americans
realized
soon
after
the
program&#8217;s
October
1st
launch
that
none
of
it
was
true.
The
House
voted
at
various
times
to
repeal,
defund,
and/or
delay
the
law
to
mitigate
the
damage
the
law
is
causing
to
America&#8217;s
patients,
doctors,
and
health
care
system.
The
law
should
be
completely
replaced
with
a
patient-centered
reform
plan,
such
as
the
one
authored
by
Dr.
Tom
Price,
which
will
provide
access
to
affordable
health care coverage
for
all
Americans,
rein
in
out-of-control
costs,
solve
insurance
challenges
of
portability
and
pre-existing
illness,
and
improve
the
health
care
delivery
structure.
The
Senate
has
not
been
willing
to
advance
any
form
of
relief
from
ObamaCare
for
the
American
people.
3.
Infrastructure:
the
Water
Resources
Reform
and
Development
Act.
Improving
the
vital
ports
and
waterways
of
the
United
States
is
critical
for
economic
growth
and
for
America&#8217;s
global
economic
competitiveness.
The
WRRDA
bill
begins
to
reduce
the
bureaucracy
and
red
tape
that
stunts
development
of
water
resources
projects,
brings
more
transparency
to
the
process
of
project
development,
and
modernizes
the
water
resources
infrastructure
network.
Though
WRRDA
has
not
yet
been
signed
into
law,
I
expect
a
House-Senate
conference
to
produce
a
bill
that
will
be
enacted
in
early
2014.
4.
Legal
reform.
The
House
passed
two
bills
designed
to
reduce
the
costs
to
our
economy
associated
with
excessive
litigation.
The
Lawsuit
Abuse
Reduction
Act
adds
teeth
to
provisions
of
current
law
that
are
supposed
to
penalize
parties
who
bring
frivolous
lawsuits.
The
Innovation
Act
protects
businesses
&#8211;
especially
those
small
businesses
and
start-up
companies
who
are
least
likely
to
be
able
to
bear
the
costs
of
frivolous
lawsuits
&#8211;
from
groundless
patent
infringement
claims
brought
by
sue-happy
plaintiffs
known
as
patent
trolls.
These
bills
address
a
fundamental
problem
with
America&#8217;s
modern
legal
system:
the
cost
of
defending
against
baseless
claims
is
so
high
that
unscrupulous
plaintiffs
can
often
times
obtain
a
settlement
for
a
frivolous
claim
simply
because
defense
of
the
claim
is
so
expensive.
The
legal
system
should
be
used
to
rectify
harms,
not
as
a
means
to
extract
settlement
payments
for
unmeritorious
claims.
The
Senate
has
not
considered
either
of
these
bills,
or
any
bill
designed
to
reduce
the
costs
associated
with
litigation.
5.
SKILLS
Act.
This
bill
eliminates
failed
programs
and
empowers
states
to
consolidate
job
training
resources
to
best
equip
American
workers
with
the
skills
that
are
most
in
demand
by
employers.
The
Senate
has
not
considered
this
or
similar
legislation.
Reform
of
Government
and
the
Bureaucracy
1.
No
Budget,
No
Pay.
Both
houses
of
Congress
are
required
by
law
to
pass
a
budget
on
an
annual
basis,
but
until
this
year
the
Senate
had
not
passed
a
budget
in
several
years.
In
January,
the
House
passed
a
bill
linking
the
passage
of
a
budget
to
the
pay
of
lawmakers:
no
budget,
no
pay.
Under
the
threat
of
having
member
pay
withheld,
the
Senate,
lo
and
behold,
finally
decided
to
pass
a
budget
in
April.
2.
Stop
Government
Abuse
Act.
The
government
is
supposed
to
serve
We
the
People,
not
the
other
way
around.
Yet,
from
the
misdeeds
of
the
IRS
to
waste
of
taxpayer
money
by
bureaucrats
in
high
places,
it
is
clear
that
the
government
is
not
adequately
accountable
to
the
American
people.
The
Stop
Government
Abuse
Act
(i)
allows
citizens
to
record
meetings
and
phone
conversations
with
federal
bureaucrats,
(ii)
allows senior-level
executive
agency
employees
to
be
placed
on
investigative
leave
without
pay,
including
those
who
take
the
Fifth
Amendment
before
Congress
(iii)
enhances
termination
authority
so
that
reckless
government
employees
are
relieved
of
duty.
The
Senate
did
not
consider
this
bill,
or
any
similar
piece
of
legislation
designed
to
protect
citizens
from
government
abuse.
3.
Accountability
of
the
Bureaucracy.
The
Regulations
from
the
Executive
in
Need
of
Scrutiny
(REINS)
Act
brings
accountability
to
the
rules
constantly
imposed
on
society
by
unelected
executive
branch
officials
by
requiring
Congress
to
approve
all
rules
which
carry
a
cost
to
the
economy
of
$100
million
or
more.
This
brings
accountability
to
the
process
because
it
makes
Congress
responsible
for
major
rules
that
have
a
dramatic
effect
on
society.
4.
Keep
the
IRS
Off
Your
Healthcare
Act.
This
bill
prohibits
the
IRS
from
implementing
or
enforcing
any
aspect
of
ObamaCare.
The
IRS
should
not
be
involved
in
the
health
care
of
the
American
people
at
all,
let
alone
in
the
intrusive
fashion
as
mandated
by
ObamaCare.
Welfare
reform
1.
Preserving
Welfare
Work
Requirements.
The
House
passed
a
bill
that,
among
other
things,
prevents
the
executive
branch
from
waiving
the
work
requirements
that
serve
as
the
foundation
for
the
1996
welfare
reform
law.
Welfare
programs
should
be
a
second
chance,
not
a
way
of
life;
all
programs
should
incentivize
work
and
personal
responsibility.
2.
Food
Stamp
Reform.
According
to
official
statistics,
the
recession
ended
in
2009,
yet
food
stamp
use
has
continued
to
increase
over
the
last
several
years.
The
program
is
supposed
to
provide
nutrition
assistance
to
those
who
cannot
fend
for
themselves;
it
should
not
be
used
as
a
means
of
relieving
anybody
of
personal
responsibility.
The
two
key
reforms
included
in
the
House
reform
bill
are
(i)
allowing
states
to
require
able-bodied
adults
with
no
dependents
to
work
or
look
for
work
as
a
condition
of
receiving
taxpayer-financed
assistance,
and
(ii)
limiting
food
stamp
assistance
to
those
individuals
who
satisfy
the
income
limitations.
These
reforms
will
save
money
for
taxpayers;
they
will
also
reform
the
program
to
make
it
serve
the
needs
of
the
American
people.
