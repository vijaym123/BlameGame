Dear Friend,
You may have heard that the House passed a budget deal yesterday. I
could not support it, and I'd like to share with you why.
I came to Washington to cut spending and tackle the hard issues that
are saddling our future generations with mountains of debt. But this
bill increases spending by $63 billion over the next two years, with
only the promise of cuts in the future.
I don't think we can rely on such promises because they just don't seem
to pan out.
Congress also promised to cut spending with the spending
caps established by the Budget Control Act - and this very deal
violates those limits.
The vote last night was just another example of how broken Washington
is. When our nation is over 17 trillion dollars in debt, we simply can't
continue these same reckless spending habits. More government spending
doesn't solve the problem - it is the problem.
Sincerely,
George Holding
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
You
may
have
heard
that
the
House
passed
a
budget
deal
yesterday.
I
could
not
support
it,
and
I'd
like
to
share
with
you
why.
I came
to
Washington
to
cut
spending
and
tackle
the
hard
issues
that
are
saddling
our
future
generations
with
mountains
of
debt.
But
this
bill
increases
spending
by
$63
billion
over
the
next
two
years,
with
only
the
promise
of
cuts
in
the
future.
I
don&#8217;t
think
we
can
rely
on
such
promises
because
they
just
don&#8217;t
seem
to
pan
out.
Congress
also
promised
to
cut
spending
with
the
spending
caps
established
by
the
Budget
Control
Act
-
and
this
very
deal
violates
those
limits.
The

last
night
was
just
another
example
of
how
broken
Washington
is.
When
our
nation
is
over
17
trillion
dollars
in
debt,
we
simply
can&#8217;t
continue
these
same
reckless
spending
habits.
More
government
spending
doesn't
solve
the
problem
-
it
is
the
problem. Sincerely, George
