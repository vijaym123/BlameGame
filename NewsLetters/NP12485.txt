Shareholders' Annual Review & Rating
It's hard to believe we're already a month into 2014, but it has indeed
been a busy first month! Before we go too much further, just as
businesses give their shareholders an annual review of their
performance, I wanted to share an "end of the year" review of all that
we worked on in the months we have had in Washington.
Here are a few of the debates and issues that have marked our time in
DC since May:
The Ryan-Murray budget deal
: In December, Congress
passed a budget deal which was followed by an omnibus spending bill
just a few weeks ago. Both agreements removed tools for financial
discipline that were already in place, while increasing spending now
and promising to pay for it later. I wasn't convinced that this was the
best approach, and opposed both pieces of legislation.
The government shutdown
: The shutdown was in many ways the biggest news story in Washington
over the last couple of months. I laid out my concerns with the broken
budget process in Congress and the constitutional implications of the
way the Affordable Health Care Act was being implemented in a few
newsletters (which you can read here
and here
). I also objected to Congress writing the White House a blank check
for raising the debt ceiling, and spoke on the House floor
about my concerns that the executive branch was overstepping its
authority in a number of ways during the shutdown.
The NSA and civil liberties: As information has trickled out over the
last few months about ways the National Security Agency is overstepping
their Constitutional limits, I took action and introduced a bill
with over 30 of my colleagues that
would bring reform to the NSA. I also joined the fight to protect civil
liberties by signing on to an amicus brief
requesting the release of secret
court opinions regarding surveillance requests, and co-sponsored the
LIBERT-E Act and the USA Freedom Act.
The Farm Bill
: Over the summer, the
House took up a new Farm Bill which sought to eliminate direct
subsidies to farmers, but the resulting crop insurance program could
end up costing taxpayers a whole lot more because crop prices are at
historic highs - when they drop to the average from here, taxpayers
will be on the hook. In the first few weeks of 2014, Congress again
took up this issue, and I wrote here
about why I still don't think this final version of
the Farm Bill went far enough in addressing this and other problems.
Flood insurance: Many in the Lowcountry have contacted me regarding
how reforms to the National Flood Insurance Program made by the
Biggert-Waters Act of 2012 are going to affect them. In most cases, the
changes in premiums have been sudden and drastic, leading myself and
others in Congress to work towards reforming the program. While
Biggert-Waters was well-intentioned, I think the government needs to
give people time to adapt to these sorts of changes. To this end, I
co-sponsored the Homeowner's Flood Insurance Affordability Act
because it provided a path to continue the conversation about how to
mitigate these effects while still bringing needed change to the NFIP.
Syria: When questions arose over the use of force in Syria in early
September, I spoke out against it (click here
and here
to see those interviews) and signed onto legislation
that would require the executive branch to consult with Congress before
taking any military actions.
WRRDA: I supported the Water Resources Reform and Development Act
because it took important steps not only for infrastructure, but for
ensuring that Congress, not the executive branch, is in charge of
determining spending priorities. The bill passed without earmarks and
was a good first step toward building a strong system for developing
and funding projects like the harbor deepening at the Port of
Charleston.
Local Issues: Though it's been a point of some contention over the
last few weeks, I ultimately think the idea of representation means
hearing from the people you work for and being active and vocal on the
issues they care about. As such, after hearing overwhelmingly from
people all around the Lowcountry, I voiced my opposition to removing
the trees on I-26
and to giving
special treatment to one business over others
as we're seeing
with the proposed Bass Pro Shops in North Charleston.
While this is by no means an exhaustive list of the many things we
worked on over the last few months, I think it touches upon some of the
particularly relevant issues to the Lowcountry. There are many issues
we'll be grappling with ahead, many of which the President touched on
in his State of the Union last Tuesday night. While I was encouraged to
see that we share some common themes, I wrote here about my concerns
that the President is taking all too short a
view of our nation's financial future.
Ultimately, however, that's a conversation for another newsletter! In
the meantime, if you have thoughts on what we've been working on or any
questions or concerns, please reach out by emailing me here
. Also in this year, I want to do a better
job of connecting with the people I represent, and for that reason, I'd
hope that you'd forward this newsletter along to your friends or family
who may be interested! If this newsletter was passed along to you, you

Shareholders&#8217;
Annual
Review
&amp;
Rating
It&#8217;s
hard
to
believe
we&#8217;re
already
a
month
into
2014,
but
it
has
indeed
been
a
busy
first
month!
Before
we
go
too
much
further,
just
as
businesses
give
their
shareholders
an
annual
review
of
their
performance,
I
wanted
to
share
an
&#8220;end
of
the
year&#8221;
review
of
all
that
we
worked
on
in
the
months
we
have
had
in
Washington.
Here
are
a
few
of
the
debates
and
issues
that
have
marked
our
time
in
DC
since
May:
&#8226;
The
Ryan-Murray
budget
deal :
In
December,
Congress
passed
a
budget
deal
which
was
followed
by
an
omnibus
spending
bill
just
a
few
weeks
ago.
Both
agreements
removed
tools
for
financial
discipline
that
were
already
in
place,
while
increasing
spending
now
and
promising
to
pay
for
it
later.
I
wasn&#8217;t
convinced
that
this
was
the
best
approach,
and
opposed
both
pieces
of
legislation.
&#8226;
The
government
shutdown :
The
shutdown
was
in
many
ways
the
biggest
news
story
in
Washington
over
the
last
couple
of
months.
I
laid
out
my
concerns
with
the
broken
budget
process
in
Congress
and
the
constitutional
implications
of
the
way
the
Affordable
Health
Care
Act
was
being
implemented
in
a
few
newsletters
(which
you
can
read
here
and
here ).
I
also
objected
to
Congress
writing
the
White
House
a
blank
check
for
raising
the
debt
ceiling,
and
spoke
on
the
House
floor
about
my
concerns
that
the
executive
branch
was
overstepping
its
authority
in
a
number
of
ways
during
the
shutdown.
&#8226; The
NSA
and
civil
liberties:
As
information
has
trickled
out
over
the
last
few
months
about
ways
the
National
Security
Agency
is
overstepping
their
Constitutional
limits,
I
took
action
and
introduced
a
bill
with
over
30
of
my
colleagues
that
would
bring
reform
to
the
NSA.
I
also
joined
the
fight
to
protect
civil
liberties
by
signing
on
to
an
amicus
brief
requesting
the
release
of
secret
court
opinions
regarding
surveillance
requests,
and
co-sponsored
the
LIBERT-E
Act
and
the
USA
Freedom
Act.
&#8226;
The
Farm
Bill :
Over
the
summer,
the
House
took
up
a
new
Farm
Bill
which
sought
to
eliminate
direct
subsidies
to
farmers,
but
the
resulting
crop
insurance
program
could
end
up
costing
taxpayers
a
whole
lot
more
because
crop
prices
are
at
historic
highs
&#8211;
when
they
drop
to
the
average
from
here,
taxpayers
will
be
on
the
hook.
In
the
first
few
weeks
of
2014,
Congress
again
took
up
this
issue,
and
I
wrote
here
about
why
I
still
don&#8217;t
think
this
final
version
of
the
Farm
Bill
went
far
enough
in
addressing
this
and
other
problems.
&#8226; Flood
insurance:
Many
in
the
Lowcountry
have
contacted
me
regarding
how
reforms
to
the
National
Flood
Insurance
Program
made
by
the
Biggert-Waters
Act
of
2012
are
going
to
affect
them.
In
most
cases,
the
changes
in
premiums
have
been
sudden
and
drastic,
leading
myself
and
others
in
Congress
to
work
towards
reforming
the
program.
While
Biggert-Waters
was
well-intentioned,
I
think
the
government
needs
to
give
people
time
to
adapt
to
these
sorts
of
changes.
To
this
end,
I
co-sponsored
the
Homeowner&#8217;s
Flood
Insurance
Affordability
Act
because
it
provided
a
path
to
continue
the
conversation
about
how
to
mitigate
these
effects
while
still
bringing
needed
change
to
the
NFIP.
&#8226; Syria:
When
questions
arose
over
the
use
of
force
in
Syria
in
early
September,
I
spoke
out
against
it
(click
here
and
here
to
see
those
interviews)
and
signed
onto
legislation
that
would
require
the
executive
branch
to
consult
with
Congress
before
taking
any
military
actions.
&#8226; WRRDA:
I
supported
the
Water
Resources
Reform
and
Development
Act
because
it
took
important
steps
not
only
for
infrastructure,
but
for
ensuring
that
Congress,
not
the
executive
branch,
is
in
charge
of
determining
spending
priorities.
The
bill
passed
without
earmarks
and
was
a
good
first
step
toward
building
a
strong
system
for
developing
and
funding
projects
like
the
harbor
deepening
at
the
Port
of
Charleston.
&#8226; Local
Issues:
Though
it&#8217;s
been
a
point
of
some
contention
over
the
last
few
weeks,
I
ultimately
think
the
idea
of
representation
means
hearing
from
the
people
you
work
for
and
being
active
and
vocal
on
the
issues
they
care
about.
As
such,
after
hearing
overwhelmingly
from
people
all
around
the
Lowcountry,
I
voiced
my
opposition
to
removing
the
trees
on
I-26
and
to
giving
special
treatment
to
one
business
over
others
as
we&#8217;re
seeing
with
the
proposed
Bass
Pro
Shops
in
North
Charleston.
While
this
is
by
no
means
an
exhaustive
list
of
the
many
things
we
worked
on
over
the
last
few
months,
I
think
it
touches
upon
some
of
the
particularly
relevant
issues
to
the
Lowcountry.
There
are
many
issues
we&#8217;ll
be
grappling
with
ahead,
many
of
which
the
President
touched
on
in
his
State
of
the
Union
last
Tuesday
night.
While
I
was
encouraged
to
see
that
we
share
some
common
themes,
I
wrote
here
about
my
concerns
that
the
President
is
taking
all
too
short
a
view
of
our
nation&#8217;s
financial
future.
Ultimately,
however,
that&#8217;s
a
conversation
for
another
newsletter!
In
the
meantime,
if
you
have
thoughts
on
what
we&#8217;ve
been
working
on
or
any
questions
or
concerns,
please
reach
out
by
emailing
me
here .
Also
in
this
year,
I
want
to
do
a
better
job
of
connecting
with
the
people
I
represent,
and
for
that
reason,
I&#8217;d
hope
that
you&#8217;d
forward
this
newsletter
along
to
your
friends
or
family
who
may
be
