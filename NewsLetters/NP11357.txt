Five Tips to Help you Save This Tax Season
Every year, countless Americans from all walks of life miss out on
important, cost-saving opportunities, as they navigate the federal tax
code and file their annual tax returns. As the April 15th filing
deadline approaches, here are five tips from the IRS to help you save
more this spring.
1. Itemizing vs. Standard Deduction: When filing your tax return, you
usually have a choice between whether to itemize or take the standard
deduction. Before choosing, it's a good idea to figure out your
deductions using both methods. Then, choose the one that allows you to
pay the lowest amount. The one that results in the higher deduction
amount often gives you the most benefit. For more tips on how to
choose, click here.
2. Special Exclusion for Cancelled Home Mortgage Debt: If a lender
cancels or forgives money you owe, you usually have to pay tax on that
amount. But when it comes to your home, an important exemption to this
rule may apply in 2013. Click here to learn about those exemptions.
3. Free Tax Help for Military Families: The IRS provides free tax help
to military members and their families through its Volunteer Income Tax
Assistance program. VITA offers free tax preparation and e-filing at
sites both on and off base. It also has sites to help our military
overseas. Click here to learn more about free tax assistance for the
military.
4. Five Credits That Can Reduce Your Taxes: Tax credits help reduce the
taxes you owe. Some credits are also refundable. That means that even
if you owe no tax, you may still get a refund. Five credits you
shouldn't overlook when filing your tax return include:
1. The Earned Income Tax Credit
2. The Child and Dependent Care Credit
3. The Child Tax Credit
4. The Saver's Credit
5. The American Opportunity Tax Credit.
To learn more about the potential savings from each of these tax
credits click here.

tips and tools that will help you save money this tax season.
