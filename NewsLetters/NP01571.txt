IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL: It is welcome news that the U.S., it's international partners, and Iran have agreed on a framework deal to limit Iran's nuclear program. While some of my colleagues have objected to negotiations with Iran, it must be noted that thanks to these historic diplomatic efforts the world is further from a nuclear-armed Iran and the risk of war over this issue. For more, click HERE .
THE RIGHT THING TO DO: I'm pleased to lend my support of efforts to ensure that America's immigration laws reflect American values by joining 180 House Democrats in filing an amicus brief in support of the Obama Administration's appeal in the Fifth Circuit case of Texas v. United States. For more, click HERE .
COMCAST HIGH-SPEED: Another company announced deployment of high-speed fiber Internet services in the Fourth District. The new 2 gigabit-per-second service will be 200-times faster than the national average for Internet speeds. For more, click HERE .
SENSELESS SHOOTINGS: I am saddened by the senseless killing of Walter Scott in South Carolina. The criminal justice reform bills I have introduced during this session of Congress aim to prevent murders like this from happening. For more on my demilitarization bill, click HERE . For more on my Grand Jury Reform Act, click HERE . For more on my Police Accountability bill, click HERE .
