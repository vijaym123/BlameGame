New Congress and New Digital Resources for Constituents in the 18th
Congressional District
Dear Constituents,
The 114th Congress has convened and hopefully changes are afoot. I have
a strong sense that new and returning Members have a renewed commitment
to collaborate, which is so necessary to governance for the sake of our
country's future.
The new Congress also brings something new and improved for my
constituents. My office recently launched a completely redesigned and
revamped website
to serve you better.
I take great pride in my office's efforts to respond to you in a
timely, comprehensive, and personal manner to your questions and
concerns regarding issues. We've also worked to keep you updated on my
current work in Congress via our e-newsletters, as well as holding
Telephone Town Hall Meetings in every community across our district on
a consistent basis throughout the year.
Here's what's new:
*	Constituent Services We started from the 'ground up' to deliver
a new streamlined process for requesting a variety of constituent
services offered by my office. From requesting a flag, making requests
for tours for an upcoming visit to Washington, D.C., seeking assistance
for passports or immigration cases, or applying for a student
internship, the new 'Constituent Services' section of the website makes
requesting assistance from my office much easier and almost entirely
digitized.
*	Staying Up to Date We've fully integrated all of my social
media platforms, including Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, into a new
front page design that will keep you up to speed on what I'm saying
about current issues and what I'm advocating for in Congress. We've
also made it easier to sign up to receive my e-newsletters by allowing
you to use your Facebook credentials.
*	Easy-to-Use Design The new design of the website is cleaner and
modernized to help users get to the information and resources they
need. It will work just as well on your smartphone as it will on your
desktop. And you'll still be able to find all the same information from
my old website, including my voting record, committee assignments,
press releases, and legislative resources.
Visit the new website
, explore its features, and let me know what you think. I want
to continue improving your access to me and your Congressional Office.
I wish you every blessing in the New Year.
It's a privilege and honor
to represent you.
All my best,
Anna G. Eshoo

New
Congress
and
New
Digital
Resources
for
Constituents
in
the
18th
Congressional
District
Dear
Constituents,
The
114th
Congress
has
convened
and
hopefully
changes
are
afoot.
I
have
a
strong
sense
that
new
and
returning
Members
have
a
renewed
commitment
to
collaborate,
which
is
so
necessary
to
governance
for
the
sake
of
our
country's
future.
The
new
Congress
also
brings
something
new
and
improved
for
my
constituents. My
office
recently launched
a
completely
redesigned
and
revamped
website
to
serve
you
better.
I
take
great
pride
in
my
office's
efforts
to
respond
to
you
in
a
timely,
comprehensive,
and
personal
manner
to
your
questions
and
concerns
regarding
issues.
We've
also
worked
to
keep
you
updated
on
my
current
work
in
Congress
via
our
e-newsletters,
as
well
as
holding
Telephone
Town
Hall
Meetings
in
every
community
across
our
district
on
a
consistent
basis
throughout
the
year.
Here's
what's
new:
Constituent
Services
We
started
from
the
'ground
up'
to
deliver
a
new
streamlined
process
for
requesting
a
variety
of
constituent
services
offered
by
my
office.
From
requesting
a
flag,
making
requests
for
tours
for
an
upcoming
visit
to
Washington,
D.C.,
seeking
assistance
for
passports
or
immigration
cases,
or
applying
for
a
student
internship,
the
new
'Constituent
Services'
section
of
the
website
makes
requesting
assistance
from
my
office
much
easier
and
almost
entirely
digitized.
Staying
Up
to
Date
We've
fully
integrated
all
of
my
social
media
platforms,
including
Twitter,
Instagram
and
Facebook,
into
a
new
front
page
design
that
will
keep
you
up
to
speed
on
what
I'm
saying
about
current
issues
and
what
I'm
advocating
for
in
Congress.
We've
also
made
it
easier
to
sign
up
to
receive
my
e-newsletters
by
allowing
you
to
use
your
Facebook
credentials.
Easy-to-Use
Design
The
new
design
of
the
website
is
cleaner
and
modernized
to
help
users
get
to
the
information
and
resources
they
need.
It
will
work
just
as

on
your
smartphone
as
it
will
on
your
desktop.
And
you'll
still
be
able
to
find
all
the
same
information
from
my
old
website,
including
my
voting
record,
committee
assignments,
press
releases,
and
legislative
resources.
Visit
the
new
website ,
explore
its
features,
and
let
me
know
what
you
think.
I
want
to
continue
improving
your
access
to
me
and
your
Congressional
Office.
I
wish
you
every
blessing
in
the
New
Year.
It's
a privilege
and
honor
to
represent
you.
All
my
best,
