Dear Friend,
Thank you for taking the time to read this week's eNewsletter. I hope
you find these updates interesting and informative. As your voice in
Congress, I depend on you to keep me informed about issues that concern
you and your family. The best way to get in touch with me is to send me
an email by clicking here.
Building a healthy economy and connecting people with good-paying jobs
is my top priority in Congress. While that can be done through
legislation, it can also be accomplished through engagement with the
local community. To that end, I am hosting a job fair and career skills
workshop
on March 17 at the
Silverton Hotel and Casino on Blue Diamond Road. The job fair starts at
10am and will feature more than 40 employers looking to hire. If you or
someone you know is looking for a job, or wants to try to find a better
job, please join us on the 17th. Give my local office a call at
702-387-4941 if you need more information.
If you would like to keep up with my very latest work in Nevada and in
Washington, I urge you to connect with me on social media.
I am on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube,
and Pinterest as Rep. Joe Heck.
I hope you'll keep reading to see what I have been up to lately. It
remains an honor and a privilege to serve you in the House of
Representatives.
Sincerely,
- Joe

Keeping the focus on jobs and the economy
Economic improvement and job creation through increased travel and
tourism is one of my top legislative priorities. Currently I am working
to advance a bill called the JOLT Act which already has more than 100
bipartisan cosponsors in the House. The bill enjoys broad support for
several reasons: every district in the country benefits from travel and
tourism, either directly or indirectly; it provides a long-term
solution to building a healthy economy by making visa processing more
efficient and effective; it provides all of these benefits at no cost
to taxpayers.
I recently joined my colleague and lead Democratic sponsor of the JOLT
Act, Rep. Mike Quigley of Chicago, in writing an op-ed on our bill and
why we need to pass it through the House this year. Please take a few
minutes to read it. You can access it online by clicking here.
My Week in the District
During the most recent District Work Period I spent much of my time
meeting with constituents and visiting local businesses. Below you will
find some highlights of my work in Nevada.
I visited Expedia.com's Nevada-based call center to talk with employees
about the online travel industry. Expedia is the world's leading online
travel booking company and is a parent corporation to online travel
booking sites Hotels.com and Hotwire.com. I was impressed to learn that
Expedia books four million room nights in Nevada per year, accounting
for 12% of all Nevada business!
Nevada's Third District is home to Varian Medical Systems' world-wide
training center. Varian is the world's leading manufacturer of medical
devices and software for treating cancer and also supplies X-ray
imaging products for cargo screening and industrial inspection. As
someone who has worked extensively in both the health care and homeland
security fields, I find the innovative work done at Varian encouraging
and their products are improving healthcare in the United States and
helping keep Americans safe from homeland security threats.
Imperial Truck and Auto Center is a local small business specializing
in auto repair. I visited their shop in Henderson to talk about the
repair business and issues facing local small businesses. I met the
owner, Loren, and we discussed his concerns over healthcare costs for
his employees: despite a doubling of the premium cost due to ObamaCare,
he is still covering 100% of employee insurance costs. I am concerned
that high health care costs will continue to impact small businesses
like Loren's by delaying opportunities to expand their business and
reducing their ability to purchase and upgrade equipment necessary to
stay competitive.
Finally, I held a town hall meeting for constituents at Green Valley
High School in Henderson. The purpose of this event was to have a
constructive dialogue with constituents about their concerns, share my
positions with them, and update them on issues affecting Nevada and the
nation. We had a great turnout for the town hall and discussed issues
like jobs and the economy, immigration, healthcare, and national
security.

My
Week
in
the
District
During
the
most
recent
District
Work
Period
I
spent
much
of
my
time
meeting
with
constituents
and
visiting
local
businesses.
Below
you
will
find
some
highlights
of
my
work
in
Nevada.
I
visited
Expedia.com's
Nevada-based
call
center
to
talk
with
employees
about
the
online
travel
industry.
Expedia
is
the
world&#8217;s
leading
online
travel
booking
company
and
is
a
parent
corporation
to
online
travel
booking
sites
Hotels.com
and
Hotwire.com.
I
was
impressed
to
learn
that
Expedia
books
four
million
room
nights
in
Nevada
per
year,
accounting
for
12%
of
all
Nevada
business!
Nevada's
Third
District
is
home
to
Varian
Medical
Systems'
world-wide
training
center.
Varian
is
the
world's
leading
manufacturer
of
medical
devices
and
software
for
treating
cancer
and
also
supplies
X-ray
imaging
products
for
cargo
screening
and
industrial
inspection.
As
someone
who
has
worked
extensively
in
both
the
health
care
and
homeland
security
fields,
I
find
the
innovative
work
done
at
Varian
encouraging
and
their
products
are
improving
healthcare
in
the
United
States
and
helping
keep
Americans
safe
from
homeland
security
threats.
Imperial
Truck
and
Auto
Center
is
a
local
small
business
specializing
in
auto
repair.
I
visited
their
shop
in
Henderson
to
talk
about
the
repair
business
and
issues
facing
local
small
businesses.
I
met
the
owner,
Loren,
and
we
discussed
his
concerns
over
healthcare
costs
for
his
employees:
despite
a
doubling
of
the
premium
cost
due
to
ObamaCare,
he
is
still
covering
100%
of
employee
insurance
costs.
I
am
concerned
that
high
health
care
costs
will
continue
to
impact
small
businesses
like
Loren&#8217;s
by
delaying
opportunities
to
expand
their
business
and
reducing
their
ability
to
purchase
and
upgrade
equipment
necessary
to
stay
competitive.
Finally,
I
held
a
town
hall
meeting
for
constituents
at
Green
Valley
High
School
in
Henderson.
The
purpose
of
this
event
was
to
have

with
constituents
about
their

share
my
positions
with
them,
and
update
them
on
issues
affecting
Nevada
and
the
nation.
We
had
a
great
turnout
for
the
town
hall
and
discussed
issues
like
jobs
and
the
economy,
immigration,
healthcare,
and
national
security.
