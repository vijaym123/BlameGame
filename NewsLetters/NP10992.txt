This week, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio
introduced legislation to hold the
Administration accountable by ensuring
taxpayers are protected from an ObamaCare
bailout. Marco, along with other Republican
leaders, fought to bring greater
accountability to the Department of
Veterans Affairs. He also introduced
legislation establishing greater
accountability for crimes against humanity
in Syria. Finally, he demanded answers from
the Administration on its recent
announcement regarding future governance of
the Internet.

Rubio Introduces Legislation To Hold
Administration Accountable, Protect
Taxpayers From Obamacare Bailout
Marco introduced
The ObamaCare
Taxpayer Bailout Protection Act
, legislation to hold the
Administration accountable by ensuring
ObamaCares risk-corridor provision
remains budget neutral, which would prevent
taxpayer dollars from being used to bailout
insurance companies.
This is Rubios latest attempt to
protect taxpayers from an ObamaCare bailout
after introducing
The ObamaCare
Taxpayer Bailout Prevention Act
in November.
Under ObamaCares section 1342,
risk corridors were established for the
laws first three years as a safety
net for insurers who experience financial
losses, needlessly exposing taxpayers to
funding a bailout of insurance companies.
Earlier this
month
, the Obama administration announced a
new rule to operate the risk
corridors program in a budget neutral
manner. Rubios bill holds the
Administration accountable by requiring
that ObamaCares risk corridors
ensure budget neutrality.
From rising health care costs
to loss of coverage, millions of
Americans have already been hurt by
ObamaCare. We cannot allow a
taxpayer-funded bailout to be the
American peoples next
hardship,
said Rubio . The
Administrations excessive delays
and revisions of ObamaCare cannot
transform the law into a success, and
taxpayers cannot be expected to foot the
bill for Washingtons mistakes when
the law fails.
This provision holds the
Administration to its word and takes a
common sense approach to guaranteeing
taxpayers are protected from further
paying for a reckless and irresponsible
law that should never have been passed in
the first place,
added Rubio .
Marco discussed ObamaCares
failures on FOX News
Hannity.
Rubio Fights To Reform Veterans
Affairs With Boehner, Miller, Veterans
Groups
On Thursday, Marco joined House Speaker
John Boehner (R-OH), Representative Jeff
Miller (R-FL) and representatives of
several veterans service
organizations at
a press
event
to call on Congress to pass
legislation
sponsored by Rubio in the Senate and
Miller in the House
that would bring greater
accountability to the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) for meeting the needs
of Americas veterans, including its
disability claims backlog.
As Congressman Miller
outlineda moment ago, the vast
majority of the caseworkwe're now
getting in our offices inFlorida
a significant majority of
the casework were now getting
is related to Veterans
Affairsand to the inability of
thisdepartment to effectively
andaccountably deliver
theservices that these men
andwomen have earned through
theirservice to our country,
said Rubio . What this bill
does is
prettystraightforward.It
allows the secretary of
thedepartment to be able to
fireand hold accountable
seniorexecutive officials within
thedepartment, when in fact
there'sbreakdown in
accountability.Its the exact
same thing thatexists in the
private sector.It exists in our
congressionaloffices, but it does
not existin a government agency of
thisimportance.
Let me reiterate what's
alreadybeen said: The enormous and
vast majority of the300,000 men and
women who workin this agency, work
hard and doa great job.But
like any organization, there'sgoing
to be breakdowns. And whenthere
are, people need to beheld
accountable, especially atthe
senior management level,
added Rubio . And so I hope
that the House acts onthis measure,
that in the Senate,my colleagues
across the aislewill see the
importance of itand act quickly as
well.

Rubio, Cardin Introduce Syrian War
Crimes Accountability Act Of 2014
Marco and Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD),
both members of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, introduced the
Syrian War Crimes
Accountability Act of 2014,
legislation establishing a
Syria-specific standard of reporting and
accountability for crimes against humanity.
The bill would require the U.S. State
Department to report to relevant
congressional committees on war crimes and
crimes against humanity committed in Syria.
This would include an account of war crimes
and crimes against humanity committed by
both the regime of President Bashar
al-Assad and violent extremist groups and
other combatants involved in the conflict.
The report also requires a description of
U.S. government efforts to ensure
accountability for human rights violations
in Syria.
For far too long the Assad
regime and violent extremists in Syria
have committed horrific human rights
violations at the expense of millions of
innocent Syrians,
said Rubio . These brutal
crimes against civilians are appalling.
The perpetrators deserve to be brought to
justice, and this bill is a first step
towards ensuring those responsible for
human rights abuses are held
accountable.
On Tuesday,
The Syrian
Humanitarian Resolution of 2014
, introduced by Marco last month, was
unanimously approved by the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.
Rubio, Thune Demand Answers From
Administration On Internet Transition
Marco and Senator John Thune (R-SD),
along with 33 of their Senate Republican
colleagues, sent a letter to Assistant
Secretary of Commerce Larry Strickling,
head of the National Telecommunications and
Information Administration (NTIA), seeking
clarification regarding the recent
announcement that NTIA intends to
relinquish responsibility of the Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions
to the global multistakeholder
community.
The letter expresses strong support for
the existing bottom-up,
multistakeholder approach to the Internet
governance, and
cautions:We must not allow the
IANA functions to fall under the control of
repressive governments, Americas
enemies, or unaccountable
bureaucrats.
The letter goes on to say: The
global community of Internet stakeholders
should act deliberately and transparently
as it formulates a possible proposal to
transition the IANA functions to a
nongovernmental entity.The
multistakeholder model of Internet
governance and the IANA functions are far
too important for this process to be rushed
or to be done behind closed
doors.
Among other things, the letter asks the
administration to explain why it is
in our national interest to transition the
IANA functions, and how NTIA will
ensure the IANA functions do not end
up being controlled, directly or
indirectly, by a government or
inter-governmental entity.
In 2012, Congress unanimously passed a
resolution
sponsored by Senator Rubio expressing
support for the bottom-up,
multi-stakeholder model that currently
governs the Internet and for an Internet
free from government control.
Constituent Casework Corner
A South Florida nonprofit organization
created to serve veterans applied for their
501(c)(3) status with the Internal Revenue
Service last summer and received a notice
that it would take 90 days to process.
After six months of inactivity, the group
contacted Senator Rubio for assistance. A
member of the staff contacted the agency to
follow up on the status of the application.
The agency confirmed that there is a 12
month delay to review this type of
application. However, due to the
miscommunication and notice indicating only
a 90 day review period, they agreed to
expeditiously review the application. The
application was subsequently approved.
