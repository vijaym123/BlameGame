Rokita Readings
A clickable offering of books and articles that I've read recently and
highly recommend, as we strive together to "Keep the Republic."
Featured in this week's Rokita Readings is a unique selection.
A
doctor friend of mine in Indiana forwarded me a letter from one of his
colleagues in Maine.
The letter was addressed to his colleague's
Senator, Angus King, of Maine.
Normally, this space is reserved for a
thought-provoking article or book, but this letter meets that standard.
This is the real-world impact of ObamaCare and government run health
care on the medical profession.
The doctor-patient relationship is the
most important element in our health care system and it is now gravely
threatened by this insidious law.

Poverty Reforms are About Effectively Using Taxpayer Money - House
Budget Hearing on the War on Poverty
This week, the House Budget Committee
held a hearing titled "A Progress Report on the War on Poverty:
Lessons from the Front Line.
"
The hearing focused on the results of
government programs to combat poverty, and the successful efforts of
community leaders and charities are having in the War on Poverty.
My exchange with the witnesses focused on lifting Americans out of
poverty-giving a hand up instead of a hand out-focused on empowerment
and measuring the bad results of government programs.
I pointed out
the continued rise in spending on health care, particularly Medicaid,
as well as food and nutrition programs, and education.
While spending
has skyrocketed in recent years, outcomes have not improved, and in
many ways gotten worse.
You can watch my exchange with witnesses here
.
For more information on the hearing, or to watch the entire webcast,
visit the Budget Committee website
.
Earlier this month, the House passed a budget, which I wrote with my
Budget Committee colleagues, that addresses these concerns and focuses
on empowering people to build better lives for themselves, as opposed
to building a bigger government.

Fighting VA Bureaucracy, Supporting our Veterans
On Wednesday, the House passed the funding bill for the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) and Military Construction and Related Agencies
for FY2015.
Veterans ought to expect timely and effective care.
Reports of
backlogs at VA medical facilities over the last few years are
unacceptable.
This bill increases congressional oversight of the VA to
bolster accountability, and it also targets funding to address other
areas of concern in veterans' health care including mental health
services, homeless veterans programs, and rural health initiatives.
In addition to fulfilling our promises to our veterans, this bill
increases support for our active-duty troops and their families by
prioritizing funding for military facilities and infrastructure.

Thank you for your continued interest in Congress and for supporting my
efforts in Washington. Take care.
Sincerely,
Todd Rokita

Fighting

On

years
are

increases
congressional
oversight
