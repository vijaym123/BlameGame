Congressman McHenry Weekly Update
Is Healthcare.gov Working for You?
November 30th marked the date when President Obama and the Department of Health and Human Services said that Healthcare.gov would be working for the vast majority of Americans.
However this week I have continued to see news stories, like this one from the
Washington Post , claiming that many Americans are still having issues with access to the website.
More disturbingly, they are having issues confirming whether or not they have actually enrolled in a healthcare plan.
With this in mind, I want to know how the website is working for you.
Are you still having issues logging on?
Once logged on, have you been able to confirm enrollment in a plan?
Are the prices offered on the exchanges comparable to what you were paying before Obamacare?

10th District Service Academy Nominees
As a Member of Congress I have the pleasure each year of nominating young men and women from across the 10th District for acceptance to our nation's service academies.
The young people who attend the service academies are the best this country has to offer and the ten nominees I have put forward from the 10th District are no exception.
I was able to interview each of these students last month and I am proud each will serve as a representative of Western North Carolina at their academy.
By clicking the image below you can view the press release from my office announcing this year's nominees from the 10th District.

House Passes the Innovation Act
This week I voted with a bipartisan majority in the House of Representatives to pass H.R. 3309, the Innovation Act.
This legislation is designed to protect American innovation by reforming our nation's patent system.
Under our current system, frivolous lawsuits can be brought against small businesses and startups attempting to obtain patents.
These lawsuits an tie up their much-needed resources in endless litigation.
This legislation would bring commonsense reforms to the patent system, making it easier for small businesses to obtain patents thus promoting American innovation.
You can see the roll call for the vote

and can also read more about the legislation in this article from the
New York Times .

What I Have Been Reading
The Capitol Dome's 150th Anniversary
60 Minutes
This Monday we celebrated the 150th Anniversary of the Statue of Freedom being placed atop the U.S. Capitol's Dome thus marking its completion.
If you have ever had the privilege of visiting the Capitol and seeing the Dome in person, you know how impressive a structure it is.
The link above is to a segment on the history of the Dome from this past week's episode of 60 Minutes.
The video is about 12 minutes long but well worth your time.
America's Best College Towns
Travel &amp; Leisure Magazine
Asheville was recently featured in Travel &amp; Leisure's rankings of the best college towns in America, making it into the 8th spot on the list.
With the University of North Carolina at Asheville in the city and Montreat College and Warren Wilson College just to the east, Asheville has distinguished itself as a great place for higher education.
Nelson Mandela, rights activist, dies
USA Today
This week the world lost one of its most inspirational figures when former South African President Nelson Mandela passed away at the age of 95.
Mandela spent nearly 30 years in jail before leading South Africa to end its discriminatory apartheid system and establish democracy.
This article is a good retrospective on Mandela's life and his impact on South Africa and the world as a whole.
