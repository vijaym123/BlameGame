e-News Special Report
As
our offical Congressional delegation left Israel this morning,
President Obama was preparing to announce another "framework" nuclear
agreement with Iran.
While we have yet to see the critical details, I
share many of the concerns raised by Speaker Boehner:
The president says negotiators have cleared the basic threshold needed
to continue talks, but the parameters for a final deal represent an
alarming departure from the White Houses initial goals. My longtime
concerns about the parameters of this potential agreement remain, but my
immediate concern is the administration signaling it will provide
near-term sanctions relief.
Congress must be allowed to fully review
the details of any agreement before any sanctions are
lifted.
After visiting with our partners on the ground in the
Middle East this week, my concerns about Irans efforts to foment unrest,
brutal violence and terror have only grown. It would be nave to
suggest the Iranian regime will not continue to use its nuclear program,
and any economic relief, to further destabilize the
region.
In the weeks ahead, Republicans and Democrats in
Congress will continue to press this administration on the details of
these parameters and the tough questions that remain unanswered. We
will stand strong on behalf of the American people and everyone in the
Middle East who values freedom, security, and peace.
