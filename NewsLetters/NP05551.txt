***Illinois VOTER ALERT***
Illinois has been targeted by Obama-bashing Republican attacks.
David -- we need your help. Republicans&rsquo; new ads are filled with half-truths and downright deceptions.
We have field organizers on the ground getting the facts out to voters, but we need to raise $1O,OOO immediately to fight Republican lies and keep these smears from costing us the election.
This is URGENT -- we need 11 Democratic supporters from the 60659 zip code to respond immediately.
