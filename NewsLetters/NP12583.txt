Dear Friends,
What&rsquo;s fair is fair.
That&rsquo;s why I recently announced my support for the so-called &ldquo;Ohio Plan.&rdquo;
This plan would direct $200 million to Ohio communities from the recent settlement between the federal government and JPMorgan Chase, the Wall Street banking firm that helped cause the collapse of the U.S. housing market five years ago.
I think it&rsquo;s only fair that JPMorgan Chase and other banks make recompense to Ohio for the damage they caused as a result of the housing crisis.
The company has already admitted to overstating the value of its &ldquo;mortgage-backed securities.&rdquo;
Now it has an obligation to work together with the communities who were devastated by the crisis.
Our communities&mdash;including Cleveland, Lorain and Toledo&mdash;should not be forced to pay the price for JPMorgan&rsquo;s misdeeds.
The majority of the $200 million would be dedicated to demolition of structures that are now little more than magnets for criminal activity. The rest of the funds would go towards renovation and foreclosure prevention.
The &ldquo;Ohio Plan&rdquo; is not perfect and will not solve the problem overnight. But it&rsquo;s a start.
Sincerely,
U.S. Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur
