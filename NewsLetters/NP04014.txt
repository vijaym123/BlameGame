Friends,
I wanted to take this opportunity
to drop you a note on my latest project
to identify and eliminate waste, fraud
and abuse in the federal budget.
Yesterday, I released the
Science
of Splurging , a report highlighting
more than a dozen examples of wasteful
and egregious spending by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
including:
$1,100,000 to pay the salaries
of eight employees who were not working
due to being placed on administrative
leave
$3,500,000 to fund
Planning for Economic and Fiscal
Health workshops across the
country
$1,500,000 annually to store
out-of-date and unwanted publications
at an Ohio warehouse
$700,000 to attempt to reduce
methane emitted from pig flatulence in
Thailand
$900,000 in salary, benefits
and improper bonuses paid to an
oft-absent employee who fraudulently
claimed to be an agent of the Central
Intelligence Agency
After
reading the report , I'm sure you'll
agree that for an agency keen to regulate
every puddle from a rainstorm, the EPA
has proven itself remarkably inept when
it comes to managing its own affairs.
In my view, the EPA isnt
the only one to blame for the current
situation. The tried-and-true method of
holding agencies accountable has long
been the amendment process associated
with annual appropriations measures. You
may have heard my collegues and I refer
to this process as "regular order."
Sadly, with respect to the Senate getting
its work done on individual
appropriations bills, it would appear
that the practice has largely been given
up. Instead, Congress has come come to
rely on the blunt instruments of the
continuing resolution and omnibus
appropriations bill to keep the
government funded.
While it's easy to give the
appearance of addressing such waste in
hearings, interviews and press releases,
the truth is that as long as federal
funding remains on autopilot, agencies
such as the EPA will continue
largely unchecked
to waste
taxpayer funds with abandon. This is
simply unacceptable.
With the goal in mind of truly
eliminating wasteful spending, I have
made it a priority in the upcoming 114th
Congress to work to end to the practice
of handing out blank checks that come in
the form of omnibus appropriations bills
and continuing resolutions. Only then,
when the Senate returns to a process of
regular order, can Congress genuinely
restore accountability at the EPA and
every other agency across the federal
government.
Best,
Jeff
