The
New Congress
Tuesday afternoon, I was honored once
again to raise my right hand and swear to uphold the Constitution of
the United States.
With this simple, yet profound act, I began
another term as a member of Congress.
I am honored and
humbled to serve the people of New Jerseys 11 th
Congressional
District.
Once again, I pledge to continue to give my dedicated
and tireless best to this important job.
Of course, this is
not the first Congress to be seated during challenging times.
However, the tasks and responsibilities before us today are truly
daunting and must be met.
Despite news of an improving economy,
families and businesses are still stressed and strained.
From my
travels around my congressional district, I know many do not yet feel
that we are in the midst of any recovery. Household budgets are
stretched thin and people worry about rebuilding their investments,
protecting jobs and assuring their childrens future.
At the same
time, new threats to our national security, our interests and our allies
have emerged across the globe
from Russia, North Korea, Iran and
groups like ISIL and al Qaeda.
Lest anyone forget, we have
thousands of courageous men and women in uniform
all volunteers
engaged with the enemy in Afghanistan and Iraq.
My visit on Monday
to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda confirmed
that.
Once again, we find our nation at a crossroads.
Recognizing that we must change course, the American people chose to
elect a Republican Majority in both the House of Representatives and
the Senate. We understand our enhanced responsibility to govern
effectively and are looking forward to getting right to work on the peoples
priorities.
Saving American
Jobs
Obamacare has been a disaster for many New Jersey businesses
and employees. Tucked inside its 2,000+ pages is a provision that
reduces the definition of full-time employment to pressure more companies to
participate in the new law.
As a result, many employers have
been forced to reduce hours for part-time employees and shift some
full-time timers to part-time work. Of course, this damaging action hurts
struggling families, single parents and young Americans who need to
work.
As the one of the first legislative actions of the new
Congress, the House this week passed H.R. 30, the Save Americans Jobs
Act. The bill repeals the 30-hour definition of full-time employment
in the Affordable Care Act and restores the traditional 40-hour
definition.
Repealing this provision and restoring the
traditional understanding of a forty-hour work is necessary to protect
their paychecks.
By making this one of the first votes of the new
Congress, the House of Representatives is making clear our desire to
provide relief from the most egregious unintended consequences of this
law.

Hiring Heroes, Helping Small
Businesses
And, speaking of Obamacare, the House took additional action by passing
the Hire More Heroes Act.
This legislation
exempts veterans who are already receiving health care through DOD or
the VA from being counted toward the number of employees required by the
employer mandate under Obamacare. This will incentivize small
businesses to hire more veterans.
The men and women of our Armed
Forces make countless sacrifices every day to protect our freedom and
security.
We owe it to them to do everything in our power to
ensure they have the opportunity to earn a good living and care for their
families when their military service has ended.
By
exempting veterans who already have health coverage through the DOD or
the VA from the employer mandate in the Presidents health care law,
were making it easier for small businesses to hire and, at the same
time, helping more veterans find work.

More Heroes Act

Obamacare, Tax Season and the IRS
Tax season looms.
This year many filers will find the process even more tedious than in
the past because they will be asked to declare whether they comply
with the Affordable Care Act's "individual mandate." Obamacare allows
the IRS to levy a fine on many uninsured individuals.
