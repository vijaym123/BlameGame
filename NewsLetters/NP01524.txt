TA grant will assist Commonwealth respond to military EIS
The Department of the Interior has announced a technical assistance grant of $250,000 to the Commonwealths Office of the Governor to hire environmental experts to review the CNMI Joint Military Training Draft Environmental Impact Statement . Technical assistance funds are appropriated by Congress and allow the Department to respond to critical needs in the insular areas for which local funds are not available. In this case there is a critical need for expertise to evaluate plans to develop live-fire ranges and training areas on Tinian and Pagan as part of the U.S. militarys shift of forces in the Asia-Pacific region. For some time I have urged the Commonwealth government to appropriate funds for this purpose, but local funds are in short supply. I commend Governor Inos for recognizing the importance of obtaining expert advice on the planned build-up and for reaching out successfully for federal financial assistance. Interior also awarded $307,672 to the Commonwealth Department of Commerce to conduct a 2015 Household Income and Expenditure Survey and $87,385 to the Office of the Public Auditor to improve OPAs audit and investigative capacity.

To set up the SNAP Pilot Program that I included in the Agricultural Act of 2014, a team from Insight Policy Research has been looking at how to bring the Northern Mariana Islands into the national food stamp program. During their final data gathering visit to the NMI recently, the researchers briefed the congressional office on their progress. The SNAP Pilot Program includes $30.5 million for benefits for three years beginning this October. That money is in addition to the annual $12.148 million block grant the CNMI receives to help families put food on the table.
SNAP feasibility study nears completion
Six years of work to bring the full benefit of the national Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, to hungry families in the Northern Mariana Islands is nearing another milestone. Field work is finished; and Insight Policy Research, the consultants hired by the Department of Agriculture, can now begin drafting their report on what the NMI's SNAP Pilot Program will look like. A draft report is due this October 1 and a final report to Congress on February 7, 2016. The Pilot Program was authorized in the Agricultural Act of 2014, U.S. Public Law 113-79,
which we put together during the time I served on the House Agriculture Committee. Whether Insight Policy Research recommends that the NMI join the national SNAP program or create some hybrid system that better fits our islands, the Agricultural Act also made available $30.5 million over three years to increase food stamp benefits. The law makes the first of that money, $13.5 million, available in fiscal year 2016, which begins on October 1, 2015. Another $8.5 million follows in both fiscal 2017 and 2018. And all that money is on top of the annual $12.148 million the Commonwealth has been receiving.

50 years later work remains to lift federal education funding
With reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act near the top of the congressional agenda, its fitting to note that tomorrow, April 11, is the 50th anniversary of the law. Part of President Lyndon Johnsons War on Poverty, the ESEA established a federal role in making sure that public school students nationwide can get a good educationwhether they lived in poor communities or rich communities. Of course, there is always more work to be done to make good intentions real; and one of my goals as your Congressman has been to get more federal education dollars to help our students. Last year, the Public School System got a big boost in ESEA Title I funding, going from $4.04 million to $7 million. I have also introduced legislation, H.R. 851,
that would double that to $14.05 million by taking the distribution of Title I funds to the insular areas out of the hands of the Secretary of Education and treating us more like the 50 states. Changing funding formulas is difficult because some areas lose when others gain. But that should not stop us from working to improve educational opportunity for our children.

New report highlights population trends in the Northern Marianas
The U.S. Census Bureau has released Recent Population Trends for the U.S. Island Areas: 2000 to 2010.
The report looks at demographic trends including migration, fertility rates, race and ethnicity, age, and sex, in the Northern Marianas and other insular areas. Some highlights:
*
Between 2000 and 2010 total population in the Northern Marianas dropped by 15,338, or 22 percent, in contrast to the previous decade, when population grew by 25,876, or 59 percent. Population is projected to grow again in the coming decade by 3,772, or 7 percent.
*
In 2010, Asians
mostly Filipinos, Chinese, and Koreans made up nearly half the population in 2010, slightly down from 56 percent in 2000. A third were Pacific Islanders, mostly Chamorros, unchanged from 2000.
*
Reflecting the garment industry workforce, in 2000 one quarter of the NMI population were females aged 20 to 34. Between 2000 and 2010, the NMI lost nearly 30 percent of its female population and 13 percent of the male population. This changed the NMIs sex ratio, turning a female majority population in 2000 (86 males for every 100 females) into a male majority population in 2010 (106 males for every 100 females).
