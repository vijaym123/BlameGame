Rogers Co-Sponsors Coal Jobs Protection Act
Applauds House Committee Passage
WASHINGTON, D.C. --
U.S. Rep. Harold "Hal" Rogers (KY-05) applauded the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for passing the
Coal Jobs Protection Act
(H.R. 5077) on Wednesday afternoon. Congressman Rogers co-sponsored the legislation to rein in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) overreach in the coal permitting process that has halted coal mining operations, leaving nearly 8,000 Eastern Kentucky miners without work since 2008.
"The White House has been hell-bent on adding layer after layer of regulatory tape to make it nearly impossible to mine coal in Eastern Kentucky and other parts of the country. Meanwhile, our coal miners continue to wait in unemployment lines, struggling to find new opportunities for comparable income while this federal agency refuses to approve mining permits for the work they are trained to do," said Rogers, a member of the Congressional Coal Caucus. "The act would require the EPA to make a decision within 270 days of a permit proposal. Failure to approve a permit within that time frame, would result in an automatic approval, sending dozens of coal miners back to work. It's time for this agency to be a part of promoting job creation and American energy opportunities, rather than shutting them down."
The bill now heads to the full House for consideration.
The Coal Jobs Protection Act would:
Require the EPA to analyze the impact of a proposed Clean Water Act regulatory act on jobs and economic activity. If the analysis shows that the action would hurt jobs or the states economy, the EPA would be required to hold a public hearing in that state in the area most impacted by the proposed action.
Restrict the EPAs ability to second guess or delay a states permitting and water quality standards decisions, thus returning authority to the states.
Prevent the EPA from dragging its feet in deciding on permits, ending delays that cost West Virginia jobs. Regulators would be given clear deadlines for action on permit applications.
Add transparency and efficiency to the regulatory process by stopping the EPA from enacting guidance that has not been open to public notice and comment.
Limit the ability of the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to revise the current regulatory definition of fill material under the Clean Water Act by making the current regulatory definition part of the law.
