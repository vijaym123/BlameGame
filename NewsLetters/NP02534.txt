Dear Friend,
Each year, I have the privilege of
nominating a limited number of candidates
to four of the five service academies. I
continue to be highly impressed by the
quality of character and readiness to serve
that is apparent year after year in
Ohios 16
th
District.
Members of Congress may nominate
applicants who meet the eligibility
requirements established by law. Candidates
may receive a nomination from a member of
the U.S. House of Representatives who
represents the congressional district in
which the candidate resides. In addition,
nominations can be obtained through both
U.S. senators from the candidates
home state, the vice president of the
United States, and the president under
certain conditions. Perspective students
are encouraged to pursue a nomination
through all available options.
Because the application process may seem
overwhelming, I want to do everything I can
to ensure that those who are interested in
attending one of the service academies have
access to the information they need. That
is why my office will host a
Military Academy Day
on
Saturday, February 28, 2015,
from
10:00 a.m.
12:00 p.m . at
Jackson Township Branch Library in
Massillon, Ohio,
for those interested
in attending the U.S. Military Academy,
U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Air Force Academy,
U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, and/or the
U.S. Coast Guard Academy. Representatives
from all five service academies will be in
attendance and available to speak with
perspective students. The information
session is free and open to the public;
however, I may only nominate those who
reside in Ohios 16
th
District. The honor of
attending a service academy is more than a
full scholarship to an elite college as it
comes with an obligation and commitment to
serve in the military for a minimum of five
years upon graduation.
Our office will begin accepting
applications on April 1, 2015 for those who
are high school juniors and will be seniors
the following year, or who have already
graduated. The deadline to apply for a
nomination from my office is October 1,
2015. It is required that those applying be
a U.S. citizen, unmarried with no
dependents, and between the ages of 17 and
23.
My nominations are based on a
whole person evaluation.
Factors including academic achievements,
extra-curricular activities, leadership
skills, physical aptitude, character and
motivation are taken into consideration. It
is extremely important that candidates have
experience serving the community through
volunteerism.
If you or someone you know is interested
in applying, the candidate will need to
include a high school transcript, ACT
and/or SAT results, resume, two letters of
recommendation, and an essay stating why
the candidate wants to attend a service
academy (in 500 words or less). The
application can be found on our website at
Renacci.house.gov/academy-nominations. In
addition, you may find a list of frequently
asked questions. For questions relating to
the application process or Military Academy
Day, please contact Bryan Bowman in our
Wadsworth Office at (330) 334-0040.
Sincerely,
Wadsworth:
