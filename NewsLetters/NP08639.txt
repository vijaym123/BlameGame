Providing Certainty to Farmers and Small Business Owners
As a former small business owner, I understand the difficulties of
long-term planning.
That's why I voted last week for a bill to provide
more certainty in the U.S. tax code.
America's Small Business Tax
Relief Act of 2014
helps business owners and farmers expense new equipment and invest in
growing their business.
It sets permanent, higher expensing limits
under Section 179 of the tax code.
It allows small businesses to
deduct up to $500,000 of investments in new equipment in one year,
instead of over time, making it easier for them to make decisions about
a big purchase.
This is especially important for farmers, who rely on
increasingly expensive agricultural equipment to feed and clothe
America.
Earlier this year, I wrote a letter to Congressional Leaders pushing to
extend Section 179 expensing levels
to provide certainty for our small business owners and farmers.
I'm proud the House passed this common-sense bill to allow them to
invest in their own growth, and spend more resources producing and
creating American jobs.
Ensuring Rural Veterans' Access to Health Care
We keep learning more and more about the expansive scope of the VA's
unconscionable neglect of our veterans.
Our efforts to hold the
Administration accountable are vital.
But my top priority right now is
ensuring our veterans get the care they need and deserve.
Last week, I
supported a bill to expand veterans' options in receiving care.
The
Veterans Access to Care Act
requires
the VA to sponsor private care for any veteran who can't get an
appointment within 14 days.
More importantly for West Texans, the VA
would be required to do the same for any veteran living more than 40
miles from a VA medical facility under this bill.
This means less wait
time, shorter travel time, and more access to care.
It also promotes
accountability in the VA by prohibiting performance bonuses for VA
staff until at least 2017.
The Senate passed a similar bill last week.
I'm hopeful we can work
out any differences between the two versions quickly, so this important
reform can be signed into law and our veterans can receive the care
they deserve.
Named a 'Taxpayer Hero' by Citizens Against Government Waste
One of my main goals in Washington has always been to rein in the
federal government and hold it accountable to you, particularly in how
your tax dollars are spent.
I put this into practice each time I look
at a new bill or proposal - my first question is how the bill will
affect the taxpayers in the 19th District.
I'm proud to have been
recognized by the Citizens Against Government Waste as a 'Taxpayer Hero'
for 2013.
I've been recognized for these efforts in the past, and I
promise to continue fighting to spend your tax dollars wisely.

Providing
Certainty
to
Farmers
and
Small
Business
Owners
As
a
former
small
business
owner,
I
understand
the
difficulties
of
long-term
planning.
That&#8217;s
why
I
voted
last
week
for
a
bill
to
provide
more
certainty
in
the
U.S.
tax
code.
America&#8217;s
Small
Business
Tax
Relief
Act
of
2014
helps
business
owners
and
farmers
expense
new
equipment
and
invest
in
growing
their
business.
It
sets
permanent,
higher
expensing
limits
under
Section
179
of
the
tax
code.
It
allows
small
businesses
to
deduct
up
to
$500,000
of
investments
in
new
equipment
in
one
year,
instead
of
over
time,
making
it
easier
for
them
to
make
decisions
about
a
big
purchase.
This
is
especially
important
for
farmers,
who
rely
on
increasingly
expensive
agricultural
equipment
to
feed
and
clothe
America.
Earlier
this
year,
I
wrote
a
letter
to
Congressional
Leaders
pushing
to
extend
Section
179
expensing
levels
to
provide
certainty
for
our
small
business
owners
and
farmers.
I&#8217;m
proud
the
House
passed
this
common-sense
bill
to
allow
them
to
invest
in
their
own
growth,
and
spend
more
resources
producing
and
creating
American
jobs.
Ensuring
Rural
Veterans&#8217;
Access
to
Health
Care
We
keep
learning
more
and
more
about
the
expansive
scope
of
the
VA&#8217;s
unconscionable
neglect
of
our
veterans.
Our
efforts
to
hold
the
Administration
accountable
are
vital.
But
my
top
priority
right
now
is
ensuring
our
veterans
get
the
care
they
need
and
deserve.
Last
week,
I
supported
a
bill
to
expand
veterans&#8217;
options
in
receiving
care.
The
Veterans
Access
to
Care
Act
requires
the
VA
to
sponsor
private
care
for
any
veteran
who
can&#8217;t
get
an
appointment
within
14
days.
More
importantly
for
West
Texans,
the
VA
would
be
required
to
do
the
same
for
any
veteran
living
more
than
40
miles
from
a
VA
medical
facility
under
this
bill.
This
means
less
wait
time,
shorter
travel
time,
and
more
access
to
care.
It
also
promotes
accountability
in
the
VA
by
prohibiting
performance
bonuses
for
VA
staff
until
at
least
2017.
The
Senate
passed
a
similar
bill
last
week.
I&#8217;m
hopeful
we
can
work
out
any
differences
between
the
two
versions
quickly,
so
this
important
reform
can
be
signed
into
law
and
our
veterans
can
receive
the
care
they
deserve.
Named
a
&#8216;Taxpayer
Hero&#8217;
by
Citizens
Against
Government
Waste
One
of
my
main
goals
in
Washington
has
always
been
to
rein
in
the
federal
government
and
hold
it
accountable
to
you,
particularly
in
how
your
tax
dollars
are
spent.
I
put
this
into
practice
each
time
I
look
at
a
new
bill
or

&#8211;
my
first
question
is
how
the
bill
will
affect
the
taxpayers
in
the
19th
District.
I&#8217;m
proud
to
have
been
recognized
by
the
Citizens
Against
Government

as
a

I&#8217;ve
been
recognized
for
these
efforts
in
the
past,
and
I

to
continue
fighting
to
spend
your
tax
