Do you agree with President Obama's student loan repayment reform?
Yes - Capping student loan repayments at 10 percent of annual income
will keep recent graduates from drowning in debt
Maybe - It is a good first step, but I think the President and Congress
should work to make higher education more affordable.
No - It is an overreach of the President's executive powers.

It was another busy week on Capitol Hill. I had a short, but sweet,
visit back in CA-47 last weekend, but on Monday it was back to D.C.
Congress is almost halfway through a three-week stretch of being in
Washington, D.C. during the work week before entering into a week-long
district work period, where we go back to our home districts and
reconnect with our constituents. Until then, I am doing everything I
can to represent CA-47 and enact positive changes for our community.
Presidential Visit and UC Irvine Commencement
University of California, Irvine graduates were in for quite a treat
last weekend as President Obama flew into town to give the commencement
speech for the Class of 2014. Congratulations to all of the UCI
Anteaters as they take the next big step in their lives!
I had the honor of welcoming President Obama as he arrived aboard Air
Force One at the Joint Forces Training Base in Los Alamitos.
In addition to congratulating and encouraging the Class of 2014
graduates, the President was also commemorating the 50th anniversary of
the university's dedication in 1964. In his speech at the dedication,
President Lyndon B. Johnson praised the ability of Californians to
translate "good words into good deeds." I want to thank the President
for coming to Southern California to make it clear that this remains
true to this day.
Executive Order to Prevent Discrimination
The President this week announced that he planned to sign an Executive
Order on LGBT discrimination. This is a huge step forward, as it bans
all federal government contractors from discriminating against
employees based on their sexual orientation and gender identity.
Congress must now pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) so
we can finally close this chapter of inequality. ENDA has 205
bipartisan cosponsors and will ban all workplace discrimination against
the LGBT community; this bill will bring the change we need and the
dignity the LGBT community deserves.
Cypress Coffee
I hope you can join me for a cup of coffee and conversation about the
issues facing our community and nation. I will be providing a
Congressional update to attendees and, as always, will answer your
questions.
I hope to see you there.

Promise Zones
On Monday, I led a Los Angeles County Congressional Delegation member
letter to U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
Secretary Shaun Donovan commenting on the Promise Zone rule making
process. Promise Zones are specially designated areas that are eligible
for critical federal resources to invest in manufacturing and job
creation.
While I am appreciative that President Obama announced that the City of
Los Angeles would be one of our nation's first Promise Zones, I believe
that the opportunity should be expanded to other parts of the region,
due to our geographic make-up and population density.

Sergeant Paul T. Nakamura
There will be a memorialization ceremony and building dedication of the
Sergeant Paul T. Nakamura United States Army Reserve Center this
Saturday, June 21st at the Joint Forces Training Base in Los Alamitos.
Sergeant Nakamura was the first Asian American United States Army
Reservist to be killed in 2003 in "Operation Iraqi Freedom."
While I did not know Sergeant Nakamura personally, I thank him and his
family for their sacrifice to our nation. My hope is that this building
dedication will serve as a testament to his bravery and dedication.
Customer Protection and End User Relief Act
This week, I voted "no" on H.R. 4413, the Customer Protection and End
User Relief Act. This disingenuous bill would actually hamstring our
financial agencies' efforts to regulate derivatives and roll-back the
critical protections in the Dodd-Frank Act, which was made law after
the financial collapse that was turned into the Great Recession.
I believe that unregulated derivatives contributed to massive taxpayer
bailouts that caused great harmto the American economy just a few years
ago. We must not undo the work that was done to enact some of the most
important provisions of Wall Street Reform, including enacting consumer
financial protections that keep the financial industry accountable for
their actions.
Continuing the Fight for STEM Education in the 47th District
This week, I introduced a bipartisan amendment to the Department of
Defense Appropriations Act (DoDAA) that directed an additional $5
million to the STARBASE Youth Program, which provides Science,
Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education to underserved
students nationwide, including students right here in the 47th
District. The amendment was accepted , and the DoD App Act
passed by a
vote of 340 to 73.
I learned from the Appropriations Committee that, because of a letter I
sent in March, $25 million was made available to STARBASE programs. I
still think we need more funding for STEM education which is why I
requested the additional $5 million. And I was pleased that it was
added to the overall appropriations bill.
In the 47th District, the STARBASE Youth Program Facility at the Los
Alamitos Joint Forces Training Base (JFTB) serves nearly 4,000 students
a year, and is funded by $1 million in state funds and $750,000 in
federal funds.
Our 21st century economy requires 21st century skill sets. Investing in
our children's education in the STEM fields will make them better
prepared for the job market and equipped for success. I have been an
educator for much of me adult life, so I appreciate the importance of
programs such as STARBASE. Our STARBASE program at the Joint Forces
Training Base is doing great work for our community, and we must invest
in their continued success.
Department of Defense Appropriations Act
During the floor action on the Department of Defense Appropriations Act
(DoDAA) I voted against an amendment which prohibited the use of funds
to transfer or release any individuals detained at U.S. Naval Station
Guantanamo.
Unfortunately, the amendment passed and detainees must remain at
Guantanamo indefinitely. I also voted for an amendment to prohibit the
use of funds for combat operations in Iraq. And unfortunately this
amendment failed.
However, I did vote for the overall DoDAA. While the DoDAA did not go
far enough in cuts to the DoD, and contained provisions I did not agree
with, I felt, overall, it was important to fund and support our troops.
Violence in Iraq
One of the reasons we went to Iraq in the first place, a reason we shed
American blood there, was to create a strong foundation for the Iraqi
people to provide their own security and stability. The current
situation in Iraq is a culmination of the country's civil war and
deep-rooted religious differences.
We must make sure Iraqi forces are able to defend themselves. However,
putting our boots on the ground and potentially sacrificing more
American lives is not the answer. If we learned nothing from our
headlong and ill-conceived rush to start the Iraq War, I hope we at
least learned that in these situations we must proceed carefully,
cautiously, and with full consideration of all of our options.
Any solution to the problem must include a unity government with all
factions participating. This is not the case today. And, whatever we
do, we cannot do it alone - this must be a unified effort on the part
of our allies both internationally and inside Iraq.
"Revenue Neutral"
Many Members of Congress often introduce bills that are "revenue
neutral," meaning they do not cost the federal government, or the
taxpayers, any addition money. Bills that are revenue neutral typically
may involve removing funds from one program to give to another program;
tax rates for certain people or products may also be decreased in one
area, then increased in another. It is important to note that bills do
not always need to be revenue neutral. However, given the current
fiscal climate, the odds of revenue neutral bills passing and becoming
law are much higher than if they were not revenue neutral.

Promise

I
led

County

Delegation
member
letter
to

that
President
Obama
announced
that
the
City
of
Los
Angeles
would
be
one
of
our
nation&#8217;s

I
believe
that
the

Customer
Protection
and
End
User
Relief
Act
This
week,
I
voted
&#8220;no&#8221;
on
H.R.
4413,
the
Customer
Protection
and
End
User
Relief
Act.
This
disingenuous
bill
would
actually
hamstring
our
financial
agencies&#8217;
efforts
to

and

critical
protections
in
the
Dodd-Frank
Act,
which
was
made
law
after
the
financial
collapse
that
was
turned
into
the
Great
Recession.
I
believe
that
unregulated
derivatives
contributed
to
massive
taxpayer
bailouts
that
caused
great
harmto
the
American
economy
just
a
few
years

Continuing
the
Fight
for
STEM
Education
in
the
47th
District
This
week,
I
introduced
a
bipartisan
amendment
to
the
Department
of
Defense
Appropriations
Act
(DoDAA)
that
directed
an
additional
$5
million
to
the
STARBASE
Youth
Program,
which
provides
Science,
Technology,
Engineering
and
Math
(STEM)
education
to
underserved
students
nationwide,
including
students
right
here
in
the
47th
District.
The
amendment
was
accepted
,
and
the
DoD
App
Act
passed
by
a
vote
of
340
to
73.
I
learned
from
the
Appropriations
Committee
that,
because
of
a
letter
I
sent
in
March,
$25
million
was
made
available
to
STARBASE
programs.
I
still
think
we
need
more
funding
for
STEM
education
which
is
why
I
requested
the
additional
$5
million.
And
I
was
pleased
that
it
was
added
to
the
overall
appropriations
bill.
In
the
47th
District,
the
STARBASE
Youth
Program
Facility
at
the
Los
Alamitos
Joint
Forces
Training
Base
(JFTB)
serves
nearly
4,000
students
a
year,
and
is
funded
by
$1
million
in
state
funds
and
$750,000
in
federal
funds.
Our
21st
century
economy
requires
21st
century
skill
sets.
Investing
in
our
children&#8217;s
education
in
the
STEM
fields
will
make
them
better
prepared
for
the
job
market
and
equipped
for
success.
I
have
been
an
educator
for
much
of
me
adult
life,
so
I
appreciate
the
importance
of
programs
such
as
STARBASE.
Our
STARBASE
program
at
the
Joint
Forces
Training
Base
is
doing
great
work
for
our
community,
and
we
must
invest
in
their
continued
success.
Department
of
Defense
Appropriations
Act
During
the
floor
action
on
the
Department
of
Defense
Appropriations
Act
(DoDAA)
I
voted
against
an
amendment
which
prohibited
the
use
of
funds
to
transfer
or
release
any
individuals
detained
at
U.S.
Naval
Station
Guantanamo.
Unfortunately,
the
amendment
passed
and
detainees
must
remain
at
Guantanamo
indefinitely.
I
also
voted
for
an
amendment
to
prohibit
the
use
of
funds
for
combat
operations
in
Iraq.
And
unfortunately
this
amendment
failed.
However,
I
did
vote
for
the
overall
DoDAA.
While
the
DoDAA
did
not
go
far
enough
in
cuts
to
the
DoD,
and
contained
provisions
I
did
not
agree
with,
I
felt,
overall,
it
was
important
to
fund
and
support
our
troops.
Violence
in
Iraq
One
of
the
reasons
we
went
to
Iraq
in
the
first
place,
a
reason
we
shed
American
blood
there,
was
to
create
a
strong
foundation
for
the
Iraqi
people
to
provide
their
own
security
and
stability.
The
current
situation
in
Iraq
is
a
culmination
of
the
country&#8217;s
civil
war
and
deep-rooted
religious
differences.
We
must
make
sure
Iraqi
forces
are
able
to
defend
themselves.
However,
putting
our
boots
on
the
ground
and
potentially
sacrificing
more
American
lives
is
not
the
answer.
If
we
learned
nothing
from
our
headlong
and
ill-conceived
rush
to
start
the
Iraq
War,
I
hope
we
at
least
learned
that
in
these
situations
we
must
proceed
carefully,
cautiously,
and
with
full
consideration
of
all
of
our
options.
Any
solution
to
the
problem
must
include
a
unity
government
with
all
factions
participating.
This
is
not
the
case
today.
And,
whatever
we
do,
we
cannot
do
it
alone
&#8211;
this
must
be
a
unified
effort
on
the
part
of
our
allies
both
internationally
and
inside
Iraq.
&#8220;Revenue
Neutral&#8221;
Many
Members
of
Congress
often
introduce
bills
that
are
&#8220;revenue
neutral,&#8221;
meaning
they
do
not
cost
the
federal
government,
or
the
taxpayers,
any
addition
money.
Bills
that
are
revenue
neutral
typically
may
involve
removing
funds
from
one
program
to
give
to
another
program;
tax
rates
for
certain
people
or
products
may
also
be
decreased
in
one
area,
then
increased
in
another.
It
is
important
to
note
that
bills
do
not
always
need
to
be
revenue
neutral.
However,
given
the
current
fiscal
climate,
the
odds
of
revenue
neutral
bills
passing
and
becoming
law
are
much
higher
than
if
they
were
not
revenue
neutral.
