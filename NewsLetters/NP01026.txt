Introducing the PACE Act
This week, I joined Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) to introduce the
Protecting Affordable Coverage for Employees (PACE) Act., S.1099. This
legislation seeks to protect small and mid-sized businesses in South
Carolina and across America from potential healthcare premium increases
under the Affordable Care Act.
Working together, we can find common sense solutions to stop this major
disruption for many mid-sized businesses, their employees and their
families. I am happy Senator Shaheen has agreed to work with me on this
important effort to support small businesses on Main Street.
Legislation to Rename Hollings Judicial Center
Senator Graham and I also introduced legislation to rename the Hollings
Judicial Center in Charleston as the J. Waties Waring Judicial Center.
I am excited to see the entire Congressional delegation come together
to honor Judge Julius Waties Waring. Although not widely celebrated
during his lifetime, Judge Waring's contributions to the Civil Rights
movement were incredibly important. I am proud we are able to honor his
memory in this way.
I also want to thank Senator Hollings, for whom the facility is
currently named, for his selfless request to change the name of the
courthouse. He is truly a man of integrity and character.
PBS NewsHour with Gwen Ifill
Earlier this week, I sat down with PBS NewHours' Gwen Ifill to discuss
the current situation in Baltimore and body cameras. In case you missed
it, you can watch by clicking the image below:

I also joined CNN's New Day to continue the discussion. Watch below:

On Sunday, I will discuss Baltimore and how we can move forward

George. Be sure to tune in! Check your local listings here

Sincerely,
Tim
