Wilson Bus Tour Coming to a Station Near You!
Dear Friend,
It's that time of year again! I will be kicking off the Second Congressional District of South Carolina's Annual Bus Tour on Monday in Cayce at the West-Metro Chamber Breakfast. Throughout the week, I will visit all five counties I have the privilege of representing to meet with constituents, discuss their concerns, and share news of our efforts in Congress. Check out the schedule below and see if the bus makes a stop in your community! I have highlighted several events that are open to the public.
I hope you, your family members, and friends will be able to join us!
