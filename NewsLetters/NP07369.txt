It's Good to Be
Home
Dear Friends:
As Congress prepared for the upcoming
congressional recess period, the past several
days have been a whirlwind of activity as I have
continued to work on issues vital to our state
and nation. I wanted to keep you
updated on the activity taking place and let you
know my thoughts on the challenges we face.
First, last night, the Senate passed the
Veterans'
Access to Care through Choice, Accountability,
and Transparency Act , which takes several
important first steps towards reforming the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The
legislation provides funding to hire more health
care providers, build new health clinics, support
veterans and their families with more educational
and psychological benefits, and gives the
Secretary of the VA the authority needed to fire
senior executives at the agency as the Secretary
sees fit. The legislation was passed by the
Senate mere days after the Senate confirmed a new
Secretary of the VA, Robert McDonald, who I voted
to confirm.
Our veterans and their families are heroes who
deserve our very best, but sadly, the system in
place and some of the senior leadership at the
agency in Washington was preventing that. I
recently visited the VA hospital in Salt Lake
City and its staffed by some of the most
caring staff anywhere, but they can only do so
much without strong leadership from
Washington.These new meaningful reforms and
a new Secretary of the VA are important first
steps to provide that foundation so our veterans
and their families can receive the care they
deserve.
Second, I wanted to make sure you were aware
of my push to end the dysfunction that exists in
the United States Senate and what should be the
path for reform. Ive given three
detailed speeches over the last two weeks where
Ive outlined
the
history
of the Senate,
how
its become dysfunctional
under Senate
Democrats, and how I think we can
move
forward
in a meaningful way.
It is wonderful to be back in Utah and I look
forward to visiting with many of you over the
next several weeks as I travel throughout the
state. It is always good to spend time in
the state I am proud to call home.
Sincerely,
Orrin Hatch
