Dear Fellow Nevadan,
This week, the
U.S. Department of Education announced that Nevada will receive $6.4
million to expand access to high-quality preschool development programs.
Nevada was selected as one of five states nationwide to be awarded
preschool development grants.This is wonderful news for Nevada students,
teachers and parents.
I have been a strong supporter of
providing additional federal funds for early childhood education and
worked to include new funding in 2014 that made this grant possible.
Providing Nevadas children with a high-quality, early childhood education
is one of the most important investments we can make for future
generations. Early education programs have been proven to help children
develop their social, emotional, physical, and cognitive skills, laying
the foundation for success in school and life.
As someone
whose life was transformed by education, I understand the importance of
providing all Nevadans with the opportunity to receive a quality
education. Throughout my time in Congress, I have been a strong supporter of
early childhood education programs and I will continue my work to
provide more resources for Nevadas early education programs, schools,
colleges, and universities.

the Senate on behalf of Nevadans or to contact me, please visit
