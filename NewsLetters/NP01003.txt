Dear Fellow
Nevadan,
The history of Cinco de Mayo is one that is largely
unfamiliar to most Americans. Its a shame that we dont know more about
it, because the story of Cinco de Mayo is one of inspiration. It is a
tale of a small force that was vastly outnumbered, but refused to
capitulate.
One-hundred fifty-three years ago at the Battle of
Puebla, a small Mexican army force found itself outnumbered two-to-one
by the rival French. The outmatched soldiers refused to give in. They
couldnt
the future of Mexico rested on their shoulders. And
unbelievably, in spite of seemingly insurmountable odds, the Mexican army
would not surrender.
That is what we celebrate today. Not just
Mexican culture and history, but also the resilient spirit that
refuses to give up. The United States of America is better off because of
that spirit engendered by millions of Mexican-Americans, and indeed, the
entire Latino community.
It is that same spirit that today
injects new life into our communities. It is that same spirit
possessed by generations of Mexican-Americans that has fueled the economies
and vibrancy of communities throughout the southwest. It is that same
spirit that empowers Latino students to push themselves to new heights.
And it is that same, indomitable spirit that inspires
Hispanic-Americans to defend our country on the front lines across the
world.
Hispanic heritage in this country has never been stronger. Now it
falls upon us, as members of Congress, to support Mexican-Americans
and the greater Latino community to reach the promise of their American
dream.
We can do that by investing in working American families,
not by kicking families off of their health insurance, as the
Republican budget does. Or by stripping their children of financial aid for
college, as the Republican budget does. Or by cutting job training
programs
as the Republican budget does. The Republican budget is unfair.
It is unbalanced, unwise, and as some said it is
immoral.
So as we celebrate Cinco de Mayo today, I hope we will remember that
unrelenting Mexican spirit that prevailed on the battlefield 153 years
ago. But more importantly, I hope we will recognize that that same
spirit is among us today, in the homes of Mexican-Americans all across
the country.
