June 11, 2014
Friends,
I have
received many calls, letters, emails, and Facebook comments asking
what I am going to do to address the deadly VA wait times. I want you to
know that
yesterday I supported legislation that allows
veterans to avoid the deadly VA backlogs and get private health
care.
The
Veteran Access to Care Act
of 2014 , H.R. 4810, enables veterans who live over 40
miles from a VA facility to receive non-VA care, and guarantees those
veterans who have experienced extensive wait times access to non-VA care.
Since many of our districts veterans live a great distance
from a VA facility, this change would significantly benefit them and
improve their access to care.
I was proud to support this
common-sense legislation because
I believe the private market is
the solution to our veterans health care obstacles.
More government bureaucracy will never solve the VA's
problems.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Sen.
John McCain (R-AZ) have introduced legislation similar to the bill my
colleagues and I passed yesterday, and it has been reported that the
Senate could vote on their version as soon as tomorrow.
I sincerely
hope the Senate acts quickly so we can get a reconciled bill to the
President and our veterans can begin getting access to the quality of
care they were promised, and deserve.
As always, it is an
honor and privilege to represent you and our districts veterans.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can assist you with a
federal issue or with requesting updates pending Veterans Affairs claims.
Sincerely,
Tom
Rice
