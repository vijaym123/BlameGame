Dear
Constituents,
This month, I am continuing my
work to help create jobs in our community and help our recovering economy
stay on track by hosting an event to partner local businesses in the
area with vital resources to help them export American-made products
and jump start job creation.
I have partnered with the
Chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im Bank),
Fred P. Hochberg to help educate small businesses in the area about the
tools available to grow their businesses through exports. The Ex-Im
Bank plays a vital role in helping small businesses by providing them
with low-cost export loans that alleviate the two to three month payment
delay inherent in exporting goods to other countries, giving job
creators in our community increased access to new
markets.

Do you support raising the federal minimum
wage from $7.25/hr to $10.10/hr? Yes, and I believe the minimum wage should be indexed to
inflation Yes, and I believe
Congress should periodically increase the minimum wage but it should
not be automatic No, but I
support a smaller increase No, I do not support a federally mandated $10.10 minimum
wage Undecided *By answering this

When I was sworn into office, I promised
to find pragmatic solutions to our nation's most pressing issues.
Small business owners are the real job creators in our community, and
together we will help create local jobs and get our neighbors back to
work. I look forward to seeing many of you
there.
Sincerely,
Raul Ruiz, M.D.
