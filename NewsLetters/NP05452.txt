Message from Dave
Earlier this year, I visited the nationally acclaimed Mariachi Huenachi group, led by Ramon Rivera, at Wenatchee High School in the eastern part of my district. By sharing their music, they allow audiences to experience a celebration of a rich cultural heritage, and the program itself inspires the participants to strive for excellence.
The Mariachi
Huenachi group is just one example of the many ways the Hispanic culture enriches the American melting pot. In the 8 th
District alone, there are no shortage of others. Alma and Jorge Chacon are the founders of Caf, which focuses on helping young men and women of Hispanic background develop leadership skills so that they can be a voice in their community and advocate for what they believe in.
Ernest Radillo heads the North Central Washington Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, and his impact is felt around the State. Norma Gallegos has taken it upon herself to work with World Relief to help those who have entered this country pursuing the American Dream learn more about our nation, providing free citizenship classes and legal assistance.
This is the very essence of what makes America great: entrepreneurship, compassion, service, leadership. These are the things that I strive to embody in my own life and that I work for in Congress. I can think of no better way to celebrate the close of Hispanic Heritage Month than to recognize some of the great men and women who are helping enrich the their communities, the 8 th
District, their state, and their country.
