On April 28 th , the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in challenges to four democratically-passed state marriage laws from Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan, and Tennessee.
This is an important case because it will decide whether states, as sovereign entities, will see their laws defining marriage respected. In
United States vs. Windsor
in 2013, the Court emphasized that the statesnot the federal governmenthave the authority to define and oversee marriages. Now, however, the Court is being asked to ignore its own precedent and judicially interfere.
I joined my fellow Members of Congress in submitting an
amicus curiae
brief to the Supreme Court, urging the Court to defer to the authority of the States, so as to allow the people to debate and determine what marriage policies are best for their state. You can read the text of the brief,

Yours in service,
Randy
