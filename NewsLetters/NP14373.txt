Update from Congressman Scott Tipton
"We remember those who were called upon to give all a person can give,
and we remember those who were prepared to make that sacrifice if it
were demanded of them in the line of duty, though it never was. Most of
all, we remember the devotion and gallantry with which all of them
ennobled their nation as they became champions of a noble cause."-
President Ronald Reagan, Veterans Day, 1988
Since the beginning of our great nation, a special few have answered
the noble call to defend our way of life, risking their own lives so
that we can live free. On Monday, we celebrate these special Americans,
our veterans, and pay tribute to their sacrifices and courage.
On Veterans Day and every day, it's important to remember these men and
women and their families, and show them our appreciation for what
they've done for us. We owe them all a tremendous debt of gratitude.
Colorado is blessed to have so many veterans call it home, and one of
the great honors of serving in Congress is being able to represent
these American heroes. In Congress I have made veterans issues one of
my top priorities and continue to strive to make sure that veterans
receive the benefits they have earned; to cut red tape and bureaucracy
and reduce the VA claims backlog-benefits should work for our veterans,
veterans shouldn't have to work to receive the benefits they've already
earned. Additionally, we are working to bring a National Veterans
Cemetery to Southern Colorado, as well as to shorten the distance that
rural veterans need to travel to get health care. You can learn more
about my work on behalf of veteran and military issues
and about resources available
to veterans on our website.
To all of you who have served, or who have family members that have-
thank you for your service. It's a true privilege to represent you in
Congress. My office is available to assist you and I invite you to
contact me
anytime.
Sincerely,
In Case You Missed It
