Dear Friend,
This week, my Democratic
Colleagues and I fought tirelessly in the face of radical opposition to
fully fund the Department of Homeland Security. I am very pleased that
75 Republicans voted with the Democrats to protect everyone in America
from serious threats.
With the passage of a bill to fund DHS
through September, the safety of our country prevailed over
Republicans' radical, anti-immigrant demands.
No one should play games
with our national security.
My
video honoring the 50th Anniversary of 'Bloody
Sunday'
Saturday marks the 50th anniversary of
'Bloody Sunday' and
serves as a reminder that the march for
equality, opportunity, and justice must continue in our own day.
As
a young man, I was proud to join the march with Dr. King as it
traveled from Selma to Montgomery.
The path we walked in Alabama
ultimately paved the way for the passage of the Voting Rights Act.
I
still have the sunglasses, hat, and 'orange vest of courage' I wore
during the march.
On Bloody Sunday, 600 men and women led by
Amelia Boynton Robinson, Reverend James Bevel and Rep. John Lewis
braved an arsenal of intolerance and injustice as they asserted their full
and equal right to participate in our democracy.
Bloodied and
bruised, they were turned back on Sunday, March 6, 1965 at the Edmund
Pettus Bridge. They returned days later, defiant and bearing the scars
that testified to their unwavering determination, and completed their
march for equality to the State Capitol in Montgomery.
As we
join together in marking this anniversary, let us recommit ourselves to
protecting and promoting the right to vote for this generation of
Americans and all those who will inherit our democracy in years to
come.
Your opinion is valuable to me. So please
visit my website at
Rangel.house.gov
for more information, and to engage
with me on
Facebook
and on
Twitter . It's always a great honor serving
you.
Best regards,
Charles B. Rangel

February Jobs Report
The February jobs report
marks
five years
of uninterrupted job growth. Wages
increased, hundreds of thousands of people went back to work, and
unemployment hit its lowest mark since 2008. However, while most benefit
from strong job growth, many have yet to feel the full effect of our
economic gains. Reducing unemployment among minorities and our youth
must be a priority for our nation.
Everyone deserves the
opportunity to hold a steady job.
