Dear Friend,
The American economy does well when we make things in America.
Take Massachusetts, for example. We are an advanced-manufacturing state. We have enormous opportunity to be the national leader in clean energy, high-tech, and biotech manufacturing.
Our nation can become a leader in the 21st century economy.
But in order to do that, we need to invest in 21st-century manufacturing.
I&rsquo;m joining a few of my colleagues in urging Congress to invest in 21st century American manufacturing.
To join us, all you have to do is click here and add your name.
For years, I&rsquo;ve been working to spur a 21st-century innovation economy. I&rsquo;m fighting for an initiative to put inventors, professors, and producers together to get ideas to move from the lab into the factory. I&rsquo;ve led the charge to invest in clean energy technology and manufacturing hubs to help innovative and job-creating technologies actually reach the marketplace.
Since 2010, America&rsquo;s manufacturing sector has created more than 860,000 jobs. It makes up nearly 20% of our economic growth when you account for inflation. These are good-paying jobs, many of which require workers trained in math, science, and critical thinking. If Congress takes the right steps, we can capitalize on the great opportunity we have before us.
But we have to do it soon. Join my colleagues and me -- tell Congress to invest in American manufacturing. Sign our petition today.
Thank you for joining us today in supporting a Made in America economy.
