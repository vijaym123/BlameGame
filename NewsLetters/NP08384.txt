The Fourth of July, Independence Day, is always filled with the red, white and blue regalia that represent the three colors of our flag. As a wise man once reminded me many years ago: A lot of people fought and died for that flag sonny, so treat it with respect.
The Veterans of Foreign Wars is an organization that not only represents those who fought and died for our country but serves as an educational resource for our American traditions including flag etiquette, which combines accepted custom and law. And as we prepare to celebrate our nations birthday, I wanted to share with you a little about flag etiquette which I hope will be educational and useful.
First, please remember that our flag should never be used as drapery, never festooned, drawn back or up in folds. It should always be allowed to fall free and when bunting is used for decoration, it should be first blue, then white, and then red.
If you are planning to place a flag behind a special Independence Day speakers platform at an event in your community, if flat, should be above and behind the speaker. When placing a flag over a street, place the union so it faces north and east depending on the direction of the street and when Old Glory is projecting from a windowsill, balcony or building front, the union of the flag should always be at the peak of the staff unless the flag is half-staff. When a flag is placed on a wall either horizontally or vertically, the union should be the uppermost and to the flags own right or the viewers left. If placed in a window, the union should be to the flags right when viewed from the outside.
Parades are always part of our Fourth of July celebrations and our flag is always the center of attention during these events. When carried in a parade front with other flags, Old Glory should always be to the marching right of any other flags, or to the front and center of the flag line. For those of you expecting to attend a Fourth of July Parade, please remember that when the flag is raised or is passing, everyone present, except military members, should face the flag and place his or her hand over their heart. Men should remove their hats while military personnel salute.
Of course, we also must also be conscious of caring for the flag, not only on busy holidays like the Fourth of July but all throughout the year. For example, if you have a soiled flag, it may be washed or dry cleaned and when torn or frayed it may be mended. However, a worn or faded flag should always be retired with the respect which can be accomplished by folding it properly and placing it on a fire and then the ashes buried.
I am hopeful these tips on etiquette will serve you well as you prepare for your Fourth of July celebrations.
Many have selfless and courageous individuals have fought and died for our flag so please treat it with the respect it deserves. Have a very happy Fourth of July and God Bless the United States of America.
