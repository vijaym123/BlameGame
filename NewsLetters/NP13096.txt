Meeting with EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy
On Wednesday I hosted a meeting with Members of Congress and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy to express our disappointment in EPA's proposed volume numbers for 2014. The EPA has proposed significant reductions to the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS).
I appreciate Administrator McCarthy's willingness to meet with us and hope the Agency's final rule will take the concerns of our constituents into account. The rural economy has been one of the few bright spots in recent years, due in large part to the RFS. Reducing the RFS would not only have a negative impact on jobs and the rural economy, it would also halt advances in the next generation of renewable fuels. I will continue to press the importance of a strong RFS as the EPA moves ahead with the rulemaking process.
Serving You

Congratulations to Moorhead's new mayor Del Rae Williams! Mayor Williams was sworn in this week as Moorhead's first female mayor and follows the retirement of Mark Voxland after his 12 years of service. Williams plans to focus on business and residential development, as well as the arts. I'm looking forward to working with her and Moorhead's city council on federal issues.

The US Small Business Administration (SBA) announced this week that federal economic injury disaster loans are available to small businesses, small agricultural cooperatives, and most private non-profit organizations of all sizes located in certain counties in Minnesota as result of drought conditions that occurred on September 1, 2013 through November 15, 2013.
The disaster declaration includes Stearns and Todd Counties in the 7th Congressional District. When the Secretary of Agriculture issues a disaster declaration to assist farmers to recover from damages of losses to crops, the SBA issues a declaration for eligible entities affected by the same disaster.
Applicants may apply online using the Electronic Loan Application via SBA's secure website at https://disasterloan.sba.gov/ela. Disaster loan information and application forms may also be obtained by calling the SBA's Customer Service Center at 800-659-2955 (800-877-8339 for the deaf and hard-of-hearing) or by sending an email to disastercustomerservice@sba.gov . Loan applications can be downloaded from www.sba.gov /disaster. Completed loan applications must be returned to SBA no later than September 8, 2014.

On January 13th, 1978, longtime Minnesota Senator and Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey passed away. He was the state campaign manager for Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944 and entered the national political spotlight after delivering a rousing speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1948 and left twenty years later to become Lyndon B. Johnson's Vice President. He lost a close presidential race to Richard Nixon in 1968, but was elected Minnesota's Senator again in 1970 and served until his death. His body was laid in state underneath both the U.S. Capitol and Minnesota State Capitol rotundas. He is buried in Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis.
