Rep. Miller: National Flood Insurance Program is a Bad Deal for Michigan
Rep. Miller votes against legislation to reauthorize flawed National Flood Insurance Program; calls on Governor Snyder to opt Michigan out of program altogether
Washington
&#8211; U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10) issued the following statement after voting against the reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program that forces Michigan homeowners to pay higher flood insurance premiums to subsidize plans in flood prone
areas of the country:
&#8220;The National Flood Insurance Program is hopelessly in debt, over $25 billion, due to the fact that politics are responsible for setting rates, not actuarial cost.
As a result, too many Americans across this nation are paying rates far below what actual
risk would dictate in the marketplace while others, including many who I represent, are being forced to pay into a program that they do not need or want to help subsidize lower rates for other favored groups whose risk is far greater.
&#8220;In fact, since the federal flood insurance program started, homeowners in Michigan have paid multiple times more in premiums than has been paid back in claims. This is wrong.
And, just like Obamacare, this costly, unworkable, unfair and failed program
is exactly why the federal government shouldn&#8217;t be in the insurance business.
&#8220;That&#8217;s why I not only voted against the reauthorization, but why I am also
calling on Governor Snyder to opt Michigan out of the program altogether
and instead seek a state or private alternative that stops forcing Michigan homeowners to serve as ATM
machines for the rest of
the nation.&#8221;
