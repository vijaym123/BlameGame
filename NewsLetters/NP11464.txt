Friends,
This past Wednesday, I voted for, and the U.S. House passed, the ENFORCE the Law Act.
This bill would allow the House or Senate to sue the president of the United States
if the president or Executive Branch employees fail to administer or enforce the law as required by Article II, Section 3, of the U.S. Constitution.
The hallmark of the Obama presidency has become his rewriting and selective enforcement of the law, from unilaterally changing Obamacare to preventing the deportation of select illegal immigrants.
The presidents behavior suggests he views Congress as an inconvenience rather than a co-equal branch of government. This imperial mindset threatens the stability of our government and erodes the confidence Americans have in our democracy.
The ENFORCE the Law Act provides Congress the tool of expedited civil action to respond to, and remedy, executive overreach.
The Constitution requires the president to take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed. Under the bill we passed, that requirement would be upheld, checks and balances would be at work, and our liberty would be protected.
Freedom First,

NATIONAL JOURNAL: Unpacking Airline Ticket Prices
Who do you blame if you are upset about the cost of a plane ticket? The airlines, right? Maybe not for long. Several members of Congress want people to know that the government also has a hand in jacking up those prices.
