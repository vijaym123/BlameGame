Memorial Day
As we prepare to honor the men and women
who have paid the ultimate sacrifice for
our freedom this Memorial Day, Marco gave
thanks for the American heroes, both past
and present, who have answered the call to
defend freedom.
Rubio: On Memorial Day we
remember the American heroes who have
paid the ultimate sacrifice in order to
preserve the freedom we all hold dear.
These heroes are Americas greatest
blessing, and our nation is safer,
stronger and more prosperous because of
their sacrifices.
And while Memorial Day
commemorates those we have lost, we also
give thanks for the service of the
American armed forces currently deployed
all over the world and our veterans here
at home. This day of remembrance provides
us the opportunity to take the time, both
as a nation and personally, to reflect on
the sacrifices they make on a regular
basis, and of our obligation as a nation
to honor that sacrifice by caring for our
veterans that carry on the memories of
their fallen brothers and sisters in
arms.
I am honored to work in the
Senate on behalf of all of our military
men, women and families, and this
weekend, I join my fellow Americans in
honoring our servicemen and women, both
past and present, whose bravery and
sacrifice has protected the freedom we
each hold dear.
May God bless you, may God
bless our men and women in uniform, and
may God always bless the United States of
America.
On Friday, Marco also
took
a moment , to thank the 1,000 soldiers
from The Old Guard who participated in
Flags In, a four-hour event
during which they honor our fallen service
members at Arlington National Cemetery, VA
by placing a flag on the over 228,000
headstones in the cemetery.
Rubio: On Cuban Independence Day:
Freedom Is The Goal
On Wednesday, Marco marked Cuban
Independence Day with an
op-ed
in the
Miami Herald
calling for our
American leaders to stand up for the
principles of freedom and human rights in
Cuba and around the world.
Read an excerpt below and the full op-ed
here .
Rubio: I believe
Americas role in relation to Cuba
is very simple: We should provide
unconditional support to Cubas
pro-democracy movement, promote greater
access to uncensored information for the
Cuban people, and deprive the Castro
regime of funding for its repressive
apparatus. The United States must also
support groups like the Ladies in White,
who are doing some of the most important
work inside Cuba to expose the regime and
lay the foundation for what will
eventually be a free Cuba.
During a
Senate
Foreign Relations Committee hearing
later that day, Marco also cautioned Obama
Administration officials of the negative
consequences of easing travel restrictions
to Cuba.
Rubio: If you travel to Cuba,
if you stay in a Cuban hotel, in all
likelihood youre staying in a
hotel run by the Cuban military; if you
rent a car, youre renting it from
the Cuban military; if you fill up your
gas tank, youre filling up from
the Cuban military. nd I would add
that if you stay at a hotel, you are
staying, in all likelihood, in a
confiscated property, a land that was
taken from a previous private owner, who
was never compensated for it.
To address the issue of properties
confiscated by the Cuban regime without
compensating the owners, Marco and Senator
David Vitter (R-LA) introduced the
Cuban
U.S. Claims Settlement Act ,
legislation that would require Cuba to
address unsettled and unpaid legal claims
with the U.S. Learn more about the bill
here .
Rubio Reintroduces Florida Fisheries
Improvement Act
Earlier this week, Marco reintroduced
the
Florida
Fisheries Improvement Act , a
bill to improve fisheries management in the
Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic regions.
The legislation is the result of multiple
hearings, meetings, and conversations with
stakeholders from Florida, and its purpose
is to begin outlining the states
priorities for the eventual reauthorization
of the Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA).
Read Marcos statement about the
bill below and learn more about its major
provisions
here .
Rubio: Floridas
fisheries are a national treasure that
provide direct and indirect benefits to
our local, state and national economies
by feeding Americans across the country
and boosting tourism in our coastal
communities. While there is more work to
be done, this bill would ensure necessary
improvements to management and data
collection are made to fully optimize our
fisheries and help advance
Floridas interests when it comes
time to amend the Magnuson-Stevens Act. I
will continue to work with Floridians and
my colleagues in Congress to fight
against any misguided federal directives
that threaten Floridians way of
life and economic livelihoods.
Constituent Casework Corner
Carolyn, a constituent from Palm Coast,
requested assistance with the inaccurate
billing of both Tricare and Medicare for
her husbands oxygen supply. Senator
Rubios staff contacted both agencies
and sent them the evidence that Carolyn had
provided, and the company supplying the
oxygen was made aware and voluntarily
refunded Tricare and Medicare for the cost
of the oxygen.
