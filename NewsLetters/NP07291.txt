Dear Fellow Nevadan,
Today we
celebrate the 49th anniversary since the passage of the Voting Rights
Act. This landmark legislation sought to ensure every Americans basic
right to vote by outlawing racial discrimination at the ballot box.
The Voting Right Act prohibited efforts to suppress the right to
vote through literacy tests, poll taxes, and intimidation of voters,
and addressed systemic voter disenfranchisement throughout the
South. This law, which is among our most important voting rights laws,
is now under attack.
The Voting Rights Act has a long
history of strong, bipartisan support; it had been renewed on five
occasions, most recently in 2006 for another 25 years. I supported the
renewal of the Voting Rights Act, which passed overwhelmingly in both the
Senate and the House of Representatives. But last year, the Supreme
Court struck down a crucial section of the Voting Rights Act. In a 5-4
decision, the Supreme Court effectively eliminated an essential
enforcement mechanism for the laws prohibition of racial and other forms of
discrimination in voting. The Supreme Courts decision
was deeply disturbing and threatens voter participation among
African Americans, who have historically and disproportionately
experienced discrimination when voting.
The Supreme
Court claimed that the racial discrimination that originally
justified the Voting Rights Act no longer characterizes voting
conditions today. But we need look no further than the recent election to
see the unfortunate reality that race-based voting discrimination still
exists in our country.
In 2012, there were efforts in some
states to do everything possible to suppress voter turnout in minority
communities. Federal courts cited the Voting Rights Act when striking
down discriminatory voter ID laws in South Carolina and Texas.
Republicans in Ohio, Florida, and North Carolina attempted to reduce access
to early voting, which is largely used by minority voters. This
is unacceptable, and it reinforces that the Voting Rights Act remains
necessary.
In Las Vegas last month, Vice President Biden
spoke at the 105th annual NAACP convention; there he said, America is
strongest when no ones voice is diminished, for when one voice is
diminished, all others are in jeopardy. I agree with the Vice President.
And I believe it is now up to Congress to right the wrong of this
decision to ensure that no voice is diminished. We should be doing
everything possible to encourage participation in the democratic process and
ensure every eligible voter is able to exercise his or her right to
cast a ballot. In honor of the millions of people whose advocacy
engendered and protected the Voting Rights Act, the Senate must act
to fully restore it.
