>From The Desk Of Congressman Yoho
Friends,
In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln - along with Congress - created the
office of Commissioner of Internal Revenue. This new position, the
predecessor to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), was put in place to
help pay for war expenses during the Civil War. Fast-forward to 1913
and the country saw the ratification of the 16th Amendment. This
addition to our Constitution gave Congress the power to "lay and
collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without
apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any
census or enumeration."
Today the IRS is a bureaucracy that exercises a tremendous amount of
power. With great power comes the potential for abuse and that is just
what happened. Last year, Former Director of the Exempt Organizations
Division of the IRS Lois Lerner admitted the IRS treated groups
unfairly, including targeting the 501(c)(4) applications of
organizations with "tea party" or "patriot" in their names. The IRS
even went so far as to ask for donor lists, which is a further
violation of IRS policy. Ms. Lerner's revelation about the IRS is
reprehensible.
The targeting of groups by the federal government is
wrong. It was wrong during the Nixon Administrations and it is wrong
under the Obama Administration.
Rein in the IRS:
I voted in favor of H.R. 3865, The Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs
by the IRS Act. The bill will block - for one year - the ability of the
Treasury Department or IRS to modify regulations addressing the
allowable political activities of tax-exempt 501(c)(4) organizations.
In November, the IRS, proposed revisions that would bar such groups
from voter registration efforts and get-out-the-vote drives shortly
before elections, in an effort to clarify what activities constitute
promotion of social welfare, which many view as a continuation of the
IRS' abusive practice of targeting conservative groups.
More transparent regulatory process:
In addition to my vote to rein in the IRS, I voted in favor of H.R.
2804, The All Economic Regulations are Transparent Act (ALERT). There
are thousands of pages of federal regulations that cost the U.S.
economy about $1.8 trillion annually. Despite these staggering figures,
by the end of 2013 the Administration continues to add new regulations
at a steady clip.
The ALERT Act makes numerous changes to the federal rule-making
process, including by requiring agencies to consider new criteria when
issuing rules, such as alternatives to rules proposals and their
potential costs and benefits; by requiring agencies to review the
"indirect" costs of proposed and existing rules; by requiring federal
agencies to file monthly reports on the status of their rule-making
activities, which must be posted online; and by modifying the process
used to develop consent decrees and settlement agreements to give
affected third parties an opportunity to intervene in the process.
Some regulation is necessary. However, the implementation of costly and
burdensome regulations hurts our economy and stands in the way of job
creation. I will do all I can to make the rule making process
transparent and fight to loosen the regulatory chains that hold back
the engines of growth and prosperity in America.
Sincerely,

Bills I Sponsored
I sponsored H.R. 3725, The Veterans Entrepreneurs Act. This legislation
amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a business-related tax credit
for franchise fees and helps offset costs for veterans starting a small
business. This bill is an important step in ensuring our heroes are
given the opportunity to put to work the invaluable skills they have
learned while serving and become entrepreneurs. The spirit of
entrepreneurship is one of the many things that has made the U.S. great
and it is no surprise that such a large portion of the veteran
community are entrepreneurs. This bill will open the doors to
entrepreneurship to even more veterans, creating more jobs while
bettering our economy.

From
The
Desk
Of
Congressman
Yoho
Friends,
In
1862,
President
Abraham
Lincoln
&#8211;
along
with
Congress
&#8211;
created
the
office
of
Commissioner
of
Internal
Revenue.
This
new
position,
the
predecessor
to
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
(IRS),
was
put
in
place
to
help
pay
for
war
expenses
during
the
Civil
War.
Fast-forward
to
1913
and
the
country
saw
the
ratification
of
the
16th
Amendment.
This
addition
to
our
Constitution
gave
Congress
the
power
to
&#8220; lay
and
collect
taxes
on
incomes,
from
whatever
source
derived,
without
apportionment
among
the
several
States,
and
without
regard
to
any
census
or
enumeration .&#8221;
Today
the
IRS
is
a
bureaucracy
that
exercises
a
tremendous
amount
of
power.
With
great
power
comes
the
potential
for
abuse
and
that
is
just
what
happened.
Last
year,
Former
Director
of
the
Exempt
Organizations
Division
of
the
IRS
Lois
Lerner
admitted
the
IRS
treated
groups
unfairly,
including
targeting
the
501(c)(4)
applications
of
organizations
with
"tea
party"
or
"patriot"
in
their
names. The
IRS
even
went
so
far
as
to
ask
for
donor
lists,
which
is
a
further
violation
of
IRS
policy. Ms.
Lerner's
revelation
about
the
IRS
is
reprehensible.
The
targeting
of
groups
by
the
federal
government
is
wrong.
It
was
wrong
during
the
Nixon
Administrations
and
it
is
wrong
under
the
Obama
Administration.
Rein
in
the
IRS:
I
voted
in
favor
of
H.R.
3865,
The
Stop
Targeting
of
Political
Beliefs
by
the
IRS
Act .
The
bill
will
block
-
for
one
year
-
the
ability
of
the
Treasury
Department
or
IRS
to
modify
regulations
addressing
the
allowable
political
activities
of
tax-exempt
501(c)(4)
organizations.
In
November,
the
IRS,
proposed
revisions
that
would
bar
such
groups
from
voter
registration
efforts
and
get-out-the-vote
drives
shortly
before
elections,
in
an
effort
to
clarify
what
activities
constitute
promotion
of
social
welfare,
which
many
view
as
a
continuation
of
the
IRS&#8217;
abusive
practice
of
targeting
conservative
groups.
More
transparent
regulatory
process:
In
addition
to
my
vote
to
rein
in
the
IRS,
I
voted
in
favor
of
H.R.
2804 ,
The
All
Economic
Regulations
are
Transparent
Act
(ALERT) .
There
are
thousands
of
pages
of
federal
regulations
that
cost
the
U.S.
economy
about
$1.8
trillion
annually.
Despite
these
staggering
figures,
by
the
end
of
2013
the
Administration
continues
to
add
new
regulations
at
a
steady
clip.
The
ALERT
Act
makes
numerous
changes
to
the
federal
rule-making
process,
including
by
requiring
agencies
to
consider
new
criteria
when
issuing
rules,
such
as
alternatives
to
rules
proposals
and
their
potential
costs
and
benefits;
by
requiring
agencies
to
review
the
&#8220;indirect&#8221;
costs
of
proposed
and
existing
rules;
by
requiring
federal
agencies
to
file
monthly
reports
on
the
status
of
their
rule-making
activities,
which
must
be
posted
online;
and
by
modifying
the
process
used
to
develop
consent
decrees
and
settlement
agreements
to
give
affected
third
parties
an
opportunity
to
intervene
in
the
process.
Some
regulation
is
necessary.
However,
the
implementation
of
costly
and
burdensome
regulations
hurts
our
economy
and
stands
in
the
way
of
job
creation.
I
will
do
all
I
can
to
make
the
rule
making
process
transparent
and
fight
to
loosen
the
regulatory
chains
that
hold
back
the
engines
of
growth
and
prosperity
in
America.
