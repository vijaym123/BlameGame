Cosponsoring a New Constitutional
Amendment to Restore the Balance of Power Between the Federal Government and
the States
5/23/14
This week in Washington,
Congressman Doug Lamborn joined eighteen of his Republican colleagues in
cosponsoring Congressman Rob Bishop's (R-UT) Repeal Amendment. The
Amendment
will provide States with the ability to repeal any federal
law, regulation, tax, or unfunded mandate if two-thirds of the State
legislatures are in agreement.
AMENDMENT TEXT
Any provision of law or regulation of the United States
may be repealed by the several states, and such a repeal shall be
effective when the legislatures of two-thirds of the several states
approve resolutions for this purpose that particularly describe the same
provision or provisions of law or regulation to be
repealed.
KEY
POINTS
The Repeal Amendment would require
two-thirds of the states to collectively agree that repeal of a
federal policy is necessary.
The states vote to proceed with repeal
action in their state
legislatures.
Once consensus is
reached by a supermajority of the states, the bill is then sent back to
Congress to be reevaluated. Congress may vote to uphold the law a final
time.
The framers of the Constitution clearly intended for
there to be balance of power between the three branches of governments.
Equally important and often overlooked is the intent for there
to be a balance of power between the states and federal government.
This is clear in the 10th Amendment.
The concept of distinct
powers for people, states, and the federal government outline in the
10th Amendment is known as Federalism.
Over the last 50
years, an aggressive federal government, politically charged Supreme
Court decisions, and a few constitutional amendments have blurred the
delineation of these
powers.
Over the years, specific provisions of
the Constitution granting power to the federal government have been
read liberally resulting in overreaching court decisions.
States have lost the tools necessary to maintain their power as is
intended by the U.S. Constitution.
The Repeal Amendment would provide
a necessary tool to help them place a check on the federal
government.
If two-thirds of the states agree to repeal the bill, chances
are pretty good that there is problem and further review is necessary.
Some may claim that a two-thirds majority gives less populated states
far too much power. Contrary to this point, each state, regardless of
size, should have the ability to protect itself from federal overreach
and intrusion.
