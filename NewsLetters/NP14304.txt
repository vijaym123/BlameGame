Dear Friends,
As reported earlier this week in the Charleston
Daily Mail , about 8,800 West Virginians have been notified that their
existing health plans are being canceled in 2014. While the president
said today that he will allow insurers to offer plans next year that
do not comply with Obamacare's minimum benefits rules, West Virginia's
families should never have been placed in this position. Families are
confused about their coverage, worried that they will lose their
doctors, and unsure if they will be able to afford to be
insured.
I have heard from West Virginians from all across the Second
District who have received cancelation notices or simply can't access
healthcare.gov. I spoke on the House floor earlier this week about the
stories I'm hearing from you and my support for the Keep Your Health Plan
Act. This bill, which the House will vote on tomorrow, is simple: It
will save Americans from the broken promises of Obamacare and allow their
current healthcare plans to be offered for another year.
Please click here to watch my floor
remarks .
If you have questions about your health insurance or
concerns about losing your coverage, please
email me
or
contact one of my
offices in Charleston, Martinsburg or Washington .
VETERANS DAY
When America has asked for help, West
Virginians have answered the call. I visited Charles Town on Monday to say
thank you to our Eastern Pandhandle veterans in person and
participate in the Veterans of Foreign Wars/American Legion Veterans Day
ceremony.
Our veterans have been called upon to make special
sacrifices, spending months or even years away from their families, facing
danger in foreign lands. We as a nation cannot let any veteran
young
or old; male or female; Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine, Coast Guard,
Reserves or National Guard
slip through the cracks.
We as
a nation must provide for our veterans, and we must care for the
wounds that can be seen as well as the wounds that are less visible. I will
continue to support legislation to improve standards of care for our
veterans, identify and treat post-traumatic stress disorder, and speed
up the claims process at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Our
veterans deserve nothing less.
This week in the House, we
passed a 1.5 percent cost-of-living adjustment for veterans, which
includes disability compensation and survivor benefits. Having already
passed in the Senate, the bill now goes to the presidents desk for
signature. This cost-of-living increase is a timely gesture of
appreciation for their years of service, sacrifice and dedication on behalf of
our nation.
WATER INFRASTRUCTURE BILL
I was named
this week to the conference committee on the Water Resources Reform
and Development Act. The conference committee will work out an agreement
on differences between the House and Senate-passed water
infrastructure bills. The House passed its bill last month, while the Senate
passed its version in May.
The Houses passage of this important
water transportation bill was a victory for American jobs and West
Virginias economy. I look forward to working with my House and Senate
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reach an agreement to ensure
efficient and effective water transportation, protect the inland
waterways trust fund, and reduce the number of incomplete river construction
projects.
