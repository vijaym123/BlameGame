&ldquo;Control of the Senate is resting on a handful of incredibly close races&rdquo;
Friend -- This election is SO CLOSE. The latest projection? 50 Democrats &ndash; 50 Republicans.
We CAN win five Southern states and completely upend the political landscape... but we&rsquo;re in danger of having all that RIPPED AWAY if we can&rsquo;t counter the GOP&rsquo;s attack ads!
Our FINAL two-week-out advertising buy deadline is midnight tonight.
It&rsquo;s the most critical moment of the election: if we can&rsquo;t make a robust ad buy, the Republicans will STEAMROLL us.
But if you contribute before midnight, we&rsquo;ll be able to fight them on the air and on the ground and WIN.
Friend, Democrats are counting on you. Will you please pitch in before midnight? Your gift will be triple-matched, giving it FOUR TIMES the effect!!
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
We can still make the GOP suffer what
ABC News
reports would be &ldquo;the most crushing failure in recent political history.&rdquo;
But time is running out -- we only have until midnight.
Friend, now is the time. Will you give so we can fight to win? Your gift will be triple-matched for just 12 more hours!!
Let&#39;s win this,
