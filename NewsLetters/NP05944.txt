UNLOCK THE MATCH: David you're just one step away from
doubling your impact.
cheri's first re-election is at stake, so this opportunity couldn't have come at a better time. help us reach 2OO donations before midnight to unlock the match.
David --
FIRST:
a right-wing Super PAC launched a massive ad buy against Cheri
THEN:
Boehner launched a staggering $4,8OO,OOO.OO offensive against Illinois Democrats
That could&rsquo;ve
wrecked
our grassroots campaign. BUT -- early this morning, a group of generous donors agreed to
MATCH ALL GIFTS
to Cheri&rsquo;s Democratic campaign if we can reach 25O donations by midnight!!! That means your gift will be DOUBLED and we WILL have the resources to respond to Boehner&rsquo;s onslaught!!!
So David, here&rsquo;s the plan: we need you to stop what you&rsquo;re doing, chip in for Cheri, and help unlock the match.
David -- ARE YOU IN? Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks,
