"I came to Washington to work for God, FDR, and the millions of forgotten, plain common workingmen."
Friend,
Those are the words of former Labor Secretary, Frances Perkins.
On March 4, 1933, after his inauguration ceremonies, President Franklin Roosevelt appointed Ms. Perkins as his Secretary of Labor, a position she held for twelve years, longer than any other Secretary of Labor and making her the first woman to hold a cabinet position in the United States.
As Secretary of Labor Perkins played a key role writing New Deal legislation, including minimum wage laws.
However, one of her most important contributions came in 1934 as chairwoman of the President's Committee on Economic Security.
In this position she was involved in all aspects of the reports and hearings that ultimately resulted in the Social Security Act of 1935.
In Pennsylvania's 17th district nearly, 140,000 retirees, people with disabilities, spouses, and children receive $1.8 billion dollars in Social Security benefits.
We must do everything we can to secure, and enhance the Social Security program.
I will always work to ensure that seniors can rely on Social Security.
Sincerely,
Labor Secretary Frances Perkins stands behind FDR as he Signs Social Security into law.
