LEGISLATIVE
September 11, 2014
D e ar Friends,
Our country was forever changed thirteen years ago today, when
terrorists bent on destroying our nation hijacked four passenger
planes.
Its unthinkable, even
today, that two of those planes would destroy the World Trade Center and
that a third would strike the Pentagon. We lost nearly 3,000 innocent
lives on September 11, 2001, and scores more were impacted by the
tragic events of that horrific day.
First responders risked their own lives as they
rushed to the Twin Towers, hoping to save others, while volunteers from
across the country helped sift through rubble and debris in the days
that followed.
Far too many of these everyday heroes
were exposed to toxins that endangered their health. I was pleased to
co-sponsor the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010,
to ensure that we meet their health needs.
Thanks to
the Zadroga Act, the 9/11 Compensation Fund was re-opened and those
who sustained physical injuries or developed a chronic illness can
apply for assistance. Claims can also be filed on behalf of the
deceased.
I urge everyone who became sick as a result of
working or volunteering at Ground Zero, but has not yet filed a claim, to
visit
www.vcf.gov
or call the helpline at (855) 885-1555 for more
information.
America lost its innocence on September 11th, but we
can never forget the sacrifices that have been made following that
tragic day. We must continue to be vigilant, and to protect our country
from the threat of terror.
Sincerely,
Eliot L. Engel
MEMBER OF
CONGRESS
