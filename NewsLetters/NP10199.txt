(April 29, 2014 - U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen on the
Senate floor calls for increasing the minimum wage to $10.10. Click to
watch)
Dear friend,
I was disappointed
that this week the Senate failed to advance a bill to increase the
minimum wage to $10.10. A minority of senators blocked action on this
common-sense proposal that would have helped so many people around the
country
including giving more than 110,000 people in New Hampshire a much
deserved raise.
I know that times have been tough since
the economic collapse in 2008 for many families in New Hampshire. And
while weve seen improvement in recent years, there are still too many
struggling to make ends meet. Thats why this increase is so important.
It would have helped lift 10,000 people in New Hampshire out of
poverty, and it also would have helped more than 4,500 New Hampshire
veterans earn a living and stay out of poverty. And it would have injected
more than $90 million into our states economy. Together, these facts
underscore the economic benefits of increasing the minimum
wage.
While Im discouraged that we were unable to pass a raise
in the minimum wage this week, I will not give up. Ill continue
working to get hardworking Granite Staters the raise they deserve and fight
to boost the minimum wage.
Sincerely,
Jeanne
Shaheen
