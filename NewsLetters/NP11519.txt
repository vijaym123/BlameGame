Presidents
FY2015 Budget: Never Balances,
$1.8 Trillion in New
Taxes
This past Tuesday, President Obama
released his budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2015
late, as it has been
5 of the 6 years he's been in office. Its a budget that fully
embraces the false notion that Washington's record deficits and climbing debt
can somehow be controlled by massively increasing spending and hiking
taxes. Right now, the federal government is spending record amounts
on social welfare programs. And yet, 1 in 5 children live in poverty
and 15 percent of all Americans are impoverished. Instead of examining
the efficacy of these programs to provide help for more people, the
presidents budget just piles on more government
spending.
His plan proposes $1.8 trillion in new
taxes, and never, ever comes into balance. Under the presidents budget,
federal spending would increase by 63 percent from current levels over
the next decade, and the national debt would skyrocket to $25 trillion
in 2024.
As vice chairman of
the House Budget Committee, I look forward to working with my
colleagues in the days ahead to produce a budget that is a positive contrast to
President Obama's
a better alternative that lowers taxes, reduces
government spending, repeals Obamacare, eases the regulatory burden,
repairs the social safety net and pays off our national debt. Thats the
kind of leadership we need at such a critical point in our nation's
history.
