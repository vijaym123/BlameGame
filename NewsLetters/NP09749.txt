Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Throughout our history, women have played an integral part in shaping our American heritage. As we honor our mothers during this Mothers Day season, I am grateful for the investment of my own mom in my life, as well as for Sandy and her dedication to our six children.

As we celebrated National Teacher Appreciation Week last week, I was honored to recognize the impact of so many incredible educators like my fifth grade teacher, Elma Smith, from Concord Park Elementary in Orlando. She concentrated on key elements of a good education and I became a much better student because of her.
I have had the privilege of meeting so many dedicated men and women throughout our community and am grateful for their commitment to training our next generation.

Last Tuesday, I joined the Orange County Asian Committee in celebrating Asian Pacific American Heritage Month and recognizing the contributions they have made in our community. The United States has the honor of uniting personal histories, cultures, and heritages, and I was happy to commemorate that distinction with them. When different cultures come to our country, they become an integral part of who we are as a community. As they pledge allegiance to our flag, we welcome their presence and celebrate the contributions they offer.

Members from Central Florida Partnership came to my office last week to discuss my support for the Modeling, Simulation and Training (MS&amp;T) industry in Central Florida and the jobs it generates in our local economy. Representatives from local municipalities, Visit Florida, Walt Disney Parks &amp; Resorts, SeaWorld Parks &amp; Entertainment, the Florida High Tech Corridor Council, University of Central Florida, and Orlando Health were among those who traveled to Washington to combine their efforts to support policies that will generate jobs and grow our economy in the Central Florida community.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Recently, a constituent from Eustis contacted my office after encountering an issue with his passport renewal application.
The middle name in his old passport had been misspelled and when he asked to renew it, the passport agency requested another application due to this previous error. The constituent thought he had provided all of the required documentation, and was not sure why they were requesting a new application. My office submitted a Congressional Inquiry on his behalf and received notification that after reviewing the situation, the agency was issuing the renewed passport with the correct spelling of his middle name.
Constituent Services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
The White House has repeatedly ignored laws, withheld evidence, and refused to disclose information. Do you support the creation of a bipartisan, select committee to uncover the facts about the Administrations handling of events surrounding Benghazi and its aftermath?

Legislative Update:
Last week was busy in Washington, as the House of Representatives
voted for a special counsel
that will investigate the IRS targeting of taxpayers and hold Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions from the House Oversight Committee. You are truthful with the IRS and deserve truth in return.
I also voted for establishment of the
House Select Committee on the Events Surrounding the 2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi
to shine a light on that dark day so that we may endeavor to bring justice for four American patriots and their loved ones. The terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012, claimed the lives of four of our citizens including the U.S. Ambassador. Since that time, no arrests have been made and no justice has been served. Questions surrounding the events of that day remain unanswered.
Finally, last Friday, I voted in favor of H.R. 10, the
Success and Opportunity through Quality Charter Schools Act , bipartisan legislation to expand and improve support for charter schools. Regardless of your zip code, America should be the land of opportunity, full of endless potential. Regrettably, for those in certain school districts across our nation, a failing local school can write a students future before they have the opportunity to determine it through their own effort.
As schools of choice, charter schools must measure up to the expectations of the toughest critics of our students education
their parents. Whether it is offering an escape from an underperforming school or the benefits of a specialized curriculum, the bipartisan Success and Opportunity through Quality Charter School Act will empower parents of students to put their child within reach of the limitless opportunities a good education affords.
