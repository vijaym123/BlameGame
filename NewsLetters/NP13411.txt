December 29, 2013
Friends,
It is hard
to believe this year has come to an end.
While 2013 seemed to fly
by, the year has been full of
firsts.
This is the first year of the newly formed Seventh Congressional
District has had representation in Congress.
The first year Wrenzie and
I have lived out of a suitcase.
This is the first year I
experienced the political gridlock in Washington and frustration that comes
with it.
This year Wrenzie and I visited Israel and the Holy
Land for the first time, which was an incredible trip that will forever
change the way we reflect at Christmas.
And finally, but
certainly not least, this is the first year I have had the privilege of
representing you and your family in our Nations
Capitol.
I am hopeful the next year holds another season of
firsts.
I hope that Congress will agree begin following a Budget Plan,
instead of lurching from crisis to crisis.
I hope that the Water
Resources Bill is signed by the President for the first time since
2007.
I hope that my colleagues and I can reform our antiquated tax
code for the first time in decades so that we can restore some
certainty in the marketplace.
Finally, I hope that Washington will
stop focusing on elections and instead focus on what it can do to get our
economy moving forward and people back to
work.
When I return to Washington next week to begin the second
session of Congress, I want to know which issues you and your families
want me to focus on. Please take a moment to answer the brief poll below,
so I can better serve you.
If you received and completed my
instaPoll last Friday, please disregard the poll below.
I hope you
have had a very Merry and Blessed Christmas Season and wish you a
Happy New Year.
Sincerely,
As we
wrap-up the first session of the 113th Congress, I would like to hear
what you and your family would like for me to focus on during the second
session of Congress.
What are your biggest priorities for the next legislative
year? Jobs &amp;

have no opinion.
