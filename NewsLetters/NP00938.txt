Week in Review
Dear Friends,
I've spent this week traveling on an official bipartisan Congressional Delegation visit to the Middle East and Europe led by the Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security.
As
Chair of the bipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel , this trip has served as a historic opportunity to examine the ever-evolving threats to the U.S. homeland, especially from foreign-trained fighters.
Meetings with Iraqi Officials
Our first stop was in Baghdad,
where we met with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi, senior Iraqi officials, and U.S. troops to discuss threats posed by ISIS.
Standing with Israel
It was a high honor to meet with our friend and ally, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
It is a frightening truth that a nuclear Iran poses a clear existential threat to the State of Israel, and our meeting with the Prime Minister underscored the importance of caution and congressional oversight in a nuclear deal with Iran.
We must stand in support of Israel, our strongest ally in the region, against the threat of a nuclear Iran and for our shared democratic values.
Stops in Ankara and Istanbul, Turkey
In Ankara,
we met with senior officials from the Ministry of Interior and Foreign Affairs.
We visited with airport security officials at the International Airport in Istanbul.

Meetings in Berlin, Germany
In Berlin, we met with German government officials,
including our counterparts in the German parliament, to discuss foreign fighter travel and broader counterterrorism strategy.
We also met with U.S. Embassy officials on security cooperation.
This week's Congressional Delegation visit has been hugely important in fostering a dialogue with our allies in the Middle East and Europe.
For me, it has been an incredibly insightful trip and our Task Force will be able to use the knowledge from this trip to continue the fight against violent extremists.
We will work closely with our allies in the region to identify individuals who pose a threat to the homeland and prevent them from boarding flights bound for the United States.
As always, thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter.
Sincerely,
John Katko (NY-24)
Member of Congress
