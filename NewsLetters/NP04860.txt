Do you want Democrats to win this election,
Friend?
If so,
I need your help
before midnight tonight. Otherwise, we could be in real trouble.
I won&rsquo;t mince words, Friend. Either we raise enough before midnight&#39;s deadline to fund this weekend&rsquo;s Final Get Out The Vote Push, or we risk falling behind in key battlegrounds that we absolutely have to win in order to keep the Senate.
You can&#39;t say &quot;I&#39;ll help out later.&quot;
The absolute last deadline for our final weekend GOTV push is at midnight tonight. There is no later.
So I&rsquo;ll ask directly: Please pitch in to the DSCC&rsquo;s Final Weekend GOTV Push before the final deadline in 5 hours. We&rsquo;ll triple-match your gift.
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
Friend, I want to thank you right now.
You&rsquo;ve put us in striking distance of our first million dollar day in history
-- all from grassroots donations. Incredible!
But this final weekend GOTV push will decide it all.
We&#39;ve got to equip volunteers, knock on doors, and contact Democratic voters, and this is our very last chance to fund it all.
We&rsquo;ve asked so much of you, but we&rsquo;ve got to ask once more.
Will you pitch in to support the DSCC&rsquo;s Final GOTV Push? Gifts will be triple-matched until midnight tonight.
Thank you,
Joe Biden
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
Thank you for your continued support.
