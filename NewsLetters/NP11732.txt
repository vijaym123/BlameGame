Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Last Monday, I spoke at the BusinessForce Luncheon in Orlando, where many of the Central Florida community and business leaders were gathered. I shared our
Constituent Service Guide
with them and shared how my office can assist constituents when they run into red tape or experience personal issues with a federal agency. I also provided an update on some of the most recent legislative topics in Washington, including ongoing efforts to reform our health insurance system and rein in wasteful spending.

Before heading up to Washington on Tuesday, I was notified that yet another of our bright young people from Central Florida had received an appointment to a United States Service Academy. On the way to the airport, I stopped by Boone High School in Orlando to congratulate Brandon Rodriguez on his appointment to the United States Merchant Marine Academy. It was great to join Boone High Schools administration and Brandons family to celebrate this prestigious appointment and the opportunity that he has been given to serve our country.

This week, I met with several groups of constituents who came to share their perspectives and thoughts on different issues. Jim Ferber, Wayne Humphrey and members of the Central Florida YMCA shared an update on their services and the legislative issues that impact the work they are doing in our community. Constituents from Windermere and Orlando also met with me on behalf of the National Down Syndrome Society, which has been working tirelessly to help pass the ABLE Act. I cosponsored this critical legislation that would empower families to improve the quality of life of loved ones with disabilities.
Some of the other meetings I had this week included:
- Florida Association of Health Underwriters
- National Association of Convenience Stores
- Florida Association of Broadcasters
- The US Travel Association
- National Treasury Employees Union

On Saturday, my family joined me in Eustis for the 112th Annual GeorgeFest Parade. Honoring the life and legacy of George Washington, GeorgeFest is one of the largest community events in Eustis, spanning three days of celebration and culminating in the Saturday parade. Their theme this year was Its a Grand Old Flag. It was great to join the North Lake community as we remembered our first president and celebrated Americas bright history and strong heritage.

On Sunday, I had the great privilege of participating in the Home at Last Welcome to West Orange reception for Marine Sergeant Stephen Tovet and his wife Krystina. When their house is completed, the Home at Last program (part of the West Orange Habitat for Humanity) will have provided housing for six disabled veterans and their families. It was an honor to welcome the Tovet family and thank them for their incredible sacrifice for our country. For more information on Sgt. Stephen Tovet and the Home at Last program, you can
visit their website.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Late last year, a mother from Clermont contacted my office on behalf of her daughter who has Down syndrome. The daughter had been receiving survivor benefits until her 18th birthday, when she would have become eligible for disability. Although the family filed for Social Security Disability, they did not receive a response, so they called my office. We contacted the Social Security Administration (SSA) and discovered that the claim from last year was unable to be processed because of missing documentation.
My office worked with the constituent and SSA to obtain the correct information, and the daughter finally received her disability benefits, as well as a retro check from SSA that covered the interim time period.
Constituent Services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
Federal regulations can serve to help to keep our air and water clean, our food safe and workplaces free from preventable danger.
Many times however, regulations cost job creators and small businesses a lot of money in compliance costs that could otherwise be used to create jobs or expand while not providing commiserate benefit to the public.
Do you think Congress should require a thorough cost analysis of regulations before they are implemented?
Yes
No
I don't know

Legislative Update:
Last week, we voted on several pieces of legislation that focused on stopping the government abuse in Washington. Some of the bills that I supported and that passed the House included:
-
Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act of 2014 , which hinders the IRS from implementing any new regulations that restrict constitutionally protected political speech while Congress pursues its oversight investigations.
-
Achieving Less in Regulation and Requiring Transparency Act of 2014
(the ALERRT Act) that brings much-needed reform and transparency to the process by which Washington bureaucrats make and implement federal regulations
-
Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act , which allows for greater consumer freedom to switch wireless carriers
-
Private Property Rights Protection Act
that guards against abusive use of the governments "eminent domain."
