HIGHLIGHTS IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
Commemorating the 50th anniversary of Head Start - 68 of us in the House of Representatives have introduced a resolution to mark the 50th anniversary of Head Start , which provides early childhood education, health, and nutrition services to low-income children and their families. We have 432 children in 10 Head Start centers in the Northern Mariana Islands. The Public School System receives about $1.7 million in federal funds each year to run the program. This amount has not changed over the years because Head Start allocations to all the states and territories are always based on the previous year's funding. When the NMI joined the program, decades ago, funding was set at the level the Commonwealth government said it needed to run Head Start. And funding has remained locked in ever since, even as costs and the number of eligible children have changed. Other states and territories face the same problem. The U.S. Virgin Islands, for instance, receives $8,807 per child served. American Samoa only gets $1,611. And Guam and the Northern Marianas are in the middle with $4,401 and $3,596 per child, respectively. Head Start was last reauthorized in 2007, before the Northern Marianas had representation in Congress. Today, I am a member of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, which has jurisdiction over the program. So, if the majority decides to put Head Start on the agenda, I will use the opportunity to work for an increase in funding for the NMI.
President's budget highlights for the Northern Mariana Islands - President Obama sent his fiscal year 2016 budget proposal
to Congress on Monday. While the Republican majority generally declares the President's budget "dead on arrival," it does provide a baseline for the spending decisions Congress will make. A few of the President's proposals that particularly benefit the Northern Marianas include:
*
Continuation of the higher set-aside for water and sewer funding from the Environmental Protection Agency. The President's budget calls for continuation of the 1.5 percent set-aside for insular areas for both the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water grant programs. The set-asides increased in fiscal year 2010 at my request. They had been 0.28 percent and 0.33 percent, respectively. The resulting $47 million has helped us get very close to 24/7 water service on Saipan.
*
Increase in Assistance to Territories funding managed by the Office of Insular Affairs. The President seeks a $13 million increase in funding with an emphasis on support for adaptation and resilience initiatives which will address climate change impacts in our islands. Rising sea levels that erode beaches, ocean acidification that eats away coral reefs, and changes in rainfall and storm intensity that endanger farmers, businesses, and homeowners all result from climate change.
*
SNAP pilot benefits implemented. The President's budget includes $13.5 million to raise food stamp benefits in the Northern Marianas as part of the five-year food stamp pilot program I was able to have enacted in the Agricultural Act of 2014, Public Law 113-79 . The money is in addition to our regular block grant of $12.148 million, which is also part of the President's budget.
*
Investments in education funding from Head Start to college. The budget requests over $1.5 billion to expand Head Start and provide more children with full-day, full-year services. There is also an increase of $1 billion in the Title I funding that supports K-12 students from lower income families. And the President proposes an America's College Promise program, a federal-state partnership that would provide two years of free college with funding of $1.36 billion for fiscal year 2016.
The next step in the process is for the congressional budget committees to produce their own overall spending plan and allocate funds to the appropriations committees. The appropriators then write the legislation that selects which programs will be funded and at what amounts. Fiscal year 2016 begins on October 1.

Most of us in the Northern Mariana Islands do not pay our income taxes to the federal Internal Revenue Service because of Section 601 of the Covenant. But for those who may have dealings with the IRS, its Taxpayer Advocate Service office in Hawai'i is a useful resource. Ms. Gayvial D. James from the office checks in with us annually here in Washington. Last year, she alerted us to new identity theft scams affecting Guam and the NMI. As a result, we sent out an alert via e-kilili and were able to help several constituents who fell victim.
Supporting privacy protections for e-mails and other digital communications - Protecting the privacy of our electronic communications is a critical issue in this digital age. But currently the law allows the government to seize our personal e-mails from service providers, if the e-mails have been stored online for more than 180 days. It does not matter whether we are suspected of criminal activity, and there is no requirement for a search warrant from a judge. For this reason I signed on as an original co-sponsor of H.R. 699, amending the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 . H.R. 699 would require the government to obtain a warrant to access our electronic communications and to notify an e-mail's author of the warrant within a specified period of time. The bill does not make any changes to the Wiretap Act or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. There are 235 cosponsors of this bipartisan bill.

Northern Marianas attorneys Sean Frink, Patrick Smith, and Bruce Berline visited their congressional office this week to update me on their work in the islands. We were also able to take the three on a tour of the U.S. Capitol, where the laws they deal with daily are written.
