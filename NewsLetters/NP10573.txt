DISTRICT
Dear Friend,
Last Wednesday, I hosted
the
19 th
Third District
Day
in Washington, D.C. This legislative issues seminar featured a
day of speakers, including my colleagues in the Massachusetts
delegation, NBCs Luke Russert, the Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps General
Amos, and former Boston Police commissioner Ed
Davis.
Third District Day was open to the public, and with over 150 attendees
from the Third District, this years event was a great success. I want
to take this opportunity to thank everyone who was able to come to
Capitol Hill to listen to our speakers and engage in meaningful
discussion on important issues facing Massachusetts and our nation. This great
tradition, started almost two decades ago by Congressman Martin
Meehan, reflects the spirit of involvement running throughout the Third
District. This event is always a unique opportunity for constituents to
interact with lawmakers, public officials, media personalities, business
leaders and more, as well as gain a firsthand look at how the Capitol
works.
I would also like to thank our guest speakers who
helped make Third District Day such a success. We had representatives
from the world of politics, business, media, and elsewhere share
their perspectives on issues important to Third District residents and it
was an honor to have such a distinguished group of leaders a part of
the event. Among the topics covered were American technology and
innovation in the global economy, the need to support our servicemembers,
the role of media in politics, and the future of the modern
military.
Wednesdays event was streamed live on the internet and you
can watch video from Third District Day at:

Please be
sure to scroll down to read more information on some of the other
topics on which I have been working.
As always, I hope that
you continue to provide me with your thoughts, feedback, and opinions
on these or any other subjects via my
website
or

Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Niki
Tsongas
FAIR MILITARY ACT
Last Thursday,
Congressman Mike Turner (R-OH) and I introduced new legislation to combat
military sexual assault. The Furthering Accountability and Individual
Rights within the Military Act (FAIR Military Act) supports survivors,
eliminates a bias in the military justice system and increases
accountability among all levels of the military. Accountability begins at the
top and must extend across the military, to every rank and position.
This legislation ensures our military leaders, servicemembers, and the
military justice system, are held to the highest standard.

PRESCRIPTION DRUG TAKE-BACK DAY
I recently joined
Governor Patrick, Boston Mayor Walsh, and my colleagues in the
Massachusetts delegation to promote Prescription Drug Take-Back Day on April
26 th . This initiative is an opportunity for the public to
safely dispose of expired, unused, or unwanted prescriptions that could
otherwise end up on the streets. Community safety begins at home and I
encourage citizens to join in this effort to curb the epidemic of
addiction.

Floor, Lowell, MA.

LABS
RESEARCH ACT
Last week, I introduced the Laboratory
Authority for Breakthrough Scientific (LABS) Research Act. This
legislation would boost military research and technological innovation by
increasing flexibility and efficiency at the Department of Defense
Research Laboratories and eliminating bureaucratic impediments to hiring
and retaining qualified technical personnel without increasing spending.
If we want to lead the way in military innovation
not be forced to
react
we need to get the right people in place and keep them
there.
