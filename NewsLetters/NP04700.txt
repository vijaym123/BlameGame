Rep. Miller on Veterans Day
Harrison Township, MI &#8211; Today, U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10) released the following statement ahead of Veterans Day:
&#8220;Tuesday, Nov. 11, is Veterans Day.
On this day, every American should take a moment to reflect upon and honor the service and sacrifice of those - 658,469 of our
fellow citizens in Michigan and millions more across our nation - who have worn the uniform of our armed forces to protect the freedom we all hold dear.
&#8220;There are now no longer living any veterans of World War I, the &#8216;war to end all wars,&#8217; for whom the national holiday was first proclaimed by President Woodrow Wilson
in 1919. And the ranks of those who served in the last global conflict, WWII, are fast dwindling.
Yet the ranks of those willing put themselves in harm's way on our behalf continue to grow, as has been true since our nation's founding, as new generations
pick up the banner of liberty from those who have gone before.
&#8220;We all have a sacred duty to fulfill the promise at the heart of the holiday's founding, which is that our nation shall care for those who have stood a post and
borne the battle so that this great nation remains free. That so many continue to answer our nation's call is a reminder that the belief in the cause of freedom continues to burn bright in the hearts of all Americans. We owe to each a debt of gratitude and
a pledge to honor the promises we made to them in exchange for their sacrifice.
&#8220;Setting aside a single day each year to acknowledge that debt is but a small part of our obligation. I hope you will join me this Nov. 11 in thanking a veteran
for his or her brave service which allows us to continue to breathe free.&#8221;
