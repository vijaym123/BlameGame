 to wring his hands amid the California water crisis, I offer my take on the problem in an extended essay for Investors Business Daily. Im sure the governors anguish about global warming and over-population is sincere, but those issues have little connection to the water crisis. The bottom line is this: the crisis is the direct result of a long-term plan by radical environmentalists to cut the water supply to San Joaquin Valley communities. Read how they did it and what we can do about it in my essay here .
