Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
It was great to be home for a week, honoring our Veterans and visiting
with constituents. This week, I traveled back to D.C. to address some
of the concerns of folks in the Sixth District.
Honoring Our Veterans Service and Sacrifice
I am pleased to say that on the first legislative day back after
Veterans Day, the House passed S. 893, the Veterans' Compensation
Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2013. This bill would authorize a 1.5
percent increase for Department of Veterans Affairs disability
compensation, and survivor benefits equal to this year's Social
Security COLA. This legislation is currently awaiting President Obama's
signature in order to become law.
I enjoyed joining Chief Meurer and the great Madison Southern High
School Air Force Junior ROTC
for their Veterans Day
program!
Thank you to the Volunteers of America
program participants and
graduates, supporters, and staff for a wonderful Veterans Day service
at Phoenix Park in Lexington.
I was honored to take part in Monday's national partnership launch of
the Kentucky Department of Agriculture's Homegrown By Heroes program
.
Special thanks and congratulations to Sixth District Veterans Coalition
and Berea resident, Mike Lewis, who serves as the executive director of
the Growing Warriors Project. Mike continues to serve our nation in a
new role through training, assisting, and equipping veteran families
with the skills, tools, and supplies needed to grow high quality,
naturally grown produce.
This incredible program will now give consumers across America the
chance to show their support for our nation's veterans everyday.
Fighting for Kentucky Coal Communities
I was disappointed to learn that the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)
announced the closure or conversion to natural gas of eight coal-fired
power units in the southeast, including three in Kentucky.
According to the Kentucky Coal Association, the Paradise Fossil Plant
burnt 6.15 million tons of mostly Kentucky coal last year, indirectly
supporting many of the 13,000 Kentuckians employed in the coal
industry. The TVA acknowledges this decision will impact 200 of the 400
jobs there with layoffs or reassignments, likely reducing the local tax
base.
The TVA moved forward with this decision despite a letter from seven
Kentucky legislators, which I was proud to join, urging TVA to allow
Paradise to keep burning Kentucky coal
.
This latest action demonstrates that the assault on the way of life in
our Commonwealth's coal fields is not limited to the regulations of the
EPA, but extends across the executive branch of the federal government.
I will continue to fight these economically ruinous policies designed
to keep Kentucky from mining, burning, or exporting our nation's most
abundant natural energy resource.
Keeping the Promise
For the last four years, President Obama repeatedly promised the
American people that, "if you like your health care plan, you can keep
it."
But for Melody in Lexington, Kentucky, that's simply not true.
On Thursday, I spoke on the House floor and shared Melody's story
because the American people don't need
apologies. They don't need temporary administrative waivers. They need
permanent solutions that will protect hardworking Americans like Melody
from the coverage cancellations, loss of access to doctors and premium
spikes.
We need to replace Obamacare with patient-centered reforms that will
lower costs and expand access without growing government. I believe
that this can be accomplished through reforms that emphasize the
physician-patient relationship, and also encourage portability of
coverage.
These reforms I support include:
*	Supplementing the tax exclusion for employer sponsored health
insurance with a series of individual and family tax credits to make
health insurance premiums more affordable.
*	Authorizing interstate competition among the 1,300 private
health insurers to increase options and drive down costs.
*	Enacting sensible medical liability reform to prevent defensive
medicine.
*	Expanding association health plans to allow small businesses
and the self-employed to group together to purchase coverage on a more
affordable basis.
*	Promoting consumerism though high deductible insurance policies
and tax-free health savings accounts that reconnect the health care
consumer to the cost of health care services.

support the Keep Your Health Plan Act - a solution that allows
Americans who liked their health care plans to keep them
.
Supporting Kentucky's Bid to Bring the World Equestrian Games Back to
the Bluegrass
As Chairman of the Congressional Horse Caucus, I am pleased that
Kentucky has submitted a bid to return the FEI World Equestrian Games
to Lexington. The 2010 Games were an all-around success - for the
sport, its fans and for the hosts.
The International Equestrian Federation should have incredible
confidence in the ability of the Kentucky Horse Park to repeat as a
world-class venue. Despite a challenging economy, the support from the
community and the tremendous commitment delivered by sponsor Alltech
ensured that everything came together for equestrian's greatest event.
Hosting the games would be an honor for Lexington, bringing a
substantial economic impact to the region. The 2010 Games generated
more than $200 million in Kentucky, including more than $45 million in
wages supporting over 3,000 jobs. Lexington youth benefited from the
opportunity to meet competitors and fans from around the world.
I fully support the bid, and pledge any assistance my office can
provide. Please LIKE my Facebook post if you want to see the games
return to Kentucky in 2018
!
Please continue to let me know your thoughts and concerns about issues
facing our community, and also I hope you will forward my weekly
newsletter to your friends, family and neighbors.
You may also visit my website

home in the Sixth District and in Washington.
Thank you and have a great week!

This

I

Honoring

including

in

of

I
was

urging

This

demonstrates
that
the
assault
on

in
our
Commonwealth&#8217;s
coal
fields
is
not
limited
to
the
regulations
of
the
EPA,
but
extends
across
the
executive
branch
of
the
federal
government.
I
will
continue
to
fight
these
economically
ruinous
policies
designed
to
keep
Kentucky
from
mining,
burning,
or
exporting
our
nation&#8217;s
most
abundant
natural
energy
resource.
Keeping
the
Promise
For
the
last
four
years,
President
Obama
repeatedly
promised
the
American
people
that,
"if
you
like
your
health
care
plan,
you
can
keep
it."
But
for
Melody
in
Lexington,
Kentucky,
that's
simply
not
true.
On
Thursday,
I
spoke
on
the
House
floor
and
shared
Melody's
story
because
the
American
people
don't
need
apologies.
They
don't
need
temporary
administrative
waivers.
They
need
permanent
solutions
that
will
protect
hardworking
Americans
like
Melody
from
the
coverage
cancellations,
loss
of
access
to
doctors
and
premium
spikes.
We
need
to
replace
Obamacare
with
patient&#8211;centered
reforms
that
will
lower
costs
and
expand
access
without
growing
government.
I
believe
that
this
can
be
accomplished
through
reforms
that
emphasize
the
physician&#8211;patient
relationship,
and
also
encourage
portability
of
coverage.
These
refor ms
I
support
include: Supplementing
the
tax
exclusion
for
employer
sponsored
health
insurance
with
a
series
of
individual
and
family
tax
credits
to
make
health
insurance
premiums
more
affordable.
Authorizing
interstate
competition
among
the
1,300
private
health
insurers
to
increase
options
and
drive
down
costs.
Enacting
sensible
medical
liability
reform
to
prevent
defensive
medicine.
Expanding
association
health
plans
to
allow
small
businesses
and
the
self-employed
to
group
together
to
purchase
coverage
on
a
more
affordable
basis.
Promoting
consumerism
though
high
deductible
insurance
policies
and
tax-free
health
savings
accounts
that
reconnect
the
health
care
consumer
to
the
cost
of
health

services. Please

Supporting
Kentucky's
Bid
to
Bring
the
World

Games
Back
to
the
Bluegrass
As
Chairman
of
the
Congressional
Horse
Caucus,
I
am
pleased
that
Kentucky
has
submitted
a
bid
to
return
the
FEI
World
Equestrian
Games
to
Lexington.
The
2010
Games
were
an
all-around
success
-
for
the
sport,
its
fans
and
for
the
hosts.
The
International
Equestrian
Federation
should
have
incredible
confidence
in
the
ability
of
the
Kentucky
Horse
Park
to
repeat
as
a
world-class
venue.
Despite
a
challenging
economy,
the
support
from
the
community
and
the
tremendous
commitment
delivered
by
sponsor
Alltech
ensured
that
everything
came
together
for
equestrian&#8217;s
greatest
event.
Hosting
the
games
would
be
an
honor
for
Lexington,
bringing
a
substantial
economic
impact
to
the
region.
The
2010
Games
generated
more
than
$200
million
in
Kentucky,
including
more
than
$45
million
in
wages
supporting
over
3,000
jobs.
Lexington
youth
benefited
from
the
opportunity
to
meet
competitors
and
fans
from
around
the
world.
I
fully
support
the
bid,
and
