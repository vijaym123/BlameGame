Tammy Duckworth Subject:
help David, I know what it&rsquo;s like to face a constant barrage of negative TV ads.
When I ran against Tea Party darling Joe Walsh, outside groups spent $6 MILLION to drag my name through the mud.
But, with the help of grassroots supporters like you, we fought off the attacks and won. This year, many of the same folks who attacked me are targeting my colleague, Brad Schneider.
They&rsquo;re determined to defeat Brad and put Illinois&rsquo;s 10th district back in the hands of an out-of-touch Republican. David, we can&rsquo;t let them win.
Will you join me today and chip in $5 or more to help re-elect Brad Schneider? Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks,
Tammy
Rep. Tammy Duckworth
Illinois's 8th district
