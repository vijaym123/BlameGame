David -- here&rsquo;s the latest: Overnight:
$1.8 million of deceitful GOP attack ads hit the Chicagoland airwaves. This morning:
Boehner&rsquo;s Super PAC announced $1 million more for the Republican ad machine. And moments ago:
a third outside Super PAC vowed to spend in our race.
I won't lie. This wave of outside money hurts. We&rsquo;re facing incredibly well-funded operatives, and frankly, your support is my best hope for beating them back.
We can win this race -- and hand Boehner an agonizing defeat -- but we need every Democrat reading this to step up immediately. So David, stop what you&rsquo;re doing, chip in, and help keep the Tea Party agenda out of Illinois --
for good.
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks,
Brad
