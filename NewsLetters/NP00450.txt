Kansas Common Sense
May 26, 2015
Hello,
weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and
friends if it would interest them.
Yesterday, I returned to Washington, D.C., for a Sunday session of the
United States Senate. We continue to consider legislation regarding the
authorities of the National Security Agency. Last week after
participating in several Memorial Day ceremonies, I spent the remainder
of the week with Kansans across the state.
Breaking Ground on NBAF, Safeguarding Americans
This week marked an important milestone for our country because it
moved us one step closer to better safeguarding America and its
citizens from biological threats. On Wednesday, I was proud to join
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, Department of
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, and the Kansas Delegation to break
ground on the site of construction for the modern, world-class National
Bio and Agro-Defense Facility
(NBAF) in Manhattan
a project of immense importance to our state and
nation. NBAF will ultimately create jobs for Kansans in the fields of
engineering, science and technology. The talented young men and women
who grow up here will have more opportunities to work and live in
Kansas, which is poised to become a research epicenter.
Construction of the main laboratory for NBAF will bring the United
States into the 21st century. NBAF will address a broader and more
complete spectrum of threats beyond our current abilities and make
certain we are prepared for any kind of attack, including an attack
with biological weapons. Additionally, research conducted at NBAF will
enhance our nations capability to protect its citizens and livestock
from animal disease threats. An outbreak would have a devastating
impact on the animal and agricultural industry and would be detrimental
to our economy. Without NBAF, our country remains at risk.
As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I committed myself
to making certain NBAF remained a top priority. Final funding to
complete construction of NBAF was approved and signed into law earlier
this year
bringing the decade-long battle to fund NBAF to a close. As
this essential part of our national security apparatus moves forward,
Kansans and Americans can have confidence that we will stand ready to
combat outbreaks of dangerous diseases that threaten the nations
livestock, agriculture and public health. Thanks again to Secretary
Johnson and Secretary Vilsack for being in the Little Apple for this
historic event. No longer are people asking, Is NBAF going to be
built? The answer is now unequivocally yes.
Encouraging News on Colmery-ONeil VA Medical Center Emergency
Department
On Tuesday, I visited the Colmery-ONeil VA Medical Center and met with
Medical Center Director Rudy Klopfer to get an update on the emergency
department, which has been closed since January 2014 due to
understaffing issues. Congresswoman Lynn Jenkins joined me during the
visit, and the director introduced us to Dr. Fatima Khan, the new
emergency department chief. They shared encouraging news that
everything medically necessary to open the emergency room is
accomplished and all that remains is authorization from the central
office in Washington, D.C.
I first raised concerns
about the shuttering of
the emergency department with then-VA Secretary Eric Shinseki in August
2013. I also expressed frustration
with the Veterans Health Administration in
January 2014 once the emergency room at Colmery-ONeil was temporary
closed. In order to resolve the ongoing issues, in April 2015, Rep.
Jenkins and I asked
the VA Heartland Network Director about the support the Network is
receiving from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in Washington,
D.C. Last week, we received a response
from the VA Heartland Director dated April 27, 2015,
which stated that we anticipate the temporary pause on the Emergency
Department to be removed by the end of May. During our visit on
Tuesday, Colmery-ONeil Director Klopfer also indicated that the
emergency department should re-open at the end of this month
good
news for Topeka-area veterans.
I am hopeful there are no unnecessary delays in the paperwork and
Topeka-area veterans will once again be able to count on emergency
services at Colmery-ONeil on the first of June as promised. Thanks
again to Director Klopfer and Dr. Khan for the tour and update. Click

visit.
Federal Government Overreach Continues with Waters of the U.S. Rule
Also on Tuesday, the Environmental Protection Agency finalized a deeply
flawed regulation aimed at expanding their regulatory authority under
the Clean Water Act. The nearly 300-page regulation is a blatant
overreach by the federal government and unnecessary intrusion into the
lives of Kansans. By ambiguously redefining streams and ditches
classified as Waters of the United States (WOTUS), the administration
has given the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) broad authority to
regulate waters on private property well beyond the original intent of
the law. Under the new regulation, farmers and ranchers will be forced
to obtain permits from the EPA for activities that might impact a
stream or ditch on their property. Violations of the regulation
even
if unintentional and not harmful to the environment
could cost the
stakeholder thousands of dollars in fees.
After receiving substantial amounts of feedback expressing serious
concerns when the draft rule was released, the EPA should have gone
back to the drawing board, engaged with stakeholders, and drafted a
rule that was clear and workable. Instead, the administration conducted
an aggressive advocacy campaign aimed at convincing people the
regulation is only intended to clarify the scope of the law. It only
takes a cursory review of the language to discover this is not the
case. Rather than clarifying the scope of Clean Water Act, it has
expanded the regulatory authority and added uncertainty among
stakeholders.
In Congress, we should move quickly to block the regulation from being
further implemented. I am a sponsor of Federal Water Quality Protection
Act, legislation to shield stakeholders from the regulation and provide
clear direction to the administration on redrafting a new rule based on
the original intent of the law. It is critical that we keep up the
fight to blunt the impact of the regulation before it harms our
farmers, ranchers, small business owners and communities across
Kansas.Click here

Visiting Kansas Intelligence Fusion Center with DHS Secretary Jeh
Johnson
Following the groundbreaking for the National Bio and Agro-Defense
Facility (NBAF) in Manhattan on Wednesday, I accompanied Department of
Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Jeh Johnson on a visit to the Kansas
National Guard Joint Force Headquarters and Kansas Intelligence Fusion
Center (KIFC) in Topeka. The secretary oversees DHS coordination
efforts with fusion centers around the country and was interested in
learning more about the unique coordination and structure of the KIFC.
The KIFC coordinates with state and federal agencies as well as private
sector partners to prevent terror, biological and cyber threats in
Kansas and across the country. The secretary and I received a briefing
from the KIFC team including Major General Lee Tafanelli highlighting
the Fusion Centers innovative and resourceful analytical capabilities
to prevent and protect Kansans and all Americans from existing and
emerging threats. It was instrumental for the secretary to see the
KIFCs success supporting federal and state missions toward a common
goal of protecting our country. I am grateful to those who work in the
KIFC to provide this capability for our state and I look forward to
working with Secretary Johnson on ways to make certain other states and
entities are just as capable in the future.
Touring Hays Regional Airport
On Thursday, I stopped by the Hays Regional Airport for a tour of their
renovated facility and to receive an update on airport operations from
city officials. Recent renovations include an expanded terminal with a
new lounge, security areas, a secure hold room and restrooms, a new
roof, upgraded HVAC systems, and an upgraded look with new paint and
flooring. More upgrades are planned for the airport, including the
addition of a roller belt for baggage claim and redoing the crosswind
runway.
During my visit, we discussed several issues including SkyWest's
passenger jet service which currently offers a mid-morning and
early-evening flight from Hays to Denver. We also discussed the
important role air service plays in the community, Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) regulations and legislative issues affecting
General Aviation. As a member of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on
Aviation Operations, Safety and Security, seeing firsthand the
challenges faced by rural airports is valuable to me as the
subcommittee drafts FAA Reauthorization legislation this summer.
Thanks again to Hays Vice Mayor Shaun Musil, City Commissioner Lance
Jones, Director of Public Works I.D. Creech, Assistant Director of
Public Works John Braun, Airport Advisory Committee Members Errol
Wuertz and Mike Konz, Hays Area Chamber of Commerce Director Tammy
Wellbrock and Ellis County Coalition for Economic Development Director
Aaron White for taking part in the visit. Thank you also to Airport
Manager Nathan Marcucci for leading the informative discussion.
Speaking to the Agri-Business Council of Wichita
On Friday, I enjoyed speaking to the Agriculture Business Council of
Wichita. We discussed a number of issues related to investing in
policies that are vital to Kansas rural communities. Now, more than
ever, there exists a need for producers, agriculture leaders and
elected officials from rural states to educate legislators and folks
from urban areas about the importance of modern agriculture. One of my
top priorities in the Senate is working to preserve our special way of
life in Kansas. As Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations
Subcommittee it is important for me to remain connected to farmers and
ranchers in our state. Thanks to the Agriculture Business Council of
Wichita President Mick Rausch and Executive Director Rhonda McCurry for
the invitation to speak.
Visiting the B-29 Restoration in Wichita
On Friday afternoon, I had the opportunity to visit "Doc," a historic
Boeing B-29 Superfortress that is currently being restored to flying
condition. Doc was built in 1945 in Wichita, which is also where the
restoration is taking place. Currently, there is only one Superfortress
in flying condition known as Fifi.
The restoration is being spearheaded by Doc's Friends
a nonprofit
organization founded in 2013 by a group of Wichita aviation
enthusiasts. Doc is expected to fly in the coming months. Thanks to
Fred Berry for the invitation to see this incredible project.
Touring the Kansas National Guard Cyber Unit
I ended the day Friday at McConnell Air Force Base where I was able to
tour the Kansas National Guard Cyber Unit
home of the 177th
Information Aggressor Squadron, a uniquely capable Kansas National
Guard unit that specializes in threat emulation. The tour reinforced
my belief that cyber defense is at the forefront of our nations
security needs. Non-state and state-sponsored cyberattacks occur on a
daily basis
whether its Irans actions toward U.S. financial
institutions or a movie that upsets the North Koreans.
Last week, I met with Ash Carter, Secretary of Department of Defense,
about the importance of increasing our countrys cyber defenses. We
discussed the cyber red team at McConnell and the secretarys strategy
for cyber defense and recruitment to attract the nation's best,
brightest and most competitive talent in cyber. My tour of the Cyber
Unit on Friday reinforced my belief that Kansas plays a key role in our
cyber security efforts. I appreciate Col. Jeffry Jordan for taking the
time to show me around the National Guard Cyber Unit.

June 26. Application forms can be obtained and completed under the

Kansas
Common
Sense
May
26,
2015
Hello,
weekly
newsletter.
Please
feel
free
to
forward
it
on
to
your
family
and
friends
if
it
would
interest
them.
Yesterday,
I
returned
to
Washington,
D.C.,
for
a
Sunday
session
of
the
United
States
Senate.
We
continue
to
consider
legislation
regarding
the
authorities
of
the
National
Security
Agency.
Last
week
after
participating
in
several
Memorial
Day
ceremonies,
I
spent
the
remainder
of
the
week
with
Kansans
across
the
state.
Breaking
Ground
on
NBAF,
Safeguarding
Americans
This
week
marked
an
important
milestone
for
our
country
because
it
moved
us
one
step
closer
to
better
safeguarding
America
and
its
citizens
from
biological
threats.
On
Wednesday,
I
was
proud
to
join
Department
of
Homeland
Security
Secretary
Jeh
Johnson,
Department
of
Agriculture
Secretary
Tom
Vilsack,
and
the
Kansas
Delegation
to
break
ground
on
the
site
of
construction
for
the
modern,
world-class
National
Bio
and
Agro-Defense
Facility
(NBAF)
in
Manhattan
&#150;
a
project
of
immense
importance
to
our
state
and
nation.
NBAF
will
ultimately
create
jobs
for
Kansans
in
the
fields
of
engineering,
science
and
technology.
The
talented
young
men
and
women
who
grow
up
here
will
have
more
opportunities
to
work
and
live
in
Kansas,
which
is
poised
to
become
a
research
epicenter.
Construction
of
the
main
laboratory
for
NBAF
will
bring
the
United
States
into
the
21 st
century.
NBAF
will
address
a
broader
and
more
complete
spectrum
of
threats
beyond
our
current
abilities
and
make
certain
we
are
prepared
for
any
kind
of
attack,
including
an
attack
with
biological
weapons.
Additionally,
research
conducted
at
NBAF
will
enhance
our
nation&#146;s
capability
to
protect
its
citizens
and
livestock
from
animal
disease
threats.
An
outbreak
would
have
a
devastating
impact
on
the
animal
and
agricultural
industry
and
would
be
detrimental
to
our
economy.
Without
NBAF,
our
country
remains
at
risk.
As
a
member
of
the
Senate
Appropriations
Committee,
I
committed
myself
to
making
certain
NBAF
remained
a
top
priority.
Final
funding
to
complete
construction
of
NBAF
was
approved
and
signed
into
law
earlier
this
year
&#150;
bringing
the
decade-long
battle
to
fund
NBAF
to
a
close.
As
this
essential
part
of
our
national
security
apparatus
moves
forward,
Kansans
and
Americans
can
have
confidence
that
we
will
stand
ready
to
combat
outbreaks
of
dangerous
diseases
that
threaten
the
nation&#146;s
livestock,
agriculture
and
public
health.
Thanks
again
to
Secretary
Johnson
and
Secretary
Vilsack
for
being
in
the
Little
Apple
for
this
historic
event.
No
longer
are
people
asking,
&#147;Is
NBAF
going
to
be
built?&#148;
The
answer
is
now
unequivocally
yes.
Encouraging
News
on
Colmery-O&#146;Neil
VA
Medical
Center
Emergency
Department
On
Tuesday,
I
visited
the
Colmery-O&#146;Neil
VA
Medical
Center
and
met
with
Medical
Center
Director
Rudy
Klopfer
to
get
an
update
on
the
emergency
department,
which
has
been
closed
since
January
2014
due
to
understaffing
issues.
Congresswoman Lynn
Jenkins
joined
me
during
the
visit,
and
the
director
introduced
us
to
Dr.
Fatima
Khan,
the
new
emergency
department
chief.
They
shared
encouraging
news
that
everything
medically
necessary
to
open
the
emergency
room
is
accomplished
and
all
that
remains
is
authorization
from
the
central
office
in
Washington,
D.C.
I
first
raised
concerns
about
the
shuttering
of
the
emergency
department
with
then-VA
Secretary
Eric
Shinseki
in
August
2013.
I
also
expressed
frustration
with
the
Veterans
Health
Administration
in
January
2014
once
the
emergency
room
at
Colmery-O&#146;Neil
was
temporary
closed.
In
order
to
resolve
the
ongoing
issues,
in
April
2015,
Rep.
Jenkins
and
I
asked
the
VA
Heartland
Network
Director
about
the
support
the
Network
is
receiving
from
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
in
Washington,
D.C.
Last
week,
we
received
a
response
from
the
VA
Heartland
Director
dated
April
27,
2015,
which
stated
that
&#147;we
anticipate
the
temporary
&#145;pause&#146;
on
the
Emergency
Department
to
be
removed
by
the
end
of
May.&#148;
During
our
visit
on
Tuesday,
Colmery-O&#146;Neil
Director
Klopfer
also
indicated
that
the
emergency
department
should
re-open
at
the
end
of
this
month
&#151;
good
news
for
Topeka-area
veterans.
I
am
hopeful
there
are
no
unnecessary
delays
in
the
paperwork
and
Topeka-area
veterans
will
once
again
be
able
to
count
on
emergency
services
at
Colmery-O&#146;Neil
on
the
first
of
June
as
promised. Thanks
again
to
Director
Klopfer
and
Dr.
Khan
for
the
tour
and
update.

Federal
Government
Overreach
Continues
with
Waters
of
the
U.S.
Rule
Also
on
Tuesday,
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
finalized
a
deeply
flawed
regulation
aimed
at
expanding
their
regulatory
authority
under
the
Clean
Water
Act.
The
nearly
300-page
regulation
is
a
blatant
overreach
by
the
federal
government
and
unnecessary
intrusion
into
the
lives
of
Kansans.
By
ambiguously
redefining
streams
and
ditches
classified
as
&#147;Waters
of
the
United
States&#148;
(WOTUS),
the
administration
has
given
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(EPA)
broad
authority
to
regulate
waters
on
private
property
well
beyond
the
original
intent
of
the
law.
Under
the
new
regulation,
farmers
and
ranchers
will
be
forced
to
obtain
permits
from
the
EPA
for
activities
that
might
impact
a
stream
or
ditch
on
their
property.
Violations
of
the
regulation
&#150;
even
if
unintentional
and
not
harmful
to
the
environment
&#150;
could
cost
the
stakeholder
thousands
of
dollars
in
fees.
After
receiving
substantial
amounts
of
feedback
expressing
serious
concerns
when
the
draft
rule
was
released,
the
EPA
should
have
gone
back
to
the
drawing
board,
engaged
with
stakeholders,
and
drafted
a
rule
that
was
clear
and
workable.
Instead,
the
administration
conducted
an
aggressive
advocacy
campaign
aimed
at
convincing
people
the
regulation
is
only
intended
to
clarify
the
scope
of
the
law.
It
only
takes
a
cursory
review
of
the
language
to
discover
this
is
not
the
case.
Rather
than
clarifying
the
scope
of
Clean
Water
Act,
it
has
expanded
the
regulatory
authority
and
added
uncertainty
among
stakeholders.
In
Congress,
we
should
move
quickly
to
block
the
regulation
from
being
further
implemented.
I
am
a
sponsor
of
Federal
Water
Quality
Protection
Act ,
legislation
to
shield
stakeholders
from
the
regulation
and
provide
clear
direction
to
the
administration
on
redrafting
a
new
rule
based
on
the
original
intent
of
the
law.
It
is
critical
that
we
keep
up
the
fight
to
blunt
the
impact
of
the
regulation
before
it
harms
our
farmers,
ranchers,
small
business
owners
and
communities
across
Kansas. Click

Visiting
Kansas
Intelligence
Fusion
Center
with
DHS
Secretary
Jeh
Johnson
Following
the
groundbreaking
for
the
National
Bio
and
Agro-Defense
Facility
(NBAF)
in
Manhattan
on
Wednesday,
I
accompanied
Department
of
Homeland
Security
(DHS)
Secretary
Jeh
Johnson
on
a
visit
to
the
Kansas
National
Guard
Joint
Force
Headquarters
and
Kansas
Intelligence
Fusion
Center
(KIFC)
in
Topeka.
The
secretary
oversees
DHS
coordination
efforts
with
fusion
centers
around
the
country
and
was
interested
in
learning
more
about
the
unique
coordination
and
structure
of
the
KIFC.
The
KIFC
coordinates
with
state
and
federal
agencies
as
well
as
private
sector
partners
to
prevent
terror,
biological
and
cyber
threats
in
Kansas
and
across
the
country.
The
secretary
and
I
received
a
briefing
from
the
KIFC
team
including
Major
General
Lee
Tafanelli
highlighting
the
Fusion
Center&#146;s
innovative
and
resourceful
analytical
capabilities
to
prevent
and
protect
Kansans
and
all
Americans
from
existing
and
emerging
threats.
It
was
instrumental
for
the
secretary
to
see
the
KIFC&#146;s
success
supporting
federal
and
state
missions
toward
a
common
goal
of
protecting
our
country.
I
am
grateful
to
those
who
work
in
the
KIFC
to
provide
this
capability
for
our
state
and
I
look
forward
to
working
with
Secretary
Johnson
on
ways
to
make
certain
other
states
and
entities
are
just
as
capable
in
the
future.
Touring
Hays
Regional
Airport
On
Thursday,
I
stopped
by
the
Hays
Regional
Airport
for
a
tour
of
their
renovated
facility
and
to
receive
an
update
on
airport
operations
from
city
officials.
Recent
renovations
include
an
expanded
terminal
with
a
new
lounge,
security
areas,
a
secure
hold
room
and
restrooms,
a
new
roof,
upgraded
HVAC
systems,
and
an
upgraded
look
with
new
paint
and
flooring. More
upgrades
are
planned
for
the
airport,
including
the
addition
of
a
roller
belt
for
baggage
claim
and
redoing
the
crosswind
runway.
During
my
visit,
we
discussed
several
issues
including
SkyWest's
passenger
jet
service
which
currently
offers
a
mid-morning
and
early-evening
flight
from
Hays
to
Denver.
We
also
discussed
the
important
role
air
service
plays
in
the
community,
Federal
Aviation
Administration
(FAA)
regulations
and
legislative
issues
affecting
General
Aviation.
As
a
member
of
the
Senate
Commerce
Subcommittee
on
Aviation
Operations,
Safety
and
Security,
seeing
firsthand
the
challenges
faced
by
rural
airports
is
valuable
to
me
as
the
subcommittee
drafts
FAA
Reauthorization
legislation
this
summer.
Thanks
again
to
Hays
Vice
Mayor
Shaun
Musil,
City
Commissioner
Lance
Jones,
Director
of
Public
Works
I.D.
Creech,
Assistant
Director
of
Public
Works
John
Braun,
Airport
Advisory
Committee
Members
Errol
Wuertz
and
Mike
Konz,
Hays
Area
Chamber
of
Commerce
Director
Tammy
Wellbrock
and
Ellis
County
Coalition
for
Economic
Development
Director
Aaron
White
for
taking
part
in
the
visit.
Thank
you
also
to
Airport
Manager
Nathan
Marcucci
for
leading
the
informative
discussion.
Speaking
to
the
Agri-Business
Council
of
Wichita
On
Friday,
I
enjoyed
speaking
to
the
Agriculture
Business
Council
of
Wichita.
We
discussed
a
number
of
issues
related
to
investing
in
policies
that
are
vital
to
Kansas&#146;
rural
communities.
Now,
more
than
ever,
there
exists
a
need
for
producers,
agriculture
leaders
and
elected
officials
from
rural
states
to
educate
legislators
and
folks
from
urban
areas
about
the
importance
of
modern
agriculture.
One
of
my
top
priorities
in
the
Senate
is
working
to
preserve
our
special
way
of
life
in
Kansas.
As
Chairman
of
the
Senate
Agriculture
Appropriations
Subcommittee
it
is
important
for
me
to
remain
connected
to
farmers
and
ranchers
in
our
state.
Thanks
to
the
Agriculture
Business
Council
of
Wichita
President
Mick
Rausch
and
Executive
Director
Rhonda
McCurry
for
the
invitation
to
speak.
Visiting
the
B-29
Restoration
in
Wichita
On
Friday
afternoon,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
visit
"Doc,"
a
historic
Boeing
B-29
Superfortress
that
is
currently
being
restored
to
flying
condition.
Doc
was
built
in
1945
in
Wichita,
which
is
also
where
the
restoration
is
taking
place.
Currently,
there
is
only
one
Superfortress
in
flying
condition
known
as
&#147;Fifi.&#148;
The
restoration
is
being
spearheaded
by
Doc's
Friends
&#150;
a
nonprofit
organization
founded
in
2013
by
a
group
of
Wichita
aviation
enthusiasts.
Doc
is
expected
to
fly
in
the
coming
months.
Thanks
to
Fred
Berry
for
the
invitation
to
see
this
incredible
project.
Touring
the
Kansas
National
Guard
Cyber
Unit
I
ended
the
day
Friday
at
McConnell
Air
Force
Base
where
I
was
able
to
tour
the
Kansas
National
Guard
Cyber
Unit
&#150;
home
of
the
177 th
Information
Aggressor
Squadron,
a
uniquely
capable
Kansas
National
Guard
unit
that
specializes
in
&#147;threat
emulation.&#148;
The
tour
reinforced
my
belief
that
cyber
defense
is
at
the
forefront
of
our
nation&#146;s
security
needs. Non-state
and
state-sponsored
cyberattacks
occur
on
a
daily
basis
&#150;
whether
it&#146;s
Iran&#146;s
actions
toward
U.S.
financial
institutions
or
a
movie
that
upsets
the
North
Koreans.
Last
week,
I
met
with
Ash
Carter,
Secretary
of
Department
of
Defense,
about
the
importance
of
increasing
our
country&#146;s
cyber
defenses. We
discussed
the
cyber
red
team
at
McConnell
and
the
secretary&#146;s
strategy
for
cyber
defense
and
recruitment
to
attract
the
nation's
best,
brightest
and
most
competitive
talent
in
cyber.
My
tour
of
the
Cyber
Unit
on
Friday
reinforced
my
belief
that
Kansas
plays
a
key
role
in
our
cyber
security
efforts.
I
appreciate
Col.
Jeffry
Jordan
for
taking
the
time
to
show
me
around
the
National
Guard
Cyber
Unit.
