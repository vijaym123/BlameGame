How the Healthcare Law helped Alicia from Northglenn
"I was able to get a good plan with doctors I trust and save $4200 a year."
In November, Alicia called my office after experiencing problems with the
Connect for Health Colorado Website .
She was excited to see what options would be available under the new healthcare law, but she was frustrated with some of the technical aspects of the website and was unable to enroll in a plan. My staff helped her find a local assistance site where she was able talk one-on-one with a Healthcare Guide and get help navigating the system.
"I was able to narrow my choices down by my region and which plans included doctors I knew and wanted. Even then, there were still four or five different plans to choose from. When I factored in the federal subsidy, I couldn't believe how much I was going save. I was able to get a good plan with doctors I trust and save $4200 a year."
I'm happy Alicia was able to get covered and find something more affordable for herself. If you don't have insurance, now is good time check out your options. For more information on how to enroll through the Colorado exchange,
visit my website here .
More than 138,000 Coloradans already have insurance coverage through Connect for Health Colorado.
For Coloradans who still need health insurance, enrollment through Connect for Health is still open. To have coverage start on February 1, you must enroll in a plan by January 15.

The September Floods caused damage across 18 counties and impacted thousands of people in our state. I'm grateful FEMA, the National Flood Insurance Program and the SBA were efficient and responsive to the needs of Coloradans. As of January 2, these programs and agencies approved more than $211 million in grants, loans and insurance payments to help Colorado recover and rebuild.
Being part of the hardest hit areas, both Adams and Jefferson counties were included in FEMA's individual assistance program to help people obtain repairs, emergency supplies or temporary housing. The deadline for registering for individual assistance is now passed, but if you have questions about your registration or claim, you can call FEMA at 800-621-3362, or contact my office at (303) 274-7944 for more details.
