Dear friend,
There are more than 110,000
veterans living in New Hampshire and these brave men and women, and their
families, have made amazing sacrifices for our country. We owe it to
them to make sure we honor their sacrifices with our strong
support.
That's why this week I introduced two new pieces of
legislation to support our veterans. The first is
the
Veterans Appeals Improvement Act
a
bill that aims to reduce the current backlog of disability claims
appeals at the Department of Veterans Affairs by beefing up staff resources
to process claims. This backlog highlights serious problems at the VA
that must be addressed immediately; my plan would mandate that VA
Regional Offices each have a minimum of three designated Decision Review
Officers to process the backlog of claims. This would increase the VAs
capacity to process appeals, particularly in underserved areas like
New Hampshire.
I also introduced the
Wounded Veterans Recreation Act
with Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) which
would make all veterans with a service-connected disability eligible
for a free, lifetime pass allowing entry to National Parks and other
federal recreational lands and waters. I think the military men and
women who have fought and sacrificed to protect American land deserve the
opportunity to enjoy it.
Ive fought to support our
veterans and service members throughout my career, from working to
bring veterans clinics to underserved parts of New
Hampshir e
to introducing plans to boost
economic opportunities for our veterans , and I dont have
any plans to let up. Our men and women who have served and sacrificed
deserve the best
both while theyre serving abroad and once they
return home.
Sincerely,
Jeanne
Shaheen
