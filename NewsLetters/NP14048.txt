House Oversight Committee to Hold Georgia Field Hearing on ObamaCares
Impact on Rural
America
WASHINGTON
Today, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee,
chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., announced the witnesses that will
appear at the November 25, 2013 field hearing entitled
ObamaCare Implementation: High Costs, Few Choices for
Rural America
in Gainesville, Ga. This is the second
in a series of field hearings
on ObamaCares impact on
Americans.
This hearing will examine the
impact that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is having on families, small
business owners and doctors in rural communities and counties.
Fifty-eight percent
of the rural counties served by the
federal exchange have only one or two options for insurers, and prices
for those plans are often double the cost of plans in urban
areas.
Millions of Americans are losing their
insurance as a result of the Presidents health care law and even more
are seeing their premiums increase beyond what they can afford,
Chairman Issa
said. This hearing will give the Committee an
opportunity to hear first hand from those in rural areas who are
being hit the hardest by shrinking choices and skyrocketing costs, and the
impact that is having on the their
families.
ObamaCare used to be a political
issue for people in Northeast Georgia, but now its personal, said
Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga.,
who represents the Gainesville
area that will host the hearing. The impact of ObamaCare in our area
is serious, and this is an incredible opportunity for my colleagues
in Congress and members of the Northeast Georgia community alike to
hear first-hand what ObamaCare is doing to rural healthcare.
Weve
got our work cut out for us getting answers about all of President
Obamas broken promises, but those of us working on the Oversight and
Government Reform Committee have not forgotten about the individuals and
families who are bearing the brunt of ObamaCares
failures.
I have never supported the government
takeover of healthcare imagined by the Affordable Care Act, said
Rep. Rob Woodall, R-Ga . Large federal initiatives are often
marked by misleading reports and gross mismanagement, and
unfortunately ObamaCare is no exception.
Most important to me, though, is
how this law is affecting families at home in Georgia.
Too often,
Washington simply talks.
This hearing is focused on listening,
and as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government
Reform, I am pleased Chairman Issa shares my interest in hearing what the
residents of Georgia have to say.
I hope that a few families
have been helped by ObamaCare.
I am certain that millions have been
hurt.
I hope that both Congress and the President will listen
to what the participants in this hearing have to say, and that we will
be able to work together to quickly repeal and replace those areas of
concern.
