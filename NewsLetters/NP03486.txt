Rogers Votes to Halt Obama's Executive Amnesty Order
Applauds Passage of 2015 Homeland Security Funding
WASHINGTON, D.C.
-
U.S. Rep. Harold "Hal" Rogers (KY-05) applauded passage of the 2015 federal funding bill in the U.S. House of Representatives for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (H.R. 240), along with five immigration-related amendments to bring President Obama's executive amnesty order to a halt. As Chairman of the U.S. House Appropriations Committee, Rogers spoke on the floor of the House about the importance of this legislation to national security.
"The security of our homeland is one of our highest priorities. This bill provides $39.7 billion for that purpose
to protect our borders, defend against the threats of terrorism, and enforce our nations laws," said Rogers. "Today, we will also consider amendments to the bill that will address the Presidents recent executive action on immigration. One of these amendments would prohibit any funding, including that collected by fees, from being used to implement the order. The American people have spoken loud and clear
they want our immigration laws enforced, rather than unilaterally changed in a way that undermines the spirit of our constitution and the integrity of our laws."
The amended bill takes the following actions to curtail President Obama's unconstitutional executive amnesty plan for four million illegal immigrants:
Prevents any federal funds from being used to carry out the President's amnesty order, defunds the internal memorandums that have gutted immigration enforcement in our country, and removes the ability of illegal immigrants to receive any federal benefits;
Prohibits any funds from being used to consider new applications for deferred action;
Ensures that sex offenders and domestic violence perpetrators are prioritized for deportation;
Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Administration should stop putting the interests of unlawful immigrants ahead of legal immigrants; and
Expresses the sense of the Congress that U.S. workers should not be harmed by the President's illegal actions, a reference to the perverse $3,000 incentive created by the President's order to hire illegal immigrants.
The legislation passed the House on Wednesday, January 14 with a vote of 236 to 191 and now heads to the Senate for consideration.
