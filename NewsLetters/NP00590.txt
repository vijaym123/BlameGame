WEEK IN
REVIEW
In
observance of Memorial Day and to honor the great American heroes who made
the ultimate sacrifice to protect our freedoms, the House was not in
session this week. We owe no greater debt than to these brave men and
women in uniform who put themselves in harms way to defend liberty. I am
forever grateful for their unwavering heroism.
On Tuesday, I headed to Carroll County for
a full day of events. First up was Coffee with the Congressman
Green Forest. THANK YOU to all those who came out! We had a great crowd
and great questions. I appreciate you taking time out of your morning to
share coffee with me. If you missed it, you can
listen to part of our discussion via
KRZK . After coffee, I toured Carroll Electric, which provides
power to over 90,000 consumers in Northwest Arkansas and Southwest
Missouri ( Harrison Daily
Times story here ). My next stop was Wilson Combat, a
custom firearms builder in Berryville. I finished my day at Eureka
Springs High School, where I spoke to the students at their school
assembly.
Wednesday was Washington County day! After touring
and
of course, sampling
Kyya
Chocolate in Elm
Springs, I joined Pratt &amp; Whitney to celebrate the companys
expansion and growth in Springdale ( Dont miss the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
coverage! ). The Springdale PSD facility has added 50 new jobs
since September and has invested $6 million dollars in capital upgrades
over the last two years. I applaud Pratt &amp; Whitney and its
continued contributions to the future of this facility and our community. We
are proud to have them in the Third District. My day ended at NanoMech,
a Springdale company that is developing breakthrough
nano-innovations
in machining
and manufacturing, lubrication and energy, adaptive chemistries for
advanced textile coatings, indestructible metal surface coatings,
biomedical implant coatings and strategic military
applications.
My Thursday was spent in the River
Valley. I started off the day in Greenwood with a visit to Austin
Powders followed by a stop at Armedica Manufacturing. Afterwards, I headed
to Fort Smith, where I had the opportunity to
check out Fort
Smiths new waterpark, Parrot Island (even in the rain!). I wrapped up my
day at the Donald W. Reynolds Cancer Support House ( read about my visit via the Times
Record ).
Today, I ended this district work period back in Northwest
Arkansas, where I spoke to the Arkansas Community Action Agency
Association ( ACAAA )
annual conference in Springdale. Arkansas community action agencies are a
network of 16 community-based, nonprofit organizations that provide a
variety of opportunities for low- to moderate-income Arkansans to
increase their household stability and self-sufficiency levels. Thank you
for all you do to support our communities. Afterwards, I headed to
Southwest Junior High to celebrate eighth grader
Sojas
Wagle and his third place finish
in the National Geographic Bee finals
held in Washington on May
13th. Congratulations,
Sojas !
Next week, its back to Washington. Thank you to all who
were
apart
of
this successful district work period.
