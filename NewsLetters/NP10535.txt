Dear Friend,
I'm spending this week and next week traveling around central and
northwest Connecticut, meeting with folks and touring small businesses
to hear about their priorities and their concerns. Check out some
highlights below.
My roundtable discussion in Torrington on the Farm Bill
Last week, we had a great conversation in Torrington about how the Farm
Bill affects us right here in central and northwest Connecticut. I
heard directly from roughly 40 farmers and local leaders about what
they like-and don't like-in the new Farm Bill, so that I can be the
best advocate for them in Congress. Check out this Torrington
Register-Citizen article on our discussion.
I also explained why I voted against the Farm Bill earlier this year.
While I was encouraged by some of the compromise provisions included in
the bill, including certainty for our dairy farmers, protections for
organic farming, and reductions of some wasteful agricultural
subsidies, I could not in good faith vote for the final version. The
final version included drastic cuts for the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program (SNAP), which disproportionately harms Connecticut's
neediest families including seniors and veterans.
My office helped return over $1.8 million to 5th District taxpayers
It is an honor and a pleasure to serve folks in the 41 cities and towns
of the 5th District. I'm proud to announce that my office has helped
return over $1.8 million to constituents since I came to Congress last
year. This includes over $780,000 in Social Security benefits, $177,500
in Medicare, and over $380,000 in veterans' benefits.
Check out my Constituent Corner
webpage to read stories from folks my office has helped with Social
Security, veterans' benefits, mortgage modifications, visa
applications, and more. As always, please don't hesitate to call my
office at 860-223-8412 if you or your loved ones need any assistance.
Concerning rise of heroin use in Connecticut
I'm extremely concerned about the rise of heroin use in our state. In
2013 alone, 257 Connecticut residents died from overdosing on heroin.
Tomorrow morning, I'm hosting a community conversation with Waterbury
Mayor Neil O'Leary, Torrington Mayor Elinor Carbone, local law
enforcement, and public health professionals on this epidemic. I look
forward to discussing how the federal government can better partner
with local communities to reduce illegal drug trafficking and support
mental health services.

Facebook page

or at 860-223-8412. I look forward to hearing
from you.
