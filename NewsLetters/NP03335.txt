The
Congress shall have PowerTo establish an uniform Rule of
Naturalization
Those are the exact words the Founders composed as
they drafted the United States Constitution, giving the Congress, and
the Congress alone, the authority for drafting Americas immigration
laws.
The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act,
passed this week in the House, includes important provisions that
stop the Presidents unilateral executive actions on immigration
announced last November.
In seeking to legislate from the Oval Office,
President Obama seriously overstepped his Constitutionally-enumerated
powers.
Specifically, the bill eliminates all funds --
anywhere in the budget -- for implementation of the President's
actions.
The language covers executive orders, memos, prosecutorial
discretion, and future actions the President may make that are not authorized
by Congress.
Further, the language of the bill ensures no
federal benefits can go to those covered by the President's executive
amnesty.
In the months ahead, there will be opportunities for
this Congress to debate broader border security and immigration
measures.
But we must act now to stand against the Presidents
unconstitutional executive amnesty to preserve the roles delegated to each
branch of government by our Founders!
Bolstering Border
Security
The House-passed Department of Homeland
Security Appropriations bill is a must-pass bill that provides
additional resources to protect Americans here at home.
The
legislation provides for the largest operational force levels in the history
of the Customs and Border Protection agency and supports several
critical border security initiatives, including around-the-clock
surveillance of air, land, and sea approaches to the United States. The bill
includes significant increases - above the Presidents budget request -
for Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention programs. The bill
also includes increased funding to expand visa vetting capabilities,
and enhance our efforts to combat human trafficking, child exploitation,
cyber-crime, and drug smuggling.
No one should be mistaken
- what happened in Paris last week can happen anywhere, including
here in America.
While we work to defeat extremist terrorists
across the world, this bill provides the resources necessary to protect us
here at home.
Meanwhile, the
Washington
Post
has weighed in on the fight against extremism: The
attacks in Paris should motivate Mr. Obama to reinvigorate a war
against al-Qaeda that appears to be dangerously
stalled.

Iran Eclipses US
in Iraq
The Associated Press this week produced a
well written, investigative story that illustrates the national
security consequences when American domestic politics trumps our military's
recommendations that a residual force be kept in Iraq to protect many
of the gains fought for by U.S. and international troops during the
liberation of Iraq.

Libya: Headed Toward
Chaos
Libya is headed toward chaos as the United States and NATO allies look
the other way. Read the

Business To DC: Get Off our Backs and Out of Our
Way!
As I travel around my congressional district, one of
the constant refrains from the business community is get the
government off our backs and out of our way.
This theme is echoed by
managers of both the large and small businesses.
This week,
the House passed two bills, pieces of a larger strategy that will bring
greater jobs and more opportunity to the American people and their
families.
The
Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small
Business Burdens Act
includes the language of pro-growth measures
that represent bipartisan efforts to remove the burdensome weight of
one-size-fits-all regulation that has, sadly, become the norm for
Washington. While often well-intentioned, many of these top-down
regulations hurt small businesses and emerging businesses in critical sectors
like biotechnology. Read more
here .
The House also passed the
Regulatory Accountability Act
of
2015, designed to modernize the federal rulemaking process which, in
many instances, places unnecessary burdens on employers.
The bill:
Addresses root problems with our
regulatory system.
We know Washington imposes too many
regulations and that they cost too much
money.
Makes Washington regulate at the lowest cost possible.
The Regulatory Accountability Act
requires
bureaucrats to institute regulations based on sound data and
at the lowest
possible cost to taxpayers .
Helps families.
Reining in regulatory costs is important because
these
costs are often passed directly on to families .
For example,
regulations already on the books will increase the cost of household
products
including fluorescent lamps, microwaves, air conditioners, and
dishwashers
by up to $1,600.
