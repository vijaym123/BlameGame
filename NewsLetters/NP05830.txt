David, I&rsquo;m in this race to fight for you.
That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so disturbing my opponent, ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling, is on the air with an ad
USA Today
called &ldquo;shamefully misleading.&rdquo;
Wow. How desperate.
We must get out the facts to Illinois voters -- before Mr. Schilling&rsquo;s lies take hold. So I&rsquo;m asking for a quick favor:
please chip in to our Democratic campaign before tonight&rsquo;s FEC fundraising deadline.
Every dollar helps. http://action.cheribustos.com/All-Gifts-Matched Kindest personal regards,
