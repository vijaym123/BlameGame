Tennessee parents and teachers have given me a clear mandate: repeal
Common Core.
Common Core, commonly referred to as ObamaCore, is a set of national
standards created by the federal government in conjunction with leftist
ideologues that have been imposed on our schools and children.
President Obama bribed states into instituting these Common Core
standards by offering them hundreds of millions of dollars in stimulus
spending in exchange for their adoption.
Not surprisingly the folks who helped develop these standards like Bill
and Melinda Gates, as well as numerous publishing companies, stood to
make a significant profit off these taxpayer dollars and lobbied
fervently for their adoption.
Even the Washington Post, a paper not normally inclined to expose the
Obama Administration's inner workings, has recently reported at length
on the secret connections between the Administration and those
who stand to benefit from the implementation of Common Core. What is
frightening is the deliberate methods they have used in an attempt to
allow those who voted in favor of Common Core to disguise that it is
still a federally mandated wolf hidden in the sheep's clothing of
"state standards."
Unfortunately, members of the Tennessee General Assembly took the bait
and voted to bring Common Core to Tennessee.
Under Common Core, Tennessee teachers, administrators and parents are
divested of their voices in the education process and forced to comply
with a one-size-fits-all approach to our children's education. It is no
surprise that Common Core standards are described as "watered down" and
"uncompetitive."
To fight this serious blow to our state's education system, I
cosponsored H.R. 4008, the Educational Freedom Act of 2014. This
legislation would prevent the federal government from providing
financial support in exchange for states adopting Common Core
standards. In other words, this legislation stops the federal
government from bribing states into instituting Common Core like they
did here in Tennessee.
While only the General Assembly and Governor Haslam can truly get rid
of Common Core in Tennessee, by preventing other states from adopting
Common Core, my hope is the entire program will crumble.
We must give our educators and parents the flexibility they need to
develop curriculums that are tailored to meet the demands of our
children here in Tennessee. Therefore it is critical we repeal Common
Core and I will continue to lead the fight to do just that.
Representative Scott DesJarlais, M.D.

Tennessee
parents
and
teachers
have
given
me
a
clear
mandate:
repeal
Common
Core.
Common
Core,
commonly
referred
to
as
ObamaCore,
is
a
set
of
national
standards
created
by
the
federal
government
in
conjunction
with
leftist
ideologues
that
have
been
imposed
on
our
schools
and
children.
President
Obama
bribed
states
into
instituting
these
Common
Core
standards
by
offering
them
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
in
stimulus
spending
in
exchange
for
their
adoption.
Not
surprisingly
the
folks
who
helped
develop
these
standards
like
Bill
and
Melinda
Gates,
as
well
as
numerous
publishing
companies,
stood
to
make
a
significant
profit
off
these
taxpayer
dollars
and
lobbied
fervently
for
their
adoption.
Even
the
Washington
Post,
a
paper
not
normally
inclined
to
expose
the
Obama
Administration&#8217;s
inner
workings,
has
recently
reported
at
length
on
the
secret
connections
between
the
Administration
and
those
who
stand
to
benefit
from
the
implementation
of
Common
Core. What
is
frightening
is
the
deliberate
methods
they
have
used
in
an
attempt
to
allow
those
who
voted
in
favor
of
Common
Core
to
disguise
that
it
is
still
a
federally
mandated
wolf
hidden
in
the
sheep's
clothing
of
"state
standards."
Unfortunately,
members
of
the
Tennessee
General
Assembly
took
the
bait
and
voted
to
bring
Common
Core
to
Tennessee.
Under
Common
Core,
Tennessee
teachers,
administrators
and
parents
are
divested
of
their
voices
in
the
education
process
and
forced
to
comply
with
a
one-size-fits-all
approach
to
our
children&#8217;s
education.
It
is
no
surprise
that
Common
Core
standards
are
described
as
&#8220;watered
down&#8221;
and
&#8220;uncompetitive.&#8221;
To
fight
this
serious
blow
to
our
state&#8217;s
education
system,
I
cosponsored
H.R.
4008,
the
Educational
Freedom

of
2014.
This
legislation
would
prevent
the
federal
government
from
providing
financial
support
in
exchange
for
states

Common
Core
standards.
In
other
words,
this
legislation
stops
the
federal
government
from
bribing
states
into
instituting
Common
Core
like
they
did
here
in
Tennessee.
While
only
the
General

and
Governor
Haslam
can
truly
get
rid
of
Common
Core
in
Tennessee,
by
preventing
other
states
from
adopting
Common

my
hope
is
the
entire
program
will

We
must

our

the
flexibility
they

curriculums
that
are
tailored
to
meet
the
demands
of
our

here
in
Tennessee.
Therefore
it
is
critical
we
repeal
Common

and
I
will
continue
to
lead
the
fight
to
do
just
that.
