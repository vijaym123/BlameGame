Empowering Patients First
Act
Saves $2.34 Trillion
An
independent review
conducted by former
Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin has estimated that H.R.
2300, the
Empowering Patients First Act
our patient-centered
health care reform proposal
would, if enacted, save an estimated
$2.34 trillion over the next ten years while reducing health care
premium increases. This analysis confirms that the
Empowering Patients
First Act
would have a tremendously positive impact on our
nations health care system. It is a testament to the reform proposals
validity and seriousness, and it confirms that patient-centered solutions
can yield savings, reduce costs, and increase
access.
In announcing this analysis last week, I penned
an op-ed for
National Review
laying
out the reasons why a patient-centered approach to health care reform is
not only a way to lower costs but also a way to increase access to
quality health care choices:
Any efforts to improve health care should
not stop simply with reducing costs. The Empowering Patients First Act
enhances quality of care by refocusing our attention on the needs of
patients and their doctors. We can best accomplish this by removing
governmental barriers to personalized health
care.
Today, nearly
half of all Americans rely on their employers for health insurance. If
they change or lose their jobs, access to the insurance coverage they
have
and may very well like
can be lost. That could mean losing the
ability to see preferred doctors and being forced to find new ones who
may be unfamiliar with an ongoing treatment. This is particularly
problematic given that the average American worker will have between ten
and twelve different employers in her lifetime. She shouldnt have to
have ten to twelve different health plans.
Our bill would allow
individuals to keep their policies, even if they lose or change jobs,
to cultivate a continuity of care. Americans would be able to keep
their doctors, regardless of whos paying. Medicine works best for
Americans when real trust is developed between patients and their physicians.
Insurance portability is critical to maintaining this vital
relationship.

op-ed in its entirety by
