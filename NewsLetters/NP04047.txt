Supporting Individuals with
Disabilities
This past week, the House
overwhelmingly
passed the Achieving a Better Life Experience
(ABLE) Act by a vote of 404-17.
As one of the original
co-sponsors of this bill, I am extremely pleased and proud that this legislation
will continue to move forward in Congress.
The ABLE Act
would ease the financial burden for individuals with disabilities and
empower them by creating tax-free accounts that can be used to plan for
the future and save for expenses like education, job training,
retirement, living expenses, and health care. These accounts can be created
by individuals or their families.
People
with disabilities have the same hopes and dreams as everyone
else.
They want to be independent and achieve their full potential,
whether its pursuing an education or finding a good job. We already have
401k accounts that help us save for our retirement, health savings
accounts, and 529 accounts to save for our childrens college education.
Why shouldnt we give millions of Americans with disabilities similar
opportunities?
We should show compassion towards individuals
struggling with disabilities and the families who care for them. I am
proud to be a voice for others who often arent able to speak for
themselves.
Helping Student
Veterans
Earlier this week I introduced legislation,
along with Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV), to
help veterans
get the education they need to thrive in the modern workforce .
The
G.I. Bill STEM Extension Act (HR 5784)
will
give students utilizing GI Bill benefits more flexibility to pursue
degrees in science, technology, engineering, math and other STEM
fields.
The transition from war zone to campus is not always an easy
one. We owe it to men and women who served to do all we can to help
them return to civilian life and pursue their dreams. The impetus for
the bill came from
meetings I had with student
veterans at colleges and universities in West Virginia
who discussed the
difficulty they have in completing certain degrees in the 36 months
allotted by the GI Bill.
This proposal gives
students who utilize the Post-9/11 GI Bill the ability to apply for an
additional nine months of extra benefits if they pursue a degree in one of
the STEM fields.
This common sense plan
will give those who have sacrificed for our freedom the tools to be
successful in the 21 st
Century economy . This will not only
benefit veterans, but will make Americas economy more competitive as
well.
Fighting Back Against
Executive Overreach on Immigration
The House
took action this week to stop President Obamas plan to give amnesty to
five million illegal immigrants.
The Preventing
Executive Overreach on Immigration Act , of which I am a co-sponsor,
reaffirms the President does not have the Constitutional authority to
take this action and circumvent the law.
Time and again
President Obama has acted on his own to go around Congress and change
policy as he sees fit. His recent announcement that we will provide amnesty
for millions of people in this country illegally is just the latest
example.
The
Constitution is clear
laws should be changed through the legislative
process , not with the stroke of the Presidents pen.
We are a
nation of laws. Rather than dividing the American people for political
gain, President Obama should work with Congress in good faith to
secure the border and fix our broken immigration
system.
Monongalia County
Shooting
Like all West Virginians, I am shocked and saddened by the
horrific violence that occurred this week in Monongalia County. Our prayers
are with the families of the victims of this senseless shooting. Now is
a time for healing
as their families hold services
for the victims
of this horrific
act.
National Miners Day
Saturday,
December 6 th
is National Miners Day. On this day, we show our
appreciation for our nations coal miners.
Please take a moment
to think about the men and women who work each and every day to provide
affordable, reliable energy to power Americas homes and
businesses.
These men and women and their families are the true backbone of
West Virginia.
My staff and I each year, take the
moment to pause and thank our coal miners for keeping the lights
on.
Were grateful for the men and women who work hard
each and every day to provide affordable, reliable coal-based power
to Americas homes and
businesses.
