Dear Fellow Nevadan,
As
higher education becomes more expensive, students are forced to take out
more loan debt. In fact, 44 million Americans now have student loan
debt, and the average debt per student is at an all-time high - nearly
$29,000. There is more student loan debt than credit card
debt.
When I was in college, I worked to help pay for my education.
Today, a student at University of Nevada-Reno or College of Southern
Nevada could barely pay a fraction of their tuition with a full-time job.
To help address this issue, last week the Senate voted on the Bank on
Students Emergency Loan Refinance Act. The bill would provide
graduates, many with very high interest rates on their student loans, a
two-year period to refinance to today's low rates - just as millions of
Americans have done with their home mortgages. This legislation would
allow more than 25 million Americans, and over 150,000 student loan
borrowers in Nevada to save thousands in interest fees by refinancing at
current rates.
I have talked with students from across our
state, who have shared stories of the burden of student debt and would
welcome the chance to refinance their student loans. Unfortunately,
Senate Republicans obstructed this legislation from passing. While this
was a disappointing setback, I will continue to work to pass this
urgently-needed bill and am committed to bringing this legislation to the
Senate again this year.
Thank you for taking the time to read
this email. To learn more about my work in the Senate on behalf of
