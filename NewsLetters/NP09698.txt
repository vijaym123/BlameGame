Friends,
It's a busy
time in Washington, as we're in the middle of appropriations season and
working hard to get our nation's budget in order, but I'm grateful
for every opportunity I have to come home to the 14th District. Its a
place where common sense actually rules.
Since the snow
has melted and changed to rain (yes, that is Northeast Ohio spring
weather), Im grateful that I've had the chance to meet lots of hardworking
Ohioans. Ive been able to see our local industries in action and
even teach a class or two.
I've added photos to my website
from a few of my recent visits around the district. You can view the
gallery here:

I remain humbled by the opportunity to serve
you.
Sincerely,
Dave
