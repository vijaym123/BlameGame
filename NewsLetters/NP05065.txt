URGENT: CONTROL OF CONGRESS IS AT STAKE Tomorrow's ad buy deadline may be our last chance to rescue Democrats drowning in Koch-funded attacks. Can you chip in $5 or more?
We just don&rsquo;t know what else to do:
-- The latest polls show the race for Congress is DEADLOCKED.
-- But Republicans are planning to massively outspend us this week. The math is daunting:
if we can&rsquo;t fight off all these Republican attacks, our chances of winning will drop to ZERO. That might sound grim, but it&rsquo;s the truth.
Tomorrow night&rsquo;s ad buy deadline is our last chance to turn things around.
David, we&rsquo;re urging you -- please don&rsquo;t wait until tomorrow. We need you to chip in today.
