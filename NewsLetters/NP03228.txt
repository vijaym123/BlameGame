Thune: Presidents State of the Union
Address Called for Same Stale Policies
VIDEO : Senator
Thune reacts to President Obama's sixth State of the Union
address.
Senator John Thune (R-S.D.) offered his reaction to President
Obamas sixth State of the Union address last night calling the
presidents agenda another top-down approach of the past that taxes too much,
spends too much, and regulates too much. It is yet another expansion of
Washingtons already-overextended
bureaucracy.
Senator Thune contrasted the presidents stale
policies of the last six years with Republicans reform agenda to
fight for the middle class by turning Congress focus back to Americans
top priorities, which are economic growth and job creation. Senator
Thune called on the president to work with the Republican majority to
approve the Keystone XL pipeline, rein in burdensome regulations, enact
trade agreements, and act on bipartisan jobs bills that passed the House
last Congress but were stuck in the
Senate.
