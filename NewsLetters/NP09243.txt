Memorial Day Events in
Kansas City and Spring Hill
Monday we celebrated
Memorial Day, a day to remember those who have made the ultimate
sacrifice so we can enjoy our freedom. It was truly an honor to attend
several events to thank and celebrate the courageous men and women who
served our country.
It was an honor
to attend the Memorial Day Ceremony at the Vietnam Memorial Fountain
in Kansas City.
I was also grateful to speak at the Spring Hill
Memorial Day Celebration on Monday.
Holding the Department of Veterans Affairs
Accountable
On this week of Memorial Day, the news surrounding the
Department of Veterans Affairs delay of care scandal continues to alarm. The
VA cannot fail those who were called upon to protect our nation. These
men and women served our country, yet are forced to wait for their
hard-earned benefits because the administration refuses to take
responsibility and action once
again.
Last week, I spoke on the House floor and demanded the
administration take the necessary actions to fix this serious problem, as it is
preventable with proper management and accountability. The backlog of
veterans cases has grown out of control, delaying urgent medical
treatment and leaving our loved ones to watch their health deteriorate. In
addition to the backlog in cases, allegations that dozens of veterans
have died while on secret waiting lists has also surfaced. Our veterans
deserve better.
I am pleased
to support H.R. 4031, the Department of Veterans Affairs Management
Accountability Act, which gives Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric
Shinseki the authority to terminate the employment of incompetent senior
leaders at the VA, a necessary first step to end the culture of
complacency plaguing the VA health care system. The bill passed the Hosue 390-33
on May 21.

House Passes Bipartisan and Earmark Free Water
Bill
The Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA), passed
the House with a bipartisan vote of 412-4 last week. WRRDA is key to a
sound infrastructure network and will create needed construction
jobs. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I was pleased to vote
for a bill that contained zero earmarks and cut $18 billion of
unnecessary spending on inactive projects. The bill includes reforms to
increase accountability and Congressional oversight in order to reduce
fraud, waste, and abuse.
The bipartisan Water
Resources Reform &amp; Development Act (WRRDA), which creates jobs and
rebuilds our nations water infrastructure, passed the House with a vote of
412-4.
Chief
Judge of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of
Kansas
It was a pleasure meeting with Judge Nugent, Chief Judge
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Kansas. We spoke about
the federal caseload of the Court, as well as our nations economic
outlook. Thank you for taking the time to visit with me during your
time in Washington.
It was great
meeting with Judge
Nugent.
Funding for Air Traffic Control
Facilities
Kansans from the Air Traffic
Controllers Association stopped by my Washington, D.C. office last week to
discuss the upcoming transportation bill. We spoke about the instability
in funding and how it affects air traffic control facilities
throughout Kansas. Properly staffing air traffic towers to ensure flight safety
in Kansas and throughout the nation cannot be ignored.
It was
great meeting with Aaron Merrick and
Connie Presley of the Air Traffic Controllers
Association.
Kansas Rural Letter Carriers
I also had the
opportunity to meet with representatives from the Kansas Rural Letter
Carriers. We discussed the importance of six-day mail and the unique
challenges they face while delivering your mail on time. As the
Representative from the 3rd District of Kansas, I represent a rural,
suburban, and urban district. Being able to meet the varying mail delivery
needs of the entire district
is important to
me.
It was a pleasure meeting with
representatives from the Kansas Rural Letter Carriers in Washington last
week.
