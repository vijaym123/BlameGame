Dear Friend,
I wanted to remind you that I am hosting a free Tax Fraud Prevention Workshop to help you recognize and protect yourself from some of the most common tax scams: identify theft, phishing and return preparer fraud.
Please join me TOMORROW, Saturday, February 8th, 2014, from 9:00 AM &ndash; 11:00 AM at the Santa Ana Public Library, 26 Civic Center Dr., Santa Ana, CA 92701.
If you suspect that someone has stolen your identity, knowing your resources and acting quickly can help limit the damage.
My workshop will feature key information from the Federal Trade Commission and Internal Revenue Service about important steps to take in the event of identity theft or tax fraud.
To RSVP for this workshop or for more information, please contact my District Office at 714-621-0102 or CA46RSVP@mail.house.gov
Very Truly Yours,
Loretta Sanchez
Member of Congress
