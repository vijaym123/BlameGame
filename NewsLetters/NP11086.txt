Firmly Against Amnesty
Lately, there has
been a strong push to reform our nations immigration system. Many of
the proposals amount to nothing more than amnesty. Rather than award
those who broke the law, I believe we need to start enforcing the laws
already in the books.
There are approximately 12 million
with some estimates reaching as high as 30 million
illegal immigrants
in our country. Our first line of defense is controlling our
porous borders.
Protecting our borders is important for combating
illegal immigration, as well as defending against organized crime,
terrorism, drug trafficking, and other forms of criminal activity. It
has always been my position to secure our borders by constructing a
physical fence and increasing the number of border patrol agents while
aggressively pursuing those who continue to defy our
laws.
Once an illegal immigrant enters our country, it can be difficult to
prevent them from obtaining employment, access to healthcare and
education, and other services that should only be provided to citizens and
legal immigrants. All of this comes at a great expense to
taxpayers and those looking for employment legally.
Now more than ever, our financial resources are limited. I support
efforts to seriously reign in federal spending and get our debt and
deficit under control. However, combating illegal immigration by securing
our borders, locating individuals that are here illegally, and removing
them from our country must remain a priority. Equally as important,
Congress should not, under any circumstance, grant amnesty to those who
are here illegally or provide them with any clear path to citizenship.
Rather than support proposals that compromise the
Rule of Law our nation was built on, I will continue to be a strong
voice protecting and defending the Constitution.
Sincerely,
Sam Graves
