Dear Friend,
As we approach Tax Day, its
important that you are aware of scams as
they typically increase around this time of
year. The Internal Revenue
Service(IRS) recently issued a
warning list of the top scams that
taxpayers should look out for during this
years filing season, and I want to
tell you about them.
Telephone scams may be the most
pervasive of them all. Fake IRS agents have
targeted more than 350,000 people with
phone calls demanding payments and
threatening jail in the largest scam of its
kind in the history of the IRS. Victims are
in every state, and according to the
Treasury deputy inspector general for tax
administration, they collectively were
conned out of of a total of more than $15
million.
In addition to phone
scams, taxpayers must be aware of phishing,
or an attempt to steal personal information
over the Internet
.
The IRS will not send you an email
about a bill or a refund out of the blue,
so be wary about clicking on anything you
receive that appears suspicious. You must
also be cautious of identity theft. If the
IRS suspects identity theft, it will send
you a letter to stop the suspicious return.
If you receive this request from the IRS to
verify your identity, visit the Identity
Verification Service website,
idverify.irs.gov, which is the fastest,
easiest way to do so. The website will ask
a series of questions that only the real
taxpayer can answer. Once the identity is
verified, you can confirm whether or not
you filed the return. Lastly, you should
ask questions about groups that claim to be
charitable organizations to attract
donations from unsuspecting contributors,
and you must be on the lookout for anyone
promising inflated refunds.
There are five tips that the IRS claims
will help you determine whether or not you
are being targeted by a scammer. First, the
IRS will never call to demand payment or
call about taxes owed without first having
mailed you a bill. They will not demand
that you pay taxes without giving you the
opportunity to question or appeal the
amount they claim you owe. Third, they will
not require you to use a specific payment
method for your taxes, such as a prepaid
debit card. They also wont ask for
credit or debit card numbers over the
phone. Lastly, the IRS will never threaten
to bring in local police or other
law-enforcement groups.
