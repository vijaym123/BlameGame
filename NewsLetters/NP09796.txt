Dear Friend,
We are in the midst of a
national scandal that should serve as a wakeup call to every American.
Forty veterans have reportedly died due to delayed care while they
were on a secret waiting list at a VA hospital in Phoenix, Arizona. It
has since come to light that VA officials in Fort Collins, Colorado and
San Antonio, Texas may have also falsified documents and created
secret waiting lists to hide how long patients have been waiting for
care.
Our nations veterans deserve the very best, and they
are simply not getting it from the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Thats why I was among the first to call for the resignation of VA
Secretary Eric Shineski.
While I respect Mr. Shinekis service to
our country as an Army general, our veterans deserve answers and
accountability. Under Mr. Shineskis leadership, the VA has not adequately
addressed the problems and lack of accountability plaguing the VA
health system.
The American Legion has also called for Mr.
Shineskis resignation, citing a pattern of scandals that has
infected the entire system. His resignation would be a start to changing
the culture of the VA to one that treats veterans with the honor,
dignity, and respect that they have earned in their service to our
nation.
I recently met with a group of Bozeman-area veterans who
raised concerns about persistent delays in receiving care from the VA
system. If you, or anyone you know, are encountering similar issues,
please do not delay in contacting my office so my staff can
help.
I will continue to fight for reforms to address longstanding delays
in addressing veterans benefits claims and to ensure that the VA
more efficiently and effectively meets Montana veterans
needs.
Id appreciate it if you could share your thoughts with me on the
question below.
In
light of the recent scandal in the Department of Veterans Affairs,
should VA Secretary Eric Shineski resign? Yes, his resignation would set things right in the
VA. Yes, but more action
is needed to fix the VA's problems. No, he should stay and fix the problems
himself. I'm not
sure. *By
