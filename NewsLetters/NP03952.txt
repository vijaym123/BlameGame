Congressman Lamborn Offers Amendment to Defund
Amnesty
12/10/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn joined many of his conservative
colleagues in offering an amendment to the so-called "cromnibus"
funding legislation. The amendment reads, in part, "None of the funds
appropriated or otherwise made available, including any funds or fees
collected or otherwise made available for expenditure, by this division or
any other Act, or otherwise available to the Secretary of Homeland
Security, for any fiscal year may be used to implement, administer,
carry out, or enforce the [amnesty]
policies."
"This amendment will prohibit federal funds from being used
to carry out the President's unlawful executive amnesty plan. The
President is charged with faithfully executing laws, not unilaterally
creating new policies. This is one more step I am taking to uphold my
oath to protect and defend our
Constitution."
