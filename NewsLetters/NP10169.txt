One Nation Under God
Dear Friends,
Yesterday my office joined
Tennesseans at rallies and vigils across the
6th district to commemorate the 63rd annual National Day of Prayer.
Together, we partnered with members of the community to pray for our
state and our country and to ask God's continued blessings on our
nation.
First recognized in 1952 by a joint resolution of Congress and signed
by President Harry Truman, the National Day of Prayer marks an
important opportunity for families to set politics aside and reflect on
the role of prayer and faith in our country's history. It is a day that
celebrates our first freedoms granted in the Constitution-including the
right to worship freely. At its heart, the National Day of Prayer is
our country at its best and is a day that belongs to every American.
As a Christian and a member of the Congressional Prayer Caucus, this
occasion has always held special meaning for me. That is why I recently
joined a bipartisan group of my House colleagues to support a
resolution
recognizing May 1, 2014
as the 63rd annual National Day of Prayer and expressing our firm
belief that Congress and the President must continue to set apart this
day each year.
Like many across our district, I believe in the power of prayer and
know that now, more than ever, we are a nation in urgent need of
prayer; prayers for wisdom and discernment for our elected leaders,
prayers for our men and women in uniform who serve in harm's way, and
prayers that-even in a time of political correctness run amok-our
time-honored rights of conscience and free exercise of religion will
always be protected and upheld.
This week it is fitting for us to remember the wise words of President
Ronald Reagan when he said, "If we ever forget that are one nation
under God, then we will be a nation gone under." May we all do our part
to ensure that our tradition of respect for faith, prayer, and
religious liberty is carried on in our time.
Sincerely,
Diane Black
Member of Congress

One
Nation
Under
God
Dear
Friends,
Yesterday
my
office
joined
Tennesseans
at
rallies
and
vigils
across
the
6th
district
to
commemorate
the
63rd
annual
National
Day
of
Prayer.
Together,
we
partnered
with
members
of
the
community
to
pray
for
our
state
and
our
country
and
to
ask
God&#8217;s
continued
blessings
on
our
nation.
First
recognized
in
1952
by
a
joint
resolution
of
Congress
and
signed
by
President
Harry
Truman,
the
National
Day
of
Prayer
marks
an
important
opportunity
for
families
to
set
politics
aside
and
reflect
on
the
role
of
prayer
and
faith
in
our
country&#8217;s
history.
It
is
a
day
that
celebrates
our
first
freedoms
granted
in
the
Constitution&#8212;including
the
right
to
worship
freely.
At
its
heart,
the
National
Day
of
Prayer
is
our
country
at
its
best
and
is
a
day
that
belongs
to
every
American.
As
a
Christian
and
a
member
of
the
Congressional
Prayer
Caucus,
this
occasion
has
always
held
special
meaning
for
me.
That
is
why
I
recently
joined
a
bipartisan
group
of
my
House
colleagues
to
support
a
resolution
recognizing
May
1,
2014
as
the
63rd
annual
National
Day
of
Prayer
and
expressing
our
firm
belief
that
Congress
and
the
President
must
continue
to
set
apart
this
day
each
year.
Like
many
across
our
district,
I
believe
in
the
power
of
prayer
and
know
that
now,
more
than
ever,
we
are
a
nation
in
urgent
need
of
prayer;
prayers
for
wisdom
and
discernment
for
our
elected
leaders,
prayers
for
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
who
serve
in
harm&#8217;s
way,
and
prayers
that&#8212;even
in
a
time
of
political
correctness
run
amok&#8212;our
time-honored
rights
of
conscience
and
free
exercise
of
religion
will
always
be
protected
and
upheld.
This
week
it
is
fitting
for
us
to
remember
the
wise
words
of
President
Ronald
Reagan
when
he
said,
&#8220;If
we
ever
forget
that
are
one
nation
under
God,
then
we
will
be
a
nation
gone
under.&#8221;
May
we
all
do
our
part
to
ensure
that
our
tradition
of
respect
for
faith,
prayer,
and
religious
liberty
is
carried
on
in
our
time.
