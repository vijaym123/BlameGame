VISITING DC
November 21, 2014
This week the Senate finally took a vote on
the Keystone XL Pipeline after years of stalling. Unfortunately, the
legislation did not pass. As an original cosponsor of the bill and
supporter of its authorization, it's inexplicable that Senate Democrats and
the President continue to block legislation supported by this
Administration's own State Department and a strong majority of
Americans.
We know that you, along with
Americans all across our nation, want real leadership and a genuine
opportunity to build a healthy economy again. The Keystone Pipeline --
beyond creating thousands of shovel-ready jobs - would invest billions
of dollars into our economy and would also improve our energy
security at a time of unrest abroad. I look forward to January and the
opportunity for the Senate to bring this up again.
Last evening, the President addressed the nation
about his intention to pursue amnesty for illegal immigrants through
executive action. This decision, counter to his own statements over the
last few years, represents the very height of Presidential arrogance
and signifies a dangerous shift from a nation of laws to a nation of
men. In order to achieve some sort of gain for his political party, the
President risks damage to the rule of law in our nation, but he also
threatens a more immediate impact on those here legally, those
following the legal process to gain entry into our country, and others
struggling to find work in a fragile economy. Our border states will also be
further stressed as they deal with another, almost certain surge of
additional illegal immigrants looking for similar treatment from this
White House.
The new
Senate majority, working with our colleagues in the expanded House
majority, will be considering all appropriate responses in the coming weeks
--
including legislative and legal means.
On Monday, Senators McCain, Blumenthal, Blunt,
Murkowski, Manchin, and I introduced a new bill to address suicide and
mental health care among our veterans. When our veterans come back
from serving, they are under a lot of mental strain -- processing their
time in service and adjusting back into civilian life can take a major
toll on even the strongest of our uniformed men and women.
For
years, my colleagues and I have been pursuing solutions to effectively
reach our veterans who need help before they turn to substance abuse
or, even more concerning, choose to end their
lives.
The Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention
for American Veterans Act offers several critical measures that would
improve mental health care and suicide prevention resources for American
service members. This legislation would force the Department of
Veterans Affairs to face their deficiencies and pursue solutions with
non-governmental organizations to provide the helping hand that so many of
veterans desperately need.
With this legislation, our nations
veterans will now have a website to find information on the mental
health services available and ensure that National Guard members are not
lost while transitioning back to their civilian life. Our nation has
made a promise to the men and women who serve to protect our freedoms, we
cannot let them down. You can read more about this legislation
here .
Following the introduction of our mental health legislation, the Senate
Committee on Veterans Affairs held a hearing on Mental Health and
Suicide Among Veterans. The committee heard from VA leadership in charge
of mental health services, representatives from outside groups who
provide support to our veterans, and from Susan Selke and Valerie
Pallotta, mothers who lost their sons to battles with depression and PTSD.
The Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act is named
after Susan Selkes son.

On Monday, the Senate passed the
Child Care Development Block Grant 88-1. The President signed it into
law on Wednesday. After years of hard work with Senator Mikulski, I am
pleased that the Senate passed this bipartisan, commonsense piece of
legislation that will foster the development of children across this
nation. CCDBG is a welfare reform success story -- supporting the safety
and education of our children while empowering parents to take
control of their own future. This legislation promotes transparency so
parents can be well-informed consumers of child care while ensuring federal
dollars will no longer go to child care providers who have been
convicted of violent crimes. I am proud to have played a part in this major
achievement in helping children and their hardworking
families.
Finally, on Thursday, the
Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions held a hearing
on the nomination of Lauren McFerran to serve as a member of the
National Labor Relations Board. I want to draw your attention to the
exchange Ms. McFerran and I had on joint employers and franchising. You can

Sincerely,
