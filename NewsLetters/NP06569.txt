Dear Friends,
After a
long, hot summer, the last thing many people want to think about is a
tropical disaster headed their way. No, Im not talking about a last
minute visit by your in-laws either. September is National Preparedness
Month and South Florida is in the middle of hurricane season. While it
has become clich to say the best time to prepare for a disaster is
before it happens, it is also the truth. Every family should have a
disaster preparedness plan, and not just for unexpected
drop-ins.
A great place to begin planning is
http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/prepare/ready.php . The National Hurricane Center (NHC)
maps out, no pun intended, every element of an effective disaster plan
for you and your family. From emergency contacts to the supplies
needed and effective day after contingency, the NHC website is one of
the most comprehensive and free tools available to you to ensure that
youre ready when disaster strikes. While compiling your plan, think
about you and your familys transportation needs, whether you live in an
evacuation zone, and where you could seek shelter
either
government-sponsored or with friends or family
so there are no questions about
what to do.
Some of the supplies you buy for a hurricane
can also be useful during heavy rains and power outages which sometimes
plague our community. Preparedness is about every disaster, no matter
the size or designation. South Floridians know that hurricanes
or
any disaster big or small
can strike at any time. Its the perfect
time to make sure were all prepared so that when we get news of
hurricanes, flooding, or any other disaster, were ready to take
action.
Sincerely,
Ileana
