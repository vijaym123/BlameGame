Dear
Friends,
This week, President Obama complied with his legal duty to submit a
budget to Congress.
But his $4 trillion blueprint for fiscal
year 2016 falls recklessly short of our governments obligation to live
within its means and begin paying off the $18 trillion
debt.
The president proposed an audacious tax, spend and borrow scheme
that would balloon our debt to $26 trillion by 2025. We were $10.6
trillion in the hole when he took office.
Rather than offering
tax reform to level the playing field and boost the economy, the
president wants to raise taxes by $2.1 trillion over a decade.
He
wants to increase spending by $2.4 trillion, a 7 percent increase next
year and a 65 percent jump in 10 years.
This abdication of
responsibility is at the heart of why so many Americans have all but
given up on Washington.
Even the presidents allies are
skeptical. The left-leaning Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the
Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, debunks Obamas claim that his
budget will help the middle class.
The proposal would
have very little net impact on middle-income households, says the Tax
Policy Center. The middle 20 percent of households
making between
$49,000 and $84,000
would see their annual after-tax incomes drop by an
average of $7, according to the center.
The president has
boasted of providing a little bit of a cushion for working families.
More like a Whoopie cushion, now available at Target for
$3.
Idahoans sent me to Congress to end unsustainable government growth.
In the new Congress, Ill be joining my colleagues in making the hard
choices necessary to get us back on track.
Only by
restraining government, bringing fairness to the Tax Code and reducing
regulatory burdens will we unleash American innovation and improve our
standard of living across the spectrum.
Thank
you ,
