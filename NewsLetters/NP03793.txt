Dear Friend,
Let me begin
by wishing you and your family a Merry Christmas and a Happy Holiday
season.
Christmas is a wonderful time filled with family,
friends, and good food; however, I hope that as you celebrate the
season, you also take time to remember its true meaning. More
than 2,000 years ago, a simple birth in a lowly stable changed the world
more than any other event in history.
The birth of Christ
continues to change hearts today with its message of hope and
redemption for all.
As we head into a
new year and the start of a new Congress, I ask for your continued
prayers
as I work to make the
best decisions for the 4 th
District and the United States. The next two years promise
to be challenging, yet also rewarding, as we work with a new
Republican controlled Senate.
Again: on behalf of Caroline,
Mary Elliot, Robert Hayes, and my staff, I wish you and your family a
bright and happy holiday season.
Sincerely,
Robert B. Aderholt
Member
of Congress
