Dear Friends:
Rep. Barrow visits a great small business
in Augusta-Buona Caffe.
The 12 th
District is full of businesses of all sizes, doing all kinds of work, and creating jobs.
This week is National Small Business Week, and this is the perfect time to recognize the entrepreneurs in our community who are the backbone of our economy.
According to the Small Business Administration, there are over 11,000 small businesses in the 12 th
District, employing more than 100,000 people.
Thats a great statistic, but heres an even better one
these small businesses have an annual payroll of almost $3 billion.
Ive had the honor of visiting so many of the folks in our communities who have taken on the challenge of starting their own business.
We need these businesses to succeed, and we need more folks to follow their lead.
This week, Im
releasing the updated version of our Small Business Resource Guide .
The Guide is a one-stop-shop for entrepreneurs looking to start a new business.
You can find contacts in the community who can help you obtain a startup loan or help put together a business plan.
These folks specialize in helping small businesses, so please take some time to check it out.
I know that starting a small business can be risky.
I hear from folks all the time about the obstacles they face in their business.
One of the biggest barriers is the overreach of the federal government into your business.
Im working to make sure you have the tools you need to start your business, but Im also fighting against the kind of overregulation that can keep you from hiring new workers and expanding your business opportunities.
Congratulations to all of our small businesses in the 12 th
District.
Your hard work does not go unnoticed by the community.
And remember
if theres anything that I can do to help you, please dont hesitate to call on me.
Sincerely,
John Barrow
Member of Congress
