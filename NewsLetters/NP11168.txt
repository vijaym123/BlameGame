$14.1 million waiting to be claimed by Coloradans who did not file a 2010 income tax return
Almost $14.1 million in unclaimed tax refunds may be waiting for an estimated 17,100 taxpayers in Colorado.
If you did not file an income tax return in 2010, you can still do it! The deadline is quickly approaching. In order to collect your return for 2010, you must file with the IRS no later than Tuesday, April 15, 2014.
An estimate made by the IRS indicates the median potential refund for 2010 is $567. In cases where a return was not filed, tax payers are given a three-year window of opportunity to claim their refund. If a return is not filed within these three years, the money then becomes property of the U.S. Treasury.
There is no penalty for filing a late return qualifying for a refund, but the return must be properly addressed, mailed, and postmarked by the deadline date.
Current and prior year tax forms and instructions are available on the
Forms and Publications
page of
IRS.gov
or by calling toll-free 800-TAX-FORM (800-829-3676). Taxpayers who are missing Forms W-2, 1098, 1099 or 5498 for 2010, 2011 or 2012 should request copies from their employer, bank or other payer.
If these efforts are unsuccessful, you can get a free transcript showing information from these year-end documents by going to
IRS.gov . You can also file
this form
to request a transcript of their tax return.
Tuition Fair connects constituent to major scholarship
Every February, I hold a tuition fair to help students and parents learn about financing college and what kind of scholarships are available to make higher education more affordable. Hundreds of people attend every year to meet with schools, listen to the scholarship panel and attend the Financial Aid: 101 sessions.
Last year, one of the students who attended was Dominic from Pomona High School. At the event, he learned about the Latin American Educational Fund, and he met one of their representatives who encouraged Dominic to apply for LAEF scholarships. Dominic is a dedicated student who overcame many obstacles to stay focused on school while participating in athletics at Pomona. On why he is so focused on academics, Dominic said:
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have much right now, but I have a chance and opportunities. Education is important to success and what you put into it is what you&rsquo;ll get out.&rdquo;
The Latin American Educational Fund selected Dominic to be their 2013-2014 Lola A. Salazar Student of the Year, a significant scholarship award. He is pursuing a double major in Biomedical Engineering and Biological &amp; Chemical Engineering at Colorado State University. Congratulations Dominic and good luck with your studies!
