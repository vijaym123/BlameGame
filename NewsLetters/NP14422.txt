Keeping a Promise
Weve heard the
promise many times since 2008: If you like your health insurance plan,
you can keep it.
In fact, weve heard it at least 29 times
according to one report.
However, it turns out that if you
like your health insurance plan, you arent necessarily able to keep it
because it may not comply with the regulations set out in
Obamacare.
In light of this, President Obama first tried to put an asterisk
at the end of the statement last week, suggesting What we said was
you could keep it if it hasnt changed since the law was
passed.
Then the White House claimed it was only five percent of
Americans that were affected, so it wasnt a major concern.
President
Obama finally ended last week by saying he was sorry that they are
finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from
me. At the end of the day, this whole episode is yet another
arrow in the quiver of reasons why this law is so ill-conceived and
unworkable and should be repealed.
But those Americans who are
losing their health insurance and facing higher premiums for new plans are
looking for help now. Thats why I am proud to cosponsor the
Keep Your Health Plan Act
(H.R. 3350), which will reduce the
burden of
Obamacare
for
millions of Americans who like their health insurance and want to keep it,
just like the President falsely promised youd be able to.
The
House will act on the bill this week, and I would hope the Senate and
the President would work with us to address this ongoing
problem.
