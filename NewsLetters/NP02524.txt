Dear Friend:
We are now just four days away from a shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) because Republicans refuse to fund the agency unless Congress agrees to rip apart millions of immigrant families.
This self-inflicted crisis by the Republicans is dangerous, it is unnecessary, and it is the height of irresponsibility.
Today, on the Senate floor, I called on Republicans to fully fund the Department of Homeland Security and then to immediately take up a bill to fix our nation's broken immigration system.
