News from Representative Randy Neugebauer
January 22, 2014
Dear Friend,
Today, thousands of people are marching in Washington, D.C. to support
the rights of the unborn. The March for Life brings supporters together
every year for the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, and every year I'm
inspired by the participants' passion and commitment to human life.
Like me, these men, women, and children believe that life is a
blessing, and we have a responsibility to protect and honor it.
In many cases, that conviction comes from deeply held religious
beliefs. Our country was founded by faithful men and women who wanted
to practice their religion freely, without interference from the
government. Honoring that freedom is one of the pillars of our
democracy.
But today, even as people are marching on Washington, that freedom is
in jeopardy thanks to the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, as it's
come to be known.
Most healthcare plans offered on the exchanges cover free abortions.
Each person that unknowingly chooses a plan that covers abortion will
be subsidizing abortions on demand. You'll pay for your neighbors'
abortion-inducing drugs, contraception, and sterilization.
Unfortunately, it's all too easy to accidentally pick an
abortion-subsidizing plan because Secretary Sebelius refuses to clarify
which plans include that coverage on the website.
Obamacare also forces businesses to pay for their employees' abortions,
contraception, and sterilization. Obama issued an "accommodation" to
religiously-affiliated organizations, allowing them to offer
abortion-free coverage if they sign a form permitting the insurance
company to directly contact the employees and offer those services at
no charge to them. The employer is still footing the bill for abortion
under this rule.
And what about all of the other employers that don't even get this
"accommodation"? If any employer provides insurance without even one of
the listed drugs or procedures, they face fines up to $36,500 per
employee per year. Compare that to if they offer no coverage at all -
then they pay only $2,000 per employee per year. Obama's rule punishes
companies that want to provide comprehensive insurance, but with a
conscience.
I've heard from small business owners in West Texas who feel like
they're being forced to choose between their religion and their
livelihood.
That is completely contrary to our founding principles.
This is an attack on religion, life, and family values. This is a
breach of religious liberty and a violation of our First Amendment
rights.
Abortion is not health care. We have to fight for those who cannot
fight for themselves. The innocent lives of the unborn need our
protection and prayers - not our silence and insurance money to end
their lives.
We don't have to let this new health care reform trample our
conscience. I've put my full support behind two bills this Congress to
protect your religious freedom against this mandate. There are also 91
cases challenging it in the courts right now.
I'll keep fighting in Washington to protect your rights and the rights
of all human lives. With Members of Congress, the courts, and millions
of Americans working together, we can protect America's conscience.
Thank you,

Representative
Randy
Neugebauer January

Dear
Friend,
Today,
thousands
of
people
are
marching
in
Washington,
D.C.
to
support
the
rights
of
the
unborn. The
March
for
Life
brings
supporters
together
every
year
for
the
anniversary
of
Roe
v.
Wade,
and
every
year
I&#8217;m
inspired
by
the
participants&#8217;
passion
and
commitment
to
human
life.
Like
me,
these
men,
women,
and
children
believe
that
life
is
a
blessing,
and
we
have
a
responsibility
to
protect
and
honor
it.
In
many
cases,
that
conviction
comes
from
deeply
held
religious
beliefs. Our
country
was
founded
by
faithful
men
and
women
who
wanted
to
practice
their
religion
freely,
without
interference
from
the
government. Honoring
that
freedom
is
one
of
the
pillars
of
our
democracy.
But
today,
even
as
people
are
marching
on
Washington,
that
freedom
is
in
jeopardy
thanks
to
the
Affordable
Care
Act,
or
Obamacare,
as
it&#8217;s
come
to
be
known.
Most
healthcare

it&#8217;s
all
too
easy
to
accidentally
pick
an
abortion-subsidizing
plan
because
Secretary
Sebelius
refuses
to
clarify
which
plans

that
coverage
on
the

Obamacare
also
forces
businesses
to
pay
for
their
employees&#8217;
abortions,
contraception,
and
sterilization. Obama
issued
an
&#8220;accommodation&#8221;
to
religiously-affiliated
organizations,
allowing
them

and
offer
those
services
at
no
charge
to
them .
The
employer
is
still
footing
the
bill
for
abortion
under
this
rule.
And
what
about
all
of
the
other
employers
that
don&#8217;t
even
get
this
&#8220;accommodation&#8221;? If
any
employer
provides
insurance
without
even
one
of
the
listed
drugs
or
procedures,
they
face
fines
up
to
$36,500

that
to
if
they
offer
no
coverage
at
all
&#8211;
then
they
pay
only
$2,000
per
employee
per
year. Obama&#8217;s
rule
punishes
companies
that
want
to
provide
comprehensive
insurance,
but
with
a

I&#8217;ve
heard
from
small
business
owners
in
West
Texas
who
feel
like
they&#8217;re
being
forced
to
choose
between
their
religion
and
their
livelihood.
That
is
completely
contrary
to
our
founding
principles. This
is
an
attack
on
religion,
life,
and
family
values. This
is
a
breach
of
religious
liberty
and
a
violation
of
our
First
Amendment
rights.
Abortion
is
not
health
care. We
have
to
fight
for
those
who
cannot
fight
for
themselves. The
innocent
lives
of
the
unborn
need
our
protection
and
prayers
&#8211;
not
our
silence
and
insurance
money
to
end
their
lives.
We
don&#8217;t
have
to
let
this
new
health
care
reform
trample
our
conscience. I&#8217;ve
put
my
full
support
behind
two

this
Congress
to
protect
your
religious
freedom
against
this
mandate. There
are
also
91

it
in

right

I&#8217;ll

and
the
rights
of
all
human
lives. With
Members
of
Congress,
the
courts,
and
millions
of
Americans
working
together,
we
can
protect
America&#8217;s
conscience.
