Dear Friends,
We've all heard the news coverage about
the troubled rollout of the federal website of the new health law.
There have been just as many untold success stories: People getting
health coverage for the very first time; lower premiums for those with
pre-existing conditions; and the freedom to change jobs without being tied
to a single health plan.
What Im interested in
hearing are stories from my 18th Congressional District constituents
about their experience with Covered California and the Affordable Care
Act by filling in the form on my website
here .
You can always contact my office directly for assistance with
your coverage by either visiting my website at http://eshoo.house.gov
or by calling 202-225-8104 (Washington) or 650-323-2984 (Palo
Alto).
Sincerely,
Anna G. Eshoo
Member
of Congress
