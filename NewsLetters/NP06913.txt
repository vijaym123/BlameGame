New VA Super Clinic Opening

Today, the brand new, state-of-the-art VA Super Clinic will open in
Colorado Springs with operating hours of 7:30am to 4:30pm Monday and
Tuesday and 7:30am to 6:30pm Wednesday through Saturday. The clinic is
located at 3141 Centennial Boulevard, Colorado Springs, CO 80907 just
off of Fillmore, west of I-25. This new facility replaces the two
smaller clinics located on Spruce Street and Fontenero

schedule appointments or to inquire about your medical
needs.

contact the Veterans Crisis Hotline if you are having thoughts of harming
yourself at (800) 273-8255. The hotline is available 24 hours, 7 days a
week.
The
following services will be offered in the new clinic: MRI, CT,
ultrasound, and x-ray services as well as the Veterans Benefits Administration
(VBA) will be located on the first floor. Optometry, Audiology,
Pharmacy, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, Laboratory,
Compensation and Pension, CWT, Homeless, and the Pre and Post-Surgical Clinic
will also be located on the first floor. Primary Care services,
OEF/OIF, wound care, and MOVE classroom will be located on the second floor.
Dental, Mental Health, and Substance Abuse Clinics will be located on
the third floor.
Colorado Springs Transit will provide a bus stop on Centennial
Blvd. For more information please view details at

facilities.
