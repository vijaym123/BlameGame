Dear Fellow Coloradan,
Washington has a lot to learn from how we do business in Colorado &mdash; and there's no better example of this than our diverse and balanced approach to energy. As a member of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I know there's no silver bullet to addressing our nation's 21st century energy needs. What we need is a silver buckshot approach.
Colorado's diverse and collaborative energy strategy holds the answer.
Since March 2013, my Colorado Energy Tour has taken me around the state, meeting with industry leaders, businesses and Coloradans like you to show how Colorado is leading the way in energy innovation and development. From the Western Slope to the Eastern Plains and the San Luis Valley to the central mountains, I&rsquo;ve seen firsthand how Colorado&rsquo;s energy pioneers are making our nation more energy independent and boosting our economy.
My tour &mdash; and the many stops along the way &mdash; demonstrated just how diverse Colorado&rsquo;s modern and innovative energy industry is.
I&rsquo;ve visited clean-tech startups, geothermal housing developments, natural gas processing facilities, and just about everywhere in between .
And our state&rsquo;s diverse energy industry isn&rsquo;t just powering the nation. It&rsquo;s also creating tens of thousands of good-paying Colorado jobs and bolstering our state&rsquo;s economy.
I capped off my statewide tour by hosting U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz and leaders from Colorado&rsquo;s energy industry at a Colorado Energy Forum at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden. Along with business leaders from around the state, I was able to show Energy Secretary Moniz that Colorado is a national leader in energy production, innovation and efficiency. I also outlined a path forward for our nation&rsquo;s energy future based on the Colorado model &mdash; one that supports American energy independence while also maintaining a firm commitment to protecting our land, and clean air and water.
As we look toward the future, I&rsquo;ll continue to fight for the smart policies and investments that will keep Colorado at the forefront of energy development. And I&rsquo;m confident that our state&rsquo;s innovative and independent spirit will allow us to continue to lead the way for the rest of the nation.
Warm regards,
Offices
