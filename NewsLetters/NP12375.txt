David --
The Koch Brothers&rsquo; network of Super PACs and outside groups were able to raise and spend more than
$400 million
in the 2012 elections.
For campaigns like ours that are powered by everyday people like you and me, that number is pretty devastating.
Thanks to the
Citizens United
Supreme Court decision, a few special interests backed by ultra-wealthy individuals have free reign to dump as much cash as they want into our elections. And so far in the 2014 election cycle, they&rsquo;ve spent almost $20 million in races all across the country. The spending is out of control. That&rsquo;s why Cheri supports taking steps to undo the harms of
Citizens United
and give the power back to the people. Will you sign your name to our petition telling Congress to take immediate action to overturn Citizens United?
When we stand together and show our grassroots strength, we&rsquo;ve proven time and time again that we can overcome these outside groups.
Please, add your name now and help us spread the word on this important issue. http://action.cheribustos.com/Fix-Citizens-United
