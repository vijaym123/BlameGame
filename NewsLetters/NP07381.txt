Conservatives
Demand Carter's Solution
Chairman Carter &amp; House solve President's self-inflicted
crisis
WASHINGTON D.C.- The House of
Representatives voted today to
pass Congressman John Carters (R-TX31)
conservative solution to the crisis at our border. The border
supplemental bill passed today includes provisions from
Rep.
Carters bill, introduced two weeks ago
and endorsed by the
Federation for American Immigration Reform, to ensure illegal immigrant
children are sent back to their home and that taxpayers will not have to
bear the burden of President Obamas self-inflicted crisis. Rep. Carter
also joined the House in a vote to prohibit President Obama from
granting blanket amnesty to the surge of illegal aliens.
No
bailouts, no permisos, and no amnesty! The Presidents permiso and lack
of enforcement of our immigration laws is what got us into this mess,
said Congressman Carter, Chairman of the House Appropriations
Subcommittee on Homeland Security. I have said many times that lawlessness
breeds lawlessness, which is what we are seeing at our border. We have
to correct the Presidents amnesty message and let the world know that
if you break our laws there will be consequences not
rewards.
This legislation:
Treats all unaccompanied
alien children (UAC) the same no matter if they are from Canada/Mexico
or Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador and streamlines the process to
return them to their home country
Allows officials to
hold UACs while their claim is being heard, instead of letting them
disappear into the country with their permiso and choose to ignore
their court date
Reaffirms that taxpayers will not pay for
lawyers to represent illegal immigrants
Reimburses
Texas for the costs of sending the Texas National Guard to the
border
Appropriates $70 million for the National
Guard
Rep. Carters fellow House member Steve King (R-IA4) said, "I
proposed and endorsed Congressman John Carter's legislation because I
believe it is the correct way to solve this crisis. It was the silver
bullet to unify our conference. I am grateful for Carter's insight and
hard work on this issue."
The $694 million appropriated by
H.R. 5230
is not the bailout the President
requested!
These funds are fully offset by cuts and recessions to
existing funds and are going to support enforcing our border while providing
funds to send these illegal immigrants back
home.
