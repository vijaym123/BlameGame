The 6th
District
Thanks for your vote of
confidence
Dear
Friends:
My thanks to the citizens of
the 6 th
Congressional District of
Colorado for allowing me the honor of serving you and our nation as a member of
the United States House of
Representatives.
I promise to represent you with the same
honor and integrity that I learned as a soldier in the
United States Army and as an officer in the United
States Marine Corps.
I pledge to listen to your concerns and do everything I
can to bridge the partisan divide that has plagued Washington, D.C.
and polarized our nation.
To the African, Asian, and Hispanic immigrant
communities who have welcomed me into their homes, their businesses, and their
churches, you are so important to the diverse fabric of this
district, I look forward to continue working with you in your journey to
achieve the American dream.
Let us now move forward to create a better, more inclusive
America.
...An America that recognizes the value of hard work, of strong
families, of a faith in God
...An America where everyone has the opportunity to
succeed and to achieve the American
Dream
...An America that honors the
sacrifices of the men and women who have served our nation in
uniform
...And an
America that remembers our obligations to those heroes after they
have come home.
Thank you for the opportunity to serve our great nation.
God
bless you, God bless Colorado, and God bless the United States of
America!
Sincerely,
Mike Coffman
U.S. Representative

Expanded Access to the Fry Scholarship for Surviving
Spouses
The
Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014
(Choice Act) was recently signed into law.
Most of the Act
pertains to Veterans health care, but it also included two provisions
affecting GI Bill benefits.
This note pertains to the
Fry
Scholarship .
The Fry Scholarship was created to honor Marine Gunnery
Sergeant John David Fry, 28, of Lorena, Texas.
Sergeant Fry had one
week left in his tour in Iraq in 2006, when he volunteered to continue
working for seven more hours disarming explosive devices, despite
having already sustained an injury to his hand.
He made the
ultimate sacrifice on March 8, 2006, in Anbar province, Iraq, when an
improvised explosive device detonated.
He left behind a widow and three
children.
Section 701 of the Choice Act expands the Fry
Scholarship to include the
surviving spouses of Service
members who died in the line of duty after September 10,
2001 .
Prior to
this law, only children of those who died in the line of duty were
eligible for this benefit.
The VA has had the honor to have served
1,279 children under the Fry Scholarship in FY 2013 and they now look
forward to now honoring the surviving
spouses.
The law states eligible spouses are
entitled to receive:
36 months of full benefits, equal to 100% level of the
Post-9/11 GI Bill this includes tuition and fee payment, a monthly housing
allowance, and a stipend for books and
supplies.
Training must start on, or
after, January 1, 2015.
Training prior to January 1, 2015, is not
eligible to receive benefits under Section
701.
A spouse has 15 years
from the date of the Service Members death to utilize benefits.
If
a spouse remarries, benefits end the date of the
remarriage.
Some
spouses currently eligible for, or already receiving, benefits under
the Survivors and Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) program may
now be eligible for the Fry Scholarship.
DEA is an educational
program offering up to 45 months of education benefits to eligible
dependents of Veterans who died while on active duty, as well as dependents of
Veterans who died as a result of a service-connected condition, or are
permanently and totally disabled due to a service-related
condition.
Surviving spouses of Servicemembers who died in the line of duty
after September 10, 2001, will have to make a one-time irrevocable
election to receive either the Fry Scholarship or
DEA.
The VA expects to begin
accepting Fry Scholarship applications, by mail, from spouses starting
Monday, November 3, 2014.
If you know of a surviving spouse, please pass this
information on.
As well, please get this information out to your networks
so we can ensure everyone who may be eligible is aware.

about this important new benefit, please review the Fact Sheet at

make an election, one can complete and send an application (Form
