Dear Friends,
This past week marked the 4th anniversary of
President Obama signing the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) into federal law. Since then, Obamacare has been an
unaffordable
disaster for our entire country, causing premiums to skyrocket, health plans to be dropped, and jobs
and wages to be threatened and destroyed. In our commonwealth alone, the law has caused more than 250,000 Pennsylvanians to lose their health insurance -- despite the president's now-broken promise that no one's plan would ever be cancelled. Since entering office, I have seized every opportunity to repeal the law or at least reduce the negative effects of the law so that fewer Americans are harmed by its implementation. I will not give up this fight until it is fully won. At the same time, I still believe that effective, patient-centered health-care reform -- with the right guiding principles -- can still be achieved. That is why I am co-sponsoring the American Health Care Reform Act -- a commonsense, patient-centered alternative to Obamacare that will make health insurance more affordable and more accessible to the most vulnerable Americans in a way that doesn't damage our economy or disrupt anyone's existing coverage.
I invite you to read more about my plan to repeal and replace Obamacare
here .
This week also saw the United States Supreme Court listen to the oral arguments in
Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.
-- a case which will determine whether or not the government can force a religious employer to provide his or her employees with insurance coverage of contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs regardless of his or her faith's objections.
As the high court considers this landmark case,
I proudly and strongly stand with Hobby Lobby and all who rightly believe in defending the First Amendment. Nothing less than the future defi nition of religious liberty in America is at stake here. No American should ever be forced by the government to choose between violating his or her religious faith or risk losing his or her business (and all the jobs it provides) to crippling federal penalties.
Sincerely,
Rep. Kelly Votes to
Protect
Coal Mining Jobs
& Stop Government Waste
House passes 'Preventing Government Waste and Protecting Coal Mining Jobs in America Act' with bipartisan support
WATCH HERE
On Tuesday, Rep. Kelly spoke on the floor of the House of Representatives in support of
H.R. 2824 ,
the Preventing Government Waste and Protecting Coal Mining Jobs in America Act . The legislation would save American jobs and taxpayer dollars by preventing the Obama administration's expensive rewrite of the 2008 Stream Buffer Zone Rule, which would effectively shut down most of the nation's underground coal mines. The bill was passed by the House with bipartisan support by a vote of 229-192.
Highlights from Rep. Kelly's floor speech:
"There is no question about the [Obama administration's] war on coal. It is factual.
... The area of the country that I represent is Western Pennsylvania. It is hard to look at a source that is so abundant, so accessible, so affordable, so reliant, and so sustainable, that keeps our energy costs lower; it creates thousands of jobs. The administration's efforts have not only eliminated people who are mining coal; they have absolutely eliminated entire communities and wiped them off the face of the Earth."
"In 2008, we had a rule that received certification from the Environmental Protection Agency and completely complied with the Clean Water Act - so the question becomes: how good does the coal industry have to become in order to receive a pat on the back from the administration? The answer is: they can never reach that level; they will never be accepted; it will never be part of our energy strategy; it will never lead America to be independent from every place else in the world."
"All you have to ask yourself is: What in the world are we doing to the people we represent? This is not a Republican strategy or a Democrat strategy - this is an American strategy. If it is truly about energy and creating jobs and protecting our environment, it's all there, gentlemen, and it's been there for years."
"The lights are going out across this country. Our position in the world is being challenged right now. In a country that has been so blessed for so long with abundant, affordable, and accessible energy - [it is wrong] to sit back and say, 'You know what? [Coal mining plants] are getting better but they are never going to be good enough for us; they are just never going to quite reach that metric that they have to reach.'"
"So we have to start asking ourselves: Where is it that they going with this? Is this a way to prop up an agenda by the administration or is this a way to prop up the American success story? Are we going to go forward and truly achieve an independence of energy from any other place in the world other than our own? Or are we going to continue to fight over things that don't make sense to the American people and yet somehow make sense in this House?"
"What we are doing today just makes sense. We have already run the traps on it; we have already run the tests; we have done all the metrics. Coal is good for America. Coal has always been good for America. Coal has cleaned itself up incredibly, and will continue to do so. These are the most responsible people. I would invite some of my friends who have never been down in a coal mine: travel with me to Western Pennsylvania; go down in the Bailey Mine; go down 700 feet and see how they are mining coal today, and see how they are scrubbing coal, and then say to me that they are not doing it the right way."
Rep. Kelly Honors
Slippery Rock University's
125th Anniversary on House Floor
WATCH HERE
On Wednesday,
Rep. Kelly delivered a speech on the floor of the House of Representatives in honor of the 125th anniversary of Slippery Rock University in Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania. An official statement of commemoration by Rep. Kelly was inserted into the congressional record earlier this week.
Statement by Rep. Kelly:
"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Slippery Rock University, which is celebrating its 125th anniversary this year.
"In 1887, the citizens of Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania saw the need for affordable and accessible higher education in their community. In less than 18 months, land was purchased from my good friend and colleague Jim Gerlach's family, to whom it belonged for three generations.
"On that land was soon established 'Slippery Rock State Normal School.' It opened to 168 students on March 26, 1889 with its 'ultimate object ... to make the student ... an educator.'
It was purchased by the Commonwealth in 1926, and was granted university status in 1983.
"After 125 years, Slippery Rock University has nearly 80,000 proud graduates. It offers a broad array of undergraduate and graduate programs to more than 8,000 students, and is consistently recognized as a great place to learn and work.
"For as long as this impressive institution remains standing, Slippery Rock's commitment to intellectual development, leadership, and civic responsibility will endure."
Rep. Kelly Receives
"Champion
of Healthcare Innovation"
Award
Rep. Kelly
was presented with the "Champion of Healthcare Innovation" Award on Wednesday by the
Healthcare Leadership Council
(HLC) at the organization's annual Healthcare Innovations Expo on Capitol Hill. The award is designed to recognize individual lawmakers for their ongoing support of patient-centered medical progress.
Statement by Rep. Kelly:
"I am incredibly proud to receive this award and am enormously grateful to be recognized for fighting for patient-centered heath care solutions with my colleagues in the House.
The American Health Care Reform Act
which I am co-sponsoring would replace Obamacare and make health insurance more affordable and accessible to the most vulnerable among us while allowing American medical innovation - already the best in the world - to keep advancing. I thank the Healthcare Leadership Council not only for this award but for its role in making sure American patients are able to enjoy the best care that 21st century medicine can offer. I had a terrific time visiting their impressive expo and speaking with health care professionals in attendance, and I look forward to returning next year."
