Time to Stem the Tide of Executive Branch Overreach
The Constitution is pretty clear: Congress makes laws, the Judiciary
interprets the laws, and the President makes sure the laws are
executed. Yet, there is no end in sight to President Obama
circumventing Congress and the Constitution to get what he wants.
It's got to stop, and two bill passed by the House this week with my
support send a reminder that we live in a Democracy with a
Constitution. That means one person doesn't get to decide how to
execute the law of the land and when.
The ENFORCE the Law Act requires the President to report directly to
Congress when making a policy decision not to enforce a law; no more
picking and choosing what parts of a law you want to carry out.
One of the most egregious examples of overreach we've seen is with
Obamacare. The Faithful Executive of the Law Act tackles this problem
head on by formally disapproving the President's failure to fulfill his
duty to execute the law.

Defense Department Must Maintain Robust Navy Fleet
When it comes to national security, budget decisions must be made based
on strategic need, not how many dollars the Administration thinks
should be cut to fund its own priorities. Fewer forces mean higher
risk, and now is not the time to cut back our military.
I questioned Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel about the Defense
Department fiscal year 2015 budget request on Thursday, focusing on
plans for Cruisers and the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) fleet.
Despite reports stating that the Navy will buy 20 fewer LCSs, Secretary
Hagel told the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee that there are no
current plans to cut LCS production.
He has only asked the Navy to
report back on ways to make the LCS more capable and efficient.
I'll
take him at his word, but as I mentioned, the world is not a safer
place and the Navy will continually be asked to do more.
We can't afford one ship that can do it all. With a wide presence
around the globe that includes the largest carrier fleet in the world;
our Navy is a central player, protecting the nation against changing
and ever-present threats. We need ships like the Cruisers and a full
LCS fleet to meet those needs.
Questioning Secretary of State Chuck Hagel and Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey on Thursday.

It&#8217;s

and
two
bill

the

this

with

That
