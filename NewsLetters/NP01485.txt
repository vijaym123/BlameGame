Sun City Senior Town Hall
To kick off the week, I held a Senior Town Hall in Bluffton for Sun
City Hilton Head residents on Monday.
I spoke about the importance of
quality education and how apprenticeship programs are critical to
economic growth.
I enjoyed answering questions from the Sun City community.
ESEA Mark-Up
On Wednesday, we started the conversation on my #schoolchoice amendment
in the Senate HELP Committee. School choice provides opportunities for
students that wouldn't otherwise have them. The system has been failing
low-income families for decades, and it's far past time for change.
We'll continue this necessary debate as reauthorization of the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act moves forward in committee and
to the floor of the Senate. Read my entire statement on ESEA here
.
Rethinking Economic Renewal with The Atlantic
Also, on Wednesday I teamed up with colleague and friend Senator Cory
Booker (D-NJ) to lead a panel on economic renewal and innovation. I
would like to thank the folks at The Atlantic magazine for asking me to
participate in a critical conversation.
Northside Project in Spartanburg, South Carolina is an ideal example of
ways we can rethink economic development.
You can watch me discuss the
Northside Project, apprenticeship programs (the LEAP Act), and the
importance of quality education here.

Body Cameras
I believe that having law enforcement officers wear body cameras
provides greater protection for both law enforcement officers and
citizens. As the South Carolina Legislature begins consideration of
S.47, a number of important questions must be asked and answered in
regards to implementation of a body camera program. I look forward to a
robust debate on those questions and making progress on this matter.
As the debate begins in South Carolina, I will continue to look at
possible federal solutions in regards to this issue as well. I am
committed to working with communities, law enforcement, public
officials and others to improve the interaction between police officers
and communities throughout the nation.
Thanks again for subscribing!
Sincerely,
Tim
