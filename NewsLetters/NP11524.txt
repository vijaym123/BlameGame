Dear Friends,
I write to you today to give a brief overview on a number of issues and
events currently going on in Washington. Due to Election year
guidelines from the Committee on House Administration, I will be
limited in the number of updates I am allowed to send over the next
several months. In order to stay in touch, please

eNewsletter subscriber.
Executive overreach
I am deeply concerned with what I believe to be an extensive
constitutional overreach by this Administration. From selecting which
facets of Obamacare to enforce, delay or ignore, to unilaterally
changing welfare work requirements, and refusing to enforce immigration
laws, I find this Administration's behavior extremely troubling. In an
effort to force the President to comply with the law as explicitly
required by the Constitution, I have cosponsored the STOP Resolution
and the ENFORCE the Law Act
to bring legal action against these
transgressions and restore our systems of checks and balances as
envisioned by the Founding Fathers. While the President has a pen and a
phone, the Congress has the Constitution
.
South Carolina Energy Production
I strongly believe American energy production is one of the biggest
factors that will get our economy moving again and put people back to
work. Energy production here at home has the potential to bring tens of
thousands of well-paying jobs to South Carolina
, grow state
revenues to help repair our roads, bridges and infrastructure projects,
and lessen our dependence on foreign energy sources. Energy production
grows the economy at no cost to the government while helping to combat
the rise in gas and grocery prices. I have fought in Congress to
include South Carolina
in the next round of offshore lease sales, as
well as introduced legislation
that puts forward an all-the-above national energy policy. The
Administration has responded favorably by allowing for seismic testing
in the Atlantic so that we can update our
multi-decade old data on energy resources.
International Crises
There are currently multiple international crises occurring at this
very moment. Recently, protests in Venezuela have arisen against
certain economic and social issues in the government. Although the
protests were peaceful, Venezuelan President Nicols Maduro has
responded with deadly force.
On the other side of the world, due to pressure from the Russian
government, Ukraine recently opted out of an Association Agreement with
the European Union - something the people of Ukraine and government
have been moving towards for some time. This caused widespread protests
to arise, met quickly by violent police push back resulting in the
deaths of over 80 people. Last month, masked armed forces took over the
Crimean parliament, and just recently, the Russian parliament voted to
deploy Russian troops on Ukraine. Now with the Russian military
occupying the Crimean region of Ukraine, the illegitimate Crimean
"government" has singled they want to become part of Russia. This has
caused much international tension, and Russia's actions resemble the
Soviet
Union more than a modern day 21st century nation.
While I'm not in support of U.S. military intervention in either
situation, I believe that the United States plays an important role as
countries like Venezuela and Ukraine strive to be more free. For these
two countries, this is their '1776 moment.'
IRS Targeting
Last week, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held
a continuation of a previous hearing investigating the IRS' targeting
of Americans for their political beliefs. Once again, Lois Lerner, the
former head of the IRS tax-exempt unit, refused to cooperate with House
Members on the panel during questioning of the politization of the IRS.
Although she has already admitted Tea Party organizations were
wrongfully targeted she continues to claim the Fifth Amendment and
refuses to testify. The Laurens County Tea Party was among those
targeted, and one of the organization's leaders, Dianne Belsom,
previously testified before the House Ways and Means Committee
on these wrongful actions. Here are seven more questions
Lois Lerner would not
answer in last week's hearing. The Committee is currently considering
whether to charge Ms. Lerner with contempt of Congress.
District Tour
Two weeks ago I wrapped up a great tour of the Third District, making
stops in Saluda, Greenville, Laurens
, Oconee, Pickens
, Anderson, and Greenwood
counties. I heard a lot from families and
individuals concerned with the Obama economy, businesses doing great
things despite burdensome Washington regulations and what ObamaCare has
done to their health care plans and costs. We have a lot of work to do
to get government working for the people again, not against them. I am
already looking forward to my next district tour after next week.

Dear

Washington. Due

Executive
overreach
I
am
deeply concerned
with
what
I
believe
to
be
an
extensive constitutional
overreach
by
this
Administration. From
selecting
which
facets
of
Obamacare
to
enforce,
delay
or
ignore, to
unilaterally
changing
welfare
work
requirements,
and
refusing
to
enforce
immigration
laws,
I
find
this
Administration's
behavior
extremely
troubling.
In
an
effort
to
force
the
President
to
comply
with
the
law
as
explicitly
required
by
the
Constitution,
I
have
cosponsored
the
STOP

and
the
ENFORCE
the
Law
Act
to
bring
legal
action
against
these
transgressions
and
restore our
systems
of
checks
and
balances as envisioned
by
the
Founding
Fathers.
While
the
President
has
a
pen
and
a
phone,
the
Congress
has
the
Constitution .
South
Carolina
Energy
Production I
strongly
believe
American
energy
production
is
one
of
the
biggest
factors
that
will
get
our
economy
moving
again
and
put
people
back
to
work.
Energy
production
here
at
home
has
the
potential
to
bring
tens
of
thousands
of
well-paying
jobs
to
South
Carolina ,
grow
state
revenues
to
help
repair
our
roads,
bridges
and
infrastructure
projects,
and
lessen
our
dependence
on
foreign
energy
sources.
Energy
production
grows
the
economy
at
no
cost
to
the
government
while
helping
to
combat
the
rise
in
gas
and
grocery
prices.
I
have
fought
in
Congress
to
include
South
Carolina
in
the
next
round
of
offshore
lease
sales,
as
well
as
introduced
legislation
that
puts
forward
an
all-the-above
national
energy
policy.
The
Administration
has
responded
favorably
by
allowing
for
seismic
testing
in
the
Atlantic
so
that
we
can
update
our
multi-decade
old
data
on
energy
resources.
International
Crises
There
are
currently
multiple
international
crises
occurring
at
this
very
moment.
Recently,
protests
in
Venezuela
have
arisen
against
certain
economic
and
social
issues
in
the
government.
Although
the
protests
were
peaceful,
Venezuelan
President
Nicol&#225;s
Maduro
has
responded
with
deadly
force.
On
the
other
side
of
the
world,
due
to
pressure
from
the
Russian
government,
Ukraine
recently
opted
out
of
an
Association
Agreement
with
the
European
Union
&#8211;
something
the
people
of
Ukraine
and
government
have
been
moving
towards
for
some
time.
This
caused
widespread
protests
to
arise,
met
quickly
by
violent
police
push
back
resulting
in
the
deaths
of
over
80
people.
Last
month,
masked
armed
forces
took
over
the
Crimean
parliament,
and
just
recently,
the
Russian
parliament
voted
to
deploy
Russian
troops
on
Ukraine.
Now
with
the
Russian
military
occupying
the
Crimean
region
of
Ukraine,
the
illegitimate
Crimean
&#8220;government&#8221;
has
singled
they
want
to
become
part
of
Russia.
This
has
caused
much
international
tension,
and
Russia&#8217;s
actions
resemble
the
Soviet
Union
more
than
a
modern
day
21st
century
nation.
While
I&#8217;m
not
in
support
of
U.S.
military
intervention
in
either
situation,
I
believe
that
the
United
States
plays
an
important
role
as
countries
like
Venezuela
and
Ukraine
strive
to
be
more
free.
For
these
two
countries,
this
is
their
&#8216;1776
moment.&#8217;
IRS
Targeting
Last
week,
the
House
Committee
on
Oversight
and
Government
Reform
held
a
continuation
of
a
previous
hearing
investigating
the
IRS&#8217;
targeting
of
Americans
for
their
political
beliefs.
Once
again,
Lois
Lerner,
the
former
head
of
the
IRS
tax-exempt
unit,
refused
to
cooperate
with
House
Members
on
the
panel
during
questioning
of
the
politization
of
the
IRS.
Although
she
has
already
admitted
Tea
Party
organizations
were
wrongfully
targeted
she
continues
to
claim
the
Fifth
Amendment
and
refuses
to
testify.
The
Laurens
County
Tea
Party
was
among
those
targeted,
and
one
of
the
organization&#8217;s
leaders,
Dianne
Belsom,
previously
testified
before
the
House
Ways
and
Means
Committee
on
these
wrongful
actions.
Here
are
seven
more
questions
Lois
Lerner
would
not
answer
in
last
week&#8217;s
hearing.
The
Committee
is
currently
considering
whether
to
charge
Ms.
Lerner
with
contempt
of
Congress.
District
Tour
Two
weeks
ago
I
wrapped
up
a
great
tour
of
the
Third
District,
making
stops
in
Saluda,
Greenville,
Laurens ,
Oconee,
Pickens ,
Anderson,
and
Greenwood
counties.
I
heard
a
lot
from
families
and
individuals
concerned
with
the
Obama
economy,
businesses
doing
great
things
despite burdensome
Washington
regulations and
what
ObamaCare
has
done
to
their
health
care
plans
and
costs.
We
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do
to
get
government
working
for
the
people
again,
not
against
them.
I
am
already
looking
forward
to
my
next
district
tour
after
next
week.
