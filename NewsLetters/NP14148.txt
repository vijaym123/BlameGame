Friend,
Let me begin by saying thank you to everyone who made it out to any of
my town halls over the past few weeks. In Purdy, Ocean Shores, and
Sequim we had a terrific turnout. The discussions were great, and it's
so valuable for me to hear your questions and ideas. Thanks to all who
participated!
Several common themes came out in our town hall meetings. People want
to see Congress deal with the budget and avoid another government
shutdown (I agree). People want to see a greater focus on progress
rather than on partisanship (I agree with that too). And people want to
see Congress engage on actually fixing problems (make it three for
three).
Let me kick off this week's newsletter by talking about one of those
problems that needs fixing.
Improving the Roll Out of the Affordable Care Act
You may have heard about problems related to the roll out of the
Affordable Care Act - or you may have experienced some issues yourself.
I think these problems need to be fixed.
Let me start with the good news. Our state's experience has been
substantially better than many others. As a recent article in the Los
Angeles Times pointed out, Washington has been "one of the brightest
success stories in the rocky national rollout of the federal health
law."
Over 57,000 insurance sign-ups were completed in our state in the first
month. As the News Tribune just reported, "State officials predict
those numbers are about to take a giant leap, with another 72,136
applications somewhere in the process and 21,671 who have chosen a plan
but still need to pay." While it's still early goings, we are seeing
many Washingtonians get access to quality, affordable health insurance -
in many cases for the very first time.
That said, there continue to be issues that need to be addressed. Those
problems are unacceptable, and the administration needs to fix these
issues quickly.
For example, there have clearly been some issues related to the federal
exchange web site.
In many states, folks haven't been able to shop for
a plan or to sign up. That needs to be fixed.
In addition, some people who have individual plans have seen their
plans cancelled. While the bulk of citizens of our state get their
health insurance through employers or are retirees who receive
Medicaid, about 4% of folks with insurance in our state hold individual
plans. It's estimated that as much as half of those consumers in the
individual market have plans that will no longer be offered.
About half of those affected by these cancellations will qualify for
subsidies to help pay for premiums on a new plan if they buy through
the state exchange Washington Healthplanfinder. But some folks have
seen their plan cancelled and won't qualify for help in purchasing a
new plan. That's particularly aggravating since people were told "if
you like your health care plan, you can keep it." I'm empathetic to
that frustration.
In response to the cancellation of these plans, the President announced
an administrative fix that would allow insurance company to continue to
offer older plans - even if they fail to provide some of the "essential
benefits" required under the new law (for example, things like
prescription drug coverage, certainty that you can't get dropped when
you get an illness, etc).
Today, the House voted on a bill sponsored by Representative Fred Upton
which was ostensibly focused on dealing with the cancellation problem
as well. Unfortunately, the bill would create more problems than it
would fix. In addition to allowing folks with less comprehensive
coverage to keep their plans, the bill proposed setting up a new
insurance market that would sell substandard plans to everyone -
meaning insurers could once again impose annual caps on coverage, deny
coverage based on pre-existing conditions, and charge women higher
premiums than men. In addition, as our state's Insurance Commissioner
noted yesterday, this bill could have serious impacts on the overall
stability of our health insurance market and could jack up insurance
rates for everyone in the individual market. I couldn't support that.
What's more, the Insurance Commissioner announced that even if the
Upton bill passed into law, he would not use the discretion allowed in
the bill to greenlight these substandard plans - meaning not a single
person in our state would benefit from the passage of this law.
I want to see us fix the problems - not undermine the ability of
Washingtonians to get affordable health care.
Let me say a few more things before I move on from this subject...
I wasn't in Congress when the Affordable Care Act was passed. There are
parts I would be inclined to change and there are parts of it that I
think represent progress for the families I represent. In the brief
time I've been in office, I've been working to ensure folks can access
the rights provided by the new law. People should know that, with this
new law, they have access to preventive services like check-ups and
mammograms without a copay. They should know that they have protections
that prevent insurance companies from jacking up premiums. They should
know that people with pre-existing conditions now cannot bedenied
coverage. And young people should know that they can now stay on their
parents' insurance until their 26th birthday.
At the same time, it's clear more needs to be done to improve problems
that we know exist with the new law - problems with the website,
challenges facing small businesses who want to provide insurance to
their employees but simply can't afford to, and challenges facing
providers throughout the state and particularly in rural areas.
I'm hopeful that rather than playing partisan games and taking
continued votes to repeal and undermine the law, Congress will get to
work on trying to fix it so that it can work for every family and
employer.
In the meantime, my office is available to anyone having trouble
navigating the rollout of the health care law. Please call any of my
offices if you are finding problems or need assistance.
Moving forward with America COMPETES
On a totally separate note, this week has seen some progress on a piece
of legislation I've been working on called America COMPETES. This
legislation deals with national research policy and policies related to
Science, Technology, Engineering and Math education. The law was
originally passed in 2007 on a bipartisan basis and is currently up for
reauthorization. I'm playing an active role as a member of the Science,
Space, and Technology Committee to engage on this issue.
Since early this year, some of my colleagues on the committee and I
have held informal talks and briefings including roundtables with the
Washington Technology Alliance and with representatives from academia
and industry in order to build principles to guide the reauthorization
of this law. We released those principles earlier this week, and you
can check them out here
.
The truth is that if America doesn't raise its game through investments
in education and innovation, we are going to get our backsides handed
to us.
When I worked in economic development, I used to have a sign up in my
office that said, "We are competing with everyone, everywhere, every
day, forever." That's a pretty good ethic - not just for economic
development in our region but for our nation's efforts to compete
globally.
These principles for growth through innovation, research, and economic
development offer a foundation for America's continued competitiveness
in a 21st Century economy.
We had a hearing earlier this week on a bill that deals with a
substantial part of America COMPETES. I weighed in with some comments
during the hearing, and you can watch them here(click here
to watch my statement at the hearing).
Whether a full COMPETES reauthorization moves forward or if the
strategy moves forward in a series of piecemeal bills, I'm committed to
ensuring the full set of principles and comprehensive goals are
ultimately passed by the Committee and the House.
Calling for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act
Many of you may have seen that the United States Senate recently passed
the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, a bill that would prohibit
employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender
identity. Our state passed a similar law several years ago, but
national legislation is important because these protections shouldn't
end at our state's borders. Please check out my speech
on the House floor earlier this week calling for the House to
take up legislation that would extend these protections to folks in
every state. As John F. Kennedy once said, "In giving rights to others
that belong to them, we give rights to ourselves and to our country."
Puget Sound Recovery
I've mentioned in this newsletter before that Representative Denny Heck
and I co-founded the Puget Sound Recovery Caucus several months ago to
figure out what we can do at a federal level to solve some of the
problems we're facing in the Puget Sound and to be proactive in
problems that are just beginning to arise.
At a Science, Space and Technology Committee hearing with EPA
Administrator Gina McCarthy, I asked her for her insights in how we can
make progress on these issues, especially in light of our budget
challenges and the problems caused by sequestration.
Take a look at the video here
.
OK... as you can see, it's been a really busy week! Thanks as always
for reading. I'll be sure to keep you updated on all of these issues.
Please don't hesitate to reach out if I can be helpful.
Sincerely,
Derek

Friend,
Let
me
begin
by
saying
thank
you
to
everyone
who
made
it
out
to
any
of
my
town
halls
over
the
past
few
weeks. In
Purdy,
Ocean
Shores,
and
Sequim
we
had
a
terrific
turnout. The
discussions
were
great,
and
it&#8217;s
so
valuable
for
me
to
hear
your
questions
and
ideas. Thanks
to
all
who
participated!
Several
common
themes
came
out
in
our
town
hall
meetings. People
want
to
see
Congress
deal
with
the
budget
and
avoid
another
government
shutdown
(I
agree). People
want
to
see
a
greater
focus
on
progress
rather
than
on
partisanship
(I
agree
with
that
too). And
people
want
to
see
Congress
engage
on
actually
fixing
problems
(make
it
three
for
three).
Let
me
kick
off
this
week&#8217;s
newsletter
by
talking
about
one
of
those
problems
that
needs
fixing.
Improving
the
Roll
Out
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act You
may
have
heard
about
problems
related
to
the
roll
out
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act
&#8211;
or
you
may
have
experienced
some
issues
yourself. I
think
these
problems
need
to
be
fixed.
Let
me
start
with
the
good
news. Our
state&#8217;s
experience
has
been
substantially
better
than
many
others. As
a
recent
article
in
the
Los
Angeles
Times
pointed
out,
Washington
has
been
&#8220; one
of
the
brightest
success
stories
in
the
rocky
national
rollout
of
the
federal
health
law.&#8221;
Over
57,000
insurance
sign-ups
were
completed
in
our
state
in
the
first
month. As
the
News
Tribune
just
reported,
&#8220; State
officials
predict
those
numbers
are
about
to
take
a
giant
leap,
with
another
72 ,136
applications
somewhere
in
the
process
and
21,671
who
have
chosen
a
plan
but
still
need
to
pay.&#8221;
While
it&#8217;s
still
early
goings,
we
are
seeing
many
Washingtonians
get
access
to
quality,
affordable
health
insurance
&#8211;
in
many
cases
for
the
very
first
time.
That
said,
there
continue
to
be
issues
that
need
to
be
addressed.
Those
problems
are
unacceptable,
and
the
administration
needs
to
fix
these
issues
quickly.
For
example,
there
have
clearly
been
some
issues
related
to
the
federal
exchange
web
site.
In
many
states,
folks
haven&#8217;t
been
able
to
shop
for
a
plan
or
to
sign
up. That
needs
to
be
fixed.
In
addition,
some
people
who
have
individual
plans
have
seen
their
plans
cancelled. While
the
bulk
of
citizens
of
our
state
get
their
health
insurance
through
employers
or
are
retirees
who
receive
Medicaid,
about
4%
of
folks
with
insurance
in
our
state
hold
individual
plans. It&#8217;s
estimated
that
as
much
as
half
of
those
consumers
in
the
individual
market
have
plans
that
will
no
longer
be
offered.
About
half
of
those
affected
by
these
cancellations
will
qualify
for
subsidies
to
help
pay
for
premiums
on
a
new
plan
if
they
buy
through
the
state
exchange
Washington
Healthplanfinder. But
some
folks
have
seen
their
plan
cancelled
and
won&#8217;t
qualify
for
help
in
purchasing
a
new
plan. T hat&#8217;s
particularly
aggravating
since
people
were
told
&#8220;if
you
like
your
health
care
plan,
you
can
keep
it.&#8221;
I&#8217;m
empathetic
to
that
frustration.
In
response
to
the
cancellation
of
these
plans,
the
President
announced
an
administrative
fix
that
would
allow
insurance
company
to
continue
to
offer
older
plans
&#8211;
even
if
they
fail
to
provide
some
of
the
&#8220;essential
benefits&#8221;
required
under
the
new
law
(for
example,
things
like
prescription
drug
coverage,
certainty
that
you
can&#8217;t
get
dropped
when
you
get
an
illness,
etc).
Today,
the
House
voted
on
a
bill
sponsored
by
Representative
Fred
Upton
which
was
ostensibly
focused
on
dealing
with
the
cancellation
problem
as
well. Unfortunately,
the
bill
would
create
more
problems
than
it
would
fix. In
addition
to
allowing
folks
with
less
comprehensive
coverage
to
keep
their
plans,
the
bill
proposed setting
up
a
new
insurance
market
that
would
sell
substandard
plans
to
everyone
&#8211;
meaning
insurers
could
once
again
impose
annual
caps
on
coverage,
deny
coverage
based
on
pre-existing
conditions,
and
charge
women
higher
premiums
than
men. In
addition, as
our
state&#8217;s
Insurance
Commissioner
noted
yesterday,
this
bill
could
have
serious
impacts
on
the
overall
stability
of
our
health
insurance
market
and
could
jack
up
insurance
rates
for
everyone
in
the
individual
market . I
couldn&#8217;t
support
that.
What&#8217;s
more,
the
Insurance
Commissioner
announced
that
even
if
the
Upton
bill
passed
into
law,
he
would
not
use
the
discretion
allowed
in
the
bill
to
greenlight
these
substandard
plans
&#8211;
meaning
not
a
single
person
in
our
state
would
benefit
from
the
passage
of
this
law.
I
want
to
see
us
fix
the
problems
&#8211;
not
undermine
the
ability
of
Washingtonians
to
get
affordable
health
care.
Let
me
say
a
few
more
things
before
I
move
on
from
this
subject...
I
wasn&#8217;t
in
Congress
when
the
Affordable
Care
Act
was
passed. There
are
parts
I
would
be
inclined
to
change
and
there
are
parts
of
it
that
I
think
represent
progress
for
the
families
I
represent. In
the
brief
time
I&#8217;ve
been
in
office,
I&#8217;ve
been
working
to
ensure
folks
can
access
the
rights
provided
by
the
new
law.
People
should
know
that,
with
this
new
law,
they
have
access
to
preventive
services
like
check-ups
and
mammograms
without
a
copay.
They
should
know
that
they
have
protections
that
prevent
insurance
companies
from
jacking
up
premiums.
They
should
know
that
people
with
pre-existing
conditions
now
cannot
be denied
coverage.
And
young
people
should
know
that
they
can
now
stay
on
their
parents&#8217;
insurance
until
their
26th
birthday.
At
the
same
time,
it&#8217;s
clear
more
needs
to
be
done
to
improve
problems
that
we
know
exist
with
the
new
law
&#8211;
problems
with
the
website,
challenges
facing
small
businesses
who
want
to
provide
insurance
to
their
employees
but
simply
can&#8217;t
afford
to,
and
challenges
facing
providers
throughout
the
state
and
particularly
in
rural
areas.
I&#8217;m
hopeful
that
rather
than
playing
partisan
games
and
taking
continued
votes
to
repeal
and
undermine
the
law,
Congress
will
get
to
work
on
trying
to
fix
it
so
that
it
can
work
for
every
family
and
employer.
In
the
meantime,
my
office
is
available
to
anyone
having
trouble
navigating
the
rollout
of
the
health
care
law. Please
call
any
of
my
offices
if
you
are
finding
problems
or
need
assistance.
Moving
forward
with
America
COMPETES
On
a
totally
separate
note,
this
week
has
seen
some
progress
on
a
piece
of
legislation
I've
been
working
on
called
America
COMPETES.
This
legislation
deals
with
national
research
policy
and
policies
related
to
Science,
Technology,
Engineering
and
Math
education.
The
law
was
originally
passed
in
2007
on
a
bipartisan
basis
and
is
currently
up
for
reauthorization.
I'm
playing
an
active
role
as
a
member
of
the
Science,
Space,
and
Technology
Committee
to
engage
on
this
issue.
Since
early
this
year,
some
of
my
colleagues
on
the
committee
and
I
have
held
informal
talks
and
briefings
including
roundtables
with
the
Washington
Technology
Alliance
and
with
representatives
from
academia
and
industry
in
order
to
build
principles
to
guide
the
reauthorization
of
this
law. We
released
those
principles
earlier
this
week,
and
you
can
check
them
out
here .
The
truth
is
that
if
America
doesn&#8217;t
raise
its
game
through
investments
in
education
and
innovation,
we
are
going
to
get
our
backsides
handed
to
us.
When
I
worked
in
economic
development,
I
used
to
have
a
sign
up
in
my
office
that
said,
&#8220;We
are
competing
with
everyone,
everywhere,
every
day,
forever.&#8221; That&#8217;s
a
pretty
good
ethic
&#8211;
not
just
for
economic
development
in
our
region
but
for
our
nation&#8217;s
efforts
to
compete
globally.
These
principles
for
growth
through
innovation,
research,
and
economic
development
offer
a
foundation
for
America&#8217;s
continued
competitiveness
in
a
21 st
Century
economy.
We
had
a
hearing
earlier
this
week
on
a
bill
that
deals
with
a
substantial
part
of
America
COMPETES.
I
weighed
in
with
some
comments
during
the
hearing,
and
you
can
watch
them
here (click
here
to
watch
my
statement
at
the
hearing).
Whether
a
full
COMPETES
reauthorization
moves
forward
or
if
the
strategy
moves
forward
in
a
series
of
piecemeal
bills,
I&#8217;m
committed
to
ensuring
the
full
set
of
principles
and
comprehensive
goals
are
ultimately
passed
by
the
Committee
and
the
House.
Calling
for
the
Employment
Non-Discrimination
Act
Many
of
you
may
have
seen
that
the
United
States
Senate
recently
passed
the
Employment
Non-Discrimination
Act,
a
bill
that
would
prohibit
employment
discrimination
based
on
sexual
orientation
or
gender
identity.
Our
state
passed
a
similar
law
several
years
ago,
but
national
legislation
is
important
because
these
protections
shouldn&#8217;t
end
at
our
state&#8217;s
borders.
Please
check
out
my
speech
on
the
House
floor
earlier
this
week
calling
for
the
House
to
take
up
legislation
that
would
extend
these
protections
to
folks
in
every
state.
As
John
F.
Kennedy
once
said,
&#8220;In
giving
rights
to
others
that
belong
to
them,
we
give
rights
to
ourselves
and
to
our
country.&#8221;
Puget
Sound
Recovery
I&#8217;ve
mentioned
in
this
newsletter
before
that
Representative
Denny
Heck
and
I
co-founded
the
Puget
Sound
Recovery
Caucus
several
months
ago
to
figure
out
what
we
can
do
at
a
federal
level
to
solve
some
of
the
problems
we&#8217;re
facing
in
the
Puget
Sound
and
to
be
proactive
in
problems
that
are
just
beginning
to
arise.
At
a
Science,
Space
and
Technology
Committee
hearing
with
EPA
Administrator
Gina
McCarthy,
I
asked
her
for
her
insights
in
how
we
can
make
progress
on
these
issues,
especially
in
light
of
our
budget
challenges
and
the
problems
caused
by
sequestration.
Take
a
look
at
the
video
here .
OK...
as
you
can
see,
it&#8217;s
been
a
really
busy
week! Thanks
as
always
for
reading.
I&#8217;ll
be
sure
to
keep
you
updated
on
all
of
these
issues. Please
don&#8217;t
hesitate
to
reach
out
if
I
can
be
helpful.
