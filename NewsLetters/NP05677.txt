Dear Friends,
October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and like you, I am deeply concerned with the devastating effect breast cancer has on the lives of afflicted women and their families.
The
American Cancer Society
estimates that one in eight women living in the U.S. will develop breast cancer during the course of her life.
Today, nearly three million American women have been diagnosed with breast cancer and are in remission or undergoing treatment.
As one of the leading causes of death among women, breast cancer must be confronted through continued research and increased access to screening and treatment.
That is why, while serving in the California State Legislature and the U.S. House of Representatives, I have consistently supported robust funding for breast cancer initiatives.
In Congress, I am a co-sponsor of the Accelerating the End of Breast Cancer Act of 2013 (H.R. 1830). H.R. 1830 would direct President Barack Obama to establish the Commission to Accelerate the End of Breast Cancer to help end breast cancer by January 1, 2020. The Commission would identify opportunities where the government and the private sector could work together on breast cancer research and prevention. Additionally, I cosponsored the Breast Cancer Awareness Commemorative Coin Act (H.R. 3680).
If passed, the Secretary of the Treasury would mint up to 500,000 $1 silver coins as a symbol of the fight against breast cancer and to raise funds for breast cancer research.
Sadly, we all have family, friends, and loved ones who have been diagnosed with breast cancer, and some of you have been personally affected.
We must continue to persevere and continue this fight against breast cancer by not only raising awareness but also serving as a support system for the thousands of individuals who are diagnosed annually.
As someone who has personally faced the challenges of cancer in my own family, I will continue working to advance the fight against cancer as a Member of Congress.
Together, we can make a difference and end breast cancer. Please don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact me on this or any other federal issue of importance to you. Furthermore, I encourage you to visit my website at
