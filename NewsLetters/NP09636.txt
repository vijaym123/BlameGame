Supporting Our Small Businesses
Dear Friends,
In case you haven't already heard, this week marks National Small
Business Week-an ideal time to shop local, support our neighborhood
entrepreneurs and call attention to solutions that will jumpstart our
economy and help our small businesses grow.
As a small business owner myself, I understand the challenges that
families and businesses face in the Obama economy. Today, I held a
roundtable with business leaders in Cheatham County to listen to their
concerns and talk about ways to ease the burden Washington places on
them. I have hosted similar events over the past month in Lebanon
, Cookeville
, and
Hendersonville
.
Overwhelmingly, small business owners tell me that if government will
get off their backs and out of their wallets, they can do what they do
best-create jobs.
Small businesses have a proven track record of success. They created
67% of net new jobs in our country over the past 17 years.
Washington
should empower our small businesses to grow, build capital and create
jobs instead of saddling them with red tape and regulations that make
it harder to get their business off the ground. To that end, the House
has passed dozens of bipartisan, pro-jobs bills to help unleash our
small businesses' potential, including:
*	The SKILLS Act (H.R. 803)-Legislation backed by the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce to streamline our workforce development system and
retool our job training programs.
*	The Save American Workers Act (H.R. 2575)-Repeals Obamacare's
job-killing 30-hour work week definition and restores the 40-hour work
week to prevent hourly workers from seeing hours and wages cut.
*	The REINS Act (H.R. 367)-Reforms the outdated regulatory
process that hurts private-sector job creation by requiring an
up-or-down vote in Congress on major new rules and regulations from the
executive branch.
*	The Innovation Act (H.R. 3309)-Helps businesses better defend
themselves against abusive patent litigation, promoting more
private-sector growth, innovation, and job creation.
These are just a sampling of the bills passed by the House to encourage
job creation and spur economic growth. Unfortunately, each of these
measures are among the 246 bills
stuck in Harry Reid's Senate. This Small
Business Week, join me in calling on Senate Democrats to put jobs and
American workers ahead of party politics by acting on these commonsense
items of legislation. Fight back with me by becoming a Citizen
Cosponsor of these and other House-led jobs initiatives HERE
.
Sincerely,
Diane Black
Member of Congress

Dear
Friends,
In
case
you
haven&#8217;t
already
heard,
this

As

Hendersonville .
Overwhelmingly,
small
