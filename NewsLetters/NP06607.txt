Friends,
Tomorrow we recognize our nations labor force
and honor the tradition of hard work that created the America we love
today.
House Republicans have worked hard to grow the
value of the dollar and American paychecks simultaneously, and as South
Carolinians, we are fortunate to live in a state where job
opportunities and job security are not threatened by
unions.
But our
work force needs more.
House Republicans have solutions
that will give Americans more-- more economic certainty, more health
care choices, and more affordable utilities like gas and electricity.
Since we believe that hardworking Americans fuel our economy, we have
passed more than 40 jobs bills that are awaiting action in the
Democrat-run Senate.
We will continue to put forth more solutions to
stop the current economic squeeze and make the American Dream a reality
again.
I will never stop working for our job seekers, job
holders, and job creators.
I sincerely thank our labor force
for their hard work and commitment to the country we all
love.
Happy Labor
Day,
Tell a Friend
