Veteran's Solutions Seminars
This week, I hosted four veteran's solutions seminars. It was an honor
and a privilege to meet so many men and women who served. Making sure
that those who fought for our country are properly taken care of once
they return home is one of my top priorities as a Member of Congress.
Thank you to the North Carolina Department of Veteran Affairs (NCVA),
the Winston-Salem Regional Benefit Office, and the North Carolina
Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for participating. I'm happy that so
many veterans came out and were able to get the assistance they needed.

Visiting North Carolina Job-Makers
Earlier this week I had the pleasure of visiting Meritor Inc.'s
Fletcher, NC manufacturing plant. Meritor North Carolina, founded in
1982, employs 737 workers. Meritor is a leading manufacturer of
commercial vehicle parts and has produced 5.5 million vehicle axles to
date. I'm grateful that Meritor chose to invest in Western North
Carolina.

Greeting North Carolina Veterans in DC
Last weekend, I had the honor and privilege of meeting Vietnam veterans
from North Carolina who traveled to Washington, DC to see the Vietnam
War Memorial. I hope you will take a moment to thank a veteran in your
life for their selfless service to our nation.
