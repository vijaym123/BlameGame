Building our energy future
Dear Friend,
America is experiencing an energy renaissance. Our energy realities have changed dramatically
weve gone from bust to boom practically overnight. Modern technology and American ingenuity have unlocked a wealth of energy resources, and with the right policies, this energy abundance can help fuel our economy for years to come.
However, todays energy policies are lagging far behind. We need policies that meet todays needs and are focused on the future. That starts with building what I call the
Architecture of Abundance.
This broad new energy vision for America is focused on four main areas: modernizing infrastructure, a 21 st
century energy workforce, energy diplomacy, and efficiency and accountability.
Our energy landscape has changed, but our national energy policy has not kept pace. Outdated and inadequate energy policies are preventing us from taking full advantage of Americas energy abundance. Thats why I am committed to pursuing thoughtful, coherent policies that fulfill our energy potential and will allow us to take full advantage of Americas rich energy resources in a safe and responsible way.
By modernizing our infrastructure, empowering a 21 st
Century energy workforce, strengthening our energy diplomacy, and promoting more efficiency and accountability we can lay the foundation for a forward-looking national energy strategy that truly embraces our energy abundance.
Most importantly, saying yes to energy will create good-paying jobs, keep costs down for Michigan families and businesses, and boost our energy security. The time is now to build a broad energy Architecture of Abundance. To learn more about this and other legislative initiatives, please visit my website: upton.house.gov
God bless,
Fred
