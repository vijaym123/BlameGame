The
Presidents Rhetoric
President Obamas
2014 State of the Union address is as memorable for what he didnt say
as what he did.
During the course of his 65-minute speech,
the president didnt mention the phrases national debt or
spending once.
It seems that working with the Congress to get our
fiscal house in order and reduce our $17 trillion debt remains low on the
totem pole for this Administration.
He did mention small
business, but only three times in his 6,778-word address
in three
consecutive sentences of the same paragraph.
These private sector
firms are our economys job generators; yet
economists at one small business group
argue its hard to make the case
that the small business sector has made significant progress in
recent years.
The president also spoke about income
inequality, but failed to mention his own role in making that gap wider.
Five years into his presidency, the labor force participation rate is
at its lowest point since Jimmy Carter was in the White House.
There are four million Americans who have been unemployed for at least
six months, and another eight million Americans working part-time
because they still cannot find a full-time job.
In fact,
precisely because of the presidents policies, its harder to find a
job or start a business.
As the Wall Street
Journal noted , most of his speech tried to address the economic
insecurity that his own policies have done so much to
create.
At the end of the day, the presidents remarks inspire little
confidence that he is prepared to address the critical economic challenges
facing our nation.
