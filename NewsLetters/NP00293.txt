"Helping America's Homeless Youth"
By: Senator Susan Collins
This month, U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julin
Castro accepted my invitation to travel to Maine to see firsthand how
organizations in our state tackle the very important issue of runaway
and youth homelessness. I have worked closely with Secretary Castro on
a number of issues, and he has been a willing and eager partner in our
work together to prevent and end youth homelessness nationwide.
The nearly 195,000 homeless children and teens across our nation
make up approximately one-third of the entire homeless population in
America. More than 45,000 of these children face the danger and despair
of homelessness alone, unaccompanied by a parent or guardian.
As Chairman of the Senate Transportation, Housing, and Urban
Development Appropriations Subcommittee, combatting youth homelessness
in Maine and across the United States continues to be one of my top
priorities. In April, I chaired a hearing that examined HUDs efforts
to help meet our national goal of ending child, youth, and family
homelessness by 2020. Our hearing featured two witnesses who, with the
help of effective programs, overcame homelessness as teens to build
productive lives and to serve others.
The first witness was the award-winning recording artist and
youth homelessness activist, Cyndi Lauper.
The second was Brittany
Dixon of Auburn, an alumni of New Beginnings, an outstanding
Lewiston-based organization that provides emergency services and
transitional living programs for youth throughout Maine. With help of
the resources and dedicated staff at New Beginnings, Brittany has
earned a college degree, supports herself as an educational technician,
and is pursuing her goal of teaching kindergarten.
Secretary Castro and I spend a great deal of time in Washington
pouring over budget numbers and looking at statistics. For this reason,
it was refreshing and important for us to hear directly from people who
are affected by the policy decisions that we make.
One such person was Hailey, age 17, who shared her compelling
story when Secretary Castro and I visited New Beginnings, the only
24-hour licensed shelter for children and teens in Maine.
Hailey was put into foster care at age nine, the first of more
than 25 foster home placements in her young life. As a homeless teen,
she stayed with friends and family, at shelters, and even in places
that were not safe. She faced many obstacles including hunger and a
lack of physical and mental health care.

Senator Collins in Lewiston
>From the Lewiston Sun Journal
Collins: Lewiston shelter helps homeless teens succeed
"A Lewiston-based program that helps homeless young people get off the
street, stay in school and reconnect with their families was in the
spotlight Friday, thanks to U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.
"Collins, along with a top official in President Barack Obama's
Cabinet, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, toured
two of the buildings and learned about the programs offered by New
Beginnings, a nonprofit that is operating the only 24-hour emergency
shelter for teens in Maine.
"Ending homelessness in America by 2020 is a top goal of Obama's
administration, but it has long been on Collins' radar screen. She has
more recently turned her attention to the problem of youth
homelessness.
"New Beginnings, which recently celebrated a 35-year anniversary, and
its programs were being put in the spotlight by Collins in hopes that
some of its programs could be replicated nationally.
...
"During a short tour of the New Beginnings emergency shelter on Main
Street, Collins and Castro spoke with teens and young people to learn
more about how the programming and support has helped them turn their
lives around.
"'It has been truly inspiring to learn about the wonderful work that
New Beginnings is doing for homeless youth in this area; they clearly
are changing lives,' Collins said. 'But it's the young people
themselves who have had the strength, the courage and the determination
to turn their lives around.'
Collins said she was honored to have Castro with her and noted, based
on the best research she and her staff could do, that he was the first
HUD secretary to ever visit Maine.

Senator Collins Announces Senate Appropriations Committee Approval of
$1 billion Toward Additional Destroyer
Senator Collins announced this week that the Senate Appropriations
Committee has approved $1 billion toward the construction of an
additional DDG-51 destroyer.
The funding is part of the 2016 Defense
Appropriations Bill which must now be considered by the full Senate.
If the funding bill becomes law, the additional destroyer would likely
be built at Bath Iron Works.
Our destroyers are the workhorses of the Navy, and I am proud of the
highly skilled, hardworking men and women at Bath Iron Works who
continue to deliver the highest quality ships for our nations
sailors, said Senator Collins.
A member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Collins
requested the funding toward the additional DDG-51 to help meet
combatant commander requirements for destroyers across the globe. As of
January 2015, the Navy had 279 ships, well short of the goal set by the
Navys 30-year shipbuilding plan which calls for the United States to
have 304 ships by 2020. The additional investments in this bill will
grow the Navys shipbuilding capabilities at a time when the Navy fleet
is in high demand to protect national security interests worldwide.
Nearly half of the worlds population lives less than 60 miles from
the sea, and with ninety percent of global trade carried by sea, even
those who live in landlocked areas are dependent on the worlds
oceans, Senator Collins continued. The value and importance of our
naval assets to security and stability have never been greater.

Senator Collins Joins Colleagues in Introducing
Comprehensive Health Care Bill
This week, Senator Collins joined Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D., (R-LA) in
introducing the Patient Freedom Act
, a comprehensive plan to provide states
with the option to reform their health care systems if the Supreme
Court rules in favor of the plaintiffs in the forthcoming King v.
Burwell decision. If the court rules in favor of the plaintiffs,
millions of Americans, including almost 61,000 Mainers, would be at
risk of losing subsidies for health insurance they purchase through the
Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchange.
To watch this clip click here
or the play
button above
Senator Collins believes these Americans can be protected by extending
the current ACA subsidies for a transition period, as called for by
language included in the Patient Freedom Act. States which choose the
Patient Freedom Act option could structure their health insurance
market without many of the expensive mandates in the ACA, as described
in the bill.
In addition, the Patient Freedom Act would fix one of the major flaws
in the ACA by eliminating what the superintendent of insurance in Maine
refers to as wage lock. Because of the way the Affordable Care Act
is written, if an individual earns even one dollar more than 400
percent of the federal poverty level, they could lose their subsidy in
the ACA exchange completely. In other words, the ACA creates a cliff
that can be disastrous for families across the country.
Senator Collins spoke from the Senate floor earlier this week to
highlight the horrific experience of a Maine couple who contacted her
office to share a story just like this.
To their shock, when this
family went to file their taxes, they realized they had earned more
than the cliff put in place by the ACA and they owed $13,000 to the
IRS for the health insurance they received through the ACA exchange.
This was on top of the $4,000 that they had already paid that year for
their insurance premium.
Imagine finding out that because you worked a little harder, because
you earned a bit more money, you now unexpectedly owe an extra $13,000
to the IRS because you lost your subsidy. The Patient Freedom Act would
put an end to the bait-and-switch premiums that are built into the
Obamacare exchanges, Senator Collins stated from the Senate floor.

Happy Birthday Mrs. Bush!
This week, Senator Collins joined friends and members of the Bush
family in Kennebunkport to celebrate Barbara Bush's 90th birthday.
Senate Aging Committee Examines Proliferation of Unwanted Calls
The Senate Special Committee on Aging, led by Chairman Susan Collins,
held a hearing this week titled, Ringing Off the Hook: Examining the
Proliferation of Unwanted Calls.
The Committee examined why so many
individuals who have signed up for the Do Not Call Registry continue
to receive unwanted calls, whether that law should be updated to
reflect changes in technology, and what the government can be doing to
make it more difficult for scammers to reach potential victims, many of
whom are seniors.
>From CBS Evening News
:
"How telemarketers get around the 'Do Not Call' list"
To watch the segment from CBS Evening News click here

"The federal government set up the Do Not Call Registry 12 years ago,
to stop annoying calls from sales people. But they're still getting
through.
"Since 2009, complaints to the Federal Trade Commission have nearly
tripled, from 63,000 a month to 150,000.
...
"Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins said catching scammers has gotten
harder. Many of them operate from overseas call centers, often in
India.
"Using her cell phone, Collins showed how a simple app enables them to
impersonate government agencies, a practice known as 'spoofing.'

"Helping
America's
Homeless
Youth"
By:
Senator
Susan
Collins
This
month,
U.S.
Housing
and
Urban
Development
(HUD)
Secretary
Juli&#225;n
Castro
accepted
my
invitation
to
travel
to
Maine
to
see
firsthand
how
organizations
in
our
state
tackle
the
very
important
issue
of
runaway
and
youth
homelessness.
I
have
worked
closely
with
Secretary
Castro
on
a
number
of
issues,
and
he
has
been
a
willing
and
eager
partner
in
our
work
together
to
prevent
and
end
youth
homelessness
nationwide.
The
nearly
195,000
homeless
children
and
teens
across
our
nation
make
up
approximately
one-third
of
the
entire
homeless
population
in
America.
More
than
45,000
of
these
children
face
the
danger
and
despair
of
homelessness
alone,
unaccompanied
by
a
parent
or
guardian.
As
Chairman
of
the
Senate
Transportation,
Housing,
and
Urban

Appropriations
Subcommittee,
combatting
youth
homelessness
in
Maine
and
across
the
United
States
continues
to
be
one
of
my
top
priorities.
In
April,
I
chaired
a
hearing
that
examined
HUD&#146;s
efforts
to
help
meet
our
national
goal
of
ending
child,
youth,
and
family
homelessness
by
2020.
Our
hearing
featured
two
witnesses
who,
with
the
help
of
effective
programs,
overcame
homelessness
as
teens
to
build
productive
lives
and
to
serve
others.
The
first
witness
was
the
award-winning
recording

and
youth
homelessness

Cyndi

The
second
was
Brittany
Dixon
of

an
alumni
of
New

an
outstanding
Lewiston-based
organization
that
provides
emergency
services
and
transitional
living

for
youth
throughout
Maine.
With
help
of
the
resources
and
dedicated
staff
at
New

Brittany
has
earned
a
college
degree,
supports
herself
as
an
educational
technician,
and
is
pursuing
her
goal
of
teaching
kindergarten.
Secretary
Castro
and
I
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
in
Washington
pouring
over
budget
numbers
and
looking
at
statistics.
For
this
reason,
it
was
refreshing
and

for
us
to
hear

from
people
who
are
affected
by
the
policy

One

was
Hailey,
age
17,
who

when
Secretary
Castro
and
I
visited
New
Beginnings,
the
only
24-hour
licensed

for

Hailey
was
put
into
foster
care
at
age
nine,
the
first
of
more
than
25
foster
home
placements
in
her
young
life.
As
a
homeless
teen,
she
stayed
with
friends
and
family,
at
shelters,
and
even
in
places
that
were
not
safe.
She
faced
many
obstacles
including
hunger
and
a
lack
of
physical
and
mental
health
care.

Collins:
Lewiston
shelter

"A

Friday,
thanks
to
U.S.
Sen.
Susan
Collins,
R-Maine.
"Collins,
along
with
a
top
official
in
President
Barack
Obama's
Cabinet,
Housing
and
Urban
Development
Secretary
Julian
Castro,
toured
two
of
the
buildings
and
learned
about
the
programs
offered
by
New
Beginnings,
a
nonprofit
that
is
operating
the
only
24-hour
emergency
shelter
for
teens
in
Maine.
"Ending
homelessness
in
America
by
2020
is
a
top

of
Obama's

but
it
has
long
been

She

....
"During
a
short
tour
of
the

Collins

wonderful
work

Senator
Collins
Announces
Senate
Appropriations
Committee
Approval
of
$1
billion
Toward
Additional
Destroyer
Senator
Collins
announced
this
week
that
the
Senate
Appropriations
Committee
has
approved
$1
billion
toward
the
construction
of
an
additional
DDG-51
destroyer.
The
funding
is
part
of
the
2016
Defense
Appropriations
Bill
which
must
now
be
considered
by
the
full
Senate.
If
the
funding
bill
becomes
law,
the
additional
destroyer
would
likely
be
built
at
Bath
Iron
Works.
&#147;Our
destroyers
are
the
workhorses
of
the
Navy,
and
I
am
proud
of
the
highly
skilled,
hardworking
men
and
women
at
Bath
Iron
Works
who
continue
to
deliver
the
highest
quality
ships
for
our
nation&#146;s
sailors,&#148;
said
Senator
Collins.
A
member
of
the
Defense
Appropriations
Subcommittee,
Senator
Collins
requested
the
funding
toward
the
additional
DDG-51
to
help
meet
combatant
commander
requirements
for
destroyers
across
the
globe. As
of
January
2015,
the
Navy
had
279
ships,
well
short
of
the
goal
set
by
the
Navy&#146;s
30-year
shipbuilding
plan
which
calls
for
the
United
States
to
have
304
ships
by
2020.
The
additional
investments
in
this
bill
will
grow
the
Navy&#146;s
shipbuilding
capabilities
at
a
time
when
the
Navy
fleet
is
in
high
demand
to
protect
national
security
interests
worldwide.
&#147;Nearly
half
of
the
world&#146;s
population
lives
less
than
60
miles
from
the
sea,
and
with
ninety
percent
of
global
trade
carried
by
sea,
even
those
who
live
in
landlocked
areas
are
dependent
on
the
world&#146;s
oceans,&#148;
Senator
Collins
continued.
&#147;The
value
and
importance
of
our
naval
assets
to
security
and
stability
have
never
been
greater.&#148;

Senator

believes
these

can
be
protected
by
extending
the
current
ACA
subsidies
for
a
transition
period,
as
called
for
by
language
included

by
eliminating

Because

completely.
In
other
words,
the
ACA
creates
a

disastrous
for
families
across
the
country.
Senator
Collins
spoke
from
the
Senate
floor
earlier
this
week
to
highlight
the
horrific
experience
of
a
Maine
couple
who
contacted
her
office
to
share
a
story
just
like
this.
To
their
shock,
when
this
family
went
to
file
their
taxes,
they
realized
they
had
earned
more
than
the
&#145;cliff&#146;
put
in
place
by
the
ACA
and
they
owed
$13,000
to
the
IRS
for
the
health
insurance
they
received
through
the
ACA
exchange.
This
was
on
top
of
the
$4,000
that
they
had
already
paid
that
year
for
their
insurance
premium.
&#147;Imagine
finding
out
that
because
you
worked
a
little
harder,
because
you
earned
a
bit
more
money,
you
now
unexpectedly
owe
an
extra
$13,000
to
the
IRS
because
you
lost
your
subsidy.
The
Patient
Freedom
Act
would
put
an
end
to
the
bait-and-switch

Hook:
Examining
the
Proliferation
of
Unwanted
Calls. &#148;
The
Committee
examined
why
so
many
individuals
who
have
signed
up
for
the
&#147;Do
Not
Call
Registry&#148;
continue
to
receive
unwanted
calls,
whether
that
law
should
be
updated
to
reflect
changes
in
technology,
and
what
the
government
can
be
doing
to
make
it
more
difficult
for
scammers
to
reach
potential
victims,
many
of
whom
are
seniors .

"The
federal
government
set
up
the
Do
Not
Call
Registry
12
years
ago,
to
stop
annoying
calls
from
sales
people.
But
they're
still
getting
through.
"Since
2009,
complaints
to
the
Federal
Trade
Commission
have
nearly
tripled,
from
63,000
a
month
to
150,000.
....
"Maine
Republican
Sen.
Susan
Collins
said
catching
scammers
has
gotten
harder.
Many
of
them
operate
from
overseas
call
centers,
often
in
India.
"Using
her
cell
phone,
Collins
showed
how
a
simple
app
enables
them
to
impersonate
government
agencies,
a
practice
known
as
'spoofing.'
