Dear Fellow Coloradan,
Small businesses are the cornerstone of our local economies and the embodiment of the American dream. Colorado&rsquo;s small businesses create thousands of home-grown jobs and are the primary engine of our economic growth. From Durango to Greeley and Lamar to Craig, these Main Street businesses support good-paying jobs, sustain middle class families, and reinforce that entrepreneurial spirit which encourages the best and brightest to set up shop right here in Colorado.
This Saturday, Nov. 30 is Small Business Saturday &mdash; a day dedicated to supporting our local small businesses on one of the busiest shopping weekends of the year. Small Business Saturday is also an opportunity to support our friends, families and neighbors who work tirelessly every day to keep their businesses and our communities running strong.
Do you know an outstanding small business in your community?
I&rsquo;d love to hear about it .
From the restaurants that line Main Street in Grand Junction to the Old Colorado City shops in Colorado Springs, Colorado small businesses have something for everyone. I&rsquo;ve met many small business owners throughout our state, and they never cease to impress me with their innovative drive and that ever-present Western spirit of strength and independence.
Recently, for example, I visited Hester&rsquo;s Log and Lumber sawmill in Kremmling, a small business that the Hester family has owned and operated for 26 years. And on a visit to Pueblo I dropped by Hopscotch Bakery, where local residents can find homemade cakes and sandwiches.
I hope you will join me in pledging to support Colorado small business owners and participate in Small Business Saturday. For more information about Small Business Saturday and participating businesses near you,
visit the Small Business Saturday website .
From slashing red tape and ensuring entrepreneurs have the access to credit they need to grow, I have continually fought in Washington to keep our small businesses strong. I hope you will stand with me and support the small businesses that are helping Colorado win the global economic race.
Warm regards,
Offices
