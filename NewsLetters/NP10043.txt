Dear Friend,
I successfully passed four amendments on Wednesday that will bring
accountability to the Department of Veterans Affairs and improve
veterans' health care. Ensuring timely care for our veterans is one of
my top priorities, so I was appalled to hear recent reports about
neglect, and even malfeasance, at the VA in terms of treating sick
veterans. As I told you in a previous newsletter, the House Veterans
Affairs Committee is conducting an investigation into the matter and so
far has found that as many as 40 veterans may have died waiting for
treatment at the Phoenix VA. These amendments will prevent such
atrocities from occurring again, will increase transparency and, most
importantly, will ensure our nation's heroes receive critical health
care.
Specifically, these amendments prohibit the VA from keeping unofficial
records in order to conceal lengthy wait times; cut bureaucratic waste
at the VA and redirect those resources toward reducing wait times;
prohibit bonuses for senior VA officials; and ensure adequate funding
for the investigation of the Phoenix VA. Click HERE
or below to
watch my remarks on the house floor about the importance of one of
these amendments.
Our veterans fought to protect us and our freedoms. The least we can do
for them now is make sure they receive the health care they earned.

A Select Committee for Benghazi
Yesterday, House leadership announced that they will hold a vote on
establishing a select committee on the September 11, 2012 terrorist
attacks in Benghazi. Congress has been investigating these terrorist
attacks for almost two years but the Obama administration's
stonewalling and refusal to release pertinent information has left us
no option but to create a select committee. It's ridiculous that we
have to create a select committee in the first place but the
administration is more interested in covering their own a**es and
protecting the President than telling the American people the truth.
Several unanswered questions remain, such as "What was the President
doing while the consulate was under attack? Why did he not take action
or issue any specific orders? Why did Hillary Clinton refuse to ask the
military for assistance? Why was Susan Rice sent out to lie about the
causes of the attack instead of Secretary Clinton? Why did the
President repeat this lie long after it was exposed? What is Jay
Carney's role in fabricating the Internet-video lie?" and "What other
documents have been withheld from Congress?"
On Thursday, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, of which
I am a member, held a hearing on Benghazi. Click HERE
to watch me
questioning witnesses at the hearing.
I'm proud that over a year ago I co-sponsored H.Res.36 calling for a
select committee on Benghazi. The House Oversight Committee and I, in
our role as the chief watchdog body in Congress, have continued to push
for justice on this matter through multiple oversight hearings. I'm
pleased that House leadership has finally recognized the importance of
this issue and have announced they will schedule a vote to establish a
select committee on Benghazi.
I am committed to uncovering the whole truth about what happened in
Benghazi and to holding the Obama administration accountable for the
lack of a response and the subsequent cover up. Americans and the
families of the four brave men who died in Benghazi deserve the whole
truth, not the lies spewed by the administration.
Cutting Waste
As you know, one of my top priorities is eliminating waste fraud and
abuse in the federal government. On Thursday, the House passed two of
my policies that cut needless spending and prevent hard-earned taxpayer
money from being wasted on a costly vegetative roof and on completely
unnecessary life-size printings of photographs. At a time of soaring
deficits and with a federal debt in excess of $17 trillion, such
expenditures are especially wasteful. We have a responsibility to
future generations to put this country on a fiscally sustainable path,
which is why I'll continue to cut wasteful spending wherever I can find
it in the bloated federal government. Click HERE

Bringing Transparency to the Endangered Species Act
I co-sponsored four commonsense bills this week that increase
transparency, save taxpayer money, ensure local involvement in species
conservation and the designation process, limit the hourly rate
attorneys can charge the taxpayers for Endangered Species Act lawsuits
and require the federal government to make available to Congress and
the public any data it uses to determine which species to list as
endangered. These bills address serious deficiencies in the Endangered
Species Act.
For far too long, the federal government has been making listing
decisions based on secret science and pseudo-science, including studies
that do not allow for peer-review of the underlying data. Even more
troubling is the fact that attorneys have been making millions of
dollars based on frivolous lawsuits associated with the Endangered
Species Act and that the federal government doesn't even know how much
money has been paid out. The government shouldn't have anything to hide
if these listings are indeed based on the best available science and
there should be local involvement in this process. Most importantly,
attorneys shouldn't be getting rich at the expense of hardworking
taxpayers. Click HERE

Importance of a Skilled Workforce
I questioned Mike Rowe, former host of the Discovery Channel's Dirty
Jobs, at a Natural Resources Committee hearing on Tuesday about the
importance of a skilled workforce. Skilled trades jobs are essential
for ensuring America's energy future. Unfortunately, many of these
high-paying jobs are left unfilled because we don't have the skilled
workforce to fill them. I was pleased to have the opportunity to
discuss this problem with former Dirty Jobs host Mike Rowe. He provided
some valuable insights for addressing this problem moving forward.

Dear

I
successfully passed
four
amendments
on
Wednesday
that will
bring
accountability
to
the
Department
of
Veterans

and
improve
veterans'
health

to
hear
recent
reports
about

at
the

As
I
told
you
in
a
previous
newsletter,
the
House
Veterans

Committee
is
conducting
an
investigation
into
the
matter
and
so
far
has
found
that
as
many
as
40
veterans
may
have
died
waiting
for
treatment
at
the
Phoenix
VA. These
amendments will
prevent
such
atrocities
from
occurring
again,
will
increase
transparency
and,
most
importantly,
will
ensure
our
nation's
heroes

A
Select
Committee
for
Benghazi
Yesterday,
House
leadership
announced
that
they
will
hold
a
vote
on
establishing
a
select
committee
on
the
September
11,
2012
terrorist
attacks
in
Benghazi.
Congress
has
been
investigating
these
terrorist
attacks for
almost
two
years
but
the
Obama
administration's
stonewalling
and
refusal
to
release
pertinent
information
has
left
us
no
option
but
to
create
a
select
committee.
It's
ridiculous
that
we
have
to
create
a
select
committee
in
the
first
place
but
the
administration
is
more
interested
in
covering
their
own
a**es
and
protecting
the
President
than
telling
the
American
people
the
truth.
Several
unanswered
questions
remain,
such
as
"What
was
the
President
doing
while
the
consulate
was
under
attack?
Why
did
he
not
take
action
or
issue
any
specific
orders?
Why
did
Hillary
Clinton
refuse
to
ask
the
military
for
assistance?
Why
was
Susan
Rice
sent
out
to
lie
about
the
causes
of
the
attack
instead
of
Secretary
Clinton?
Why
did
the
President
repeat
this
lie
long
after
it
was
exposed?
What
is
Jay
Carney's
role
in
fabricating
the
Internet-video
lie?"
and
"What
other
documents
have
been
withheld
from
Congress?"
On
Thursday,
the
Committee
on
Oversight
and
Government
Reform,
of
which
I
am
a
member,
held
a
hearing
on
Benghazi.
Click
HERE
to
watch
me
questioning
witnesses
at
the
hearing.
I'm
proud
that
over
a
year
ago
I
co-sponsored
H.Res.36
calling
for
a
select
committee
on
Benghazi.
The
House
Oversight
Committee
and
I,
in
our
role
as
the
chief
watchdog
body
in
Congress,
have
continued
to
push
for
justice
on
this
matter
through
multiple
oversight
hearings.
I'm
pleased
that
House
leadership
has
finally
recognized
the
importance
of
this
issue
and
have
announced
they
will
schedule
a
vote
to
establish
a
select
committee
on
Benghazi.
I
am
committed
to
uncovering
the
whole
truth
about
what
happened
in
Benghazi
and
to
holding
the
Obama
administration
accountable
for
the
lack
of
a
response
and
the
subsequent
cover
up.
Americans
and
the
families
of
the
four
brave
men
who
died
in
Benghazi
deserve
the
whole
truth,
not
the
lies
spewed
by
the
administration.
Cutting
Waste
As
you
know,
one
of
my
top
priorities
is
eliminating
waste
fraud
and
abuse in
the
federal
government. On
Thursday,
the
House
passed
two
of
my
policies
that
cut
needless
spending
and
prevent
hard-earned
taxpayer
money
from
being
wasted
on
a
costly
vegetative
roof
and
on
completely
unnecessary
life-size
printings
of
photographs.
At
a
time
of
soaring
deficits
and
with
a
federal
debt
in
excess
of
$17
trillion,
such
expenditures
are
especially
wasteful.
We
have
a
responsibility
to
future
generations
to
put
this
country
on
a
fiscally
sustainable
path,
which
is
why
I'll
continue
to
cut
wasteful
spending
wherever
I
can
find
it
in
the
bloated
federal
government.

Bringing
Transparency
to
the
Endangered
Species
Act
I
co-sponsored
four
commonsense
bills
this
week
that increase
transparency,
save
taxpayer
money,
ensure
local
involvement
in
species
conservation
and
the
designation
process,
limit
the
hourly
rate
attorneys
can
charge
the
taxpayers
for
Endangered
Species
Act
lawsuits
and
require
the
federal
government
to
make
available
to
Congress
and
the
public
any
data
it
uses
to
determine
which
species
to
list
as
endangered.
These
bills
address
serious
deficiencies
in
the
Endangered
Species
Act.
For
far
too
long,
the
federal
government
has
been
making
listing
decisions
based
on
secret
science
and
pseudo-science,
including
studies
that
do
not
allow
for
peer-review
of
the
underlying
data.
Even
more
troubling
is
the
fact
that
attorneys
have
been
making
millions
of
dollars
based
on
frivolous
lawsuits
associated
with
the
Endangered
Species
Act
and
that
the
federal
government
doesn&#8217;t
even
know
how
much
money
has
been
paid
out.
The
government
shouldn't
have
anything
to
hide
if
these
listings
are
indeed
based
on
the
best
available
science
and
there
should
be
local
involvement
in
this
process.
Most
importantly,
attorneys
shouldn't
be
getting
rich
at
the
expense
of
hardworking
taxpayers.
