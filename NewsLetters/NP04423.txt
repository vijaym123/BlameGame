Ensuring DoD cleans up properties it contaminates
With increasing military activity in the Northern Mariana Islands I want to be sure that the Defense Department is always responsible for cleaning up after itself. That is why I support Section 316 of S. 2410,
the Senate version of this years National Defense Authorization Act. Section 316 authorizes Defense to clean up areas it has used, even if no longer under military control. This is the situation on the island of Culebra. The military left behind unexploded ordnance on the island when it conveyed the property to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and now refuses to fund a cleanup of this public hazard. So, I joined 29 other Members of Congress in a letter to the leadership of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees
asking them to keep Section 316 when House and Senate conferees hammer out a final version of the 2015 Defense bill. Section 316 gives DOD authority to fund a cleanup and makes clear that is what Congress wants the military to do.

Elected as Region II Democratic Whip for the 114th Congress
The 21 members of Region II of the Democratic Caucus re-elected me as a Regional Whip today. Region II covers Northern California, Hawaii, and the Pacific islands and includes Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi among its members. The vote was unanimous. The role of the Whip is to count how Region members intend to vote on key legislation, so that our House leadership has an idea whether a bill will pass or fail before a vote is taken on the floor. I particularly appreciate being a part of this process even though I cannot vote on the floor; and I always include the Guam and American Samoan Members who have the same limit. Making sure that the leadership knows how we would vote is a good reminder that any new law will affect the people of the insular areas just as it does Americans living anywhere else in our nation.

Harvard professor and now Science Advisor to President Obama John Holdren is available to answer your questions about climate change. Anyone can submit a question via Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or Vine and DrH will reply to some of them on camera for you.
White House scientist can answer your climate change questions
Rising sea levels that wash away beaches, ocean acidification that destroys coral reefs, more intense storms that overwhelm drainage systems and flood our streets
these are some of the problems that climate change brings to our islands and coastal areas throughout the world. To keep people informed and answer questions you may have the Obama administration has set up a Q&A; system using social media. Ask your question on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or Vine, using the hashtag #AskDrH, and the Presidents Science Advisor, Dr. John Holdren, will respond to as many as he can.

Changes to veterans benefits could affect NMI
Veterans and families of veterans should be aware of two changes to GI Bill education benefits that are now going into effect:
*
Section 701 of the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act passed by Congress earlier this year expands the Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship to include the surviving spouses of Servicemembers who died in the line of duty after September 10, 2001. Prior to this law, only children of those who died in the line of duty were eligible for this benefit. Eligible spouses will be entitled to up to 36 months of the full, 100% level of the Post-9/11 GI Bill, which includes the tuition and fee payment, a monthly housing allowance, and a books and supplies stipend.
*
Section 702 of the new law requires the Veterans Administration to disapprove programs of education under the Post-9/11 GI Bill and Montgomery GI Bill
Active Duty at public institutions of higher learning if the school charges qualifying Veterans and dependents tuition and fees in excess of the rate for resident students for terms beginning after July 1, 2015. This provision should have the effect of forcing public colleges and universities to offer resident tuition to anyone covered by the GI bills.
