Dear
Friend,
This week during the 52 nd
National Police Week, we honor
those law enforcement officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice as
well as the family, friends, and fellow officers left behind. There is
never an adequate way to thank those whose service supports our
collective freedoms, but it is our duty to honor their memory in every way
that we can.
Two of Utahs finest will be added to the
National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington DC this year:
Sergeant Derek Johnson (End of Watch: September 1 st , 2013) and
Officer Thomas Jackson (End of Watch: February 6 th , 1911)
whose name is being added retroactively. Dedicated on October 15,
1991, the Memorial honors devoted federal, state and local law enforcement
officers who protect our nation and its people.
In this
time of remembrance, we also recognize our law enforcement officers who
risk their lives daily for our safety.
This sacrifice is
exemplified by those like Sergeant Cory Wride, who lost his life in the line
of duty this year.
In the United States,
approximately 765,000 law enforcement
officers
put their lives on the line everyday to provide for our
safety and protection.
As a member of the Congressional Law
Enforcement Caucus, I work with representatives on both sides of the aisle to
provide an open forum to address issues affecting the law enforcement
community.
I have long supported supplemental funding for law
enforcement, including the Department of Justices Community Oriented
Policing Services (COPS) grants, which help local police departments hire
additional personnel and develop community policing programs, as well
as the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program, which helps
develop best practices among our nations law enforcement agencies.
Programs like these are critically important and allow state and local
police forces to fight crime more efficiently and effectively in our
communities.
I am honored to serve in Congress on behalf of
Utah families like yours. As your representative, I always appreciate
hearing from you on current topics and issues affecting you and our
community.
Please
let me
know
areas you find especially interesting or where I can provide you with
additional information.
I value your ideas and look forward to
hearing from you.
Sincerely,
U.S.
Representative
4th District of
Utah
