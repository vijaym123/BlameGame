A Message from Representative Sean Duffy
May 4, 2014
Dear friends,
Paul Bunyan is a larger-than-life folk hero who embodies frontier
vitality. He is a symbol of might, the willingness to work hard, and
the resolve to overcome all obstacles.
This year we are announcing the "The Paul Bunyan Service Above Self"
Award to recognize, annually, a resident of the 7th Congressional
District who is "larger-than-life." The award serves as a way to thank
an individual who goes above and beyond to serve our community and
improve the quality of life for those around them.
Our Seventh District community is home to many individuals who, like
Paul Bunyan and the lumberjack pioneers who settled Northern Wisconsin,
are larger-than-life. These individuals are willing to extend a helping
hand to those in need and make our community some of the best places to
live in the country and the world. They have given far more than they
have received and this award is a small way we can recognize them and
thank them for all they have given to our community.
To nominate a resident of Wisconsin's 7th Congressional District for a
"Paul Bunyan Service Above Self" Award, please complete the "Paul
Bunyan Service Above Self" Award Nomination Form
and submit it
with a photo of the resident you are nominating by email to
jesse.garza@mail.house.gov
or by
mail to 208 Grand Ave, Wausau, WI 54403, Attn: Paul Bunyan Service
Award.
Please call 715-298-9344 if you have any questions.
Nominations should be submitted by May 30, 2014 to be considered. The
winner will be announced in conjunction with National Paul Bunyan Day,
June 28, 2014.
A tribute to a man of service and hero to our community: This week I
had the distinct privilege of offering tribute to a well-respected hero
in our community, Polk County Deputy Sheriff Michael Severson. Click on
the image to watch:
Deputy Severson was shot in the spine after confronting a suspect who
committed a violent act in Chisago City, Minnesota. His injuries left
him paralyzed from the neck down and the suspect also took the life of
his partner, Deputy Allen Albee.
For 23 years following the tragedy, Deputy Severson persevered despite
the challenges he faced with paralysis. The bravery, selflessness, and
sacrifice he not only made that day but also for the rest of his life
is that of a hero.
Thank you to all of the men and women who dedicate their lives to
growing and enriching our community and ensuring that it remains one of
the best places in the country to call home. Also, thank you for
allowing me to represent this great place in Congress. Until next week.
Have a great week,
Sean
