DONATIONS NOW 4X-MATCHED With the election tomorrow, we are opening an emergency 4X-MATCH to help us reach our vote goals. Quadruple Matched Donations Remaining:
David -- We know you might be wondering why you are getting so many fundraising emails the day before an election. Well, here is how we&rsquo;re using your donations right now:
We&rsquo;ve registered 8O,OOO new voters
We&rsquo;ve knocked on over 6 MILLION doors
We&rsquo;ve called more than 32 MILLION voters
That&rsquo;s huge. Seriously -- unprecedented. But there is still so much to do if we are going to upset Boehner and Romney's big predictions.
This only way we can Get Out The Vote in the final critical hours is through donations from our best supporters. David, donate $5 or more right now while your contribution can still be quadruple-matched.
