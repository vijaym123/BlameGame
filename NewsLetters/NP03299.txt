Friend,
Thanks to the Citizens United ruling 5 years ago, corporate special interests are allowed to spend unlimited amounts of money in our elections to drown out the voices of the American people.
Last year, they flooded our district with millions of dollars in an attempt to buy the election--in fact, we were successful in the most expensive House race in the country. Thankfully, I had the support of an incredible grassroots team that propelled us to victory.
With an unlimited war chest, these conservative special interest groups are going to try to buy this seat once again. Karl Rove and Speaker Boehner&#39;s political arm has already started to prepare for the 2016 elections-- and it&#39;s critical they don&#39;t gain a huge head start.
We can&#39;t afford to fall behind so we&#39;ve officially kicked off our 2016 campaign. Will you be one of the first 100 people to stand with us in 2016 with a $5 contribution today?

Starting off with a strong campaign will make those special interest groups-- and potential self-funding opponents-- think twice. Let&#39;s show them once again that special interest money is no match for our grassroots support.
Be well,
Ami
