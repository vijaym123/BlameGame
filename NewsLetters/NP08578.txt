Rep. Bob Goodlatte
Keeping Internet Access Tax Free
Few people study their telephone and Internet bills closely, but it might be worth taking
a second glance next month.
Take a close look at your next phone bill, and at the bottom you will see a laundry list of access taxes.
But if you
look at your Internet service provider&rsquo;s bill, those access taxes will be missing. Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to keep it that way?
On
Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee approved a bill that would keep your Internet access tax free.
The
Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act
(PITFA) , which I introduced in September, would make permanent provisions of a bill passed in 1998, the
Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) ,
that temporarily bans states from taxing Internet access or placing multiple or discriminatory taxes on e-commerce.
The
Internet Tax Freedom
Act
has been extended three times since it was first enacted, but it will expire on November 1, 2014, if Congress does not act.
My legislation
permanently ensures that access to the Internet is not burdened by unnecessary costs and that Americans can continue to access the Internet tax
free.
Today&rsquo;s Internet
connects communities in the Sixth District with people throughout the United States and across the globe. It is the greatest gateway to knowledge and
information that has ever existed.
Many folks rely on access to the Internet to continue educational opportunities, apply for employment, run
businesses, monitor bank accounts, and communicate with family and friends.
This tool has transformed our economy and how we live our lives each day.
For most families and
businesses, the last thing they want to see is the puzzling array of taxes on their phone bills repeated on their Internet service bills. More than
225 Members of the U.S. House of Representatives have already signed on as cosponsors of my bill. Instead of applying a band-aid fix every few years
to further extend the tax ban, I hope the House will swiftly take up the
Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act
to provide a lasting solution.

Responding to the Surge of Children at SW Border
Earlier today, the Obama
Administration announced that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will expand the number of family detention beds and send trial attorneys
and immigration judges to the border to address the sudden surge of children, teenagers, and families seeking to enter the United States
illegally.
President Obama&rsquo;s plan to deal with the crisis at the border created by his Administration&rsquo;s bad
immigration policies is nothing but smoke and mirrors. Many of the children, teenagers, and adults arriving at the border are able to game our asylum
and immigration laws because the Obama Administration has severely weakened them and many thousands have already been released into the interior of
the United States. What does President Obama plan to do with those who have already been released from custody?
If President Obama really wants to fix this problem, he should
implement real solutions, such as enforcing our immigration laws, reversing his policies that created this mess in the first place, and proposing
urgently needed legislative fixes. But unfortunately, he is using deceptive tactics to make it appear that he is doing something when he actually
isn&rsquo;t.
On Wednesday,
June 25th at 2:00 p.m., the House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on this issue, entitled
&ldquo;An Administration-Made Disaster: The South Texas Border Surge of
Unaccompanied Minors.&rdquo;
It will be streamed online
here . I will keep you updated on the latest
information.
