Dear Friend:
I wanted to alert you
to a new project in the Bronx that recently received federal funding.
On the Grand Concourse and nearby streets, the Department of
Transportation will soon be installing wayfinding stationsbetween
138 th
and 170 th
Streets.
These stations help people
orient themselves and find nearby amenities and locations. An example
of one is pictured below.
I was proud to help secure
$750,000 in federal funds for this project in the Bronx, which will help
visitors and residents alike find their way through our great borough. The
Grand Concourse is a world class avenue, and this program will make
it even better. These stations have already been installed in
Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens over the past year.
In
Washington, I constantly look for ways to secure funds and direct federal
programs to help improve the Bronx, from new housing opportunities to
transportation infrastructure to childrens programs and beyond. Our
borough has many needs, and our federal government can help. Should you
ever need help with a federal agency, please do not hesitate to contact
my office.
Like you, I look forward to seeing these new
wayfinding stations in coming months. In the meantime, I send you my
best wishes for a happy and healthy New
Year.
Sincerely,
Congressman Jos E. Serrano
