David -- This just completely BLINDSIDED us:
Republicans just launched an enormous $1.8 million ad buy. And they&rsquo;re blanketing a whopping 76(!) key districts. We were NOT expecting this.
This ad blitz is a MAJOR hit to President Obama&rsquo;s agenda.
It calls for an END to Obamacare -- while giving tax breaks to billionaires.
David -- President Obama&rsquo;s entire agenda is at stake. We have nowhere else to turn.
