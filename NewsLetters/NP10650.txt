Dear Friend,
Just like you budget for your family each year, Congress must do the
same for the nation.
However, when Congress creates the federal
budget, it is more than crunching numbers - it's a vision for America.
It should put certainty in our nation's economic future and put people
on the path for success. It should invest and help Americans prosper
towards the infrastructure of opportunity.
Through our work in Congress, we must remain mindful that hard-working
Americans are protected and ensure measures that improve and expand
opportunities for folks are safeguarded.
We should not make it harder
for people to prosper by cutting vital resources like job training or
small business support or by gutting student loans and Pell grants,
making it more difficult to pay for college classes and textbooks.
This week, the House passed a budget with only Republican support that
outlines their idea for America's future.
I believe this budget is
flawed in its vision for how we should fund the government.
This
so-called "Ryan Budget" makes it harder for folks to provide for
themselves and their families by:
*	Cutting $732 billion from Medicaid and other health programs
which would harm our most vulnerable folks.
*	Total repeal of the Affordable Care Act, even though more than
10 million Americans have gotten health insurance through the law.
*	Pushing up to 170,000 vulnerable children out of Head Start -
and pull the rug out from under as many as 3.4 million disadvantaged
students and 8,000 schools.
*	Rejects extending the Emergency Unemployment Compensation which
is costing 200,000 jobs this year.
During the debate over the Ryan budget, I discussed how the bill makes
college less affordable for millions of students, especially those who
receive Pell grants.
Investing in education is one of the surest ways
to strengthen the economy and ensure the United States stays
competitive in this increasingly global economy. I discussed how
devastating cuts to education will be. Watch here:
College Student Twitter Town Hall #Umatter
Cutting access to higher education is cutting access to the middle
class. The Ryan budget makes college more expensive for the millions of
students who rely on Pell grants, federal student loans, and higher
education tax credits to finance their education.
I hosted a
conversation on Twitter with college students from Texas and across the
country to encourage them to get involved with their government and to
discuss how the Ryan budget affects college affordability.
Students tweeted their concerns and questions regarding the devastating
cuts to education. Here are some examples:
*	Making college more expensive for needy students by charging
interest on their loans while they are still in college.
According to
the Congressional Budget Office, students borrowing $23,000 in
subsidized loans will leave school owing an additional $3,800 in
accrued interest.
*	Cuts to Pell grants for low- and moderate-income students by up
to $125 billion through such means as freezing the maximum grant and
kicking part-time students off from receiving Pell grants.
*	Letting higher education tax cuts expire including the American
Opportunity Tax Credit which helps defray college costs for 11.5
million working- and middle-class students by an average of more than
$1,100 each year.
I remain committed to working with my colleagues in Congress to ensure
that we do not balance the budget on the backs of hard-working folks or
students.
We must have a budget that increases opportunities for folks
by promotes economic growth, supports job creation, and invests in
education to ensure it is affordable and accessible for students. We
must continue to strive for our nation to be the land of opportunity
for generations to come.
Sincerely,
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
Just
like
you
budget
for
your
family
each
year,
Congress
must
do
the
same
for
the
nation.
However,
w hen
Congress
creates
the
federal
budget,
it
is
more
than
crunching
numbers
&#8211;
it&#8217;s
a
vision
for
America.
It
should
put
certainty
in
our
nation&#8217;s
economic
future
and
put
people
on
the
path
for
success. It
should
invest
and
help
Americans
prosper
towards
the
infrastructure
of
opportunity.
Through
our
work
in
Congress,
we
must
remain
mindful
that
hard-working
Americans
are
protected
and
ensure
measures
that
improve
and
expand
opportunities
for
folks
are
safeguarded.
We
should
not
make
it
harder
for
people
to
prosper
by
cutting
vital
resources
like
job
training
or
small
business
support
or
by
gutting
student
loans
and
Pell
grants,
making
it
more
difficult
to
pay
for
college
classes
and
textbooks.
This
week,
the
House
passed
a
budget
with
only
Republican
support
that
outlines
their
idea
for
America&#8217;s
future.
I
believe
this
budget
is
flawed
in
its
vision
for
how
we
should
fund
the
government.
This
so-called
&#8220;Ryan
Budget&#8221;
makes
it
harder
for
folks
to
provide
for
themselves
and
their
families
by:
Cutting
$732
billion
from
Medicaid
and
other
health
programs
which
would
harm
our
most
vulnerable
folks. Total
repeal
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act,
even
though
more
than
10
million
Americans
have
gotten
health
insurance
through
the
law. Pushing
up
to
170,000
vulnerable
children
out
of
Head
Start
&#8211;
and
pull
the
rug
out
from
under
as
many
as
3.4
million
disadvantaged
students
and
8,000
schools. Rejects
extending
the
Emergency
Unemployment
Compensation
which
is
costing
200,000
jobs
this
year.
During
the
debate
over
the
Ryan
budget,
I
discussed
how
the
bill
makes
college
less
affordable
for
millions
of
students,
especially
those
who
receive
Pell
grants.
Investing
in
education
is
one
of
the
surest
ways
to
strengthen
the
economy
and
ensure
the
United
States
stays
competitive
in
this
increasingly
global
economy.
I
discussed
how
devastating
cuts
to
education
will
be.
Watch
here:
College
Student
Twitter
Town
Hall
#Umatter
Cutting
access
to
higher
education
is
cutting
access
to
the
middle
class.
The
Ryan
budget
makes
college
more
expensive
for
the
millions
of
students
who
rely
on
Pell
grants,
federal
student
loans,
and
higher
education
tax
credits
to
finance
their
education.
I
hosted
a
conversation
on
Twitter
with
college
students
from
Texas
and
across
the
country
to
encourage
them
to
get
involved
with
their
government
and
to
discuss
how
the
Ryan
budget
affects
college
affordability.
Students
tweeted
their
concerns
and
questions
regarding
the
devastating
cuts
to
education.
Here
are
some
examples:
Making
college
more
expensive
for
needy
students
by
charging
interest
on
their
loans
while
they
are
still
in
college .
According
to
the
Congressional
Budget
Office,
students
borrowing
$23,000
in
subsidized
loans
will
leave
school
owing
an
additional
$3,800
in
accrued
interest.
Cuts
to
Pell
grants
for
low-
and
moderate-income
students
by
up
to
$125
billion
through
such
means
as
freezing
the
maximum
grant
and
kicking
part-time
students
off
from
receiving
Pell
grants. Letting
higher
education
tax
cuts
expire
including
the
American
Opportunity
Tax
Credit
which
helps
defray
college
costs
for
11.5
million
working-
and
middle-class
students
by
an
average
of
more
than
$1,100
each
year.
I
remain
committed
to
working
with
my
colleagues
in
Congress
to
ensure
that
we
do
not
balance
the
budget
on
the
backs
of
hard-working
folks
or
students.
We
must
have
a
budget
that
increases
opportunities
for
folks
by
promotes
economic
growth,
supports
job
creation,
and
invests
in
education
to
ensure
it
is
affordable
and
accessible
for
students.
We
must
continue
to
strive
for
our
nation
to
be
the
land
of
opportunity
for
generations
to
come.
Sincerely,
Member
of
Congress
