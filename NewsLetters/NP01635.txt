Cynthia and I
wish you a Happy Easter. Just as Spring brings us new life, Easter
signals a time of renewal and rebirth. This holy day is a reminder for us
all to appreciate time with family and friends, and most importantly
to reflect on the importance of faith. For me, today is a time to
recommit to Jesus Christ and to rejoice in His resurrection. Because of
His sacrifice, we can rise above our own sins and find redemption and
everlasting peace in God.
Whatever your faith may be, we wish you the peace of this
season.
As you spend time with loved ones and pray, we ask you to join us in
continuing to pray for our troops around the world. Likewise, this is
an important time to remember and give thanks for all those brave men
and women who have laid down their lives fighting for our
freedom.
Happy Easter, and may God bless
you!
