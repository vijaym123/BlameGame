According to the
Government Accountability Office , the Department of Homeland Security
the third largest federal agency
has failed to properly manage the systems and programs used to secure our borders, protect our shores, and monitor goods coming into the U.S.
The federal government must be accountable to the American people for how their hard-earned tax dollars are being spent. An oversized, wasteful government is a serious threat to the stability and success of our nation. Thats why I supported the DHS Acquisition Accountability and Efficiency Act,
H.R. 4228 , which requires the DHS to streamline its acquisition process and hold its programs accountable.
When it comes to national security, our federal agencies have a responsibility to keep our nation safe from those who would wish us harm, whether they are from within the United States or from other countries seeking to get into our country. However, national security must not come at the cost of the fiscal integrity of our country.
Yours in service,
Randy
