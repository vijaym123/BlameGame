Dear Friend,
There is still time to RSVP for Sunday's
When Women Succeed, America Succeeds Forum
on what the
democratic economic agenda means for women and families in Louisiana. The
event will feature remarks from myself,
U.S. House Democratic
Leader Nancy Pelosi , and first-hand accounts from Louisiana women
discussing their experiences fighting for affordable child care,
equal pay, and a critical work-life family balance.
When Women
Succeed, America Succeeds is an actionable legislative agenda that
recognizes the critical role women play in Americas workforce. Almost
half of all workers are women and 40 percent of working women are the
primary breadwinners in their families.
The pay, child care and
work-family balance policies are necessary to address the economic
insecurities of American women and their families, while also providing
a boost to our nations economy.
Please join us on
September 21, 2014 at LBC 213-Kendall Cram Lecture Hall Lavin-Bernick Center
on the campus of Tulane University. The forum will begin at 3:00
PM.
