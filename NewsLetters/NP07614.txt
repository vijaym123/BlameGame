Visit with ProJeCt of Easton's Sizzle Program
Earlier this month, I had the pleasure of visiting ProJeCt of Easton's SIZZLE at Shawnee Elementary School in Forks Township, a free summer reading program for disadvantaged elementary students.
Every summer the program helps over 200 students maintain and improve their skills that were gained during the school year.
ProJeCt is a community benefit human service agency founded by local clergy and community leaders in the wake of the Martin Luther King Jr. assassination and in response to the rising tide of poverty and social unrest of 1968. Organizations like ProJeCt play a vital role in our community by leveling the playing field for disadvantaged youth.
I look forward to meeting with more organizations from the 17th district and addressing the challenges confronting non-profits today.

ProJeCt of Easton, Inc. receives federal funds through the state for adult basic education and ESL/Civics as part of the Workforce Investment Act, now the Workforce Innovation Opportunity Act.
They also receive Community Development Block Grant funds through Northampton County.
Protecting Consumers From Unreasonable Credit Rates Act
To protect consumers from payday lenders, I recently introduced the Protecting Consumers from Unreasonable Credit Rates Act. Various federal and state loopholes allow unscrupulous lenders to charge cash-strapped consumers extremely high APR rates for everyday purchases.
For some loans, such as car loan payments, APR rates go as high as 3,500%.
We need safeguards to protect potential consumers from payday lenders who have a disproportionate effect on low income communities.
Research by the Center for Responsible Lending found that in eleven states and the District of Columbia the enforcement of a 36% APR cap saved consumers $1.4 billion per year without limiting the access to credit.
This bill would establish a maximum APR equal to 36% and apply to all transactions including, mortgages, car loans, credit cards, overdraft loans, car title loans, refund anticipation loans, and payday loans. It would also encourage the creation of alternative small dollar lending practices and direct civil courts and State Attorneys General to enforce the new cap.
While Americans recover from the Great Recession, this bill would protect the hard earned resources of consumers so they do not fall into the hands of predatory lenders.
