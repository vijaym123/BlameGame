David -- this is absolutely FANTASTIC:
With just 8 hours to go before the deadline, we&rsquo;re within striking distance of hitting an
EYE-POPPING $1OO,OOO
online for the quarter.
For a House campaign like ours, that&rsquo;s a really big deal.
As of 4pm, we have just $1,092 to go. But David, according to our records, your name is not associated with any of the 6,432 people who&rsquo;ve stepped for Brad online in the last 90 days.
There&rsquo;s still time to get your name on the list. Use the links below to chip in before midnight.
