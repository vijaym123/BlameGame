Accountability at the VA
Dear Friend,
As a young girl, my father was sent overseas to serve in Korea, and
upon returning home, he came to pick me up at school and I didn't
recognize him. That vivid memory of his sacrifice to serve his nation
is shared by so many veterans and their families today. Their
sacrifices and those of their families are freedom's foundation. It is
the poignancy of that personal memory that motivated me in Congress to
champion issues important to our armed forces and veterans.
(L)Rep. Schwartz with veterans at the American Legion in
Philadelphia after introducing legislation. (R) Rep. Schwartz meeting
with Pennsylvania VFW in Capitol.
It is deeply disappointing to hear of reports of delayed access to care
at the Department of Veterans Affairs' hospitals. Currently, the
Department of Veterans Affairs' inspector general is investigating 69
sites to determine whether employees covered up long waits for medical
appointments.
It is critical that we take this time of transition at the VA to ensure
that all our veterans have access to the resources and care needed to
honor their service and sacrifice to our country. We must do more to
ensure our veterans have access to the care they've earned.
When those who have served in our Armed Forces come home, they can face
serious health issues and some have trouble overcoming the strains of
war. I am committed to improving how the VA works to help our veterans.
I am currently working with my colleagues to make sure our veterans are
well provided for and I've recently cosponsored the Veterans' Access to
Care through Choice, Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (HR
4841), which would allow veterans access to outside medical providers
and provide emergency funds for doctors, nurse and facilities. This is
a start, but we must act quickly to solve this problem.
Should you, or someone you know, need assistance with a VA issue,
please do not hesitate to contact me
to see if I can help with any of the following
issues:
*	Official copies of separation documents or military records
*	Replacement of medals
*	Assistance with VA hospital and clinic issues
*	Assistance with claims for compensation or pensions from the VA
*	Information on GI bill benefits
*	Resources on education, employment, training and business
opportunities for veterans
Sincerely,
Allyson Y. Schwartz

Dear

As

my

he

That

Their

It
is
the
poignancy
of
that

that
motivated
me
in

to
champion
issues
important
