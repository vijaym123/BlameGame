Protecting the Unborn
5/13/15
Today, Congressman
Doug Lamborn voted for H.R. 35, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection
Act. This legislation bans abortions after 20 weeks (five months) of
pregnancy, allows exceptions for when the mother's life is threatened,
or rape or incest occur, and provides compassionate care for mother
and child.
"The scientific
and moral issues in this case are clear. Babies feel pain at the five
month mark and medical developments are moving up the point of
viability. The United States is one of only seven nations on Earth that allow
elective abortions five months into the pregnancy. As science
advances, we are living in an age of life. Recent polling shows that 60% of
the public supports H.R. 35. I have a 100% pro-life record and will
continue to be one of the leading champions and advocates for life in the
entire Congress. It is a privilege to continue that today with my
co-sponsorship and vote for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection
Act."
- Congressman Doug
Lamborn (CO-05)
