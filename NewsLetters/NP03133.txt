Dear
Friend,
At 7:20 pm tonight, Monday, January 26,
please join me for a LIVE Telephone Townhall
event.
Simply dial
(877) 229-8493
and enter
Personal Identification Number 111377
to join the call. You
can listen to me discuss with fellow Northeast Georgians how I'm
working to hold the current Administration accountable and have the
opportunity to ask me questions yourself.
I
recently introduced a bill to defund the Presidents unilateral
executive amnesty order. Id like to tell you about my other work to stop the
Presidents reckless agenda and more news from the Ninth
District.
I want to hear what YOU have to say about
important issues of the day and will do my best to respond to every
caller. However, if you still have questions after our call, please
contact my Gainesville office at (770) 297-3388. Or visit my website at
dougcollins.house.gov
and look for me on Facebook
and Twitter (links included in this
email).
Again, here are instructions for joining
tonight's call at 7:20
pm:
1. Dial (877)
229-8493
2. Enter Personal Identification Number
111377
Please try
again, if you're having trouble joining at first, and feel free to pass on
this information to your friends in Northeast Georgia. I look forward
to talking with you!
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of
Congress
