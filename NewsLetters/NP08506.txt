News from Congressman Scott Peters
June 19, 2014
Dear Friend,
Thank you for staying in touch and engaged with my office on the issues
important to you. This newsletter has an update on efforts to reform
the VA, make college more affordable, increase our military's energy
security, and increase high-quality local education.
Reducing Wait Times and Improving Accountability at the VA
In recent weeks I helped pass three bills to reform the culture of
complacency at the VA to ensure that recently discovered failures to
serve our veterans adequately and honorably end and do not continue.
You can read more about these bills HERE
or HERE
. If you are having trouble
accessing VA care or benefits, please call my San Diego office at
858-455-5550 and let us help.
In addition to launching the Military Transition Support Project
with leaders at home in San Diego, I'm leading three initiatives in
Washington to help veterans nationwide: the Veterans Employment
Transition Act, to give a tax credit to employers who hire a veteran;
the 21st Century Care for Military and Veterans Act, to incorporate
wireless medical technology in the VA; and the Shelter our
Servicemembers Act to provide non-transitional housing and wraparound
services to elderly homeless veterans.
High-Quality, Affordable College Education
An affordable, high-quality education for every family has been central
to the American story, including my own. For too many, higher education
is moving our of reach, threatening our country's ability to stay
competitive in the global economy. That's why I recently introduced
legislation to allow people with federal student loans to refinance
them down to 4.0 percent, which would save the average borrower in
California nearly $10,000 over the life of a student's loan.
Scott meeting with students at UC San Diego this spring to talk about
civic engagement and college affordability.
Energy Security = National Security Imperative
The U.S. military is the largest institutional consumer of petroleum in
the entire world, consuming 104 million barrels in 2012 at a cost of
$16.4 billion. Military leaders from the Department of Defense and from
bases across San Diego County have been advocating for an increased use
of renewable energy in the military because it will improve their
ability to fight missions and will save lives. That's why I introduced
the Department of Defense Energy Security Act earlier this year to
promote energy efficiency and the use of renewables by the military.
Scott with panelists at 'The Burden' screening to discuss energy
consumption in the Defense Department
Last week, I held a screening at the new Downtown Library of 'The
Burden,' a new film showing the costs incurred and the security risks
that our men and women endure to transport petroleum for missions
across the world. It also showed how renewables like solar and biofuels
will be necessary to our future national security.
Opening Another School in Carmel Valley
Last week I was able to help break ground on the new Middle School
being built in Carmel Valley to serve the area's growing population. It
will be located next to the high-performing Canyon Crest Academy, a
school I helped to get developed and built during my time on the San
Diego City Council.
Scott spoke with constituents and local educational leaders at the
ground-breaking of the new middle school in Carmel Valley.
Stay in Touch
I hope you'll stay connected with what I am working on and tell me
what's important to you. Like my Facebook page, follow me on Twitter,
add my Google + page
to your circles, or visit my website for

One of the most important jobs I have in Congress is providing a number
of constituent services. As always if you have any questions, are
having trouble with a federal agency, or want to weigh in on a
particular issue, feel free to email me

Dear

Thank
you
for
staying
in
touch
and
engaged
with
my
office
on
the
issues
important
to
you.
This

an

In

High-Quality,

College

An

high-quality

for
every
family
has
been
central
to
the
American
story,
including
my
own.
For
too
many,
higher
education
is
moving
our

threatening
our
country's
ability
to
stay
competitive
in
the
global
economy.

nearly

Imperative
The
U.S.
military
is
the
largest
institutional
consumer
of
petroleum
in
the
entire
world,
consuming
104
million

in

at
a

Military
leaders
from
the
Department

County
have
been
advocating
for

increased
use
of

the

it
will
improve

to
fight

That's
why
I
introduced
the

Energy
Security
Act
earlier
this
year
to
promote
energy
efficiency
and
the
use
of
renewables
by
the
military.

It
also

will
be

to
our

national
