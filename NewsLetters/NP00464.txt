Friend,
Ive been working hard in
Washington, D.C. to break through the
gridlock and dysfunction to deliver results
for Washington state families and
communities.
Theres definitely a lot to bring
you up to speed on, but before I do that, I
want to make sure Im passing along
the information you want to see.
So,
take a minute and tell me what
interests you the most. Tell me what
kind of news you would like to hear
from my office and me.
In the past few months, big things have
been happening
I introduced the
Healthy Families Act to expand access to
paid sick leave, and the Raise the Wage Act
to raise the federal minimum wage to $12 by
2020. I listened to stories from Washington
state teachers, parents, and students and I
have been working hard with colleagues from
both sides of the aisle, to fix the badly
broken No Child Left Behind Law.
Ive worked closely with
communities across the state
from
Vancouver, to the Tri-Cities, to Spokane,
and more
to make sure they were
getting the federal investments they need
to create jobs and grow their local
economies. I recently visited Joint Base
Lewis-McChord to talk to them about the
impact automatic budget cuts were having on
their lives and their community. And
Ive been proud to work with partners
in Walla Walla, Spokane, and communities
across our state to make sure our veterans
are getting the care and support they
deserve.
Those are just a few highlights,
but I want to know what issues sound
interesting you.
Let
me know and Ill make sure to
keep you updated on the things
Im working on, and the things
you want to hear about.
I work every day to bring the Washington
state way to Washington D.C., so Id
love to hear from you so I can keep you
updated and keep fighting to make sure you
have a voice at the table.
Looking forward to hearing from you!
Senator Patty Murray
