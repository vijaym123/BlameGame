Rokita Readings
A clickable offering of books and articles that I've read recently and
highly recommend, as we strive together to "Keep the Republic."
Featured in this week's Rokita Readings is an article I studied last
year by Jagadeesh Gokhale titled "Social Security Falls Even Deeper
Into a Sinkhole
."
I thought the was particularly
relevant in light of the release of the President's FY 2015 Budget
Proposal this week (more thoughts below).
The President bowed to his party leaders and took any chance for reform
to our entitlement spending, namely Social Security reforms that were
in his last budget proposal, off the table.
As you know, our
entitlement programs - Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and others
- occupy over 60% of our federal budget each year and are driving our
$17 trillion in debt.
Learn more about what makes up our federal
budget and debt by watching my debt presentation here
.
Medicare and Medicaid are the biggest drivers out of the three
programs, but Social Security is getting worse by the day.
Both
parties have gone quiet about reforms to the programs, and because we
continue to put off reforms, it further endangers Social Security and
nudges it the dangerous position Medicare and Medicaid are in.
Gokhale's column underscores the need for reform in Social Security.
Without reform, this program will be insolvent.
Without reform,
current recipients will see cuts to their promised benefits and future
generations face the likely threat of never seeing any benefits from a
program they will be paying for their entire life.
The President included Social Security reforms in his last budget.
However, in this election year, he has bowed to party leadership, Harry
Reid and Nancy Pelosi, instead of doing something meaningful and
historic for our country.

Fighting for Lower Energy Prices
This week the House passed legislation to help and protect Hoosiers
from high energy costs and #EaseTheSqueeze on the middle class.
Propane Shortage
I know from my regular stops in Indiana, Hoosiers are hurting due to
the propane shortage.
Ideas like price caps only cause worse problems,
like rationing, over the long haul.
I passed this legislation to help
solve the problem by suspending terrible regulations that are impeding
the speed of propane delivery in the first place.
This week the House passed the Home Heating Emergency Assistance
Through Transportation (HHEATT) Act, H.R. 4076, to exempt tank truck
drivers delivering propane and other home heating fuels from the
Department of Transportation Hours of Service rule.
Learn more about
this bill and my efforts to ease the burden of the propane shortage
here
Protecting Hoosiers from Obama Energy Price Increases
Also this week, the House passed legislation that I cosponsored to
protect Hoosiers from higher energy costs, the Electricity Security and
Affordability Act
, H.R. 3826.
If the President is truly fighting for people to build better lives for
themselves, then why must he insist on sticking Hoosiers with higher
energy prices?
It must stop.
A stable and growing energy industry, like coal and
natural gas, is good for Hoosiers and Americans.
It means jobs and a
better life for us all.
I will continue fighting for all people so
they can build a better life for themselves and their families without
the need for government handouts or intervention.
Learn more about the bill here

President FY 2015 Budget Proposal
On Tuesday, the President released his FY 2015 Budget Proposal.
I am fighting for all people so they can build better lives for
themselves and their families.
The President, through another budget
proposal that never balances, is fighting for bigger government, higher
taxes, and $25 trillion in debt for the children of tomorrow.
Unlike the Senate, that will not produce a budget this year, my House
Budget colleagues and I will put forth an honest and balanced budget to
grow our economy and shrink our nation's debt.
We will continue the
fight for Americans so they can build better lives for themselves and
their families.
On Wednesday, the President's Budget Director testified before the
House Budget Committee.
You can learn more about that hearing here
and see my exchange
with her here
.
Next week we will hear from the Secretary of the
Treasury, Jack Lew
, on the President's economic
proposals for the Fiscal Year.
Learn more or watch it live on
Wednesday here
.
In Summary - President Obama's FY 2015 Budget:
*	This budget never balances-ever.
*	Increases spending by $791 billion over the budget window-and
by $56 billion above the Bipartisan Budget Act levels in 2015 alone.
*	It adds $8.3 trillion to the national debt over the budget
window, bringing the new national debt total to $25 trillion dollars.
*	$1.8 trillion in new taxes - despite the President already
raising taxes by $1.7 trillion during his administration.

ObamaCare Keeps North Salem Family From Insurance, Harry Reid Denies
their Existence
On the floor of the United State Senate, Senate Majority Leader Harry
Reid recently claimed that ObamaCare "horror stories" are "untrue
."
Hoosiers know that he's
not being honest.
You may recall several stories I've shared here in the Rokita Report,
as well as Janet of Crawfordsville's story
on the House floor.
When the President sold Hoosiers his health care takeover plan -
ObamaCare - he made many promises.
He promised consumers would be
empowered with choices, Americans could keep their health care, health
care would be more affordable, and our national debt would be reduced.
We now know that the President was pedaling outright falsehoods that
have serious consequences for Hoosier families.
Harry Reid is so
blinded by partisanship that he refuses to help suffering Americans.
Suzanna, of North Salem, and her family
Take for instance Suzanna and her family in North Salem.
Janet and her
family began applying for ObamaCare on the first open enrollment date,
October 1.
She looked forward to the October enrollment date for
ObamaCare because the President promised lower premiums, lower
deductibles, and better insurance than they could afford on the
individual market.
Suzanna and her son both suffer from allergy problems that require
monthly doctor visits, and both her children require additional dental
work beyond their normal checkups.
It is very important to Suzanna and
her husband that their family is insured.
Unfortunately, Suzanna and her family have learned, like so many
others, that these promises were not ones that would be backed up.
Suzanna began the application process on October 1.
To date, she has
had to reapply for coverage nearly 30 times.
Along the way, she was
read many scripts over the phone with various instructions on how to
confirm enrollment for her and her family.
As it stands today, her
family still are not covered for a multitude of bureaucratic failings
caused by the President's signature legislation - ObamaCare.
You can
read more of Suzanna's story here
.
I continue to receive stories from Hoosiers that underscore how
ObamaCare has done the complete opposite of what was promised when it
was sold to the American people.
The fight to repeal and replace this
insidious
law continues.
Hoosiers deserve a better way to health care
reform.
If you or someone you know has had a similar experiences due to
ObamaCare, please send me your story, your cancellation notice, or rate
increase documents at InsuranceCancellations@mail.house.gov
.
Learn more about a better way to health care reform.
Last year, I
introduced a patient-centered and market-based plan - the American
Health Care Reform Act
.

Medicare
and
Medicaid
are
the
biggest
drivers
out
of
the
three
programs,
but
Social
Security
is
getting
worse
by
the
day.
Both

have

The

However,
in

he
has
bowed

leadership,
Harry

Fighting

This

the
House
passed
legislation
to
help
and
protect
Hoosiers
from
high
energy
costs
and
#EaseTheSqueeze

Propane
Shortage
I
know
from

in

Hoosiers
are
hurting
due
to
the
propane
shortage.
Ideas
like
price
caps
only

I

In
Summary
-
President
Obama&#8217;s
FY
2015
Budget: This
budget
never
balances&#8212;ever. Increases
spending
by
$791
billion
over
the
budget
window&#8212;and
by
$56
billion
above
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act
levels
in
2015
alone. It
adds
$8.3
trillion
to
the
national
debt
over
the
budget
window,
bringing
the
new
national
debt
total
to
$25
trillion
dollars. $1.8
trillion
in
new
taxes
&#8211;
despite
the
President
already
raising
taxes
by
$1.7
trillion
during
his
administration.
ObamaCare
Keeps
North
Salem
Family From
Insurance,
Harry
Reid
Denies
their
Existence
On the
floor
of
the
United
State
Senate,
Senate
Majority
Leader
Harry
Reid
recently
claimed
that
ObamaCare
"horror
stories"
are
"untrue ."
Hoosiers
know
that
he's
not
being
honest.
You
may
recall
several
stories
I've
shared
here
in
the
Rokita
Report,
as
well
as
Janet
of
Crawfordsville's
story
on
the
House
floor.
When
the
President
sold
Hoosiers
his
health
care takeover
plan
&#8211;
ObamaCare
&#8211;
he
made
many
promises.
He
promised
consumers
would
be
empowered
with
choices,
Americans
could
keep
their
health
care,
health
care
would
be
more
affordable,
and
our
national
debt
would
be
reduced.
We
now
know
that
the
President
was
pedaling
outright
falsehoods
that
have
serious
consequences
for
Hoosier
families.
Harry
Reid
is
so
blinded
by
partisanship
that
he
refuses
to
help
suffering
Americans.
Suzanna,
of North
Salem,
and
her
family
Take
for
instance
Suzanna
and
her
family in
North
Salem.
Janet
and
her
family
began
applying
for
ObamaCare
on
the
first
open
enrollment
date,
October
1.
She
looked
forward
to
the
October
enrollment
date for
ObamaCare
because
the
President
promised
lower
premiums,
lower
deductibles,
and
better
insurance
than
they
could
afford
on
the
individual
market.
Suzanna
and
her
son
both
suffer
from
allergy
problems
that
require
monthly
doctor
visits,
and
both
her
children
require
additional
dental
work
beyond
their
normal
checkups.
It
is
very
important
to Suzanna
and
her
husband
that
their
family
is
insured.
Unfortunately,
Suzanna
and
her
family
have
learned,
like
so
many
others,
that
these
promises
were
not
ones
that
would
be
backed
up.
Suzanna
began
the
application
process
on
October
1.
To
date,
she
has
had
to
reapply
for
coverage
nearly
30
times.
Along
the
way,
she
was
read
many
scripts
over
the
phone
with
various
instructions
on
how
to
confirm
enrollment
for
her
and
her
family.
As
it
stands
today,
her
family
still
are
not
covered
for
a
multitude
of
bureaucratic
failings
caused
by
the
President's
signature
legislation
-
ObamaCare.
You
can
read
more
of
Suzanna's
story
here .
I continue
to
receive
stories
from
Hoosiers that
underscore how
ObamaCare
has
done
the
complete
opposite
of
what
was
promised
when
it
was
sold
to
the
American
people.
The
fight
to
repeal
and
replace
this
insidious
law
continues.
Hoosiers
deserve
a
better
way
to
health
care
reform.
If
you
or
someone
you
know
has
had
a
similar
experiences
due
to
ObamaCare, please

your story,
your cancellation
notice,
or

documents at
