Wicker Highlights Importance
of
Long-Term Transportation Plan
Federal
Policy Should Foster Input From Local
Officials
Congress recently took an important step to
ensure that America's roads and bridges continue to receive the
maintenance and upgrades they need.
Passage of the "Highway and
Transportation Funding Act of 2014" offers a necessary short-term fix to the
looming insolvency of the Highway Trust Fund.
Without
congressional action, funding for federal surface transportation programs would
have expired at the end of September, putting many critical public
infrastructure projects at risk of being left incomplete.
Moreover,
there would have been no funding for any new projects in 2015,
significantly impacting construction and engineering jobs.
A long-term transportation plan is still an
immediate priority for lawmakers, who have a responsibility to
address America's backlog of infrastructure needs.
As a member of the
Environment and Public Works Committee, I am directly involved in this
process and look forward to debating a comprehensive bill in the
coming months.
Poor Infrastructure Threatens Jobs, Economic
Growth
An efficient
and effective transportation network plays an instrumental role in the
vitality of our communities.
The American Society of Civil
Engineers estimates that poor infrastructure could cost our country 3.5
million jobs and nearly $1 trillion in business sales by 2020.
With
a modern system of roads and bridges, commerce can flow uninterrupted,
keeping prices from rising for
consumers.
Encouraging
Competition to Address Local
Needs
Local leaders are on the frontlines of America's
transportation challenges but often lack the resources to pay for urgent
improvements.
Less than 15 percent of all authorized federal highway
funds and only one grant program are available to cities and counties.
This grant program is both underfunded and overwhelmed with
requests.
As Congress moves
forward with a long-term highway bill, I plan to join Sen. Cory Booker
(D-N.J.) in offering legislation to empower local officials with more
control in addressing the transportation needs of their communities.
Our bipartisan measure would allow states to hold competitions for
federal funds, giving local stakeholders an opportunity to develop
solutions that best suit their transportation priorities.
Instead
of federal bureaucrats making the decisions, a local panel would judge
the projects based on their improvements to the transportation
system, innovation, and impact on the economy.
In this way, the most
targeted and cost-effective projects are prioritized, promoting wiser
use of taxpayer dollars.
Improving Mississippi's
Transportation
System
Mississippi benefits from important federal investments in transportation.
A new part of Highway 6 stretching from Tupelo into Pontotoc County
is the product of federal funds administered by the Mississippi
Department of Transportation.
Under a
competitive grant process, other infrastructure proposals across our
state could have a fighting chance.
For instance, in Hattiesburg,
a project to provide reliable and safe transportation for the Twin
Forks community and commuters from Petal would encourage business growth
and improve access to police, ambulance, and fire services.
Another proposal for strategic road improvements in Gulfport would
establish an emergency evacuation route.
Each could improve the
quality of life for residents in constructive
ways.
Instead of worrying about funding fluctuations in
Washington, local officials should have confidence and certainty when dealing
with transportation issues in their communities.
They know the
true needs of local residents, and federal policy should recognize the
value of this input.
A robust transportation system is an
investment with many dividends, not least in boosting public safety and
America'As future economic competitiveness.
