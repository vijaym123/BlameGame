Dear Friend,
With only a few hours left before our midnight deadline, our campaign is still a few dollars short of our $20,000 fundraising goal for May. We&rsquo;ve had a good month, but with just a few more grassroots donations, we can have a
great
month. Click below to make a $5 contribution and push us over the top.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Thanks for your support. I don&rsquo;t know what the Koch brothers and their allies will do next, but with your help, I know we&rsquo;ll be prepared.
