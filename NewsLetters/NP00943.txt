Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio) visited Smale Riverfront Park
ahead of the official opening of Carol Ann's Carousel, the latest
attraction to the park. Portman has demonstrated support for the
development of the Riverfront Park site since planning began. He led
the effort to secure assistance from the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers to
control erosion and prevent flooding. Portman has visited the
Riverfront Park site in the past and continues to engage with
Cincinnati Park Board leadership and advocate on behalf of the project.
On Monday evening, Portman appeared on Fox News Channel's On The Record
with Greta Van Susteren
to
discuss his recent visit to Israel, which included a meeting with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Portman and Netanyahu
discussed the importance of the U.S.-Israeli relationship, as well as
the need to prevent a nuclear Iran.
Portman recently announced that his bipartisan amendment to combat the
anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement
successfully passed
the Senate Finance Committee. Over the past several years, a
growing contingency of countries have sought to isolate and
delegitimize Israel through BDS. This amendment leverages ongoing trade
negotiations to discourage prospective U.S. trade partners from
engaging in economic discrimination against Israel.
Video of Portman's interview can be found here
.
On Tuesday, Portman also spoke on the Senate floor
about the need to stand with Israel and prevent Iran from
becoming a nuclear state.
Full video of the speech can be found here
.
Also on Tuesday, Portman, a member of the Senate Budget and Finance
Committees, voted in favor of the Concurrent Budget Resolution
, which has now been passed by both
the House and Senate. This is the first balanced budget passed by
Congress in over a decade.
The Resolution includes language similar to Portman's dynamic scoring
legislation, which would create a rule requiring the Senate to adopt
"dynamic scoring" of major tax and spending legislation. Virtually all
economists agree that major tax changes can alter economic growth
rates, which in turn impact the revenue effect of those changes.
However, currently the official "static" scores exclude these
macroeconomic impacts. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) and
Congressional Budget Office (CBO) already have the models and resources
to score the macroeconomic impact of major tax and spending bills at no
taxpayer cost.
"I'm pleased to support this budget which promises taxpayers a more
efficient, effective, and accountable government," Portman stated.
"While no budget is perfect, this budget balances and contains ideas
that will help boost jobs and grow our economy. It also includes
provisions similar to my dynamic scoring bill which allows legislators
to make decisions based on real economic numbers rather than static,
out-of-touch estimates that discourage reform. Congress has a
responsibility to pass a budget, and I'm pleased to be part of the
effort to make Washington work again."
Portman also spoke on the Senate Floor regarding the budget. Video of
his comments can be found here
.
On Wednesday, Portman's Federal Permitting Improvement Act of 2015
(S.280) passed the Senate Homeland
Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC). This bipartisan
legislation, which Portman authored with U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill
(D-Mo.), will remove obstacles to building projects and stimulate
growth and create good-paying jobs. The current permitting process is
out of date and overly complicated.
Portman discussed his bill during the markup. Video can be found here
.
The Federal Permitting Improvement Act has received strong support from
business, labor, and environmental groups.
Portman discussed its passage on the Senate floor
.
"This legislation can unite both of our parties.
It's something that
will help to get our economy going again. It's something that the
President's Jobs Council has called for. It's something that business
groups have called for including the Chamber of Commerce and Business
Roundtable. Again, commonsense reforms that bring together groups that
don't often see eye to eye, including the labor unions."
Video can be found here
.
Also on Wednesday, Portman commended the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA)
on the announcement that it will issue
health advisory values that states and utilities can use to protect
Americans from elevated levels of algal toxins in drinking water.
Portman is the author of the Safe and Secure Drinking Water Act
. This bill was
developed in response to the high microcystin levels in the Western
Lake Erie basin and directs the EPA to publish a health advisory and
submit reports on what level of microcystin in drinking water is
expected to be safe for human consumption. The U.S. Senate unanimously
passed this bill in December 2014.
"I'm pleased the EPA is issuing guidelines that will help communities
in Ohio make informed decisions on how best to protect their drinking
water from harmful contaminants.
This is a good first step, but we
must continue to work together to improve the underlying health of Lake
Erie," Portman stated. "It's crucial that all levels of government work
together to identify what is safe, and what is not."
Portman is the author of the Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia Research
and Control Amendments Act
, which was signed into law last year.
On Thursday, Portman released the following statement
regarding his vote in support of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act,
legislation which would give Congress a role in approving or
disapproving any Iran agreement:
"I support this bill because it will ensure Congress has the ability to
vote on a final deal, which is an important safeguard against an
agreement that will allow Iran to become a threshold nuclear state.
It's also important that as the Administration works on a final deal,
they know it's one that they will need to sell to Congress and the
American people. That's important negotiating leverage.
"I feel strongly that Congress has a critical role to play in weighing
the merits of any agreement, and this legislation gives Congress a
voice. I will continue to focus on the importance of any agreement
being enforceable, both through effective international monitoring and
the ability to re-impose sanctions if violations occur. This is of the
utmost importance for our own national security, as well as for our
close allies in the region such as Israel."
Earlier in the day, Portman, a member of the Senate Homeland Security
and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), discussed the effects of
terrorist groups recruiting individuals in the United States
, including in the state of
Ohio. There have been several instances in the past year of individuals
being radicalized both through direct communication with these
terrorist groups online and indirectly through propaganda easily
accessed by anyone with an internet connection.

On Social Media:
Portman permitting bill passes committee
Sen. Rob Portman's federal permitting bill has passed through a key
Senate committee.
And like Portman's energy efficiency bill, it's got sort of a universal
appeal: Everyone from the AFL-CIO Building Trade Council to the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce back it.
Sean McGarvey of the Building Trades Union, for example, calls the bill
a "no-brainer."
The bill would allow for better coordination and deadline-setting for
permitting decisions; enhanced transparency; and reduced litigation
delays.
It's limited to economically significant capital projects - think more
than $200 million projects. And it covers capital projects ranging from
renewable or conventional energy production to electricity transmission
to surface transportation to aviation, ports and waterways.
Portman, R-Ohio, cosponsored the bill with Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.

Israel to keep getting JSMC vehicles
The Joint Systems Manufacturing Center will continue to make defense
vehicles for Israel.
U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, announced that Israel's Defense Ministry
signed a contract with the U.S. to continue production in Lima,
according to a release from Portman's office.
"This investment is important for JSMC, and will help make our ally and
their soldiers safer and more effective," said Portman in a statement.
"I will continue my efforts to boost JSMC and support Israel as they
face ongoing security threats."
Israel's Defense Ministry signed a $310 million contract with the
company that operates the JSMC, General Dynamic Land Systems.
"U.S.-Israeli security cooperation is critical, especially because of
the volatility of the region," said Portman in a statement. "The
Israelis rely on the unparalleled combat vehicle manufacturing
capability in Lima."
Portman met with Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak in 2012 to talk
about the program and the benefits for both countries, according to the
release.
He continued discussions this past weekend in Israel and also talked of
the value of sustaining U.S. and Israel "defense coordination and
investment" with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according
to the release.

Sen. Rob Portman discusses meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu
After traveling to Israel over the weekend to meet with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman relayed
Netanyahu's concerns about a pending treaty that's intended to lift
economic sanctions against Iran and also keep it from developing
nuclear weapons.
"He's worried," Portman told FoxNews' Greta Van Susteren. "He's
concerned about what's happening in the neighborhood. It's a pretty
dangerous and volatile place."
Portman told Van Susteren that Netanyahu doesn't want sanctions lifted
against Iran or for the country to become a "threshold nuclear power"
when Iran is the "number one state sponsor of terrorism in the world."
"It's really important that we have a constant dialogue with them and
we stand with them," said Portman. "Israel is the one democracy in the
region. They're our true friend. If we're not standing with them, the
place will be even more volatile, the Middle East and the region."

Benjamin Netanyahu," Sabrina Eaton. Cleveland Plain Dealer
. May 5, 2015.)
Ohio GOP Sen. Portman is visiting and reassuring Israel
Ohio's Republican U.S. Sen. Rob Portman is in Israel and met with Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and intelligence and other Israeli
officials. Portman told the Jerusalem Post he thinks Congress can pass
a law that would give it oversight of a prospective nuclear deal
between the U.S. and Iran. He acknowledged however that three
amendments to the bill have made that tougher, including one that would
insist that Iran recognize Israel's right to exist.

U.S. must do more to help Ukraine withstand Russian aggression
As multiple global crises compete for our attention, we must not
neglect the situation in Ukraine and the need to stand with an ally who
needs our help. I recently returned from a fact-finding trip to
Ukraine, a year after my colleague Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland and I
led a congressional delegation to monitor last year's presidential
election.
Ukrainians made an unequivocal choice to pursue a pro-Western,
democratic path, and are making progress in fighting decades of endemic
corruption that left Ukraine weak, while simultaneously dealing with a
blatant Russian invasion. Successful follow-through on these reforms
will be absolutely essential to the long-term success and prosperity of
Ukraine.
However, none of these efforts will mean much if Ukraine is unable to
secure its borders or defend its sovereignty.Every day, Ukrainian
positions come under attack, and Russian tanks, supplies, and soldiers
continue to cross the border. Many of these attacks involve the use of
heavy artillery systems that the separatists were supposed to have
withdrawn under the terms of the cease-fire.
The United States and our NATO allies must do more to help strengthen
Ukrainian military capabilities. In the short-term, Ukraine needs
critical defensive capabilities such as anti-tank weapons, secure
communications, short- and long-range counterbattery radars, night
vision and thermal optics, unmanned aerial vehicles, and air defense
systems. Equally important is effective monitoring of U.S. assistance -
from both the American and Ukrainian sides - to ensure it reaches the
front-line troops who need it most.
The administration seems to believe that the requested U.S. support for
Ukraine will somehow lead to more instability. I believe that further
inaction will only expand the current conflict. At no point in this
conflict has Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to escalate
been costly enough to force him to fundamentally reconsider his
strategy. Russia's annexation of Crimea, campaign to destabilize and
then invade eastern Ukraine last summer and fall, and recent winter
offensive all happened despite Western attempts to force a negotiated
settlement.
Efforts to strengthen Ukraine must be part of a broader, comprehensive
strategy to support our regional allies and deter Russian aggression.
We must demonstrate America's commitment to the security of our NATO
allies through a reinforced NATO presence in Eastern Europe and more
vigorous American engagement in training and security cooperation. Most
importantly, we must be very clear about the stakes in this conflict.
President Putin's actions upend decades of established international
norms, and the response demonstrates the weakness of the Western
alliance and America's leadership.
Confidence in America and our European allies' unity and commitment to
uphold these norms deters bad actors and incentivizes other countries
to play by the rules, which helps ensure peace, stability, and
prosperity. If the credibility of this commitment is in doubt, then the
chance for violence, instability, and economic collapse increases.
Nearly every Ukrainian official I met with understood this. It's time
the White House did as well.

health
advisory
values
that

Portman
is
the
author
of
the
Safe

Drinking
Water
Act .
This
bill
was
developed
in
response
to
the
high
microcystin
levels
in
the
Western

basin
and
directs

to
publish
a

advisory
and
submit
reports
on
what
level
of
microcystin
in
drinking
water
is
expected
to
be
safe
for
human
consumption.
The
U.S.
Senate
unanimously
passed
this
bill
in
December
2014.
&#8220;I&#8217;m
pleased
the
EPA
is
issuing
guidelines
that
will
help
communities
in
Ohio
make
informed
decisions
on
how
best
to
protect
their
drinking
water
from
harmful
contaminants.
This
is
a
good
first
step,
but
we
must
continue
to
work
together
to
improve
the
underlying
health
of
Lake
Erie,&#8221;
Portman
stated.
&#8220;It&#8217;s
crucial
that
all
levels
of
government
work
together
to
identify
what
is
safe,
and
what
is
not.&#8221;
Portman
is
the
author
of
the
Harmful
Algal
Blooms
and
Hypoxia
Research
and
Control
Amendments
Act ,
which
was
signed
into
law
last
year.
On
Thursday,
Portman
released
the
following
statement
regarding
his
vote
in
support
of
the
Iran
Nuclear
Agreement
Review
Act,
legislation
which
would
give
Congress
a
role
in
approving
or
disapproving
any
Iran
agreement:
&#8220;I
support
this
bill
because
it
will
ensure
Congress
has
the
ability
to
vote
on
a
final
deal,
which
is
an
important
safeguard
against
an
agreement
that
will
allow
Iran
to
become
a
threshold
nuclear
state.
It's
also
important
that
as
the
Administration
works
on
a
final
deal,
they
know
it's
one
that
they
will
need
to
sell
to
Congress
and
the
American
people.
That's
important
negotiating
leverage.
&#8220;I
feel
strongly
that
Congress
has
a
critical
role
to
play
in
weighing
the
merits
of
any
agreement,
and
this
legislation
gives
Congress
a
voice.
I
will
continue
to
focus
on
the
importance
of
any
agreement
being
enforceable,
both
through
effective
international
monitoring
and
the
ability
to
re-impose
sanctions
if
violations
occur.
This
is
of
the
utmost
importance
for
our
own
national
security,
as
well
as
for
our
close
allies
in
the
region
such
as
Israel.&#8221;
Earlier
in
the
day,
Portman,
a
member
of
the
Senate
Homeland
Security

(HSGAC),
discussed
the
effects
of
terrorist
groups
recruiting
individuals
in
the
United

Sen.
Rob
Portman
discusses
meeting
with
Israeli
Prime
Minister
Benjamin
Netanyahu
After
traveling
to
Israel
over
the
weekend
to
meet
with
Israeli
Prime
Minister
Benjamin
Netanyahu,
Ohio
GOP
Sen.
Rob
Portman
relayed
Netanyahu's
concerns
about
a
pending
treaty
that's
intended
to
lift
economic
sanctions
against
Iran
and
also
keep
it
from
developing
nuclear
weapons.
"He's
worried,"
Portman
told
FoxNews'
Greta
Van
Susteren.
"He's
concerned
about
what's
happening
in
the
neighborhood.
It's
a
pretty
dangerous
and
volatile
place."
Portman
told
Van
Susteren
that
Netanyahu
doesn't
want
sanctions
lifted
against
Iran
or
for
the
country
to
become
a
"threshold
nuclear
power"
when
Iran
is
the
"number
one
state
sponsor
of
terrorism
in
the
world."
"It's
really
important
that
we
have
a
constant
dialogue
with
them
and
we
stand
with
them,"
said
Portman.
"Israel
is
the
one
democracy
in
the
region.
They're
our
true
friend.
If
we're
not
standing
with
them,
the
place
will
be
even
more
volatile,
the
Middle
East
and
the
region."

U.S.
must
do
more
to
help
Ukraine
withstand
Russian
aggression
As
multiple
global
crises
compete
for
our
attention,
we
must
not
neglect
the
situation
in
Ukraine
and
the
need
to
stand
with
an
ally
who
needs
our
help.
I
recently
returned
from
a
fact-finding
trip
to
Ukraine,
a
year
after
my
colleague
Sen.
Ben
Cardin
of
Maryland
and
I
led
a
congressional
delegation
to
monitor
last
year's
presidential
election.
Ukrainians
made
an
unequivocal
choice
to
pursue
a
pro-Western,
democratic
path,
and
are
making
progress
in
fighting
decades
of
endemic
corruption
that
left
Ukraine
weak,
while
simultaneously
dealing
with
a
blatant
Russian
invasion.
Successful
follow-through
on
these
reforms
will
be
absolutely
essential
to
the
long-term
success
and
prosperity
of
Ukraine.
However,
none
of
these
efforts
will
mean
much
if
Ukraine
is
unable
to
secure
its
borders
or
defend
its
sovereignty&#8230;Every
day,
Ukrainian
positions
come
under
attack,
and
Russian
tanks,
supplies,
and
soldiers
continue
to
cross
the
border.
Many
of
these
attacks
involve
the
use
of
heavy
artillery
systems
that
the
separatists
were
supposed
to
have
withdrawn
under
the
terms
of
the
cease-fire.
The
United
States
and
our
NATO
allies
must
do
more
to
help
strengthen
Ukrainian
military
capabilities.
In
the
short-term,
Ukraine
needs
critical
defensive
capabilities
such
as
anti-tank
weapons,
secure
communications,
short-
and
long-range
counterbattery
radars,
night
vision
and
thermal
optics,
unmanned
aerial
vehicles,
and
air
defense
systems.
Equally
important
is
effective
monitoring
of
U.S.
assistance
&#8212;
from
both
the
American
and
Ukrainian
sides
&#8212;
to
ensure
it
reaches
the
front-line
troops
who
need
it
most.
The
administration
seems
to
believe
that
the
requested
U.S.
support
for
Ukraine
will
somehow
lead
to
more
instability.
I
believe
that
further
inaction
will
only
expand
the
current
conflict.
At
no
point
in
this
conflict
has
Russian
President
Vladimir
Putin's
decision
to
escalate
been
costly
enough
to
force
him
to
fundamentally
reconsider
his
strategy.
Russia's
annexation
of
Crimea,
campaign
to
destabilize
and
then
invade
eastern
Ukraine
last
summer
and
fall,
and
recent
winter
offensive
all
happened
despite
Western
attempts
to
force
a
negotiated
settlement.
Efforts
to
strengthen
Ukraine
must
be
part
of
a
broader,
comprehensive
strategy
to
support
our
regional
allies
and
deter
Russian
aggression.
We
must
demonstrate
America's
commitment
to
the
security
of
our
NATO
allies
through
a
reinforced
NATO
presence
in
Eastern
Europe
and
more
vigorous
American
engagement
in
training
and
security
cooperation.
Most
importantly,
we
must
be
very
clear
about
the
stakes
in
this
conflict.
President
Putin's
actions
upend
decades
of
established
international
norms,
and
the
response
demonstrates
the
weakness
of
the
Western
alliance
and
America's
leadership.
Confidence
in
America
and
our
European
allies'
unity
and
commitment
to
uphold
these
norms
deters
bad
actors
and
incentivizes
other
countries
to
play
by
the
rules,
which
helps
ensure
peace,
stability,
and
prosperity.
If
the
credibility
of
this
commitment
is
in
doubt,
then
the
chance
for
violence,
instability,
and
economic
collapse
increases.
Nearly
every
Ukrainian
official
I
met
with
understood
this.
It's
time
the
White
House
did
as
well.
(&#8220;U.S.
must
do
more
to
help
Ukraine
withstand
Russian
aggression,&#8221;
