Sensible immigration system needed
By Congressman Ken Calvert
The city of Murrieta recently had the national spotlight cast upon it.
The attention it received was not something the community sought. After
all, Murrieta is a thriving community of more than 100,000 people-25
percent of them Latino-where parents are commuting to a job they wish
was a little closer to home and planning weekend activities with family
and friends.
The cause for the attention is rooted many miles away. Immigrants are
crossing our border illegally in droves through the Rio Grande Valley
in Texas, overwhelming those responsible for securing the border.
Instead of taking bold, effective action, the Obama administration is
spreading the problem across the country, including communities here in
Riverside County.
President Barack Obama continues to advocate for an amnesty policy that
has been interpreted throughout much of the world as an open invitation
to cross our borders without repercussion. Smugglers have developed a
sophisticated system for moving illegal immigrants from Mexico and
Central America into the U.S. Meanwhile, poverty, crime and corruption
in Central American countries have motivated many to flee.
I am convinced that so many immigrants are crossing into Texas
illegally because they believe the Obama administration will not deport
them once they are here. How else can you explain the news stories of
immigrants walking up to Border Patrol agents seeking to be taken into
custody. Border Patrol agents even describe how smugglers have called
and instructed them where to pick up the group of immigrants they just
transported.
Our immigration enforcement agencies detain and quickly repatriate any
Mexican national caught illegally crossing the border. However, most
immigrants illegally crossing from a Central American country are
detained, processed and released after receiving a notice to appear
before an immigration judge. Border Patrol agents informally call the
paper a"notice to disappear,"knowing that an estimated 90 percent of
illegal immigrants never appear before a judge. We must find the means
to detain, adjudicate and repatriate Central Americans, unless severe
circumstances warrant asylum.
I am working with my colleagues in the House of Representatives to
provide the resources for an effective strategy in the Rio Grande
Valley. If we need more immigration judges, let's send more judges or
appoint new ones. We all believe that while these people are in our
custody they must be treated with dignity and respect. The short-term
costs to put the brakes on our crisis at the border are far cheaper
than the long-term costs of an open borders policy.
The border fence we have built in California and beyond has generally
been effective, which is why today's problem is concentrated in an
unfenced region of Texas. We need to improve our physical border,
including installation of a double-layer fence where possible, but
enforcement does not end there. I wrote the bill that created E-Verify,
the employment verification system that informs employers whether newly
hired workers are eligible for work in our country. It is long past
time for the federal government to make the use of E-Verify mandatory
for every business.
I cannot, and will not, support any broader effort to reform our
immigration laws until we establish strong enforcement policies. This
current crisis is not because Congress has failed to pass amnesty
legislation, it exists because of the failures of multiple
administrations to enforce current laws and protect our borders.
My constituents are frustrated by the president's willful disregard for
the democratic institutions that are supposed to give them a voice. It
is under this context that our community was told that hundreds of
illegal immigrants would be transported and released in our region. I
believe the biggest concern of my constituents is not that these
immigrants want to live in our country, but that if we fail to uphold
the Rule of Law, our country will erode into one that resembles the
failed governments in the countries that the immigrants are fleeing.
America has a proud tradition of legal immigration, allowing 1 million
legal residents in annually. However, if we undermine that system, we
risk the very foundation of our country-that we are governed by laws,
not by men.

Sensible
immigration
system
needed
By
Congressman
Ken
Calvert
The
city
of
Murrieta
recently
had
the
national
spotlight
cast
upon
it.
The
attention
it
received
was
not
something
the
community
sought.
After
all,
Murrieta
is
a
thriving
community
of
more
than
100,000
people &#8212; 25
percent
of
them
Latino &#8212; where
parents
are
commuting
to
a
job
they
wish
was
a
little
closer
to
home
and
planning
weekend
activities
with
family
and
friends.
The
cause
for
the
attention
is
rooted
many
miles
away.
Immigrants
are
crossing
our
border
illegally
in
droves
through
the
Rio
Grande
Valley
in
Texas,
overwhelming
those
responsible
for
securing
the
border.
Instead
of
taking
bold,
effective
action,
the
Obama
administration
is
spreading
the
problem
across
the
country,
including
communities
here
in
Riverside
County.
President
Barack
Obama
continues
to
advocate
for
an
amnesty
policy
that
has
been
interpreted
throughout
much
of
the
world
as
an
open
invitation
to
cross
our
borders
without
repercussion.
Smugglers
have
developed
a
sophisticated
system
for
moving
illegal
immigrants
from
Mexico
and
Central
America
into
the
U.S.
Meanwhile,
poverty,
crime
and
corruption
in
Central
American
countries
have
motivated
many
to
flee.
I
am
convinced
that
so
many
immigrants
are
crossing
into
Texas
illegally
because
they
believe
the
Obama
administration
will
not
deport
them
once
they
are
here.
How
else
can
you
explain
the
news
stories
of
immigrants
walking
up
to
Border
Patrol
agents
seeking
to
be
taken
into
custody.
Border
Patrol
agents
even
describe
how
smugglers
have
called
and
instructed
them
where
to
pick
up
the
group
of
immigrants
they
just
transported.
Our
immigration
enforcement
agencies
detain
and
quickly
repatriate
any
Mexican
national
caught
illegally
crossing
the
border.
However,
most
immigrants
illegally
crossing
from
a
Central
American
country
are
detained,
processed
and
released
after
receiving
a
notice
to
appear
before
an
immigration
judge.
Border
Patrol
agents
informally
call
the
paper
a &#8220; notice
to
disappear, &#8221; knowing
that
an
estimated
90
percent
of
illegal
immigrants
never
appear
before
a
judge.
We
must
find
the
means
to
detain,
adjudicate
and
repatriate
Central
Americans,
unless
severe
circumstances
warrant
asylum.
I
am
working
with
my
colleagues
in
the
House
of
Representatives
to
provide
the
resources
for
an
effective
strategy
in
the
Rio
Grande
Valley.
If
we
need
more
immigration
judges,
let &#8217; s
send
more
judges
or
appoint
new
ones.
We
all
believe
that
while
these
people
are
in
our
custody
they
must
be
treated
with
dignity
and
respect.
The
short-term
costs
to
put
the
brakes
on
our
crisis
at
the
border
are
far
cheaper
than
the
long-term
costs
of
an
open
borders
policy.
The
border
fence
we
have
built
in
California
and
beyond
has
generally
been
effective,
which
is
why
today &#8217; s
problem
is
concentrated
in
an
unfenced
region
of
Texas.
We
need
to
improve
our
physical
border,
including
installation
of
a
double-layer
fence
where
possible,
but
enforcement
does
not
end
there.
I
wrote
the
bill
that
created
E-Verify,
the
employment
verification
system
that
informs
employers
whether
newly
hired
workers
are
eligible
for
work
in
our
country.
It
is
long
past
time
for
the
federal
government
to
make
the
use
of
E-Verify
mandatory
for
every
business.
I
cannot,
and
will
not,
support
any
broader
effort
to
reform
our
immigration
laws
until
we
establish
strong
enforcement
policies.
This
current
crisis
is
not
because
Congress
has
failed
to
pass
amnesty
legislation,
it
exists
because
of
the
failures
of
multiple
administrations
to
enforce
current
laws
and
protect
our
borders.
My
constituents
are
frustrated
by
the
president &#8217; s
willful
disregard
for
the
democratic
institutions
that
are
supposed
to
give
them
a
voice.
It
is
under
this
context
that
our
community
was
told
that
hundreds
of
illegal
immigrants
would
be
transported
and
released
in
our
region.
I
believe
the
biggest
concern
of
my
constituents
is
not
that
these
immigrants
want
to
live
in
our
country,
but
that
if
we
fail
to
uphold
the
Rule
of
Law,
our
country
will
erode
into
one
that
resembles
the
failed
governments
in
the
countries
that
the
immigrants
are
fleeing.
America
has
a
proud
tradition
of
legal
immigration,
allowing
1
million
legal
residents
in
annually.
However,
if
we
undermine
that
system,
we
risk
the
very
foundation
of
our
country &#8212; that
we
are
governed
by
laws,
not
by
men.
