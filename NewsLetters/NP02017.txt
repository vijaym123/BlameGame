The federal governments primary responsibility to the nation is
providing for the common defense.
Ensuring America is safe and
secure shouldbe the utmost priority.
Our Founding Fathers believed
it to be so, placing it front and center in the Preamble to the
Constitution.
This is relevant now more than ever as America faces few
graver threats than the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and the
Levant, also known as ISIL.
In the past year, the world has
watched in horror as the jihadist group of Islamic extremists take lives
and territory while degrading the success of past American military
efforts.
American and coalition military efforts have met the
militants on the front lines in cities and towns throughout Iraq and Syria
with some success in depressing ISILs advances; but, the issue
stretches far beyond geopolitics.
This savage group has beheaded
Americans and a number of others.
Religious minorities, especially
Christians, in the region have been the target of the Islamic extremist
groups heinous acts, such as the February 2015 beheadings of
Egyptian Christian missionaries on a Libyan beach.
Recently,
President Obama sent Congress his proposal for the Authorized Use of
Military Force against ISIL.
The proposal calls for a three-year
anti-ISIL military operation without the option for enduring ground combat
operations while ensuring proper oversight of the mission.
However, Congress will not rubberstamp the presidents request, and we
will have a rational debate to make certain the strongest steps are
taken to ensure safety both at home and abroad.
ISIL and
Islamic extremists are a serious threat to American interests and
allies.
We must show the world our nation has the resolve to defeat this
threat.
We must give our military the tools needed to defeat
Islamic extremists and not tie the militarys hands and limit its options
to defeating this threat.
I look forward to a vigorous debate on
steps forward as Congress considers the presidents
request.
