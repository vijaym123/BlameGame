Cyber Student Volunteer Initiative
Dear College Students and Parents,
I want to make you aware of a great opportunity for
students to gain invaluable hands-on experience in a top government agency and learn more about cybersecurity.
Beginning in the spring of 2015, more than 75 selected students will complete volunteer assignments supporting the DHS cyber mission at department field offices in over 50 locations across the country, including San Antonio and Houston.
Selected students will be placed at one of the following organizations: the Office of the Chief Information Officer, Office of Intelligence and Analysis, National Protection and Programs Directorate, Transportation Security Administration, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or U.S. Secret Service. In addition to supporting activities such as cyber threat analysis, digital forensics, network diagnostics and incident response, selected students will also participate in mentoring and professional development events with DHS managers and senior leaders.
The Department of Homeland Security protects American interests and keeps the nation secure.
The deadline for application is December 12, 2014. Internships will begin in Spring 2015 and run through the summer. Learn more about programs

As always, please feel free to contact my office with any questions or concerns.
Sincerely,
Congressman Henry Cuellar
