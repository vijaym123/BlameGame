Dear Friends,
While only around 150 Mississippians and barely
over 25,000 people nationwide have managed to sign up on the Obamacare
exchanges, millions of Americans have received cancelation notices
from their health insurance providers.
In addition, the few people who have successfully used
the Obamacare website are finding limited, costly options that often
do not include their current doctors and hospitals. Not being able to
keep your doctor is yet another broken promise of Obamacare.
Friday, despite a veto threat,
an overwhelming bipartisan majority voted to keep the
promise
President Obama made to the
American public by passing the
Keep Your
Health Plan Act , of which I am a cosponsor.
The legislation is straightforward
and fair: nobody, particularly individuals, families and small
businesses struggling in the Obama economy, should be forced to pay more and
lose their doctor simply because bureaucrats in Washington do not
approve of their health insurance plans.
Stay in touch and God
bless,
#KeepYourPlan
