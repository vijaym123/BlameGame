Dear friends,
This past Thursday, Rachel and I sat down for our traditional
Thanksgiving dinner surrounded by our six little turkeys (Lucia and
Paloma pictured on the left), as well as a few additional friends and
family, and were again thankful for the many blessings in our lives. As
we now enter the official season of giving and prepare to brave the
shopping mall and toy stores to find the perfect gifts, it's worth
remembering that often the most memorable gifts do not come in shiny
packages with ribbons and bows. Sometimes it is the gift of our time or
talent that can mean the most to a person in need - and often leave a
sizable impression on us as well.
The 7th District is vibrant with groups, organizations and businesses
that are at the ready to give of their time and talents to help those
in need in our community. This month my office is teaming up with many
of them for several events and we hope you will join us!
Whether lending an ear to a Veteran who may be telling his or her story
for the first time, offering food and shelter to a family who has
fallen on hard times, or giving council to someone in search of a new
job or career path, we all have our talents and we hope you can lend a
bit of your time during this busy holiday season to join us at one - or
all - of the events below:
