Dear Friends,
Since February, the public has watched the countries of Sierra Leone,
Liberia, Guinea and now Mali struggle with a deadly outbreak of the
Ebola virus. There are more than 15,000 confirmed cases of Ebola so far
in these countries. To date, roughly 5,800 people in West Africa are
believed to have died from the virus, including two here in the United
States. The severity and scale of this outbreak has challenged the
world public health community. In light of what they have seen and read
in the news, many Americans and Delawareans have asked an important
question: how prepared is our nation to handle a major public health
threat?
On Wednesday, the committee I chair - the Senate Committee on Homeland
Security and Governmental Affairs - tried to answer that question by
examining our nation's response to the ongoing Ebola epidemic and our
overall preparedness for other public health threats. The goal of the
hearing was to identify lessons learned from our Ebola response and to
use those lessons to inform our future response to this disease and
others that could threaten our country.

Threats: How Ready Are We?"
As we learned from our panel of experts, we must have a
well-coordinated response at the federal, state and local levels. The
Centers for Disease Control and other public health officials must
establish clear guidance and protocols so that everyone - from health
professionals and first responders to school teachers and moms and dads
- knows exactly what to do and what not to do. We must also ensure that
our state and local health and emergency response professionals have
the training and tools they need to succeed, and also to protect
themselves. It's also essential to have a strong screening process in
place at our airports and borders so we can better identify and monitor
high-risk travelers. Just as important, we must guarantee the
availability of vaccines and other medicines that can treat this virus.
At the hearing, I was also heartened to learn about the dedication and
courageous acts of the health care professionals and others that are
tackling this deadly disease at home and abroad. These brave men and
women are truly looking out for the "least of these" and are to be
commended for their work.
Whether it's the Ebola virus, influenza, or a disease we have yet to
hear about, the bottom line is the same: we need to be prepared and
ready to respond. Our witnesses made it clear that the steps we are
taking now to curb the Ebola epidemic here at home and abroad are
showing positive results, and should be applied to combat all public
health threats. In other words, we are figuring out what works and
trying to do more of it - one of my keys to success for any mission.
Sincerely,
