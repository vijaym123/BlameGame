Supporting Congressional Review
of an Iranian Nuclear
Deal
5/14/15
Today,
Congressman Doug Lamborn supported H.R. 1191, the Iran Nuclear
Agreement Review Act of 2015. This bill requires a review by the House and
Senate of any nuclear agreement with Iran before President Obama can
waive or suspend sanctions previously imposed by
Congress.
"President Obama and Secretary of
State John Kerry have stumbled through months of negotiations that don't
appear to have limited Iran's march toward a nuclear weapon. By
mandating Congressional oversight and involvement, H.R. 1191 ensures that
this nuclear deal will receive the closest possible scrutiny and will
open the door to a more active participatory role for the Congress.
Although is only a baby step in the right direction, it does make some
progress that is worth supporting. When we are dealing with something
that could fundamentally change the balance of power in the Middle East,
we cannot afford to rush through any agreement without proper
Congressional oversight and due
diligence.
Passage of this
legislation is a major victory for the American people and for the safety and
security of this nation and our allies, but it is only the first
step. If a deal is reached Congress must work together to insure that it
is in fact a good deal. And, if not, Congress must do its role and
disapprove of such a
deal."

(CO-05)

Conference)
Major provisions of the bill
include:
Congressional Review:
Requires the President to submit to Congress,
within five days of concluding a comprehensive agreement with Iran: (1)
the text of the agreement and all related materials; (2) a
verification assessment on Iranian compliance; and (3) a certification that the
agreement meets U.S. non-proliferation objectives and does not
jeopardize U.S. national security, including not allowing Iran to pursue
nuclear-related military
activities.
No Suspension of Congressional
Sanctions during Review Period:
Prohibits the President from
waiving statutory sanctions while Congress reviews the agreement. If the
agreement and all related documents are submitted prior to July 10, 2015,
Congress has up to 52 days to review the deal and may vote on the
agreement in the first 30 days; the President then has 12 days to veto
the bill, followed by 10 days for Congress to override such a veto. If
the deal is submitted between July 10 and September 7, 2015, Congress
has an additional 30 days of review, for a total of up to 82
days.
Joint
Resolution of Disapproval:
Gives Congress the opportunity
to enact a joint resolution of disapproval (over a presidential veto)
within the review period.
Enactment of a joint resolution of
disapproval would prevent the President from waiving or suspending the
Congressional
sanctions.
Oversight and Compliance:
Requires the
President to certify to Congress every 90 days that Iran is complying
with the agreement. If Iran violates the terms of the deal, the
legislation provides an expedited process for Congress to rapidly restore
sanctions.
Reporting:
Includes new reporting requirements on
Irans direct and indirect support for terrorism, human rights
violations, and ballistic missile
testing.
