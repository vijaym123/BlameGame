Pushing Back
Against Lawless Immigration Executive
Actions
1/14/15
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn voted in favor of H.R. 240, the
Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2015. He supported five
amendments designed to strongly push back against President Obama's
actions regarding illegal immigration.
Amendment offered by Reps. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.), Mick
Mulvaney (R-S.C.), and Lou Bartletta
(R-Pa.):
Prevents any funds
whether they are
appropriated funds or user fees collected by the agency
to be used to
carry-out the executive actions announced on November 20, 2014 to grant
deferred action to an estimated four million unlawful
immigrants.
Additionally, it also declares that
no funds may be used to carry-out any substantially similar policies
to those
defunded.
Amendment offered by Rep. Marsha Blackburn
(R-Tenn.):
Provides
that no funds
whether they are appropriated funds or user fees
collected by the agency
may be used to consider new, renewal or
previously denied Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals
applications.
Amendment offered by
Reps. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) and Martha Roby
(R-Ala.):
Ensures that sex offenders
and domestic violence perpetrators are priorities for removal by U.S.
Immigration and Customs
Enforcement.
Amendment offered by Rep. Aaron Schock
(R-Ill.):
Expresses the
sense of Congress that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services should
stop putting the interests of unlawful immigrants ahead of legal
immigrants.
Amendment
offered by Reps. Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.) and Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.):
Expresses the sense of
Congress that U.S. workers should not be harmed by U.S. Citizenship
and Immigration Services actions. Under President Obamas executive
amnesty plan, in many cases businesses now have a $3,000 incentive to
hire an unlawful immigrant over a legal worker. Under the Affordable
Care Act, many businesses face a $3,000-per-employee penalty if they do
not provide health care to their workers. Since unlawful immigrants are
not eligible for Obamacare, they will now be more attractive to hire
than American workers in many
instances.
"I have pledged to you that
I will continually push Republican leadership to put forth
conservative pieces of legislation designed to push back against the lawless
behavior of President Obama. In the past two weeks, I have done exactly
that. I have worked with fellow conservative leaders in the House to
push the Speaker to bring the FY2015 Department of Homeland Security
appropriations bill to the floor, with language removing all available
funding streams to implement the President's executive action. The
President has said at least 22 times that he can't ignore or create
immigration law on his own. Now we are holding him accountable and standing
up for the rule of law on behalf of the American
people."
