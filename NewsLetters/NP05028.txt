Democrats are surging at exactly the right time -- with just 9 days until the election.
CO: Dems turned a 6 point deficit into a 1 point lead.
GA: Dems turned a 4 point deficit into a 3 point lead.
KY: Dems turned a 3 point deficit into a TIE with Mitch McConnell.
But it&rsquo;s not time to celebrate -- it&rsquo;s time to keep FIGHTING!
Eleven races are still within five points.
Our final-week Get Out The Vote deadline hits at midnight, and we MUST fill our $151,890 budget hole.
President Obama didn&rsquo;t sugarcoat it: &ldquo;If we fall short before midnight, we could lose the Senate.&rdquo;

The Republicans must be TERRIFIED:
Ruby red Georgia is leaning Democratic, and Nate Silver &mdash; who says we have a slight edge there &mdash; called it the tipping point state in the battle for Senate control.
But Karl Rove and the Koch brothers are throwing huge amounts of cash into attack after attack to tip the Senate to the GOP.
We&rsquo;ll overcome these attacks if we get every voter to the polls. That&rsquo;s why we NEED you before midnight.
Let&rsquo;s tear this election away from the GOP -- and hand them an incredibly crushing loss.
