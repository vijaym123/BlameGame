D e ar
Friends,
My Mom meant the world to me. Her guidance and
inspiration led me to become the first person in my family to graduate
from college. And when I decided to pursue elected office, her
confidence pushed me to dream higher than I thought
possible.
This Mothers Day, I encourage
everyone to reflect on womens contributions to their families, and to
the
workforce.
Working mothers face many challenges.
During my time in
Washington, I have advocated for stronger employment protections, such as
paid family leave and equal pay
legislation.
I also strongly support raising the
federal minimum wage so that more workers enjoy a living wage.
Approximately 56 percent of minimum wage earners are women, and, on average,
they earn half of their familys total
income.
I agree with our President when he
said that no one working full-time should live in poverty. Raising the
minimum wage would lift an estimated 1 million to 4.5 million
Americans out of
poverty.
Nor should a woman who holds the same title and responsibilities as
her male colleagues earn less than they do. I co-sponsored the Paycheck
Fairness Act and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to help close the
pay gap. The Lilly Ledbetter bill was passed by Congress and signed
into law by President Obama, but we're still fighting for the Paycheck
Fairness Act.
My
work reflects the values my Mom instilled in me. Her joyous spirit is
missed, and I honor her each day by ensuring that Americas daughters
will have the same opportunities to succeed as our
sons.
Sincerely,
Eliot L. Engel
MEMBER OF
CONGRESS
