Putin Invades, Obama Dismantles
Earlier this week the
Wall Street Journal
ran an excellent
editorial
asking why the United States is
complying with a nuclear arms reduction treaty four years earlier than the
deadline, even as Russia has been increasing its stockpile of nuclear
weapons and invading a neighboring country.
This
decision by the Obama administration sends yet another signal to the world
that the U.S. is retreating from the world stage, which can only
embolden our adversaries and the enemies of freedom
everywhere.
GAO Finds $45 Billion Wasted Through Duplicate, Fragmented
Programs
The Government Accountability Office issued
a report recently that identified some $45 billion in waste due to
redundant, fragmented and overlapping federal programs.
The
report found 64 actions that the executive branch or Congress could
take to improve efficiency and effectiveness across 26 areas that span
a broad range of government missions and
functions.
The full report can be found
here .
SecDef Hagel Receives Icy Welcome in
Beijing
Further evidence of how poorly President Obama is conducting
American foreign policy was on display in Beijing earlier this
week.
One observer
reported
that Chinas
treatment of Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel telegraphed a relationship
utterly devoid of warmth and very much saddled by
suspicion.
While China is certainly a rival, not only in the Pacific but
also globally, the last thing any of us should want is a return to the
sort of relationship that existed between our two countries prior to
President Nixons historic opening of China in
1972.
Passaic River Clean-up Takes an Important Step
Forward
Earlier today the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) announced a proposed plan for cleaning up literally centuries
of pollution in the lower 8 miles of the Passaic River.
I was
pleased to be part of a bipartisan group of my colleagues in the New
Jersey delegation, including Congressman Bill Pascrell and our two U.S.
senators, in announcing this proposal.
Americas first
industrial center grew up on the Passaic River more than 200 years
ago.
The river helped spark Americas industrial revolution.
But it has paid a heavy price for its role in our countrys economic
growth.
The river is badly polluted and this action is long
overdue.
The EPAs plan, which will soon be open for
public comment, will entail one of the most comprehensive environmental
clean-ups ever proposed.
The plan proposes a bank to bank
clean-up of the river from Newark Bay to a point about 8 miles
upstream.
This is an important step forward for the health of the river and
the communities that share it.
I look forward to seeing the
Passaic restored to its natural beauty once and for
all.
New Jerseys Sesquarcentennial Is Worth Reading
About
Whats a sesquarcentennial? you might be wondering, as I
did.
Its a 350 th
anniversary, and New Jersey is observing
that major milestone this year.
NJ350, which is spearheading
the commemoration of New Jerseys founding back in 1614, recently issued
a list of 101 Great New Jersey Books.
This list is a fabulous
resource for anyone interested in learning more about New Jersey rich
history.
The list can be found
here .

returns right around the corner, the Internal Revenue Service has a

useful for people expecting a refund.

Salute: Jefferson Township Middle
School: One of the Best in Nation Winners in the Verizon Innovative App

Speaking of app challenges, students at
the Jefferson Township Middle School (JTMS) were honored this week as
winners of the Verizon Innovative App Challenge.
Nearly 1,300
submissions were received from around the country, and the JTMS students
"Super Science Girl" app concept is one of just eight winning designs.
The app concept
once built
will create interest in activities
related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) to
encourage young girls to pursue careers in these
fields.
Congratulations to the student team at JTMS for showing the nation that
some of the best and most promising STEM talent in the country can be
