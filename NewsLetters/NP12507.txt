2.3 Million Less Workers
Because of Health Care Law
Last week, the Congressional
Budget Office (CBO) reported that the Affordable Care Act could cost the
country the equivalent of
2.3 million
workers during
the next ten years. In essence, the heath care law will create
disincentives for Americans to find employment, resulting in a reduction in the
labor supply, and leading to lower tax receipts and higher deficits.

read more about the CBO
report.
Our economy isn't struggling because of the efforts of the American
people. Our economy struggles because of bloated, expensive and
destructive bureaucracy that stands in the way of progress. As this government
grows, opportunities for all Americans
shrink.

113,000 , yet the

are looking for onerose to
63 percent

New Legislation to
Help Veterans
Last week, I cosponsored two important
pieces of legislation that directly impact our nation's bravest men and
women. First, the
Veterans
Entrepreneurs Act
will help veterans start a business and
find employment after returning from service abroad. The bill reduces
the costs of starting a franchise and also creates a 25 percent tax
credit to offset the franchise fee individuals are often required to
pay.
Secondly, I believe we can find
savings in the Department of Defense without harming the men and
women who are currently, and voluntarily, serving to protect our nation.
That's why I signed on to support
H.R. 3996 , which prohibits the closing of military
commissaries within the United States as part of the Defense
Department's efforts to find savings. Military commissaries are important and
greatly contribute to the ability of troops to make ends meet when they
return home. We cannot balance the budget on the backs of our military
veterans.

62nd National Prayer
Breakfast
I joined the president and many of my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle for a morning of faith and prayer at the
62nd National Prayer Breakfast
in Washington, DC. For
every year since 1950, the National Prayer Breakfast has been attended by
thousands, including guests from around the
world.
Every U.S. president since President
Dwight Eisenhower has participated, and this year's honored guest was
Rajiv Shah, Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International
Development.
Checking Against an Intrusive
Government
The U.S. Constitution calls for a decennial census
to collect important and specified information pertaining to the U.S.
population.
However, beyond that
10-year requirement, our federal government takes data collecting an
intrusive step beyond the census with the
American Community
Survey (ACS) . The ACS is sent to millions of Americans and
asks many extremely personal and intrusive questions; including how many
bathrooms are in your home, whether or not home owners have mental
illness, or if they have difficulty dressing or bathing. What's even more
appalling is failing to answer and return the survey currently could
lead to a
$5,000
fine .
I've joined several of my colleagues in supporting legislation
that would make this survey voluntary and remove the possibility of a
fine. An expanding and growing government is an intrusive government,
and I will continue to work to keep our federal government in
check.

the ACS voluntary.
K-State President Kirk
Schulz
It was great to visit with Kansas State University
President Kirk Schulz. He traveled to Washington to meet with members of
the Kansas Congressional Delegation, and we discussed the state of
higher education in Kansas. He updated me on the K-State Olathe campus, as
well and invited me to come see the recent changes. We also disussed
the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) and funding for its
construction that was included in the recently-passed House and Senate
budget compromise.
Thanks
to Dr. Schulz - Jayhawks and Wildcats working
together.
Meeting with KS Hospital and Rural Health
Representatives
Early last week, I met with representatives from the
Kansas Hospital Association
and the
National
Rural Health Association . We discussed the impact a number of
regulations from the Affordable Care Act are having on critical access
hospitals in rural Kansas. We also spoke about the need to increase
the number of residency spots for new doctors
Im currently a
cosponsor of
H.R.
1201 , the
Training Tomorrows Doctors Today Act . Rural
hospitals are critical to many of our smaller Kansas
communities.
I appreciate the group
taking the time to meet with me to highlight the important issues they are
facing.
New Baker University
President
I enjoyed meeting with a group from Baker University early
last week in Washington, including current President Dr. Pat Long, and
incoming President Dr. Lynne Murray. Dr. Murray is heading to her new
post at Baker University from Gallaudet University in Washington, DC,
and I had the pleasure of working with her in my role on the Board of
Trustees. Gallaudet University is located in Washington, DC and is
the world's only university specifically designed to accommodate the
Deaf and hard of hearing
students.
I look forward to continuing to work with Dr. Murray in her
new position. Go Wildcats!
Kansas Association of School
Boards
I met with Olathe School Board Member Amy Martin, and Kansas
Association of School Boards members Tom Krebs and Dennis Depew in my
Washington office. We spoke about the impact federal mandates are
having on local school boards, and the challenges they face by
implementing one-size-fits-all models for education that come from Washington,
DC. These standards should be set by local school boards, not by
Washington.
Thank you for visiting
with me about how best we can educate our children in
Kansas.

Fact of the Week
February is
National
African American History
Month .
President Gerald Ford designated February as National African
American History Month in 1976, calling upon the public to "seize the
opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of black
Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our
history."

American History Month.
Going
For Gold I recently signed on to cosponsor
legislation that would exempt Olympic medal winners from paying taxes on
any Olympic medals and earnings they receive if they win. Do you think American athletes
who win an Olympic medal for their country should pay taxes on that
medal? Yes - it's a form
of income and they should pay taxes on Olympic medals if they
win. No - they are competing
for their country, and if they win an Olympic medal, they shouldn't
have to pay taxes to the government on it. *By answering this survey,
