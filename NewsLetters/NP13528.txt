David -- To win a Democratic House majority in 2014, we&rsquo;re going to need the very best Democratic candidates in the country.
As Chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, it&rsquo;s my job to make sure that happens.
Cheri Bustos in Illinois&rsquo; 17th district is exactly the type of leader we need more of in Congress: A champion for the middle class and a fresh voice against Washington gridlock. But here&rsquo;s the thing.
National Republicans know that Cheri is a threat to their obstructionist agenda, and you can bet they&rsquo;re champing at the bit to launch an avalanche of ads in her district.
Cheri must be able to fight back against all the nasty attacks coming her way, but there&rsquo;s only days left before her year-end FEC fundraising deadline. We can&rsquo;t let Cheri fall short. Will you pitch in? Please help Cheri finish 2013 strong by giving $3 or more before the critical December 31st FEC fundraising deadline &gt;&gt;
We&rsquo;re up against the entire right-wing establishment and ALL the cash that comes with it. It won&rsquo;t be easy, but when we stand together, we&rsquo;re one step closer to a Democratic majority.
Don&rsquo;t let Cheri fall behind. Chip in before the deadline: http://action.cheribustos.com/Final-Deadline
Let&rsquo;s do this for Cheri.
