Friend,
&#39;Twas the day of the primary, and all through the halls
of Bera for Congress, folks were making calls
Fliers had been placed upon doorsteps with care
In hopes that the voters would notice them there
The volunteers nestled, all snug on the phone
(This whole thing survives on their power alone)
The hard-working staffers were pacing the floor
And preparing to email supporters once more
When from Ami&#39;s office arose such a clatter
We dropped our laptops to see what was
the matter
He came over to us - not slowly, but quick
We knew at once something was making him tick
&quot;Our supporters!&quot; he said, &quot;Think of all that they&#39;ve done!
I know getting emails all day can&#39;t be fun
But we write and they read, and they give and we thrive
Without them this campaign would never survive!&quot;
&quot;Don&#39;t worry!&quot; the team said, &quot;The day&#39;s almost through.
We&#39;re so near our goal - we know just what to do!
We&#39;ll write them again, but we&#39;ll do it with flair!
It&#39;s primary day! There&#39;s a thrill in the air!&quot;
And so we decided we&#39;d compose this rhyme
The deadline is
midnight
- there&#39;s not much more time
We hope that you&#39;re able to help us again
We know with your help, we&#39;ll be able to win
With that, we conclude our long primary season
We&#39;ve accomplished so much - and friend, YOU are the reason
Thanks for standing with us -
click to help us fight
Happy voting to all, and to all a good night!
Be well,
Team Bera
