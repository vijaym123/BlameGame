On January 28, 2014, President Obama delivered his fifth official
State of the Union Address
before a joint session of Congress.
As part of the speech, the President announced that he will issue an executive order requiring federal contractors to pay their employees $10.10 an hour, and urged Congress to increase the overall federal minimum wage to the same rate.
Supporters believe that raising the minimum wage is necessary to reduce income inequality in our nation and grow the economy because workers will have more money to put back into their local communities.
Those who oppose the increase believe that more regulation from Washington will further burden small businesses - forcing employers to slow hiring and reduce hours - thereby stifling economic growth.
