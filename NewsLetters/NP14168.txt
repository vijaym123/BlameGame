Over and over again, the president and his administration promised the American people that if they liked their health insurance plan, they could keep it. Yet today, nearly 5 million Americans have received letters from their health insurance companies notifying them that their plans will be canceled.
Many of them live in the 5th Congressional District of Texas that I represent. Hardworking Americans like Shelly in Terrell, Jerry in Mabank, William in Dallas, and Joe in Mesquite, all of whom wrote to me after receiving such letters from their insurance companies.
Not only are the American people losing coverage, they are losing confidence in their government and its fumbled health care plan. This is unacceptable.
Sadly, what the President offered yesterday was not an act of apology or understanding to the millions who have and will lose their health care
because under the best case scenario, all he has done is slow the pain and damage being done by his health care bill.
Americans are being forced to purchase health care they do not want, at prices they cannot afford, on a website that does not work. The White House is against this bill, claiming it would sabotage Obamacare, but Americans were promised better, and they deserve better. That is why I voted in favor of the Keep Your Health Plan Act.
Yours respectfully,
