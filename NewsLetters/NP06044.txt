Friend,
Next week, we face our most important deadline yet - our FINAL end of quarter report. The number we post will have a direct and instantaneous effect on how we&#39;re able to run the campaign from now until Election Day.
If we don&#39;t hit this $20,000 goal, we will have to make some cuts.
Please click here and give $5 right now so that it doesn&#39;t come to that.
This morning, my team presented me with some of the options - Will we have to cut ad time? Or send volunteers home? Or cancel our next mailer telling the truth about my record?
This late in the game, we CANNOT be making those kinds of decisions.
We have to hit this goal. Click here and give $5 or $10, right now.
Thanks for understanding the seriousness of this.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
PS - This deadline comes on top of the news that one poll has me down by 4 points. Not only do we need to shore up our budget - we need to close this gap in the polls. We can only do that with your help.
Please click here and give $5 or more now.
