Continuing the Fight to Uphold
the Law
Our
Founding Fathers instilled three branches of government for a specific
purpose; one branch should never have more power over another. Our system
of checks and balances makes sure that each branch stays within its
responsibilities and does not ignore or abuse the rights of the people.
Unfortunately, the executive branch does not understand the basic
principles of our government, and thus President Obamas unlawful
executive actions to delay deportation of up to five million illegal
immigrants, is trampling on the
Constitution.
Thankfully, Georgia is using its judicial power and is one of
twenty six states across the nation that is challenging the
constitutionality of the Presidents executive actions on immigration in court. So
far, a Texas court has placed a temporary injunction halting the
Administration from implementing the executive actions, and at the end of
May, that injunction was upheld in a federal appeals court. The courts
are proving that by acting alone and bypassing the legislative branch,
the Presidents actions are
unlawful.
In addition, the U.S. House has been working on ways to prevent
the president from implementing this executive order in the
legislative branch. In fact, the recently passed Commerce, Justice, Science
Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2016, included an amendment that blocks
the Obama administration from further pursuing its legal defense of
the Presidents unlawful executive actions on immigration. This
amendment had my overwhelming support as it prevented the Obama
Administration from spending more taxpayer dollars to defend an executive action
that the American people do not
want.
President Obama chose to ignore our government system by acting
alone, but the other two branches are working to keep him in check. I
look forward to seeing the results of the lawsuit against this
Administration, and will continue to do my part in the House to prevent these
executive actions from being implemented. Together, the legislative and
judicial branches, will remind President Obama that this is a
democracy, and not a dictatorship.
