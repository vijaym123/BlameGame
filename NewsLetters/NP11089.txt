Friend,
I&#39;ll be quick-- we&#39;re coming down to the wire with our
midnight
deadline.
Our opponents are celebrating the NRCC&#39;s announcement this week, but we can cut the celebration short if we end this fundraising quarter with strong numbers.
We&#39;re only a few hundred dollars away from hitting our goal.
Can you pitch in $10 or more now?

Thanks for all you do.
Have a fabulous day.
Be well, Ami.
