The outcome of this election will be determined by one factor:
Women.
And that scares the Republicans half to death&hellip; but not enough to make them actually change their anti-women policies. They still refuse to pass Equal Pay laws. And they&rsquo;re still perfectly comfortable denying women their basic human right to make decisions about their own bodies.
Instead they&rsquo;re relying on tired, sexist tropes to appeal to us. Women will only vote if voting is like dating, getting married, or breaking up. At least that&rsquo;s what Republicans seem to think.
This election is our chance to show them that their relentless sexism will not stand -- in fact, it will cost them their seats in Congress.
That's why I&rsquo;m emailing you today. I need you to step up right now and make sure that Republicans who rely on sexism will lose on November 4th.
