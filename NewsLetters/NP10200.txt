Rep. Levin Promotes National Prescription Drug Take
Back Day
Community leaders joined Rep. Levin in Royal Oak last week to highlight
DEA National Prescription Drug Take Back Day.
Take Back Day
encourages the proper disposal of prescription drugs through local drop
off points in communities.
It also serves to educate the public
about the growing prevalence of prescription drug abuse and the risks
prescription drugs pose to the environment if disposed of
improperly.
This year, the
Royal Oak Police Department collected 78.5 pounds of unused or aging
medications.
Every pill collected is one less waiting to be
misused.

Rep. Levin Sends Faces of the
Unemployed Appeal to Speaker Boehner
During the course of a few hours last week, as a
result of a simple effort on social media, dozens of Americans submitted
their personal stories about how the expiration of the federal
unemployment insurance program is negatively impacting their families.
Struck by these stories, Rep Levin sent them in this
letter
to Speaker Boehner urging him to let the House take a vote
on the Senate-passed bill to extend UI for five
months.
Ways and
Means Committee Republicans Take Fiscally Irresponsible Action on
Business Taxes
After introducing a deficit neutral tax reform plan just weeks ago,
Chairman Dave Camp moved to extend 6 business tax provisions permanently at
a cost of $310 billion.
To put that figure into context, it
represents more than half of the entire federal deficit this year.
It is more than three times what we spend annually on education, job
training and social services, and five times more than we spend on
veterans, medical research and public health.
While the provisions
enjoy Democratic support, Democrats on the Committee urged Republicans
address all the expired tax provisions in a fiscally responsible
way.

Keeping E-Cigarettes Away from
Kids
On April 24, the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) released rules that would extend its regulatory
authority to cover e-cigarettes.
Under the new rules, minors under
the age of 18 would not be able to purchase e-cigarettes.
Additionally, e-cigarettes would have to come with warning labels saying that
they contain nicotine, which is addictive, and companies would not be
able to assert that e-cigarettes are less harmful than real cigarettes
unless they are able to submit supporting scientific
evidence.
This move by the FDA
reflects growing concern about the use of e-cigarettes, particularly
by minors.
To build on the FDA rules, the House of
Representatives should take up the Protecting Children from Electronic Cigarette
Advertising Act, which Representative Levin has co-sponsored.
This
bill would prohibit advertising or marketing e-cigarettes in a way
that would increase the use of e-cigarettes by a
minor.
Lawmakers
Urge Bangladeshi Government to Improve Working
Conditions
One year after the Rana
Plaza disaster in Bangladesh, in which more than 1100 people died and
2500 were injured when their factory collapsed, Rep. Levin and Rep.
George Miller of California sent a
letter
to the
Prime Minister of Bangladesh to urge improved conditions for the
countrys workers.
The
letter reads: . workers at Rana Plaza feared returning to an unsafe
building with visible cracks, but they were physically coerced and
wages were threatened.
Workers must be empowered to speak
collectively and refuse unsafe working conditions without fear of economic
retaliation.
They had no union and no voice.
We have met with
workers who survived the Rana Plaza building collapse and the family
members of those who did not. Physical and psychological scars remain.
Economic hardship persists. We are committed to ensuring that every
step is taken to ensure that a similar tragedy does not occur
again.
