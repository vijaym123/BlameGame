Dear David,
Here are some facts that may surprise you:
Only 12 percent of low-wage workers are teenagers.
More than a quarter were in 1979.
Women , who make up 49 percent of the workforce,
account for 56 percent of low-wage earners.
One in 10 low-wage workers are college graduates , double the number from 1979.
Working full time at the minimum wage is not enough to keep families out of poverty.
Tonight we will hear President Obama talk about the need to reduce income inequality during his State of the Union address.
Raising the minimum wage is one step we can take right now toward closing this gap while also driving economic growth.
It is unacceptable that millions of people are working full time at the minimum wage but still fall under the poverty line. Clearly it's time for a change.
I want to hear what you think.
Join me on Facebook
before and after tonight&rsquo;s speech to share your thoughts.
Sincerely,
Rick Larsen
United States Representative
Washington State, 2nd Congressional District
PS: I wrote an op-ed on why we need to raise the minimum wage. You can read it in the Bellingham Herald
