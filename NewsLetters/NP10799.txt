Dear Friends,
The House voted this week on a
fiscal year 2015 budget that would help rein in our spending and put our
nation on the path to balancing the budget. I voted yes on this budget,
which passed the House 219-205.
We must put our nation on
a sound fiscal path and end our dependence on deficit spending. This
budget does just that, laying out a fiscally responsible path for the
next 10 years. Families across America rely on balanced budgets to make
ends meet, and our federal government must do the same. By balancing
the budget in 10 years, this legislation will put our nation on a path
to pay off our debt and ensure a better future for our children and
grandchildren.
INVESTING IN WEST VIRGINIA'S
INFRASTRUCTURE
On Wednesday,
I met with leaders and advocates for the King Coal Highway in
southwestern West Virginia. Investment in West Virginias highways is an
investment in West Virginias economy. Completing the King Coal Highway
will help grow the economy, connect communities, and ensure safer travel
for everyone. The House Transportation &amp; Infrastructure Committee
will take up a reauthorization of the highway bill later this year. As
a member of that committee, I will work for a robust highway bill
that will ensure safer, more efficient roads for all.
NO RETROACTIVE
PERMITS FROM THE EPA
I voted yes this week to move
legislation out of committee that would ban the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency from retroactively canceling permits, as the EPA did
with the Spruce Mine permit in Logan County. The House Transportation
&amp; Infrastructure Committee will now send the bill to the House floor
for consideration.
The EPAs retroactive veto of the Spruce
Mine permit sets a dangerous new precedent: No permit is ever final.
When a permit is issued for a new building, a new highway, a new mine,
or a new factory, no one can ever be sure that the permit will remain
in force. Such regulatory uncertainty will have a chilling effect on
investment and make it harder to create jobs in West Virginia and
across the country.
By passing todays legislation, Congress is
saying very clearly that once a permit is issued, a company receiving
it should be allowed to invest in their facilities and hire workers
without the fear that changing winds in Washington will eviscerate
their permit. Congress cannot let the EPAs expansion of its own authority
go unanswered while the jobs of American workers hang in the
balance.
I am a cosponsor of the bill, H.R. 524, which amends the
Clean Water Act to clarify that the EPA does not have the authority to
revoke a permit once the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has issued the
permit. The EPA would only be able to restrict or deny a sites use
before the Corps has issued a permit for the site.
