David --
This year, outside groups hammered our region of Illinois with negative ads. We&rsquo;re sure you saw the ads. But you know what? We still won!
Here&rsquo;s a big reason why: we had the resources to fight back when it mattered most. To date, over 29,000 people have become Founding Members of Cheri&rsquo;s Middle Class Action Fund. Thanks everyone!
Now we have one last big goal to hit: 30,000 Members backing up Cheri before we close out the year. David, it looks like you haven&rsquo;t chipped in to become a Founding Member yet.
This is your last chance to become a Founding Member in 2014.
If you donate any amount before the critical end of year fundraising deadline, we&rsquo;ll mark you down as a Founding Member.
