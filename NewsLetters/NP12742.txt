Dear Friends,
Last night, President Obama delivered a dynamic State of the Union address that was a call to action to get our economy moving.
I had the pleasure of hosting Manuel &ldquo;Manny&rdquo; Santana as my guest in Washington.
Manny is a first-year special education teacher at Clearview High School in Lorain whose personal story fit exactly what the President was trying to convey in his message last night.
Manny had worked at an auto plant and a small manufacturer until he got laid off in 2007. He took advantage of unemployment insurance, including extended benefits, and eventually earned his education degree.
In his speech, the President urged Congress to extend emergency unemployment insurance for at least three months, which would provide benefits for over 2 million Americans when they need it most.
This includes the 1.6 million Americans who have already lost access to these benefits since the program expired at the end of last year.
When we invest in our people, we reap the dividends for many years to come. Manny&rsquo;s experience illustrates the importance of extending employment insurance benefits, especially in a high-unemployment state such as Ohio.
I feel the President laid out an agenda that is achievable and my hope is that Congress will come together to get things done for our country.
From rebuilding our infrastructure to drawing investment back to our country, the jobs we can create here will grow our economy and stabilize our middle class &ndash; and that is a call to action that everyone should agree on.
What was your reaction to the President&rsquo;s State of the Union?
