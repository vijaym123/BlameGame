U.S. Representative Massie Announces 2014 Congressional Art Competition
CRESCENT SPRINGS, KY
U.S Representative Thomas Massie (KY-4) is pleased to invite all high school students from Kentuckys 4th Congressional District to participate in the 2014 Congressional Art Competition.
Since 1982, Members of the U.S. House of Representatives have sponsored the annual Artistic Discovery Contest, a nationwide high school arts competition, to recognize and encourage the artistic talent in the nation.
The winning piece of art from each Congressional District is displayed in a yearlong exhibit within a U.S. Capitol corridor. Winners will also receive two round-trip tickets to Washington, D.C. for the unveiling of their work.
Interested artists can submit their artwork to Congressman Massies Crescent Springs, LaGrange, or Ashland district offices through April 14, 2014. The artwork will be displayed at the Boone County Public Library (main branch) and judged by members of the local art community.
Further information about the program, including guidelines and student release forms, can be found on Congressman Massies website:

Interested applicants can also direct any questions to Carrie Porter at (859) 426-0080.
Residents of the 4th District are welcome to contact Congressman Massie's offices by phone or via massie.house.gov, where they can sign up for e-mail updates.
