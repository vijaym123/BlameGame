Friends,
Alabama's 2nd Congressional District is home to two of the finest
military installations in the country. I take every opportunity to
share with my colleagues in Washington the great things happening at
Fort Rucker in the Wiregrass and Maxwell-Gunter in Montgomery, but
there's no better way to know than to see it for yourself.
This week I am hosting the Chairman of the House Armed Services
Tactical Air and Land Subcommittee, Rep. Michael Turner (R-OH), for a
visit to Fort Rucker
. We'll tour the facilities, meet post leadership, and convene a
panel discussion on the future of Army aviation. While recent
developments make the budget outlook more promising, the impact of
sequestration is still very real. This visit will give us an
opportunity to discuss what lies ahead for Army aviation, and there's
no better place for that discussion than Fort Rucker.
Chairman Turner is an influential leader on matters of defense and
intelligence. His subcommittee has oversight of Army and Air Force
acquisition programs, Navy and Marine Corps aviation programs, as well
as the authorization of procurement, research, and development
programs. This visit will offer Chairman Turner a chance to meet post
leaders, better understand their unique mission, and see first hand the
value Fort Rucker adds to the U.S. Armed Forces.
60 Plus Event
Also this week I am speaking at a special event hosted by the 60 Plus
Association
, a group that advocates on behalf of our nation's
seniors and keeps them informed and engaged in the political process.
Many seniors have serious concerns about the way ObamaCare is affecting
them.
Over the past month, I have heard from hundreds of constituents about
the negative impact ObamaCare is having on them, their families, or
their place of business. Stories included those who have seen their
rates skyrocket, their plans cancelled, or their doctors pushed out of
business - a problem many seniors in particular face. Part of my job is
to be a microphone for these individuals and families and share their
stories publicly in Washington. I appreciate 60 Plus for hosting a
forum where people can come discuss healthcare and learn about the
latest developments.
I will be outlining some of the conservative alternatives to ObamaCare,
such as:
*	Lowering health care premiums through allowing competition
across state lines and ending the abuse of medical malpractice
lawsuits, which are raising costs and driving doctors out of business.
*	Guaranteeing healthcare access for those with a pre-existing
condition.
*	Providing tax credits, deductions, and incentives to give
families the ability to save for and purchase health insurance.
ObamaCare mandates every citizen to purchase health insurance and
forces those who can't afford it into Medicaid. Rather than force
Americans into government assistance, I believe we should remove
barriers and create opportunities for them to get covered at an
affordable price.
NDAA Moves Forward
Political brinkmanship shouldn't keep Congress from fulfilling its
constitutional duty of providing for the common defense. I'm proud that
the House passed the bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA) last week. The legislation authorizes funding for critical
military programs and sets policy for the Department of Defense.
Without it, military families at Maxwell-Gunter and Fort Rucker as well
as other installations like them around the world would have faced much
uncertainty. This year's NDAA provides sound policy for our nation's
military while also ensuring fiscal responsibility.
The Senate is expected to pass the NDAA this week which will then send
the bill to the President's desk for his signature. This will mark the
52ndconsecutive NDAA to be passed by Congress. The legislation includes
two important contributions from my subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations: the future of women and girls in Afghanistan and better
posturing of military assets to respond to global threats, such as the
terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya. The NDAA authorizes funding and
gives special guidance toward these important areas of focus.

sure that you follow me on Twitter. Twitter is a great way for me to
provide short, concise updates on what I am doing in Washington or
where I am in the Second District. I hope you will give me a follow at

debate in Washington, need help with a federal agency, or are planning
a visit to the nation's Capitol, please do not hesitate to contact my
office
. It is an honor to be your voice in Washington.

60
Plus
Event
Also
this
week
I
am
speaking
at
a
special event
hosted
by
the
60
Plus
Association ,
a
group
that
advocates
on
behalf
of
our
nation's seniors and
keeps
them

seniors
have

Over

I
have

from
hundreds

about
the
negative
impact
ObamaCare
is
having
on
them,
their

or

Part

I

Providing

to

ObamaCare
mandates
every
citizen

health
insurance
and
forces
those
who
can&#8217;t
afford
it
into
Medicaid.
Rather
than
force

I

we

NDAA
Moves
Forward
Political
brinkmanship
shouldn&#8217;t
keep
Congress
from
fulfilling
its
constitutional
duty
of
providing
for
the
common
defense. I'm proud
that
the
House
passed
the
bipartisan
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
(NDAA)
last
week.
The
legislation
authorizes
funding
for
critical military programs
and
sets
policy
for
the
Department
of
Defense.
Without
it,
military
families
at
Maxwell-Gunter
and
Fort
Rucker
as
well
as
other
installations
like
them
around
the
world
would
have
faced
much
uncertainty.
This
year&#8217;s
NDAA
provides
sound
policy
for
our
nation&#8217;s
military
while
also
ensuring
fiscal
responsibility.
The
Senate
is
expected
to
pass
the
NDAA
this
week
which
will
then
send
the
bill
to
the
President&#8217;s
desk
for
his
signature.
This
will
mark
the
52 nd consecutive
NDAA
to
be
passed
by
Congress.
The
legislation
includes
two
important
contributions
from
my
subcommittee
on
Oversight
and
Investigations:
the
future
of
women
and
girls
in
Afghanistan
and
better
posturing
of
military
assets
to
respond
to
global
threats,
such
as
the
terrorist
attack
in
Benghazi,
Libya.
The
NDAA
authorizes
funding
and
gives
special
guidance
toward
these
important
areas
of
focus.
