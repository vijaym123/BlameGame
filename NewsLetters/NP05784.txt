<![endif] Dear Friend,
Last week, I was stunned to see a fellow Hoosier threatened with death by the terrorist group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).
Indianapolis native, Abdul-Rahman Kassig, formerly known as Peter Kassig, was captured by ISIL over a year ago while performing humanitarian work in Syria.
Abdul-Rahman bravely served his nation as an Army Ranger, then dedicated himself to providing food and medical supplies to those suffering from violence in Syria.
While the United States and its international partners must stand strong against the brutality of ISIL, it is just as critical to remember the vital work that he was doing when captured.
This brave Hoosier represents the best of our nation.
He felt a strong connection with those suffering in Syria and risked his life to bring them some relief.
His capture should reaffirm the importance of carrying on his effort to bring peace and comfort to those in need.
I ask for continued prayers and support for the Kassig family during this painful time.
As a community we must respect their privacy and keep them in our thoughts during the trying days ahead.
Regards,
