Dear Friend,
We don&rsquo;t have much time left, so I&rsquo;ll be brief. Our FEC pre-primary deadline is at midnight. We&rsquo;re trying to raise $25,000, and we need your help to do it. Can you chip in $5?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Hitting this goal will help our campaign sprint to November. Missing this goal means making some tough choices. Give $5, $10, or whatever you can afford before the clock strikes midnight.
Thank you.
Ed
