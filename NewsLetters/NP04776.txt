Listen, it&rsquo;s been a long road.
But tomorrow is Election Day. And all our work the past few months won&rsquo;t be enough if we don&rsquo;t fight to the finish.
Our race is neck-and-neck -- so close it&rsquo;s quite possible we won&rsquo;t know who the winner is when we wake up Wednesday morning.
But we&rsquo;re not going to stop until every vote is counted. We&rsquo;re in this to WIN.
