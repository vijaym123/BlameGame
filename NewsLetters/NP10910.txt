Subject: they're celebrating
Friend,
I'll be quick-- we're coming down to the wire with our midnight deadline. Our opponents are celebrating the NRCC's announcement this week, but we can cut the celebration short if we end this fundraising quarter with strong numbers.
We're only a few hundred dollars away from hitting our goal. Can you pitch in $10 or more now? You can click here to give:https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/mar14eoq
Thanks for all you do.
Have a fabulous day. Be well, Ami.

Friend,
I wanted to make sure you saw Ami&#39;s email earlier today.
Let&#39;s show our opponents that we can combat their Republican Party support with the power of our grassroots team.
Just over 8 hours until our deadline-- can you pitch in a few dollars here?
Even $3 can make a difference:

This is our first head-to-head test of 2014-- I&#39;m glad we can count on you.
Thanks,
Danny Kazin
