Update from Senator Bob Corker
June 21,
2014
Helping
Tennesseans
Since being elected to office
in 2007, Senator Corker has made access and assistance to Tennesseans a
top priority. Our office has responded to over two million letters
from Tennesseans and helped almost 24,000 individuals and families
resolve issues with the federal government. If you are a resident of
Tennessee and need assistance on issues such as veterans not receiving
benefits or medals they have earned, difficulties with the Social Security
Administration or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,
concerns regarding the IRS or federal taxes, questions about a visa or
passport, or any other challenges you may be experiencing with a federal
agency, please contact one of our six state offices for casework
assistance. You can read more information about how our office can help you
with a federal agency by clicking
here .
Representatives in each of our state offices are trained to help
with questions and concerns you may have. You can find our office
contact information
here
or listed at the bottom of
this newsletter.
Continuing the Hunt Until all Terrorists in the Benghazi Attacks are
Brought to Justice
Senator Corker made the
following statement this week after one of the suspected ringleaders of the
2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi
was captured by
the United States .
Im pleased U.S. personnel safely
apprehended a suspect in the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi and
believe we should make every effort to obtain actionable intelligence
from him before any arraignment occurs," said Corker. "Continuing the
hunt until all those responsible for the attack are brought to justice
is not only important for the victims families but it also sends a
message to others who might seek to attack Americans."
International Child Abduction
Prevention and Return Act
On Thursday, Senator
Corker and Senator Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) introduced the Sean and David
Goldman International Child Abduction Prevention and Return Act to
better address the growing problem of international parental child
abduction when one parent takes a child out of the country in violation of
another parents custodial rights.
Nothing could be more
traumatic for a parent than having a child taken from them to another
country never to return. Our legislation begins to address this problem
on two fronts: first, by seeking to prevent abductions through better
coordination at all levels of law enforcement, and second by helping to
ensure the State Department uses all appropriate tools to secure the
safe return of children who have been torn apart from a parent, said
Senator Corker.
This bill would bolster U.S. policy
regarding international parental child abduction and access cases. The bill
addresses the diverse needs of left-behind parents and families by
bringing greater transparency to the process and making additional
resources available to assist them. It also requires the U.S. government to
establish a specific program to prevent abductions before they
occur.
