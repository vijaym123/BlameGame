Dear David,
You and I know Washington is broken. The federal
government is fraught with wasteful spending, redundant agencies,
burdensome regulations, and confusing bureaucracies that hurt families
and middle class Americans.
Thats why Im fighting each and
every day to make the federal government more transparent and
accountable to you.
This week, I co-sponsored another bill as part
of that fight. The
"Taxpayer Right to Know Act"
increases transparency in Washington by requiring agencies to provide
taxpayers with an annual report card for each of its
programs.
In addition, I've introduced and co-sponsored a number of measures to
address government transparency and accountability,
including:
ENFORCE the Law Act:
I led more than
half of the members of the Senate Republican Conference to introduce the
"Executive Needs to Faithfully Observe and Respect Congressional
Enactments of the Law (ENFORCE the Law) Act." The bill would put a
procedure in place to permit Congress to authorize a lawsuit against the
executive branch for failure to faithfully execute the laws. To read more,

Taxpayer Transparency Act:
I introduced the "Taxpayer
Transparency Act" to require federal agencies to transparently disclose when
taxpayer dollars are used to pay for government advertising. I filed
the bill after it was reported that the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS) planned to spend millions of taxpayer dollars on
an
advertising campaign
to promote the
presidents health care law. To read more,

Regulatory Improvement Act:
I joined U.S. Senator Angus King (Maine) to introduce the Regulatory
Improvement Act, bipartisan legislation to streamline, consolidate,
and repeal onerous and costly government regulations. The bill would
direct Congress to create a Regulatory Improvement Commission, which
would collect broad public input regarding which regulations are
outdated, duplicative, or inefficient. To read more,

Citizen Empowerment
Act:
I introduced the "Citizen Empowerment Act" to restore
Americans trust in government by expanding provisions that allow
individuals to record conversations with executive agency employees. I filed
the bill after it was revealed that Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
officials admitted to targeting conservative organizations and other
Americans. To read more,

Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act:
I co-sponsored the Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by
the IRS Act, which was introduced by U.S. Senators Jeff Flake (Ariz.)
and Pat Roberts (Kan.) and is co-sponsored by 39 additional Senators.
The bill protects the free-speech rights of 501(c)(4) organizations by
prohibiting for one year the finalization of a proposed Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) regulation that would significantly limit the
advocacy and educational activities of these groups. To read more,

REINS
Act:
I co-sponsored the Regulations from the Executive in Need
of Scrutiny (REINS) Act, which was introduced by U.S. Senator Rand
Paul (Ky.). The REINS Act would require Congress to approve every new
major rule proposed by the executive branch, which has an annual
economic impact of $100 million or more, before it can be enforced on the
American people. To read more,

Government Employee Accountability
Act:
I introduced the "Government Employee Accountability Act" to
give executive agencies the ability to effectively deal with Senior
Executive Service (SES) employees, and provide Congress with more
oversight. To read more,
