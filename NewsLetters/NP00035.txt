VISITING DC
June 21, 2015
Yesterday, after years of
denial,
the VA announced that it will finally give
benefits and health care to veterans
who were exposed to Agent
Orange on contaminated military planes. It has been a long fight but
I'm pleased our vets are finally getting
justice.
The effort of these veterans to secure overdue VA care
and benefits for harmful exposure to Agent Orange has not been one of
the agencys finest hours. This frustrating, four year process has
laid bare the lengths that the VA will go to disregard science and the
facts of the historical record. I am pleased Secretary McDonald has
chosen to finally do the right thing for these ailing veterans, but it
shouldn't have been this hard or taken so
long.

Orange

On
Tuesday , I continued to press VA Secretary Bob McDonald on
the recent failures to provide medical services to veterans at the
Wilmington clinic due to water safety problems.
In a
letter, I outlined my concerns: While VA says that it is referring patients
requiring urgent care procedures to community providers at VA
expense, I have heard from concerned veterans who tell me VA is not fully
honoring its commitment to refer urgent care patients to community
providers and that patients are, in some cases, being required to travel
beyond forty miles to receive care at the Fayetteville VA Medical Center.
I understand that Fayettevilles forty mile radius and Wilmingtons
overlap to some extent, but if this overlap is part of the reasoning
for having veterans travel further for care which is available
locally, it defies common sense and may also defy good medical sense.
Ive requested for a July briefing with VA so they can answer
my concerns. You can read my letter in full

This week I joined CNNs The Situation Room with
Wolf Blitzer to discuss the Islamic States progress in the Middle
East.
On the Islamic States strategy, I noted ISIL has
dominated because of the battlefield strategies that they have. ISIL
actually pays their fighters. ISIL has a recruiting mechanism thats almost
as good as in the U.S. ISIL has special forces like the U.S. So to
not call this an army is a real mistake.
Regarding the
Presidents strategy to fight the Islamic State, I dont think there is a
strategy to defeat ISIL, I think the President has said that there
isnt a strategy.
I also reiterated my expectation that a
full accounting of Irans nuclear program must happen before America
could strike any deal with Iran, Without a baseline to work from, how in
the world can the United States find a way forward with
Iran?

This week, the
Senate voted on the passage of the National Defense Authorization Act
of Fiscal Year 2016 by a vote of 71-15.
Im pleased that
the Senate has acted to ensure that our military has sufficient
resources to combat Americas enemies and provide security across the globe,
and ensured our troops are properly compensated. Every day, service
members fight to secure our freedoms and our forces must have the
resources they need to keep our country safe. North Carolina alone is home
to 8 bases and several installations, so maintaining these facilities
is critical for the state, as well as our nations
readiness.
Additionally, the Authorization bills amendment, which I
co-sponsored with Senator Tillis, will continue
the
C-130 presence at North Carolinas Fort Bragg Pope Airfield . I hope
President Obama will see the strong bipartisan support for this bill
and lift his veto threat against it. You can read News &amp; Observers

Finally, I had the pleasure of joining Autism
Speaks at their Leadership Summit Gala this week. In attendance were
advocates, members of the Autism community, lawmakers, and other supporters
of the movement. It was wonderful to gather with the Autism Speaks
community and hear about some of their triumphs. I was even lucky enough
to run into a current Demon Deacon! You can see photos of the event
here .
Sincerely,
Richard Burr
