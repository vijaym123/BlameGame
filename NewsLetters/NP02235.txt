Dear
Friend,
Each
spring, my office hosts an art competition for high school students
interested in showing off their artistic skills, and every year I am so
impressed by the talent of the young artists in our district. I look
forward to seeing the artwork on display in my offices and in the tunnel
of the Capitol building every time I go to
vote.
Interested students should submit one original piece of two-dimensional
work, which should be no bigger than 28 x 28 x 4 when framed.
Entries can be dropped off at my offices in Aurora or Joliet.
Click here
for more
information on the competition and to
register.
The deadline for submissions is April 15,
2015.
Consider forwarding
this email or tell your friends and family to
sign up
here
to receive updates on the work we're doing in
Washington, DC and at home in Illinois.
Remember, I am here to work for you. If you have any questions,
or concerns please feel free to
e-mail me ,
call our office, or connect with me on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Bill
Foster
