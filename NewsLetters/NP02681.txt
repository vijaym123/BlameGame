Dear Friend,
President Obama's comments at this month's
National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C., where he compared Islamic
State atrocities today to events 1000 years ago, were so far removed
from reality that I simply had to put my thoughts on paper. The
Washington Times published them, in my recent opinion piece for the national
conservative newspaper, last Tuesday.
Read the entire piece, excerpted below, at
this link,
and please email this newsletter to your friends and
neighbors, as I believe too few understand the extent of Christian
persecution -- and that of other religious minorities in the Middle East --
which the President is ignoring and excusing, rather than confronting
head-on:
***
DOWNPLAYING
ATTACKS ON CHRISTIANS
"The Islamic
State, or ISIS, just released its latest online snuff video on
Sunday. It makes for disgusting viewing and tells us all we really
need to know about the folks who are wreaking havoc in the Middle
East in the name of Allah. In it, ISIS barbaric 'warriors'
line up and behead 21 Egyptian Christians on a beach in Libya. In case
any of us in the West cannot comprehend why they do what they do,
one of the executioners is seen in the video proclaiming the act
a message signed in blood to the nation of the
cross.
"That proclamation had to be aimed directly at the
president of the United States, who just cant seem to accept the
fact that whats going on over there is not mere thuggery, but a
religious war. Could the message be any clearer to President
Obama? The Islamic State is waging global jihad against Christians,
Jews, Shiites, Yazidis and any other any other group that does not
subscribe to its medieval worldview
even if he and his
administration are incapable of uttering the words 'Islamic' and 'terrorism'
in the same sentence."
