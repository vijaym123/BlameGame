Friend,
On Monday,
I sent a letter cosigned by 76 Democratic House colleagues
to Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Director Mel Watt urging him to impose a moratorium on foreclosures for individuals who have lost their emergency unemployment compensation due to congressional inaction.
The letter requests that Director Watt direct the Government Sponsored Enterprises - Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac- to implement a six-month forbearance on loan payments of GSE-guaranteed mortgages for borrowers who have lost their unemployment insurance. Borrowers must have been in good standing prior to losing their unemployment insurance.
Since December 28, due to congressional inaction, more than 2 million Americans have lost unemployment insurance.
Every week, another 72,000 people join their ranks, but Congress has been unable to come to an agreement to restore this essential support.
These hardworking, responsible Americans lost their jobs, and now their last lifeline--unemployment insurance--through no fault of their own. They should not lose their homes as well.
