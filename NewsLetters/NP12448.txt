VISITING DC
February 07, 2014
This week, the Raleigh News &amp;
Observer ran an editorial attacking the Patient CARE Act, my proposal to
repeal Obamacare and replace it with patient-centered reforms of our
health care system that are actually affordable.
Throughout the
editorial, they mischaracterized the proposal, and mislead their
readers about the plan and its contents.
In an attempt to set the
record straight, I prepared a responsea response the News &amp; Observer
said they would be happy to run, if the length was cut in half.
As this is a complicated, multi-faceted plan that requires a full
explanation, I felt it better to offer up my full response here instead.
Thank you for reading.
Sincerely,
Richard Burr
When the health care debate began, I
warned that the Presidents health care bill was the wrong direction for
our nation and North Carolina.
I offered an alternative thenThe
Patients' Choice Actalong with Senator Tom Coburn because health
care was broken before Obamacare.
Unfortunately, as a result of its
implementation, things are worse today than they were before.
Going back to the way our health care system looked before is not an
option, but neither is continuing on the current course of increased
costs, government mandates, and broken promises.
The President
and Congressional Democrats made many promises during the health care
debate. Since the laws enactment, North Carolinians have felt the
adverse effect of one broken promise after
another.
There is no denying that the dire predictions from the debate have come
true.
Just ask the millions of Americans who lost the plans they
liked after being promised they could keep them.
Or the families
nationwide who were promised that their annual premiums would go down
by $2,500, but have seen premiums go up an average of 41 percent in
the individual market.
It seems like every day another
employer reduces hours or stops offering insurance in response to
Obamacares mandates.
These mandates are hurting our economy and
families.
The Presidents $2.6 trillion budget busting law
used Medicare to fund new entitlements we cant afford and expanded the
Medicaid programa program that nationally some 40 percent of
physicians do not even see Medicaid patientsinstead
of reforming it to
better meet patients needs now and in the future. As Governor Perdue
warned, Obamacares taxes on life-saving medical products threaten our
nationsand North Carolinasstanding as a global leader in medical
innovation.
Its clear that the current course is
unsustainable.
Fortunately, for families across North Carolina and our
nation, we can lower costs and empower patients in their health care
choices and decisions.
In stark contrast to Obamacare, the
Patient CARE Act, a proposal I unveiled last week with my colleagues
Senator Tom Coburn, a physician, and Senator Orrin Hatch, is based on
principles that will lower costs and expand access to quality coverage and
care by empowering Americans to make their own health care decisions,
rather than empowering government to make decisions for them.
First, the Patient CARE Act repeals
Obamacarethrowing
out the burdensome, costly mandates and government regulations and
adopting common-sense consumer protections, including prohibiting
life-time benefit caps and allowing dependents to stay on their parents
plans until age 26.
Under my plan, no individual could be denied
coverage based on a pre-existing condition.
My plan
addresses a distortion in the tax code that drives up health care costs. We
cap the exclusion of an employees employer-provided health care at 65
percent of the total cost of the most generous employer plans on the
market, like union plans.
Everyone with employer-sponsored health
insurance under that amount wont see any change in the tax treatment
of their benefit.
Unlike Obamacares Cadillac tax, which
imposes an across the board 40 percent excise tax on the richest benefit
plans regardless of an individuals income, under my plan the employees
health benefit above the threshold would be treated as regular income
for that employee.
And as Ryan Ellis with Americans for Tax
Reform pointed out this week, my plan will produce a net tax
cut.
Every American and every health plan is taxed under
Obamacare.
Targeted tax credits, adjusted for age and income, will give
individuals purchasing power and the opportunity to choose a plan that
meets their specific needs.
Because we lower costs through
medical malpractice reform and increased transparency, these dollars will
go further.
My plan modernizes Medicaid through a capped
allotment, an idea brought forward by the Clinton Administration, to
provide states with predictable funding while empowering them with
programmatic flexibility to better meet their patients needs.
Under
my plan, a Medicaid beneficiary could choose to opt-out of Medicaid and
use their tax credit to purchase a plan that better meets their
needs. Obamacare failed to reform Medicaid and put this already strained
program at greater risk.
Defenders of Obamacare claim
that there are no alternatives but alternatives existed at the time of
the debate and they exist today.
Yes, my plan repeals Obamacare,
but it also replaces it with reforms that address what was broken
before Obamacare, as well as what has been made worse because of it.
Opponents who incorrectly characterize my plan as the same old insurance
system we had before Obamacare do so as a scare tactic because to
acknowledge that there is an alternative that lower costs, increases
choices, and covers Americans with pre-existing conditions is to admit that
there is a better way than Obamacare.
North
Carolinians will find the Patient CARE Act is an alternative they can believe
in because we believe citizens, not the government, know whats best
for themselves and their families
