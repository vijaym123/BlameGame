Dear David,
This week, I had the privilege of being sworn in to serve Oregon for a
new term in the U.S. Senate. As I look ahead to the challenges and
opportunities of the next six years, I wanted to let you know directly
from me what my priorities will be.
I came to the Senate to fight for our middle class, and growing and
strengthening America's middle class will continue to be my top
priority.
The work ahead won't always be easy, but our goals are clear:
*	We must create good, living-wage jobs that grow the middle
class and provide a solid foundation for our families.
*	We must take on the soaring cost of college and ensure that
each and every American is able to get a high-quality, affordable
education, from pre-K to college and beyond.
*	We need to fight back against efforts to privatize or dismantle
Social Security and Medicare, and pursue policies that will provide
greater retirement security for all Americans.
*	And we must continue the fight to reform what is so broken in
Washington, D.C. and to make America work for working Americans.
And of course, I'll keep fighting for every corner of Oregon and our
Oregon priorities - from port dredging and saving the Newport
helicopter on the coast, to implementing water-sharing agreements in
Central Oregon and the Klamath Basin, to pursuing smarter forest
management policies and continuing to protect Oregon's rural post
offices.
It's been a great honor to serve Oregon in the Senate for the last six
years. And thanks to the input and partnership of folks like you, those
six years proved that even in a gridlocked Congress, there's a lot that
can be done with hard work, perseverance, and community support.
I hope you'll continue to reach out to me with your thoughts and ideas
as we take on this new chapter together. I'm excited to get to work for
Oregon and our middle class in the new Congress, and I hope you are too.
Let's get to work!
All my best,
Jeff

Dear
David,
This
week,
I
had
the
privilege
of
being
sworn
in
to
serve
Oregon
for
a
new
term
in
the
U.S.
Senate.
As
I
look
ahead
to
the
challenges
and
opportunities
of
the
next
six
years,
I
wanted
to
let
you
know
directly
from
me
what
my
priorities
will
be.
I
came
to
the
Senate
to
fight
for
our
middle
class,
and
growing
and
strengthening
America's
middle
class
will
continue
to
be
my
top
priority.
The
work
ahead
won't
always
be
easy,
but
our
goals
are
clear:
We
must
create
good,
living-wage
jobs
that
grow
the
middle
class
and
provide
a
solid
foundation
for
our
families.
We
must
take
on
the
soaring
cost
of
college
and
ensure
that
each
and
every
American
is
able
to
get
a
high-quality,
affordable
education,
from
pre-K
to
college
and
beyond.
We
need
to
fight
back
against
efforts
to
privatize
or
dismantle
Social
Security
and
Medicare,
and
pursue
policies
that
will
provide
greater
retirement
security
for
all
Americans.
And
we
must
continue
the
fight
to
reform
what
is
so
broken
in
Washington,
D.C.
and
to
make
America
work
for
working
Americans.
And
of
course,
I'll
keep
fighting
for
every
corner
of
Oregon
and
our
Oregon
priorities
&ndash;
from
port
dredging
and
saving
the
Newport
helicopter
on
the
coast,
to
implementing
water-sharing
agreements
in
Central
Oregon
and
the
Klamath
Basin,
to
pursuing
smarter
forest
management
policies
and
continuing
to
protect
Oregon's
rural
post
offices.
It's
been
a
great
honor
to
serve
Oregon
in
the
Senate
for
the
last
six
years.
And
thanks
to
the
input
and
partnership
of
folks
like
you,
those
six
years
proved
that
even
in
a
gridlocked
Congress,
there's
a
lot
that
can
be
done
with
hard
work,
perseverance,
and
community
support.
I
hope
you'll
continue
to
reach
out
to
me
with
your
thoughts
and
ideas
as
we
take
on
this
new
chapter
together.
I'm
excited
to
get
to
work
for
Oregon
and
our
middle
class
in
the
new
Congress,
and
I
hope
you
are
too.
Let's
get
to
work!
All
my
best,
Jeff
