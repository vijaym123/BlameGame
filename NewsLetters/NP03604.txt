Dear
Friends,
This morning I was live on air with KDKA Radio host
Marty Griffin to discuss my
Helping Families in
Mental Health Crisis Act .
One caller told me about the
challenge he faces in caring for his veteran brother who has been
diagnosed with post-traumatic stress. Another shared with me an inspirational
story of recovery as he had received medical treatment for his
bipolar disorder. Hearing these stories of tragedy and triumph motivate me
to continue our efforts to rebuild our nations broken mental health
system.
The holiday season brings us a spirit of joy and
celebration, but for families in mental health crisis, the next few
weeks can be very difficult. The National Alliance on Mental Illness has
put together a useful set of tips to help those feeling the blues or
suffering from depression. Click

As all of you take time to be with your friends and
loved ones this week and next, I wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy
New Year.
Sincerely,
Tim Murphy
Member of
Congress
