Wicker: Americans Refute
President's
Claim They Are 'Better
Off'
Most Say Their Financial Situations
Have
Stayed the Same or Gotten
Worse
President Obama wants Americans to believe that their lives
have improved since he took office.
In a September interview with
"60 Minutes," he deflected criticism about his record by referencing
Ronald Reagan's memorable line from a 1980 presidential debate with
Jimmy Carter: "Are you better off than you were four years ago?"
President Obama asserted that the country is "definitely better off"
today than it was six years ago.
Most Americans, however, disagree
with this wishful thinking.
A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll shows only 22 percent of
Americans believe they are better off financially than before President
Obama took office.
Nearly a third of the poll's respondents said
they are worse off, and most said their financial circumstances are
about the same.
The Obama Administration likes to tout a lower
national unemployment rate as proof of success, but Americans are not
feeling the effects of a recovery in their daily
lives.
The Problem
With
Underemployment
Officials at the Federal Reserve have acknowledged that the health of
the job market is still lacking.
In a statement last month,
they noted the "significant underutilization of labor resources."
Although joblessness is 5.9 percent, according to the Department of
Labor, the percentage of working-age Americans who have a job or are
actively looking for one is the lowest it has been since February 1978,
when Jimmy Carter was in office.
The unemployment rate fails to
capture the number of Americans who have grown discouraged with the job
market and given up looking for work entirely.
It also does not
reflect whether those who are employed are satisfied with their jobs
or the number of hours they are able to
work.
When participation in the American labor force drops to a
level not seen in 36 years, something is wrong.
Those who have
left the workforce may not be counted among the unemployed, but neither
are they contributing to the economy as they once
did.
Other indicators of underemployment are
the millions of Americans with part-time work who want a full-time job
and those who are overqualified for their jobs.
According to a
report released this year by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
recent years have seen a substantial rise in the number of college
graduates who are taking jobs that do not require a bachelor's degree.
In 2012, 44 percent of recent graduates were underemployed in this
way.
Reagan Recovery vs. Obama
Economy
Underemployment needs to be addressed to achieve
a strong, lasting economic recovery.
This means giving job
creators the ability and confidence to put Americans back to work, rather
than forcing them to cut employee hours to avoid burdensome government
mandates.
Under Ronald Reagan, who championed tax cuts and
regulatory reform, economic growth averaged 3.5 percent annually.
Since President Obama took office and ushered in a big-government
agenda, average economic growth has been an anemic 1.2 percent each year.
Agenda Without
Results
It is no surprise, then, that President Obama's
misguided policies have alienated members of his own party.
Many
Democratic candidates have distanced themselves from him in the run-up to the
November elections.
However, in an interview this month with
the Rev. Al Sharpton, the President said, "These are all folks who vote
with me; they have supported my agenda in Congress."
Despite the President's repeated rhetoric
about the economy, his agenda has not produced positive results or a
sustainable recovery.
Americans are right to wonder whether they
are indeed better off.
They want to see leadership in Washington
that will help make a constructive difference in their daily lives.
