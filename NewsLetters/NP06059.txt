Dear Friends,
I supported three bills that will
work to improve South Floridas VA facilities and veteran care. Our
veterans deserve the highest quality facilities and care available. Their
selfless sacrifices for our nation are the epitome of public service.
While we can never repay the courage shown by these brave men and
women, the very least we can do is ensure the facilities dedicated to
treating them and programs designed to serve them work correctly and
efficiently.
I know the difficulties veterans face because my
husband, Dexter, is a combat veteran who volunteered for service and
sustained serious injuries while serving our country in Vietnam. Currently
Marine Reservists, my step-son, Doug, and daughter-in-law, Lindsay,
served our nation as Marine officers in Iraq and Lindsay also served in
Afghanistan.
The bills I supported in order to ensure our
veterans receive the proper care
are:
the VA Construction Assistance Act, which will
reform management and increase oversight of the construction of VA
facilities in order to reduce delays and improve their quality
;
the Veterans
Traumatic Brain Injury Improvement Act, which would modify the assessment
reports for an assisted living pilot program for veterans suffering from
traumatic brain injuries;
and
the Veterans Compensation Cost-of-Living
Adjustment Act, which would increase compensation rates for veterans with
service-related injuries and for survivors of veterans with certain
disabilities.
Our nation was built on the sacrifices of those who
fought for our liberty. I am proud to fight for our veterans and to
continue to honor the brave men and women who dedicated their lives to
ensuring our freedoms will continue for generations to come.
Sincerely,
Ileana
