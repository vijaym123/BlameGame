Don't Forget to Get Your Flu Shot!
With the winter months heading our way, its important to prepare for the oncoming cold and flu season. Although the Ebola virus has been in the media spotlight recently, I wanted to remind you and your family on taking necessary steps to prevent common wintertime viruses, like the flu.
Getting a flu shot is quick and easy; and, can be done at your local pharmacy or physician's office.
In fact, just last month, I received my flu shot at the Grandview Heights Walgreen's.
I hope that you and your family join me in getting a flu shot to ensure a healthy and safe winter in the Buckeye state!
