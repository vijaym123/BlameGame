Updates and Accomplishments
This week, National Journal released its annual rankings for members of
Congress, and I was ranked as the 13th most conservative representative
out of 435 members.
I think this ranking accurately reflects the conservative values of our
district - one of the most conservative districts in the nation.
I'm
honored to be recognized in the top 5% of Congress, but I'm even more
honored to represent the people who sent me to Washington to stand firm
against President Obama and Harry Reid's liberal agenda.
I'm proud to
promote the values of Texas' 25th District, and I look forward to
continuing our fight in 2014.
If you would like to see the great work my staff and I were able to
accomplish last year, I have published my 2013 Year End Report.
Among
many other things, I cast 641 votes with a 99% attendance rate,
authored and introduced 3 bills, co-sponsored 71 bills, closed 222
cases with federal agencies on behalf of constituents, responded to
30,247 pieces of correspondence from constituents, and held or attended
more than 166 events in the 25th District. You can view the report here

Tax Season
Since Texas does not have a state income tax, Texans have been able to
deduct state and local sales taxes for the last few years when filing
their federal taxes.
This puts Texas on a more level playing field
with other states who can deduct state and local income taxes when
filing.
While you will be able to deduct sales taxes for this year, this sales
tax deduction was not renewed in Congress, meaning it could impact your
taxes in the future.
I'm working to fix this issue before it becomes a
problem next year.
I have co-sponsored H.R. 2854, a bill that would
simply amend the tax code to make the sales tax deduction permanent for
states that do not have local and state income taxes.
This is just one more example highlighting the need for a complete
overhaul of our overly complicated tax code.
While I do not think we
will see tax reform come up before the end of the year while the
Democrats hold the Senate and White House, it is one of the most
important issues that needs to be addressed soon.

Obama vs. the Catholic Church
This week, the retail chain CVS announced its decision to stop selling
cigarettes at its stores.
President Obama praised the store for "saving
lives and protecting untold numbers of families from pain and
heartbreak for years to come."
Is President Obama now saying that corporations are allowed to have
values and express themselves?
If so, he should immediately exempt the
religious organizations who say the Obamacare requirement to offer
abortion drugs and contraceptive coverage violates their religious
beliefs.
Just weeks ago, the Obama administration asked the Supreme
Court to not exempt Catholic groups from this Obamacare requirement,
even though the President has already offered exemptions and wavers to
thousands of businesses.
It's time for this administration to end its
attack on the Catholic Church.

A dreary budget outlook
This week the House Budget Committee, which I am a member of, conducted
a hearing with the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) Director Douglas
Elmendorf on the nonpartisan CBO's recently released Budget and
Economic Outlook report.
These are a few of the report's key findings:
1) Revenue in 2014 is on track to exceed its historic average of 17.4
percent of GDP.
2) The deficit will again top $1 trillion by 2022.
3) Interest on the national debt will quadruple over the next decade.
4) By 2021, Obamacare will cause a "reduction in full-time-equivalent
employment of about 2.3 million."
5) Obamacare "will reduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by
about 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024."
The largest decline will occur among "lower-wage workers."
6) Obamacare "will cause a reduction of roughly 1 percent in aggregate
labor compensation over the 2017-2024 period."
This doesn't sound like a rebounding economy that can support a
thriving middle class.
These budget woes and Obamacare mandates are
taking a toll on families and businesses everywhere.
A recent CNN
Money report showed 75% of Americans are living from paycheck to
paycheck with little to no emergency savings, while only 68% of the
entire adult population is participating in the labor market.
I will
continue urging my colleagues in the Senate to pass the dozens of
House-passed, pro-jobs bills to get our economy moving in the right
direction.

Updates
and
Accomplishments
This
week,
National
Journal
released
its
annual
rankings
for
members
of
Congress,
and
I
was
ranked
as
the
13th
most
conservative
representative
out
of
435
members.
I
think
this
ranking
accurately
reflects
the
conservative
values
of
our
district
&#8211;
one
of
the
most
conservative
districts
in
the
nation.
I&#8217;m
honored
to
be
recognized
in
the
top
5%
of
Congress,
but
I&#8217;m
even
more
honored
to
represent
the
people
who
sent
me
to
Washington
to
stand
firm
against
President
Obama
and
Harry
Reid&#8217;s
liberal
agenda.
I&#8217;m
proud
to
promote
the
values
of
Texas&#8217;
25th
District,
and
I
look
forward
to
continuing
our
fight
in
2014.
If
you
would
like
to
see
the
great
work
my
staff
and
I
were
able
to
accomplish
last
year,
I
have
published
my
2013
Year
End
Report.
Among
many
other
things,
I
cast
641
votes
with
a
99%
attendance
rate,
authored
and
introduced
3
bills,
co-sponsored
71
bills,
closed
222
cases
with
federal
agencies
on
behalf
of
constituents,
responded
to
30,247
pieces
of
correspondence
from
constituents,
and
held
or
attended
more
than
166
events
in
the
25th
District.
You
can
view
the
report
here .
Tax
Season
Since
Texas
does
not
have
a
state
income
tax,
Texans
have
been
able
to
deduct
state
and
local
sales
taxes
for
the
last
few
years
when
filing
their
federal
taxes.
This
puts
Texas
on
a
more
level
playing
field
with
other
states
who
can
deduct
state
and
local
income
taxes
when
filing.
While
you
will
be
able
to
deduct
sales
taxes
for
this
year,
this
sales
tax
deduction
was
not
renewed
in
Congress,
meaning
it
could
impact
your
taxes
in
the
future.
I&#8217;m
working
to
fix
this
issue
before
it
becomes
a
problem
next
year.
I
have
co-sponsored
H.R.
2854,
a
bill
that
would
simply
amend
the
tax
code
to
make
the
sales
tax
deduction
permanent
for
states
that
do
not
have
local
and
state
income
taxes.
This
is
just
one
more
example
highlighting
the
need
for
a
complete
overhaul
of
our
overly
complicated
tax
code.
While
I
do
not think
we
will
see
tax
reform
come
up before
the
end
of
the
year while
the
Democrats
hold
the
Senate
and
White
House,
it
is
one
of
the
most
important
issues
that
needs
to
be
addressed
soon.
Obama
vs.
the
Catholic
Church
This
week,
the
retail
chain
CVS
announced
its
decision
to
stop
selling
cigarettes
at
its
stores.
President
Obama
praised
the
store
for
&#8220;saving
lives
and
protecting
untold
numbers
of
families
from
pain
and
heartbreak
for
years
to
come.&#8221;
Is
President
Obama
now
saying
that
corporations
are
allowed
to
have
values
and
express
themselves?
If
so,
he
should
immediately
exempt
the
religious
organizations
who
say
the
Obamacare
requirement
to
offer
abortion
drugs
and
contraceptive
coverage
violates
their
religious
beliefs.
Just
weeks
ago,
the
Obama
administration
asked
the
Supreme
Court
to
not
exempt
Catholic
groups
from
this
Obamacare
requirement,
even
though
the
President
has
already
offered
exemptions
and
wavers
to
thousands
of
businesses.
It&#8217;s
time
for
this
administration
to
end
its
attack
on
the
Catholic
Church.
A
dreary
budget
outlook
This
week
the
House
Budget
Committee,
which
I
am
a
member
of,
conducted
a
hearing
with
the
Congressional
Budget
Office
(CBO)
Director
Douglas
Elmendorf
on
the
nonpartisan
CBO&#8217;s
recently
released
Budget
and
Economic
Outlook
report.
These
are
a
few
of
the
report&#8217;s
key
findings:
1)
Revenue
in
2014
is
on
track
to
exceed
its
historic
average
of
17.4
percent
of
GDP. 2)
The
deficit
will
again
top
$1
trillion
by
2022. 3)
Interest
on
the
national
debt
will
quadruple
over
the
next
decade. 4)
By
2021,
Obamacare
will
cause
a
&#8220;reduction
in
full-time-equivalent
employment
of
about
2.3
million.&#8221; 5)
Obamacare
&#8220;will
reduce
the
total
number
of
hours
worked,
on
net,
by
about
1.5
percent
to
2.0
percent
during
the
period
from
2017
to
2024.&#8221;
The
largest
decline
will
occur
among
&#8220;lower-wage
workers.&#8221; 6)
Obamacare
&#8220;will
cause
a
reduction
of
roughly
1
percent
in
aggregate
labor
compensation
over
the
2017&#8211;2024
period.&#8221;
This
doesn&#8217;t
sound
like
a
rebounding
economy
that
can
support
a
thriving
middle
class.
These
budget
woes
and
Obamacare
mandates
are
taking
a
toll
on
families
and
businesses
everywhere.
A
recent
CNN
Money
report
showed
75%
of
Americans
are
living
from
paycheck
to
paycheck
with
little
to
no
emergency
savings,
while
only
68%
of
the
entire
adult
population
is
participating
in
the
labor
market.
I
will
continue
urging
my
colleagues
in
the
Senate
to
pass
the
dozens
of
House-passed,
pro-jobs
bills
to
get
our
economy
moving
in
the
right
direction.
