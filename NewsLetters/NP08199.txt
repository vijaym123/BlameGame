Happy Independence Day!
Today, with BBQ, fireworks and parades, we carry on the great tradition envisioned by John Adams in 1776:
"It ought to be commemorated, as the Day of Deliverance by solemn Acts of Devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more."
As the celebration begins, may we remember our heritage with pride, keep in our hearts all who sacrificed to preserve our way of life, and reaffirm our solemn obligation to carry the torch of freedom forward from one generation to the next.
What a blessing and privilege it is to be an American!
Freedom First,
P.S.
