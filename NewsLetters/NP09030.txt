House of Representatives Passes Two Pieces of Legislation Submitted by
Rep. Mark Takano
Last month, the United States House of Representatives passed two
pieces of legislation submitted by Representative Mark Takano (D-CA) as
amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act.
The Work for Warriors Act (H.R. 4364), introduced with Rep. Paul Cook
(R-CA), will create a pilot program to explore the replication and
expansion of California's WFW model nationwide. These direct employment
pilot programs would enhance the efforts of the Department of Defense
to provide employment services to members of the Guard and Reserve.
The second amendment would require the Secretary of Defense to report
to Congress, no later than 30 days after enactment of this law, on the
barriers to implementing audit reporting requirements and
recommendations to ensure reporting deadlines are met.
"I'm proud that Republicans and Democrats came together to approve
these pieces of legislation," said Takano. "The Work for Warriors
program in California is a successful, cost-effective model for putting
our heroes back to work. By creating a pilot program to explore its
expansion nationwide, we can replicate its success. It is also
important to ensure that taxpayer money is being well spent at the
Department of Defense. With the Department of Defense consuming such a
large portion of our budget, we must have an accurate and timely audit
its finances."
Created by the state of California in 2012, the Work for Warriors
program set out to reduce unemployment amongst California National
Guard members by 25 percent. Since then, the program has placed more
than 2,400 guard members in jobs - and at a fraction of the cost. Some
federal veterans' employment programs cost as much as $10,000 per
placement. The Work for Warriors program, however, costs only $500 per
placement.
Last month, the Department of Defense agreed to an additional $1
million in funding to the Work for Warriors Program.

While placing the flags, Takano said, "Memorial Day is a day for us to
honor the brave men and women who gave their lives while serving our
country. Thank you to all who made the ultimate sacrifice while
defending our freedoms."

Rep. Takano Statement on the Resignation of Secretary of Veterans
Affairs General Eric Shinseki
Rep. Mark Takano, the Ranking Member of House Veterans' Affairs
Economic Opportunity Subcommittee released the following statement
after the resignation of Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric
Shinseki:
"General Shinseki has served his country for decades and I admire his
dedication toward our veterans. But with the recent revelations that
some VA facilities were hiding wait times and using secret wait lists,
I believe that his decision to resign as Secretary of Veterans Affairs
will help the investigation, as it can now proceed without distraction.
It is my hope that the investigation will be completed swiftly, and
reforms that will treat our veterans with the care and respect they
deserve will be implemented as soon as possible."

&#8220;General

But
with

It

will
be
completed
swiftly,
and
reforms
that
