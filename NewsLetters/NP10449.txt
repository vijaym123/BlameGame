ON THE ISSUES
LEGISLATIVE
April 22, 2014
D e ar Friends,
We
must do more to protect the
environment.
We have witnessed the devastating effects of Hurricane Sandy, and my
fear is that we may soon see more storms of that magnitude unless we
take immediate steps to care for the
environment.
Over 20 million people came together on this very same day in
1970, demanding urgent action on environmental issues. That sparked the
first ever Earth Day, and today we celebrate 44 years of
environmental activism and awareness.
The theme for
Earth Day 2014 is Green Cities. More than half of the worlds
population lives in cities, according to the Earth Day Network. Launched in
the fall of 2013, the Green Cities initiative targets three key areas
energy, green construction, and transportation
as the means to
develop an environmentally sound blueprint for our major metropolitan
areas.
Protecting our environment would also
open the door to new innovation and create more jobs. As a senior
member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, I
have written
several bills that do both. Among them:
Open Fuel Standard Act
Requires that 80 percent of new
cars sold in the United States by 2016 run on any combination of
ethanol, methanol or gasoline. Its a simple, inexpensive modification that
would cost about $100 and can be made standard in all cars, like
airbags or seat belts.
State and Local Fleet Efficiency
Act
Encourages state or local governments to require fleet owners or
operators to acquire only new fleet vehicles that utilize natural gas,
are flexible fuel vehicles, or meet a technology or performance-based
characteristic that is commercially
available.
Offending Oil Polluters Act
This would prohibit oil polluters from receiving
tax benefits for costs associated with cleaning up an oil
spill.
We have to think globally but act
locally to protect the environment. Please consider contacting one of our
many local community groups that sponsor neighborhood clean-up days,
recycling efforts or other activities about
volunteering.
The Earth is on loan to us from our children. Lets
be good stewards, for them and for future generations.
Sincerely,
Eliot L.
Engel
MEMBER OF CONGRESS
