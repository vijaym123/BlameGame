Dear Friends,
The last day to sign up for a health insurance plan through Covered California&rsquo;s open enrollment is February 15. If you don&rsquo;t currently have insurance or would like to change your plan, I invite you to join me for Healthcare 411: Information &amp; Advice about the Affordable Care Act on January 31 in San Mateo.
Covered California&rsquo;s website is up and running, and I want to make sure you have the tools to make an informed decision to select the best and most affordable healthcare plan that meets the needs of your family.
We just held the same event in Daly City last Saturday and many people took advantage of a Covered California website workshop with certified Covered California Educators, one-on-one informational appointments with insurance exchange experts, and free preventative health screenings. For example, we offered cholesterol screenings and yes, I was poked to have mine checked.
Next Saturday, the San Mateo County Health System public health nurses will again offer free flu vaccines to all individuals ages six months and older at both events.
Since the Affordable Care Act became law, an estimated 3.4 million previously uninsured Californians now have health insurance coverage. In San Mateo County, almost 55,000 individuals signed up for coverage during the first enrollment period last year and 83% of them received federal subsidies. Similar levels of subsidies are available this year.
Please sign up for the event in
San Mateo
and forward this email to relatives and friends who might also benefit from the events.
I look forward to seeing you this weekend.
All the best,
