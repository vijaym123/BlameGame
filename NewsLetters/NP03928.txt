Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Christmas lights have been making their appearances across Central Florida, and I participated in the first round of community Christmas parades this weekend. On Saturday, my grandchildren from Mount Dora joined me to pass out candy as we rode in a Ford F150 white pick-up truck down the parade route. Later that day, I also joined the Tavares parade and enjoyed seeing so many friends, local officials, and members of the North Lake community.
I was in South Lake to celebrate the 26th annual Light Up Clermont Holiday Festival Parade. My wife Sandy and I were happy to see so many members of the community come out to the parade and participate in the festivities. It has been an honor to represent Clermont for the last two years in Congress, and I am grateful for the trust they bestowed on me to continue to serve them in the upcoming term.
My last event for the weekend was the 47th annual Christmas Parade in Leesburg, where I rode close to the front with Lake County Sheriff Gary Borders and Leesburgs Citizen of the Year, Chuck Johnson. A couple of months ago, I met Chuck at his law office and thank him for the many years of dedicated service that he has invested in the Leesburg community.

Last week, the National Ready Mixed Concrete and Portland Cement Associations invited me to speak at their Resiliency 101 conference in Washington. I shared with them how the Water Resources Reform and Development Act that passed this year will create jobs, promote construction, and save taxpayer dollars. I have enjoyed serving on the Transportation Committee in the House of Representatives, and am looking forward to further work as we consider the Transportation Reauthorization and Highway Trust Fund legislation in the near future.

Texas Roadhouse has come to Clermont! On Friday evening, I joined members from the South Lake Chamber of Commerce at the restaurants soft opening. I am glad to see jobs, growth, and increased business coming to the Clermont area as Lake County continues to grow and expand.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
A constituent from Clermont requested assistance in cancelling his sons health insurance plan from the Marketplace. Shortly after his son enrolled in the Marketplace, he passed away unexpectedly. Despite multiple calls to the Marketplace and the healthcare provider, the father had been unsuccessful in cancelling his sons policy.
Finally, the constituent received a letter informing him that the policy was terminated, but he was still waiting on a refund for the premiums that had been deducted from his sons bank account. After multiple correspondence with the constituent and Health and Human Services, my office received a note from the parents, thanking us for our help and notifying us that they had finally received the refunds.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.

Legislative Update:
This week, I voted for the Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. The legislation allows individuals and families to set aside savings in order to support a disabled individual and enhance their health, independence, and quality of life.
The ABLE Act gives families of a severely disabled child some peace of mind by allowing them to save for their child's long-term disability expenses in the way that other families can currently save for college through popular 529 investment plans. You can
