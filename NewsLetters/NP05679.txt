Friend -- There are 26 days until the election. This is it.
The direction our country takes for the next two years is in your hands.
All around the country there are grassroots campaigns working to get out the vote to keep the Senate for Democrats.
But Republicans are well-funded and working hard too. We can&#39;t let them get the upper hand.
That&rsquo;s why I need you to choose today: Stand with me to mobilize every voter so we can win, or do nothing.
With 26 days until the election, there is little time left.
This is one of your final chances to impact this election.
It&#39;s all up to you.

I truly believe we will win this election.
That&rsquo;s because time and time again, when I&rsquo;ve needed Democratic grassroots supporters, you&#39;ve stepped up.
In the next 26 days, we need to out-work and out-organize the Republicans.
I know we can do both -- can I count on you to help?
Will you pitch in to stop a Republican Senate takeover? Remember: Gifts will be triple-matched until midnight only.
Thank you,
Barack Obama
