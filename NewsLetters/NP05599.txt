The Webster Wire
Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
After touring the Auburndale Speedway earlier this year, the Guy family owners invited me back as the Grand Marshal for one of their races. Last Saturday, from a perch above the race track, I had the opportunity to wave the green flag to start the race. One of my sons and two of my grandsons joined me for the race, and we met the driver for the #33 car, who came in first. Ironically, the winning drivers name was also Daniel Webster.

Last year, I started hosting listening sessions in several senior communities around the district. This last week, I returned to Royal Harbor, Lake Port Square, Hawthorne, and Legacy in Lake County to hold open meetings for the residents. We had a great turnout in each location, and it was helpful to listen to their comments, thoughts, and concerns regarding federal policies and current events.
As your representative in Congress, I appreciate hearing your perspectives as you answer the newsletter survey questions, talk to me at local community events,
contact my office , or follow me on
Facebook
or

The Clermont Womans Club had their first meeting of the season last week, and invited me to join them. I passed out copies of the
Constituent Service Guide
that my office provides, shared an update on my efforts to serve constituents by solving problems they experience with federal agencies, and discussed many of the issues that are currently facing our community.
Some of the other stops I made this week included:
-	Windermere Rotary Club
-	ABC Bus Companies in Winter Garden
-	Cranes View Lodge in Clermont
-	Clermonts Waffle House

Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Several constituents contacted my office regarding their health insurance situation after the Medicare Advantage insurance agency, Physicians United Plan, Inc. (PUP) dissolved earlier this year. One woman from Clermont contacted me regarding the transition of her plan. Without her knowledge or consent, she had been automatically enrolled in a United Health Care plan. Because she was unaware of the transfer, the constituent had placed a request to not pay the initial months premium. We immediately reached out to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and they removed the enrollment from her record, along with her responsibility to pay the United Health Care premium.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
During the Listening Sessions I hosted last week, several recurring themes, questions, and concerns immerged. Which of the following issue areas are most important to you?
Fiscal responsibility within Washington, including balancing the budget, reducing the deficit, and passing legislation that would create jobs and encourage economic growth
Social issues, including health care, education, and immigration reform
National security, both at our own borders and in dealing with terrorist threats overseas
All of the above are nearly or equally important to me

Legislative Update:
On Friday, I received a warm reception from healthcare professionals and insurance providers at the US Health Agents meeting in Orlando. They have worked with Obamacare for the last year. Most of their comments and concerns centered on the problems that consumers are experiencing, along with uncertainty surrounding the portions of the law that have been changed, waived, or delayed.
The media loves to demonize the fact that the House of Representatives has voted over fifty times to alter, modify, or repeal Obamacare. However, many of those changes have received bipartisan support, and several of them have passed through the Senate and been signed by the President.
My three principles of health care remain the same: The care we need, from a doctor we choose, at a price we can afford. I will continue to work for these three principles in developing new health care policies.
