Congressman McHenry Weekly Update
Honoring the 13th Anniversary of 9/11
This past Thursday marked the 13th anniversary of the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks on our nation.
That day changed our country forever as the threat of international terrorism was brought to the American homeland.
While the goal of those extremists was to tear our nation apart, it instead had the opposite affect as all Americans came together to remember the thousands lost and give thanks to the heroic police officers, firefighters, EMS, and ordinary citizens to save their fellow Americans.
We also remembered all the brave American soldiers who gave their lives fighting the war on terrorism.
The House and Senate recognized the 13th anniversary of 9/11 by joining the rest of the country in
observing a moment of silence at 8:46 AM , the moment the first plane struck the World Trade Center in New York.
On Wednesday, the House and Senate presented a Congressional Gold Medal to the memorials of each attack in honor of the fallen heroes of September 11th, 2001.

Helping Americans Keep Their Healthcare Plans
"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it."
That now infamous phrase was first stated by President Barack Obama as he was pushing for passage of Obamacare.
As countless North Carolinians can attest, that statement turned out to be completely untrue as millions of Americans had their policies cancelled because of the President's new healthcare law.
Politifact.com, a nonpartisan fact-checking website, even declared it
2013's "Lie of the Year ."
Unfortunately, those same cancellations are about to hit numerous Americans again this fall.
This past Thursday, the House acted to prevent those cancellations by
passing H.R. 3522 , the Employee Health Care Protection Act.
This legislation would allow Americans who receive their insurance through the group insurance market to keep their plans through 2019, avoiding the Obamacare-induced cancellations.

Stopping EPA Overreach
The Environmental Protection Agency has a long history of regulatory overreach.
This week, the House took action to stop that overreach by
passing H.R. 5078 , the Waters of the United States Regulatory Overreach Protection Act.
This bill was introduced in response to an EPA rule that would have redefined "waters of the United States" under the Clean Water Act, thus greatly expanding the federal government's powers to regulate America's waterways.
For years these waterways have been regulated, without issue, via a partnership between the federal and state governments.
I was proud to support this legislation to stop yet another overreach by the Obama Administration and the EPA.

September 11th, 2001 is a day no American will ever forget.
That is especially true for families of the victims of those heinous attacks.
This story of Hickory resident Ralph Geidel is among those.
Ralph's two brothers both served as firefighters in FDNY Fire Company 225 on that fateful day.
Tragically, Ralph's brother Gary was among the hundreds of brave first responders who died in the attacks.
