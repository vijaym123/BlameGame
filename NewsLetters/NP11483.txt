Dear Friend,
This week, the House passed several important pieces of legislation
including a bill to protect communities served by volunteer fire
departments, another to support Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
regulatory reform to better serve small farmers and ranchers, and still
others to require that the President observe and respect the laws
passed by Congress.
The Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act,
H.R. 3979, addresses a provision in the President's health care law
requiring all businesses with at least 50 full-time or full-time
equivalent employees to provide employer-sponsored insurance.
Unfortunately, the IRS has categorized volunteer firefighters as
employees, which would make it cost prohibitive for many small fire
protection districts to stay in operation. The simple fact is that many
smaller communities in Missouri's Fourth Congressional District and
elsewhere throughout the country rely on volunteer fire departments for
fire protection and emergency medical services.
It is vital we keep them open. That is why we passed legislation to
explicitly exempt volunteer fire departments. The International
Association of Fire Chiefs has warned that more than 780,000 volunteer
firefighters could be subject to the health law's rules, leading to
volunteer fire departments closing or severely curtailing their
emergency response activities. Our bill will ease the concerns of many
of our citizens in smaller communities across Missouri and the country.
The House also approved a bill this week to push back on the EPA's new
regulations forcing small farmers and ranchers to make costly
infrastructure improvements to oil storage containers. Their onerous
new regulations require these farmers and ranchers to construct a
containment structure around above-ground oil tanks, which must retain
110 percent of the maximum stored oil capacity. This requirement
applies to most farmers and ranchers across the country, including
small-scale producers who simply cannot afford it.
I was proud to co-sponsor the Farmers Undertake Environmental Land
Stewardship Act or FUELS Act, H.R. 311, to address and solve this
problem. Our bill modifies the exemption level to be more reflective of
a producer's spill risk and financial resources. In addition, it places
a greater degree of responsibility on the farmer or rancher to
self-certify compliance, instead of having to hire professional
engineers. A University of Arkansas report estimates this will save the
agriculture community up to $3.36 billion in compliance costs. It is a
common-sense bill that I urge the Senate to act on quickly.
On another matter, the House acted this week to require the Executive
Branch of our government to respect the laws that have been passed by
Congress and signed into law by the President. The Faithful Execution
of the Law Act, H.R. 3973, would require the Attorney General to report
to Congress regarding the implementation of any policy that results in
the failure or refusal of any federal official to enforce a law or
final court ruling. My colleagues and I also approved the Executive
Needs to Faithfully Observe and Respect Congressional Enactments of the
Law Act or the ENFORCE the Law Act, H.R. 4138. It authorizes Congress
to bring civil action against a President or other federal official who
implements a policy to refrain from enforcing, applying, or
administering any federal law. We do not live in a dictatorship. Laws
passed by Congress must be respected by all Americans - including the
President and federal officials. I call on the Senate to follow the
lead of the House in passing these laws to require that Executive
Branch actions do not violate the Constitution of the United States.
Finally, I met this week with Brigadier General John J. Elam, Commander
of the 102nd Training Division (Maneuver Support) at Fort Leonard Wood.
We had a very good discussion regarding the state of the Army Reserves
and the importance of a strong Reserve component force as part of the
Total Army mix.
I very much appreciated Brigadier General Elam's visit. We share the
strong desire to meet our current challenges and to maintain military
readiness during a difficult budget environment. I am very proud of the
work Brigadier General Elam and others at Fort Leonard Wood are doing
to help us accomplish this goal.
Have a good week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
This

the
House
passed
several
important

communities
served
by
volunteer
fire
departments,
another

and
still
others
to
require
that
the
President
observe
and
respect
the
laws
passed
by
Congress.
The
Protecting
Volunteer
Firefighters
and
Emergency
Responders
Act ,
H.R.
3979,
addresses
a
provision
in
the
President&#8217;s
health
care
law
requiring
all
businesses
with
at
least
50
full-time
or
full-time
equivalent
employees
to
provide
employer-sponsored
insurance.
Unfortunately,
the
IRS
has
categorized
volunteer
firefighters
as
employees,
which
would
make
it
cost
prohibitive
for
many
small
fire
protection
districts
to
stay
in
operation.
The
simple
fact
is
that
many
smaller
communities
in
Missouri&#8217;s
Fourth
Congressional
District
and
elsewhere
throughout
the
country
rely
on
volunteer
fire
departments
for
fire
protection
and
emergency
medical
services.
It
is
vital
we
keep
them
open.
That
is
why
we
passed
legislation
to
explicitly
exempt
volunteer
fire
departments.
The
International
Association
of
Fire
Chiefs
has
warned
that
more
than
780,000
volunteer
firefighters
could
be
subject
to
the
health
law&#8217;s
rules,
leading
to
volunteer
fire
departments
closing
or
severely
curtailing
their
emergency
response
activities.
Our
bill
will
ease
the
concerns
of
many
of
our
citizens
in
smaller
communities
across
Missouri
and
the
country.
The
House
also
approved
a
bill
this
week
to
push
back
on
the
EPA&#8217;s
new
regulations
forcing
small
farmers
and
ranchers
to
make
costly
infrastructure
improvements
to
oil
storage
containers.
Their
onerous
new
regulations
require
these
farmers
and
ranchers
to
construct
a
containment
structure
around
above-ground
oil
tanks,
which
must
retain
110
percent
of
the
maximum
stored
oil
capacity.
This
requirement
applies
to
most
farmers
and
ranchers
across
the
country,
including
small-scale
producers
who
simply
cannot
afford
it.
I
was
proud
to
co-sponsor
the
Farmers
Undertake
Environmental
Land
Stewardship
Act
or
FUELS
Act ,
H.R.
311,
to
address
and
solve
this
problem.
Our
bill
modifies
the
exemption
level
to
be
more
reflective
of
a
producer&#8217;s
spill
risk
and
financial
resources.
In
addition,
it
places
a
greater
degree
of
responsibility
on
the
farmer
or
rancher
to
self-certify
compliance,
instead
of
having
to
hire
professional
engineers.
A
University
of
Arkansas
report
estimates
this
will
save
the
agriculture
community
up
to
$3.36
billion
in
compliance
costs.
It
is
a
common-sense
bill
that
I
urge
the
Senate
to
act
on
quickly.
On
another
matter,
the
House
acted
this
week
to
require
the
Executive
Branch
of
our
government
to
respect
the
laws
that
have
been
passed
by
Congress
and
signed
into
law
by
the
President.
The
Faithful
Execution
of
the
Law
Act ,
H.R.
3973,
would
require
the
Attorney
General
to
report
to
Congress
regarding
the
implementation
of
any
policy
that
results
in
the
failure
or
refusal
of
any
federal
official
to
enforce
a
law
or
final
court
ruling.
My
colleagues
and
I
also
approved
the
Executive
Needs
to
Faithfully
Observe
and
Respect
Congressional
Enactments
of
the
Law
Act
or
the
ENFORCE
the
Law
Act ,
H.R.
4138.
It
authorizes
Congress
to
bring
civil
action
against
a
President
or
other
federal
official
who
implements
a
policy
to
refrain
from
enforcing,
applying,
or
administering
any
federal
law.
We
do
not
live
in
a
dictatorship.
Laws
passed
by
Congress
must
be
respected
by
all
Americans
&#8211;
including
the
President
and
federal
officials.
I
call
on
the
Senate
to
follow
the
lead
of
the
House
in
passing
these
laws
to
require
that
Executive
Branch
actions
do
not
violate
the
Constitution
of
the
United
States.
Finally,
I
met
this
week
with
Brigadier
General
John
J.
Elam,
Commander
of
the
102 nd
Training
Division
(Maneuver
Support)
at
Fort
Leonard
Wood.
We
had
a
very
good
discussion
regarding
the
state
of
the
Army
Reserves
and
the
importance
of
a
strong
Reserve
component
force
as
part
of
the
Total
Army
mix.
I
very
much
appreciated
Brigadier
General
Elam&#8217;s
visit.
We
share
the
strong
desire
to
meet
our
current
challenges
and
to
maintain
military
readiness
during
a
difficult
budget
environment.
I
am
very
proud
of
the
work
Brigadier
General
Elam
and
others
at
Fort
Leonard
Wood
are
doing
to
help
us
accomplish
this
goal.
Have
a
good
week.
