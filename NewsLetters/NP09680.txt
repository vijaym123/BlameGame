Dear Friend,
I had the opportunity to visit Yarnell on Monday and see how the town
is recovering from the Yarnell Hill Fire. The Yarnell Recovery Group,
also known as "Yarnell Rising," took me on a tour of the areas of the
town devastated by the fire. It's been almost a year since it burned
through the town and the surrounding countryside, but the burned trees
and rubble remain. It is always amazing to see how destructive a
wildfire can be - and also how random, with one house left untouched
and the next one burned to the ground - but it's also amazing to see
how resilient we Arizonans are. Seeing the many homes being rebuilt
left me feeling more hope for the future of our state and of our
country.
(Burned trees in Yarnell, Arizona, May 12, 2014)
I also had the chance to visit the Yarnell Fire District on Monday and
meet with Chief Ben Palm. We discussed Yarnell's recovery and how we
can better prevent such disasters from happening again. In the front of
their building they have a memorial to the 19 Granite Mountain Hotshots
who died trying to protect the town from the fire. It was comforting to
know that the bravery of those 19 heroes will never be forgotten. Thank
you to all first responders, including those at the Yarnell Fire
District, for protecting us and our properties every day.
(Rep. Gosar observing the memorial, May 12, 2014)
No First Class on the Taxpayer's Dime
My bill that would prohibit members of Congress from flying first class
using taxpayer funds gained steam this week. Everywhere I go, people
are shocked to learn that members of Congress can fly first class using
their money. This is a commonsense bill that will close an unworthy
loophole. I went on Fox News on Wednesday to talk about the bill and
you can watch the interview by clicking HERE
or below.
Beautiful Arizona
I was glad to be back in the Arizona Sun this week after spending a few
days in rainy Washington last week. I was also happy to see so many
smiling faces in my travels around District 4. I was able to meet with
a variety of people, from eighth graders in San Tan Valley to
Republicans in Cottonwood. Below are a few pictures from my travels
around the district.

The Importance of Small Businesses
On Tuesday, I introduced a resolution in the House in recognition of
National Small Business Week and the small business across this
country. As the backbone of our economy, small businesses are
responsible for 60 percent of net new jobs created since the end of the
recession. The entrepreneurs who own these businesses are among the
nation's top innovators, taking risks every day to achieve the American
dream. I owned my own small business for 25 years before becoming a
Congressman, so I know what it's like to struggle to make ends meet.
These self-starters deserve our commendation for their commitment to
furthering our nation's economy.
The important role small business owners play in our communities cannot
be understated. These entrepreneurs sponsor our youth sports teams, are
intimately involved in facilitating community events and, most
importantly, provide much-needed jobs. I encourage all citizens to shop
locally at small businesses this week in support of these vital
economic engines. Click HERE

Dear

I
had
the
opportunity
to
visit
Yarnell
on
Monday
and
see
how
the
town
is
recovering
from
the
Yarnell
Hill
Fire.
The
Yarnell
Recovery

also
known
as
"Yarnell

took
me
on
a
tour
of
the
areas
of
the
town
devastated
by
the
fire.
It's
been
almost
a

since
it

the
town
and
the
surrounding
countryside,
but
the
burned
trees
and

It
is
always
amazing
to
see how
destructive
a
wildfire
can
be
-
and
also how
random,
with
one
house left
untouched and
the
next

burned
to

-
but
it's
also
amazing

me feeling

for
the
future
of
our

I
also
had
the
chance
to
visit
the
Yarnell
Fire
District
on
Monday
and
meet
with
Chief
Ben
Palm.
We
discussed
Yarnell&#8217;s
recovery
and
how
we
can
better
prevent
such
disasters
from
happening
again.
In

Thank
you
to
all

District,
for
protecting
us
and
our
properties
every
day.
