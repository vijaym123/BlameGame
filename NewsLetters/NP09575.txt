Putting an End to Human Trafficking
Dear Neighbor,
Unfortunately, our hometown of Houston is a center for human trafficking. Because of our large airports, multiple interstate highways, and proximity to the border, Houston has become a hub for criminals to prey on victims. Weas parents, citizens, and policymakersneed to fight back.
Human trafficking victims are sexually exploited and robbed of their innocence and their childhoods. Today my colleagues in the House and I
passed legislation
that makes it easier for law enforcement to track down these criminals and prosecute the guilty. These bills make it easier to rescue victims and they rightfully treat minors as victims instead of accomplices. Additionally, they increase international communication so sex traffickers cant flee the country.
Far too often, we think of human trafficking as a far-off problem in a third-world country. We can no longer do that: these are real victims suffering real harm at the hands of real criminalsand its happening in our town. Im proud to stand with the overwhelming bipartisan majority in the House as we fight back to protect our children and end this modern day slavery.
Sincerely,
John Culberson
