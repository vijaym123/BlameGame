2014 CAMPAIGN SURVEY
FOR:
David Johnson Some people say they will sit out the 2014 election and wait until 2016. Do you plan to vote in 2014? YES
NO
Right now, we&rsquo;re putting together our campaign plan for the final 18 days of this election.
As you know, we&rsquo;re facing attacks from Karl Rove, the Koch Brothers, and Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s allies right now. But thanks to you, we&rsquo;re fighting Republican attacks on-the air, and running the most extensive get-out-the-vote program in our history.
David -- as an invested Democratic supporter, your input is critical. Will you take a 30 second survey to let us know what you&rsquo;re seeing and hearing on the ground? Chicago IL Democratic Supporter Survey -- Click Here &gt;&gt;
