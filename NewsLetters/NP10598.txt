Dear Friend,
I held a field hearing in Kingman on Monday about the Downwinders of
Mohave County. I was moved by the emotional stories I heard of the
trauma and illnesses they suffered. It breaks my heart that they've
been victimized twice by the federal government: first when the federal
government exposed them to radiation from nuclear testing and again
when they were excluded from benefit eligibility.
(Great turnout at the field hearing, April 14, 2014)
At the hearing, I heard a range of testimony, from expert reviews on
the law and medicine to the personal stories of actual Downwinders.
Witnesses included a Congressional Research Service (CRS) analyst,
Mohave County officials, the former Chairwoman of the Hualapai Tribe
and several local residents who either developed radiation-induced
illnesses themselves or have family members who died from a
radiation-induced illness.
(Rep. Gosar, accompanied by members of his staff, hearing testimony at
the field hearing, April 14, 2014)
The southern part of Mohave County was unjustly excluded from
eligibility for compensation under the Radiation Exposure Compensation
Act (RECA). It's just plain common sense that if the Arizona counties
to the northeast, east and even the southeast are eligible for RECA
compensation, then all of Mohave County should be eligible. The
residents of Mohave County deserve justice and equality, and I will
continue to fight to bring it to them. Click HERE

We Cannot Reward Wrongdoing
As part of my work to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse in the federal
government, I led a legislative effort to prevent the IRS from giving
bonuses to the employees of its Tax Exempt division, which is the
division responsible for the targeting of conservative groups. The
individuals responsible for this reprehensible behavior must be held
accountable, which is why I'm leading this legislative effort and why I
voted last week to hold Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress. Click HERE
to read a Breitbart News article about my efforts
and click HERE
to read
more in the Washington Post.
Americans are already worried about the IRS targeting them for their
political beliefs but this week they had even more to worry about. As
I'm sure you're well aware, Tuesday was Tax Day, which reminded us all
that our current tax system is completely broken. The tax code is too
complex and the tax burden is too high, not only destroying jobs and
slowing economic growth but also impeding the ability of families and
businesses to make long-term financial decisions. Families and
businesses currently waste thousands of dollars and countless hours
ensuring they don't run afoul of our nation's more than 80,000-page tax
code.
All of this indicates that we need tax reform. We need a flatter,
fairer tax code, one that rewards Americans for their hard work and
allows them to keep more of the money they earn. This will unshackle
the economy and create jobs so that folks across the country can
finally find work again. Click HERE

Simply Unacceptable
In my last e-newsletter, I told you about a report that up to 40
veterans had died as a result of delays at the Phoenix VA and that,
allegedly, VA workers kept two sets of records in order to conceal
ridiculously long wait times. Concerned Veterans for American held a
rally in Phoenix on Wednesday to bring attention to mismanagement at
the Phoenix VA and the need for reform. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to
attend the rally, but I sent my Wounded Warrior Liaison to read my
statement, the entirety of which you can read by clicking HERE
.
(A picture from the rally, courtesy The Arizona Republic, April 16,
2014)
It is no secret that the Department of Veterans Affairs is failing
countless veterans all over this great nation.
For years now, our
servicemen and women have waited extraordinary amounts of time for the
benefits they earned.
Initial responses to claims still hover close to
one year, with appeals taking even longer.
It is with a heavy heart
that I say many of these veterans simply give up.
They feel abandoned
by the country they fought for, and they either discontinue their
pursuit of their rightful benefits, or worse, they give up on life
completely.
Such instances are all too common today, and it is
absolutely heartbreaking. The VA's treatment of veterans is
unacceptable. Enough is enough. I agree with a statement from an
Arizona Republic editorial published last week on this issue: "Let the
heads begin to roll." Click HERE

rally and this issue in The Arizona Republic.
Fighting the BLM
I visited the Bundy family ranch last Saturday. Like many Americans
throughout the country, I closely monitored the incidents that
transpired last week between the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and
the Bundy family. While I was pleased that the BLM decided to end the
roundup, that does not change the fact that the way they handled this
situation is unacceptable.
(Rep. Gosar driving to the Bundy family ranch, April 12, 2014)
The BLM infringed on the rights and liberties of American citizens in
the way they chose to deal with this matter and put the safety of the
general public as well as their employees at risk. If this is the type
of leadership we can expect out of new BLM Director Neil Kornze, I have
grave concerns. This situation highlights a continual theme within the
Obama administration: more control of our daily lives and more control
of our federal lands by any means necessary.
(Rep. Gosar speaking with Marty Bundy at the Bundy family ranch, April
12, 2014)
I will not stand for these types of infringements and call on the BLM
to respect the basic rights of American citizens and not use
totalitarian tactics like this again.
Traveling Across District 4
I held several events across District 4 this week, including two town
halls. It was refreshing to meet so many new people and discuss our
nation's future with them. Below are a few pictures of the events.

Happy Easter
As a Catholic, Easter is a very important and special holiday for me,
one that is central to my faith. I plan to spend it with my family and
I hope you will be able to spend time with your family as well this
weekend. I hope you all have a happy Easter.

about
the

(Rep.

The
southern
part
of
Mohave
County
was
unjustly
excluded
from
eligibility
for
compensation
under
the
Radiation
Exposure
Compensation
Act
(RECA).
It's
just
plain
common
sense
that
if
the
Arizona

the
northeast,
east
and
even
the
southeast
are
eligible
for
RECA

then
all
of
Mohave

should
be

The

We
Cannot
Reward Wrongdoing
As
part
of
my
work
to
eliminate
waste,
fraud
and
abuse
in
the
federal
government,
I
led
a
legislative
effort
to
prevent
the
IRS
from
giving
bonuses
to
the
employees
of
its
Tax
Exempt
division,
which
is
the
division
responsible
for
the
targeting
of
conservative
groups.
The
individuals
responsible
for
this
reprehensible
behavior
must
be
held
accountable,
which
is
why
I'm
leading this
legislative
effort
and
why
I
voted
last
week
to
hold
Lois
Lerner
in
contempt
of
Congress.

Americans
are
already
worried
about
the
IRS
targeting
them
for
their
political
beliefs
but
this
week
they
had
even
more
to
worry
about.
As
I'm
sure
you're
well
aware,
Tuesday
was
Tax
Day,
which
reminded
us
all
that
our
current
tax
system
is
completely
broken.
The
tax
code
is
too
complex
and
the
tax
burden
is
too
high,
not
only
destroying
jobs
and
slowing
economic
growth
but
also
impeding
the
ability
of
families
and
businesses
to
make
long-term
financial
decisions.
Families
and
businesses
currently
waste
thousands
of
dollars
and
countless
hours ensuring
they
don't
run
afoul
of
our
nation&#8217;s
more
than
80,000-page
tax
code.
All
of
this
indicates
that
we
need
tax
reform.
We
need
a
flatter,
fairer
tax
code,
one
that
rewards
Americans
for
their
hard
work
and
allows
them
to
keep
more
of
the
money
they
earn.
This
will
unshackle
the
economy
and
create
jobs
so
that
folks
across
the
country
can
finally
find
work
again.

Simply
Unacceptable
In
my
last
e-newsletter,
I
told
you
about
a
report
that
up
to
40
veterans
had
died
as

on
Wednesday
to
bring

to

at
the

and
the
need
for
reform.
Unfortunately,
I
wasn't
able
to
attend
the
rally,
but
I
sent

It
is
no

that
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
is
failing
countless
veterans
all

this
great
nation.
For

are

Fighting
the
BLM
I
visited
the
Bundy
family
ranch
last
Saturday.
Like
many
Americans
throughout
the
country,
I
closely
monitored
the
incidents
that
transpired last
week between
the
Bureau
of
Land
Management
(BLM)
and
the
Bundy
family.
While
I
was
pleased
that
the
BLM
decided
to
end
the
roundup,
that
does
not
change
the
fact
that the
way
they handled
this
situation
is
unacceptable.
(Rep.
Gosar
driving
to
the
Bundy
family
ranch,
April
12,
2014)
The
BLM
infringed
on
the
rights
and
liberties
of
American
citizens
in
the
way
they
chose
to
deal
with
this
matter
and
put
the
safety
of
the
general
public
as
well
as
their
employees
at
risk.
If
this
is
the
type
of
leadership
we
can
expect
out
of
new
BLM
Director
Neil
Kornze,
I
have
grave
concerns.
This situation
highlights
a
continual
theme
within
the
Obama
administration:
more
control
of
our
daily
lives
and more
control
of
our
federal
lands
by
any
means
necessary.
(Rep.
Gosar
speaking
with
Marty
Bundy
at
the
Bundy
family
ranch,
April
12,
2014)
I
will
not
stand
for
these
types
of
infringements
and
call
on
the
BLM
to
respect
the
basic
rights
of
American
citizens
and
not
use
totalitarian
tactics
like
this
again.
