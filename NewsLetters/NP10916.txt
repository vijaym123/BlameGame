Deseret News Endorses Durbin-Lee Smarter Sentencing
Act
The Editorial Board of the Deseret News recently praised the
bipartisan effort in Congress to reform our sentencing laws to give judges
greater discretion when making sentencing decisions.
As a federal
prosecutor, I have had firsthand experience with a criminal justice
system that imprisons too many people for too long.
In order for
America to reemerge as an opportunity society, we need to work on
undoing some of the harmful effects of rigid federal sentencing laws that
disproportionately and adversely affect America's lower-income
families.
I have worked closely with Senator Durbin (D-IL) to craft a
bipartisan bill that will enable us to be both tough and smart on
crime.
Our bill,
SB1410 The Smarter Sentencing Act , gives
judges the discretion they need to improve our criminal justice
system.
Momentum is building in the Senate to pass our bill, and
momentum is also building across the country for prison sentencing reform
as communities recognize the enormous social and financial costs of
our current system.
The first few paragraphs of
this editorial
by the Deseret News Editorial Board addresses many
important aspects of this debate:
A
bipartisan measure in Congress to roll back mandatory minimum prison terms is
a welcome effort to reform federal criminal law sentencing. Excessive
sentences harm individuals convicted, who sometimes spend decades in
jail for drug crimes far less heinous than murder or rape. More
importantly, unwarranted sentences harm our penal system, mocking principles
of justice and mercy.
Current sentencing standards are
the result of harsh anti-criminal measures dating to the late 1980s and
early 1990s, as the use of crack cocaine in urban areas reached
heightened proportions. Removing discretion from judges through the
imposition of mandatory sentences for particular crimes was seen as a way to
get tough on drug traffickers.
This has led to an explosion in
the total prison population, which has more than tripled from 443,838
in 1984 to 1,537,414 in 2011.
I recommend reading
the rest of the article to learn more about why momentum is building to
pass these reforms:
In our opinion: Roll back
mandatory minimum sentences and allow judges to measure out
punishment
