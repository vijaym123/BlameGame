Greetings,
Today we celebrate the men in our lives who taught us the value of hard work, telling the truth and keeping our faith.
Our fathers may not always have been our best friend, but they were always on our side.
My father was no exception.
He worked so hard to make the lives of his children better and create opportunities for us so I, my sister and my brother would have opportunities that he never even had the chance to dream about.
To my son, Nick.
I am truly blessed to bear witness to your journey through life and nothing makes me more proud than when you call me Dad.
Thanks too, Nick, for my Fathers Day gift.
Weighing in at 8 pounds and 8 weeks old, I know this present will bring joy to your mom and me for many years to come.
Introducing GEN William Tecumseh Sherman (aka Tank).
Happy Fathers Day to all the dads out there.
I hope that you have the chance to relax and enjoy the day with your family.
May Gods grace and wisdom guide you now and always as you continue to father and mentor those young people in your life.
Sincerely,
Mike Pompeo
Member of Congress
