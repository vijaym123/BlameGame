Dear Friends,
As you are headed home this
Friday evening theres a
good chance a number of you got
there via different modes of
transportation. Some of you
likely drove, others took a bus
or the train, and some may have
walked or ridden a bicycle. At
the same time, supplies and
products were making their way
from one company to another or
from a retailer to your door
step. The cars, trucks, trains,
boats, planes, roads and
waterways that move people and
goods make up our national
transportation system. Given
that this week is National
Transportation Week, I thought
Id share some of the
work Ive been doing in
Congress on this vitally
important issue.
Two years ago, Congress
recognized that a new approach
was needed to target critical
infrastructure investments, and
we passed a bill called Moving
Ahead for Progress in the 21
st
Century, or
MAP-21, which helped lay
groundwork for smarter and more
cost-effective ways of
building, managing and
maintaining our nations
transportation system.
For months, I have been
working closely with my
bipartisan colleagues Senators
Barbara Boxer, David Vitter and
John Barrasso to craft a new
version of MAP-21 that takes
the
next step in improving
American infrastructure that
will help every American and
every American business.
Yesterday, we passed this
legislation out of the
Environment &amp; Public Works
Committee- the first step to it
becoming a law.
Every state, city, and town
in the country has a stake in
this bill, which provides for
more than 40 percent of all
highway capital investments and
a quarter of public transit
funding in America. It also has
a huge impact on the way we
move freight. Efficient,
reliable, and affordable
freight movement is important
to nearly every type of
business in Delaware and across
the nation, whether its
by air, ground, or sea. In
fact, the U.S. transportation
system moves more than 52
million tons of goods worth
nearly $46 billion every day.
Simply put, our economy relies
on having first rate
transportation
infrastructure.
Passing this bill would protect
112,000 different
transportation projects around
the country and the jobs of
more than 700,000 people that
work on these projects. I know
that Delawareans, and all
Americans, are counting on
Congress to get this done
because local projects that
affect their quality of life,
and their livelihoods, are at
risk. Im confident that
we in Congress will do
whats necessary to pass
this transportation bill and
return confidence to the
states, cities and citizens
counting on the federal
government to be a partner in
infrastructure investment that
we all count on.
As always, I welcome hearing
your views on this issue, or
any other, through
