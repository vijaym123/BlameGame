Dear Friend:
As co-chair of the Senate Climate Action Task Force, I want to invite you to participate in an exciting upcoming event.
On May 21st at 4pm EDT/1pm PDT, I will be hosting a "Wake Up Congress for Climate Action Rally" outside the U.S. Capitol in Washington.
The rally will be attended by a number of Congressional leaders and show public support for action on climate change.
No matter where you are, you can still take part in this important event to wake up Congress to act on climate change.
California rally supporters are asked to set the alarms on their cell phones, tablets, or hand-held devices to ring at
2pm PDT on Wednesday, May 21st , to sound the alarm on climate change.
You can also join us on Twitter any time after 1pm PDT using the hashtags #SoundtheAlarm4Climate and #ActOnClimate.
The devastating effects of climate change are all around us right now, and it is time for Congress to wake up.
We must sound the alarm and act now to reduce carbon pollution for the sake of our health, our economy and the well-being of our children and grandchildren.
I hope you can join us in this effort and take another step toward action on climate change.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
