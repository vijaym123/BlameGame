Dear Friend,
This Saturday December 7th is the deadline for Medicare open
enrollment. If you are currently on Medicare and would like to make
changes to your plan, you must make your selection for your 2014
Medicare plan by midnight on Saturday.
If you would like to change your 2014 coverage, you can do so online at
Medicare.gov
. Coverage changes can be made to traditional Medicare, Medicare
Advantage plans, and prescription drug plans. When choosing your
coverage, please verify that your doctors and pharmacists will be
Medicare providers next year.
If you do not want to change your current plan, no action is needed.
My staff is available to answer questions and assist you, so don't
hesitate to call my local office, (866) 264-0957 or (561) 998-9045
between the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.
Always,
Lois Frankel
