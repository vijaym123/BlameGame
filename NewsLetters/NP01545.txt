Friends,
In order to not interrupt the Fourth
Round of the Masters, our weekly e-newsletter is coming out a bit early
today.
Growing up playing and watching golf, this week is one of
my favorite times of the year.
Whether I am rooting on a
hometown hero, Palmetto State native, or old pro, the final round of the
Masters always makes for an exciting Sunday.
I realize not everyone
is a golf enthusiast so before I bore you into closing this email, I
will move on to our weekly update
The House
of Representatives is back in session this week
and the Small
Business Committee will hold a timely hearing on April 15 to examine
tax reform and the impact it would have on Main Street.
Having
spent my entire career navigating our tax code and litigating tax law, I
am looking forward to this discussion.
The success of our
communitys economy depends on the success of our small businesses.
We must keep Main Street in mind when Congress considers tax reform
proposals.
During our
hearing we will hear from the owner of Sleep Tite Mattress Factory in
Franklin, Ohio, the Chairman of McGregor Metalworking Companies, also
in Ohio, and the President of the National Taxpayers Union.
Since Wednesday is a day many Americans and businesses dread, it will be
interesting to hear what these businesses think of the federal
governments anticompetitive tax environment. Too often, I hear from
businesses that their compliance costs are eating up their bottom line.
Congress must fix our broken tax code so it is simpler and fairer for
businesses and taxpayers.
