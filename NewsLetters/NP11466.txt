Dear Friends,
On
Tuesday, March 18th from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., I will be hosting my 5th
annual Housing and Mortgage Assistance Workshop.
It will be
held at the Coram Fire House, located at 303 Middle Country Road, Coram,
NY 11727.
Each year, this event serves around 300 Long
Island residents by providing access to resources and assistance with
mortgages and loan refinancing, along with information about any other
housing assistance for which residents may qualify.
Members of my
staff will also be on hand to explain how my office can advocate on
behalf of residents directly with their lenders.
This year,
the following banks and organizations are scheduled to
participate:
Bank of America
Wells Fargo Home
Mortgage
CitiMortgage
One West
Bank/IndyMac
Ocwen Loan
Servicing
HSBC
Freddie Mac
Capital One
US
Bank
Long Island Housing Services
Long Island Housing
Partnership
GreenPath
Community
Development Corporation
EOC of Suffolk
Touro Law
Center
Nassau Suffolk Law
Services
Empire Justice Center
Even if your bank is not among
the list of participants, I encourage you to attend this workshop
because you may be able to receive advice and counseling from one of the
non-profits that will be participating.
If you would like more
information, please do not hesitate to contact my office at (631)
289-6500.
Sincerely,
Congressman Tim Bishop
First District of New
York
