Statement on Latest Immigration
Developments
10/28/14
Today, Doug Lamborn issued the
following statement in response to growing concern
most recently from
the president of the National Citizenship and Immigration Services
Council
over Obama Administration efforts to grant amnesty to millions
of illegal immigrants:
I am very concerned about recent actions by the Obama administration
that suggest they are preparing to bypass Congress on immigration
policy after the November elections. Congress is the branch of government
that has Constitutional authority to create law, not the President.
An executive action seeking to subvert this separation of powers
would be an abuse of executive power.
If President Obama acts
alone on immigration by deferring deportation and offering work permits
and green cards to millions of illegal immigrants, Congress can and
should go to court, and take any other necessary steps, to stop the
administration from granting amnesty that the law does not provide. I
remain absolutely opposed to amnesty of any kind, and I urge President
Obama to respect the separation of powers and to work with Congress to
pass responsible immigration reform that strengthens border security,
improves interior enforcement, and streamlines legal immigration.
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
(CO-05)
