Dear Friend,
Thank you for taking the time to read this update about my latest work
in Washington and Nevada. After a short legislative week in Washington,
I will be working out of my district office to do the most important
part of my job: getting out into the community to hear from the people
I represent about the issues that are most important to them and their
families. This input is critical and provides valuable insights for me
to take to Washington on your behalf.
To follow my work in Nevada in real time, connect with me on social
media
. I am on Facebook, Twitter, and
YouTube as Rep. Joe Heck. I hope you will keep reading and participate
in a short survey to share your thoughts on the best way to improve the
economy.
As always, do not hesitate to contact me
if you have concerns about any issue currently before
Congress.
It remains an honor and privilege to serve you in the House
of Representatives.
Best,
Joe
DR. JOE HECK
Member of Congress
Share your thoughts with me on how we can improve the economy
My top priority in Congress is advancing legislation that creates a
healthy economy and sets the conditions for the private sector to add
jobs. I hope you will take a few moments to share your thoughts with me
on the policy YOU feel will best improve the economy and spur job
creation by participating in the survey below.
Which of the following do you believe is the best way to improve the
economy and spur job creation?
Reform the tax code so that it benefits all Americans by eliminating
special interest loopholes and industry-specific deductions
Improve education and job training programs so that both students and
unemployed individuals can learn the skills necessary to fill available
jobs
Direct increased federal spending to infrastructure projects like
building roads and bridges
Remove burdensome regulations that make it more expensive and more
difficult for companies to expand and hire workers

highlighting the service and sacrifice of prominent African American
military heroes. Below is my post from last week on the 54th
Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment - the first military unit
consisting of black soldiers formed in the North during the Civil War.
