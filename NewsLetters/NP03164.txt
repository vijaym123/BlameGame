Increasing American Energy
Security
1/28/15
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn voted in favor of H.R.
351, the LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act. This
legislation calls for the expansion of Liquefied Natural Gas
exports.
"Even though tens of thousands of
Americans would be put back to work and the nation would increase its
energy security, the Obama Administration has blocked the expansion of
LNG exports for years. These seemingly arbitrary bureaucratic blockades
from the Department of Energy (DOE) must stop. That's why the House
passed legislation to enact a thirty day deadline for the DOE to come
to final decisions on the construction of new LNG export facilities.
With our new Republican partners in the Senate, we will now stand strong
against an Administration that stands in the way of a more stable,
secure, and prosperous American energy future. As we continue to
see the aggressive actions of Russia, it makes no sense for the Obama
Administration to continue standing in the way of LNG exports. This bill
supports American energy independence and reduces Russia's energy
stronghold over our European allies. "
- Congressman Doug
Lamborn (CO-05)
