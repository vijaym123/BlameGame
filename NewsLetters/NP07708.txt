Dear
Friends,
The Salton Sea was once the jewel of our
desert, drawing thousands of tourists, birdwatchers, and other outdoors
enthusiasts. Growing up near the Salton Sea Sea, I have wonderful memories
of going fishing there with my father and learning about the fish and
wildlife in this unique
ecosystem.
As many of you are already aware, the Salton Sea
now faces significant challenges due to reduced water inflows and water
quality. As a physician, I am deeply concerned about the public health
consequences if this problem is left unattended. Since I first took
office, I have prioritized working with local, state and federal
officials and stakeholders to find a pragmatic solution to the deteriorating
lake.
Last week
I was proud to introduce an amendment to H.R. 4923, the Energy and
Water Appropriations Act, to direct $1 million for Bureau of Reclamation
public health projects like the Red Hill Bay project for the Salton
Sea. The amendment passed the House with bipartisan support and if
signed into law, it would allow the Bureau of Reclamation to dedicate
additional resources to address the deteriorating conditions that have made
the Salton Sea a serious public health threat to the Coachella
Valley.
As an emergency
medicine doctor, I have seen first-hand the effects of the resulting
poor air and water quality on our children and seniors. The amendment
allows more resources to be dedicated to mitigate public health
threats like the Salton Sea through critical endeavors like the Red Hill Bay
project. Click the video below to see the amendment debate from the
House floor.
Do you feel that enough is being done to
address the decline of the Salton Sea? Yes No Unsure *By answering this

We are also seeing
opportunities to leverage the renewable energy potential of the Salton
Sea to both fund its restoration, and create long-term, well-paying
jobs for our communities. The Sea faces serious problems ahead, but
also holds great promise for our
community.
I am proud to be a part of the vision that
will turn the Salton Sea into the largest green, renewable energy parkway
in the country. It will take much more hard work, and we cannot lose
sight of our goals, but together I know we will achieve it. No problem
is too big for us to solve if we work
together.
Sincerely,
Raul Ruiz, M.D.
