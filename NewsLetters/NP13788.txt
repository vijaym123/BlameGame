Dear Friends,
On Tuesday the House passed three important pieces of legislation aimed
at reforming the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). These
bills, that originated in the Homeland Security Committee, which I
chair, will reform technology acquisition and save taxpayer dollars,
improve private sector participation in policy decisions, and send
unclaimed change left at security checkpoints to the United States
Service Organization (USO) to improve air travel for our armed forces.
You can click the following links to watch my floor speeches in support
of the Transportation Security Reform Act
, the TSA Loose Change Act
, and the Aviation Stakeholder Participation Act
.
The House also passed, with bipartisan support, the Innovation Act
.
As a Chairman of the High Tech Caucus, I
was proud to support this legislation that reforms abusive patent
litigation.
Abuse within the system has cost high tech companies
hundreds of millions of dollars and resulted in roadblocks to job
creation and technological breakthroughs.
This legislation will
provide some decisive relief for America's high tech sector and the
industries they power.
I also delivered a speech on the House floor about Obamacare
and my personal experience with the law.
The president
still has not signed up for his own law that he claims is a good
product. I believe this is the height of hypocrisy, if it is good
enough for the American people then it is good enough for those who
wrote and passed it.
I was glad to be back in Cypress on Friday meeting with constituents
and answering your questions.
It is great to see so many of you take
the time to be engaged with your government.
I always walk away
energized after getting to spend time with you.
A great crowd showed up in Cypress
