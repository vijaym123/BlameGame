Dear Friend -
Often, they dont receive much recognition. But they are part of the very fabric of our lives. They are the ones who show up, day in and day out. In Washington, we may debate education policy on a sweeping scale, but they are the ones who put their hands on the small shoulders, look into the bright eyes, and say, You can do it. I believe in you. They may never brush shoulders with world leaders or appear on national television, but they are the ones who are changing the world. One child at a time.
They are our teachers.
Today, on National Teacher Appreciation Day, lets each pause and take a moment to say two simple words our educators dont hear nearly enough:
thank you . For giving of yourself each and every day. For investing in us. For teaching us. For changing our lives. We are grateful.
Yours in service,
Randy
PS
I cant send this email without mentioning how grateful I am for the guidance of my own high school principal, Harry Blevins, who had a tremendous impact on my life when I was a student at Great Bridge High School and to this day, remains my friend. Thank you for being a role model to me, Mr. Blevins, and thank you to all our teachers in the 4 th
District of Virginia and across the country.
