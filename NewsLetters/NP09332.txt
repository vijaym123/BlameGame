Friends,
Thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter.
With such a busy and
eventful week, I am especially grateful to have a direct connection for
sharing news with you.
As always, if you have additional questions or
comments, please email me here
.
Working for our Veterans
Those who choose to put on our uniform and serve our country deserve
the very best medical care that we can give them.
The recent
revelations of secret waiting lists and veterans dying for lack of
doctor's appointments are absolutely shameful.
I have demanded a full Senatorial investigation, and will work
diligently to see it through. Read my letter to the U.S. Senate
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation here
.
If you or a loved one has been affected by this failure, we want to
help.
My state staff will do whatever they can to assist you-please
contact them here
.
Opportunity for the Middle Class
A strong middle class is a strong America, and I was honored to join
House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Senator Mike Lee at the American
Enterprise Institute yesterday to discuss conservative solutions to
help the middle class thrive.
I believe that education is a crucial step between poverty and success,
and my Opportunity Agenda is focused on school choice, job skills
training, and job creation.
You can watch the video of our discussion below, and read more about my
Opportunity Agenda here

Saluting Those Who Serve
On Memorial Day, we honor the men and women who have worn our nation's
uniform and those brave heroes who paid the ultimate price. There is no
doubt that America enjoys the experience of peace and freedom because
of men and women who have paid a very high price through their service
in our Armed Forces. While we can never fully thank them, I am
committed to supporting those troops currently serving, the veterans
that have served and the families that serve alongside them.
South Carolina is blessed to have such a strong military community, and
I am truly proud to stand with residents from across the state as we
honor those who have served for their courage, service and dedication.
God Bless them, and God Bless America.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott
