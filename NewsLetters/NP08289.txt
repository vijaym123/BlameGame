U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) today issued the following statement in remembrance the 19 Granite Mountain Hotshots who died battling the Yarnell Hill fire one year ago today: &ldquo;On this somber anniversary, we remember the 19 Granite Mountain Hotshots who ran into &ndash; not away from &ndash; an inferno, sacrificing themselves to protect the lives and homes of their neighbors. These brave souls are personification of the guts and selflessness that our state and our nation are built on; and they remain exemplars of all that is good, and brave, and decent in men. They are today, as always, in the thoughts and prayers of the citizens of Arizona.&rdquo;
