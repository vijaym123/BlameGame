Time for
Volkswagen, Tennessee to Move Forward on Plant
Expansion
Senator Corker released the following statement on
Monday after the UAW withdrew its appeal of Februarys election at
Chattanoogas Volkswagen (VW) plant.
"This 11th hour reversal by
the UAW affirms what we have said all along -- that their objection
was nothing more than a sideshow to draw attention away from their
stinging loss in Chattanooga," said Corker. Many have felt the UAW never
really wanted another election in the near term because they knew they
would lose by an even larger margin, based on widespread knowledge of
the UAW's problematic track record throughout the country, which the
workers at Volkswagen have been able to see firsthand over recent
months. Fortunately, the majority of workers at Volkswagen's Chattanooga
plant realized they were only dollar signs to the UAWs
self-survival.
"It's a shame the UAW slowed the momentum on our
expansion conversations with Volkswagen, but now it's time for VW, our state
and our community to re-engage and move forward with bringing
additional jobs to Chattanooga," added Corker.
As mayor of
Chattanooga from 2001-2005, Corker worked with officials and community
leaders to develop the 1,200 acre Enterprise South Industrial Park, which is
now home to Volkswagen's North American manufacturing headquarters.
Much of the negotiation that led to Volkswagen choosing Chattanooga
occurred around the dining room table of Corkers Chattanooga
home.
Putin Emboldened by
Administrations Empty Rhetoric
Senator
Corker, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, made the
following statement regarding the Obama administration's failure to
enforce the threat of new sanctions despite Russia's continued
interference in eastern Ukraine and refusal to take any steps to implement the
Geneva agreement that was supposed to de-escalate the
crisis.
"President Putin is only emboldened by empty rhetoric, so it is
time for the administration to back up their talk by immediately
putting in place tough sanctions against Russian banks and energy
companies," said Corker. "Right now, the feeling on the ground is that Putin is
more committed to the failure of Ukraines struggling democracy than
the West is to its success, and only forceful and immediate action like
this can begin to change that dynamic.
"In addition, the
United States must develop a long-term strategy to counter Russian
aggression in Europe since the impact of Putin's interference extends
far beyond Ukraine."
Senator Corker returned Thursday from
a four-day visit to Moldova and Ukraine to assess firsthand the
situation on the ground since Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and
continued destabilizing involvement in eastern Ukraine and throughout the
region.

In the
News
In Mondays Wall Street Journal Asia, Senator Corker wrote
about President Obamas Asia trip and what is at stake for U.S.
credibility in the Asia-Pacific region. The stakes for U.S. interests
couldn't be higher in the region: China continues its coercive and
aggressive behavior in the East and South China Seas; North Korean
provocations persist; relations between Japan and South Korea remain strained;
and Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade negotiations continue to face
hurdles due to inaction in the United States Congress, writes Corker.
While there are many important bilateral and regional issues for the
U.S. president to discuss on his visit to the Asia-Pacific, there are
three key messages I hope he will convey Read more
