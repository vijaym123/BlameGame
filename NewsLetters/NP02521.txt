What I&rsquo;m Hearing From You
Tuesday, February 24, 2015
Dear Friend,
A few weeks ago I sent a survey asking what your priorities were for the 114th Congress and did you ever respond! More than 1,000 people responded, many of you taking the time to not only answer the survey, but provide personal comments as well. I want to thank you all for your participation.
Overwhelmingly, the majority of you believe that jobs and the economy should be our top priorities and I agree with you. Our economy has gotten stronger, but we need to continue to pursue policies that will help the economy grow from the Middle Class out.
Immigration reform, climate change, and education were also important priorities for each of you, and those are priorities I believe this Congress should focus on as well. I continue to engage with my colleagues to see where we can work together to pass commonsense legislation and am hopeful that we can make progress on these important issues to move this country forward.
Here is just a sampling of what I heard from you:
&ldquo;I believe that climate change is a very important issue that needs to be addressed at the national level.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Equal pay for equal work. I am 92 and I know what it was like to be under-paid because I was a woman.&rdquo;
&ldquo;There are many pressing issues to improve, however; immigration in California touches everyone from education to health care. The undocumented immigrants are here to stay as many have made their lives and homes here over a period of many years Let's stop the rhetoric and create meaningful reforms so they can contribute &lsquo;legally&rsquo; to our society.&rdquo;
Thank you again for taking the time to offer your feedback. I truly believe that open and honest dialogue is what helps keep our democracy strong. Our country is greatest when we all work together to solve our challenges. Please continue to keep in touch by
