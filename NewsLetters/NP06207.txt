Dear Friend, The Republicans are putting on a full-court press.
Even here in Massachusetts, they&rsquo;re investing resources, opening offices, and putting staffers on the ground.
This year marks what might be the GOP&rsquo;s best chance in years to retake the Senate. They&rsquo;re going to press Democrats all across the country, including in traditionally blue states like Massachusetts. And we&rsquo;re counting on you to help us fight back. Time is running out, both in this campaign and on our FEC deadline goal of $145,000. Please, if you&rsquo;re able, consider making a $5 contribution before it&rsquo;s too late.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
My opponent and the coordinated Republican campaign in Massachusetts are going to do everything in their power to flip the Commonwealth&rsquo;s Senate seat from blue to red. We&rsquo;re the only thing standing in their way.
I want to continue to be your Senator because I know that the things that work in Massachusetts -- a higher minimum wage, more clean energy jobs, tighter gun control laws -- will work for the country as a whole. But I need your help to keep Republicans from taking this seat. A $5 contribution would be fantastic. A $10 contribution would be spectacular. And if you can afford to give more, please do! We need every last bit of support this year, and we appreciate all you do.
Thanks for your help.
