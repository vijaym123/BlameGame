Military Pension Cuts Repealed by Congress
- Goes to President's Desk
Knowing
your interest in defense and military issues, I wanted to let you know
that both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate
passed legislation repealing the cuts to military pensions that was passed
as part of last year's budget agreement.
The bill now goes to
President Obama's desk for signature.
I
supported this bill when it passed the House on February 11 by a vote of 326
- 90.
I certainly understand the need to reduce government
spending but we should keep the promises we made to current active duty
military and retirees.
