Dear Fellow Nevadan,
During LGBT Pride Month, we reflect
upon the hard won victories for equality nationwide and rededicate
ourselves to the principle that discrimination has no place in America.
During my time as Majority Leader, I have worked on legislation
important to the LGBT community, such as repealing Dont Ask, Dont Tell and
securing passage of the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention
Act.
And last year, the Senate passed the Employment
Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) to ensure that LGBT Americans can live their lives
openly without the fear of being fired from their job for who they are.
If House Republicans brought ENDA for a vote it would pass
overwhelmingly, so I urge them to allow a vote on this important civil rights
bill.
We still have much work to do, however. The United States
is made stronger by its rich diversity. I remain committed to
ensuring that all Americans are treated equally and with dignity regardless
of their gender identity or who they choose to love.
