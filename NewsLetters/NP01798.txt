Dear Friend,
Each month, I record a video address
that recaps what we've been working on the
previous month. Video and text of March's
Monthly Video Address are available below.

Hi, Im Robert Hurt. Thank
you for tuning into our Monthly Video
Address.Today, I am at Montpelier, in
Orange County, Virginia, the home of James
and Dolley Madison. On March 16th, we
recognized what would have been James
Madisons 264th birthday. Known as
the 'Father of the Constitution,' Madison
began his political career in the Virginia
House of Delegates and went on to serve as
the first representative of
Virginias Fifth District in Congress
before his election as president in 1808.
Not only was he instrumental to the
creation and adoption of our Constitution,
but he also shepherded the Bill of Rights
through the first Congress. It is vital
that we maintain and strengthen the
democratic system Madison helped develop,
which enabled our country to become what it
is today.
I appreciate the opportunity to share
with you some of what we have been working
on during the month of March. Earlier this
month,
Benjamin
Netanyahu addressed a joint meeting of
Congress . It was a great honor to have
Prime Minister Netanyahu come to the
Washington to reaffirm the importance of a
strong alliance between the United States
and Israel. As we all work to see freedom
and stability in the Middle East,
maintaining a strong strategic alliance
with Israel
our greatest ally in
the region
is of critical
importance.
I
am grateful for Prime Minister
Netanyahus leadership
in the
effort to prevent a nuclear Iran and that
the American people had this opportunity to
receive his invaluable perspective on these
critical issues.
This month,
we
also passed two bills to reform the
Environmental Protection Agency . Every
day, we see EPA regulations that
significantly hinder job growth and
continue to make life more difficult for
our family farmers and small businesses in
Virginias Fifth District. These two
bills represent a positive step forward in
ensuring that the EPA cannot arbitrarily
institute politically motivated regulations
that fail to consider the broader, negative
effects on American business. I was proud
to support these commonsense measures and
see them pass the House with bipartisan
support.
Just last week,
the
House passed its budget proposal
to put
our nation on a path to fiscal
sustainability. A budget is a framework
that makes important choices and sets
priorities needed to manage our limited
resources in the best interests of our
great country. A responsible budget is
essential to avoiding a fiscal crisis. Our
plan rejects the unsustainable status quo
of trillions of dollars in debt, an anemic
economic recovery, and a federal budget
that continues to run large annual
deficits.
This
legislation provides real solutions
that will balance the budget, grow the
economy, create more jobs and opportunity,
save and strengthen vital programs, and
ensure our national security. The Senate
also joined us in passing its annual budget
resolution, and now we will begin the
appropriations process to allocate
resources to vital federal programs. I
remain committed to working with my
colleagues to set our fiscal house in order
so that we can grow our economy and build a
stronger America for our children and
grandchildren.
This month,
I
introduced the Healthcare Consumer Privacy
Act
along with my Democratic colleague
Collin Peterson of Minnesota. This
commonsense legislation will enable
individuals to remove their profiles from
the federal healthcare website,
HealthCare.gov. Last year, a constituent
contacted our office to express his concern
over the fact that he was unable to delete
his profile from HealthCare.gov, even
though he decided not to sign up for the
healthcare coverage. After investigating
the issue and talking with the Department
of Health and Human Services, we discovered
that others were experiencing the same
problem and that HHS had no justification
for this policy.
Thats why
we
introduced the Healthcare Consumer Privacy
Act
- to enable individuals to remove
their profiles and personal information
from the federal website. While I remain
focused on repealing the Presidents
healthcare law and replacing it with
market-oriented healthcare reforms, the
Healthcare Consumer Privacy Act is a
critical step in the interim to protect
individuals personal information. It
is my hope that this commonsense,
bipartisan bill moves swiftly through the
legislative process, and I look forward to
working with Representative Peterson and my
colleagues to ensure that individual
privacy is protected.
As we close, let us always remember the
principles for which Madison stood and
advocated and made our nation a beacon of
democracy for all the world to see. I hope
you and your family take the opportunity to
visit this beautiful home and bear witness
to the incredible history on display here
at Montpelier.
If we may ever be of service to you, I
encourage you to contact us at one of our
district offices or our Washington office.
