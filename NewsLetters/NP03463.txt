Dear Friend,
A strong education is
an integral part of life and a college education is a proven gateway to
the middle class. Last week, the President announced a proposal that
would allow more people to take that step toward improving their
lives. Making two years of community college free to those willing to put
in the hard work would put the dream of a college education within
reach for millions of Americans and their families.
Community
colleges play a special role in our country. By providing higher
education to people in their own neighborhoods, these schools allow people
to reach for their dreams. I have always been a staunch supporter of
our community colleges. I was proud to be the speaker for Delgado
Community Colleges fall 2014 commencement ceremony, during which 830
students graduated. If the Presidents plan becomes a reality, many more
Louisianans and citizens across the country will have the opportunity to
achieve that same goal.
Under this proposal students that
maintain a 2.5 GPA, attend school at least half time, and make steady
progress toward their degree would be eligible to earn the first half
of a bachelors degree at no cost to them. If enacted this would save
students an average of $3,800 in tuition per year. In addition, the
maximum Pell Grant award would be increased by $1,000 in order to help
students complete their bachelors degree with less financial
strain.
As our economy continues to improve and the job market
evolves there will be a much greater demand for high-skilled workers.
Proactive policies such as this are critical to preparing the American
workforce for this new marketplace and make us much more competitive in the
global economy. Sky rocketing tuition costs have priced far too many
dedicated students out of pursuing their education goals, particularly
in Louisiana. This innovative approach can begin to close that gap
and help provide a pathway to the middle class.
I look
forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to move this proposal
forward and make it a reality for students throughout the
nation.
Sincerely,
Congressman Cedric Richmond
2nd Congressional
District of Louisiana
