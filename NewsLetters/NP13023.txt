It's Time to Restore the Voting Rights Act
Dear Friend,
This week, we recognize the remarkable life of Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr., and his quest - his dream - for the United States to "live out the
true meaning of its creed" that "all men are created equal." Our nation
has made great progress toward fulfilling the dream of Dr. King and all
those who fought for civil rights and greater economic opportunity. But
today injustice still exists in our society and the struggle for voting
rights continues.
The landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act sought to end racial discrimination
at the ballot box and it is one of the most hard-fought and important
civil rights laws in our nation's history. But in June 2013, the
Supreme Court issued an egregious ruling that gutted a key provision of
the law and represented a major step backward for voting rights,
justice and equality.
That is why it is important that Congress acts to strengthen the Voting
Rights Act as soon as possible. I am proud to support bipartisan
legislation (H.R. 3899) to restore the law's core protections that are
still essential to ensuring equal access to the fundamental right to
vote. The bill establishes a new formula to determine whether any state
or locality - not just those with a history of racial discrimination -
should be required to get federal approval for changes to voting rules
and practices.
This legislation is an important step forward and I am urging the House
Republican leadership to bring it to the floor for vote. In addition,
we must also do more to address the discriminatory impact of voter
identification laws that create obstacles for eligible voters seeking
to exercise their right to vote.
As we commemorate Dr. King's legacy and achievements, let us recommit
ourselves to fighting for justice in our communities and ensuring all
of our citizens have equal rights and the opportunity to succeed.
Sincerely,
Allyson Y. Schwartz
Member of Congress

It&#8217;s
Time
to
Restore
the
Voting
Rights
Act
Dear
Friend,
This
week,
we
recognize
the
remarkable
life
of
Dr.
Martin
Luther
King
Jr.,
and
his
quest
&#8211;
his
dream
&#8211;
for
the
United
States
to
"live
out
the
true
meaning
of
its
creed"
that
"all
men
are
created
equal."
Our
nation
has
made
great
progress
toward
fulfilling
the
dream
of
Dr.
King
and
all
those
who
fought
for
civil
rights
and
greater
economic
opportunity.
But
today
injustice
still
exists
in
our
society
and
the
struggle
for
voting
rights
continues.
The
landmark
1965
Voting
Rights
Act
sought
to
end
racial
discrimination
at
the
ballot
box
and
it
is
one
of
the
most
hard-fought
and
important
civil
rights
laws
in
our
nation&#8217;s
history.
But
in
June
2013,
the
Supreme
Court
issued
an
egregious
ruling
that
gutted
a
key
provision
of
the
law
and
represented
a
major
step
backward
for
voting
rights,
justice
and
equality.
That
is
why
it
is
important
that
Congress
acts
to
strengthen
the
Voting
Rights
Act
as
soon
as
possible.
I
am
proud
to
support
bipartisan
legislation
(H.R.
3899)
to
restore
the
law&#8217;s
core
protections
that
are
still
essential
to
ensuring
equal
access
to
the
fundamental
right
to
vote.
The
bill
establishes
a
new
formula
to
determine
whether
any
state
or
locality
-
not
just
those
with
a
history
of
racial
discrimination
-
should
be
required
to
get
federal
approval
for
changes
to
voting
rules
and
practices.
This
legislation
is
an
important
step
forward
and
I
am
urging
the
House
Republican
leadership
to
bring
it
to
the
floor
for
vote.
In
addition,
we
must
also
do
more
to
address
the
discriminatory
impact
of
voter
identification
laws
that
create
obstacles
for
eligible
voters
seeking
to
exercise
their
right
to
vote.
As
we
commemorate
Dr.
King's
legacy
and
achievements,
let
us
recommit
ourselves
to
fighting
for
justice
in
our
communities
and
ensuring
all
of
our
citizens
have
equal
rights
and
the
opportunity
to
succeed.
