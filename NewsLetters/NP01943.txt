David -- Medicare&rsquo;s future is in serious danger:
The House is voting TOMORROW on a disastrous budget that would privatize Medicare by turning it into a voucher system.
We need 50,000 strong before tomorrow&rsquo;s vote to stop Tea Party extremists from destroying Medicare as we know it.

Tell the Tea Party to protect Medicare &gt;&gt;
If this plan passes, it would be absolutely devastating to the 1.9 million seniors in Illinois who&rsquo;ve worked hard and paid into Medicare for their entire lives.
Cheri won&rsquo;t let that happen. Not when the stakes are so high for Illinois seniors and families. But we don&rsquo;t have much time left, so don&rsquo;t wait to sign your name.
