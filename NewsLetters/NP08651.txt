Friend,
The science is in - it&#39;s been in for quite some time. Climate change is real. It is a fact. It is happening, and it is happening right now.
And it&#39;s our responsibility to do something about it.
Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle refuse to believe that climate change is a real and pressing danger. They&#39;re ignoring the science - to the detriment of our future.
Will you join thousands of others across the country to tell them it&#39;s time to face reality?
Sign our petition now to demand Congress take action on climate change before it&#39;s too late.
And then there&#39;s my opponent. He actually OPPOSES any government action to combat climate change - and given his campaign&#39;s support from Big Oil and the Koch brothers, it&#39;s no surprise.
That&#39;s exactly why we have to speak up.
Add your voice - sign here now and help protect the only home we have.
Thanks for taking action.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California&#39;s 7th District
