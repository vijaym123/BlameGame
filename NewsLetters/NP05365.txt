WEEK IN REVIEW
Last Saturday, I
spent the afternoon cheering on the Razorbacks. Despite the tough loss
against Alabama, it was great to be in good company at Broyles Field.
Woo Pig Sooie!
On Wednesday, I
headed over to Carroll County, where I hosted Coffee with the
Congressman in Berryville. Thank you to all of those who took time out of
their mornings to share coffee and your questions with me.
After
coffee, I went over to the Carroll County Learning Center, which is
celebrating its 40-year anniversary this month. It was an honor to
celebrate with the center, see its new library, and read
Pete the
Cat
to its kids! Thanks for having me. From there, I made my way to
Eureka Springs to visit the Writers' Colony at Dairy Hollow. For those of
you who do not know, the Writers Colony is a unique residency program
specifically for writers, artists, composers, architects, and chefs!
Afterwards, I had an informal gathering with the Eureka Chamber and a
number of local business owners to discuss their concerns, talk
economic development, and answer their questions. My thanks to all those who
made my day in Carroll County a success.
On
Thursday, I hosted Coffee with the Congressman at the Elkins Community
Center. Thanks to those who came; I enjoyed our thoughtful conversation.
While at the community center, I ran into some Elkins High School
students, who were there volunteering. Their service to our community serves
as an example for all of us , and I am certainly grateful for it. GO
ELKS! From the community center, I headed to the Beaver Water
District headquarters to meet with Larry Lloyd, Beaver Waters Chief
Operating Officer, and discuss the use of chlorine gas in our water
treatment process and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). After our
meeting, I made my way to Springdale, where I visited JV Manufacturing,
Inc.
At JV, I got a full tour of its facility, learned about the
companys recycling renovations, discussed bringing manufacturing
back to the U.S., and met with several of the companys employees. Thank
you to everyone who was part of my day!
I spent today
in Fort Smith. My first stop in the River Valley was 5 News. Watch for
me on this weekends morning shows! After my interview, I headed over
to Exide Technologies
one of the world's largest producers and
distributors of batteries
to tour its industrial energy manufacturing
facility. Thanks for showing me how 2-volt batteries are made right in
Fort Smith. After a necessary stop at Georges for lunch, I sat down
with the leadership at Goodyear Commercial Tire &amp; Service, which is
headquartered right in Fort Smith! Thank you for getting me up to
speed on the industry and its impact in the Third
District.
Finally, Id like to
wrap up this weeks From the Front with a prayer for all those involved
in Thursday mornings train derailment in Washington County. My
gratitude goes out to the rescue workers who quickly and capably responded
to this emergency. I have had the opportunity to visit the site myself
and meet with investigators, and I will continue to monitor the
situation closely and assist any way I can.
Until next week!
From the Front...
