Dear Friend,
Everyone says the Republicans are going to take over the Senate. Here&rsquo;s a snapshot of how seven national models see the GOP&rsquo;s chances of a takeover in November.
59% from Nate Silver. 66% from Daily Kos.
94% from the
Washington Post.
But even in the most pessimistic scenarios, Democrats have a chance if we put everything we&rsquo;ve got into the final weeks of this campaign. Control of the Senate is going to come down to who is able to mobilize their voters. Please give our field teams the resources they need -- contribute $5 toward our $16O,OOO goal for October.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
I&rsquo;m a big believer in making your own luck. Democrats can hold the Senate,
but only if we make a serious push in the final weeks of the campaign.
Our best chance lies in a well-funded ground operation. And despite what all the pundits and pollsters may say, you and I know that if we keep on pounding the pavement, if we keep on spreading the message that a GOP majority is nothing but bad news for the middle class, we can win this.
If all of us pull together, we can make it happen. We need $16O,OOO by the end of this month. Help us get the funds we need to win by giving $5.
Thanks for your support.
