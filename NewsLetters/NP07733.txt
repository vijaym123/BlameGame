Dear Friend,
Women in the Hudson Valley are more likely to be the breadwinners, caretakers, innovators, and leaders at home and at work. As the father of two young girls, we have to do more to eliminate barriers and increase opportunities for women to succeed. We all benefit when women are treated equally because it makes our families, communities and economy stronger.
That's why on
Saturday, July 26th
from
10:00 AM to 12:00 PM , I will be hosting a free
"When Women Succeed, America Succeeds" Forum and Resource Fair
at the
Orange County Emergency Services Center .
The Forum and Resource Fair will connect women in the Hudson Valley with information and resources on financial security, food and nutrition, healthcare, legal services, childcare services, elder care, job training programs, higher education and homeownership.
