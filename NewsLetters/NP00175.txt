Dear Friends,
This week, I joined Sen. Mike
Lee of Utah in reintroducing legislation to bolster religious
liberty. Our First Amendment Defense Act safeguards individuals and
institutions who promote traditional marriage.
The U.S. Supreme
Court is soon to decide whether the Constitution forbids the states from
retaining the traditional definition of marriage as a union between one
man and one woman.
I hope the Court affirms the right of
the people in each state to choose -- through their elected
representatives -- the laws that govern them. But whatever the Court decides, our
bill is necessary to clarify and strengthen federal
law.
The First Amendment Defense Act would prevent any federal agency from
denying a tax exemption, grant, contract, license, or certification to
an individual, association, or business based on their belief that
marriage is a union between a man and a woman. For example, the bill
would prohibit the IRS from stripping a church of its tax exemption for
refusing to officiate same-sex weddings.
Our bill ensures
that the federal government does not penalize Americans for following
their religious beliefs or moral convictions on traditional marriage. Our
bill shields against federal intrusion without taking anything away
from anyone. In a shifting landscape, its time that Congress
proactively defend this sacred right.
My House bill, H.R. 2802, has
57 cosponsors. Sen. Lees S. 1598 has 18 cosponsors, including Idaho
Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch. We introduced similar bills in the last
Congress, then titled the Marriage and Religious Freedom
Act.
Our sustained effort springs from a fundamental element of
American liberty, the freedom to live and act in the public square according
to ones religious beliefs.
America set the standard for
upholding freedom of belief and worship in a diverse society. No
American should ever doubt the protections in the First
Amendment.
Thank
you ,
