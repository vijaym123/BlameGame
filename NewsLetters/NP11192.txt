Protecting America's Internet Interests - DOTCOM Act Introduced
On Thursday, along with Representatives John Shimkus and Marsha
Blackburn, I introduced the Domain Openness Through Continued Oversight
Matters (DOTCOM) Act.
This bill is in response to the Department of
Commerce announcement
that the U.S. would relinquish its oversight of the
Internet's domain name system (DNS) to a poorly-defined 'global
Internet community.'
The internet is the single greatest economic machine created in the
last 50 years and is a shining example of our American Exceptionalism.
It is against our own national economic interest to relinquish control,
especially without a clear path forward that will protect internet
freedom and American interests.
Learn more about the DOTCOM Act here
.

Improving Consumer Safety & Transparency - Rokita Introduces STICRS Act
Also on Thursday, I introduced the Safety Through Informed Consumers
Act (STICRS).
The STICRS Act requires the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration (NHTSA) to integrate active safety technology
into their current crashworthiness rating system.
The STICRS Act will give Americans new information that is critical to
making the automobile choice that is right for themselves and their
families.
In addition, it will showcase the cutting edge safety
technologies that American innovators are developing every day to
improve automobile safety.
Many of these technologies are developed
right here in Indiana.
Learn more about the STICRS Act in an op-ed I wrote for the Washington
Times during the Washington Auto Show earlier this year here

Putting Hoosiers Back to Work - GE Aviation Announces Lafayette Plant
On Wednesday, it was announced that GE Aviation will break ground on a
new plant with a $92 million investment that will create hundreds of
jobs for greater Lafayette and Tippecanoe County.
Watch my welcome remarks here
.
This occasion is a testament to the work of Lafayette and western
Indiana community, civic, and business and elected leaders. As you
often hear me say, our area of the state is a national model for strong
leadership that puts partisanship aside and recognizes that pro-growth,
common sense policies are needed for Indiana and America to compete in
the world and win in the 21st century.
In particular, it's a testament to the forward looking leadership of
Governor Pence and his predecessor.
He continues the aiming higher
culture that Governor Daniels began and which has given Indiana "best
of class" status.
It was an honor to work on Indiana's transformation for eight years as
Indiana's Secretary of State, and now serve with Governor Pence and
President Daniels as we work for Indiana, including with our talented
and committed new partner GE aviation.
As an aviator myself, I welcome the aviation industry's growth in our
state. I know GE Aviation to be the high water mark in commercial
aviation.
We simply couldn't ask for a better new neighbor.

Reforming Workforce Development - Education and Workforce Committee
Field Hearing - Mesa, AZ
Last week, along with my Education and the Workforce colleagues, I took
part in a full committee field hearing in Mesa, Arizona titled
"Reviving Our Economy: Supporting a 21st Century Workforce
."
Rep. Rokita and Colleagues Listen to Testimony 3-20-14
Field hearings like this one are an important investigative tool as
Congress considers legislation, but they are also an opportunity to
speak with state and local leaders about solutions that are working in
their state.
Education and training are critical to empowering people to be
productive members of the workforce, in addition to helping build
better lives for themselves and their families.
Rep. Rokita talks with Career Fair attendees 2-7-14
An efficient and effective job training system is vital to
strengthening our American workforce.
It is important to support our
colleges, universities, technical training facilities, as well as
workforce investment boards, like Indiana's Department of Workforce
Development
.
That is why I partnered with these stakeholders when hosting
a Career Fair in Kokomo
earlier this year.

The GA Pilot Protection Act Gains Altitude
Earlier this month, the General Aviation Pilot Protection Act, a bill I
introduced, along with several GA Caucus colleagues, to expand an
exemption to private, non-business flights for small airplanes, cleared
yet another hurdle.
A companion bill was introduced in the United States Senate by Senators
John Boozman (R-AR), Jerry Moran (R-KS), and Pat Roberts (R-KS).
Both
the House and Senate bills continue to gain bipartisan cosponsors.
You can learn more about the bill here
.
I thank the senators for their leadership in introducing the Senate
version of the General Aviation Pilot Protection Act
.
I look forward to working with them to
pass this bill in both chambers to spur jobs and growth in the general
aviation industry.
In addition to the Senate companion bill, I was able to join my
colleague, Representative David Schweikert
, last week, for an aviation policy roundtable at Landmark
Aviation
, housed at the Scottsdale, Arizona airport.
Checking Out Landmark Aviation's Fleet
Participants in the roundtable discussed federal regulations that
impact the ability to grow and expand their businesses.
We also
discussed the General Aviation (GA) Pilot Protection Act.
Small airport owners and operators are supportive of our efforts to
pass the GA Pilot Protection Act
because it means jobs for the people of
Arizona, just as it means jobs for Hoosiers.
A vibrant GA industry
means more jobs, period.

efforts in Washington. Take care.

Field
hearings

are
an

they
are
also
an
opportunity
to
speak
with
state
and
local
leaders
about
solutions
that
are
working in
their
state.
Education
and

are
critical

An

is
vital to
strengthening
our
American

It
is
important
to
support
our
colleges,

boards,

Indiana's
