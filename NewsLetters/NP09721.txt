A Message from Representative Sean Duffy
May 11, 2014
Dear friends,
What a week! While the arrival of our daughter has absolutely been the
top story in the Duffy house this week, the U.S. House of
Representatives made some headlines as well.
Select Committee on Benghazi: Although I was home for the birth of our
daughter, I offered a statement for the record in support of this
select committee. I am hopeful that this committee will finish the much
needed work of holding the Administration accountable for its failures
surrounding this attack, deliver justice to those terrorists who
murdered these four Americans, and bring peace to the families of the
victims. To read my entire statement on the matter, please click here
.
Choices for Our Children: The 7th District has the 25th highest number
of charter schools in the country. All parents want choices and
opportunities for our children and charter schools provide those
options. Schools no longer have to be selected by where families buy
their house, and a zip code should no longer dictate the quality of
education our children receive. These things should be chosen based on
the education parents want their children to receive. I am very glad
the House passed H.R. 10, the Success and Opportunity through Quality
Charter Schools Act this week and I am a proud co-sponsor of this
legislation. For more on this bill and to read my full statement for
the record, click here

Paul Bunyan #ServiceAboveSelf Award: We have already received a strong
response to our 2014 Paul Bunyan #ServiceAboveSelf Award. As a
reminder, if you would like to nominate a 7th District friend or
neighbor whom you feel goes above and beyond to serve our community,
please go to Duffy.house.gov, of click on the image below, for full
details and to fill out a nomination form.
All nominations must be submitted by May 31, 2014. The winner will be
announced in conjunction with national Paul Bunyan Day on June 28th.
On a personal note: Our family is always grateful for the love and
support that so many have shown us, but that holds especially true this
week. Rachel, the kids, and I have been so touched by the incredible
amount of prayers and well wishes we received on the announcement of
our daughter's birth. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you. Below
is our first photo as a family of 9 (a selfie, of course).
I wish a very happy Mother's Day to all of the moms. I hope you enjoy
your day and feel the appreciation and love of your children and
families throughout the year. Until next week.
Have a great week,
Sean

A
Message
from
Representative
Sean
Duffy
May 11, 2014
Dear
friends,
What
a
week!
While
the
arrival
of
our
daughter
has
absolutely
been
the
top
story
in
the
Duffy
house
this
week,
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives
made
some
headlines
as
well.
Select
Committee
on
Benghazi:
Although
I
was
home
for
the
birth
of
our
daughter,
I
offered
a
statement
for
the
record
in
support
of
this
select
committee.
I
am
hopeful
that
this
committee
will
finish
the
much
needed
work
of
holding
the
Administration
accountable
for
its
failures
surrounding
this
attack,
deliver
justice
to
those
terrorists
who
murdered
these
four
Americans,
and
bring
peace
to
the
families
of
the
victims.

my
entire
statement

the

Choices
for
Our
Children:
The
7th
District
has
the
25th
highest
number
of
charter
schools
in
the
country.
All
parents
want
choices
and
opportunities
for
our
children
and
charter
schools
provide
those
options.
Schools
no
longer
have
to
be
selected
by
where
families
buy
their
house,
and
a
zip
code
should
no
longer
dictate
the
quality
of
education
our
children
receive.
These
things
should
be
chosen
based
on
the
education
parents
want
their
children
to
receive.
I
am
very
glad
the
House
passed
H.R.
10,
the
Success
and
Opportunity
through
Quality
Charter
Schools
Act
this
week
and
I
am
