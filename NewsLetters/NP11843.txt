Diocese of El Paso Turns 100, USDA Folks meet with Ranchers and
Farmers, Presidio and Marathon Receive Grants for Infrastructure Studies
Hello Friend,
A busy week both in Washington and Texas. I participated in a House
Armed Services Committee hearing on U.S. military efforts to diminish
the flow of drugs to our country. Field Representatives Matt Hall,
Cynthia Martinez and Julie Morton visited with constituents from Sutton
to Loving to Uvalde counties. Here's a quick wrap up of the week.

Diocese of El Paso Turns 100!
On Monday, March 3, the Roman Catholic Diocese of El Paso celebrates
its 100th anniversary. I spoke on the floor of the House commemorating
their anniversary and wished them well for the next 100 years. To watch

House Armed Services Hearing on U.S. Northern and Southern Command
Operations
During Wednesday's House Armed Services Committee hearing on "The
Posture of the U.S. Northern Command and U.S. Southern Command," I
questioned General John Kelly and General Charles Jacoby about border
security issues. During the hearing they shared information about best
practices to decrease the flow of drugs from South and Central America
to the United States. As a life-long Texan, and having been raised
along the U.S.-Mexico border, I know it's important to find innovative
ways to protect the border, our kids and communities from drugs and
those wishing to harm our country. To watch my questions and their
answers, click here

USDA Holds Roundtable Meeting in Lytle, Meets with Ranchers and Farmers
This week top Department of Agriculture (USDA) officials - Krysta
Harden, Judy Canales, Salvador Salinas and Danny Torres - held a "Strike
Force" for Rural Growth and Opportunity Roundtable Discussion in Lytle.
Field Representative Matt Hall was on hand to meet with constituents,
ranchers, and farmers to discuss issues affecting them. I thank the
USDA staff for meeting with the agriculture community in the 23rd
District of Texas. I'd also note that Ms. Canales has deep family roots
in the 23rd District of Texas. She is from Eagle Pass. As a member of
the House Agriculture Committee, I continue to look for opportunities
and more resources for southwest Texans.
Garner Field in Uvalde Receives $100K Grant
Garner Field in Uvalde County, named after the 32nd Vice President of
the United States, John Garner, received a $100,000 grant from the
Texas Department of Transportation. The funding will be used for
planned airport improvements, including engineering and design and
pavement improvements. Garner Field has long been of importance to me.
While serving in the Texas Legislature, I helped secure funding for the
construction of a terminal at the airport.
Upgrading infrastructure throughout southwest Texas is important not
only for the creation of jobs but also to improve quality of life.
These funds will help Garner Field grow and provide even more services
to customers.
Presidio and Marathon Receive Grants for Water Infrastructure Studies
Marathon and Presidio received funding from the Border Environment
Cooperation Commission for project development activities. Marathon
will receive $98,400 for a preliminary engineering report that will
provide information on infrastructure problems and ways to address
them. Presidio will receive $80,000 for a preliminary engineering
report that will study the possibility of expanding a water system to
the Las Palmas Colonia.
Students Encouraged to Apply for CHCI Internship
I encourage Hispanic college students to apply for internships with the
Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute (CHCI). The CHCI offers Latino
college students an opportunity to get involved in the political and
public service process by interning at a congressional office. These
internships provide a unique experience to students as they become part
of an integral team of professionals that help carry out the tasks,
agendas and goals of a member of Congress - truly a rewarding
experience. I would love to see a lot of students from the 23rd
District of Texas apply. For more information on the application
process, call the office or visit www.chci.org
Lastly, thanks again for letting me be your congressman. If I can help
you with a federal agency or issue, please call on any of our offices.
The phone numbers and addresses are listed below. I've never been a big
fan of politics - helping people is my favorite part of the job. Please
put us to work for you.
Sincerely,
Pete P. Gallego
Spent the day with Julie Morton, her mother, Lisa Morton, Rita Weigart
and Ashley Webb on Valentine's Day in Valentine, Texas. More than 1,100
people attended the event.
I joined Congressman Beto O'Rourke of El Paso and Major General Sean
MacFarland at El Paso's State of the Congress.
I helped parishioners from Emmanuel A.M.E Church on San Antonio's east
side during a mobile food pantry hosted jointly with the San Antonio
Food Bank.
Members of the Credit Union National Association visited the office on
Thursday to talk about issues affecting credit unions across the
country and in Texas.
