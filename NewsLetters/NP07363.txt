David -- Thank You!!!
When Boehner and the Tea Party Republicans tried to tear down President Obama, you responded with a loud, clear message: If you mess with President Obama, you&rsquo;re messing with all of us.
That&rsquo;s over 517,000 online donations backing up President Obama!
In fact, we just had our best online week EVER: $4.8 million to defeat Boehner&rsquo;s Republicans! (Boehner was not happy with us)
Each and every one of those donations was from a grassroots supporter like you:
The average donation was less than 20 bucks.
And those dollars are already at work registering, educating, and turning out
1 million new voters
in the final 100 days of this election.
(watch Michelle&rsquo;s video) We just can&rsquo;t thank you enough -- you&rsquo;ve made this all possible!
Sincerely, all of us at the DCCC!
