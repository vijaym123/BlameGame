Dear
Friends,
This week, I introduced a bill designed to reform the Antiquities Act
by restraining unilateral presidential restrictions on federal
lands.
The National Monument Designation Transparency and
Accountability Act is the House companion to Sen. Mike Crapos S. 228,
introduced last month.
My bill requires approval by Congress and
the legislature of any state with a proposed national monument before
the president can formally designate the monument. The legislation
also requires congressional approval and public input before restricting
access to public lands in the proposed monument.
In 1906,
Congress passed the Antiquities Act out of concern about theft from
archeological sites. Since then, 16 presidents have designated 139
monuments that include over 500 million acres of land and marine habitat,
often without support from local communities, user groups and
Congress.
The result has often been disruption of local economies and
forever blocking utilization of important natural resources, as well
as traditional recreational use.
Presidents in both parties
have overstepped the original intent of the law. In Idaho, the
current threat of a presidential designation of a Boulder-White Clouds
National Monument has distorted the debate on how to manage those
lands.
Too often, presidents have used the Antiquities Act to
intimidate. The bullying is all too real in public lands states like Idaho,
where 64 percent of the land is owned by the federal
government.
It is time for Congress to restore the balance between the
branches.
Its also vital that local communities, user groups
and state elected officials have a chance to be heard in an open
legislative process.
Vast landscapes shouldnt suddenly become off
limits at the stroke of a presidential
pen.
Thank
you ,
