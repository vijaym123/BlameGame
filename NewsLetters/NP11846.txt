Dear Friend:
Our fight to expand the American
Dream and build ladders of opportunity for everyone is going strong. In
Washington, we're charging ahead to build an economy that works for
every working family, not just the super
rich.
Petition To Raise Minimum Wage:
This week I signed a
discharge petition to demand a vote on the Fair Minimum Wage Act (H.R.
1010), which increases the federal minimum wage over three years from
$7.25 to $10.10 per hour. While the bill was introduced on March 6,
2013, Republican leadership has failed to schedule a hearing or a mark-up
on it. The Congressional Budget Office, economists and experts agree
that this is the best thing to do for our economy. I'm fighting to give
America a raise, to put more money in the pockets of millions of
consumers, and to grow our economy.
My
Brother's Keeper's" Initiative:
I'm honored to be of the few
Members of Congress to be invited by the President to attend the White
House launch of his My Brothers Keeper initiative. This exciting new
plan aims to find ways in which business and civic leaders can
intervene at just the right moment to keep young men of color on a
successful course. Growing up poor in the streets of Harlem, I know firsthand
the value of providing opportunities to those who may not have adequate
resources to begin with. As a founding Member of the Congressional
Black Caucus and Representative of one of the largest minority
populations in the nation, I have dedicated my life to ensuring that everyone
has the tools to succeed in life, regardless of background. I'm proud
to join the President's effort to unlock the full potential of those
who need some guidance
something that will not only benefit them, but
all Americans.
EITC for Childless
Workers Act of 2014:
I introduced a bill to extend the
Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to single workers without children. While
the EITC has consistently provided relief for working families with
children, it has largely excluded childless workers.
My bill
decreases the qualifying age for single people from 25 to 21, which
would give young people some extra money in their pockets. Not only would
this lift more people out of poverty, but also stimulate economic
growth. I've been working hard to protect and expand the EITC since I
fought hard to include it the 1986 tax reform bill.
Ill keep doing
so until every worker earns a living wage that can help them get
ahead, not just make ends meet.
