Greetings,
Id like to invite you to
view my new television show, A Capitol Idea with Chaka Fattah. The
show, which airs Sundays at 5pm on the PCN network, will be seen in
three million households across the Commonwealth and will offer in-depth
discussions on topics of interest to our community and share an
insiders view on current policy issues by engaging with thought leaders,
community advocates, government officials and
newsmakers.
Interviews will spotlight my work representing Pennsylvanias Second
Congressional District and my legislative policy priorities
neuroscience, manufacturing, youth mentoring, GEAR-UP and
cooperatives.
Throughout the 30 years Ive spent in public service, Ive met
and worked with countless individuals in Philadelphia and across the
country who are devoting their time to improving the lives of
individuals and families across the globe. This program is an opportunity to
share these ideas and stories and engage in conversation with people who
have worked alongside me to transform our communities for the
better.
The first episode of A Capitol Idea, will focus on
manufacturing and includes interviews with House Democratic Whip Steny
Hoyer (MD-05) and local CEO Alix James, of the Nielsen-Kellerman Company.
The show, which can be viewed
here , will also
highlight my new manufacturing initiative that is included in the 2014
Congressional spending bill and signed into law by President Obama two
weeks ago.
On the next episode of A Capitol
Idea, well focus on neuroscience, specifically, Amyotrophic Lateral
Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrigs disease.
You can view
the show on Comcast channel 186. If you miss it there, all episodes will
be available on my YouTube channel:
