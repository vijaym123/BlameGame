2014 Congressional Art Competition opens - It's time again for high school students from the Northern Marianas to showcase their talents in the annual Congressional Art Competition. One artist from each of the 441 congressional districts is selected to have their work exhibited at the U.S. Capitol for Members of Congress, their staff, and tens of thousands of visitors to see. A panel of our local artists chooses the winning art. This is the sixth year for the Northern Marianas to participate. Previous years' winners were Rosanna L. Camacho, Bryan Jose Obaldo Deleon Guerrero, Hannah Alcordo, and Krisna Balolong, all from Marianas High School, and Aaron Tomokane of Kagman High School. Students have often chosen themes that portray our islands and cultures, but applicants are welcome to express their creative vision and talents in any way that inspires them. Information packets with more details about the competition are being sent to all Marianas high schools and are also available on the web at http://sablan.house.gov/serving-you/art-competition or contact your local congressional office. The deadline for entries is Friday, April 11, 2014.
NOAA nautical charts now available in digital format - The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is now providing digital versions of its nautical charts
of the Northern Mariana Islands and other U.S. coastal areas. These free charts are especially valued by boaters, who use them to plan sailing routes and fishing trips and to avoid shoals and other hazards to navigation. The charts, in PDF format, are part of a suite of new and enhanced navigational products NOAA's Office of Coast Survey
has designed to make its data more accessible to the public and to respond to the needs of mariners in the digital age. Begun by President Thomas Jefferson in 1807, Coast Survey charts our nation's waters, surveys the coastal seafloor, responds to maritime emergencies, and searches for underwater obstructions that pose a danger to navigation.

Congratulations to the CNMI Public School System, the State Board of Education, and to PSS students, teachers, and staff for being granted a five-year, district-wide accreditation
from the North Central Association and Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement this week! The reason for this distinction could be seen at Ms. Arlene Cholymay's 6th grade class at Oleai Elementary School, where I visited at the invitation of one of her students. There were many insightful questions about the work of their congressional representative both here at home and in Washington, DC.
Thank you, Ms. Cholymay and students, for your hospitality!
Go Turtles!

Mobtasim Alam of Marianas High School (center) and Mebric Navisaga of Kagman High School (right) are representing our islands at the Junior State of America Winter Congress here in Washington this week. They took time out for a visit to their congressional office and a staff-led tour the U.S. Capitol, accompanied by Mr. Manzural Alam, Mobtasim's father (left). At the JSA Congress over one thousand students take on the role of Members of Congress and simulate the legislative process. Representative Mobtasim and Senator Mebric plan to introduce a bill regulating the sale of firearms. Both students received a federal scholarship to attend. Congratulations!
President's budget drops Social Security cuts - I have regularly cosponsored legislation that bases Social Security cost-of-living increases on the reality of seniors' lives. The elderly spend more of their income on prescription drugs, for instance; and the prices for drugs are rising more quickly than for other goods. Cost-of-living should likewise go up. I have also regularly joined with other Members of Congress in opposition to calculating annual cost-of-living increases
on what economists' call "chained CPI." The result would be relatively lower benefits over time for seniors and for veterans, as well. President Obama has now announced that he will be dropping his support for chained CPI, when his Fiscal Year 2015 budget is released in March. Previously, the President had agreed to consider chained CPI, which would reduce federal spending, if Republicans in Congress would consider closing tax loopholes that benefit corporations and the wealthy, which would also help reduce our nation's deficit. But Congress has not responded with any legislation. So the President will be taking his offer off the table, reducing the threat to seniors and veterans from chained CPI.
