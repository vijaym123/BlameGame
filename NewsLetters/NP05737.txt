David, sorry for the early morning email, but this is important:
Speaker Boehner and the Republicans are set to spend over $4 MILLION to defeat Brad. Why? With 30 days to go, our race is in a DEAD HEAT.
Republicans think with enough cash they can just buy this election for Bob Dold. If we don&rsquo;t respond, their strategy could work.
David, time is running out to break the tie. Can we count on you to have Brad&rsquo;s back?
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Winning this race means knocking on more doors, talking to more voters, and chipping in the resources we need to make sure we can get out the facts.
If you wait, it may be too late to make a difference. Pitch in for Brad:
