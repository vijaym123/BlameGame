Dear
Friend,
Today,
Americans across the country will observe Veterans Day and honor those who
have served our nation in uniform.
I am immensely grateful to
all who have served or are currently serving in our Armed Forces and
the military families who support them.
This Veterans Day, we
pause to express our appreciation for the sacrifices of these brave
men and women. We do this by caring for our servicemembers when they
are abroad and when they come home. To that end, we must remain
committed to providing our veterans with quality health care and increasing
college access for those that have returned from Iraq and Afghanistan.
Nothing should stand in the way of our veterans having confidence in
and access to the care and benefits they have earned and
deserve.
After fighting for our nation overseas, no veteran should
have to fight for a job at home. We have taken steps to help our men
and women in uniform find good-paying jobs
ranging from providing tax
credits for businesses that hire veterans to creating a Veterans Job
Corp that helps veterans find pathways to work protecting and
rebuilding America.
2.4 million small
businesses
(nearly 1 in 10) in the U.S. are veteran-owned. The SBAs
Boots to Business: from Service to Startup
initiative,
launched in April 2012, provides entrepreneurship training for
transitioning servicemembers.
Veterans Day is an important time of
commemoration. However, our commitment and support must continue
year-round by volunteering our time and thanking them for the sacrifices they
have made to ensure our freedom. Putting your talents to work at a
local Veterans Affairs Medical Center will go a long way in showing that
appreciation. The
VA Voluntary Service
Office
can provide you information on how to volunteer locally. Please
visit their website for more information on how you can
contribute.
Again, to all our troops, reservists, veterans, and families,
thank you. You have our full gratitude. If you or your family have any
questions about veterans issues, please contact my
office.
Sincerely,
Congressman Cedric Richmond
2nd Congressional
District of Louisiana
