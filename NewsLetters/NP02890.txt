David -- As the new Chair of the DSCC, the question reporters keep asking me is &ldquo;Can Democrats really take back the Senate?&rdquo;
My honest answer:
Yes, we can. In fact, I won&rsquo;t be successful in this job unless we do.
We&rsquo;re starting out with an advantage: Twice as many Republicans are up for reelection as Democrats. We only need to win four out of the seven very vulnerable GOP seats to take the majority.
But if you think we can just sit back and wait for the win, keep dreaming.
Each one of those Republican seats is going to take a lot of hard work. And that work has to start now.
Will you join me? Will you pitch in in the next 48 hours to give Democrats the best possible chance to take the Senate?
My own elections in 2006 and 2012 showed me how important an early start is for a successful campaign. If we hadn&rsquo;t started as early as we did, I wouldn&#39;t have won. It&#39;s that simple.
Keep in mind that the earlier you give, the further your donation goes. If you give now, we&rsquo;ll even be able to go after Republicans who thought their seats were safe. We could make their loss a disastrous one.
I&#39;m in this race to win the majority. Nothing short of a full victory will cut it. Are you with me? I need you in the next 48 hours.
I appreciate your help,
Senator Jon Tester of Montana
