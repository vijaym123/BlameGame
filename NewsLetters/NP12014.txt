F-35
Maintenance Hangar Funding Finalized for Hill Air Force
Base
Yesterday, the Senate and the House finalized funding for the
construction of a new maintenance hangar at Hill Air Force Base for the F-35
stealth fighter jet. Operational maintenance will be performed inside
the hangar by the 388th Fighter Wing based at Hill. The funding was
originally included in the 2014 National Defense Appropriations Act,
but was removed in the Omnibus Bill. As a memeber of Senate Armed
Services Committee I pushed to allow and approve the Department of Defense
to reprogram funding needed for this construction. I was joined in this
effort by Senator Hatch and Congresman Bishop to also pressure the
Senate Committee on Appropriations, the House Armed Services Committee,
and the House Appropriations Committee to reprogram this
funding.
Now that all relevant committees have approved the reprogramming of
funding, the U.S. Air Force can begin construction on the
complex.
I was there when the first F-35 was delivered to Hill Air
Force Base, and I am pleased that this funding has been approved and
that the Air Force can finally start construction on the F-35
maintenance hangar. The arrival of the F-35 in Northern Utah next year begins a
significant new chapter for the Air Force and our state, and having
the facilities ready for this delivery is of upmost importance to
protecting and maintaining the taxpayer's investment in this weapons
system. We are excited that the future of military innovation and
technological advancement is continuing to be forged in our
state.
Reset Policy with
Russia has been a failure
This morning I attended an Armed
Services Committee hearing on our military's strategic and cyber
commands.
I am concerned that the President has decided we can
reduce our number of nuclear weapons for the wrong reasons, and have
been disturbed by recent reports about the Russian government
violating weapons treaties that they have signed with the United
States.
The President's reset policy with Russia has been a failure,
and we should not press forward with any new agreements with a country
that is not honoring current treaties.
