How to
Fix Congress: Five Steps To Restore Trust, Transparency, And
Empowerment
As a frequent critic of my partys strategic
timidityand as incoming chairman of the Senate Steering Committee, whose job it
is encourage bolder thinking and actionI thought it incumbent on me
to offer some concrete, early, and hopefully
constructive suggestions
about how the new Republican Congress might be
steered toward unity and success.
As you will see, the
ideas below are not really policy goals. (I have my own ideas about what
our partys reform agenda ought to be, and I will spend most of the
next two years advocating them.)
Rather, these are five
suggestions to my Republican colleagues to help repair the dysfunctional
legislative branch we have inherited, rebuild Congresss reputation
among the American people, and by extension slowly restore the publics
confidence in the Republican Party.

suggestions for fixing Congress
What would you like to see get done by
Republican Congress?
I've listed my ideas of what I think a
new Republican-controlled Congress can accomplish.
I would like
to get your feedback as well.
I will be holding
my monthly tele-townhall meeting
this Wednesday at 7:00 p.m. MT,
and you are invited to join the discussion and help me chart the new
course ahead:
