A Message from Representative Sean Duffy
December 22, 2013
Dear friends,
During this season of joy, I find myself more aware than maybe ever
before of the people in our community who are in need of great comfort
this Christmas. Whether it is a mother who is struggling to pay her
utility bill, or a father who is dealing with the loss of his family's
health insurance plan, this week I have been fortunate to work with
many people from our community on ways we can help the neediest among
us and hopefully make life a little more comfortable for them.
Building Effective Awareness: A year ago I sat down with many of the
pastors in Wausau and asked them, "What are the needs in our community?"
I was taken back when all of them commented on the issues of hunger and
homelessness in our community. I think I'm like a lot of people in our
community who don't know the issues that a lot of people who are having
a tough time are facing. I wanted to do what I could with my team to
make sure we can make a difference with those who have fallen on hard
times and make sure we can collaborate together on community resources.
Also collaborate on the Federal and state side to make sure resources
don't just flow to the urban parts of the country but can actually come
to the parts of the country that have real problems but don't have huge
staffs to cut through the red-tape.
This week, more than 100 people came together for our first Hunger &
Homelessness Summit. It was an honest conversation and ultimately a
productive one as well.
We found that by reaching out to each other
and building a coalition within our community we can be more effective
in our efforts to serve the neediest in our area. We are in the process
of uploading the entire summit on YouTube. Click on the image below to
watch it and keep checking back for more from the day long event.
They need an Obamcare exemption too: I joined with a bipartisan group
of Wisconsin Congressmen to ask U.S. Health and Human Services
Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to extend the federal Health Insurance
Risk-Sharing Plan (HIRSP) through March 31, 2014. Gov. Walker signed
legislation on Friday to extend current coverage for Wisconsin citizens
under several medical assistance programs, including HIRSP, through
March 31, 2014 citing the failed rollout of Obamacare. The Secretary
should offer all Americans with pre-existing and, in some cases, life
threatening conditions the same courtesy.
Not offering this extension nationwide could leave some of our poorest
and most medically vulnerable Americans without coverage. These
individuals should not lose their healthcare coverage due to technical
difficulties. This Administration is delaying multiple pieces of its
signature legislation on an almost daily basis because it is
politically convenient for them. It is our hope that the Secretary will
also offer an extension to the numerous Americans who have had their
lives inconvenienced by this ill-conceived law. To read the full letter
to Sec. Sebelius, click here.
Waiting in joyful hope: Our family is anxiously awaiting the birth of
our Lord this week and if you saw Rachel and my appearance on "Morning
Joe" you may have heard that our family is also very much looking
forward to the arrival of the newest addition to our Duffy clan. Click
on the image to watch the full announcement and the other topics we
discussed.
This is a very exciting time of year in our house. As we celebrate
Jesus' birth this week, we will also cherish this time together as a
family. Rachel, the kids, and I are always grateful for the kindness so
many of you have shown us. We hope that you are able to spend this time
surrounded by those you love as well. We wish you and yours a safe,
merry and very blessed Christmas season.
Merry Christmas,
Sean

A
Message
from
Representative
Sean
Duffy
December 22, 2013
Dear
friends,
During
this
season
of
joy,
I
find
myself
more
aware
than
maybe
ever
before
of
the
people
in
our
community
who
are
in
need
of
great
comfort
this
Christmas.
Whether
it
is
a
mother
who
is
struggling
to
pay
her
utility
bill,
or
a
father
who
is
dealing
with
the
loss
of
his
family&#8217;s
health
insurance
plan,
this
week
I
have
been
fortunate
to
work
with
many
people
from
our
community
on
ways
we
can
help
the
neediest
among
us
and
hopefully
make
life
a
little
more
comfortable
for
them.
Building
Effective
Awareness:
A
year
ago
I
sat
down
with
many
of
the
pastors
in
Wausau
and
asked
them,
&#8220;What
are
the
needs
in
our
community?&#8221;
I
was
taken
back
when
all
of
them
commented
on
the
issues
of
hunger
and
homelessness
in
our
community.
I
think
I&#8217;m
like
a
lot
of
people
in
our
community
who
don&#8217;t
know
the
issues
that
a
lot
of
people
who
are
having
a
tough
time
are
facing.
I
wanted
to
do
what
I
could
with
my
team
to
make
sure
we
can
make
a
difference
with
those
who
have
fallen
on
hard
times
and
make
sure
we
can
collaborate
together
on
community
resources.
Also
collaborate
on
the
Federal
and
state
side
to
make
sure
resources
don&#8217;t
just
flow
to
the
urban
parts
of
the
country
but
can
actually
come
to
the
parts
of
the
country
that
have
real
problems
but
don&#8217;t
have
huge
staffs
to
cut
through
the
red-tape.
This
week,
more
than
100
people
came
together
for
our
first
Hunger
&amp;
Homelessness
Summit.
It
was
an
honest
conversation
and
ultimately
a
productive
one
as
well.
We
found
that
by
reaching
out
to
each
other
and
building
a
coalition
within
our
community
we
can
be
more
effective
in
our
efforts
to
serve
the
neediest
in
our
area.
We
are
in
the
process
of
uploading
the
entire
summit

ask
U.S.

Kathleen
Sebelius

The

all
Americans

in

life
threatening

the

Not

our
poorest

most
medically

due

This
Administration
is

because
it
is
politically
convenient
for
them.
It
is
our

that
the
Secretary
will
also
offer
an extension
to
the
numerous
Americans
who
have
had
their
lives
inconvenienced
by
this
ill-conceived
law.

Rachel,

I
are
always
grateful

We
