Dear Friend,
In my last race, grassroots support from people like you meant all the difference against a Republican opponent who spent half a million dollars of his own money against me.
This year, you&rsquo;re going to be the difference-maker once again. Here&rsquo;s your supporter record, with a focus on our efforts in this month, which is the end of the FEC&rsquo;s fundraising quarter.
Name: Unspecified
Contribution this month:
PENDING
You sent me to the Senate, and you know I&rsquo;ll never stop fighting for our progressive priorities. But I need your help to win again this fall --
can you contribute $5 or more to help us close the FEC quarter strong?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
I know that families across the country are still struggling to make ends meet. Believe me, I don&rsquo;t like asking for money -- but with some of our major campaign finance laws struck down by the Supreme Court, it&rsquo;s the only way grassroots campaigns like ours can stay strong against a rising tide of outside spending. Please, if you&rsquo;re able, give $5 to our campaign to help us keep fighting.
Thanks for your support -- yesterday, today, and tomorrow.
