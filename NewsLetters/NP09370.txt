Dear
Friend,
Before I came back to Georgia this weekend, I visited Arlington National
Cemetery with several of my fellow new Members of
Congress.
What an honor.
We took a few minutes on a stunning spring
day in our nation's capital to remember the sacrifice of those who gave
their all for this country...some very recently.
On this
day that we've grown to welcome as the start of summer, please remember
those whose very real memories of someone no longer with us are
stirred today.
We can honor their memory by living this life, and
enjoying our freedom, to the fullest.
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member
of Congress
