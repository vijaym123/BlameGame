I know firsthand some of the challenges women can face in the workplace.
While my three boys were growing up, my husband Gerry and I worked opposite shifts to care for our sons. And thank goodness we had each other.
In 40 percent of American families today, women are the sole or primary breadwinners.
Simply put, women&rsquo;s economic success is key to a strong middle class. So why are they still making 77 cents to every dollar a man makes for the same work nationwide? And, even worse, women in my region of Illinois average just 70 cents! Because Congress has failed to act. Will you join me in calling on Congress to step up and pass equal pay legislation?

We&rsquo;ve been fighting this battle for far too long. It&rsquo;s time American women got the pay raise they deserve.
Add your name to our petition right now and say you support equal pay.
Don&rsquo;t wait until it&rsquo;s too late. http://action.cheribustos.com/Equal-Pay
Thanks for stepping up,
