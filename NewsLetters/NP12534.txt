Top Ten Things You Might Have Missed
My February
tele-townhall is scheduled for Wednesday night at 7:00 p.m. MT.
The last
few weeks in Washington have been pretty busy, so I wanted to share a
list of what I have been focused on in the Senate.
I look forward
to answering your questions about these developments or anything else
that is on your mind.
If you haven't done so already, you can
sign up to participate in my tele-townhalls here:
http://www.lee.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/tele-townhall-meetings.
Here is the list of highlights from the last few
weeks:
Learn about my proposal that seeks to
affirm religious liberty in the military
Listen to my interview with Doug Wright where we discussed my
response to the State of the Union Address
Read my op-ed: The Farm Bill vs. America
Read the text of my speech: Reforming higher education
for those who need it most
Read my
op-ed: To Create Jobs, Promote Access to Opportunity via Human
Networks
Watch the Judiciary Committee
hearing where I asked Eric Holder to provide legal rationale for
Executive Orders
Watch my full response
to the State of the Union Address
Read the resolution I signed denouncing the President's coercion of
states into adopting Common Core standards
Learn about another proposal I introduced to protect religious
liberty
I also joined a bipartisan
group of senators to call for Congress to have a role in approving any
further U.S. military involvement in
Afghanistan
In addition to this list, there are several important issues that
we will be addressing in the near future.
I invite you to
participate in my tele-townhall, so we can continue the dialogue we have been
having on these issues as we chart a course foward.
