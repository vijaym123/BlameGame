Not Giving Up on an Authorization for Use of Military Force against ISIL
Dear Friend,
Yesterday marked 10 months since the first U.S. airstrikes were launched against ISIL. 10 months of war at an average cost of $9 million/day without authorization from Congress. Authorizing war is Congress's most solemn responsibility and it's wrong to ask so many servicemembers &ndash; more than 3,500 deployed so far &ndash; to risk their lives without having a meaningful debate or vote on the scope of this mission.
I haven&rsquo;t given up on finding a path forward. Yesterday, I joined my Republican colleague, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, in submitting the first bipartisan draft Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) for consideration in the Foreign Relations Committee. We&rsquo;re hoping it will serve as a long-overdue starting point for debate. Just as we saw with the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, it&rsquo;s possible to find bipartisan compromise on even the toughest of foreign policy issues. I challenge my colleagues to demonstrate the same courage on the issue of ISIL and finally come together to do what&rsquo;s right for our troops and our nation.
You can read our draft AUMF

Sincerely,
Senator Tim Kaine
