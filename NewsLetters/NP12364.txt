Friends,
It is an honor to represent you and your family in Congress.
WMBF News visited Washington, D.C. last week to provide you with a glimpse of the Seventh Congressional District's Office and what my team and I are doing in the Nation's Capitol to better serve you.
We made great progress d uring my first year in Congress,
and I was happy to share some highlights with WMBF News. This behind-the-scenes interview is scheduled to air
TOMORROW, February 13 at 6:00 PM.
