Dear Neighbors,
As the Olympic Games in Sochi have drawn to a close, let's not forget
another set of games that will begin there shortly - the Paralympics.
Since the first Paralympic Games in 1960, athletes with physical and
mental disabilities have come together from across the globe to
participate in sporting events such as snowboarding, sled hockey, and
para-alpine skiing. While the Paralympics symbolize how far the
disability community has come in the struggle for equality, it also
serves as a reminder that our struggle is not yet over. In many
countries, the disabled are hidden and considered an embarrassment.
They are discriminated against and unable to lead fulfilling and
productive lives despite their capacity to do so.
Even though I am no longer attending the 2014 Paralympics in Sochi due
to concerns over Russia's occupation of Ukraine, I want to wish the
best of luck to all of the athletes competing on behalf of the United
States of America.
As a member of Congress, it is my first priority to ensure the safety
of my constituents and all Americans. Unfortunately, the Russian
government has acted immorally and illegally, and I believe that there
must be consequences for its behavior. The international community must
stand together to support the sovereignty of the Ukraine and end the
suffering of its people.
The Paralympic Games are an inspiration to millions of people with
disabilities around the globe and it is tragic that the reckless
actions of the Russian government are jeopardizing them. Still, these
brave Paralympians have shown tremendous perseverance throughout their
entire lives and I know they will make all Americans proud in Sochi.
Join me in wishing our athletes the best.
Sincerely,
Tammy Duckworth
Member of Congress

Neighbors,
As
the
Olympic
Games
in
Sochi
have
drawn
to
a
close,
let&#8217;s
not
forget
another
set
of
games
that
will
begin
there
shortly
&#8211;
the
Paralympics.
Since
the
first
Paralympic
Games
in
1960,
athletes
with
physical
and
mental
disabilities
have
come
together
from
across
the
globe
to
participate

events
such
as
snowboarding,
sled
hockey,
and
para-alpine

While
the
Paralympics
symbolize
how
far
the
disability
community
has
come
in
the
struggle
for
equality,
it
also
serves
as
a
reminder
that
our
struggle
is
not
yet
over.
In
many
countries,
the
disabled
are
hidden
and
considered
an
embarrassment.
They
are
discriminated
against
and
unable
to
lead
fulfilling
and

lives
despite
their
capacity
to
do
so.
Even
though
I
am
no
longer
attending
the
2014
Paralympics
in
Sochi
due
to
concerns
over
Russia&#8217;s
occupation
of
Ukraine,
I
want
to
wish
the
best
of
luck
to
all
of
the
athletes
competing
on
behalf
of
the
United
States
of
America.
As
a
member
of
Congress,
it
is
my
first
priority
to
ensure
the
safety

my

and
all

Unfortunately,
the

I
