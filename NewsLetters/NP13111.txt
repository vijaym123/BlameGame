Dear Friend:
Most Americans will agree that Members
of Congress should spend more time talking
to each other, rather than talking at each
other. As the Tallahassee Democrat
recently
pointed
out
,more personal discussions among
Members of Congress can only help alleviate
Washington's dysfunction. As the editorial
points out, I may not always agree with a
colleague like Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA) on
policy, but we can certainly work to find
common ground in our shared interest in
helping America's most vulnerable
families.
As always, if you have any thoughts on
this or any other issue important to you,
please do not hesitate to
contact
me
. Below you will find some of the
lastest developments from the work we are
doing on the behalf of Florida's Second
Congressional District.
"Fox News Sunday" Appearance
This past weekend I appearedon
"Fox News Sunday" with Rep. Chris Van
Hollen (D-MD) to talk about the 50th
anniversary of Americas War on
Poverty and discuss the current
unemployment and poverty
challenges.

Disabled Military Pension Benefits
On Wednesday, I voted toamend the
Bipartisan Budget Agreement to restore the
full cost of living adjustments for
medically retired personnel and survivor
benefit plan recipients. This will ensure
disabled veterans and surviving families
receive the full benefits they deserve. I
will continue to work closely with House
Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff
Miller (R-FL) to ensure that all military
retirees receive their full cost of living
adjustment.
Relief for Coastal Homeowners
This week, I voted and the House
approved a provision to delay flood
insurance rate increases due to reforms in
FEMAs Flood Insurance Rate Maps.
This is a first step in providing
relief to coastal homeowners facing huge
premium increases from FEMAs
remapping.
I am committed to fighting not just for
the North and Northwest Floridians impacted
by the map changes, but also those who are
struggling to sell their homes because of
the map changes. We cannot rest until a
long-term solution is in place that eases
the burden on homeowners and ensures access
to affordable flood insurance.
Oversight Hearing: Fighting for
Forestry Communities
During a House Natural Resources
Committee hearing this week, I had
the opportunity to directly explain the
real-life impact that forestry
mismanagement and overregulation is having
on the hardworking people of Liberty County
and the surrounding area.
Its time for the federal
government to once again live up to its
commitment to our forested counties and
provide a responsible management plan that
serves our communities and ensures our
timber producers have access to a God-given
resource that belongs to the people, not
the Beltway bureaucrats.
