Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA)
February 6, 2015
Dear Friends,
Our great state of Georgia received long-awaited good news this week,
with the funding of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project in the Fiscal
Year 2016 budget. Not only did the budget request include $29.7 million
for the Savannah harbor, the budget lists the project for the first
time as an ongoing construction project in order to keep this vital
economic infrastructure project on track for future federal funding.
The Army Corps of Engineers has also indicated that it is also working
to secure an additional $21 million dedicated to the Savannah project
in the Corps' budget for this year's FY15 budget. This is a victory for
our state and will result in creating jobs and growing our state's
economy. This project has been a top priority of mine since joining the
Senate in 2005, and I am thrilled that it will finally be underway. It
is the result of bipartisan support from Georgia's local, state and
federal leaders.
More information on the Savannah Harbor Expansion project is available
here

Obamacare
On Tuesday, I co-sponsored legislation to fully repeal the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education
Reconciliation Act
collectively known as
Obamcare. The Obamacare Repeal Act, S.336, would fully repeal Obamacare
and allow Congress and the states six months to develop and vote on new
patient-centered health care reform.
Since the day that Obamacare was signed into
law, I have worked to repeal it because of its terrible consequences
for America's families and small businesses. This entire law is
fundamentally flawed and must be taken out root and branch. We need
commonsense solutions that improve the cost and quality of health care
through competition and choice, rather than imposing job-killing taxes,
mandates, and penalties on the American people.
Clay Hunt Act
This week, in a 99-0 vote, the Senate passed the Clay Hunt Suicide
Prevention for American Veterans Act.
The Clay Hunt Act was the first priority
for the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and I am pleased that the senate
acted quickly on this urgent legislation.
The bill provides for better access to
information on mental health by improving the exchange of training,
best practices and other resources among the Veterans' Affairs and
non-profit mental health organizations to enhance collaboration of
suicide prevention efforts, as well as including a new website that
offers veterans information on mental health care services. It creates
a pilot program of loan repayment for Veterans' Affairs psychiatrists.
The Clay Hunt SAV Act also creates a community outreach pilot program
to help veterans transition from active duty service and extends the
ability for certain combat veterans to enroll in the Veterans Health
Administration for one year.
Visit to VA Headquarters
I also made good on a promise this week to visit the Department of
Veterans Affairs Headquarters and to learn more about how the
department is serving our nation's veterans. Senator Richard
Blumenthal, D-Conn., along with Representatives Jeff Miller, R-Fla.,
and Corrine Brown, D-Fla., accompanied me on the visit. We were briefed
on access to care by Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald and
Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson. Additional senior Veterans Affairs
leaders provided an update on ongoing efforts to accelerate access to
care and deliver real-time, data-driven updates from staff.
We also
held a town hall meeting with VA employees that was very informative.
Balanced Budget
Congress received a proposed budget from President Obama this week that
taxes too much, spends too much and borrows too much
. Even with $2.1 trillion in new taxes, the president's
budget still does not balance. Instead, the plan increases the debt by
$8.5 trillion.
It is reckless and irresponsible to continue this unsustainable path.
That's why I am committed to working to pass legislation to curb
federal spending and to demand more accountability from programs that
receive federal dollars. This week I joined 54 of my Republican Senate
colleagues to introduce a Balanced Budget Amendment
to the Constitution in order to reign in
government spending and reduce the nation's debt. The federal
government will not stop mortgaging away our children's futures until
they are forced to do so.
The legislation requires the president to submit a balanced budget each
year, a requirement to balance the budget, an 18 percent spending cap
and a supermajority of votes for tax increases.
Homeland Security
On Wednesday, I took to the Senate floor to encourage my Congressional
colleagues to get off the sidelines, secure the border and once again
be a government of check and balances. Senate Democrats are holding up
debate on the House-passed Department of Homeland Security funding
measure this week. I told Senate Democrats that it is time to end their
filibuster and allow this measure
to be debated in the interest of national security. Unfortunately,
Democrats repeatedly prevented the Senate from beginning debate on one
of the most important issues facing our country.
It is time to hold the president accountable for his lawless executive
amnesty and to provide funding for the Department of Homeland Security
that is set to expire at the end of this month. The number-one issue
for me when we debated the Homeland Security bill in 2007, was to put
in a trigger to ensure that no changes in immigration law took place
until we first secured the border. The border is still not secure.

What's on Tap?
Next week, the Senate is expected to consider Defense Secretary Nominee
Ashton B. Carter.

Dear

Our

Georgia
received

this

with
the

of
the
Savannah

Not
only
did
the

the

time
as
an

in

The

that
it

secure
an
additional
$21

dedicated

This

and
will
result
in
creating
jobs
and
growing
our
state's
economy.
This

Since

I

of
its

Clay
Hunt
Act
This
week,
in
a
99-0

the
Senate
passed
the
Clay
Hunt
Suicide
Prevention
for
American
Veterans
Act.
The

provides
for

on

and
other

among
the

of
suicide
prevention
efforts,
as
well
as
including
a
new
website
that
offers
veterans
information
on
mental
health
care
services.
It
creates
a
pilot
program
of
loan
repayment
for
Veterans'
Affairs
psychiatrists.
The
Clay
Hunt
SAV
Act
also
creates
a
community
outreach
pilot
program
to
help
veterans
transition
from
active
duty
service
and
extends
the
ability
for
certain
combat
veterans
to
enroll
in
the
Veterans
Health
Administration
for
one
year.
Visit
to
VA
Headquarters
I
also
made
good
on
a
promise
this
week
to
visit
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
Headquarters
and
to
learn
more
about
how
the
department
is
serving
our
nation's
veterans.
Senator
Richard
Blumenthal,
D-Conn.,
along
with
Representatives
Jeff
Miller,
R-Fla.,
and
Corrine
Brown,
D-Fla.,
accompanied
me
on

We
were

on

We

Congress
received
a

President

this

that

too

Even

the

Instead,
the

increases
the

by
$8.5

It

The

a

an

Homeland
Security
On
Wednesday,
I
took
to
the
Senate
floor
to
encourage
my
Congressional
colleagues
to
get
off
the
sidelines,
secure
the
border
and
once
again
be
a
government
of
check
and

Senate
Democrats
are
holding
up
debate
on
the
House-passed
Department
of
Homeland
Security
funding
measure
this
week.
I
told
Senate
Democrats
that
it
is
time
to
end
their
filibuster
and
allow
this
measure
to
be
debated
in
the
interest
of
national
security.
Unfortunately,
Democrats
repeatedly
prevented
the
Senate
from
beginning
debate
on
one
of
the
most
important
issues
facing
our
country.
It
is
time
to
hold
the
president
accountable
for
his
lawless
executive
amnesty
and
to
provide
funding
for
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
that
is
set
to
expire
at
the
end
of
this
month.
The
number-one
issue
for
me
when
we
debated
the
Homeland
Security
bill
in
2007,
was
to
put
in
a
trigger
to
ensure
that
no
changes
in
immigration
law
took
place
until
we
first
secured
the
border.
The
border
is
still
not
secure.
