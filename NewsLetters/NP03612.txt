Dear
Friends,
This Christmas I want to thank you all for reading my
newsletters throughout the year and for your words of encouragement and
support.
I was reading some of my past newsletters and found that I
could not really express myself much better about this Christmas season
than the words I wrote last Christmas.
So I am sharing those
words again with a few updates; I hope you don't mind.
Every
year, on Christmas, we gather with friends and family to celebrate a
tradition that spans 2,000 years; inspires millions of Americans and
billions of people around the world; and brings out the greatest joys of
life
a sense of meaning, a spirit of generosity and kindness, and a
conviction we are all connected in ways that we can hardly
imagine.
This week, I will be celebrating Christmas with my wife,
Becca, our five children, and our new daughter in law.
Like so many
other families across Idaho, my family will gather around the
Christmas tree, exchange gifts, reflect on the significance on this amazing
day, and reflect on the many blessings we have enjoyed over the past
year.
As we get closer to New Years Day, we will also set goals
for the year ahead and look ahead to the future with a sense of optimism
and purpose.
As Americans, we are blessed to live in
a country that honors freedom of religion, so that every American is
able to celebrate Christmas or whichever holiday undergirds their
faith.
In fact, freedom of religion is one of the founding
principles of our country
the very first amendment to the U.S.
Constitution.
Every person
in America and throughout the world
has a basic
human right to practice their faith without fear of government
interference.
That right has been cherished throughout American
history, and we must never take it for granted.
As your
Representative, I also want to say that I am blessed to have the
opportunity to serve you in Congress.
I am humbled by the
responsibilities you have given me, and I want you to know that I work every day to
be worthy of your trust.
I look forward to representing you in
2015, working with you to defend our Constitution and honor our
spiritual heritage.
I wish you and your family a wonderful
Christmas and a wondrous holiday season.
This is truly the time
of year in which families become closer together and memories are
formed that last a lifetime.
It is my hope that you are able to enjoy
the gifts of faith, hope, and love that define this time of year.
And it is my prayer that the spirit of goodwill that we experience
during this joyous season will continue with us through the coming
year.
May you and your family have a merry Christmas and a
happy New Year!
Thank you ,
