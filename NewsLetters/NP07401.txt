Dear Friend,
It&rsquo;s been a busy summer leading up to the August district work period! The biggest news of the summer occurred this week, when the House of Representatives passed major VA reforms that will expand access to care, increase medical staff and boost accountability.
As Arizona&rsquo;s representative on the House-Senate Conference Committee working on VA reform, I fought to ensure the final agreement strengthens access to care for all veterans, in particular for Arizona&rsquo;s rural and tribal veterans who may struggle simply because of where they live.

to read my announcement of details in the agreement. You can also read this
azcentral story .
This bill&rsquo;s passage is a starting point on the VA&rsquo;s long road to recovery. We must demand innovation, discipline and follow-through of the VA leadership. Congress must provide oversight and hold the VA accountable. And all of us must never lose sight of who this historic effort is ultimately for: the men and women who sacrificed for our nation.
Below is an update on my efforts on this and other issues, along with June and July highlights from regions throughout our beautiful district. My staff and I are here to serve you, so please do not hesitate to contact us at one of our
five district offices or in D.C.
You are also welcome to
take my constituent survey
and share your priorities.
Sincerely,
Ann Kirkpatrick U.S. Representative, Arizona District One

Veterans' Issues
As the VA scandal unfolded during the spring, our nation&rsquo;s collective outrage grew. But our veterans needed more than anger. In this
op-ed in The Arizona Republic , I made it clear that action and accountability are the key to restoring veterans&rsquo; trust in the VA. And in the
Eastern Arizona Courier ,
I explained how my
VA reform bill
would help veterans in Arizona&rsquo;s rural communities.
In June, House leaders appointed me to serve on the
bipartisan House-Senate Conference Committee , which was tasked with finalizing major VA reform legislation.
And In July, one of the Phoenix VA whistleblowers testified before the
House Veterans&rsquo; Affairs Committee
about the challenges she experienced at her facility. A day later, I introduced a
whistleblower protection bill
to put a stop to the VA&rsquo;s culture of retaliation.
In June, Rep. Kirkpatrick&rsquo;s veterans outreach staffer,Palmer Miller,
attended the memorial service for
Navajo Code Talker Sidney
Bedoni.
That same month,
Chester Nez , the last of the original
Code Talkers, also passed away. Our nation is deeply grateful for
their service.
Tribal Issues
In July, Rep. Kirkpatrick was honored to attend the
Navajo
Nation Council &rsquo;s summer session in Window Rock. She is pictured above with
Councilman Jonathan Nez.
In June, leaders from the
Gila River Indian Community
visited
Rep. Kirkpatrick in Washington, D.C. to discuss the
Keep the
Promises Act,
which would prohibit the establishment of casinos
on tribal land in the Phoenix area acquired after 2013.
Coconino County
During the
Slide Fire
in late May ,
Rep. Kirkpatrick visited the
Incident Command Post in
Flagstaff
to express her support for
and thank the responders to the fire (as pictured above). The Slide
Fire and the San Juan fire are reminders that focusing on wildfire
prevention is a risk-reducing investment in Arizona&rsquo;s future and
at-risk communities. That&rsquo;s why Rep. Kirkpatrick joined colleagues
from Western states to call for a vote on the
Wildfire Disaster
Funding Act , which is a fiscally responsible investment in prevention.
This summer also marked one year since the Yarnell Hill Fire.

to read her statement on this tragic anniversary.
Rep. Kirkpatrick attended the
Civil Air Patrol
ceremony in
Flagstaff
(as shown in the photo above), honoring several members of the
organization for their dedication and outstanding work in Arizona.
Pinal County
A the
Pinal Partnership
coalition&rsquo;s June breakfast meeting, Rep.
Kirkpatrick and
Rep. Paul Gosar
(as shown in the photo above)
discussed issues facing the residents of
Pinal County , including the
proposed copper mine in
Superior,
the
Lower Santa Cruz
flood-
mitigation project, and
the ongoing VA investigations. Read more
in
this story
from inMaricopa.com.
In July, Rep. Kirkpatrick&rsquo;s veterans outreach staff joined more
than a dozen volunteers (as shown in the photo above) to help
paint the future
Eloy Veterans Center . The center will
provide essential services for the area&rsquo;s veterans.
Pima County
In July, Rep. Kirkpatrick met with our district&rsquo;s Congressional Art
Competition winner, Samantha Jones of Pusch Ridge Christian
Academy in Oro Valley. Her painting, "Tree Tranquility," now hangs
in the U.S. Capitol (top right in photo).
Gila County
In July, the House of Representatives
passed Rep. Kirkpatrick&rsquo;s bill
to honor
&ldquo;The Arizona Kid,&rdquo; the late
Staff Sergeant
Manuel Mendoza , who was born in
our district in the eastern Arizona mining
town of Miami. My bill will rename
Miami&rsquo;s U.S. Post Office after Mendoza .
Earlier this year, Mendoza posthumously
received the
Medal of Honor
for his
bravery in singlehandedly repelling an
Oct. 4, 1944, German assault on Italy&rsquo;s
Mount Battaglia.
