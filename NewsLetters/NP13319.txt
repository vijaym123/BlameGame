Dear Friends,
I wanted to share with you my decision today to co-sponsor legislation
that cuts the retirement benefits for Members of Congress and redirects
those funds to military retirement benefits.
I believe the first people we must protect are our veterans, not our
politicians. This legislation would prohibit Members of Congress who
retire before the age of 62 from receiving a cost-of-living adjustment
(COLA) increase on their pension before hitting retirement age. These
funds will help make it possible to repeal the portion of the
Ryan-Murray budget agreement that calls for a change to the COLA for
military retirement benefits.
This legislation (H.R. 3787) also calls for the Department of Defense
and the Department of Veterans Affairs to pursue joint contracts for
purchasing prescriptions, which will help offset the cost for
reinstating the full military retiree COLA.
The Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs have
previously tested joint purchasing of prescriptions to get the best
prices for their patients. In 2005, this resulted in a $660 million
savings for the VA.
This legislative solution is a recommendation from numerous hearings,
proposals and reports, but has never been implemented. It offers a way
to protect our veterans without increasing spending, reduces waste, and
stops us from kicking the can down the road.
This legislation is sponsored by Rep. James Lankford (OK-5). As passed
in the Ryan-Murray budget agreement, the COLA adjustments for military
retirees do not take effect until 2016 giving Congress more than enough
time to pass a bipartisan fix.
Sincerely,
CHRIS COLLINS
Member of Congress
Vision: The United States of America will reclaim its past glory as the
Land of Opportunity, restoring the promise of the American Dream for
our children and grandchildren.
