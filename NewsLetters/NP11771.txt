As your Representative in Congress, I value your thoughts and opinions
on the key issues affecting our country and community.
In fact, I
can't do my job properly without them.
As we move into March, my colleagues and I in the 113th Congress have
just under a year to get to work on a wide range of important matters.
I hope you will take a moment to let me know what issues you think we
should focus on in 2014.
What issue(s) represent your top priorities for 2014?
Creating jobs and expanding the middle class
Improving our health care system and the Affordable Care Act
Passing comprehensive immigration reform
Enacting meaningful legislation on gun violence prevention
Strengthening Medicare and Social Security
Addressing climate change and protecting the environment
Exploring sources of alternative energy and domestic energy
independence
Strengthening defense and national security
Reforming surveillance programs and protecting the privacy and civil
liberties of American citizens
Reducing our debt and deficit

It is my honor to represent one of the most ethnically, culturally, and
racially diverse communities in our great nation, the 47th
Congressional District of California.
I believe that communicating with you is an important element of being
an effective Representative of our community.

updating you on the latest legislation on Capitol Hill, how it affects
you and how we can respond to your inquiries and concerns.
