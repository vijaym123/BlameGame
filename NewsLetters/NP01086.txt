Congressman
Lamborn Calls for the Termination of the Amnesty Flight
Program
5/5/15
Congressman Doug Lamborn has joined 37 of his
colleagues in the House in calling on President Obama to terminate a program
designed to provide amnesty flights to illegal immigrants from Central
America. The Central American Minors Refugee/Parole Program began in
December 2014 and sends empty airplanes to Central America to bring
illegal immigrants into the United States.
The full text of our
letter calling on President Obama to end this amnesty program can be found

Background information from Congressman Paul Gosar's
(AZ-04) office
The
Obama Administration has been taking applications for an
amnesty program
since December 1, 2014 that will
fly illegal immigrants
from Central American Countries to
the U.S. for the purposes of providing an orderly alternative to the
dangerous journey that some... are currently taking to the United
States.
The Central American Minors (CAM) Refugee/Parole Program requires
parolees to pay for their flights and medical care but will provide
cash, loans, as well as help with travel and medical
assistance
to refugees participating in the program at taxpayer
expense.
Media reports further indicate
that
parolees participating in the program could include felons and immigrants
that were previously
deported.
Shockingly, DHS website states, "There is
no fee to participate in this refugee/parole program and it is
prohibited for anyone to charge a fee for completion of the form." Worse yet,
an agency official indicated in a hearing last week that some CAM
program participants are eligible because they have a family member
living in the U.S. who was one of the beneficiaries of President Obamas
previous deferred action amnesty executive
orders.
The 37 members of the
House who joined Rep. Gosar in this effort include Representatives Brian
Babin, Lou Barletta, Diane Black, Marsha Blackburn, Rod Blum, Charles
Boustany, Jim Bridenstine, Mo Brooks, Doug Collins, Mike Conaway,
Scott DesJarlais, Jeff Duncan, John Duncan, Bill Flores, Trent Franks,
Louie Gohmert, Paul Gosar, Tim Huelskamp, Lynn Jenkins, Sam Johnson,
Walter Jones, Steve King, Doug LaMalfa, Doug Lamborn, Cynthia Lummis,
Kenny Marchant, John Mica, Pete Olson, Steve Palazzo, Scott Perry, Mike
Rogers, Matt Salmon, David Schweikert, Pete Sessions, Lamar Smith, Randy
Weber and Ted
Yoho.
This effort also received the support of NumbersUSA,
Eagle Forum and the Federation for American Immigration Reform
(FAIR).
