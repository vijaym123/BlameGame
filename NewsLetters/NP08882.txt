15th District Update
Dear Neighbor,
My office is hosting a
service academy information session this Saturday
for students in grades 8th-11th who are interested in attending a service academy after graduating high school. The information session will start at 10 a.m. at the Bloomingdale Library in Valrico.
I was
honored to be named a "Taxpayer Hero"
by the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste. Floridians and all Americans deserve to keep more of their money and also deserve that their taxpayer dollars are spent wisely. Im working hard on their behalf to eliminate waste and ensure transparency.
As always, please continue to
write ,
call , and
email
your opinions to my office. I could not effectively represent you in Congress without the advice of my constituents. It is an honor and a privilege to serve you in Congress.
Your Congressman,
Dennis A. Ross
