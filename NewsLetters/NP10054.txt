Dear Friend:
I hope you and your family had an enjoyable Easter and were able to
stay safe and dry from the heavy rain that moved across North Florida.
To better represent you in Congress, I have been traveling throughout
Florida's Second Congressional District to meet directly with the
hardworking people of our district.
I am excited to share with you
some of these great events and meetings below.
Honor Flight Tallahassee
It was a privilege to participate in last weekend's Tallahassee Honor
Flight, which transports America's veterans to Washington to visit and
reflect at their memorials.
During the trip, I had the special honor
of serving as guardian for WWII veteran Mr. Robert Sutherlin, who was
visiting Washington for the first time.
Hearing the stories of service
of Mr. Sutherlin and all of the American heroes on the flight was
something that I will never forget.
Thank you to Honor Flight
Tallahassee for the invitation to be a part of such an amazing event.
Fighting for North Florida Jobs
I was proud to recently be joined by employees of Chipley's WestPoint
Home in announcing the introduction of my legislation that will sustain
jobs right here in North Florida by extending relief to an industry
that has moved predominately overseas.
Due to the expiration of a
certain free trade provision, 260 hardworking men and women are at risk
of losing their jobs at Chipley's WestPoint Home.
My legislation will
extend this vital provision to help keep these jobs and strengthen
American manufacturing.
Increasing Funding and Security for Veterans
This past week I supported House-passage of a veterans bill (H.R. 4486)
that provides $165 billion in support of our nation's heroes through
services such as mental health care, suicide prevention, and traumatic
brain injury treatment.
This legislation also demands more
accountability from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) by
withholding VA bonuses and instead directing the money towards ending
the backlog and investigating reports of secret VA waiting lists.
Maximizing Student Success
I had the pleasure of recently visiting Nims Middle School in
Tallahassee to learn more about the work Communities In Schools (CIS)
is doing to maximize student success at Nims and throughout North
Florida.
As the former chairman of the Early Learning Coalition of
Northwest Florida, I understand a quality education and bright future
begins by addressing the gap between schools and communities.
CIS has
been essential in mobilizing community resources to meet the needs of
thousands of at-risk Florida students so they can stay in school and
achieve in life.

Addressing Health Care Disparity
As the House Republicans' Anti-Poverty Initiative Chairman, I was proud
to co-host a minority health forum on health care disparity with former
Rep. J.C. Watts and a panel of private and public sector leaders.
Our
discussions focused on real solutions that ensure greater access to
quality health care and empower vulnerable families, not the federal
government.
Sincerely,
Steve Southerland, II
