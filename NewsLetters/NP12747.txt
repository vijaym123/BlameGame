Dear Friend,
Yesterday the President delivered his State of the Union, and it was
clear just how out of touch he is.
While the President hardly talked about our national security, his
praise of the Iranian nuclear deal is extremely concerning. Any deal
that doesn't completely dismantle Iran's nuclear program is dangerous
and not in our national security interest. Although the President
claims his goal is to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran, his agreement
allows a nuclear weapon to stay within the Iranian regime's reach.
If President Obama was serious about our security and the security of
our allies, he would have required that Iran fully dismantle their
nuclear program - but he didn't. The President has instead chosen to
rely solely on the unreliable word of the world's leading state sponsor
of terrorism.
By threatening to veto new legislation to keep Iran from getting
nuclear weapons, the President once again showed his unwillingness to
work with Congress. Other nations used to look to the U.S. for global
leadership, but what they saw last night was a fundamental shift in our
foreign policy - retreat instead of leadership.
Sincerely,
George Holding

Dear
Friend,
Yesterday
the
President
delivered
his
State
of
the

and
it
was
clear
just
how
out
of
touch
he
is.
While
the
President

his
praise
of

is
extremely
concerning.
Any
deal
that
doesn't

Although
the

nuclear-armed
Iran,
his
agreement
allows
a

to
stay

the
Iranian
regime's
reach.
If
President
Obama

and
the

of
our

he
