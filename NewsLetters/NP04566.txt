28th
District
Dear
Friends:
Each year, I have the opportunity to submit a number of United
States Service Academy nominations from the
28 th
Congressional District.
All nominations from this district are strictly
merit-based.
My nominations will be made upon consideration of
high school records, leadership, community involvement, letters of
recommendation, SAT or ACT scores and an interview with my Service Academy
Advisory Committee.
Rep. Schiff along
with Rep. Tony Cardenas hosted a Service Academy Night earlier
this year for students interested in applying to service
academies.
To be considered for a
nomination to one of the academies, applicants need to be at least 17
years old, but no older than 23 years of age, be unmarried and have

addition to the application form, the nomination packet must include the
following information:

school or college transcript
Two letters of
recommendation, at least one of which must be from the students high school
principal, counselor or teacher
SAT or ACT scores (use SAT
code 4163 to send the scores directly to us)
A one-page
essay explaining why the student would like to attend a U. S. service
academy
A list of extracurricular activities,
achievements, and any employment.
All applicants must
be a U.S. citizen and reside in the
28 th
