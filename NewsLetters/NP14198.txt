Rep. Chuck Fleischmann Speaks in Favor of the Keep Your Health Plan Act
Click here to watch.
President Obama and his administration repeatedly promised that the
American people would be able to keep their health insurance plans
under Obamacare, despite knowing for years that this promise could not
be kept. I worked with my House colleagues to pass a bipartisan bill
that gives the President a chance to help the very Americans affected
by this broken promise.
Last Friday the House of Representative passed the Keep Your Health
Plan Act. So far, 3.5 million people have lost their healthcare thanks
to Obamacare, and 10 million Americans are expected to lose their plans
by the end of the year. This legislation would allow the President to
keep his promise, so that the American people can keep their health
insurance policies through 2014.
While all of Obamacare needs to be repealed, I was proud to cosponsor
the Keep Your Health Plan Act because I believe the American people
shouldn't have to bear the negative consequences of a law that was
passed under false pretenses. You can be certain that I will continue
to fight for full repeal and replacement of Obamacare.
Sincerely,
Chuck

President
