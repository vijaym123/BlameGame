After pressure from Senator Casey, Administration Halts Use of Questionable Evidence that Denied Help to Miners
&ldquo;The U.S. Department of Labor has ordered officials handling black lung claims from mine workers to stop relying on the medical opinions of a leading Johns Hopkins doctor whose work for coal companies helped lead to benefits being denied to thousands of miners over the last two decades. The Labor Department&#39;s senior attorney told ABC News the agency is now preparing to notify every miner whose benefits were denied based in part on the doctor&#39;s X-ray readings that they should consider reapplying for those benefits&hellip; &lsquo;This sends a signal that the Department of Labor hasn&#39;t sent in a long time,&rsquo; said Sen.

Casey Introduces Bill That Would Set Standards for Reporting of Suspected Child Abuse to State Authorities
&ldquo;Teachers, coaches, clergy and other adults who have a responsibility to children should be required to report cases of suspected abuse to police or local child protective agencies, U.S. Sen.

The Pennsylvania Democrat&#39;s bill follows the Penn State child sexual abuse scandal in which former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky was convicted in 2012 of molesting several boys and was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison. Under the bill, states must require that adults with a professional responsibility to children &mdash; teachers, coaches, clergy and day care providers, among others &mdash; make the reports to authorities.&rdquo; ( Associated Press , 5/15/14)
