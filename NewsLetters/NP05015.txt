We&rsquo;re running out of time -- so we'll get straight to the point. A brand new poll shows us trailing Republican Bob Dold by 2 points.
And as you read this, FOUR different outside groups are pounding the Chicago airwaves to help Dold squeak out a win. If we get outspent now -- with just 11 days to go -- the damage could be irreversible.
We just checked: we need 174 more donations by 6:30 PM Central to stay on track and respond to Boehner&rsquo;s attacks. So David, if you were planning to chip in for Brad&rsquo;s progressive campaign, it&rsquo;s critical you do so immediately.
David Johnson DEADLINE:
