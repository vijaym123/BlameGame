Dear Friend &ndash;
Representing Orange County in D.C. and working for you back home is truly an honor and a privilege.
In 2013, my office hosted six college financial aid workshops, my 10 th
annual Veterans&rsquo; Resource Fair and countless town halls, tele-town halls and registration events for the Affordable Care Act. I had the opportunity to visit over 40 local schools and businesses, providing information on government resources and learning about their needs and concerns. With my support, local educational and non-profit organizations earned over $3.1 million in grant funding this year. My office also helped over 320 residents resolve issues with the federal government including veteran benefits, social security and housing.
In D.C., I was the lead Democrat on 10 bills and co-signed 120 other bills and resolutions. I introduced bills to combat sexual assaults in the military, encourage STEM education, reform our high-skilled visa program, implement better ways to strengthen our borders and fund programs that will keep our country safe. I fought for Orange County pension reform as well as common sense immigration reform, equal pay and human rights in Vietnam. I also held expert briefings on topics ranging from incorporating women in combat roles to tax reform policies for small and medium businesses.
We have so much more to do in 2014, and I&rsquo;m excited for what we can accomplish together.
If you&rsquo;d like to share your opinions or ideas for 2014, I&rsquo;d love for you to
email me . As always, I encourage you to contact one of my offices if you have questions or need assistance.
Very truly yours,
Loretta Sanchez
Member of Congress
