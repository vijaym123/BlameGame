Rep. Bob Goodlatte
Combating Human Trafficking
Many Americans don&rsquo;t
think of human trafficking as a problem in our country. The sale of children for sex sounds like something that could only happen in faraway places,
but tragically it is happening right here in the United States
every single day . Virginia is no exception. According to the FBI, sex
trafficking is the fastest-growing business of organized crime and the third-largest criminal enterprise in the world. Sadly, this immoral and
criminal industry is also a profitable one. It&rsquo;s estimated that child sex trafficking in the United States alone is a $9.8 billion industry.
Together
as a nation we must send the strong message that our children are not for sale. In an effort to help end this horrific crime, the House of
Representatives passed a series of bipartisan bills this week aimed at updating our laws to combat human trafficking. Four of these bills were
previously passed out of the House Judiciary Committee, including the
Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act
and the
Human Trafficking
Prevention, Intervention, and Recovery Act .
Read more in
my weekly column
on the bipartisan bills passed by the House. They are far too important to be delayed, and I urge the Senate to take them up as
soon as possible. As a parent, I know that there is no duty more important than protecting our children.
Service Academy Nominations Announced
It's my honor to nominate several young men and
women to compete for an appointment to our nation&rsquo;s service academies as members of the graduating Class of 2019. Folks in the Sixth District
can be proud of these hardworking nominees. Upon appointment, I am confident that they will serve the United States with distinction. I wish them the
best and thank them for their willingness to serve our great nation.

Recognizing Law Enforcement
Officers
This
week, I joined in a special order on the House Floor to express my respect and deep gratitude for the thousands of law enforcement officers across the
country who serve our communities and the American people daily.
