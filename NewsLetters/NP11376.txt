Constituent Services for Veterans, Military Service Members and Their
Families
Dear Friend,
As your voice in Congress, I am committed to ensuring that our nation's
veterans have the medical, educational and career benefits they
undeniably deserve. Over the past nine years, my office has
successfully assisted more than 1,800 constituents in Philadelphia and
Montgomery County with matters related to U.S. Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA) benefits and services. My district offices in Northeast
Philadelphia and Abington are available to provide assistance to
veterans, service members and their families with a range of issues,
including:
*	Official copies of separation documents or military records.
*	Replacement of medals.
*	Assistance with VA hospital and clinic issues.
*	Assistance with claims for compensation or pensions from the VA.
*	Information on GI bill benefits.
*	Resources on education, employment, training and business
opportunities for veterans.
In addition, an accredited Veterans Service Officer works in my
Philadelphia district office one day a week to assist veterans and
their dependents in filing claims with the VA.
We must keep our promises to our nation's more than 2 million troops
and reservists, their families and more than 21 million veterans,
including 40,000 here in Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District.
That is why I was proud to lead more than 100 U.S. Representatives last
month in successfully urging President Obama to rule out cutting
veterans' benefits and Social Security in his latest budget proposal.
Please visit my website
and Facebook page
for how I can best serve you, and be sure
to call or stop by my offices in Philadelphia (215-335-3355) or
Abington (215-517-6572) if you have questions or concerns.
Sincerely,
Allyson Y. Schwartz
Member of Congress

Dear

As

I

nine
years,
my
office
has
successfully
assisted
more
than
1,800
constituents
in
Philadelphia
and
Montgomery
County
with
matters
related
to
U.S.
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
benefits
and
services.
My
district
offices
in
Northeast
Philadelphia
and
Abington
are
available
to
provide
assistance
to
veterans,
service
members
and

We
