Dear Friend,
The 114th Congress is only four weeks old
and already the most vulnerable among us have come under Republican
attack. Last week,
I rose in opposition to yet another
right wing effort to deter women from enrolling in health care plans
that cover abortion .
Despite our disagreements, I
havent given up hope on pursuing bipartisan solutions to some of the
most pressing issues facing Americans today.
Thats
why I worked with my Republican colleague Congressman Erik Paulsen to
introduce "Safe Harbor" legislation to protect victims of sex
trafficking.
Im pleased to report that our bill passed the House on
January 27.
Below, you will find stories on what I have
been up to this month as I continue my fight to protect the rights and
safety of those who are most in need. Have a safe and happy Super Bowl
XLIX weekend!

Moore
Named Top Democrat on Monetary Policy and Trade
Subcommittee
I was honored to be selected
by my colleagues to

Subcommittee.
Tribute to the Victims of the
Paris Attack
During the President's State of the Union,
I recruited dozens of my fellow colleagues to join me in holding
up a yellow pencil in tribute to the victims of the terrorist attack in
Paris.
Opposition to Radical Attacks on Reproductive Health
Care
Despite my efforts to stop them , Republicans once
again tried to limit a woman's ability to make their own health care
choices with the passage of the No Taxpayer Funding of Abortion
Act.
SUPER BOWL SUNDAY
Dont forget that Super Bowl Sunday is this weekend! While I,
along with the entire nation, mourned the loss of the Green Bay
Packers in the NFC Championship, we can all still enjoy whats sure to be a
great game.
But did you know that Super Bowl Sunday is
also the second largest food consumption day of the year, second only to
Thanksgiving? And because Super Bowl food is largely communal foods or
buffet style dishes, the chance for foodborne illness is greatly
increased. No one wants to ruin a great night with a case of food
poisoning, so
the US Department of Agriculture has put
together some helpful information to keep you healthy and
happy.
Enjoy the game!
