Dear Friends,
I was encouraged by the outpouring of responses to
the 2014 Constituent Survey and to hear what issues you are concerned
about this year. I am
your
representative in Congress, and
hearing from you helps inform my decisions as I represent you and your
interests in Washington.
In addition to answering the multiple choice questions, some of you
expressed your views in writing on a variety of
topics:
As a
truck driver I think the EPA and FMCSA have too much power. They just
keep writing laws for little or no reason.
As seniors on a very
fixed income we are suffering from the increase in property taxes, rise
in food and healthcare costs and little or no cost of living increase
in Social Security. We are sick and tired of the government taxing
anything and everything we need and/or use, thus eating up our retirement
savings and making it impossible to enjoy the years we have
left.
Cut government spending. The government must stop borrowing money
and only spend the tax revenuethere is so much wasteful government
spending and no one is accountable.
I have recently graduated
college and my wife and I are financially stable enough to purchase a home.
However crushing student debt has severely affected [me] as well as
others in my generation.
Please reverse the Affordable [Care] Act.
It is destroying the economy and taking good healthcare from far more
people than it is helping!
Comments like these and the surveys final results demonstrate
the diversity of needs and concerns in the 14 th
District, and I will be working hard to make sure
they are addressed this next year.

website.
Thank you for your patience as
we worked to resolve the technical difficulties involved with the
survey. As always, please contact me via my
website
or by phone at 630-232-7104 or 202-225-2976 with your concerns,
questions and opinions. I work for you.
House App Contest
The first-ever House App Contest for high school
students is underway!
For a
nation with a strong history of innovation, I believe we need to do all
we can to spark students interest in Science, Technology,
Engineering and Math (STEM) fields. This competition allows students to compete
by creating and exhibiting their software application, or app, for
mobile, tablet or computer devices on a platform of their
choice.
Students can submit their
apps source code online from now until 11:59 p.m. EDT on April
30th, and must also provide a YouTube or VIMEO video demo explaining
their app and what they learned through this competition process.
The winning students app in each participating congressional district,
including the 14th District, will be featured on the House of
Representatives website ( www.House.gov ), as well as on
display in a U.S. Capitol exhibit.
Additional details are available at

and on my website at
