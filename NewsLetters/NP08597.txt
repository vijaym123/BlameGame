Cutting Red Tape for Trail Volunteers
Dear Friends,
I dont know if you have tried hiking on part of the 158,000 miles of public trails we have in this country, but three quarters of our trails are not up to standards and two thirds receive no maintenance at all.
That is why I joined Rep. Tim Walz (D-MN) this week to introduce
H.R.4886:
the National Forest System Trails Stewardship Act of 2014.
Our country is in massive debt and the cost for trail maintenance is exorbitant. But our bill focuses on using resources already in place and studying ways to improve our trails by utilizing firefighters during their off season and allowing outfitters to pay for part of their fees in kind by working on trails.
Public lands access is very important to Wyoming and the entire country and this is one way we can open up our lands without driving the nation further into debt.
Please, let me know your
thoughts and concerns
as we work to make greater ease of access to public lands.
Sincerely,
Join the conversation! Stay connected to me through

and
I look forward to hearing from you soon!
