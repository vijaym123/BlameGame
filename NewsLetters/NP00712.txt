Unemployment vs. Workforce Training
Workers shouldn't have to choose between the two. Currently,
unemployed workers who seek training through programs at universities, community colleges and other technical schools risk losing their unemployment insurance benefits if the program is not specifically approved by the Workforce Investment Act.
We need to provide incentives for workers to get the training they need to re-enter the workforce.
Last week, I announced at Richland Community College (pictured above) the reintroduction of a bill to make it so unemployed workers don't have to choose between an unemployment check to help pay the bills or training that could lead to a full-time job.
H.R. 2219, the Opportunity KNOCKS Act, broadens the definition of approved training and makes certain that workers who are seeking an industry recognized certificate, an apprenticeship or an associate or baccalaureate degree will not be at risk of losing their unemployment benefits.

It's On Us
Recently, I travelled with Vice President Joe Biden (pictured above) to the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana campus to highlight the Its On Us campaign to prevent sexual assault on college campuses. The University of Illinois is the leader among colleges in the number of students who have taken the pledge to stop sexual assault.
As a parent of a daughter who will be heading off to college in the fall, I was honored to attend this rally to stop sexual assault on college campuses. Students have a right to feel safe on their college campus so its on us
all of us
to help ensure your safety. Its on us, as policy makers, to make sure universities have the tools they need to prevent sexual assault crimes and help victims if an incident does occur. Its on university faculty members and leaders to implement and follow proper procedures to ensure the safety of their students. And its on students to look out for one another
if you see something, say something.
It's on all of us.

Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act
Last week, I ask you if you thought Congress should have to review any nuclear deal reached with Iran - 63% of people who responded believe Congress should.
I agree.
This week the House passed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, which would require Congress to review any final nuclear agreement between Iran and the U.S.
I continue to have grave concerns about the current framework negotiated by this administration. Here's why I supported this bill and what it does:
My constituents deserve to know what is in a nuclear deal negotiated with Iran and be able to trust that any final agreement will effectively stop Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, said Davis. Unfortunately, I fear the concessions made by the president in the current framework are too great and safeguards to hold Iran accountable for their end of the deal are insufficient. We have a responsibility to the American people to ensure this deal does not end up strengthening the nuclear program of the worlds largest state-sponsor of terrorism.

Should the EPA be regulating the water in the ditch outside your house?
I don't think they should.
This week I voted for H.R. 1732, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act, which requires the EPA to withdraw their current proposed rule to expand waters of the United States which give the EPA the ability to regulate any water that flows or accumulates including water in farm ponds, meadows, and ditches.
By blocking this proposed rule today, we are giving the EPA the opportunity to engage with stakeholders to produce a more common-sense approach to regulating our waterways.
