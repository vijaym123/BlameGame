Dear
Friend,
The news from Israel this week is very sad. I know that for all
sorts of reasons, Israel's security is important to folks in the 9th
District of Georgia.
As our friends in Israel continue the
fight against terrorism, I wanted to update you on my legislation to
ensure Israel's ability to protect itself.
If you
didn't hear, earlier in this Congress
I introduced H.R. 1992 , the Israel Qualitative
Military Edge (QME) Enhancement Act.
My bill addresses the fact that
the in the 21st century, it's not the quantity of arms a nation has,
but the quality of its military that makes the difference in its
ability to truly defend itself.
My
Israel QME bill
promotes transparency and
accountability in the United States' support of our most important ally
in the Middle East.
It's passed the House, and I'm confident that
this principle will become law as the American people continue to
demand support for the nation of Israel.
As always, please
let me know
your
thoughts.
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of
Congress
