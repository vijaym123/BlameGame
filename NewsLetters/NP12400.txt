DISTRICT
Dear
Friend,
Every four years, the international community gathers to represent
their respective countries as they compete for Olympic gold. The 2014
Winter Olympic Games are underway in Sochi, Russia and this year,
Massachusetts is sending 10 athletes to the games.
The Third
District, which I represent, is proud to have Annalisa Drew, of
Andover, as a member of the US Olympic Freeskiing team! Annalisa will be
competing in the ladys ski half pipe event on February
20.
The Olympics are an opportunity for countries all over the world to
unite and celebrate the mental strength and physical endurance of
world-class athletes. It truly is a unique experience guided by the
principle that when we work together, great things can
happen.
Regardless of the number of medals our athletes bring home, I look
forward to cheering on the members of Team USA as they pursue their
Olympic dreams and represent all that is great about America on an
international stage.
Join me in wishing good luck to Team USA and
if you would like to learn more about
the athletes with Massachusetts ties, go to my
website .
Please be sure to scroll down to read more information on some of
the other topics on which I have been working.
As
always, I hope that you continue to provide me with your thoughts, feedback,
and opinions on these or any other subjects via my
website
or on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Niki

REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INITIATIVE, A
MODEL FOR THE NATION
In 2005, Massachusetts
joined eight other states in New England in a cooperative effort to reduce
carbon pollution from power plants. This program, known as the
Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), has initiated a 40 percent
decrease in carbon dioxide emissions.
Because of the
success of RGGI, I recently wrote a letter with Congresswoman Annie Kuster
(NH-02) urging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to look to
our program as they prepare emission standards for new power plants to
reduce carbon pollution. RGGI has proven that by setting standards to
decrease greenhouse gas emissions, we can drive economic development,
improve public health, and protect our environment.

DEBT LIMIT
The
U.S. House of Representative passed legislation this week to raise the
nations debt limit. I voted in favor of this measure because it
ensures that our government can fulfill its obligations and prevent the
first ever default on our debt.
With our countrys economic
future in mind and at the urging of House Democrats, this legislation
did not include any unrelated, partisan provisions. Though there is
much work to be done to lower our nations deficit, the passing of this
bill is a step towards protecting our economy.

MILITARY SPOUSE JD NETWORKS HOMEFRONT
RISING
On Tuesday, February 11, I was honored to speak at the Military
Spouse JD Networks
Homefront Rising
event in Washington, D.C.
Homefront Rising
is an opportunity for military spouses to
network with each other and with leaders in public service to learn more
about getting involved in public service.
This event
allowed me to thank military families for their sacrifice and support,
and also to discuss ways they can further get involved. Military spouses
bring unique insight and experiences to important issues, and would
bring a unique perspective to public service.
