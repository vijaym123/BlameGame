Congratulations to the newest member of the Commonwealth Judiciary, Superior Court Associate Judge Teresa Kim-Tenorio. Her investiture at the Guma Justicia this week was well-attended by the rest of the Judiciary, elected officials, members of the Northern Mariana Islands Korean community, and by her proud family, including husband Perry Tenorio and their children Pedro and Sunjoon Perry. Sons Justis and Sunho are currently serving our country in the U.S. Air Force and Army, respectively. My best wishes to Judge Kim-Tenorio. It is always a thrill to see the new generation assuming responsibility for the well-being of our community.
Jewell action needed to convey mineral rights to NMI
In addition to transferring ownership of submerged lands in the Northern Mariana Islands from the federal government to the Commonwealth, Public Law 113-34 , which the President signed in September, also requires a transfer of oil, gas, and other mineral rights. The original Territorial Submerged Lands Act of 1974 , which P.L. 113-34 amended to include the NMI, kept these rights in federal hands. But Congressmen Philip Burton, George Miller, and Nick Rahall added a requirement in 1980 that the Secretary of the Interior turn over the mineral rights to each territory. I made a formal request last week to Interior Secretary Sally Jewell
that she now take that action. I also asked for an accounting of any existing leases or permits that the federal government may have issued in the submerged lands now owned by the Commonwealth. I am not aware of any, but if there are leases, then Interior is also required by law to transmit the revenues to the Commonwealth going forward.

Oleai Elementary School 4th and 5th grade students quizzed me this week about the work I do in Congress, representing their interests and all of the people of the Northern Mariana Islands. They asked great questions. I make a point of going to a school every time I am home. It helps me so much in my work on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce to be able to share with other Members of Congress what I have seen and learned while visiting classrooms in my district. To schedule a visit to your class, contact your local congressional office
on Rota: 532-2647, on Tinian: 433-2647, and on Saipan: 323-2647/8. Go Turtles!
$464,556 grant awarded for transportation services to help Ayuda Network
The USDAs Rural Business Enterprise Grants program has awarded $464,556 to the Community Transportation Association of America, Inc., to develop and establish transportation systems in the Northern Mariana Islands, Iowa, Nebraska, and North Carolina.
