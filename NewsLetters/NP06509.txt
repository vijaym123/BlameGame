David -- Brad&rsquo;s
proud
to be a Democrat.
So when you see ads attacking his record, just remember:
--Brad&rsquo;s fighting to protect a woman&rsquo;s right to choose
--Brad&rsquo;s fighting to raise the wage for Illinois workers
--Brad&rsquo;s fighting to ensure marriage equality across America
Brad's the only person in this race with the right priorities, period. So David, if you believe in Brad -- if you believe in our shared vision -- we need you to step up today.
Will you pitch in to help spread Brad&rsquo;s progressive message?
