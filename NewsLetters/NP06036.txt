Hatch Dispatch: An
Important Legislative Milestone
Dear Friend:
Today marks the 30
th
Anniversary of President Ronald
Reagan signing into law the Drug Price
Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act,
otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman generic drug
legislation. I am proud of my work on this
landmark legislation that has cut health care
costs, spurred innovation, and created jobs
and wanted to share my reflections with
you.
When President Reagan signed Hatch-Waxman into
law, he said it provided regulatory
relief, increased competition, economy on
government, and best of all, the American people
will save money, and yet receive the best
medicine that pharmaceutical science can
provide. The past 30 years have
proven President Reagan's statement to be
true. Congressman Waxman and I saw an
opportunity to improve health care for all
Americans and save taxpayers hard earned
money, and the progress weve made the past
30 years has been tremendous.
Because of the Hatch-Waxman law, American
patients access to medical treatments has
increased and the American health care system has
saved trillions of dollars. The law also ensured
innovators would continue to develop new
medicines. By creating a period of
exclusivity for the innovators of new drugs, the
law established incentives for companies to bring
new products to the market, meaning that patients
will have access to groundbreaking treatments to
improve care. The law has benefitted
patients and helped grow our economy and create
jobs.
Hatch-Waxman is a great example of two very
different Members of Congress working together to
address a critical need and advance the common
good. Im proud to have my name associated
with this landmark legislation and hope to build
upon the past 30 years of the laws
success.
Sincerely,
Orrin Hatch
P. S. You may be interested in reading a
report
released by the Generic Pharmaceutical
Association (GPhA) , discussing
this industry and its impact. Of particular
note is that 86 percent of all prescription
medicines dispensed in the United States today
are generic. The IMS Institute for Healthcare
Informatics found that from 2004 through 2013,
generic drug use saved the U.S. health care
system $1.5 trillion.
