Wicker: Health-Care
Premiums on the
Rise Despite Obama's
Promises
Preliminary Estimates for Next Year Show
Double-Digit Increases
in Some States
Last
year, Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) warned that the implementation of
President Obama's health-care law would be a "train wreck."
He was
right.
The cost and confusion continue to mount as Americans face
greater financial burdens and fewer health-care choices.
Instead
of lower premiums, which the President promised would drop by $2,500
on average, families and individuals are spending more of their
hard-earned dollars on health-care coverage.
The sticker shock will only worsen.
In recent
weeks, several states have announced preliminary estimates for next year's
premiums.
The
Wall Street Journal
reports that many of
these states' largest health insurers plan to increase premiums
between 8.5 percent and 22.8 percent.
For many Americans, this means
either paying more or losing coverage completely.
Although the
Obama Administration has tried to downplay costs, the increases are yet
another example of the health-care laws failure to live up to its
advertising.
Lack of
Competition
States with low enrollment among young adults
and with few insurers in their exchanges are particularly vulnerable to
higher premiums next year.
In Mississippi, where 94 percent of
enrollees are eligible for federal subsidies, there is little
competition to drive down rates.
According to this year's numbers, our
state already has the third-highest premiums in the country.
Competition cannot flourish when the
government is involved in setting mandates for benefits and
controlling rates.
Without market-based reforms, consumers lose out on
choice and cost.
Bipartisan
Reform
One important reform to the President's health-care
law could involve the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program.
The program penalizes hospitals based on readmission rates, unfairly
targeting many Mississippi hospitals that provide high-quality care to
low-income populations.
Often these patients cannot afford
outside care or do not have access to
it.
A bipartisan bill I have introduced with Sens. Joe Manchin
(D-W.Va.), Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), and Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) would change the way
the government determines readmission penalties.
Under our
proposal, hospitals serving vulnerable populations would be given more
flexibility.
This would reform the law's one-size-fits-all approach
to reflect the needs of patients and the care offered by
providers.
Impact on
Women
One part of the Obamacare law was recently overturned by the Supreme
Court, which ruled that closely-held, family-owned businesses should
not be forced by the federal government to pay for emergency
contraceptives if it violates their religious beliefs.
I applauded this
decision because I do not believe the government has the right to make
Americans violate their religious convictions.
The court ruling
was based on a statute protecting religious liberty and has little to do
with a woman's access to contraception.
In truth, it is the Obamacare law itself that is
causing disproportionate harm to American women.
For example,
women are more likely to pay higher out-of-pocket costs under plans
with high deductibles because they typically visit the doctor more.
As 57 percent of the part-time workforce, they are also more likely
to have their hours cut because of the employer mandate.
Additionally, the law's limited physician networks have forced many women to
choose different specialists and doctors for their children.
Women make
approximately 80 percent of health-care decisions in their family.
More
choices and lower costs are important to giving them the flexibility they
need to choose the right health-care plan.
Obamacare has made
these decisions more difficult.
Congress must pursue
patient-centered policies that produce truly affordable and accessible health care.
