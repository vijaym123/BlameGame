Georgia Rep. Paul Broun's statement on Enforce the Law Act
March 12, 2014
U.S. Rep.
Paul Broun
(R-Ga-10) released a
statement
on Wednesday after voting in favor of the
Enforce the Law Act, or H.R. 4138 , legislation allowing each chamber of Congress to file a civil action in a federal district court to clarify a federal law to ensure that the U.S. President "faithfully executes the laws of the United States."
"President Obama has made it clear that he has no intention of working with Congress - instead he has a 'pen and a phone' which he will use to advance his own political agenda, Constitutional or not," said Rep. Broun. "The Constitution requires that the President 'take care that the laws be faithfully executed.' Unfortunately, we've seen the President ignoring rather than enforcing laws, arbitrarily and repeatedly changing laws, and using regulatory power to make law. It's time the President starts adhering to the Constitution as intended by our Founding Fathers, not picking and choosing which laws he wants to enforce for political expediency.

Broun Votes to Stop Presidential Overreach
" It's time the President starts adhering to the Constitution as intended by our Founding Fathers, not picking and choosing which laws he wants to enforce for political expediency. He has already made changes to Obamacare and suspended parts of our immigration laws - there's no telling what could be next."
Broun: Not Another Obamacare Fix
"Once again, we see leadership attempting to fix a disastrous law that simply cannot be fixed. Obamacare is broken beyond the point of repair
and the only true fix is a swift, full, repeal."
Broun Announces 2014 Congressional Art Competition
Every year, Congress hosts a nationwide competition to encourage the artistic talents of our youth, said Congressman Broun. And each year, I look forward to seeing the wonderful artistic talent of the students in Georgias 10th Congressional District. I encourage every young person who finds joy in art to submit a piece.
