Hello!
I want to let you know about a VERY important
deadline.
March 31st is the last day to sign up for health care
under the Affordable Care Act before the Open Enrollment period for
2014 ends and penalties for not signing up
begin.
The Affordable Care Act is making health insurance coverage more
affordable and accessible for millions of Americans.
Two weeks
ago, it was announced that more than a million Californians have
enrolled through our state exchange, Covered California ( www.coveredca.com ).
CoveredCA also continues to be a great option for those who
need help signing up for coverage online or over the phone. Their
Find Help Near You
tool can also help
you find an enrollment center with representatives who will walk you
through the application process.
Since the
start of the year, our office has held dozens of FREE workshops
across our Congressional District to help the community register for health
care. I also have a website to answer your basic questions on the
Affordable Care Act:
http://cardenas.house.gov/media-center/articles/enroll-the-valley .
This page provides the
latest information regarding what plan you, your family or your small
business qualify for, as well as a price
estimate.
This week we have our final two workshops.
We
need your help promoting these
workshops.
Thursday, March 27th, 4:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m., Bert
Corona Charter, 9400 Remick Ave, Arleta, CA
91331
Saturday, March 29th, 11:00 a.m. - 1:00 p.m.,
Delano Rec. Center, 15100 Erwin St., Van Nuys, CA
91401
PLEASE forward this email to all your
friends in the Valley. Invite them to sign up for my newsletter (link
below) and let them know how important it is to sign up for affordable,
quality health insurance. Please feel free to call our office at
(818) 504-0090 if you have any questions.
The Affordable Care Act
will significantly benefit families in the Valley.
We really
need your help in spreading the word to the community about this
weeks workshops.
Thank
you,
P.S.
