Dear Friends,
In Tuesday night's State of the Union address, President Obama
discussed the great strides forward we've made in moving our country
out of the Great Recession and into a period of economic recovery and
growth. For 58 straight months now, private sector employment has
created more than 11 million jobs and, for the past 12 months, that
growth has been coupled by the smallest budget deficit since 2007.
These numbers are encouraging, but the president rightly recognized
that
more work
remains to ensure that all Americans enjoy the fruits of our stronger
economy. Too many of our neighbors are still unemployed, underemployed
or underpaid and I agree with the president that we must do more to
tackle these challenges.
President Obama presented a lot of good ideas on how to do that, and I
strongly believe there is room for bipartisan compromise on many of
them. To watch my full reaction to the president's speech, please visit

I look forward to working with President Obama and my colleagues in
Congress on both sides of the aisle over the coming year. I agree with
the president's assessment that the state of our union is much stronger
than it was six years ago, but we must stay focused on the work that
still lies before us. We have a ripe opportunity to work together to
make real progress on our most critical priorities and it is my sincere
hope that we seize this opportunity.
Sincerely,
