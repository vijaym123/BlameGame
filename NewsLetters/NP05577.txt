The 2014 Election is historic...
On one side, is us -- Democrats. And the largest online grassroots movement in the country:
* Your grassroots support isn&rsquo;t just historic -- it&rsquo;s unprecedented for a midterm election
On the other side, is Republicans&hellip;and a network of shady, secret money unlike anything before:
* Republicans&rsquo; secret money is also unprecedented for a midterm election
David
This is Barack Obama&rsquo;s

It&rsquo;s really up to you -- and all of us -- to decide.
