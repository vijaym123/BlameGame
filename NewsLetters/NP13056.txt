As we begin a
new year, I wanted to bring to your attention the work I am doing to
protect your right to
privacy.
I recently spoke on the House floor about the need for Congress to
enact policies that better protect Americans private information,
particularly in light of recently reported
security
risks
found in the Obamacare exchange website, healthcare.gov. Click

During a recent Homeland
Security Oversight Committee hearing, we learned just how deeply flawed
the Obamacare website was upon its launch.
Reports
show that security risks to the Obamacare website were limitless
long before the websites official launchand the Obama administration
knew of these risks before the websites
launch.
As someone who has worked in the technology sector,
I know that if a private company launched a website with these kind
of issues, the company would have gone under and people would have been
fired. I strongly believe that this Administrations failure to
secure this website in advance of its launch is wholly
unacceptable.
Thats why Im proud to support the
Health Exchange Security and Transparency
Act , which requires the government to notify individuals if and when
personal information is stolen or unlawfully accessed through the
healthcare.gov
website.
Whether you support or oppose the Affordable Care Act and its mandates,
most Montanans can agree that launching a website with these security
risks was irresponsible and put millions of peoples' personal information
at risk. Requiring the government to inform individuals if their
personal information was jeopardized by using this website is common
sense, and this bill is a critical step in the right
direction.
As your voice in Washington, it is
not only my priority but also my job to represent you. In order to
better serve you, please take the time to answer the question
below.
Should the Obama administration be
required to promptly notify individuals if and when their personal
information is jeopardized through the healthcare exchange
website? Yes - Americans deserve to
know if their personal information was put at risk No - The Health Exchange Security and
Transparency Act is unnecessary
