News from Congressman Scott Peters
December 19, 2013
Dear Friend,
The House of Representatives ended its 2013 session last Thursday, on
pace to be the least productive Congress since historians started
keeping tracking. As much as I love being in San Diego, it's ridiculous
that the House adjourned three weeks before the end of the year with so
many critical problems left unresolved.
The Budget Agreement
I am encouraged by the recent budget deal and hope it signals a
reduction in the hyper-partisan, crisis-to-crisis mentality that has
become the norm in Washington. For the first time in a long time, the
freshman class has brought a problem-solving attitude to D.C. that our
constituents expect and deserve.
The budget deal, the first to pass Congress in four years, is far from
perfect but it dramatically reduces the likelihood of another
government shutdown, provides some relief from the sequester over the
next two years, and gives the funding predictability that our military
and federal agencies desperately need.
Congressional To-Do List
The list of items to address in 2014 is long, and I will continue to
advocate for San Diego's priorities in Washington. Clearly, providing
an atmosphere that is conducive to job growth must be at the top of the
list.
Other issues on my priority list for next year include fixing our
broken immigration system, reforming the overly-burdensome tax code,
ending and replacing the foolish across-the-board sequester cuts with
smarter cuts, investing in our country's infrastructure, protecting
basic scientific research, promoting a renewable energy portfolio, and
working toward a bipartisan strategy on addressing our nation's
long-term debt while maintaining the safety net for those who have paid
into and earned their benefits.
What do you think should be at the top of Congress' to-do list? Please
visit my Facebook page or email me
to let me know your thoughts and
opinions. I want to hear from you.

from Congressman Scott Peters
December

2013
Dear
Friend,
The
House
of
Representatives
ended
its
2013
session
last
Thursday,
on
pace
to
be
the
least
productive
Congress
since
historians
started
keeping
tracking.
As
much
as
I
love
being
in
San
Diego,
it's
ridiculous
that
the
House
adjourned
three
weeks
before
the
end
of
the
year
with
so
many
critical
problems
left
unresolved.
The
Budget
Agreement
I
am
encouraged
by
the
recent
budget
deal
and
hope
it
signals
a
reduction
in
the
hyper-partisan,
crisis-to-crisis
mentality
that
has
become
the
norm
in
Washington.
For
the
first
time
in
a
long
time,
the
freshman
class
has
brought
a
problem-solving
attitude
to
D.C.
that
our
constituents
expect
and
deserve.
The
budget
deal,
the
first
to
pass
Congress
in
four
years,
is
far
from
perfect
but
it
dramatically
reduces
the
likelihood
of
another
government
shutdown,
provides
some
relief
from
the
sequester
over
the
next
two
years,
and
gives
the
funding
predictability
that
our
military
and
federal
agencies
desperately
need.
Congressional
To-Do
List
The
list
of
items
to
address
in
2014
is
long,
and
I
will
continue
to
advocate
for
San
Diego's
priorities
in
Washington.
Clearly,
providing
an
atmosphere
that
is
conducive
to
job
growth
must
be
at
the
top
of
the
list.
Other
issues
on
my
priority
list
for
next
year
include
fixing
our
broken
immigration
system,
reforming
the
overly-burdensome
tax
code,
ending
and
replacing
the
foolish
across-the-board
sequester
cuts
with
smarter
cuts,
investing
