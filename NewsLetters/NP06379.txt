Dear Fellow Nevadan,
I join Latino families in
Nevada and across the United States in commemorating Hispanic Heritage
Month. Hispanic influence is evident throughout all 50 states and has
enriched the fabric and culture of this great nation since its
beginnings. In Nevada, the first non-Native American to set eyes on the Las
Vegas Valley was Rafael Rivera, a Spanish explorer. From the
classroom, sports, and science to the arts, business, and the Armed Forces,
Latinos have always made valuable contributions to our nation. That is
why I am proud to have joined my colleague, Senator Robert Menendez of
New Jersey, as a cosponsor of the Hispanic Heritage Month
resolution.
As we celebrate the countless contributions of
Hispanic-Americans, we should reflect on what we can do to make sure Latino
families have a fair shot. I reaffirm my commitment to fight for issues
important to the Hispanic community, such as
improving
college access and affordability ,
raising the
minimum wage ,
equal pay for women , and
immigration reform .
I fought to pass a
historic bipartisan immigration reform bill in the Senate more than a year
ago that would secure our borders, bring families out of the shadows,
and create more jobs than all the job-creating bills in the House of
Representatives combined. However, House Republicans continue to refuse
to act and are relentless in their efforts to deport DREAMERs. They
have left the President no option but to take matters into his own hands.
I know the President is determined to act, and when he does, I hope
he protects families and fixes as much of our broken immigration system
as he can within his legal authority.
I congratulate all
those who celebrate this important month.
