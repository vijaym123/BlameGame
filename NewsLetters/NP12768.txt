Dear Friend:
They say that a picture is worth a thousand words &ndash; just look at this one.
Today, the Democratic women of the Senate stood together at an amazing event to say that no woman in America should work full time and still have to raise her children in poverty. To watch video of our press conference, please click

Two-thirds of minimum wage workers are women. Two-thirds of tipped minimum wage workers are women. And in two-thirds of American families, women are the breadwinners or co-breadwinners. But right now, a mom who is working full time in a minimum wage job to support her kids earns just $15,000 per year &mdash; below the poverty line for a single mom.
The good news is that when we raise the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour, it will lift up our economy. It will lift up our workers. And it will lift up millions of women and children all across this country.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
