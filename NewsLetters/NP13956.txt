Thanksgiving
Message
As we approach the end of the year and as the
holiday season is now upon us, it is time to reflect on the past
year.
Despite many of the hardships some of our family, friends, and
neighbors have endured, this is a time to be reminded of the many gifts
that God has blessed us with.
Thanksgiving is not only a
word, but an action.
Let us show our gratitude for all that we
have by helping those who are in need, whether their need is physical
or spiritual.
This holiday season is about a sense of community
and acts of selflessness.
I would also like to take
this time to thank the brave men and women of our Armed Forces for all
of the sacrifices they and their families have made for us.
On
top of putting their lives on the line for our freedom, many are unable
to share the holidays with their family and loved ones.
As we
gather with the people we love most, let us remember those who cannot
be with their families and friends on Thanksgiving.
We
should all be grateful to live in the greatest nation in the world.
Let us spend this holiday season showing our gratitude for all that we
have been given by helping those around us in whatever way we
can.
We must never take our blessings for
granted.
I hope you have a blessed Thanksgiving and take time to enjoy your
family and friends.
