I wanted to make sure you saw this email from my good friend -- and great Democrat -- Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky.
It means so much to me that she&rsquo;s supporting our campaign. Take a look:

David, I'm asking you
David --
I&rsquo;ve had it up to here.
It&rsquo;s bad enough that Boehner and his Tea Party caucus block bill after bill. But to sue President Obama for trying to do his job? It&rsquo;s downright infuriating.
My colleague, Democrat Brad Schneider, isn&rsquo;t having any of the nonsense.
He&rsquo;s focusing on the issues that matter most to Illinois families, like bringing home good jobs, protecting our environment, and passing equal pay for equal work. But, with just less than 100 days until the election, Brad&rsquo;s locked in a DEAD HEAT with Boehner&rsquo;s handpicked candidate, Republican Bob Dold.
David, time is running out to make a difference in this race. If we&rsquo;re going to keep Brad fighting for Illinois, we need to give him our support. Will you join me?

Brad&rsquo;s opponents are hell-bent on putting this seat back in Republican hands. They want Bob Dold to be their reliable yes-man.
We&rsquo;ve got to get the facts out to Illinois voters and make sure Brad has the resources to fight back. Please use this personalized link to chip in for Brad: http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/Fight-for-Brad
Thanks for doing your part,
