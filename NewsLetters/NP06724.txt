Dear Friend,
Working to do what&rsquo;s right for New Mexico&rsquo;s economy is my top priority in the U.S. Senate.
I've been partnering with people across the state to develop a shared vision for a strong private-sector economy.
Watch this video update to learn more about the work I'm doing to help build a better future for our state.
As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I am able to take ideas from New Mexico innovators straight to Washington and promote policies that support long-term economic growth.
Whether it's working with small businesses to draft legislation that help new startups, like ATA in Albuquerque, or working to promote technology transfer from our labs that can result in successful businesses like FLUTe in Velarde, I am focused on making sure the federal government is a good partner as we work to create jobs throughout New Mexico.
Take a moment to watch my video on making New Mexico's economy strong into the future.
Down in southern New Mexico, I'm
fighting to expand commerce in order to help create jobs along the border.
Projects like an expansion of the Columbus Port of Entry are important investments for U.S.--Mexico trade and economic development, and I'm going to continue fighting to make sure these are a priority.
We have a lot of work to do to grow our economy. There are no quick fixes or one size fits all solutions. But we have
great resources in New Mexico -- first and foremost our people -- and if we work together, we can move New Mexico forward.
For more information on my work to build New Mexico&rsquo;s economy, visit my website,

contact my office
with your thoughts.
Cheers,
Tom Udall
United States Senator
