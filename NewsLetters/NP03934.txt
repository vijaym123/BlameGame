Dear Friend,
The EPA has proposed new rules to reduce ground-level ozone pollution. That&rsquo;s the scientific term for good old fashioned smog, and this new rule promises to improve public health and help create clean energy jobs.
Needless to say, the usual suspects are going to send their lawyers after this rule. They&rsquo;re going to try to prevent this new rule from taking effect, and it&rsquo;s up to us to fight back. The United States must take an active leadership role in reducing air pollution. Sign the petition to join me in supporting the new EPA rules on ground-level ozone.
Right now, the UN Climate Change Conference is taking place in Lima, Peru. Global leaders are meeting to find ways to combat climate change and preserve our environment for the next generation.
American leadership has always been critical on these issues, and right now, the planet needs us to continue that leadership. The EPA&rsquo;s new rules on ground-level ozone are a strong step in the right direction. Support clean air. Support healthier lungs for the next generation. Support the EPA&rsquo;s new rule by signing our petition.
Thank you.
