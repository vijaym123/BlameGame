Dear Friend,
It
has been a busy few weeks in Washington and here in the District. In DC,
I voted to protect the unborn and joined the Texas-led legal fight
over the Presidents unconstitutional executive action on immigration.
Back home, I toured a new Smart Apartment designed to keep our seniors
safe and spoke at a solemn ceremony honoring our areas police
officers.
Just click on the links below to get more information
about those topics and more.
Also take time to answer the
poll question to the right so I know what you think about protecting the
unborn.
