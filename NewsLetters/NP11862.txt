Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
It was a busy week up in Washington, where I voted for a series of
bills to help make the federal government smaller, more transparent and
more accountable.
I also had the opportunity to meet with Kentuckians visiting our
Nation's Capitol. I always enjoy these meetings because listening to
your concerns and getting your feedback helps me better represent you
in Washington!
Signature Industry Spotlight: Making Sure Your Voice is Heard
On Wednesday, I received confirmation that the EPA has granted my
request to postpone the deadline for Americans to voice concerns about
the EPA's efforts to regulate the coal industry into bankruptcy through
the regulation of greenhouse gases.
As Kentuckians know all to well, this Administration is focused on
killing the coal industry and the finalization of the New Source
Performance Standards rules for greenhouse gas emissions - essentially
a regulatory carbon tax - represents the latest, and perhaps most
damaging, barrage in this War on Jobs.
While I urge the President to abandon these disastrous policies
altogether, I hope you will take this extra time to share your
concerns, adding your voice to the millions asking the President to
join Congress and work on a plan that will relieve energy costs for our
families, put Americans back to work, and protect the environment.

Fighting for Reforms to Make the Federal Government More Accountable
Click here to watch video on a mobile device
.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is one of the most
powerful and unaccountable agencies in the entire federal government.
Unfortunately, the Bureau reaches deeply into the everyday lives of
Kentuckians. This avalanche of red-tape coming out of the Bureau is
making life harder for millions of Americans.
That is why on Thursday, I spoke on the House floor in support of
legislation that will reform the Bureau in a way that reins in the
misguided rules that stem from its partisan excesses and unaccountable
culture.
In my speech, I shared how the out-of-touch CFPB has incorrectly
designated Bath County, Kentucky as "non-rural" and how just last week
in Powell County, a small business owner raised his hand during my
public event to talk about how the Bureau's rules are harming his
ability to do business in his community.

Casework Corner: Ensuring WWII Veteran Properly Laid to Rest
Our office was contacted late on a Friday afternoon by a family who was
planning the burial ceremony early Monday for a World War II Veteran.
After contacting many agencies, the family was still unable to locate
the DD214 paperwork necessary to provide their loved one with proper
military honors at the funeral.
Our office was able to determine that the veteran, like many whose
paperwork was lost during the St. Louis VA Archives fire of 1973, no
longer had a DD214 on file. We were able to work after hours to
coordinate the federal agencies involved and provide the paperwork
necessary to ensure the veteran was properly laid to rest. If you are a
veteran needing a copy of your DD214, please feel free to contact our
office for assistance.
Increasing Regulatory Accountability and Transparency
At a time when our economy is struggling to grow, the federal
government continues to produce an avalanche of regulations that stifle
job creation and cost each Kentucky family roughly $15,000 every year.
We owe it to these hardworking taxpayers to increase transparency and
accountability in the regulatory process to ensure that the government
is spending their money wisely.
That's why on Thursday, I was glad to support passage of the ALERRT
Act, a comprehensive regulatory reform package that will promote jobs,
higher wages, and economic growth.
Among its many important regulatory reform measures, this legislation
includes an amendment that I introduced with Congressman Keith Rothfus
of Pennsylvania to force agency directors and administrators seeking to
impose rules predicted to hurt employment or wages of hardworking
Americans to publicly acknowledge that they were aware of that fact,
but moved forward anyway ignoring the consequences. It would also allow
concerned citizens to comment on these harmful regulations.

Kentuckians in the Capitol

this week! Thanks to Kentucky representatives from the American
Alliance of Museums, the Kentucky Association of Health Underwriters,

Kentucky Farm Bureau Congressional Tour, the Kentucky Geographic
Alliance and Frankfort Independent School System, the Kentucky

Advancing Legislation to Help the Valley View Ferry
It was great to see so many people on Monday in Richmond at my "Meet
the Congressman" event! I always enjoy these events as they give me the
opportunity to answer your questions and provide an update on my work
in Congress.
I was glad to share an update regarding the exciting progress of my
work to help restore full operation of the Valley View Ferry, which has
been harmed by over-broad federal regulations. After testifying before
the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in October, I am
pleased to announce that they have recently passed legislation that
includes my recommendation to provide much-needed regulatory relief to
the Valley View Ferry! I hope it comes to the House floor for a vote
soon so we can restore full operation of the ferry.
Thank you to everyone who attended! If you couldn't make it this time,
please know that your views are important to me and I look forward to
catching up with you soon!

Ensuring

Our
office
was
contacted
late
on
a
Friday
afternoon
by
a
family
who
was
planning
the
burial
ceremony
early
Monday
for
a

After

agencies,
the
family
was
still
unable
to
locate
the
DD214
paperwork
necessary
to
provide
their
loved
one
with
proper
military
honors
at
the
funeral.
Our
office
was
able
to
determine
that
the
veteran,
like
many
whose
paperwork
was
lost
during
the
St.
Louis
VA
Archives
fire
of
1973,
no
longer
had
a
DD214
on
file.
We
were
able
to
work
after
hours
to
coordinate
the
federal
agencies
involved
and
provide
the
paperwork
necessary
to
ensure
the
veteran
was

laid

DD214,

Increasing
Regulatory
Accountability
and
Transparency
At
a
time
when
our
economy
is
struggling
to
grow,
the
federal
government
continues
to
produce
an
avalanche
of
regulations
that
stifle
job
creation
and
cost
each
Kentucky
family
roughly
$15,000
every
year.
We
owe
it
to
these
hardworking
taxpayers
to
increase
transparency
and
accountability
in
the
regulatory
process
to
ensure
that
the
government
is
spending
their
money
wisely.
That&#8217;s
why
on
Thursday,
I
was
glad
to
support
passage
of
the
ALERRT
Act,
a
comprehensive
regulatory
reform
package
that
will
promote
jobs,
higher
wages,
and
economic
growth.
Among
its
many
important

this

includes
an

I
