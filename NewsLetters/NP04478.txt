Tell John Boehner: NO MORE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS &gt;&gt;
We all remember the disaster that was the 2013 government shutdown. American families certainly remember. They felt it the hardest.
Now, Republicans are threatening to do it all over again! Enough is enough. Tell Speaker Boehner to take another government shutdown off the table. Supporter:

David--
The election was less than two weeks ago, but Republicans are already stirring up trouble.
Just last week,
Boehner refused to rule out another government shutdown
if President Obama uses his executive action power -- which the Constitution grants him.
BOEHNER: "We are going to fight the president tooth and nail if he continues down this path [&hellip;] So all of the options are on the table."
This is just ridiculous. Instead of actually working to help the American people, Republicans are choosing to play games and stand in the way of President Obama. The last time they did this, it was a disaster. America just can&rsquo;t afford another government shutdown. ADD YOUR NAME: Tell John Boehner to take another government shutdown off the table.
