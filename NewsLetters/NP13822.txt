A Message from Representative Sean Duffy
December 8, 2013
Dear friends,
Although the legislative year is winding down, we are not slowing down.
There is still much work to be done. We're going to spend the entire
month of December working to bring relief for so many Americans who
continue to experience daily hardships. Whether immediate fixes to the
healthcare law, regulatory fixes for our rural communities or bringing
job seekers and job holders together under one roof, read on for more
about ways I am working on your behalf to make life a little easier,
and hopefully a whole lot better, for our 7th District community.
Real problems require real solutions: The number of Americans losing
their health insurance continues to climb with estimates reaching tens
of millions and some going up to 100 million. This week on the Floor of
the House, I again talked about Denise, who is in need of a kidney
transplant. I would prefer to fully repeal this law and replace it with
an alternative, such as the one I introduced
, but
in the mean time, millions of Americans, like Denise, need a more
immediate solution. I recently introduced H.R.3621
. This bill would
provide access to health insurance coverage of life-sustaining
treatments furnished by certain providers and could mean the difference
between life and death for many Americans in situations similar to
Denise's. To watch a clip of my Floor remarks from PBS News Hour click
on the image:
Here are the jobs! I hear so many people tell me I don't have the
opportunity to get a good - better paying - job. And then I hear
employers say I can't find good, skilled labor to fill the spots I have
open.
Monday's job fair in Wausau will bring those looking for jobs and those
who are looking for employees under the same roof. Click on the image

Help our rural Wisconsin communities: In the Financial Services
Committee this week, we discussed legislation that would amend the
CFPB's QM rule to more accurately determine rural communities in
America:
"I live in rural America.a lot of dairy there, a lot of farms in
Central and Northern Wisconsin. If you look at the CFPB's QM rule in
regard to balloon loans.we have Douglas County in the northwest tip of
Wisconsin.outside of that little county where Superior is located, the
whole county is rural. It is farms. [Under this rule] it is designated
non-rural. The industry, the agriculture is all the same, but you only
get these kinds of rules from bureaucrats in Washington who have no
idea about our Wisconsin communities, our makeup, and how our economies
work. When you have bureaucrats in Washington making decisions you see
maps like the ones we have for the balloon loans that don't make sense."

Dear
friends,
[if gte mso 10]>
<![endif]
Although
the
legislative
year
is
winding

we
are
not
slowing
down.
There
is
still
much
work

We&#8217;re

The

Help
our
rural
Wisconsin
communities:
In
the
Financial
Services
Committee
this
week,
we
discussed
legislation
that
would
amend
the
CFPB&#8217;s
QM
rule
to
more
accurately
determine
rural
communities
in
America:
&#8220;I
live
in
rural
America&#8230;a
lot
of
dairy
there,
a
lot
of
farms
in
Central
and
Northern
Wisconsin.
If
you
look
at
the
CFPB&#8217;s
QM
rule
in
regard
to
balloon
loans&#8230;we
have
Douglas
County
in
the
northwest
tip
of
Wisconsin&#8230;outside
of
that
little
county
where
Superior
is
located,
the
whole
county
is
rural.
It
is
farms.
[Under
this
rule]
it
is
designated
non-rural.
The
industry,
the
agriculture
is
all
the
same,
but
you
only
get
these
kinds
of
rules
from
bureaucrats
in
Washington
who
have
no
idea
about
our
Wisconsin
communities,
our
makeup,
and
how
our
economies
work.
When
you
have
bureaucrats
in
Washington
making
decisions
you
see
maps
like
the
ones
we
have
for
the
balloon
loans
that
don&#8217;t
make
sense.&#8221;
