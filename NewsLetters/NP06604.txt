Wicker: U.S. Can Defeat ISIS, But
President Must Lead
Half-Measures Are Insufficient
to Overthrow Terror
Group
As the situation in Iraq deteriorates, a radical offshoot of
al-Qaeda is seeking to expand its influence.
Known as the Islamic
State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the terrorist movement has launched a
barbaric campaign of torture, mass executions, crucifixions, and
beheadings.
Its savagery is broadcast to the world through gruesome
propaganda online, including the recently released video documenting the
horrific murder of U.S. photojournalist James
Foley.
'Imminent Threat to Every
Interest'
Members of the Obama Administration have not minced words
when expressing concern and outrage over ISIS's brutality and rapid
spread of extremism.
After Foley's murder, Secretary of State John
Kerry said that "the wickedness [ISIS] represents must be destroyed."
According to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, the group is "an
imminent threat to every interest we have, whether it's in Iraq or
anywhere else."
If these
statements are true, then Americans are right to question why President Obama
has only issued half-measures in response.
Instead of a bold
strategy to defeat ISIS, the United States has so far pursued a modest
deployment of military advisers and limited airstrikes, which are
insufficient to overthrow this organized, formidable, and sophisticated
force.
The Administration's abandonment of Iraq in 2011 and
indecisiveness last summer in Syria have created a dangerous void for militant
Islamists to exploit.
At a news conference about ISIS on August
28, the President conceded, "We dont have a strategy
yet."
The threats, meanwhile, continue to
multiply.
The rise of ISIS in northern Iraq and its operations in
Syria have put regional stability at risk, jeopardizing the security
of our allies in Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon, and Kuwait.
The
group's recruitment of fighters from the United States and Europe also
raises the potential for terrorist plots here at home.
From a
humanitarian perspective, the rampant religious persecution of Christian and
Yazidi minorities has displaced tens of thousands, many fleeing into
the Sinjar mountains.
According to news reports, thousands of
civilians have been slaughtered as ISIS expands its control in areas of
northwestern Iraq.
Launching a Political, Economic, and
Military Response
In a
recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, Gen. Jack Keane, former vice chief
of staff of the U.S. Army, and Danielle Pletka, a senior vice president
at the American Enterprise Institute, outline a comprehensive
strategy to stop ISIS with political, economic, and military tactics.
They argue that the United States must use its clout to forge regional
partnerships, dismantle the terror group's considerable financial
network, and support military action that aims for defeat, not just
containment.
Keane and Pletka
write, "A U.S.-led international coalition can provide the military
capability, including air interdiction to deny ISIS freedom of movement,
take away its initiative to attack at will in Iraq, and dramatically
reduce its sanctuary in Syria."
In other words, we can stop ISIS
with minimal ground troops if we engage and assist the Iraqi, Kurdish,
and the Free Syrian armies.
Could Afghanistan Become the
Next Iraq?
The
consequences of half-measures in Iraq should serve as a lesson for U.S.
action in Afghanistan now.
All but 9,800 U.S. troops are expected to
depart at the end of the year, leaving Afghan security forces with
little foreign assistance.
I am concerned that this limited
follow-on force may be insufficient to provide stability and that the
President may decide to withdraw from Afghanistan altogether.
As Iraq
illustrates, the end of war does not preclude a future of chaos and
the reversal of more than a decade of hard-fought gains.
As a member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, I have called on Gen. Joseph Dunford, former
commander of the International Security Assistance Force and future Marine
Corps Commandant, to "speak truth to power" about the drawdown of troops
in Afghanistan.
I noted in a hearing earlier this year that "had
we gotten the correct advice, and been given a more realistic
assessment, the disaster in Iraq could have been
avoided."
Congress and the President have an obligation
to learn from these mistakes.
As we work toward a strategy to
eliminate ISIS, we must be mindful of the pitfalls that could make
Afghanistan similarly susceptible to radical groups with a malignant
intent.
