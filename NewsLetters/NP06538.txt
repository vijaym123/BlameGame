Wicker Urges Swift Approval of Defense
Bill
Blueprint for Military Priorities Is
Key
to U.S. Preparedness, National
Security
The world is looking to America for
leadership.
We must have a comprehensive strategy to confront both
the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) as well as Vladimir Putin's
aggression in Ukraine.
A key component of any such strategy is
the military power of the United States and the resolve to project that
power when necessary.
The "National Defense Authorization Act" (NDAA) offers military
leaders a blueprint for maintaining a strong defense that can protect our
national security interests at home and abroad.
And yet, Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has not brought this fundamental
piece of legislation before the Senate for consideration.
The Senate Armed Services Committee
approved the Fiscal Year 2015 NDAA three months ago.
As a member of
the committee, I worked to include several provisions in the measure
to strengthen Mississippi's role in equipping and otherwise supporting
our men and women in uniform.
These provisions would preserve
U.S. military might
by:
Preventing
cuts to the National Guard.
The Obama Administration
has proposed to reduce the U.S. Army to pre-World War II levels and
restructure its aviation program.
An amendment I successfully
sponsored with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) would stave off sweeping cuts
to the National Guard, including drastic cuts in troop strength and the
transfer of Apache attack helicopters out of Army National Guard
units.
Our amendment would delay the changes for at least one year
while an independent commission develops recommendations on force
structure and size.
Units like Mississippi's 155th Heavy Brigade
Combat Team, a well-trained ready reserve force, should not be jeopardized
by shortsighted and ill-considered
action.
Safeguarding taxpayer dollars.
Keesler
Air Force Base has been recognized as one of the country's top air
bases, yet there have been repeated attempts to relocate 10 of its
C-130J transport planes.
I continue to demand an accounting of how
this move would produce purported financial savings and what the
implications are for our forces' intra-airlift capability.
The Defense
Authorization approved by the committee would provide these answers by
requiring the Air Force to submit a certified report to Congress at
least 60 days before any aircraft are transferred.
Modernizing our amphibious warships.
A robust amphibious fleet puts potential adversaries on notice
that America's fighting forces can respond rapidly to threats.
These ships are incredibly versatile
utilized for everything from
heavy combat to disaster relief and humanitarian crises.
However,
our fleet is significantly smaller than the number needed to perform
required missions, and many of the ships are near the end of their
service lives.
NDAA includes an amendment I sponsored to authorize the
construction of a twelfth LPD-17 warship.
The men and women who
defend our national interests in perilous corners of the globe
deserve nothing less than world-class hardware when carrying out their
missions.
NDAA also prohibits a
Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) in 2015, offering continuity to
bases, installations, and units around the country.
A BRAC round
would be an inefficient and ill-timed way to realize savings in
defense.
Our military presence must remain resilient as dangerous
groups like ISIS and instability in the former Soviet bloc put U.S.
interests at risk.
NDAA is the
framework for ensuring that America's troops continue to be the most
formidable fighting force in the world.
By passing NDAA for 2015, the
Senate Armed Services Committee and the House of Representatives have
done their parts to extend a legacy that has earned bipartisan support
for the past 52 years.
It is time for the full Senate to follow
suit.
Majority Leader Reid should bring it to the Senate floor
without further delay.
