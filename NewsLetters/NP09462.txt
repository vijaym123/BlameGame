This week, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio
continued efforts to bring greater
accountability to Veterans Affairs by
pushing the Senate to pass his VA reform
bill, which was overwhelmingly passed by
the U.S. House of Representatives earlier
this week. Marco and his Senate
colleagues introduced a resolution
condemning the death sentence a pregnant
Sudanese woman received for failing to
recant her Christian faith. He also
hailed the Senate Foreign Relations
Committees passage of a bill that
would sanction human rights violators in
Venezuela. Finally, Marco joins the rest
of the country in commemorating our
fallen heroes for their bravery and
sacrifice, and he wishes all servicemen
and woman, and their families, a
meaningful
Memorial
Day .

Days Before Memorial
Day,
Rubios Push To Pass VA Reform
Bill Blocked By Senate Democrats
On Thursday, Marco spoke on the floor
to demand immediate passage of S. 2013,
the
VA
Management Accountability Act of
2014
, which overwhelmingly passed in the
U.S. House of Representatives on
Wednesday. Just days before Memorial Day,
Marcos push for more VA
accountability was blocked by Senate
Democrats. An excerpt of his floor speech
is below:
"And so here's where we
stand:I've come to this floor
today togive my colleagues
theopportunity to send this to
thePresident before we leave
forthe Memorial Day
recess.We have an opportunity,
right now,to take up the bill
that theHouse just passed by
anoverwhelming, bipartisan
majority
enacted into law
byunanimous consent
and
send it tothe President so he can
sign it. So that a week from now, and a
month from now, when the results of
thatinvestigation come to his
desk and that of the Secretary,
theycan discipline and/or fire
thepeople who have not done
theirjobs and have put our
veteransin harms way with
regard to theservices the VA is
supposed tobe offering.That
is all this bill does.Nothing
more and nothing less.
We are giving a
Secretary,appointed by this
President,confirmed by this
Senate, theopportunity to be able
tofire employees of his
agencythat are not doing their
jobs.That is all we are asking
here.It is not more complicated
thanthat. And I do not understand
why anyone would not support that
concept. And its right here for
us. For everyone talking about how
quickly we need to act on this
here is your chance.

Rubio, Coons, Senate Colleagues
Introduce Resolution Condemning Death
Sentence For Sudanese Christian
Woman
Marco, a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, along with Chairman
of the Subcommittee on African Affairs
Chris Coons (D-DE), Committee Chairman
Bob Menendez (D-NJ), and Jim Inhofe
(R-OK) introduced legislation condemning
the death sentence of Meriam Yahia
Ibrahim Ishag, a Sudanese Christian woman
accused of apostasy, and calling for her
immediate and unconditional release from
prison, where she remains with her 20
month-old son.
Ibrahim, also eight months pregnant,
was sentenced to death for allegedly
leaving Islam after authorities were made
aware of her marriage to a Christian
man.
The resolution reaffirms the U.S.
governments commitment to ending
religious discrimination, calling for the
inclusion of religious freedom and
respect for international human rights
during the drafting of Sudans new
constitution.
I am disgusted and appalled
by the inhumane verdict Ms. Ibrahim has
received, simply for refusing to recant
her Christian faith. This is yet
another example of the kind of
religious intolerance and persecution
that has no place in any civilized,
free society,
said Rubio . No one should
have to live in a world where they fear
for their life simply because of
religion.
This legislation strives to
encourage religious freedom within
Sudan by ensuring that the new
constitution includes protections for
such fundamental rights, which would be
a significant step toward a more
democratic future for the people of
Sudan,
added Rubio . I also
commend Ms. Ibrahims courage in
refusing to renounce her Christianity,
and I encourage her to remain
steadfast. The world condemns her
verdict and will stand by her in her
moment of need.
Rubio Comments After Foreign
Relations Committee Passage Of
Venezuela Sanctions
Marco issued the following statements
regarding the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee's passage of S. 2141, the
Venezuela
Defense of Human Rights and Civil
Society Act of 2014
, which is sponsored by Marco and
Senators Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Bill Nelson
(D-FL) and Mark Kirk (R-IL).
Marcos statement is available
below.
Today we took an important
step forward to punish human rights
abusers in Nicols Maduros
regime. The Venezuelan people have
suffered enough under the incompetence
of Hugo Chvez and now
Nicols Maduro.
And now that thousands of
innocent Venezuelans have protested
courageously and peacefully, against
the failure that is this chavista
government, we cant allow the
governments repression, violence
and murders to go unpunished.
We have to severely punish
the Maduro regime, and today the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee took a key
step toward approving these sanctions.
And I hope the full Senate will soon do
the same.
