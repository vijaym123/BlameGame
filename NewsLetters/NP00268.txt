Rubio, Shaheen Bill Becomes Law
On Friday, Marco and Senator Jeanne
Shaheen (D-NH) welcomed the signing of the
Girls Count Act into law. The
bill, which
they
introduced earlier this year , will
direct current U.S. foreign assistance
programming to support the rights of women
and girls in developing countries by
working to establish birth registries in
their countries.
Read an excerpt of Marcos statement
on the signing below and learn more about
the Girls Count Act
here .
Rubio: By having the President
sign the Girls Count Act today, the U.S. is
solidifying our commitment to helping all
kids around the world to get registered at
birth so they are counted and able to fully
participate in and contribute to their
societies. Now the important work of
implementing this law can begin, and I will
be monitoring the administrations
progress in helping children with no birth
certificates attain those critical
documents.
ICYMI: Rubio Pushes Amendments In Bid
To Modify State Department Operations
On Tuesday, seven of Marcos
amendments to a bill reforming operations
at the State Department were passed by the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and are
now on their way to the Senate floor.
Read Marcos statement about the
amendments below and McClatchys
coverage of the legislative accomplishment
here .
Rubio:The U.S. faces a
growing list of global challenges, and this
authorization bill will help the State
Department better advance Americas
interests by implementing key security and
operational reforms and ensuring resources
are used more effectively. Im
pleased that it also includes key
priorities that I have worked on and
advocated for to promote democracy and
human rights, especially in the Western
Hemisphere, and advance U.S. interests
around the world.
Rubio Comments On Obamas Lack
Of ISIL Strategy
Upon hearing reports that ISIL
terrorists had captured over 80 Eritrean
Christians in Libya, just a day after
President Obama admitted he still does not
have a strategy for dealing with the
terrorist group, Marco called for an
increase in targeting of ISILs
positions in Iraq and Syria, preventing the
group from gaining additional resources and
fighters from abroad, and working more
closely with our regional, Kurdish and
Sunni partners.
Read an excerpt of Marcos statement
below and the full statement
here .
Rubio:For more than a year
now, the entire world has seen the face of
evil through the so-called Islamic State,
which has overrun cities, massacred tens of
thousands of innocent people, desecrated
religious sites and tried to wipe out
Christians from the cradle of Christianity.
And yet, President Obama still has no
strategy to destroy this dangerous
terrorist group that threatens global
stability and safety, and has pledged to do
harm to Americans and our interests around
the world.
On Anniversary Of Borinqueneers Bill
Signing, Rubio Again Urges Obama To
Expedite Congressional Gold Medal
On Wednesday, Marco marked the one
year anniversary of President Obama signing
a bill to award the 65th Infantry Regiment
Borinqueneers with the
Congressional Gold Medal, an honor that
still has not been bestowed on these
veterans, and urged Obama to expedite the
Congressional Gold Medals.
Read an excerpt of Marcos statement
below and learn more about Marcos
support of the Borinqueneers
here .
Rubio: The Borinqueneers
service in World War I, World War II and
the Korean War deserves to be recognized.
Unfortunately, the awarding of the
Borinqueneers Congressional Gold
Medals has gotten bogged down in a
bureaucratic logjam, even as several of
them have died without ever having received
this tribute they earned during their
lifetimes.
On this anniversary of the
bills signing, we remember that time
is truly of the essence. I am urging the
President to do everything he can to make
sure the remaining Borinqueneers living
today receive their Congressional Gold
Medals as soon as possible.
