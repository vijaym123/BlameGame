We just got some troubling news. Speaker Boehner is launching a brand new SuperPAC aimed SQUARELY at Brad.
Boehner&rsquo;s dead-set on defeating Brad, and it&rsquo;s clear he&rsquo;ll do whatever it takes to bolster his radical Republican majority.
If we don&rsquo;t go on offense -- today -- Boehner&rsquo;s attacks threaten to take hold with voters. We can&rsquo;t let that happen. We need to reach 25O donations by 11:59 PM to fund Brad&rsquo;s Rapid Response Fund.
It&rsquo;s critical we don&rsquo;t fall short. Are you in?
David Johnson Rapid Response Deadline: 11:59 PM, CDT
Your Support: $5.00

As Election Day quickly approaches, we&rsquo;re going to need you to dig a little deeper. There&rsquo;s simply too much at stake.
Thanks for stepping up,
