Rogers Applauds House Passage of Preventing Executive Overreach on Immigration Act
WASHINGTON, DC
-
U.S. Rep. Harold "Hal" Rogers (KY-05) applauded passage of the Preventing Executive Overreach on Immigration Act ( H.R. 5759 ). Rogers co-sponsored the bill that passed by a vote of 219 to 197 in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday, December 4. The bill reaffirms that the President does not have the authority to exempt more than four million illegal immigrants from deportation.
"This legislation puts an immediate halt on President Obama's executive amnesty and prevents any future orders that would attempt to bypass Congress on immigration," said Rogers. "The American people spoke loud and clear - they want our immigration laws enforced rather than a suspension and override of our Constitution."
H.R. 5759 applies to all new and previously denied requests for exemptions and deferrals of removal from the United States, as well as any related work authorization. It also provides for necessary exceptional humanitarian and law enforcement exceptions.
Additionally, this bill does not affect federal funding and will not put the country at risk of a government shutdown.
Rogers urged the Senate to take immediate action on this legislation.
