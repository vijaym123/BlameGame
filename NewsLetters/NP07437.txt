Dear
David,
As a father of four and grandfather of six, I know that
protecting our children is one of the nation's most important
responsibilities.
Missouri has 22 Children's Advocacy Centers that
serve 7,000 of our state's most vulnerable children each year.
And this week, Congress took an important step to ensure the safety of
our children when the House
passed
a bill I
introduced in the Senate, the bipartisan reauthorization of the "Victims of
Child Abuse Act."
This legislation, which I
introduced
with
Senator Coons
from Delaware, would help centers in Missouri and nationwide continue the
important work they do to provide safe haven for child abuse victims,
while also helping law enforcement officials hold perpetrators
accountable.
I was honored to receive Missouri KidsFirst's " Standing with Children " Award this year, and I am
pleased my colleagues in both the House and the Senate worked together to
send this bill to the president's desk.
As always, I
invite you to join me online by sharing your thoughts on my
Facebook
page, on
Twitter , and on
Instagram .
Sincere regards,
