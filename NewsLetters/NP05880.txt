ND Farmers: Learn More about Important Farm Bill Program Decisions
North Dakota's farmers are the heart of our state - and those who work
in the agriculture industry make up nearly 25 percent of the workers in
our state. They grow the corn, beans, lentils, and other crops that we
and so many others across the country and the world eat. That's why my
top priority when I joined the Senate was to pass a long-term,
comprehensive Farm Bill that supports our farmers and ranchers so they
can do their jobs - and we did it.
A major component of the bill - which I helped write, negotiate, and
pass - are the farm safety net programs. Producers will be able to make
one-time decisions to reallocate base acres, update yields, and elect
either Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC) - county or individual level
coverage - or Price Loss Coverage (PLC) for their crops.
If you're a producer or landowner, you will have several options to
consider and decisions to make over the coming months. I know most of
you are still focused on harvest, but there is plenty of time to
explore your options and choose the program that works best for your
operation. Here are the important dates and deadlines you will need to
know and details on how you can learn more about how these programs
could impact you:
*
Base Acre Reallocation and Yield Updates
Now through 2/27/15: Owners have a one-time opportunity to
reallocate their base acres and update crop yields.
*
ARC/PLC Election
11/17/14 through 3/31/15: Producers have a one-time decision
that will remain in the effect for 2014-2018 crop years.
*
ARC/PLC Enrollment
Mid-April 2015 through Summer 2015: Producers will sign
contracts to participate in ARC or PLC for 2014 and 2015 crop years.
Additionally, USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) in North Dakota and the
North Dakota State University Extension Service are partnering to host
informational sessions this month to discuss ARC and PLC throughout the
state:

farms. Click here to find the online tools and more information.
I will always work tirelessly to support North Dakota's producers. And
these options, created through the 2014 Farm Bill, will play an
important role in keeping our state's agriculture industry strong for
future generations.
