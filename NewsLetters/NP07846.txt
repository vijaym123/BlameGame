The Senate
Should Join the House Effort to Create
Jobs and Spur Economic Recovery
Dear Friend,
My top priority in Congress has always
been adopting policies that will lead to
the creation of private sector jobs for the
hardworking individuals and families of
Virginias Fifth District. With the
unemployment rate in many Central and
Southside Virginia localities still
substantially exceeding the national rate,
government-created obstacles to economic
growth are unacceptable. My colleagues in
the House and I have passed dozens of bills
as a part of our agenda to improve the
environment for job creation; yet,
many
of our bills
remain stuck in the U.S.
Senate, awaiting action. Two bills recently
passed by the House illustrate what a great
opportunity we have to jumpstart the
economy if the Senate will join us in that
effort.
A key component of our pro-growth jobs
plan is an all-of-the-above energy strategy
that increases oil and gas production,
including off of Virginias coast,
the expansion of viable alternative
energies, as well as conservation. Just
last month, the House passed H.R. 4899,
the
Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an America
that Works Act , which expands onshore
energy production, encouraging the creation
of new jobs, including thousands of jobs in
Virginia, and lightening the burden on our
hardworking families and small
businesses.
Another means of growing our economy and
creating jobs includes supporting our Main
Street businesses and recognizing that they
are truly the engines of economic growth.
Government-created uncertainty, such as
temporary tax policy that changes from year
to year, can hinder their progress and
growth. To address this issue, the House
recently passed H.R. 4457,
Americas
Small Business Tax Relief Act , which
would make permanent a tax provision that
allows small businesses to expense
investments in new equipment and property
each year. By permanently allowing small
businesses to deduct up front these costs,
we will strengthen our economy by making it
easier for them to invest back into their
businesses and relieving these vital job
creators from some of their tax compliance
costs, which are 65% higher than those of
big businesses.
Both of these bills enjoyed bipartisan
support in the House, but have been ignored
by the Senate, frustrating those whose see
the potential of policies like these to
generate the jobs we so desperately need.
In recent days however, we may have seen a
breakthrough signaling an end to the
Senate's inaction on House jobs bills. Last
year, the House passed long overdue reform
of federal workforce programs. The federal
government currently operates 47 different
workforce programs, many of which are
duplicative or do not produce results. This
bill aimed to eliminate ineffective or
duplicative workforce training programs and
focus our precious resources on the
programs that actually help people obtain
skills employers are seeking, which will
help them get jobs. The Senate finally
passed a similar measure a few days ago,
and
the
House concurred
with that bill last
week, allowing the legislation to advance
to the president's desk.
As our country continues to grapple with
a national debt of over $17 trillion and
with too many Americans out of work, it is
crucial that we improve our workforce
development programs and put
taxpayers dollars to better use. I
am glad the Senate recognized the need to
tackle these issues, and it is my hope they
will now consider the scores of other bills
we have passed to enhance the environment
for job creation - our country's greatest
priority.
