Friend,
According to a
report
issued by the Treasury Inspector General for the Department of the Treasury, the IRS paid over $4 billion in child tax credits to illegal immigrants, through a refundable tax credit called the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC).
Claiming tax credits intended for law-abiding American taxpayers is not only wrong, but also, as the report states, serves as an additional incentive...to enter, reside, and work in the United States without authorization.
Thats why I support legislation to require tax filers to provide a valid Social Security number in order to claim tax credits, including the child tax credit, when filing their tax returns.
Simply put, it would prevent illegal immigrants from claiming $4 billion in tax credits, at the expense of American taxpayers.
Yours in Service,
Randy
