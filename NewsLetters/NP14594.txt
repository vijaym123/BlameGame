A
Bipartisan Call for Delay of the
Individual Mandate within the President's
Healthcare Law
Dear Friend,
This week, after watching the failed
roll out of Healthcare.gov take the
spotlight, several new and unnerving facts
emerged as Congress held hearings to
investigate further the inner workings of
the Administrations handling and
implementation of the Presidents
healthcare law. Maintaining and introducing
the website should have been the simplest
aspect of this complex piece of
legislation, and if its failed roll out is
any indication, it alarms me to think of
what lies ahead.
The American people are now seeing that
the President misled us about the
consequences of this misguided law. The
President promised the American people that
if you like your health care plan,
you can keep it; yet, reports this
week indicated that millions of people will
lose their current plan, being forced to
obtain plans that are much more expensive
and may not allow them to see their current
doctor. This fact was known to the
Administration for more than three years,
yet it continued to assuage
Americans fears with a false
promise. Apparently, the Presidents
motto should have stated that, if
the government likes your health care plan,
the government will let you keep
it.
The President also promised that health
care costs would decrease for everyone,
saving on average $2,500 per family.
Instead, rates and deductibles are
skyrocketing, and Americans are not only
facing higher healthcare costs, but some
are being forced to reduce their working
hours because of compliances being enforced
by the ACA.
While members of Congress are trying to
conduct oversight to get answers from the
Administration about how and why this law
is failing so badly, the Administration
seeks to hide the truth from the American
people. On October 8th, Congress requested
enrollment figures; and while the Secretary
did not offer up that information, major
news outlets have recently reported that
just 6 people enrolled in the exchanges on
its first day. This is a testament to both
the websites inoperability and the
fact that the American people are wary of
government-run health care.
The Administration has admitted on
numerous occasions that the
Presidents health care law is not
working. Businesses, but not American
citizens, have been granted a one-year
delay from the laws mandates, the
website is a debacle, and there is little
to no transparency when it comes to the
laws implementation. Now, it is time
that individuals are granted the same
reprieve from the Affordable Care Act that
businesses have received. I am encouraged
that some of our Democratic colleagues in
the Senate have begun to call for a delay
in the individual mandate, especially after
Republicans in the House requested it last
month. Ultimately, a full repeal of the
damaging healthcare law is in the best
interest of the American people; however,
until we are able to achieve this long-term
goal, I remain committed to ensuring its
harm is minimized as much as possible
through delaying its implementation.
