Dear Friend,
Thank you for subscribing to my email updates. I appreciate your
continued interest and value this opportunity to share with you what
I'm doing in Washington and the 15th District. For more ways to stay in
touch, click on the social networking sites below.
Deadline Day At Hand For Federal Disaster Assistance Applications
Monday, February 3, is the deadline for survivors of the November 17
tornadoes and severe storms to apply for disaster assistance from the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Small Business
Administration (SBA).
In the two months since the November 26 federal disaster declaration,
FEMA's Individual Assistance Program has approved more than $2.5
million in grants to Illinois homeowners and renters for home repairs,
rental assistance and grants to replace lost personal items. The SBA
reports more than $18.7 million in low-interest disaster loans has been
approved to help start the rebuilding process in the state.
Even if survivors are unsure they qualify, it is recommended that they
apply by the Monday deadline to keep their options open. FEMA
registration can be done online at www.DisasterAssisance.gov
or by calling 1-800-621-FEMA (3362). SBA loan
applications can be completed at https://disasterloan.sba.gov/ela. Call
the SBA customer service center with questions at 1-800-659-2955.
Reminders:
It is important for those who have registered for federal assistance
to inform FEMA of their actual insurance settlement. If survivors are
underinsured, FEMA may be able to help with grants for repairs, or
Additional Living Expenses if their insurance company allotment is
exhausted.
If you think your insurance company may be delaying a settlement, you
should contact the Illinois Department of Insurance with questions or
information about filing a complaint against the insurance carrier. The
toll-free number is 1-866-445-5364. For more information, visit the
department's website at www.Insurance.Illinois.gov
.
Filing an SBA loan application does not obligate survivors to accept;
however, you must apply by Monday. If approved for the loan, you can
wait for months to utilize it. Once warm weather returns, damage to
your home not yet seen may show up.
Do not wait on an insurance settlement before returning an
application. Insurance may not pay for any or all of the storm-related
damage. Survivors can begin their recovery immediately with an SBA
disaster loan. The loan balance will be reduced by their insurance
settlement.
Farm Bill Featuring Major Policy Reforms Moves Through House
I supported the Agricultural Act of 2014, the farm bill conference
report. The bill passed the House Wednesday and is expected to pass the
Senate this week and be signed into law by the President.
Important farm policy reforms in the legislation include repeal of
Direct Payments, strengthening of crop insurance, consolidating 23
conservation programs into 13, and many others.
One of the major reforms is in the food stamp program (Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP - in Illinois, Link), and $8
billion in savings come from food stamp reforms. A total of $23 billion
is saved over ten years.
The food stamp reforms include eliminating the LIHEAP loophole,
prohibiting advertising and enrollment drives, eliminating medical
marijuana as an eligible expense, and allowing states to pursue fraud.
In total, four current commodity programs are repealed. In addition to
Direct Payments, Counter-Cyclical Payments, Average Crop Revenue
Election program, and Supplemental Revenue Assistance Payments will
end. The farm bill moves toward risk management by encouraging
participation in the Price Loss Coverage and Agriculture Risk Coverage
programs, in addition to crop insurance.
Many agriculture groups supported the bill, including American Farm
Bureau Federation, American Soybean Association, Illinois Farm Bureau,
National Corn Growers Association, and National Rural Electric
Cooperative Association.
A Hands-On Science Lesson
On Thursday, I visited the St. Louis Science Center, where I was given
a tour by Cindy Encarnacion of the hands-on lab, which was partially
funded through a federal grant. The SLSC currently features an exhibit
highlighting all sources of energy, including coal. The main purpose of
my visit was to be briefed on a planned agricultural display that will
be quite impressive. Look for that to come in 2015.
Propane Costs Are Concern for Many
After hearing from numerous constituents and local propane dealers, I
want constituents to know what information I have been able to discover
about the problem.
Regarding exports - According to the National Propane Gas Association,
since 2008 exports of propane have risen; however, U.S. production of
propane has also increased much more than the amount of those exports
every year, except for a small difference in 2013.
Regarding pipelines - Central and southern Illinois propane is shipped
in from Kansas via the Mid-American Pipeline and other pipelines pass
through the 15th District. Although two other pipelines can transport
propane to the Kansas hub from refineries, one pipeline has had
"capacity constraints."
Regarding demand - The economic principle of supply and demand is also
playing a role in this year's shortages. According to the U.S. Energy
Information Administration, the region Illinois is in (which also
includes Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio) has had a 15 percent
increase in heating degree days this winter, which means a higher
demand for propane. This was the largest increase outside of the south.
Additionally, the late harvest increased use in drying grain.
State actions - Both the states of Illinois and Texas have lifted some
restriction on truck drivers and trucks in order to allow for more
propane to be shipped via truck to areas of the country in need.
Illinois has also increased LIHEAP payments by $1,000 for those who use
propane.
Assistance - Even if you have never sought assistance for heating
expense before, the LIHEAP program does exist. Income levels are $16,
755 for a single and for a family of four $34,575 in order to qualify.
Applications are made at local community action agencies. For more
information, feel free to contact my Maryville office at 618-288-7190.
Congress doesn't have a direct role in solving the short-term problems.
I am signing onto a letter to the President that asks him to do
anything in his power to help. There are not specific requests made,
but this will bring the issue to his attention by Members of Congress.
In addition I voted for a bill that the House passed last November that
would reform the process for the permitting of natural gas pipelines.
While this wouldn't help immediately, the Senate needs to take up the
bill in order for additional pipelines to be built.
I wish there was a way to fix the problem immediately, but from the
information we have been given, there is no quick fix.
My Comments on the President's State of the Union Speech
State of the Union speeches are always more political than whoever the
President is wants to make it seem. President Obama - in an election
year - took a more liberal, activist tone.
Promises made in speeches are also not automatically the law of the
land. However, President Obama wants to start using executive authority
to take more actions without Congress' involvement. This is an
unprecedented challenge to Congress by a President.
While the President talked about energy security, his EPA has taken
several steps that will hinder what was becoming a growing coal
industry. I'm afraid of what his pen or his EPA might do to other
energy issues that benefit Illinois.
The President talked about jobs, yet his Administration has taken more
steps to stymie job growth than to create jobs. The House has sent
hundreds of bills over to the Senate that would directly or indirectly
help job creation.
Finally, I want to say that the failures of Obamacare go beyond a
website that doesn't work. Here in Illinois, we are prime examples of
the fiasco of Obamacare - we have had thousands more people receive
cancellation notices from insurance companies than we have signed up on
the website.
Congressman Shimkus' guest at the State of the Union was Danville Mayor
Scott Eisenhauer. Danville is the largest city in the 15th
Congressional District.
Announcement
Valentines For Heroes: My office is again sponsoring "Valentines for
Heroes," a program where we collect valentines for distribution
throughout the region to veterans and those currently serving in the
military. This year, valentines will be accepted via mail or in person
at my district offices until Friday, February 7. The few basic rules to
follow are to return signed valentines without addressing them to a
specific person, without signing your last name or including your
address, and without sealing them in individual envelopes.

Farm
Bill
Featuring
Major
Policy
Reforms
Moves
Through
House
I supported
the
Agricultural
Act
of
2014,
the
farm
bill
conference
report. The
bill
passed
the
House
Wednesday
and
is
expected
to
pass
the
Senate
this
week
and
be
signed
into
law
by
the
President.
Important
farm
policy
reforms
in
the
legislation
include
repeal
of
Direct
Payments,
strengthening
of
crop
insurance,
consolidating
23
conservation
programs
into
13,
and
many
others.
One
of
the
major
reforms
is
in
the
food
stamp
program
(Supplemental
Nutrition
Assistance
Program
or
SNAP
&#8211;
in
Illinois,
Link),
and
$8
billion
in
savings
come
from
food
stamp
reforms. A
total
of
$23
billion is
saved
over
ten
years.
The
food
stamp
reforms
include
eliminating
the
LIHEAP
loophole,
prohibiting
advertising
and
enrollment
drives,
eliminating
medical
marijuana
as
an
eligible
expense,
and
allowing
states
to
pursue
fraud.
In
total,
four
current
commodity
programs
are
repealed. In
addition
to
Direct
Payments,
Counter-Cyclical
Payments,
Average
Crop
Revenue
Election
program,
and
Supplemental
Revenue
Assistance
Payments
will
end.
The
farm
bill
moves
toward
risk
management
by
encouraging
participation
in
the
Price
Loss
Coverage
and
Agriculture
Risk
Coverage
programs,
in
addition
to
crop
insurance.
Many
agriculture
groups
supported
the
bill,
including
American
Farm
Bureau
Federation,
American
Soybean
Association,
Illinois
Farm
Bureau,
National
Corn
Growers
Association,
and
National
Rural
Electric
Cooperative
Association.
A
Hands-On
Science
Lesson On
Thursday,
I
visited
the
St.
Louis
Science
Center,
where
I
was
given
a
tour
by Cindy
Encarnacion
of
the
hands-on
lab,
which
was
partially
funded
through
a
federal
grant.
The SLSC
currently
features
an
exhibit highlighting
all
sources
of
energy,
including
coal. The
main
purpose
of
my
visit
was
to
be
briefed
on
a
planned
agricultural
display
that
will
be
quite
impressive. Look
for
that
to
come
in
2015.
Propane
Costs
Are
Concern
for
Many
A fter
hearing
from
numerous
constituents
and
local
propane
dealers,
I
want
constituents
to
know
what
information
I
have
been
able
to
discover
about
the
problem.
Regarding
exports
&#8211;
According
to
the
National
Propane
Gas
Association,
since
2008
exports
of
propane
have
risen;
however,
U.S.
production
of
propane
has
also
increased
much
more
than
the
amount
of
those
exports
every
year,
except
for
a
small
difference
in
2013.
Regarding
pipelines
&#8211;
Central
and
southern
Illinois
propane
is
shipped
in
from
Kansas
via
the
Mid-American
Pipeline
and
other
pipelines
pass
through
the
15th
District. Although
two
other
pipelines
can
transport
propane
to
the
Kansas
hub
from
refineries,
one
pipeline
has
had
&#8220;capacity
constraints.&#8221;
Regarding
demand
&#8211;
The
economic
principle
of
supply
and
demand
is
also
playing
a
role
in
this
year&#8217;s
shortages. According
to
the
U.S.
Energy
Information
Administration,
the
region
Illinois
is
in
(which
also
includes
Wisconsin,
Michigan,
Indiana,
and
Ohio)
has
had
a
15
percent
increase
in
heating
degree
days
this
winter,
which
means
a
higher
demand
for
propane. This
was
the
largest
increase
outside
of
the
south. Additionally,
the
late
harvest
increased
use
in
drying
grain.
State
actions
&#8211;
Both
the
states
of
Illinois
and
Texas
have
lifted
some
restriction
on
truck
drivers
and
trucks
in
order
to
allow
for
more
propane
to
be
shipped
via
truck
to
areas
of
the
country
in
need.
Illinois
has
also
increased
LIHEAP
payments
by
$1,000
for
those
who
use
propane.
Assistance
&#8211;
Even
if
you
have
never
sought
assistance
for
heating
expense
before,
the
LIHEAP
program
does
exist. Income
levels
are
$16,
755
for
a
single
and
for
a
family
of
four
$34,575
in
order
to
qualify. Applications
are
made
at
local
community
action
agencies. For
more
information,
feel
free
to
contact
my
Maryville
office
at
618-288-7190.
Congress
doesn't
have
a
direct
role
in
solving
the
short-term
problems. I
am
signing
onto
a
letter
to
the
President
that
asks
him
to
do
anything
in
his
power
to
help. There
are
not
specific
requests
made,
but
this
will
bring
the
issue
to
his
attention
by
Members
of
Congress.
In
addition
I
voted
for
a
bill
that
the
House
passed
last
November
that
would
reform
the
process
for
the
permitting
of
natural
gas
pipelines. While
this
wouldn&#8217;t
help
immediately,
the
Senate
needs
to
take
up
the
bill
in
order
for
additional
pipelines
to
be
built.
I
wish
there
was
a
way
to
fix
the
problem
immediately,
but
from
the
information
we
have
been
given, there
is
no
quick
fix.
My
Comments
on
the
President's
State
of
the
Union
Speech
State
of
the
Union speeches
are
always
more
political
than
whoever
the
President
is
wants
to
make
it
seem. President
Obama
&#8211;
in
an
election
year
&#8211;
took
a
more
liberal,
activist
tone.
Promises
made
in
speeches
are
also
not
automatically
the
law
of
the
land. However,
President
Obama
wants
to
start
using
executive
authority
to
take
more
actions
without
Congress&#8217;
involvement. This
is
an
unprecedented
challenge
to
Congress
by
a
President.
While
the
President
talked
about
energy
security,
his
EPA
has
taken
several
steps
that
will
hinder
what
was
becoming
a
growing
coal
industry. I&#8217;m
afraid
of
what
his
pen
or
his
EPA
might
do
to
other
energy
issues
that
benefit
Illinois.
The
President
talked
about
jobs,
yet
his
Administration
has
taken
more
steps
to
stymie
job
growth
than
to
create
jobs. The
House
has
sent
hundreds
of
bills
over
to
the
Senate
that
would
directly
or
indirectly
help
job
creation.
Finally,
I
want
to
say
that
the
failures
of
Obamacare
go
beyond
a
website
that
doesn&#8217;t
work. Here
in
Illinois,
we
are
prime
examples
of
the
fiasco
of
Obamacare
&#8211;
we
have
had
thousands
more
people
receive
cancellation
notices
from
insurance
companies
than
we
have
signed
up
on
the
website.

Announcement
Valentines
For
Heroes:
My
office
is
again
sponsoring
&#8220;Valentines
for
Heroes,&#8221;
a
program
where
we collect
valentines
for
distribution
throughout

the
military.
This
year,
valentines
will
be
accepted
via

until
Friday,
February
7.
The
few
basic
rules
to
follow
are
to
return
signed
valentines
without
addressing
them
to
a
specific
person,
without
signing
your
last

or
including
your
address,
and
without
sealing
them
