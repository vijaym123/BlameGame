Friend,
Today is the day. The day of Boehner&#39;s arrival in Sacramento - AND WE AREN&#39;T READY FOR HIM.
That&#39;s because we&#39;re still $3,842 in the hole on our Emergency Boehner-is-coming Fund. Please, click below to donate $5 or more RIGHT NOW:
If you&#39;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Donate $5 to stop John Boehner and Doug Ose
Donate $25 to stop John Boehner and Doug Ose
Donate $50 to stop John Boehner and Doug Ose
Donate $100 to stop John Boehner and Doug Ose
Donate $250 to stop John Boehner and Doug Ose
Or donate another amount.
Today&#39;s joint Ose-Boehner lunch costs a whopping $1000 PER PLATE. If you want a photo with Boehner, that will cost you $2600. And to be a host and get your name on the invitation?
$10,000 dollars.
The amount of money Ose is going to raise today is STAGGERING.
And that money will be pumped directly into running negative attack ads against Ami.
It&#39;s possible that our message will be drowned out entirely.
We MUST build our reserves - or we will lose. Click here and give $5 or more right now.
Thanks,
Team Bera
PS - This Boehner event has changed our entire perspective - Doug Ose raising hundreds of thousands in one afternoon is a TERRIFYING thought, and it&#39;s probably exactly what&#39;s going to happen.
All our hard work could be undone in ONE DAY - and we could lose. Click here and give now.
