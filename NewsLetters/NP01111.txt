CONFIRMED: Social Security and Medicare are top Republicans targets.
David -- CONFIRMED: Social Security and Medicare are top Republican targets.
No fewer than THREE GOP presidential frontrunners announced their plans to cut Social Security and Medicare by raising the eligibility age.
CNN
reports that Jeb Bush said, &ldquo;I think we need to raise the retirement age...
And I think we need to do that in relatively short order.&rdquo;
This is outrageous -- they want to take away seniors&rsquo; hard-earned benefits, while profitable corporations get billions in tax breaks?!
Pitch in now to SAY NO and protect Social Security.
You can count on this: If the GOP wins the White House and the Senate, cutting Social Security and Medicare is exactly what they&rsquo;ll do.
There&rsquo;ll be no stopping them! So we must, must, MUST fight back now.
We need $300,000 in the next 48 hours to launch our Protect Social Security Project. Will you pitch in and be one of the founding supporters?
