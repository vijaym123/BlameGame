David -- I emailed you this afternoon.
Now, I&rsquo;m emailing you tonight.
I wouldn&rsquo;t email you twice in one day if I didn&rsquo;t need your urgent support. Here&rsquo;s the reason: Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s coming to Colona
tomorrow
to raise money for ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling.
That means starting Tuesday, Mr. Schilling will have the resources to hurl blistering attacks our way at a moment&rsquo;s notice.
David, we&rsquo;ve got to be prepared. My team tells me if we reach 200 online gifts before the big event, we&rsquo;ll be able to stay on track. Are you in?
