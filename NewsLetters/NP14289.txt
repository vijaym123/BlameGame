Dear Neighbor,
My annual Open Season Workshop to
assist federal employees and retirees in navigating through the many
changes in the 2014 Federal Employees Health Benefits Plans (FEHBP),
dental and vision insurance programs, and flexible spending accounts
will take place
Saturday, November 23, 2013 at the Fairfax County
Government Center.
The Government Center is located at 12000
Government Center Parkway, Fairfax, VA.
This years event
will once again feature FEHBP expert Walt Francis, along with
presentations by other FEHB experts. Representatives of the Office of
Personnel Management, Medicare, and the various FEHB plans will be available
to answer questions and discuss their programs with
participants.
This year, the Fairfax County Health Department will also be
offering flu shots for $25.00 and Medicare Part B is accepted. To ensure
that adequate supplies of the vaccine are available, please contact my
office at 703-256-3071 if you are planning to take advantage of this
opportunity.
Most FEHB plans have benefit and rate changes
for 2014, so it is important that federal employees and retirees know
how their current plans will change and whether or not another option
may better suit their needs.
Federal employees and
retirees, as well as survivors and former spouse annuitants, should make
sure they review their FEHB plan coverage and other benefits before
Open Season ends on December 9. Those who want to ask questions or make
sure that they have the coverage they need should plan to attend my
Open Season Workshop on November 23.
The federal
governments Open Season to change health plans and benefits runs from
November 11 to December
9.
This years workshop will feature:
10:00 am
11:00 am
Panel Discussion featuring experts on FEHB
programs and available health plan options, including FEHBP expert Walt
Francis.
Hosted in the Government
Center Board Room

pm
Representatives of various
FEHB health plans and Medicare will be available to provide
information and answer questions concerning plan offerings for
2014
