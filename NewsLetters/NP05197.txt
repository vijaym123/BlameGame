triple-match deadline: midnight
To keep our Democratic campaigns funded, we&rsquo;re triple-matching 1O,OOO gifts only before tonight&rsquo;s critical budget deadline. $$$ TRIPLE-MATCH DONATIONS REMAINING $$$
The good news just keeps on coming! FIRST:
A set of new polls showed Democrats aren&rsquo;t just holding our own&hellip; we can WIN! THEN:
We started seeing JAW-DROPPING results in races where no one gave us a chance. Get this: we can defeat Republicans in states like Nebraska, West Virginia, and Arkansas! AND HERE&rsquo;S THE BEST PART:
Some of our best supporters have stepped up to
TRIPLE-MATCH
up to 1O,OOO donations today.
We&rsquo;re getting down to the wire -- but if we can pull together 93O more donations, we can fight Boehner&rsquo;s attacks, expand our get-out-the-vote operations, and complete a brilliant comeback! David -- let&rsquo;s take full advantage of this opportunity! Can you chip in $5 or more before tonight&rsquo;s critical budget deadline?
YOUR DONATION WILL BE TRIPLE-MATCHED
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
The numbers are clear: all of our hard work registering voters, knocking on doors, and talking to our neighbors is paying off!
Our local community organizers have already reached out to over 2O million(!) voters. And guess what? When we remind voters that the Republicans are bought-and-paid-for by billionaires and corporate special interests, voters flock our way.
We don&rsquo;t want to overstate things -- the race for Congress is still a dead-heat. We still have Democratic campaigns getting pummeled by Obama-bashing attacks. But if we can expand our get-out-the-vote program, we can tip too-close-to-call races in our direction.
What do you say, David? Can you chip in a few bucks? https://secure.dccc.org/Critical-Deadline
