Dear Friends,
Last week Speaker Boehner announced the formation of a House Select
Committee to investigate the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks. I applaud
the Speaker for officially calling for a formal investigation into the
White House's response to the events of September 11, 2012 in Benghazi.
The attack on our diplomatic post in Libya was not sparked by a video.
Though individuals attempted to dupe the American people into believing
the mob was retaliating in response to the video, it was a terrorist
attack, plain and simple.
To this day, no one has been brought to
justice, and those truly responsible for the safety of our mission in
Libya have not been held accountable for the deaths of four Americans;
four deaths that never should have happened.
Individuals in the State Department and the Administration must be held
responsible for their inaction and the lack of security authorized to
protect that compound. Lastly and more importantly, we must and will
track down the perpetrators of this crime and bring them to justice for
the murder of our fellow American citizens.
Supporting Our Veterans And Active Duty Military
Last Wednesday, I voted for the bi-partisan H.R. 4486 - the Fiscal Year
2015 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill.
The primary duty of Congress is to provide for the common defense of
our great country. As members of Congress we also have an obligation to
care for those brave men and women who are serving and have served in
harm's way. This bill will make sure our active duty military has the
resources and training they need to preform their mission. It will also
take care of the warfighter who has sacrificed so much and served their
country with honor.
The bill provides $71.5 billion in discretionary funding a cut of $1.8
billion below the fiscal year 2014 level. This reduction is largely due
to a lack of new need for military construction projects, while
increasing funding for veterans programs by $1.5 billion.
$6.6 billion for military construction projects - family
housing, medical units, and education and training facilities.
$64.7 billion in discretionary funding for Department of
Veterans Affairs. Of that $45 billion goes towards VA medical services -
mental health care, suicide prevention, rural health initiatives,
homeless veterans treatment, and job training.
Bill will also provide increased funding for claims processing,
continuing oversight requirements that benchmark progress on the
backlog, and places conditions on funding for the modernization of the
VA health record system.
Thank you for taking the time to read this newsletter and I look
forward to talking to you next week.
Sincerely,
Ted

From
The
Desk
Of
Congressman
Yoho
Dear
Friends,
Last
week
Speaker
Boehner
announced
the
formation
of
a
House
Select
Committee
to
investigate
the
2012
Benghazi
terrorist
attacks.
I
applaud
the
Speaker
for
officially
calling
for
a
formal
investigation
into
the
White
House&#8217;s
response
to
the
events
of
September
11,
2012
in
Benghazi.
The
attack
on
our
diplomatic
post
in
Libya
was
not
sparked
by
a
video.
Though
individuals
attempted
to
dupe
the
American
people
into
believing
the
mob
was
retaliating
in
response
to
the
video,
it
was
a
terrorist
attack,
plain
and
simple.
To
this
day,
no
one
has
been
brought
to
justice,
and
those
truly
responsible
for
the
safety
of
our
mission
in
Libya
have
not
been
held
accountable
for
the
deaths
of
four
Americans;
four
deaths
that
never
should
have
happened.
Individuals
in
the
State
Department
and
the
Administration
must
be
held
responsible
for
their
inaction
and
the
lack
of
security
authorized
to
protect
that
compound.
Lastly
and
more
importantly,
we
must
and
will
track
down
the
perpetrators
of
this
crime
and
bring
them
to
justice
for
the
murder
of
our
fellow
American
citizens.
Supporting
Our
Veterans
And
Active
Duty
Military
Last
Wednesday,
I
voted
for
the
bi-partisan
H.R.
4486
-
the Fiscal
Year 2015
Military
Construction
and
Veterans
Affairs
Appropriations
bill.
The
primary
duty
of
Congress
is
to
provide
for
the
common
defense
of
our
great
country.
As
members
of
Congress
we
also
have
an
obligation
to
care
for
those
brave
men
and
women
who
are
serving
and
have
served
in
harm&#8217;s
way.
This
bill
will
make
sure
our
active
duty
military
has
the
resources
and
training
they
need
to
preform
their
mission.
It
will
also
take
care
of
the
warfighter
who
has
sacrificed
so
much
and
served
their
country
with
honor.
The
bill
provides
$71.5
billion
in
discretionary
funding
a
cut
of
$1.8
billion
below
the
fiscal
year
2014
level.
This
reduction
is
largely
due
to
a
lack
of
new
need
for
military
construction
projects,
while
increasing
funding
for
veterans
programs
by
$1.5
billion.
&#183;
$6.6
billion
for
military
construction
projects
&#8211;
family
housing,
medical
units,
and
education
and
training
facilities.
&#183;
$64.7
billion
in
discretionary
funding
for
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs.
Of
that
$45
billion
goes
towards
VA
medical
services
&#8211;
mental
health
care,
suicide
prevention,
rural
health
initiatives,
homeless
veterans
treatment,
and
job
training.
&#183;
Bill
will
also
provide
increased
funding
for
claims
processing,
continuing
oversight
requirements
that
benchmark
progress
on
the
backlog,
and
places
conditions
on
funding
for
the
modernization
of
the
VA
health
record
system.
Thank
you
for
taking
the
time
to
read
this
newsletter
and
I
look
forward
to
talking
to
you
next
week.
Sincerely,
Ted
