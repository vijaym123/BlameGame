Enhancing America's Fire Safety
Sen. Pat Toomey with Rep. Pat Meehan at Centre Square Fire Co. in Montgomery County
Every year in America, more than 3,000 people die in fires. Additionally, roughly 100 firefighters lose their lives each year in the line of duty. Modern sprinkler systems are one of the most effective ways to combat fire hazards. Currently, our complex tax code makes it more difficult for building owners to install these state-of-the-art safety systems.
That's why I have joined Sens. Tom Carper (D-Del.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) in supporting the
bipartisan Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act , which encourages commercial building owners to invest in life-saving fire safety upgrades. I am proud to have the support of Philadelphia's Sprinkler Fitters Local 692 on this important bill:
"We commend Sen. Toomey for his support of the Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act. This is a commonsense, bipartisan piece of legislation that will save lives and properties by strengthening tax incentives for the installation of fire sprinkler retrofits. We look forward to working with Sen. Toomey on its passage." -
Wayne Miller, Business Manager, Sprinkler Fitters Local 692.

Honoring The Fallen
When our veterans pass, they should be honored in a way that reflects the bravery and sacrifice they showed in defending our country.
With this in mind, I believe Congress needs to learn more about the VA's processes to recover veterans' cremated, unclaimed remains and develop an action plan to help resolve this issue that is so important for our veterans' community.
I have introduced a measure to do just that, and I am honored to have the support of the highly respected
Missing in America Project (MIAP)
in this effort:
"I applaud Sen. Toomey's efforts through this legislation to help not only the MIAP mission, but also help to assure that our veterans, their spouses, and their dependents receive a proper burial."
- Lanny Golden, MIAP Assistant Pennsylvania State Coordinator.

It was my pleasure to host
Delaware County Christian School's

The students had terrific questions about tax reform and Social Security.
