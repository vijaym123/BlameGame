Rep. Bruce Braley -- Iowa's First
District
David,
>From helping small businesses in our region to making sure Iowa workers
are getting a fair shake, I've been working hard over the last few
months for you, your neighbors, and folks across Iowa. Here's a quick
update on some of the work I've been doing -- so please enjoy!
Restoring the Minimum Wage
Bruce Braley, Senator Harkin, and Labor Sec. Perez visit
RAYGUN
While Congress debates restoring the federal minimum wage, I'm making
it a priority to listen to both workers and small business owners to
learn how restoring the minimum wage would impact their lives.
So, this month Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, Senator Harkin, and I
visited RAYGUN, a screen-printing company based in Des Moines that is
vocal about the benefits of higher wages. The owners at RAYGUN believe
that higher wages help build a strong workforce and profitability in
the long run, while putting more money into the hands of workers who
spend it in the local economy.
I agree, and that's why I've called on Speaker John Boehner
to bring legislation to the floor for a vote to restore
the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour.
An extra dollar or two an hour is a life-changing amount to the 300,000
Iowans who would see a raise if this law passed - it's time we did the
right thing.

Supporting Iowa Businesses
Bruce Braley meets with Marshalltown community
leaders
It's so important to hear straight from community leaders about what
policies are working for Iowa businesses.
That's why earlier this week I had the great opportunity to meet with
business and city leaders from Marshalltown. We discussed critical
issues to their community, including education, healthcare, important
tax credits, and the meat packing plants in the area.
Marshalltown is a important part of Iowa's economy, and I commend these
outstanding local leaders who are working together to create jobs and
grow the Marshalltown economy.

Making Adoptions Easier
Watch the video!
Deciding to adopt a child is one of the most compassionate decisions a
couple can make. But couples who try to adopt children overseas can
sometimes face difficult and frustrating hurdles during the adoption
process.
The Peats are one such couple from Dubuque who have been dealing with
bureaucratic red tape as they try to adopt two children from the
Democratic Republic of Congo. Upon learning of their troubles, I wrote
Secretary of State John Kerry, urging the State Department to work with
the Congolese government to resolve the situation.
The Peats and other Iowa families have jumped through so many obstacles
in order to provide a child with a loving home-and what's happening to
them isn't fair.
I'm hopeful the State Department can help finalize these adoptions and
end this foot-dragging by the DRC that's causing families like the
Peats so much pain.
Watch a short news clip from WHO highlighting the Peat's story here.

David,
From
helping
small
businesses
in
our
region
to
making
sure
Iowa
workers
are
getting
a
fair
shake,
I've
been
working
hard
over
the
last
few
months
for
you,
your
neighbors,
and
folks
across
Iowa.
Here's
a
quick
update
on
some
of
the
work
I've
been
doing
--
so
please
enjoy!
Restoring
the
Minimum
Wage
While
Congress
debates
restoring
the
federal
minimum
wage,
I'm
making
it
a
priority
to
listen
to
both
workers
and
small
business
owners
to
learn
how
restoring
the
minimum
wage
would
impact
their
lives.
So,
this
month
Labor
Secretary
Thomas
Perez,
Senator
Harkin,
and
I
visited
RAYGUN,
a
screen-printing
company
based
in
Des
Moines
that
is
vocal
about
the
benefits
of
higher
wages.
The
owners
at
RAYGUN
believe
that
higher
wages
help
build
a
strong
workforce
and
profitability
in
the
long
run,
while
putting
more
money
into
the
hands
of
workers
who
spend
it
in
the
local
economy.
I
agree,
and
that's
why
I've
called
on
Speaker
John
Boehner
to
bring
legislation
to
the
floor
for
a
vote
to
restore
the
minimum
wage
to
$10.10
an
hour.
An
extra
dollar
or
two
an
hour
is
a
life-changing
amount
to
the
300,000
Iowans
who
would
see
a
raise
if
this
law
passed
&#8212;
it&#8217;s
time
we
did
the
right
thing.
Supporting
Iowa
Businesses
It's
so
important
to
hear
straight
from
community
leaders
about
what
policies
are
working
for
Iowa
businesses.
That's
why
earlier
this
week
I
had
the
great
opportunity
to
meet
with
business
and
city
leaders
from
Marshalltown.
We
discussed
critical
issues
to
their
community,
including
education,
healthcare,
important
tax
credits,
and
the
meat
packing
plants
in
the
area.
Marshalltown
is
a
important
part
of
Iowa&#8217;s
economy,
and
I
commend
these
outstanding
local
leaders
who
are
working
together
to
create
jobs
and
grow
the
Marshalltown
economy.

Making
Adoptions
Easier
Deciding
to
adopt
a
child
is
one
of
the
most
compassionate
decisions
a
couple
can
make.
But
couples
who
try
to
adopt
children
overseas
can
sometimes
face
difficult
and
frustrating
hurdles
during
the
adoption
process.
The
Peats
are
one
such
couple
from
Dubuque
who
have
been
dealing
with
bureaucratic
red
tape
as
they
try
to
adopt
two
children
from
the
Democratic
Republic
of
Congo.
Upon
learning
of
their
troubles,
I
wrote
Secretary
of
State
John
Kerry,
urging
the
State
Department
to
work
with
the
Congolese
government
to
resolve
the
situation.
The
Peats
and
other
Iowa
families
have
jumped
through
so
many
obstacles
in
order
to
provide
a
child
with
a
loving
home&#8212;and
what&#8217;s
happening
to
them
isn&#8217;t
fair.
I&#8217;m
hopeful
the
State
Department
can
help
finalize
these
adoptions
and
end
this
foot-dragging
by
the
DRC
that&#8217;s
causing
families
like
the
Peats
so
much
pain.

As
always,
if
you
ever
have
questions,
concerns,
or
need
help
with
a
federal
agency,
please

not

All
the

Bruce
