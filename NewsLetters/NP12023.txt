Forbes: DoD Should be Unequivocal In Its
Support for an 11 Carrier Fleet
Washington, D.C. - Congressman J. Randy Forbes (VA-04), Chairman of the House Armed Services Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, released a statement on Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel's announcement that the USS George Washington (CVN-73) will not receive funding this year for its required refueling and complex overhaul:
At a time when American interests are being challenged around the world, the Secretary of Defense should be sending an unequivocal message to our competitors and allies that he supports a fleet of 11 carriers. While Secretary Hagel claimed today that a decision has not been made to reduce the fleet to 10 carriers, all the decisions now being made at the Pentagon appear to lay the groundwork to do just that. In short, cancelling funding for the USS George Washington's required overhaul will be equivalent to abandoning a ship for which the taxpayers have already paid, when it still has decades of service life left, placing a further burden on our servicemembers who will have to deploy for up to 10 month in the future, and leave the Nation less capable of responding to a crisis where and when it matters most.
