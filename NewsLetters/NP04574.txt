President Obama's Greenhouse
Deal Is Economically
Irresponsible
11/12/14
Following the news of a new climate change agreement with China, Congressman
Doug Lamborn released the following
statement:
" It is economically irresponsible as well as dismissive of
the Congressional treaty process for President Obama to be engaging in
one-man energy diplomacy with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Arbitrary
restrictions on carbon emissions by the U .S. will increase the cost of electricity generation and will
lead to the downsizing of thousands of American jobs. It makes no sense
whatsoever for President Obama to attempt to mandate crippling new
restrictions on American energy, all while agreeing to ignore over a
decade of unlimited Chinese energy production in the
future."
