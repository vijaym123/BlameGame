Dear David,
Today, I write to
inform you that House rules preclude Members of Congress from sending
their constituents regular updates from 90 days prior to an election
until after the election unless they have opted in to the updates.
Because of that, if you would like to receive regular updates from my
office between August 6 and November 4, you can only do so by clicking
on the button below.
If you would like to stay informed
about how I am advocating for you in Congress over the next few months,
please do so by clicking on the button below.
It is my honor
to serve you.
Sincerely,
JULIA BROWNLEY
Member of Congress
