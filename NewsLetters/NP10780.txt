One-hundred thirty. That's the number of teachers across America who have been arrested for sexual misconduct with a student since January 1. It's more than one teacher for each day of the year so far.
Enough is enough.
It is time for the Senate to pass my bipartisan
Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act
and crack down on those who prey on children.
As the father of three young children, I cannot imagine the pain of a parent whose child has been sexually abused. As your U.S. senator, I am dedicated to strengthening laws to better protect kids - in Pennsylvania and across our country.
The House of Representatives passed this legislation unanimously. It's time for the Senate to do the same.

Standing Up For PA Farmers:
Opposing The EPA's Power Grab
Watch video
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) wants to expand its authority over "navigable waterways" to include puddles and areas of run off. If enacted, this would subject farmers, families - really anyone with water on their property - to EPA regulation.
This is ridiculous. And it won't do.
I have
sent a letter
to EPA administrator Gina McCarthy pointing out the dubious legal and scientific basis for the proposed rule and asking for the maximum comment period to hear from affected Americans. To submit a comment, please contact
OW-Docket@EPA.gov
with the subject line EPA-HQ-OW-2011-0880. Let them hear from you!
I am also pleased to have the support of the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau and Pennsylvania Builders Association. Both have spoken out against this power grab.

Working To Fix Our Veterans Backlog
Did you know 55 percent of VA claims nationwide remain backlogged? Or that backlog levels in the VA's Philadelphia and Pittsburgh offices are nearly 60 percent?
That's why I'm supporting a bipartisan measure to streamline the cumbersome application process a veteran is required to navigate when filing a benefits claim.
With Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), I'm working to help ensure our veterans receive the help they have earned through the
21st Century Veterans Benefits Delivery Act . This bill will establish new tools to hold VA regional offices accountable for their performance and identify measures to address inadequate performance.
As a member of the Senate VA Backlog Working Group, I look forward to working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to help resolve this critical and longstanding issue.
