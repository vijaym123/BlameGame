LEGISLATION
Dear David,
The Constitution and the separation of powers are unique and
integral to American democracy. Congress passes the laws, and the
President must faithfully execute them
these are enumerated powers in
the Constitution. While the power of the Executive branch has been
encroaching into the realm of the Legislative branch for decades, President
Obama has taken this to new extremes. President Obama has all but
admitted this himself, when he said he would govern with a pen and a
phone. A pen and a phone is not the way democracy in America was
designed.
President Obama has waived statutorily required
deadlines in legislation and has blatantly dismissed laws and the legislative
intent of this and past Congresses. President Obama
has:
delayed the employer mandate, despite a
date
being
specifically included in legislation;
delayed
a number of other statutory requirements in the Affordable
Care Act, better known as Obamacare;
refused to enforce
current immigration laws; and
waived work requirements
for welfare, originally passed via a bipartisan agreement in
1996.
In response, the House of Representatives this week
passed two
bipartisan
bills to rein in the Obama
Administrations executive actions. The first is H.R. 4138, the Executive
Needs to Faithfully Observe and Respect Congressional Enactments of the
Law
or ENFORCE
Act. The ENFORCE Act establishes procedures that
would allow the House or Senate to file a lawsuit against the Executive
branch for not faithfully executing the laws. HR 4138 ensures this
lawsuit will be expedited, and first heard by a panel of three federal
judges. This bill provides the Legislative branch with a mechanism to
ensure the intent of the laws Congress passes is adhered to and the law
is executed faithfully. H.R. 3973, the Faithful Execution of the Law
Act, would require any federal official to provide their reasons for not
enforcing a law. Reports right now are only required when the
Department of Justice refuses to enforce a law because of Constitutional
concerns. Any federal official who chooses to ignore laws duly passed by
Congress for any reason ought to be required to explain
themselves.
Executive overreach is not a Republican or a Democrat issue
this is a Constitutional issue. The fundamentals of American democracy
are based upon a separation of powers. These principles must be
preserved, lest personal liberty and freedom be tossed to the wayside.
Today, I acted to preserve the Constitution and the American
way.
Sincerely,
Gus Bilirakis
Member of
Congress
