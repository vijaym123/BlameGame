News from Representative Dan Kildee
Dear ,
This week, I'm continuing to push for a vote in the House to extend
emergency unemployment benefits for the now 2.6 million people who have
lost this vital economic lifeline since it expired due to congressional
inaction on December 28, 2013.
Monday, I joined jobless Americans at the U.S. Capitol
as they told their personal stories of
being unemployed and actively looking for work. Their stories of
struggle and hardship were heartbreaking, but they should compel the
House to act immediately.
I
also spoke on
the House floor yesterday
and shared
more personal stories that were recently sent to me. By the end of May,
2.8 million Americans stand to lose everything they have worked their
entire lives for because of inaction in the House. That's wrong, and
it's unacceptable.
The Senate already acted last month in a bipartisan fashion and the
House needs to follow suit. Just hours after the Senate passed a bill
to retroactively extend the expired benefits, I introduced H.R. 4415 in
the House
. This bill has been cosponsored by over
150 Members of Congress and has bipartisan support. All we need now is
a vote.
Unfortunately, House Republican leadership continues to block a vote on
my legislation. Meanwhile, 2.6 million Americans have lost their
benefits, struggling to put food on the table for their families and
pay their bills as they search for their next job.
On average, it takes a person 37 weeks to find work. Yet in my home
state, Michigan, state unemployment benefits expire after just 20
weeks. These emergency benefits help unemployed Americans looking for
work transition to their next job. They aren't a handout - they are a
vital economic lifeline as they get back on their feet and find work.
My constituents and the American people deserve an up-or-down vote to
restore emergency unemployment benefits. I wholeheartedly believe that
if a vote was allowed by the House Republican leadership, it would
pass. Every day we fail to take a vote, more people lose this vital
economic lifeline.

Dear
,
T his
week,
I&#8217;m
continuing
to
push
for
a
vote
in
the
House
to
extend
emergency
unemployment
benefits
for
the
now
2.6
million
people
who
have
lost
this
vital
economic
lifeline
since
it
expired
due
to
congressional
inaction
on
December
28,
2013.
Monday,
I
joined
jobless
Americans
at
the
U.S.
Capitol
as
they
told
their
personal
stories
of
being
unemployed
and
actively
looking
for
work.
Their
stories
of
struggle
and
hardship
were
heartbreaking,
but
they
should
compel
the
House
to
act
immediately.
I
also
spoke
on
the
House
floor
yesterday
and
shared
more
personal
stories
that
were
recently
sent
to
me.
By
the
end
of
May,
2.8
million
Americans
stand
to
lose
everything
they
have
worked
their
entire
lives
for
because
of
inaction
in
the
House.
That&#8217;s
wrong,
and
it&#8217;s
unacceptable.
The
Senate
already
acted
last
month in
a
bipartisan
fashion
and
the
House
needs
to
follow
suit.
Just
hours
after
the
Senate
passed
a
bill
to
retroactively
extend
the
expired
benefits ,
I
introduced
H.R.
4415
in
the
House .
This
bill
has
been
cosponsored
by
over
150
Members
of
Congress
and
has
bipartisan
support.
All
we
need
now
is
a
vote.
Unfortunately,
House
Republican
leadership
continues
to
block
a
vote
on
my
legislation.
Meanwhile,
2.6
million
Americans
have
lost
their
benefits,
struggling
to
put
food
on
the
table
for
their
families
and
pay
their

as
they
search
for
their
next
job.
On
average,
it
takes
a
person
37
weeks
to
find
work.
Yet
in
my
home
state,
Michigan,
state
unemployment
benefits
expire
after
just
20
weeks.
These
emergency
benefits
help
unemployed
Americans
looking
for
work
transition
to
their
next
job.
They
aren&#8217;t
a
handout
&#8211;
they
are
a
vital
economic
lifeline
as
they
get
back
on
their
feet
and
find
work.
My
constituents
and
the
American
people
deserve
an
up-or-down
vote
to
restore
emergency
unemployment
benefits.
I
wholeheartedly
believe
that
if
a
vote
was
allowed
by
the
House
Republican
leadership,
it
would
pass.
Every
day
we
fail
to
take
a
vote,
more
people
lose
this
vital
economic
lifeline.
