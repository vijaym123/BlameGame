Dear David,
Every year, more than two million Americans get
sick and at least 23,000 die from antibiotic-resistant infections:
infections that are becoming increasingly difficult or entirely impossible
to cure.
Antibiotics are not like other drugs: the more we
use them, the less effective they become, and were using them at an
irresponsible and horrifying speed. Antibiotics are the most precious
medical advancement in history, and we are squandering them: eighty
percent of antibiotics sold in this country are fed to livestock on
factory farms.
But how does this impact you? The Environmental
Working Group found that 39% of chicken breasts, wings, and thighs; 55%
of ground beef; 69% of pork chops; and 81% of ground turkey in our
nations grocery stores had antibiotic-resistant bacteria in them. And
this bacteria could make you sick.
Thats why today Im
reintroducing the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act, or
PAMTA. PAMTA would preserve eight classes of medically necessary
antibiotics for use in sick humans and animals, and along with enforcement
mechanisms, dramatically cut back on the amount of antibiotics that
are used in this country.
To highlight my bill, I joined
Wegmans and Rochester Institute of Technology for a showing of
Resistance, a documentary exploring the dangers of antibiotic resistance. I
also stood with local Rochester doctors and medical experts to discuss
how this problem impacts doctors, hospitals, and your
health.
Congresswoman Louise Slaughter stands with local
Rochester doctors and hospital leaders to discuss her bill, the
Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment
Act.
The Democrat and
Chronicle
came out in strong support of m y bill and said,
If
antibiotics stop working, we won't be able to treat ordinary troubles
like strep throat and ear infections, letalone more serious infectious
diseases. Neosporin won't help heal our scraped knees. Surgeries will
be significantly more risky, as will treatments such as chemotherapy
and dialysis. Organ transplants will be impossible. The CDC named
antibiotic resistance as one of the top five health threats in our country
last year. This is real, folks.
Theyre
right.
Rest assured: Im going to keep this fight going until my bill passes
and becomes law. Weve reached a tipping point, and theres no going
back.
