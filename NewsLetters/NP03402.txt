Dear
David,
As you
know, President Obama will speak directly to Congress and the nation
tonight in his annual State of the Union address. While I am expecting
specific plans to be discussed
middle class tax breaks, the
availability of higher education, and paid sick leave
these sit under an
overarching theme: creating an economy that works for everyone. I hope
Congress will take note of this theme and work together to pursue this
worthy goal throughout the year.
Since our economy and the stock market collapsed in 2008, we have seen a
very slow - but steady - recovery. Our nations economy has slowly
improved over the past few years, in the big picture, but too many
families are still struggling or not feeling the effects of this recovery.
Although we have seen record highs in the stock market, record lows in
the nations uninsured rate, and 58 straight months of private sector
job growth, the middle class and those working to entire it continue
to struggle.
What I hope to hear from the
President tonight is a real plan to raise wages for those who drive
our economy, the strongest force the world has ever known
the American
middle class. And after that plan is revealed, I hope Congress takes
an active role in putting aside our differences and finding common
ground to turn elements of that plan into
reality.
Wall Street has enough people and special interests taking care
of its needs. Its time the rest of us are heard as well. I will
continue to champion an economy that works for everyone, and I stand ready
to defend the financial stability of working families. That means
focusing on policies that empower Main Street, not Wall
Street.
What do you hope to hear from the President
tonight? What are your priorities for Congress to tackle in 2015?
Let me know by connecting with me on
Facebook .
If my office can be of service to
you or someone you know, please dont hesitate to
give me a call . My door is always
open.
Thanks, as always, for reading,
