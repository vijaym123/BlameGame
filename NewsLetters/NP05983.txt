24 HOUR DEADLINE: All Gifts TRIPLE-MATCHED
President Obama, Joe Biden, and Hillary Clinton asked for your help. Now for the last 24-hours before the critial FEC deadline, all donations are
TRIPLE-MATCHED.
David, we've tried everything.
If we had the time, maybe we could go back to the drawing board.
But there's no time -- we have less than 24 hours before Boehner launches his gargantuan $6 million ad blitz to smear Democrats.
If we can't find a way to fight back by tomorrow's quarterly fundraising deadline, the Republicans will say that we&rsquo;ve given up on this election.
And the truth is, they&rsquo;ll be right.
We need 28,OOO supporters to step up to keep that from happening. And we've identified zip code 60659 as one of our hotbeds of grassroots energy. Can you pitch in $5 right now?
