I know we&rsquo;re just a few days out from a down-to-the-wire election that will have major consequences for our future -- but try to forget about all the politics for a second. Instead, try to remember why you became a Democrat in the first place .
If you&rsquo;re like me, it&rsquo;s because you believe that we&rsquo;re all in this together, and that we all have a responsibility to each other and to something bigger than ourselves.
You believe that our elections should be decided by the people -- not by a flood of unaccountable outside money.
You believe that men and women should be paid the same amount for the same work and that no one who puts in a hard day&rsquo;s work should live in poverty.
You believe that our economy and our democracy should work for everyone.
You believe that we should strive for a world where every child grows up with a fair shot at the American Dream.
So David, it&rsquo;s time to put those beliefs into action. Will you donate $5 or more to support our Democratic campaigns in this final week of the election? Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
I know you&rsquo;re sick of emails asking you for money. But I&rsquo;m telling you: this is important.
We have some great Democratic campaigns out there fighting for the values we share -- they will make you proud. But with just 5 days until the election, they&rsquo;re fending off some pretty ugly attacks from the other side.
And here&rsquo;s the kicker: each and every one of these elections is too-close-to-call. That means our efforts in these final days to get out our Democratic message -- and most importantly, get out our Democratic voters -- will make all the difference. If you&rsquo;ve been waiting for the right time to give, this is it. Please chip in whatever you can today. https://secure.dccc.org/Chip-In
