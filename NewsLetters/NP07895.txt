Over the past few weeks, I have been able to focus on issues both in New Jersey and in Washington. Specifically, in the District, I toured the rehabilitation work being done at Ellis Island and Liberty State
Park and attended the unveiling of the 14th Street Viaduct, and in Washington, voted on key pieces of legislation and participated in a Foreign Affairs Committee hearing.
I had the pleasure of touring Ellis Island and Liberty State Park with John Piltzecker, the Superintendent of Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty National Monument as well as Robert Rodriguez, the Superintendent
of Liberty State Park. We discussed the recovery efforts on the Island after the extensive damage from Hurricane Sandy and viewed the state of the utility bridge connecting Ellis Island to Liberty State Park. It was enlightening to tour the important rehabilitation
work being done in response to flood damage. Ellis Island served as a beacon of hope for a better life for the 12 million immigrants who passed through its halls from 1892 to 1954, and is it a proud part of New Jersey&#8217;s 8th district.
I was also honored to receive the New Jersey Legislator of the Year Award at the 2014 Jewish War Veterans of New Jersey Conference, which highlighted my positive voting record when it comes to veterans&#8217; rights.
I met with Harry Ettlinger, one of the original Monuments Men from World War II, as well as additional members of the Jewish War Veterans of America &#8211; NJ Chapter.
We must continue to fight for our veterans; they deserve the highest quality of care we can provide.
I then gave a speech at the ribbon-cutting event for the replacement of the 14th Street Viaduct alongside Senator Menendez and Senator Booker, Mayors Zimmer, Fullop, and Stack, as well as County Executive
DeGise. The new Viaduct connects Hoboken to Union City and Jersey City and will provide a new walk-able public space. This project is an example of a smart way to improve our aging infrastructure in a manner that is beneficial for local residents as well as
commuters.
Last week in Washington, I also attended a Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on the current human rights situation in Southeast Asia, specifically Vietnam, Burma, Cambodia, the Philippines, and Laos. With
a diverse region of 620 million people, a wide range of political systems, and drastically different levels of economic development, deep disparities in human rights conditions are prevalent. Our U.S. policies must aim to support democratic states in the region
with institutions that deliver effective governance.
In an encouraging sign of bipartisanship, I joined various colleagues in the House of Representatives in passing H.R. 803, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, which will improve the workforce development
system and help put Americans back to work by creating employment, education, training, and support services for job seekers and workers. This bill will provide individuals, including those with disabilities, the opportunities needed to acquire the skills
necessary to succeed in the workforce and will help connect job training programs to long-term employment opportunities.
H.R. 803 was passed in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, and currently awaits the President&#8217;s signature.
Finally, I joined my colleagues on the Congressional Hispanic Caucus at a press conference to discuss the recent surge of unaccompanied children along our southern border. With more than 52,000 children fleeing
extreme violence in their home countries, this growing humanitarian crisis requires bold and immediate action from both sides of the aisle.
I recently wrote to the Ambassadors of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, urging these countries to find solutions to this growing humanitarian crisis, provide a safe environment for these children, and address the underpinnings
of what is compelling these young children to abandon their homelands and risk their lives to come to the United States.
