Dear Friends,
I dont think I can
improve on last years Easter newsletter, so I am sharing those words
again. This year the Christian Good Friday coincides with the beginning of
Jewish Passover, which continues for eight days through April
11.
Every year, on Easter, Christians gather with friends and
family to celebrate a tradition that spans 2,000 years; we recognize a
divine act of love that inspires millions of Americans and billions of
people around the world; and we humbly accept a gift from God that is
not only the foundation of Christianity, but whose symbol of sacrifice
and rebirth is a reminder to people of all faiths that Providence has
bestowed countless gifts upon us.
This Sunday, I will be
celebrating Easter with my children and my wife, Becca, at her
familys home. We will be reflecting on the many blessings we enjoy and
honoring the significance of this amazing day. Although its easy to
dismiss the commercialized aspects of the Easter season, we must always
remember that what makes Easter special is a unique and supreme sacrifice
the sacrifice of our Lord and Savior and the joy of His
resurrection.
A similar tradition of sacrifice and gratitude runs
through the Jewish Passover as well. While we live in a diverse nation,
I am always impressed by the fact we are united, as Americans, in our
respect and tolerance for the many faiths that make up our great
country.
We are truly blessed to live in a nation that honors
freedom of religion. Indeed, its one of the foundational principles
of our country. Every person
in America and throughout the world
has a basic human right to practice their faith without fear of
government interference. That right has been cherished throughout American
history, and we must never take it for granted.
As
Christians remember the sacrifice of the Son of God, we must never forget those
brave men and women who are sacrificing for us on the frontlines of
freedom. Please take time this weekend to reflect on our heroes in
uniform who are risking their lives to protect us, far from their
families. And never forget those heroes who have given their lives in the
service of our nation.
Greater love hath no man than this,
that a man lay down his life for his friends. John 15:13
Thank
you ,
