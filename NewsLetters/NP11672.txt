Dear Friend,
This week, the House has addressed a number of issues. Among them, the
growing uncertainty of the situation in Ukraine and high energy prices
here in Missouri. This week also brought an unveiling of the President's
Fiscal Year 2015 budget. The House also worked to address concerns over
the Obamacare penalty taxes set to take effect this year.
As you may know, Russia sent troops to the Crimea region of Ukraine,
violating Ukraine's national sovereignty. In response, many options are
being discussed here in Washington and with our allies and partners
abroad. This week, the House took action to condemn this act of
aggression by Russia and provide support for the government of Ukraine.
One action that the President has advanced is to provide loan
guarantees for Ukraine so that they would not have to rely on Russian
energy. The House passed H.R. 4152 this week, which would ensure any
funds would come from existing appropriations rather than from future
spending. This helps to accomplish the U.S. objective of assisting the
Ukrainian people, without increasing future spending. It is important
that we send a clear signal to Russia that its violation of the
sovereignty of Ukraine is not acceptable, and the international
community will ensure there are consequences.
On another matter, many Missourians and people throughout the country
have been affected by a shortage of propane used to heat their homes.
Missourians have seen dramatic spikes in the cost of propane. This
week, the House took action to help ease the propane shortage, and to
lower energy costs in the long term. The House passed the Home Heating
Energy Assistance Through Transportation (HHEATT) Act. Due to the
ongoing propane shortage, the Department of Transportation has granted
temporary hours of service waivers. This would allow truckers to drive
for longer hours, speeding up deliveries of much-needed propane.
However, these waivers have been extended multiple times, creating
uncertainty. The HHEATT Act would extend the waivers until May 31,
2014, unless a state governor decides that the need for additional
propane has been met in their state. I am proud to be a cosponsor of
this legislation, and I hope the Senate will take quick action to
provide this much-needed relief.
This week, the President unveiled his Fiscal Year 2015 budget. The
House Budget Committee, on which I serve, held hearings on the budget
to analyze what its impact on the country would be. I am disappointed
that the President's budget fails to get us on a path to fiscal
responsibility. His budget raises taxes, increases the national debt by
$8.3 trillion, and never balances.
The President's budget does nothing to take on our entitlement crisis
and does nothing to provide solutions to the problems facing today's
senior citizens and tomorrow's generations. As a member of the House
Budget Committee, I am committed to finding well thought out reforms to
protect and preserve Social Security and Medicare for generations to
come.
On another matter, the House took action this week to delay
implementation of penalties for failure to comply with the provisions
of the President's health care law. My colleagues and I passed the
Suspending the Individual Mandate Penalty Law Equals (SIMPLE) Fairness
Act, H.R. 4118. This bill would delay the penalties many Americans will
face this year by not having health insurance. The President has
unilaterally delayed implementation of Obamacare for many businesses,
essentially exempting them from any penalties this year. This bill
provides individual citizens with the same treatment afforded
businesses. It is only fair that hardworking Americans be granted the
same relief the Administration has already granted to businesses.
Finally, I am honored to share with you that I have received the True
Blue Award from the Family Research Council and Focus on the Family.
This award is presented to Members of Congress who have exhibited
leadership and commitment to the defense of family, faith, and freedom.
Determination is based on votes cast by representatives of the people
who have consistently supported pro-family issues and have stood for
the defense of life.
L-R: Tim Wildmon, President of the American Family Association,
Congresswoman Hartzler, and FRC President Tony Perkins
It is indeed an honor to receive this award on behalf of the good
citizens of Missouri's Fourth Congressional District, whose thoughts
and views I take to heart with every vote I cast.
Have a good week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
This
week,
the
House
has
addressed
a
number
of
issues.
Among
them,
the
growing
uncertainty
of
the
situation
in
Ukraine
and
high
energy
prices
here
in
Missouri.
This
week
also
brought
an
unveiling
of
the
President&#8217;s
Fiscal
Year
2015
budget.
The
House
also
worked
to
address
concerns
over
the
Obamacare
penalty
taxes
set
to
take
effect
this
year.
As
you
may
know,
Russia
sent
troops
to
the
Crimea
region
of
Ukraine,
violating
Ukraine&#8217;s
national
sovereignty.
In
response,
many
options
are
being
discussed
here
in
Washington
and
with
our
allies
and
partners
abroad.
This
week,
the
House
took
action
to
condemn
this
act
of
aggression
by
Russia
and
provide
support
for
the
government
of
Ukraine.
One
action
that
the
President
has
advanced
is
to
provide
loan
guarantees
for
Ukraine
so
that
they
would
not
have
to
rely
on
Russian
energy.
The
House
passed
H.R.
4152
this
week,
which
would
ensure
any
funds
would
come
from
existing
appropriations
rather
than
from
future
spending.
This
helps
to
accomplish
the
U.S.
objective
of
assisting
the
Ukrainian
people,
without
increasing
future
spending.
It
is
important
that
we
send
a
clear
signal
to
Russia
that
its
violation
of
the
sovereignty
of
Ukraine
is
not
acceptable,
and
the
international
community
will
ensure
there
are
consequences.
On
another
matter,
many
Missourians
and
people
throughout
the
country
have
been
affected
by
a
shortage
of
propane
used
to
heat
their
homes.
Missourians
have
seen
dramatic
spikes
in
the
cost
of
propane.
This
week,
the
House
took
action
to
help
ease
the
propane
shortage,
and
to
lower
energy
costs
in
the
long
term.
The
House
passed
the
Home
Heating
Energy
Assistance
Through
Transportation
(HHEATT)
Act .
Due
to
the
ongoing
propane
shortage,
the
Department
of
Transportation
has
granted
temporary
hours
of
service
waivers.
This
would
allow
truckers
to
drive
for
longer
hours,
speeding
up
deliveries
of
much-needed
propane.
However,
these
waivers
have
been
extended
multiple
times,
creating
uncertainty.
The
HHEATT
Act
would
extend
the
waivers
until
May
31,
2014,
unless
a
state
governor
decides
that
the
need
for
additional
propane
has
been
met
in
their
state.
I
am
proud
to
be
a
cosponsor
of
this
legislation,
and
I
hope
the
Senate
will
take
quick
action
to
provide
this
much-needed
relief.
This
week,
the
President
unveiled
his
Fiscal
Year
2015
budget.
The
House
Budget
Committee,
on
which
I
serve,
held
hearings
on
the
budget
to
analyze
what
its
impact
on
the
country
would
be.
I
am
disappointed
that
the
President&#8217;s
budget
fails
to
get
us
on
a
path
to
fiscal
responsibility.
His
budget
raises
taxes,
increases
the
national
debt
by
$8.3
trillion,
and
never
balances.
The
President&#8217;s
budget
does
nothing
to
take
on
our
entitlement
crisis
and
does
nothing
to
provide
solutions
to
the
problems
facing
today&#8217;s
senior
citizens
and
tomorrow&#8217;s
generations.
As
a
member
of
the
House
Budget
Committee,
I
am
committed
to
finding
well
thought
out
reforms
to
protect
and
preserve
Social
Security
and
Medicare
for
generations
to
come.
On
another
matter,
the
House
took
action
this
week
to
delay
implementation
of
penalties
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
provisions
of
the
President&#8217;s
health
care
law.
My
colleagues
and
I
passed
the
Suspending
the
Individual
Mandate
Penalty
Law
Equals
(SIMPLE)
Fairness
Act ,
H.R.
4118.
This
bill
would
delay
the
penalties
many
Americans
will
face
this
year
by
not
having
health
insurance.
The
President
has
unilaterally
delayed
implementation
of
Obamacare
for
many
businesses,
essentially
exempting
them
from
any
penalties
this
year.
This
bill
provides
individual
citizens
with
the
same
treatment
afforded
businesses.
It
is
only
fair
that
hardworking
Americans
be
granted
the
same
relief
the
Administration
has
already
granted
to
businesses.
Finally,
I
am
honored
to
share
with
you
that
I
have
