The Rigell Report: Philippines, Health Care, Job Fair
Dear Friend,
Prayers for the Philippines
Teri joins me in sending our prayers to those in the Philippines affected by Typhoon Haiyan. Reports indicate more than 4,000 people have died and more than 1,600 remain missing. More than 25,000 people in our region are of Filipino descent, and last week I met with Filipino Ambassador His Excellency Jose Lampe Cuisia, Jr., to convey our deepest sympathies for the loss of life. The people of the Philippines need our help. Teri and I have donated and ask that you consider donating to one of the charities below.

The (Un)Affordable Care Act
The roll-out of the healthcare.gov website was a failure, but the problems created by the (Un)Affordable Care Act (UCA) extend well beyond that. Eventually the website will be fixed, but America will still stuffer from its crushing cost and the $1 trillion in new taxes. Whether one believes this law is the right thing for our country or not (which I do not) the fact is more than 3 million Americans
many from our district
have received cancellation notices as a direct result of the UCA.
Leaders dont just point out problems, they advance solutions. Thats why I support an AFFORDABLE alternative to the UCA that was introduced by Congressman Tom Price, a physician from Georgia. Dr. Prices plan is based upon the following principles:
1) Access to coverage for all Americans
2) Coverage that is truly owned by the patient
3) Improved health care delivery structure
4) Reduction of out-of-control costs
Health care in America can and must be improved. I encourage you to read more about this common sense, more affordable plan

Job Fair
Too many of our friends and neighbors are unemployed, underemployed, or have given up looking for work. This is unacceptable. Earlier this month our office hosted our inaugural Job Fair at Regent University, and we were very encouraged by the results. More than 2,000 job seekers had the opportunity to meet nearly 90 companies and organizations looking for employees. And people were HIRED that day! Shortly after leaving the job fair, I received a text message from a neighbor letting me know he was offered and accepted a job on the spot. Ill continue to fight for pro-growth policies in Washington to keep creating jobs! Check out pictures from the day

Mindful that I work for you, I remain
Yours in Freedom,
Scott Rigell
