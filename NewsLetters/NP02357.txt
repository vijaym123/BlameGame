Lee, Rubio Introduce Economic Growth
And Family Fairness Tax Reform Plan
On Wednesday, Marco and Senator Mike
Lee (R-UT) unveiled their Economic Growth
and Family Fairness Tax Reform Plan. In
an effort to fix our broken tax code
system, Rubio and Lee outlined their plan
to eliminate the bias in the tax code
against parents and families, encourage
economic growth to create more jobs and
better wages, and enhance the ability of
businesses to compete globally.
An excerpt of Marcos opening
remarks is below, and a video of the
remarks, which includes remarks in
Spanish, is available
here .
We have to confront these 21
st
century challenges with
21
st
century solutions. And
today is the first step in part of that
process of how we confront it. The
first thing we have to do is we have to
become globally competitive again. We
have to make America the best place in
the world for people to do business, to
invest and to innovate. And one of the
ways we can do that is by reforming our
tax code to become a pro-investment tax
code, a pro-growth tax code. And
thats what the business tax
reforms embedded in this plan here
today would do.
The business tax reforms that
were proposing will once again
make America the best place in the
world to invest and innovate. And our
goal is to ensure that when companies
and employers and entrepreneurs and
innovators make a choice of where it is
theyre going to create jobs,
where it is theyre going to
start their new business, where it is
theyre going to expand
theyll choose America before
they choose anyone else.
The second thing embedded in
these tax reforms is we wanted to
empower individual Americans,
particularly families
hardworking parents who are struggling
with the cost of raising children in
the 21
st
century. And our tax
reforms recognize that our current
structure today penalizes families who
are raising our future taxpayers. And
so you will see that reflected in our
individual tax reforms.
The sum of this plan is the
hope of triggering economic growth,
because we believe economic growth is
the first step in a multi-step process
towards bringing America fully into the
opportunities of the 21
st
century.
According to non-partisan tax experts,
the Rubio-Lee plan would create 2.7
million jobs, boost the GDP by 15% and
wages by 12.5%. Read the Tax Foundation

Rubio Urges Kerry To Not Recommend
Removal Of Cuban Regime From State
Sponsor Of Terrorism List
Marco, the chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committees
Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere,
Transnational Crime, Civilian Security,
Democracy, Human Rights, and Global
Womens Issues, urged Secretary of
State John Kerry to not recommend the
removal of Cuba from the State Sponsor of
Terrorism List. In December, President
Obama requested that the State Department
conduct a review of Cubas status
on the list, guided by the facts
and the law.
In
a
letter to Kerry , Marco highlighted
the Castro regimes harboring of
fugitives the Federal Bureau of
Investigation has designated as
terrorists, as well as its
support of terrorist groups like the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
(FARC) and the Basque Fatherland and
Liberty (ETA).
I am greatly disturbed by
recent media reports that you are
considering recommending to the
President that he de-list Cuba from the
State Sponsor of Terrorism List
(SSTL),
Rubio wrote . I believe
that there should be no consideration
of such a step while Cuba still harbors
fugitives labeled
terrorists by the FBI,
provides support and safe harbor to
members of terrorist groups like the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
(FARC) and the Basque Fatherland and
Liberty (ETA) and continues to flout
international norms with respect to
weapons smuggling and an ongoing
relationship with North
Korea.
The United States cannot in
good faith remove Cuba from the State
Sponsor of Terrorism List while the
Castro regime harbors terrorists who
have killed Americans, actively
supports designated Foreign Terrorist
Organizations by harboring their
members and continues to flout
international law through clandestine
weapon transfers with a rogue regime
like North Korea,
Rubio added .

Rubio Comments On Prime Minister
Netanyahus Address To
Congress
On Tuesday, Marco issued the following
statement after attending Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahus
address to Congress:
Prime Minister Netanyahu
provided a stark assessment of the
dangerous path the administration has
taken us on through its negotiations
with Iran. Allowing Iran to retain its
nuclear infrastructure even as it does
not change its behavior is
unacceptable.
Congress should pass
additional sanctions on Iran as soon as
possible, and it should also ensure
that any deal is submitted to Congress
for a formal review. I will continue
working to increase pressure on Iran to
ensure that the regime does not acquire
nuclear weapons.
We must not trade away U.S.
and Israeli security for vague
commitments from a terrorist-sponsoring
regime that has killed Americans and
threatens to annihilate
Israel.
Following Death Of Another
Borinqueneer, Rubio Again Urges Obama
To Expedite Congressional Gold
Medal
Marco issued the following statement
Monday regarding the death of Antonio
Ramos Oyola, a veteran of the
Armys 65th Infantry Regiment, also
known as the Borinqueneers:
Last Tuesday,
I
urged President Obama to expedite
the awarding of the Congressional Gold
Medal to the Borinqueneers, an Army
unit that fought in World War I, World
War II and the Korean War. Since
signing the law awarding this medal
last year, several Borinqueneers have
died, including four in Florida. Sadly,
shortly after I called on the President
to move quickly, we were again reminded
of why time is truly of the essence
here when another Borinqueneer passed
away before receiving his medal.
Antonio Ramos Oyola, a
Borinqueneer veteran, recently passed
away last Tuesday evening at the VA
hospital in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and
we send his family our condolences and
thank them for their service to the
United States, including his son who
lives in Florida.
While Antonio lived a full
life, unfortunately, he did not live to
receive his Congressional Gold Medal. I
urge the President to do everything he
can to make sure every Borinqueneer
alive today receives his Congressional
Gold Medal as soon as
possible.
