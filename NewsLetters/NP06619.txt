David -- I&rsquo;m not kidding around when I say Cheri&rsquo;s in serious trouble.
A right-wing Super PAC just announced a massive ad buy targeting our campaign.
Worse yet, as of 5:30 PM we&rsquo;re still coming up $962 short on our ad buy goal. If we fall short tonight,
our Democratic campaign could be in for a heartbreaking loss.
Look David, the choice is yours.
Please, step up for Cheri.

David -- it&rsquo;s Saturday night, so I&rsquo;ll keep this quick:
We&rsquo;re in a hole right now, $2,042 behind on tomorrow&rsquo;s ad buy deadline. And we only have 24 hours left.
David, this is Cheri&rsquo;s first ad buy deadline since a right-wing Super PAC announced a deceptive ad campaign targeting her record.
Coming up short is NOT an option. Not if we want to re-elect Cheri.
Will you chip in a gift of any amount to close the gap for Cheri? Every dollar counts.

Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Cheri&rsquo;s working hard to get our message out to Illinois&rsquo; 17th district, but with a right-wing Super PAC coming after us, we could be in for a heart-wrenching defeat this election. Please, chip in whatever you can afford: http://action.cheribustos.com/Chip-In
