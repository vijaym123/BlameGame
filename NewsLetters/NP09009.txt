Friend -
I wanted to share with you a
recent article
published on Christian News Network, reporting that city councils and county commissioners across the country are re-introducing or considering adding prayer into their meeting agendas, in response to the Supreme Courts recent decision in
Town of Greece v. Galloway,
upholding the historic practice of opening legislative bodies with prayer.
As the founder and co-chair of the Congressional Prayer Caucus, I am encouraged to hear that towns and cities across the country are exercising their constitutional rights and bringing prayer back into the halls of local government. Prayer plays an important role in American life, and is woven throughout the very fabric of our nations history. I remain dedicated to guarding the right of individuals in America to exercise their constitutionally protected faith freedoms.
Yours in service,
Randy
