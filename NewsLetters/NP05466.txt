Last week, we told you Karl Rove launched new ads
blasting
Cheri's record...
Since then, nearly 2,OOO
of Cheri's top supporters have chipped in to fight back!!!
Now, we&rsquo;re within range of $5O,OOO online
-- just in the last two weeks!
If we can do it, it'll send SHOCKWAVES throughout Illinois -- but our public fundraising deadline is at MIDNIGHT!
Chip in right now to tell Karl Rove to stay OUT of Illinois:
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
