Rep. Gosar On VA Resignation: "That Don't Impress Me Much"
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, U.S. Congressman Paul A. Gosar, D.D.S.
(AZ-04) issued the following statement after learning of the
resignation of Robert Petzel, Under Secretary for Health at the
Department of Veterans Affairs:
"In an apparent attempt to feign accountability for the deaths of as
many as 40 veterans at the Phoenix VA, the White House today announced
the resignation of Robert Petzel, the top VA health official. We are
not fooled, however, by this resignation, as Mr. Petzel was planning to
retire in 2014 anyways. In fact, President Obama nominated his
replacement days before his resignation.
"This looks like a classic scapegoat show resignation. And that don't
impress me much.
"Our veterans deserve true accountability and answers, along with a
concrete plan of action - not empty gestures and insults to our
intelligence."
