Netanyahu Addresses Congress
This week, in a
Joint Meeting of Congress, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke
about confronting Iran and preventing them from obtaining a nuclear
bomb. Those that attended the remarks heard a powerful and persuasive
speech as to why America should be wary of Iran until they demonstrate
a verifiable commitment to be part of the world community and cease
calling for the destruction of Israel.
I was proud to stand
with our close ally, Israel, and remain committed to their security and
peace in the Middle East.
Restoring Certainty
to the Permit Process
The entire West Virginia
delegation in the House introduced a bill this week to end the EPAs
dangerous practice of revoking permits years after they have been
approved.
In 2011, the EPA took the unprecedented step to
retroactively revoke a lawfully issued, four-year old section 404 water
permit for the Spruce No. 1 Surface Mine in Logan County, West
Virginia.
This action creates uncertainty for any business that needs
a permit for its operations
not just coal but manufacturing,
construction, agriculture, and many others. To protect jobs and encourage
investment, we will continue to fight this kind of arbitrary action from
the EPA.
President Obamas Latest
Overreach
As you may be aware, the Obama Administration
issued a new rule which will ban the popular 5.56 mm ammo, commonly
referred to as lightgreen tips, by re-categorizing the round as armor
piercing. This is a bad proposal, which would ban a whole class of common
rifle ammunition used in the overwhelmingly popular AR-15, all with no
explanation.
I have signed on to a letter to the ATF being
led by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), Chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, opposing this action. With this decision, the Administration
continues its troubling pattern of executive overreach.
The
ATF will be accepting comments on this proposal until March 16, 2015.

Protecting Our Power
Grid
This week, the Energy &amp; Commerce
Committee held a hearing about our nations power grid and its reliability.
I asked our witnesses, representatives from across the industry, to
cut through the legalese and tell us what the priority should
be.

Hosting West
Virginians
My office was filled this week with West Virginians
visiting Washington to discuss a range of issues and express their desire
for the Congress to get back to normalcy. It was an honor to host so
many advocates and concerned citizens from the First District. Please
check out my photo album on
Facebook
to see all
our visitors.
Making College More
Affordable
In his annual budget, President Obama proposed
to tax middle-class college savings plans, called 529s, to pay for
new liberal spending programs. After saving for years to pay for their
childs tuition, President Obama was threatening to wipe out American
families savings with another tax increase.
Last week, the
House passed H.R. 529 to expandthe 529 college savings plans. In a
direct rebuke to Obamas plan, the bill passed with the near-unanimous
support of Republicans and Democrats.

Mountaineers Update
As Coach
Huggins said, "there are some things that happened that are just hard to
explain." West Virginia let go of an 18 point lead over Kansas this
past Tuesday. The Jayhawks were able to pull away with a 76-69 victory
in overtime, securing the Big 12 regular-season
championship.
This game followed an equally disappointing 78-66 loss against
Baylor this past Saturday. The Mountaineers still hold the #20 rank as we
head into our final regular season game against Oklahoma State
University.
Have a great week,
David
