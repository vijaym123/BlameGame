Hello Friends!
It's another week
without unemployment insurance for over 40,000 Wisconsinites. They join
more than 2 million people across our nation who are waiting on
Congress to act. This week, the Senate passed a bill that would provide
relief to those who have found themselves unemployed. Now it's time for
those in the House of Representatives to do their jobs. I wrote an
op-ed in the Huffington Post
urging
action.
I
joined with the Congressional Progressive Caucus ,
supporters and the unemployed at a press conference asking the House to
act!
This
woman pictured above is selling her clothing to survive. This is
completely unacceptable. We must support people in
need.

Other news:
This week, I led the debate on the House floor to support the
Congressional Black Caucus alternative
budget . Unlike the Republican budget, the CBC budget seeks to help
working families and struggling Americans by reducing poverty and
income inequality. Unfortunately, House Republicans passed the fiscal
year 2015 budget that
turns its back on
millions .
I always enjoy meeting
the Les Aspin Center for Government interns from Marquette
University!
