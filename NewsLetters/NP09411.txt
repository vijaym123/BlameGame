FEATURED STORY
Keeping the Spirit of Memorial Day Alive Each Day
Honoring Their Service and Sacrifices
Senator Stabenow recently presented U.S. Army World War II veteran Floyd
Monhollen with his Bronze Star at a ceremony hosted by VFW Post 552 in
Lincoln Park. Monhollen joined the war effort in 1944 and served in
seven countries while deployed in the European Theater. "Floyd served on
the front lines as an infantry rifleman in France during the harsh
winter. He endured hardships and challenges most of us cannot imagine,"
Senator Stabenow said.
Monhollen's family contacted Senator Stabenow's
office for help in getting his Bronze Star, which was conferred upon him
and all others who received the Combat Infantryman Badge during World
War II.

WHAT YOU MAY HAVE MISSED
Stabenow Cosponsors Bill to Improve Mental Health Treatment of Veterans
Senator Stabenow is committed to bringing parity to the treatment of
mental and physical health, a goal that's particularly crucial for our
veterans and active-duty military personnel. Building on the success of
the bipartisan Excellence in Mental Health Act, Senator Stabenow is the
lead cosponsor of Senator Roy Blunt's Caring for America's Heroes Act
(S.2276) Their bill would eliminate the cap on days of inpatient
psychiatric treatment for military service members' families and remove
some preauthorization requirements. "Caring for the mental health of our
veterans and their families is critically important," said Senator
Stabenow. "Twenty-two veterans die by suicide every day, and many more
suffer from unseen wounds. This legislation will help our veterans and
their families get the care they need so they can get treatment for
injuries from the neck up, as well as from the neck down."
Trip of a Lifetime for a Lifetime of Service
Last week, Senator Stabenow welcomed 80 veterans from the UP who came to
Washington as part of the sixth Honor Flight trip.
The veterans spent
the day visiting and reflecting at the memorials recognizing their
service and honoring their fallen comrades who served in World War II
and the Korean War. "It is always a great privilege to honor Michigan's
brave men and women who put their lives on the line to protect our
country," said Stabenow.
"These honor flight trips are a fitting
tribute to our veterans, giving them an opportunity to see their
memorials firsthand.
We owe all of our veterans our unwavering
support." Stabenow sent certificates for the veterans to be distributed
during the "Mail Call," traditionally held on the flight back home.
