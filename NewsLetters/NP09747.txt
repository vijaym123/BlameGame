Hello, Walleye!
"Every day you spend fishing adds a day to your life." - Rick's dad
What an honor to be with our great Governor, Mark Dayton, and
Lieutenant Governor from Duluth, Yvonne Prettner-Solon, for the
Governor's annual fishing opener! Employing five generations of Nolan
family fishing experience on Gull Lake, yours truly brought in this 18"
beauty shortly after midnight.
Dear Friend,
For the Nolan family, like tens of thousands of other families here in
Minnesota, this past weekend's fishing opener marked an unofficial
national holiday. The weather was fine. The walleye and northerns were
biting. And I was delighted to join Governor Dayton and Lieutenant
Governor Solon as we cast our first lines shortly after midnight
Saturday morning to kick off the Governor's annual fishing opener -
held this year on Gull Lake near where I grew up and live to this day.
Sport fishing, of course, is more than a great Minnesota tradition.
Like the hunting, camping and hiking we live up North to enjoy, fishing
anchors a tourist and recreation industry that brings billions of
dollars into our communities via the people we welcome from all over
our nation and the world. As Congressman, it's my sacred duty to do
everything in my power to protect our water, air, timber and land for
ourselves, and for future generations.
With that in mind, this year's fishing opener was especially meaningful
for me, because Congress is nearing passage of the Water Resources
Reform and Development Act (WRRDA in Washington lingo), including my
amendment to protect the entire Mississippi watershed, along with most
all of our northern Minnesota lakes, rivers, and streams, from invasive
Asian carp by closing the St. Anthony Lock and Dam in Minneapolis.
The St. Anthony Lock and Dam is one of the last barriers we have to
prevent Asian Carp from moving north to invade the Mississippi
watershed and eventually destroy the habitat of the native fish we
value so highly, and that contribute so much to our quality of life.
In addition to closing St. Anthony, I was pleased to shepherd through a
companion amendment that redefines "invasive species" to include animal
creatures as well as plants - providing the Army Corps of Engineers
with money and authorization to do research and abatement on zebra
mussels and hundreds of other forms of animal life that threaten the
Great Lakes and waterways throughout our nation.
The WRRDA bill was approved by our conference committee last Friday,
with passage by the full House expected over the next couple of weeks.
I'll keep you posted as it makes its way through Congress to the
President's desk. Meanwhile, happy fishing - and have a great week.
Sincerely,
_____
When Women Succeed, America Succeeds:
Join Us This Week in Chisago City, Brainerd, or Duluth
Former teacher Martha Firling, Duluth business owner Briana von Elbe
and U.S. federal mediator Darlene Voltin are among the many friends and
advisors who helped us plan our upcoming series of women's economic
forums coming up in Chisago City, Brainerd, Duluth, and Hibbing. Click
here
for the complete schedule, beginning
tomorrow (Tuesday) in Chisago City
What do women need from this great nation? As I travel through the
district, women tell me they need solid, everyday support systems in
place to help them, and their families, succeed. That means we in
Congress need to keep fighting to raise the federal minimum wage to
$10.10 per hour - because two-thirds of all minimum wage earners are
women. Furthermore, we need to establish paid family leave, equal pay,
fair employment and workplace practices, affordable child care, and
student loan rates that make education available to everyone.
We will be discussing these issues and more at our women's economic
forums beginning this week in Chisago City, Brainerd, and Duluth. So
whether you're working now, looking for a job, or interested in
starting your own business, I hope you will join Mary, me, and women
business owners, working women, and community leaders at one of these
forums. We are excited to welcome you. Click here
for the complete schedule, and we'll see
you there!

A Moment of Silence to Honor Congressman Oberstar
Members of the Minnesota delegation - Reps. Kline, McCollum, Peterson,
Walz, Ellison, and Paulsen, joined me in leading a moment of silence on
the U.S. House Floor in honor of Jim Oberstar's life and memory.
Last week, I rose with my fellow Members of the House from Minnesota to
eulogize the great work of former Congressman Jim Oberstar, and to hold
a moment of silence in the halls of Congress to honor our friend and
colleague. There's no question that our nation is a better, more
decent, more compassionate place for every day that he served.

Working Families Deserve Paid Sick Days
No working parent should have to choose between losing their day's
earnings or caring for a sick child. That's why I've signed on as a
cosponsor of the Healthy Families Act (H.R.1286), to give working
families 7 paid sick days a year, so parents will be free to stay home
and take care of sick kids - or to go to the doctor themselves. One in
three Eighth District families has a female head of household, and as
more and more women enter the workforce, our public policies must
adapt. Offering paid sick days is one of the most effective ways we can
modernize today's workplaces, and I'm proud to have my name on a bill
that supports working families in this way.

Congress Advances 21st Century Charter Schools
The bipartisan bill we passed last week to boost free, public charter
schools with additional funding and resources (H.R.10, the Success and
Opportunity through Quality Charter Schools Act) is both good public
policy and a tribute to forward-thinking Minnesotans a generation ago.
In the mid-1980's, then-Minnesota governor Rudy Perpich and many of our
state's business leaders pioneered what became a national movement to
improve America's public school system by providing students more
options to zero in on their special interests and needs - and give
communities unique opportunities to offer innovative educational
programs. As part of that effort, Minnesota established its first
charter schools. Today, with some 164 public charter schools spread
across our state, students are augmenting their core curriculums with
extra attention to the arts, languages, environmental studies, advanced
technology, and journalism, just to name a few. Here in Minnesota' s
8th District, we boast charter schools in Tofte, Cross Lake, Duluth,
Eveleth, Grand Marais, Bemidji and Tower.

University of Minnesota's Extension
Celebrates 100 Years of Modern Farming
Congratulations to University of Minnesota Extension, on 100 years of
using the latest technologies to keep our food safe and affordable,
improve the environment, and prepare tomorrow's leaders in agriculture
and the sciences. In 1909, the Smith-Lever Act was signed into law,
creating the nationwide Extension program, which partnered local
farmers, conservationists, and scientists with universities to deliver
science-based solutions to crop and livestock issues, crop
diversification, wood and wetlands protection, and how to adapt to
variations in growing seasons brought about by climate change. Last
year, more than 700,000 Minnesotans took part in Extension programming,
including 34,500 volunteers in the 4-H, Master Gardener, and Master
Naturalist programs. I'm a proud cosponsor of H.Con.Res.86, honoring
this landmark anniversary. Here's to a century more!

Our Week in Pictures
Mayor of Biwabik Jim Weikum and his beautiful family met with me in my
office to discuss how we can better invest in school libraries, as well
as workforce training programs to help students transition into the
workforce - especially important in reducing the high rate of
unemployment for young Americans.
I met with members of the Communication Workers of America (CWA) to
discuss the ongoing Transpacific (TPP) trade negotiations, including my
recent Star Tribune op-ed
revealing the dangers of "fast-tracking" our nation's trade
agreements. I will do everything in my power to fight efforts in
Congress to fast-track TPP. CWA is one of the largest unions in the
U.S., representing workers in telecom and information tech, news media,
broadcast & cable tv, education, health care, law enforcement, and many
more.
Colleen Seelen of Buckman, MN, a member of the Pierz School Board,
stopped by my office with fellow members of the Emergency Nurses
Association to talk with me about mental health funding and trauma
grant programs, important for rural hospitals looking to expand the
scope and quality of services they provide.
Members of the Minnesota Rural Electric Association were in town this
week to discuss, among other issues, H.R.2548, the Electrify Africa
Act, which would help assist countries in sub-Saharan Africa develop
their power grid and provide electricity to Africans living in both
urban and rural areas. I voted in support of H.R.2548 last Thursday.
Bill King and Pat Waddick of Cirrus Aircraft in Duluth stopped by my
office to discuss policies critical to the vitality of general aviation
in Minnesota's 8th District, including efforts to expand our regional
airports to bring in more business commuters and tourists. President
Obama recently signed into law my bill to establish a streamlined, more
job-friendly regulatory system for Cirrus and other small aircraft
manufacturers.
I talked issues related to Critical Access Hospitals with members of
the Minnesota Hospital Association, including representatives from
Fairview Health Services, St. Josephs, Essentia Health, Mille Lacs
Health System, Cuyuna Regional, Little Falls Hospital, and more.
Critical Access Hospitals receive Medicare reimbursement under a
special formula designed to improve patient outcomes and enhance
services, particularly in rural areas.

Finally...
Here's to a Delicious Mother's Day!
It was a family affair this weekend at the Governor's Fishing Opener -
my son, Mike, daughter-in-law Lynette, and grandson, Justin, were out
Saturday morning on Gull Lake, and later, Mary and I went out on a
little lake nearer to home. Look at the nice crappie Mary caught! It
made for a delicious Mother's Day Brunch: fish, eggs, and French toast
with our homemade maple syrup.

Report
from
Representative
Rick
Nolan
Hello,
Walleye!
"Every
day
you
spend
fishing
adds
a
day
to
your
life."
-
Rick's
dad
What
an
honor
to
be
with
our
great
Governor,
Mark
Dayton,
and
Lieutenant
Governor
from
Duluth,
Yvonne
Prettner-Solon,
for
the
Governor's
annual
fishing
opener!
Employing
five
generations
of
Nolan
family
fishing
experience
on
Gull
Lake,
yours
truly
brought
in
this
18"
beauty
shortly
after
midnight.
Dear
Friend,
For
the
Nolan
family,
like
tens
of
thousands
of
other
families
here
in
Minnesota,
this
past
weekend&#8217;s
fishing
opener
marked
an
unofficial
national
holiday.
The
weather
was
fine.
The
walleye
and
northerns
were
biting.
And
I
was
delighted
to
join
Governor
Dayton
and
Lieutenant
Governor
Solon
as
we
cast
our
first
lines shortly
after
midnight Saturday
morning to
kick
off
the
Governor's
annual
fishing
opener
-
held
this
year
on
Gull
Lake
near
where
I
grew
up
and
live
to
this
day.
Sport
fishing,
of
course,
is
more
than
a
great
Minnesota
tradition.
Like
the
hunting,
camping
and
hiking
we
live
up
North
to
enjoy,
fishing
anchors
a
tourist
and
recreation
industry
that
brings
billions
of
dollars
into
our
communities
via
the
people
we
welcome
from
all
over
our
nation
and
the
world.
As
Congressman,
it&#8217;s
my
sacred
duty
to
do
everything
in
my
power
to
protect
our
water,
air,
timber
and
land
for
ourselves,
and
for
future
generations .
With
that
in
mind,
this
year&#8217;s
fishing
opener
was
especially
meaningful
for
me,
because
Congress
is
nearing
passage
of
the
Water
Resources
Reform
and
Development
Act
(WRRDA
in
Washington
lingo),
including
my
amendment
to
protect
the
entire
Mississippi
watershed,
along
with
most
all
of
our
northern
Minnesota
lakes,
rivers,
and
streams,
from
invasive
Asian
carp
by
closing
the
St.
Anthony
Lock
and
Dam
in
Minneapolis.
The
St.
Anthony
Lock
and
Dam
is
one
of
the
last
barriers
we
have
to
prevent
Asian
Carp
from
moving
north
to
invade
the
Mississippi
watershed
and
eventually
destroy
the
habitat
of
the
native
fish
we
value
so
highly,
and
that
contribute
so
much
to
our
quality
of
life.
In
addition
to
closing
St.
Anthony,
I
was
pleased
to
shepherd
through
a
companion
amendment
that
redefines
"invasive
species"
to
include
animal
creatures
as
well
as
plants
-
providing
the
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
with
money
and
authorization
to
do
research
and
abatement
on
zebra
mussels
and
hundreds
of
other
forms
of
animal
life
that
threaten
the
Great
Lakes
and
waterways
throughout
our
nation.
The
WRRDA
bill
was
approved
by
our
conference
committee
last
Friday,
with
passage
by
the
full
House
expected
over
the
next
couple
of
weeks.
I'll
keep
you
posted
as
it
makes
its
way
through
Congress
to
the
President's
desk.
Meanwhile,
happy
fishing
-
and
have
a
great
week.
Sincerely,
When

What
do
women
need
from
this
great
nation?
As
I
travel
through
the
district,
women
tell
me
they
need
solid,
everyday
support
systems
in
place
to
help
them,
and
their
families,
succeed.
That
means
we
in
Congress
need
to
keep
fighting
to
raise
the
federal
minimum
wage
to
$10.10
per
hour
-
because
two-thirds
of
all
minimum
wage
earners
are
women .
Furthermore,
we
need
to
establish
paid
family
leave ,
equal
pay ,
fair
employment
and
workplace
practices ,
affordable
child
care ,
and
student
loan
rates
that
make
education
available
to
everyone.
We
will
be
discussing
these
issues
and
more
at
our
women's
economic
forums
beginning
this
week
in
Chisago
City,
Brainerd,

So
whether
you're
working
now,
looking
for
a
job,
or
interested
in
starting
your
own business,
I
hope
you
will
join
Mary,
me,
and

We

to

A
Moment
of
Silence to
Honor Congressman
Oberstar
Members
of
the
Minnesota
delegation
-
Reps.
Kline,
McCollum,
Peterson,
Walz,
Ellison,
and
Paulsen,
joined
me
in
leading
a
moment
of
silence
on
the
U.S.
House
Floor
in
honor
of
Jim
Oberstar's
life
and
memory.
Last
week,
I
rose
with
my
fellow
Members
of
the
House
from
Minnesota
to
eulogize the
great
work
of
former
Congressman
Jim
Oberstar,
and
to
hold
a
moment
of
silence
in
the
halls
of
Congress
to
honor
our
friend
and
colleague.
There's
no
question
that
our
nation
is
a
better,
more
decent,
more
compassionate
place
for
every
day
that
he
served.
Working
Families
Deserve
Paid
Sick
Days
No
working
parent
should
have
to
choose
between losing
their day's
earnings
or caring
for
a
sick
child .
That's
why
I've
signed
on
as
a
cosponsor
of
the
Healthy
Families
Act
(H.R.1286),
to
give working families
7
paid
sick
days
a
year, so
parents
will
be
free
to
stay
home
and
take
care
of
sick
kids
- or
to go
to the doctor
themselves.
One
in
three Eighth
District
families
has
a
female
head
of
household,
and
as
more
and
more
women
enter
the
workforce,
our
public policies
must
adapt.
Offering
paid
sick
days
is
one
of
the
most
effective
ways
we
can
modernize
today's
workplaces ,
and
I'm
proud
to
have
my
name
on
a
bill
that
supports
working
families
in
this
way.
Congress
Advances
21st Century
Charter
Schools
The
bipartisan
bill
we
passed
last
week
to
boost
free,
public
charter
schools
with
additional
funding
and
resources
(H.R.10,
the
Success
and
Opportunity
through
Quality
Charter
Schools
Act)
is
both
good
public
policy
and
a
tribute
to
forward-thinking
Minnesotans
a
generation
ago.
In
the
mid-1980's,
then-Minnesota
governor
Rudy
Perpich
and
many
of
our
state's
business
leaders
pioneered
what
became
a
national
movement
to
improve
America's
public
school
system
by
providing
students
more
options
to
zero
in
on
their
special
interests
and
needs
-
and
give
communities
unique
opportunities
to
offer
innovative
educational
programs.
As
part
of
that
effort,
Minnesota
established
its
first
charter
schools.
Today,
with
some
164
public
charter
schools
spread
across
our
state,
students
are
augmenting
their
core
curriculums
with
extra
attention
to
the
arts,
languages,
environmental
studies, advanced
technology, and
journalism,
just
to
name
a
few.
Here
in
Minnesota'
s
8th
District,
we
boast
charter
schools
in
Tofte,
Cross
Lake,
Duluth,
Eveleth,
Grand
Marais,
Bemidji
and
Tower .

Opener

Mike,

out
Saturday
morning
on

Mary

I
went
out
on
a
little
lake
nearer
to
home.
Look
at
the
nice
crappie
Mary
caught!
