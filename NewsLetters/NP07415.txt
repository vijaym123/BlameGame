Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
During my time in the district last summer, I had the opportunity to tour quite a few small businesses including Bay Pharmacy in Eustis and Mail Express in Mount Dora. Last week, I was privileged to welcome constituents from both companies during their time in Washington. Lori Blake, her daughters Kimberly and Charlene, and Jill Zerniak came from Bay Pharmacy to get a tour of the Capitol; and Doug Rehman, owner of Mail Express met with me regarding federal telecomm issues that he is concerned about. It was great to see them in DC.

Students from Orlandos After School All Stars program came to my office last week during their weeklong camp in Washington, where they learned about leadership, advocacy, government, and politics. I enjoyed talking with the young people, answering their questions, and sharing my experience in Congress.

Central Florida is painfully familiar with the traffic congestion that plagues Interstate 4 en route through Orlando. The planned $2.3 billion I-4 Ultimate Project will address the problem by adding four new lanes, reconstructing existing lanes, upgrading bridges and replacing major interchanges along 21 heavily-traveled miles through downtown Orlando. Although the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) has selected a firm to undertake the project, in order for it to proceed, key financing from the Federal Highway Administrations (FHWA) TIFIA program must be secured.
Last week, I spoke with U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx to discuss the importance of the I-4 Ultimate Project and of securing the federal financing portion in a timely manner. I was pleased to later relay to Florida Secretary of Transportation Ananth Prasad the assurances of Secretary Foxx that FHWA would do everything possible to work with FDOT and avoid any federal delays in financing, which will save Florida taxpayers and accelerate delivery of these vital interstate improvements.

Last week, The Washington Times published an editorial I wrote on Innovative Transportation Financing, which highlighted my transportation legislation,
TIFIA 2.0 . Rather than continuing to rely solely on current funding sources or raising taxes, we must pursue new revenues generated by innovative options. Creative solutions are needed in order to meet our expanding needs. If we fail to update our methods, then the infrastructure that connects us as an economy and as a community will not be built.

Constituent Corner:
Recently, a constituent from Orlando contacted my office asking for assistance in obtaining an updated Medicare card. Last week, he sent me this email, which I share with his permission:
I would like to thank you and your staff for helping me to obtain an updated Medicare card. Unfortunately, I have been trying to obtain this card on my own for nearly two years with little success. On four different occasions, I have been told that the card had been mailed and that I would have to wait (anywhere from two weeks to four weeks) until another card could be issued. In all four instances no card arrived. It was an exasperating experience.
I cant tell you how much it meant to have a person to help me. I appreciate your taking an interest in my problem and in your having obtained a positive result on my behalf.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
During a lengthy debate in the Rules Committee recently, Elizabeth Price Foley, a
noted professor of law at the Florida International University College testified
that When a President unilaterally waives, delays or suspends a law such as the ACA (Affordable Care Act), he squelches any opportunity to have a robust, political debate about the workability of the law, and thereby undermines democracy itself.
Do you believe the House of Representatives should defend its Constitutional responsibilities and the separation of powers by asking the federal courts to rule against President Obama for an overreach of his authority?
Yes
No

previous survey question,
"Continuing conflict between Israel and the U.S. Department of State-designated terrorist organization Hamas has dominated global news this week. While the violence briefly subsided during the temporary cease-fire that Israel called to allow food and humanitarian aid to reach the civilians in Gaza, Hamas-launched rockets continue to be fired into Israel. Do you believe that Israel has a right to defend itself against these attacks?" Yes - 95%
No - 4%
I don't know - 1%
Legislative Update:
Fraud, waste, and abuse are often linked together in discussing Washingtons economic woes. Fraud and abuse are both against the law, but waste is often rewarded. Perverse incentives currently exist that strongly encourage federal agencies to spend every dollar they are appropriated. Reversing that incentive by rewarding efficiency will produce savings to the American taxpayer, improved operation of our federal agencies, and ultimately better services for taxpayers.
In order to curb this practice of rewarding wasteful government spending, I introduced the
To Help Reduce Inefficient Federal Tendencies (THRIFT) Act.
The
THRIFT Act
provides a process for federal departments and agencies to evaluate their own spending and to identify measures that will reduce costs and improve efficiency. The
THRIFT A ct provides an incentive for blowing the whistle on waste.
Getting our nations fiscal house in order starts with a Congress that is willing to cut waste and live within its means. Families make these tough fiscal decisions every day. It is time for Washington to get serious about doing more with less.
I am committed to leading by example in curbing wasteful government practices in Washington. Over the past three years, I have
returned over one million dollars
from my Congressional office budget and voted repeatedly for a balanced budget. Click here for
