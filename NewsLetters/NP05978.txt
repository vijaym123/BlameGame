Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Last Sunday, I visited the Fathers House Christian Center after meeting their Executive Pastor, Mike Matheny, at a youth outreach program they were sponsoring in the Leesburg Square Mall. Following that service, I attended the Leesburg Salvation Armys annual meeting to honor those who work in public safety. I was humbled for them to offer me the opportunity to thank those first responders who serve and keep us safe.

I was privileged to spend quite a bit of time in the Leesburg area last week, including a visit to the Veterans Memorial at Fountain Park. World War II and Korean War veteran Donald van Beck took me to the Leesburg War Memorial and showed me their beautiful monument that honors those who have served our country. It was moving to see the 8,764 names that are engraved on the wall in memory of those who have sacrificed so much to protect the freedoms and security we enjoy.
Some of the other visits I made in Leesburg last week included:
-	Sharing an update on the VA and the current situation with ISIS at the Korean War Veterans meeting
-	Sitting down with Principal Dr. Patrick Galatowitsch at Leesburg Elementary, before answering questions from the students about how laws are made
-	Speaking to the Leesburg Noon Rotary and donating a flag flown over our nations Capitol to help raise money at their upcoming charity event for veterans
-	Stopping by the Daily Commercial to talk with the reporters and
editors about current issues facing our country, economy, and community
-	Receiving the Leesburg Chamber guest speaker recognition after giving a congressional update
-	Talking with business leaders from Leesburg Partnership and recognizing their award winners who have contributed to the North Lake community
-	Congratulating Ed and Pat Kerr on 65 years of marriage. I was thrilled to present this faithful couple with a flag flown over the Capitol in honor of their momentous wedding anniversary.

Last Thursday, I attended the Orlando Business Journal's Veterans of Influence Awards luncheon that honored veterans who are serving our community. The character, skills, and discipline of these men and women have greatly influenced both the economic success and cultural direction of Central Florida and have been invaluable contributors to our community.

Over the past several months, I supported several bills to end human trafficking, and was glad to attend the Lake County Human Trafficking Taskforce Meeting last week to offer my services as our local community works to end this heinous crime. Roughly 20 million children, women, and men are victimized around the world, including many within the United States. As a modern-day form of slavery, human trafficking is one of the greatest tragedies of our time and is a horrendous act that deserves the harshest of punishment.

At South Lake Hospital last week, I received a briefing from Dr. Brahmbhatt &amp; Dr. Parekattils team on the cutting edge technologies they practice at the PUR (Personalized Urology and Robotics) Clinic. Earlier this year, during the Drive for Men's Health, Drs. B and P drove their electric car from Clermont to New York City, making stops along the way to increase awareness of mens health issues and to encourage them to make their health a priority.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Recently, a constituent from Orlando contacted my office regarding her application for work authorization.
The constituent was scheduled to begin employment with the University of Central Florida as an Assistant Professor, but needed her application to be approved or risk losing her job.
My office reached out to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and forwarded the information and her request for the case to be expedited. I was happy to receive the notice that her case had been considered, approved, and delivered to her in a timely manner.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
How serious do you consider the terrorists threats posed by ISIS?
Concerning, but not necessarily harmful to American interests and personnel
Dangerous if allowed to continue to grow and expand
Very serious, and we must do everything possible to not only dismantle, but destroy these terrorist organizations
Submit Your Response
Response from the
previous survey question,
"If our top military and security personnel were to consider this a necessary aspect to destroying ISIS and protecting America, would you support a military strategy that included American troops fighting these Islamic terrorists on the ground in Iraq and Syria?" Yes - 64%
No - 29%
I don't know - 7%
Legislative Update:
Last week, a coalition of nations led by the United States struck militant positions inside Syria. I support these coalition airstrikes, which included several Arab nations who are critical regional partners in this effort. This decision should have been made long ago. Unfortunately, time has forced many of our current decisions, shrinking the options available and allowing threats to fester, multiply, and increase in severity.
My hope is that our President commits to a clear strategy which will eradicate these terrorist threats to the U.S. and our allies and destroy ISIS and the al-Qaeda branch Khorasan. These terrorist organizations that were struck by coalition forces have no place in today's world.
