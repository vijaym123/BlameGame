Dear Friends,
As hurricane season
approaches, our community must once again prepare for storms that can
threaten South Florida. Many families wait until the last minute to
begin disaster preparedness planning. We should all work to obtain
supplies needed to wait out a hurricane and the days following it as local
crews and emergency responders tend to the most impacted areas. Luckily,
there are a few steps we can take that can help ensure a safer
hurricane season.
As a long-time South Florida resident, I know
that although our forecasting models and building codes have
drastically improved since 1992s Hurricane Andrew, many in our community have
been lulled into a sense of complacency over when or if the next big
storm will strike. Unfortunately, once we receive news of a hurricane
watch or hurricane warning, many are just beginning to formulate an
emergency plan. South Floridians should already have a plan in place to
effectively deal with the impact and aftermath of a
storm.
Here are a few tips to help your family this hurricane
season:
Designate specific
roles for family members such as a member of the family to put up
shutters or shop for last-minute
necessities.
Already purchase or formulate a plan
to purchase non-perishable canned goods, three to seven gallons of
water per person, and any hardware you may need to secure your home or
apartment.
Have an emergency evacuation route if you live in a low-lying
area.
Inform
yourself of the closest shelters should you not be able to ride out the
storm or stay in your home after a
hurricane.
Keep important legal documents,
such as the deed or title to your home, insurance papers, and
prescription medications in a water-proof plastic
bag.
Secure all outdoor furniture and
anything that could potentially become a projectile in strong
winds.
During this hurricane season, it is up to each of us to be
informed and save as many lives during a disaster as possible. Stay
tuned to the National Weather Services Weather Updates ( www.weather.gov
or 305-229-4522) for important information
regarding the tropics. If you need help informing yourself or preparing a
disaster plan for your family for a potential hurricane, please contact
the resources below. I urge everyone to stay prepared, stay informed,
and stay safe this hurricane
season!
