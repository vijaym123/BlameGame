Working
Together With Our Local Leaders to
Enhance Our Communities
Dear Friend,
Over the past week, I had the
opportunity to meet with local elected
officials throughout Central and Southside
Virginia who join me in representing the
two cities, 21 counties, and 39 towns that
make up Virginias Fifth District. It
is an honor to work alongside these state
Senators, Delegates, members of Boards of
Supervisors, City and Town Council members,
School Board members, and other
Constitutional Officers to serve the fine
people we represent.
It is vitally important that all levels
of government work together closely,
particularly on the issues where the
federal government is having a negative
impact on the important work that these
officials do on the state and local level.
For example, I heard a great deal from
these officials about harmful unfunded
federal mandates imposed upon states and
localities.
Unlike the federal government, states
and localities are legally bound to make
the difficult decisions needed to balance
their budgets and provide critical services
like public safety and good schools.
Federal mandates make it much harder for
our local communities to hire and keep
quality teachers and provide our first
responders with the resources they need to
protect our citizens. I am committed to
reducing burdensome and unnecessary
mandates on states and localities so they
can continue providing these vital services
while maintaining low property taxes.
My state and local counterparts have
also informed me about federal policies
that have hindered their efforts to create
jobs in our region. Our local officials are
constantly working to attract companies to
our communities to provide good-paying
jobs, but federal bureaucrats have
distorted federal law in a way that is
preventing these jobs from coming to the
Commonwealth. My bipartisan bill, the
Commonsense Permitting for Job Creation
Act, came from discussions I had with local
officials in Henry and Pittsylvania
Counties about federally imposed roadblocks
that are impeding much-needed economic
development. I appreciate the opportunity
to collaborate with local leaders for the
betterment of our communities and I look
forward to the continued progress of this
important bill.
Government works best when it is closest
to the people, and we are fortunate to be
represented by dedicated public servants at
the state and local level. I am committed
to working alongside these leaders to set
policies that will create a brighter future
for all our citizens and communities.
