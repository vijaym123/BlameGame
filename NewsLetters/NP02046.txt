Honoring North Dakota's Vietnam Veterans
Growing up in North Dakota, it was easy for me to see the rich
tradition of military service. From the Friday night fish fry at the
local VFW to remembrance ceremonies on Memorial Day and Veterans Day,
North Dakotans have not only served our nation admirably through the
years, but also understand the importance of recognizing the
contributions and sacrifices of our servicemembers.

lost during their service in the Vietnam War.
As our nation remembers the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War, I felt
compelled to do what so many North Dakotans have done for years - honor
those who gave their lives in defense of our country. Last week, I
began a series of speeches on the Senate floor to tell the stories of
and honor the brave sons of North Dakota who were lost during their
service in the Vietnam War. And I'm partnering with students from
Bismarck High School to gather information and stories about these
soldiers' lives, which I will incorporate into my speeches.

198 North Dakotans gave the ultimate sacrifice in Vietnam to protect
our country and guarantee our freedoms, and we must do everything we
can to recognize and honor their service. I hope you'll join me in
helping to spread the word as together, we honor the selfless
sacrifices of these servicemembers and truly show that their lives
mattered.

Honoring
North
Dakota's
Vietnam
Veterans
Growing
up
in
North
Dakota,
it
was
easy
for
me
to
see
the
rich
tradition
of
military
service.
From
the
Friday
night
fish
fry
at
the
local
VFW
to
remembrance
ceremonies
on
Memorial
Day
and
Veterans
Day,
North
Dakotans
have
not
only
served
our
nation
admirably
through
the
years,
but
also
understand
the
importance
of
recognizing
the
contributions
and
sacrifices
of
our
servicemembers.
Click

view
my
first
in
a
series
of
speeches
honoring
North
Dakotans
lost
during
their
service
in
the
Vietnam
War.
As
our
nation
remembers
the
50th
anniversary
of
the
Vietnam
War,
I
felt
compelled
to
do
what
so
many
North
Dakotans
have
done
for
years
-
honor
those
who
gave
their
lives
in
defense
of
our
country.
Last
week,
I
began
a
series
of
speeches
on
the
Senate
floor
to
tell
the
stories
of
and
honor
the
brave
sons
of
North
Dakota
who
were
lost
during
their
service
in
the
Vietnam
War.
And
I'm
partnering
with
students
from
Bismarck
High
School
to
gather
information
and
stories
about
these
soldiers'
lives,
which
I
will
incorporate
into
my
speeches.
