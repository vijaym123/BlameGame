>From The Desk Of Congressman Yoho
Friends,
This has been another productive district work period. Traveling all
around North Central Florida, from Middleburg in Clay County, to
Williston in Marion County, to Jasper in Hamilton County---I love
representing the Third District. There are too many meetings to list in
this newsletter, however,
I would like to highlight a few before I
have to fly back to Washington.
I was fortunate to take an agriculture tour of Marion County to hear
the concerns of some of our local farmers. Spending time with these
folks is humbling. They work the land from sun up to sun down to put
food on our table. For that, I am thankful.
One thing that makes me happy as a Member of Congress--and a father for
that matter--is taking part in events that help kids. Giving back and
helping the next generation succeed is tremendously rewarding. I was in
Middleburg to dedicate a new "Welcome Center and Arrival Facility" for
the The Girl Scouts of the Gateway Council. This new facility will help
the Girl Scouts create future leaders from among their ranks. In the
words of Juliette Gordon Low, founder of the Girl Scouts, this facility
is "giving them the opportunity to develop physically, mentally, and
spiritually."
Additionally, organizations that help make our communities a better
place should always have our support. I was fortunate to meet with Rev.
Battle and his dedicated team to hear about the work of the Unity
Family Community Center in Williston, FL. Their inspirational work
helps promote personal responsibility among the youth in--and
around--the community. Such positive people doing great things for the
community is infectious and I wish them continued success.
Lastly, I would like to tell you that I signed onto an Amicus Brief
that supports a federal lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act (ACA)-
Hotze v. Sebelius. Of the nearly 100 lawsuits that have been filed
against the ACA, Hotze v. Sebelius has been
r
anked as
one of the six court cases most likely to overturn ACA.
Filed on May 7, 2013, Hotze v. Sebelius would overturn ACA on the
grounds that it violates both 1) the Origination Clause, Article 1,
Section 7; and 2) the Takings Clause of the 5th Amendment of the U.S.
Constitution. Neither of these issues were decided in the lawsuit
National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, nor the
lawsuit filed by 27 states against ACA.
It is my hope we can replace this disastrous health care law and
replace it with a more patient-centered law that puts the people back
in charge of their health care decisions. Two other House alternatives
that would do that are H.R. 3121 and H.R. 2300. With this legislation,
and others, it is my hope we can begin rebuilding our economy and make
America stronger.
Thank you for reading this newsletter and I look forward to talking to
you next week.
Sincerely,
Ted

From
The
Desk
Of
Congressman
Yoho
Friends,
This
has
been
another
productive
district
work
period.
Traveling
all
around
North
Central
Florida,
from
Middleburg
in
Clay
County,
to
Williston
in
Marion
County,
to
Jasper
in
Hamilton
County---I
love
representing
the
Third
District.
There
are
too
many
meetings
to
list
in
this
newsletter,
however,
I
would
like
to
highlight
a
few
before
I
have
to
fly
back
to
Washington.
I
was
fortunate
to
take
an
agriculture
tour
of
Marion
County
to
hear
the
concerns
of
some
of
our
local
farmers.
Spending
time
with
these
folks
is
humbling.
They
work
the
land
from
sun
up
to
sun
down
to
put
food
on
our
table.
For
that,
I
am
thankful.
One
thing
that
makes
me
happy
as
a
Member
of
Congress--and
a
father
for
that
matter--is
taking
part
in
events
that
help
kids.
Giving
back
and
helping
the
next
generation
succeed
is
tremendously
rewarding.
I
was
in
Middleburg
to
dedicate
a
new
"Welcome
Center
and
Arrival
Facility"
for
the
The
Girl
Scouts
of
the
Gateway
Council.
This
new
facility
will
help
the
Girl
Scouts
create
future
leaders
from
among
their
ranks.
In
the
words
of
Juliette
Gordon
Low,
founder
of
the
Girl
Scouts,
this
facility
is
&#8220; giving
them
the
opportunity
to
develop
physically,
mentally,
and
spiritually .&#8221;
Additionally,
organizations
that
help
make
our
communities
a
better
place
should
always
have
our
support.
I
was
fortunate
to
meet
with
Rev.
Battle
and
his
dedicated
team
to
hear
about
the
work
of
the
Unity
Family
Community
Center
in
Williston,
FL.
Their
inspirational
work
helps
promote
personal
responsibility
among
the
youth
in--and
around--the
community.
Such
positive
people
doing
great
things
for
the
community
is
infectious
and
I
wish
them
continued
success.
Lastly,
I
would
like
to
tell
you
that
I
signed
onto
an
Amicus
Brief
that
supports
a
federal
lawsuit
against
the
Affordable
Care
Act
(ACA)&#8211;
Hotze
v.
Sebelius .
Of
the
nearly
100
lawsuits
that
have
been
filed
against
the
ACA,
Hotze
v.
Sebelius
has
been
r anked
as
one
of
the
six
court
cases
most
likely
to
overturn
ACA .
Filed
on
May
7,
2013,
Hotze
v.
Sebelius
would
overturn
ACA
on
the
grounds
that
it
violates
both
1)
the
Origination
Clause,
Article
1,
Section
7;
and
2)
the
Takings
Clause
of
the
5 th
Amendment
of
the
U.S.
Constitution.
Neither
of
these
issues
were
decided
in
the
lawsuit
National
Federation
of
Independent
Business
v.
Sebelius ,
nor
the
lawsuit
filed
by
27
states
against
ACA.
It
is
my
hope
we
can
replace
this
disastrous
health
care
law
and
replace
it
with
a
more
patient-centered
law
that
puts
the
people
back
in
charge
of
their
health
care
decisions.
Two
other
House
alternatives
that
would
do
that
are
H.R.
3121
and
H.R.
2300.
With
this
legislation,
and
others,
it
is
my
hope
we
can
begin
rebuilding
our
economy
and
make
America
stronger.
Thank
you
for
reading
this
newsletter
and
I
look
forward
to
talking
to
you
next
week.
