We can&rsquo;t emphasize enough how close this election is.
One top political forecaster just reported that Doug Ose has &ldquo;a great shot to defeat Rep. Ami Bera,&rdquo; and another said that the race is a &quot;pure toss-up.&quot;
THAT is why mega-wealthy outsiders are spending more to defeat Ami than any candidate in the country. THEY THINK THEY CAN BUY THIS SEAT.
Look, we&rsquo;ve never needed you more. If we&rsquo;re going to fight back for Ami, it&rsquo;s going to take an unprecedented grassroots effort while there&rsquo;s still time to make a difference.
