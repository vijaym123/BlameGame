Rubio Comments On Veterans Bill
Agreement
Marco issued the following statement
regarding the veterans bill agreement
reached in the Senate on Thursday:
For months, Ive worked
with Representative Jeff Miller and
veterans organizations to pass
legislation empowering the Veterans
Affairs Secretary to fire incompetent and
negligent managers. In recent days,
Ive worked with Senators Burr,
McCain and Sanders to ensure that this
important proposal was included in their
veterans bill that the Senate will
consider in coming weeks. I am pleased
that real accountability measures are
included in the legislation. Considering
the deep debt of gratitude our nation
owes our veterans, Im optimistic
that the Senate will soon join the U.S.
House of Representatives and pass these
important reforms. As we look forward to
voting on this bill, I will be reviewing
it closely to ensure it delivers on
Americas promises to our
veterans.
Marco discussed the need for greater
accountability in the VA on

Rubio Presses Administration For
Answers On Taliban Prisoner Exchange
Throughout the week, Marco expressed
concern over the circumstances surrounding
the recent release of five senior Afghan
Taliban leaders and any long-term
implications the prisoner exchange may have
on the safety and security of U.S.
personnel and interests.
In
a
letter to Secretary of Defense Chuck
Hagel , Marco points to the dangerous
precedent set by negotiating with
terrorists while still involved in a war on
terror, and presses the Administration for
answers on its policy.
In agreeing to release five,
hardened Afghan Taliban leaders, I am
concerned the United States is setting a
dangerous precedent by negotiating with
terrorists that remain at war with the
United States and are responsible for
daily attacks against U.S. soldiers, the
Afghan people and government, and is
actively working to destabilize the
region,
wrote Rubio . I am also
deeply troubled that this exchange
occurred just days after the President
announced he was withdrawing the
remaining troops in Afghanistan on an
artificial timetable that bears no
relation to our strategic goals in that
part of the world. At the very time when
we are drawing down our forces in
Afghanistan, and exposing remaining
forces to greater risk, we just returned
five, senior enemy combatants who a year
from now may be back on the
battlefield.
This exchange may further
endanger American lives and encourage
terrorist kidnappings of U.S. citizens as
a means to extract additional concessions
from the U.S. Government,
added Rubio . Further,
serious questions remain about the
willingness and capability of the Qatari
government to monitor these detainees,
share intelligence on their activities,
and ensure they are not reengaging with
terrorist elements.
Marco weighed in on the Talbian prisoner
release in an op-ed for
USA
Today
and during an interview with
FOX
News Gretchen Carlson .
Rubio, Inhofe Hail Senate Passage Of
Resolution Condemning Death Sentence For
Sudanese Christian Woman
Marco, a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, and Jim Inhofe (R-OK)
hailed the Senates passage of a
resolution condemning the death sentence of
Meriam Yahia Ibrahim Ishag, a Sudanese
Christian woman accused of apostasy. The
resolution calls for her immediate and
unconditional release from prison, where
she recently delivered her newborn baby,
who remains in jail with her and her 20
month-old son.
The resolution, introduced along with
Chairman of the Subcommittee on African
Affairs Chris Coons (D-DE) and Committee
Chairman Bob Menendez (D-NJ), reaffirms the
U.S. governments commitment to
ending religious discrimination, and calls
for the inclusion of religious freedom and
respect for international human rights
during the drafting of Sudans new
constitution.
Imprisoning a woman for simply
refusing to recant her faith is a
deplorable act that speaks to the kind of
religious intolerance that, while
blatantly and ignorantly continues to
exist today, has no place in the
world,
said Rubio . Whether a
Christian from Sudan, or a member of the
Jewish community in Israel, religion is
not something to be condemned, but
rather, to be celebrated. It is a
fundamental right that governments around
the world should be working to protect
not take away.
Today, I welcome the
Senates passage of this bipartisan
resolution calling for Ms.
Ibrahims unconditional release.
But it is my hope that this measure
encourages the Sudanese government to
incorporate international human rights
into the countrys new
constitution, so that all Sudanese people
may know religious freedom,
added Rubio . While the
Senate made strides in its commitment to
religious freedom, Ms. Ibrahim is still
in the fight of her life. The world is
watching as we await the decision of the
Sudanese court, and todays passage
is a testament to our obligation to Ms.
Ibrahim and her young family.
ICYMI: Rubio: Remembering D-Day
In
an
op-ed for
National Review Online , Marco
commemorated the 70
th
anniversary of the Allied
invasion of Normandy. An excerpt of the
piece is available below:
When we think about American freedom,
we dont always think about the
price that was paid for it. When we think
about the advancement of liberty around
the world, we dont always think
about the achievements of great men and
women before us that made it
possible.
The fight for human freedom is as old
as mankind itself, and many who have
fought so desperately for it have failed
to attain it. Yet today we remember a day
that stands as one of the greatest
triumphs of freedom over oppression,
liberty over tyranny, and good over evil
in the history of the world.
Seventy years ago today, on June 6,
1944, the Allied Expeditionary Forces,
under the command of General Dwight D.
Eisenhower, crept across the English
channel in the dark of night, stormed
through fog and sand and heavy artillery
fire, overtook the beaches of Normandy,
and began the work of peeling back the
shroud of Nazi control that was stretched
over Europe.
The evening before the assault was
launched, General Eisenhower distributed
a letter to the troops outlining the
enormity of the next days mission:
You will bring about the
destruction of the German war machine,
the elimination of Nazi tyranny over the
oppressed peoples of Europe, and security
for ourselves in a free world.
Never before had the line between good
and evil been so bold, the stakes of a
battle so high, or the decisiveness of a
victory so clear.
