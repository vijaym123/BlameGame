The majority of our national debt is simply a
result of unnecessary, wasteful spending that is focused on the here
and now rather than the future. There has also been a lackluster
desire to fix budget-busting problems with long-standing safety net
programs.
The debt is the total of yearly budget deficits
over time and interest paid on borrowed funds from nations like
China.
Thankfully, the House has proposed a budget to reduce the
deficit, diminishing the need to borrow, and begin reversing the
debt.
The Houses
A Balanced Budget for a Stronger
America
would cut $5.5 trillion in spending with no tax increases, and
balance the budget in less than 10 years.
This budget takes
several approaches to relieve Americans of constant regulatory pressure
and tax burdens.
It would repeal Obamacare, which has driven up
health care costs through numerous tax provisions and driven down
Americans full work potential due to employer mandates.
States
would have more control to shape education, food stamp and Medicaid
programs to meet their needs, benefiting all Americans.
This budget
would simplify the tax code.
The budget would not only increase
fiscal security but also strengthen national
security.
Balancing the budget should be common sense.
Every American balances
their budget to make ends meet.
Why should the federal
government be any different?
The proposal is a solid step to reverse
reckless spending.
I support this budget to strengthen our nation,
to clean up our fiscal house for American families and protect our
children from a runaway debt burden.
