In the past few years, Social Security paid $133 million to beneficiaries who were deceased, according to a
recent article
by the Washington Post, while the federal employee retirement system paid more than $400 million to retirees who had passed away. And in 2011 alone, auditors found Medicare paid $23 million for services provided to dead people.
That means while many American families are struggling to make ends meet, they are also having to foot the bill for this fraudulent and wasteful spending. That is unacceptable. Congress has a duty to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent in the most efficient, effective manner possible. That is why I supported the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act,
H.R. 4053 , to require agencies to take precautionary measures before making payments, verifying the eligbility of recipients and reducing the frequency of improper payments.
Yours in service,
Randy
PS
I also supported the Stop Government Abuse Act,
H.R. 2879 , which holds federal agencies responsible for the misappropriation of funds, and am working to end abuse-riddled government programs (like government-funded cell phones). Read about my efforts
