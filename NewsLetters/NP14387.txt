Dear Friend:
Thank you so much for signing up to receive my e-newsletter.
We will be sending it periodically to keep folks in North Carolina up to date on all the work I have been doing in Washington, DC, on behalf of the people of our state. When you elected me to the Senate, I promised to have an open and accessible office that is responsive to the needs of North Carolinians. This e-newsletter is just a small part of that equation.
I look forward to communicating with you about the important issues being addressed by the Senate and the impact they will have on North Carolina. Whether we're working to reform our health care system, creating new jobs to get our economy back on track, providing tax cuts for middle class families, investing in alternative energy or improving access to education, I look forward to working on your behalf on these and other critical issues of our time.
Again, thank you for signing up for my e-newsletter and I look forward to keeping in touch with you!
Kay R. Hagan
United States Senator, North Carolina
