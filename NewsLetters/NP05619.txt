Congressman Lamborn Supports Army
High Altitude Training
10/7/14
Today, Congressman
Doug Lamborn sent the following letter to the Bureau of Land Management,
supporting the high altitude training of Ft. Carson's Combat Aviation
Brigade. The letter will also be read at the public meeting taking
place Tuesday evening, 10/7, at 5:30pm at the Abbey Event Complex,
Benedictine Room, at 2951 East U.S. 50 in Caon
City.
Text of
Letter
To Whom It May
Concern:
The Constitution of the United States
of America clearly establishes provid[ing] for the common defense
as a top priority for the federal government. Without security, our
efforts to pursue happiness are put at great risk. Therefore, our
nations security must be the federal governments first priority. It was in
this spirit that I successfully offered an amendment to the FY2015
National Defense Authorization Act when it was considered by the House of
Representatives which added section 2817 which
states:
It is the sense of Congress
that--
(1)
national defense should be the top
priority for all aspects of the Federal Government;
and
(2)
national security functions, such as military
training and exercises, should be the top priority, particularly with
regard to the use of land owned by the United
States.
This amendment was adopted by a bipartisan
unanimous vote, which should make it clear to the Bureau of Land
Management and other federal government agencies that national security
should be a top priority on public lands.
With all this in mind, I strongly support the request by Ft.
Carson and the 4 th
Infantry Divisions Combat Aviation
Brigade (CAB) to use landing zones for training on public land in
Colorado. This training is vital for our military aviators who may be deployed
to fly in the mountains of Afghanistan or elsewhere around the world.
There is no better location in the United States for Americas finest
to learn and refine their high-altitude aviation skills. Because of
the challenges of operating helicopters at high altitudes, this
training can make the difference between coming home safely and not coming
home at all for these flight crews and the men and women in uniform they
carry around the battlefield.
While this training is vital for our national security and for the
safety of the men and women in uniform, it can be done safely and with
minimal impact on our region. As spelled out in Ft. Carsons proposal,
safety is the first priority for these training efforts. The Army will
do everything in its power to ensure that these operations do not put
humans, animals or our environment at
risk.
Colorado is proud to play an important role in our
nations security and this helicopter training is just one of many ways
that we can show our support for the military and ensure that they get
the training they need to stay safe while keeping us
safe.
I urge you to approve this request and
move forward in a timely fashion.
