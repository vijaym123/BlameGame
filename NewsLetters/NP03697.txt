Dear Friend,
It is a great honor to serve you in the
United States Congress. Though we have much
work ahead of us, I want to take this
opportunity to highlight my work on behalf
of Ohios 16th District in Washington
this past year.
Addressing The Problems At The
VA
Like many living in Ohios 16th
District, I was deeply troubled to learn of
the systematic failures at the Department
of Veterans Affairs (VA). We can and must
be doing more to keep our promise to those
who have served our country.
In July, the House passed the
Veterans
Access to Care through Choice,
Accountability, and Transparency Act .
Highlights from this legislation include
providing $10 billion for veterans to seek
private care at hospitals and clinics
outside the VA, and $5 billion to allow the
department to hire more doctors, nurses,
and medical staff. It was signed into law
on August 7, 2014.
Reducing the Negative Effects of
the Presidents Health Care
Law
As I travel throughout Ohios 16th
District, I continue to hear Ohioans speak
of the negative effects of the
Presidents health care law. Whether
its higher premiums or a small
business grappling with the laws
employer mandate, the broken laws
unintended consequences are
significant.
This past year, the House passed the
Employee
Health Care Protection Act . It allows
American workers who receive coverage
through their employer the opportunity to
keep their health plans through 2019.
Additionally, I introduced the
Simplifying
Technical Aspects Regarding Seasonality
(STARS) Act
to clarify the employer
mandates seasonal worker exemption
provision so that our small businesses can
focus their resources on doing what they do
best: create jobs.
Bringing Transparency to the
Federal Government
In Washington, we know that our current
path is unsustainable, but do we really
know where we stand fiscally? The answer is
that we dont, thanks to the federal
governments incomplete financial
statements.
That is why I introduced the
Federal
Financial Statement Transparency Act.
This bill will encourage the federal
government to clean up its balance sheet,
lead to a more honest depiction of our
nations finances, and ultimately
allow Congress to balance the budget and
more effectively address our growing
debt.
Reining In The EPA
At a time when Americans are in need of
a strong economic recovery, Ohio simply
cannot afford to suffer more job losses as
a result of this administrations
attack on coal and the affordable domestic
energy that it creates. This abundant
natural resource generates over 50 percent
of our states electricity and the
industry employs thousands of Ohioans.
I was proud to support the
Preventing
Government Waste and Protecting Coal Mining
Jobs in America Act . Not only will this
bill curb this administrations
wasteful spending, it also removes the
threat of new job-crushing federal
regulations.
Tax-Free Savings Accounts For
Individuals With Disabilities
Many parents living in Ohios 16th
District have expressed the challenges they
face when it comes to covering the costs
associated everyday living expenses for
their children. The challenge is even
greater for parents with a child who has a
disability.
That is why I was a proud cosponsor of
the
Achieving
a Better Life Experience Act (ABLE)
Act,
a bill that allows individuals
with disabilities and their caregivers to
set up tax-free savings accounts in order
to save for their own costs of medical
care, housing, transportation, and
continued education. It passed the House in
July and was signed into law earlier this
month.
Creating Conditions For Economic
Growth
Over the past several months, we have
seen unemployment reports that show our
labor force participation rate is the
lowest its been in decades. We must
be doing more to incite growth and
innovation.
That is why the House passed the
Jobs
for America Act , a bill that changes
federal law to improve the conditions
necessary for economic growth.
Additionally, I introduced the
Flexibility
to Promote Reemployment Act , a bill
that increases states flexibility to
help unemployed individuals find employment
by reducing the unnecessary Washington red
tape that continues to stand in the way of
job growth.
These are just a few of the more than
300 House-passed bills that remain stalled
in the Senate. Though gridlock in
Washington is frustrating, I am more than
hopeful that come January we can work
together to advance these bipartisan
solutions. As we enter 2015, I look forward
to working with my colleagues on both sides
of the aisle to get our country back on the
path to prosperity.

Year.If our office can be of
