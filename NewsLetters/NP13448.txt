Dear Friends,
As 2013 comes to a close, I wanted to take a moment to look back on
some of the legislation Congress has faced this past year, and some of
the issues I hear most about from you.
Since coming to Congress in January, I have been focused on cutting
spending in Washington, and more jobs in America.
Congressman Collins introduced the TRANSFER Act during a visit to SUNY
Geneseo's Molecular Lab in September.
In fact, it's job creation that is at the heart of the TRANSFER Act of
2013, bipartisan legislation I introduced earlier this year. Recently
approved by the Science Space and Technology Committee
, this legislation will help create jobs
and foster innovation by providing scientists with the resources to
commercialize their ideas - at no additional expense to taxpayers. It
will also have a direct, positive impact on local research
institutions, such as the University at Buffalo, Rochester Institute of
Technology and SUNY Geneseo.
This year there has also been movement in Congress toward getting a
long overdue and comprehensive Farm Bill passed. When it comes to our
local economy I know that agriculture plays a critical and growing
role. That's why I was proud to help draft a bipartisan Farm Bill with
my colleagues on the House Agriculture Committee.
Unfortunately, House and Senate Democrats and Republicans remain
divided on some key provisions of the Farm Bill, including reforms to
the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), a program that
has doubled in cost over the last five years.
Congressman Collins met with member of his agriculture
advisory board at Lamb Farms in May.
Last week, the House voted to extend the expired Farm Bill provisions
for another month to avoid price spikes on milk and other agricultural
products. Now, as we look toward 2014, I remain fully committed to
passing a new Farm Bill, giving our farmers the support and certainty
they deserve.
Locally, my office has worked across the aisle to press the Department
of Homeland Security to establish missions at the Niagara Falls Air
Reserve Station
,
which would help keep the base viable for years to come.
Congressman Collins stood with local leaders to highlight the need for
harbor maintenance during a tour of Wilson Harbor in September.
We have made progress with the Army Corps of Engineers to begin the
long delayed dredging of our Lake Ontario harbors to ensure both safety
and economic vitality. And, I sponsored the CIDER Act, legislation that
would change the outdated definition of hard cider in federal tax law,
giving an economic boost to our local apple growers and cider makers.
In 2013, it became clear that ObamaCare is not just a defective
website, it is a defective law. As Chairman of the Small Business
Subcommittee on Health and Technology, I've tried to highlight the ways
ObamaCare is hurting small business owners and their employees. Simply
put, ObamaCare is confusing, unmanageable, and costly.
I held a hearing
examining the impact of defining a
full-time employee as someone who works 30, not the traditional 40,
hours a week. I raised concerns about the negative impact of the Health
Insurance Tax
, and have highlighted self-insurance as
an affordable option
for some small businesses.
The majority of Americans know that ObamaCare is bad for them and our
economy. And we know that we can do better. That is why I support H.R.
3121, the American Health Care Reform Act, which repeals ObamaCare and
offers simple, patient-centered reforms rooted in the free-market.
Congressman Collins discussed the CIDER Act at Black Bird Cider in
September.
Finally, thank you to everyone who has reached out to me this past year
to share a comment or concern. Your input and opinions are important
and have helped guide many of my decisions.
My favorite part of this year has been the opportunity to travel around
New York 27 and meet those who have trusted me to represent them in
Washington.
It has been an honor to work on your behalf this past year.
Thank you, and I wish you and your family and safe and happy New Year.
Sincerely,
CHRIS COLLINS

Dear
Friends,
As
2013
comes
to
a
close,
I
wanted
to
take
a
moment
to
look
back
on
some
of
the
legislation
Congress
has
faced
this
past
year,
and
some
of
the
issues
I
hear
most
about
from
you.
Since
coming
to
Congress
in
January,
I
have
been
focused
on
cutting
spending
in
Washington,
and
more
jobs
in
America.
Congressman
Collins
introduced
the
TRANSFER
Act
during
a
visit
to
SUNY
Geneseo's
Molecular
Lab
in
September.
In
fact,
it&#8217;s
job
creation
that
is
at
the
heart
of
the
TRANSFER
Act
of
2013,
bipartisan
legislation
I
introduced
earlier
this
year.
Recently
approved
by
the
Science
Space
and
Technology
Committee ,
this
legislation
will
help
create
jobs
and
foster
innovation
by
providing
scientists
with
the
resources
to
commercialize
their
ideas
&#8211;
at
no
additional
expense
to
taxpayers.
It
will
also
have
a
direct,
positive
impact
on
local
research
institutions,
such
as
the
University
at
Buffalo,
Rochester

This

there

also
been
movement

Congress

When
it

our

I

That&#8217;s
why
I
was
proud
to
help
draft
a
bipartisan
Farm
Bill
with
my
colleagues
on
the
House
Agriculture
Committee.
Unfortunately,
House
and
Senate
Democrats
and
Republicans
remain
divided
on
some
key
provisions
of
the
Farm

including
reforms
to
the
Supplemental

a

that
has
doubled

over

And,
I

legislation
that
would

the
outdated
definition
of
hard
cider

federal
tax
law,
giving
an
economic

to
our
local

In
2013,
it
became
clear
that
ObamaCare
is
not
just
a
defective

it
is
a
defective

As
Chairman

I&#8217;ve

the
negative

Your
