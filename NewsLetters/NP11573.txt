Congressman
Steve Stockman
Representing
the 36th District
March 12, 2014
The
Hill Report
Congressman Steve Stockman's Weekly
Newsletter
Conservative Political Action Conference --
CPAC
CPAC
is the largest annual gathering of conservatives, held this past
week in the Washington, DC area.
About 10,000 attendees
from across the country and around the world gathered for networking,
educational seminars and to hear the most respected as well as upcoming
leaders in the movement.
Congressman Stockman was in demand
as a guest on many radio talk shows during the three-day
event.
The Congressman's no-compromise stands on repealing
Obamacare ,
blocking amnesty, defending the Second Amendment and other key
Constitutional-government issues made him a hit on national and local
shows.
Pictured here are interviews with Rick Trader and the on-air team
at Conservative Commando's Radio (above), which serves Philadelphia
and New Jersey, and below, on the Ox
Ochsner
show in St. Cloud, Minnesota; and on
WorldNetDaily's
TV news.
The Congressman had the
opportunity to meet with many conservative leaders, writers and
activists, including writer and filmmaker Dinesh D'souza, who directed the film
"2016: Obama's America;" and afterwards became the target of a
politically-motivated government investigation.
Ukraine
Following the
inspiring victory for freedom in Ukraine, Congressman Stockman reacted with
horror as Russian troops rolled in to seize Crimea and threatens to
seize other regions of Ukraine.
One way we can help keep
Ukraine free and stop or reverse the Russian invasion is to export
American natural gas. Currently Ukraine, and indeed a great part of Europe,
is dependent upon Russian gas. Pictured below is the Congressman is
raising a key point in a Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on
Ukraine.
Rule by
Pen
President Obama
continues to make changes to the
Obamacare
law by executive order and regulations.
This is in violation of the Constitutional separation of powers, and
is setting up a Constitutional crisis which may end up in the Supreme
Court.
By a large majority,
Americas oppose this rule by decree, and support following the
Constitution!

See the Original Magna
Carta
in Houston
Now through August 17, you can see in person the Magna
Carta
at the
Houston Museum of Natural Science. This incredible document was one of the
inspirations for our Constitution.
"An original
edition of the Magna
Carta , and the only known example of the Kings Writ
a letter
from King John to the Sheriff of Gloucester announcing the signing of the
Magna
Carta
is headed to Houston from its home in Hereford
Cathedral.
The Magna
Carta
is considered to be Great Britain's most valuable export to the world
and is a model upon which the United States Constitution was based.
The Magna
Carta
continues to serve as the definitive document modeling basic civil
liberties, and is the source of many of the most fundamental concepts of
law."
Among some of the legal foundations traced to the
Magna
Carta , are
"an understanding of due process, trial by jury, the importance of a
speedy and unbiased trial, and protection against excessive bail or fines
or cruel and unusual punishment."
