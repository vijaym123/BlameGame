Dear Friends,
The
increase in addiction to heroin and prescription drugs has now reached
epidemic proportions in New Hampshire and is a major cause for concern. Last
year alone, we lost 64 individuals to heroin-related deaths,
underscoring just how large of a problem heroin and prescription drug
addiction is in our state.
Thats why earlier this week
I called for federal investments
to help New Hampshire
officials fight this epidemic and support addiction treatment on
behalf of our state. We've lost too many lives to heroin and prescription
drugs and the time to address this issue is now. Specifically, we must
invest in:
Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS)
Grants which help communities keep officers on the streets to handle
increased incidences of crime that result from heroin and other drug
use.
Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) programs that can be
used to strengthen the efforts of the New Hampshire drug task force,
or implement and expand drug court treatment programs in Cheshire,
Grafton, Rockingham, and Strafford counties.
The New England
High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (NEHIDTA) program which
coordinates regional efforts to reduce drug trafficking.
The Drug
Free Communities Support Program to educate children about the
dangers of drug abuse.
The Substance Abuse Prevention and
Treatment Block Grant that connects addicted individuals to treatment
programs.
We all must work together to help those in our
communities suffering from addiction. If you know someone who is struggling
with addiction reach out and make sure they know they dont have to
fight this alone. There are already many
resources
around the state
that can help get people on the road to recovery, now
we just need to do more.
This epidemic is too
serious for us to ignore. I hope we can all work together to better our
communities and protect our friends, families and
neighbors.
Sincerely,
Jeanne Shaheen
