Fellow Illinoisans,
Because of the Affordable Care Act, over
11 million Americans - including 240,000
Illinoisans - have chosen or re-enrolled in a
health insurance plan, most with a tax
subsidy that makes their coverage
affordable.
In the private market, millions more now
have access to expanded coverage for
preventive health care services, such as a
mammogram or flu shot, without any cost
sharing.
Because of the Affordable Care Act, a
person no longer needs to stay in a job
simply to carry health insurance, or be
denied coverage because of a pre-existing
condition. And because of this law,
prescription drugs for seniors cost less.
King versus Burwell
This month, the Supreme Court will make a
decision in a case
King versus Burwell
that
questions who should be getting tax credits
when they buy health insurance.
The plaintiffs charge that Congress only
intended to provide tax credits those
Americans buying health insurance in
marketplaces established by a state, not
those who are buying health insurance in the
federal marketplace.
As someone who was here when we debated
and passed the Affordable Care Act, I can
tell you that is simply not true. It is
my hope that the Supreme Court does the right
thing and realizes that Congress never
intended to have tax subsides go to only some
Americans and not others.
In the following video, I explain the
Illinois impact that this case could
have.
Id like to hear about your
experience with the Affordable Care
Act. Please email me through the

Sincerely,
Dick Durbin
United States Senator
