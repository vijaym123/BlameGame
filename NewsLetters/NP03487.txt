Sign our petition demanding Congress protect Social Security &gt;&gt;
For decades, Social Security has provided millions of Americans the opportunity to retire with dignity. But Boehner&rsquo;s Republicans just voted to undermine this critical program. If you agree we&rsquo;ve got to protect Social Security, sign our petition before tonight's midnight deadline:

David --
For decades, we&rsquo;ve made a promise to America&rsquo;s seniors:
When you work hard and play by the rules, we&rsquo;ll make sure you get the retirement security you deserve.
Social Security has kept that promise. But Boehner and the Republicans don&rsquo;t care -- last week they rammed through a rule that could be used to cut benefits for up to
eleven million
disabled Americans. Cheri&rsquo;s proud to oppose this radical plan, but she needs your help.
Will you sign our petition to protect Social Security before tonight&rsquo;s midnight deadline?
Add your name to demand Congress protect Social Security &gt;&gt;
