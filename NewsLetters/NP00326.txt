VA Community Resource and Referral Center Grand Opening
Today I attended and spoke at the grand opening of the VA's new
Community Resource and Referral Center in North Charleston. Through a
series of local partnerships, the CRRC works to prevent veteran
homelessness and provide resources and tools for veterans experiencing
homelessness already. I was honored to participate in the ceremony.
IRS Senate Finance Committee Hearing
Earlier this week, I questioned IRS Commissioner John Koskinen and
Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George
about a recent data breach, which exposed the personal information of
more than 100,000 taxpayers. You can watch my questioning HERE
.
I also sat down with Greta from Fox News
to discuss the data hack further.
I am deeply concerned about the personal information of those South
Carolinians who might have been affected by the breach. This breach
will add more fire to people who are petrified by the IRS. This is a
management issue, and I will continue to address these matters, to
ensure that taxpayers know their personal information is safe.
ACA Premium Hikes
This weeks news by the Obama administration that more than six million
people enrolled in healthcare plans, including over 100,000 in South
Carolina, will see staggering double-digit rate increases in 2016
because of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is yet another, in a long
string on examples, that prove this law is bad for families,
businesses, healthcare providers and the uninsured.
The ACA continues to be anything but affordable for South Carolina
Families. Almost every week we hear about more soaring premiums, lost
coverage and billions of tax dollars wasted year after year on this
failed national experiment and thats why I continue to support a
complete repeal and replacement of the ACA.
Thank you again for subscribing, and have a great weekend!
Sincerely,
Tim
