Dear Friends,
Gun violence is a plague. Each time we
lose a life, our hearts break and the violence continues.
We must all work together , on the
local, state and federal levels , to
thwart these crimes. Please join me to discuss ways we can prevent this
violence, keep our children safe and take back our
communities.
Other
News:
Yesterday, my Wisconsin colleague
Representative Paul Ryan released his poverty
plan.
I am pleased that
Representative Ryan continues to bring his ideas to the
table.
I am grateful for his desire to positively address
the problems in our prison system and assist low-income Americans
through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC); although I disagree on how he
would fund the EITC
expansion.
Unfortunately, it
is clear that the overarching goal of his poverty plan is to
ultimately cut our social safety net programs.
