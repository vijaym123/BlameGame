Dear
Friend,
I hope that this letter finds
you well. I wanted to make you aware of a new plan I introduced to
make college more affordable.
As
you may know, the cost of attending college has increased
dramatically in the last two decades, and many Americans are now struggling to
afford the costs of higher education.
Student loan debt has
surpassed $1 trillion, which is higher than the nations total credit card
debt, and second only to homeowner mortgage debt.
While the UW
System is under attack at the state level, we need to take concrete
steps now to make sure our colleges, students and their families have the
support they need.
Last week, I
introduced a comprehensive plan to invest in higher education and ease
the burden on current and future student borrowers and their
families.
My College Affordability Action Plan (CAAP) will make college
more affordable for families in Wisconsin and across the nation.
The plan consists of five key
principles:
Government Shouldnt Profit from
Student Loans:
My PELL Grant Funding Act directs any profit
the government makes from federal student loan programs into federal
Pell Grant programs, making sure that Pell Grants remain sustainable and
affordable for future
students.
We Should Allow Student Loans to Be
Refinanced Like Mortgages:
Student borrowers saddled with
decades of high interest loans and high monthly payments should be allowed
to refinance their loans if interest rates drop. This is just common
sense.
We Must Invest in Tax Incentives to Address College
Affordability:
The American Opportunity Tax Credit, Tuition Deduction,
Student Loan Interest Deduction, and improvement of college savings
plans can all help students pay for
school.
Loan Payments Should Match
Earnings:
Many borrowers struggle to make payments in the years
after graduation
we need a streamlined and dynamic repayment system
that automatically adjusts to a borrowers ability to
pay.
Provide Pell
Grants Year-Round:
Nearly 9 million students, of all ages,
depend on Pell Grants. Restoring access to year-round Pell Grants
would help students graduate early or on time by providing the flexibility
they need.
As Congress
moves forward, I can assure you that I will continue to fight to make
college affordable for everyone.
Please do not hesitate to be in
touch with questions or comments you may
have.
Sincerely,
Choose one: I am a student in college I have children in college I will have children in
college in the future None Other? What should Congress do to make
College more affordable? Make sure that Pell Grants remain sustainable and
affordable for future students Allow student loans to be refinanced like
mortgages Invest in tax
incentives to address college affordability Create a streamlined and dynamic
repayment system that automatically adjusts to a borrowers ability to
pay Provide Pell
Grants year-round Other? *By
