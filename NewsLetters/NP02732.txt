On Senate
Floor, Rubio Discusses Defeating ISIL
&amp; Deteriorating Situation In
Venezuela
In
a
Senate floor speech , Marco discussed
the importance of defeating ISIL and the
deteriorating economic and security
conditions in Venezuela. Excerpts from
the speech are below.
ISIL
This group needs to be
defeated.I wish we had taken this
groupon earlier.I wish, in
fact, that we hadgotten involved
in the conflictin Syria earlier
and equippedmoderate rebel
elements,non-jihadist rebel
elements onthe ground so that
they wouldhave been the most
powerfulforce there.The
President failed to do thatin a
timely fashion, and as aresult, a
vacuum was created andthat vacuum
was filled by thisgroup who has
attracted foreignfighters from
all over the worldto join their
ranks. And nowwere dealing
with this problem.But I would
argue better latethan
never.Had we dealt with this two
yearsago or a year and a half
ago, itwouldnt have been
easy, but itwould have been
easier. But Ithink its
important to dealwith it
decisively now.
Venezuela
And so today I wanted to come
here for a few moments and urge the
President once again to do what I asked
him to do in a letter last week, and
that is not sit idly by on the
Venezuelan sanction law he signed last
year, but to use it. To use it
immediately and to use it decisively.
To make clear that the United States of
America will not stand for the
repression taking place in Venezuela,
and that we will use the tools of our
economy and of the power weve
given the President to punish those
responsible for committing human rights
violations in Venezuela against the
people of that great nation.

In an interview on FOX News
The
Kelly File , Marco also said
Congress must authorize a use of force
sufficient to defeat ISIL.
Rubio: IRS Not Doing Enough To
Provide Florida Taxpayers With Printed
Materials Needed To File Their
Taxes
On Wednesday, Marco called on the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to do more
to provide Florida taxpayers with the
printed materials needed to file their
taxes correctly and on time.
Marcos request comes in
response to constituents who have
traditionally relied on printed copies of
the IRS Publication 17, which
provides instructions for most people
filing taxes. The IRS recently ceased
broad distribution of this printed manual
unless requested and paid for by people
preparing their taxes.
In
a
letter to IRS Commissioner John
Koskinen , Marco highlighted
constituent concerns regarding the lack
of availability of Publication 17, and
called on the IRS to report back to his
office by February 18 with its plan to
ensure that taxpayers are able to pay
their taxes without a threat of misfiling
or missing a government imposed
deadline.
While filing taxes
electronically is far more
budget-friendly than printing long
documents, the IRS is doing so at the
cost of violating its self-proclaimed
taxpayer rights. Publication 17 can
still be accessed on the IRS
website, but such access is of little
use to taxpayers without internet
access or, additionally, access to a
printer,
wrote Rubio . Taxpayers
who are seeking access to Publication
17 are doing so with the intent of
paying their taxes; this move simply
complicates tax compliance for those
law abiding citizens who do not have
online access.
I have heard from many
Floridians largely affected by the lack
of Publication 17 documents in print
form this year. My office has received
numerous calls and emails from
constituents inquiring about access to
the document, or needing help with
their taxes now that Publication 17 is
only accessible online,
added Rubio . As such, I
request that you report to my office
immediately on your plans to assist
taxpayers unfairly burdened by the lack
of availability of Publication 17. I
would like a report by February 18th,
as Americans have already started to
examine their tax returns and should
not be in threat of misfiling or
missing a government imposed deadline
due to the inability to access
Publication 17.
Rubio To Colleagues: Dont
Boycott Netanyahu Speech, Israel
Deserves Our Support
In
a
Senate floor speech Thursday , Marco
urged his colleagues to support Israel by
attending Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahus speech to Congress in
March. An excerpt of the speech is
below.
Rubio: You have your right to
voice your concerns, but dont do
this to an ally, dont do this to
a nation that is as threatened today as
it has ever been at any time in its
existence. Dont do this to a
people that are in the cross hairs of
multiple terrorist groups with the
capability of attacking them.
Dont do this to a nation whose
civilians are terrorized by thousands
of rockets launched against them at a
moments notice. Dont do
this to a country thats facing
down the threat of a nuclear weapon
annihilating them off the face of the
Earth. Dont do this to a people
that are being stigmatized all over the
world, even as we speak, who are being
oppressed. Dont do this to a
country that in forum after forum has
become the subject of
de-legitimatization as people argue
that somehow Israels right to
exist is not real. Dont do this
to them.

Constituent Casework Corner
Lillian contacted Senator
Rubios office to assist her
brother, Matthew, in getting his wife a
visa from Ukraine for a kidney transplant
procedure. His wifes visa request
had previously been denied. Members of
the staff met with both Lillian and
Matthew to review the details of their
case, and requested additional
information so the inquiry could be
submitted correctly. As a result, his
wifes visa was recently
approved.
