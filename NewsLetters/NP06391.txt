We Must
Work Together to Combat the Threat of
ISIL
Dear Friend,
On Wednesday, the President addressed
our nation regarding the terrorist group,
Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant
(ISIL). Coming just one day before the
thirteenth anniversary of that tragic
morning of September 11, 2001, it was
essential that he engage with the American
people about this very real, pervasive
threat.
Like all Americans, I have become
increasingly concerned by ISILs
growing presence in Iraq and Syria. It is a
radical organization that has committed
itself to brutality and the killing of
innocent people. I was especially horrified
and saddened by the beheadings of American
journalists, James Foley and Steven
Sotloff. However, the dangers ISIL presents
far exceed these despicable acts, and there
is no doubt that ISIL, left unchecked,
poses a serious threat to our national
security at home and our friends and allies
abroad.
I understand the need to dismantle and
destroy ISIL, but I also believe that
Congress should conduct a full and open
debate to authorize the use of force
against them. The best decisions are made
when government can be held accountable for
the choices that officials make. In no
circumstance is that more imperative than
in the consideration of the authorization
of military action in which we put American
servicemen and women in harms way.
While I respect the Presidents
authority as the Commander-in-Chief of our
military personnel, Congress is charged
with the constitutional responsibility to
provide for the national defense. It is
vital that we be given the opportunity to
act on behalf of the people we represent in
a transparent way by debating and voting
whether to commit America to war against
ISIL.
Moving forward, the President must
continue to keep Congress and the American
people informed about ISIL and the threat
it presents to our security. He must
explicitly define our nations
strategy with identifiable goals and
measuring posts, resolve unanswered
questions regarding the rebels in Syria he
plans to train and arm, and maintain a
comprehensive long-term plan. Furthermore,
we need to fully understand how we are
going meet this challenge and achieve our
goals. I urge the President to continue to
communicate with Congress and the American
people about the strategy he seeks to
employ against ISIL and seek Congressional
approval to require any further military
action.
ISIL has perpetrated considerable acts
of terror against innocent people and
against Americans, and we must take bold
action to ensure that we destroy ISIL. It
is an ever-growing threat to the Middle
East region and U.S. security interests,
and its threat to our national security
will not be tolerated. I look forward to a
robust debate in the House on authorizing
force against ISIL in order to eradicate
this terrorist organization and protect
Americas national security.
