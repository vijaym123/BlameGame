Dear Friend,
"This is so cool!"
Every time I visit a school in the 4th District, I
find myself repeating those four words every couple of minutes. Whether
it's a robot, a new version of the Segway or a fancy new website design
- the breadth and depth of technology our students are employing in
classrooms today blows me away.
I believe we should be encouraging that creativity any way we can.
Which is why I'm writing today to make sure you know about the first
ever Congressional House STEM App Challenge.
Open to students across the country, this contest will give kids in
every congressional district the chance to submit their plans for the
next big app.
Have an idea for the best game since Angry Birds? A plan
for the next Snapchat? My office will be accepting applications from
4th District high school students until midnight on April 30.
And the
coolest part? The winning student from each Congressional District will
have their design displayed in the US Capitol.
If you have any questions about the competition, you can contact Sean
Malone (Sean.Malone@mail.house.gov) in our Newton office or visit my
website for more information:
http://kennedy.house.gov/2014-stem-competition
.
I'm also hoping you'll help me spread the word. Will you forward this
email to your neighbors, family and friends? We're trying to open up
this opportunity to as many folks as we possibly can.
We all know the next Mark Zuckerberg is somewhere out there - maybe
even here in the 4th District. So let's keep encouraging our youngest
entrepreneurs to put their ideas on the table.
Thanks for taking the time to let me fill you in.
All my best,
Congressman Joe Kennedy

Dear

the

blows
me

I
