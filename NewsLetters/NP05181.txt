White House Mishandles and Misjudges
Ebola
Public health experts Scott Gottlieb and Tevi Troy
wrote
in the
Wall Street
Journal
earlier this week that, Much public skepticism about the
governments response to Ebola stems from the dogmatic pronouncements of
Obama administration officials
pronouncements that have too often
proven to be wrong.
This lack of presidential leadership is
unfortunately becoming par for the course. The Presidents failure to
lead Americas foreign policy has produced significant instability
around the world. Similarly, his marshalling of Federal resources to
contain Ebola is marred by the same uncertainty.
At times of
national crisis presidential leadership is indispensable. Unfortunately,
many of the crises we are facing, at home and abroad, are the result of
his teams inability to address challenges before they become
crises.
The Facts About Funding the Fight Against
Ebola
In all the loose talk about Ebola, some have charged
that Congress has not adequately funded the fight against this deadly
disease. The fact checker for the
Washington
Post
recently
wrote , On many levels,
this line of attack is absurd.
This comprehensive fact sheet
lays out the facts
its well worth a read!
Frank
Assessment of Our Middle East Strategy
In an
in-depth
assessment
of President Obamas strategy to
degrade and destroy ISIS, Anthony H. Cordesman asserts: It is too
early to say that the U.S. strategy against the Islamic State is
imploding, but it is scarcely too soon to question whether this is
possible.
His response to that question is worth reading, despite its
length!
And if Cordesmans analysis isnt sobering enough, the
Washington Post
reported
earlier this week that, The Syrian opposition force to be
recruited by the U.S. military and its coalition partners will be
trained to defend territory, rather than to seize it back from the Islamic
State.
This strategy is beyond belief. How can we
expect to destroy ISIS if these terrorists are left in control of
the wide-swath of territory they have already seized?
Little
wonder our enemies have the advantage in many respects, because the
President is telegraphing his lack of a strategy to defeat
terrorism.
Affordable Care Act Policyholders Find Care
Unaffordable
The
New York
Times
reported
on its front page this
past Saturday that growing numbers of people who purchased insurance
under the Affordable Care Act are finding the care they need
unaffordable.
High deductibles on Obamacare policies
many
reaching as high as $5,000
mean patients with coverage still cannot afford
care because they dont have the money to cover their
deductible.
Writing in the
Wall Street
Journal
on Tuesday, an Arizona physician
discusses
another unintended consequence of Obamacare: patients being forced
off private insurance onto Medicaid.
These patients have lost
their ability to keep their insurance and keep their doctors, and are
suffering longer wait times and difficulty finding a new
doctor.
And this doctor is not alone, as this report about a nationwide
poll
of physicians makes
clear.
The President promised the American people that Obamacare would make
healthcare more affordable, but it is having the opposite effect.
With all the other negative consequences of the ACA, its not
surprising that people are increasingly disenchanted with this ill-considered
law.
The U.S. Must Help Ukraine Defend
Itself
With the growing crisis in the Middle East, the ongoing
threat to Ukraines sovereignty and independence has dropped off the
front page and apparently off the Presidents list of hot
spots.
But the threat posed by Russia continues to
grow.
I have repeatedly urged President Obama to grant Ukraine status as a
Major Non-NATO Ally, making that country eligible for military
assistance and equipment from the United States and other members of
NATO.
The President has refused to do so.
I was pleased that
the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the committees
Ranking Member
published
a bipartisan call in
Mondays
Washington Post
for providing
Ukraine with the weapons it needs to defend itself from Russian
aggression.
I have the honor to represent a substantial number
of Ukrainian Americans in my Congressional District. I stand with
Ukraine in its fight to retain its independence and its
freedom.
Salute: New Jerseys Manufacturers
I was
honored on Tuesday to be given the
National Association of
Manufacturers Award for Manufacturing Legislative Excellence
during a
visit to the 500 employees of Siemens Industry Inc. in Florham
Park!
As much as I appreciate the recognition, I salute New
Jerseys manufacturers for their strong contribution to the health of
New Jerseys economy and the well-being of the hundreds of thousands of
families whose bread winners who work for them.
New Jerseys
manufacturing firms contributed more than $38 billion to New Jerseys
economy in 2012.
The total compensation for the average
worker for a manufacturing company is $93,506. That is almost $42,000
more than the average annual compensation earned by workers in private
non-farm sectors (2012).
The federal government must do
more to encourage the growth of manufacturing in America. I will
continue to strongly support measures that reduce the high taxes and
excessive regulation that stifle that potential.
Salute:
John A. Dean American Legion Post
154
Congratulations to the John A. Dean American Legion Post 154 in Butler, which
recently celebrated its 95 th
anniversary!
The Post is
named in honor of John Dean, the first Butler resident to make the
ultimate sacrifice in World War I. Dean was going to the aid of a wounded
comrade when both he and the Marine he was helping were killed by a
German shell.
Post 154 has a long record of service to the
community, providing scholarships to students at Butler High School,
attending veterans funerals, and decorating with flags the graves of
about 1,750 veteran gravesites in Butler and Kinnelon.
I
salute the members of Post 154 for their service to our nation and their
commitment to their community and their fellow
veterans.
