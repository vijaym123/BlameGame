Remembering our heroes this
Memorial Day
We
all owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to those who have answered the
call to defend our great nation, and especially on Memorial Day as we
pause to remember those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for the
freedoms that we as Americans enjoy today.
As your
representative in Congress, I will continue to be a vocal advocate for all of those
who have dutifully served our nation.
In keeping with that
pledge, last week I helped pass legislation to improve accountability at
the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA), which has failed to meet
its mission of taking care of our nation's heroes when they return
home.
This was an important first step to bringing reform and
accountability to the VA, however, there is still much work to be
done.
I have dire concerns about the mismanagement and lack of leadership
at the VA.
Inexcusable stories have recently surfaced about
secret waiting lists and denied care at VA hospitals around the country
that led to numerous deaths of American veterans. The Obama
Administration's failure to address these dire findings is outrageous and
completely unacceptable.
Our veterans, including the more than 50,000
who live in Louisianas First Congressional District, have made
incredible sacrifices for our country and deserve the best medical care
possible.
Defending
freedom of speech
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) just announced that it will
scrap and rewrite a proposed rule that stifles free speech for non-profit
social and civic organizations.
This is an admission that the
IRSs targeting of certain organizations for the political beliefs of
their members was wrong.
The IRS should completely abandon any
attempt to rewrite these longstanding rules, and they need to
immediately abandon their partisan efforts to harass American taxpayers.
Earlier this year, I, along with 80 members of the Republican Study
Committee, submitted a
public comment
urging the IRS
to abandon this proposed rule. No administration, regardless of
party, should use the IRS or any federal agency to punish their political
enemies. I will continue to defend the First Amendment Rights of
Americans and fight any attempt by President Obama's IRS to stifle free
speech.
Protecting
taxpayer dollars
Tucked away in a dark corner of Obamacare is a provision,
which allows the president to bail out insurance companies if they
incur too much financial loss.
Although Present Obama blasted the
influence of the insurance industry in health care, he now plans to
funnel them taxpayer money to make up for their financial losses due to
the devastating consequences of his signature law.
This is one
of the big failures of Obamacare in which the White House is trying to
bully insurance companies to lowball prices with the promise that
they will be bail them out with taxpayer dollars for any lost
costs.
This is one of the many failures of Obamacare in which the White
House is trying to hide the fact that prices are skyrocketing under
Obamacare, at the same time that they want to secretly send the bill for
those failures to hard-working taxpayers.

Cleaning up nicely
Hammond just received Louisianas Cleanest City
award.
Id like to congratulate Mayor Mayson Foster, his
administration and the people of Hammond on earning the distinction of
Louisianas Cleanest City for the eighth consecutive year! With just one visit
to the beautiful city of Hammond, youll see why they have built this
hard-earned reputation for high standards of cleanliness.
The
well-kept parks, residential areas, streets and sidewalks always look
pristine.
This distinction reflects the great pride the people of
Hammond have for their community. Great
job!
It is an honor to represent you
in Congress.
