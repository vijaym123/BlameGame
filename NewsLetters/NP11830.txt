Coming Up: Veterans' Service Fair on March 10
I will host a Veterans' Service Fair on
Monday,
March 10.
All veterans in the Sixth District of Virginia are invited to attend.
The event will take place from 10am to 12pm at
American Legion Post 16 located at 1301 Greenview Drive in Lynchburg.
The Veterans&rsquo; Service Fair is designed to help better connect local
veterans to the many services available in our region.
If you know any veterans, I encourage you to let them know about this upcoming
event! Washington Roundup Here's a quick review of some of the legislative action in the House of Representatives this
week: House Takes Up Bills to Stop
Government Abuse :
This week, the House of
Representatives took up, and passed, 12 bills in an effort to stop government abuse and reduce the regulatory burden on working families and small
businesses.
These bills were born from concerns voiced by the American people, and address topics ranging from reducing the impact of federal
mandates to protecting private property rights.
No one wins
with excessive, unnecessary regulation, especially not the American people.
The effects are real for American families who witness the government
digging deeper and deeper into their pocketbooks and face higher prices, fewer job opportunities, and a less competitive America.
Stopping government
abuse is critical to restoring trust in the federal government, protecting the liberties our nation was founded upon, and returning America to
prosperity.
