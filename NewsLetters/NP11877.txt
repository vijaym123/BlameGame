What would you do to
fix the broken tax code?
Have you had enough of Washington
and our broken tax code?
Our federal government is living
way beyond its means. Spending cuts can get us
halfway
to a balanced budget but we need a much stronger economy to balance
the budget and start paying down this debt. To jump-start the economy
we need a
simpler, fairer
tax code that
protects taxpayers, not special interests, and that helps America compete
and win.
After three
years of intensive work by the Ways and Means Committee I sit on, last
week our Chairman, Dave Camp, released the first
top to bottom
rewrite
of Americas tax code since Ronald Reagan was
President. Its a
discussion draft , and a unique
invitation to have your voice heard on a critical issue.
Unlike the
Affordable Care Act that was assembled in secrecy, we are counting on the
your input to make this reform even better.
This draft tax reform will boost the
economy by over
$3 trillion
and create nearly
2 million new American jobs . It will also put
about
$1,300 back into the pocket of the average American
family . It shrinks the tax code by a quarter and will allow
nine out of ten taxpayers to file their taxes without itemizing. It
provides a tax cut for the middle class and repeals the Alternative
Minimum Tax. It doesnt add a dime to the deficit and doesnt raise taxes to
bail out Washingtons spending problem.
But is
there more work to be done?
Yes, and I want to hear your
ideas.
Take a look at the
draft , think about how it will affect your family and business, and then
fill out my
T ax Reform Draft
Survey . Im going to need help from people like you if
we hope to rein in the IRS and fix this broken tax code. Let me know
what you think.
White
House Report Says Premiums Will
Rise
Last weeks non-partisan Center for
Medicare and Medicaid Services report showed that health care premiums
will
increase for two thirds of small businesses
due to
the misnamed Affordable Care Act. But on June 6, 2009, President Obama
said,
'The only change you'll se are falling costs as our reforms
take hold,'
during a weekly address in which he was outlining
the goals of his health care law. That just doesn't add
up.
I think we can chalk this up to
just
another broken promise
the President made in order
to sell this
badly written, incompetently-implemented travesty of
a law .
American
families and businesses have been misled by the White House long enough. The
Affordable Care Act continues to cause more harm than good and now the
White House administration's own reports have documented that as a
face. We need health insurance reform that makes health care more
affordable and more accessible for all Americans and we can start by
r epealing the law that is having the opposite
effect.
More Power to Taxpayers,
Less Power to the IRS
American families and businesses deserve better than a
government that
stifles their voices, wastes their tax dollars
and abuses their constitutional rights . Enough is
enough.
Last week, the U.S. House
passed a series of bills that had a simple goal -
more power to
taxpayers, less power for government agencies like the
IRS.
One of these bills will protect
taxpayers from drawn out IRS investigations and audits, and
keep them from asking taxpayers inappropriate questions . Another
bill that we passed will require every federal agency to provide to
taxpayers an
annual report card
for each of its programs,
including the total administrative costs, how many people they have on staff
and who many people benefit from their
programs.
We also passed legislation that will
allow cell phone owners to legally
'unlock'
their phone after satisfying their contract without fear of being
prosecuted. Federal IT programs will be streamlined under another bill, so
that taxpayer dollars are no longer wasted under duplicative
programs. These
common-sense
bills
will hold federal agencies more accountable when it comes to how they
use your tax dollars and how they treat you -
the
taxpayer.
Speaking of the
IRS...
Last
week, the House also passed the
Stop Targeting of Political
Beliefs by the IRS Act . As the Ways and Means Committee
continues to investigate the IRS, the evidence has made it increasingly
clear that this rogue agency specifically targeted conservative
organizations and their donors. We're far from done combing through the
tens of thousands
of IRS documents or interviewing all of the
employees involved, and we won't stop until we have the answers you
deserve and those who broke the law are
held
accountable.
However, the IRS has
responded by trying to pass new rules for 501(c)(4)s that would
effectively silence
their ability to participate in our democratic process
as any citizen should. They claim it's too clear up any confusion, but
make no mistake -
these rules are about
intimidation.
Your
ability to redress your government is a sacred right protected by the
First Amendment.
Whether you are a Republican or
Democrat, Tea Party or progressive, the government has no right to stifle
your voice and House Republicans are determined to stop this
now.
Cutting Through the
Red Tape
Local businesses are suffocating in red tape. It stifles their
ability to
grow their business and hire more workers . In
our current economic environment, the last thing we need is more
regulations flowing out of Washington, especially when we don't really know
what their true economic impact is before they're
implemented.
In fact, out of
3,708
new federal rules that were issued in 2012, only
14
had a full analysis done of their impact on the economy.
That's not acceptable.
Last week, the House passed a package of bills that
reins in the red tape and requires federal agencies to be more open with
the American people about their regulations plans. It also
closed
the loopholes
agencies use to avoid analyzing the economic damage
new regulations might cause. Included was an amendment I proposed that
will requires federal agencies to disclose early to the public the
goals of proposed new regulations and how they will measure their
success in reaching them. Simply put, my amendment directs regulators to
' tell us your objective, tell us how you're going to measure
it, and then tell us you actually did what you
promised.'
This stops their ability to keep the American public and local
businesses in the dark when it comes to red tape.
In case you
didn't detect the theme on Capitol Hill last week, it was Stop
Government Abuse! House Republicans stood beside the American public and
declared, "Enough, is enough!" Law-abiding Americans should have no reason
to fear their government and we will continue to do what we can to
empower and protect you, while limiting the federal government's role in
your every day life.

The timing to lay down this draft was long overdue. This code
is costly, complex and unfair.
