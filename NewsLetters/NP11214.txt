National Ag
Day is Tuesday Many days, long before the sun rises and long after the sun sets, farmers across the nation are hard at work producing the food and fiber
products we rely upon.
From the very foundation of the United States to the present day, these hardworking farmers and ranchers have held a place at
the core of our economy.
As we mark
National Ag Day
on Tuesday, March 25th, I hope that all Americans will take a moment to reflect on the tremendous
contributions our nation&rsquo;s agriculture industry has made to our economy, communities, and American way of life. It is only fitting that while we honor the role of agriculture in America we also
commemorate the 100th anniversary of the national Cooperative Extension System.
The Cooperative Extension System utilizes the resources of Virginia's
land-grant universities, Virginia Tech and Virginia State University, to provide helpful information, education, and tools to assist agricultural
producers, business owners, young people, and communities. I am a cosponsor of a
resolution
in the House of Representatives honoring the signing of
the Smith-Lever Act of 1914 that established this system many of us benefit from daily.
Farming has never been an easy way of life, but it is essential to our economy, our national security, our
health, and our prosperity.
As Vice Chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, I understand the importance of ensuring that the federal
government does not make it even more difficult for American agriculture to continue producing abundant and affordable food and fiber products. The
hard work and dedication of America&rsquo;s agriculture industry is something to be celebrated every day. I hope you will join me in saying thank you.
