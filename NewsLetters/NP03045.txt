VISITING
DC
January 30, 2015
This week the
Senate passed, 62-36, the Keystone XL pipeline legislation.
I am
proud that this job-creating legislation passed the Senate in a
bipartisan manner that allowed for lengthy debate and votes on many
amendments.
This is how the Senate should run. It is my hope that the
President does not ignore the wishes of the majority of Americans and
signs this bill into law when it reaches his desk.
During the
amendment process, I introduced
an amendment to
permanently fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF),
which I
mentioned in last weeks newsletter.
On Tuesday evening, I took
to the floor to talk about the importance of LWCF. You can watch my
remarks
here
or below.
Yesterday, the Senate voted on my amendment
and it received 59 votes, sending a clear signal that the Senate
supports a permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation
Fund (LWCF). While the amendment needed 60 votes in order to meet a
procedural hurdle, it proved that a bipartisan majority of the Senate
supports the LWCF.
My colleagues and I have all seen LWCF
protect iconic sites in our states, and I believe most of us can agree that
the LWCF is the best dollar-for-dollar conservation program this body
has ever created.
I will continue to champion this worthy
program.
Thursday, Senator Alexander and I released a report on
the challenges to getting safe treatments, devices, and cures to
patients more quickly and effectively, examining what is working, and what
isnt, at the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes
of Health.
For decades, our nation has led the world in
medical innovation, but the challenges of maintaining this edge have
never been greater. Our report, Innovation for Healthier Americans, asks
a simple but critical question
how can we do it better?
We
are in an exciting era of medicine that holds tremendous potential to
improve treatments and outcomes for patients.
But to realize this
potential, we must ensure that our nations discovery and development
processes are working as well as possible.
I am committed to
working with my colleagues to ensure that the work of North Carolinas
researchers and innovators is reaching Americas patients in as timely a
manner as possible, so that patients across our nation are able to
benefit from cutting-edge medical products. Read more about the
Innovation for Healthier Americans report
here .
Finally, on Tuesday the HELP committee held a hearing on fixing No
Child Left Behind. During the hearing, I had a chance to hear from
and question educators, administrators, and experts in the education
field. You can watch the questioning period
here
or
below and the full hearing
here .
Sincerely,
Richard
Burr
