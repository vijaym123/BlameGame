Dear Friend,
I hope this year has been a special year for you! As always, the Christmas season is an extraordinary time: a time to enjoy our families; a time to give back to our communities; and a time of reflection. My staff and I have had the pleasure of meeting with and assisting many of you this past year. Serving you continues to be the highlight of my time in Congress.
Moving forward into the New Year, we each have the unique opportunity of making our communities stronger and working together on important issues. Together, we can make our State and our Country a better place to live, to work, and to raise our families. I look forward to your continued input, support, and feedback in this coming year.
Scripture reminds us that this is a season of Joy and Hope as we see in Jeremiah 29:11For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans to prosper you and not to harm you; plans to give you a future and a hope. I wish you all the best in this upcoming year and during this season as we celebrate the birth of our Savior.
To all of you, have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
God Bless,
Gregg Harper
