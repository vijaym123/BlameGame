Dear
Friend,
I'd like to update you on some of the work we've been doing on
legislation and in the District this week.
Secret Science Goes to the
Floor
On Tuesday, we hosted a
full Committee hearing in the House Committee on Science, Space, and
Technology to markup my bill, the Secret Science Reform Act of 2014.
The bill passed committee and is now one step closer to
becoming law.
Since the law was introduced,
we have received
letters of
support
from over 80 scientists and
experts, 30 trade associations, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the former
head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, the former
head of the EPAs Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, and the
California Construction Trucking
Association.
This movement of the
legislation is a big step toward transparency for the American
people.
Public policy should be made by public
data.
You have the right
to know what science is behind the EPA's rules and
regulations.
Stay tuned for more updates!
Lies Are Not a Strong Foundation for Our
Veterans
We've heard
in recent news
that the Phoenix
VA Health Care System (PVACHS) Administrators lied in previous
interviews and reports about their knowledge of faulty scheduling practices.
Unfortunately, I can't say I'm surprised. That's why I co-signed the
Veterans Access to Care Act of 2014, H.R.
4810 .
The bill directs the Secretary of
the VA to enter into contracts with non-Department facilities to provide
care for eligible covered veterans who have waited longer than the
wait-time goals of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). I think
it's time we reconsider the options we're giving to our
Veterans.
It pains me to know that people put in leadership positions and
trusted with the care of veterans were able and willing to lie about
their involvement in this tragedy. The sooner we change how our
veterans are cared for, the sooner we can solve this
problem.
I hope this
revelation at PVAHCS can be a spark of insight for our interim VA
Secretary, Sloan Gibson. He has visited our facilities here in Phoenix and
seen the reports that weve all seen. It is time those responsible are
held accountable.
Valley Fever is Added to the
GAIN Act
In last 18 months,
the Valley Fever Congressional Task Force has spread the word about a
disease specific to the southwestvalley fever. Thanks to the efforts
of scientists, doctors, and advocates with whom we have worked hand in
hand, the spore that causes valley fever, coccidioides,
has been added to the list of pathogens under the Generating
Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN)
Act.
The decision by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to
add coccidioides to the list of qualifying pathogens is a big win for
our constituents suffering from this disease. The FDAs decision
will encourage the development of an effective treatment and vaccine for
this disease.
I look
forward to seeing what the medical community will accomplish as a result of
this good news and hope that our work in the task force can continue
to be a resource for those in our communities who suffer from this
illness.
As always, thank you for taking the time to read what we're up to back
home and in D.C. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on these
important issues!
If I can ever be of service to you or your family, let
my team and me know.
Sincerely,
Where We've Been
