Working
With Israel to Prevent a Nuclear
Iran
Dear
Friend,
Last Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu addressed a joint
meeting of Congress.
It
was a great honor
to have Prime
Minister Netanyahu come to the United
States and speak to both Houses of
Congress.
During his address, the Prime Minister
reaffirmed the importance of a strong
alliance between the United States and
Israel. Welcoming Prime Minister Netanyahu
was a vital step in solidifying our bond
with Israel and reaffirming our unwavering
commitment to provide the support necessary
to preserve Israels security and
protect American interests. As we all work
to see freedom and stability in the Middle
East, maintaining a strong strategic
alliance with Israel - our greatest ally in
the region - is of critical importance.
Prime Minister Netanyahus remarks
also provided a stark reminder of the
maliciousness that is central to
Irans global agenda. One of the
gravest threats facing the world is the
prospect of the Iranian regime attaining
the capability to produce a nuclear weapon.
It must be the policy of the United States
to do everything within our power to
prevent this from happening. For decades,
Iran has unequivocally stated its desire to
see the complete destruction of the United
States and our ally Israel. While Iran
insists that it seeks the development of a
nuclear program for peaceful domestic
purposes, it instead works in the shadows
to develop weapons capable of wielding mass
destruction.
Iran and the P5+1 nations, which include
the United States, China, France, Germany,
Russia, and the United Kingdom, wrapped up
another round of negotiations last
Wednesday and failed, yet again, to resolve
negotiations surrounding Irans
nuclear program. This should not come as a
surprise. It is just another indication
that Iran is not interested in negotiating
in good faith to terminate its nuclear
program. Instead, the Iranian regime is
taking advantage of the lenience of many
world leaders to evade economic sanctions,
which to this point have been critically
successful in hindering the regime's
nefarious shadow operations.
Iran has been unwilling to make
necessary compromises, and there is little
reason to believe this will change. We must
not make any short-sighted concessions to
the Iranian regime just for the sake of
making a deal. Rather, we should impose the
full force of economic sanctions authorized
by Congress to maintain pressure on Iran to
abandon its nuclear aspirations.
Congress has a vital obligation to
conduct rigorous oversight of the
Administrations negotiations with
Iran because allowing Iran to achieve the
nuclear capabilities it seeks would pose an
existential threat not only to Israel, but
to the world. I am grateful for Prime
Minister Netanyahus leadership in
the effort to prevent a nuclear Iran and
offering the American people the
opportunity to receive his invaluable
perspective on these critical issues. I
remain committed to enhancing the necessary
sanctions against the Iranian regime and to
doing everything within our power to keep
Iran from gaining nuclear capabilities.
