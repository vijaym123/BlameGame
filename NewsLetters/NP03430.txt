Friends,
With a new year comes a new session of Congress,
and new era of governing in Washington.
The American people sent
us a clear message that they want to us work together and start
solving problems in DC. So we got right down to business and started the new
Congress by passing bills that have the support of my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle, and in both the House and the Senate. Here's a
few things that happened in the first week of
Congress.
Sworn In
With my family by my
side, I was honored to be sworn in on Tuesday with my colleagues to
serve you for another two years. Representing you in Congress is the
highest honor of my life and I appreciate your faith in
me.
Honored to be sworn in to serve
you.
Hire More
Heroes Act
One of the first things we
did in Congress was pass
H.R. 22 ,
the Hire More Heroes Act. This bill exempts veterans who already
receive health insurance through the Veterans Affairs Department, or
reservists covered under Tricare, from being counted toward the number of
employees that triggers the employer mandate under ObamaCare.
This is a common sense change that makes it easier for businesses to hire
veterans, so it was good to see nearly everyone in the House, from
both sides of the aisle, come together to support this
bill.
Protecting Our Great
Lakes
Last Congress, I introduced a bill to formally authorize the
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a series of programs designed to
preserve and protect our Great Lakes, for the next five years. It passed
through the House but died in the Senate before the end of Congress. So
I re-introduced the same legislation again on Thursday. The Great
Lakes are an environmental treasure and an economic behemoth for our
region, providing drinking water for over 40 million people and generating
$62 billion in wages from the 1.5 million jobs that are directly
connected to them. Plain and simple, the Great Lakes need to be protected,
so I acted immediately to make sure this bill gets through the House
again.
Signing the Great Lakes Restoration
Initiative Act of
2015
Keystone XL Pipeline
It
has been 2,305 days since the Keystone XL Pipeline has been submitted.
Approval of the Keystone Pipeline would create over 40,000 jobs and
help make America more energy independent by moving 830,000 barrels of
oil per day. Theres no more excuses, its time to build the pipeline
and create jobs, so I voted to approve the pipeline on
Friday.
It was a busy and productive week and I look forward to
continuing serving Ohios 14th Congressional District in the 114th
session of the United States Congress.
Thank you
for the opportunity to represent you,
Dave
