Righting a 160-Year-Old Wrong - Fond du Lac Bill to Become Law
Well over 90 years of age, Chief Buffalo traveled more than 1000 miles
by birch bark canoe and rail to begin negotiations on the land Treaty
of 1854 with President Millard Fillmore.
Dear Friend,
With Minnesota Senators Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar leading the way,
the U.S. Senate last week passed the long-awaited Fond du Lac land
exchange bill I authored in the House - clearing the way for the
President to sign the measure and help fix the broken Treaty of 1854 by
returning lands to the Fond du Lac Band of Ojibwe illegally settled
following the agreement.
In exchange, Carlton County will receive non-reservation land currently
owned by the Band. The County will gain valuable new timber resources,
and the Band will have the additional acres they need to build much
needed tribal housing.
The 160-year history of this treaty includes the amazing story of Chief
Buffalo, who in his 90s traveled from what is now La Pointe, Wisconsin,
up the St. Lawrence to New York City in a birch bark canoe - then on to
Washington, D.C. by rail - to gain support for the land agreement from
President Millard Fillmore. (You can read a more detailed account here
.)
When he was asked why he'd made such a long and difficult journey, he
simply said, "My people are starving to death. I need to do everything
I can to save them."
As of today, President Obama has signed just 84 bills from the 113th
Congress into law. I'm proud to say that with this one, two will
include my name.
I walk by Chief Buffalo's statue in the U.S. Capitol every day on my
way to the House Floor. Last week, I could swear I saw a look of peace
and approval.

before we passed the bill earlier this year.
Have a great week.
Sincerely,

Drive Builds to Restore Emergency Unemployment Assistance
to 200,000 Veterans
More than 160 Members of Congress crowded the halls on Wednesday
afternoon to sign a discharge petition that would force a vote on
extending emergency unemployment benefits to two million Americans.
With the House Majority still refusing to allow a vote to restore
emergency unemployment benefits to some two million Americans -
including 200,000 veterans - out of work through no fault of their own,
we launched an historic effort last week to force the issue.
It's called a discharge petition. Simply put, when a majority (218 out
of 435) of members of the House sign the document, rules require
Leadership to bring the matter to the House Floor for a vote. We are
still a handful of supporters away, and I'm working hard to put us over
the top.
Unemployment insurance isn't welfare or charity. It's an insurance
policy, paid for by employers to help workers, during slowdowns in
business, transition from one job to another. As our nation struggles
to recover from the worst recession since the Great Depression, we owe
our fellow citizens - including the heroes who have put themselves in
harm's way to protect and serve us - the emergency help they need until
they can return to productive employment.

To Keep Grand Rapids Kids Safe, An Act of Congress
Grand Rapids' middle school parents would have a safe, school bus-free
zone to drop off and pick up their kids as the result of a federal land
swap bill I introduced last week in the House, with support from
Senators Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar on the Senate side.
For years, the city and School District 318 have been negotiating a
land swap with the federal government in order to construct a safer
pick up and drop off area at the Robert J. Elkington Middle School. I
introduced the measure after meetings with Superintendent Bruce Thomas,
Grand Rapids councilors, and city administrators. Now we plan to move
quickly on both the House and Senate sides to get this done.
Coming from a former teacher, the civics lesson is this: The work of
Congress is not always about matters of great national and
international significance. The truly important work we do frequently
involves solving problems that affect safety and quality of life for
the people we are privileged to represent.

Our Week in Pictures
Addressed a roomful of representatives of the Minnesota League of
Cities, whose advocacy in Washington helps keep Minnesota's cities the
envy of the nation.
Met with members of LIUNA - the Laborers' International Union of North
America - in town for the Building and Construction Trades Department
Legislative Conference, and discussed good-paying union jobs within the
upcoming Highway Bill.
I discussed post-acute hospital care and rehab options for spinal cord
injuries with Skip Silvestrini, MD, and Marcia Hermann Johnson, both of
Essentia Health in Duluth.
The Ambassador to the U.S. from Liechtenstein, Claudia Fritsche, was on
Capitol Hill, and we had a brief but riveting chat on international
trade (you can bet the ongoing TPP negotiations came up).
The current International President of Lions Club International,
Minnesota's own Mike Molenda, stopped by to tell me of the terrific
work they're doing to end disease and poverty across the world. In a
partnership with the Gates Foundation, they've saved millions of lives
by vaccinating over 3 million children.
Met with Scott Thompson, Craig Olson, and Cindy Olson of the Painters
Union (IUPAT) to discuss making the minimum wage a working wage by
raising it to at least $10.10 an hour.

Finally...
Hotdish Contest Produces Heated Exchange
At the cook off with Senators Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken, wearing my
Nolan family crest apron in honor of St. Patrick's Day. All ten members
of the Minnesota Congressional delegation participated in this fun and
festive event, designed to foster bipartisan cooperation and progress
on non-hotdish related matters important to Minnesota and the nation.
Congratulations to Congressman Tim Walz on winning the prize for the
second year in a row - prompting a bipartisan call from the rest of us
to replace the judges - former Minnesota Congressmen Vin Weber and
Gerry Sikorski. Seriously, though - they do a great job of judging
every year.
My recipe is below. Feel free to try it and let me know what YOU think.
Nolan's Ranger's Hunting Camp Hotdish
The 2014 Nolan Hunting Camp
The Legend
Deep in the piney woods of Crow Wing County, near where the Big Pine
and Little Pine Rivers meet, lies a hunting camp known only to
Congressman Rick Nolan, his ancestors, and his descendants. On the
Opening Day of Deer Season - a Nolan family national holiday - the
hunters gather, as they have for more than a century, to prepare and
enjoy a hotdish so darn good they swear every forkful adds a day to
their lives. Kinda like fishing, if you know what we mean.

1 strip thick cut bacon - chopped and cooked by Rick
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, chopped

3. Cover the cook the wild rice in 2 cups organic chicken broth.

Righting

Well
over
90

Chief
Buffalo
traveled
more
than
1000
miles
by
birch
bark
canoe
and
rail
to
begin
negotiations
on
the
land
Treaty
of
1854
with
President
Millard

Dear
Friend,
With
Minnesota
Senators
Al

and
Amy
Klobuchar
leading
the
way,
the
U.S.
Senate
last

passed
the
long-awaited

who
in

La

up

to
New

in

-
then
on

-
to
gain
support
for
the
land
agreement
from
President
Millard
Fillmore.
(You

When
he
was
asked
why
he'd
made
such
a

he
simply
said,
"My

-

we
launched
an
historic
effort
last
week
to
force
the

It's
called
a

Simply
put,
when
a

(218

members
of
the

sign
the
document,
rules
require
Leadership
to
bring

a
vote.
We
are
still
a
handful
of
supporters
away,
and
I'm

to
put
us
over
the

Unemployment

As

we
owe
our
fellow

-
including
the
heroes
who
have
put
themselves
in

to
protect
and
serve
us
-
the
emergency
help
they
need
until
they
can
return
to
productive
employment.
To
Keep
Grand

Kids
Safe,
An
Act
of

Grand

middle

parents
would
have
a

school
bus-free

to
drop
off
and
pick
up
their
kids
as
the
result
of
a
federal
land

bill
I
introduced
last
week
in
the
House,
with
support
from
Senators
Al
Franken
and
Amy
Klobuchar
on
the
Senate
side.
For
years,
the
city
and
School
District
318
have
been
negotiating
a
land
swap
with
the
federal
government
in
order
to
construct
a
safer
pick
up
and
drop
off
area
at
the
Robert
J.
Elkington
Middle
School.
I
introduced
the
measure
after
meetings
with
Superintendent
Bruce
Thomas,
Grand
Rapids
councilors,
and
city
administrators.
Now
we
plan
to
move
quickly
on
both
the
House
and
Senate
sides
to
get
this
done.
Coming
