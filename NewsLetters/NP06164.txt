We're running out of time. Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s set to unleash a
$1.85 MILLION
ad campaign against Brad -- the biggest ad buy of the election so far.
Here's what that means: our goals just skyrocketed. And now we need 141 more donations tonight to keep pace with Boehner&rsquo;s deceitful attack ads.
If we don't hit this goal, we could be in serious trouble. We hate to ask you again -- but can you chip in for Brad before midnight? Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks,
