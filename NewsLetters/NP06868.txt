Dear Friend,
We already know the Tea Party House will stop at nothing to get what it wants. Now, obstructionists in the Senate are threatening another government shutdown if they win in November.
This isn&rsquo;t some vague threat -- it&rsquo;s an explicit guarantee. If they take over the Senate in November, they&rsquo;re going to make shutdown politics an everyday occurrence. That&rsquo;s a disaster waiting to happen for the middle class. We cannot allow the Republicans to pick up a seat here in Massachusetts -- we can&rsquo;t afford another $24 billion shutdown. Give $5, $10, or whatever you can afford to keep us strong going into November.

The Tea Party House has repeatedly demonstrated that it&rsquo;s much more interested in litigation than legislation, voting last month to sue the President for doing his job. And while my Republican colleagues said that they had learned their lesson after following Ted Cruz and shutting down the government, it&rsquo;s clear they haven&rsquo;t learned a thing.
I need to make this clear --
Republicans are
promising
more shutdowns if they win in November.
They&rsquo;re guaranteeing that if they win, they&rsquo;re going to double down on the my-way-or-the-highway politics that already wasted $24 billion. If this doesn&rsquo;t get Democrats&rsquo; attention this fall, I&rsquo;m not sure what will. Help me keep fighting with a $5 contribution.
Thank you.
