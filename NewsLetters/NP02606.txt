Dear Friends,
A few hours ago, I joined my colleagues at the state Capitol for Governor Rauner&rsquo;s budget address. For weeks, the governor has given us general concepts on how he thinks we can solve our budget crisis without going into much detail on how this would be done. Today, he delivered those details.
The governor laid out a spending plan that relies on deep cuts and the elimination of many programs that help the disabled, children and low-income families. He also wants to slash funding for Illinois&rsquo; universities and community colleges, as well as make deep cuts to public transportation funding.
I have some serious concerns with the governor&rsquo;s proposals, to say the least. Relying on cuts that impact those least able to afford it doesn&rsquo;t say a lot about the morals and priorities we as a people live by.
Over the next few months, we are going to be learning more about what the governor&rsquo;s plan means to real people. Please take my
Budget Survey
and tell me your thoughts on the governor&rsquo;s proposal and what priorities are important for you and your family.
As always, if I can ever be of any assistance, please do not hesitate to
contact me .
Sincerely,
Senator Toi Hutchinson
