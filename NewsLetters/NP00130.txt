ABOUT
ISSUES
Ive only been in Congress for six months and I cannot believe what
Senator Harry Reid said. Last week, Harry Reid said that passing a
national defense spending bill was a waste of time. I couldnt
disagree more.
This bill provides the funds for critical medical supplies, food, body
armor, ammunition and more. Taking care of our troops and making sure
they have all available resources to stay safe on the battlefield
should be priority number one for Congress. Unfortunately, for Harry
Reids party, its not even on the short list.
Senator Harry Reid didnt just say it was a waste of time though; he
is even encouraging his followers in the House and the Senate to vote
against the bill in an effort to get more funding for big government
agencies like the EPA and the IRS.
Last week, I proudly voted for a defense funding bill that gives our
troops the resources they need and the pay raises that they deserve.
Unfortunately the reach of partisan politics in this city even
overshadows fundamental American values like keeping our soldiers,
airmen, marines and sailors safe at a time when ISIS is on the rise,
and the President has admitted he has no strategy to defeat the
terrorist organization.
Ive heard some in Reids ranks say that they arent voting for the
funding because it ignores the real cost of war. Well, I know the
REAL cost of war.
I was a U.S. Navy SEAL for 23 years. Ive seen the
bravest our nation has to offer, give everything they have to offer and
pay the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our freedom. THATS the real
cost of war.
One-in-10 Montanans served our nation in the military, and those who
didnt probably know and love somebody who did.
Nobody needs to tell
us how important adequately funding our troops is. We know it because
we live it.
In Montana, we take care of our veterans and our active
duty service members.
As the only veteran in Montanas Congressional Delegation, I see it as
my duty to be an outspoken advocate of our veterans and active duty
personnel. Thats why I will always fight to make sure they are as safe
as possible on the battlefield and well cared for when they come home.
It is my hope that Senator Harry Reid and his followers will drop their
political games and give our troops the resources they need and the pay
raises that they deserve.
God bless America, and God bless the men and women who defend her.

ABOUT
ISSUES
I&#146;ve
only
been
in
Congress
for
six
months
and
I
cannot
believe
what
Senator
Harry
Reid
said.
Last
week,
Harry
Reid
said
that
passing
a
national
defense
spending
bill
was
a
&#147;waste
of
time.&#148;
I
couldn&#146;t
disagree
more.
This
bill
provides
the
funds
for
critical
medical
supplies,
food,
body
armor,
ammunition
and
more.
Taking
care
of
our
troops
and
making
sure
they
have
all
available
resources
to
stay
safe
on
the
battlefield
should
be
priority
number
one
for
Congress.
Unfortunately,
for
Harry
Reid&#146;s
party,
it&#146;s
not
even
on
the
short
list.
Senator
Harry
Reid
didn&#146;t
just
say
it
was
a
&#147;waste
of
time&#148;
though;
he
is
even
encouraging
his
followers
in
the
House
and
the
Senate
to
vote
against
the
bill
in
an
effort
to
get
more
funding
for
big
government
agencies
like
the
EPA
and
the
IRS.
Last
week,
I
proudly
voted
for
a
defense
funding
bill
that
gives
our
troops
the
resources
they
need
and
the
pay
raises
that
they
deserve.
Unfortunately
the
reach
of
partisan
politics
in
this
city
even
overshadows
fundamental
American
values
like
keeping
our
soldiers,
airmen,
marines
and
sailors
safe
at
a
time
when
ISIS
is
on
the
rise,
and
the
President
has
admitted
he
has
no
strategy
to
defeat
the
terrorist
organization.
I&#146;ve
heard
some
in
Reid&#146;s
ranks
say
that
they
aren&#146;t
voting
for
the
funding
because
it
ignores
the
&#147;real
cost
of
war.&#148;
Well,
I
know
the
REAL
cost
of
war.
I
was
a
U.S.
Navy
SEAL
for
23
years.
I&#146;ve
seen
the
bravest
our
nation
has
to
offer,
give
everything
they
have
to
offer
and
pay
the
ultimate
sacrifice
in
defense
of
our
freedom.
THAT&#146;S
the
&#147;real
cost
of
war.&#148;
One-in-10
Montanans
served
our
nation
in
the
military,
and
those
who
didn&#146;t
probably
know
and
love
somebody
who
did.
Nobody
needs
to
tell
us
how
important
adequately
funding
our
troops
is.
We
know
it
because
we
live
it.
In
Montana,
we
take
care
of
our
veterans
and
our
active
duty
service
members.
As
the
only
veteran
in
Montana&#146;s
Congressional
Delegation,
I
see
it
as
my
duty
to
be
an
outspoken
advocate
of
our
veterans
and
active
duty
personnel.
That&#146;s
why
I
will
always
fight
to
make
sure
they
are
as
safe
as
possible
on
the
battlefield
and
well
cared
for
when
they
come
home.
It
is
my
hope
that
Senator
Harry
Reid
and
his
followers
will
drop
their
political
games
and
give
our
troops
the
resources
they
need
and
the
pay
raises
that
they
deserve.
God
bless
America,
and
God
bless
the
men
and
women
who
defend
her.
