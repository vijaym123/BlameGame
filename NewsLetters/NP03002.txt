VISITING DC
February 07, 2015
This week, I introduced the
Patient Choice, Affordability, Responsibility, and Empowerment (CARE)
Act
with my congressional colleagues Senate Finance Chairman Orrin
Hatch (R-Utah), and House Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton
(R-Mich.).
The Patient
CARE Act is the first bicameral legislative plan that repeals
Obamacare and replaces it with common-sense, patient-focused reforms that
reduce health care costs and increase access to affordable, high-quality
care.
North
Carolinians have found out the hard way what is in Obamacare -- broken
promises in the form of increased health care costs, costly mandates, and
government bureaucracy. And no, just because you like your healthcare,
you dont necessarily get to keep it. Even if the President said so.
For a year, you have been sending
your
Obamacare stories
about high premiums, lost coverage, and
your personal information being exposed by broken websites . Ive
listened and proposed a blueprint that will in fact, make your
healthcare more affordable.
Our
nations health care system was broken before Obamacare, and the
Presidents health care debacle has only made things worse.
The
Patient CARE Act repeals Obamacare and addresses the fundamental cost
drivers that Obamacare failed to address.
We can lower costs and
expand access to quality coverage and care by empowering individuals and
their families to make their own health care decisions, rather than
having the federal government make those decisions for
them.
Here are a couple of stories on the
Patient CARE Act I recommend:

Thursday , I
introduced legislation with Senator McCaskill (D-MO)
to close a legal loophole that currently
enables sex offenders convicted in the military justice system to
evade registration with the National Sex Offender
Registry.
Recent
Scripps
and
WGHP
reports found that this
loophole has enabled hundreds of convicted sex offenders to avoid
registering and allowed some to commit horrendous crimes
again.
T his gap should have been closed long ago. I hope
Congress will act swiftly to send this legislation to the Presidents
desk before another predator exploits this loophole and strikes
again.
Earlier in the
week, I spoke on the floor about my bill,
S. 338 ,
that would help protect our national landscapes. The LWCF has important
implications for our parks, open spaces, and wildlife habitats. Watch
my floor speech

The Senate unanimously passed
the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act
on Tuesday .
I am proud that the Senate
overwhelmingly passed this bipartisan legislation and finally took action to
address the real problems we have had handling veteran
suicide.
The Clay Hunt Act provides for better access to
information on mental health by improving the exchange of training,
best practices, and other resources among the VA and non-profit mental
health organizations to enhance collaboration of suicide prevention
efforts, as well as including a new website that offers veterans
information on mental health care services.

This week I
appeared on CNN this week as
Chairman of the Intelligence Committee , where I emphasized the
sophistication of the Islamic States operations and funding where I
said, We cant forget
ISIL controls an area within Syria and Iraq that
makes any terrorist training grounds that weve seen up to this point
seem like a playground.
On Monday, the Presidents budget
came out, and he yet again his
budget doesnt
balance . And it never has. It also raises taxes by $2.1 trillion. Thats
a bad deal for Americans.
Sincerely,
Richard Burr
