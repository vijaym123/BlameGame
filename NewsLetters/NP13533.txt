Friend,
Happy holidays and happy almost new year!
I plan to write another e-newsletter in the weeks ahead to wrap up the
past year, but for now I just wanted to write a quick note about the
budget that recently passed through Congress. There were some things
about the proposal that I liked (and some things that I didn't), and in
the end I gave it my vote.
First of all, I like that this deal would avert another government
shutdown which is the last thing our nation needs. I heard from many of
you how it affected your lives and I know we can't afford to let that
happen again.
Any budget that stops us from lurching to crisis to crisis is a step
above the status quo.
I also like that for two years, it replaces some of the damaging
across-the-board cuts that hurt many in our region and it and will
provide a certainty on spending that we haven't seen in years. From my
economic development days, I know the main things businesses look to
government for are trust and predictability and this budget would bring
some of that back to our economy.
There are also certainly things in this budget I'm not a fan of. And
there are things that weren't included that I think should be in there -
like an extension of unemployment insurance. Since this extension isn't
included in the budget, I'm pressing for it happen in a separate
measure and I've called on Speaker Boehner to call the House back in
session immediately so we can get this done for families in our region.
Also, while it will be good for our federal workforce to have relief
from the damaging across-the-board cuts, have some stability, and end
the threats of furloughs and layoffs, I'm concerned that once again the
federal workforce is being asked to make the biggest sacrifices for our
budget. After visiting with folks at the shipyard, at the VA, and at
other federal agencies in our region, I'm concerned we're going to see
a lot of good workers leave and not pursue work in the government
because they don't feel valued.
In a perfect world, I'd like to see a budget that completely ends the
damaging across-the-board cuts that hurt our region, and that reflects
our priorities to invest in things we care about like growing our
economy, creating jobs, reducing the deficit in a responsible way, and
protecting those most vulnerable among us. That's why I'm still pushing
for a big, bipartisan budget that deals with our long-term fiscal
health and grows our economy so we can get folks back to work.
This budget isn't perfect but I'm encouraged that both sides have found
a way to compromise. It's also my hope that after a budget deal, both
sides will have an incentive to come to the table and start discussing
ways to move things forward in the coming year.
Special kudos to our own US Senator Patty Murray who put in countless
hours to work on this budget and who demonstrated that compromise is
possible in our nation's capital.
It's long past time for Congress to put aside partisan bickering and
start focusing on getting things done for the American people.
Kilmer at Your Company
On Tuesday, I spoke at a meeting of the Bremerton Chamber of Commerce
to give them an update on what's going on in Congress and so I could
hear what's on their minds.
Part of the reason I do outreach to employers in our region is because
we've got to get our economy cooking again. My background is in
economic development - my job used to be meeting with businesses to
figure out how to help them expand and hire more workers.
One of the ways I outreach to employers is by doing "Kilmer at Your
Company" events. During these events, I typically receive a tour or
speak briefly with the heads of businesses, but I'm also accessible to
the employees as well so I can hear what's on their minds.
I try to get a sense of the good, the bad, and the ugly regarding how
employers interact with the federal government. If there's something
that's causing our region to have problems hiring new workers or
expanding small businesses, I want to know about it so I can work on it
at the federal level.
I've held over 50 of these types of meetings so far and in the coming
year I plan to continue that pace. If you have a suggestion of a
company I should visit for a "Kilmer at Your Company" event, if you'd
like me to visit your place of work, or if you just have an idea you'd
like to share, please don't hesitate to email me.
Thanks as always for reading.
I wish you happy holidays and a happy
new year.
Sincerely,
Derek

2013 Friend,
Happy
holidays
and
happy
almost
new
year!
I
plan
to
write
another
e-newsletter
in
the
weeks
ahead
to
wrap
up
the
past
year,
but
for
now
I
just
wanted
to
write
a
quick
note
about
the
budget
that
recently
passed
through
Congress. There
were
some
things
about
the
proposal
that
I
liked
(and
some
things
that
I
didn&#8217;t),
and
in
the
end
I
gave
it
my
vote.
First
of
all,
I
like
that
this
deal
would
avert
another
government
shutdown
which
is
the
last
thing
our
nation
needs.
I
heard
from
many
of
you
how
it
affected
your
lives
and
I
know
we
can&#8217;t
afford
to
let
that
happen
again.
Any
budget
that
stops
us
from
lurching
to
crisis
to
crisis
is
a
step
above
the
status
quo.
I
also
like
that
for
two
years,
it
replaces
some
of
the
damaging
across-the-board
cuts
that
hurt
many
in
our
region
and
it
and
will
provide
a
certainty
on
spending
that
we
haven&#8217;t
seen
in
years. From
my
economic
development
days,
I
know
the
main
things
businesses
look
to
government
for
are
trust
and
predictability
and
this
budget
would
bring
some
of
that
back
to
our
economy.
There
are
also
certainly
things
in
this
budget
I&#8217;m
not
a
fan
of.
And
there
are
things
that
weren&#8217;t
included
that
I
think
should
be
in
there
&#8211;
like
an
extension
of
unemployment
insurance.
Since
this
extension
isn&#8217;t
included
in
the
budget,
I&#8217;m
pressing
for
it
happen
in
a
separate
measure
and
I&#8217;ve
called
on
Speaker
Boehner
to
call
the
House
back
in
session
immediately
so
we
can
get
this
done
for
families
in
our
region.
Also,
while
it
will
be
good
for
our
federal
workforce
to
have
relief
from
the
damaging
across-the-board
cuts,
have
some
stability,
and
end
the
threats
of
furloughs
and
layoffs,
I&#8217;m
concerned
that
once
again
the
federal
workforce
is
being
asked
to
make
the
biggest
sacrifices
for
our
budget. After
visiting
with
folks
at
the
shipyard,
at
the
VA,
and
at
other
federal
agencies
in
our
region,
I&#8217;m
concerned
we&#8217;re
going
to
see
a
lot
of
good
workers
leave
and
not
pursue
work
in
the
government
because
they
don&#8217;t
feel
valued.
In
a
perfect
world,
I&#8217;d
like
to
see
a
budget
that
completely
ends
the
damaging
across-the-board
cuts
that
hurt
our
region,
and
that
reflects
our
priorities
to
invest
in
things
we
care
about
like
growing
our
economy,
creating
jobs,
reducing
the
deficit
in
a
responsible
way,
and
protecting
those
most
vulnerable
among
us.
That&#8217;s
why
I&#8217;m
still
pushing
for
a
big,
bipartisan
budget
that
deals
with
our
long-term
fiscal
health
and
grows
our
economy
so
we
can
get
folks
back
to
work.
This
budget
isn&#8217;t
perfect
but
I&#8217;m
encouraged
that
both
sides
have
found
a
way
to
compromise.
It&#8217;s
also
my
hope
that
after
a
budget
deal,
both
sides
will
have
an
incentive
to
come
to
the
table
and
start
discussing
ways
to
move
things
forward
in
the
coming
year.
Special
kudos
to
our
own
US
Senator
Patty
Murray
who
put
in
countless
hours
to
work
on
this
budget
and
who
demonstrated
that
compromise
is
possible
in
our
nation&#8217;s
capital.
It&#8217;s
long
past
time
for
Congress
to
put
aside
partisan
bickering
and
start
focusing
on
getting
things
done
for
the
American
people.
Kilmer
at
Your
Company
On
Tuesday,
I
spoke
at
a
meeting of
the
Bremerton
Chamber
of
Commerce
to
give
them
an
update
on
what&#8217;s
going
on
in
Congress
and
so
I
could
hear
what&#8217;s
on
their

Part
of
the
reason
I
do
outreach
to
employers
in
our
region
is
because
we&#8217;ve
got
to
get
our
economy
cooking
again.
My
background
is

&#8211;
my
job
used
to
be
meeting
with
businesses
to
figure

how
to

more
workers.
One
of
the
ways
I
outreach
to
employers
is
by
doing
&#8220;Kilmer
at
Your
Company&#8221;
events.
During
these

I
typically

get
a

the

how

federal
government.
If
there&#8217;s
something
that&#8217;s
causing
our
region
to
have
problems
hiring
new
workers
or
expanding
small
businesses,
I
want
to
know
about
it
so
I
can
work
on
it
at
the
federal
level.
I&#8217;ve
held
over
50
of
these
types
of
meetings
so
far
and
in
the
coming
year
I
plan
to
continue
that
pace.
If
you
have
a
suggestion
of
a
company
I
should
visit
for
a
&#8220;Kilmer
at
Your
Company&#8221;
event,
if
you&#8217;d
like
me
to
visit
your
place
of
work,
or
if
you
just
have
an
idea
you&#8217;d
like
to
share,
please
don&#8217;t
hesitate
to

me.
Thanks
as
always
for

I
wish
you
happy
holidays
and
a
happy
new
year.
