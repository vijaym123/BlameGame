Dear
David,
The Constitution requires the president to "take
care that the laws be faithfully executed."
Yet
time and again, President Obama has refused to enforce the law and shown
a willingness to misuse regulations to side-step
Congress.
Americans are rightly concerned about government overreach
and dysfunction under the current administration.
That's why I
introduced a bill today to stop executive branch
overreach and force President Obama to uphold the
Constitution.
The
Executive Needs to Faithfully Observe and Respect
Congressional Enactments of the Law
(ENFORCE the Law) Act, which is
co-sponsored by more than half of my Senate Republican colleagues,
permits Congress to authorize a lawsuit against the president if he fails
to uphold his constitutional obligation to faithfully execute the
law.
It's time we restore the system of checks and
balances and
stop e xecutive
overreach.

Enforce the Law Act, please

As
always, I invite you visit my
website
to learn
more. You can also join the conversation online through
