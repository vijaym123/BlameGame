Congratulations to Guillermo Farias on receiving the Truman-Reagan Medal of Freedom from the
Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation
for his efforts to bring democracy to Cuba; he has spent his life fighting against injustice. In our conversation, he shared his views on the Cuban Adjustment Act and how it has been abused. I agree that the Cuban Adjustment Act must be reformed, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that this law is no longer exploited.
HOUSE FLOOR
Florida International University and Florida Power &amp; Light are working towards creating cleaner energy solutions for South Florida. I spoke about their innovative ideas on the House Floor, including the creation of 5,000 solar panels that FIU students will directly monitor to gauge the electricity grid in our community.
South Florida is home to thousands of Haitian Americans, and Im proud that H.R. 1295 extends the duty-free benefit programs for Haiti through September 30, 2025. This bill will help many relatives of the members of our community. I thank the House for its overwhelming support and look forward to H.R. 1295 becoming law.
Last week I had the honor of opening the United States House of Representatives and presiding over legislative business.
COMMITTEE HEARINGS
Last week I had the privilege of chairing my first hearing at the House Committee on Small Business, Squeezed: Current Challenges for Small Citrus Operations. Florida is one of the top producers of citrus in the world and citrus greening is hurting the industry. We need to adopt programs to slow down the spread of the disease until long term solutions are developed and implemented.
NOTABLE VISITS
Cubs Scouts, Pack 868, stopped by the office for a tour or the Capitol recently. Hope you all enjoyed your visit to D.C., and remember to work hard and do your best.
