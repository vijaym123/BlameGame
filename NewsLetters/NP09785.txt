Friend,
May 11 marked the beginning of Food Allergy Awareness Week.
Over 15 million Americans have a food allergy.
Allergens range from a mild response to anaphylaxis, a severe and potentially deadly reaction.
Food allergy rate among children are particularly troubling, from 1997 to 2011 the incidence of food allergies among children increased 50 percent.
Currently, 1 in 3 children suffer from the condition.
Of these children, Moreover, roughly report that they have been bullied specifically because of their allergy. A Virginia
second-grader
was so severally bullied because of his allergies that he became depressed and had suicidal thoughts.
Unfortunately, because many people do not understand the potentially deadly nature of this disease; what can be seen as a prank is actually very harmful and potentially very dangerous.
It only takes one incident to send a child with a severe food allergy to the hospital. Even if an incident doesnt prompt an allergic reaction, just the fear of bullying can lead to anxiety, depression, and embarrassment.
At least 15 states have guidelines for management of food allergies in schools, and many tackle bullying specifically.
Unfortunately, many schools do not do an adequate job educating students, parents, and staff.
Thats why I introduced H.R. 3660, the Alerting Local Leaders and Ensuring Responsible Guidelines for Youth (ALLERGY) Act which would require schools to put in place a policy that addresses allergy bullying.
Education is key to preventing bullying.
Please join
me this week as we raise awareness about allergies and allergy bullying.
