Dear Friend,
As Montanans, we are blessed to have a
strong legacy of service and we are proud of the sacrifices made by
the more than one hundred thousand veterans who call Montana
home.
While their service deserves our appreciation every day,
Veterans Day gives our nation a special opportunity to honor all of the
men and women who have served in our nations armed forces, from those
who took up arms for independence to those who are serving in uniform
today. We are eternally indebted to them.
We may not be
able to repay that debt, but our nation must honor and fulfill the
promises we have made. We have a responsibility to support our veterans
when they return home
aiding reintegration into civilian life with job
training for returning heroes, ensuring all veterans receive care that
treats them with the dignity they deserve, and supporting those with
mental health wounds.
Millions of brave American men and
women have stepped up and served our nation in uniform, and because of
their courage and valor, our nation and the world are more secure and
free.
Please join me today in honoring our nations
veterans and thanking all who have answered the call. May God bless our
veterans, today and every day.
Sincerely,
Steve Daines
