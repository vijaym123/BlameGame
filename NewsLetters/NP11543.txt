Capitol Update
It's Time to Stand Up to Russian Aggression: An Op-Ed by Congressman
Paul Cook
In 2008, the world watched as Russia invaded
Georgia in Vladimir Putin's first step to rebuild the old Soviet
Empire. This past week, Putin continued his pattern of aggression by
invading Ukraine. While Russia claims that it is acting to protect
ethnic Russians in Crimea, it is clear to democratic nations that the
real motive behind this is to prevent the new Ukrainian government from
moving closer to Europe. Putin's attempt to rebuild the Soviet Empire
is the greatest threat to European peace since the Cold War ended.
So far, the Russian intervention in Ukraine has been limited to Crimea.
This strategic peninsula gives Russia control of the Black Sea and
access to the Mediterranean. In 2008, Russia's Black Sea Fleet was used
to support its invasion of Georgia and for the past few years, it has
used this as a key shipping route to provide arms to the murderous
Assad regime in Syria. The pro-Russian puppet regime in Crimea has
called for a referendum on becoming part of Russia. It's inconceivable
that any sort of free and fair vote could be held in Crimea under
Russian occupation.
More disturbingly, we have seen pro-Russian mobs seizing government
buildings and calling for Russian intervention across Eastern Ukraine.
Combined with the major Russian military exercises along Ukraine's
border and calls from the Russian parliament to depose the pro-Western
Ukrainian government, this raises the specter of a large scale invasion
of Ukraine.
Any occupation of Ukraine would put Russia directly on the border of
our key NATO allies, such as Poland, and raise the specter of a major
war. The last time we saw a major European power invading its neighbors
under the pretext of protecting its ethnic citizens was in the late
1930s. The lack of Western response to that aggression ultimately led
to a world war with tens of millions killed, including hundreds of
thousands of Americans. Failure to respond firmly to Russian aggression
in Ukraine will only increase the chance that Russia's next target will
be a NATO ally that we are treaty-bound to go to war to protect.
Additionally, an American failure to respond to Russia's invasion of
Ukraine will be a catastrophe for our efforts to prevent the spread of
nuclear weapons. Under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine gave up
its nuclear weapons in return for promises from the United States, the
United Kingdom, and Russia to respect and protect its territorial
integrity. If we stand by and do nothing as Russia dismembers Ukraine,
our other allies will question the security assurances we have provided
them. This would likely lead some of them to pursue their own nuclear
weapons to defend themselves, fueling a nuclear arms race in volatile
regions such as the Middle East and East Asia.
The financial aid package for Ukraine that was approved by the House of
Representatives as well as the administration's sanctions against some
of the individuals responsible for the crisis are a good first step,
but are not enough by themselves. While there is no military solution
to the Ukraine crisis, there are three key steps the United States and
its allies can take to punish Russia and deter further aggression.
First, America should impose targeted sanctions on President Putin and
other key Russian political and military officials, as well as
oligarchs closely tied to the regime. These sanctions would freeze
their assets in the West and limit their ability to travel and do
business outside of Russia.
Second, the United States should revisit its decision to scrap its
missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic. A robust
missile defense system based in Eastern Europe would not only reassure
our allies of our commitment to their defense, but would also provide
protection from the missile attacks of rogue regimes such as Iran.
Finally, the United States should consult with our allies about the
possibility of basing NATO forces in Eastern European states threatened
by Russia. This would help to deter any further Russian aggression
against NATO states that America is committed to defend. While taking
these steps won't expel Russian troops from Ukraine, they will reassure
our allies in the region that America will keep its promises and force
Putin to think twice before threatening more of his neighbors.
The Cold War taught us that peace could only be achieved through
strength. Since World War II, a strong American presence in Europe has
kept the peace and prevented the outbreak of a major war. If America
and its European allies stand together and impose real consequences on
Putin's regime, they can deter further Russian aggression and possibly
prevent a major deadly conflict.

Congressman Cook Joins in Calling for San Bernardino and Riverside
Counties to be Designated as a Manufacturing Community
Last week, Congressman Paul Cook (R-Apple Valley) signed onto a
bipartisan letter from the Inland Empire Congressional delegation to
the US Department of Commerce calling for San Bernardino and Riverside
Counties to be designated as a manufacturing community under the
Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership (IMCP).
The IMCP helps accelerate the resurgence of manufacturing in regions
across the country. It rewards communities that best highlight their
strengths and demonstrate they can combine their efforts around
workforce training, infrastructure and research centers to implement an
economic development plan that will attract, retain, and expand
manufacturing investment.
Along with Cook, the bipartisan letter included Congress members Takano
(D-Riverside), Calvert (R-Corona), Chu (D-Pasadena), Hunter
(R-Temecula), Miller (R-Redlands), Negrete McLeod (D-Chino), Royce
(R-Orange), and Ruiz (D-Palm Springs).
The members write, "We are writing to express our support for the
University of California, Riverside (UCR) Proposal for Designation as a
'Manufacturing Community' (Docket No. 131121981-3981) in preparation
for future federal investments through the Manufacturing Communities
Partnership (IMCP). The Inland Empire Manufacturing Community described
in the attached proposal offers the infrastructure and manufacturing
strength, supplier networks, workforce, innovation ecosystem, private
and government partnership and leadership to maximally benefit from a
Manufacturing Community designation."
The University of California, Riverside Center for Economic Development
and Innovation is leading the application, which would give Riverside
and San Bernardino counties preferential consideration for up to $1.3
billion in federal dollars and assistance from 10 federal agencies.

A Message from Congressman Cook on Helping His Constituents
A 62-year-old veteran from Phelan came into my office for assistance
with an appeal he had before the Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA).
The VA had denied his claim for mantel cell lymphoma stage IV caused by
his exposure to Agent Orange in Vietnam. The VA claimed it was unable
to verify he had actually served in Vietnam. I was able to work
directly with the VA to facilitate an official records search of the
unit diaries. The VA verified that he had served in Vietnam, qualifying
him to receive a 100 percent disability rating and retroactive benefits
dating back to the original filing date in 2010. He is now receiving
the benefits he earned.
If you need help with any of the various federal agencies, please feel
free to contact my Apple Valley District Office at 760-247-1815.
Veterans Corner
There's great news for veterans interested in working in air traffic
control!
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is planning to hire more than
600 new Air Traffic Control Specialists and wants as many of them as
possible to be veterans.
Given the pre-qualification requirements, many recently-transitioning
veterans will likely qualify. To be considered for a position as an air
traffic controller, applicants must:
be a U.S. citizen;
start the FAA Academy no later than their 31st birthday;
be willing to relocate to an air traffic facility based on the FAA's
highest needs at the time; and
have three years of progressively responsible work experience,
or a Bachelor's degree, or a combination of post-secondary
education and work experience that totals three years.

Update
It&#8217;s
Time
to
Stand
Up
to
Russian
Aggression:
An
Op-Ed
by
Congressman
Paul
Cook In
2008,
the
world
watched
as
Russia
invaded
Georgia
in
Vladimir
Putin&#8217;s
first
step
to
rebuild
the
old
Soviet
Empire.
This
past
week,
Putin
continued
his
pattern
of
aggression
by
invading
Ukraine.
While
Russia
claims
that
it
is
acting
to
protect
ethnic
Russians
in
Crimea,
it
is
clear
to
democratic
nations
that
the
real
motive
behind
this
is
to
prevent
the
new
Ukrainian
government
from
moving
closer
to
Europe.
Putin&#8217;s
attempt
to
rebuild
the
Soviet
Empire
is
the
greatest
threat
to
European
peace
since
the
Cold
War
ended.
So
far,
the
Russian
intervention
in
Ukraine
has
been
limited
to
Crimea.
This
strategic
peninsula
gives
Russia
control
of
the
Black
Sea
and
access
to
the
Mediterranean.
In
2008,
Russia&#8217;s
Black
Sea
Fleet
was
used
to
support
its
invasion
of
Georgia
and
for
the
past
few
years,
it
has
used
this
as
a
key
shipping
route
to
provide
arms
to
the
murderous
Assad
regime
in
Syria.
The
pro-Russian
puppet
regime
in
Crimea
has
called
for
a
referendum
on
becoming
part
of
Russia.
It&#8217;s
inconceivable
that
any
sort
of
free
and
fair
vote
could
be
held
in
Crimea
under
Russian
occupation.
More
disturbingly,
we
have
seen
pro-Russian
mobs
seizing
government
buildings
and
calling
for
Russian
intervention
across
Eastern
Ukraine.
Combined
with
the
major
Russian
military
exercises
along
Ukraine&#8217;s
border
and
calls
from
the
Russian
parliament
to
depose
the
pro-Western
Ukrainian
government,
this
raises
the
specter
of
a
large
scale
invasion
of
Ukraine.
Any
occupation
of
Ukraine
would
put
Russia
directly
on
the
border
of
our
key
NATO
allies,
such
as
Poland,
and
raise
the
specter
of
a
major
war.
The
last
time
we
saw
a
major
European
power
invading
its
neighbors
under
the
pretext
of
protecting
its
ethnic
citizens
was
in
the
late
1930s.
The
lack
of
Western
response
to
that
aggression
ultimately
led
to
a
world
war
with
tens
of
millions
killed,
including
hundreds
of
thousands
of
Americans.
Failure
to
respond
firmly
to
Russian
aggression
in
Ukraine
will
only
increase
the
chance
that
Russia&#8217;s
next
target
will
be
a
NATO
ally
that
we
are
treaty-bound
to
go
to
war
to
protect.
Additionally,
an
American
failure
to
respond
to
Russia&#8217;s
invasion
of
Ukraine
will
be
a
catastrophe
for
our
efforts
to
prevent
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons.
Under
the
1994
Budapest
Memorandum,
Ukraine
gave
up
its
nuclear
weapons
in
return
for
promises
from
the
United
States,
the
United
Kingdom,
and
Russia
to
respect
and
protect
its
territorial
integrity.
If
we
stand
by
and
do
nothing
as
Russia
dismembers
Ukraine,
our
other
allies
will
question
the
security
assurances
we
have
provided
them.
This
would
likely
lead
some
of
them
to
pursue
their
own
nuclear
weapons
to
defend
themselves,
fueling
a
nuclear
arms
race
in
volatile
regions
such
as
the
Middle
East
and
East
Asia.
The
financial
aid
package
for
Ukraine
that
was
approved
by
the
House
of
Representatives
as
well
as
the
administration&#8217;s
sanctions
against
some
of
the
individuals
responsible
for
the
crisis
are
a
good
first
step,
but
are
not
enough
by
themselves.
While
there
is
no
military
solution
to
the
Ukraine
crisis,
there
are
three
key
steps
the
United
States
and
its
allies
can
take
to
punish
Russia
and
deter
further
aggression.
First,
America
should
impose
targeted
sanctions
on
President
Putin
and
other
key
Russian
political
and
military
officials,
as
well
as
oligarchs
closely
tied
to
the
regime.
These
sanctions
would
freeze
their
assets
in
the
West
and
limit
their
ability
to
travel
and
do
business
outside
of
Russia.
Second,
the
United
States
should
revisit
its
decision
to
scrap
its
missile
defense
system
in
Poland
and
the
Czech
Republic.
A
robust
missile
defense
system
based
in
Eastern
Europe
would
not
only
reassure
our
allies
of
our
commitment
to
their
defense,
but
would
also
provide
protection
from
the
missile
attacks
of
rogue
regimes
such
as
Iran.
Finally,
the
United
States
should
consult
with
our
allies
about
the
possibility
of
basing
NATO
forces
in
Eastern
European
states
threatened
by
Russia.
This
would
help
to
deter
any
further
Russian
aggression
against
NATO
states
that
America
is
committed
to
defend.
While
taking
these
steps
won&#8217;t
expel
Russian
troops
from
Ukraine,
they
will
reassure
our
allies
in
the
region
that
America
will
keep
its
promises
and
force
Putin
to
think
twice
before
threatening
more
of
his
neighbors.
The
Cold
War
taught
us
that
peace
could
only
be
achieved
through
strength.
Since
World
War
II,
a
strong
American
presence
in
Europe
has
kept
the
peace
and
prevented
the
outbreak
of
a
major
war.
If
America
and
its
European
allies
stand
together
and
impose
real
consequences
on
Putin&#8217;s
regime,
they
can
deter
further
Russian
aggression
and
possibly
prevent
a
major
deadly
conflict.

A
Message
from
Congressman
Cook
on
Helping
His
Constituents
A
62-year-old
veteran
from
Phelan
came
into
my
office
for
assistance
with
an
appeal
he
had
before
the
Department
of
Veterans&#8217;
Affairs
(VA).
The
VA
had
denied
his
claim
for
mantel
cell
lymphoma
stage
IV
caused
by
his
exposure
to
Agent
Orange
in
Vietnam.
The
VA
claimed
it
was
unable
to
verify
he
had
actually
served
in
Vietnam.
I

Veterans
Corner
There&#8217;s
great
news
for
veterans
interested
in
working
in
air
traffic
control!
The
Federal
Aviation
Administration
(FAA)
is
planning
to
hire
more
than
600
new
Air
Traffic
Control
Specialists
and
wants
as
many
of
them
as
possible
to
be
veterans.
Given
the
pre-qualification
requirements,
many
recently-transitioning
veterans
will
likely
qualify.
To
be
considered
for
a
position
as
an
air
traffic
controller,
applicants
must:
&#183;
be
a
U.S.
citizen;
&#183;
start
the
FAA
Academy
no
later
than
their
31st
birthday;
&#183;
be
willing
to
relocate
to
an
air
traffic
facility
based
on
the
FAA&#8217;s
highest
needs
at
the
time;
and
&#183;
have
three
years
of
progressively
responsible
work
experience,
or
a
Bachelor&#8217;s
degree,
