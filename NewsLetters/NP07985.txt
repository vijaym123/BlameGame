&ldquo;Palin calls for Obama&rsquo;s impeachment&rdquo; -
USA Today , 7/8/14
Dear Friend, Sarah Palin just jumped on the let&rsquo;s-impeach-the-President bandwagon.
Tea Partiers in the House have been calling for the President&rsquo;s impeachment for a while now. This isn&rsquo;t serious -- it&rsquo;s an attempt by the Tea Party to rile up their base in an election year.
They're more worried about getting the President fired than getting American workers hired. Well, Ed is in the Senate to get things done. That&rsquo;s why the special interests don&rsquo;t like him. And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s incredibly important we do all we can to keep him there. Make a $5 contribution and help Ed keep fighting against the Tea Party.

You and I both know that the President hasn&rsquo;t done anything that rises to the level of an impeachable offense. So does John Boehner -- that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s trying to split the difference, promising to sue the President but not introduce formal articles of impeachment.
These are all distractions from the radical, backward agenda of the Tea Party. But no matter how loud they get, they can&rsquo;t change the hard truths -- that their mission to end Medicare as we know it, set back women&rsquo;s rights by decades, and ignore the middle class at the expense of their corporate allies
would be disastrous. We can&rsquo;t let the Tea Party take over the Senate. We&rsquo;re going to keep organizing and keep Ed fighting for us. You can help by chipping in $5 today .
Thanks,
David
