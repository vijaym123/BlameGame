Two Bills Signed Into Law
12/17/14
Last night,
President Obama signed two pieces of Congressman Lamborn's legislation
into law.
First
was legislation naming the new Colorado Springs VA Clinic after PFC
Floyd K. Lindstrom. PFC Lindstrom was a Colorado Springs native who gave
his life serving the country in World War II and is a Medal of Honor
recipient.
Ensuring
that our veterans have access to convenient, comprehensive healthcare
has always been a priority of mine.
It was an honor to partner
with so many Southern Colorado veterans to help bring a fantastic new
Colorado Springs Community Based Outpatient Clinic for our veterans.
Today, the facility is complete. The Senate, thanks to the efforts of my
colleague Senator Udall, has passed my bill designating the new clinic
as the PFC Floyd K. Lindstrom Department of Veterans Affairs
Clinic.
PFC Lindstrom was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for
his heroic actions during WWII and is one of the Fifth Congressional
Districts
and the nations
greatest heroes.
He is buried in
Colorado Springs at the Evergreen Cemetery and I can think of no one
more deserving of this honor.
I want to thank Brian Binn and the
Colorado Springs CBOC Naming Committee and everyone else who worked so
hard to make this
happen.

Second was legislation
establishing the World War I American Veteran's Centennial Commemorative
Coin Act.
"To honor their
service and sacrifices, Congress created the World War I Centennial
Commission in 2013 and tasked them with planning and executing
activities to commemorate the centennial of World War I through the use of
private donations and coin sales. By requiring the Secretary of the
Treasury to mint coins to commemorate the centennial, this bill would allow
us to honor the memory, service and sacrifice of the brave veterans of
World War I, while providing the means to pay tribute to the end of
World War I battlefield hostilities. Other great conflicts, including
the Civil War, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War, have
all been memorialized on United States commemorative coins, but no
such honor has been extended to the brave veterans of World War I. This
year, 2014, is the 100th anniversary of the start of World War I,
making it very fitting that we pass this measure this
year."
