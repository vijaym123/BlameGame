Dear David,
The
House and Senate have passed a Farm Bill that will touch the lives of
all Americans.
Not only does it direct agricultural policy, but
it also sets funding levels for vital nutrition programs such as SNAP
(food stamps)
and many conservation and economic investment
programs that reach all communities.
The Farm Bill Conference
Committee, on which I served as Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosis appointed
representative, worked through immense differences to reach an
agreement.
Ultimately, the Conference Committee produced a fair,
bipartisan bill that meets the needs of the American people and reduces
federal spending by $23 billion.
Although I do not agree with some
provisions of the bill, I believe it was the right decision to vote for
legislation that prevents devastating cuts to SNAP, improves access to
nutritional offerings, and expands economic investment in low income and
urban communities, as well as provides certainty and sound agricultural
policies for Americas farmers and ranchers.
Ohio will not
be affected by the $8.6 billion in savings to SNAP over 10 years
through a change in Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)
policy. I am pleased we were able to avoid the much larger cuts ($40
billion) included in the nutrition bill passed by the House last
September.
The Farm Bill designates Central State University
as a land-grant institution, allowing the university to receive federal
funding for agricultural education. I am pleased the institution will
expand its education initiatives and participate in Ohios
agricultural research.
A historically black university with many students
from the 11th District, Central State is well-suited to carry out the
land grant mission, which will benefit Ohioans for years to
come.
Michael Walton of South Euclid
testified at
an Agriculture Subcommittee
hearing in
2012.
In 2012, I invited
constituents to provide their input on the Farm Bill.
A resident from South
Euclid identified his concerns about agricultural microloans and
informed my staff that youth loans from the Department of Agriculture, the
only department to give loans to young people, were restricted to
rural residents. I am pleased to announce the 2014 Farm Bill clarifies
that youth loans are not limited to rural citizens and will now be
available to urban residents; authorizes the Microloan Program to target
loans of $50,000 or less for new or non-traditional producers; and
creates a pilot relending program with Community Development Financial
Institutions (CDFIs) to make or guarantee microloans.

Congresswoman
Fudge's
speech about why she
supports the
2014 Farm Bill.
"I am writing
to share with you my familys positive experience with signing up for
the Affordable Care Act. Our new monthly premium is $1,343.10, a
monthly reduction of $1,018.36 which translates into an annual savings of
$12,220.32 as compared to 2013. Another significant difference in the
new plan was the inclusion of pediatric preventive dental (semi-annual
checkups and cleaning) and eye (annual eye examinations and one pair
of glasses) care. These were not covered under our old planIn
conclusion, we are thankful for the changes the Affordable Care Act made
possible for our family.
Mr. B,
