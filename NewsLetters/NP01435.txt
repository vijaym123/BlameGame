David --
We desperately need comprehensive campaign finance reform, yet with so many entrenched special interests and a Republican Congress, it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to get it done.
But President Obama could take action today that would move us in the right direction. He could issue an executive order that would force government contractors to stop secretly donating to political groups.
Call on President Obama to shed light on political spending by government contractors &gt;&gt;
Government contractors are earning millions of dollars directly from the pockets of the American people. The public has a right to know if they&rsquo;re turning around and spending that money for political purposes. We are strongly urging President Obama to right this wrong and act now: http://act.schneiderforcongress.com/expose-donors
Thank you for taking action,
