Senator Johnson Responds to Monday's Court
Decision
On Monday, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Wisconsin issued a decision denying Sen. Johnson legal standing before the
district court.
This means that Sen. Johnson will not be allowed
to present the merits of his case against the Obama administrations
actions that provided special treatment to members of Congress and
their staffs, unless the decision is overturned on
appeal.

Victims of
Government
Sen. Johnson strongly believes that the root

laws, rules and regulations that constitute the government's
intrusion in our lives. If you have had, or are currently having, issues
dealing with the federal agencies that mandate these restrictions, we would
like to hear your story and work with you to resolve the issues.
Share your story with Ron's professional staff by emailing us
