Dear
Constituents,
I am deeply disturbed and furious about the
reports of forged record keeping and veterans seeking care dying due
to long wait times at Veterans Affairs healthcare facilities. As a
doctor, I live by my oath to "First, Do No Harm." The veterans in our
communities and across the nation deserve better.
This week,
the VA Inspector General released an interim report of the
investigation into scheduling misconduct at the Phoenix VA and other VA hospitals
across the country. The report substantiated claims that a number of
facilities manipulated the reported waiting times of veterans in order
to make wait times at the VA hospital appear shorter than they really
are.
This report has made it clear that there is a
systemic failure of accountability and responsibility within the VA
healthcare system. It also indicates that individuals responsible for this
wrongdoing may be criminally liable for their actions. The VA has broken
our trust.

I have taken action
to hold those responsible for this breach of public trust accountable.
As an emergency medicine doctor, I know how harmful any delay in much
needed care can be for patients. I have demanded the following from
leadership at the
VA:
Do the right thing and immediately ensure that no other
forged waiting lists exist anywhere
else.
Give our veterans the care theyve earned and need without
delay.
Conduct a system-wide, honest, and
transparent investigation and hold those who have been dishonest and
negligent accountable and train new employees that will respect our
veterans.
Additionally, I have already
taken several steps to start addressing this unacceptable failure and
audit the Loma Linda VA Healthcare System scheduling practices.
Specifically:
Last week on May
23, I joined with my colleagues to send a letter to VA Secretary
Shinseki demanding a thorough, comprehensive, and transparent review of all
scheduling practices and wait times experienced at all VA healthcare
facilities.
That same day I also sent a
letter to the Director of the healthcare network that oversees the
Loma Linda VA Healthcare System demanding specific information on wait
times including details on how wait times are calculated, the causes of
wait times at each clinic, and if any of the wait times are out of
compliance, and what is being done to address the
problem.
I
joined my colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs
Committee to vote for a subpoena to obtain more information from the VA on
this unconscionable
problem.
I called for VA Secretary Shinseki to resign. He did the honorable
thing and resigned on May 30.
I called
for the Department of Justice to open a criminal investigation
immediately to seek out and prosecute those responsible for the misconduct in
order to clean up the VA.
As a
physician, I am committed to ensuring all veterans who served our country
receive the medical care they have earned and need, when they need
it. As this situation develops and more information is available, please
rest assured that I will keep you informed and continue to fight for
our veterans to make sure the VA healthcare system is working as
promised, and treats veterans with the respect and dignity they deserve. If
you have any questions, concerns, or would like to voice your
opinion, please call my Palm Springs Office at (760) 424
8888.
Sincerely,
Raul Ruiz, M.D.
