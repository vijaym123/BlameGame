Dear Friend,
Thank you for subscribing to my email updates. I appreciate your
continued interest and value this opportunity to share with you what
I'm doing in Washington and the 15th District. For more ways to stay in

FEMA Declaration Rules Need Revamping To Ensure Fairness For All
In response to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA)
decision to deny the state of Illinois' request for public assistance
following the devastating storms on November 17, 2013, I have worked
with U.S. Reps. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.), Aaron Schock (R-Ill.), Adam
Kinzinger (R-Ill.), Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), and Bill Enyart (D-Ill.) to
introduce bipartisan legislation to finally bring fairness to the FEMA
disaster declaration process.
The Fairness in Federal Disaster Declarations Act of 2014, H.R. 3925
, will
provide more certainty to states and small communities impacted by
disasters by giving FEMA a clearer, more substantive formula when
evaluating disaster areas.
Downstate Illinois is disadvantaged when disasters strike, due to our
population upstate. This legislation helps to address that problem and
would allow communities like Gifford and Brookport, who were hit by
tornadoes last year, a chance to be eligible for FEMA Public
Assistance. A million dollars to Chicago may not matter much, but it
does to my constituents.
Added Davis, "Time and time again we've seen FEMA deny downstate
communities from receiving federal assistance following storms. Gifford
and Washington are two of the most recent examples, but just two years
ago Harrisburg in Southern Illinois was denied, as well. It simply isn't
right when a storm leaves behind damage in Missouri, Illinois and
Kentucky, and the only communities to be denied federal assistance are
in Illinois. The current system puts downstate and rural communities at
a strong disadvantage, and that has to change."
According to a report by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), FEMA
already takes into account several factors when determining the need
for Public and Individual Assistance. However, there is currently no
standard to determine which factor is more important than another,
which leads to a highly subjective and uncertain process that leaves
states and communities in limbo for weeks as their application is
considered.
Danville Doings
Danville was the site Friday for two special events. At Danville Area
Community College, I attended a legislative luncheon with Illinois
State Senator Chapin Rose (far left in picture above), State
Representative Chad Hays, and (to my left) Randy Pollard of U.S.
Senator Mark Kirk's office. I would like to thank DACC President Alice
Marie Jacobs for the invitation.
At the Vermilion County War Museum (lower picture), I was privileged to
present Korean War veteran Robert Paul Jaynes of Danville with the
decorations he earned for his service in the U.S. Army during a
ceremony attended by family and friends.
FDA Move Could Have Negative Impact On Generics, Consumers
I joined a group of lawmakers on Wednesday in sending a letter
to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner
Margaret Hamburg expressing concerns about the FDA's proposed
regulation to allow generic drug companies to unilaterally change their
drug labeling information.
The letter states, in part:
"We are writing to express grave concerns regarding a regulation . that
would change longstanding policy regarding the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act.
The proposed regulation would allow generic manufacturers to alter an
abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) label without the FDA's prior
approval. We strongly believe that such a rule would conflict directly
with the statute, thwart the law's purposes and objectives, and impose
significant costs on the drug industry and healthcare consumers. We
respectfully request the Agency explain and reconsider this departure
from more than two decades of settled practice."
The Hatch-Waxman Act requires generic drug products to be materially
identical to their brand-name counterpart - including the drug label.
Chemically equivalent drugs with different warnings and safety
information will not only be confusing to patients and prescribers, but
the increased regulatory burdens of the proposed rule will increase the
costs of generic drugs.
Bipartisan Legislation Would Improve The State Of The Union
President Obama will make his annual State of the Union speech Tuesday,
and he likely will again call for increases in infrastructure
investment. The Wall Street Journal noted
last
week there is a way of getting this done that enjoys broad, bipartisan
support:
"Last May, Rep. John Delaney introduced the Partnership to Build
America Act, which would finance $750 billion in new infrastructure
investment using no appropriated funds. He proposes an American
Infrastructure Fund to be financed by the sale of 50-year
infrastructure bonds at a low, fixed interest rate to corporations; the
companies would be allowed to repatriate a certain amount of their
overseas earnings tax-free for every dollar they invest in these bonds.
"Rep. Delaney's bill has 50 House co-sponsors - 25 Republicans and 25
Democrats. Just last week, a bipartisan team, Democrat Michael Bennet
and Republican Roy Blunt, introduced a companion bill in the Senate,
with nine additional co-sponsors - five Republicans, three Democrats,
and an Independent. Query: Why shouldn't Mr. Obama endorse the Delaney
bill and re-energize a long-stalled debate?"
As one of those House co-sponsors, I would like to echo that sentiment.
The (Ob)Long Way
On Wednesday, I was able to enjoy one of my favorite activities:
speaking about government and my role as a Member of Congress to
students at Oblong High School. If you would like me to speak at your
school, contact my Maryville office.
Announcement
Valentines For Heroes: My office is again sponsoring "Valentines for
Heroes," a program where we collect valentines for distribution
throughout the region to veterans and those currently serving in the
military. This year, valentines will be accepted via mail or in person
at my district offices until February 7. The few basic rules to follow
are to return signed valentines without addressing them to a specific
person, without signing your last name or including your address, and
without sealing them in individual envelopes.

John Shimkus, Member of Congress

A

Added
Davis,
&#8220;Time
and
time
again
we&#8217;ve
seen
FEMA
deny
downstate
communities
from
receiving
federal
assistance
following
storms.
Gifford
and
Washington
are
two
of
the
most
recent
examples,
but
just
two
years
ago
Harrisburg
in
Southern
Illinois
was
denied,
as
well.
It
simply
isn&#8217;t
right
when
a
storm
leaves
behind
damage
in
Missouri,
Illinois
and
Kentucky,
and
the
only
communities
to
be
denied

are
in
Illinois.
The
current
system
puts
downstate

FDA
Move
Could
Have
Negative
Impact
On
Generics,
Consumers
I joined
a
group
of
lawmakers on
Wednesday in
sending
a
letter
to
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(FDA)
Commissioner
Margaret
Hamburg
expressing
concerns
about
the
FDA&#8217;s
proposed
regulation
to
allow
generic
drug
companies
to
unilaterally
change
their
drug
labeling
information.
The
letter
states,
in
part:
&#8220;We
are
writing
to
express
grave
concerns
regarding
a
regulation
&#8230;
that
would
change
longstanding
policy
regarding
the
1984
Hatch-Waxman
Act.
The
proposed
regulation
would
allow
generic
manufacturers
to
alter
an
abbreviated
new
drug
application
(ANDA)
label
without
the
FDA&#8217;s
prior
approval.
We
strongly
believe
that
such
a
rule
would
conflict
directly
with
the
statute,
thwart
the
law&#8217;s
purposes
and
objectives,
and
impose
significant
costs
on
the
drug
industry
and
healthcare
consumers.
We
respectfully
request
the
Agency
explain
and
reconsider
this
departure
from
more
than
two
decades
of
settled
practice.&#8221;
The
Hatch-Waxman
Act
requires
generic
drug
products
to
be
materially
identical
to
their
brand-name
counterpart
&#8211; including
the
drug
label. Chemically
equivalent
drugs
with

and
safety
information
will
not
only
be
confusing
to
patients

prescribers,
but
the
increased
regulatory
burdens
of
the
proposed
rule
will
increase
the
costs
of
generic

will
make

and he
likely

a
