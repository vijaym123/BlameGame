Legislative Update
To coincide with the 42nd annual March for Life in Washington this week, I supported and the House of Representatives passed H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2015.
Each year, the March for Life brings together tens of thousands of people who are willing to give voice to those who cannot speak for themselves. Together, we stand for the dignity and respect that each human being deserves.
Every life is a gift, and is valuable at each and every stage. A persons worth is not linked to how much we believe they contribute to society. Every individual should be given the opportunity to enjoy the right to life given to them by his or her Creator.
Your servant,

Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
On Friday, I met with the Distinguished Young Women of Florida honorees who gathered in Winter Garden. As part of the national scholarship program, the Distinguished Young Women of Florida division hosted their statewide event just down the street from my main local office. It was a pleasure to meet with 14 bright, high achieving young women and honor them for the hard work they invested in earning this notable recognition and qualifying for a scholarship based on their individual talents and achievements.

Before flying up to Washington on Tuesday, I participated in the groundbreaking of Fun Spot Americas newest expansion. Located on International Drive in Orlando, Fun Spot is joining forces with Gatorland to create a new reptile attraction called Gator Spot that will feature Floridas alligators, crocodiles, and other reptiles. It is a privilege to stand beside and cheer on businesses and attractions like Fun Spot America and Gatorland as they continue to grow in Central Florida.

Last Monday was Martin Luther King Day, and I attended the 24th annual YMCA Arthur "Pappy" Kennedy Prayer Breakfast in Orlando, as I have for many years. The new YMCA President and CEO, Dan Wilcox, was there, and it was great to hear from U.S. Senate Chaplain Barry Black, who was the guest speaker. Following the breakfast, I also rode in the City of Ocoees annual Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Unity Parade.

On Tuesday, I listened from inside the chamber of the House of Representatives as President Obama delivered his sixth State of the Union address. With the results of this last election, the American people spoke clearly: they want their government to advance policies that empower all Americans to achieve the American Dream. Instead of heeding this message, the President again doubled down on the same old politics of tax and spend, where one group is pitted against another and where Washington picks winners and losers.
What America needs is a government that furthers common sense solutions, such as a tax code that ensures all hardworking families, individuals and small business owners keep more of their paychecks to reinvest as they see fit. Furthering the same divisive, top down approach is not a plan to strengthen our economy, create jobs, and solve our debt crisis.
Your servant,

Constituent Corner:
During my radio interview on Orlandos Morning News 96.5 on Wednesday morning, news host Joe Kelley shared his experience about calling my office for IRS assistance. You can
hear his comments about our Constituent Services team here :
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
During his State of the Union address, President Obama proclaimed that he wanted to reduce the price of Community Collegeto zero. As with most State of the Union pronouncements, his plan was short on specifics
including a clear plan to pay for it.
Do you believe that more federal government involvement in education is a good idea?
Yes
No
I don't know
You can also
read some of my initial thoughts
regarding this topic from last Thursdays edition of the Daily Commercial.
