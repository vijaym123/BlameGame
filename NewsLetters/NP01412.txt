Youre Invited!
I am so excited to be hosting a town hall meeting this Saturday, April 18th at Cleveland Elementary School in Oakland.
These meetings give me the opportunity to hear from you
to answer your questions and respond to your concerns.
Democracy works best when everyone participates. I look forward to seeing you this Saturday.
Translation and TTY services are available upon request.
RSVP to the event here , or by calling my office at (510) 763-0370.
See you soon,
Congresswoman Barbara Lee
