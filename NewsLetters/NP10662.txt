Congressman Pittenger
Introduces
Safe Skies
Act of
2014
Congressman Pittenger is
Chairman of the Congressional Task Force on
Terrorism.
Did you
know a terrorist could easily use your stolen passport and identity to
board an airplane?
In America, weve become
painfully familiar with tight airport security procedures following 9/11. But
in most foreign countries, authorities dont even bother checking the
validity of passports before allowing passengers to board their
flight.
Passports can easily be verified using INTERPOLs
Stolen and Lost Travel Documents
database, returning a result in
less than one second. Most countries fail in this basic responsibility,
leaving
a gaping hole in the air travel security
system.
This issue came to light following the disappearance of
Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. While we may never know what happened
to the plane, we do know two men boarded the airplane using stolen
passports, and that Malaysian authorities never checked the INTERPOL
database.
We are making it too easy for those who wish
to destroy us.
This week, I introduced the
Safe
Skies Act of 2014
(H.R. 4448), which directs the President to
suspend U.S. foreign assistance to any country which fails to use the
INTERPOL database to check passports before commercial flights. Waivers
are available in cases of disaster relief, humanitarian aid, or
national security, but those waivers must be approved by
Congress.
The goal is not to punish foreign countries, but to give them an
incentive to do the right thing.
Checking passports is a simple
and common sense step that will help protect us all.
As
Chairman of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism, Im constantly
on the lookout for security loopholes, potential new threats, and new
ideas on how to keep you and your family safe. To learn more, please

Should you or your family ever need assistance cutting federal
government red tape or resolving issues with Social Security, Medicare,
Veterans benefits, or other federal agencies, please dont hesitate to
contact me.

Fighting for Small
Businesses
Congressman Pittenger sits on the House Financial Services
Committee .
Small businesses create
the majority of American jobs. So why doesnt Washington pay small
business owners more attention?
The Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, created by President Obama and Congresswoman Pelosi
in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, has broad, sweeping powers
over the American economy. Yet the CFPB has no regular process for
seeking input from small businesses or examining how proposed rules might
hurt the ability of small business owners to create new
jobs.
Thats about to change.
Last week, I introduced the
Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection Small Business Advisory Board
Act
( H.R. 4383 ). Thats a big fancy title
for legislation forcing the CFPB to give small businesses a seat at the
table.
Co-sponsored by Congressman Denny Heck, a
Democrat from the Olympia, Washington area, this
legislation:
Creates a permanent advisory board of at least 12 members,
all from small businesses involved in financial
services.
Requires the CFPB to meet with the board at least twice per year,
more often if the CFPB wants additional input.
Realtors,
mortgage brokers, loan officers, appraisers, and even neighborhood
store owners who provide pre-paid cards are among the small businesses who
would benefit from this advisory board.
As a
former small business owner, I understand the frustration of watching
Washington bureaucrats make rules that needlessly and negatively impacted
my business. Many of CFPBs rules are designed for the
too-big-to-fail banks, but because no one is paying attention, the rules are allowed
to trickle down and hurt ordinary, hardworking
Americans.
This common sense, bipartisan legislation will give small business
owners a bigger voice in Washington, allowing robust consumer protection
while ensuring new rules dont needlessly restrict job
growth.
