Dear Friends,
For the second time in less than five years Fort Hood has been struck
by tragedy. As a Central Texan, this hits hard and hits home. I join
all Americans in offering my thoughts and prayers to those affected by
this shooting, especially the victims and their families. I am
confident that the nation will once again witness the bravery,
patriotism, and resilience of the entire Fort Hood community. Congress
and the Pentagon must examine how we can better protect our men and
women in uniform on our military bases.
I spoke on Fox News and with
KRIV Fox 26 Houston about this and you can watch the clips below.

On Wednesday the State Department gave assurances during a Homeland
Security Committee hearing I chaired that discussions are ongoing on
potentially extraditing El Chapo Guzman to the United States.
I
continue to push for extradition because it would ensure detainment and
eventual conviction of one of the most notorious drug cartel kingpins
in history.

Legislative Update
This week I introduced H.R. 4349, the Crude Oil Export Act.
This legislation would lift the 1970s era ban on the
export of American crude oil, most of which is being produced
underneath the feet of Texans in the Eagle Ford Shale and the Permian
Basin. Lifting the outdated ban on crude oil exports will result in
more production, create new jobs at home, and boost America's energy
security while providing countries like Ukraine with a dependable
supply alternative to energy imports from countries like Russia.
Finally, the House passed and I supported H.R. 2575, the Save American
Workers Act
. This bill will
restore the definition of full-time employment from 30 hours to 40
hours under ObamaCare.
Without this action, the Congressional Budget
Office estimates that 2.5 million full-time jobs will be lost as a
result of this misguided law.
