LEGISLATION
March 29, 2015
Dear David,
In recent weeks we have received numerous inquiries and complaints
about Daylight Savings Time.
Daylight Savings Time was
introduced in 1918 by President Woodrow Wilson and passed by Congress to
support the war efforts. From 1942 to 1945, Congress instituted war time
in which Daylight Savings Time lasted all year. Later Daylight
Savings Time was revised by Congress in 1966, 1973, and most recently in
2005 which extended the length by about a month.
Do you think Congress needs to
readdress Daylight Savings Time? Yes, choose one standard time and stop changing
it. No, it has a
purpose and works well. Adjust it, but dont eliminate it.
This is a waste of time to worry
about. *By answering this survey, you are subscribing to my newsletter. If you are having trouble, click here.
