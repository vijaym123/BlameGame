Proposing Solutions to Strengthen Flood Insurance Proposal to Benefit Homeowners and Taxpayers
I
urged House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Financial Services Ranking Member Maxine Waters
to
include two joint provisions in the House's proposal to address the exorbitant flood insurance rates by giving homeowners more options and more affordable prices that the government can't :
Give states the authority to license flood insurance.
Require that FEMA disclose available data, under appropriate privacy protocols, that provide the basis for risk premium rates for flood insurance. This will allow the private market to develop its own rates and procedures.
The House bill as currently drafted, with these additions, is a bill that would continue the spirit of reform, prevent the NFIP from incurring more debt, and lay the foundation for offloading flood risk from the taxpayer and onto the private market.
