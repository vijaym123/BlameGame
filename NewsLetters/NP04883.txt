Deciding to run for Congress was not a decision I made lightly. I knew that I wanted to make a difference. I knew that the country was headed in the wrong direction, and that I wanted to be a part of getting it back on track.
I thought to myself - I can complain about it, or I can do something about it.
So I threw my hat in the ring to represent the district I love, my home district, now known as California&#39;s 7th.
At that point, I had no idea what the future held in store.
Now I&#39;m in one of the most closely watched Congressional races in the country.
I&#39;m facing down a self-funding opponent and the millions of dollars his wealthy friends have thrown in on his behalf.
(Click here to help us fight back against those friends.)
I&#39;m enduring a smear campaign of epic proportions, with voters in the district seeing up to 100 false attack ads about me between now and Election Day.
But that&#39;s fine. Because I&#39;m proud of the campaign we&#39;ve put together. I&#39;m proud of the race we&#39;ve run, and the lives we&#39;ve touched, and most of all, of the grassroots team of supporters and volunteers that drive this entire operation.
This has never been my campaign. This has always been OUR campaign. And while I&#39;m not one to make predictions, I would much rather be me than Doug Ose. Because I have what he doesn&#39;t. I have you. In these next three days, let&#39;s show him what we&#39;ve got.
Give what you can to help us fight back , and let&#39;s get out there and win this thing.
Right now - in this moment, and in all moments - I&#39;m grateful.
Be well,
Ami
