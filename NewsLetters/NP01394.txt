Rep. Veaseys Statement on Loretta Lynch Confirmation
Washington, D.C.Today, Thursday, April 23, 2015, Congressman Marc Veasey, TX-33, released the following statement after the Senate confirmed Loretta Lynch as the Attorney General for the U.S. Department of Justice.
Today, after more than five months, the United States Senate confirmed Loretta Lynch, the first-ever African American woman to serve as Attorney General of the United States.
As our nation works towards reforming our justice and law enforcement policies to guarantee the safety of our communities, Lynchs extensive experience is important now more than ever. Just last month, the Department of Justice launched the
National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice
pilot program in Fort Worth, in the 33rd Congressional District, and we need a leader with her credentials to ensure its success.
I look forward to working with Attorney General Lynch as we build on the legacy left by Attorney General Holder, and reaffirm the universal right of equal justice under law.
