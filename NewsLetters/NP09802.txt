The Hill Report
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of May 5 - 9, 2014
On September 11, 2012, four brave Americans tragically lost their lives
in a terrorist attack on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi,
Libya. Since then, House Republicans have worked diligently to uncover
the truth through our existing committees that were equipped to
immediately begin probing into events surrounding the attack. Chairmen
Issa, McKeon, Rogers, and Royce conducted hearings and interviews
through which we have learned a great deal of information regarding the
Administration's inadequate response to the attack. I'm very proud of
the committees' efforts to obtain full and truthful answers from the
Administration.
Last week we learned that the Administration deliberately withheld
documents subpoenaed by the House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee for their investigation. This completely unacceptable
obstruction is what triggered our action this week. Because of the
Administration's refusal to cooperate with the House's constitutional
oversight authority, we must now concentrate our investigation into a
single select committee.
Congressman Pete Sessions talking on the House floor in support of
establishing the Benghazi Select Committee.
That is why I authored a resolution to establish the Select Committee
on the Events Surrounding the 2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi
.
This resolution was adopted in the House Rules Committee on Wednesday
and received approval by the full House today.
I look forward to
seeing the work of the new select committee led by Chairman Trey Gowdy
and hope that the American people will join us in demanding answers.
House Contempt Vote
As you may remember, former IRS official Lois Lerner has continually
refused to testify before the House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee during their investigation of the IRS scandal. Her refusal to
cooperate hinders the American people from learning the truth and
prevents Congress from fully understanding what happened in order to
protect taxpayers from future abuse.
In response, the House voted to hold Lois Lerner in contempt of
Congress. The intentional targeting of conservative groups by the IRS
is completely unacceptable and I believe that it is critical for us to
learn the full truth of what happened and ensure that the IRS is held
accountable for its outrageous misuse of resources and power.
Charter School Week
This week is National Charter Schools Week - a time to highlight the
importance of successful charter schools nationwide.
In honor of this
week, on Thursday the House passed a bipartisan proposal to strengthen
the Charter School Program and support choice, innovation, and
excellence in education.
In order to give our nation's students the
educational opportunities that they deserve, we need first-rate schools
and teachers in our communities. The Success and Opportunity through
Quality Charter Schools Act would increase the number of high-quality
charter schools and allow successful models to be replicated across the
country. To learn more, click here

R&D; Tax Credit
One of my top priorities in Congress is to provide our nation's job
creators with the economic certainty that they need so that they can
expand their businesses and create more jobs.
While the research and
development tax credit plays an important role in stimulating economic
growth, its temporary status creates needless uncertainty for American
businesses.
The American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2014, which passed the
House on Thursday with my support, would both simplify and make
permanent the R&D; tax credit.
This permanency will allow American
companies to confidently plan for the future, encourage innovation, and
ensure that our nation remains competitive in the global marketplace.
Have a good weekend.
Sincerely,
Pete Sessions
Member of Congress

Report
A
Weekly
Newsletter
from
Congressman
Pete
Sessions
Week
of
May
5
&#8211;
9,
2014
On
September
11,
2012,
four
brave
Americans
tragically
lost
their
lives
in
a
terrorist
attack
on
the
American
diplomatic
mission
in
Benghazi,
Libya.
Since
then,
House
Republicans
have
worked
diligently
to
uncover
the
truth
through
our
existing
committees
that
were
equipped
to
immediately
begin
probing
into
events
surrounding
the
attack.
Chairmen
Issa,
McKeon,
Rogers,
and
Royce
conducted
hearings
and
interviews
through
which
we
have
learned
a
great
deal
of
information
regarding
the
Administration&#8217;s
inadequate
response
to
the
attack.
I&#8217;m
very
proud
of
the
committees&#8217;
efforts
to
obtain
full
and
truthful
answers
from
the
Administration.
Last
week
we
learned
that
the
Administration
deliberately
withheld
documents
subpoenaed
by
the
House
Oversight
and
Government
Reform
Committee
for
their
investigation.
This
completely
unacceptable
obstruction
is
what
triggered
our
action
this
week.
Because
of
the
Administration&#8217;s
refusal
to
cooperate
with
the
House&#8217;s
constitutional
oversight
authority,
we
must
now
concentrate
our
investigation
into
a
single
select
committee.
Congressman
Pete
Sessions
talking
on
the
House
floor
in
support
of
establishing
the
Benghazi
Select
Committee. That
is
why
I
authored
a
resolution
to
establish
the
Select
Committee
on
the
Events
Surrounding
the
2012
Terrorist
Attack
in
Benghazi .
This
resolution
was
adopted
in
the
House
Rules
Committee
on
Wednesday
and
received
approval
by
the
full
House
today.
I
look
forward
to
seeing
the
work
of
the
new
select
committee
led
by
Chairman
Trey
Gowdy
and
hope
that
the
American
people
will
join
us
in
demanding
answers.
House
Contempt
Vote
As
you
may
remember,
former
IRS
official
Lois
Lerner
has
continually
refused
to
testify
before
the
House
Oversight
and
Government
Reform
Committee
during
their
investigation
of
the
IRS
scandal.
Her
refusal
to
cooperate
hinders
the
American
people
from
learning
the
truth
and
prevents
Congress
from
fully
understanding
what
happened
in
order
to
protect
taxpayers
from
future
abuse.
In
response,
the
House
voted
to
hold
Lois
Lerner
in
contempt
of
Congress.
The
intentional
targeting
of
conservative
groups
by
the
IRS
is
completely
unacceptable
and
I
believe
that
it
is
critical
for
us
to
learn
the
full
truth
of
what
happened
and
ensure
that
the
IRS
is
held
accountable
for
its
outrageous
misuse
of
resources
and
power.
Charter
School
Week
This
week
is
National
Charter
Schools
Week
&#8211;
a
time
to
highlight
the
importance
of
successful
charter
schools
nationwide.
In
honor
of
this
week,
on
Thursday
the
House
passed
a
bipartisan
proposal
to
strengthen
the
Charter
School
Program
and
support
choice,
innovation,
and
excellence
in
education .
In
order
to
give
our
nation&#8217;s
students
the
educational
opportunities
that
they
deserve,
we
need
first-rate
schools
and
teachers
in
our
communities.
The
Success
and
Opportunity
through
Quality
Charter
Schools
Act
would
increase
the
number
of
high-quality
charter
schools
and
allow
successful
models
to
be
replicated
across
the
country.

R&amp;D
Tax
Credit
One
of
my
top
priorities
in
Congress
is
to
provide
our
nation&#8217;s
job
creators
with
the
economic
certainty
that
they
need
so
that
they
can
expand
their
businesses
and
create
more
jobs.
While
the
research
and
development
tax
credit
plays
an
important
role
in
stimulating
economic
growth,
its
temporary
status
creates
needless
uncertainty
for
American
businesses.
The
American
Research
and
Competitiveness
Act
of
2014 ,
which
passed
the
House
on
Thursday
with
my
support,
would
both
simplify
and
make
permanent
the
R&amp;D
tax
credit.
This
permanency
will
allow
American
companies
to
confidently
plan
for
the
future,
encourage
innovation,
and
ensure
that
our
nation
remains
competitive
in
the
global
marketplace.
Have
a
good
weekend.

Pete
