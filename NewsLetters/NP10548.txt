Our discussions centered on ways in which collaboration could occur to promote the region as a center for the unmanned aircraft industry.

Purple Up! Day
[cid:image014.jpg@01CF5A58.CF574A60]
"Purple Up!" Day was April 15th, a day to recognize the amazing sacrifices that military youth make every time their mother, father, or close family member is called into duty at home or abroad. Purple is the color that symbolizes all branches of the military because it is a combination of Army green, Marine red, Coast Guard Navy and Air Force blue. The Northland Community and Technical College Conference attendees each wore a purple ribbon to honor these children.
This Week in American History

Balcony in Ford's Theatre
On April 14th, 1865, John Wilkes Booth, an actor and Confederate sympathizer, assassinated President Abraham Lincoln during a play at Ford's Theatre in downtown Washington, D.C. Booth and six fellow conspirators had originally planned on kidnapping Lincoln and bringing him to Richmond, VA, the Confederate capital. However, Lincoln never showed where they planned to execute the kidnapping. With the Confederate states losing in April, Booth used a desperate plan to try and save the Confederacy by assassinating Lincoln. After fatally shooting the president, he lept down onto the stage and shouted "Sic simper tyrannis! [Thus always to tyrants]-the South is avenged!" Booth fled but was eventually found in Bowling Green, VA. He was discovered dead with a self-inflicted gunshot. Lincoln was buried in Springfield, IL on May 4th, 1865.
