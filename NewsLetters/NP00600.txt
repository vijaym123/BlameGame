Honoring our Fallen
Heroes
Today, we remember and honor the brave men and women who
have made the ultimate sacrifice so that we might live in a free nation.
These heroes have given their lives so that the forces of terrorism
cannot succeed, so that millions around the world can be liberated from
tyranny and so that America remains a beacon of hope and freedom to
the world.
On Memorial Day, as we honor the sacrifice of so many, we also
recommit ourselves to the cause of liberty for which they fought. We
express our heartfelt gratitude to the families who have lost a loved-one,
who have given to this nation their fathers, mothers, brothers,
sisters, husbands and wives, sons and daughters. In Georgia, our proud
tradition of military service has meant that too many in our community
have known the loss of a friend or family member who died in defense of
our nation. Today we reach out our hand in fellowship, to comfort and
to say thank you for all they and their loved ones have done for
America.
We
must always remember our fallen heroes and honor them by striving to
build a nation worthy of their sacrifice. May we never take for
granted the freedoms for which they fought and died. May God continue to
bless them, their families and our great
nation.
