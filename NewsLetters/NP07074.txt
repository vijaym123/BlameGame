Friends,
It was a busy
week in OH-14, but the most important day was definitely Monday when
Kelly and I celebrated our 24th wedding anniversary! Here's a photo of us
right after our son Trenton was born:
We haven't changed a
bit, right?
Here are some other events from the past
week:
Equipping our Coast
Guard
It was an honor to celebrate the grand opening of the new Coast Guard
Station Fairport on Friday. The men and women who serve our state and
country there as members of the U.S. Coast Guard are vital to keeping
our waters safe.
My father was a World War II veteran
and a Purple Heart recipient who was left for dead on the battlefield. I
have his Purple Heart in my office and look at it every day as a
reminder of all those who choose to bravely serve our country. They all
deserve nothing less than our greatest respect and
gratitude.
Protecting the Great Lakes
I met with
Captain David Spangler and representatives from the National Wildlife
Federation on Wednesday to discuss the impacts of the algae bloom on Lake
Erie. The recent water ban in Toledo was yet another example of why
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative funding is so crucial.
The
Great Lakes hold 85 percent of the North America's surface fresh
water, providing drinking water to 40 million. They also have 1.5 million
jobs directly connected to them. Protecting our Great Lakes is crucial
because of both their economic and environmental
significance.
Supporting Local Industry
On
Tuesday, I had the opportunity to visit Gabriel Performance Products in
Ashtabula. Following a plant tour, I sat down for a roundtable discussion
with employees to talk about healthcare costs, excessive regulations
and pro-growth energy policies.
Its always encouraging
to see innovation on display at our local Northeast Ohio industries.
Gabriel Performance Products is already an important job creator in
Ashtabula, but the company is also training the next generation of
employees through partnerships with local schools. These types of programs
are exactly what we need to grow our economy and connect people with
good jobs.
