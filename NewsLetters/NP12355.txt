Dear Friends,
It's a new year filled with both opportunities and challenges for the
country. Last week the President went before Congress to deliver his
annual report on the State of the Union.
I was extremely disappointed that the President would use the
opportunity to give what I believe to be a speech that divides the
country instead of focusing on issues that can bring both parties
together. I found the President's insistence on bypassing Congress and
implementing his agenda through executive orders to be particularly
disturbing.
Our Founding Fathers could have given us a King, but instead created
the Presidency, the Congress, and the courts. When a President decides
to bypass Congress, he sends our country down a very dangerous path and
makes governing extremely difficult achieve.
You'll be happy to know that the South Carolina congressional
delegation is turning our concern into action, and has rallied behind
legislation introduced by Congressman Tom Rice to take the President to
court over his President overreach.
Here's a clip from a press conference last week where I spoke about the
need for the House to pass the STOP Resolution and take the President
to court.

Dear
Friends,
It&#8217;s
a
new
year
filled
with
both
opportunities
and
challenges
for
the
country.
Last
week
the
President
went
before
Congress
to
deliver
his
annual
report
on
the
State
of
the
Union.
I
was
extremely
disappointed
that
the
President
would
use
the
opportunity
to
give what
I
believe
to
be
a
speech
that
divides
the
country instead
of focusing
on
issues
that
can
bring
both
parties
together.
I
found
the
President&#8217;s
insistence
on
bypassing
Congress
and
implementing
his
agenda
through
executive
orders
to
be
particularly
disturbing.
Our
Founding
Fathers
could
have
given
us
a
King,
but
instead
created
the
Presidency,
the
Congress,
and
the
courts.
When
a
President
decides
to
bypass
Congress,
he
sends
our
country
down
a
very
dangerous
path
and
makes
governing
extremely
difficult
achieve.
You&#8217;ll
be
happy
to
know
that
the
South
Carolina
congressional
delegation
is
turning
our
concern
into
action,
and
has
rallied
behind
legislation
introduced
by
Congressman
Tom
Rice
to
take
the
President
to
court
over
his
President
overreach.
Here&#8217;s
a

a
press

last

where
I

the
need

the
