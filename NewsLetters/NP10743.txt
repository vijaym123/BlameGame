Rep. Miller: Civil Rights Act Put Nation
on Path to Fulfill Promise of Equal Protection Under the Law
Washington
&#8211; Today, U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10) issued the following statement on the LBJ Presidential Library Civil Rights Summit underway in Austin, TX to celebrate the
50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964:
&#8220;This week, the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the historic partnership between President Lyndon Johnson and Martin Luther King Jr. which made it possible are being commemorated at a civil rights summit in Austin, Texas.
&#8220;President Obama, along with presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, will attend. The event and their presence are fitting tributes to one of the
most important legislative acts of the 20th century, a landmark measure barring discrimination based on race, religion, gender or national origin.
&#8220;The Civil Rights Act and its progeny, like the Voting Rights Act of 1965, set our nation on a path toward fulfillment of the century-old promise contained in the
14th Amendment to the Constitution that gave every citizen the right to equal protection under the law.
&#8220;In the half century since its enactment, we have seen the dismantling of Jim Crow discrimination, the election of our country's first African-American president
and the elevation of women to the top ranks of business and government.
&#8220;The path has not always been straight or smooth. But neither was the process by which the Civil Rights Act became law - first proposed by President Kennedy but
only passed with bi-partisan support in Congress after his assassination.
&#8220;Yet there should be no doubt about our direction, irrevocably set toward redemption of the pledge contained in our Declaration of Independence that &quot;all Men are
created equal (and) endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.&quot;
