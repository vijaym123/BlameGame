Statement on the Situation on the Southern
Border
6/11/14
"I do not support amnesty of any kind, and I never have. The wave of
illegal immigrants currently at our southern border is overwhelming
our Border Patrol and other service organizations. Even the Secretary
of Homeland Security is now describing this as a problem. President
Obama making empty promises has created a humanitarian crisis. The
House will not be voting on the Senate-passed immigratio n
bill and I will oppose any amnesty, to any person, of any age, that is
not going through our legal immigration process."
"I have
always stood strong against illegal immigration. I have voted against
the DREAM Act and have supported reforming the 14th Amendment to end
birthright citizenship. I helped bring a new Immigration and Customs
Enforcement office to Colorado Springs and have always been a strong
supporter of securing our border. Until our border is secure, we must not
even consider extending amnesty. The President will not even enforce
the laws currently on the books, so why should we pass more laws for
him to ignore?"
