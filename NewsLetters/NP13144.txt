MARK YOUR CALENDARS
2014 MARCH FOR LIFE
On Wednesday, January 22, 2014, the 41 st
Annual March for Life will be held in Washington, D.C. in recognition of the somber anniversary of the Supreme Courts
Roe v. Wade
decision.
The March for Life will feature a rally with pro-life lawmakers, followed by a march along the National Mall, to the Supreme Court.
Pro-life citizens from across the country, including many from northern Ohio, make the trek to D.C. every year to rally for life at the foot of the U.S. Capitol.
If you plan to be in Washington, D.C. for the March for Life, I would like to invite you to a reception from 1:00pm
5:00pm.
It will be held in the Rayburn House Office Building, room 2322.
For more information, please see the flyer
here .
Whether in Ohio or Washington, D.C., the March for Life represents an important opportunity to support the lives of the unborn and make sure your voice is heard for life.
