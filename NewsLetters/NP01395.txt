Friend,
Jesse Lewis was known to family and friends as having emotional intelligence far beyond his years &mdash; gifts of empathy, resilience, self-awareness, confidence and compassion, love and hope. I believe we can instill these qualities in our students nationwide if we give our teachers the right tools and training.
I&rsquo;ve introduced a bill in memory of Jesse&rsquo;s great gifts &mdash; which I saw in his home when I visited with his mother, Scarlett Lewis, days after he lost his life in the tragic shooting at Newtown. Inscribed in that home on his chalkboard are three words: Nurturing. Healing. Love. Those words are a continuing inspiration to me and countless others. While I continue to pursue additional efforts to reduce gun violence, the Jesse Lewis Empowering Educators Act will provide teachers across the country with more training to teach their students about social and emotional learning concepts.

We know that children learn with their hearts as well as their heads, and both need educating. Countless studies and common sense show that children who learn to manage their emotions, play and interact positively with their peers, and constructively resolve conflicts are less likely to resort to bullying, physical violence and self-destructive behavior.
This bill would enable educators to use some of the $2.35 billion in federal professional development funding for social and emotional training for teachers. We have an opportunity and an obligation to provide such training. The research and best practices are in place right now &mdash; all we need is funding.
