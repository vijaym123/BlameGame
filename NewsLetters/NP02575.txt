Blaine's Bulletin
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has pushed full steam ahead with a plan to take control of the Internet.
The FCC did this in the name of net neutrality, the concept that would require all legal content found on the Internet to be treated equally. That means that streaming video services cant pay more to secure more bandwidth and faster speeds for their customers, and it also means that Internet service providers cant slow down the service of customers using lots of bandwidth to watch movies or play video games in favor of customers who check their email and browse the Internet.
This is an idea worth serious thought and debate, but what the FCC did goes far beyond equal treatment of content.
In 2011, the FCC issued an Open Internet Order which prohibited broadband service providers from blocking any legal content on their networks, and prohibited fixed broadband providers from prioritizing, through pricing or the awarding of bandwidth, among legal content providers.
Then, just a little over a year ago, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia invalidated parts of the Open Internet Order. Basically, the court struck down the rules prohibiting blocking and discrimination, but allowed the rules requiring disclosures of Internet traffic management policies to stand.
In efforts to side step the Court of Appeals, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler proposed a 332-page measure to undermine the courts decision and reclassify broadband as a telecommunications service. Even more troubling, the FCC will not offer full disclosure of the documents until after the commission votes on it
which took place on Feb. 26, 2015. What we do know is that this measure would turn Internet service providers into public utilities, rather than information services.
By extension, that means the government would be able to regulate and tax the Internet like it does water, electricity, or television services.
I have several concerns about the direction that the FCC has taken. First, I am very concerned with Chairman Wheelers refusal to release the documents to the public and the overall lack of transparency involved in the agencys rule-making. Even more alarming, the possibility of restrictions on an open Internet
have the potential to hit
60 million rural Americans the hardest, including those living in the 3 rd
District of Missouri. It will also stifle innovation and could lead to high taxes on a service essential for economic activity.
The recent vote of the FCC is not the end of this fight; rather, it is only the beginning. The FCCs unprecedented action will likely spark years of lawsuits and cause years of uncertainty for many Americans who depend on reliable Internet service each and every day.
In the coming weeks, Ill be working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find a solution that protects an open Internet, its users, and encourages innovation and investment.
