The Death Tax Repeal
Act
During a time of grieving over
the loss of a loved one, the last thing a family should have to worry
about is the financial burden of the death tax. Last week, I was
pleased to support the repeal of the the 40 percent tax on one's estate.
This onerous tax has been identified as a primary cause for the
dissolution of family businesses - and only accounts for a small portion of
federal revenue. When families are working hard to build a legacy in
order to pass down opportunities to their future generations
they
shouldnt be punished by the federal government with burdensome additional
taxation. The Death Tax Repeal Act passed in the U.S. House by a vote
of 240 to 179 and now awaits consideration by the U.S. Senate.

Visit to Tubular Bells Oil
Rig
Recently, I had the opportunity to visit the Tubular Bells oil
rig on the 2015 Offshore Energy Tour with House Majority Whip Steve
Scalise in South Louisiana. I joined a bipartisan, diverse
Congressional delegation in touring the oil rig and learning how American energy
is safely produced. These energy projects are crucial to American
energy independence, job creation, and our nation security - and I enjoyed
exploring Hess' Tubular Bells oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico to see
energy production
firsthand .

GOP Freshmen
Thursday, 16 Apr 2015
By John
Gizzi
Less than six months after she became the first female U.S.
representative from Orange County, California (and only the eighth Republican
woman to have served in the House from the Golden State), Mimi Walters

leaders listen to.
Walters, 52 and a mother of
four, is the liaison of the 43 Republican House U.S. Representatives to

hierarchy.
