A Sensible
Domestic Energy Policy Will Make Life
Easier for Virginia Families
Dear Friend,
As I travel across the Fifth District, I
consistently hear about the numerous
negative impacts high fuel costs create.
High gas prices hurt families trying to pay
their bills, making it more expensive to
fill their tanks and increasing the price
of groceries and other goods. Exorbitant
fuel prices harm small businesses and
family farms that need reliable energy to
operate their machinery, inhibiting their
ability to succeed and grow. There is no
question that Americans continue to suffer
from Washingtons failure to adopt a
sensible energy policy, but in the past few
weeks, we have received some much-needed
relief from high fuel costs.
Recently, American consumers have been
spending less at the pump, with the
national average dropping to
$2.23
a gallon . The economic benefits of this
trend are immediate - consumers have more
money in their pockets to spend on other
goods and services and small businesses can
invest in new jobs and equipment rather
than spend so much on fuel. These prices
have lightened the burden on our families
and small businesses, but we must do more
to ensure that prices continue to remain
affordable. Our work toward an energy
strategy that permanently increases oil and
gas production, expands our viable
alternative energies, and promotes
conservation remains vitally important to
easing the burden on working families and
generating job growth.
As the 114th Congress begins, we will
promote policies that will make it easier
for our farmers, our Main Street
businesses, and our working families to
succeed, and this includes pursuing a
robust domestic energy policy. Within the
next few weeks, we plan to consider the
Keystone XL Pipeline, a crucial piece of
our energy strategy aimed at increasing
North American energy production and giving
Americans more affordable energy
choices.
It is my hope that we will also consider
legislation to reopen lease sales for oil
and natural gas exploration off the coast
of Virginia and policies that expedite the
process for offshore renewable energy
development, like wind. It is time that we
take advantage of the numerous natural
resources Virginia has to offer and
overcome the barriers to energy
independence and job creation.
Now that the American people have given
us new leadership in the Senate, we have a
new opportunity to create a sensible and
robust domestic energy policy. I look
forward to continuing to work with my
colleagues to create an energy policy that
increases our energy security and
strengthens our economy, and I hope that in
the 114th Congress the Senate and the
President will join us in this crucial
effort.
