Weekly Column: We Must Work Together
Last week, millions of Americans across the country tuned in to watch
President Obama's State of the Union address. We can all agree that the
President delivered his speech eloquently; however, if his previous
five State of the Union addresses and the action that followed are any
indication of what we can expect down the road - this was simply more
rhetoric.

January Jobs Report
Northeast Ohioans and Americans everywhere continue to look for relief
from economic hardships that are the result of more regulations, higher
taxes, and a health care law that is destroying jobs and raising costs
for hardworking individuals and families. Today's discouraging
unemployment report is further evidence that our economy remains
stagnant, and it comes at the heels of the Congressional Budget Office's
report, which indicated that the President's health care law will
reduce full-time employment for millions in the coming years. We in the
House of Representatives are committed to advancing pro-growth
solutions that will lead to the strong recovery that Americans are
waiting for. It's time for the Senate and the President to join us.
