Morning Joe
Friend -- MSNBC&rsquo;s
Morning Joe
reports, &ldquo;There are about 10 states where there are races within 3, 4 points --
this is unlike anything we&rsquo;ve ever seen in a recent election.&rdquo;
But can we win?
Morning Joe
says,
&ldquo;If Democrats execute on the ground... they&rsquo;ll hold the Senate.&rdquo;
Here&rsquo;s our victory plan:
Projections show our Final Weekend Get Out The Vote Push will get up to 575,000 Democrats to the polls.
We&rsquo;ll knock on 1.5 MILLION doors and call 2 MILLION voters.
But the scary truth:
If we can&rsquo;t fill our $1,740,814 GOTV budget hole by the end-of-month deadline in 48 hours, tens of thousands of voters will never be contacted.
We&rsquo;d lose the Senate at the last second.
TRIPLE-MATCH: Will you pitch in before the end-of-month deadline in 48 hours so we can Get Out The Vote and WIN the Senate?
