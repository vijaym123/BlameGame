Texas Reps Call for Investigation into Alleged Misconduct at Local VA
Clinic
Earlier this week, I led 23 members of the Texas delegation in calling
for an Inspector General investigation into allegations that Veterans
Affairs officials in Central Texas manipulated medical appointment data
in order to conceal long wait times for veterans seeking care.
According to media reports, employees at three Central Texas VA clinics
were instructed by supervisors to ensure that wait times for veterans
were as "close to zero days as possible."
An employee of Veterans
Affairs claims that staffers falsely logged patients' desired
appointment dates to closely coincide with appointment openings. But in
reality, veterans were left waiting for months.
The brave men and women who serve our nation deserve better. The policy
of falsifying medical records is dishonest, deceptive, and injurious to
veterans. Swift action must be taken to protect the health and
well-being of our nation's veterans.

House Holds Former IRS Official in Contempt
Recently, the House of Representatives voted to hold former IRS
official Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress for her refusal to testify
regarding the IRS targeting scandal. The House also approved a measure
calling on Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a special prosecutor
to investigate current and former IRS officials for the selective
targeting of conservative organizations and individuals.
In 2013, the Treasury Department Inspector General reported that IRS
officials had targeted conservative individuals and organizations for
additional screening based solely on their political views. A
congressional investigation concluded that Ms. Lerner played a central
role in the targeting scandal. But so far, the Obama administration has
taken no action to hold the IRS accountable.
Targeting organizations or individuals for their political views
threatens our democracy. The actions of Ms. Lerner and other IRS
officials were clearly unethical and may have been criminal.
We need a
special prosecutor, independent of the political pressures of the Obama
administration, to conduct a thorough investigation. If any IRS
officials are found to have broken the law, they must be prosecuted.

ICE Releases Thousands of Dangerous Criminal Immigrants
According to a Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) report, the Obama
administration released thousands of dangerous criminal immigrants back
into American communities-including individuals convicted of murder,
rape, violent drug offenses and drunk driving. This would be considered
the worst prison break in American history, except it was sanctioned by
the President and perpetrated by our own immigration officials.
In 2013, ICE officials released more than 36,000 criminal immigrants
who had nearly 88,000 convictions. Administration officials want the
American people to think these individuals were guilty of minor, petty
offenses.
But the convictions tell a chilling story.
According to documents obtained by CIS, the crimes committed by the
released immigrants include nearly 200 convictions of homicide, over
400 sexual assault convictions, more than 300 kidnapping convictions,
and upwards of 16,000 drunk or drugged driving convictions. These
criminal immigrants should have been deported to ensure that they could
never commit crimes on U.S. soil.
But instead, ICE officials chose not
to detain them and instead released them back onto American streets.
The Administration's actions are outrageous.
They willfully and
knowingly put the interests of criminal immigrants before the safety
and security of the American people.

Bipartisan Bill Holds NSA Accountable
America's intelligence community has a responsibility not only to
protect our national security but also to respect our civil liberties.
Following September 11, Congress gave the intelligence community
additional authority to help track down and stop foreign terrorists
intending to harm Americans. Over a decade later, we are still engaged
in a global fight with radical Islamic terrorist organizations. To keep
America safe, we must use every tool available to us.
But that does not mean that our civil liberties should be ignored in
the name of national security. We need increased accountability to
ensure that our civil liberties are protected and our nation is secured.
That's why I introduced bipartisan legislation to increase oversight of
the National Security Agency. The NSA Internal Watchdog Act (H.R. 4533)
enhances the role of the NSA Inspector General and guarantees there is
an independent and powerful watchdog that will ensure the activities of
the intelligence community are both lawful and Constitutional.
