ISSUES
March 30, 2014
Dear Friend,
When something is broken, it should be fixed. It's clear our
immigration system is broken, yet legislation aimed at repairing it has
been stalled in Congress for far too long.
A majority of Americans and
over 636 business organizations, countless religious leaders, advocacy
organizations and many others from all ends of the political spectrum,
agree that passing immigration reform is not only the morally sound
thing to do, but is also the fiscally responsible thing to do.
There is no doubt that comprehensive immigration reform would be
critically beneficial for our nation.
*
Good for our nation's wallet: Just this week, the non-partisan
Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reaffirmed what we've known all along
- the House's comprehensive immigration reform bill, H.R. 15, would
slash our deficit by about $900 billion over 20 years.
*
More jobs: Passing immigration reform would lead to an average
increase of 121,000 jobs annually according to the Center for American
Progress.
*
Boosts economic growth: A special report from S&P;'s Chief U.S.
Economist noted immigration reform would add an additional 3.2
percentage points to real GDP growth in the first decade--or an average
additional annual growth of 0.3%.
As Texans, we have a profound understanding of the importance of
passing immigration reform. Immigrants are an important part of our
state's growing economy and long term prosperity. They create jobs, are
leaders in innovation, and invest in the economy.
In Texas:
*
Nearly a quarter of business owners are immigrants
*
More than 256,000 immigrants became new business owners between
2006-2010 and generated $10 billion in total net business income
*
Over 73.8 percent of patents from the University of Texas
system in 2011 had at least one foreign-born inventor.
It is time we repair our broken immigration system, because we know
that the longer Congress fails to act, the greater the need becomes. We
should not fear those who want to contribute to our economy and have
proven to be hard-working, law-abiding folks.
We should be using every tool at our disposal to ensure that Congress
takes action. That is why I joined my colleagues in filing a discharge
petition to demand a vote in the House on a bi-partisan, comprehensive
immigration reform bill.
We stood together on the steps of the U.S.
Capitol - during a snow storm - to demand a vote on immigration reform.
Like the majority of Americans, we know the time is now to strengthen
our economy and spur innovation, welcome folks out of the shadows, and
ensure our borders are secure.
One Day Left to Enroll in Quality, Affordable Healthcare
Tomorrow, Monday, March 31st, is the last day to enroll in a healthcare
plan under the Affordable Care Act.
Millions of Americans have already
enrolled in plans and are reaping the benefits of having quality,
affordable healthcare coverage.
These healthcare plans are already
making a positive difference for nearly 300,000 Texans who now have
access to essential health services such as preventative care exams and
cancer screenings.
I led a discussion in the chamber of the House of Representatives
earlier this week on the importance of affordable, quality healthcare
available to millions of Americans through the healthcare marketplace
exchanges. I encourage you to check out our conversation below:
And if you haven't done so already, there is still time to check out
your options for affordable, quality healthcare insurance before the
enrollment deadline tomorrow.
If you miss this deadline, you won't be
able to enroll in a plan until next year.
You can explore your options
online or there are all-day enrollment events going on around San
Antonio today and tomorrow to assist folks in exploring their options
and selecting a coverage plan that is best for them and their families.
Here are some helpful resources:

Dear
Friend,
When
something
is
broken,
it
should
be
fixed.
It&#8217;s
clear
our
immigration
system
is
broken,
yet
legislation
aimed
at
repairing
it
has
been
stalled
in
Congress
for
far
too
long.
A
majority
of
Americans
and
over
636
business
organizations,
countless
religious
leaders,
advocacy
organizations
and
many
others
from
all
ends
of
the
political
spectrum,
agree
that
passing
immigration
reform
is
not
only
the
morally
sound
thing
to
do,
but
is
also
the
fiscally
responsible
thing
to
do.
There
is
no
doubt
that
comprehensive
immigration
reform
would
be
critically
beneficial
for
our
nation.
Good
for
our
nation&#8217;s
wallet:
Just
this
week,
the
non-partisan
Congressional
Budget
Office
(CBO)
reaffirmed
what
we've
known
all
along
&#8211;
the
House's
comprehensive
immigration
reform
bill,
H.R.
15,
would
slash
our
deficit
by
about
$900
billion
over
20
years.
More
jobs:
Passing
immigration
reform
would
lead
to
an
average
increase
of
121,000
jobs
annually
according
to
the
Center
for
American
Progress. Boosts
economic
growth:
A
special
report
from
S&amp;P&#8217;s
Chief
U.S.
Economist
noted
immigration
reform
would
add
an
additional
3.2
percentage
points
to
real
GDP
growth
in
the
first
decade--or
an
average
additional
annual
growth
of
0.3%.
As
Texans,
we
have
a
profound
understanding
of
the
importance
of
passing
immigration
reform. Immigrants
are
an
important
part
of
our
state&#8217;s
growing
economy
and
long
term
prosperity. They
create
jobs,
are
leaders
in
innovation,
and
invest
in
the
economy.
In
Texas:
Nearly
a
quarter
of
business
owners
are
immigrants More
than
256,000
immigrants
became
new
business
owners
between
2006-2010
and
generated
$10
billion
in
total
net
business
income Over
73.8
percent
of
patents
from
the
University
of
Texas
system
in
2011
had
at
least
one
foreign-born
inventor.
It
is
time
we
repair
our
broken
immigration
system,
because
we
know
that
the
longer
Congress
fails
to
act,
the
greater
the
need
becomes. We
should
not
fear
those
who
want
to
contribute
to
our
economy
and
have
proven
to
be
hard-working,
law-abiding
folks.
We
should
be
using
every
tool
at
our
disposal
to
ensure
that
Congress
takes
action.
That
is
why
I
joined
my
colleagues
in
filing
a
discharge
petition
to
demand
a
vote
in
the
House
on
a
bi-partisan,
comprehensive
immigration
reform
bill.
We
stood
together
on
the
steps
of
the
U.S.
Capitol
&#8211;
during
a
snow
storm
&#8211;
to
demand
a
vote
on
immigration
reform. Like
the
majority
of
Americans,
we
know
the
time
is
now
to
strengthen
our
economy
and
spur
innovation,
welcome
folks
out
of
the
shadows,
and
ensure
our
borders
are
secure.
One
Day
Left
to
Enroll
in
Quality,
Affordable
Healthcare
Tomorrow,
Monday,
March
31 st ,
is
the
last
day
to
enroll
in
a
healthcare
plan
under
the
Affordable
Care
Act.
Millions
of
Americans
have
already
enrolled
in
plans
and
are
reaping
the
benefits
of
having
quality,
affordable
healthcare
coverage.
These
healthcare
plans
are
already
making
a
positive
difference
for
nearly
300,000
Texans
who
now
have
access
to
essential
health
services
such
as
preventative
care
exams
and
cancer
screenings.
I
led
a
discussion
in
the
chamber
of
the
House
of
Representatives
earlier
this
week
on
the
importance
of
affordable,
quality
healthcare
available
to
millions
of
Americans
through
the
healthcare
marketplace
exchanges. I
encourage
you
to
check
out
our
conversation
below:
And
if
you
haven&#8217;t
done
so
already,
there
is
still
time
to
check
out
your
options
for
affordable,
quality
healthcare
insurance
before
the
enrollment
deadline
tomorrow.
If
you
miss
this
deadline,
you
won&#8217;t
be

to
enroll
in
a

until
next
year.
You
can

online
or
there
are
