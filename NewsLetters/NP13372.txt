Merry Christmas and Happy New Year
The Christmas season is a wonderful opportunity to reflect on the gifts God has provided. They are what is truly important in life, and I am very grateful for every blessing. During this time with friends and family, please take a moment to remember and honor our service members who keep us safe and secure, especially those serving miles away from home.
As we gather together to celebrate the holidays, I also look forward to the year ahead, and the work that must be accomplished. Important issues like jobs and the economy, our growing national debt, tax reform, health care and more demand our attention, and I remain committed to working with anyone interested in finding real solutions.
It is an honor to serve as Representative for the people of Arkansass Second District, and I wish you and your loved ones a Merry Christmas and a blessed, Happy New Year.
Sincerely,
Tim
