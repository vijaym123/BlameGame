Congressman Yoder on President Obama's
Unconstitutional Amnesty Plan
"The Presidents plan to grant
amnesty to those who have entered this country illegally is
unconstitutional. I strongly oppose his unilateral efforts to ignore federal law
and will support any legislative means possible to stop these actions
including using the power of the purse to defund these unprecedented
measures.
"If there was any question
about the unlawful nature of this plan, we need only to look back to
President Obamas own words:
'there are enough laws on the books by
Congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our
immigration system. That for me to simply, through executive order,
ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate
role as President.'
"As many
as 25 times, the President has said that the maneuvers which he is
taking today are not allowable under our system of democracy. These
actions ignore the will of the people who elected and sent their
representation to Washington and Congress should use all of the tools at their
disposal to prohibit these unconstitutional
acts."
