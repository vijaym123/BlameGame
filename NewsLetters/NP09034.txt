Statement on Proposed New EPA
Regulations
6/2/14
Regarding the latest Obama Administration proposal that calls for
the EPA to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent from 2005
levels by 2030, Congressman Doug Lamborn released the following
statement:
"President Obama and the EPA seem determined to artificially
increase the cost of energy and harm the pocketbooks of the American people.
American's deserve an all of the above energy plan that includes
clean, cost-efficient coal. I will use my position in Congress to advance
comprehensive energy legislation that recognizes the true fiscal and
economic realities facing America's families and businesses. Low-cost
energy must be a critical part of our nation's energy
future."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
