Dear Friend,
The 2014 Pennsylvania 9th District Congressional
Art Competition gives high school students across the area the chance
to showcase their artistic talent, with one winner being invited to
display their artwork in the U.S. Capitol. To enter, each high school in
the 9th District is invited to submit one piece of student art
representing the talents of their student body.
Always With Us, the 2013 winner by Sarah Stauffer of Indiana Area
Senior High School.
This year, my office will be working with the Southern Alleghenies
Museum of Art in Loretto, where the museum will be showcasing all entries
from Thursday, April 3 to Sunday, April 14.
All artists are asked to create a piece that
reflects the unique character of the 9th District, whether it is a theme,
attraction, person, place, or
event.
Submissions must be delivered to my Hollidaysburg Office located at 310 Penn
Street, Suite 200 Hollidaysburg, PA 16648
The deadline is
Tuesday, April 1.
All artwork should be no larger than
28 x 28 x 3 including the frame.
Students must also
include a completed consent form that can be found at
http://www.house.gov/content/educate/art_competition/.
For any questions, please contact the Hollidaysburg
office at 1-800-854-3035 or 814-696-6318.
