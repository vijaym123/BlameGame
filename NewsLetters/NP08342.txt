Miller: Supreme Courts Decision Confirms Presidents Constitutional Overreach
WASHINGTON
Today, U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10) issued the following statement after the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled against the Presidents overreach when making recess appointments while Congress is in session :
The separation of powers enshrined by our founders in the Constitution is vital to preserve our democratic republic.
Today, the U.S. Supreme Court stood up for the Constitution and the rule of law by striking
down the unconstitutional recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board made by President Obama. The Court also invalidated decisions made by a board comprised by unconstitutional action.
This is further confirmation that the President has, in many instances, been operating well beyond the limits of the Constitution. This ruling is an important and overdue judicial check on overreach by this
President and any future President.
In the coming weeks, I intend to support further actions in the House to defend the Constitution, protect our cherished system of government based on the separation of powers, and make very clear that every American is
equal under the law.
