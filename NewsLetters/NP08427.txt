Message from Congressman Keith Ellison
Dear Neighbor -
Residents of the Twin Cities have always shared a lot, including the
experience of sitting in traffic on I-94W trying to get between
Minneapolis and St. Paul.
Not anymore.
Last Saturday I joined construction workers, public officials, and
Minnesotans from all over the state at the grand opening of the Central
Corridor train. The Green Line will travel 11 miles from Downtown
Minneapolis to Downtown St. Paul, making stops at the University of
Minnesota, Target Field, and the Minnesota State Capitol. It was great
to ride the new train with friends like Senator Klobuchar, Senator
Franken, and Mayor Betsy Hodges.
Rep. Ellison riding the new Central Corridor Commuter Train
The opening of the Central Corridor is the product of years of our
community's hard work. The engineers, construction workers, and public
officials who helped design, fund, and build this train deserve all of
our thanks. The Green Line will make it easier and less expensive for
people to travel between the Twin Cities, and will help commuter
students get to and from the University of Minnesota. The Central
Corridor train will also help Minnesota meet its goals of reducing
pollution and investing in more sustainable forms of transportation-
making the new line truly green.
When Minnesotans come together, we transcend partisanship, and
accomplish projects that improve the lives of Minnesotans. Last month
our national and local leadership officially opened the Target Field
Metro Station, which the Central Corridor will service. Just a few
weeks ago Minnesotan lawmakers from both sides of the aisle joined
together to help stop the spread of invasive carp into Northern
Minnesota.
How is the new Central Corridor going to help you? Give my office a
call at (202) 225-4755 or leave a message on our website at
www.ellison.house.gov
and let us know how the Green Line is going to make your life
easier.
As always, you can stay up to date and give your feedback on the work
we are doing on behalf of the 5th District by following me on Twitter

The
