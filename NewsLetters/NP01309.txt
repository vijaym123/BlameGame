ISSUES
LEGISLATION
April 19, 2015
Dear David,
This past week the House passed
a number of measures to bring relief to taxpayers and accountability
to the IRS. On Wednesday, the House unanimously
passed a package of bills , including the
Taxpayer Bill of Rights Act of 2015 , intended
to hold the IRS accountable to respect taxpayers' right to privacy,
right to confidentiality, and right to a fair and just tax system. In
2013, the IRS paid an
estimated $5.8
billion in fraudulent refunds , admittedly leaked confidential tax
information, and targeted tax exempt organizations based on the
political agenda of IRS leadership. This is intolerable and I am pleased to
support these reforms to address this serious abuse.
On
Thursday the House passed the Death Tax Repeal Act of 2015 ( H.R. 110 5 ). At a tax rate of up to 40%, the death tax hits hardest those
families that run small businesses or operate farms. Families that have
spent a lifetime working hard
and paying taxes
to build a successful
business have to break up the business or parcel off the family farm
to satisfy the IRS and pay the tax liability.
Since its inception in 1916, the death tax has cost the U.S.
an estimated
$1.1 trillion in lost
economic activity .
This tax harms our families, our
farms, and our economy.
Below are some recent highlights from
Washington and California. To learn about how I can serve you and to

Sincerely,
Rep. LaMalfa escorts Brian McInerney, CEO of the Jimmy
Doolittle Center for Education Foundation to the Congressional Gold Medal
Ceremony in honor of the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders, 80 volunteers who
successfully completed their mission to fly 16 B-25 bombers off the deck of
the USS Hornet in the first U.S. air raid strike on enemy forces in
the Pacific on April 18 th ,
1942.
Rep. LaMalfa speaks
at the official dedication of the upgraded the Doe Mill Road bridge
over Butte Creek. Built in 1935, the bridge now meets federal highway
standards and provides opportunities for recreation, timber, and power
production.
Rep. LaMalfa hosts a
Congressional Fire Forum to meet with Siskiyou County residents and discuss the
Happy Camp fires of 2014, which burned over 134,000 acres. Citizens
weighed in on how to improve forest management to prevent fires from
growing to this size, improve forest health, and help our rural
economies thrive.
