A
Bipartisan Effort to Protect Private
Property Rights
Dear Friend,
The conversations I have with
constituents throughout the Fifth District
are undoubtedly my best resources as I
serve you in Washington. One great example
of this involves several engaged citizens
from Bedford, Franklin, and Pittsylvania
counties who live and work at Smith
Mountain Lake who shared with me their
concerns about how regulations at
hydro-power projects, like Smith Mountain
Lake, were causing unnecessary costs to
residents and diminished property values in
surrounding areas of the projects.
After these conversations,
I
introduced the bipartisan Supporting Home
Owners Rights Enforcement (SHORE) Act
with Congressman G.K. Butterfield (D-NC) in
direct response to the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commissions (FERC)
current disregard of private landownership
rights, a core foundation of our
Constitution, as it issues and enforces
licenses for hydro-power projects in the
Fifth District and across the country. The
lack of property rights protections has led
to increased costs and complications for
landowners when attempting to build docks
or other structures on their land and also
impacts property values.
The SHORE Act addresses this problem by
requiring that FERC take into consideration
the private property ownership rights when
exercising its authority to license the use
of Smith Mountain Lake and other federally
regulated hydro-power projects. By amending
the Federal Power Act, it will also require
licensees to consider the benefit of
private landownership to investment and
increased tourism when developing
recreation resources within a project
boundary. Ultimately, the SHORE Act will
help protect the private property ownership
rights of Fifth District individuals,
families, and small businesses.
Excessive federal overreach has become
all too common. Rapidly expanding federal
government regulations, like this example,
are contributing to our stagnant economic
recovery. This is exactly the kind of
unnecessary bureaucratic red tape that
prevents small businesses from growing and
hiring new employees. The SHORE Act is just
one small step toward the goal of removing
the government as a barrier to economic
recovery and job creation, but it will help
protect the private property ownership
rights of small businesses, allowing them
to expand their businesses at a time when
far too many in the Fifth District are out
of work.
I thank the citizens from Smith Mountain
Lake, Bedford, Franklin, and Pittsylvania
counties who brought their concerns to my
attention. It is input like this that
allows me to best represent the
constituents of Virginias Fifth
District. I look forward to working with
the SHORE Acts cosponsor,
Congressman G.K. Butterfield, and my
colleagues in the House and the Senate to
address this issue and ensure that private
property ownership rights are
protected.

Monticello and visited with Shoeab Ammar
and his wife Hadija Nassar of
Barboursville, who both recently became
naturalized citizens.

presented Mr. Carrol Deitz with a flag that
had been flown over the U.S. Capitol along
