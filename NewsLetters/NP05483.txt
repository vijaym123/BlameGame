Friend --
You continue to be amazing.
Our must-hit goal for last night&rsquo;s final FEC deadline? With your support, we made it.
That means we&rsquo;re in a STRONG position to win on November 4. I&rsquo;ll be honest: This election is going to be a nail-biter and will likely come down to the very last days.
But I truly believe that our motivated grassroots base, combined with an unprecedented, data-driven Get Out The Vote effort, will get us over the top.
Now -- have you watched Michelle Obama&rsquo;s video for Democratic supporters and taken her pledge to keep the Senate blue?
If you haven&rsquo;t, take a look:
Will you sign Michelle&rsquo;s pledge to Keep the Senate Blue? Add your name here. &gt;&gt;
The First Lady is reminding us what&rsquo;s on the line in this election: &ldquo;If you think folks who work 40 or 50 hours a week shouldn&rsquo;t live in poverty in the wealthiest nation on earth, if you don&rsquo;t think women&rsquo;s bosses should be making decisions about birth control, if you want to protect Medicare and Social Security for your kids and their kids, I need you to step up.&rdquo;
I&rsquo;m committing to step up for a Democratic Senate. Will you do the same by signing Michelle&rsquo;s pledge?
Add your name. &gt;&gt;
We only have 19 days left till Election Day. Time is short, but here at the DSCC and on campaigns around the country, the days will be long. So we wanted to be sure, before we start the final haul, to take the time to say:
Thank you. We really couldn&rsquo;t do this without you.
Now let&rsquo;s get out there and win.
