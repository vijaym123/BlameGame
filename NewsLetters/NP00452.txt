As thousands of Texans have endured devastating storms, we lift up all those who have suffered loss, particularly of loved ones. This wave of storms has swept through nearly every region, and while the damage is unimaginable, it has been inspiring to see citizens, churches, and communities join together to help those in need.
Last week, I toured affected areas in Houston, Wimberley, and San Marcos and met with Gov. Abbott and state and local officials to assess the damage and ensure that the recovery is as swift as possible. I will continue to work with the Texas delegation and support the Governor's request for assistance through FEMA, and I commend the Administration's prompt response to Governor Abbott's Major Disaster Declaration request on May 29. If you or your family suffered damage from the storm, please register with FEMA by calling 1-800-621-3362 or applying online at
disasterassistance.gov.
I want to thank the first responders and Texas Military Forces who have bravely risked their lives to prevent further damage and save lives, and I want to thank all the individuals who have taken initiative to start rebuilding their neighborhoods and restoring hope.
Please continue to be alert and take safety precautions, especially during this hurricane season. If you encounter high water while driving, remember, "Turn around, Don't Drown." My team and I will keep working with local officials throughout the state, and if you need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact my office or utilize the federal and state resources listed below:
