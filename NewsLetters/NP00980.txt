Dear Friend,
I wanted to send a quick note out today to wish all the moms out there
a Happy Mothers Day.
Across our state there are exceptional women
mothers, wives, daughters, aunts and friends
who are central to our
families and communities.
In recognition of just how fundamentally
important as these women are, I wanted to take a moment to update you
about important work in Congress that will benefit the women in our
lives.
Trends show that across our state and country, families increasingly
rely on more than one income and many mothers are a part of todays
workforce.
Unfortunately, as a country we still see that women are
paid, on average, 77 cents for every dollar a man earns for the same
work.
I believe all workers deserve fair compensation for their work
product and I support making certain that women are not subject to this
kind of discrimination.
That is why I have once again cosponsored the
Paycheck Fairness Act, which ensures that women are paid the same
amount as their male counterparts for the same work.
This is an
important bill that will promote economic opportunities and security
for women and their families.
Whether youre gathering with family today, resting, or thinking about
great memories of your mom, I hope you all have a Happy Mothers Day!
Please keep those moms who are serving our country overseas in your
thoughts and prayers.
Days like today are especially difficult for
them and their families, and we wish them all a safe return home.
Your friend,
Andr

Dear

I
wanted
to
send
a

out
today
to
wish
all

out

a
