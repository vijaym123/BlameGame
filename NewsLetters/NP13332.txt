Connecting With Mainers
Early last month I spent a few days visiting with community leaders and
business owners in Washington County to learn about what they are
doing, the challenges they face, and what can be done to help promote
economic growth in the area. Read my impressions from the trip here.
I learned how employees at Whitney Wreaths hand-selected the right
balsam trimmings to assemble each wreath.
Wendell Bradford, A.C. Inc.'s quality control officer showed me the
cold water storage of live lobsters in the town of Beals.
At the Passamaquoddy Tribal Council Chambers Office in Indian Township
I met with Chief Joseph Socobasin, Vice Chief Clayton Sockabasin and
Eddie Dugay to talk about economic development projects the tribe is
working on.
I met with Nat Lindquist, Ellen Rossi, and Tom Gardner of Wyman's of
Maine at their Cherryfield production facility which processes 400,000
pounds of wild blueberries each day.
I joined members of the Eastport Port Authority to discuss
infrastructure, the planned upgrades to the Eastport Breakwater
terminal, and the importance of the port to our state.
Last month, I was also thrilled to attend the 14th Annual FIRST LEGO
League Championship where over 70 teams spent the day showingcasing the
abilities of their robots. It was a very cool event and fun to watch!
