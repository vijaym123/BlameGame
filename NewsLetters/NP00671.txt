This week the House continued its efforts to advance solutions to build a healthy economy and empower all Americans to seek new opportunities and achieve a better life.
The week started with several bills designed to better serve our Nations veterans by strengthening existing programs and removing roadblocks veterans face every day.
By strong bipartisan majorities, the House passed H.R.s 474, 1038, 1313, 1382, 91 and
1816 to: extend homeless veteran reintegration programs; strengthen disciplinary procedures against Veterans Affairs (VA) employees; assist surviving spouses of service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses; encourage the hiring of veterans; enable veterans to obtain an ID card at no cost to taxpayers; and make it easier for veterans to receive housing assistance.
These bills follow the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, which President Obama signed into law earlier this year, which helps reduce military and veteran suicides and improve access to quality mental health care. In addition, legislation was signed into law last session to: overhaul the VA; give veterans access to more responsive care, including private care; and make it easier to hold more accountable senior VA managers who are failing our veterans.
We have much more work to do. More than a year after the biggest scandal in VA history, in which 110 VA facilities maintained secret lists to hide wait times, the department has apparently fired only one employee. Congress owes it to those who serve honorably to continue pushing for much-needed reforms and Ill continue that fight.
Innovation is essential to our economic prosperity in the competitive world economy and the House passed several bills to strengthen our support for basic research.
H.R. 1806, the America COMPETES Act, reforms how we fund civilian research programs while emphasizing basic research in the core physical sciences, biology, engineering, and computer science. H.R. 880, the American Research and Competitiveness Act, makes the research and development tax credit permanent and ensures that innovation isnt being hobbled by red tape and uncertainty in the tax code. And H.R. 2262, the SPACE Act, encourages private sector investment in commercial space and creates a predictable regulatory environment for innovators.
The House also passed legislation (H.R. 2253) that funds surface transportation programs through July. This was a disappointing, but necessary, step to give Congress time to continue working on a long-term funding solution for our nations surface transportation programs. One of the core functions of the federal government is to ensure that America has the necessary transportation infrastructure to facilitate interstate commerce and strengthen America's competitive edge in the global economy. We can all see that our infrastructure desperately needs an upgrade and I'm actively working with my colleagues to find the long-term solutions to make our transportation system safer and more efficient, thereby growing our economy and spurring job creation.
The House also passed H.R. 2250, a Legislative Branch Appropriations bill that continues to hold the line on spending for the U.S. House of Representatives and puts us on track to save taxpayers $782 million
nearly a 14 percent reduction in House spending under the current majority. This bill continues the
pay freeze for Members of Congress
in place since 2010.
Finally, a week after I voted in opposition to the Patriot Act because it didn't stop the National Security Agencys (NSA) mass collection of Americans data, I introduced the NSA Transparency Act to require this and future Administrations to respond to unanswered questions about the domestic surveillance programs that have collected this myriad of communications data on American citizens.
One of my primary responsibilities is to ensure that the privacy and civil liberties of every American guaranteed in the Constitution remain protected. The NSA Transparency Act will help safeguard the proper balance between protecting our civil liberties while maintaining our national security.
Sincerely,
Scott Perry
