Fighting to Secure Our
Border
8/1/14
Today,
Congressman Doug Lamborn voted for two pieces of legislation designed
to address the humanitarian and national security crisis currently
taking place on our southern
border.
The crisis at our southern border, where Central
American children have come by the thousands, is the direct result of the
Obama administrations reckless actions to circumvent through executive
fiat. The President has created false hope, and endangered the lives
of thousands of children as they attempt to come to the United States.
To stop this border crisis, we must stop the Presidents plans to
provide amnesty.
The two critical border bills we voted on tonight
will help protect the border, provide humanitarian relief, expedite
the safe removal of unaccompanied children back to their home countries,
stop future illegal immigration, and prevent the President from
taking unlawful executive action to expand his deferred action for illegal
immigrants.
