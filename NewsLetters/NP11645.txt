On Tuesday,
President Obama submitted his fiscal year 2015 budget request to
Congress.
Unfortunately, it was more of the same.
In it, the President
called for more spending and more taxes, and he failed to demonstrate
the leadership for which the American people are looking and take
steps towards getting our fiscal house in order.
While we stand
ready and willing to work with the President and his administration to
achieve this goal, ultimately, Congress holds the power of the purse.
As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I look forward
to working with my colleagues to evaluate the Presidents budget
line-by-line and ensuring taxpayer dollars are spent
responsibly.
In
addition to a number of suspensions that passed this week, on Tuesday
afternoon, the House considered
H.R. 3370 , the
Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act.
H.R. 3370 makes
adjustments to the federal flood insurance program to prevent flood insurance
premiums from skyrocketing on Americans across the country.
The
bill passed by a vote of 306-91.
On Wednesday, the House passed
H.R. 4118 , the SIMPLE Fairness Act, by a vote of 250-160.
H.R. 4118 eliminates the penalty tax (the greater of $95 or 1% gross
income) for failing to comply with Obamacares individual health
insurance mandate for 2014.
The administration announced that 4 million
people have enrolled over the exchanges.
With only a month left
until the end of open season, the administration is far short of its
projected 7 million enrollees and plans to tax the millions of
Americans who were not able to enroll in health insurance this year.
I
was proud to support H.R. 4118 and give hardworking taxpayers relief
from this overbearing Obamacare mandate for an additional
year.
Yesterday, the House passed
H.R. 3826 , the Electricity
Security and Affordability Act, by a vote of 229-183.
H.R. 3826
provides guidance to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on its
pending greenhouse gas emission standards for fossil fuel-fired power
plants to ensure that such standards are actually achievable by
commercial power plants operating in the real
world.
Additionally, the House
passed
H.R. 2641 , the Responsibly And Professionally
Invigorating Development (RAPID) Act, by a vote of 229-179.
H.R.
2641 streamlines the federal permitting process for construction
projects by creating a framework to increase efficiency and enhance
coordination among agencies in the environmental review process.
The
bills reforms will cut through endless bureaucratic delays and allow
construction projects to move forward, accelerating job creation and
fostering economic growth.
The House also passed
H.R.
4152 , To provide for the costs of loan guarantees for Ukraine,
under suspension of the rules by a vote of 385-23.
H.R. 4152 makes
Ukraine eligible to receive U.S.-based loan guarantees from existing
fiscal year 2014 funds, generally assuring repayment of the countrys
sovereign borrowing.
The loan guarantee demonstrates strong U.S.
support for Ukraine and sends a positive message to financial markets
by reducing Ukraines risk of default.
Im glad to be back in the Third
District of Arkansas today, but next week its back to Washington where
in addition to suspensions
the House will consider legislation
directed at the Imperial Presidency, with the goal of reigning in
overreach by the executive branch and ensuring that the President
faithfully executes the laws, including the Faithful Execution of the Law Act
(H.R. 3973), the ENFORCE the Law Act (H.R. 4138), and the Water Rights
Protection Act (H.R. 3189).
The House will also consider H.R.
4015, the SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of
2014.
