I know you&rsquo;ve been getting a lot of emails.
I know you&#39;re probably sick of them.
And yes, I know you&rsquo;re counting down the hours until Game 6 of the World Series.
But friend, I really need to talk to you.
Today, Karl Rove goes on the air with a $1.1 million smear campaign against me.
It&rsquo;s a last-minute attempt to buy this election for Doug Ose.
Look, we&rsquo;ve got to be ready.
I&rsquo;m incredibly grateful for your support so far. Our grassroots campaign has accomplished things I never thought possible.
But with so much at stake, I&rsquo;m asking you to dig deep one more time.
