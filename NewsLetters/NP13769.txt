News from Congressman Scott Peters
December 6, 2013
Dear Friend,
I hope you were able to enjoy some downtime with family and friends
over the Thanksgiving holiday. We certainly have much to be thankful
for in San Diego. While I am looking forward to spending time at home
for Christmas, there is still a lot of work to do in Washington before
the end of the year.
Honoring my Commitment
During the irresponsible government shutdown in October, which I
wholeheartedly opposed, I promised to donate the pay that I earned over
those two weeks to charity. Over the past few weeks I have been
honoring that commitment at numerous organizations around the district.

Pushing Innovation in Healthcare
Recently, I introduced two pieces of legislation aimed at promoting the
use of innovative, wireless technologies in healthcare to both reduce
costs and provide better care. The 'Health Savings Through Technology
Act
' advocates for a comprehensive strategy
for how to integrate these technologies into federal health care
programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The second, the '21st Century Care
for Military and Veterans Act
,' would expand reimbursement
policies for telehealth services under TRICARE and the Veterans
Administration so that active-duty servicemembers, their dependents,
retirees, and veterans could access wireless health services, including
remote essential mental-health monitoring.
San Diego is ahead of the curve in the development of wireless health
technologies. In addition to lowering the costs in the long term, these
bills promote the innovation economy that is at the heart of San
Diego's economic future.
Staff Honored at Local Event
At the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce's annual awards dinner,
my District Chief of Staff, MaryAnne Pintar, and the entire staff were
honored with the "Gets Stuff Done" award for their tireless work across
the region. Watch video of the event by clicking below:
