Congressman McHenry Weekly Update
Passing A Balanced Budget
Since Republicans took control of the House in 2011, we have committed ourselves to bringing much-needed fiscal discipline to the federal budget. Those efforts continued this week with
passage of the House's fiscal year 2016 budget . Our plan balances the budget in ten years, increases funding for our armed forces, and fully repeals Obamacare, all without raising taxes. It marks a stark contrast to President Obama's budget which is heavy on tax increases, runs up big deficits, and never balances.
With the Senate quickly following suit and passing their budget plan Thursday, our focus now turns to reconciling the two plans and sending an Obamacare repeal to President Obama's desk via the budget reconciliation process. You can learn more about the House Republican budget

Support for Gun Bill Continues to Grow
Over the last weeks the support for
H.R. 1365 the Ammunition and Firearms Protection Act
has continued to grow. The bill, which I introduced to block the ATF from pursuing ammunition bans in the future, now has over 40 cosponsors in the House. This week, I authored an op-ed for
IJ Review
highlighting five statistics that illustrate the importance of passing H.R. 1365. You can read the full op-ed
here . Recently, I spoke with
The Hill
about why I introduced H.R. 1365 and its prospects for House passage. You can see full video of that interview by clicking the image below.
Proud to Support - Strengthening Medicare for Seniors
After passing a budget Wednesday, the House turned its attention to another important reform which puts our nation on a more sustainable path by passing
H.R. 2 , a permanent fix to Medicare's physician payment system. This reform, which
passed with wide bipartisan support , will strengthen Medicare, provide greater stability to our nation's seniors, and save taxpayers money. It also marks the first real entitlement reform Congress has passed in nearly two decades. Learn more about H.R. 2

of this vital reform. Click

What I Have Been Reading
Obamacare Five Years Later: Thriving Or On Political Life Support
National Public Radio
Monday marked the fifth anniversary of President Obama signing the Affordable Care Act into law. Since its enactment Obamacare has driven up healthcare costs for Western North Carolina families and forced them to lose the doctors and plans they liked. I remain committed to fully repealing and replacing this disastrous law and reaffirmed that commitment in
my statement marking the fifth anniversary .
