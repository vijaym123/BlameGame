"I've Been Everywhere, Man"
Dear Friend,
By the time last week ended in Pine City with a ribbon cutting at the
new Pine Innovation Center, I was actually humming that great old
Johnny Cash tune, "I've Been Everywhere."
>From Brainerd to Bigfork, International Falls, Rainer, Tower, Effie,
Pine City, and everywhere in-between, we traveled hundreds of miles
through the Eighth District. We met with loggers, mayors, county
commissioners, MnDOT planners, nurses, truck drivers, airport
officials, educators, Make it in America business people, students,
workers, and families. And for good measure, we drove through a good
old-fashioned April snowstorm.
While my work in Washington is vital and important, the time I spend
with the good folks I am so proud to represent is the best part of my
job. I listen. I learn. And I remind everyone in the Eighth District
that my office is their office.
Whether it's helping secure an Economic Development Administration
grant like the one we announced on Wednesday
in International Falls, assisting a
vet with benefits, or hearing advice from a small business owner on
ways we can improve the tax code to help create jobs, my staff and I
are here to help fix problems, get things done, and improve the quality
of life for the people we serve.
With that in mind, I hope you will take a minute to watch this TV clip
about my trip in a logging truck from Grand Rapids to Big Fork over
Highway 38. That highway needs fixing, and we're on it:
Northland News: Nolan talks timber in Bigfork
And If you've got a problem, a suggestion or an idea, I want to hear
it. Just contact me here
.
Have a great week. And I hope to see you on the road.
Sincerely,
_____
Our Week in Pictures
I rode in a logging rig along Highway 38 from Grand Rapids to Bigfork
last week. My driver was retired logging driver Tom Moors, a Vietnam
vet and Commander of the Bigfork VFW. In addition to surveying the
highway's state of disrepair (up for reconstruction in 2017), we had a
great discussion on what Congress can do to eliminate the backlog at
the VA and provide our vets with the benefits they so rightfully
deserve. Greeting me at my destination were members of the Highway 38
Leadership Board as well as officials from the Minnesota Department of
Transportation (MnDOT) to discuss with me how we can make this road
safe for the loggers, tourists, local residents, and all the drivers
who frequently use this route.
Stopped to speak at Itasca County's Annual Township Association
meeting, where I thanked them for all the work they do maintaining
local roads and services. Local governments are so important for the
health and economic success of rural communities.
Proud to be in I-Falls to announce a $200,000 Economic Development
Administration grant to get residents back up and working after the
devastating job losses following the restructuring of the Boise mill
last year. Here I am meeting with Koochiching County and municipal
officials, labor, and community business leaders to discuss local
economic recovery efforts. Watch WDIO's coverage of the grant here
.
>From left to right: retired logger and veteran (and my logging rig
driver) Tom Moors, Itasca County Veteran Service Officer Hugh Quinn,
and Itasca County Commissioner Terry Snyder. We stopped at the Itasca
County Veteran's Services office before heading on the logging rig
ride. For many rural vets, access to adequate, routine health care is a
major challenge; I'm working on a bill in Congress that would enable
veterans living in rural communities to choose their own local doctors
and health providers, rather than having to drive hundreds of miles to
the nearest Veterans Affairs clinic.
Enjoyed a quick meal with some local loggers and businessmen at Effie
Caf in Effie, where we chatted about fixing up Highway 38 and what we
can do to ensure our logging and timber industry continues to provide
good-paying jobs for Minnesotans.
Visited with the dedicated staff of award-winning Bigfork Hospital,
recently recognized as one of the Top 10 Critical Access Hospitals in
America. A major challenge in our rural communities is access to health
care - and ensuring hospitals like Bigfork maintain their high quality,
24-hour emergency care is a top priority of mine in Congress. I'm
working hard to protect funding for critical access hospitals like this
one throughout the Northland.
With Robert Thompson, President of MINPACK, which since 1968 has
provided manufacturing, packaging, assembly, and printing solutions for
companies far and wide.
In Pine City I met with local Coldwell Banker realtor Mary Kay
Brautigan, Jane Trigas, and Karen Anderson of Pine City. Jane is
actually the former owner of the building we're standing in, and Karen
is the owner of Anderson Electric, which helped the new owners renovate
the space into Scotty's Parkside Caf.

Coming Up in Minnesota
I'm looking forward to another week of traveling through Minnesota's
8th, meeting with constituents and discussing with them the issues that
they care about, and then seeing what I can do about it. Here's a
sampling of where I'll be and what I'll be doing over the next few days:
.
Attending a conference on elder abuse presented by the
Minnesota Chippewa Tribe and Minnesota Indian Area Agency on Aging.
.
Visiting Next Innovations, LTD, a wholesale manufacturer in
Walker of true Made in America home dcor, lawn, and garden products.
.
Delivering packages and riding along with the good union
employees of Duluth's UPS facility. I was a proud member of Teamsters
Local 638 while working through college as a UPS employee myself.
.
Also in Duluth, meeting with the dedicated men and women of
the International Association of Firefighters (IAFF Local 101) at the
Lake Superior College Fire Training Center.

Finally...
Cutting the Ribbon for Pine Tech Innovation
Cutting the ribbon at the official opening of the Pine Innovation
Center, Pine Tech College's new business incubator.
I was delighted to have been at Pine Tech Community College last Friday
to commemorate the opening of their brand new Pine Innovation Center.
This new business incubator will house and support high-tech and light
manufacturing entrepreneurs, fostering innovation at the college and
throughout the region. This new center integrates the college into the
wider community, creating a pipeline to jobs in today's most
cutting-edge industries. New companies will stay in the incubator for
3-4 years before heading out to grow their business and hire the men
and women of Minnesota's 8th.
I was lucky to have attended the groundbreaking ceremony for this
exciting new center as well -
as a member of the Congressional STEM
caucus, which seeks to promote education and jobs in science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics, I'm so proud to do what I can
to prepare younger generations for the challenges and jobs of the
future.

Report
from
Representative
Rick
Nolan
"I've
Been
Everywhere,
Man"
Dear
Friend,
By
the
time
last
week
ended
in
Pine
City
with
a
ribbon
cutting
at
the
new
Pine
Innovation
Center,
I
was
actually
humming
that
great
old
Johnny
Cash
tune,
"I&#8217;ve
Been
Everywhere."
From
Brainerd
to
Bigfork,
International
Falls,
Rainer,
Tower,
Effie,
Pine
City ,
and
everywhere
in-between,
we
traveled
hundreds
of
miles
through
the
Eighth
District.
We
met
with
loggers,
mayors,
county
commissioners,
MnDOT
planners,
nurses,
truck
drivers,
airport
officials,
educators,
Make
it
in
America
business
people,
students,
workers,
and
families.
And
for
good
measure,
we
drove
through
a
good
old-fashioned
April
snowstorm.
While
my
work
in
Washington
is
vital
and
important,
the
time
I
spend
with
the
good
folks
I
am
so
proud
to
represent
is
the
best
part
of
my
job.
I
listen.
I
learn.
And
I
remind
everyone
in
the
Eighth
District
that
my
office
is
their
office .
Whether
it&#8217;s
helping
secure
an
Economic
Development
Administration
grant
like
the
one
we
announced
on
Wednesday
in
International
Falls,
assisting
a
vet
with
benefits,
or
hearing
advice
from
a
small
business
owner
on
ways
we
can
improve
the
tax
code
to
help
create
jobs ,
my
staff
and
I
are
here
to
help
fix
problems,
get
things
done,
and
improve
the
quality
of
life
for
the
people
we
serve.
With
that
in
mind,
I
hope
you
will
take
a
minute
to
watch
this
TV
clip
about
my trip
in
a
logging
truck from
Grand
Rapids
to
Big
Fork
over
Highway
38 .
That
highway
needs
fixing,
and
we&#8217;re
on
it:
Northland
News:
Nolan
talks
timber
in
Bigfork
And
If
you&#8217;ve
got
a
problem,
a
suggestion
or
an
idea,
I
want
to
hear
it.
Just
contact
me
here .
Have
a
great
week.
And
I
hope
to
see
you
on
the
road.
Sincerely,
Our
Week
in
Pictures
I
rode
in
a
logging
rig
along
Highway
38
from
Grand

to
Bigfork
last

can
do
to
eliminate
the
backlog
at
the
VA
and
provide
our
vets
with
the
benefits
they
so
rightfully
deserve.
Greeting
me
at
my
destination
were
members
of
the
Highway
38
Leadership
Board
as
well
as
officials
from
the
Minnesota
Department
of
Transportation
(MnDOT)
to
discuss
with
me
how
we
can make
this
road
safe
for
the
loggers,
tourists, local
residents,
and
all
the drivers
who
frequently
use
this
route.
Stopped
to
speak
at
Itasca
County's
Annual
Township Association
meeting,
where
I
thanked
them
for
all
the
work
they
do
maintaining

up
and

after
the
devastating job
losses following the
restructuring
of
the

last

Here
I
am
meeting
with
Koochiching County
and

officials, labor,
and
community
business
leaders
to
discuss
local
economic
recovery
efforts.
Watch

Officer
Hugh
Quinn,
and

County
Commissioner
Terry
Snyder.
We
stopped
at
the
Itasca
County
Veteran's
Services
office
before
heading
on
the
logging
rig
ride.
For
many
rural
vets,
access
to
adequate,
routine
health
care
is
a
major
challenge;
I'm
working
on
a
bill
in
Congress
that
would
enable
veterans
living
in
rural
communities
to
choose
their
own
local doctors
and
health
providers,
rather
than
having
to
drive
hundreds
of
miles
to
the
nearest
Veterans
Affairs
clinic.
Enjoyed
a
quick
meal
with
some
local
loggers
and
businessmen
at
Effie
Caf&#233;
in
Effie,
where
we
chatted
about
fixing
up
Highway
38
and
what
we
can
do
to
ensure
our
logging
and
timber
industry continues
to
provide
good-paying
jobs
for
Minnesotans.
Visited
with
the
dedicated
staff
of
award-winning
Bigfork
Hospital ,
recently
recognized
as
one
of
the
Top
10
Critical
Access
Hospitals
in
America .
A
major
challenge
in
our
rural
communities
is
access
to
health
care
-
and
ensuring
hospitals
like
Bigfork
maintain
their
high
quality,
24-hour
emergency
care
is
a
top
priority
of
mine
in
Congress.
I'm
working
hard
to
protect
funding
for
critical
access
hospitals
like
this
one
throughout
the
Northland.
With
Robert
Thompson,
President
of
MINPACK ,
which
since
1968
has
provided
manufacturing,
packaging,
assembly,
and
printing
solutions
for
companies
far
and
wide.
In
Pine
City
I
met
with
local
Coldwell
Banker realtor
Mary
Kay
Brautigan,
Jane
Trigas,
and
Karen
Anderson
of
Pine
City.
Jane
is
actually
the
former
owner
of
the
building
we're
standing
in,
and
Karen
is
the
owner
of
Anderson
Electric,
which
helped
the
new
owners
renovate
the
space
into
Scotty's
Parkside
Caf&#233;.
Coming
Up
in
Minnesota
I'm
looking
forward
to
another
week
of
traveling
through
Minnesota's
8th,
meeting with
constituents
and discussing
with
them
the
issues
that
they
care
about,
and
then
seeing
what
I
can
do
about
it. Here's
a
sampling
of
where
I'll
be
and
what I'll
be
doing over
the
next
few
days:
&#8226;
Attending
a
conference
on
elder
abuse
presented
by
the
Minnesota
Chippewa
Tribe
and
Minnesota
Indian
Area
Agency
on
Aging .
&#8226;
Visiting
Next
Innovations,
LTD,
a
wholesale
manufacturer
in
Walker of
true
Made in
America
home
d&#233;cor,
lawn,
and
garden
products.
&#8226;
Delivering
packages
and
riding
along with
the
good
union
employees
of
Duluth's
UPS
facility.
I
was
a
proud
member
of
Teamsters
Local
638
while
working
through
college
as
a
UPS
employee
myself.
&#8226;
Also
in
Duluth,
meeting
with
the
dedicated men
and
women
of
the
International
Association
of
Firefighters
(IAFF
Local
101) at
the
Lake
Superior
College
Fire
Training
Center.
Finally...
Cutting
the

Pine
Tech
Innovation
Cutting
the
ribbon
at
the
official
opening
of
the
Pine
Innovation
Center,
Pine
Tech
College's
new
business
incubator.
I
was
delighted
to
have been
at
Pine
Tech
Community
College
last
Friday to
commemorate
the
opening
of
their
brand new
Pine
Innovation
Center.
This

business
incubator
will
house
and
support
high-tech
and
light
manufacturing
entrepreneurs,
fostering
innovation
at
the
college
and
throughout
the
region.
This
new
center
integrates
the
college
into
the

creating
a

New

3-4
years
before
heading
out
to
grow
their

and
hire
the
men
and
women
of
Minnesota's

I
was
lucky to

attended
the

for
this
exciting
