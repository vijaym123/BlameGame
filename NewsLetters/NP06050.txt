We&rsquo;re nearly out of time -- so we won't waste any:
A just released poll from Rasmussen Reports shows the race for Congress is TIED, 4O%-4O%. And now Boehner has launched the largest TV ad buy of the election to try and break the tie. If we let Boehner succeed -- then all hope will be lost for us to win a Democratic House for President Obama&rsquo;s last years in office.
To be blunt about it: we&rsquo;re 5 days from the most critical deadline of the entire election. If we fall behind now, we can just throw in the towel. Go home. Give up.
We just ran the numbers: it&rsquo;ll take another 3728 donations tonight to be able to compete.
David -- if you&rsquo;re planning to chip in soon, we could really use your support right now.
