Friend -- Everyone under the sun is emailing you.
That&rsquo;s because tonight&rsquo;s FEC deadline
couldn&rsquo;t
be more important.
The Koch brothers have announced they&rsquo;re firing up their right-wing money machine -- and now Democrats need to respond, or we risk letting extremist GOP candidates gain an insurmountable lead!
In other words:
We&rsquo;re in danger of having this election ripped away.
We CAN fight back with your help, but your DSCC membership expired last month! This is your LAST CHANCE to renew your membership. The FEC deadline strikes at midnight!
Friend, you have 9 hours left. Will you renew your membership and put us back on the path to WINNING? Your gift will be matched!

The GOP&rsquo;s first few weeks controlling Congress have been, no exaggeration, catastrophic. They went after Social Security, Obamacare, and abortion rights with barely a pause in between! If they win the White House AND Congress in 2016, it would be beyond devastating for everything we care about.
That&rsquo;s why we absolutely, positively, critically need you to act TODAY!! The fierce, committed Democratic base is the only hope we have.
Will you renew your membership before the LAST-CHANCE DEADLINE in 9 hours? Your gift will be matched and we&rsquo;ll use every penny to beat the GOP!
