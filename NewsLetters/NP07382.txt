Calling All
Interns!
My office is currently seeking highly
motivated college students to serve as interns in my Washington, D.C. office,
as well as my district offices in Rogers, Fort Smith, and Harrison,
for the following session:
Fall 2014: August
December
A Congressional internship is a
rewarding experience, and both Washington, D.C. and district office
interns will work closely with my staff and constituents while learning the
inner workings of the United States Congress and about issues
affecting Arkansans.
I encourage those interested in political science,
government, public policy, business, and social work to
apply.
Internship
requirements and application materials are available on my website . For
more information, please call (202)
225-4301.
Week in
Review
Id like to
thank all of the Arkansans who visited my office while in Washington this
week, including the Starr family of Bentonville, Carolyn Crook from
Pack Rat Outdoor Center in Fayetteville, the Marshall family of
Springdale, Ken Wade, Executive Director of the Arkansas Coalition Against
Domestic Violence, the Osmola family of Rogers, the International Civil
and Human Rights Advocates from Rogers and Bentonville, and the
Steffens family from Eureka Springs.
I hope you enjoy the rest of your
visits to our nations capital!
In addition to suspensions considered on Monday and
Tuesday, the House passed
H.R. 4315 , the Endangered
Species Transparency and Reasonableness Act.
H.R. 4315 and the three
reform bills it includes, simply works to enhance species recovery,
while forcing the federal government to apply the best science to their
listings and cap attorneys fees in Endangered Species Act lawsuits.
Increased transparency and accountability means more input from
states, localities, and tribes and more taxpayer dollars spent on species
recovery instead of bureaucratic red tape. The protection of endangered
species is critical
but so is ensuring that current law is actually
working and actually recovering species. Unfortunately, the ESA is
not.
On Wednesday, I was honored with the National
Retail Federation's Hero of Main Street award for my support of small
business and the U.S. retail industry.
Thank you to Pack Rat Outdoor
Center's Carolyn Crook for presenting me with this
award!
Also on Wednesday, the House passed the
conference report to accompany
H.R. 3230 , the
Veterans Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency
Act of 2014.
The bill addresses the
severe mismanagement
and lack of accountability across the Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA).
We owe the greatest amount of respect and gratitude to our
veterans for their selfless service to our nation
this starts with
ensuring they can access the timely and quality care they have
earned.
I commend Chairman Miller for his dedication to this and to the
passage of this bill, which gets the ball rolling.
I will continue
to work with my colleagues to address the systemic issues at the VA
and change its culture to fulfill our promise to our
veterans.
On Thursday, Senator Pryor, Senator
Boozman, Congressman Griffin, and
I announced that five
Arkansas fire departments will receive nearly $700,000
from the
U.S. Department of Homeland Securitys Assistance to Firefighters Grant
Program (AFG) to purchase equipment, training materials, and vehicles,
including the Butterfield District 5 Volunteer Fire Department in Van
Buren, which will receive $132,052 for a manufacturer burn
simulator.
These grants are welcomed news for Arkansass brave firemen and
women.
They will provide essential training and equipment to
help ensure our firefighters safety as they put themselves into harms
way to protect ours.
Thursday afternoon, the House passed
H.R. 935 , the
Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2013.
This bill amends the
Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act (also known as the Clean Water Act or
CWA) to prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from
requiring a permit under the CWA for the discharge, into navigable waters,
of a pesticide authorized for sale, distribution, or use under
FIFRA.
Late this evening, the House
passed
H.R. 5230 , a bill which makes supplemental
appropriations to address the current immigration crisis on the
southernborder for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2014.
The bill
also boosts law enforcement activities, provides emergency care for
unaccompanied minors, and prevents their future arrival.
Additionally, the House passed
H.R. 5272 , a bill which
creates prohibitions for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals
(DACA) program, which was established through the executive order of
President Obama.
I applaud the passage of these important reforms to
our immigration system.
Its disappointing that these bills, which address the
50,000 unaccompanied minors that have come here illegally this year
alone and make critical immigration reforms, will join hundreds of others
waiting for consideration by the Senate, which is
again
unwilling
to take action and is already home for August recess.
The root
of this crisis is our open border.
It has been exacerbated by
President Obamas refusal to enforce Americas immigration laws.
Unfortunately, it will only get worse until we address the loopholes
that allow these unaccompanied minors to stay here and provide the
resources necessary to boost our borders security and quickly process,
adjudicate, and reunite these children with their families
in their
home countries where they belong.
I will continue to work with my
House colleagues to find and pass thoughtful, conservative solutions to
appropriately address this crisis and the many other challenges
facing our nation.
Tomorrow, Im heading to Monticello, Kentucky, to attend the Casing of the
Colors ceremony for and presentation of the Harry S. Truman Award to
Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers, at the chairman's invitation because
of our close relationship and my 30 years of service in the National
Guard.
The Harry S. Truman Award is the National Guard
Association of the United States' highest recognition for distinguished service
in support of national defense. The award will be presented at the
Battery C, 1st Battalion, 623d Field Artillery.
Find out
more about the honor on Chairman Rogers
website .
On Sunday, I head back to Arkansas to
begin the August district work period, which I will spend traveling
throughout the Third District.
Please be sure to watch
the calendar on my website
and
my Facebook
page
to see where Ill be and what events I am hosting, such as
Mondays Coffee with the Congressman in Rogers
or
Tuesdays Coffee with the Congressman in
Springdale .
I hope to see you!
