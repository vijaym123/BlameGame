Dear Friend,
I wish you a Happy Holidays and hope that you have a wonderful New Year!
This month's newsletter includes an update on a few of my top
legislative priorities, a listing of upcoming congressional internships
and educational grant opportunities, and tips to stay safe this holiday
season. Also included in this newsletter is information on Typhoon
Haiyan relief efforts and how you can become involved.
I would also like to announce the formation of the Imperial Valley
Congressional Youth Advisory Council. This exciting new Council will
provide youth in the Imperial Valley an opportunity to share their
perspectives on federal issues. I encourage students in Imperial
County, ages 14 to 17, to apply to the program.
As the year comes to a close, I hope you enjoy your time with friends
and family. I look forward to continuing to work together in the coming
year!

Fasting for Immigration Reform
Rep. Joe Kennedy III (MA-4) passes the Immigration Reform Fast to Rep.
Juan Vargas.
On December 4th, Rep. Kennedy of Massachusetts passed his fast in
support of much-needed comprehensive immigration reform to Rep. Vargas.
"I am honored to be continuing the fast started by my good friend Rep.
Joe Kennedy," said Rep. Vargas. "While we have chosen to fast,
undocumented immigrants are forced to endure the gnawing sense of dread
that they could be ripped away from their families at any moment. I
hope that this fast helps open the hearts and minds of my colleagues
across the aisle."
Rep. Kennedy took on the fast from Eliseo Medina, International
Secretary-Treasurer of the Service Employees International Union, who
had been fasting with a group of advocates for 22 days as part of Fast
4 Families: A Call for Immigration Reform and Citizenship.
"I am honored today to pass this fast on to my friend Congressman Juan
Vargas, who has been a tireless leader for comprehensive immigration
reform," said Congressman Kennedy. "For 22 days, Eliseo Medina and his
fellow advocates have refused to let their government ignore the need
for real reform. We are humbled to stand with them and to build on the
momentum of this fast with so many of our colleagues."
On December 5th, Rep. Vargas passed his fast to Rep. Joe Garcia
(FL-26). For more information, please visit:

Imperial Valley Congressional Youth Advisory Council
The Imperial Valley Congressional Youth Advisory Council (IVCYAC) aims
to provide an organized youth perspective regarding federal issues to
the Office of Congressman Juan Vargas. The IVCYAC will be responsible
for helping to shape legislation, change policies that impact youth,
and develop more youth and adult partnerships.
The vision of the IVCYAC is to provide youth with leadership
development opportunities and a platform to share their perspectives on
issues that are important to the community. The goal is for young
people to be recognized and included as an essential voice in the
decision-making process.
IVCYAC members will engage in positive change in their communities,
interact with numerous members of the district, and further develop
their public speaking, critical thinking and team building skills.
Their participation will also enable Congressman Vargas' office to
understand more clearly and respond more effectively to the needs and
aspirations of young people in the Imperial Valley.

On the Issue: Fighting Human Trafficking
Rep. Vargas hosted a briefing on "Human Trafficking and the Commercial
Sexual Exploitation of Children," which focused on the efforts being
made to combat the sexual exploitation of children throughout the
world. Earlier this year, Rep. Vargas introduced H.R. 1690, the Child
Protection Act of 2013, which would remove the knowledge of age
requirement in order to stop child sex traffickers from receiving
lighter sentences.
Rep. Vargas was joined by governmental and non-governmental groups,
along with a child sex trafficking survivor, who now trains law
enforcement and social workers on the tell-tale signs of trafficking.
The San Diego County District Attorney's Office provided a unique
perspective on the challenges of prosecuting those who engage in human
trafficking. Bilateral Safety Corridor Coalition, Survivors for
Solutions, and the Polinsky Children's Center offered attendees an
in-depth look at how their organizations fight the sexual exploitation
of women and children, offer peer-led services for survivors, and
provide a safe residence for children separated from their families,
respectively.
"I was honored to host this desperately-needed and incredibly
informative briefing on human trafficking and the commercial sexual
exploitation of children. Sexual slavery is a rapidly growing epidemic
and it is essential that we raise awareness of this horrific crime
against humanity," said Rep. Vargas. "This briefing is just one of the
steps we must take to combat child sex trafficking. We need to continue
to work together to ensure that none of our children are victimized."

Child and Youth Holiday Safety
With the holidays and colder weather approaching, it is important that
you stay safe. Fall and winter have more house fires than any other
season. Between 2005-2009, U.S. fire departments responded to an
average of 240 house fires that started with a Christmas tree. Remember
to keep trees away from candles, as well as any other heat source.
Be aware of gases such as carbon monoxide, which is odorless and kills
approximately 500 people in the United States every year. California
law requires owners to install and maintain carbon monoxide alarms in
their rental units. California's Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention
Act of 2010 recommends everyone install a carbon monoxide alarm in
their home.
The cold season also means the flu season, so be sure to wash your
hands often. Stay warm and dress appropriately, as cold temperatures
can cause serious health problems.
Travel with caution and be aware of traffic, as bad weather can affect
roads. Check with CalTrans for road conditions -www.dot.ca.gov.
December:
.Get a fire resistant tree; if you have a live tree, always keep it
well watered
.Keep your tree away from any heat sources
.Turn off all decorative lights before you go to bed; they could
short and cause a fire
.Make sure your candles are placed in sturdy metal, glass or ceramic
holders and placed where they cannot be a easily knocked down
.Don't burn wrapping paper in the fireplace, as it could cause a
flash fire

Internship Opportunity
I am always accepting applications for the internship program with my
office. College students interested in getting involved in the daily
operations of the federal government are encouraged to apply.
We are dedicated to working with interns to provide a "hands-on"
learning opportunity. Each intern is assigned to work with
congressional staff responsible for Rep. Vargas' legislative or
administrative operations. An intern's time is divided between
substantive projects and support work (data entry, copying, mailroom
duty and answering phones). There will be opportunities to be civically
engaged with the day to day operations of District Office staff,
community members and other decision makers.
Duties will vary based on an intern's skills, experience, and
interests, but they will normally include constituent correspondence,
casework, research, and assisting in legislative and office duties. A
concerted effort is made to ensure that students' educational and
professional goals are met.
Interns must commit to a minimum of ten hours per week for at least
three months. We cannot offer monetary compensation to our interns but
we will support students requesting credit through their college or
university.

Typhoon Haiyan/Yolanda Relief Efforts
On November 8th, Typhoon Haiyan-known as Yolanda in the Philippines-made
landfall in central Philippines, bringing strong winds and heavy rains
that resulted in flooding, landslides, and widespread damage. My
thoughts and prayers go out to the families and loved ones that
continue to be affected by this devastating natural disaster.
As of December 3rd, international donors have pledged nearly $404
million to address the needs of populations affected by Typhoon
Haiyan/Yolanda. The total amount pledged exceeds the $348 million
requested by the revised U.N. Haiyan Action Plan for the Phillipines
typhoon response. To date, the United States Government has provided
over $60 million in humanitarian assistance to the relief efforts.

&#8220;While

On
the
Issue:
Fighting
Human
Trafficking
Rep.
Vargas
hosted
a
briefing
on
&#8220;Human
Trafficking
and
the
Commercial
Sexual
Exploitation
of
Children,&#8221;
which
focused
on
the
efforts
being
made
to
combat
the
sexual
exploitation
of
children
throughout
the
world.
Earlier
this
year,
Rep.
Vargas
introduced
H.R.
1690,
the
Child
Protection
Act
of
2013,
which
would
remove
the
knowledge
of
age
requirement
in
order
to
stop
child
sex
traffickers
from
receiving
lighter
sentences.
Rep.
Vargas
was
joined
by
governmental
and
non-governmental
groups,
along
with
a
child
sex
trafficking
survivor,
who
now
trains
law
enforcement
and
social
workers
on
the
tell-tale
signs
of
trafficking.
The
San
Diego
County
District
Attorney&#8217;s
Office
provided
a
unique
perspective
on
the
challenges
of
prosecuting
those
who
engage
in
human
trafficking.
Bilateral
Safety
Corridor
Coalition,
Survivors
for
Solutions,
and
the
Polinsky
Children's
Center
offered
attendees
an
in-depth
look
at
how
their
organizations
fight
the
sexual
exploitation
of
women
and
children,
offer
peer-led
services
for
survivors,
and
provide
a
safe
residence
for
children
separated
from
their
families,
respectively.
&#8220;I
was
honored
to
host
this
desperately-needed
and
incredibly
informative
briefing
on
human
trafficking
and
the
commercial
sexual
exploitation
of
children.
Sexual
slavery
is
a
rapidly
growing
epidemic
and
it
is
essential
that
we
raise
awareness
of
this
horrific
crime
against
humanity,&#8221;
said
Rep.
Vargas.
&#8220;This
briefing
is
just
one
of
the
steps
we
must
take
to
combat
child
sex
trafficking.
We
need
to
continue
to
work
together
to
ensure
that
none
of
our
children
are
victimized.&#8221;
Child
and
Youth
Holiday
Safety
With
the
holidays
and
colder
weather
approaching,
it
is
important
that
you
stay
safe.
Fall
and
winter
have
more
house
fires
than
any
other
season.
Between
2005-2009,
U.S.
fire
departments
responded
to
an
average
of
240
house
fires
that
started
with
a
Christmas
tree.
Remember
to
keep
trees
away
from
candles,
as
well
as
any
other
heat
source.
Be
aware
of
gases
such
as
carbon
monoxide,
which
is
odorless
and
kills
approximately
500
people
in
the
United
States
every
year.
California
law
requires
owners
to
install
and
maintain
carbon
monoxide
alarms
in
their
rental
units.
California's
Carbon
Monoxide
Poisoning
Prevention
Act
of
2010
recommends
everyone
install
a
carbon
monoxide
alarm
in
their
home.
The
cold
season
also
means
the
flu
season,
so
be
sure
to
wash
your
hands
often.
Stay
warm
and
dress
appropriately,
as
cold
temperatures
can
cause
serious
health
problems.
Travel
with
caution
and
be
aware
of
traffic,
as
bad
weather
can
affect
roads.
Check
with
CalTrans
for
road
conditions
- www.dot.ca.gov .
December:
&#8226;Get
a
fire
resistant
tree;
if
you
have
a
live
tree,
always
keep
it
well
watered
&#8226;Keep
your
tree
away
from
any
heat
sources
&#8226;Turn
off
all
decorative
lights
before
you
go
to
bed;
they
could
short
and
cause
a
fire
&#8226;Make
sure
your
candles
are
placed
in
sturdy
metal,
glass
or
ceramic
holders
and
placed
where
they
cannot
be
a
easily
knocked
down
&#8226;Don't

The
United
States
Mint
and
the
National
Endowment
for
the
Arts
(NEA)
are
pleased
to
announce
a
call
for
artists
to
participate
in
the
Mint&#8217;s
Artistic
Infusion
Program
(AIP).
Established
in
2003,
the
AIP
serves
to
enrich
and
invigorate
the
nation&#8217;s
coins
and
medals
by
commissioning
designs
from
a
select
pool
of
outstanding
artists.
Interested
artists
are
invited
to
submit
applications
for
consideration.
The
Mint
has
partnered
with
the
NEA
to
manage
a
new
application
and
review
process
that
is
open
to
all
U.S.
citizens
who
are
established
in
the
fields
of
professional
art
or
illustration.
As
part
of
the
new
process,
the
NEA
will
convene
a
review
panel
to
examine
all
applications
and
recommend
artists
to
submit
demonstration
designs.
The
Mint
will
pay
$1,500
to
each
applicant
for
their
demonstration
design
of
a
current
coin
or
medal
program.
The
review
panel
will
make
recommendations
to
the
Mint
for
final
selections.
Application
guidelines
are
posted
on
the
NEA
website
with
an
initial
deadline
of
January
10,
2014.
Typhoon
Haiyan/ Yolanda
Relief
Efforts
On
November
8th,
Typhoon
Haiyan&#8212;known
as
Yolanda
in
the
Philippines&#8212;made
landfall
in
central
Philippines,
bringing
strong
winds
and
heavy
rains
that
resulted
in
flooding,
landslides,
and
widespread
damage.
My
thoughts
and
prayers
go
out
to
the
families
and
loved
ones
that
continue
to
be
affected
by
this
devastating
natural
disaster.
As
of
December
3rd,
international
donors
have
pledged
nearly
$404
million
to
address
the
needs
of
populations
affected
by
Typhoon
Haiyan/Yolanda.
The
total
amount
pledged
exceeds
the
$348
million
requested
by
the
revised
U.N.
Haiyan
Action
Plan
for
the
Phillipines
typhoon
response.
To
date,
the
United
States
Government
has
provided
over
$60
million
in
humanitarian
assistance
to
the
relief
efforts.
