Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Voices for National Service presented me with the Outstanding National Service Advocacy Award last week in Washington. I was honored and humbled to be nominated by Volunteer Florida and City Year Orlando to receive this prestigious recognition. I have been privileged to work with so many dedicated and talented individuals in my district and across Florida as I have represented Central Florida for the past three decades. Volunteers and members of the national service community meet critical needs in our community day after day, and I am honored to support their efforts. You can read the
Volunteer Florida press release here .

Last Monday, I was privileged to join Representative Larry Metz, local officials, the Patriot Guard Riders, family members, and Lake County residents as we participated in the Memorial Highway Designation Ceremony to honor Sgt. Jess Thomas, who gave his life in service to our country during the Vietnam War. The men and women who have served our country and paid the ultimate sacrifice deserve our highest praise and gratitude. It was an honor to be a part of this ceremony to recognize the life and sacrifice of Sgt. Jess Thomas.

As a graduate of Evans High School, it was a pleasure to participate in an appreciation breakfast for Coach Fred Pennington last week. I joined alumni who were coached by Fred Pennington and other graduates of Evans in raising over $200,000 for Orange County Public Schools, and it was a momentous occasion to celebrate the Coach Pennington Endowed Scholarship Fund that will benefit graduating basketball players and cheerleaders from low-income families who are planning to pursue educational advancement in a technical or vocational school, college, or university.

Habitat for Humanity held their annual fly-in last week, and it was a pleasure to meet with local representatives, including Kent Adcock, the CEO of Lake-Sumter Habitat for Humanity, and Carey Baker, the Lake County Property Appraiser. I also attended the national legislative reception in Washington, as Habitat works to both honor veterans and provide affordable housing to families in our communities.
Some of the other meetings that I had last week included:
-	Lucas Boyce, the Director of Business Development for the Orlando Magic
-	Winter Haven Commissioners J.P. Powell and Brad Dantzler, representing the Florida League of Cities
-	Rae Waddell, with Youth Services Director for Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission
-	John Hutcheson, from Frontline Missions International
-	Central Florida representatives from the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Last March, a constituent from Winter Garden had successfully enrolled in an unsubsidized private health insurance plan, but received numerous phone calls and letters requesting information confirming his citizenship.
Although he had provided the requested information, his healthcare account with the Department of Health and Human Services was frozen, and he continued to receive unresolved correspondence from the Marketplace. My office reached out to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) who verified the constituents information and were able to resolve the issue.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
ISIS must be destroyed. These terrorists are barbarians with no conscience and are a very real threat to America and her interests at home and abroad.
Last week, President Obama officially requested Congressional war authorization to fight ISIS.
While the Presidents engagement with Congress on this important issue has been sorely lacking, this step is welcome. Congress will now begin vetting this proposal to ensure that it does not limit the ability of our military commanders to effectively protect our homeland and destroy this evil group before it is allowed to fester further.
Do you believe that the President and Congress should give our military leaders the unconditional support and resources they need to eliminate this threat?
Yes
No
I don't know

Legislative Update:
Its time. For more than six years, the Keystone XL Pipeline has been subjected to extensive studies, environmental impact statements, bureaucratic delays, and legislative gridlock. Last Wednesday, I voted to support S. 1, the Keystone XL Pipeline Approval Act, which finally sends approval of the pipeline, along with the potential for thousands of American jobs and increased energy security that goes with it, to the President. The legislation, which has now passed both chambers of Congress with bipartisan support, is sitting on the Presidents desk, awaiting action.
Last week, I also voted to support H.R. 644, the America Gives More Act of 2015, and H.R. 638, Americas Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2015. H.R. 644 will encourage charitable giving by making permanent certain provisions of the tax code that encourage donations of food, set aside property for conservation and reduce taxes on income of charitable foundations. H.R. 638 provides permanent tax relief to small businesses by allowing them to deduct certain investments in their business and by reducing the timeframe in over which certain assets are taxed. By making these provisions permanent, entrepreneurs will have more certainty to invest in and grow their business.
