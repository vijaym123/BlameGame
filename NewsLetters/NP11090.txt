Dear Friends,
Congressman Collins listens to witness testimony at the field hearing
on rural access to broadband.
This month Capitol Hill came to Orleans County. I was pleased to chair
a House Small Business Subcommittee Field Hearing in Albion on access
to rural broadband service. The lack of broadband access is a critical
issue to many small businesses and farms in NY-27 and is unfortunately
limiting their opportunities for growth and expansion. Representatives
from Time Warner Cable, Frontier Communications and the Rural Broadband
Association testified about wireless spectrum, federal broadband
programs, Universal Service Fund reform, and other initiatives of the
Federal Communications Commission. The hearing also included testimony
from Kendra Lamb, of Lamb Farms, representing the New York State Farm
Bureau.
Following the field hearing, I hosted a roundtable discussion
with local elected and community leaders in order to continue the
conversation about the need for access to broadband and its direct
connection to economic development. Both events were a great
opportunity to hear from community members on this important issue and
I look forward to holding more field hearings in NY-27 in the future.
Congressman Collins listens to community members on the importance of
access to broadband.
Earlier this month, I joined Congressman Brian Higgins in calling on
the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to reverse its plan to
downgrade the Buffalo-Niagara International Airport's status as a hub
airport. Under the TSA's "hub and spoke realignment" plan, the Buffalo
airport would become a spoke and Albany would become the Upstate hub.
Although Albany may be our state capital, the simple fact is that
Buffalo is a bigger, busier airport. Given the passenger and flight
volume at the Buffalo-Niagara airport, its location as a border airport
requiring more complicated TSA work, and the federal law enforcement
resources already located in Buffalo, I believe removing the
Buffalo-Niagara Airport's hub status would be a mistake. Congressman
Higgins and I will continue to urge the TSA to rethink its decision and
allow Buffalo to remain the hub for Upstate New York.
Congressman Collins meets with families representing the WNY Chapter of
the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation to discuss the Gabrielle
Miller Kids First Research Act.
Additionally, this month I applauded the Senate's passage of the
Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act (H.R. 2019). This important
legislation, which I was proud to co-sponsor in the House of
Representatives, will eliminate federal funding for presidential
campaigns and party conventions and reallocate the funding to expand
pediatric research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Last
year, alongside several local families impacted by juvenile diabetes, I
pushed for this legislation, which will help the NIH make huge strides
in research and clinical trials aimed at curing and preventing juvenile
(type 1) diabetes, childhood cancers, autism, and Down Syndrome, to
name a few. The legislation is named for Gabriella Miller, a girl from
Virginia who fought to raise awareness for pediatric cancer research
and who died of brain cancer last year at the age of 10. The House
passed the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act on December 11,
2013 in a 294-103 vote and I'm glad the Senate realized the need to
reprioritize our nation's spending and put the health and well-being of
our children ahead of presidential politics.
I would also like to take a moment to honor the late Staff Sgt. William
F. Leonard of Lockport, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor
by the President on March 18th. The late Staff Sgt. Leonard was awarded
the Medal of Honor for his efforts during a battle near St. Die, France
on November 7, 1944 and his daughters accepted the award on his behalf.
Staff Sgt. Leonard is a true American hero and I ask that we all take a
moment to remember the sacrifices he made and his extraordinary service
to his country.
Clockwise from top: Congressman Collins meets with NY-27 students in
D.C. participating in the Up Close Washington Program, Jake Meyer
invited Congressman Collins to speak to his classmates at HFL Middle
School, Congressman Collins visits with students from Lyndonville High
School in D.C., and Congressman Collins meets with students from Albion
High School in D.C.
As always, thank you to everyone who continues to contact my office.
Your questions, input and feedback allow me to better represent you in
Washington.
Sincerely,
CHRIS COLLINS
Member of Congress
Vision: The United States of America will reclaim its past glory as the
Land of Opportunity, restoring the promise of the American Dream for
our children and grandchildren.

Dear
Friends,
Congressman
Collins
listens
to
witness
testimony
at
the
field
hearing
on
rural
access
to
broadband.
This
month
Capitol
Hill
came
to
Orleans
County.
I
was
pleased
to
chair
a
House
Small
Business
Subcommittee
Field
Hearing
in
Albion
on
access
to
rural
broadband
service.
The
lack
of
broadband
access
is
a
critical
issue
to
many
small
businesses
and
farms
in
NY-27
and
is
unfortunately
limiting
their
opportunities
for
growth
and
expansion.
Representatives
from
Time
Warner
Cable,
Frontier
Communications
and
the
Rural
Broadband
Association
testified
about
wireless
spectrum,
federal
broadband
programs,
Universal
Service
Fund
reform,
and
other
initiatives
of
the
Federal
Communications
Commission.
The
hearing
also
included
testimony
from
Kendra
Lamb,
of
Lamb
Farms,
representing
the
New
York
State
Farm
Bureau.
Following
the
field
hearing,
I

leaders
in

to
continue
the

to

development.
Both
events
were
a
great
opportunity
to
hear
from
community
members
on
this
important
issue
and
I
look
forward
to
holding
more
field
hearings
in
NY-27
in
the
future.
Congressman
Collins listens
to
community
members
on
the
importance
of
access
to
broadband.
Earlier
this

I
joined
Congressman
Brian
Higgins
in

on
the
Transportation
Security
Administration
(TSA)
to
reverse
its

to

the
Buffalo-Niagara
International
Airport&#8217;s
status
as
a
hub
airport.
Under
the
TSA&#8217;s
&#8220;hub
and
spoke
realignment&#8221;
plan,
the
Buffalo
airport
would
become
a
spoke
and
Albany
would
become
the
Upstate
hub.
Although
Albany
may
be
our
state
capital,
the
simple
fact
is
that
Buffalo
is
a
bigger,
busier
airport.
Given
the
passenger
and
flight
volume
at
the
Buffalo-Niagara
airport,
its
location
as
a
border
airport
requiring
more
complicated
TSA
work,
and
the
federal
law
enforcement
resources
already
located
in
Buffalo,
I
believe
removing
the
Buffalo-Niagara
Airport&#8217;s
hub
status
would
be
a
mistake.
Congressman
Higgins
and
I
will
continue
to
urge
the
TSA
to
rethink
its
decision
and
allow
Buffalo
to
remain
the
hub
for
Upstate
New
York.
Congressman

this

the

for
this

to

The
legislation
is
named
for
Gabriella
Miller,
a
girl
from
Virginia
who
fought
to
raise
awareness
for
pediatric
cancer
research
and
who
died
of
brain
cancer
last
year
at
the
age

10.
The
House
passed
the
Gabriella
Miller
Kids
First
Research
Act
on
December
11,
2013
in
a
294-103

and
I&#8217;m
glad
the
Senate
realized
the
need
to
reprioritize
our
nation&#8217;s

and
put
the
health
and
well-being
of
our
children
ahead

politics.
I
would
also
like
to
take
a

to
honor
the
late
Staff
Sgt.
William

of
Lockport,
who
was

the
Medal
of

for
his

near
St.

France
on
November
7,
1944
and
his
daughters
accepted
the
award
on
his
behalf.
Staff
Sgt.
Leonard
is
a
true
American
hero
and
I
ask
that
we
all
take
a
moment
to
remember
the
sacrifices
he
made
and
his
extraordinary
service
to
his
country.
