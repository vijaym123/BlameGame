David, I&rsquo;m asking for $5.
No tricks, no gimmicks --
just an email for $5.
-- the election is FOUR DAYS away
-- a brand new poll shows Brad TRAILING Bob Dold by 2 points
-- and Republicans are spending $2.5 MILLION against Brad this week alone. What else can we say?
What you do right now will determine the outcome of this race.
Seriously, Brad needs you now -- we&rsquo;re just asking for $5 (or more if you can afford it!). Please David, chip in $5 right now and send Brad back to Congress. If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
THANK YOU!
