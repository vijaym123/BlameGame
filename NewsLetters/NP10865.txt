Investing In The Future By Supporting Our
Teachers
Growing up as a student who
passed through Tarkio schools, of course I didnt realize it at the
time, but educating the young is a passion that called many to go the
extra mile for me and my future.
Many different factors play a role in securing a quality education for
all of Missouris students.
To this end, one of the most
important contributors is our teachers, who despite limited compensation and
long hours rise to that challenge every day.
Teachers have a
difficult job, and those working hard to educate our children should be
rewarded for their excellence.
Because teachers are dipping into their own pockets for almost $1,000
per year on various items students need, such as charts, books, and
instruments, full-time teachers used to be eligible for a $250 tax
deduction if they personally invested in classroom supplies.
This
deduction was extended for teachers every year since 2002, but expired at
the end of 2013.
In order to
maintain this commitment and say thank you to our teachers, I
introduced the
Teacher Tax Deduction Enhancement Act of 2013 .
This bipartisan legislation will renew and expand the teacher tax
deduction for teachers who purchase classroom supplies for their students
with their own money.
My bill renews the tax deduction through
2018 and increases the amount deductible for full-time teachers from
$250 to $500.
It also creates a new tax deduction of $250 for
part-time teachers and makes preschool teachers in state-recognized schools
eligible for the credit for the first time.
We should
support teachers who are going the extra mile for our children.
By
supporting teachers, we ensure that our children are prepared for
tomorrow.
Please know that I will continue to work with my
colleagues across both sides of the aisle in order to see this legislation
passed into law.
Sincerely,
Sam Graves
