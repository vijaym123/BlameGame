Rubio Comments On Easing Of U.S.
Sanctions On Cuba
Marco issued the following statement
regarding the Obama
Administrations announcement of
new regulations to ease U.S. sanctions on
Cuba:
This is a windfall for the
Castro regime that will be used to fund
its repression against Cubans, as well
as its activities against U.S. national
interests in Latin America and beyond.
Given existing U.S. laws about our Cuba
policy, this slew of regulations leave
at least one major question President
Obama and his administration have
failed to answer so far: what legal
authority does he have to enrich the
Castro regime in these ways?
Yesterday I
requested
answers from Secretary Lew
on how
this new Cuba policy would be
implemented without violating the
letter and spirit of several U.S. laws,
and without increasing the moral and
financial risk to the American taxpayer
and financial system of doing business
through Cubas
government-controlled financial system.
While those questions remain
unanswered, one thing thats
become even more crystal clear today is
that this one-sided deal is enriching a
tyrant and his regimeat the
expense of U.S. national interests and
the Cuban people.
In
a
letter to the President , Marco urged
Obama to provide answers regarding many
of the uncertainties surrounding the
release of the prisoners, and called on
him to ensure that U.S. policy toward
Cuba would be devoted to ending human
rights abuses committed by the Castro
regime.
Constituent Casework Corner
John, a veteran residing in Florida,
was told in 2009 by the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) that he did not
qualify to receive health care due to his
income. Five years later, he contacted
Senator Rubios office requesting
that the matter be looked into because he
felt a mistake had been made. A member of
the Senators staff contacted the
VA and requested a review of Johns
file. It was discovered that a mistake
had indeed been made, and that John was
eligible to receive VA health
care.John has since been issued a
VA Health Care Card.
