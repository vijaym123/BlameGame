Dear Friend,
On this Memorial Day weekend,
Id like to share with you a touching story about a local group of
students who came together to honor the Greatest
Generation.
The project started last summer in the basement of one of
Chartiers Valley School District buildings, when a plaque memorializing 17
World War II veterans killed during the war was
discovered.
Not willing to keep the plaque buried in storage, a group of students
took it upon themselves to not only learn about each of the veterans
engraved on the plaque but also connect with their families and
celebrate their service to the nation.
The men, killed in action
while serving during World War II, came from Bridgeville, Collier
Township, Heidelberg, and Scott Township. The students looked for
information about where the soldiers lived and went to school, which unit and
where they served during the war, and what members of their families
still live in the area.
Assisted by Robert Rodrigues, who
has been teaching history at CV for over 40 years, the students
gathered public information and worked with the federal National Personnel
Records Center to find about each soldiers history.
When
they contacted my office last year seeking help in pursuing
additional information, I never dreamed that this research project would end up
as a lasting memorial. On Friday, the students, families of the
soldiers, and I dedicated a new brick memorial featuring a bell and the
original plaque to honor the service of these seventeen young men to our
country (read the dedication program
here ).
We can never repay the debt we owe to those 17 men who put
country before all else. But as you come together with your family this
Memorial Day weekend, take time to reflect on their service, and the
courage and selflessness of all fallen soldiers, in your
community.
Sincerely,
Tim Murphy
