Friends,
Tomorrow, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is addressing a joint meeting of Congress at 11 a.m. Despite President Obama's vehement disapproval, I, as a strong supporter of Israel, am proud to have Prime Minister Netanyahu come to Washington to address Congress. He is expected to speak on a number of key issues, including the threat of a nuclear Iran and the dangers of Islamic extremism.

Fighting President Obama's Unconstitutional Actions
I also want to update you on our fight to fund the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) while denying the president any funds whatsoever to carry out his unconstitutional executive actions. From the outset of this debate, Ive said that we must keep the government open and shut the president down. Thats exactly where things stand today.
A federal judge in Texas has stopped the presidents unconstitutional executive actions, thanks to a lawsuit filed by dozens of states, including Georgia. While that decision stands, theres no reason to allow Homeland Security funding to lapse, which is why I voted last week to fund DHS through this Friday. By rejecting the Senates long-term funding bill, we have retained the ability to use the power of the purse if the judges decision is reversed. Rest assured, I will continue to fight to ensure the president is held accountable.
Freedom First,
Congressman Tom Graves
