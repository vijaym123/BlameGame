Honoring Our Veterans
Yesterday, I had the privilege of presenting Mr. Stanley Polcyn, a
veteran from Newtown, with the medals he earned serving our country in
the Korean War
. I feel
incredibly honored that my office was able to help Mr. Polcyn receive
his military awards and share them with his grandchildren. Most of all,
I'm grateful to Mr. Polcyn for his service and for sharing his story to
help our young people understand more fully this important part of our
history.
As we prepare to celebrate Veterans Day on Monday, we honor all who
have worn the uniform and sacrificed to defend our freedom. We also
need to recommit as a nation to addressing an unfortunate and
unacceptable reality - veterans of every generation are facing an
enormous array of challenges - some larger and more difficult to solve
than others - but all unacceptable.
In July, I held a roundtable in Simsbury
to hear directly
from local veterans about the challenges they face. By far the gravest
and most troubling issue raised during the roundtable was the epidemic
of veteran and servicemember suicides. As the House took up defense
appropriations later that month, I offered amendments that included the
transfer of $10 million to support suicide prevention awareness and
outreach for our servicemembers.
These amendments were passed by the House, and
a step in the right direction, but there is more we can and must do.
Another challenge too many veterans have to endure is inexcusable
bureaucratic delays. Some of the first calls we got at our office were
from veterans who had requested replacement medals but were
experiencing delays of months and even years. My staff and I helped
these veterans cut through the bureaucracy to receive their medals.
Their experiences led me to introduce the PROMPT Act
, bipartisan legislation to ensure the
timely replacement of military decorations for service members,
veterans, and their families.
I and my office are here to help. In addition to helping secure medals,
we are proud to provide a variety of support to veterans, those
currently serving in the armed forces, as well as their families on a
range of federal issues including gaining access to medical benefits,
records of service, home loans, and educational benefits.
If I, or my office, can help with these issues or any other, please
contact us by email at Esty.House.Gov/Contact
, by phone at (860) 223-8412, by fax at (860) 225-7289, or
by mail at 114 West Main Street #206, New Britain, CT 06051.
Upcoming Events
Many of the best ideas I can bring to Washington are the result of
input from constituents like you. Recently, I introduced two bills to
support workforce development that are the direct result of the
insights I've heard from manufacturers and workers across our district.
With Congress back in session next week, I want to make sure I keep
hearing from you directly.
Tomorrow, Saturday, November 9, from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM, I'm holding
Congress on Your Corner in New Milford, at the Village Center for the
Arts on 12 Main St. I hope you'll come by to share your thoughts,
concerns, and suggestions on any issue you like. My district staff will
also be on hand to assist you with any issue you may be having with a
federal agency.
Can't make it on Saturday? Next, Wednesday, November 13 at 7:00 PM, I'm
holding a tele-town hall, and you can be a part of the conversation
from the comfort of your own home! We'll be discussing the latest on my
legislative work, taking your questions, and hearing from you and your
neighbors about what's important for central and northwest Connecticut.
Sign up for our tele-town hall at esty.house.gov/teletownhall
no later than 5:00 PM on Tuesday, November 12.
And on Saturday, November 16, from 1:00 to 3:00 PM, my office is
hosting a health insurance enrollment workshop in Waterbury where you
can stop by to get information on the health care plans available for
you and your family through Access Health CT, our state's new health
insurance marketplace, and get enrolled too. Representatives from
Access Health CT, Safe Haven of Greater Waterbury, Staywell FQHC, and
Waterbury Hospital will be on hand to answer your questions and help
you sign up on the spot.

Honoring
Our
Veterans
Yesterday,
I
had
the
privilege
of
presenting
Mr.
Stanley
Polcyn,
a
veteran
from
Newtown,
with
the
medals
he
earned
serving
our
country
in
the
Korean
War .
I
feel
incredibly
honored
that
my
office
was
able
to
help
Mr.
Polcyn
receive
his
military
awards
and
share
them
with
his
grandchildren.
Most
of
all,
I&#8217;m
grateful
to
Mr.
Polcyn
for
his
service
and
for

to

we

there
is

we

to
veterans,
those
currently
serving
in

issues
including
gaining
access
to
medical
benefits,
