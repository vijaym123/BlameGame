Dear Friend,
In 49 of the past 50 months, more Americans have dropped out of the labor force than have found jobs.
Although the June jobs report claimed that the unemployment rate dropped from 6.3 percent to 6.1 percent, those numbers fail to tell the whole story.
It does not include the missing workers, those people who have given up looking for work.
Currently, there are over 5 million missing workers in this country, which, if accounted for, would cause the unemployment rate to rise to 11.1 percent.
Putting people back to work in good jobs is the key to getting our economy moving again.
It is an issue that touches the lives of so many Americans
from our moms and dads who have been laid off to our college graduates who cannot find their first jobs.
The House has acted.
In fact, the House has passed nearly 300 bills that have yet to get even a vote in the Senate.
Among the bills collecting dust in the Senate is a tax-relief bill that passed the House last week.
H.R. 4718 amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make 50-percent bonus depreciation permanent.
This bill would enable businesses to immediately expense half of their investment in equipment, allowing them to expand their products at a greater rate, grow their businesses, and stimulate the economy.
The Tax Foundation found that this single change in the tax code would add $182 billion to the economy and create 212,000 jobs.
The House also passed the final version of the SKILLS Act last week after it had been sitting in the Senate for over a year.
H.R. 803, the
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (SKILLS Act) , consolidates 15 duplicative and ineffective federal workforce programs into one improved program.
It requires states to submit one unified four-year workforce plan to address core programs, reduce administrative costs, and ensure programs are actually helping people as intended.
And it targets both youth and adults who face barriers to employment by providing occupational skills training for specific careers.
The bill is now headed to the Presidents desk.
In addition to job bills, the House has passed multiple energy bills that would expand U.S. energy production, cut costs, and create thousands of more jobs.
You can read more about those bills

There is so much potential around the country for jobs, for economic growth, and for the higher quality of life that growth provides.
Even small steps can make a big difference, and the House will keep pushing for commonsense reforms and encourage the Senate and the White House to join those efforts.
