Friends,
If I were to ask if you're more than
$55,000 in debt, how would you answer?
Depending on
your finances, this question might confuse you. But the truth is, each
of us has to answer "yes" no matter how fiscally responsible we've
been.
Why?
According to data from the U.S.
Census Bureau, our nation's total debt amounts to $55,260 for every man,
woman and child living today. This is unsustainable and completely
unacceptable.
Encouraging job creation and economic growth in
Northeast Ohio goes hand-in-hand with putting a stop to Washington's
spending problem.
Check out this video for a personal
message from me
about how and why I'm facing this issue head-on
to get our nation back on track.
