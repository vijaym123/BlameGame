Congress Reconvenes
as Levin Calls for Action to Renew Jobless
Benefits
As Congress reassembles this week at the
midpoint of the two-year 113th Congress, its hard to avoid the
conclusion that this is the least productive Congress in modern history.
One year into the 113th
Congress, only 72 laws have been enacted.
By comparison, the
House and Senate approved 284 laws during the 111th Congress.
Further, many of the 72 laws that
were approved this year dealt with minor matters, such as naming
buildings and roads, or involved non-controversial transfers of land.
And then there was the Freedom to Fish Act, which allowed anglers to
fish near ten dams in Kentucky and Tennessee, and the National
Baseball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act, that specified the amount of
precious metal to be used by the U.S. Mint in making the coins
commemorating the National Baseball Hall of Fames 75th anniversary.
Conspicuously absent were any
new laws to create jobs, grow the economy, strengthen the middle
class, repair our countrys crumbling infrastructure, overhaul the tax
code, or fix our nations broken immigration system.
A re-write of
our nations agriculture laws is also months behind schedule.
The
list goes on.
One bill that
the House of Representatives should take up immediately is legislation
Rep. Levin introduced to renew the federal emergency unemployment
compensation program.
On December 28, 1.3 million people nationwide
lost their federal unemployment insurance.
In the first six
months of 2014, an additional 1.9 million Americans will lose their
coverage as they exhaust their state benefits and are unable to receive
federal unemployment insurance
with 72,000 losing their benefits each
week during the first half of 2014.
Job-seeking Americans deserve better.
During the last weeks, Mr.
Levin has made available the following
