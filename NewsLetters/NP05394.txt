Wicker: Mississippi Is
Reaping the
Benefits of the New Farm
Bill
Law Provides Stability for
Farmers,
Cuts Federal Spending for
Taxpayers
During the month of October, scenes of
hard-working farmers bringing in the year's harvest are commonplace in
Mississippi. More than 42,000 farms populate our landscape, growing
commodities such as poultry, catfish, cotton, corn, soybeans, and peanuts.
According to the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce,
the industry totaled $7.5 billion in 2013, making it the largest job
creator in the
state.
Congress took steps earlier this year to provide farmers and ranchers across
the country with a number of key program revisions. These new tools
were included in a comprehensive "Farm Bill," which was signed into law
in February 2014. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recently
reported that progress has been made on "every (part) of the Farm Bill
including risk management tools, farm loan programs, agricultural
research, and disaster relief to farmers and ranchers." But more work
remains to be done.
Certainty and Stability for
Farmers
Farming and ranching
operations are highly dependent on cooperating weather and consumer
demand. They constantly battle razor-thin profit margins. To combat these
challenges, USDA is in the process of implementing the law's new risk
management tools, including price and revenue protections, and crop
insurance reforms. These reforms will help provide farmers certainty and
stability when making decisions about production loans, equipment, and
crop insurance costs. Producers and taxpayers should soon begin to see
the results of these critical
improvements.
One of the most significant parts of the law is the
reduction in overall mandatory spending -- $23 billion over the next
10 years, including vital reforms to the nation's food stamp program.
Mississippi is fortunate to have Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss.,
leading the way on developing the new Farm Bill. As the lead Republican on
the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, he saw
that the law was both fiscally responsible and beneficial to every
Mississippian.
Safeguarding the Catfish
Market
For years, Mississippi's catfish
industry has been constantly undercut by underpriced frozen fish fillets
from Asia. The Farm Bill protects American producers by helping to
level the playing field. The law directs the USDA to finish implementing
the catfish inspection program. This program requires all producers of
catfish
domestic and international
to abide by the same food
safety standards.
Unfortunately,
the program has been stalled by bureaucratic entanglements at the
Office of Management and Budget. That agency is required to sign off
before implementation of USDA's catfish inspection program can begin. I am
hopeful that the Administration will approve the program soon.
Safeguarding the catfish market from foreign counterfeits is not only
important for producers but also for consumers who have a right to have
access to clean farm-raised catfish.
Regulatory Overreach Threatens
Farmers
Despite the
impact of the Farm Bill, it seems the Obama Administration is looking
for new ways to obstruct the positive progress of our nation's farmers
and small businesses. In April, the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed a new rule to expand
federal authority under the Clean Water Act to regulate even small
streams, farm ditches, wetlands, and ponds.
Their broadened
definition of the "waters of the United States" flies in the face of
long-standing Congressional intent and Supreme Court rulings.
In the Senate, my colleagues and I have
worked to prevent overreach by EPA and the Corps under the Clean Water
Act.
I am a cosponsor of the "Protecting Water and Property Rights
Act of 2014," a bill introduced by Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., to stop
the agencies' proposed rule from being finalized.
I am committed to working with producers in
our state to ensure agriculture remains an integral part of our economy
and our way of life. The new farm bill is a good step in that
direction.
