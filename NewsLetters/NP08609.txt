Dear Friends,
On Friday, I brought together representatives from Veterans'
organizations around the 7th District to discuss their experiences with
the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The group of about 20
Veterans, including former State Senator and Veteran Dave Zien, shared
their frustrations with the VA system, bravely offered candid
testimonials, and engaged in a
thoughtful and ultimately productive discussion about
opportunities for reforming the process and cleaning-up the agency.
Reforming the VA system has been a priority of mine long before the
scandal in Phoenix, AZ was plastered all over the newspapers, but
hearing the firsthand accounts from Veterans in our own backyard
reignited my outrage with the entire agency. One Veteran, after hearing
about the emotional, and harrowing, experience of a fellow Veteran in
attendance who is battling Cancer, commented that the VA treats
Veterans like second or third class citizens. That is absolutely
unacceptable. Our Veterans should be using their energy to fight
Cancer, not the VA.
As difficult as it may be to listen to these experiences, sharing them
is the key to getting the Obama Administration to tune-in to the issue
and to get something done. It is because of the brave men and women who
have chosen to speak out that the spotlight is squarely on the
President and the people he has appointed to run this agency. They do
not like it when the heat is on them, but if we want results, we need
to keep it on them, and turn it up.
While the Obama Administration has thus far demonstrated an
unwillingness to move swiftly on VA reforms, for our part, the
U.S. House of Representatives is moving quickly to right this wrong.
Just this week, the House passed, and I was proud to support, a VA
reform bill that would allow Veterans to seek care from a private
doctor if they cannot get an appointment within the department's wait
time goals. Also, as a result of Friday's conversation, I plan to
spearhead an inquiry into the treatment of Wisconsin Veterans.
Additionally, I will utilize my position in Congress to look-in to
legislative opportunities to streamline and simplify the VA's records
process.
This week's meeting was a follow-up from a delegation-wide meeting that
I hosted this past April with representatives from the Department of
Veterans Affairs to address the backlog and recording issues within the
Agency, an issue that was brought to my attention by constituents.
The steps I am taking and supporting on your be-half are a direct
result of the experiences you have share with me, and the conversations
we have had on this issue. Please continue to call my office, email me,
or even flag me down when you see my around the district, and let me
know how we are doing. Our Veterans, and their families, honorably
served this great nation; we owe them a higher standard of service and
gratitude in return.
Separately, to all of the father's currently serving our nation who are
not able to be with their children today, my family and I are praying
for you and very grateful for your service and sacrifice to our nation.
To all Dad's, I hope you are having a great Father's Day; keep up the
great work. Until next week.
Have a great week,
Sean

A
Message
from
Representative
Sean
Duffy
June 15, 2014
Dear
Friends,
On
Friday,
I
brought
together
representatives
from
Veterans&#8217;
organizations
around
the
7 th
District
to
discuss
their
experiences
with
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA).
The
group
of
about
20
Veterans,
including
former
State
Senator
and
Veteran
Dave
Zien,
shared
their
frustrations
with
the
VA
system,
bravely
offered
candid
testimonials,
and
engaged
in
a
thoughtful
and
ultimately
productive
discussion
about
opportunities
for
reforming
the
process
and
cleaning-up
the
agency.
Reforming
the
VA
system
has
been
a
priority
of
mine
long
before
the
scandal
in
Phoenix,
AZ
was
plastered
all
over
the
newspapers,
but
hearing
the
firsthand
accounts
from
Veterans
in
our
own
backyard
reignited
my
outrage
with
the
entire
agency.
One
Veteran,
after
hearing
about
the
emotional,
and
harrowing,
experience
of
a
fellow
Veteran
in
attendance
who
is
battling
Cancer,
commented
that
the
VA
treats
Veterans
like
second
or
third
class
citizens.
That
is
absolutely
unacceptable.
Our
Veterans
should
be
using
their
energy
to
fight
Cancer,
not
the
VA.
As
difficult
as
it
may
be
to
listen
to
these
experiences,
sharing
them
is
the
key
to
getting
the
Obama
Administration
to
tune-in
to
the
issue
and
to
get
something
done.
It
is
because
of
the
brave
men
and
women
who
have
chosen
to
speak
out
that
the
spotlight
is
squarely
on
the
President
and
the
people
he
has
appointed
to
run
this
agency.
They
do
not
like
it
when
the
heat
is
on
them,
but
if
we
want
results,
we
need
to
keep
it
on
them,
and
turn
it
up.
While
the
Obama
Administration
has
thus
far
demonstrated
an
unwillingness
to
move
swiftly
on
VA
reforms,
for
our
part,
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives
is
moving
quickly
to
right
this
wrong.
Just
this
week,
the
House
passed,
and
I
was
proud
to
support,
a
VA
reform
bill
that
would
allow
Veterans
to
seek
care
from
a
private
doctor
if
they
cannot
get
an
appointment
within
the
department&#8217;s
wait
time
goals.
Also,
as
a
result
of
Friday&#8217;s
conversation,
I
plan
to
spearhead
an
inquiry
into
the
treatment
of
Wisconsin
Veterans.
Additionally,
I
will
utilize
my
position
in
Congress
to
look-in
to
legislative
opportunities
to
streamline
and
simplify
the
VA&#8217;s
records
process.
This
week&#8217;s
meeting
was
a
follow-up
from
a
delegation-wide
meeting
that
I
hosted
this
past
April
with
representatives
from
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
to
address
the
backlog
and
recording
issues
within
the
Agency,
an
issue
that
was
brought
to
my
attention
by
constituents.
The
steps
I
am
taking
and
supporting
on
your
be-half
are
a
direct
result
of
the
experiences
you
have
share
with
me,
and
the
conversations
we
have
had
on
this
issue.
Please
continue

my

email
me,
or
even
flag
me
down
when
you
see
my
around
the
district,
and
let
me
know
how
we
are
doing.
Our
Veterans,
and
their
families,
honorably
served
this
great
nation;
we
owe
them
a
higher
standard
of
service
and
gratitude
in
return.
Separately,
to
all
of
the

serving

I

you

To
all
Dad&#8217;s,
I
hope
you
are
having
a
great
Father&#8217;s
Day;
keep
up
the
great
work.
Until

Have
