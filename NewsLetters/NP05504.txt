ALERT: Rove launches MASSIVE ad campaign against Cheri
David, Karl Rove&rsquo;s dark money group just released a last minute attack against Cheri.
We thought we could fight back, but we&rsquo;re sad to report that we&rsquo;re still coming up 453 donations behind on our Rapid Response goal. Here&rsquo;s the hard truth:
If we don&rsquo;t hit our goal before Wednesday's FEC deadline, Cheri's campaign for Illinois could be lost for good.
David, please. We need your urgent support. Not tomorrow, not next week -- RIGHT NOW. Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks,
