Saluting Small Businesses and Entrepreneurs
This week marks National Small Business Week, a time dedicated to saluting small business owners and entrepreneurs for their important contributions to our economy and our communities. In the House, we are working hard to pass bipartisan legislation to help small businesses grow and thrive. In the first 100 days alone, we passed bills to ease the regulatory burden, provide much-needed tax relief, restore the 40-hour work week under Obamacare, and more. If we are to build a healthy economy and create good-paying jobs, it will be because of the creativity, innovation, and determination our nation's small businesses. That's why I remain committed to working to get government out of the way, so Michigan small business owners can do what they do best.
