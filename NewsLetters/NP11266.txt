Friends,
Four years ago today, President Barack Obama signed Obamacare
into law . This signing ceremony launched an expensive sales
pitch by the White House to convince millions of Americans to support the
health care overhaul, and persuade the uninsured 16 percent of
Americans to purchase health care insurance.
I have strong doubts that American families,
health care professionals, and insurance agencies will celebrate this
anniversary.
Over the
past four years, we have seen millions of health plans cancelled,
doctors dropped from provider networks, and businesses slow or freeze
hiring.
I agree that
our health care system needs reforms, but
Obamacare is not the fix Americans need or one they can
afford.
Have you seen your premium spike or coverage
dropped due to this law?
Please share your Obamacare stories
with me by emailing them to
tom.rice@mail.house.gov.

100
Days Have Passed
The
implementation of Obamacare has been a costly train wreck, forcing the
President to admit his signature law is flawed.
On December
3, 2013, he made a plea to the public for health reform ideas.
[If] you still think this law is a bad idea then youve got to
tell us specifically what youd do differently to cut costs, cover
more people, make insurance more secure, he said.
In response
on December 10,
2013, I joined 33 of my colleagues in sending a letter to the
President outlining our ideas.
To our surprise, he still has
not responded to our suggestions.
On January 28, 2014, during his State of the Union
address the President said, I dont expect to convince my Republican
friends on the merits of this law [Obamacare].So again, if you have
specific plans to cut costs, cover more people, and increase choice
tell America what youd do differently.
I am disappointed
the President will
not put politics and rhetoric aside, and engage in a conversation about
real solutions
that would save seniors from Obamacares
Medicare cuts, families from soaring health care costs, and allow
Americans to keep their doctors of choice.
District Work Week Wrap-Up
I had a great time meeting with various municipal
leaders, law enforcement officials, and civic groups this week.
We discussed ways we can make our district more competitive and
attract more jobs to our area.
Community input is invaluable
and I believe that when a community works together, it
thrives.
If you would like to schedule a meeting with me, share an
idea, or voice your opinion, please contact one of my offices listed at
the bottom of this email.
This week I met with the Bennettsville Rotary,
Myrtle Beach Rotary, Southern Florence Municipal Leaders, North
Myrtle Beach GOP, North Myrtle Beach Pep Club, SCDOT Secretary
Hall, and discussed my NCAA March Madness bracket with
Florence Sports Radio station, "The Fan." Here are some
pictures:
It is an honor to
represent you and your family.
Have a good
week,
