Rep. Lipinski Sides with
American Workers
and American Manufacturing
Again;
Votes No on Fast-Track
Today, the House of Representatives narrowly voted to give
the president the authority to fast-track trade agreements through
Congress.
If the Senate approves the stand-alone Fast-Track bill,
Congress will be limited to just an up-or-down vote on any
administration-negotiated trade deals with no amendments allowed and only limited
debate.
Choosing to protect American workers, American
manufacturers, and our environment, Congressman Dan Lipinski (IL-3) voted
no again on Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), commonly referred to as
the Fast-Track bill.
Today is a sad day for
the American people, especially the quickly-eroding middle class, said
Rep. Lipinski.
The House
made up of men and women that
have been elected by the American people to represent them
has
voluntarily decided to give away their constitutional authority on trade,
increasing the likelihood of yet another trade agreement like NAFTA and
the Korea Free Trade Agreement that destroys American jobs, lowers
wages, and puts the consumer and environmental protections we rely on in
doubt.
The biggest problem with this
bill is that it does not adequately deal with currency manipulation,
which is the mechanism that many countries use to make American goods
more expensive, thus killing even more American jobs.
Right
now, the President is negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)
with 11 major countries that comprise 40% of the United States goods
trade.
In fact, we have been told that once TPA is law the
TPP negotiations will be done in two weeks.
What this
really means is that TPP is complete, but it is being kept hidden from the
American people.
I have read the parts of the TPP they will let
me see, and I know its a bad deal.
If the Senate passes
the stand-alone Fast-Track bill, I plan to use the only option I have
left, my up-or-down vote, to stand with American workers and American
manufacturing and oppose
TPP.

Delivers Statement on the House Floor
Congratulating the Chicago
Blackhawks
on Winning the 2015 Stanley Cup
Congressman Dan Lipinski (IL-3) delivered the following statement on the
House floor this week congratulating the 2015 Stanley Cup Champion
Chicago Blackhawks:
Mr.Speaker, last night I wore my Tony Esposito number 35
Blackhawks jersey from the 1970s and I watched what I could never have
imagined back then, a Chicago Blackhawks Stanley Cup dynasty.
But
thanks to the leadership of owner Rocky Wirtz and an amazing team put
together by Stan Bowman and led by Coach Q, the Hawks won their third
Stanley Cup in six years.
The core of Toews, Keith, Kane, Hossa,
Seabrook, Hjarmalsson, and Sharp have been there for all three.
This year Duncan Keith brought home the Conn Smyth MVP trophy, but this
was truly a team effort.
Chicagoland thanks everyone in the
organization for once again making us proud and bringing the Cup back to
Chicago.
I can't wait for the parade and to see the Cup.

Rep. Lipinski and Freight
Rail Officials Unveil New Technology to Improve Community Safety in
Response to Hazmat Accidents
Congressman Dan Lipinski
(IL-3) joined recently with area first responders and rail industry
leaders at a BNSF Railway facility in Chicago to demonstrate new
electronic, smart-app safety technology
called AskRail that will allow
first responders who show up at the scene of a train accident to quickly
find out what type of hazardous materials are being carried on each
rail car.
The critical need for this technology has been made
more evident by recent rail accidents that have resulted in fires and the
release of hazardous materials.
Northeastern Illinois is at the center of the nations freight
transportation system and is the nations rail hub, so I am committed
to making sure that Americas rails are as safe as possible, said Rep.
Lipinski.
But in the event of an accident, I want to make sure
our first responders have the best possible capabilities to protect
our communities.
I have been pushing the federal government and
the railroads to develop an electronic system so that no first
responder ever again has to board a locomotive to find out what types of
hazardous materials are being carried on a train that has been in an
accident.
I am happy the railroads have responded with the AskRail
technology.
This will greatly help our first responders and make
our communities
safer.
