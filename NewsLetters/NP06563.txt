Friend,
Quick update on where we are regarding the outside attacks flooding the airwaves of our district.
Through your support, we hit our $10,000 goal from last week.
And it&#39;s a good thing we did - the attack ads are running more frequently than we first expected.
That means our ads need to run more frequently as well. So, we&#39;ve upped our goal to $15,000.
As of this moment, we&#39;re $3,760 away from hitting that goal by our critical deadline of
midnight tomorrow night

We&#39;ve told you before, and we&#39;ll say it again -
this goal is an important one.
We have key budgeting decisions that we have to make this week, and whether or not we hit this goal will directly affect how we&#39;re able to respond to the ads that have been running against us.
After enduring a three week negative ad blitz, it&#39;s absolutely imperative that our response is strong. Click here to give $5, $10, or more so that we hit our goal before midnight tomorrow .
Thanks.
Best,
Team Bera
PS - Don&#39;t forget - tomorrow night&#39;s deadline is important. It will determine how well we&#39;ll be able to respond to the attack ads that have been running non-stop for the past three weeks.
