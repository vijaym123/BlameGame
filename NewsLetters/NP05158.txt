Folks, I&rsquo;m in the fight of my life.
We&rsquo;ve managed to become Republicans&rsquo; number one target, and with less than two weeks left, no one knows how this race will turn out.
I&rsquo;m not worried about what losing would mean for me
-- I&rsquo;m worried about what it would mean for my constituents. I&rsquo;m worried about what it would mean for middle class families and seniors just trying to make ends meet.
This election isn&rsquo;t about me, friend. It&rsquo;s about keeping your voices in Congress and continuing to fight for the issues you care about most.
I&rsquo;m going to fight as hard as I can for the next 11 days, and with your help, I know we&rsquo;ll be successful.
