Yesterday there was a rally to futher
expose problems at the Veterans Administration (VA). We had the chance
to listen to many of our deserving heroes and better understand the
issues they're facing with the local VA hospital. Please, take a look at
the article below. Let me know what you think.
Arizona Republic:
Vets rally in Phoenix to decry VA care, seek
reforms

Roughly 150 veterans and their supporters rallied at Steele Indian School
Park Wednesday to call attention to deep flaws in the Phoenix VA Health
Care System and to seek congressional reform.
The rally, attended by Rep. David Schweikert,
R-Ariz., was organized by Concerned Veterans for America in the wake
of last week's disclosures by current and former Department of
Veterans Affairs employees and a congressional committee that dozens of VA
hospital patients in Arizona may have died while awaiting medical
care.
Schweikert urged those
in the audience Wednesday to press for legislation that would hold VA
administrators accountable by making it easier to fire those who are
incompetent.
"Management needs to know, when they screw up, they lie to us, they
misrepresent the numbers, they don't get transferred to another facility, they
get transferred to the unemployment line," Schweikert
said.
Last week, Rep. Jeff Miller,
R-Fla., chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, said the
panel's investigators have concluded as many as 40 Arizona veteran deaths
could be related to VA delays in providing them medical care. He said
investigators also have evidence that the Phoenix system keeps two sets
of records to conceal prolonged patient waits for doctor appointments
and treatment.
Schweikert said that estimate of the number of veterans who died awaiting
care may be short of the actual number.
"Be prepared to see a very different number when the
investigation is over," Schweikert added. "This is about truth
telling."
