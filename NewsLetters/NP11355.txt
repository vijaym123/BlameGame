Extending Unemployment Benefits
Last week, Jeff helped reach a bipartisan deal to restore emergency
unemployment benefits that were cut off at the end of December. Joining
with four fellow Democrats and five Republicans, Jeff and his
colleagues announced a deal that would restore this critical lifeline
for five months, including retroactive payments for families that were
cut off in December. As Jeff said, "These benefits will help keep food
on the table and a roof over the heads of struggling Oregonians and
their families while they find work." Their agreement will soon go to
the full Senate for a vote and could pass the Senate as soon as next
week.

Fixing Flood Insurance
Something is terribly wrong when homeowners are more worried about
raging flood insurance premiums than raging flood waters. Ever since
Jeff heard from Oregon families about the drastic flood insurance rate
hikes they were facing as a result of a misguided 2012 law, he has been
working to make sure their voices are heard and these huge rate hikes
were fixed. He held a hearing last fall so DC would hear about the harm
this law was causing across Oregon. Following the hearing, he brought
together a bipartisan group of lawmakers to draft legislation that
would fix the problems facing homeowners and businesses. Last week,
that bipartisan proposal passed Congress and is headed to the
President's desk to be signed into law -- providing a huge relief for
middle class Oregonians who were facing unaffordable flood insurance
increases.
A Modest Raise for Seniors
Every hardworking American should be able to retire comfortably in
their golden years. Last week, Jeff held a hearing in his Economic
Policy Subcommittee about the state of retirement security and what we
can do to put a comfortable retirement within reach of more seniors.
The hearing noted that traditional pensions are available to fewer
people and that ordinary families face risks and difficulties saving
enough for retirement through IRAs and 401(k)s. Despite the increasing
importance of Social Security to America's seniors, the federal
government routinely underestimates the real costs seniors face in
their cost-of-living adjustments. Jeff endorsed giving seniors a modest
raise and raising cost-of-living adjustments to match the true costs
seniors face.

The first in his family to go to college, Jeff still lives in the same
working class neighborhood that his parents eventually settled in and
his kids go to the same public high school he attended. Making the
'American Dream' a reality for others as it has been for him is what
got Jeff Merkley involved in public life and is what continues to keep
him fighting for Oregon families.
In the four years he has been in the U.S. Senate, Jeff Merkley has been
focused on creating jobs and getting our nation back on track. He led
the fight against high-risk gambling on Wall Street, has been a leading

wrote the law that helps small businesses raise money on the internet
so they can grow and create jobs.
