Dear Friends,
If you or someone you know does not have health insurance, an important deadline is approaching that I wanted to make you aware of.
Once you get past the drama of all the hand wringing and political scorecards about the Affordable Care Act (ACA), it comes down to this: having access to health care coverage can save lives and money.
Health insurance is an important protection for the financial and health security of America&rsquo;s families.
I am pleased to provide you with information to help you or someone you may know to connect with local healthcare resources that can provide enrollment assistance for the ACA.
You may visit
healthcare.gov
or call the toll-free ACA consumer helpline at 1-800-318-2596 to get your marketplace questions answered.
Or you can call United Way&rsquo;s 211 Line to find out about enrollment assistance near you.
Through the Health Insurance Marketplace, Americans can compare and shop for health insurance.
You cannot be turned down, and you may even be able to get help paying for your new insurance.
We are glad to help.
Should you have questions or need assistance getting connected, don't hesitate to reach one of our district offices listed at the bottom of this newsletter.
If you or someone you know does not have health insurance, or if you are losing your coverage, or you are not eligible to be covered under an affordable, quality employer plan,
you have until March 31 to sign up!
Of course if you are covered by Medicare, Medicaid for Elderly, Blind, or Disabled, the VA health program, or a good and affordable insurance through your job or your spouse&rsquo;s job, you don&rsquo;t have to sign up.
If you have no coverage, however, the deadline to get covered is in just 10 days.
Please spread the word and remind your friends and neighbors that they need to be covered by March 31st!
Cordially,
U.S. Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur
Representing Ohio&rsquo;s 9th Congressional District
