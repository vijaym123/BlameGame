Wishing You
a Season of Peace and Good Will
Dear Friend,
As we gather with our families and
friends during this holiday season, I hope
you will join me in pausing to take account
of our many blessings
the blessings
of American freedom, American peace, and
American prosperity.
And while it is often easy to take these
blessings for granted, we must always
remember that our freedom, our peace, and
our prosperity have been won generation
after generation by the tremendous
sacrifices of our brave men and women in
uniform.
Recently, we recognized the 70th
anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge
during World War II, one of the greatest
victories in American history. On December
16, 1944, German forces launched a surprise
attack on Allied forces. More than 600,000
American soldiers were involved in this
intense engagement and suffered tens of
thousands of casualties. But after six
weeks of fighting in harsh conditions, the
Allied forces pushed the Germans back.
Allied forces then simultaneously attacked
Germany, which ultimately led to the Nazi
surrender. This important history reminds
us of the courage, the strength, and the
sacrifice that our brave men and women in
uniform have displayed over many
generations, preserving our American way of
life.
So during this season of peace and good
will, let us remember the sacrifices of all
of service members, who are indeed our
peacemakers. Let us also remember that many
of these men and women will be away from
their families this year. Please join me in
keeping our soldiers and their families,
wherever they may be, in our thoughts and
prayers.
As 2014 comes to a close, so too does
the 113th Congress. So as we begin a new
year and commence a new 114th Congress, let
us recommit ourselves to the promises we
have made to work every day to make our
nation better than we found it. Let us
recommit ourselves to the founding
constitutional principles that have made
this country great
principles of
freedom, limited government, and unlimited
opportunity. Let us recommit ourselves to
working every day to promote policies that
will make it easier for our farmers, our
Main Street businesses, and our working
families to succeed. I believe that if we
keep our promises we will indeed build a
stronger America for our children and
grandchildren.
It is a great honor to serve the people
of Virginia's 5th District, and I thank you
for giving me the opportunity to represent
you in the United States Congress. I look
forward to serving you for the next two
years as we work toward our shared goal of
a brighter and stronger future for our
great nation.
I hope you and your family will enjoy
this season of peace and good will, and I
wish you a Merry Christmas, a Happy
Hanukkah, and a Happy New Year.
