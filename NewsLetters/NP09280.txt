Dear Friend,
On Wednesday, the Inspector General released its interim report
regarding the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care System.
The findings of the IG report are inexcusable. This report backs up the
allegations of a systematic failure at the VA and shows criminal type
behavior took place to conceal wait times and deny veterans the health
care they are owed and deserve. I believe all those involved must be
held accountable for these reprehensible actions of mismanagement and
neglect that have put too many lives at risk.
These actions have also led me to lose faith in the current leadership
of the VA. At this point, I don't see how Secretary Shinseki can
continue to serve as the head of this vast and what has become a
dysfunctional bureaucracy. The activities that have been allowed to
take place on his watch are disgraceful, and I believe Secretary
Shinseki should resign.
Our veterans deserve to have a capable manager who can restore trust
and begin to repair the VA from top to bottom. Our veterans were
promised a health care system that would provide them with the best
care in the world, and it is clear the current leadership at the VA has
failed to live up to that standard.
Sincerely,
Kay Granger
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
On
Wednesday,
the
Inspector
General
released
its
interim
report
regarding
the
Phoenix
Veterans
Affairs
Health
Care
System.
The
findings
of
the
IG
report
are
inexcusable.
This
report
backs
up
the
allegations
of
a
systematic
failure
at
the
VA
and
shows
criminal
type
behavior
took
place
to
conceal
wait
times
and
deny
veterans
the
health
care
they
are
owed
and
deserve.
I
believe
all
those
involved
must
be
held
accountable
for
these
reprehensible
actions
of
mismanagement
and
neglect
that
have
put
too
many
lives
at
risk.
These
actions
have
also
led
me
to
lose
faith
in
the
current
leadership
of
the
VA.
At
this
point,
I
don&#8217;t
see
how
Secretary
Shinseki
can
continue
to
serve
as
the
head
of
this
vast
and
what
has
become
a
dysfunctional
bureaucracy.
The
activities
that
have
been
allowed
to
take
place
on
his
watch
are
disgraceful,
and
I
believe
Secretary
Shinseki
should
resign.
Our
veterans
deserve
to
have
a
capable
manager
who
can
restore
trust
and
begin
to
repair
the
VA
from
top
to
bottom.
Our
veterans
were
promised
a
health
care
system
that
would
provide
them
with
the
best
care
in
the
world,
and
it
is
clear
the
current
leadership
at
the
VA
has
failed
to
live
up
to
that
standard.
Sincerely,
Kay
Granger
