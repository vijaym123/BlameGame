Kansas Common Sense
November 17, 2014
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thanks for your continued interest in
receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
Senate to Vote on Keystone XL Pipeline
After more than six years since the initial permit application for the
Keystone XL Pipeline, the Senate is expecting to have its first binding
vote to approve this project this week. On Friday, the House approved
legislation, 252-161, for the ninth time to authorize construction.
I suspect this is merely the first of many issues to finally receive
the Senate's attention after years of being denied votes. This vote
should have happened years ago, and while I am pleased it will finally
be brought to the Senate floor, President Obama will likely veto the
measure once it reaches his desk.
The Keystone XL Pipeline is an additional phase to the original
Keystone Pipeline that currently moves crude oil from Steele City,
Nebraska, through Kansas to the processing facility in Cushing,
Oklahoma. Portions of the Keystone XL Pipeline have already been built
and are in operation, including a pipeline linking Cushing, Oklahoma,
to Port Arthur, Texas. The newest addition to be voted on would link
the existing Keystone infrastructure to the oil-rich Bakken granting
greater accessibility to domestic natural resources. Unfortunately, the
White House has refused to approve the permit application for the
remaining 1,200 miles of pipeline to be built despite President Obama's
own State Department's view that this project can move forward. The
Administration's delays have prevented the creation of new well-paying
jobs and economic growth for Americans. Approving the Keystone XL
pipeline will help ensure a stable energy supply for our nation, and
will also reduce U.S. reliance on oil from the Middle East. I look
forward to supporting this legislation.
Monitoring the Ebola Response
On Wednesday, I participated in a Senate Appropriations Committee
hearing on the government's response to the Ebola outbreak. Testifying
at this hearing were officials from the United States Department of
Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland Security, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health,
Department of Defense, and the State Department. However, the
Administration's Ebola Response Coordinator, Ron Klain, was absent from
this hearing. The White House declined the Committee's request for Mr.
Klain to testify even though he is the Administration's point person on
the Ebola response. The Administration is failing to clearly articulate
the coordination among the various agencies and departments involved in
this response effort and their respective objectives, especially when
we have our service men and women on the ground in West Africa. The
stakes are high and Americans need confidence that their government is
accountable and working in their best interest.
During this hearing, I asked Director of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci for an update on the
progress made in Ebola care, treatments, and protocols since the
Committee's last Ebola hearing in September. Dr. Fauci indicated that
progress is being made in testing an Ebola vaccine for effectiveness,
and clinical trials in West Africa are expected to begin soon. While
the U.S. is currently Ebola free, heightened vigilance and preparedness
are required to address this health crisis. Click here
to watch my questioning
in this hearing.
Choice Act Must Be About
Choice
On Friday, several of my Senate colleagues joined me in calling upon
the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Bob McDonald
for a meeting in-person to make certain the VA upholds the intent of
the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 (VACAA) by
offering non-VA care to veterans who are unable to receive healthcare
services from a VA medical facility within 40 miles of where they
reside. The VA must apply the 40-mile eligibility criteria of this law
with a common sense approach that gives veterans the choice to access
non-VA healthcare services when timeliness and the burden of travel put
their health and well-being at risk. Rural Kansas veterans understand
this burden all too well and deserve to have access to care in their
hometowns, especially when a VA facility cannot provide the care they
are seeking.
Secretary McDonald's response to my questions during a Senate Veterans
Affairs Committee hearing in September demonstrated his willing to
apply the law as Congress intended, however, the VA bureaucracy
continues to be an obstacle. I am hopeful that a face-to-face meeting
will lead to real solutions to this critical problem for rural
veterans. Click here
to read the letter.
Concordia Junior/Senior High School
Returning from Washington, D.C., Friday, I traveled to Cloud County to
visit Concordia Junior/Senior High School and meet with students,
school administrators and teachers. My visits to schools throughout the
state help me stay informed on the issues impacting the education of
Kansas students. Frequently, I encounter a common theme during these
visits. Kansas schools have no problem being held accountable - they
simply ask that the federal government afford them sufficient
flexibility to tailor education plans to the unique needs of their
students. Rather than being forced to teach to a standardized test,
schools need to have the flexibility to raise the bar and focus on
preparing students for careers and additional education. As Kansas
ranchers say, "If you want fat cattle, you need to feed them, not just
weigh them." We must prepare students for the challenges of life, not
just standardized tests.
During my tour, I visited briefly with a government class and was
interviewed by 8th Grader Kennedy Chrisco and her videography class. I
was impressed with the students' questions and their interest in the
future of our country. Thanks to Concordia Junior/Senior High School
Principal Bryce Wachs for hosting my visit. I also appreciated hearing
from Assistant Superintendent Quentin Breese, Junior-Senior High
Assistant Principal/AD Brandon Rice and Middle School Principal Derek
Holmes.
Flint Hills Breadbasket Tour
Last Monday, I visited Flint Hills Breadbasket
to meet with
Executive Director Maribeth Kieffer and learn more about their mission
of minimizing hunger and poverty in the Manhattan area as a community
food network. I co-chair the Senate Hunger Caucus and understand that
hunger is so often an invisible tragedy. For 32 years, the Flint Hills
Breadbasket has been collecting and distributing food with the help of
many volunteers and churches to make certain no one in the community
goes hungry. I learned that many of the individuals receiving food are
actively trying to find employment and working to change their lives.
The churches in the Manhattan area who partner with the Breadbasket on
their respective day are listed below:
Monday-First United Methodist Church
Tuesday-Grace Baptist Church
Wednesday-First Lutheran Church
Thursday-Seven Dolors Catholic Church
Friday-First Presbyterian Church
The organization is preparing for a busy holiday season, which will
kick off with the annual Thanksgiving Basket program and the Annual
Community Thanksgiving Dinner. Last year, volunteers made and
distributed more than 200 Thanksgiving baskets to food-insecure
families. Thanks again to the entire team at the Breadbasket for the
great work you do helping individuals and families in need. Thanks
again to Maribeth Kieffer for coordinating my visit.
Riley County Kansas Listening Tour Stop
I continued my Kansas Listening Tour in Riley on Saturday morning. More
than 30 area residents met at the Riley Centre to discuss a number of
issues including veterans affairs, Fort Riley, NBAF, and the need to
keep jobs and businesses in America. I appreciated the informative
discussion and all who attended. Special thanks to Doris Fritz for
helping arrange my visit. For a list of upcoming listening tour stops,

In Memoriam
Dr. Dale Dean
On Friday, I attended a service honoring the life of Dr. Dale E. Dean.
He was my optometrist during my early years, and was a kind and special
person who cared about his patients, friends and neighbors. Dr. Dean
provided optometric services to Stockton and the surrounding
communities for nearly four decades. He also served in the United
States Army during WWII from 1942 to 1945 in the
European-African-Middle Eastern Theater. A dedicated family man who
loved spending time with his children and grandchildren, he will be
greatly missed. My thoughts and prayers are with his son Greg Dean of
Stillwater, daughters Pam Hageman and Ginger Kollman, both of Stockton,
and the many other family and friends who are mourning his passing.
Robba and I extend our deepest sympathies.
Marianna Kistler Beach
Robba and I were also saddened by the passing of longtime friend and
mentor Marianna Kistler Beach earlier this month. On Sunday, we
attended her celebration of life in Manhattan. Along with her husband,
Ross Beach, Marianna cared deeply about making a positive difference in
the lives of others. Their pivotal role in creating the Marianna
Kistler Beach Museum of Art on the Kansas State University campus, the
Beach Center for Families and Disabilities at the University of Kansas
and the Beach-Schmidt Performing Arts Center at Fort Hays State
University are only a few of the examples of their lasting legacy. One
can easily understand why Marianna was recognized with the Fort Hays
State University Distinguished Service Award, Topeka Daily Capital
"Kansas of Distinction" Award, KU Distinguished Service Citation and
KSU Alumni Medallion Award, just to name a few. Hers was a life of
service to others, and she will be greatly missed. My thoughts and
prayers are with her daughters Mary McDowell of Pt. Townsend,
Washington; Terry Edwards of Hutchinson and Jane Hipp of Jackson,
Wyoming, along with her many other family and friends. Our state and
world has lost one of its kindest and most generous individuals. It was
an honor to know Marianna.

Kansas
Common
Sense November
17,
2014
Hello,
Welcome
to
&#8220;Kansas
Common
Sense.&#8221;
Thanks
for
your
continued
interest
in
receiving
my
weekly
newsletter.
Please

your
family
and
friends
if

them.
Senate
to
Vote
on
Keystone
XL
Pipeline After
more
than
six
years
since
the
initial
permit
application
for
the
Keystone
XL
Pipeline,
the
Senate
is
expecting
to
have
its
first
binding
vote
to
approve
this
project
this
week.
On
Friday,
the
House
approved
legislation,
252-161,
for
the
ninth
time
to
authorize
construction.
I
suspect
this
is
merely
the
first
of
many
issues
to
finally
receive
the
Senate&#8217;s
attention
after
years
of
being
denied
votes.
This
vote
should
have
happened
years
ago,
and
while
I
am
pleased
it
will
finally
be
brought
to
the
Senate
floor,
President
Obama
will
likely
veto
the
measure
once
it
reaches
his
desk.
The
Keystone
XL
Pipeline
is
an
additional
phase
to
the
original
Keystone
Pipeline
that
currently
moves
crude
oil
from
Steele
City,
Nebraska,
through
Kansas
to
the
processing
facility
in
Cushing,
Oklahoma.
Portions
of
the
Keystone
XL
Pipeline
have
already
been
built
and
are
in
operation,
including
a
pipeline
linking
Cushing,
Oklahoma,
to
Port
Arthur,
Texas.
The
newest
addition
to
be
voted
on
would
link
the
existing
Keystone
infrastructure
to
the
oil-rich
Bakken
granting
greater
accessibility
to
domestic
natural
resources.
Unfortunately,
the
White
House
has
refused
to
approve
the
permit
application
for
the
remaining
1,200
miles
of
pipeline
to
be
built
despite
President
Obama&#8217;s
own
State
Department&#8217;s
view
that
this
project
can
move
forward.
The
Administration&#8217;s
delays
have
prevented
the
creation
of
new
well-paying
jobs
and
economic
growth
for
Americans.
Approving
the
Keystone
XL
pipeline
will
help
ensure
a
stable
energy
supply
for
our
nation,
and
will
also
reduce
U.S.
reliance
on
oil
from
the
Middle
East.
I
look
forward
to
supporting
this
legislation.
Monitoring
the
Ebola
Response On
Wednesday,
I
participated
in
a
Senate
Appropriations
Committee
hearing
on
the
government&#8217;s
response
to
the
Ebola
outbreak.
Testifying
at
this
hearing
were
officials
from
the
United
States
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services,
Department
of
Homeland
Security,
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention,
National
Institutes
of
Health,
Department
of
Defense,
and
the
State
Department.
However,
the
Administration&#8217;s
Ebola
Response
Coordinator,
Ron
Klain,
was
absent
from
this
hearing.
The
White
House
declined
the
Committee&#8217;s
request
for
Mr.
Klain
to
testify
even
though
he
is
the
Administration&#8217;s
point
person
on
the
Ebola
response.
The
Administration
is
failing
to
clearly
articulate
the
coordination
among
the
various
agencies
and
departments
involved
in
this
response
effort
and
their
respective
objectives,
especially
when
we
have
our
service
men
and
women
on
the
ground
in
West
Africa.
The
stakes
are
high
and
Americans
need
confidence
that
their
government
is
accountable
and
working
in
their
best
interest.
During
this
hearing,
I
asked
Director
of
the
National
Institute
of
Allergy
and
Infectious
Diseases
Dr.
Anthony
Fauci
for
an
update
on
the
progress
made
in
Ebola
care,
treatments,
and
protocols
since
the
Committee&#8217;s
last
Ebola
hearing
in
September.
Dr.
Fauci
indicated
that
progress
is
being
made
in
testing
an
Ebola
vaccine
for
effectiveness,
and
clinical
trials
in
West
Africa
are
expected
to
begin
soon.
While
the
U.S.
is
currently
Ebola
free,
heightened
vigilance
and
preparedness
are
required
to
address
this
health
crisis.

Choice
Act
Must
Be
About
Choice On
Friday,
several
of
my
Senate
colleagues
joined
me
in
calling
upon
the
Secretary
of
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
Bob
McDonald
for
a
meeting
in-person
to
make
certain
the
VA
upholds
the
intent
of
the
Veterans
Access,
Choice,
and
Accountability
Act
of
2014
(VACAA)
by
offering
non-VA
care
to
veterans
who
are
unable
to
receive
healthcare
services
from
a
VA
medical
facility
within
40
miles
of
where
they
reside.
The
VA
must
apply
the
40-mile
eligibility
criteria
of
this
law
with
a
common
sense
approach
that
gives
veterans
the
choice
to
access
non-VA
healthcare
services
when
timeliness
and
the
burden
of
travel
put
their
health
and
well-being
at
risk.
Rural
Kansas
veterans
understand
this
burden
all
too
well
and
deserve
to
have
access
to
care
in
their
hometowns,
especially
when
a
VA
facility
cannot
provide
the
care
they
are
seeking.
Secretary
McDonald&#8217;s
response
to
my
questions
during
a
Senate
Veterans
Affairs
Committee
hearing
in
September
demonstrated
his
willing
to
apply
the
law
as
Congress
intended,
however,
the
VA
bureaucracy
continues
to
be
an
obstacle.
I
am
hopeful
that
a
face-to-face
meeting
will
lead
to
real
solutions
to
this
critical
problem
for
rural
veterans.

Concordia
Junior/Senior
High
School Returning
from
Washington,
D.C.,
Friday,
I
traveled
to
Cloud
County
to
visit
Concordia
Junior/Senior
High
School
and
meet
with
students,
school
administrators
and
teachers.
My
visits
to
schools
throughout
the
state
help
me
stay
informed
on
the
issues
impacting
the
education
of
Kansas
students.
Frequently,
I
encounter
a
common
theme
during
these
visits.
Kansas
schools
have
no
problem
being
held
accountable
&#8211;
they
simply
ask
that
the
federal
government
afford
them
sufficient
flexibility
to
tailor
education
plans
to
the
unique
needs
of
their
students.
Rather
than
being
forced
to
teach
to
a
standardized
test,
schools
need
to
have
the
flexibility
to
raise
the
bar
and
focus
on
preparing
students
for
careers
and
additional
education.
As
Kansas
ranchers
say,
&#8220;If
you
want
fat
cattle,
you
need
to
feed
them,
not
just
weigh
them.&#8221;
We
must
prepare
students
for
the
challenges
of
life,
not
just
standardized
tests.
During
my
tour,
I
visited
briefly
with
a
government
class
and
was
interviewed
by
8th
Grader
Kennedy
Chrisco
and
her
videography
class.
I
was
impressed
with
the
students&#8217;
questions
and
their
interest
in
the
future
of
our
country.
Thanks
to
Concordia
Junior/Senior
High
School
Principal
Bryce
Wachs
for
hosting
my
visit.
I
also
appreciated
hearing
from
Assistant
Superintendent
Quentin
Breese,
Junior-Senior
High
Assistant
Principal/AD
Brandon
Rice
and
Middle
School
Principal
Derek
Holmes.
Flint
Hills
Breadbasket
Tour Last
Monday,
I
visited
Flint
Hills
Breadbasket
to
meet
with
Executive
Director
Maribeth
Kieffer
and
learn
more
about
their
mission
of
minimizing
hunger
and
poverty
in
the
Manhattan
area
as
a
community
food
network.
I
co-chair
the
Senate
Hunger
Caucus
and
understand
that
hunger
is
so
often
an
invisible
tragedy.
For
32
years,
the
Flint
Hills
Breadbasket
has
been
collecting
and
distributing
food
with
the
help
of
many
volunteers
and
churches
to
make
certain
no
one
in
the
community
goes
hungry.
I
learned
that
many
of
the
individuals
receiving
food
are
actively
trying
to
find
employment
and
working
to
change
their
lives.
The
churches
in
the
Manhattan
area
who
partner
with
the
Breadbasket
on
their
respective
day
are
listed
below:
Monday&#8212;First
United
Methodist
Church Tuesday&#8212;Grace
Baptist
Church Wednesday&#8212;First
Lutheran
Church Thursday&#8212;Seven
Dolors
Catholic
Church Friday&#8212;First
Presbyterian
Church
The
organization
is
preparing
for
a
busy
holiday
season,
which
will
kick
off
with
the
annual
Thanksgiving
Basket
program
and
the
Annual
Community
Thanksgiving
Dinner.
Last
year,
volunteers
made
and
distributed
more
than
200
Thanksgiving
baskets
to
food-insecure
families.
Thanks
again
to
the
entire
team
at
the
Breadbasket
for
the
great
work
you
do
helping
individuals
and
families
in
need.
Thanks
again
to
Maribeth
Kieffer
for
coordinating
my
visit.

In
Memoriam Dr.
Dale
Dean On
Friday,
I
attended
a
service
honoring
the
life
of
Dr.
Dale
E.
Dean.
He
was
my
optometrist
during
my
early
years,
and
was
a
kind
and
special
person
who
cared
about
his
patients,
friends
and
neighbors.
Dr.
Dean
provided
optometric
services
to
Stockton
and
the
surrounding
communities
for
nearly
four
decades.
He
also
served
in
the
United
States
Army
during
WWII
from
1942
to
1945
in
the
European-African-Middle
Eastern
Theater.
A
dedicated
family
man
who
loved
spending
time
with
his
children
and
grandchildren,
he
will
be
greatly
missed.
My
thoughts
and
prayers
are
with
his
son
Greg
Dean
of
Stillwater,
daughters
Pam
Hageman
and
Ginger
Kollman,
both
of
Stockton,
and
the
many
other
family
and
friends
who
are
mourning
his
passing.
Robba
and
I
extend
our
deepest
sympathies.
Marianna
Kistler
Beach Robba
and
I
were
also
saddened
by
the
passing
of
longtime
friend
and
mentor
Marianna
Kistler
Beach
earlier
this
month.
On
Sunday,
we
attended
her
celebration
of
life
in
Manhattan.
Along
with
her
husband,
Ross
Beach,
Marianna
cared
deeply
about
making
a
positive
difference
in
the
lives
of
others.
Their
pivotal
role
in
creating
the
Marianna
Kistler
Beach
Museum
of
Art
on
the
Kansas
State
University
campus,
the
Beach
Center
for
Families
and
Disabilities
at
the
University
of
Kansas
and
the
Beach-Schmidt
Performing
Arts
Center
at
Fort
Hays
State
University
are
only
a
few
of
the
examples
of
their
lasting
legacy.
One
can
easily
understand
why
Marianna
was
recognized
with
the
Fort
Hays
State
University
Distinguished
Service
Award,
Topeka
Daily
Capital
&#8220;Kansas
of
Distinction&#8221;
Award,
KU
Distinguished
Service
Citation
and
KSU
Alumni
Medallion
Award,
just
to
name
a
few.
Hers
was
a
life
of
service
to
others,
and
she
will
be
greatly
missed.
My
thoughts
and
prayers
are
with
her
daughters
Mary
McDowell
of
Pt.
Townsend,
Washington;
Terry
Edwards
of
Hutchinson
and
Jane
Hipp
of
Jackson,
Wyoming,
along
with
her
many
other
family
and
friends.
Our
state
and
world
has
lost
one
of
its
kindest
and
most
generous
individuals.
It
was
an
honor
to
know
Marianna.
