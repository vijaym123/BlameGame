The Scalise Capitol Report
Fighting the president's illegal amnesty
Two weeks ago, I helped pass a bill by Congressman Yoho (R-FL) to block President Obama's attempt at illegal amnesty. In addition, this past week we passed a
2015 Appropriations Bill
which includes a clause that sets up a battle in just four weeks with the president on immigration when we finally get the reinforcements of a Republican Senate. This bill also brings discretionary spending to its lowest spending levels in nearly a decade, and cuts the funding of agencies like the IRS, EPA, and other radical proposals by Obama.
When the new Republican Senate is sworn in early January, we will move legislation to Barack Obama's desk that blocks any funding to implement his attempt at executive amnesty. The
new American Congress will hold the president accountable
for his lawless, unconstitutional executive action on immigration. We will also be putting bills on his desk to repeal and replace Obamacare, cut wasteful Washington spending, lower tax rates to get our economy moving again, and approve important energy projects like Keystone XL. Know that in January, Congress, with a Republican majority in the House and Senate, will be in the strongest position to fight this president's attempts at executive overreach.

Protecting Americans from terrorism risks
When the House moved with
overwhelming bipartisan support
to reauthorize the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) last week, we also employed reforms that will better protect American taxpayers and businesses from exposure to these risks. These critical reforms will provide American businesses with the long-term certainty they need to expand and create new jobs. The TRIA bill also includes a hard-fought measure to finally start chipping away at the destructive Dodd-Frank law passes in 2009. Now that the House has acted, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to do the same before TRIA expires at the end of the year.
Fighting for long-term flood insurance reform
I am a tireless advocate for comprehensive hurricane protection in southeast Louisiana. Increased flood protection provides peace of mind for Louisiana families and brings homeowners much-needed relief by lowering flood insurance premiums. I had the opportunity to visit with Slidell Mayor Freddy Drennan in my office in Washington last week to discuss the importance of comprehensive hurricane protection in eastern St. Tammany Parish and throughout southeast Louisiana. We discussed ways we can collaborate at the state, local, and federal level to ensure the safety and quality of life in our beloved state continues to increase. I am grateful for his service to the good people in Slidell and proud to call him my friend.
It is an honor to represent you in Congress. For more information please visit my
