BREAKING: President Obama just slammed Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s threat to sue the White House.
We couldn&rsquo;t agree more. But we never expected so many of you to fight back against Boehner&rsquo;s lawsuit!
That&rsquo;s right -- now we&rsquo;re in range of hitting 200,000 donations since Boehner announced that he&rsquo;s suing President Obama.
If we can get there today -- while House Republicans are holding Congressional hearings launching their lawsuit -- that would be a MAJOR endorsement of President Obama&rsquo;s agenda. (AND a HUMILIATING setback for Boehner&rsquo;s big lawsuit).
