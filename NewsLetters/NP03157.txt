Congressman
Lamborn Supports the Fight Against Human
Trafficking
1/27/15
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn
supported eight different pieces of legislation designed to combat Human
Trafficking.
"Human
Trafficking is a reprehensible practice that is happening all over the
world, including right here in America. Billions of dollars are
exchanged in the abuse of hundreds of thousands of children. This form of
modern slavery must stop. The bills I supported today are designed to
combat this problem on every level. From increasing the tools available
to law enforcement, to training people on how to detect victims, to
helping survivors recover from their ordeal, these steps are important
to protecting those impacted by this terrible
tragedy."

(CO-05)
