Financial Literacy Month
April is National Financial Literacy Month and as co-chair of the House Financial and Economic Literacy Caucus, this issue is especially important to me.
We must ensure Americans have the knowledge to make sound decisions for a financially secure future.
If you are interested in learning more about finances there are many great resources available such as the U.S. Treasury Departments resource center, which can be found at
www.treasury.gov .
Also,
FinancialLiteracyMonth.com , which has helpful tools like:
Free Webinars
Income Worksheet
Record of Daily Expenditures
Completing these simple steps can help you and your family more easily manage your finances and plan for the future.
As always, I look forward to hearing from you on federal issues facing our nation and I appreciate the opportunity to serve Ohios 15th Congressional District.
I invite you to call my Washington D.C. Office at (202) 225-2015, Hilliard Office at (614) 771-4968, Lancaster Office at (740) 654-2654, or Wilmington Office at (937) 283-7049 to share your thoughts with me.
