Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thanks for your continued interest in

your family and friends if it would interest them.
Addressing the Ebola Crisis
Discussing Ebola Response and Preparedness at KU Hospital
This week, an individual called The University of Kansas Hospital
reporting symptoms of Ebola. Because the patient had recently worked on
a medical boat off the west coast of Africa, he was immediately
isolated on a special infectious disease unit and underwent tests.
Hospital staff met the patient wearing personal protection equipment
and followed the hospital's plan for this kind of illness. While there
were many other diseases that fit the patient's symptoms, the hospital
followed all appropriate precautions for infectious disease. On
Tuesday, KU Hospital reported that lab results showed the isolated
patient does not have Ebola and that the patient is showing
improvement. I contacted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) to request that the agency expedite the confirmatory test that
definitively ruled out any possibility of Ebola Virus Disease in this
patient.
On Thursday, I traveled to Kansas City to visit KU Hospital to learn
more about these developments and how to properly evaluate, isolate and
care for patients who present at a hospital with concerns of Ebola.
During this visit, I received a demonstration on how nurses and
physicians properly utilized personal protective equipment and safety
protocols, as well as the hospital's process for caring for patients
who may present with Ebola symptoms. It was great to see that these
providers and other KU Hospital staff performed so well under difficult
circumstances. I was glad I was able to thank them for doing their job
so well. I also wanted to learn how I may be of assistance to providers
across our state to prepare for Ebola and other infectious disease
responses. As Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Health
Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over funding for the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), I want to make sure that
resources are being allocated in a way that supports these efforts in
Kansas. On Thursday, I had a conference call with Dr. Robert Moser,
Secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, and Major
General Lee Tafanelli, Adjutant General of Kansas, regarding these
important topics. Thank you to KU Hospital President and CEO Bob Page,
Chief Medical Officer Dr. Lee Norman, and their team for hosting my
visit. Click here

video on my visit to the hospital.
Requesting
an Ebola Hearing in the Senate
Last month, I participated in a Senate hearing on the response to the
Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Things have changed significantly since
that hearing occurred, and the Senate needs to do its job to consider
strategies for improving coordination and vigilance to address this
health crisis. We were told by the Senate Appropriations Committee that
a Senate hearing on Ebola would not take place until after the
election. While I believe a hearing should not be delayed to make
certain there is the appropriate funding to work to solve this crisis
as well as an effective organizational structure that can coordinate a
response, I look forward to participating in the full Senate
Appropriations Committee Hearing on November 6.
Calling on the Administration to Implement Travel Restrictions
The single most important thing that can be done to protect Americans
is to stop Ebola at the outbreak's source in West Africa. But, as we
fight Ebola in Africa, we need to make certain we are protected at home
as well. I urge the Administration to implement travel restrictions on
commercial airline passengers traveling from nations afflicted by
Ebola. While Americans were assured that our public health
infrastructure was ready to handle Ebola, unfortunately reality has
shown we still have a lot of work to do. Travel restrictions will also
give us time to make certain our hospitals are procedurally ready to
handle Ebola patients. And, coordination with the proper agencies to
make certain that medical personnel and supplies can still come in and
out of West Africa is critical. I also recently called on the CDC to
implement Ebola-specific screenings at U.S. airports. The
Administration is now implementing enhanced screening measures at
certain high-traffic U.S. airports. Given Ebola's long incubation
period, entry screenings are not the full solution, but they could be
helpful.
Administration Appoints Ebola Response Coordinator
On Friday, President Obama selected Ron Klain to serve as the
Administration's Ebola Response Coordinator. Mr. Klain is former chief
of staff to Vice President Biden and Vice President Gore, and a
longtime political operative to Democratic campaigns. Without the right
person in charge, I am concerned the President's appointment of a
political operative will only add to the bureaucratic inefficiencies
that have plagued Ebola response efforts thus far. He must be able to
cut through red tape and make unbiased decisions across multiple
agencies - the buck has to stop with him. Unfortunately, the White
House is treating this critical role like an appointment to be the
"Green-Jobs Czar" or the "Great Lakes Czar" - political operatives with
titles - not handling it with the seriousness it deserves. This is a
real crisis and worthy of an individual with extensive background in
international diplomacy, public health, experience coordinating
large-scale interagency missions, as well as a proven ability to work
with Congress and across the aisle. The stakes are high and Americans
need confidence that their government is working in their best interest.
Service Academy Interview Day
On Saturday, I had the honor of meeting more than 60 students from
Kansas at the Dwight D. Eisenhower Library in Abilene as part of my
annual Service Academy Selection Day. Students applying for admission
to the U.S. Military Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Air Force
Academy and U.S. Merchant Marine Academy interviewed with my Selection
Board, and the Board provided me with recommendations regarding
nominations. This day has always been a favorite of mine because I get
to meet some of the best and brightest of Kansas. It also served as a
reminder that Kansas produces smart, hard-working, civic-minded people
who want to serve their country.
Big thanks to Michelle Kopefer at the Dwight D. Eisenhower Library for
hosting us. And, this important process would not be possible without
the help of my selection board, made up of community leaders from
across the state who take great interest in seeing students succeed.
The members review applications and conduct interviews before giving me
their recommendations. Members of the 2014 Service Academy Selection
Board include: Maceo Braxton of Salina; Karen DeGraaf of Mulvane; Anne
Emerson of Fort Scott; Major Nicholas Falcetto of Fort Riley; Ron
Whitney and Steve Harmon of Emporia; Ron Lucas of Goodland; Paula
Ripple of Dodge City; Jill McCarthy and Ernie Garcia of Overland Park;
Steve Hawley of Lawrence; Robin Jackson of Hutchinson; Ryan
Kriegshauser of Topeka; Katrina Lewison and Janet Nichols of Manhattan;
Wendell Maddox of Kansas City; Lynne Murray of Baldwin City; Jayne
Pearce of Wallace; Matt Treaster of Newton and Sam Turner of Leawood. I
would also like to thank 2nd Lt. Taylor Pearce, a recent graduate of
the U.S. Air Force Academy, for traveling to Abilene to visit with this
year's applicants, and his dad Cecil Pearce of Wallace for providing a
parent's perspective of having a child at an academy.
Hiawatha Community Hospital Visit
On Thursday, I was in Brown County to visit Hiawatha Community
Hospital (HCH).
HCH, a 25-bed Critical Access Hospital (CAH), has been
serving the health care needs of the community since 1951. The hospital
offers a wide range of health care services and operates two health
clinics - the Heartland Health Clinic of Hiawatha and the HCH Highland
Clinic in Highland.
I have had the opportunity to visit each of the 128 community
hospitals in Kansas, and I learn something new at each visit. My
discussion with HCH administrators and staff spanned a variety of
topics including unreasonable physician supervision regulations
threatening hospitals' ability to provide routine outpatient therapy
services to patients, inflexible Medicare patient admission criteria,
and unnecessarily burdensome and flawed Medicare audit regulations that
divert resources away from patient care. Thanks to HCH CEO John Moore
for hosting my visit. I also spoke with Dr. Crosby Gernon, a local
radiologist who is also the Mayor of Hiawatha. At hospitals across our
state, there are so many people involved in making certain patients are
cared for - just like Debbie Hunsaker (pictured below).
Kansas Listening Tour Stops Continue
This week, I hosted town hall meetings in Northeast Kansas including
Nemaha and Doniphan Counties. Thanks to all the area residents who came
out to share their feedback on how to improve Kansas and the nation.
For a full listing of my upcoming Kansas Listening Tour stops, visit my
website
.
Nemaha County
On Thursday, I hosted a town hall meeting at Sabetha Middle School. I
appreciated the more than 20 folks who came out to discuss how to
preserve our special way of life in Kansas. I appreciate Sabetha Middle
School Principal Tom Palmer for hosting the meeting.
Doniphan County
On Friday, I visited with folks at Highland Community College. Our
conversation focused on concerns with federal mandates and
overregulation, as well as the importance of preserving rural Kansas.
Thanks to Highland Community College President David Reist for
attending and hosting the town hall meeting.
Now Accepting Spring 2015 Internship Applications
I am now accepting applications for paid congressional internships in
my Washington, D.C., and Kansas offices for spring 2015. An internship
in my office - either legislative or communications - provides a unique
opportunity to work closely with Senate staff on behalf of the state of
Kansas. Legislative interns will gain a better understanding of the
legislative process in the U.S. Congress, and develop knowledge and
professional skills valuable to future career pursuits. Communications
internships offer an intern the chance to learn about how political
communications and the legislative process intersect, and gain
practical knowledge about the inner workings of a fast-paced press
office.
The application deadline for spring 2015 is November 1, 2014.
Applications may be obtained and completed under the "Services" section
of my website at www.moran.senate.gov
. Applicants should submit a completed application form, resume,
academic transcript, two letters of recommendation, and a cover letter
explaining their interest in public service and addressing a policy
issue of personal importance and a suggested recommendation to resolve
that issue. Please submit required materials to:
internships@moran.senate.gov.
Kansas City Royals to the World Series
On Wednesday, Kansas City Royals fans awoke to realize the World
Series is not just a dream, but will actually be played at The K on
Tuesday night. My wife Robba was at the games in '85 and we'll be
cheering on the Royals again this time as they seek to bring the world
championship back to Kansas City. Let's go, Royals!

Addressing
the
Ebola
Crisis
Discussing
Ebola
Response
and
Preparedness
at
KU
Hospital
This
week,
an
individual
called
The
University
of
Kansas
Hospital
reporting
symptoms
of
Ebola.
Because
the
patient
had
recently
worked
on
a
medical
boat
off
the
west
coast
of
Africa,
he
was
immediately
isolated
on
a
special
infectious
disease
unit
and
underwent
tests.
Hospital
staff
met
the
patient
wearing
personal
protection
equipment
and
followed
the
hospital's
plan
for
this
kind
of
illness.
While
there
were
many
other
diseases
that
fit
the
patient's
symptoms,
the
hospital
followed
all
appropriate
precautions
for
infectious
disease.
On
Tuesday,
KU
Hospital
reported
that
lab
results
showed
the
isolated
patient
does
not
have
Ebola
and
that
the
patient
is
showing
improvement.
I
contacted
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
(CDC)
to
request
that
the
agency
expedite
the
confirmatory
test
that
definitively
ruled
out
any
possibility
of
Ebola
Virus
Disease
in
this
patient.
On
Thursday,
I
traveled
to
Kansas
City
to
visit
KU
Hospital
to
learn
more
about
these
developments
and
how
to
properly
evaluate,
isolate
and
care
for
patients
who
present
at
a
hospital
with
concerns
of
Ebola.
During
this
visit,
I
received
a
demonstration
on
how
nurses
and
physicians
properly
utilized
personal
protective
equipment
and
safety
protocols,
as
well
as
the
hospital's
process
for
caring
for
patients
who
may
present
with
Ebola
symptoms.
It
was
great
to
see
that
these
providers
and
other
KU
Hospital
staff
performed
so
well
under
difficult
circumstances.
I
was
glad
I
was
able
to
thank
them
for
doing
their
job
so
well.
I
also
wanted
to
learn
how
I
may
be
of
assistance
to
providers
across
our
state
to
prepare
for
Ebola
and
other
infectious
disease
responses.
As
Ranking
Member
of
the
Senate
Appropriations
Health
Subcommittee,
which
has
jurisdiction
over
funding
for
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
(CDC),
I
want
to
make
sure
that
resources
are
being
allocated
in
a
way
that
supports
these
efforts
in
Kansas.
On
Thursday,
I
had
a
conference
call
with
Dr.
Robert
Moser,
Secretary
of
the
Kansas
Department
of
Health
and
Environment,
and
Major
General
Lee
Tafanelli,
Adjutant
General
of
Kansas,
regarding
these
important
topics.
Thank
you
to
KU
Hospital
President
and
CEO
Bob
Page,
Chief
Medical
Officer
Dr.
Lee
Norman,
and
their
team
for
hosting
my
visit.

Requesting
an
Ebola
Hearing
in
the
Senate
Last
month,
I
participated
in
a
Senate
hearing
on
the
response
to
the
Ebola
outbreak
in
West
Africa.
Things
have
changed
significantly
since
that
hearing
occurred,
and
the
Senate
needs
to
do
its
job
to
consider
strategies
for
improving
coordination
and
vigilance
to
address
this
health
crisis.
We
were
told
by
the
Senate
Appropriations
Committee
that
a
Senate
hearing
on
Ebola
would
not
take
place
until
after
the
election.
While
I
believe
a
hearing
should
not
be
delayed
to
make
certain
there
is
the
appropriate
funding
to
work
to
solve
this
crisis
as
well
as
an
effective
organizational
structure
that
can
coordinate
a
response,
I
look
forward
to
participating
in
the
full
Senate
Appropriations
Committee
Hearing
on
November
6.
Calling
on
the
Administration
to
Implement
Travel
Restrictions
The
single
most
important
thing
that
can
be
done
to
protect
Americans
is
to
stop
Ebola
at
the
outbreak's
source
in
West
Africa.
But,
as
we
fight
Ebola
in
Africa,
we
need
to
make
certain
we
are
protected
at
home
as
well.
I
urge
the
Administration
to
implement
travel
restrictions
on
commercial
airline
passengers
traveling
from
nations
afflicted
by
Ebola.
While
Americans
were
assured
that
our
public
health
infrastructure
was
ready
to
handle
Ebola,
unfortunately
reality
has
shown
we
still
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do.
Travel
restrictions
will
also
give
us
time
to
make
certain
our
hospitals
are
procedurally
ready
to
handle
Ebola
patients.
And,
coordination
with
the
proper
agencies
to
make
certain
that
medical
personnel
and
supplies
can
still
come
in
and
out
of
West
Africa
is
critical.
I
also
recently
called
on
the
CDC
to
implement
Ebola-specific
screenings
at
U.S.
airports.
The
Administration
is
now
implementing
enhanced
screening
measures
at
certain
high-traffic
U.S.
airports.
Given
Ebola's
long
incubation
period,
entry
screenings
are
not
the
full
solution,
but
they
could
be
helpful.
Administration
Appoints
Ebola
Response
Coordinator
On
Friday,
President
Obama
selected
Ron
Klain
to
serve
as
the
Administration's
Ebola
Response
Coordinator.
Mr.
Klain
is
former
chief
of
staff
to
Vice
President
Biden
and
Vice
President
Gore,
and
a
longtime
political
operative
to
Democratic
campaigns.
Without
the
right
person
in
charge,
I
am
concerned
the
President's
appointment
of
a
political
operative
will
only
add
to
the
bureaucratic
inefficiencies
that
have
plagued
Ebola
response
efforts
thus
far.
He
must
be
able
to
cut
through
red
tape
and
make
unbiased
decisions
across
multiple
agencies
&ndash;
the
buck
has
to
stop
with
him.
Unfortunately,
the
White
House
is
treating
this
critical
role
like
an
appointment
to
be
the
"Green-Jobs
Czar"
or
the
"Great
Lakes
Czar"
&ndash;
political
operatives
with
titles
&ndash;
not
handling
it
with
the
seriousness
it
deserves.
This
is
a
real
crisis
and
worthy
of
an
individual
with
extensive
background
in
international
diplomacy,
public
health,
experience
coordinating
large-scale
interagency
missions,
as
well
as
a
proven
ability
to
work
with
Congress
and
across
the
aisle.
The
stakes
are
high
and
Americans
need
confidence
that
their
government
is
working
in
their
best
interest.
Service
Academy
Interview
Day
On
Saturday,
I
had
the
honor
of
meeting
more
than
60
students
from
Kansas
at
the
Dwight
D.
Eisenhower
Library
in
Abilene
as
part
of
my
annual
Service
Academy
Selection
Day.
Students
applying

Academy,
U.S.
Naval
Academy,
U.S.

Academy
and
U.S.
Merchant
Marine
Academy
interviewed
with
my
Selection
Board,
and
the
Board
provided
me
with
recommendations
regarding
nominations.
This
day
has
always
been
a
favorite
of
mine
because
I
get
to
meet
some
of
the
best
and
brightest
of
Kansas.
It
also
served
as
a
reminder
that
Kansas
produces
smart,
hard-working,

people
who
want
to
serve
their
country.
Big
thanks
to
Michelle
Kopefer
at
the
Dwight

Eisenhower
Library
for
hosting
us.
And,
this
important
process
would
not
be
possible
without
the
help
of
my
selection
board,
made
up
of
community
leaders
from
across
the
state
who
take
great
interest
in
seeing
students
succeed.
The

Hiawatha
Community
Hospital
Visit
On
Thursday,
I
was
in
Brown
County
to
visit
Hiawatha
Community
Hospital
(HCH).
HCH,
a
25-bed
Critical
Access
Hospital
(CAH),
has
been
serving
the
health
care
needs
of
the
community
since
1951.
The
hospital
offers
a
wide
range
of
health
care
services
and
operates
two
health
clinics
&ndash;
the
Heartland
Health
Clinic
of
Hiawatha
and
the
HCH
Highland
Clinic
in
Highland.
I
have
had
the
opportunity
to
visit
each
of
the
128
community
hospitals
in
Kansas,
and
I
learn
something
new
at
each
visit.
My
discussion
with
HCH
administrators
and
staff
spanned
a
variety
of
topics
including
unreasonable
physician
supervision
regulations
threatening
hospitals'
ability
to
provide
routine
outpatient
therapy
services
to
patients,
inflexible
Medicare
patient
admission
criteria,
and
unnecessarily
burdensome
and
flawed
Medicare
audit
regulations
that
divert
resources
away
from
patient
care.
Thanks
to
HCH
CEO
John
Moore
for
hosting
my
visit.
I
also
spoke
with
Dr.
Crosby
Gernon,
a
local
radiologist
who
is
also
