Dear Friends:
In the week that we celebrate
American Independence, how fortunate we are to be citizens of the United
States. In this same week in the Middle East, an Islamist terrorist
state has been declared and Israeli students murdered.
Central
Americans are smuggling their children across the border, death continues
in the Ukraine and there is chaos in many of the African nations.
Even with our challenges at home, every American must pause and be
grateful for our One Nation under God established July 4,
1776!
Sincerely,
John L. Mica
