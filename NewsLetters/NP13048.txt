Rep. Bruce Braley -- Iowa's First
District
David,
I've known since I was a kid growing up in Brooklyn, Iowa what farming
means to our state.
And I've been proud to see our farming community lead the nation in the
development of renewable energy through the Renewable Fuel Standard
(RFS). Unfortunately, if the EPA gets their way, this vital industry
will be rolled back, costing Iowa thousands of jobs and millions of
dollars.
After repeatedly contacting the EPA to advocate on behalf of Iowa in
favor of the RFS, I'm happy to announce that I'll be meeting with EPA
Administrator Gina McCarthy tomorrow to hear directly from her on the
issue.
But I need your help as I prepare for that meeting.
Click here to tell me what questions you'd like me to pose to the EPA's
top official.
I've always seen it as one of my top responsibilities to bring some
common-sense Iowa solutions to our nation's problems, and nowhere has
that been more important than in fighting for the RFS -- a policy that
has strengthened Iowa's economy and bolstered our national security.
I look forward to hearing from you.
All the best,
Bruce
