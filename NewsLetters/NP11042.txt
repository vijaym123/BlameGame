Dear Fellow New Mexican,
The health care enrollment deadline is around the corner, and many New Mexicans are eligible for free or low-cost health care coverage. The deadline to enroll has been extended, but you still need to begin the application process by March 31, 2014.
Below is updated information about the enrollment process.
In order to avoid paying a fine, you must
begin your enrollment by March 31, 2014.
After starting your application by March 31, 2014, you will have until April 15, 2014 to complete your application and an additional 60 days to choose your coverage and complete your enrollment.
The following resources can help you and your family get covered. I signed up through the Health Insurance Exchange, and you can too.
