Dear
Friend,
Last week I continued my efforts
to hold Washington officials accountable to hardworking taxpayers.
From questioning the VA Secretary for the care our veterans receive to
investigating the IRS scandal and the situation on our southern border,
I will continue making sure we get answers on these important
matters.
Below is an overview of some of the work Im doing on
your behalf. To learn more about what I have been working on, please

my website ,

Sincerely,
Congressman Pat
Meehan
Philadelphia VA Hospital
On Monday, Congressman
Jon Runyan and I had the opportunity to sit down with acting VA
Secretary Sloan Gibson to seek answers from him about the misconduct that has
been uncovered at VA facilities across the country. The meeting was
part of my ongoing effort to hold VA officials accountable and improve
care for our veterans.
I had a chance to speak with
the media after the
event.
Oversight of the IRS
On Tuesday, the Committee on Oversight and
Government Reform held a hearing to investigate the missing emails
from IRS Commissioner Lois Lerner.
National Review has an overview of my
questioning .
