Dear
Friend,
This week, I held the Administrations feet to the fire on illegal
immigration and the FCCs ruling on net neutrality.
I helped
lead two hearings held by the House Committee on Oversight and Government
Reform entitled FCC:
Process and Transparency, and The
Fiscal Costs of the Presidents Executive Actions on
Immigration.
In the FCC hearing, I made it very clear that FCC Chairman Wheeler
was against his proposal to regulate the internet before he was for
it. Its clear his commission was heading in a different direction
until he met with the Presidents Chief Economic Advisor.

Later in the week, in a hearing with
Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officials, I exposed the
Administrations deliberate misreporting of deportation statistics and their
release of violent criminals in this country illegally onto our
streets.
