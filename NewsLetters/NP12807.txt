Dear
Friends,
Welcome to the latest edition of my
e-newsletter.
State of the
Union: Country Faces Serious Challenges
Ahead
To watch the video, click

The last five years have left
us with trillions of dollars in increased spending, higher taxes,
burdensome regulations and a president who now threatens to achieve his
goals unilaterally with a pen and a phone.
Unfortunately, the
presidents State of the Unionaddress completely ignored what has been
called the greatest threat to our national security for yearsour
staggering national debt.
Now at an overwhelming $17 trillion, this
level of debt is irresponsible, unacceptable, and quite frankly,
dangerous.
If we are ever to gain control of our nations spending
excesses and out-of-control spiral toward insolvency, Congress and the
administration must take steps
now
to reform our unsustainable
entitlement programs and broken tax code.
To learn more
about my broader vision for tax reform,
read
the letter
I previously sent to the U.S. Senate
Finance Committee Chairman outlining some basic principles to eliminate the
current codes shortcomings, inefficiencies and
waste.
As expected, we did not hear much on how the president
intends to address the many failures of his signature piece of legislation,
the Affordable Care Act, orObamacare.
The rising costs of health
care under this law, coupled with the aging population, will cause
deficits to continue to significantly balloon in the coming years,
worsening our already deteriorating fiscal outlook.
Obamacare has
proven itself unworkable, has increased taxes on nearly every American
and will add over $700 billion to the deficit.
Obamacare has
pushed millions of Americans, including thousands of Idahoans, from their
health insurance plans and preferred doctors, increased out-of-pocket
expenses, cut Medicare services and undermined the employer-based
health insurance market that so many families rely
upon.
To learn more about my vision for what successful health care reform
would look like,
read my
editorial
published last month on the topic.
Areas exist
where we can work together to create jobs, improve our economic
outlook, reduce the national debt and find fixes for our broken health care
system.
My focus will continue to remain on working with my
colleagues to enact real reforms to solve the nations debt crisis and
repeal and replacethe damaged health care lawwith actual reforms to put
the United States on a more sustainable and prosperous path for
current and future generations.

Presidents Climate Action Plan
Flawed
To watch the video, click
here , or the image above
Earlier
this month, I participated in a Senate Environment and Public Works
Committee hearing entitled, Review of the Presidents Climate Action
Plan.
The hearing examined the presidents plan, which,
according to the administration strives to encourage adaptation to expected
climate change.
In the plan, the president lays out a series of
measures to cut carbon pollution; prepare the U.S. for the impacts of
climate change; and lead international efforts to address global climate
change.
I agree on the need for continued research in the
field of climate science in order to gain the necessary knowledge
needed to implement effective policies dealing with the globes
changing temperatures. Protecting and improving our natural environment is
a goal shared by many, but there is strong disagreement on how to
accomplish these goals.
The recent proposals from the president,
however, will have severe economic consequences without measurable
environmental benefits if fully implemented.
Further, they would
undermine the utilization of our own traditional, affordable sources of
energy and increase the cost of electricity for consumers.

Hot Topics
Fellow
Idaho Senator Jim Risch and I are co-sponsoring the
Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2014 .
This legislation seeks to expand gun rights of law-abiding citizens in
states like Idaho by allowing an individual permitted or entitled by
their state of residence to carry a concealed firearm the right to
maintain that concealed carry in any other state that allows or does not
prohibit the practice.

I recently joined Senator Jim Risch in voting against
H.R. 3547, the Omnibus Appropriations
Bill .
Washington has been fiscally irresponsible for far too long and
unfortunately this bill, which passed the Senate by a vote of 72-26,
continues this practice.
During consideration of the bill,
members were prevented from offering improvements to the
appropriations package through an open amendment process.
For the people of
Idaho, that means an expiration of the Payments in Lieu of Taxes
Program (PILT) that helps offset the burden of large federal land
ownership.
Idahos rural communities will be severely impacted without
these funds, struggling to provide basic services such as emergency
medical and fire response and law enforcement.

On March 21, Senator Jim Risch and I will
have the opportunity to host Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) on a
tour of the Idaho National Laboratory.
Senator Murkowski is the
Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committeethe key Senate committee with oversight and legislative
responsibilities for nuclear fuels research and development.
