In State of
the Union, the President Misses an
Opportunity for Bipartisan
Solutions
Dear Friend,
Last Tuesday, the President came to the
Capitol to speak to Congress and the
American people about his priorities for
our nation. While I appreciate the
Presidents recognition in
Tuesdays address that much more
needs to be done to create jobs and
opportunities for hardworking families, I
have serious concerns with much of his
approach for achieving these goals.
Though the President seemed pleased with
the current state of our economy that is
not what I hear from Virginians as I travel
across the Fifth District. Far too many
Virginians remain out of work and many more
are forced to settle for working only
part-time. Working families are still
struggling with stagnant wages and rising
health insurance premiums. Small businesses
and family farms labor under the increasing
burden of federal regulations, impeding
their ability to invest in their
communities and create jobs. And parents
are gravely concerned about the impact of
our national debt on their childrens
futures
a debt which now totals
more than a staggering $18 trillion,
translating to more than $56,000 in debt
for every American citizen.
Before the November elections, the
President claimed that his policies were on
the ballot. The American people responded
with a loud and clear message that they do
not want more of the same policies that
have held us back from a full economic
recovery. They want and need the federal
government removed as a barrier to job
creation instead of imposing even more
burdensome regulations. They want the
President to work with the new Congress to
implement policies that will provide even
greater opportunities for future
generations to prosper.
Unfortunately, this is not what the
American people heard on Tuesday night. The
President discussed raising more taxes and
spending more money, without even
mentioning the national debt once during
his State of the Union Address. He doubled
down on many of his policies that millions
of Americans rejected in November and
missed an opportunity to forge common
ground with Congress. The President even
set
a new record for the number of veto
threats
in an address to Congress,
further demonstrating his unwillingness to
meet us at the negotiating table.
The American people expect the House,
the Senate, and the President to work
together to find solutions to the great
challenges our nation faces. They also want
the President to respect the bounds of his
power and operate within the framework
established by our Constitution. We in the
House of Representatives will continue to
advance bipartisan solutions, but we cannot
implement the real solutions our nation
desperately needs alone.
It is my hope that the President will
work with us, rather than around us, and
join us in listening to the American
people. I look forward to finding common
ground on these important issues as we work
to encourage success for all Americans so
that they can realize the American dream
for themselves and future generations.
