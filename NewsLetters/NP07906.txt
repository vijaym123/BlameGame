Friend,
We have some exciting news -
we&#39;re launching an app!
It&#39;s no Candy Crush, but we&#39;re proud of it just the same.
Here&#39;s some of what the app provides:
- Breaking news alerts
- First look at our new campaign commercials and videos
- Behind the scenes photos
- Information on how, when, and where to volunteer
- A convenient donation button, courtesy of our finance team (they told me I had to include that)
You&#39;ll be able to download the app for free -
but in order to pay for the cost of development and the upkeep of the app, we need your help. We&#39;re crowdfunding one of the first ever campaign mobile apps.
Our app is changing the way we communicate with volunteers and supporters -- and we&#39;ve found an equally innovative way to generate support for it.
Here&#39;s what crowdfunding means
- we set a goal and ask our supporters to pledge a donation towards that goal. The donation becomes live only if we hit our &quot;tilt&quot; goal-- either we&#39;re all in it together, or it doesn&#39;t happen. This is a groundbreaking way for the Bera for Congress community to make this app a reality.
Click here to learn more and to pledge your $5 (or more!).
Our app is changing the way our community stays involved with our campaign - and it could help give us the edge in our ground game. This project is revolutionary, and getting it off the ground is entirely up to you. Your help today can keep it live through the election - even $5 makes a difference.
Give towards our CrowdTilt campaign and help us tilt over our goal!
Thanks for your amazing support - we&#39;ll be in touch soon with more information about this exciting new project.
Best,
Danny Kazin
Campaign Manager, Bera for Congress
PS - Ami was so excited about our ability to communicate with the Bera for Congress community in this way, he donated the first $5 to get us started. Click here to join him and help tilt us over the edge to keep the app up and running.
