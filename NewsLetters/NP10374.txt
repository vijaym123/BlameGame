Dear Friend,
This week, two members of President Obama's Cabinet joined me in
Memphis, the Grizzlies took control of their playoff series against
Oklahoma City, I announced an $8 million contract to help St. Jude, and
I congratulated four impressive young Memphians who will attend U.S.
Military Service Academies this fall. Keep reading to learn more.

Promoting Memphis to the President's Administration
This afternoon, I welcomed two members of President Obama's Cabinet-
Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx and Administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency Gina McCarthy-to Memphis and helped
highlight how federal support through the Partnership for Sustainable
Communities is benefiting our city and growing our economy. Regional
Administrator of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) Ed Jennings also joined us, subbing in for HUD Secretary Shaun
Donovan who encountered travel problems but had planned on being there
with us as well. During their visit, Mayor Wharton and I showed how
more than $130 million in investments around Shelby County is helping
everything from FedEx to the Broad Avenue business corridor and from
the Legends Park West housing development to the bike and pedestrian
path over Harahan Bridge, which is part of the Main2Main project. I
enjoyed this chance to promote Memphis, our economy, and the importance
of HOPE VI, the Choice Neighborhoods program and the Promise Zone
initiative directly to senior members of the President's
Administration, and I will continue to fight for our city.
Join My Telephone Town Hall on Wednesday, April 30th
Next Wednesday evening at 6:10PM CT, I will host a telephone town hall
to answer your questions and discuss a variety of topics including my
recent "Building a Healthier Memphis" wellness event that focused on
reducing the rising number of diabetes diagnoses in our city. If you
would like to participate in this telephone town hall on Wednesday,
April 30th, please fill out the form here
with your home phone
number before Sunday evening - unfortunately, we are unable to call
cell phones.
Closing the Educational Achievement Gap
I was pleased to join Dr. Ivory Toldson, the Deputy Director of the
White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities,
this week at several events at LeMoyne-Owen College to discuss the next
steps forward in closing the minority student achievement gap in our
nation's education system. Too many of our young people are trapped in
failing schools with too few resources dedicated to low-income and
minority students. While the gap has been closing in Tennessee schools
over the last few years, our state is still behind the national average-
so we have to do more. The President's new "My Brother's Keeper"
initiative is an important step forward, and I will do everything I can
to help it succeed in its goal of educating every boy and young man of
color so that we can finally close the achievement gap once and for all.
Helping St. Jude
Yesterday, I announced that St. Jude Children's Research Hospital was
awarded an $8 million, seven-year contract with the National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Disease, which is part of the National
Institutes of Health, to support the Center of Excellence for Influenza
Research and Surveillance (CEIRS) at St. Jude, one of only 5 such
centers in the nation.
Even today, flu infections are still a leading cause of illness and
death around the world. During an average flu season in the United
States, the virus is linked to approximately 36,000 deaths and 114,000
hospitalizations. The CEIRS at St. Jude will help support an
international flu surveillance network focused on wild birds and
domestic animals. Birds are widely considered to be a source of the flu
and new pandemic viruses. The funding provided through this contract
will help one of our city's world-class health care institutions, St.
Jude, conduct important work that could prevent flu outbreaks and save
lives around the world.
Congratulating Newly-Accepted Military Service Academy Students
Yesterday morning, I hosted a reception at my office in the Clifford
Davis/Odell Horton Federal Building to congratulate four Ninth District
students who have been accepted to attend United States Military
Service Academies. Three of the students, Grayson Michael Harber of
Germantown High School, Ciarra Simone Robinson of Millington Central
High School, and Minh Nhat Vuong of Cordova High School, will attend
the U.S. Air Force Academy this fall, and Kristin Chanelle Williams of
White Station High School will attend West Point.
I truly enjoyed the opportunity to spend time with Ciarra, Grayson,
Kristin, and Minh this week. Each of them was accompanied by proud
parents who have worked closely with their children to instill the
value of academics and discipline. These students' hard work in school
and dedication to their country should serve as an inspiration to us
all. I wish them all the best of luck in their future endeavors, and I
am confident they will make Memphis and the entire Ninth District proud.
Fighting to Prevent Discrimination in Education
On Tuesday, the United States Supreme Court decided to uphold Michigan
Proposal 2, which reopens the door for discrimination in public
education by prohibiting affirmative action in the admission process.
>From making discrimination in voting easier to pushing high-quality
educations further out of the reach of minorities, the Supreme Court's
slow but steady erosion of the basic rights that every American should
expect marks a difficult and dark chapter in our nation's history.
I agree with Justice Sotomayor who, in her dissenting opinion, wrote
that judges "ought not sit back and wish away, rather than confront,
the racial inequality that exists in our society." We have fought for
too long to protect these rights, and we must not give them up without
a fight. As the senior Democrat on the House Judiciary Subcommittee on
the Constitution, I will do all that I can to protect the progress we've
made in securing the civil rights of every American.
Bringing Justice to the Unfairly Incarcerated
This week, President Obama's Administration announced it will use new,
more expansive criteria in considering requests for executive clemency.
The announcement is an important step towards bringing justice to
hundreds, if not thousands, of Americans still serving time in prison
under unjust sentences that would not be ordered today and that have
been repudiated by Congress and the President.
>From my first day in Congress, advocating for fairer sentencing laws
and realistically examining sentencing disparities has been a
centerpiece of my legislative agenda. After years of advocating on
behalf of Americans who are unfairly incarcerated, the policies that
I've encouraged the President and the Attorney General to adopt are now
being implemented. I am very encouraged by the prospect that these new
clemency criteria will give deserving non-violent drug offenders a
second chance at freedom, improve our justice system, and save
taxpayers money. President Obama can and should use his Constitutional
power to help bring all of these inmates the justice they deserve, and
I hope he does so as soon as possible.
In addition to announcing new clemency criteria, the Administration
also announced that Deborah Leff, the Acting Senior Counselor for
Access to Justice at the United States Department of Justice (DOJ),
will replace Ronald Rodgers as the head of the DOJ's Office of the
Pardon Attorney. I am glad that the Administration is replacing an
attorney who has been admonished for misrepresenting critical
information to the President with someone who has committed her career
to providing Americans equal access to the justice they deserve. I wish
Deborah Leff good luck in her new role, and hope that her office
quickly begins to fulfill its mission of restoring liberty to those
whose debt to society has long since been paid.
Make Sure to Claim Unclaimed Property
The State of Tennessee maintains a searchable database of unclaimed
property, which can include bank accounts, stocks and dividends, wages,
refunds, insurance payments, gift certificates, credit balances and
overpayments, and a number of other things. There is no cost for
accessing the database, and you may find that you are owed money or
property. If you have not searched the database yet or if you haven't
searched in a while, you can visit https://www.claimittn.gov
and see for yourself whether the state is holding
any property or assets for you. And you may pass this information along
to your friends and family as well!
Helping Veterans Find Jobs
This week, First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden announced the
launch of a new integrated employment tool to connect veterans and
service members with employers, and to help translate military skills
into the civilian workforce. The Veterans Employment Center
, an integrated, online tool connecting
veterans, transitioning service members and their spouses with both
public and private-sector employers, is the result of an interagency
effort to improve, simplify and consolidate the current array of
employment resources for veterans. Additionally, this will provide one
comprehensive database of resumes for employers who are seeking to
leverage the skills and talents of veterans, service members, and their
spouses. A video tutorial on how to use the Veterans Employment Center
can be viewed here
.
Let's go Grizz!
As always, I remain.

Urban

(HUD)
Ed
Jennings
also
joined

subbing
in

who
encountered

Closing
the
Educational
Achievement
Gap
I was
pleased
to
join Dr.
Ivory
Toldson,
the
Deputy
Director
of
the
White
House
Initiative
on
Historically
Black
Colleges
and
Universities,
this
week
at
several
events
at LeMoyne-Owen
College to
discuss
the
next
steps
forward
in
closing
the
minority
student
achievement
gap
in
our
nation&#8217;s
education
system.
Too
many
of
our
young
people
are
trapped
in
failing
schools
with
too
few
resources
dedicated
to
low-income
and
minority
students.
While
the
gap
has
been
closing
in
Tennessee
schools
over
the
last
few
years,
our
state
is
still
behind
the
national
average&#8212;so
we
have
to
do
more.
The
President&#8217;s
new
&#8220;My
Brother&#8217;s
Keeper&#8221;
initiative
is
an
important
step
forward,
and
I
will
do
everything
I
can
to
help
it
succeed
in
its
goal
of
educating
every
boy
and
young
man
of
color
so
that
we
can
finally
close
the
achievement
gap
once
and
for
all.
Helping
St.
Jude
Yesterday,
I
announced
that
St.
Jude
Children&#8217;s
Research
Hospital
was
awarded
an
$8
million,
seven-year
contract
with
the
National
Institute
of
Allergy
and
Infectious
Disease,
which
is
part
of
the
National
Institutes
of
Health,
to
support
the
Center
of
Excellence
for
Influenza
Research
and
Surveillance
(CEIRS)
at
St.
Jude,
one
of
only
5
such
centers
in
the
nation.
Even
today,
flu
infections
are
still
a
leading
cause
of
illness
and
death
around
the
world.
During
an
average
flu
season
in
the
United
States,
the
virus
is
linked
to
approximately
36,000
deaths
and
114,000
hospitalizations.
The
CEIRS
at
St.
Jude
will
help
support
an
international
flu
surveillance
network
focused
on
wild
birds
and
domestic
animals.
Birds
are
widely
considered
to
be
a
source
of
the
flu
and
new
pandemic
viruses.
The
funding
provided
through
this
contract
will
help
one
of
our
city&#8217;s
world-class
health
care
institutions,
St.
Jude,
conduct
important
work
that
could
prevent
flu
outbreaks
and
save
lives
around
the
world.
Congratulating
Newly-Accepted
Military
Service
Academy
Students
Yesterday
morning,
I
hosted
a
reception
at
my
office
in
the
Clifford
Davis/Odell
Horton
Federal
Building
to
congratulate
four
Ninth
District
students
who
have
been
accepted
to
attend
United
States
Military
Service
Academies.
Three
of
the
students,
Grayson
Michael
Harber
of
Germantown
High
School,
Ciarra
Simone
Robinson
of
Millington
Central
High
School,
and
Minh
Nhat
Vuong
of
Cordova
High
School,
will
attend
the
U.S.
Air
Force
Academy
this
fall,
and
Kristin
Chanelle
Williams
of
White
Station
High
School
will
attend
West
Point.
I
truly
enjoyed
the
opportunity
to
spend
time
with
Ciarra,
Grayson,
Kristin,
and
Minh
this
week.
Each
of
them
was
accompanied
by
proud
parents
who
have
worked
closely
with
their
children
to
instill
the
value
of
academics
and
discipline.
These
students&#8217;
hard
work
in
school
and
dedication
to
their
country
should
serve
as
an
inspiration
to
us
all.
I
wish
them
all
the
best
of
luck
in
their
future
endeavors,
and
I
am
confident
they
will
make
Memphis
and
the
entire
Ninth
District
proud.
Fighting
to
Prevent
Discrimination
in
Education
On
Tuesday,
the
United
States
Supreme
Court
decided
to
uphold
Michigan
Proposal
2,
which
reopens
the
door
for
discrimination
in
public
education
by
prohibiting
affirmative
action
in
the
admission
process.
From
making
discrimination
in
voting
easier
to
pushing
high-quality
educations
further
out
of
the
reach
of
minorities,
the
Supreme
Court&#8217;s
slow
but
steady
erosion
of
the
basic
rights
that
every
American
should
expect
marks
a
difficult
and
dark
chapter
in
our
nation&#8217;s
history.
I
agree
with
Justice
Sotomayor
who,
in
her
dissenting
opinion,
wrote
that
judges
&#8220;ought
not
sit
back
and
wish
away,
rather
than
confront,
the
racial
inequality
that
exists
in
our
society.&#8221;
We
have
fought
for
too
long
to
protect
these
rights,
and
we
must
not
give
them
up
without
a
fight.
As
the
senior
Democrat
on
the
House
Judiciary
Subcommittee
on
the
Constitution,
I
will
do
all
that
I
can
to
protect
the
progress
we&#8217;ve
made
in
securing
the
civil
rights
of
every
American.
Bringing
Justice
to
the
Unfairly
Incarcerated
This
week,
President
Obama&#8217;s
Administration
announced
it
will
use
new,
more
expansive
criteria
in
considering
requests
for
executive
clemency.
The
announcement
is
an
important
step
towards
bringing
justice
to
hundreds,
if
not
thousands,
of
Americans
still
serving
time
in
prison
under
unjust
sentences
that
would
not
be
ordered
today
and
that
have
been
repudiated
by
Congress
and
the
President.
From
my
first
day
in
Congress,
advocating
for
fairer
sentencing
laws
and
realistically
examining
sentencing
disparities
has
been
a
centerpiece
of
my
legislative
agenda.
After
years
of
advocating
on
behalf
of
Americans
who
are
unfairly
incarcerated,
the
policies
that
I&#8217;ve
encouraged
the
President
and
the
Attorney
General
to
adopt
are
now
being
implemented.
I
am
very
encouraged
by
the
prospect
that
these
new
clemency
criteria
will
give
deserving
non-violent
drug
offenders
a
second
chance
at
freedom,
improve
our
justice
system,
and
save
taxpayers
money.
President
Obama
can
and
should
use
his
Constitutional
power
to
help
bring
all
of
these
inmates
the
justice
they
deserve,
and
I
hope
he
does
so
as
soon
as
possible.
In
addition
to
announcing
new
clemency
criteria,
the
Administration
also
announced
that
Deborah
Leff,
the
Acting
Senior
Counselor
for
Access
to
Justice
at
the
United
States
Department
of
Justice
(DOJ),
will
replace
Ronald
Rodgers
as
the
head
of
the
DOJ&#8217;s
Office
of
the
Pardon
Attorney.
I
am
glad
that
the
Administration
is
replacing
an
attorney
who
has
been
admonished
for
misrepresenting
critical
information
to
the
President
with
someone
who
has
committed
her
career
to
providing
Americans
equal
access
to
the
justice
they
deserve.
I
wish
Deborah
Leff
good
luck
in
her
new
role,
and
hope
that
her
office
quickly
begins
to
fulfill
its
mission
of
restoring
liberty
to
those
whose
debt
to
society
has
long
since
been
paid.
Make
Sure
to
Claim
Unclaimed
Property
The
State
of
Tennessee
maintains
a
searchable
database
of
unclaimed
property,
which
can
include
bank
accounts,
stocks
and
dividends,
wages,
refunds,
insurance
payments,
gift
certificates,
credit
balances
and
overpayments,
and
a
number
of
other
things.
There
is
no
cost
for
accessing
the
database,
and
you
may
find
that
you
are
owed
money
or
property.
If
you
have
not
searched
the
database
yet
or
if
you
haven&#8217;t
searched
in
a
while,
you
can
visit
https://www.claimittn.gov
and
see
for
yourself
whether
the
state
is
holding
any
property
or
assets
for
you.
And
you
may
pass
this
information
along
to
your
friends
and
family
as
well!
