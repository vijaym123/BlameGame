Picture of the Week:
I
enjoyed serving as Grand Marshal in the Snow Camp Christmas Parade last
weekend. It was a beautiful day that allowed for me to see familiar
faces and introduce myself to new ones as well. It was such an honor to be
a part of this
tradition!
I received thrilling news this past week regarding
legislation, called the EARLY Act, that I introduced with Rep. Wasserman Schultz
(D-Fla.). I learned on Tuesday that this bill passed the Senate and is
headed to the Presidents desk to be signed into law. The EARLY Act
is aimed at educating young women on the risks associated with breast
cancer and equips them, and doctors alike, with the tools necessary to
detect and prevent this disease from taking place.

Also this week, I had
the opportunity to join Cisco at its 12th annual Global Hunger Relief
Campaign. Together, we presented the Food Bank of Central and Eastern
North Carolina with enough money to provide 2.5 million meals! It was a
wonderful opportunity to join employees and volunteers to categorize
and box food donations to send out. I hope you will take a moment to
check out the video
that ABC 11
put together on this event.
I'm looking forward to spending time with friends and
family during this special time of year, and I wish you all a blessed
holiday season.
Fayetteville VA Ribbon
Cutting:
On
Wednesday , I participated in the ribbon cutting for the
Fayetteville VA Medical Center's new modular building. This addition
will
expand mental health services to our growing veteran
population-- something our community is in desperate need of. This facility
will double the Fayetteville VAs mental health capacity, which will
improve patient care and provide much-needed
support.
Giving
Back:
After joining Cisco volunteers
at the Food Bank of Central &amp; Eastern NC (CENC) Tuesday, I was on
hand for the presentation of a check for $463,746 from Cisco RTP
campus to Food Bank of CENC. Pictured above is
Cisco Site
Executive, Ed Paradise , Food Bank CENC
President/CEO Peter Werbicki, and
Food Bank Board Chair, Barry
Barker.
I
enjoyed working with the wonderful Cisco volunteers at the
Food
Bank
to sort donated food -- some of which
will make its way to 2nd District families
in Chatham, Wake, Moore and Lee
counties.
Joining Cisco volunteers working at the
Food Bank CENC
was a great way to highlight the
importance of contributing and volunteering not only during the holidays...
but all year
round.
Snow Camp Christmas Parade:
I cannot think of a better
way to get into the Christmas Spirit than by serving as Grand Marshal in
the Snow Camp Christmas Parade.
Happy Holidays!
