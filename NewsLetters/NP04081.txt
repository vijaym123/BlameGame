Dear Friend,
In case you missed it, last week our national debt surpassed &#36;18 trillion. When I am home in Missouri, I constantly hear from parents and grandparents who are worried that their children and grandchildren will not be able to live the American dream because our national debt will cripple our economy for generations. This new record debt should be a wakeup call &#150; now is the time to reduce the size and scope of the federal government and end Washington&#146;s spending addiction.
After years of spending money that we do not have, our nation&#146;s economy is stagnant. If nothing is done, our nation&#146;s debt crisis threatens the future prosperity of every American. In the six years President Obama has been in office, the debt has increased by more than &#36;7 trillion, or about 70 percent. If you stacked every dollar bill of the national debt, the stack of bills would be more than one million miles high. At over &#36;18 trillion, each American&#146;s share of the national debt is more than &#36;56,000.
Our tax dollars have been wasted on numerous programs studying the effects of Swedish massages for rabbits, determining if spouses feel &#147;hangry&#148; &#40;anger stemming from hunger&#41; , or if moms love their dogs as much as they love their kids. The Pentagon spent &#36;1 billion to destroy &#36;16 billion in unused ammunition. Three billion went to test how golf clubs and tadpole shrimp adapt on the International Space Station. These are just a few examples of the rampant widespread waste, to say nothing of the fraud and abuse in entitlement programs.
This wasteful spending has bad economic consequences &#150; higher cost of living, higher interest rates for farm loans and small business investments, and higher taxes for everyone. Washington has spent a lot of money on government bureaucracy in an attempt to create jobs. It didn&#146;t work. In fact, the government spending spree led by President Obama has resulted in the longest unemployment crisis since the Great Depression and the slowest recovery in a generation. I am committed to job growth and that starts with an end to deficit spending and a plan to pay down the national debt.
Our economy&#146;s road to recovery will not be paved with massive national debt and more deficit spending. We will enjoy prosperity by permanently and responsibly reining in federal spending and paying down our national debt. Our Missouri Constitution has a balanced budget amendment that guarantees fiscal responsibility. The first bill I filed as a member of Congress was a federal balanced budget amendment, because if Washington was more like Missouri we would be a lot better off.
THIS WEEK&#39;S HIGHLIGHTS
This Friday I announced a friendly bet on the SEC Championship game with Congressman Bradley Byrne from Alabama. If the Missouri Tigers win the SEC Championship, Congressman Byrne will bring me some Gulf Coast seafood. If the Alabama Crimson Tide win, I will share with Congressman Byrne a Levee High Apple Pie from The Blue Owl in Kimmswick, MO and our world-famous Missouri BBQ ribs. Unlike others in the country, I fully expected Mizzou to compete immediately in the SEC. Playing in two conference championships in three years proves that we belong.
Mizzou is going to pull out a shocker in Atlanta, and I&#146;m looking forward to that gulf seafood when the Tigers tame the Tide! If Congressman Byrne wants some Missouri BBQ, he&#146;ll just have to come visit&#33;
This week I voted for
H.R. 5759, the Executive Amnesty Prevention Act of 2014
which blocks the executive branch from using executive orders to defer deportation of illegal aliens.

As we thank God for our blessings and spend time with friends and family this Christmas season, let&#146;s also set aside time to help our neighbors. Each of my district offices is collecting non&#45;perishable food items for those in need through December 18th.
Thank you to Mary Sparks of Iron Mountain Lake for her donation at the Farmington office this week&#33;
Sincerely,
Jason Smith
Member of Congress
