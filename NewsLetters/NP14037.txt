Honoring Our Veterans
Last week, I had the privilege of participating in Veterans Day
ceremonies to honor the men and women who have served in our armed
forces in Mount Vernon, Sultan and Mill Creek.

Dear Friend:
After enduring 16 days of an unnecessary government shutdown, Congress
finally reached a deal to reopen the government and avoid what could
have been a disastrous default on our nation's debt.
I know many of you agree with me that the shutdown never should have
happened and that it's now time to move on so we can focus on growing
our economy. I'm committed to working with my colleagues across the
aisle to write a long-term budget that responsibly reduces the deficit
and spurs job growth. In addition to the budget, Congress has the
opportunity to tackle a number of significant issues before the end of
the year that are important to the businesses and families of
Washington state: passing immigration reform and reauthorizing a Farm
Bill.
A New Farm Bill that is Good for Washington Farmers and Families
In Washington state, our agriculture and food industry generates $46
billion in economic activity and employs around 160,000 people. It's
critical to our state's economy that Congress passes a Farm Bill. For
too long, our nation has been without a reauthorized Farm Bill because
Congress has failed to act. I am hopeful the recently formed Farm Bill
conference committee, made up of members of both the House and the
Senate, will be able to come up with a bipartisan proposal that is good
for Washington farmers and families.
As the only member of Congress from Washington state on the conference
committee, I will continue to work for investments that benefit our
local producers of specialty and organic crops. I will also fight to
ensure that our dairy farmers have the certainty they deserve through
reforms that will stabilize the dairy market and protect consumers. In
addition, as the most trade-dependent state in the nation, we must fund
programs that open up new markets and support Washington state's
agricultural exports. Finally, I will fight for the millions of working
families, seniors, veterans and children who count on nutrition
programs, and I will push to expand innovative job-training programs
that help low-income individuals get the education and skills they need
to become self-sufficient.
Immigration Reform
We have a historic opportunity to fix the nation's broken immigration
system so it works for our families, businesses and economy. As a
member of the House Judiciary Committee, I'm working to move forward on
immigration reform because it is critical to the people and economy of
Washington state.
Our district is representative of why we need reform. We have a
northern border and an incredibly diverse economy with rich agriculture
and berry and dairy farmers, as well as some of the world's most
innovative tech, biotech and startup companies.
These businesses - large and small - have been making a strong case to
Congress that fixing our immigration system must be a top priority.
That's why I helped lead the introduction of H.R. 15, a bill that takes
a comprehensive approach. With 190 cosponsors, this bill (which is very
similar to what was passed by the US Senate earlier this year) reflects
an important agreement reached by a diverse, bipartisan coalition
including: the business community, our agriculture employers, faith
leaders, law enforcement and the broader American public, all of whom
agree that passing comprehensive immigration reform is the right thing
to do for our country and our economy. The time to act is now, and I am
going to continue fighting to allow a vote on this important bill.
Congress clearly has a lot to do the rest of the year, and it's going
to take a great deal of work to get the job done. Despite the
difficulty, it's critical that we move forward and I'm committed to
doing everything I can to deliver results for you.
Finally, as always, if you have any questions, need assistance dealing
with a federal agency or are having problems with your Social Security,
Medicare or veterans benefits, please do not hesitate to contact my
office. We can also help you with any questions you have about signing
up for coverage on Washington state's new health exchange, the
Washington Healthplanfinder
.
My staff and I are here to serve you, and I urge
you to contact me if we can be helpful.
Sincerely,
Suzan

Honoring
Our
Veterans
Last
week,
I
had
the
privilege
of
participating
in
Veterans

ceremonies
to
honor
the
men

who
have

Dear

After

a

to

and
that
it&#8217;s

our

I&#8217;m
committed

my

across
the

to
write
a
long-term
budget
that
responsibly
reduces
the

In
addition
to
the
budget,
Congress
has
the
opportunity
to
tackle
a
number
of
significant
issues
before
the
end
of
the
year
that
are
important
to
the
businesses
and
families
of
Washington
state:
passing
immigration
reform
and
reauthorizing
a
Farm
Bill.
A
New
Farm
Bill
that
is
Good

Washington
Farmers
and
Families
In
Washington
state,
our
agriculture
and
food
industry
generates
$46

economic
activity
and
employs
around
160,000
people.
It&#8217;s
critical

For
too

our
nation
has
been

a

Farm

I
am
hopeful
the
recently

made

of
members
of
both
the
House
and
the
Senate,
will
be
able
to
come

the
conference

I
will
continue
to

investments
that
benefit
our
local

I
will

that
will
stabilize
the
dairy

In

as

we
must
fund
programs

open

Finally,
I

I

Immigration

a
historic
opportunity
to
fix
the
nation&#8217;s
broken
immigration
system
so
it
works
for
our
families,
businesses
and
economy.
As
a
member
of
the
House
Judiciary
Committee,
I&#8217;m
working
to
move
forward
on
immigration
reform
because
it
is
critical
to
the
people
and
economy
of
Washington
state.
Our
district
is
representative
of
why
we
need
reform.
We
have
a
northern
border
and
an
incredibly
diverse
economy
with
rich
agriculture
and
berry
and
dairy
farmers,
as
well
as
some

These

&#8211;
large

the
business

our
agriculture

faith

law

and
the
broader
American
public,
all
of
whom
agree
that
passing
comprehensive
immigration
reform
is
the
right
thing
to
do
for
our
country
and
our
economy.
The
time
to
act
is
now,
and
I
am
going
to
continue
fighting
to
allow
a

on
this
important
bill.
Congress
clearly
has
a
lot
to
do
the
rest
of
the
year,
and
it&#8217;s
going
to
take
a
great
deal
of
work
to
get
the
job
done.
Despite
the
difficulty,
it&#8217;s
critical
that
we
move
forward
and
I&#8217;m
committed
to
doing
everything
I
can
