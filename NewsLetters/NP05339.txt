Dear Fellow Nevadan,
This Sunday will mark
the 16th anniversary since the passage of the Southern Nevada Public
Land Management Act (SNPLMA), one of the most successful programs in the
history of Nevada. I worked with former Senator Richard Bryan and
then-Congressman John Ensign to pass this important legislation in 1998.
Since its passage, SNPLMA has provided billions of dollars to our
states economy for public works projects as well as restoration and
conservation efforts.
Unfortunately, members of the House Natural
Resources Committee have proposed that funding generated by SNPLMA
land sales in Las Vegas and North Las Vegas be sent to the Treasury
Department. I will not allow nor support these efforts to gut SNPLMA.
Funding generated by SNPLMA land sales should be spent in Nevada, as the
original legislation intended.
To date, SNPLMA has generated
over $3 billion through the sale of 15,000 acres of land in the Las
Vegas Valley, including:
$300 million spent on Lake
Tahoe Restoration
Over $44 million spent on fuels
reduction to battle wildland fire
$1.1 billion spent on
parks, trails and natural areas in Nevada to encourage Nevadans to get
outdoors
Over $500 million for acquisition of
environmentally sensitive lands
Over $500 million spent on capital
improvements in on our public lands (like the Corn Creek Visitor
Center).
Over $150 million to the State of Nevada Education
Fund
Over $288 million to the Southern Nevada Water
Authority for infrastructure improvements
The list
below represents a small fraction of the projects funded by
SNPLMA:
Springs Preserve
Clark County Wetlands
Park
Clark County Shooting Park
Neon
Boneyard
Habitat Restoration in the Desert National
Wildlife Refuge
Red Rock Canyon Visitor Center that opened in
2010
Red Rock Fire Station
Lake Mead
Hatchery Visitor Center
Lake Mead marina adjustments for
changing water levels
The River Mountain Loop
Trail
Renovations of Las Vegas area parks such as Lorenzi Park,
Sunset Park, Floyd Lamb Park and Valley View
Park
SNPLMA has funded a lot of LEED certified buildings. Currently Nevada has
more LEED certified buildings than anywhere in the
world.
As the economy rebounds and we see more interest in development
in the Las Vegas Valley we are receiving additional funds for vital
projects in Nevada. SNPLMA is currently accepting nominations for worthy
projects for Round 15 funding through November 7th. Requirements for
nominating projects in all categories can be found at
www.blm.gov/nv/st/en/snplma.html .
