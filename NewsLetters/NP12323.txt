Dear
Friends
Tomorrow
marks the 13th Annual U.S.
Service Academy Information
Night at Delaware
Techs Terry Campus.
This event is an opportunity
to learn about our
nations service
academies and how to apply.
Last year, we had more than
200 Delaware students and
their families attend the
event to learn more about our
service academies, and this
year promises to be another
special night.
As
a former Naval Flight Officer
and a retired U.S. Navy
Captain, I can vouch for the
important education,
leadership and life skills
gained through our
nations service
academies. Although I
didnt have the honor
of attending an academy, I
learned the value of
combining an education with
military service while I was
in the ROTC program at The
Ohio State University.
This event is a great
opportunity for young people
from throughout Delaware to
learn how they can serve our
nation and advance their
educational goals.
I
hope you can join us
tomorrow. As always, I look
forward to hearing from you
on this issue, or any other
through
email ,
or by contacting me on
