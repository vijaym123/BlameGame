Celebrating May is "Health and Fitness" Month in the Metroplex and the Nation's Capitol
Dear Friends,
Did you know that regular physical activity can increase your chances of living a longer and healthier life? It also reduces your risk for high blood pressure, heart disease, and some types of cancer. Yet nearly 16.4% of Texas high school students do not get the recommended 60 minutes of physical activity a day and Texas is the 19th most obese state in the nation.
During the month of May, I challenged health care providers, food, nutrition and fitness industry experts, policy makers, the media and individuals to learn more about and encourage healthy, active lifestyles. This month, I aimed to emphasize the wide-reaching health benefits of learning about nutrition and physical fitness by introducing a resolution to recognize May as Health and Fitness Month, and organizing events in the Metroplex and Washington, D.C. to emphasize awareness.
Healthy, active lifestyles benefit everyone. No matter what shape you are in, you can find activities that work for you. Together, we can rise to the challenge by incorporating more nutritious foods and new activities into our daily routines.
As always, I invite you to connect with me through my
official website ,
Facebook page ,
Instagram , and
Twitter account
to stay informed of what I am working on in the District and in Washington, D.C.
Sincerely,
Congressman Marc Veasey, TX-33

Rep. Veasey Celebrates Success of Second Annual Health and Fitness Month Events
Earlier this month, I introduced a House Resolution which commemorates the
Month of May as Health and Fitness Month . My resolution in conjunction with the Presidents Council on Fitness, Sports &amp; Nutrition has dedicated the month of May to health and fitness, so we can show that there are simple steps everyone can take to turn the tide on obesity in America.
As the resolution circulated for Member support, I organized a variety of health and fitness events throughout the 33rd Congressional District in Texas to get Americans motivated about living a healthy lifestyle.
I hosted a FREE Health Fair that provided CD33 residents free health screenings, fun activities for the family and information on services that relate to healthy living.

Annual Community Walk in Kiest Park, I was joined by constituents from around the Metroplex for a 2-mile walk to promote healthy activity.

Fidelco Guide Dog Foundation .

School Lunches After School Lets Out
Studies show that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, especially for children. Eating school breakfast improves childrens educational performance, behavior, and health.
About 70% Texas students participate in free or reduced-price breakfast and lunch programs at their schools. But as schools let out for the summer, many families will lose access to this key source of nutritional and financial support.
Fortunately, federally funded summer meal programs can help provide healthy meals to students throughout the year. For a list of sites near you, visit:

5 Tips to Maintain Healthy Habits Year-Round
Ewunike A. Akpan of the Build Our Kids Success ( BOKS ) Initiative, Certified Personal Trainer and Wellness Coach, is sharing her tips to stay on track with health and fitness year-round.
Make small changes consistently to improve your healthy lifestyle practices and they will become permanent ways of life.
1.
Start every day with a glass of water to re-hydrate the body and have a small healthy breakfast to activate digestion and metabolism after several hours of sleep.
2.
Practice 5 basic stretches every day. Even a min of each stretch makes a difference to increase flexibility, improve circulation and manage stress.

3.
Engage in 30-60 min of vigorous physical activity every day. The total duration of the activity does not have to be completed all at the same time.
Try the (10/15/20) method for a total of 45 minutes of activity: 10 min in the morning before work or school, 15 minutes during the day on any break and 20 min
in the evening. Vary the time of the intervals of activity based on your availability and work towards 60 min each day.
4.
Reduce sugar from the diet.
Excessive sugar has been linked to obesity and a higher risk of developing chronic diseases. Consider the sugar content in beverages which can sabotage daily caloric intake.
5.
Make half of your plate vegetables and fruit at every meal. Eating a diet rich in vegetables and fruits as part of an overall healthy diet may reduce the risk of heart disease including heart attack and stroke.
