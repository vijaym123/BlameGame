Dear
David,
Just a friendly reminder that you and your family are
invited to tonight's Service Academy Night that I will be hosting in
the City of Montclair from 6:30pm-8:30pm.
Representatives from the U.S. Military Academy,
the U.S. Naval Academy, the U.S. Air Force Academy, and the U.S.
Merchant Marines Academy will outline the process for applying for a
Congressional Nomination for an Academy appointment.
All students
seeking admission to these institutions require a nomination from a Member
of Congress or from the Vice President of the United
States.
Students will have the opportunity to review the application
process for each military academy and discuss the educational opportunities
the academies offer.
All students are welcome to attend this
event but only students who reside in the 35th Congressional District of
California may apply for a Congressional Nomination with my
office.
