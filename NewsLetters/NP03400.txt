The House
Continues to Work for Fifth District
Priorities
Dear Friend,
This week, we in the House continued to
address two of the most urgent priorities I
hear about from Fifth District Virginians.
First, we advanced legislation to cut off
government funds from being used to carry
out President Obamas executive
actions on immigration.
The
legislation we adopted
explicitly
prevents the funding of the
Presidents recent executive actions
and requires priority removal and
deportation of illegal immigrants who have
been convicted of crimes. Though the
President has acknowledged time and time
again that the Constitution limits the
authority of the executive branch to act
unilaterally to change the law, he has
taken action contrary to his constitutional
powers and without the consent of Congress
by effectively granting legal status to
millions of illegal immigrants through
unilateral action.
The restrictions that passed the House
this week are meaningful steps that will
discourage, rather than encourage, illegal
immigration and are essential to
re-asserting the fundamental principle that
Congress makes our laws and the President
must enforce them - explicit duties
outlined by our Constitution. It is my hope
that the Senate moves expeditiously to pass
this important legislation and send it to
the White House. We in the House will
continue to work to strengthen the security
of our borders and to implement an
immigration policy that is rooted in the
rule of law.
House
Passes Hurt Jobs Bill
The House also continued its work on the
pressing issue of job creation by passing
the
Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small
Business Burdens Act
with bipartisan
support. While the country has begun to
experience modest economic growth,
unemployment remains too high in Virginia's
Fifth District, and wages are not growing
enough to make working families feel that
our economy has recovered. Small businesses
also continue to be stifled by excessive
federal regulation that stands in the way
of more dynamic job creation across
Virginia and our nation.
The legislation passed by the House on
Wednesday combines the text of 11 bills,
all of which address unnecessary or
excessive federal regulations hindering our
small businesses from accelerating job
growth.
The
Small Company Disclosure Simplification
Act , which I introduced with my
Democratic colleague Congresswoman Terri
Sewell during the 113th Congress, was
incorporated into the legislation. The
provision we introduced removes burdensome
regulations for small public companies and
requires the SEC to perform a cost benefit
analysis on the rules impact on
these companies, offering a practical step
forward to ensure that our regulatory
structure does not disproportionately
burden smaller companies and
dis-incentivize start-ups from accessing
the public markets. By streamlining these
requirements, small companies will now be
able focus on innovating, expanding, and
creating jobs.
As the 114th Congress continues, we in
the House will continue to advance
bipartisan solutions like this one that get
Washington out of the way and allow our
small businesses and family farms to focus
on succeeding and creating good-paying
jobs. It is my hope that our colleagues in
the Senate will now take up this bill and
join us in advancing policies that will
spur job creation and economic
recovery.
