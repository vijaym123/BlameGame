David,
This week, the Senate will continue our work towards increasing the national minimum wage. Just last month in Connecticut, we raised the wage to $10.10/hour, and it&rsquo;s time the for rest of the country to follow suit. That&rsquo;s why Senator Baldwin and I are teaming up in this fight.
We have a series of events scheduled this week to bring awareness to this issue before a vote comes to the Senate. To be clear, the vote coming before the Senate is simply a vote on whether or not to bring the minimum wage to a vote. Yep, you read that correctly: there may be Republican opposition to even voting on voting on the issue at hand.
So throughout the week we&rsquo;ll be making floor speeches asking our fellow Senators and Congressmen to do the right thing, and will be holding press conferences with workers affected by the minimum wage. But we need your help. People hear from Senators plenty on these issues&mdash;we need YOU to tell House and Senate Republicans why this vote is so critically important.

This effort can make a real difference. We&rsquo;re here in Washington to work for you, and we know that when enough constituents tweet or contact us about an issue, we should listen. Make sure your voice is heard.
Thanks,
Senators Richard Blumenthal, and Tammy Baldwin
