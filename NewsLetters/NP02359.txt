On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
addressed a joint session of Congress. In his speech, he discussed a
nuclear Iran and how it endangers the very existence of Israel. Israel is a
bright light of democracy and our greatest ally in a region that is
becoming more and more volatile with every passing day. Make no mistake,
America must mitigate this threat, as well as the threat of radical
Islam, and as we do so, our partnership with Israel is more important
than ever. I thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for his unconditional
commitment to fighting these existential threats with us.
That afternoon, I voted
against the
Senate Amendment to
H.R. 240 , the Department of Homeland Security
Appropriations Act, 2015, which the House passed by a vote of 257-167.
(See
Roll Call
#109 ) The Senate
Amendment
to H.R. 240 makes appropriations
for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through the end of
fiscal year (FY) 2015. A summary of the provisions
in
H.R. 240 can
be
found
here . Our Founding Fathers gave Congress a tool to resolve
legislative stalemates
the conference committee. It was one of their
many strokes of genius. Its extremely disappointing that Senate
Democrats blatantly refused to use it in order to protect President Obamas
unconstitutional, unilateral actions on immigration. This is in direct
disregard of the will of the American people, and I simply cannot
support their repeated refusal to pursue regular order and continued my
way or the highway mentality. We must work
together.
After votes, I went down to the House Floor to deliver a
special order speech on Americas economic outlook and President Obamas FY
2016 budget. You can
watch
the speech in full here !
On Wednesday, the House passed
H.R.
749 , the Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015, by a vote of
316-101. (See
Roll Call
#112 ) H.R. 749 authorizes appropriations for
the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) for FY 2016-2019
with a 40 percent reduction in Amtrak's authorized funding levels.
Additionally, H.R. 749 takes steps to eliminate Amtrak's losses in food and
beverage service, leverages private sector resources to improve
investment, creates greater accountability and transparency, and mandates
that Amtrak carry out a business case analysis for all major
procurements. Finally, this legislation keeps Northeast Corridor profits in the
Northeast Corridor (NEC), in order to allow reinvestment, and improves
management of the NEC while incentivizing increased
investments.
To wrap up the week, I
joined my colleagues, Jim Himes (D-CT-4), John Delaney (D-MD-6), and
Ann Wagner (R-MO-2), to reintroduce H.R. 1334, the Holding Company
Registration Threshold Equalization Act of 2015. The bill extends to
savings and loan holding companies (SLHCs) the shareholder registration
threshold (from 500 to 2,000) and the deregistration threshold (from 300
to 1,200) that the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act)
amended for banks and bank holding companies when it was signed into law
on April 5, 2012. Unfortunately, the JOBS Act did not explicitly extend
the thresholds to SLHCs. However, it was not the intention of
Congress to treat SLHCs differently from bank and bank holding
companies.
H.R. 1334 was originally introduced as H.R. 801 during the 113th
Congress, and the bill passed the House on January 14, 2014, by a
vote of 417-4. In the 114th Congress, the text of the Holding Company
Registration Threshold Equalization Act already passed the House on
January 14, 2015, as Title III of H.R. 37, the Promoting Job Creation and
Reducing Small Business Burdens Act by a vote of
271-154.
I am proud to lead the
bipartisan effort to grant our nations 600 small savings and loan
holding companies the same flexibility afforded to bank and bank holding
companies so they can better serve their communities and enable job
creation and economic growth. This bill has proven bipartisan support,
and I am hopeful that in this new Congress, it will finally be signed
into law. The final text of the bill can be found
here .
Next week, the House will not be in
session.
As what is hopefully the last of this winter's
inclement weather makes its way across Arkansas, please stay safe and
warm.
From the Front...
