4X
DONATIONS NOW QUADRUPLE MATCHED WITH 24 HOURS UNTIL THE ELECTION, Democrats are OPENING AN EMERGENCY 4X-MATCH TO HELP US REACH OUR VOTE GOALS. 4x-Match Donations Remaining:
President Obama wouldn&rsquo;t have emailed you yesterday if he didn&rsquo;t need your help.
-- The election is tomorrow
-- We have 32 races that are too-close-to-call
-- And the New York Times reports that we're facing "A Flood of Late Spending... From Murky Sources"
This last-minute Republican ad barrage could cost us the whole election. But here&rsquo;s the good news: After President Obama&rsquo;s email yesterday, a group of Democratic supporters agreed to QUADRUPLE-MATCH ALL GIFTS.
David, control of Congress is at stake. Please don&rsquo;t waste this opportunity.
Can you respond to President Obama&rsquo;s ask for help?
