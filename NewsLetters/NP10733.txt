Friends,
This week,
I will vote for the new House Republican Budget , called
The
Path to Prosperity .
This budget is a vision for a free and prosperous America, where the deficit becomes a surplus through
spending reform , paychecks get bigger and jobs get better through
tax reform , and more people can access
job training
under a new anti-poverty agenda.
This vision
keeps our countrys promises to seniors
and provides new opportunities for future generations. It also
repeals Obamacare
and clears the way for health care freedom and choice.
One personal favorite is a section on transportation reform, which
includes concepts from my Transportation Empowerment Act . Specifically, the budget recommends a pilot program for states to take control of highway funding and opt out of the federal gas tax.
Overall, this is a bold vision for America and a conservative counter-argument to President Obama's harmful policies.
We know America can do better, and this is our plan to do it .
I encourage you to visit the House Budget Committee
website , where you can view the the full plan, nonpartisan analysis, detailed summaries and helpful graphs, like the one above.
Access all the information at
budget.house.gov .
Let me know what you think. I created a
Facebook post
to start the conversation.
Freedom First,
Congressman Tom Graves
