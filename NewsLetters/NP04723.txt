Congratulations to Hudson, NC's Madison Bumgarner!
One of Caldwell County's very own made history last week when he led
his team to a World Series win and was named the 2014 Most Valuable
Player (MVP). Madison Bumgarner, the San Francisco Giants' starting
pitcher, is a Hudson, NC native who played baseball at South Caldwell
High School and helped them win the 2007 4A State Championship. We are
all very proud of Madison. Read this great profile
on his family and life growing up in
Hudson, NC.
Honoring the Burleson Family
It was a great honor and privilege to recognize Brooke and Adam
Burleson and their lovely daughter Holland last week. After learning
their daughter had been diagnosed with Down Syndrome, Brooke and Adam
looked for ways to help other families raising special needs children.
The Burleson family organized the inaugural Run for Holland 5k and 1
Mile Fun Run to raise funds and awareness for families with children
who have been diagnosed with Down Syndrome and other special needs.
They were met with overwhelming support from the Spruce Pine community
with more than 290 participants and more than $8,000 raised. Thank you,
Brooke and Adam!

Honoring Swain County Veteran Dockie Brendle
Earlier this week, I had the honor of attending the unveiling ceremony
for the newly-named Dockie Brendle Bridge over U.S. Highway 74. Mr.
Brendle, a Swain County resident, served in Vietnam where he was
wounded multiple times in battle. For his brave and honorable service,
he was awarded three Purple Hearts, a Combat Infantry Badge, a
Presidential Unit Citation, a Vietnam Service Medal with three Bronze
Stars, a Vietnam Gallantry Cross, and a Vietnam Campaign Medal. The
entire community is grateful for your service, Dockie.

North Carolina Ranked 16th Best State for Business Tax Climate
Some great news! In just one year, North Carolina leapt from number 44
in the country to number 16 for best business tax climates. Following
common-sense tax reforms, North Carolina is now attracting new
businesses. Earlier this month, GE Aviation broke ground on its new
facility in Asheville which will create jobs for hundreds of Western
North Carolinians. I am grateful to GE Aviation and the many other
businesses both large and small that have chosen to invest in Western
North Carolina.
