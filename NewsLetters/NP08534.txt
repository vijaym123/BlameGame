Congressman Lamborn Supports Defense
Appropriations, Boosts Border Security, and Limits Warrantless Searches
of Americans
6/20/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn
supported the Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2015.
Included in the legislation was an amendment from the Congressman
increasing the funding available to the Army National Guard to help address
the illegal immigration crisis currently taking place at our southern
border. The Congressman accomplished this by transferring funding
from the staffing needs of the Secretary of Defense into the funds for
the Army National Guard.
The
Congressman also supported an amendment strengthening the civil liberties
and privacy rights of Americans. The amendment prohibits warrantless
searches of government records for information on U.S. citizens and
prevents the NSA and the CIA from placing so-called "backdoors" for
intelligence access into commercial
products.
"It is extremely important to fully fund our
military forces serving in difficult and dangerous conditions throughout
the world. The primary role of the federal government is to secure our
nation. I'm pleased that I was able to insert language into this bill
providing additional funding for the Army National Guard to help
address the crisis at our southern border. I am also pleased to support
the amendment that prohibits warrantless searches of databases for
information pertaining to U.S. citizens. This is another important step in
protecting the privacy rights of innocent Americans."
