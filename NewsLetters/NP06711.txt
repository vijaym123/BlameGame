David, I&rsquo;m sorry for emailing so much. But I think this is important, so please pay attention.
As you read this, Boehner is in the midst of a
$3O MILLION
assault against Democrats around the country.
He thinks with enough cash, he can defeat Cheri Bustos and replace her with a Republican rubber stamp. Sadly, Boehner could be right.
Cheri can win against Boehner&rsquo;s cash, but only with your support. David, can I count on you to chip in today? If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Election Day is right around the corner. Please don&rsquo;t wait until it&rsquo;s too late to make a difference.
Thank you,
Nancy
