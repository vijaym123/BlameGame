Update from Senator Bob
Corker
November 23, 2014
President is Blatantly Ignoring Rule of
Law by Acting Unilaterally on
Immigration
Senator Corker issued the following statement regarding President
Obamas decision to take executive action on immigration:
The
president is not acting in strength, he is acting in weakness, said
Corker. This decision makes it clear that the president doesnt have
the ability and willingness to lead by rolling up his sleeves and doing
the hard work to reach a consensus that is in the best interest of our
country.
Corker continued, The president is blatantly
ignoring the rule of law and Congress constitutional role, and I
could not be more disappointed. Congress has to respond, but the response
should be prudent and we should not lose sight of the fact that our
job over the next two years is to enact policies that will make our
nation stronger.
On Fox News Channels Americas Newsroom
on Thursday morning, Senator Corker expressed his disappointment in
the presidents decision.

In previous statements, President Obama acknowledged that
he doesnt have the authority to take such unilateral action without
Congress. Speaking about the need to fix our nations broken immigration
system in a 2011 commencement address at Miami Dade College,
President Obama said, I know some here wish that I could just bypass Congress
and change the law myself. But thats not how democracy works
Changing our laws means doing the hard work of changing minds and changing
votes, one by one.
Senator Corker co-authored the
Hoeven-Corker border security amendment, which is the toughest border
security measure to ever pass the Senate. The amendment was approved
overwhelmingly by the Senate in a 69-29 vote and led to the final passage of
the Senate immigration reform bill.
Touring Goodwills Nashville
Facility
Earlier this month, Senator Corker toured Goodwills
downtown Nashville facility to learn how donors gently used clothing and
household items are turned into employment and training opportunities
for thousands of Tennesseans each year.
I am proud of
the inspiring work Goodwill Industries of Middle Tennessee is doing to
impact the lives of so many Tennesseans, and I enjoyed touring their
facility in Nashville. When most people think about Goodwill, they think
about donating clothes, and while thats certainly important, the
work Goodwill is doing for local communities goes so much further, said
Corker. I was particularly touched by their work to provide
opportunities for the disabled and individuals in need to find and maintain
jobs.

Providing Access to Clean Drinking Water without Spending
New Money or Creating New
Bureaucracy
Senator Corker and Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) last week introduced The
Paul Simon Water for the World Act of 2014, bipartisan legislation to
dramatically improve access to clean water and sanitation around the
world without spending new money or creating new
bureaucracy.
With limited foreign aid resources, we need to make each
dollar count. Focusing on lack of access to clean water and sanitation is
one area where we can have a significant impact on the lives of
others. This bill will prioritize our efforts to provide clean water and
improved sanitation to enhance the health and stability of communities
who need it the most around the world, said Corker.
More
than 748 million people around the world lack access to clean, safe
water and nearly 2.5 billion people lack access to basic sanitationmany
living on less than $2 a day. Rapid industrialization and population
and economic growth continue to put pressure on global water supplies,
particularly in developing nations. Water issues are no longer
isolated problems, but are increasingly linked to regional tensions, global
health, child and maternal mortality, and economic
growth.
