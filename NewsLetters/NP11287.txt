Dear Fellow Nevadan,
Four years after
President Obama signed this historic legislation, the
Affordable Care
Act
is living up to its core promise of ensuring access to
affordable, quality health care for every American, regardless of where they
live or how much money they make.
The health reform law is
working. Already, more than 5 million Americans have selected health
insurance plans on the new health insurance marketplaces created by
the
Affordable Care Act . This legislation is helping people
nationwide afford the quality insurance coverage they need. For too many
people, health care coverage used to be utterly unaffordable, and for
those with pre-existing conditions, it was often outright
unattainable. Insurance companies can no longer deny insurance coverage because of
a preexisting condition. And they are also prevented from setting
arbitrary lifetime caps on benefits. Because of this law, small
businesses can receive tax breaks for providing health insurance to their
employees, and millions of Americans are no longer one car accident or
heart attack away from bankruptcy.
Under the
Affordable
Care Act , Nevadas seniors in the Medicare donut hole have saved
almost $56 million on prescription drugs since 2010. Seniors nationwide
will save even more when the donut hole is completely closed in
2020. And, Medicare now covers many preventive services for seniors
without out-of-pocket costs
a benefit that more than 260,000 seniors in
Nevada took advantage of last year.
As a result of the
health reform law, insurance companies now have to spend at least 80 cents
on every dollar they are paid in premiums on direct care for patients,
rather than on profits, advertising, or administrative costs. If they
fail to do so, they must issue rebates. An estimated 88,500 Nevadans
received a rebate last year, resulting in almost $4 million in
savings.
The
Affordable Care Act
makes certain that the
richest nation in the world never again turns its back on the despair,
helplessness, and suffering of the least fortunate among
us.
Unfortunately, many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle
continue to target the benefits guaranteed under this law. If they
have their way, insurance companies will once again be allowed to deny
care to a sick child because he or she has asthma or diabetes. In
Nevada, up to 162,000 children with pre-existing conditions could be at risk
of losing their health care coverage.
If opponents of
health insurance reform have their way, young adults just out of college
will be kicked off their parents insurance plans. Almost 33,000 young
adults in Nevada could be at risk of not having health care
coverage.
Moving forward, I am committed to working to improve the
health reform law. Implementation is a work in progress, but we cannot
go back to the days when insurance companies were allowed to put annual
and lifetime dollar limits on health benefits they would cover, or
drop a beneficiary when they became sick, or treat being a woman as a
pre-existing condition.
