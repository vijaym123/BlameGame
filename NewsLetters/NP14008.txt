Dear
Friend,
As we join
together with family and loved ones this week to celebrate Thanksgiving,
its important to remember the exceptional beginnings of the holiday
and its ongoing significance to our country 237 years
later.
Towards that end, I welcome you to take a moment to read President
George Washingtons original Thanksgiving Proclamation. Passed as a
resolution by the Congress and issued by Washington in 1789, the
Proclamation declared a day of public thanksgiving and prayer for our
young nation. President Washingtons message of gratitude and reflection,
of warmth and togetherness, rings just as true today as it did
then.
God Bless your family this Thanksgiving holiday and God
Bless the United States of
America.
Sincerely,
Tim
Murphy
Member of
Congress
President George Washington's Thanksgiving
Proclamation
1789
Whereas it is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the
providence of Almighty God, to obey His will, to be grateful for His
benefits, and humbly to implore His protection and favor; and Whereas both
Houses of Congress have, by their joint committee, requested me "to
recommend to the people of the United States a day of public
thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the
many and signal favors of Almighty God, especially by affording them
an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of government for their
safety and happiness:"
Now, therefore, I do recommend and assign Thursday, the 26th day of
November next, to be devoted by the people of these States to the service
of that great and glorious Being who is the beneficent author of all
the good that was, that is, or that will be; that we may then all unite
in rendering unto Him our sincere and humble thanks for His kind care
and protection of the people of this country previous to their
becoming a nation; for the signal and manifold mercies and the favorable
interpositions of His providence in the course and conclusion of the late
war; for the great degree of tranquility, union, and plenty which we
have since enjoyed; for the peaceable and rational manner in which we
have been enable to establish constitutions of government for our
safety and happiness, and particularly the national one now lately
instituted for the civil and religious liberty with which we are blessed, and
the means we have of acquiring and diffusing useful knowledge; and, in
general, for all the great and various favors which He has been
pleased to confer upon
us.
And also that we may then unite in most humbly offering our prayers
and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations and beseech
Him to pardon our national and other transgressions; to enable us all,
whether in public or private stations, to perform our several and
relative duties properly and punctually; to render our National
Government a blessing to all the people by constantly being a Government of
wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed
and obeyed; to protect and guide all sovereigns and nations (especially
such as have shown kindness to us), and to bless them with good
governments, peace, and concord; to promote the knowledge and practice of
true religion and virtue, and the increase of science among them and
us; and, generally to grant unto all mankind such a degree of temporal
prosperity as He alone knows to be
best.
Given under my hand, at the city of New York, the
3rd day of October, A.D. 1789.
