Dear
Constituents,
Recently, Congress passed a bipartisan budget bill to
fund the federal government for the remainder of fiscal year 2014.
This bipartisan agreement is a step in the right direction that
eliminates the irresponsible practice of governing crisis to crisis. This bill
provides relief from reckless, job-killing sequester cuts to defense,
medical and scientific research, and other high priority programs. It
also fixes last years cut to the cost of living adjustment for
veterans and their families, ensuring their benefits keep up with
inflation.
As with any negotiated agreement,
it required both Democrats and Republicans to find common ground and
understand that this bill will not reflect the sole priorities of one
party over the other. And while this budget bill does not achieve
everything Id hoped for, I am pleased to see substantial bipartisan
cooperation, and I will continue to work to find pragmatic solutions to our
most pressing
issues.
Putting Seniors
First
Last November, I introduced a
bipartisan bill designed to help protect seniors from healthcare fraud.
The Protecting Seniors from Health Care Fraud Act of 2013 would provide
seniors and caregivers with information regarding health care scams.
This bill requires that scam information be updated and mailed to
seniors with existing quarterly Medicare summary
notices.
Do you support efforts such as the Bipartisan
Budget Deal where Congress comes together to find common ground and
move our nation forward? Yes No Undecided *By answering this survey, you are

As con artists seek to exploit
changes in health care, it is critical that we work to educate and
equip seniors and caregivers with the information necessary to prevent
healthcare fraud. That is why my office is hosting workshops across the
district to get the word out about how seniors can protect themselves
from becoming victims. The next workshop will be held in Hemet and the
details can be found below.
