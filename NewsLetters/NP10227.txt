Dear Friend,
As Texans, we have never been known to be short on pride for our state.
Texas is home to world-renowned research universities, top tier medical
centers, and booming industries, such as energy and manufacturing.
*	Texas ranks #1 in job growth
*
Strongest job growth in the nation between 2000 - 2013
*
3 of the top 10 cities for job seekers are in Texas
*
Texas ranks #1 in technology-related exports
*
$45 billion exported in technology products
*
331,000 jobs
supported by tech exports in Texas
*
Texas has the 13thlargest economy in the world
*
2013 Gross State Product estimated at $1,433.7 billion
*
Home to 52 companies on the Fortune 500 list
As Texas continues to be a trailblazer on a national and global front,
it's important that my colleagues and I in Congress bolster efforts for
job creation and help build an even stronger economy. That's why we
must ensure that folks have the tools and resources they need to be
successful.
The United States Congress must continue investing in job
training and educational opportunities to ensure that hard-working
Texans and all Americans are able to provide a better life for
themselves and their families.
Mexico-United States Entrepreneurship and Innovation Council (MUSEIC)
This week, I had a chance to address the Mexico -United States
Entrepreneurship and Innovation Council (MUSEIC) hosted by the UTSA
Small Business Development Center.
I joined with business leaders from
the U.S. and Mexico to discuss Mexico's efforts to open up its shale
regions to American companies.
By doing so, they would be opening up
opportunities for Texas businesses and workers that have developed the
technology and knowledge to work in the shale fields.
Shale Energy Supply Chain has been transformative for San Antonio,
South Texas and U.S. competitiveness. The economic impact of the Eagle
Ford Shale is already impressive.
*
116,000 new jobs have been created in the region
*
The economic output is estimated at $61 billion so far, with
decades of potential still to be explored
This event was a great opportunity to discuss ways in which the U.S and
its neighbors can prosper together through joint economic efforts and
also illustrate San Antonio's potential as an emerging global city.
I am dedicated to ensuring that my work in Congress strengthens our
nation's economy and expands opportunities for hard-working folks in
Texas and across the country. If my office can ever be helpful, please
do not hesitate to reach out.
Sincerely,
Member of Congress

Use

COMMENT:
Table

do
not

the

is
very
simple

Only
declare
border,

Think
of
the

COMMENT:
The
TD

where
you
can
declare
a

text-alignment
(left/right/centered)

COMMENT:
By

(Division),

in
your

COMMENT:
You
can
override
the
default
TD
style
by
adding
a
style
(bold,
italic,
etc)
to
any
individual
item
(header,
paragraph,
text)
and
it
will
take
priority
over
the
default
style
in
the
TD.
COMMENT:
If
you
examine
the
HTML

you
will
see
how

COMMENT:
Things
to
Avoid:
Microsoft's
Outlook
mail
client
in
particular
has
a
variety
of
style,
size
and
table
attributes
that
it
will
not
render.
COMMENT:
Do
not
use
Table
"cellpadding"
or
Style
"margin-padding"
as
both
are
stripped
out
by
Outlook
2007
and
2010.
COMMENT:
Avoid
tables
that
are
more
than
a
single
"page"
(22
inches
or
1500
pixels)
in
height
because
they
will
leave
mysterious
horizontal
gaps
or
blank
areas
between
content
that
otherwise
should
be
above
and
below
in
relation
to
each
other.
COMMENT:
You
can,
however,
stack
shorter
tables
on
top
of
each
other
to
form
one
very
long
series
of
tables
and
avoid
the

in

it&#8217;s
important
that
my

Mexico-United

This
week,
I
had
a
chance
to
address
the
Mexico
&#8211;United
States
Entrepreneurship
and
Innovation
Council
(MUSEIC)
hosted
by
the
UTSA
Small
Business
Development
Center.
I
joined
with
business
leaders
from
the
U.S.
and
Mexico
to
discuss
Mexico&#8217;s
efforts
to
open
up
its
shale
regions
to
American companies.
By
doing
so,
they
would
be
opening
up
opportunities
for
Texas
businesses
and
workers
that
have
developed
the technology
and
knowledge
to
work
in
the
shale
fields.
Shale
Energy
Supply
Chain
has
been

for
San
Antonio,
South
Texas
and
U.S.
competitiveness.
The
economic
impact
of
the
Eagle
Ford
Shale
is
already
impressive.
116,000
new
jobs
have
been
created
in
the
region T he
economic
output
is
estimated at
$61
billion
so
far,
with
decades
of
potential
still
to
be

This
event
was
a
great
opportunity
to
discuss
ways
in
which
the
U.S
and
its
neighbors
can
prosper
together
through
joint
economic
efforts
and
also
illustrate
San
Antonio&#8217;s
potential
as
an
emerging
global
city.
I
am
dedicated
to
ensuring
that
my
work
in
Congress
strengthens
our
nation&#8217;s
economy
and
expands
opportunities
for
hard-working
folks
in
Texas
and
across
the
country.
If
my

do
not
