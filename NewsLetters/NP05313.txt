Tired of Republicans&rsquo; Obama-bashing attacks? Help us fight back!
Donate $5 or more and your donation will be TRIPLE-MATCHED.
With a few hours until the triple-match expires, here are the stakes:
-- The race for Congress is a DEAD HEAT...the race could go either way!
-- The Koch Brothers dumped an unexpected $1.8 million into our key races
-- Your TV is being flooded with filthy, Obama-bashing ads
The triple-match is our best chance at closing the spending gap, and it&rsquo;s only around temporarily. Don&rsquo;t miss out on this opportunity. This is our chance to mount a STUNNING COMEBACK.
