Dear Friend:
Do you like taking selfies? If
so, you're in luck, because I've just launched an Instagram contest!
Take a selfie in front of your favorite location in New York's 13th
District using #cbrangel and I'll feature it on my Instagram
page!
This year's
Democratic Caucus Member Online All-Star Competition ends in three
days, and my prospects aren't looking so good. I'm lagging behind in the
standings, and I need your help to move back into the Top 25! All you
have to do is this:
Connect with me on Facebook by
liking my page , and follow me on
Twitter
and
Instagram
@cbrangelto get your
favorite Charlie back on track!
Sincerely,
Charles
Rangel
