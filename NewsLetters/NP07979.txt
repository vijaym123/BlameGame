Celebrating Our Liberty
Everyone knows the 4th of July for the signing of the Declaration of
Independence, but fewer know that it was on July 8th that the Liberty
Bell tolled in Philadelphia to summon people to the first public
reading of a document that changed history.
The principles that guided our Founding Fathers are still vital to our
country today-life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
Honoring Vietnam War Era Veterans
America's service men and women paid a heavy price in the Vietnam War,
and we can never thank them enough.
I have had the privilege of honoring our WWII
and Korean War era veterans
for the
past two years, and this year we will have a very special ceremony
honoring all of those who served during the Vietnam War era.
On Saturday, August 2, 2014 at 10 AM
at the First
Baptist Church in Columbia, all Vietnam War era veterans and their
families are invited to come and be recognized, and our doors are open
to all who would like to come and thank them for their service. More
information can be found at www.scott.senate.gov/veterans
or by calling toll-free (844) 820-0146.
Palmetto Wednesdays
Every Wednesday when the Senate is in session
, I invite
South Carolinians to come to my office in Washington at 11 AM for great
conversations and some southern hospitality. We make plenty of real
sweet tea, put out some potato chips that were proudly made in South
Carolina, and look forward to meeting constituents.
Please contact my
office at (202) 224-6121 for more information or to let us know you'll
be joining us!
I appreciate hearing your thoughts, ideas, and concerns-please do not
hesitate to contact my office. For more frequent updates on my work in
