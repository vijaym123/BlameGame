Dear Friend:
In response to a recent Supreme Court decision
that left the restitution process for victims of
child pornography incomplete; I joined with Sen.
Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) this week to introduce the
Amy and Vicky Child Pornography Victim
Restitution Improvement Act. This bill
creates an effective, balanced restitution
process for victims of child pornography.
This bill responds to the Supreme
Courts decision in
Paroline v. United States .
Amy and Vicky are the
victims in two of the most-widely distributed
child pornography series in the world.
Victims of child pornography suffer a unique
kind of harm and deserve a unique restitution
process, and the Amy and Vicky Act is that
solution. In the
Paroline
decision, the Supreme Court made
it clear that the ball was in Congress
court in order to give child pornography victims
the tools necessary to seek restitution from
those responsible for perpetuating this heinous
crime. I am proud to have the support of
Amy, Vicky, and so many individuals and
organizations who seek to work with me and other
supporters of this bill to strengthen the voice
of child pornography victims.
The Amy and Vicky Act does three things to
reflect the nature of child pornography
crimes:
It considers the total harm to the victim,
including from individuals who may not yet have
been identified;
It requires real and timely restitution;
and
It allows defendants who have contributed
to the same victims harm to spread the
restitution cost among themselves.
If you would like to know more about this
important legislation, a one-page summary of the
legislation can be found
here ,
and the bill text can be found
here .
In addition if you would like to read letters of
support from
Amy
or from
Vicky ,
please click on their names.
Child pornography is a crime that
unfortunately damages too many families across
our country, and I will continue to do everything
in my power to seek to redress the dangerous
fall-out from these crimes.
Thank you for your interest.
Sincerely,
Orrin Hatch
