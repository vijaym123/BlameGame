&#8211; Today, U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10) visited Marine City to learn about the ongoing and future development projects that have helped increase the city&#8217;s economic and cultural attraction.
&#8220;I am encouraged by the continued rejuvenation of an area with such historic charm. The preservation of its historic landmarks and proposed development will help maintain the city&#8217;s attraction,&#8221;
Miller stated after her visit.
&#8220;The proposed renovations and projects will ensure the economic revitalization of local businesses, creating a renewed, culturally vibrant downtown. I will continue to support the preservation of Marine City&#8217;s unique heritage
and the resurgence of its economic vitality.&#8221;
