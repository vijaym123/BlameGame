Rep. Bob Goodlatte
Greater Accountability Needed at the Federal Reserve
A key part
of good government is accountability to the taxpayers. We have seen in the recent IRS targeting scandal just what can happen when government officials
and agencies are not held accountable. The Federal Reserve, or Fed, should not be excluded from this accountability. The Federal Reserve is the
central bank of the United States and has a unique role in our financial system. The monetary policy decisions of the Federal Reserve affect every
American. However, it has been subject to very little federal scrutiny since its creation.
You have a right to know how the government spends and leverages your taxpayer dollars. It is fundamental that we provide stronger
oversight of the Federal Reserve. On September 17, the House of Representatives passed, with my strong support, H.R. 24, the
Federal Reserve
Transparency Act . This legislation, which I cosponsored, would shine light on the Federal Reserve System by requiring the Government
Accountability Office to complete an audit of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks and to submit to Congress a detailed report of
audit findings and conclusions. This audit must be completed within one year and submitted to Congress no more than 90 days after completion.
A Rasmussen Reports survey from November 2013 found that 74 percent of adult
Americans favor auditing the Fed and making the results available to the public. The House&rsquo;s bipartisan vote of 333-92 in support of the
Federal Reserve Transparency Act
makes it clear that there is broad support of auditing the Fed in Congress. But before we can audit the Fed,
there is still a roadblock standing in the way &ndash; the U.S. Senate.
The House has acted to bring true transparency to our nation&rsquo;s monetary policy. Now the question remains, will the Senate stop stalling and join
the House in holding the Federal Reserve accountable to the American people?

Attorney General Eric Holder to Resign
On Thursday, Attorney
General Eric Holder announced that he will resign from his post. I welcome the news that he will step down as Attorney General.
From Operation
Fast and Furious to his misleading testimony before the House Judiciary Committee regarding the Department&rsquo;s dealings with members of the media
and his refusal to appoint a special counsel to investigate the IRS&rsquo; targeting of conservative groups, Mr. Holder has consistently played
partisan politics with many of the important issues facing the Justice Department.
I hope that the next Attorney General will take seriously his role as the nation&rsquo;s top law enforcement officer, working with Congress
to ensure that the laws of our land are followed instead of being a roadblock on the path to justice.
