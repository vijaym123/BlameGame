Here to Help
Congressman
Langevin
with
Providence
Councilwoman
Matos
Dear Friends,
In my travels, I often meet Rhode Islanders who are facing hardship. A
senior who hasn't received the Social Security benefits he is owed. A
recent college graduate who is struggling to repay her student loan. A
veteran who is unaware of the services available, or even where to
start. These are honest, hardworking people who are unsure of where to
turn for assistance. But they are not alone, and I want to get the word
out to the people of the Second District that my office is here to
help.
What many of my constituents do not realize is that my staff is not
dedicated solely to researching policy or writing legislation. While
that is the focus of my Washington, D.C. office
, my staff in Rhode Island is willing
and eager to assist you with an array of issues involving federal
agencies
. Emily can help you navigate
the immigration process, and handles issues that arise with the IRS.
Johanna can help you resolve issues with the Social Security
Administration, and is also available to talk to students dealing with
federal education agencies. Joe works closely with small businesses, as
well as the Federal Emergency Management Agency. And if you need help
with veterans' benefits, unemployment, Medicare or other health care
agencies, Nancy is the person to call.
These compassionate, hardworking caseworkers spend countless hours
assisting residents of the Second District. I am so proud of the work
they do, and am always touched to hear the stories of the lives they
have impacted. If you are unsure if my office can be of assistance,
don't hesitate to pick up the phone and call. At the very least, we
might be able to point you in the right direction.
We look forward to hearing from you! Contact my office at (401)
732-9400 or learn more about the work we do by following me on Twitter
, Facebook
, YouTube
and Flickr
. And if you have not heard, I am now on
Instagram
!

Getting Results
In December, my office got a phone call from the family of a Rhode
Island veteran who had just lost his wife. At an already-difficult
time, he couldn't get confirmation of his eligibility for burial in the
Veterans Cemetery. Without confirmation, he could not lay his wife to
rest in the place of honor that she deserved. Thankfully, Johanna was
able to expedite the paperwork process and resolve the problem in a
matter of days, giving that veteran and his family peace of mind.
