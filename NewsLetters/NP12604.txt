Please see below for Congressman Lamborn's latest op-ed
running nationally in
The Hill
and locally in
The
Colorado Springs Gazette .
America Suffers Under a Do-Nothing
Senate
When anyone says its a
do-nothing Congress, they are only half right.
Its actually a
do-nothing Senate.
In this
Congress, the House has passed and sent over to the Senate 253
bills.
In stark contrast, the Senate has sent to the House 63
bills.
The Senate produces only one quarter of what the House
does.
I am not saying that
passing bills is in and of itself an unalloyed good. (See the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare) But if you are
wanting to critique who is doing the actual work of legislating, counting
bills is where you start.
From the House Natural Resources Committee on which I serve, we have
passed six bills opening up American energy that would create over one
million new jobs, lower gasoline and electricity prices, reduce our
dependence on foreign oil, and help lower our national debt by
generating over one billion dollars in new revenue.
These bills are now
stalled in the Senate.
The U.S. Senate has become a productivity graveyard.
President
Obama signed only 16 Senate bills into law in 2013. Since summer, while
House Republicans have allowed minority Democrats to offer 71 recorded
amendments, Senate Democrats have allowed Republicans only
four.
Senate Democrats seem only
concerned with protecting themselves from taking votes that might
anger their liberal donors or their voters. They do this by closing off
debate, eliminating amendments, changing Senate rules meant to protect
the minority, and writing their bills in secret, shutting out
Republican voices and input.
This
broken and dysfunctional Democrat Senate has created numerous disasters for
the American people, and not just Obamacare. They also passed the
trillion dollar so-called Stimulus Act, refused for four years to pass a
Budget, and allowed the President to balloon the national debt in five
short years from $10 trillion to $17
trillion.
Dont let the President or Harry Reid fool you
with a false narrative that those rascally Republicans are holding up
the nations business.
This is just another ploy to shift the
blame away from where it truly
lies.
Our country deserves better. Bills that would grow our
economy and put millions of our friends and neighbors back to work should
never die in the abyss of the Democrat Senate. It is critical for
every single American to let Senate Democrats know that theyre sick and
tired of the do-nothing Senate.
