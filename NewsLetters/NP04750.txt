I often email you when we&rsquo;re near a critical milestone. But this is the final deadline -- and it&rsquo;s the most important.
Friend -- I often email you when we&rsquo;re near a critical milestone.
But this is the final deadline -- and it&rsquo;s the most important.
The Senate election tomorrow will be among the closest in recent history.
Polls show Democrats can keep the Senate -- but a dozen or so races are still neck and neck.
I need your help today to fund last-minute Get Out The Vote efforts in these too-close-to-call states. I&rsquo;ll be frank: we need to contact every last voter to have a chance.
Will you pitch in before midnight? Every gift will be triple-matched and immediately rushed to battlegrounds that will decide who controls the Senate.
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
We can&#39;t afford to do nothing and hope others will make the difference.
Your gift could save our Senate majority -- but this is your only opportunity left to help.
We can&#39;t wait for later.
There is no later.
Please pitch in to protect the Democratic Senate in the next 15 hours. It will be triple-matched.
Let&rsquo;s go!
Barack Obama
P.S. Tomorrow is Election Day, so I want to thank you today for all your hard work. I appreciate it so much.
Now, let&rsquo;s win this together.
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
Thank you for your continued support.
