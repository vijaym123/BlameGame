Dear Friend,
The U.S. House of Representatives passed a spending bill that provides funding for nearly all of the governments operations through the end of the fiscal year, September 30, 2015. The exception is the Department of Homeland Security, which will receive funding through a Continuing Resolution for less than 90 days, expiring on February 27, 2015.
Under the agreement, overall discretionary spending has been reduced by $165 billion since Fiscal Year 2010.
The legislation passed with a bipartisan vote of 219 to 206. I voted in favor of the bill.
We plan to build on this progress with additional meaningful cuts and changes when Congress returns in January with Republicans majorities in the House and the Senate.
