15th District Update
Dear Neighbor,
Today we celebrate the heroes who fought in the Revolutionary War and moved our ambitious nation forward to one of independence. The right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness were published with the Declaration of Independence on July 4 th , 1776; and as John Adams once predicted, the July anniversary would be celebrated by succeeding generations.
Francis Scott Key penned the poem we now sing with confidence and courage, the same courage put forth today by our hard-working families and dedicated service members. Two hundred years after Key scribed the Star Spangled Banner, our troops still serve and defend the freedom of our independent nation. Today we celebrate the feat from 1776, and remain in debt to Americas finest; our service members and veterans.
As we celebrate Americas birthday with our neighbors, let us all thank the men and women in the military, as well as their families. It is because of the selfless sacrifice by our generations past, present, and future that we can quote the final line to our National Anthem, Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave."
Have a happy and safe July 4th!
