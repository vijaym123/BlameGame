Hi
Friend,
On Tuesday, June 16 at 5 p.m. PT, I
will be hosting a telephone townhall meeting with special guest Paul
Ryan , Chairman of the Ways &amp; Means
Commitee.
We'd like to call you so we can talk with you about some of our
most pressing issues, like water, our ag economy, the budget, tax
reform, immigration reform, and our continued efforts to care for our
veterans. You'll have a chance to ask me and Chairman Ryan any question
you'd like and share your views on pending legislation with
us.
Would you like to participate?
