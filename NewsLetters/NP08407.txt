This week I had the opportunity to participate in a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing regarding the exchange of five high level Taliban jihadists for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Like all Americans, I'm glad that Sgt. Bergdahl is safe and back in America. Many have expressed concerns about the situation leading up to his capture. Like all service members, Sgt. Bergdahl is entitled to a fair investigation and due process to determine exactly what happened leading up to his capture.
However, we do know that all five of the detainees exchanged for Sgt. Bergdahl were deemed a high risk to the U.S. and its allies.
In fact, James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, flat out rejected the release of the five detainees, saying there was too high a risk that these Taliban commanders would return to the battlefield and orchestrate attacks against Americans.

The 2014 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) says the President shall notify Congress not later than 30 days before the transfer or release of any Guantanamo Bay inmate. President Obama did not notify Congress before he freed these five Taliban prisoners from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Sgt. Bergdahl. I agree with Democrat Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, that the President violated the law by not properly informing Congress of the details of the prisoner exchange.
Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates always thought it was a bad idea to negotiate with terrorists or other hostage-takers because it would set a precedent that puts all American personnel operating in war zones in extra danger. I agree with Secretary Gates that it sets a dangerous precedent for Americans abroad. A recent TIME Magazine interview with a Taliban commander made clear that this policy has emboldened the Taliban. The commander said, It has encouraged our people. Now everybody will work hard to capture such an important bird. Statements like these make it clear that the House needs to thoroughly investigate whether trading Sgt. Bergdahl for five high level jihadists further endangers our troops, diplomatic personnel, and Americans abroad.
Sincerely,
Scott G. Perry
