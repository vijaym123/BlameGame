Commemorating U.S. Forest
Officer Jason Crisp
This week I
introduced legislation, along with the entire North Carolina House
delegation, to commemorate U.S. Forest Officer Jason Crisp by designating
a Ranger Station in Nebo, North Carolina as the "Jason Crisp Forest
Service Building" in his honor. Officer Crisp was killed in the line of
duty last month while on a manhunt in pursuit of a homicide suspect.
My prayers continue to be with his family and the community for their
great loss.

Standing Up for American
Workers
This week I voted in favor of the
bipartisan
Save American Workers
Act ,
a bill that restores the 40-hour full-time work week. It
will protect millions of Americans from having their working hours
slashed and seeing reduced wages as a result of a new rule put in place by
the Affordable Care Act--Obamacare. The president's health care
law redefined the full-time work week from 40-hours to 30-hours, putting
an estimated 2.6 million people at risk of having their hours
reduced. Three quarters of Americans are currently living
paycheck-to-paycheck. Every day I hear from my constituents in North Carolina about their
struggles to make ends meet. This new rule puts millions of already
vulnerable American families at risk. We can't afford to bear the
unintended consequences of President Obama's unworkable health care
law.
Visiting Around the
Community
One of my favorite
things to do as a member of Congress is visit with local business and
community leaders. This past week, I had the privilege of stopping by
Wright Table Company's, a Burke County-based top quality furniture
manufacturer that's been in business since 1971. Don Wright and his staff
pride themselves in making high-quality, hand-crafted
furniture.
On Monday, I visited
with Caldwell County's emergency service personnell at North Catawba
Fire and Rescue. These brave individuals put their lives at risk to serve
their community. I'm truly grateful for all they do. On Monday,
Debbie and I visited Hibriten High School and had the opportunity to
swing by several classes and visit with students and
faculty.
I also traveled to
Lenoir to tour Baker Waste Equipment's(BWE) new location. BWE is a
leading manufacturer of waste hauling products that recently chose to
relocate bringing 40 new jobs to Caldwell County. BWE prides itself in
providing customers with, "the right equipment for the right price with
exceptional service."

My Prayers
are with Fort Hood
This week our nation
was hit with the tragic news of another shooting at Fort Hood, TX. For
many, the wounds were still fresh from the 2009 shooting on the
military base. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their
families.
Meeting with representatives from Concerned Veterans For
America
One of my
greatest honors as a Congressman is getting the opportunity to meet
with servicemen and women, as well as veterans. My office has an
open-door policy for those who've served to bring their thoughts and concerns
to my attention. Earlier this week, I met with members of
Concerned Veterans for America and military families from North
Carolina in my office to hear their concerns and goals for the future.
It's the responsibility of Congress and the American people to support
our veterans. It's always an honor to have the opportunity to meet with
them.
