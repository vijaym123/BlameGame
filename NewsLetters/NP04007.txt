Hi everybody.
My name is Ben Ray Luj&aacute;n. As you may have heard, I&rsquo;m the new Chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. And I want to loop you in on something pretty cool.
Right now, my team is preparing our strategy for 2016. This is when we start to think about the issues we&rsquo;ll make a top priority, and the campaign strategies that will help Democrats win.
There are so many exciting ideas I want to share to rebuild our middle class and the heart of America, but first I want to hear from you. Click here to answer our 2016 issue survey and tell us what matters most to you: http://action.dccc.org/2016-Priorities-Survey
Thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts. Looking forward to working with you!
