Congressional Report -- March 3-7: Del Rioan and Iraq Vet Joins Team
Hello Friend,
A strong cold front that swept the nation got the week off to a slow
start, but after the cold "moved in and out," it was action packed. I
spent part of the week in Washington and headed back to Texas on
Thursday. Field Representatives were busy throughout the Congressional
District. Matt Hall visited Gillette Elementary in Harlandale ISD along
with Texas State Teacher's Association representatives where they
highlighted literacy initiatives. Cynthia Martinez received a briefing
from the Del Rio Border Patrol Sector regarding efforts to protect our
border. Julie Morton presented Congressional Certificates of
Recognition to Alpine High School students for mentoring and tutoring
younger students. Here's a quick wrap up of the week.

Gregorio "Greg" Talamantez IV is interning in the Washington Office
through the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute (CHCI) program. He
graduated from Del Rio High School in 2004 and played football for the
Del Rio Rams. Following family tradition, Greg joined the U.S. Army.
While on active duty, Greg went from being a paralegal to a member of
the Army's elite bomb disposal community (Explosive Ordnance Disposal).
He served two tours in Iraq. As a member of the Army Bomb Squad, he was
trusted to apply his expertise and knowledge in high-risk, zero-fail
circumstances. In April of 2013, after eight years of honorable
service, Greg separated from the Army.
I welcome Greg to a dynamic team of talented staff - he fits right into
our mission of service and he will be a great asset on issues before
the House Armed Services Committee, on which I serve, and on veterans'
issues.
Mobile Office Hours for March
Staff members Matt Hall, Cynthia Martinez, Selene Gomez, Nancy Zeh and
Julie Morton will be visiting 13 counties during the month of March to
help constituents with casework before federal agencies and
departments. I'll be calling constituents on the phone and inviting you
to visit them at any of the Mobile Offices. For a complete list of

23 in 1 Series: Crystal City
Several days ago, I highlighted Crystal City, Texas, the Spinach
Capital of the World, during the "23 in 1" Series. While on the floor
of the House, I take viewers and listeners on a quick one minute
journey through the 23rd District of Texas. The speeches take place
while the House is in session and are broadcast on local C-SPAN

Border Communities Receive Federal Grants for Environment Studies and
Projects
A total of $191,845 are headed to the 23rd District of Texas for
studies and projects that will help the environment. The federal funds
are made available through the Environmental Protection Agency.
Protecting and improving the water we drink, the air we breathe and the
world we live in is important to me. These funds allow us to be
proactive about issues affecting our communities - by studying,
learning and finding new methods to care for the world we live in while
raising our families in a safe and sound environment. For a full list
of projects and funding, click here
.
Co-Sponsor CAL Network Act in Support of Undiagnosed Diseases Research
On Feb. 28, Rare Disease Day, I co-sponsored H.R. 1591, CAL Undiagnosed
Diseases Research and Collaboration Network Act of 2013. This
bipartisan bill would amend the Public Health Service Act to establish
an undiagnosed diseases network. To read more about the bill, click

Lastly, thanks again for letting me be your congressman. If I can help
you with a federal agency or issue, please call on any of our offices.
The phone numbers and addresses are listed below. I've never been a big
fan of politics - helping people is my favorite part of the job. Please
put us to work for you.
Sincerely,
Pete P. Gallego
