Dear Friend,
Over the holidays, I hope you have time to celebrate with family and
friends. This time of year, it is important to remember the true spirit
of the season, and be thankful for our loved ones and all that we have
been given.
As we begin a new year, we have the opportunity to create real
solutions to some of our nation's problems, and grow our economy so
Americans can get back to work. I look forward to hearing from you as
we work together towards these goals.
>From my family to yours, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
