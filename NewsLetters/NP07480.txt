Dear Friend,
Today is our last day to reach our $35,000 goal, and as of right now, we&rsquo;re still about $3,450 short.
We&rsquo;ve fought too hard and for too long to let the Tea Party take control of the Senate in this year&rsquo;s elections. They&rsquo;re only six seats away, and it&rsquo;s up to us to make sure that Massachusetts isn&rsquo;t one of them. Help me stay strong against the Tea Party and their gridlock tactics -- give $5 before midnight and help us reach our $35,000 goal.

Thanks to Tea Party obstructionists, we have a long list of challenges we haven&rsquo;t tackled yet. But November is another opportunity to turn that around. If we can beat the Tea Party back, we have a chance to make some real progress for the middle class. And that&rsquo;s up to you. Your contributions give this campaign the fuel it needs, and your contributions will help us reach our $35,000 goal for July. Chip in $5, $10, or more if you can.
Thank you.
