Dear Friends,
Recently I had the privilege of laying a wreath at the Tomb of the
Unknown Solider at Arlington National Cemetery and the honor of
delivering remarks to veterans at the World War II Memorial on the 69th
anniversary of Victory in Europe Day in Washington with the
granddaughter of President Eisenhower. The WWII event had personal
meaning as well. I carried a photo of my Dad, who flew 32 bombing
missions including the largest bombing mission in U.S. history in
support of the D-Day invasion. He was, and is, my hero. In the spirit
of paying tribute to all of our fallen our veterans on this Memorial
Day weekend, I invite you to watch my speech at the WWII Memorial from
VE Day.
VE Day Speech at World War II Memorial
This week the House of Representatives sent legislation that I
introduced
to the
president's desk that
will award the nation's highest civilian honor, the Congressional Gold
Medal, to the World War II members of the Civil Air Patrol. The Civil
Air Patrol's valiant efforts in defending our coastline, providing
combat services, and flying dangerous humanitarian missions in America
during World War II embodies the American spirit of volunteerism. I am
proud Congress has taken this step to recognize all of the important
work the Civil Air Patrol did nearly 70 years after its founding.
Last week I led a bipartisan Congressional delegation to several
countries: Turkey, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and
Afghanistan. It was a successful trip that examined the security issues
surrounding the crisis in Syria and the threat that foreign fighters
pose to the homeland. The delegation also visited with refugees in the
region, and while in Afghanistan, met with the troops to thank them for
their service, and discussed the need for a bilateral security
agreement with the Afghani government.
Legislative Update
This week the House also passed several other important pieces of
legislation. I was proud to support the USA Freedom Act
, which ends the bulk
collection of Americans' phone records by the National Security Agency.
This legislation allows the important work of protecting our homeland
from terrorist attacks to continue while also ensuring Americans'
privacy is protected.
I also supported the VA Management Accountability Act
that will allow the
Secretary of Veterans' Affairs to fire or demote senior or executive
employees based solely on performance. In the wake of the recent VA
health care scandals in Texas and around the country, senior officials
at the VA must be held accountable for their actions.
The House also passed the National Defense Authorization bill
for the 2015 fiscal year,
which I supported. This bill rejects the president's cuts to our troops
and ensures that our military has the resources and funding it needs to
protect our nation.

In

I
led
a

Congressional

to
several
countries:
Turkey,
Jordan,
Saudi

the
United
Arab

and
Afghanistan.
It
was
a

that
examined
the
