Dear Friends,
Our country was
founded on the principles of freedom of speech and of expression. Art
has long been used to show our hopes and dreams, our desire to improve
our country and to enlighten the public discourse. The works of art
that have produced thoughtful discussion and debate are too numerous to
count. It is only fitting that we continue this proud tradition by
encouraging the next generation of artists.
This month, I have
the privilege of sponsoring the Congressional Art Competition for my
district. The Congressional Art Competition began in 1982 to provide
an opportunity for Members of Congress to encourage and recognize the
artistic talents of their young constituents. Since then, over 650,000
high school students have been involved with the nationwide
competition.
Every year, talented South Florida high school students
submit artwork for this important and fun competition that culminates
with the winners work of art being selected to be displayed in the
corridors of the Capitol complex in Washington, DC. There are many
outstanding entries submitted and many students artwork are also selected
to hang in my Washington, DC or Miami offices to proudly showcase
South Floridas developing artistic talent.
Artworks entered in
the contest may be up to 28 inches by 28 inches and may be up to 4
inches in depth and not more than 15 pounds (all dimension and weight
limitations include the frame). The artwork may
be:
Paintings - including oil,
acrylics, and
watercolor
Drawings - including pastels, colored pencil, pencil,
charcoal, ink, and
markers
Collage (two-dimensional
only)
Prints - including lithographs,
silkscreen, and block
prints
Mixed
Media
Computer-generated
Art
Photography
All
entries must be an original in concept, design, and execution, and must not
violate U.S. copyright law. Work entered must be in the original
medium (no scanned reproductions). Artwork will be displayed in the Capitol
for the entire year of the exhibition and cannot be returned to
students earlier.
To submit artwork before this competition, you
can drop it off on or before 12pm on Friday, April 24, at my Miami
office at 4960 SW 72 Avenue, Suite 208, Miami, FL 33155 or bring your
artwork to the Congressional Art Competition ceremony on Saturday, April
25, at 12 noon at Miami Highs Media Center, 2450 SW 1st St, Miami,
FL 33135. For more information, please call my office at 202-225-3931
or email

Our nations history of artistic excellence is something we should
all be proud of and work to continue. Only through fully expressing
ourselves can we continue to be a vibrant and diverse democracy. The
next generation of artists has inherited an impressive mantle but I am
confident that they are up to the challenge. I look forward to seeing
this years submissions and enjoying so many examples of South
Floridas artistic talent!
Sincerely,
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
Member of
Congress
