OBAMACARE HURTS
SENIORS
Medicare
Advantage Payments Cut by 14% for Local
Residents
Charlotte Observer, Tuesday, November 18,
2014
Did you see the
headline in Tuesday's
Charlotte
Observer ?
Medicare Changes Wallop Seniors
Private
Plans for Thousands Will Be Eliminated or Will Cost Much
More
According to the
Observer,
"North Carolina
seniors who choose private Medicare policies are seeing an unusual level
of turmoil this year, with more than 57,000 notified their plans won't
be offered in 2015 and others seeing rates more than
triple."
Sadly, many North Carolina seniors are now in the crosshairs of
Obamacare.
Thanks to
Obamacare:
Medicare Advantage payments in Mecklenburg, Iredell, and Union
are being cut by almost 14 percent
Obamacare-related
cuts to Medicare Advantage equal more than $1400 per local
senior
President Obama's health care law will ultimately cut $156
billion from the popular Medicare Advantage
program
How does President Obama sleep at night, knowing his signature domestic
policy achievement is causing so much pain for so many American
families?
Last year, I became the first Member of
Congress from North Carolina to co-sponsor comprehensive legislation to
replace Obamacare:
Tax incentives to make it
more affordable for families to purchase health care of their choice,
instead of penalties for not purchasing President Obama's choice for
their health insurance
Protection for pre-existing
conditions
Portability
Malpractice reform,
which will lower costs through fewer unnecessary
tests
Lowering costs by allowing health insurance to be sold across state
lines, just like car insurance
This legislation faced a
stonewall from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, but with a
Republican Senate majority in 2015, we are making plans to advance common
sense legislation to protect Americans from the most damaging effects of
Obamacare.
President Obama's health care law was built on
efforts to mislead the American people and bypass Congressional
safeguards.
Now is the time for President Obama to admit his mistake and
work with Congress on honest solutions for hardworking American
families.
