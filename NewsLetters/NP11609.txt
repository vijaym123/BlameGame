The President's Budget: An Opportunity to Lead
A presidential budget is many things. It is a chance for the President
to declare his priorities, to highlight his initiatives, and to offer
reforms of how our government does business. But most importantly of
all, it is a chance for the President to lead on the fiscal issues of
the day. We certainly need that leadership now.
I discussed the budget on Fox News Sunday here
.
In a time of record long-term unemployment and unprecedented debt, what
we need are pro-growth policies that will create jobs and reforms that
will result in responsible reductions in our long-term deficits.
Instead, President Obama's budget includes hundreds of billions of
dollars in new spending, $1.2 trillion in job-killing taxes, and $8.3
trillion in new debt.
That's not the kind of budget that's going to spur growth. It's not the
kind of budget that's going to get people back in a job or businesses
hiring again.
The new taxes contained in this budget will make it harder to create
jobs, not easier. They will stifle growth, not encourage it.
This is a missed opportunity. Republicans and Democrats may disagree on
a lot of things, but the American people need us to come together to
find a way to get this economy moving again. So instead of arguing
about a budget that we all know isn't going anywhere, I would propose
we use this time to get some things done for the American people.
And real things, too. Now is not the time for political gimmicks. So
instead of playing games, let's spend this year getting things done.
Let's reform worker retraining in this country so that the 47
government retraining programs actually work the way they are supposed
to and get the unemployed in the jobs that are available. Let's give
the President the ability to knock down barriers to trade and put
products stamped "Made in America" in stores around the world and
create jobs right here at home. Let's pass bipartisan energy efficiency
legislation that will conserve resources and save manufacturers money
that they can reinvest in their industry and in this country.
And then let's approve the Keystone Pipeline so we can create jobs and
speed the day when North America will be energy independent.
Those should be the easy things. Then we can get to work reforming our
tax code, balancing our budget, and fixing a broken healthcare system
that has only been made worse by Obamacare.
Unlike the President's budget, these are serious proposals that people
around this country support. And unlike the President's budget, they
can help get American workers back in a job and American families back
on their feet.
Let's make them happen. Let's start today.
The federal government holds 77,700 buildings that it classifies as not
fully utilized. Many of these buildings are totally vacant, while
others are partially used with additional space that could be rented
out. Still others are in conditions better suited for demolition.
Rather than sell, rent out, or demolish these properties, however,
Washington spends $1.67 billion annually operating and maintaining
them. Why? Because it has enacted a series of roadblocks that makes
unloading these properties nearly impossible.
According to the Congressional Research Service
, an agency looking to
unload unneeded property must first offer it to state and local
governments as well as qualified nonprofit organizations - often at a
discounted price or even for free. If that fails, a lengthy and
cumbersome process must be undertaken before the building can be listed
for sale on the open market or demolished.
With Washington running pushing the national debt over $17 trillion,
you would think such a commonsense initiative as selling, renting, or
demolishing unused federal property would be a no-brainer. Instead of
selling off expensive real estate that the government does not need and
cannot afford, the federal government is wasting your tax dollars and
adding to our soaring spending and debt by maintaining under-utilized
and vacant buildings.

Budget:
An
Opportunity
to
Lead
A
presidential
budget
is
many
things.
It
is
a
chance
for
the
President
to
declare
his
priorities,
to
highlight
his
initiatives,
and
to
offer
reforms
of
how
our
government
does
business.
But
most
importantly
of
all,
it
is
a
chance
for
the
President
to
lead
on
the
fiscal
issues
of
the
day.
We
certainly
need
that
leadership
now.
I
discussed
the
budget
on
Fox

Sunday
here .
In
a
time
of
record
long-term
unemployment
and
unprecedented
debt,
what
we
need
are
pro-growth
policies
that
will
create
jobs
and
reforms
that
will
result
in
responsible
reductions
in
our
long-term
deficits.
Instead,
President
Obama&#8217;s
budget
includes
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
in
new
spending, $1.2
trillion
in
job-killing
taxes,
and
$8.3
trillion
in
new
debt.
That&#8217;s
not
the
kind
of
budget
that&#8217;s
going
to
spur
growth.
It&#8217;s
not
the
kind
of
budget
that&#8217;s
going
to
get
people
back
in
a
job
or
businesses
hiring
again.
The
new
taxes
contained
in
this
budget
will
make
it
harder
to
create
jobs,
not
easier.
They
will
stifle
growth,
not
encourage
it.
This
is
a
missed
opportunity.
Republicans
and
Democrats
may
disagree
on
a
lot
of
things,
but
the
American
people
need
us
to
come
together
to
find
a
way
to
get
this
economy
moving
again.
So
instead
of
arguing
about
a
budget
that
we
all
know
isn&#8217;t
going
anywhere,
I
would
propose
we
use
this
time
to
get
some
things
done
for
the
American
people.
And
real
things,
too.
Now
is
not
the
time
for
political
gimmicks.
So
instead
of
playing
games,
let&#8217;s
spend this
year
getting things
done.
Let&#8217;s
reform
worker
retraining
in
this
country
so
that
the
47
government
retraining
programs
actually
work
the
way
they
are
supposed
to
and
get
the
unemployed
in
the
jobs
that
are
available.
Let&#8217;s
give
the
President
the
ability
to
knock
down
barriers
to
trade
and
put
products
stamped
&#8220;Made
in
America&#8221;
in
stores
around
the
world
and
create
jobs
right
here
at
home.
Let&#8217;s
pass
bipartisan
energy
efficiency
legislation
that
will
conserve
resources
and
save
manufacturers
money
that
they
can
reinvest
in
their
industry
and
in
this
country.
And
then
let&#8217;s
approve
the
Keystone
Pipeline
so
we
can
create
jobs
and
speed
the
day
when
North
America
will
be
energy
independent.
Those
should
be
the
easy
things.
Then
we
can
get
to
work
reforming
our
tax
code,
balancing
our
budget,
and
fixing
a
broken
healthcare
system
that
has
only
been
made
worse
by
Obamacare.
Unlike
the
President&#8217;s
budget,
these
are
serious
proposals
that
people
around
this
country
support.
And
unlike
the
President&#8217;s
budget,
they
can
help
get
American
workers
back
in
a
job
and
American
families
back
on
their

Let&#8217;s

Let&#8217;s

today.

Many

are
totally

while
others
are
partially

with
additional
space
that
could
be
rented

Still
others
are
in
conditions
better

Rather
than
sell,
rent
out,
or

these
properties,
however,
Washington

$1.67

Why?
Because
it

maintaining
