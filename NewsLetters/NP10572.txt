Wisdom of the District: Russia and Ukraine
News reports indicate that Russia is building up troops on the border with eastern Ukraine, just weeks after Russia
annexed
Crimea. The United States has responded by issuing sanctions against Russian leaders, bringing military assets to the region in support of Eastern European allies, and offering aid to Ukraine.
How concerned are you about the situation in Ukraine?
( ) Very concerned
Russia has proven itself to be persistent in its efforts to move into neighboring territories.
I fear that additional Russian aggression could create civil war and ultimately draw the United States into another costly conflict.
( ) Mildly concerned
I dont believe Russia poses a grave threat to the United States, but I do worry about how the conflict will affect U.S. troop deployments, gas prices, and travel restrictions.
( ) Not concerned at all.
Russia is not the superpower it once was and cannot withstand the international pressure it now faces to deescalate the situation.
( ) I havent been following the situation.
( ) I have another answer.
