Dear Friend,
When I first ran for Senate, I had seen what the Tea Party did to the House. I was under the impression that things would be a little different in the Senate -- that calmer heads would prevail and we&rsquo;d be able to make some progress. The opposite has been true , and I&rsquo;ve learned that legislative paralysis is exactly what the Republicans want. It&rsquo;s part of their long-term plan to prove that government can&rsquo;t get anything done,
and we can&rsquo;t afford another two years of this. The GOP&rsquo;s political games have come at a real cost for our middle class. We need to elect a Senate that will actually do its job, not simply grandstand -- help do your part by giving $5 towards our final monthly goal.

Or donate another amount.
It wasn&rsquo;t that long ago that Senators and Congressmen routinely reached across the aisle and hammered out compromises. And even in the midst of Tea Party gridlock, we&rsquo;ve managed to bring forward some good bills, only to see them get blocked by an extremely vocal minority.
Now, the &ldquo;Party of No&rdquo; is on the verge of taking over the Senate -- and I&rsquo;m worried. Worried about what this means for job creation, worried about what this means for action on climate change, and worried if our organizers will have the resources they need in the final days of this campaign. Give our organizers and volunteers a grassroots boost by chipping in $5 today.
Thank you for your support.
