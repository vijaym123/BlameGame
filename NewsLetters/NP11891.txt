Holding the IRS
Accountable
What happens when one voices opposition to big
government?
The answer to that question is one we explored in an op-ed published on
Monday in the Washington Examiner. As the House of Representatives
voted this week to stop the IRS from issuing regulations to unfairly
target certain American citizens for practicing their freedom of speech,
our op-ed explored this issue further:
In November, the IRS announced that it would
completely transform the 501(c)(4) classification used by groups organized for
the purposes of social welfare.
From veterans' organizations to civic education
programs, many important nonprofits fall under this
designation.
Currently, contributions to these
organizations are not tax deductible for their donors, but these
groups are not required to pay taxes to the U.S. federal
government.
These nonprofits are
allowed to participate in the political process, within limits, and typical
activities include voter education, advocacy and holding town halls.
Many free market groups file under this
classification.
The new rules would virtually halt
such activities. Plus, the IRS would require 501(c)(4) non-profits to
pay taxes, knowing full well that these groups cannot afford to do
so.

Ukraine
The turmoil and
loss of life we are seeing in Ukraine is very troubling. It is
further evidence that America cannot and must not lead from behind. We need
real leadership on the world stage -- leadership that America can and
should provide. Our enemies and our allies will continue to look to
our nation and measure our resolve and our willingness to engage
thoughtfully.
