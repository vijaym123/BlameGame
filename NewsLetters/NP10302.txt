Dear Friend,
Like many of you, I found it disturbing that a teenager was able to
breach the perimeter at Mineta San Jose Airport and stowaway in the
wheel well on a flight to Hawaii undetected. We were lucky that this
young man survived and was not trying to do harm, but the incident
raises significant concerns affecting airport passenger security.
That's why as a Member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on
Transportation Security I called for the Government Accountability
Office (GAO) to conduct a nationwide assessment of the security of
airport perimeters
so we can identify
vulnerabilities and prevent future airport breaches.
Watch my CNN interview about the San Jose Airport perimeter breach.
While we have made significant progress in airport security since 9/11,
there has not been an audit on airport perimeter security in five
years. I believe it's time to update our airport perimeters with
advanced security technologies so we can better protect the perimeter
and the traveling public.
As always, it is an honor to represent you in the U.S. Congress. Please
contact my East Bay offices at 510-370-3322 or 925-460-5100 if you have
any further questions or if we can be of service in any way. To stay in
touch, please connect with me on Twitter @RepSwalwell and on Facebook.
Sincerely,

Dear

Like

We
were

that
this
young

survived
and
was
not

the
incident
raises
significant

affecting
airport
passenger
security.
That&#8217;s
why
as
a

Security
