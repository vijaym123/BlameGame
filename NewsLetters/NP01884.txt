Dear
Friend,
In Washington, we have started to work on the budget for
Fiscal Year 2016. I appreciate the hard work being done by the
members of the House Budget Committee. I supported the Republican Study
Committee and Price #2 budget proposals put forward on the House
Floor because I strongly believe that either of these plans put us on a
path towards fully funding our national security, reforming
entitlements, and bringing our budget into balance in the near future. These
budgets also repeal Obamacare and lawless executive amnesty, as well as
simplifying the tax code.
The next step must be to
push the Senate to make sure that a conservative and fiscally
responsible budget reaches the President's desk. We should force President Obama
to explain to the American people why he does not support a budget
that returns America to a position of fiscal strength and
stability.
As you will see below, it has also been a period
filled with committee hearings, bill introductions, and time spent here in
Colorado.
Please let me know if you require
any assistance with a federal government agency by contacting my
local office at (719) 520-0055.
I am honored to serve
as your Representative in
Washington.
Sincerely,

RECOGNIZING
OUTSTANDING YOUNG CITIZENS
Each spring, I have the honor and privilege of acknowledging
some of the best and brightest high school students that the Fifth
Congressional District has to offer. The Congressional Art Competition
and the Service Academy Nominations are two highlights of each and every
year.
It was absolutely incredible to see all
of the talent on display at the 2015 Congressional Art Competition. I
am impressed every year by the talent showcased by the high school
artists here in the Fifth Congressional District. Thank you to Library 21c
for hosting our show.
Please join me in congratulating Grand Prize Winner Grace Medran a
home school student instructed by Kenneth Shanika. Her painting will
hang in the Capitol for a year and she will be flown to Washington DC
for a winner's reception at the White
House!
It is an amazing privilege to be able to
provide a platform for wonderful young
artists.

STANDING UP FOR OUR
VETERANS
I issued
the following statement on the departure of VA Principal Executive
Director of the Office of Acquisition, Logistics, and Construction Glenn
Haggstrom:
"The delays,
cost overruns, and mismanagement at the new VA Hospital in Aurora
have been horrific. It is encouraging that the VA is honestly assessing
their difficulties in this area and is showing some accountability. Our
Colorado veterans have earned this new facility, require its
services, and I am determined to see it completed. The VA must continue to
utilize the flexibility it has been granted by Congress to root out the
individuals responsible for this monumental
failure."
Following the release of new cost estimates to
complete the new VA hospital in Aurora, the Colorado Congressional delegation
expressed its commitment to working together on behalf of our
veterans to ensure the regional medical facility is
completed.
The VAs recent cost
projections reflect the utter mismanagement of the project from the
start. After insisting to the Congressional delegation and the veterans
community that the project was within its budget for years, the VAs
latest projections are yet another affront to both tax payers and our
veterans community,
Senator Michael Bennet said.
Leaving this project unfinished is obviously not a solution. We are
committed to fulfilling this promise to Colorado's veterans, and I
have faith the Colorado delegation and veterans community will continue
to work together and with the other regional stakeholders to ensure
completion of this regional hospital. The delegation will continue to
demand greater accountability and transparency at the
VA.
The VA should have completed the
Aurora VA hospital on time and on budget. They failed. But the punishment
for that failure should not fall on Colorado veterans,
Senator Cory
Gardner said.
It is critically
important for our veterans that this project be completed and this
hospital opened. Thats why Ive already offered legislation to transfer
the management of this project from the VA to the Army Corps of
Engineers, and thats why I will support committing the resources required
to complete the project. The United States has no greater
responsibility than taking care of those who have served our
country.
The breathtaking amount of money
needed to complete the new Denver VA facility demonstrates two things.
First and most immediately, Colorado leadersespecially our
Congressional delegationmust band together to make sure this project is
completed so that our veterans can access the facilities and treatment they
have earned. Second, the VA should never again be involved with major
construction projects,
Rep.
Diana
DeGette (CO-01) said.
I am deeply concerned and disappointed by the amount of additional
funds the VA is requesting to complete the construction of our Denver
VA replacement medical center,
Rep. Doug Lamborn (CO-05)
said.
This is a critical facility that our Colorado
veterans have earned and need, so I remain committed to ensure we bring
the project to completion.
However, the previous mismanagement
and lack of construction supervision within the VA clearly requires
additional Congressional oversight to ensure better accountability and
determine the best way forward regarding the VAs ability to build
hospitals.
I'm incredibly
frustrated and angry about the $1.73 billion price tag for the VA
hospital in Aurora. The VA's mismanagement has plagued this project since
day one and the veterans and taxpayers are the ones paying the price,
said Rep. Ed Perlmutter (CO-07).
We now have a
final cost estimate on the project.
Our delegation has its work
cut out for us to get the additional funding, but our veterans need
and deserve this facility and I won't stop working until they get
it.
As much as Im angered
by the mismanagement of this project, as a combat veteran I know that
we have an obligation to see that this hospital is completed and that
everything that can be done will be done to bring down the cost, that
those responsible for these cost overruns are held accountable, and
that the necessary reforms are put in place to make sure that this never
happens again,
said Rep. Mike Coffman
(CO-06).
The delays and infighting
surrounding the construction of our Veterans Hospital are a prime
example of bureaucracy beating out the well-being of Colorado's veterans,
said Rep. Jared Polis (CO-02).
It is time for the VA
to move this project to the top of the list and do what it takes to
complete this hospital promptly and give the Coloradans who put their
lives on the line for us the facility and care they
deserve.
The mismanagement of this
project by the VA is an outrage, and its the American taxpayer and veterans
awaiting care that are most greatly impacted by the staggering cost
and construction delays.
Those VA officials that have been
responsible for these problems need to be held accountable, and this entire
process raises questions as to why the VA was ever involved in
construction in the first place,
said Rep. Scott Tipton
(CO-03).
Im committed to working with my Colorado colleagues to ensure
the new Denver VA Hospital is completed for Colorados veterans and
costs are lowered where possible. With that we must be equally steadfast
in working to implement additional reforms to prevent this from ever
happening again with VA construction
programs.
During a recent House Veterans Affairs Committee Hearing, I
had the opportunity to question witnesses on improving transparency at
the VA.

Recently, I met with my Veterans Advisory
Board at the new PFC Floyd K. Lindstrom Colorado Springs VA Clinic.
Topics covered included the recent announcement of the
design contract being awarded for the forthcoming Southern Colorado
National Veterans Cemetery , the
efforts by the
entire Colorado Congressional Delegation
to have positive
movement forward on the forthcoming VA Hospital in Aurora, and
the new VA Clinic . The Board was able to meet and hear a
presentation from the VA Clinic's new manager, Greg
Kopp.
Congressman
Lamborn also made a special presentation of remarks he had entered in
the Congressional Record honoring Jim Tackett, the outgoing El Paso
County Veteran Service Officer, a job he performed with distinction for
over 29 years.

I
visited co-owners Jonathan and Jared
Veteto and the entire team at Cogitic Corporation. Headquartered right
here in Colorado Springs, Cogitic
makes high quality parts for America's submarine fleet.
They were also involved in the commissioning of the USS Colorado, a
brand new Virginia-class submarine that had her keel laying ceremony on
March 7th.

SUPPORTING
ISRAEL
I would like to
congratulate Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for winning the trust
of the Israeli voters for a third consecutive term. Israel is the only
true democracy in the Middle East. Only the people of Israel, and no
outside factors, elect their leadership. PM Netanyahu is a true and
courageous leader, and has always been an advocate for strong U.S.
Israel partnership and friendship. Both America and Israel will face many
challenges in coming years and I would encourage the Prime Minister to
remember the scripture of Joshua 1:9 Be strong and courageous. Do
not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with
you wherever you go.

I joined my colleague, Congressman Ron
DeSantis in releasing the following statement after our introduction of H.R.
1572, the Boycott Our Enemies, Not Israel Act
:
Today, we introduced
H.R. 1572 to thwart efforts by Palestinian organizations to pressure
different corporations, companies and educational institutions to
boycott, divest, and sanction Israel. Recently the Palestinian
Authority declared a boycott against Israeli goods, depriving their own
population of most basically needed products. Threats of similar actions
emerged out of the European Union. These attacks and the
falsehoods being spread about Israel are harmful to any honest effort to bring
peace to the region.
My
bill will require that any prospective contractors with the U.S.
Government will certify that they are not taking part in any boycott
against Israel. The bill also includes penalties for false certifications,
including the ability to ban companies that breach its parameters from
doing future business with the U.S. Government. Our government
business practices should not play any role in harming our greatest ally in
the Middle East.
Israel
is the only true democracy in the Middle East, a place where all men
and women enjoy freedom regardless of their faith or ethnicity. In fact
Jewish owned factories and companies in Israel and in Judea and
Samaria are among the chief employers of the Palestinian community.
Palestinian workers get equal pay and equal treatment and enjoy
benefits."
- Congressman Doug
Lamborn (CO-05)
The BDS
movement represents a disgraceful attempt to single out Israel for
punitive treatment.
This bill sends a strong message that we will
not allow taxpayer funds to go to contractors who participate in this
contemptible charade. It is imperative that the United States send a
strong message of condemnation by refusing to fund participating
contractors using taxpayer money.
- Congressman Ron DeSantis
(FL-06)
I joined my colleague,
Congresswoman Gwen Graham in releasing the following statement after
our introduction of H.R. 1349, the US-Israel Anti-Tunnel Defense
Cooperation Act, to authorize research and development of an
anti-tunneling defense system to protect Israel from terrorist attacks:
Every day, our closest
ally in the Middle East
Israel
lives under the constant threat of
terrorist attacks launched from underground tunnels, Rep. Graham
said. The US-Israel Anti-Tunnel Defense Cooperation Act will authorize
an unprecedented new initiative to protect Israel from this dangerous
threat.
The US-Israel
Anti-Tunnel Defense Cooperation Act is similar to the 2011 legislative
authorization for the highly successful Iron Dome Anti-Missile Defense
System, which has stopped more than 1,200 rockets from hitting
Israel.
Rep. Doug Lamborn
added, "This past summer Iron Dome, the joint U.S.- Israel developed
technology, saved thousands of Israeli citizens lives. Now, Hamas and other
terrorist groups are taking to the underground tunnels. This is a
challenge not only to Israel but to the U.S. as well. I hope that this
cooperation with Israel will emulate the success of Iron Dome so that we
can find a solution that will protect American and Israeli
lives."
The terrorist group,
Hamas, has spent nearly $100 million to construct tunnels for smuggling
weapons, money and supplies into Gaza, as well as launching terrorist
attacks within Israels borders.
In 2006, Hamas kidnapped Israeli
soldier Gilad Shalit through a tunnel and held him for five years, and
in the summer 2014 conflict between Israel and Hamas, Israel Defense
Forces discovered 32 tunnels, 14 of which crossed directly into
Israel.
To secure peace, we
must first help Israel secure their state from terrorist attacks, Rep.
Graham said. Iron Dome has saved countless civilian lives, and I
believe an anti-tunneling defense shield will save countless
more.
The bipartisan legislation is
endorsed by AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. In
addition to helping Israel secure its borders, the anti-tunneling
defense technology discovered in this joint project could also be used to
protect American military bases and our nations borders with Mexico and
Canada.
This bill, which
authorizes research, development and test activities between the United
States and Israel in order to better detect and destroy these tunnels,
will help both the United States and Israel defend against future threats
emanating from tunnels, AIPACs directors of government affairs
wrote in an endorsement letter. This bill promotes real cooperation and
cost-sharing between Washington and Jerusalem on this key
challenge.
ENERGY
ISSUES
I had the privilege of chairing the first four hearings of the
114th Congress of my Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee of the
House Natural Resources Committee. We examined the budget priorities and
proposals of a variety of agencies including the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, the
Office of Natural Resources Revenue, the Office of Surface Mining, the
U.S. Geological Survey, the Bureau of Land Management, and the U.S.
Forest Service.

FIGHTING FOR
PRO-LIFE VALUES
The Government Accountability Office (GAO)
report
on taxpayer funding of six abortion advocacy groups,
including: Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), Population
Council, International Planned Parenthood Federation of America (IPPF),
Guttmacher Institute, Advocates for Youth, and Sexuality Information and
Education Council of the United States has been released. This report
was in response to a request letter that I authored, along with 71
other pro-life Members of Congress, to the GAO seeking up-to-date
information regarding federal funding for Planned Parenthood and other
abortion advocacy organizations.
The report found that from Fiscal Years 2010 to 2012
abortion advocacy groups received $481 million in federal funding, as
well as about $1.2 billion in combined federal and state funds under
federal health programs that require shared funding.
Planned
Parenthood, the largest provider of abortions in the country, received a
vast majority of these funds. Over the course of three years Planned
Parenthood received $1.5 billion combined federal and state
dollars.
The GAO report confirms
our suspicions that federal and state funds are continuing to be used
to subsidize Planned Parenthood and other organizations that promote
abortions.
Planned Parenthood alone is responsible for the
deaths of over 6 million unborn children, and it is indefensible to
continue to force American taxpayers to fund this organization. I will
continue to do everything in my power to prevent Planned Parenthood and
organizations like it from receiving taxpayer dollars.
This report
highlights the need for Congress to pass the Title X Abortion Provider
Prohibition Act, which will cut off federal funding from groups like
these that perform and promote
abortions.
FIXING A BROKEN SYSTEM FOR SENIORS AND HEALTHCARE
PROFESSIONALS
Permanently solving the Sustainable Growth Rate problem that has plagued
Washington for over a decade and a half is the appropriate and
conservative thing to do, plain and simple. Through a series of reforms to
Medicare and entitlements, this legislation prevents tens of billions of
dollars from being wasted on temporary yearly "fixes" that wreak havoc
on the ability of medical professionals to plan and anticipate their
budget needs from year to year. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget
Office has calculated that H.R. 2 will save hundreds of billions of
dollars over the next twenty years. Indeed, these Medicare and entitlement
reforms are so distasteful to liberals that Harry Reid has already
voiced opposition to this plan. Accomplishing this in a bipartisan
fashion, without raising taxes, is a real accomplishment. Solving the
problems that hold back private sector professionals is exactly why the
American people sent us to
Washington.
SCENES FROM THE
LENSE OF CONGRESSMAN
LAMBORN
Earlier this month, I had the honor, as a member
of the Congressional Prayer Caucus, of co-hosting the LIFT America
Religious Liberty Summit at the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte, North
Carolina. Below are pictures I took at the Library, including a replica
of Billy Graham's personal
office.
Thank you
to Colorado State Representative Janak Joshi and the American
Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI) for their gracious
invitation to address the organization on their visit to Washington DC. We had
a fascinating discussion that covered many topics including
Obamacare, patient-centered reforms, and more.

Melanie Ryan
-
I'm a
veteran with a 100% disability. The Colorado Springs clinic does a GREAT
job, but there are times when I must travel to the VA hospital in
Denver. The staff try hard, they really do, but that old building is so sad
and decrepit. My impression is that the VA itself is displaying its
traditional parsimonious behavior with this contract, and that the
contractor thinks that they have a blank check. Meanwhile, and as always,
the veteran in need is denied care.
