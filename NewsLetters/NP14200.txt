America needs real, patient-centered health care reform
"Obamacare or nothing" is a false choice. House Republicans have dozens of alternative proposals to help lower costs and expand access.
For example, I've cosponsored The American Health Care Reform Act (H.R. 3121). You can learn more about it
here .
As President Clinton recently acknowledged, millions of families are losing their health insurance plans because of Obamacare. President Obama looked Americans in the eye and promised that wouldnt happen, but thats just not true.
I recently spoke on the House floor and shared the stories of several Arkansans who have lost their health insurance plans because of Obamacare. You can
watch the video here :
To protect Americans who are losing their health insurance, my colleagues and I in the House passed a bill that would allow folks to keep their plans for another year. But President Obama and Senate Democrats say they'll block it.
The Obama Administrations politically motivated delays and unilateral, fig leaf "fixes" to Obamacare are calculated to protect Senate Democrats from being held accountable for the harmful effects of a law they voted for. They knew from the beginning that Obamacare would cancel millions of insurance policies, but they went ahead and promised it wouldntand now everyone knows that isnt true.
Obamacare is not fixable. It assumes that the health care decisions for 300 million Americans are best left up to central planners in Washington. The laws unraveling is not a temporary setback; it is evidence that a top-down, one-size-fits-all approach is destined for failure.
Its clear that Obamacare is a broken law, and its broken website is only the beginning. The solution is to repeal Obamacare and replace it with real, patient-centered reform that allows folks to control their own health care.
