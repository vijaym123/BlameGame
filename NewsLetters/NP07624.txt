Republicans want to shift health care costs onto the backs of seniors by making disastrous changes to Medicare. Sign our petition to help protect the Medicare Guarantee for seniors now and for retirees in the future:

David --
Paul Ryan and the Tea Party are determined to slash Medicare funding. Why? They need more cash to pay for billionaire tax breaks.
It&rsquo;s just another case of the Republicans&rsquo; backward priorities.
Here's what I believe: our seniors have put in a lifetime of work to earn their Medicare benefits. It makes NO SENSE to slash those benefits while the special interests get more tax breaks.
David, the single best thing you can do in this fight is stand up against Paul Ryan and the Republicans&rsquo; radical plans. Will you click here to sign your name alongside mine in support of traditional Medicare?
49 years ago Medicare was signed into law to ensure that seniors received the quality, affordable health care they need. It&rsquo;s one of the reasons I&rsquo;m most proud to be a Democrat.
But today, 49 million seniors will find their healthcare costs dramatically raised if the Republicans have their way.

Thank you,

P.S. Ryan&rsquo;s proposal doesn&rsquo;t even control the rising costs of health care coverage (like he claims) -- instead, Ryan wants to shift those costs onto seniors who can&rsquo;t afford it.
