Congressman McHenry Weekly Update
How May I Help You?
Being a Member of Congress is about much more than committee hearings and votes on the House floor.
It is about serving each of the 700,000+ people I represent in Western North Carolina, whether that be explaining a complex piece of legislation or assisting a veteran with his VA claim.
This week, I wrote an op-ed for the Lincoln Times-News about the services I can provide to constituents and also to solicit suggestions on what I can do better to serve
you.
Please take a moment to read the op-ed by clicking the image below.
If you should have a suggestion on what I can do better, please
share it
with me.
Reining In Our Massive Federal Debt
One of the greatest threats to the long-term health of our nation is the countries' massive and constantly growing federal debt.
Our debt is currently well above $17 trillion with each Americans' share over $55,000.
Clearly, something must be done about the issue now.
With that in mind, the House Financial Services Committee has launched a series of hearings on our federal debt.
This week we held the first hearing in the series with testimony from a number of leading experts on the issue.
Click the image below to see my questions from the hearing.

Financial Services Committee website .
Proud to Support
While the media may focus on Obamacare and immigration reform, numerous polls show that the majority of Americans are most concerned about jobs.
The unemployment rate has come down, but thousands of Americans are leaving the labor force and even more are stuck in jobs with stagnant wages and no opportunity for growth.
It is time something be done to put Americans back to work and this week I was proud to join that effort by cosponsoring the newly introduced RSC JOBS Act.
This legislation will reduce Washington redtape that has stifled growth and hurt entreprenuers across the country.

What I Have Been Reading
Substitute Teachers Feel Impact of Health Care Law
WITN
This story from Pitt County in Eastern North Carolina highlights another job-killing consequence of Obamacare, its impact on substitute teachers.
As this article outlines, school systems across the country have been forced to cut the hours of substitute teachers in order to comply with the law's requirement that employers provide health insurance to all employees working over 30 hours a week.
A brief history of Obamacare delays
Politico
In light of this week's news of another unilateral Obamacare delay, I found this history of the law's numerous delays helpful.
The delays have become so frequent and covered seemingly every portion of the law so one cannot be blamed for having trouble keeping up.
Coupled with the laws impact on cutting hours and cancelling current plans, these delays are yet another example of why this law must be repealed and replaced.
A war hero looks back
Lincoln Times-News
The brave men who stormed the beaches of Normandy and Okinawa during World War II are the finest America has ever produced and truly are The Greatest Generation.
Most of these men are in there 80s or 90s now and we are losing them everyday.
That makes stories like the one above about Lincolnton's John David Abernathy all the more important so these veterans' stories of courage can be shared for generations to come.
