Hatch Dispatch:
The Distinguished Flying Cross Medal Comes
Home
Dear Friends:
One of the greatest honors I have as a United
States Senator is to award military medals to
deserving veterans or their family members. I had
the privilege to do so just a few days ago when I
awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross to Dennis
Madsen, son of World War II First Lieutenant Boyd
Madsen, who served courageously and earned this
honor.
(Sen. Hatch Presenting Dennis
Madsen with the Medal)
Dennis was going through some of his
fathers papers and came across an original
military Order dated August 23, 1945 for this
medal. Yet the family had never seen such a medal
and were unable to verify that their father had
received it. Dennis brought this matter to my
attention, and I went to work to ensure that this
honor was realized.
(First Lieutenant Boyd Madsen)
(The Distinguished Flying
Cross)
The Distinguished
Flying Cross is our nations oldest
military aviation award that is given to any
officer or enlisted member of the United States
Armed Forces who distinguishes himself or herself
in support of operations by heroism or
extraordinary achievement while participating in
an aerial flight.
Utahn Boyd Madsen served in the Pacific Theater
during World War II, as a First Lieutenant in the
20th Air Force 19th Bombardment Group. He flew 27
missions over Japan. He has been described as
a man of honor and is remembered
for his quiet strength, kindness,
integrity, keen wit and quirky sense of
humor.
He earned the Distinguished Flying Cross award
for his achievements during an aerial flight
against Tamashima, Japan on June 22, 1945. He was
the Bombardier of a B-29 plane and displayed
exceptional skill releasing his bombs as part of
an aggressive attack in difficult weather from a
base in the Marianas.
Boyd Madsen was truly one of the Greatest
Generation and exemplified honor and
sacrifice
quietly and humbly. I am
certain that the Distinguished Flying Cross will
serve as a testament to the life Boyd led and
will have a profound impact on generations to
come as they look to his example of dedication,
sacrifice, and service. I was honored to be able
to bring this medal to its rightful
home.
Sincerely,
Orrin Hatch
