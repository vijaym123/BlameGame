Dear Friend:
Every Veterans Day, we come together across America to honor the brave men and women who have sacrificed so much for our country.
Throughout our nation's history, in war and in peace, our men and women in uniform have exemplified the values of duty, courage, and unwavering patriotism.
As a grateful nation, we celebrate their service and offer them our deepest thanks for ensuring America's safety and preserving the freedoms we hold dear.
As we observe Veterans Day, we must never forget that our nation's veterans deserve more than just our gratitude - they deserve our enduring support.
That is why I am working in the U.S. Senate to ensure that America's veterans and their families get the care, benefits, and support they have earned and deserve.
On Veterans Day and every day, I hope we take advantage of every opportunity to thank our service members, veterans, and their families for their extraordinary service and countless sacrifices.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
