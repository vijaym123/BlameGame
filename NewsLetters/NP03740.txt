WEEK IN
REVIEW
Last week, the House took
its last vote of the 113th Congress, so I got to spend this week
traveling the Third District.
On Tuesday, I started off my day by
visiting
Westwood Elementary in Greenwood at the invitation of fourth
grader Blake Gibson. Thanks for inviting me to visit with your class!
Since I was in Greenwood, I then made a stop by the Senior Activity
Center to meet with the centers leadership team and seniors and learn
about its mission and funding.
From there I made my way back to
Fort Smith and, after a quick tour of Westphal Oil and Gas, went over
to the Evans Boys &amp; Girls Club. The Fort Smith Boys &amp; Girls
Clubs mission is to enhance the quality of life for the youth of the
community and help youth of all backgrounds because leaders. Read about
my visit with the Boys &amp; Girls Club in
this piece from the Times
Record .
I spent Wednesday in Marion County and even visited Wild Bills
the
largest outfitter on the Buffalo National River! I also had a chance
to go over to Yellville-Summit High and speak with the schools AP
students.
Go Panthers! I finished up my day in Marion County with a
tour of Ranger Boats in Flippin.
My Thursday was spent in Russellville. My first
stop was to check out the new athletic complex at Russellville High, my
alma mater! Already looking forward to getting back for a game. Go
Cyclones!
You can read about
my visit from the Russellville
Courier .
Afterwards, I went to Freedom House to
celebrate the $20,000 award AT&amp;T presented to Freedom
House
for the enhancement of its Fresh Start Vocational
Rehabilitation Program, which is designed to give the nearly 300
individuals in recovery it serves the vocational skills needed to promote
self-sufficiency and obtain employment. This award is a great example
of private industry being responsive to local needs and investing in
the communities and people they serve. Thank you, AT&amp;T, and
congratulations to Freedom House. I wrapped up my time in Russellville with a
stop at POM Parking Meter Manufacturing Facility. Did you know there
are only three manufacturers of parking meters in the world? Thanks to
POM for showing me how these machines are
made.
Today, I toured Sealed Air in Rogers, Arkansas, where I was
honored with the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) Award for
Legislative Excellence. Thousands of companies recognize the value of
manufacturing in Arkansas, and their exports and the jobs they create
are vital to both our state and our nations economy. I am proud to
support the manufacturing industry and policies that allow them increase
production and our economy to continue to grow.
As I travel throughout the Third District as 2014 winds
down, I am reminded of how truly grateful I am to continue to work on
behalf of the Third District as a member of the United States House of
Representatives. America faces many challenges today, and, during the
114th Congress, I will remain committed to passing real reforms to reduce
the size, scope, and spending of our government and to bringing the
spirit of our Districts rich history of entrepreneurialism and
private-sector economic growth to Washington.
