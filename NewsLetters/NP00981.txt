Dear
Friend,
This Mothers Day, I want to take the opportunity to thank
all mothers for the sacrifices they make every day.
My mother has
always been one of the strongest influences in my life. She has given
me the inspiration to follow my dreams and she instilled in me the
tremendous value of honesty, hard work, and a good education.
To
this day, I look to her for guidance and as an example of how to live
my life both as a person and a public servant.
A mothers
job is often difficult, laborious and thankless, but every mother can
have the same positive impact on their childs life that my mother has
had on me. Here in Congress, we should recognize this and work to
support mothers across the nation as they work to support their
families.
Delivering on equal pay for equal work would allow a working
mother to provide for her family with fewer constraints. Access to
quality childcare provides the flexibility to work or pursue educational
goals. Providing paid leave so that mothers are not forced to send
their sick child to school. Making college affordable would make it so
that those mothers who wish can achieve success in the classroom
without hindrance. These are just a few of the steps Congress can take right
now to give working mothers the support they both need and deserve. I
value the major contributions mothers and all women make to our
country and will continue to fight for policies that put them, their
dreams, families, and goals first.
Whether its sending flowers
or just saying thank you, take time to ensure every mother knows how
important they are today and every day.
From one son to mothers
everywhere, Happy Mothers Day!
Sincerely,
Congressman Cedric Richmond
2nd Congressional
District of Louisiana
