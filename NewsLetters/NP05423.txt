Supporting our
Military
This morning, I toured
Barksdale Air Force Base with Senator John McCain, Senator David Vitter
and Representative John Fleming.
We saw first hand how
Barksdale contributes to our national security and Louisianas
economy.
It's always a privilege to be with veterans and service members.
It was my honor to be with Senator McCain and meet those who
have sacrificed for our
freedoms.
Fixing Healthcare
The
Louisiana Department of Insurance revealed that some health insurers will
impose double-digit premium increases in 2015 for policies sold through
Obamacare.
The President said premiums would go down for
the typical family by $2,500.
This was a false promise.
Its
clear Obamacare is not working, and I will push for patient-centered,
affordable health care
solutions.
Saving the Midla Pipeline
Last week, it was announced that the Midla Pipeline,
which sends natural gas to families in south Louisiana, will not be
abandoned.
Midla will build a new pipeline from Winnsboro to Natchez
that will serve parts of central Louisiana.
I am glad to
have worked with Senator Vitter on saving the pipeline, and we will
continue to work to protect Louisianans from future rate
increases.
