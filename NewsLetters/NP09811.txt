5.9.14 Listening To Servicemembers
Dear Friend,
With one in three Virginians directly connected to the military, listening to the concerns of servicemembers will always be a top priority of mine.
This week I
introduced the
Servicemembers' Compensation Empowerment Act
- bipartisan legislation that would direct the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission tasked with issuing cost-savings recommendations next year to formally survey servicemembers on their preferences with regards to compensation and benefits, such as housing allowances and healthcare. As of now, no official study has been conducted to determine the relative value of these benefits to the military personnel who depend on them. You can learn more
here .
Here's Janis, Matt and I after we met in my DC office last year
I also introduced legislation this week to extend and reform the
Special Immigrant Visa program
(SIV) for Afghans who risked their lives serving alongside Americans &ndash; many from Virginia &ndash; as interpreters or working with U.S. organizations over the last 13 years. Many are now in danger of violent retribution. Last year, my office was able to help Janis Shinwari, who served as an interpreter for Captain Matthew Zeller of Virginia, obtain his SIV. Janis and his family were able to get a fresh start in Virginia, and it&rsquo;s my hope we&rsquo;ll be able to give more brave Afghans like the Shinwaris that same chance.
Sincerely,
Senator Tim Kaine
