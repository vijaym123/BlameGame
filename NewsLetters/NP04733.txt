Here&rsquo;s the bad, ( ok, REALLY BAD ) news:
As you read this, Republicans are spending $2.5 MILLION to defeat Brad. (Yes, you read that right!) Here&rsquo;s the good, ( ok, AMAZING ) news: A group of Brad&rsquo;s TOP supporters have agreed to MATCH ALL GIFTS*, but only if we can hit 100 donations by midnight.
David, this is the LAST time we can unlock the match for Brad before the Election Day.
So stop what you&rsquo;re doing, unlock the match and help send Brad to Congress.
