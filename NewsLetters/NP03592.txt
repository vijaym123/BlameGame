. Because H.R. 37 did not go through regular order, it required a 2/3 affirmative vote in order to pass. It did not achieve that threshold so it did not pass in the House. I voted NO and the entire vote is recorded below:

More Votes on the ACA
On Thursday the House considered H.R. 30, the Save American Workers Act of 2015. With this legislation, the Republican-led House is picking up where it left off when it comes to the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
H.R. 30 is the 54th time that the House has voted to repeal or alter the ACA. None of these efforts have resulted in a change to the law. H.R. 30 alters a provision in the ACA requiring employers to offer their employees working 30 hours or more a week health care or pay a penalty. H.R. 30 raises that threshold to 40 hours. This change places many more people at risk of losing their employer health care. Employers could simply reduce their workers hours slightly, freeing employers from the requirement of offering health coverage. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), this would increase the federal budget deficit by $53 billion over the next ten years. The CBO also estimates that a million workers could lose their health care coverage. Republicans argue that this change is necessary because the number of part-time workers has increased since the ACA became law. In fact, the exact opposite has occurred. I voted NO. H.R. 30 passed and the entire vote is recorded below:

Keystone XL
Today the House considered H.R. 3, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act. This is basically the same legislation that the House voted on in November. The Keystone XL Pipeline would carry crude oil over the Canadian border through parts of the United States to the Gulf Coast. Because of the nature of the project, and because it will cross an international border, there is a required approval process. I dont think there is any question that a project like this one should be subject to a significant environmental review, including under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). H.R.3 basically exempts the pipeline from all of this. The review process is ongoing and there is no reason to stop it. This legislation also sets a troubling precedent by allowing the project to bypass required reviews, creating a similar path for other projects. I voted NO. H.R. 3 passed and the entire vote is recorded below:

Whats up Next
Next votes will take place on Monday January 12th. The House is expected to again consider H.R. 37, the Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act. This time the legislation will come up under regular order, so it will need a simple majority to pass.
