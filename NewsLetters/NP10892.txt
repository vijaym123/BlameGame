Dear Friend,
In December, Target customers fell victim to a widespread data breach
that compromised the personal and financial information of up to 110
million individuals in the United States. It's also estimated that
500,000 Texans had their debit/credit card information compromised as
part of that breach.
This type of sophisticated attack has far reaching consequences for
everyone affected. The customers are put in serious jeopardy of having
their lives impacted by fraudulent charges and are forced to go through
the process of working with their bank to handle any compromised
credit/debit cards and receive replacement cards.
Yet, what has mostly gone unnoticed is the immense burden to banks and
financial institutions that have to cover the costs of notifying
customers and replace the compromised cards. When a data breach does
occur, like the incident with Target, the banks rather than the
retailer serve as the first line of defense to protect their customers
from any fraudulent activity.
However, this comes with an extraordinary cost for the financial
institutions, especially smaller community banks. For example,
community banks have reissued more than four million credit and debit
cards to consumers at a total reissuance cost of more than $40 million.
The community banks have to absorb this cost upfront in order to
immediately protect the financial security of their customers. In turn,
this makes managing a retailer's data breach financially unsustainable
for community banks over the long-term.
That is why it's vital for all parties involved, including Congress, to
review what can be done to strengthen the protection of personal
information and prevent these massive data breaches from occurring.
And, it's equally important to ensure that those impacted, both
customers and banking institutions, are not put in dire financial
straits either because of such breaches.
Sincerely,
Kay Granger
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
In
December,
Target
customers
fell
victim
to
a
widespread
data
breach
that
compromised
the
personal
and
financial
information
of
up
to
110
million
individuals
in
the
United
States.
It&#8217;s
also
estimated
that
500,000
Texans
had
their
debit/credit
card
information
compromised
as
part
of
that
breach.
This
type
of
sophisticated
attack
has
far
reaching
consequences
for
everyone
affected.
The
customers
are
put
in
serious
jeopardy
of
having
their
lives
impacted
by
fraudulent
charges
and
are
forced
to
go
through
the
process
of
working
with
their
bank
to
handle
any
compromised
credit/debit
cards
and
receive
replacement
cards.
Yet,
what
has
mostly
gone
unnoticed
is
the
immense
burden
to
banks
and
financial
institutions
that
have
to
cover
the
costs
of
notifying
customers
and
replace
the
compromised
cards.
When
a
data
breach
does
occur,
like
the
incident
with
Target,
the
banks
rather
than
the
retailer
serve
as
the
first
line
of
defense
to
protect
their
customers
from
any
fraudulent
activity.
However,
this
comes
with
an
extraordinary
cost
for
the
financial
institutions,
especially
smaller
community
banks.
For
example,
community
banks
have
reissued
more
than
four
million
credit
and
debit
cards
to
consumers
at
a
total
reissuance
cost
of
more
than
$40
million.
The
community
banks
have
to
absorb
this
cost
upfront
in
order
to
immediately
protect
the
financial
security
of
their
customers.
In
turn,
this
makes
managing
a
retailer&#8217;s
data
breach
financially
unsustainable
for
community
banks
over
the
long-term.
That
is
why
it&#8217;s
vital
for
all
parties
involved,
including
Congress,
to
review
what
can
be
done
to
strengthen
the
protection
of
personal
information
and
prevent
these
massive
data
breaches
from
occurring.
And,
it&#8217;s
equally
important
to
ensure
that
those
impacted,
both
customers
and
banking
institutions,
are
not
put
in
dire
financial
straits
either
because
of
such
breaches.
