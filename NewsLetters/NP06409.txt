Time Change for Tonight's Tele-Townhall - Event
to Start at 7:30 p.m. MT
During the series of town halls I
held in August, many of you had questions about how our country should
respond to growing threats abroad.
Many Utahns were concerned
about the rise of ISIS in Iraq and Syria and Russian aggression towards
Ukraine.
I responded to these concerns by asserting that as
Commander in Chief, the president has the responsibility to come before
Congress and the American people to present his strategy for dealing
with foreign threats to our national security.
Tonight, President
Obama is delivering a speech about his strategy for dealing with the
turmoil in Iraq and Syria as a result of the growing power of
ISIS.
His speech is scheduled to start at 7:00 p.m. MT, and this was the
time that I was planning on holding my tele-townhall tonight.
Out of respect to the office of the presidency, I am planning to
postpone tonight's tele-townhall by thrity minutes.
The event
will now be held at 7:30 p.m. MT .
I look forward to
discussing the president's speech with you along with any other topics you
would like to discuss.

A Wholesale Effort to
Repeal the First Amendment
This week the Senate is debating
a dangerous amendment to our Constitution that would limit Americans'
First Amendment right to freedom of speech.
Yesterday I delivered a speech on the Senate Floor to argue against this
proposal.
Our political system isn't perfect, but it is
designed to keep us free. But it keeps us free only to the extent that
individuals are allowed to speak their mind without fear of retribution
from the government. It keeps us free only to the extent that
individuals rich and poor alike are able to say what they want and join
together to form voluntary associations for the purpose of influencing the
outcome of elections.
