Friend,
Are you ready for the New Year?
After a short break for the holidays, we&#39;re ready to get back to work. While Ami is in Washington focused on the issues that we care about- from making college more affordable to helping folks find good paying jobs- we&#39;re launching the campaign here in Sacramento County.
It&#39;s early but necessary- Speaker Boehner is already recruiting candidates across the country to run in competitive districts just like ours. Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy has voiced his intentions to specifically target districts in California- and our district will be at the top of their list.
We don&#39;t have any time to lose. Our best strategy is to have a strong showing in these early months. If our momentum is evident now, it&#39;s less likely we will see the same level of national spending, and it will deter self-funding candidates from trying to buy this seat.
We are officially launching the 2016 campaign TODAY. To start the campaign off on the right foot, we need 100 people to pitch in whatever they can to help us get started. Will you join us?

Even a $5 contribution makes a difference as we launch Ami&#39;s reelection and make early campaign decisions.
Your support today will help us lay the foundation for another winning campaign, and it is our way to push back on Speaker Boehner and his friends who want to buy this seat with special interest money.
Can we count you in for 2016?
Thanks,
Team Bera
