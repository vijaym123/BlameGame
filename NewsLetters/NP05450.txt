Dear Friend,
Today marks the beginning of Medicare
open enrollment, a period that spans from
October 15, 2014 to December 7, 2014,
during which seniors have the opportunity
to review and update their Medicare Part D
prescription drug plans or switch to
Medicare Advantage plans.
In Ohio this past year, the lowest
monthly premium for a prescription drug
plan was $12.60, and 49 percent of the Part
D plans available in our state had no
annual deductible. Medicare beneficiaries
who are satisfied with their current
coverage do not need to take any action
during the open enrollment period. Each
year, however, new healthcare plans become
available that may offer better coverage or
yield more savings. That is why it is
important that all options are reviewed and
plans carefully selected to cater to an
individuals unique needs.
To learn more about the prescription
drug plans that are available, check out
the Medicare Plan Finder at
Medicare.gov/find-a-plan .
You can also call Medicare at
1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) or visit
Medicare.gov
to enroll. In addition, by calling
1-800-686-1578, the Ohio Senior Health
Insurance Information Program can provide
free health insurance information and
services for people with Medicare.
It is important to note that many
Medicare beneficiaries qualify for Extra
Help, a program within Medicare that helps
individuals who qualify cover the cost of
their Part D prescription drug plan. In
2014, 26 percent of beneficiaries in Ohio
received Part Ds Extra Help, which
includes assistance with annual
deductibles, monthly premiums, and
prescription co-payments or coinsurance.
With the full Extra Help benefit in 2014,
an eligible beneficiary should pay no more
than $2.35 for a generic drug. Medicare
enrollees who have Medicaid, live in an
institution such as a nursing home, or
receive community-based services should not
pay anything out-of-pocket for their
prescription drugs. To see if you qualify
or to apply for Extra Help, visit
www.socialsecurity.gov/extrahelp .
Lastly, I urge Ohioans to be aware of
identity theft when maneuvering the open
enrollment process. Never provide your
personal information, such as your Social
Security number, to anyone unless you are
sure of whom you are speaking
with.
It is important that Medicare
beneficiaries receive all of the
information they need in order to make the
right decision for what coverage is best
for them. I encourage Ohioans to take this
opportunity to review your options and
select a healthcare plan that best fits
your needs.
