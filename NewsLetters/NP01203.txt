This week, the House
and Senate agreed on a budget resolution, setting the framework for
how Congress will appropriate funds for federal departments and
agencies.
It cuts $5 trillion and balances the budget within 10 years
without a tax increase while calling for Obamacare's repeal,
strengthening national defense and preserving Social Security and Medicare.
With that, the House has begun one of its most important
responsibilities, executing its "power of the purse."
The House passed
two appropriations bills - one for the Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA) and military construction; the other for energy and water
development programs - setting funding for various federal agencies and
programs.
With this legislation, the VA would see a 5.6 percent
funding boost, enhancing its ability to serve our nation's veterans
while also strengthening the investigative arm of the agency, making
sure the VA is held accountable for quality of care provided.
The
bill would move us closer toward a modernized and paperless VA benefit
processing system to reduce the notorious benefits backlog.
The
Department of Defense would receive an increase for housing and
training troops and ensuring our brave men and women on the frontlines have
the equipment they need to succeed.
It would also ensure 1.4
million military families have excellent housing, fund medical facility
construction for 9.8 million beneficiaries and wounded warriors, and
support anti-terror operations such as operations against the Islamic
State in Iraq and Syria.
Regarding the energy and water
development bill, the Department of Energy (DOE) would have to use
additional funds to accommodate and prioritize an "all of the above" energy
approach, efficiently utilizing all of our God-given domestic natural
resources and moving us closer to energy independence.
The bill
also prohibits implementation of EPA's "Waters of the U.S." rule, which
would have a major negative impact on southwest Missouri's agriculture
and economy.
These are the first two of 12 appropriations
bills Congress needs to pass ahead of each fiscal year, which
begins October 1.
This is the earliest the House has begun
work on appropriations bills since 1974.
I look forward to
working on the rest of the appropriations bills and carrying out my
Constitutional duty while upholding fiscal
accountability.
