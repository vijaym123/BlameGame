Van Hollen Introduces IDEA Full Funding Act
In 1975,
Congress took the critical step of passing the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and guaranteeing that every child
with disabilities would have the opportunity to reach his or her full
potential. At that time, the federal government committed to pay 40
percent of the average per pupil expenditure for special education.
However, that pledge has never been met, and current funding is at just
15.3 percent. The IDEA Full Funding Act would require regular increases
in IDEA spending to finally meet our commitment to America's children
and schools.

Update on Mail Delivery
In response to the reports I received from constituents about
non-delivery of mail, delivery of mail to the wrong addresses, and
unacceptable customer service at area post office facilities, I
contacted the Postmaster General to demand immediate resolution of
these issues. My staff and I have also been in regular communication
with postal officials to monitor daily service. Please be assured that
I will continue to monitor the implementation of the promised
improvements. If you find that your service is not of the quality that
you expect and deserve, I would appreciate your contacting my office by

extremely important and will help to ensure that our community receives
reliable and efficient mail delivery.
