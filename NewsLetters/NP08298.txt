The Scalise Capitol Report
Monday, June 30,

The solution to jumpstarting our economy is right under
our feet
The quickest and most proven recipe to jumpstart our economy is
American energy. Look no further than the regions of the country with the
lowest rates of unemployment. Of the top ten regions in the country with
the lowest unemployment rates, half of them are energy economies. Im
proud to represent one of those, the Houma-Thibodeaux area, which
boasts an unemployment rate below 3%. Energy is something that affects
our daily lives and my colleagues and I are continuing to work to make
it more affordable, reliable and beneficial. We passed a series of
energy bills in the House last week to create jobs, lower gas prices at
the pump, and increase America's energy security.

The President violates the
Constitution
Last
week the Supreme Court reminded the Obama Administration in its unanimous
ruling in National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning that no one,
not even President Obama, is above the law. In 2012, the President
made three recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) while the Senate was in pro forma session specifically to
prevent recess appointments. All nine Justices ruled these NLRB appointments
were unconstitutional, ultimately upholding the position of
Republicans in Congress and nullifying the president's lawless actions relating
to the NLRB. This unanimous ruling by the Supreme Court is just one
of many steps we are taking to stand up for the Constitution and push
back against President Obama when he abuses his
power.
The
Presidents failing economic strategy
A disappointing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) report
released last week showed our economy
contracted at a rate of nearly 3
percent
in the first three months of 2014
the sharpest economic contraction in five years. Clearly, Obama
economics is failing and American families need relief from his radical
agenda. Coincidentally, Obamacare, which formally launched in January, was
not only a significant factor in the economic decline, but also led to
a decline in consumer spending in health care. More broken promises
from this Administration, who
said
earlier this
year that it was consumer spending on health care that helped drive
economic growth in the first quarter. Government-run health care is
harming our nations economic growth. While Harry Reid refuses to
provide relief to hard-working Americans, my colleagues and I in the House
continue to pass bills that will create jobs and get our economy back
on track.
It is an honor to represent you in Congress. For more information
