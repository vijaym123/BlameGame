Dear Friends,
Right now you are probably hearing a lot about the mess in Washington.
You are probably reading about the IRS's targeting of conservatives
, their claim (which I don't buy for a second) to have
'accidentally' destroyed all of Lois Lerner's emails, and the recent
revelation that Lois Lerner single-handily tried to audit
United States Senator Chuck Grassley. You may have
seen the Supreme Court's recent unanimous rebuke
of President Obama's
Unconstitutional recess appointments to the National Labor Relations
Board. You may have also noticed, despite the President's claim that
the economy is on the right track, our economy shrank 2.9%
in the first quarter of this
year. All of this, and the worst is yet to come with the ObamaCare
employer mandate
going into effect later this year.
While we have all of this bad news, I remain focused on finding
solutions that put our nation back on track and boost America's bottom
line. This week, the House
passed H.R. 4899, the Lowering Gasoline
Prices to Fuel an America that Works Act. This bill would unleash the
potential economic activity currently constrained by the
Administration's energy priorities by directing the Secretary of
Interior to develop a new 5-year oil and gas program with emphasis
placed on areas with the greatest energy potential. It will expand
domestic energy production and cut red tape. The bill also included my
amendment to specifically include South Carolina in the administrative
planning area for offshore leasing purposes.
The potential for expanded energy production in South Carolina is too
great to ignore. It is estimated that opening up these areas for energy
production would create over 35,000 jobs, generate $2.7 billion in
annual economic activity, and bring $3.7 billion in cumulative state
revenue by 2035 to South Carolina. In addition to this, think about how
much consumers would save if we could just lower the price of fuel by
one dollar. Besides the money it would save mom and dad on their drive
to work or to drop off the kids at school, this would amount to $300 in
savings for every 18 wheeler on the road per fill up. Imagine how that
could lower prices on everyday commodities marked up from
transportation costs and the increased energy costs associated with
growing our food.
As we plan ahead for a more secure energy future, opening access to new
areas of our outer continental shelf is a no brainer. I hope you will
watch my full comments on the House Floor. As always, I appreciate your
feedback.

Dear
Friends,
Right
now
you
are
probably
hearing
a
lot
about
the
mess
in
Washington.
You
are
probably
reading
about
the
IRS&#8217;s
targeting
of
conservatives ,
their
claim
(which
I
don&#8217;t
buy
for
a
second)
to
have
&#8216;accidentally&#8217;
destroyed
all
of
Lois
Lerner&#8217;s
emails,
and
the
recent
revelation
that
Lois
Lerner
single-handily
tried
to
audit
United
States
Senator
Chuck
Grassley.
You
may
have
seen
the
Supreme
Court&#8217;s
recent
unanimous
rebuke
of
President
Obama&#8217;s
Unconstitutional
recess
appointments
to
the
National
Labor
Relations
Board.
You
may
have
also
noticed,
despite
the
President&#8217;s
claim
that
the
economy
is
on
the
right
track,
our
economy
shrank
2.9%
in
the
first
quarter
of
this
year.
All
of
this,
and
the
worst
is
yet
to
come
with
the
ObamaCare
employer
mandate
going
into
effect
later
this
year&#8230;
While
we
have
all
of
this bad
news,
I remain
focused
on finding
solutions
that put our nation
back
on
track
and
boost
America's
bottom
line. This
week,
the
House
passed
H.R.
4899,
the
Lowering
Gasoline
Prices
to
Fuel
an
America
that
Works
Act.
This
bill
would
unleash
the
potential
economic
activity
currently
constrained
by
the
Administration&#8217;s
energy
priorities
by
directing
the
Secretary
of
Interior
to
develop
a
new
5-year
oil
and
gas
program
with
emphasis
placed
on
areas
with
the
greatest
energy

It
will
expand
domestic
energy
production
and
cut
red

The
bill
also
included
my
amendment
to
specifically
include
South
Carolina
in
the
administrative

area
for
offshore
leasing
purposes.
The
potential
for
expanded
energy
production
in
South
Carolina
is
too
great
to
ignore.
It
is
estimated
that
opening

these

production
would
create
over
35,000
jobs,
generate
$2.7

in
annual
economic
activity,
and
bring
$3.7
billion
in
cumulative
state
revenue
by
2035
to
South
Carolina.
In
addition
to
this,
think
about
how
much
consumers
would
save
if
we
could
just
lower
the
price
of
fuel
by
one
dollar.
Besides
the
money
it

mom
and

Imagine
how
that
could

on
everyday
commodities
marked
up from
transportation
costs
and
the
increased
energy
costs
associated

As
we
plan

for
a
more
secure
energy
future,
opening
access
to
new
areas
of
our
outer
continental
shelf
is
a

the
House
Floor. As
always,
I appreciate
your
