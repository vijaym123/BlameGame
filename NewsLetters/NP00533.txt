CONSTITUENT SERVICES
VISITING DC
May 26, 2015
Last week, The
Hill ran
an opinion piece I wrote
about
fixing education funding for low-income children. This funding inequity
must be fixed for a simple reason -- when federal money is intended to
assist the neediest Americans, it must actually go to that very group.
Otherwise, we are shortchanging the low income students we are trying
to help. Read my op-ed in full
here
and more about
my funding fix
here .
I am also pleased
to report that one of my bills is heading to the Presidents desk. On
May 19, the House passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act,
which includes
a bipartisan provision I wrote
to close a legal loophole that currently enables some sex offenders
to evade registration with the National Sex Offender Registry
(NSOR).
I am pleased that this legislation
which will hold
convicted military sex offenders accountable -- will be signed into law.
Closing this loophole is critical to preventing sex offenders from
being able to recommit heinous crimes once released from the military
justice system. When we know a problem exists, we cannot look the other
way. Read more about the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act
here .
ICYMI: The Wall Street Journal ran
a good editorial on the Patriot Act
in Wednesdays
paper. An untested leap to replace a framework that has been useful in
the 14 years since 9/11 will make intelligence more time-consuming and
less efficient. Read more
here .
It was
announced last week that money from the Land and Water Conservation
Fund (LWCF) allowed Mulberry Creek to be added to Pisgah National Forest.
LWCF is the best dollar-for-dollar conservation program Congress has
ever created and has a proven track record of making good on their
promise to conserve parks, open spaces, and wildlife habitats for the
benefit of future generations. Check out this reporting from the
Asheville Citizen-Times on the addition
here .
I
hope you and your family had a good holiday weekend and that you spent
time contemplating the real meaning behind Memorial Day. As I said
yesterday at Battleship North Carolinas memorial observance event,
Memorial Day is a day of remembrance. Its not the start of summer. Its
not the day the pools open. Its a day to remember the sacrifices of so
many.
Without their sacrifice, the America we know would not
exist. Without their service, we would not live in a country where we
may live and speak freely without fear of punishment. To the men and
women who died for our freedom, and to their families, thank you and
God bless you.
Sen. Burr
giving his Memorial Day speech on USS North Carolina in Wilmington,
NC
Sincerely,
Richard Burr
