Rubio, Colleagues To Boehner: We
Must ProtectCongressional
Authority, Prohibit Obamacare
Bailout
Marco led a group of Republican
senators in urging House Speaker John
Boehner (R-OH) to protect Congress
power of the purse and prohibit the Obama
administration from dispersing unlawful
risk corridor payments that expose
taxpayers to an ObamaCare bailout of
health insurance companies.
In
a
letter to Speaker Boehner , the
senators expressed concern over the
Administrations intent to
disregard Congressional authority by
spending unappropriated and unauthorized
funds through ObamaCares risk
corridor program, and highlighted the
risk the program poses to taxpayers
should insurers systematically lose money
on exchange plans.
Unfortunately, President
Obama and his administration have
exhibited their intent to disregard the
law and ignore the Constitution,
wrote the senators .
The American people expect
us, as Members of Congress, to fulfill
our Oath of Office and defend the
Constitution,
the senators added .
Therefore, we must act to
protect Congress power of the
purse and prohibit the Obama
administration from dispersing unlawful
risk corridor payments providing for an
Obamacare taxpayer bailout.
Marco discussed the need to prevent an
ObamaCare bailout on The Lars
Larson Show. Listen to the

Senators Urge Kerry To Deny
Venezuela A Seat On U.N. Security
Council
Marco led a group of bipartisan
senators in urging Secretary of State
John Kerry to lead a diplomatic effort to
deny Venezuela a seat on the United
Nations Security Council (UNSC).
In addition to Marco, the letter was
signed by Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL),
Mark Kirk (R-IL), Bill Nelson (D-FL),
John McCain (R-AZ) and Senate Foreign
Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez
(D-NJ).
In
the
letter to Kerry , the senators
highlighted the gross human rights
violations committed under the oppressive
Maduro regime, and argued that granting
Venezuela a seat on the UNSC would
undermine the Administrations goal
of promoting international peace and
security.
In addition to President
Maduros vocal disdain for the
United Nations, his governments
actions, at the U.N. and at home, run
counter to the founding principles and
norms of the U.N. Charter, namely the
pursuit of international peace and
security and the promotion of human
rights and fundamental freedoms for all
people,
wrote the senators .
Venezuelas membership on
the U.N. Security Council would
constitute a serious blow for the
United States and United Nations at a
time when we must collaborate to
address the worlds most pressing
challenges.
In closing, we appeal to you
to undertake a broad based diplomatic
campaign to prevent Venezuela from
assuming a seat on the U.N. Security
Council,
the senators added .
ICYMI: Rubio: Why I Am Fighting For
School Choice, A Lifeline For
Low-Income Kids
In
an op-ed
for FOXNews.com , Marco weighed in on
the importance of school choice for
children in low-income families. An
excerpt of the article is below:
Parents everywhere share a
common dream: we all want our children
to have the chance at a life better
than our own. This has propelled the
progress of our nation and has become
an essential part of the American
Dream. To give children this chance,
every parent should be given the right
to choose the learning environment that
best fits their child's unique
needs.
In the 21st century, the
definition of public
education is changing rapidly.
It used to mean giving school districts
all the taxpayer dollars raised to
educate kids, and letting the districts
assign children to public schools
according to zip code. Fortunately, we
are moving to a new definition: letting
parents direct taxpayer
fundswith proper
accountabilityto different
providers, even different delivery
methods.
For hundreds of thousands of
children and parents, Florida's Tax
Credit Scholarship Program has brought
the American Dream within reach. An
attack on it is an attack on our shared
ideals of opportunity, choice, and
freedom.
As a representative of this
state and a supporter of all
parents opportunity to give
their kids a better future, I
wont stand for it. Together, we
should raise our voices in defense of
this program. Thousands of children are
counting on us.

Constituent Casework Corner
Paul, a disabled veteran from North
Florida, contacted Senator Rubio's office
earlier this year to request temporary
100% compensation for a knee surgery
performed in 2012. The Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) promised to
compensate him for the service-related
surgery in January 2013, but Paul had not
received any payment. A member of the
staff contacted the VA, provided
additional documentation as requested,
and ensured that the case was given the
proper consideration it deserved. The VA
finally approved the payment and
deposited a check in his account last
month. In addition, Paul's
disability rating was increased, and his
monthly benefit is now $1,652.55.
