Dear Friends,
This week I had the honor of giving the keynote address at the World
War II memorial in Washington, DC on Victory in Europe Day (V-E Day)
commemorating the defeat of Adolph Hitler and the Nazi Third Reich.
While there, I couldn't help but think of my father, who served as a
Bombadier on a B-17. My hero, James Addington McCaul Jr.
participated in 32 bombing attacks including the largest bombing
mission in U.S. history in support of the D-Day invasion. He, along
with the countless other heroes that make up the "Greatest Generation"
served their country with honor, many making the ultimate sacrifice for
the country and freedoms they loved. We must honor them by carrying the
torch of freedom they kept from being extinguished, and pass on a
republic to our children that is in better shape than the one we
inherited. You can watch my remarks below.
On Thursday the House of Representatives voted to form a S
elect Committee on the Events
Surrounding Benghazi
. I voted in favor of forming this
Select Committee. We owe it to the victims, their families, and the
American people to find out the truth. We must have justice and we must
have accountability. It is my hope this Select Committee will produce
both.
The House of Representative also found former IRS official Lois Lerner
in contempt of Congress
for her refusal to answer
questions regarding the IRS' targeting of politically conservative
groups. Along with finding Ms. Lerner in contempt, the House voted in a
bipartisan manner to pass a resolution calling on Attorney General
Holder to appoint a special counsel to investigate the IRS' actions, a
resolution I supported in the hope the American people will finally be
told the truth about this scandal.
On Wednesday at a hearing of the Homeland Security Committee,
the new Inspector General of the
Department of Homeland Security assured me the allegations against his
predecessor, Charles Edwards, of coordination and collusion with the
Obama Administration are being investigated. The Inspector General is
supposed to be a watchdog and provide independent oversight, not alter
and delay investigations at the request of the administration. Congress
and the American people will not tolerate the fox guarding the hen
house. Video of my Q&A; on this matter is below.

Dear
Friends,
This
week
I
had
the
honor
of
giving
the
keynote
address
at
the
World
War

memorial
in
Washington,
DC
on
Victory
in
Europe
Day
(V-E
Day)
commemorating
the
defeat
of
Adolph
Hitler
and
the
Nazi
Third

While
there,
I
couldn't
help
but
think
of
my
father,
who
served
as
a
Bombadier
on
a
B-17.
My
hero,
James
Addington
McCaul
Jr.
participated
in
32
bombing
attacks
including
the
largest
bombing
mission
in
U.S.
history
in
support
of
the
D-Day

He,
along
with
the
countless
other

that
make
up
the
"Greatest

served
their

with
honor,
many
making
the

We
