We&rsquo;ve got nothing left, David:
-- Boehner just launched his biggest ad buy yet this week. $6 MILLION in misleading ads against Democrats.
-- A new poll shows us in a DEAD HEAT with Boehner's Republicans.
-- If we fall behind now, we will be past the point of no return. We will lose.
David, there&rsquo;s no time to lose. We need to hit 25O,OOO donations by MIDNIGHT to turn things around.
If we can do it, it&rsquo;ll be an epic comeback. But if we fall short, it&rsquo;ll be a tragic conclusion in our fight to beat Boehner.
