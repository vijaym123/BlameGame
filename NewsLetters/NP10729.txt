Dear Friend:
This week, the Senate voted to restore unemployment benefits for 2.8 million Americans.
Since Republicans first began blocking relief for America's long-term unemployed in December, more than half a million Californians have lost these critical benefits that help families put food on the table, gas in their cars and clothes on their children's backs.
I am pleased that the Senate took action, and now it is up to House Republicans to extend this lifeline for millions of Americans while they continue to look for work.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
