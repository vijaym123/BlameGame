Dear
friend,
Last week, I had the pleasure of welcoming New Hampshire
businesses and organizations to one of my favorite events of the year,
Experience New Hampshire . Hosted by New Hampshires
congressional delegation and the New Hampshire State Society, this
annual event gives New Hampshire businesses and organizations the
opportunity to come to Washington, DC to showcase their products and services
to policy makers and people on Capitol Hill. This was our fifth
Experience New Hampshire and more than 40 New Hampshire businesses and
organizations came down to represent our state. The event gets bigger and
better every year.
Experience New Hampshire is an
opportunity to share with Washington what we in New Hampshire know well: that
we have a diverse array of unique products, services and opportunities
that nowhere else can boast. Im proud to be able to share some of
what New Hampshire has to offer with people in Washington and I'm already
looking forward to next year's
event.
Sincerely,
Jeanne
