Friend,
If you ignore the bone-chilling cold and icy sidewalks, this week was
an exciting time to be in our nation's capital. That's because it's
always exciting to be here during the President's State of the Union
address.
I was seated toward the back of the House Chamber during the President's
speech (some people said they saw the back of my head on television . .
thankfully, that's my good side).
I was pleased to hear the President discuss concrete proposals to
expand economic opportunity and grow jobs during the State of the
Union. I was particularly pleased to see the President advocate for
policies I'm fighting for in Congress like workforce development and
support for the kind of basic research that promotes innovation and job
creation.
While the economy has made progress since the depths of the recession,
we all know there is more to do to get this economy humming at a faster
pace. Unfortunately, for too long, Congressional inaction and
dysfunction have caused some real problems for our economic recovery
and for folks in in our neck of the woods.
I've always said that we work best when all oars are in the water
rowing the same direction, rather than using the oars to beat each
other over the heads. Recently we saw Congress come together and pass a
bipartisan budget. I hope that can be a blueprint for future bipartisan
collaboration to help small businesses and move our economy forward. We
need to get the economy - and this Congress - back on track.
The House STEM App Challenge
This week I invited high school students from Washington's
6thCongressional District to participate in the first annual
Congressional Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) Academic
Competition, "The House STEM App Challenge."
This new competition is designed to engage students' creativity and
encourage their participation in STEM education fields. As a dad of two
little girls who will one day be entering a workforce that needs
skilled workers, and as a guy with a background in economic
development, I know the increasing role technology is playing in the
economy. We should always look for more opportunities to engage young
people about the value of a STEM education.
I'm fighting for increased investment in STEM education because I
believe that our nation's ability to compete for the jobs of tomorrow
requires giving the students of today greater opportunity to use
technology to create products.
In this competition, local high school students will compete against
other students in the 6th Congressional District by creating and
exhibiting a software application or "app" for mobile, tablet, or
computer devices on a platform of their choice.
Throughout the completion period, participating students will be
provided opportunities to engage with various STEM educational partners
located throughout the community to mentor and assist them with their
app development.
Students entering the competition must provide a
YouTube video demo explaining their app and what they learned through
this competition process.
Students can submit their apps for consideration between Saturday,
February 1 at 12 pm eastern time and Wednesday April 30 at 12 pm
eastern time. For additional details on how to participate, please call
my office or visit http://kilmer.house.gov/house-app-contest
.
I'm looking forward to seeing the innovative apps created by students
in our region!
Valentines for Vets
In addition to the STEM App Challenge, I wanted to share an exciting
project my office is working on. I'm asking local elementary school
teachers to have their classes put together Valentines for Veterans to
be passed out at Washington Veteran's Home in Retsil, as part of
National Salute to Veteran Patients Week.
If you are a teacher of an elementary class and you'd like to
participate (or if you are a parent with a kiddo who wants to take
part), please have cards mailed to my office or arrange for pick up
from one of my staff members by February 7th.
Please do not include any personal contact info and address the cards
generically to a Veteran. Contact my Bremerton Office for more
information at (360) 373-9725.
Those who serve our nation have made our country stronger. We should
take every opportunity to thank them for their sacrifices.
As always, I invite you to reach out to me if I can ever lend a hand.
Remember, I work for you!
Sincerely,
Derek

If

this

We

the
value
of
a
