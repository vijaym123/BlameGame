Congressman Lamborn
Cosponsors Two Bills to Help Veterans
4/30/13
Congressman Doug Lamborn has
signed on as a cosponsor to two important pieces of legislation
designed to help our veterans.
H.R.
3456 , To amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the enrollment of
veterans in certain courses of education, and for other
purposes.
The bill notes that the experience
for veterans as they look to obtain a college degree is unique because
they often face the
challenge of balancing
deployments, families, and full-time jobs.
HR 3456 aims
to give veterans flexibility in enrolling in college courses in order
to allow them to get the most of their VA/DoD education benefits. It
would require colleges and universities that have an existing
priority/early course enrollment system (typically granted to student athletes
and honor students), and receive tuition payments from the Department
of Defense (DoD) or the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), to grant
the same priority to student veterans, service members and their
dependents using VA education benefits.
H.R.
4217 , To prohibit a reduction in funding for the defense commissary
system in fiscal year 2015 pending the report of the Military
Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission.
The
Presidents budget proposes a $1B cut to the annual commissary subsidy over
the next three years (from $1.4B annually now to $400M by 2017).
Although the Pentagon has stated that these recommendations do not cut
anyones pay, the drastic reduction in commissary funding is undeniably
a de facto pay cut.
If passed, H.R. 4217 would prohibit
the reduction of funding for commissaries until the Military
Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission has looked at the
entirety of military compensation and presents its findings to
Congress.
