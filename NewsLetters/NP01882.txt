Dear Friend:
As your Congressman, it's important I hear from you about the issues most important to you and your family. Please take a moment to answer the question below.
I also wanted to let you know that, in order to better serve you, I've launched a new website. This will make it easier for you to stay up-to-date on what I'm doing in Washington and East Tennessee, send me an email, follow me on social media and contact my offices if you need assistance with a federal agency. One of my highest honors as a Congressman is helping East Tennesseans, so please don't hesitate to contact me anytime.
I hope you'll take a couple minutes to answer the question below and to visit www.roe.house.gov and let me know what you think.
Thank you for your time and for allowing me to serve you in Congress.
Sincerely,
Phil
