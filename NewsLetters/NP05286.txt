I am writing to share an op-ed I wrote concerning the United States'
strategy to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria that appeared in
the Charlotte Sun on October 21, 2014. As a Member of the House
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Committee on
Appropriations, I am deeply committed to monitoring and providing
critical oversight over our nation's engagements in Iraq and Syria and
across the region.
Please share your thoughts on whether you believe the President's
strategy is sufficient to defeating the Islamic State by visiting my

Underwhelming Force a Doomed Strategy vs. ISIL
"The early evidence indicates that this strategy is succeeding."
These are the words of White Press Secretary Josh Earnest, defending
President Obama's strategy to address the rise of the Islamic State of
Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).
Let's review some of that early evidence. As I write this, Islamic
State jihadists in Iraq have expanded their territory to include land
near Baghdad, and they are consolidating control of the large Anbar
Province. In Syria, ISIL fighters are laying siege to the Turkish
border city of Kobani, which may very soon fall under their control.
Meanwhile, new recruits are pouring into the region to join ISIL in its
fight. Even retired General John Allen, tasked by the President with
coordinating the international response to ISIL, has said the
extremists have "retained momentum" despite recent American airstrikes.
The enemy is consolidating control in areas already under its grasp,
expanding to take new cities and territories, and growing its forces by
the day. If this is success, what does failure look like?
I agree - strongly - with President Obama that ISIL poses a threat so
significant to our national security that we must destroy it. However,
I have grave doubts about the President's strategy of utilizing
underwhelming force to combat this threat. I fear that his plan of
launching airstrikes, arming and training so-called moderate rebels,
and then expecting them to finish the job of destroying ISIL in Syria
is doomed to fail.
As ISIL's influence, forces and atrocities grow by the day, we must
have a strategy that stands a chance of destroying them in their
tracks. If we are willing to put American lives at risk to fight ISIL,
including the pilots who will carry out these attacks and the advisors
who will be training the rebels, then they deserve a plan worthy of
their service and sacrifice.
Numerous, high-ranking officials in the military and the Obama
Administration - including the Vice President - have conceded that
ground troops may be necessary to defeat ISIL. Yet President Obama has
repeatedly insisted that he will not use ground troops under any
circumstances. This handcuffs our military strategists, hinders our
ability to succeed, tells our allies the United States is unwilling to
fully support them, and reassures our enemies that we are not resolute
in our commitment to defeat them.
Even as it claims - despite all evidence to the contrary - that the
strategy is succeeding, the Obama White House has been forced to
concede the limits of the airstrikes-only approach.
Just moments after declaring the early campaign a success, Earnest said
of the possible fall of Kobani, "So we certainly do not want the town
to fall. At the same time, our capacity to prevent that town from
falling is limited by the fact that airstrikes can only do so much."
Through omission, Earnest also admits the White House's most obvious
hole in its strategy: without the intelligence of US boots on the
ground, we have no way to measure failure or success.
The fact is, almost any military historian can tell you that a muddled
strategy that begins with underwhelming force, limited commitment and
predictable escalation stands little chance of success. In the face of
our enemies, the US needs to commit its vast military force and to
develop a clear exit strategy, but we have done neither. Even as ISIL
advances and continues to forcibly indoctrinate, enslave and murder
innocent civilians, we still have no clear plan to stop them beyond the
next airstrike. Even if we could financially and tactically destroy
ISIL with airstrikes alone, what would come next for a Syria still
governed by Assad? How would the Iraqi government and military maintain
control over the Anbar province?
Without a doubt, the American people are war weary, and the President's
reluctance to commit troops to the fight is understandable. However, as
Commander in Chief, he has a duty to deliver a plan that will protect
our national security. He has an obligation to rally public support for
the worthy cause of defeating ISIL. He should present, as soon as
possible, a clear, comprehensive plan - including an exit strategy - to
defeat the Islamic State in both Syria and Iraq. He should request an
authorization from Congress giving him the all the tools, resources and
support needed to achieve that goal. And when he does so, Congress
should return to Washington immediately to debate, amend and vote on
the President's proposal.
We can defeat ISIL, but right now, we are not. ISIL is winning, and we,
and our international partners, are losing. This is a fight worth
winning, but first, the President must decide that it's one worth
fighting.
Thank you,
Tom Rooney

Underwhelming
Force
a
Doomed
Strategy
vs.
ISIL
&#8220;The
early
evidence
indicates
that
this
strategy
is
succeeding.&#8221;
These
are
the
words
of
White
Press
Secretary
Josh
Earnest,
defending
President
Obama&#8217;s
strategy
to
address
the
rise
of
the
Islamic
State
of
Iraq
and
the
Levant
(ISIL).
Let&#8217;s
review
some
of
that
early
evidence.
As
I
write
this,
Islamic
State
jihadists
in
Iraq
have
expanded
their
territory
to
include
land
near
Baghdad,
and
they
are
consolidating
control
of
the
large
Anbar
Province.
In
Syria,
ISIL
fighters
are
laying
siege
to
the
Turkish
border
city
of
Kobani,
which
may
very
soon
fall
under
their
control.
Meanwhile,
new
recruits
are
pouring
into
the
region
to
join
ISIL
in
its
fight.
Even
retired
General
John
Allen,
tasked
by
the
President
with
coordinating
the
international
response
to
ISIL,
has
said
the
extremists
have
&#8220;retained
momentum&#8221;
despite
recent
American
airstrikes.
The
enemy
is
consolidating
control
in
areas
already
under
its
grasp,
expanding
to
take
new
cities
and
territories,
and
growing
its
forces
by
the
day.
If
this
is
success,
what
does
failure
look
like?
I
agree
&#8211;
strongly
&#8211;
with
President
Obama
that
ISIL
poses
a
threat
so
significant
to
our
national
security
that
we
must
destroy
it.
However,
I
have
grave
doubts
about
the
President&#8217;s
strategy
of
utilizing
underwhelming
force
to
combat
this
threat.
I
fear
that
his
plan
of
launching
airstrikes,
arming
and
training
so-called
moderate
rebels,
and
then
expecting
them
to
finish
the
job
of
destroying
ISIL
in
Syria
is
doomed
to
fail.
As
ISIL&#8217;s
influence,
forces
and
atrocities
grow
by
the
day,
we
must
have
a
strategy
that
stands
a
chance
of
destroying
them
in
their
tracks.
If
we
are
willing
to
put
American
lives
at
risk
to
fight
ISIL,
including
the
pilots
who
will
carry
out
these
attacks
and
the
advisors
who
will
be
training
the
rebels,
then
they
deserve
a
plan
worthy
of
their
service
and
sacrifice.
Numerous,
high-ranking
officials
in
the
military
and
the
Obama
Administration
&#8211;
including
the
Vice
President
&#8211;
have
conceded
that
ground
troops
may
be
necessary
to
defeat
ISIL.
Yet
President
Obama
has
repeatedly
insisted
that
he
will
not
use
ground
troops
under
any
circumstances.
This
handcuffs
our
military
strategists,
hinders
our
ability
to
succeed,
tells
our
allies
the
United
States
is
unwilling
to
fully
support
them,
and
reassures
our
enemies
that
we
are
not
resolute
in
our
commitment
to
defeat
them.
Even
as
it
claims
&#8211;
despite
all
evidence
to
the
contrary
&#8211;
that
the
strategy
is
succeeding,
the
Obama
White
House
has
been
forced
to
concede
the
limits
of
the
airstrikes-only
approach.
Just
moments
after
declaring
the
early
campaign
a
success,
Earnest
said
of
the
possible
fall
of
Kobani,
&#8220;So
we
certainly
do
not
want
the
town
to
fall.
At
the
same
time,
our
capacity
to
prevent
that
town
from
falling
is
limited
by
the
fact
that
airstrikes
can
only
do
so
much.&#8221;
Through
omission,
Earnest
also
admits
the
White
House&#8217;s
most
obvious
hole
in
its
strategy:
without
the
intelligence
of
US
boots
on
the
ground,
we
have
no
way
to
measure
failure
or
success.
The
fact
is,
almost
any
military
historian
can
tell
you
that
a
muddled
strategy
that
begins
with
underwhelming
force,
limited
commitment
and
predictable
escalation
stands
little
chance
of
success.
In
the
face
of
our
enemies,
the
US
needs
to
commit
its
vast
military
force
and
to
develop
a
clear
exit
strategy,
but
we
have
done
neither.
Even
as
ISIL
advances
and
continues
to
forcibly
indoctrinate,
enslave
and
murder
innocent
civilians,
we
still
have
no
clear
plan
to
stop
them
beyond
the
next
airstrike.
Even
if
we
could
financially
and
tactically
destroy
ISIL
with
airstrikes
alone,
what
would
come
next
for
a
Syria
still
governed
by
Assad?
How
would
the
Iraqi
government
and
military
maintain
control
over
the
Anbar
province?
Without
a
doubt,
the
American
people
are
war
weary,
and
the
President&#8217;s
reluctance
to
commit
troops
to
the
fight
is
understandable.
However,
as
Commander
in
Chief,
he
has
a
duty
to
deliver
a
plan
that
will
protect
our
national
security.
He
has
an
obligation
to
rally
public
support
for
the
worthy
cause
of
defeating
ISIL.
He
should
present,
as
soon
as
possible,
a
clear,
comprehensive
plan
&#8211;
including
an
exit
strategy
&#8211;
to
defeat
the
Islamic
State
in
both
Syria
and
Iraq.
He
should
request
an
authorization
from
Congress
giving
him
the
all
the
tools,
resources
and
support
needed
to
achieve
that
goal.
And
when
he
does
so,
Congress
should
return
to
Washington
immediately
to
debate,
amend
and
vote
on
the
President&#8217;s
proposal.
We
can
defeat
ISIL,
but
right
now,
we
are
not.
ISIL
is
winning,
and
we,
and
our
international
partners,
are
losing.
This
is
a
fight
worth
winning,
but
first,
the
President
must
decide
that
it&#8217;s
one
worth
fighting.
