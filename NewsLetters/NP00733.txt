CONGRESSMAN PITTENGER
CO-SPONSORS LEGISLATION
TO BAN MOST LATE TERM
ABORTIONS
This week I voted to
ensure babies born alive during abortion procedures are rushed to the
hospital for medical care and not left to die on their
own.
The
Pain-Capable Unborn Child
Protection Act
(H.R 36)
also places reasonable limits on
late-term abortions, based on substantial medical research demonstrating
that children feel pain at or before the 20th week of a
pregnancy.
This week, some Members of Congress actually implied that
protecting helpless little babies was bad for the economy. This is the
United States of America!
We protect the helpless, the defenseless,
and the weak.
We are proud as a nation to stand up for the
rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
When we
kill babies for convenience, we should not be surprised by the
terrible culture of violence which grips other areas of
society.
The
Pain-Capable Unborn
Child Protection Act , which I co-sponsored, bans all abortions in
the United States beginning 20 weeks after fertilization, except in
cases of rape, incest, or a specific threat to life of the mother.
The legislation also includes born-alive infant protections to
safeguard children delivered alive during abortion procedures.
Currently, these children can be left to die.
Babies born
prematurely at 20 weeks routinely survive thanks to the excellent medical
care provided by Neo-Natal Intensive Care professionals. We should work
together to preserve and enhance life, not toss it in the
trash.
The
Pain-Capable Unborn
Child Protection Act
passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a
bipartisan vote of 242-184 and now awaits action by the U.S. Senate and
President Obama.

HONORING THREE OUTSTANDING POLICE
OFFICERS
Lost in recent headlines is the fact that most
police officers are dedicated, sacrificial, and
servant-hearted.
While the news media focuses on the "bad,"
we must
never forget to thank our brave police officers for all the good they
do each and every day, including putting their lives on the line to
protect us.
This week, I addressed the U.S. House
of Representatives in honor of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Officers
Harlan Proctor, Ashley Brown, and Scott Evett, who
quietly and
humbly assisted the children of a recent domestic violence homicide
victim.
Click here for full
video
of my speech in honor of CMPD Officers Proctor, Brown, and
Evett.
In the aftermath of a
tragic domestic violence homicide and arson, Officer Proctor was
assigned to drive the victim's children to the police station, and listened
attentively as they discussed losing everything, including an
8-year-old's favorite dress.
Officers Proctor, Brown, and
Evett thoughtfully contacted Target to track down that favorite dress, and
with donations from these officers and Target, were able to provide
clothes, toys, and gift cards to help the family recover in this
distressing time.
Please join me in thanking Officers
Proctor, Evett, and Brown for their humble acts of service , and
thanking all the brave and dedicated police officers across the United
States who put their lives on the line to protect us each and every
day, and still make time to perform thoughtful acts of kindness in our
communities.
May God bless them.
