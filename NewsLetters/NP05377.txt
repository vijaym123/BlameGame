-- the election is exactly 17 DAYS away
-- a new poll showed us within a SINGLE-DIGIT
--
and we&rsquo;re in danger of missing our final budget deadline
The numbers are daunting: there&rsquo;s only 48 hours to close the gap, but we&rsquo;re coming up $12,398 short of our goal.
So David, we&rsquo;ve got a choice to make. Either we help Cheri make up the difference --
or we fall short and let this election slip through our fingers.
Please, don&rsquo;t let that happen. Chip in what you can:
