Rep. Miller on Secret Exchange of Five Senior Taliban Detainees at Guantanamo for U.S. Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl
Washington &#8211; Today, U.S. Representative
Candice Miller (MI-10), Vice Chair of the House Homeland Security Committee and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security, issued the following statement on the Administration&#8217;s decision to release five Taliban detainees held at Guantanamo
in exchange for the release of U.S. Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl:
&quot;Less than one week after announcing that the U.S. will maintain nearly 10,000 troops in Afghanistan, President Obama brokered
a secret deal with the Taliban to release five of their senior leaders &#8211; all of whom have American blood on their hands &#8211; in exchange for U.S. Sergeant Bergdahl.
&#8220;While I join the nation in welcoming Sergeant Bergdahl home, I have serious reservations about President Obama&#8217;s willingness
to negotiate with terrorists and believe that his actions &#8211; likely illegal &#8211; will jeopardize the safety of our troops still serving overseas.
&#8220;With this exchange, the President has just put a price tag on those who have already put themselves in harm&#8217;s way for our
protection.
And now, more than ever, it is imperative that we bring our troops home.
If the President thinks it is safe enough to release these terrorists, than it should be safe enough to bring our soldiers home.&#8221;
