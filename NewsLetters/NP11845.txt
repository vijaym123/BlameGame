Dear Friend -
In my last email, I asked you to take a survey about your thoughts and priorities for this year. Below this note are the responses so far.
Haven't taken the survey? Don't worry, you can still
take the survey here at any time.
I truly value your input.
I also want you to know that House rules prohibit me from emailing you until after the June 3rd primary election
unless you subscribe now.
It&rsquo;s easy to subscribe! All you need to do is
click here
and enter your email address. I hope you'll keep in touch!
Top survey results so far :
Which of the following would you MOST like Congress to address this year?
- 52.19% of you said, "Economy"
Do you think Orange County&rsquo;s economy is heading in the right direction?
- 37.85% of you said, "I'm not sure"
Are you experiencing difficulties enrolling for affordable health care through Covered CA?
