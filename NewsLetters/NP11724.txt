I wanted to share with you some excellent education programs and resources that are available to educators across the country for free through the Library of Congress. These resources include everything from Webcasts and interactive student activities, to more than 85 lesson plans for subjects like government, history, literature, and more.
Additionally, the Library grants teachers free access to its collection of more than 19 million primary source documents,
including photographs, maps, and historical documents. For teachers themselves, the Library offers online professional development curriculum and self-serve interactive modules to assist educators with their continuing education requirements. To help you make the best use of the Librarys wealth of resources, you can access an educational outreach team that offers on-request. Find out more on the Teachers Page
here .
Yours in service,
Randy
