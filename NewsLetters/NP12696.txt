Fighting for Women in our Nation's Capital
Hi Everyone!
I hope you all had a great weekend. I spent last week in Washington,
working to preserve women's access to health and advocating for New
Hampshire farmers.
Speaking against H.R. 7
Advocating for Women's Health
Last Wednesday, I opposed and spoke out against legislation that would
callously restrict women's access to reproductive health care. This
legislation, H.R. 7, would deny tax credits to women and small
businesses using private funds to purchase comprehensive health
coverage (Please watch the floor speech here
).
This bill would deny access to comprehensive health care for millions
of women. When women are denied the freedom to make their own personal
health care decisions, their economic opportunities are diminished as
well. Instead of denying tax credits to women and small businesses
seeking affordable health coverage, Congress needs to work together to
empower women and increase opportunity.
With a supporter of women's health from NH
Earlier on Wednesday, I also took part in a rally with House members
and national pro-choice leaders to protest the bill and instruct
Congress to focus instead on jobs, economic opportunity, and other
critical issues facing the country.
A Huge Step for NH Farmers
On Wednesday, I was pleased to vote with a majority of my colleagues to
pass the bipartisan Agricultural Act of 2014, also known as the Farm
Bill. After working on this legislation for nearly a year and speaking
with farmers, foresters, and consumers all across New Hampshire, I was
proud to join Republicans and Democrats to pass this important bill.
This legislation isn't perfect, but it is a true compromise that will
provide our agricultural producers with the support they need to thrive
and continue providing Granite Staters with fresh, nutritious, and safe
food.
This Farm Bill makes great strides in providing support for the growing
local foods movement and for beginning farmers and ranchers. As the
first New Hampshire Representative to serve on the Agriculture
Committee in more than seventy years, I'm proud to have worked to
include Granite State priorities in the bill, including support for
organic farmers, healthy forests, and wildlife conservation.
And as a
member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am particularly pleased
that this bill contains several provisions to assist veterans pursuing
careers in agriculture.
Helping to Connect Veterans With Employers
On Tuesday, I attended a Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing entitled
"What can the Federal Government Learn from the Private Sector's
Successful Approach to Hiring Veterans?"
The hearing was a great
chance to witness what some of our nation's major companies and
business groups are doing to hire veterans. The participants included
Wal-Mart, Microsoft, JP Morgan Chase & Co., International Franchise
Association, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
It was inspiring to hear how the private sector's commitment to
improving veteran employment was helping our service members and
families get the benefits they deserve. I was pleased to learn about
some of the successes the private sector has had in hiring, retaining,
and promoting veterans. These organizations are leading the way in
providing jobs and support for our military families, and I look
forward to working with my colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs
Committee to continue this bipartisan effort.
Helping a Granite State Olympian Get to Sochi
Earlier last week, my office was contacted by Julia Krass, a
16-year-old skier from Hanover who will be competing in slopestyle for
Team USA at the Sochi Olympics. Julia's family informed my staff that
Julia's visa application had been delayed and that there was a chance
she would not be able to travel to Russia this week with the rest of
the team as planned, missing out on critical pre-Olympic training.
Fortunately, after working for hours with multiple government agencies
and the Russian Consulate to resolve the issue, we succeeded in
expediting the process in time for Julia to leave on time. I am
overjoyed that Julia will be in Sochi to represent the United States
and proud that we were able to play a role in making sure this talented
Granite State skier is able to compete on the world stage.
Have a fantastic week and thanks for everything you do to make New
Hampshire such a great place to live!

Fighting
for
Women
in
our
Nation&#8217;s
Capital
Hi
Everyone!
I
hope
you
all
had
a
great
weekend. I
spent
last
week
in
Washington,
working
to
preserve
women&#8217;s
access

New

Advocating

Last
Wednesday,
I
opposed
and
spoke
out
against
legislation
that
would
callously
restrict
women&#8217;s
access
to
reproductive
health
care.
This
legislation,
H.R.
7,
would
deny
tax
credits
to
women
and
small
businesses
using
private
funds
to
purchase
comprehensive
health
coverage
(Please
watch
the
floor
speech
here ).
This
bill
would
deny
access
to
comprehensive
health
care
for
millions
of
women.
When
women
are
denied
the
freedom
to
make
their
own
personal
health
care
decisions,
their
economic
opportunities
are
diminished
as
well.
Instead
of
denying
tax
credits
to
women
and
small
businesses
seeking
affordable
health
coverage,
Congress
needs
to
work
together
to
empower
women
and
increase
opportunity.
With
a
supporter
of
women's
health
from
NH Earlier
on
Wednesday,
I
also
took
part
in
a
rally
with
House
members
and
national

to
protest
the

and
instruct
Congress
to

instead
on
jobs,
economic

and
other

facing
the
country.

NH
Farmers
On

I
was
pleased
to

with
a

of
my

to
pass
the
bipartisan
Agricultural

of
2014 ,
also
known
as
the

for
nearly

I

but
it

agricultural

with
the
support
they

continue

This
Farm
Bill
makes
great
strides
in
providing
support
for
the
growing
local
foods
movement
and
for
beginning
farmers
and
ranchers. As
the
first
New
Hampshire
Representative
to
serve
on
the
Agriculture
Committee
in
more
than
seventy
years,
I&#8217;m
proud
to
have
worked
to
include
Granite
State
priorities
in
the
bill,
including
support
for
organic
farmers,
healthy

and
wildlife
conservation.
And
as
a

of
the
Veterans&#8217;
Affairs
Committee,
I
am
particularly
pleased
that
this
bill
contains
several
provisions
to

veterans
pursuing
careers
in
agriculture.
Helping
to
Connect
Veterans
With
Employers
On
Tuesday,
I
attended
a
Veterans&#8217;
Affairs
Committee
hearing
entitled
&#8220;What
can
the
Federal
Government
Learn
from
the
Private
Sector&#8217;s
Successful
Approach
to
Hiring
Veterans?&#8221;
The
hearing
was
a
great
chance
to
witness
what
some
of
our
nation&#8217;s
major
companies
and
business
groups
are
doing
to
hire
veterans. The
participants
included
Wal-Mart,
Microsoft,
JP
Morgan
Chase
&amp;
Co.,
International
Franchise
Association,
and
the
U.S.
Chamber
of
Commerce.
It
was
inspiring
to
hear
how
the
private
sector&#8217;s
commitment
to
improving
veteran
employment
was
helping
our
service
members
and
families
get
the
benefits
they
deserve. I
was
pleased
to
learn
about
some
of
the
successes
the
private
sector
has
had
in
hiring,
retaining,
and
promoting
veterans. These
organizations
are
leading
the
way
in
providing
jobs
and
support
for
our
military
families,
and
I
look
forward
to
working
with
my
colleagues
on
the
Veterans&#8217;
Affairs
Committee
to
continue
this
bipartisan
effort.
Helping
a
Granite
State
Olympian
Get
to
Sochi
Earlier
last
week,
my
office
was
contacted
by
Julia
Krass,
a
16-year-old
skier
from
Hanover
who
will
be
competing
in
slopestyle
for
Team
USA
at
the
Sochi
Olympics. Julia&#8217;s
family
informed
my
staff
that
Julia&#8217;s
visa
application
had
been
delayed
and
that
there
was
a
chance
she
would
not
be
able
to
travel
to
Russia
this
week
with
the
rest
of
the
team
as
planned,
missing
out
on
critical
pre-Olympic
training.
Fortunately,
after
working
for
hours
with
multiple
government
agencies
and
the
Russian
Consulate
to
resolve
the
issue,
we
succeeded
in
expediting
the
process
in
time
for
Julia
to
leave
on
time. I
am
overjoyed
that
Julia
will
be
in
Sochi
to
represent
the
United
States
and
proud
that
we
were
able
to
play
a
role
in
making
sure
this
talented
Granite
State
skier
is
able
to
compete
on
the
world
stage.
Have
a
fantastic
week
and
thanks
for
everything
you
do
to
make
New
Hampshire
such
a
great
place
to
live!
