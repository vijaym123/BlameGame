Standing
Up for Life on the 42nd Anniversary of Roe v.
Wade
1/22/15
This week, Congressman Doug Lamborn spoke from the Floor of
the House on the importance of supporting a culture of life in America.
The Congressman also voted for H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding
for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2015. H.R. 7
codifies the Hyde amendment and requires that
No funds
authorized or appropriated by Federal law, and none of the funds in any trust
fund to which funds are authorized or appropriated by Federal law,
shall be expended for any abortion.
The funding limitations do
not apply to an abortion related to rape, incest, or preserving the life
of the mother. The bill prohibits premium tax credits and
cost-sharing subsidies under the Affordable Care Act from being used to purchase
health plans that cover abortion, except in case of rape, incest, or
preserving the life of the mother.

Text of the
Speech
Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks
the 42 nd
anniversary of the infamous Roe v. Wade Supreme
Court decision, which legalized abortion in the United
States.
Elective abortion is an abhorrent
practice that tragically remains one of the most common medical procedures
performed in the United States. Each year in the United States over
one million abortions are performed.
Since 1973, when Roe v. Wade
was decided, 57 million babies have been lost to abortion.
57
million, Mr. Speaker! To put this in perspective, according to the last
census numbers, 57 million is roughly 18 percent of the current
population in the US. This staggering loss of childrens lives is
unconscionable.
My wife Jeanie and I
have been blessed with 5 children, and 2 grandchildren, with one more
grandchild on the way. I firmly believe every life is a precious gift
from God, and I remain wholly committed to protecting the sanctity of
life.
One critically important
step towards protecting life is the Pain Capable Unborn Child
Protection Act that we will be voting on tomorrow.
I am a proud cosponsor
of this bill that will prohibit anyone from performing an abortion on
an unborn child that is 20 weeks or older.
Medical research has
shown that at least by the 20 th
week of a pregnancy,
unborn babies can feel pain.
Polls have consistently shown that a
majority of Americans support banning abortions after 20 weeks.
Abortions after the 20 th
week are violent, painful and harmful
to mothers. It is time to end this horrible
procedure.
This week we continue to mourn the lives cut
short in the inhumane wake of Roe v. Wade and we pray for Gods
continued comfort, grace, and mercy to those touched by abortion. Every
life has value, and we have a duty to protect the lives of those who are
most innocent among us. I will continue to be among those fighting to
do just that.
