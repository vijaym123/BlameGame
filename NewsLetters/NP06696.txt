Senator McConnell Honored by the American Farm Bureau
McConnell received nomination from the Kentucky Farm Bureau.
LOUISVILLE, KY
&ndash; U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell was named a &ldquo;Friend of Farm Bureau&rdquo; on Friday by the American Farm Bureau Federation.
The award is given each Congress and is based upon members&rsquo; voting records and their accessibility and responsiveness to their states farmers.
Senator McConnell was nominated for the award for the 113th Congress by the Kentucky Farm Bureau.
&ldquo;Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell&rsquo;s 2014 &lsquo;Friend of Farm Bureau&rsquo; Award was earned, not given,&rdquo;
said Mark Haney, president of Kentucky Farm Bureau.
&ldquo;The American Farm Bureau Federation presents this honor to members of Congress who are accessible and responsive to volunteer leaders, listen to and vote in favor of our organization&rsquo;s priority issues, and keep agricultural and rural communities in mind when proposing and supporting legislation in Washington.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I am proud to accept this award on behalf of the farmers of Kentucky whom I proudly serve in the United States Senate, and I am honored to be recognized for my work in support of our farm families,&rdquo;
Senator McConnell said.
&ldquo;Kentucky farmers are vitally important to the Commonwealth&rsquo;s economy, and they work hard every day to put food on the table for American families. It&rsquo;s a privilege to represent them in the Nation&rsquo;s Capital.&rdquo;
Senator McConnell has worked hard over the years to assist Kentucky&rsquo;s farm families, including inserting language in the 2014 Farm Bill to allow hemp pilot programs to begin in Kentucky, securing a permanent increase in the death tax exemption to protect Kentucky family farms, and leading the fight to protect Kentucky&rsquo;s tobacco farmers, including securing the tobacco buyout, known as the &ldquo;McConnell Miracle.&rdquo; Senator McConnell also is the only senator to have been awarded the Golden Plow award twice outright.
