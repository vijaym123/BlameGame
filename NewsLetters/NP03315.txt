Thune: Air Force Finalizes Critical Training
Airspace Expansion
ABOVE:
The new training area will be divided into four
quadrants. Each quadrant will be further divided into two to three separate
vertical areas, which serve different purposes and will only be active
when needed. Read more about the expansion
here .
Following nearly nine years of collaboration
between Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) and the Air Force, Thune applauded the
Air Forces announcement today that it had finalized its Record of
Decision to expand the Powder River Training Complex (PRTC), a military
training airspace over South and North Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming.
The airspace expansion now awaits Federal Aviation Administration
approval.
The expanded PRTC will
enable Air Force pilots and crews to perform more realistic training
exercises, including multiple aircraft simulations, ensuring readiness
of key national defense assets. It will do so with minimal impact to
the surrounding environment and negligible disruption to civilian and
commercial airspace. No live-fire exercises will be allowed in the
PRTC.
The PRTC expansion not only
marks the largest expansion of special use airspace in Americas history
but also represents an important cost-saving initiative, one projected
to save Ellsworth Air Force Base up to $23 million per
year.
Ellsworth Air Force Base has a $350
million impact on South Dakotas economy and is the states
second-largest employer. This airspace will further ensure that Ellsworth
remains a strategically important asset to the Air
Force.
