David --
I&rsquo;m going over the final numbers before tonight&rsquo;s deadline and they&rsquo;re just not adding up.
As of 12pm, we&rsquo;re still 158 donations short of our goal. David, according to our records, you haven&rsquo;t yet made an online donation in 2014 to support Brad&rsquo;s Illinois campaign.
But it&rsquo;s not too late to get on board. In fact, it&rsquo;s the
perfect
time to say you&rsquo;re in for Brad. You can use the links below to contribute online, or call us at (847) 790-4333 to make a donation over the phone.
Just make sure you get in your support before midnight.
