Dear Friend &ndash;
The 46th district is home to two outstanding charter schools. The Orange County School of the Arts has consistently been ranked one of the top ten charter schools in the entire state of California and the El Sol Science and Arts Academy has dramatically raised its tests scores to become one of the top two performing schools in the entire city of Santa Ana.
However, not all charter schools are high-quality, and not all charter schools serve our most vulnerable student communities. Much like we hold our traditional public schools accountable for the education of our future leaders, we must also expect our charter schools to involve the community in their efforts to improve the charter school system.
That&rsquo;s why I am proud that today, the House of Representatives adopted my amendment requiring state entities to report how charter school programs encourage community involvement in the planning and opening of additional charter schools.
