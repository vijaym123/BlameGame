Friends,
I have some exciting news to share with you: I recently accepted a
position on the House Committee on Appropriations, which has oversight
on the whole range of government spending. To my knowledge, this is the
first time that Southeast Alabama has had a seat on Appropriations,
certainly in the last 50 years.
As you know, one of my top priorities in Congress is to fight wasteful
government spending and to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars. There
is no better place to influence that process and to advocate for the
people of my district than on the Appropriations Committee. It is an
honor to be selected for such a responsibility, which generally is
available only to more senior members. Congress is working in a
budget-constrained environment for the foreseeable future, and we must
make sure that every dollar spent is spent wisely.
With this move, I will no longer serve on the House Armed Services
Committee, the Agriculture Committee, or the Education and the
Workforce Committee. However, I want you to know that I am more
committed than ever to supporting our district's military, agriculture,
and educational interests. After numerous discussions with senior
colleagues in Congress and stakeholders in our area, I'm convinced
having a seat on Appropriations will afford me more - not less -
influence in the issues that matter most to Central and Southeast
Alabama.
This is positive news for Alabama's Second Congressional District, as
evidenced by the response I have received from officials and local
leaders. Here's "what they're saying about" the news:

A Special Visitor Coming to Maxwell-Gunter
On Monday, I will be hosting Vice-Chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, Mac Thornberry (R-TX), at Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base. I'm
constantly looking for opportunities to highlight the unique and
important missions at our two military installations - Maxwell-Gunter
and Fort Rucker - and that's why I invited Vice-Chairman Thornberry to
come visit the base.
>From the Air University and the 908th Airlift Wing at Maxwell, to the
Defense Information Systems and Air Force Space Command at Gunter, and
all the other units - this base adds tremendous value to the U.S. Air
Force in terms of training and strategic capability. We are so
fortunate to have this base in our region, and I am honored to help
show it off to Vice-Chairman Thornberry.

Staying in Touch
I might be changing committees, but my priorities of maintaining an
open door to my constituents, listening to your ideas and concerns, and
providing a strong voice for our local communities have not and will
not change. As always, feel free to contact my office
if we can ever be of assistance to you. I am thrilled
to tackle this new role and continue serving as your voice in
Washington.
