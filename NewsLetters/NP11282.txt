I want to start us off this week with some fantastic news coming out of
Suwanee. The city was recently recognized for its fiscal soundness and
effective leadership with a AAA bond rating by Standard and Poor's.
Positive progress like this is just one of the reasons so many people
love living in Georgia's 7th District.
With successful local
leadership like this across Gwinnett and Forsyth, you can count on me
to continue to move as much authority and control as possible out of
Washington and back to local leaders here at home.

Standing Tough Against Iran
As you know, the Obama Administration is working with our allies to
negotiate an end to Iran's nuclear ambitions. As part of that effort,
Congress certainly has a large role to play. Last week I told you how
important policy letters are, and I'm happy to tell you now that
Congress has come together on two more.

stand strong in negotiations with Iran over their nuclear ambitions.

any Iranian negotiation.
The Future is Bright at West Forsyth and Parkview
I want to thank the students and administration at West Forsyth High
School and at Parkview High School. If you doubt the commitment of our
nation's teachers, the passion of our nation's parents, or the zeal of
our nation's youth to learn and succeed, spend some time with these
young men and women and you will see why I am so optimistic about our
nation's future.

Ukraine and for freedom.

UPS and Merck Implement a New Bipartisan Law
Last week I visited a UPS-Merck facility in Suwanee that is
implementing a very important new law - the Drug Quality and Security
Act. With so many broken promises coming out of Washington, I want to
highlight this law.
The law governs our prescription drug supply chain
to ensure that ingredients going into a drug are safe and effective and
that everyone who touches the final product - from the drug
manufacturer to the drug distributor to the mailing company - is
working to ensure that the American people can be confident that the
prescription drugs they are getting at the pharmacy or in the mail are
safe.
UPS and Merck - two large employers of our neighbors here in the 7th
District- are benefiting from the streamlined partnership enabled by
this new law, a benefit that means more success and job security for
employees in our area.

While federal programs can be important, they simply can't compare to
the heart-felt work that is happening in our neighborhoods every day.
You and I know much of the most important charity takes place right in
our communities.
Every day - whether it makes the news or not - our
communities are making a difference right here at home.

The Week Ahead
*
This week the House will consider H.R. 1459, the "Ensuring
Public Involvement in the Creation of National Monuments Act."
The bill
protects private property from Federal land grabs should the government
want the land to be included in a National Monument.
*
The House is expected to consider a second proposal to address
Medicare's Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR). Referred to as the SGR patch -
sometimes called the "Doc Fix" - is scheduled to expire on March 31st,
putting Medicare beneficiaries at risk once again of losing access to
their doctors if the President can't be convinced to work with the
House in fixing this problem.
The House previously passed a fully
funded bill to repeal the SGR permanently on March 14th that you can
read about here.
