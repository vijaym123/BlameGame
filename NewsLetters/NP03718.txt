Blaine's Bulletin
As I sat down to write the annual Christmas bulletin, I decided to instead address two topics. While this time of the year is very joyous and festive from coast to coast, I will spend most of this column addressing the spending bill that Congress recently passed.
Each year, it is the job of Congress to fund the government. Earlier this year, the House passed seven appropriations bills, to fund different aspects of the government with bipartisan majorities. By the time the House finished the seventh of these bills, the Senate had not yet taken up a single one, and it became clear that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had no intention of bringing any appropriations bills to the floor prior to the election. So, it came down to the end of the 113 th
Congress to craft a spending bill to fund the government. As mentioned above, the House tried to pass individual bills through regular order, but in the end, this is the hand we were dealt.
The bill that has now passed both the House and Senate and was recently signed by the president funds all of the government through September 30, 2015 except for the Department of Homeland Security, which is only funded until late February. This means that the new Republican majority in the Senate will be able to join House Republicans in confronting the presidents executive actions on immigration in early 2015, without the threat of a government shutdown on the table. One of my top priorities heading into the 114 th
Congress will be working to block the presidents unconstitutional, emperor-like, executive order rampage.
Besides the Department of Homeland Security funding, which will expire in February, the rest of the bill had a number of significant provisions in it, which would not have been possible had Congress just decided to temporarily kick the can down the road once again through a short-term continuing resolution of current funding.
The Internal Revenue Service was slashed by $345.6 million below Fiscal Year 2014 and it cut the funding for the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) staff to 1989 levels. Also, there is no new funding for the presidents health-care law. In fact, it cuts $10 million from the Independent Payment Advisory Board. While $10 million is a great first start, next session that is one area that Congress will target to fully defund. The bill also prevents taxpayer bailout of the ACA Risk Corridor Program and maintains all existing pro-life policy and funding provisions. In addition it blocks the UN Arms Trade Treaty and prevents the EPAs attempt to regulate certain farm ponds and irrigation ditches under Waters of the United States. Another provision that is important for Missourians is it provides funding for national defense, including 15 EA-18G Growler that are built in the state.
This time of year is a time to reflect but also look ahead to what the new year will bring. In Washington, I hope it brings a more functional Congress. I am ready to get to work on reforming the tax code, a balanced budget amendment, chipping away at the presidents health-care law, and reining in the volatile regulations that are coming out of the administration on a daily basis.
I sincerely hope everyone has a few days to rest and relax with your loved ones and friends. Take a moment and enjoy the traditions or create new ones with your children and family and reenergize and get ready for the new year. Lastly, take a moment and remember the teachings that emphasize love, charity and hope
and how special it truly is this time of year.
On behalf of myself, my family, and my staff I would like to wish you a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. God Bless.
