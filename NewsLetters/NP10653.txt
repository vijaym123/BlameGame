Improving education by supporting, expanding charter schools
One of the most critical challenges we face is improving the quality of
education our students receive. The House Committee on Education and
the Workforce is dedicated to meeting that challenge. Last week I
joined with my colleagues on the Committee to pass H.R. 10, the Success
and Opportunity through Quality Charter Schools Act, which will improve
education by strengthening the charter school program and expanding
access to charter schools for special student populations, including
at-risk students, students with disabilities, and English language
learners.
I have visited charter schools around the third district, including
Coral Academy (pictured) which is a K-12 charter focusing on STEM
education. The feedback I get from these visits is that the students
are receiving a quality education that will prepare them for college or
a career. H.R. 10 calls for the replication of successful charter
schools and encourages information sharing of best educational
practices between charters and traditional public schools to build on
the successes we are seeing at schools like Coral. To learn more about

A missed opportunity to secure access to care for our seniors
The single greatest threat to Medicare and access to care for seniors
is the flawed formula - called the Sustainable Growth Rate or SGR -
that determines reimbursement rates for physicians who treat Medicare
patients. Because Congress did not properly account for the
skyrocketing costs of providing medical care when it established the
SGR in 1997, temporary patches have been required to avoid dramatic pay
cuts for doctors who treat Medicare beneficiaries. This year, the SGR
formula should have triggered a government-mandated 24 percent cut in
reimbursement rates. Cuts of that magnitude threaten access to care for
seniors who rely on Medicare because they result in doctors reducing
their Medicare practice or even dropping Medicare patients altogether.
Unfortunately, the Senate refused to act on a House-passed bill to
achieve a long-term fix and yet another short-term "doc fix" patch was
needed. I wrote an opinion piece on this topic for The Hill and you can

NEW VIDEO: Intelligence Committee hearing shines light on Benghazi
attacks
The former Deputy Director of the CIA, Michael Morell, recently came
before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence for an open
hearing to examine the attacks on American diplomatic facilities in
Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012. When I got my opportunity to ask
Mr. Morell about the attacks and their aftermath, I pressed him on
whether the talking points given to United Nations Ambassador Susan
Rice were drafted to deflect blame or provide the most accurate
information to the American people. Click the image below to watch

On April 2, my staff and I participated in Light It Up Blue day for
Autism awareness. In Nevada, I have been proud to work with the Grant A
Gift Autism Foundation which helps children with Autism and their
families by offering support services, quality-of-life programs and
training that will prepare them to live as independent adults. To learn

Improving
education
by
supporting,
expanding
charter
schools
One
of
the
most
critical
challenges
we
face
is
improving
the
quality
of
education
our
students
receive.
The
House
Committee
on
Education
and
the
Workforce
is
dedicated
to
meeting
that
challenge.
Last
week
I
joined
with
my
colleagues
on
the
Committee
to
pass
H.R.
10,
the
Success
and
Opportunity
through
Quality
Charter
Schools
Act ,
which
will
improve
education
by
strengthening
the
charter
school
program
and
expanding
access
to
charter
schools
for
special
student
populations,
including
at-risk
students,
students
with
disabilities,
and
English
language
learners.
I
have
visited
charter
schools
around
the
third
district,
including
Coral
Academy
(pictured)
which
is
a
K-12
charter
focusing
on
STEM
education.
The
feedback
I
get
from
these
visits
is
that
the
students
are
receiving
a
quality
education
that
will
prepare
them
for
college
or
a
career.
H.R.
10
calls
for
the
replication
of

and
encourages
information
sharing
of
best
educational
practices
between
charters
and

public
schools
to

the
successes
we
are
seeing
at
schools
like
Coral.

A
missed
opportunity
to
secure
access
to
care
for
our
seniors
The
single
greatest
threat
to
Medicare
and
access
to
care
for
seniors
is
the
flawed
formula
-
called
the
Sustainable
Growth
Rate
or
SGR
-
that
determines
reimbursement
rates
for
physicians
who
treat
Medicare
patients.
Because
Congress
did
not
properly
account
for
the
skyrocketing
costs
of
providing
medical
care
when
it
established
the
SGR
in
1997,
temporary
patches
have
been
required
to
avoid
dramatic
pay
cuts
for
doctors
who
treat
Medicare
beneficiaries.
This
year,
the
SGR
formula
should
have
triggered
a
government-mandated
24
percent
cut
in
reimbursement
rates.
Cuts
of
that
magnitude
threaten
access
to
care
for
seniors
who
rely
on
Medicare
because
they
result
in
doctors
reducing
their
Medicare
practice
or
even
dropping
Medicare

altogether.
