Grow it Here, Make it Here Event Showcases Biobased Manufacturing
Senator Stabenow convened a hearing of the U.S. Senate Committee on
Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry to examine how companies are taking
advantage of homegrown agriculture--instead of petroleum-to make new
products and create new jobs. The Committee recognized the value of
connecting agriculture with manufacturing when it included critical
biobased initiatives in the 2014 Farm Bill. The provisions will help
innovators leverage new resources to grow their manufacturing
businesses and create jobs by harnessing the potential of
American-grown agriculture crops. Following the hearing, Committee
members and the public were invited to see firsthand some of the
products that are helping fuel the biobased manufacturing boom. Four
Michigan companies were among the 35 who displayed products that
demonstrate the innovative work being done in biobased manufacturing.
"In Michigan we both grow things and make things.
Agriculture and
manufacturing are at the heart of our economy--they are the foundation
of the middle class," said Stabenow.

health of potential recruits-and its most recent successes. You can

Hill.
