Thank you for reading The Conaway Chronicle, a review of my activities in Congress and the 11th District.
Increasing Congressional Oversight of Trade Negotiations
Yesterday, the House passed
legislation approving
trade promotion authority , or TPA.
The bill
establishes an unprecedented level of consultation and transparency requirements, ensuring that Congress and the American people know the full impact of any trade agreement.
It also gives clear instructions for trade negotiators to follow while establishing additional consequences for failing to comply, including withdrawal of TPA.
I commend Chairman Ryan for putting together a TPA bill that paves the way for negotiating new, high-standard free trade agreements while simultaneously ensuring we hold the Administration accountable. This bill includes the strongest measures to date for ensuring that the President sticks to the negotiating objectives laid down by Congress and prevents President Obama from acting unilaterally.
Trade is incredibly important to agriculture, with exports accounting for nearly one-third of total U.S. farm income. With 95 percent of the worlds population residing outside of the United States, it is imperative that the U.S. works to expand market access while eliminating international barriers to trade. With TPA in place, our negotiators will have the credibility necessary to conclude the most effective trade agreements possible.
This measure has received widespread conservative support. Texas Senator Ted Cruz expressed his support for TPA in an opinion editorial he wrote for the Wall Street Journal,
which can be found here.
A coalition of 26 conservative activist groups, including Americans for Tax Reform, Crossroads GPS, Citizens against Government Waste, and the American Conservative Union, sent a letter of support
which can be read here . You can find these resources and more information about TPA from the
Ways and Means Committee here .
Video Tour of the U.S. Capitol Building
Construction on the U.S. Capitol Building was finished in 1800, and it has been a symbol of the American people and their government ever since. This summer, the talented interns in my D.C. office put together a video tour of the U.S. Capitol to share this incredible history with you.

The San Saba Wedding Oak Tree
Near San Saba, Texas, there is a beautiful Texas Live Oak tree that is known as the Matrimonial Oak Tree. Before settlers arrived to the area, the San Saba River bottomland was home to Native Americans. Legend says that these Native Americans would meet beneath this tree and unite in wedlock. Later, many who lived in the region would ride in a horse-and-buggy to exchange marriage vows under this tree.
If you want to visit the wedding tree today, you can drive north on N 9th Street, take a left on China Creek Road and then go about one mile until you reach the oak tree.
As always, you can follow me on

Sincerely,
Rep. Mike Conaway, 11th District
