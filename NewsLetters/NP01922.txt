Rep. Levin Calls for Funding to Restore the Great Lakes
A bipartisan group of 51 House lawmakers have joined together to urge a key House committee to provide sustained funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI).
The GLRI is a six-year-old effort to protect, restore and maintain the Great Lakes ecosystem.
The inter-agency program provides funding to address vital environmental issues in the Great Lakes, such as cleaning up contaminated sediments, reducing polluted runoff, mitigating habitat degradation and loss, and addressing invasive species such as the Asian carp.
In their letter to the House Appropriations Committee, the lawmakers called for $300 million in 2016 for GLRI.
'This
letter
shows overwhelming, bipartisan support for restoring the Great Lakes,' said Rep. Levin. 'This has to be a priority as Congress gets to work on the 2016 funding bills. Now is not the time to cut funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.

Putting the TPP on the Right Track
Rep. Levin co-wrote an
article
that appeared in Politico concerning the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership trade negotiations.
The article begins, The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a major potential trade agreement between the United States and 11 countries at very different levels of economic development, including Japan, Mexico and Vietnam. Will the agreement boost U.S. growth, address wage stagnation, help our strategic partners and create legitimate rules for international trade in the 21st century? The answer hangs in the balance.
Lawmakers Urge Protection for Monarch Butterflies
Monarch butterfly populations in eastern North America are down about 90 percent in the past 20 years. There are a number of reasons for the decline in monarch populations, but two clear threats are habitat loss
particularly the loss of milkweed plants, which are the host plant where monarchs lay their eggs
as well as increased use of pesticides along the monarchs migratory path.
Unless something changes, the monarch butterflies are in danger of extinction.
Rep. Levin recently joined over 50 other Members of the House of Representatives in writing a
letter
to President Obama to urge action to protect the monarch butterfly; in particular, they recommend protection for the monarch under the Endangered Species Act.
Sincerely,
Sander Levin
