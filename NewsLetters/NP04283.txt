Happy Thanksgiving!
Thank you for subscribing to my
e-newsletter for November 2014.
The many people in our
communities who recognize needs and find ways to meet them are what
makes Idaho such a great place to live and are among the many blessings
to be celebrated this Thanksgiving.
Idaho is filled with
extraordinary individuals who come together not only when tragedy
strikes, but also to support others around them every day.
We see this
in the way our communities galvanize time and time again in support of
local and nationwide efforts.
From caring for families struck
with illness or the loss of a loved one, to mentoring youth and
spending time with those in retirement homes, there are countless caring acts
daily all around us.
Nearly 15 years ago, I started the
Spirit of Idaho Award to recognize the many acts of service happening in
local Idaho communities that may not be recognized in other
ways.
This award was created to bring attention to these valuable
individuals, groups and projects.
The first award was presented in Twin
Falls in November of 2000.
Since the first award was given, I
have been privileged to recognize hundreds of deserving Idahoans who
have demonstrated a commitment to improving their community and serving
their fellow citizens.
Their examples of service are helping
empower others.
There is no specific
schedule for making Spirit of Idaho Awards.
They are given for service
to a community, and can be given to individuals or groups.
The
general criteria for a Spirit of Idaho Award are that the recipient
must be a resident of the state of Idaho and have set a positive example
for the community.
There is no formal application process, but
individuals who wish to bring some act to my attention are welcome to
do so by contacting the nearest
Regional Office
to share that information.
Through the Spirit of Idaho
award, I have had the honor of recognizing a quick-thinking child who saved
her brother from drowning in an abandoned well; a couple who has
helped advance species conservation; the creator of a group that assists
senior citizens with errands, heating their homes and more; a company
that coordinated the construction of a home and additional assistance
for an Idaho family in need; and students who raised funds to support
our nations service members.
These are just a few examples of
Spirit of Idaho recipients and the many acts of service in our
communities.
This Thanksgiving and every day,
there are many in our communities and our own families worthy of our
gratitude.
May we not overlook their acts of kindness and shed
deserving light on these good works.
Looking for
more information?
Please visit the
Issues and Legislation
section of my
website for information that addresses many issues important to all of
us.
As always, I highly value the opinions and concerns
of my fellow Idahoans.
With that in mind, we continue to
work to improve my website.
Please do not reply to this
e-newsletter.

Also, please let me know if there are other issues that you would
like me to address.
All the best,
