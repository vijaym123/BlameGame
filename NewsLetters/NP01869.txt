Hello,
This was a week of real accomplishments in Congress - as we passed a
Balanced Budget for a Stronger American and solved a problem
permanently, by strengthening Medicare.
Here's a look:
Common Core
This week, I visited with Ohio School Board Member Sarah Fowler to
discuss our joint efforts to stop the implementation and negative effects
of the Common Core State Standards.
Sarah has been leading the fight at home in Ohio, and we discussed
ways that I can continue to do my part at the federal level.
Last Congress,
I was one of only 12 republicans to vote
against legislation that would have implemented Common Core at the
State level .
It was a great
meeting and I'm proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with Sarah in the
fight to reign in the federal government's role in educating our
children.
Discussing our efforts to stop Common
Core.
Tell Me
Why You Deserve That Amount
This was
another busy week of hearings in Congress. I serve as the 2nd ranking
Republican member on the
Transportation, Housing and
Urban Development Subcommittee of the House Appropriations
Committee
and we had a host of officials come before our committee to justify
their budget requests. Here's a look at who I questioned this
week:
The Honorable Julian
Castro,
Secretary of Department of Housing and Urban
Development
Sarah
Feinberg,
Acting Administrator of Federal Railroad
Administration
Timothy P. Butters,
Acting
Administrator of Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration
T.F. Scott
Darling, III,
Acting Administrator of Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Administration
Here's me questioning HUD Secretary Julian Castro
about his agency's FY16 budget
request
Passing a
Budget
This week, we passed a
Balanced Budget for a Stronger America . This budget tells the government
to live within its means - just like my constituents and I do when we
figure out how much we can afford for groceries and gas each
week.
It gets the government to be honest with the
taxpayers and we need more of that, not less, in Washington.
Importantly, this budget also balances within ten years,
provides for a strong national defense, and cuts $5.5 trillion in
spending without raising any taxes.
That's an
accomplishment I am proud of.
A Real
Accomplishment
Once and for all,
Congress came together this week to find a permanent solution for a problem
that Congress has simply put a band aid fix on 17 different times, by
passing
H.R. 2, the Medicare Access and CHIP
Reauthorization ACT .
We serve in Congress to get
things done, make the tough decisions and solve our nations
problems. We did that this week in a huge way by permanently strengthening
Medicare, while saving taxpayer dollars and providing certainty for
seniors, families and the doctors that serve them.
This bill passed with wide bipartisan support and gives me hope that
there will many more of these days ahead, when I can proudly walk off
the House floor knowing that weve come together and made real
progress for our nation.
If you'd like to stay more
up to date about what's going on in Congress and how I am working for
you, I hope you'll follow me on social media where I post updates
often.
