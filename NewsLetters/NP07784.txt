Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s lawsuit is almost past the point of no return. We need all hands on deck.
463,561 Americans have already signed our petition to end Boehner&rsquo;s moronic lawsuit against President Obama. They&rsquo;re on the right side of history.
But -- we see that you&rsquo;re not on that list. YOUR NAME:

Now&rsquo;s the time to stop Boehner from using YOUR tax dollars to obstruct President Obama&rsquo;s agenda. We&rsquo;re only 36,439 names short of meeting our goal of 500,000 signatures. Will you add your name automatically to help us get there? http://dccc.org/denounce-boehners-lawsuit
