Rep. Miller on Establishment of Select Committee on Benghazi
Harrison Township, MI
&#8211; Today, U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10),
Vice Chair of the House Homeland Security Committee and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security,
issued the following statement after House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) announced his intent to create a new select committee to investigate the September 11, 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi:
&quot;On September 11, 2012, four brave Americans were murdered, including our Ambassador, in a terrorist attack on our consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Since that day, this administration has
obstructed and stonewalled every effort to expose the truth of what happened on that day and in the days after to the point that they have defied the legitimate subpoena authority of congressional committees investigating the matter.
&#8220;The checks and balances enshrined in our Constitution are vital for the maintenance of our liberty, and no administration should be able to shield itself from transparency simply because
the information would prove embarrassing or show wrongdoing. That is why I have co-sponsored the resolution calling for the creation of a select committee of the House with robust investigatory powers to investigate the Benghazi matter, so the families of
the fallen and the American people can get to the truth. I am very glad that Speaker Boehner will ask the House to create this committee, and I will support this resolution when it comes to the floor.&quot;
