Sixth District Report
Dear Friend,
It was another busy week in Washington! I was disappointed that Friday's
latest jobs report showed that there were fewer jobs created in January
than expected. This is just another reminder that it is time for
Washington to focus on real solutions that can strengthen the economy
and get people back to work.
Also this week, the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi got under way! Good
luck to all of the athletes on Team USA and especially to Dallas
Robinson
! Dallas is a native Kentuckian and graduate of Eastern
Kentucky University who is competing on the Bobsled team! We are
cheering for you, Dallas!
Question of the Week
I strongly believe that any effort to fix our deficient immigration
system must first start by securing our borders and enhancing interior
enforcement to permanently stop the flow of illegal border crossings.
Without these necessary reforms, any new immigration legislation would
be ineffective and we would soon find ourselves once again with
millions of undocumented immigrants flowing into our country with no
fear of consequences.
As part of my accessibility initiative, I would appreciate your
thoughts about this important issue:
Do you believe that we should secure the border before considering
immigration reform legislation?

Thank you for sharing your views! Please let me know more about your
thoughts on immigration reform by sending me an email or calling my

While I can't predict what the outcome of the immigration debate will
be, I can ensure you that I'm listening to your priorities at home and
sharing them with my colleagues in Washington.
Wearing Red for Women
With Frankfort Plant Board's Glenn Waldrop Friday evening.
All my life, I have been fortunate to be surrounded by strong, amazing
women. My two incredible little girls, my remarkable-in-every-way wife,
Carol, my inspiring sister, and my dedicated mother have all taught me
so much and continue to give me strength every day.
So I was especially concerned to learn that heart disease is the number
one killer of women. That is why on Friday, I wore red to support the
American Heart Association's National Wear Red Day to raise awareness
in the fight against heart disease in women.

Signature Industry Spotlight: Condemning the Environmental Protection
Agency's Overregulation of Our Coal Communities
Click here to watch this video on a mobile device
.
On Tuesday, I spoke on the House Floor about the Environmental
Protection Agency's (EPA) strangling overregulation of our nation's
economy. Just last week, we saw more evidence that Kentucky's coal
industry could be the poster child of their regulatory onslaught.
According to the Commonwealth's recently released figures, more than
7,000 coal miners in the Appalachian coalfields have received pink
slips since 2009; 2,232 of those jobs were lost last year alone, thanks
in large part to the overreach of the EPA.
Enough is enough. I encourage the President and the EPA to approach
Congress with an open, transparent program that balances environmental
protection with economic growth. It can be done if Congress has a
willing negotiator in the White House, but continuing to impose these
rules by executive proclamation unilaterally fails to benefit the
environment and it serves only to harm our constituents and our
democracy. It is time to focus on job creation and growth, and to
unleash the energy potential of the United States.

Celebrating Black History Month
Throughout the month of February, we take time to reflect on the rich
history of the African American community and the cultural, political,
social and scientific contributions made by African Americans that have
enriched our Commonwealth and nation.
This week, we highlight the legacy of Mr. Isaac Murphy, who was the
first jockey to ride three Kentucky Derby winners-Buchanan in 1884,
Riley in 1890, and Kingman in 1891. Considered "one of the greatest
race riders in American history" by the National Museum of Racing and
Hall of Fame and the Kentucky Derby website, he is also the only jockey
to have won the Kentucky Derby, the Kentucky Oaks, and the Clark
Handicap all in the same year (1884).
Murphy was born in Bourbon County, grew up in Lexington and is famed
for saying, "I believe my life will be recorded as a success, though
the reputation I enjoy was earned in the stable and saddle "

Memorial Art Garden in Lexington or click here for their website

Protecting Kentuckians' Jobs and Wages From Obamacare
Last week, two bills I cosponsored to protect Kentuckians from harmful
Obamacare provisions were passed out of the Ways and Means Committee.
H.R. 3979, the Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency
Responders Act, will ensure once and for all that our local volunteer
firefighters and EMTs will be able to continue protecting our
communities and not fall victim to the costly employer mandate. H.R.
2575, the Save American Workers Act, will help workers who are seeing
their hours cut and their paychecks reduced as a result of the employer
mandate by repealing Obamacare's provision that defines 30 hours as
full-time.
I remain committed to replacing Obamacare with reforms that will
actually lower the cost of healthcare without costing Kentuckians their
job or hours, and ending policies that jeopardize the safety of our
communities. Today's Committee action is a step towards removing these
burdensome repercussions of Obamacare and I hope these bills come to
the House floor soon.
Supporting Our Veterans
On Monday, I supported H.R. 357, the G.I. Bill Tuition Fairness Act,
which will expand education opportunities for veterans. This bill will
ensure that veterans can access the affordable higher education options
they have more than earned.
As the son of a Vietnam-era veteran and the grandson of a veteran of
World War II's Pacific theater, I was raised to respect our veterans
and their service to our nation. I remain honored and humbled to work
on behalf of our brave service men and women and encourage anyone
interested in joining the Sixth District Veterans Coalition to please
contact my office!
Kentuckians in the Capitol
I had a great discussion with Andra M. Garr-Barnes, Shayla D. Johnson
from Lexington, and Maja S. Holman about the pivotal role education
plays for the future of our children. They visited my office as part of
Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc's Annual Advocacy Day.
I had a wonderful time meeting with some of Kentucky's rural healthcare
leaders and hospital administrators. We talked about the important role
rural healthcare plays in the Sixth District, the challenges they face,
and how I can effectively advocate for them in DC.
I was glad to discuss social justice issues important to our community
with members of the Catholic Conference of Kentucky when they visited
my DC office on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, I enjoyed visiting with the Kentucky delegation to the
National Prayer Breakfast and attending the breakfast with Pastor Jeff
Fugate!
Please continue to let me know your thoughts and concerns about issues
facing our community, and I hope you will forward my weekly newsletter
to your friends, family and neighbors.

Thank you and have a great week!

Wearing
Red
for
Women
With
Frankfort
Plant
Board's Glenn
Waldrop
Friday
evening.
All
my
life,
I
have
been
fortunate
to
be
surrounded
by
strong,
amazing
women.
My
two
incredible
little
girls,
my
remarkable-in-every-way
wife,
Carol,
my
inspiring
sister,
and
my
dedicated
mother
have
all
taught
me
so
much
and
continue
to
give
me
strength
every
day.
So
I
was
especially
concerned
to
learn
that
heart
disease
is
the
number
one
killer
of
women.
That
is
why
on
Friday,
I
wore
red
to
support
the
American
Heart
Association's
National
Wear
Red
Day
to
raise
awareness
in
the
fight
against
heart
disease
in
women.

Celebrating

Throughout

we
take
time
to
reflect
on
the

history
of

African
American
community
and
the

by

to
have
won
the
Kentucky

the

and
the
Clark

all
in
the
same
year
(1884).
Murphy
was
born

up
in

is
famed
for

Protecting

From

Last
week,
two
bills
I
cosponsored
to
protect
Kentuckians
from
harmful
Obamacare
provisions
were
passed
out
of
the
Ways

H.R.

will
ensure
once
and

that
our

volunteer
firefighters
and

will
be
able
to
continue
protecting
our
communities
and
not
fall
victim
to
the
costly
employer
mandate.
H.R.
2575,
the
Save
American
Workers
Act,
will
help
workers
who
are
seeing
their
hours
cut
and
their
paychecks
reduced
as
a
result
of
the
employer
mandate
by
repealing
Obamacare's
provision
that
defines
30
hours
as
full-time.
I
remain
committed
to
replacing
Obamacare
with
reforms
that

actually
lower
the
cost
of

without
costing
Kentuckians
their
job
or
hours,
and
ending
policies
that

Today&#8217;s
Committee
action
is
a
step
towards
removing
these
burdensome
repercussions
of
Obamacare
and
I
hope
these
bills
come
to
the
House
floor
soon.
Supporting
Our

On
Monday,
I
supported
H.R.
357,
the
G.I.
Bill
Tuition
Fairness
Act,
which
will
expand
education
opportunities
for
veterans.
This
bill

a
Vietnam-era

I
was

I
had
a
wonderful

meeting
with
some
of
Kentucky's
rural
healthcare
leaders
and
hospital
administrators.
We
talked
about
the
important
role
rural
healthcare
plays
in
the
Sixth
District,
the
challenges
they
face,
and
how
I
can
effectively
advocate

I
was
glad
to
discuss
social
justice
issues
important
to
our
community
with
members
of
the
Catholic
Conference
of
Kentucky
when
they
visited
my

I
enjoyed
