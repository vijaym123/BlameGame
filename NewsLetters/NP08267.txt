Unlock America's Energy
Resources
The United States
is an energy rich nation that continues to act like an energy poor
nation. During one of our busiest travel periods of the year, it is
important to focus on policies that will drive down costs at the gas
pump.
This week, the House of
Representatives passed three bills intended to lower gas prices, create
good-paying jobs, and unlock domestic sources of energy.
We can do
that right here at home, without looking to nations overseas.
First, the
Lowering Gasoline Prices
to Fuel an America That Works Act
increases offshore oil
production by requiring the Obama Administration to move forward with new
offshore energy production in areas containing the most oil and natural
gas resources.
Second, the
North American Energy Infrastructure Act
requires that
cross-border oil pipelines be approved within 120 days unless they are found to
compromise national security interests. The delay we have seen with
the Keystone pipeline project should never happen again.
Finally, the
Domestic Prosperity and
Global Freedom Act
speeds up exports of U.S. natural gas to our
allies. Increasing natural gas exports will help boost the economy
while making us less dependent on other countries.
I was proud to support these three bills, all of
which passed the House. Right now, an overbearing government is making
energy more expensive. Whether its lowering gas prices or preventing
bigger electric bills, common sense solutions are needed to ease the
squeeze on middle class Missourians.
Sincerely,
Sam Graves
