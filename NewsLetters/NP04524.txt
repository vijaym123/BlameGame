A Message to Ohio's Veterans
Today, our nation unites to observe Veterans Daya day to commemorate and honor all the brave men and women who have valiantly answered the call of duty to serve and protect our great nation at home and abroad.
It is because of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines that the United States of America remains the land of the free and home of the brave.
On this Veterans Day, I would like to take this opportunity to share what I am doing in Washington to protect and fight for our nations veterans.
Last year, I introduced the Honor Those Who Served Act to make it easier to provide headstones for deceased veteransincluding those whose headstones have deteriorated over time and those who currently have unmarked graves.
Our veterans deserve so much better for their unwavering dedication to our country; and this legislation provides an immediate solution to this problem.
Also, another one of my top priorities remains helping veterans with Department of Veterans Affairs (V.A.) casework issues. If you, or someone you know, are having issues with the V.A. or any other federal agencies, please feel free to call my office in Hilliard at (614) 771-4968.
As we all know, our freedom is not free.
It is because of our service members that we are able to enjoy unparalleled freedoms and opportunities.
On this Veterans Day, I hope you join me in thanking and remembering all of our veterans who have gone beyond the call of duty to protect our great nation.
