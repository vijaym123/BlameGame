Senator Johnson
Presents Medals to Larue
Thompson
Sen. Johnson presented medals to Larue Thompson on June 27. Mr. Thompson
fought in World War II with the famed Merrill's Marauders in the
China-Burma-India theater of operations. When he was reassigned to the
United States, his medals were lost in the move. Sen. Johnson presented
replacement medals in a ceremony in Eau Claire just a few days after Mr.
Thompson and his wife, Rosalia, celebrated their 69th wedding
anniversary on June 24.
We thank you for your service, Mr.
Thompson.

How to
Give People
Raises
For months, President Obama and Majority Leader
Reid have insisted that raising the minimum wage is the way to give
hard-working Americans a raise. Unlike the president or members of
Congress who have never run a business, I actually have given workers
raises. Here is how you do it. Read more

Are you a Victim of the
Government?
