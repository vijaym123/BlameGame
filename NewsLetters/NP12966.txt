Celebrating the Life of Martin Luther
King, Jr.
Today we honor and
celebrate the incredible life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. A native
of Atlanta, Dr. Kings passionate defense of basic human dignity and
advocacy for equal rights forever changed a nation and the people who
are a part of it.
Nearly 50
years after his death, there is still much left to be done to strengthen
our communities all across America. We must remain committed to
educating our young people and eradicating poverty to ensure a prosperous,
secure future for our nation. Most importantly, we must live by Dr.
King's example: resolving our differences peacefully, caring for our
fellow man and fighting for the equality of opportunity for
all.
