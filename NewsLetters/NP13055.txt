Dear Friend,
Accidental poisoning is
one of the leading causes of unintentional injury and death according to
the
Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention .
Exposure to poisonous substances can happen to anyone; however,
toddlers and adolescents are
especially
susceptible .
Substances
most frequently involved
can be commonly found around any home- including prescription and
over-the-counter medicines, household cleaners, personal care products,
and cosmetics.
Alarmingly, prescription drugs have seen the
sharpest increase in exposure over
the past several
years .
Last Week, the House of
Representatives passed H.R.3527, the Poison Center Network Act.
I was proud
to vote for and cosponsor this bill.
This Act would reauthorize
the toll-free Poison Control Center hotline (1.800.222.1222), and
reauthorize funding for the countrys 56 certified poison control centers,
including Utahs, which is housed at the University of
Utah.
Americas poison control centers are staffed 24
hours a day by trained medical professionals who stand ready to provide
immediate and free over the phone assistance in the case of an
accidental poisoning.
Calling the national toll-free Poison Help line
(1.888.222.1222) will immediately connect you to your local poison
control center.
These centers save lives and
money.
Every dollar invested in the poison center system
saves $13.39
through avoided Emergency Room and doctor
visits.
Nearly
90 percent of those who call the
800 number
are treated at home
avoiding a costly, and
preventable, trip to the hospital.
However, despite
this critical service, prevention is still the best medicine.
Here are some
simple steps
that you can take to
help reduce the risk of an accidental poisoning and better protect you
and your loved ones at home:
Always follow labeled
directions on medications and household products;
Keep
medicines and cleaning products in their original containers and away from
children and food;
Properly discard unused or outdated
medications;
Talk to your child about the dangers of
potentially poisonous plants found in your area;
Discuss the
dangers of abusing medicine or household products with your
teen;
Put the Poison Control Center number (1.800.222.1222) in your
cell phone and near home phones.
If you would like more information on this matter, please visit the
Utah Poison Control Centers website .
I was proud to support this bill, and am honored to serve in
Congress on behalf of Utah families like yours.
As your
representative, I always appreciate hearing from you on current topics and
issues affecting you and our community.
Please let me know areas
you find especially interesting or where I can provide you with
additional information.
I value your ideas and look forward to hearing
from you.
Sincerely,
U.S.
Representative
4th District of
Utah
