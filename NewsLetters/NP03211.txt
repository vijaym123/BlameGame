Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thank you for your continued interest
in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
Honoring Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
On Monday, Americans celebrated Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s life. If
you're ever in Washington and have an opportunity to visit the Martin
Luther King, Jr. National Memorial it's definitely worth your time.
Inspirational messages from Dr. King's sermons and speeches are etched
into the stone of the monument. For example: "The ultimate measure of a
man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but
where he stands at times of challenge and controversy."
Overhauling and Simplifying the American Tax System
On Tuesday, I joined Senator David Perdue of Georgia in introducing
S.155, the Fair Tax Act of 2015, legislation to overhaul and simplify
the American tax system. I am pleased to now lead this effort after
cosponsoring this legislation since 2006. Our proposal, known
specifically as the "FairTax," replaces our complicated and costly tax
system with a flat national consumption tax and would eventually close
the Internal Revenue Service. The FairTax places all taxpayers on equal
footing, protects Americans from government intrusion by the IRS, and
would immediately boost economic growth by incentivizing savings and
investment - all while collecting revenue levels similar to those of
our current mess of a tax code.
The FairTax repeals federal corporate and individual income taxes,
payroll taxes, capital gains taxes, and estate and gift taxes, and
every American would be allowed to purchase goods and services tax free
up to the national poverty level. Study after study shows that by
placing all Americans on equal footing, a national consumption tax
would increasing capital spending, productivity and job growth. The
FairTax represents complete freedom for every individual, regardless of
economic status. No longer would Americans be punished for working hard
to support their families, and every taxpayer would know exactly how
much they are sending to the federal government.
Tax Reform is not an easy undertaking, but the economic need for a
leaner and fairer tax code has never been greater. By eliminating every
loophole, exemption, exception, credit and deduction, the FairTax
removes the power of Congress to manipulate taxpayers through the code,
and takes a significant step in the direction of freedom and
prosperity. The FairTax Act deserves to be debated, and given an up or
down vote. This tax reform proposal would have a positive impact on
millions of taxpayers, allowing Americans to once again be in charge of
their lives and money. Click here

Treasury Department Amends Cuban Assets Control Regulations
This week, the Treasury Department modified regulations related to
U.S.-Cuba relations. I have long fought for the ability of U.S. farmers
to sell commodities to Cuba and support the freedom of U.S. citizens to
travel there. In July 2000, my amendment to allow the sale of food,
medicine and agriculture products to Cuba passed the House with broad
support. Yet, since 2005, Treasury Department regulations have
continued to hinder trade, and essentially blocked the market from our
farmers and ranchers.
Cuba imports the vast majority of its food, including significant
amounts of wheat each year. When we don't sell our homegrown
commodities to Cuba, they buy them elsewhere. Cuba, only 90 miles from
our coast, is a natural market for our farmers and ranchers. Instead,
Cuba bought $150 million worth of wheat last year from the European
Union even though shipping costs were substantially higher. The ability
to purchase more affordable U.S. commodities should increase the
standard of living of the Cuban people and, in turn, allow them to make
greater demands on their repressive government for increased freedom
and liberty.
For me it's both a commonsense and a moral issue that we finally put
these policies and regulations behind us and chart a new course for
U.S.-Cuba relations. The Treasury Department announcement this week was
a step in the right direction. Click here

Eagle op-ed on this topic.
Startup Act Reintroduction
This week, I reintroduced the Startup Act in the U.S. Senate. This
bipartisan jobs plan would jumpstart the economy through the creation
and growth of new businesses. Research and analysis by the Ewing Marion
Kauffman Foundation out of Kansas City shows that for close to three
decades, companies less than five years old have created almost all net
new jobs in America - averaging about 3 million jobs each year. But
under our country's current policies, new business formation and the
rate of entrepreneurship have reached historic lows.
Startup Act aims to reverse these trends by reducing barriers
entrepreneurs face. Startup Act would modify the tax code to encourage
investment in new businesses, accelerate the commercialization of
university research that can lead to new ventures, and restrain the
regulatory process. The legislation also creates both Entrepreneur and
STEM Visas that would allow highly-educated entrepreneurs in the United
States to remain where their talent and new ideas can fuel economic
growth and create American jobs. I look forward to working with my
colleagues to explore these ideas and make America more competitive.

Reintroducing the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act
The invisible wounds of war plague thousands of veterans across our
country, and unfortunately some feel the only choice to deal with their
wounds is to take their own life. The average suicide rate among
veterans is a staggering 22 deaths each day. With epidemic-levels of
suicide afflicting veterans, the VA has a duty to not only provide
veterans with the best quality mental health care services, but also do
everything necessary to save their lives. The Clay Hunt Suicide
Prevention Act would improve the VA efforts in supporting veterans
battling these struggles.
I sponsored the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act this week upon
introduction in the 114th Congress. As a member of the Senate Veterans
Affairs Committee, I am confident this critical legislation will
receive consideration by the committee in the coming days. I am hopeful
that the full Senate will pass the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act
just as the House once again unanimously passed this bill on January
12, 2015. This bill would be useful in developing a VA system capable
of offering first-rate mental health care services, as well as
utilizing the expertise of outside organizations to provide support for
those struggling from their wartime experiences. It would also provide
for a new website that offers veterans information regarding available
mental healthcare services; create a pilot loan repayment program for
VA psychiatrists; and improve the exchange of training, best practices,
and other resources among the VA, Veteran Service Organizations (VSO),
and nonprofit mental health organizations to enhance collaboration of
suicide prevention efforts. Click here

Named Chairman of Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product
Safety, Insurance and Data Security
This week, I was selected to serve as Chairman of the Senate Commerce
Subcommittee for Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance and
Data Security for 114th Congress. The subcommittee oversees the
consumer protection efforts of the following federal agencies: the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission, the National Highway Traffic Safety, and the
U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. It also has jurisdiction over
insurance and sports.
The rapid growth of e-commerce, electronic data storage, and
international trade has increased the need for Congressional oversight
of agencies responsible for safeguarding consumers from harmful and
deceptive practices. I look forward to taking on the subcommittee's
expanded jurisdiction related to data security. As more sensitive
consumer and proprietary data are stored electronically, the risk and
costs of insecure data also increase. Congress and American businesses
need to be vigilant about this real threat, so the tools that make life
more convenient and efficient do not put consumers at undue risk. As
Chairman, I plan to put the subcommittee to work quickly.
Capitol Hill Lions Club Chartering Ceremony
This week, I had the privilege of joining The Capitol Hill Lions Club
for their chartering ceremony. I joined the Hill City Lions Club in
1977. As a fellow Lion, it was an honor to witness the chartering of a
new club and to meet individuals willing to make a positive difference
in the Capitol Hill community. Whether I am in Kansas or Washington,
D.C., the Lions I have met have always shown a strong commitment to
service and a desire to make the world a better place through
humanitarian efforts. Thanks to the charter's president Bill Spencer,
past-International President Al Brandel and his wife Maureen, and the
other members for their hospitality and kind words.
In 2012, I authored the Lions Clubs International Century of Service
Commemorative Coin Act, H.R. 2139. This legislation authorizes the U.S.
Treasury to mint $1 silver coins in honor of the Lions Clubs
International 100th Anniversary in 2017. The bill costs taxpayers no
money, as the sale price includes the cost of designing and issuing the
coins. Proceeds from the sale of commemorative coins will go toward
Lions' efforts to provide charitable services to the most vulnerable
people throughout the world. The bill was signed into law by the
President on October 5, 2012.
Visiting the French Embassy
This week, I visited the French Embassy in Washington, D.C., to express
my condolences for the tragic loss of life resulting from the terror
attacks in Paris last week. On behalf of the people of Kansas, I left
the note below for the citizens of France.
Donnelly College
Before my flight back to Washington this week, I stopped by Donnelly
College in Kansas City, Kansas. Donnelly is a Catholic, independent
institution committed to "serving those who would not otherwise be
served." Donnelly College is an affordable option for a diverse group
of students. The efforts of faculty and staff are focused on helping
first-generation college students achieve a bachelor's or associate
degree. Thanks to Donnelly President Monsignor Stuart Swetland for the
informative visit.

On

I
joined

of
Georgia
in
introducing
S.155,
the
Fair
Tax
Act
of
2015,
legislation
to
overhaul
and
simplify
the
American
tax
system.
I
am
pleased
to
now
lead
this
effort
after
cosponsoring
this
legislation
since
2006.
Our
proposal,
known
specifically
as
the
"FairTax,"
replaces
our
complicated
and
costly
tax
system
with
a
flat
national
consumption
tax
and
would
eventually
close
the
Internal
Revenue
Service.
The
FairTax
places
all
taxpayers
on
equal

protects
Americans
from
government
intrusion
by
the
IRS,
and
would
immediately
boost
economic
growth
by
incentivizing
savings
and

&ndash;
all
while
collecting
revenue
levels
similar
to
those
of
our
current
mess
of
a

The
FairTax
repeals
federal
corporate
and
individual
income
taxes,
payroll

capital

taxes,
and
estate
and
gift
taxes,
and
every
American
would
be
allowed
to
purchase

tax
free
up
to
the
national
poverty
level.
Study
after
study
shows
that
by
placing
all
Americans
on
equal

a
national

would
increasing
capital
spending,
productivity

The
FairTax
represents
complete
freedom
for
every
individual,
regardless

No

would
Americans
be

for
working
hard

and

how

the

to
manipulate
taxpayers
through

and
takes
a

The

Treasury
Department
Amends
Cuban
Assets
Control
Regulations
This
week,
the
Treasury
Department
modified
regulations
related
to
U.S.-Cuba
relations.
I
have
long
fought
for
the
ability
of
U.S.
farmers
to
sell
commodities
to
Cuba
and
support
the
freedom
of
U.S.
citizens
to
travel
there.
In
July
2000,
my
amendment
to
allow
the
sale
of
food,
medicine
and
agriculture
products
to
Cuba
passed
the
House
with
broad
support.
Yet,
since
2005,
Treasury
Department
regulations
have
continued
to
hinder
trade,
and
essentially
blocked
the
market
from
our
farmers
and
ranchers.
Cuba
imports
the
vast
majority
of
its
food,
including
significant
amounts
of
wheat
each
year.
When
we
don't
sell
our
homegrown
commodities
to
Cuba,
they
buy
them
elsewhere.
Cuba,
only
90
miles
from
our
coast,
is
a
natural
market
for
our
farmers
and
ranchers.
Instead,
Cuba
bought
$150
million
worth
of
wheat
last
year
from
the
European
Union
even
though
shipping
costs
were
substantially
higher.
The
ability
to
purchase
more
affordable
U.S.
commodities
should
increase
the
standard
of
living
of
the
Cuban
people
and,
in
turn,
allow
them
to
make
greater
demands
on
their
repressive
government
for
increased
freedom
and
liberty.
For
me
it's
both
a
commonsense
and
a
moral
issue
that
we
finally
put
these
policies
and
regulations
behind
us
and
chart
a
new
course
for
U.S.-Cuba
relations.
The
Treasury
Department
announcement
this
week
was
a
step
in
the
right
direction.

Startup
Act
Reintroduction
This
week,
I
reintroduced
the
Startup
Act
in
the
U.S.
Senate.
This
bipartisan
jobs
plan
would
jumpstart
the
economy
through
the
creation
and
growth
of
new
businesses.
Research
and
analysis
by
the
Ewing
Marion
Kauffman
Foundation
out
of
Kansas
City
shows
that
for
close
to
three
decades,
companies
less
than
five
years
old
have
created
almost
all
net
new
jobs
in
America
&ndash;
averaging
about
3
million
jobs
each
year.
But
under
our
country's
current
policies,
new
business
formation
and
the
rate
of
entrepreneurship
have
reached
historic
lows.
Startup
Act
aims
to
reverse
these
trends
by
reducing
barriers
entrepreneurs
face.
Startup
Act
would
modify
the
tax
code
to
encourage
investment
in
new
businesses,
accelerate
the
commercialization
of
university
research
that
can
lead
to
new
ventures,
and
restrain
the
regulatory
process.
The
legislation
also
creates
both
Entrepreneur
and
STEM
Visas
that
would
allow
highly-educated
entrepreneurs
in
the
United
States
to
remain
where
their
talent
and
new
ideas
can
fuel
economic
growth
and
create
American
jobs. I
look
forward
to
working
with
my
colleagues
to
explore
these
ideas
and
make
America
more
competitive.

Reintroducing
the
Clay
Hunt
Suicide
Prevention
Act
The
invisible
wounds
of
war
plague
thousands
of
veterans
across
our
country,
and
unfortunately
some
feel
the
only
choice
to
deal
with
their
wounds
is
to
take
their
own
life.
The
average
suicide
rate
among
veterans
is
a
staggering
22
deaths
each
day.
With
epidemic-levels
of
suicide
afflicting
veterans,
the
VA
has
a
duty
to
not
only
provide
veterans
with
the
best
quality
mental
health
care
services,
but
also
do
everything
necessary
to
save
their
lives.
The
Clay
Hunt
Suicide
Prevention
Act
would
improve
the
VA
efforts
in
supporting
veterans
battling
these
struggles.
I
sponsored
the
Clay
Hunt
Suicide
Prevention
Act
this
week
upon
introduction
in
the
114th
Congress.
As
a
member
of
the
Senate
Veterans
Affairs
Committee,
I
am
confident
this
critical
legislation
will
receive
consideration
by
the
committee
in
the
coming
days.
I
am
hopeful
that
the
full
Senate
will
pass
the
Clay
Hunt
Suicide
Prevention
Act
just
as
the
House
once
again
unanimously
passed
this
bill
on
January
12,
2015.
This
bill
would
be
useful
in
developing
a
VA
system
capable
of
offering
first-rate
mental
health
care
services,
as
well
as
utilizing
the
expertise
of
outside
organizations
to
provide
support
for
those
struggling
from
their
wartime
experiences.
It
would
also
provide
for
a
new
website
that
offers
veterans
information
regarding
available
mental
healthcare
services;
create
a
pilot
loan
repayment
program
for
VA
psychiatrists;
and
improve
the
exchange
of
training,

practices,
and
other
resources
among
the
VA,
Veteran
Service
Organizations
(VSO),
and
nonprofit
mental

of

efforts.

Named
Chairman
of
Senate
Subcommittee
on
Consumer
Protection,
Product
Safety,
Insurance
and
Data
Security
This
week,
I
was
selected
to
serve
as
Chairman
of
the
Senate
Commerce
Subcommittee
for
Consumer
Protection,
Product
Safety,
Insurance
and
Data
Security
for
114th
Congress.
The
subcommittee
oversees
the
consumer
protection
efforts
of
the
following
federal
agencies:
the
U.S.
Federal
Trade
Commission,
the
National
Highway
Traffic
Safety,
and
the
U.S.
Consumer
Product
Safety
Commission.
It
also
has
jurisdiction
over
insurance
and
sports.
The
rapid
growth
of
e-commerce,
electronic
data
storage,
and
international
trade
has
increased
the
need
for
Congressional
oversight
of
agencies
responsible
for
safeguarding
consumers
from
harmful
and
deceptive
practices.
I
look
forward
to
taking
on
the
subcommittee's
expanded
jurisdiction
related
to
data
security.
As
more
sensitive
consumer
and
proprietary
data
are
stored
electronically,
the
risk
and
costs
of
insecure
data
also
increase.
Congress
and
American
businesses
need
to
be
vigilant
about
this
real
threat,
so
the
tools
that
make
life
more
convenient
and
efficient
do
not
put
consumers
at
undue
risk.
As
Chairman,
I
plan
to
put
the

Capitol
Hill
Lions
Club
Chartering
Ceremony
This
week,
I
had
the
privilege
of
joining
The
Capitol
Hill
Lions
Club
for
their
chartering
ceremony.
I
joined
the
Hill
City
Lions
Club
in
1977.
As
a
fellow
Lion,
it
was
an
honor
to
witness
the
chartering
of
a
new
club
and
to
meet
individuals
willing
to
make
a
positive
difference
in the
Capitol
Hill
community.
Whether
I
am
in
Kansas
or
Washington,
D.C.,
the
Lions
I
have
met
have
always
shown
a
strong
commitment
to
service
and
a
desire
to
make
the
world
a
better
place
through
humanitarian
efforts.
Thanks
to
the
charter's
president
Bill
Spencer,
past-International
President
Al
Brandel
and
his
wife
Maureen,
and
the
other
members
for
their
hospitality
and
kind
words.
In
2012,
I
authored
the
Lions
Clubs
International
Century
of
Service
Commemorative
Coin
Act,
H.R.
2139.
This
legislation
authorizes
the
U.S.
Treasury
to
mint
$1
silver
coins
in
honor
of
the
Lions
Clubs
International
100th
Anniversary
in
2017.
The
bill
costs
taxpayers
no
money,
as
the
sale
price
includes
the
cost
of
designing
and
issuing
the
coins.
Proceeds
from
the
sale
of
commemorative
coins
will
go
toward
Lions'
efforts
to
provide
charitable
services
to
the
most
vulnerable
people
throughout
the
world.
The
bill
was
signed
into
law
by
the
President
on
October
5,
2012.
Visiting
the
French
Embassy
This
week,
I
visited
the
French
Embassy
in
Washington,
D.C.,
to
express
my
condolences
for
the
tragic
loss
of
life
resulting
from
the
terror
attacks
in
Paris
last
week.
On
behalf
of
the
people
of
Kansas,
I
left
the
note
below
for
the
citizens
of
France.
Donnelly
College
Before
my
flight
back
to
Washington
this
week,
I
stopped
by
Donnelly
College
in
Kansas
City,
Kansas.
Donnelly
is
a
Catholic,
independent
institution
committed
to
"serving
those
who
would
not
otherwise
be
served."
Donnelly
College
is
an
affordable
option for
a
diverse
group
of
students.
The
efforts
of
faculty
and
staff
are
focused
on
helping
first-generation
college
students
achieve
a
bachelor's
or
associate
degree.
Thanks
to
Donnelly
President
Monsignor
Stuart
Swetland
for
the
informative
visit.
