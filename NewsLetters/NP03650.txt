Taking My Oath of Office to Represent South Texas in Washington
Dear Friends,
I am looking forward to the 114th Congress and working hard for Texas Congressional District 28.
I will take the oath of office to be your representative in the United States Congress and will be sworn in on Tuesday, Jan. 6 in Washington, D.C.
If you are in Washington during Jan. 6,
please stop by my office at 2209 Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, D.C. for an Open House from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. EST.
I look forward to the opportunity to discuss some of the pressing issuing facing our nation and our families in TX28.
You can contact my office at (202) 225-1640 to assist you with the open house and tours of our U.S. Capitol.
South Texas is facing tough challenges and we need a strong voice in Washington now more than ever. I will continue to fight hard to represent you and our families in Texas.
Sincerely,
Henry Cuellar
