Do you think the President should utilize his executive authority on
issues that are unable to be decided upon by Congress?
Yes - Congress is currently too divided to pass effective legislation,
therefore the President must act whenever and wherever he can
Maybe - He should only use his executive authority when it is a matter
of national security
No - It is an overreach of his Presidential duties

I joined nearly 160 of my colleagues in Congress on Wednesday in
signing a "discharge petition" that would bring to the floor a House
vote on H.R. 15, a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform
legislative package that I cosponsored. This bill secures our borders,
provides an earned pathway to citizenship, and increases economic
opportunity for all Americans.
According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the
bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform legislation introduced by
my colleague Congressman Joe Garcia, which has 199 cosponsors, will
reduce the deficit by $900 billion over the next two decades.
Not only will immigration reform save billions of dollars, but the vast
majority of the American people support finally fixing our broken
immigration system. We must seize this opportunity to pass
comprehensive immigration reform. I look forward to voting yes on
comprehensive immigration reform this year.
LGB Made the Top 10
Way to go, Long Beach Airport (LGB). According to a recent article in
Yahoo Travel, the latest $140 million makeover of LGB made our airport
one of the top 10 airport terminals in the world (something we already
knew).
Serving three million passengers annually, many travelers through LGB
spend an average of about 20 minutes going from curb to concourse, and
only about seven minutes of that time in security lines.

Jobs for Veterans & My Visit to the Joint Forces Training Base
I spent some time at the Joint Forces Training Base (JFTB) in Los
Alamitos last week, where I met with General Keith Jones, Commanding
General 40th Infantry Division , Major General Megan Tatu, Commanding
General of the 79th Sustainment Support Center, Lt. Colonel Nathan
Range, Deputy Base Commander, Lt. Colonel Joel Armstrong, Director of
the Sunburst Youth Challenge Academy, Lt. Colonel (ret) Tom Lasser, and
several others.
During the briefing, I was able to hear from the JFTB team about the
need for jobs and challenges
facing returning veterans.
I also heard
about the programs that are assisting in that effort.
After the briefing, I was given a tour of the Office of Emergency
Services command center located at the JFTB
with Mitch Medigovich,
Assistant Secretary of Logistics Management, Governor Brown's Office of
Emergency Services, and Mona Lisa Bontty, Regional Administrator. The
Command Center is vital to the logistics involved in natural disasters,
wildfire, earthquake, and civil unrest.

Climate Action
Human-caused climate change threatens almost every aspect of human
existence. Left unchecked, the world of tomorrow will be a vastly
different world than the one we know today.

Protecting Our Nation's Water Sources
Under current law, there must be at least a 100 foot buffer between the
toxic residues resulting from mountain top mining and nearby waterways.
Unfortunately, the House voted this week on a bill that allows this
form of strip mining within the 100 foot stream buffer.
Furthermore, the bill undermines regulations adopted by states that
more stringent than federal regulations. In order to protect our
drinking water sources, I introduced two amendments to the bill. One
that reinstates the 100 foot stream buffer zone rule, and the other to
ensure that states can maintain the ability to issue more stringent
stream buffer rules.
Regrettably, my two amendments failed, and the bill passed 229 to 192.
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Awareness Week
I wanted to recognize the son of one of my staffer, who has been
afflicted with multiple sclerosis, I spoke on the floor to advocate for
all those afflicted with MS and to recognize March as Multiple
Sclerosis (MS) Awareness Month.
MS is a disabling, chronic health condition that attacks the central
nervous system, and causes vision problems, overwhelming fatigue,
difficulty with balance and coordination, and impaired mobility.

"Voice Vote"
A voice vote is a type of floor vote
where Members who support a bill
say "aye" aloud as a group, subsequently followed by opposition saying
"no." The presiding officer of the session, either the Speaker of the
House or another member of the Majority party designated to lead the
session, then decides which group was the loudest and announces the
result. Although the names of those who participate in a voice vote are
not recorded, members who do not agree with the result may request a
recorded vote.

Protecting
Our
Nation&#8217;s
Water
Sources
Under
current
law,
there
must
be
at
least
a
100
foot
buffer
between
the
toxic
residues
resulting
from
mountain
top
mining
and
nearby
waterways.
Unfortunately,
the
House
voted
this
week
on
a
bill
that
allows
this
form
of
strip
mining
within
the
100
foot
stream
buffer.
Furthermore,
the
bill
undermines

adopted

that
more

In

to

I
introduced
two

to
the

One
that
reinstates
the

rule,
and
the
other
to
