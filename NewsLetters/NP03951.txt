Dear
F riends,
I am joining forces with Clark Atlanta University as the honorary host of the 2nd Annual Local Take on Community Health Forum.
The two-day event will take place at North DeKalb Mall, 2050 Lawrenceville Highway in Decatur on Saturday and Sunday, December 13 and 14 from 12 to 4 p.m. The event will be held adjacent to the mall food court.
It will feature an &#8220;Ask The Doctor&#8221; panel sponsored by Oakhurst Medical Center and featuring a representative from the Department of Health &amp; Human Services.
Enroll America and the Center for Black Women&#8217;s Wellness Navigators will be on hand to answer your questions about the Affordable Care Act.
Children&#8217;s Healthcare of Atlanta is providing giveaways to all children who attend.
There will also be a blood drive, a bone marrow registry, programs on how to eat healthy and a host of other free health screenings, including diabetes.
For more information, call 678-641-2143.
