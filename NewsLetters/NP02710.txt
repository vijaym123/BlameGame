Dear
Friend,
This week, Republicans continued with
their political gimmicks. I co-sponsored a bill with House Democrats
to avert a February 28th shutdown of the Department of Homeland
Security and fund the agency through the end of 2015. This clean bill serves
as the alternative to Republican legislation aimed at obsturcting
President Barack Obama's efforts to reform our immigration system.
The safety of New Yorkers and the American people comes before
politics .
House Republicans must not play games with our
national security .
Republicans are also jeopardizing our
relationship with Israel.
Speaker Boehner has invited Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak on the House Floor to a Joint
Session of Congress next month.
Let me make it clear, I have always
stood by Israel.
They are one of our nation's closest friends
and most important partners . However, the Speaker's gesture
is without precedent and disrespects the authority of the President of
the United States .The Republicans know they should have consulted
President Obama about the visit, but they prefer to
disrupt
diplomatic protocol for political spectacle .
Your opinion is valuable to me. So please visit
my website at
Rangel.house.gov
for more
information, and to engage with me on
Facebook
and on
Twitter . It's always a great
honor serving you.
Best
regards,
Charles B. Rangel
