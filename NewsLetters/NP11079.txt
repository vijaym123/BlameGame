Dear Friends,
Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart and I sent a
letter to the President on March 20 and another letter with 204
bipartisan House Members on March 11 to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS) expressing concern with the latest proposed cuts to the
Medicare Advantage program.
More of our seniors are choosing
Medicare Advantage plans yet instead of increasing the quality and
affordability of healthcare for our most vulnerable, the Presidents
health care law is raising their costs and reducing their
benefits.
The President continues to break his promises about his healthcare
law
premiums are going up, you cant keep your doctor, and if you
like your plan, you cant keep it.
Already last year we saw CMS
cut Medicare Advantage by 4-6%, forcing plans to terminate thousands
of doctors, reduce benefits, and increase premiums
$360-$820/year.
Now CMS is proposing another round of cuts reportedly anywhere
from 6-8%, resulting in possible premium increases of $35-$75/month or
$420-$900/year.
Cuts to Medicare Advantage will hit Florida
and the 769,000 enrollees in Broward, Collier, Hendry, and Miami-Dade
counties, which we represent, especially hard.
52% of the
eligible seniors in those four counties have Medicare Advantage plans. In
Miami Dade County, 58% of Medicare eligible seniors were enrolled in a
Medicare Advantage plan as of February this year.
Medicare
Advantage provides our seniors with significant benefits that
traditional Medicare does not provide, including coordinated care, disease
management programs, and medical advice hotlines.
Unlike
traditional fee-for-service Medicare, Medicare Advantage plans offer
out-of-pocket maximums to protect seniors against catastrophic events and
emergencies and more than 3 in 4 seniors had a plan with a maximum of
$5,000 or less in 2013.
Many of our colleagues have proposals to
stop these harmful Medicare Advantage cuts and ensure the programs
long term viability but the President is not listening.
With
more than 38 changes to Obamacare since its enactment, its not too late
to stop the bleeding where we can and reverse these obvious
failures.
Unfortunately, while the President has admitted his mistakes
and signed 15 changes passed by Congress, too often he has ignored the
people suffering from his health care law or decided to go it alone,
changing the law 21 times unilaterally.
We urge the President
to work with Congress to correct the mistakes that are having real
impacts on the most vulnerable in our communities. When 2015 enrollment
begins, seniors can choose: less benefits or higher
costs.
Seniors deserve the return on the investment made through a lifetime of
hard work and it is our responsibility to work together so that this
critical safety net continues.
Sincerely,
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
Member of
Congress
