No Excuses for VA Hospital Mismanagement
I'm incredibly frustrated and angry about the $1.73 billion price tag for the VA hospital in Aurora. The VA's mismanagement has plagued this project since day one and the veterans and taxpayers are the ones paying the price. We now have a final cost estimate on the project. Our delegation has its work cut out for us to get the additional funding, but our veterans need and deserve this facility and I won't stop working until they get it.
Congress is currently investigating the VA&rsquo;s mismanagement of the project, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is now overseeing construction. This hospital is one of my top priorities and I will continue to monitor its progress to ensure we are someday able to provide care and service Rocky Mountain veterans need and deserve.
Big Turnout for Second Senior Resource Fair
Trivia: Get to know your 7th Congressional District
The Colorado Territory existed from February 28, 1861 until August 1, 1876 when Colorado was granted statehood. Over that period of time three different Colorado cities served as capitols. From 1861 to 1862, Colorado City was the capitol. In 1867, Denver became the capitol.
What Colorado city served as the capitol of the Colorado Territory from 1862 to 1867?

A big thank you to the 29 organizations who participated in my Senior Resource Fair in Thornton on Friday, March 13. We had more than 140 people come by to learn about the resources and services that are offered in their communities. Retirement security is critical to Coloradans. I&rsquo;ll keep working in Washington to protect Social Security, Medicare and people&rsquo;s financial future.
