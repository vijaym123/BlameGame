Dear Friend,
As I meet with small business owners
throughout Ohios 16th District, I
continue to hear about the challenges they
face as they struggle to decipher the
Affordable Care Acts overlapping
provisions. With 20,000 pages of
regulations and counting, the complex law
is an administrative burden for our small
businesses that are forced to comply with
it.
The Presidents health care law
requires employers with 50 or more
full-time employees, or full-time
equivalents, to offer health care coverage
or pay a fine. When a small business owner
calculates their Applicable Large Employer
size to determine if they are subject to
the laws employer mandate, they go
through a four step process. However, small
seasonal employers face an additional six
steps to determine whether or not they
qualify as a large employer.
For example, I heard from an Ohio
business owner who said that he cannot
afford to have someone on his staff
dedicated to human resources. Since they
have several full-time employees and also
hire 40 or more seasonal employees during
their busy season, they run the risk of
being required to perform complex
calculations to determine if they are a
large or small business.
Though the law intended to grant an
exemption for small, seasonal employers,
that intent is lost in multiple
inconsistent definitions and burdensome red
tape that has led to confusion for small
business owners. Under current law, a
seasonal worker is not necessarily a
seasonal employee.
This week, I introduced H.R. 5213, the
Simplifying Technical Aspects Regarding
Seasonality (STARS) Act. This legislation
replaces the complex seasonal worker
exemption with one definition of seasonal
employment. This simplified standard is
consistent across industries and will
reduce the administrative burden for small
businesses and help them to avoid hefty
penalties under the Presidents
health care law. Its supported by
more than 100 organizations, including the
Hotel, Restaurant &amp; Retailers
Association, American Farm Bureau
Federation, American Hotel and Lodging
Association, National Federation of
Independent Business, National Retail
Federation, Ohio Hotel &amp; Lodging
Association, Ohio Lawn Care Association,
Ohio Nursery &amp; Landscape Association,
and the Ohio Restaurant Association.
Small businesses are the backbone of our
economy, and instead of spending time and
money to comply with the Presidents
health care law, they should focus their
resources on doing what they do best:
creating jobs. I introduced the STARS Act
to reduce burdensome regulations and
provide our small businesses with the
certainty that they need to hire and
expand. I expect this important legislation
to receive broad bipartisan support and I
look forward to it moving swiftly through
the legislative process.
