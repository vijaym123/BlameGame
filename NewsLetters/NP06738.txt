Dear David,
As summer draws to a close, many of us
look forward to enjoying picnics and family gatherings over the Labor Day
weekend.
Labor Day is also the time when we recognize and pay
tribute to the hard working men and women of our country. I salute all
of the employees across the nation who have made our economic
achievements in America possible.
When Congress returns to session, I
will resume my efforts to advocate for an increase in the federal
minimum wage, an extension of the federal unemployment insurance program and
the Paycheck Fairness Act.
Millions of Americans who want to
work and receive fair pay for their efforts should also enjoy the fruits
of their labor.
Finally, I was recently interviewed by
Stephen Colbert for the Colbert Report.
His show has an installment
called "Better Know A District" that features Members of Congress and
profiles the districts they represent.
The episode highlighting
the 11th Congressional District aired this week on Comedy Central and
received positive reviews.
I enjoyed promoting our district and
fencing with Colbert. As you can imagine, the comedian made jokes
about our sports teams and the Cuyahoga River, but overall I enjoyed the
show and believe you will as well. It is my pleasure to present two
clips of the interview below and invite you to share your thoughts on
my Facebook page . May you all have
a wonderful Labor Day.
