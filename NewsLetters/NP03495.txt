ICYMI: Rep. Yoder Votes to Defund Executive Order
on Amnesty
Click here to watch Congressman Yoder's
video statement on today's important House vote on
immigration.
TRANSCRIPT: Hi, Im Congressman Kevin
Yoder.
I am truly honored to serve as your representative
in Washington again this Congress.
I
wanted to talk to you about one of my top priorities for this new
Congress, one that we acted on today in the House of Representatives:
stopping the Administrations executive order on
immigration.
America is a nation of immigrants. But we are
also a nation that respects the rule of law. I believe we can achieve a
balance that adheres to both of those core principles. But right now,
our immigration system is broken. It does not work for those trying to
come to America legally and it provides incentives for those who
break the law.
Unfortunately, in what I
believe to be a misguided attempt to fix the system, this
Administration made it worse with its unilateral action. In doing so, the
Administration has placed our Constitutional balance of power in jeopardy. That
is not something our nation can
tolerate.
The best approach to tackling the problems with our immigration
system must begin with enforcing the laws we have on the books and
securing our border. Any action we take as a federal government must
follow the division of powers set forth in our Constitution. Article 1
vests Congress with all law making responsibilities and Article 2
requires the President to take care that the laws that Congress makes are
faithfully executed.
Today, with my full
support, the House passed legislation that takes the first step
towards restoring that balance.
The bill
fully funds the border security operations at the Homeland Security,
but defunds the Presidents unilateral executive actions. It includes
other smart, conservative solutions for fixing our immigration system.
It funds the largest operational force level in border protection
history. It ensures an around-the-clock land, sea, and air surveillance of
the border. It directs the Administration to stop putting the
interests of immigrants who have come here illegally ahead of those who have
entered within our appropriate legal
framework.
I believe this is the right approach and urge my colleagues
in the Senate to swiftly pass the bill and send it to President
Obamas desk for his signature.
Thank you
for allowing me to fight for you and the people of Kansas in the US
Congress.
