Dear
Friend,
Americans are fed up with Congress, and frankly, I dont blame them.
As
your representative, I have never seen so much partisan gridlock and
political showmanship, which completely paralyzes the legislative
process.
I can recall a time
not too long ago when members of Congress on both sides of the aisle
would come together to hash out their differences, find common ground and
reach a compromise on the tough issues.
These days, however,
compromise is a four letter word.
I
have always valued compromise, and as such, I continue to plead with
my colleagues to see the merits of engaging in serious debate on
issues such as comprehensive immigration reform, tax reform, funding for
our crumbling infrastructure, ensuring equal pay for equal work and
making college more affordable.
We must tackle these issues head on in a bipartisan manner to keep
our country moving forward, and I am committed to working with anyone
and everyone to get the job done.
Thank you for your time,
