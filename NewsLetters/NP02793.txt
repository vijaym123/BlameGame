David,
As I travel around our district, I hear it again and again: Our brave veterans tell me how disappointed they are that American flags can be made overseas in countries like China.
That&rsquo;s why I am proud to lead an effort to ensure that American flags purchased with taxpayer money are made in America by American workers. Will you sign our petition to tell Congress to ensure that American flags bought with tax dollars are made in the USA?
It&rsquo;s simple: American flags shouldn&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;Made in China&rdquo; tag sewn into them -- and the federal government shouldn&rsquo;t purchase American flags not made in America.
Please join our efforts to ensure that American flags are made here at home: http://action.cheribustos.com/American-Flags
Thanks for joining me on this,
