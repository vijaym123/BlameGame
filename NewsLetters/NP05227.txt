&ldquo;More than half of the general election advertising aired by outside groups in the battle for control of Congress has come from organizations that disclose little or nothing about their donors&rdquo;

Dear Friend, Dark-money groups see this year&rsquo;s elections as a silent auction
-- no names, no transparency, just a willingness to spend big and the promise of a handsome reward.
And it&rsquo;s clear who all that dark money is backing. This is from the same Times article I quoted above: &ldquo;Republicans have relied significantly more on advertising paid for with secret money... close to 80 percent of general election advertising by outside groups aiding Republicans has been paid for with secret money, donated to groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Freedom Partners &mdash; a trade association of donors with ties to Charles G. and David H. Koch &mdash; and Crossroads GPS, founded by Karl Rove.&rdquo;
All that dark money has Republicans on the verge of taking over the Senate.
We can&rsquo;t let our democracy turn into a silent auction for anonymous billionaires. Give $5, stand up for transparency in our elections, and help us keep the Senate blue this November.

Or donate another amount.
Does anyone believe that Republicans will vote for campaign finance reform
after
they&rsquo;ve taken the Senate on a wave of dark money?
They know better than to bite the hand that feeds. And if Republicans take the Senate, we&rsquo;re looking at more gridlock, more dysfunction, and more Tea Party shutdown threats.
We have to counter the Republicans&rsquo; dark money.
Give Democrats a fighting chance at holding the Senate -- contribute $5 and help us get out the vote.
Thank you.
