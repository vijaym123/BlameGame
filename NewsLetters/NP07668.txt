IMMIGRATION TWITTER TOWN HALL: On July 15, I participated in a Twitter Town Hall focusing on the importance of comprehensive immigration reform, which was hosted by Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland. I answered questions from participants on my Twitter page
under the hashtag #AskDems. Please stay tuned for future social media town halls on both Facebook
and Twitter.
[cid:image006.jpg@01CFA754.C612B540]JUMPSTARTING THE MIDDLE CLASS: I joined with House Democrats this month to implement the 100 Day Action Plan to help the middle class. The plan will grow the middle class by creating more jobs, provide support to women and give working-class families access to more affordable and accessible education. For more information on this initiative, click HERE .
COVER PHOTO COMPETITION: Throughout August, I'm holding a Facebook
cover photo contest. To participate, submit your favorite high-quality photos taken in Georgia's Fourth District. The winner will have his/her photo as my cover page for three months. For more, click HERE .
PRISONERS NOW ELIGIBLE FOR REDUCED DRUG SENTENCES: As we begin to reform our criminal justice system, I'm encouraged that the U.S. Sentencing Commission has voted in favor of creating new federal drug sentencing guidelines , which means that over 46,000 federal drug offenders sentenced before Nov. 1, 2014 are now eligible to file a motion asking for a shorter sentence. I'm pleased that my letter to the sentencing board made a difference! To read my letter, click HERE .
[cid:image008.jpg@01CFA754.C612B540]COMMUNITY EVENTS: I enjoyed participating in Commissioner Sharon Barnes-Sutton's "2014 Youth Empowerment Breakfast" at Evergreen in Stone Mountain, where I had the chance to spend time with this year's guest speaker, Mary-Pat Hector, the National Youth Director for National Action Network. I also had the pleasure of attending the Washington Fellowship for Young African Leaders at the Allen Entrepreneur Institute in Lithonia. For more, visit my Facebook
page.
MILITARIZATION OF POLICE: Next week, I'm holding a briefing on the militarization of our police forces throughout the country. From small towns to major cities, the police are looking more and more like the military. Federal programs are helping local law enforcement obtain Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protected vehicles (MRAPs), M16s, grenade launchers, and more - often for free with no accountability. It's one of the reasons I'm considering legislation on this important issue.

Dear
F riends,
I&#8217;m pleased to announce that I am co-chair &#8211; along with my friend and colleague Rep. G.K. Butterfield (NC-01) &#8211; of the new State Medicaid Expansion Caucus.
More than 33 members of Congress joined the Caucus, which will highlight the need for recalcitrant states &#8211; such as Georgia &#8211; to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. We will continue to raise our voices through floor speeches,
op-eds, social media posts and discussions with our colleagues and constituents.
Expanding Medicaid will ensure access to health care for millions of low-income Americans, including 650,000 here in Georgia. It will bring the security of health insurance to working people with income below the poverty level. It will
also bring billions of dollars into each state&#8217;s economy as people go to work providing care and beneficiaries see improved health outcomes. The people who will benefit from expanding Medicaid are no less deserving of health care than anyone else. For more,

HERE .
