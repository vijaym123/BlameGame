MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: All Gifts TRIPLE-MATCHED
President Obama and Nancy Pelosi are asking for your help. Tonight is the final public fundraising deadline of this election.
President Obama, Nancy Pelosi, and
every Democrat in the universe
wouldn&rsquo;t have emailed you if we didn&rsquo;t need your help.
-- Boehner and his allies just launched his biggest TV ad blitz of the entire election this week --
$17,OOO,OOO.
-- It's also the FINAL public fundraising deadline of the election -- and we&rsquo;ve fallen dangerously behind!
That&rsquo;s a crushing combo of bad news.
But here&rsquo;s the good news: Yesterday at 11:43AM EDT, we received the last donation we needed to unlock the TRIPLE-MATCH!
That means all donations today will be triple-matched! David, control of Congress is at stake. Please don&rsquo;t pass up this opportunity.
TRIPLE-MATCH DEADLINE:
11:59PM
