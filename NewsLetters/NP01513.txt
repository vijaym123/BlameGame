An Important Announcement
Friday, April 10, 2015
Dear Friend,
You may have heard that earlier this week I announced my decision to retire at the end of the 114th Congress. If you haven&rsquo;t already seen my short video announcement, you can
watch it here .
I want you to know that I will continue to represent you, and all of my constituents on the Central Coast, throughout the rest of my term with the same passion and commitment I had on my first day in office.
As always, my office is here to serve you. If there is anything my staff or I can do for you, please reach out to one of my offices in San Luis Obispo, Santa Maria, Santa Barbara, or Washington, D.C. Please keep in touch with me by
sending me an email , liking my
Facebook page , or following me on
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Lois Capps
MEMBER OF CONGRESS
