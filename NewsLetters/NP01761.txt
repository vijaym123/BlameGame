Congressman Perry Announces High School Art Competition
U.S Representative Scott Perry (PA-4) is pleased to invite all high school students from Pennsylvanias 4th Congressional District to participate in the 2015 Congressional Art Competition. Initiated by Members of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982, the event is a nationwide annual art competition that allows high school students from all fifty states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories to showcase their artistic ability.
The winning piece of art from each Congressional district is displayed in an eleven month exhibit in the Cannon tunnel that leads into the U.S. Capitol. The winning artist will also receive a $3,000 renewable admission scholarship to The Savannah College of Art and Design. Additionally, the winner and a guest will be invited to attend a reception in Washington D.C., where they will be escorted on a tour of the U.S. Capitol.
2014 Congressional Arts Competition Winner, "Window Into Nature", By Malori Bloss-Senft
Judging is performed by members of the local art community. While the official guidelines require that each submitted piece of artwork be framed, the 4th Congressional Districts competition will only require that the winning entry be framed. Submissions will be accepted in Congressman Perrys Gettysburg, Wormleysburg and York County District offices through April 17, 2015.
Further information about the program, including guidelines and student release forms that are required in order to participate in the 2015 competition, can be found on Congressman Perrys website:

Sincerely,
Scott Perry
