Dear Friend,
This week, I had the honor of meeting with General Ray Odierno, the
U.S. Army Chief of Staff, during his visit to Fort Leonard Wood. It was
his first visit to Fort Leonard Wood, and gave the Fort a chance to
showcase its attributes and to demonstrate its importance to our
national security.
I am pleased that General Odierno got to visit Fort Leonard Wood's
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear School, its U.S. Army
Engineering School, and its U.S. Army Military Police School. He also
saw the Special Victims Training Unit, which specializes in sexual
assault investigations.
The fact that General Odierno visited Fort Leonard Wood should provide
Missourians with an indication of the importance the U.S. Army attaches
to this installation. He hammered this point home when he told
commanders and community leaders Fort Leonard Wood's important missions
are not going anywhere. In fact, he said their importance will be
increased as we strive to protect our country against threats and
challenges in the future. Those of us familiar with Fort Leonard Wood
are well aware of the important work being done there. But it is most
welcome to hear praise for Fort Leonard Wood coming from America's top
Army General. I am very optimistic about the future of Fort Leonard
Wood.

On a related matter, I am taking action to repeal the reductions in
military retirement pensions that were part of the Bipartisan Budget
Act of 2013. I am co-sponsoring legislation that will replace the $6
billion cut to military retiree pensions with a requirement that Social
Security numbers be provided by people claiming the child tax credit on
their income tax returns. Amazingly, this is not currently required,
allowing those who are not authorized to work in the United States from
claiming the child tax credit. The Joint Committee on Taxation reported
that this change would save $7.6 billion over 10 years, which is more
than enough to cover the $6 billion cut to military retiree pensions.
The 2013 Budget Act was a positive step as it restores $30 billion in
vital defense spending, reduces the deficit by $23 billion without
raising taxes, and brings about budget certainty for the next two
years. However, one of the ways it pays for these changes is through
decreases in the cost-of-living adjustment for military retirees under
age 62. This change violates the principle of 'Promises Made; Promises
Kept' and must be rectified before this provision takes effect in
January of 2016.
This legislative remedy will restore full retirement benefits to our
men and women in uniform. This is the least we can do to demonstrate
our support for America's troops, retirees, and veterans.
Finally, the House passed an appropriations bill that funds vital
spending priorities while at the same time reducing discretionary
spending to 2008 levels. The bill provides for the common defense and
prioritizes spending on national security, transportation, and basic
health research. In addition, it takes important steps to rein in
government spending.
This bill keeps the faith with our Armed Forces by:
Meeting the needs of our troops in the field by increasing
wartime funding by $5 billion
Providing over $100 million in construction funds for Fort
Leonard Wood and Whiteman Air Force Base, ensuring they receive the
materials they need to continue to provide for our national defense
Ensuring wounded military personnel and surviving spouses of
the fallen will receive full retirement benefits without any reductions
In addition, this bill brings common-sense reforms to other areas of
government including:
Holding the line on ObamaCare, while reducing Secretary
Sebelius' $1 billion "slush fund"
Blocking the ATF from implementing any future Fast and Furious
type activity
Decreasing funding at the IRS and cutting EPA staffing to
1989 levels
Giving Customs and Border Patrol the staffing and equipment
needed to secure our borders
Protecting Second Amendment rights, including prohibitions on
various import or export criteria related to firearms
Protecting life, such as language regarding abortion and
federal prisoners, and restrictions on using funds by Legal Services
Corporation grantees to participate in abortion-related litigation
All in all, it allows Congress to move forward with certainty for the
next two years without having to move from one crisis situation to
another. It is a step in the right direction that will give your
representatives the opportunity to focus on many of the issues of
concern and to better serve the people of our districts and the entire
country.
Have a good week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler

Dear
Friend,
This
week,
I
had
the
honor
of
meeting
with
General
Ray
Odierno,
the
U.S.
Army
Chief
of
Staff,
during
his
visit
to
Fort
Leonard
Wood.
It
was
his
first
visit
to
Fort
Leonard
Wood,
and
gave
the
Fort
a
chance
to
showcase
its
attributes
and
to
demonstrate
its
importance
to
our
national
security.
I
am
pleased
that
General
Odierno
got
to
visit
Fort
Leonard
Wood&#8217;s
Chemical,
Biological,
Radiological,
and
Nuclear
School,
its
U.S.
Army
Engineering
School,
and
its
U.S.
Army
Military
Police
School.
He
also
saw
the
Special
Victims
Training
Unit,
which
specializes
in
sexual
assault
investigations.
The
fact
that
General
Odierno
visited
Fort
Leonard
Wood
should
provide
Missourians
with
an
indication
of
the
importance
the
U.S.
Army
attaches
to
this
installation.
He
hammered
this
point
home
when
he
told
commanders
and
community
leaders
Fort
Leonard
Wood&#8217;s
important
missions
are
not
going
anywhere.
In
fact,
he
said
their
importance
will
be
increased
as
we
strive
to
protect
our
country
against
threats
and
challenges
in
the
future.
Those
of
us
familiar
with
Fort
Leonard
Wood
are
well
aware
of
the
important
work
being
done
there.
But
it
is
most
welcome
to
hear
praise
for
Fort
Leonard
Wood
coming
from
America&#8217;s
top
Army
General.
I
am
very
optimistic
about
the
future
of
Fort
Leonard
Wood.

On
a
related
matter,
I
am
taking
action
to
repeal
the
reductions
in
military
retirement
pensions
that
were
part
of
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act
of
2013.
I
am
co-sponsoring
legislation
that
will
replace
the
$6
billion
cut
to
military
retiree
pensions
with
a
requirement
that
Social
Security
numbers
be
provided
by
people
claiming
the
child
tax
credit
on
their
income
tax
returns.
Amazingly,
this
is
not
currently
required,
allowing
those
who
are
not
authorized
to
work
in
the
United
States
from
claiming
the
child
tax
credit.
The
Joint
Committee
on
Taxation
reported
that
this
change
would
save
$7.6
billion
over
10
years,
which
is
more
than
enough
to
cover
the
$6
billion
cut
to
military
retiree
pensions.
The
2013
Budget
Act
was
a
positive
step
as
it
restores
$30
billion
in
vital
defense
spending,
reduces
the
deficit
by
$23
billion
without
raising
taxes,
and
brings
about
budget
certainty
for
the
next
two
years.
However,
one
of
the
ways
it
pays
for
these
changes
is
through
decreases
in
the
cost-of-living
adjustment
for
military
retirees
under
age
62.
This
change
violates
the
principle
of
&#8216;Promises
Made;
Promises
Kept&#8217;
and
must
be
rectified
before
this
provision
takes
effect
in
January
of
2016.
This
legislative
remedy
will
restore
full
retirement
benefits
to
our
men
and
women
in
uniform.
This
is
the
least
we
can
do
to
demonstrate
our
support
for
America&#8217;s
troops,
retirees,
and
veterans.
Finally,
the
House
passed
an
appropriations
bill
that
funds
vital
spending
priorities
while
at
the
same
time
reducing
discretionary
spending
to
2008

The
bill
provides
for
the
common
defense
and
prioritizes
spending
on
national
security,
transportation,
and
basic
health
research.
In
addition,
it
takes
important
steps
to
rein
in
government
spending.
This
bill
keeps
the

with
our
Armed

by:
&#183;

the

&#183;
