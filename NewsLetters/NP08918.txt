Dear
Friends,
Today, the 70th
anniversary of D-Day, marks
one of the most courageous
days in American history. On
June 6, 1944, 160,000 troops,
including 73,000 Americans,
stormed the beaches of
Normandy to risk their lives
for the individual freedoms
of our great nation and the
rest of the world.
We sacrificed to protect
freedom in America and around
the world and we paid a dear
price for it that day and
during the rest of World War
II with the lives of the men
and women who didnt
return home safely when it
was over. My father and my
uncles served during World
War II, and I have been
touched by the tales of
sacrifices they and thousands
of patriots made while
fighting for the survival of
liberty around the world.
Three years ago, I was
fortunate enough to visit
Normandy and the Normandy
American Cemetery where some
9,000 Americans who gave
their lives in that effort
are buried. It was a
beautiful, quiet place - and
its difficult to
imagine the chaos and
destruction that happened
there now 70 years ago today,
but its critical that
we remember and honor the
heroic action that took place
on that hallowed ground.
I ask everyone to join me
and take a moment today to
pay tribute to our World War
II veterans, and do what we
can to uphold our commitment
to them - and all veterans -
as they committed to protect
our country.
As always, I welcome
hearing your views on this
issue, or any other, through
