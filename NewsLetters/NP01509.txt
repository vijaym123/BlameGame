RSVP to Congressman Veaseys 2 nd
Annual Teen Summit &amp; Job Fair
Dear Friends,
There is still time to RSVP for my
2 nd
Annual Teen Summit &amp; Job Fair
scheduled to take place on Saturday, April 18 from 8:30 AM
4:00 PM at Sam Houston High School in Arlington, Texas.
High school students are invited to this FREE event to learn about financial aid and scholarship opportunities, military academy appointments, job interview strategies, and opportunities to interview and apply for summer internships, apprenticeships, and jobs throughout the Metroplex.
I believe that investing in our youth is investing in our future. That is why I am proud to bring our annual Teen Summit to the Metroplex to bridge the opportunity gap that many students face and to provide them with the tools they need to succeed.
For more information on the Teen Summit or to RSVP for this important event, please visit
my official website
or contact Jimika Allison at 817-920-9086.
Sincerely,
Marc Veasey
Member of Congress
