Dear Friends,
As
many of us in Idaho know firsthand, poor management of our national
forests has devastated forest health and rural economies.
On
Thursday, the consequences were highlighted for a national audience at
a hearing of the Natural Resources Subcommittee on Federal Lands, of
which I am a member.
The U.S. Forest Service says 30 percent
of the nations national forests are at high risk for catastrophic
wildfire
58 million of the 193 million acres in the National Forest
System. Thats an area larger than Idaho.
Wildfires impacts
on water quality, wildlife and property are significant. Worst of all
are the lives lost: In the last 20 years, there have been 348
wildfire-related fatalities in the U.S.
Increased fire risk is no
coincidence, as the last 20 years have seen a steep drop in timber
harvests and a dangerous rise in fuel loads.
Between the
mid-1950s and mid-1990s, the harvest on national forests averaged between
10- and 12-billion-board-feet annually. During that time, an average of
3.6 million acres burned annually.
Since 1996, timber
harvest has fallen to between 1.5- and 3.3-billion-board-feet, while the
number of acres burned has nearly doubled to 6 million
acres.
I was struck by the testimony of Philip Rigdon of the Yakama Nations
Department of Natural Resources.
Tribal forests comply
with the same environmental laws, but fires on tribal lands are smaller
and less costly to fight. Rigdon said wildfires spreading from
unhealthy federal forests threaten tribal land, as well as harm hunting and
fishing across the landscape.
He also showed a photo of
tribal-managed forest adjoining Forest Service land with tribal land in far
better shape. Ive seen a similar pattern in Idaho, comparing state
lands to federal forests.
At Thursdays hearing,
Subcommittee Chairman Tom McClintock, R-Calif., noted that he speaks to Forest
Service managers frustrated by legal and administrative roadblocks to
good management. Ive heard the same thing in Idaho.
There
are solutions, starting with active management, more harvest, more
thinning and efficient salvage after fire.
Last year, the House
passed my Self-Sufficient Community Lands Act, which will allow states
to manage some federal forest land and show they can do a superior
job. Ill be reintroducing that bill this
Congress.
Americans deserve healthy forests. I will continue working with
Congressman McClintock and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop,
R-Utah, on reforms to improve management, mitigate fire risk and prudently
use our God-given natural resources.
Thank you ,
