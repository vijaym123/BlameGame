Friends,
Tomorrow I head
back to Washington for the start of our September session. Its
tough to go back to the other planet known as DC after such a great
month of meeting with constituents here in the 14th district, but the
House has a lot of work to do.
In the meantime, here are some
highlights from this past week in Northeast
Ohio:
Preserving the Great Lakes
On Thursday, I joined
local and federal officials to announce that the Ashtabula River has
been removed from the list of Great Lakes Areas of Concern. The cleanup
efforts on the Ashtabula River should serve as a model for similar
projects around the country. This success story demonstrates why we must
ensure that the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative receives the
funding it needs. I was pleased to help secure $300 million for GLRI this
year and will continue to lead bipartisan efforts to protect the Great
Lakes, our greatest economic and environmental
resource.
Honoring our Veterans
Our veterans deserve nothing less than our full support and
gratitude. As the son of a World War II veteran, one of my greatest honors
as an elected representative is being able to assist our military men
and women who stood for us and the freedoms we hold dear. It was a
pleasure to work with State Representative Marlene Anielski and
Brecksville Mayor Jerry Hruby to ensure that veteran James Swansiger received
the awards he earned through his service to our
nation.
Investing in Infrastructure
Earlier this
week, I had the opportunity to announce a finalized Federal Aviation
Administration grant of $302,094 through the U.S. Department of
Transportation (DOT) for the Northeast Ohio Regional Airport to update its
master planning documents and conduct a wildlife hazard
assessment.
Infrastructure improvements are a win-win: keeping Ohio
competitive while boosting our local economy. I was pleased to support the
Northeast Ohio Regional Airport and leaders in Ashtabula County in
their bid for this DOT grant. These funds will enhance airport safety and
allow for continued growth, which is great news for travelers and
businesses in the 14th District.
Stay
Connected
The House will address many issues in
September, including the budget, jobs and the economy, energy, healthcare and
more. We will also put more pressure on the Senate to stop stonewalling
the more than 350 House-passed bills sitting on Harry Reid's desk and
start putting American families first.
As we work on
these issues, I want to hear from you. Please be sure to connect with me
on social media and let me know what you
think.
