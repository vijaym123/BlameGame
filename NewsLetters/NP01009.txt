Passed Enzis Budget, Balanced to Boot
Dear Friends,
This week we in the U.S. House passed the first joint
House and Senate Budget Resolution
in years.
Thanks in large part to Senator Enzis hard work, this bill balances the budget in 10 years without raising taxes.
The Senate will now be able to vote on the joint budget resolution for America.
Our exploding national debt has busted past $18 trillion.
This budget, however, is a ray of hope that we can turn the federal governments spending addiction around.
Hope that we can follow the example of American families across the country who gather around their kitchen tables at night and discuss what they can and cannot afford.
I believe that we must cut spending and refocus funding to fulfill the basic requirements for the federal government and Senator Enzi and Representative Prices budget does just that by offering a roadmap to bring fiscal sanity to Washington.
Additional points on the Congressional Balanced Budget Resolution:
Creates a process to repeal Obamacare and start over with patient-centered reforms
Improves Efficiency, Effectiveness &amp; Accountability of Government
Supports a Healthier Economy and Stronger Economic Growth
Strengthens Medicare
Protects Social Security
Please
tell me your thoughts and concerns
on the budget, debt, and deficit.
