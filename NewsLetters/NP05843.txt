Dear Friend,
One issue
that is increasingly prevalent and deserves our attention is childhood
obesity. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC),
approximately
17% (or 12.7 million)
of children and
adolescents between the ages of 2-19 years are obese. Unfortunately, these
rates have almost tripled since 1980.
During the
113 th
Congress, various pieces of legislation have been introduced
with the goal of improved health among American youth. I recently
co-sponsored the
Treat and Reduce Obesity Act, H.R.
2415 , which authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS)
to allow other physicians, registered dietitians, certified diabetes
educators, and instructors trained and certified by the National
Diabetes Prevention Lifestyle Coach Training program of CDC to provide, and
be independently reimbursed for, intensive behavioral therapy for
obesity outside of the primary care setting, while reporting recommendation
and/or treatment plans for an individual to the individual's primary
care physicians or practitioner.
The
FIT
Kids Act, H.R. 2178 , which focuses on the promotion of healthy,
active lifestyles, school counseling, and parental involvement in
childrens education, was also introduced. This legislation would amend the
No Child Left Behind Act to prioritize quality physical education in
schools and help temper a main contributor to childhood obesity
the
decrease in physical activity levels of todays youth.
As
we work to fight the childhood obesity epidemic, there are a number of
federal resources that can be utilized,
including:
Dietary Guidelines for Americans
- 23 key
recommendations for the general population and 6 additional key
recommendations for specific population groups. These recommendations are
intended to help people choose an overall healthy
diet.
Physical Activity Guidelines for
Americans
Research based guidance to help Americans age 6 and older improve
their health through appropriate physical
activity.
Additional resources focused on youth and school health can be found
on the
CDCs website
as well as on
Health.gov .
If childhood obesity rates continue
on this trajectory, we may see a generation of children who are less
healthy and have a shorter life expectancy than their parents. However,
continued action and increased awareness can help our children lead
healthier lives.
I am honored to serve in Congress on behalf
of Utah families like yours. As your representative, I always
appreciate hearing from you on current topics and issues affecting you and our
community. Please
let me know
areas
you find especially interesting or where I can provide you with
additional information. I value your ideas and look forward to hearing from
you.
Sincerely,
U.S.
Representative
4th District of Utah
