Dear Friends:
As winter begins to fade and we once again welcome the spring season,
my colleagues and I have been working hard to pass important
legislation, including a budget for our nation. Early this morning, we
approved the 2016 Budget, which is a responsible plan to balance our
budget in 10 years without raising taxes. Additionally, it gives our
men and women in uniform the support they need to defend our country,
supports for our farmers and ranchers, preserves Social Security and
extends the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund to protect seniors. To
learn more, click here
.
Last week, I met with the Army Corps of Engineers' Northwestern
Division Commander John Kem - who oversees the upper Missouri River
basin and several Corps projects throughout the state - to discuss a
number of key issues. I emphasized the importance of implementing any
necessary flood protection for the spring season, maintaining the
Garrison Dam and protecting the river banks of the Missouri. I also
highlighted the need for continued water access at Lakes Sakakawea and
Oahe. Learn more about my visit with Brig. Gen. Kem by clicking here
.
Finally, I want to extend a warm congratulations to the NDSU men's
basketball team, which capped a great season by winning the Summit
League Basketball Championship
and making it to the NCAA
tournament. UND's men's hockey
team
is also doing a great job of representing our state; they are currently
ranked no. 2 in the nation. We look forward to cheering them on as they
continue their march to the Frozen Four in Boston!
Sincerely,
John Hoeven
U.S. Senator

Senate 2016 Budget
Hoeven Works in Senate to Pass 2016 Budget
Measure Includes Amendments Important for North Dakota
WASHINGTON - Senator John Hoeven joined his Senate colleagues in
passing a 2016 Senate Budget.
"The measure we approved doesn't raise taxes and still balances the
nation's budget in 10 years, which is an important step in reducing the
national debt. This budget supports stronger economic growth, enhances
energy security and supports our seniors by preserving Social Security
and extending Medicare's solvency." Click here to read Hoeven's full
statement on the 2016 Senate Budget
.
Below are amendments Hoeven offered that were included in the measure.
*	Nuclear Force Improvement Program Amendment: Ensures the budget
supports the Air Force's Nuclear Force Improvement Program (NFIP) which
includes providing special pay rates and making improvements to nuclear
mission-related equipment and facilities.
*	Nuclear-Capable Cruise Missile Amendment: Builds on the
senator's work to support the development of a nuclear-capable cruise
missile and a refurbished warhead. These missiles are the primary
nuclear weapon carried on the B-52.
*	Veterans Access to Community Care Act: Allows veterans to
access health care services in their local community if they live more
than 40 miles from a VA medical facility. Hoeven is also sponsoring
separate legislation - the Veterans Access to Extended Care Act - that
would allow veterans greater access to long term care (LTC) services in
their home communities.
*	FBI-DEA Colocation Amendment: Helps law enforcement work more
effectively together and reduce costs in fighting crime in western
North Dakota.
*	Small Business Development Centers Amendment: Supports aspiring
entrepreneurs and small businesses by providing technical assistance
through the re-authorization of Small Business Development Centers. In
2010, small businesses employed 62 percent of the private sector labor
force in North Dakota.
