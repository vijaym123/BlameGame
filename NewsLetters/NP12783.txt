Dear Fellow
Nevadan,
Over the years, I have been fortunate enough to watch our state grow
and am proud to represent a diverse constituency. Today, Asian
Americans and Pacific Islanders across Nevada celebrate the centuries old
Chinese tradition of welcoming the Lunar New Year. This year, the year
of the Wood Horse, is characterized by hard work, charisma, energy, and
a love for travel. As our state economy rebounds from the recession,
we welcome to Nevada all those who seek to embody the spirit of the
Wood Horse.
To everyone celebrating Lunar New Year, I wish
you and your family happiness, prosperity, and good
health.
Sincerely,
HARRY REID
U.S. Senator for
Nevada
