Harrison Township, MI U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10), Vice Chair of the House Homeland Security Committee and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security, issued the following statement after touring the Blue Water Bridge Plaza with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Jeh Johnson, U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow and Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske:
I want to thank Secretary Johnson and Senator Stabenow for coming today.
I first met Secretary Johnson the day he was confirmed by the Senate and then he stopped by my office in Washington for a quick visit.
While he was in my office I showed him the picture I have hanging on the wall of the Blue Water Bridge.
He was very interested and asked for a copy, we sent it the next day.
I appreciate his interest and his follow up on that interest by coming here today.
Thank you Mr. Secretary.
Over a decade ago, after the tragic attacks on 9/11, this country took the necessary measures to tighten up its security protocols along our borders, including our ports of entry and the Blue Water Bridge.
Of course, without corresponding upgrades to infrastructure, new robust screening procedures mean slower processing of commercial vehicles, more traffic, and less commerce crossing into the U.S.
Immediately recognizing the need to address the traffic backups, local, state and federal stakeholders committed to building a new customs plaza. We studied it. We planned it.
We forced out residents from 130 homes and 35 businesses. We spent millions leveling it.
We got a record of decision. We planned it again. We shrunk it. Then we studied the smaller plaza.
In 2011, in their Beyond the Border Agreement, President Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Harper reinforced the need to invest in our border infrastructure to relieve congestion and speed the movement of traffic across the border.
The agreement specifically committed the United States to customs plaza upgrades and redevelopment and singled out the Blue Water Bridge as one of four initial priorities.
Unfortunately, here in Port Huron, that commitment has not led to action, and acres of shovel-ready land still sit vacant. And for some of us here in Michigans Thumb, the traffic backups have become normal and expected and the vacant lot is becoming part of the landscape. But continuing to ignore the congestion has a very real adverse impact on our economy that is felt, not just in Port Huron and Michigan, but across the country.
The Blue Water Bridge is the second busiest border crossing on the northern tier.
It accounts for a large portion of U.S.-Canada trade worth over $700 billion annually.
Our Canadian partners recognized the potential here and expanded their plaza.
Yet despite a lot of rhetoric, our expansion is still a vacant lot.
During a time when this country is trying to rebound from a national recession, create jobs, fight high unemployment rates, cope with high energy prices and reduce the cost of goods and services, why is this plaza not a priority?
The question today is, are we committed to finishing this plaza or not?
Are we still committed to the Beyond the Border Agreement?
Before the federal government can consider any funding for the NITC plaza, they must make good on their/and the Presidents commitment to fund the BWB plaza.
We already demolished homes and businesses to accommodate it. The community supports it, and this bridge actually exists.
It is not an artists rendering or an engineers drawing.
I think the visit was important and purposeful, but actions speak louder than words.
