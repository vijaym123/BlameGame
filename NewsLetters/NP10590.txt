Rubio Addresses Constituent Concerns
About Broken, Complicated Tax Code
To mark this years Tax Day, Marco
addressed constituent concerns about our
broken tax code and pointed to its stifling
effect on the economy as proof of the need
for tax reform in
this weeks
installment of Marcos Constituent
Mailbox video series
.
In the video, Marco outlines various
disconcerting facts about the increasingly
complicated tax code and the unnecessary
burdens it places on taxpayers:
It takes 13 hours for the average
taxpayer to file their taxes, including
record keeping, planning, as well as
filling out forms.
Last year, Americans spent 6.1
billion hours and $168 billion complying
with all their tax filing
requirements.
The tax code, rules and regulations
now totals more than 73,000 pages, as
opposed to 400 pages when it was created
in 1913.
Americans will pay $3 trillion in
federal taxes and $1.5 trillion in state
and local taxes this year.
Americans must work 111 days this
year to pay their federal, state and
local taxes.
He then reads a constituent letter
from Frank in Ft. Myers
and
responds to his call for a simpler tax code
that is not used as an instrument of wealth
redistribution or social engineering.
In response,
Marco said , Tax reform is
critical. And its not just critical
to take the hassle out of our lives.
Its critical for the economic future
of our country. Our economy is stagnant.
Its not growing fast enough.
Its not creating enough jobs. And by
the way, about 40% of the jobs that it is
creating pays $16 an hour or less.
One of the things holding back
our economy is a broken tax code. We have a
tax code, for example, that punishes
companies for investing their profits back
into their businesses, to hire more people,
to give their workers raises, to expand
their operations. We have a tax code that
actually encourages our employers to take
their business overseas. Those are some of
the things we have to fix as well,
Marco continued . So I agree
with you wholeheartedly, and thats
why I hope this November well have
new leadership here in Washington that will
move on this important item.

Rubio Comments On Crisis In Ukraine,
Targeting Of Jewish Community
Marco issued the following statement
regarding the latest developments in
Ukraine:
The success of today's reported
agreement in Geneva will be determined by
Russia's willingness to immediately halt
its efforts to destabilize Ukraine.
President Putin's rhetoric earlier today
should raise concerns about how serious
Russia is about respecting Ukraine's
sovereignty or in resolving this crisis
peacefully.
I am also deeply troubled by
new reports that Jews in eastern Ukraine
are being told to register
to separatist forces. This sort of
intimidation and persecution is
unacceptable and cannot be tolerated in
the 21st century. It is important that
the international monitors from the
Organization for the Security and
Co-operation in Europe deploying to
Ukraine as part of today's agreement
examine this issue closely to ensure that
religious and ethnic minorities do not
become targets.
Despite today's agreement, we
need to maintain the pressure on Russia
because of its unlawful annexation of
Crimea and take concrete steps to
reassure our allies in Central and
Eastern Europe of our commitment to their
security. We also need to support the
Ukrainian government's efforts to bring
stability and security to all of Ukraine.
The administration's announcement today
of nonlethal assistance is a first step
in the right direction, but much more is
required.
Marco Wishes You and Your Family a
Happy Easter

IRS Warns of New Email Phishing Scheme
Falsely Claiming to be from the Taxpayer
Advocate Service
Recently the Internal Revenue Service
warned consumers to be on the lookout for a
new email phishing scam. The emails appear
to be from the IRS Taxpayer Advocate
Service and include a bogus case number.
The fake emails may include the following
message: Your reported 2013 income
is flagged for review due to a document
processing error. Your case has been
forwarded to the Taxpayer Advocate Service
for resolution assistance. To avoid delays
processing your 2013 filing contact the
Taxpayer Advocate Service for resolution
assistance. Recipients are directed
to click on links that supposedly provide
information about the "advocate" assigned
to their case or that let them "review
reported income." The links lead to web
pages that solicit personal
information.
Taxpayers who get these messages should
not respond to the email or click on the
links.
Instead, they should forward the
scam emails to the IRS at
phishing@irs.gov
. For more information, visit the IRS's
Report Phishing web page at
http://www.irs.gov/uac/Report-Phishing
or call (800)829-1040.
