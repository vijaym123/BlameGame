Friends,
My top priority is jobs and in order to get
our economy thriving and grow pay checks, Congress must work together
to solve the problems facing our nation.
Recognizing this, I
joined No Labels, an organization of more than 80 Members of
Congress both Republicans and Democrats dedicated to problem solving.
Last week, I was honored to receive the Problem Solver Seal of
Approval for my support of the groups year-long effort to create a
National Strategic Agenda, a roadmap for the country based on goals shared by
both parties.
I will continue to work hard on solutions that
grow our economy, cut government spending, and make life easier for
South Carolinian families.
Tuesday,
November 4

Welcome Home
Sgt. Tahmooressi
After a strong diplomatic
push, a Mexican judge ordered the immediate release of Marine Sgt. Andrew
Tahmooressi on Friday and he is back in the United States.
Sgt.
Tahmooressi has spent months in a Mexican jail after crossing into the
country with guns that were legal in the United States, but illegal
in Mexico.
This is welcomed news for Sgt. Tahmooressi, his
family, and both the United States and Mexico.
