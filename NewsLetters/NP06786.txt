The
Scalise Capitol Report
August 30,
2014
Nine years
later we are stronger
As I spoke at the Katrina nine
year anniversary ceremony in St. Bernard Parish yesterday, I reflected
on all of the struggles, challenges and hardship our people have been
through since the storm. What defines us is not the devastation, but
instead the strength and resilience of our people. It was inspiring to
see the young students at the ceremony, and they are proof that we have
emerged stronger and more resilient than ever. We will not stop
working until we have rebuilt a better, stronger, and smarter community
than before the storm. We remember those who lost their lives and we
remain Louisiana proud. Earlier this year, Congress passed legislation
that authorized critical flood protection projects for southeast
Louisiana. This work will bring peace of mind, assuring home and business
owners that they are no longer as vulnerable to the devastating effects of
future storms and floods.
President Obamas war on American energy
continues
This week, a
New York Times
report
exposed that the Obama Administration
will attempt to sidestep Congress and unilaterally pursue a
wide-reaching international agreement to impose a
carbon
emissions
scheme. This Administration needs to
finally abandon their radical global warming agenda that is killing jobs
and increasing costs for American families. Four years after the
Democratic controlled Congress rejected the presidents
carbon
emissions
energy tax scheme,
the White House wants to sidestep Congress and commit the United States
to a United Nations (UN) agreement which would bully countries into
adopting unachievable emissions standards. The UN cannot dictate policy
to the United States, and I will fight any attempt by President Obama
to reach an agreement with the UN that would increase costs on
families or harm our economy. This just proves that the president is prepared
to pursue his job-killing global warming agenda at any cost, which
the American people and the House of Representatives will not stand for.
I'm not sure which is more concerning, the president's continued
attempts to sidestep the Constitution and Congress, or his relentless
pursuit of radical policies which will have devastating consequences on
our economy.
Failed review of Phoenix's VA
health care system
The Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA) Office of Inspector General has released a
report
reviewing the Phoenix VA Health Care System (HCS). Among the
unacceptable findings, the report identified more than 3,500 veterans on wait
lists at Phoenix HCS. According to the report, these veterans "were
at risk of never obtaining their requested or necessary appointments.
This report confirms that reform at the VA must come from the top
down, and the buck stops with the president. Inaction and excuses are not
acceptable for our nation's military veterans. Congress stands ready
to work with President Obama to implement long-overdue, long-term
solutions that reform the broken health care system for our nations
heroes.
It is an honor to represent you in Congress. For more
