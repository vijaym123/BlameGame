Dear Friend, The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) will vote on strong protections for net neutrality
one week from today.
This is the vote we&rsquo;ve been waiting for -- and we only have one week left to show the FCC where we stand. Tell the FCC that you support net neutrality and an open Internet. Sign our petition letter and pass it along to your friends and family.
Net neutrality is about retaining America&rsquo;s competitive edge as much as it&rsquo;s about fairness and freedom of speech. A level playing field is what allowed companies like Hulu, Google, and Facebook to become household names and create good-paying jobs. American entrepreneurs can always compete and win on a level playing field. That&rsquo;s what net neutrality will give our economy, today and for years to come.
Support from people like you has gotten us to this point, and now it&rsquo;s time to finish the job. Sign our petition, stand up for net neutrality, and let&rsquo;s make sure the Internet remains free, open, and an engine for innovation.
Thank you.
