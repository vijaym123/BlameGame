Dear Friend,
A busy week across the 23rd District of Texas.
Visiting constituents.
Listening to concerns. Sharing experiences.
Here's a brief update on
some of my activities.
Martin Luther King Jr. March
On Monday, I joined over 175,000 people in San Antonio in a march
honoring Dr. King's legacy and his fight for civil rights.
Because
post offices and mail delivery are hugely important across our
district, I chose to march with a group of federal postal workers -
members of the National Letter Carriers Local 421 from San Antonio.
It
was incredibly impressive to see so many people committed to the
democratic ideal of justice for all.
Congressional Recognitions
Earlier this week, I presented Congressional certificates to two great
elementary school teachers in La Salle County who have been very
innovative in their use of technology in the classroom:
Alicia Reyna
at Ramirez-Burks Elementary in Cotulla and Eva Garcia at Encinal
Elementary in Encinal.
I met some really wonderful kids and encouraged
them to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering or math
(STEM).
Thanks to the administrators, teachers, staff, and students
for having me over.
Later, I traveled to La Pryor where I presented Congressional
certificates of recognition to the players and coaches of the La Pryor
High School football team. Being a small and tightly-knit community,
much of La Pryor was present for the presentations.
The Bulldogs
defied odds and made it all the way to the state quarterfinals this
year.
They're a young team with a lot of freshmen, sophomores, and
juniors. We should expect big things from them next year!
Jobs coming to West Texas
A new solar power plant is coming to Pecos County.
I am excited to
announce that First Solar's Barilla Solar Project will create jobs and
boost economic development for region. First Solar began constructing
plant already and is expected to be operating mid-2014.
New Team Members
We also added some new faces to our team.
Dr. Bennett Pafford is a
medical doctor who spent 22 years in the U.S. Navy, including time as a
platoon leader in the Navy Seals.
He joins our DC office as a
legislative fellow for the spring and summer.
Bennett will work on
health care issues including access, quality, and affordability.
He
will also be our point person on both rural and veterans health care
issues.
Cynthia Martinez joins Winter Garden office.
She will be based in
Eagle Pass (home of Pete Gallego Elementary School) and will be
responsible for nine counties in South Texas. Cynthia, an Eagle Pass
native, can be reached at (830) 752-1864 or
Cynthia.Martinez@mail.house.gov.
In West Texas, Valentine native Julie Morton (my second staff member
from Valentine, population 217) will be based in Alpine and be
responsible for 11 West Texas counties. She can be reached at (432)
386-3696 or Julie.Morton@mail.house.gov.
Please call on them whenever the need arises and congratulate them on
joining our team.
A lot of work is in store for them!

Lastly, thanks for letting me be your congressman.
If I can help you
with a federal agency or issue, please call on any of our offices.

I've never been a big
fan of politics, so doing things that help people is my favorite part
of the job.
Please put us to work for you.
