Good legislation can make a big difference in communities across our
state. An example of just that kind of legislation is something I
helped author more than a decade ago and am fighting to reauthorize.
It's called the Second Chance Act.
It gives people a second chance to become productive citizens. It
addresses a problem that can be summed up in a few statistics: 95
percent of people who are in jail or prison will be released one day,
and two-thirds of those ex-offenders end up back in jail within three
years, causing more crimes in our communities and huge costs to
taxpayers.
The good programs supported by Second Chance are working to change that
by giving ex-offenders the opportunity to turn their lives around
through successful drug recovery programs, job training and mental
health treatment, among other things. It basically takes a small part
of the money spent locking people up and puts it towards helping people
overcome their past and start anew. Since its enactment, the Second
Chance Act has supported dozens of local and state agencies,
nonprofits, and community and faith-based organizations in Ohio that
are working to help transition inmates back into their communities with
the support they need to break the grip of addiction, get real world
work experience, and stay out of prison.
In the past ten years in Ohio, we've seen the rate of
recidivism drop by 11 percent. That means a saving of millions of
dollars to taxpayers. But it also represents untold numbers of moms and
dads who are now in their kids' lives, untold numbers of new crimes
that are never committed, stronger families, and safer communities.
But as impressive as they are, the statistics only tell part of the
story. Far more impressive are the people I've met who've turned their
lives around.
Last week, I visited Columbus Castings, the largest single-site steel
foundry in North America and one of the city's oldest manufacturing
employers. The company hires ex-offenders by working with local
non-profits, like Alvis House, which receives Second Chance funds. I
had the chance to visit with a few of the workers who are ex-offenders
and have benefitted from the program. One man told me he grew up in a
tough neighborhood in a single-parent household and made mistakes early
on, finding himself in and out of prison for ten years. He didn't have
much hope for anything else in his life. Then he went to Alvis House,
and they helped him get the job training and other help he needed. Now
he has a good job, owns his own home, and is married with a wife and
kids. I met another guy who first went to prison when he was just
16-years-old. Alvis House helped him learn the skills he needed to
become a welder. Now he has custody of his son for the first time. He
now wants to go back to school so that he can attain the qualifications
he needs to help others overcome their past.
And that's the whole point of Second Chance. A life shouldn't be
defined only by the mistakes we make, but by how we learn from them and
how we fix them. We shouldn't be judged by how many times we fall down,
but by how many times we get up and what we do with our God-given
abilities.
Around the Senate & Buckeye State
The United States has fallen to 41st in the world in "Dealing with
Construction Permits," according to a key World Bank metric measuring
how easy it is to actually build something. A lot of this is because of
the growth of federal rules and regulations. Recently, I introduced the
bipartisan Federal Permitting Improvement Act
to streamline
this process and add accountability to greenlight more building
projects. This is a bill that's about helping workers, creating more
opportunity, and improving wages, meaning not only more jobs, but
better jobs. Joining me at the press conference introducing my bill was
my co-sponsor, Senator Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) and the AFL-CIO North
America's Building Trades Unions and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. I'm
proud to be part of this unusual coalition to promote more and better
jobs.
Jane and I visited Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center to
highlight my introduction of the bipartisan Advancing Care for
Exceptional Kids Act of 2015 (ACE Kids Act)
The ACE Kids Act would improve care coordination, quality measures,
and cost containment for children in Medicaid who need specialized care
and often have to cross state lines to get it. This bill would allow
for the creation of nationally designated networks in Medicaid, making
it easier for children with medical complexity to get needed care.

I joined Ohioans with the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America to
discuss our shared goal of fighting drug abuse and helping people get
their lives back. Some of these young Ohioans are part of the anti-drug
coalition I founded about 20 years ago in Southwest Ohio.
I took to the Senate floor
this week to stress the need for American leadership
in the face of a dangerous world and the challenges posed to the
international order by radical Islamic terrorism, Russian aggression in
Ukraine, and an Iranian regime seeking nuclear capabilities and
threatening Israel.

Good
legislation
can
make
a big
difference
in
communities
across
our
state.
An
example
of
just
that
kind
of
legislation
is
something
I
helped
author
more

and
am
fighting
to

It's
called
the
Second

Act.
It
gives
people
a
second

to
become
productive
citizens.
It
addresses
a
problem
that
can
be
summed
up
in
a
few statistics:
95
percent
of
people
who
are
in
jail
or

will
be
released
one

two-thirds
of
those
ex-offenders
end
up
back
in
jail
within
three
years,
causing
more
crimes
in
our
communities
and
huge
costs

The
good
programs
supported
by
Second
Chance
are
working
to
change
that
by
giving
ex-offenders
the
opportunity
to
turn
their
lives
around
through
successful

job

and
mental

among
other
things.
It

and

In
th e
past
ten

in
Ohio,
we&#8217;ve
seen
the
rate
of
recidivism
drop
by
11

That

But
it
also
represents
untold

untold

But
as
impressive
as
they
are,
the

only
tell

of
the

Far
more
impressive
are
the
people
I&#8217;ve
met
who&#8217;ve
turned
their
lives
around.
Last
week,
I
visited
Columbus
Castings,
the
largest
single-site
steel
foundry
in
North
America
and
one
of
the
city&#8217;s
oldest
manufacturing
employers.
The
company
hires
ex-offenders
by
working
with
local
non-profits,
like
Alvis
House,
which
receives
Second
Chance
funds.
I
had
the
chance
to
visit
with
a
few
of
the
workers
who
are
ex-offenders
and
have
benefitted
from
the
program.
One
man
told
me
he
grew
up
in
a
tough neighborhood
in
a
single-parent
household
and
made
mistakes
early
on,
finding
himself
in
and
out
of
prison
for
ten
years.
He
didn&#8217;t
have
much
hope
for
anything
else
in
his
life.
Then
he
went
to
Alvis
House,
and
they
helped
him
get
the
job training
and
other
help he
needed.
Now
he
has
a
good
job,
owns
his
own
home, and
is
married
with
a
wife
and
kids.
I
met
another
guy
who
first
went
to
prison
when
he
was
just
16-years-old.
Alvis
House
helped
him
learn
the
skills
he
needed
to
become
a
welder.
Now
he
has
custody
of
his
son
for
the
first
time.
He
now wants
to
go
back
to
school
so
that
he
can
attain
the
qualifications
he
needs
to
help
others
overcome
their
past.
And
that&#8217;s
the
whole
point
of
Second
Chance.
A
life
shouldn&#8217;t
be
defined
only
by
the
mistakes
we
make,
but
by
how
we
learn
from
them
and
how
we
fix
them.
We
shouldn&#8217;t
be
judged
by
how
many
times
we
fall
down,
but
by
how
many
times
we
get
up
and
what
we
do
with
our
God-given
abilities.
