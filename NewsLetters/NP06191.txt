District
Holding Obama
Accountable
On Thursday, the
House passed the
American Energy Solutions for Lower
Costs Act .
This bill included my Energy Consumers Relief Act,
which would impose transparency on the EPA when it enacts
energy-related rules with an economic impact over $1 billion.
Rolling
back the Presidents EPA regulations is one way to help businesses
create jobs.
The Energy Consumers Relief Act will help us do
that.
Strengthening our
Coast
As part of the same energy
bill, my amendment to increase funds for coastal restoration also
passed.
This amendment, which has now passed the House for the third
time, would increase Louisianas amount of money from offshore revenues
under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act from $500 million to $1
billion annually.
This money would go toward restoring our
coast.
Increasing our share of revenue for coastal restoration
projects is important for South Louisiana.
I will continue to
advocate for families and businesses on our
coast.
Building Keystone
Finally,
it has now been six years
since the application
for building the Keystone pipeline was submitted.
Building
Keystone would create thousands of direct and indirect jobs for
American workers.
The House passed legislation to expedite the
construction of Keystone, and it awaits a vote in the Senate.
I will
push the Senate to hold that vote.
