Dear Fellow Nevadan,
Across Nevada, public
lands are a valuable part of our community. From Red Rock Canyon, Lake
Mead, and Mount Charleston in the south, to the Truckee River, the East
Humboldt Range, and the Pine Forest Range in the north, we are lucky to
have so many beautiful areas to enjoy in our state. On Saturday,
September 27, Nevadans across the state will celebrate the 20th annual
National Public Lands Day by volunteering time and energy to improve and
restore one of Americas most valuable assets, our public
lands.
When National Public Lands Day started in 1994, there were only
700 volunteers working in just a handful of areas. Last year, nearly
175,000 volunteers worked at more than 2,200 locations to protect
public land for the enjoyment of future generations. This year, with
numerous state and federal agencies participating, even more volunteers are
expected to participate. Together, you are all part of a community of
volunteers in Nevada and around the nation who are working to conserve
and protect our public lands.
Thank you all for
participating in this months festivities, and I encourage you to continue your
tradition of volunteerism on our lands and in our communities. You can
find a list of volunteering opportunities to help protect Nevadas
public lands
here . I also thank the Bureau of Land
Management, the Forest Service, the National Parks Service, the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the
Bureau of Reclamation, the Department of Defense, and the National Invasive
Species Council for everything they do to promote this important
event.
