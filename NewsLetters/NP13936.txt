Message from Mark
Things in Washington have slowed a bit since October, but in many ways
this is but the calm before the storm - so there is no shortage of
information on which to update you and accordingly I offer a few
thoughts.
The Affordable Care Act has been making headlines, but it seems to me
to be a part of a much bigger budget drama in Washington, which is
worth delving into before I offer thoughts on the recent news.
First, I may have beaten the budget battle to death over the last month
with a number of newsletters about the shutdown (which you can read
here
), but this issue isn't in the rear
view mirror yet. The next deadline for agreement in Washington on the
budget is December 13th; Paul Ryan from the House and Patty Murray from
the Senate have been charged with coming to a deal on this front and at
this point progress seems slow. We will see what comes next, however
regardless of what they do or don't produce, January and February will
see significant deadlines on the Continuing Resolution and the debt
ceiling.
The tug of war on any budget solution will involve two major issues.
First is dealing with the driver of the national debt, entitlement
spending, and at this point there seems to be little appetite to
address this elephant in the budget room. Which leaves a second
elephant, the sequester. As you may recall during my race this spring,
folks in Washington exchanged raising the debt ceiling for a cap in
non-entitlement spending. It's not the big part of the budget, but
important just the same given that it capped some kind of spending in
Washington. This is a big deal as real caps in Washington spending come
along about as often as the probability of your neighbor getting struck
by lightning or you dying of a spider bite tonight. It just doesn't
happen a lot. I think many conservatives, "the right," would like to
bust the budget caps imposed by the sequester because of their impact
on military spending. Many liberals, "the left," would like to do the
same for the way this type of spending funds many interests important
to their political coalition. So I suspect if there is any sort of deal
between Ryan and Murray it will lie in raising spending now (the caps
on domestic discretionary) in exchange for future cuts in entitlement
spending. I will be appropriately open minded, but suspicious, of any
such deal because that is the way of Washington - increase spending now
in exchange for illusory cuts in the future.
Though the message never got through, and was certainly drowned by the
back and forth on fund vs. don't fund the Affordable Care Act, the
reason I think there was legitimacy to Republicans awkward attempts to
draw a line in the sand on spending is because the government shutdown
fireworks are so theatrical when measured against the reality of our
spending problem. We have a profound spending addiction, and if not
dealt with all of us will see even more profound consequences in terms
of the value of the dollar, future inflation and our way of life. James
Hamilton of the University of California made news in August by arguing
that the real national debt was actually $70 trillion. Lawrence
Kotlicoff from Boston University has long argued the national debt is
actually over $200 trillion. David Walker, former Comptroller of the
United States, has argued a number between the two. Regardless of where
you end up, all these numbers are far above the $17 trillion everyone
now talks about in Washington, and they beg the larger need for action.
These numbers are relevant particularly in the current debate on the
deficit, where the President and others have argued that deficits are
coming down. It means that real deficits are closer to $5 to $7
trillion a year and growing.
Washington's inability thus far to react to these numbers remains
unsettling because even in the recent debt ceiling increase the debt
limit was actually suspended, rather than raised, and since the October
deal the debt has jumped by more than $300 billion! I won't belabor my
opposition to this method of handling the debt ceiling, but I say all
this to remind you that February 7th is approaching quickly and without
a budget deal that addresses the long term drivers of our debt, I am
concerned Congress will give the President another blank check to
further raise the debt limit.
Going back to the news of the day - it's obviously centered on the
problems associated with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.
To state the obvious, it's been a disaster, and in its wake I think
several things stand out.
One, the so called "Obamacare disaster" may change the tenor of the
debt and Continuing Resolution debates in January and February. In
politics, the quickest way of changing the debate lies indeed in
changing the discussion. Harry Reid and the President are likely to
want to deflect from the Affordable Care Act debate by instead moving
to a new discussion on these two issues. Politically it would make
sense, so I would not be surprised to see new wrinkles on those
upcoming budget related debates.
Two, people like choice. Though we have come a long way from a market
based economy over the last 50 years...still ingrained in the American
way is the notion of an individual's choice superseding government's
choice on something so personal as heath care. The administration
seemed to have underestimated this reality.
Three, given the ways in which young people have not enrolled, as could
have easily been anticipated, the costs on this new entitlement are
going to sky rocket. This means particularly bad things for a country
already struggling with too much debt.
Finally, once again words matter in politics. The President has said
since the beginning that those who wanted to keep their insurance would
be able to under the new law (you can even check it out here
). It has proven and will continue
to be a real problem given the degree to which so many are now unhappy
with their new plan. As I am sure you know, even President Clinton came
out saying that this shouldn't be so, and that the President should
honor his original promise to let individuals keep their plans if they
like them. To make matters worse, we now know that the White House knew
that many Americans purchasing individual insurance would be unable to
keep their plan, but decided to keep it a secret. As reported in the
Wall Street Journal, White House aides knew they had a problem, but
decided to stick with the promise that everyone could keep their plan
because they didn't want to "clutter the president's message." The
President has come in with a new delay, but again all this begs the
larger Constitutional question of whether or not the executive branch
has the right to unilaterally change law. So we have a serious mess
brewing on this one in Washington.
In 12 short years, if Congress continues to avoid cutting our deficit
and making real reforms to spending, our debt problems will reach a
point where we can afford nothing but interest on our debt and funding
entitlement programs and each day we approach the financial point of no
return. All this makes efforts here in Washington that much more
important and accordingly I am really humbled by the chance to try and
make a difference in this vital debate.
The next few months will be a crucial time in getting us on a
sustainable path and I am sure there will be plenty of fireworks along
the way.
I'd love to hear more of your thoughts on the financial
problems confronting our nation or your personal experiences with the
Affordable Care Act - you can do so by clicking here

RECENT LEGISLATION
The National Security Agency
As new and additional revelations regarding the scope of the NSA's
activities continue, Rep. Sanford introduced H.R.
3436: The NSA
Inspector General Act of 2013, in order to provide a more independent
IG office to ensure oversight of the agency's activities is occurring.
Rep. Sanford gave the following statement explaining why he introduced
the legislation:
"Right now, the IG is appointed by the Director of the NSA, which curbs
their oversight effectiveness because the Director can remove them. It's
a real simple concept, if someone's ability to make the mortgage is
determined by the person they are charged with evaluating, their
assessments will be less than totally independent because their
finances certainly are not independent of their bosses decisions. As
recently noted in an op-ed
by the former IG of the CIA, Britt Snider, this lack of
independence creates an environment where employees of the IG's office
worry about their careers if their findings and conclusions are
critical of the agency."
"There are a number of reforms that need to be made at the NSA to
ensure the Agency is not violating the privacy of Americans, but
without a robust IG office, these reforms will lack the teeth they need
to be enforced. In this vein, I feel this legislation is a reasonable
and necessary step that will help bring positive change to the Agency."
More information on this bill can be found here
.
Flood Insurance
Many in the Lowcountry are seeing the cost of their insurance increase
as the Biggert-Waters legislation reforming flood insurance goes into
effect. Rep. Sanford has signed on as a cosponsor to H.R. 3370, the
Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act, in order to enact a delay
until the affordability of these reforms is considered. Rep. Sanford
explained his support for the bill by saying:
"I decided to co-sponsor the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability
Act because the Biggert-Waters legislation that passed last year, while
well intended, is flawed. I wasn't there during its passage, but in
this case you have a bill that puts the cart before the horse. It
allows government to set new premiums now and charge more without
disclosure of how they are deriving their new rates. As a conservative
it seems reasonable to say why and how, when government just says 'trust
me,' and the degree to which the original bill is flawed is highlighted
by the fact that even Maxine Waters, who authored the Biggert-Waters
bill, has now cosponsored this bill that amends her bill."
"A 'time-out' and delaying implementation of Biggert-Waters accordingly
makes sense to me. Change will come in time to all these programs, but
it should be done in a business-like manner that allows markets and
people the ability to respond and plan in a way that the current bill
does not."
Investigating Benghazi
Recently Rep. Sanford signed on as a cosponsor to H.R. 36, which
creates a select committee to investigate last year's attack on the
U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya which resulted in the deaths of U.S.
Ambassador Chris Stevens and three of his staff. Rep. Sanford released
the following statement regarding his decision to cosponsor it:
"The question now is whether or not a breakdown in the chain of command
occurred, or if the decision was made not to intervene, which would be
even more alarming. While we cannot change what happened, we can learn
from it and I believe the families of slain American personnel, as well
as the American people, deserve to know what occurred."
RECENT VOTES
Below are a few notes on recent votes Rep. Sanford has taken:
HR 2189:
Rep. Sanford voted against H.R. 2189, which came before the House on
Tuesday, October 29, and passed 404-1 saying, "I don't want it to be
misinterpreted that I don't think things should not be done to improve
the quality of care for those who have faithfully served our nation,
but as the only former Governor in the Congress, I think I have a
valuable and unique perspective on the importance of doing so in a way
that does not undermine prerogatives that have rested with states for
the last 200 years."
The Congressman released the following statement on the bill:
"The bill at first brush looked good because it creates a committee to
address the backlog of disability claims at the VA, but I wound up
being the dissenting vote against it for reasons I'll offer in just a
moment. Before doing so let me say that taking care of our veterans is
something that's deeply important to me - the federal government made a
commitment to them when they commissioned or enlisted, and it's
disgraceful that over 900,000 veterans are still waiting for timely
care and attention to their benefits applications. I've voted several
times in the few months I have been in Congress for measures to reduce
this backlog, and while this task force would have been another
positive step forward, one provision of this bill violated 10th
Amendment states' rights, and that is ultimately why I cast my vote
against it - and that I'd like to address.
"In order to speed up the process of evaluating medical claims, this
bill will allow doctors contracted by the VA to travel across state
borders and perform medical exams in any state, as long as they are
licensed in one state. There's no doubt that we need more physicians
performing exams to determine if a veteran is eligible for disability
benefits, but the problem here lies with how we license doctors in this
country. We've established a system where each state sets their own
licensing standards for physicians practicing within their state -
South Carolina might have very different requirements of their
physicians than California, and so on. Allowing a physician to practice
in any state, even if it is for the good purpose of helping our
veterans, would trample on the ability of states to determine who is
eligible to practice within their own boundaries. Unfortunately doing
so breaks the concept of federalism the founding fathers believed was
so important to maintaining liberty because their premise was that
power was to be divided in as many ways as possible. At the federal
level horizontally, as it was allotted between the executive,
legislative and judicial branches - but they also believed it should be
vertically split between the federal government and state and local
governments. In this they even went so far as to say in the
Constitution, that those powers not specifically enumerated for the
federal government were to be left to local governments and the people.
So I support the underlying goals of reducing the backlog of disability
claims, and want our veterans to be treated with respect and timely
attention, but I believe we could have created a task force to examine
the problems here without also violating the Constitution."
Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA)
A few weeks ago, Rep. Sanford voted in favor of the Water Resources
Reforms Act, which passed the House by a vote of 417-3. The Congressman
had this to say on his vote:
"It represents an important step forward for Charleston and businesses
not only in our region, but across the state, as it is vital to
ensuring Charleston's Post-45 harbor deepening stays on schedule. But I
think that in addition to the economic impact back home, the cost
cutting measures and the provisions to increase efficiency, ultimately
there's a bigger consideration here which is a constitutional question
on the balance of power."
"This bill is about reclaiming authority that many contended was ceded
to the Executive Branch. I applaud the fact that this bill contains no
earmarks, yet preserves the role of the Congress in determining
spending priorities, rather than abdicate that responsibility to the
Executive Branch. In too many ways it seems to me we are moving towards
an imperial Presidency without traditional checks and balances. Beyond
the necessity of funding national infrastructure, this bill's greatest
accomplishment may well be its work in maintaining the balance of power.
MEDIA APPEARENCES
During the government shutdown, Rep. Sanford took to the House floor to
discuss the shutdown
, the closing of open-air monuments and facilities
, and political gamesmanship
, which you can watch by clicking on the underlined words.
Also during the shutdown, Rep. Sanford appeared on Fox and Friends
concerning his decision to bring back furloughed workers after the
House unanimously passed a bill to pay furloughed workers, saying at
the time that doing any less would result in a taxpayer subsidized
vacation. You can watch the interview here
. Rep. Sanford also appeared on Morning
Joe and you can watch it here
.
Recently, Rep. Sanford was on the Rocky D show to comment on Secretary
Sebelius's testimony about the rollout of the Affordable Care Act
exchanges, which you can listen to here
.
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN FOLLOW-UP
After the recent 16-day government shutdown, Rep. Sanford released the
following statement regarding donating his pay:
"A number of you have asked where I would be donating following the 16
day government shutdown...just to follow-up, I have decided to donate
$5,000 in total to the Spanish Moss Trail, the Lowcountry Open Land
Trust, Nemours Wildlife Foundation, the local Boy Scouts and Girl
Scouts, MUSC Children's Hospital, Volunteers in Medicine, the ALS
Association of South Carolina and the Lowcountry affiliate of Susan G.
Komen. These groups are of particular importance to me and fulfill a
variety of worthwhile missions here in the Lowcountry."
IN THE DISTRICT
Satellite Office Hours
Rep. Sanford's Beaufort office is busy conducting satellite office
hours around the county, in order to be as accessible as possible to
constituents requiring assistance on issues related to the federal
government. Recently, they held satellite office hours in Sun City,
Bluffton, Hilton Head Island and St. Helena. To get more information
about upcoming office hours, please call the Beaufort Office at
843-521-2530.
Neighborhood Office Hours
Rep. Sanford is continuing to hold Neighborhood Office Hours across the

November at the Piggly Wiggly in Moncks Corner. These informal
gatherings allow constituents to ask questions and hear the
Congressman's comments on what is happening in Washington.
Open Door After 4
Rep. Sanford held an "Open Door After 4" office hours on Thursday,
November 7th, and met with a number of constituents in his district
office. These events are informal "open house-style" meetings where

Message
from
Mark
Things
in
Washington
have
slowed
a
bit
since
October,
but
in
many
ways
this
is
but
the
calm
before
the
storm
-
so
there
is
no
shortage
of
information
on
which
to
update
you
and
accordingly
I
offer
a
few
thoughts.
The
Affordable
Care
Act
has
been
making
headlines,
but
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
part
of
a
much
bigger
budget
drama
in
Washington,
which
is
worth
delving
into
before
I
offer
thoughts
on
the
recent
news.
First,
I
may
have
beaten
the
budget
battle
to
death
over
the
last
month
with
a
number
of
newsletters
about
the
shutdown
(which
you
can
read
here ),
but
this
issue
isn&#8217;t
in
the
rear
view
mirror
yet.
The
next
deadline
for
agreement
in
Washington
on
the
budget
is
December
13th;
Paul
Ryan
from
the
House
and
Patty
Murray
from
the
Senate
have
been
charged
with
coming
to
a
deal
on
this
front
and
at
this
point
progress
seems
slow.
We
will
see
what
comes
next,
however
regardless
of
what
they
do
or
don&#8217;t
produce,
January
and
February
will
see
significant
deadlines
on
the
Continuing
Resolution
and
the
debt
ceiling.
The
tug
of
war
on
any
budget
solution
will
involve
two
major
issues.
First
is
dealing
with
the
driver
of
the
national
debt,
entitlement
spending,
and
at
this
point
there
seems
to
be
little
appetite
to
address
this
elephant
in
the
budget
room.
Which
leaves
a
second
elephant,
the
sequester.
As
you
may
recall
during
my
race
this
spring,
folks
in
Washington
exchanged
raising
the
debt
ceiling
for
a
cap
in
non-entitlement
spending.
It&#8217;s
not
the
big
part
of
the
budget,
but
important
just
the
same
given
that
it
capped
some
kind
of
spending
in
Washington.
This
is
a
big
deal
as
real
caps
in
Washington
spending
come
along
about
as
often
as
the
probability
of
your
neighbor
getting
struck
by
lightning
or
you
dying
of
a
spider
bite
tonight.
It
just
doesn&#8217;t
happen
a
lot.
I
think
many
conservatives,
&#8220;the
right,&#8221;
would
like
to
bust
the
budget
caps
imposed
by
the
sequester
because
of
their
impact
on
military
spending.
Many
liberals,
&#8220;the
left,&#8221;
would
like
to
do
the
same
for
the
way
this
type
of
spending
funds
many
interests
important
to
their
political
coalition.
So
I
suspect
if
there
is
any
sort
of
deal
between
Ryan
and
Murray
it
will
lie
in
raising
spending
now
(the
caps
on
domestic
discretionary)
in
exchange
for
future
cuts
in
entitlement
spending.
I
will
be
appropriately
open
minded,
but
suspicious,
of
any
such
deal
because
that
is
the
way
of
Washington
-
increase
spending
now
in
exchange
for
illusory
cuts
in
the
future.
Though
the
message
never
got
through,
and
was
certainly
drowned
by
the
back
and
forth
on
fund
vs.
don&#8217;t
fund
the
Affordable
Care
Act,
the
reason
I
think
there
was
legitimacy
to
Republicans
awkward
attempts
to
draw
a
line
in
the
sand
on
spending
is
because
the
government
shutdown
fireworks
are
so
theatrical
when
measured
against
the
reality
of
our
spending
problem.
We
have
a
profound
spending
addiction,
and
if
not
dealt
with
all
of
us
will
see
even
more
profound
consequences
in
terms
of
the
value
of
the
dollar,
future
inflation
and
our
way
of
life.
James
Hamilton
of
the
University
of
California
made
news
in
August
by
arguing
that
the
real
national
debt
was
actually
$70
trillion.
Lawrence
Kotlicoff
from
Boston
University
has
long
argued
the
national
debt
is
actually
over
$200
trillion.
David
Walker,
former
Comptroller
of
the
United
States,
has
argued
a
number
between
the
two.
Regardless
of
where
you
end
up,
all
these
numbers
are
far
above
the
$17
trillion
everyone
now
talks
about
in
Washington,
and
they
beg
the
larger
need
for
action.
These
numbers
are
relevant
particularly
in
the
current
debate
on
the
deficit,
where
the
President
and
others
have
argued
that
deficits
are
coming
down.
It
means
that
real
deficits
are
closer
to
$5
to
$7
trillion
a
year
and
growing.
Washington&#8217;s
inability
thus
far
to
react
to
these
numbers
remains
unsettling
because
even
in
the
recent
debt
ceiling
increase
the
debt
limit
was
actually
suspended,
rather
than
raised,
and
since
the
October
deal
the
debt
has
jumped
by
more
than
$300
billion!
I
won&#8217;t
belabor
my
opposition
to
this
method
of
handling
the
debt
ceiling,
but
I
say
all
this
to
remind
you
that
February
7th
is
approaching
quickly
and
without
a
budget
deal
that
addresses
the
long
term
drivers
of
our
debt,
I
am
concerned
Congress
will
give
the
President
another
blank
check
to
further
raise
the
debt
limit.
Going
back
to
the
news
of
the
day
&#8211;
it&#8217;s
obviously
centered
on
the
problems
associated
with
the
implementation
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act.
To
state
the
obvious,
it&#8217;s
been
a
disaster,
and
in
its
wake
I
think
several
things
stand
out.
One,
the
so
called
&#8220;Obamacare
disaster&#8221;
may
change
the
tenor
of
the
debt
and
Continuing
Resolution
debates
in
January
and
February.
In
politics,
the
quickest
way
of
changing
the
debate
lies
indeed
in
changing
the
discussion.
Harry
Reid
and
the
President
are
likely
to
want
to
deflect
from
the
Affordable
Care
Act
debate
by
instead
moving
to
a
new
discussion
on
these
two
issues.
Politically
it
would
make
sense,
so
I
would
not
be
surprised
to
see
new
wrinkles
on
those
upcoming
budget
related
debates.
Two,
people
like
choice.
Though
we
have
come
a
long
way
from
a
market
based
economy
over
the
last
50
years...still
ingrained
in
the
American
way
is
the
notion
of
an
individual&#8217;s
choice
superseding
government&#8217;s
choice
on
something
so
personal
as
heath
care.
The
administration
seemed
to
have
underestimated
this
reality.
Three,
given
the
ways
in
which
young
people
have
not
enrolled,
as
could
have
easily
been
anticipated,
the
costs
on
this
new
entitlement
are
going
to
sky
rocket.
This
means
particularly
bad
things
for
a
country
already
struggling
with
too
much
debt.
Finally,
once
again
words
matter
in
politics.
The
President
has
said
since
the
beginning
that
those
who
wanted
to
keep
their
insurance
would
be
able
to
under
the
new
law
(you
can
even
check
it
out
here ).
It
has
proven
and
will
continue
to
be
a
real
problem
given
the
degree
to
which
so
many
are
now
unhappy
with
their
new
plan.
As
I
am
sure
you
know,
even
President
Clinton
came
out
saying
that
this
shouldn&#8217;t
be
so,
and
that
the
President
should
honor
his
original
promise
to
let
individuals
keep
their
plans
if
they
like
them.
To
make
matters
worse,
we
now
know
that
the
White
House
knew
that
many
Americans
purchasing
individual
insurance
would
be
unable
to
keep
their
plan,
but
decided
to
keep
it
a
secret.
As
reported
in
the
Wall
Street
Journal,
White
House
aides
knew
they
had
a
problem,
but
decided
to
stick
with
the
promise
that
everyone
could
keep
their
plan
because
they
didn&#8217;t
want
to
&#8220;clutter
the
president&#8217;s
message.&#8221;
The
President
has
come
in
with
a
new
delay,
but
again
all
this
begs
the
larger
Constitutional
question
of
whether
or
not
the
executive
branch
has
the
right
to
unilaterally
change
law.
So
we
have
a
serious
mess
brewing
on
this
one
in
Washington.
In
12
short
years,
if
Congress
continues
to
avoid
cutting
our
deficit
and
making
real
reforms
to
spending,
our
debt
problems
will
reach
a
point
where
we
can
afford
nothing
but
interest
on
our
debt
and
funding
entitlement
programs
and
each
day
we
approach
the
financial
point
of
no
return.
All
this
makes efforts
here
in
Washington
that
much
more
important
and
accordingly
I
am
really
humbled
by
the
chance
to
try
and
make
a
difference
in
this
vital
debate.
The
next
few
months
will
be
a
crucial
time
in
getting
us
on
a
sustainable
path
and
I
am
sure
there
will
be
plenty
of
fireworks
along
the
way.
I&#8217;d
love
to
hear
more
of
your
thoughts
on
the
financial
problems
confronting
our
nation
or
your
personal
experiences
with
the
Affordable
Care
Act

RECENT
LEGISLATION
The
National
Security
Agency
As
new
and
additional
revelations
regarding
the
scope
of
the
NSA&#8217;s
activities
continue,
Rep.
Sanford
introduced
H.R.
3436:
The
NSA
Inspector
General
Act
of
2013,
in
order
to
provide
a
more
independent
IG
office
to
ensure
oversight
of
the
agency&#8217;s
activities
is
occurring.
Rep.
Sanford
gave
the
following
statement
explaining
why
he
introduced
the
legislation:
&#8220;Right
now,
the
IG
is
appointed
by
the
Director
of
the
NSA,
which
curbs
their
oversight
effectiveness
because
the
Director
can
remove
them.
It&#8217;s
a
real
simple
concept,
if
someone&#8217;s
ability
to
make
the
mortgage
is
determined
by
the
person
they
are
charged
with
evaluating,
their
assessments
will
be
less
than
totally
independent
because
their
finances
certainly
are
not
independent
of
their
bosses
decisions.
As
recently
noted
in
an
op-ed
by
the
former
IG
of
the
CIA,
Britt
Snider,
this
lack
of
independence
creates
an
environment
where
employees
of
the
IG&#8217;s
office
worry
about
their
careers
if
their
findings
and
conclusions
are
critical
of
the
agency.&#8221;
&#8220;There
are
a
number
of
reforms
that
need
to
be
made
at
the
NSA
to
ensure
the
Agency
is
not
violating
the
privacy
of
Americans,
but
without
a
robust
IG
office,
these
reforms
will
lack
the
teeth
they
need
to
be
enforced.
In
this
vein,
I
feel
this
legislation
is
a
reasonable
and
necessary
step
that
will
help
bring
positive
change
to
the
Agency.&#8221;

this
bill

Flood
Insurance
Many
in
the
Lowcountry
are
seeing
the
cost
of
their
insurance
increase
as
the
Biggert-Waters
legislation
reforming
flood
insurance
goes
into
effect.
Rep.
Sanford
has
signed
on
as
a
cosponsor
to
H.R.
3370,
the
Homeowner
Flood
Insurance
Affordability
Act,
in
order
to
enact
a
delay
until
the
affordability
of
these
reforms
is
considered.
Rep.
Sanford
explained
his
support
for
the
bill
by
saying:
&#8220;I
decided
to
co-sponsor
the
Homeowner
Flood
Insurance
Affordability
Act
because
the
Biggert-Waters
legislation
that
passed
last
year,
while
well
intended,
is
flawed.
I
wasn't
there
during
its
passage,
but
in
this
case
you
have
a
bill
that
puts
the
cart
before
the
horse.
It
allows
government
to
set
new
premiums
now
and
charge
more
without
disclosure
of
how
they
are
deriving
their
new
rates.
As
a
conservative
it
seems
reasonable
to
say
why
and
how,
when
government
just
says
&#8216;trust
me,&#8217;
and
the
degree
to
which
the
original
bill
is
flawed
is
highlighted
by
the
fact
that
even
Maxine
Waters,
who
authored
the
Biggert-Waters
bill,
has
now
cosponsored
this
bill
that
amends
her
bill.&#8221;
&#8220;A
&#8216;time-out&#8217;
and
delaying
implementation
of
Biggert-Waters
accordingly
makes
sense
to
me.
Change
will
come
in
time
to
all
these
programs,
but
it
should
be
done
in
a
business-like
manner
that
allows
markets
and
people
the
ability
to
respond
and
plan
in
a
way
that
the
current
bill
does
not.&#8221;
Investigating
Benghazi
Recently
Rep.
Sanford
signed
on
as
a
cosponsor
to
H.R.
36,
which
creates
a
select
committee
to
investigate
last
year&#8217;s
attack
on
the
U.S.
Consulate
in
Benghazi,
Libya
which
resulted
in
the
deaths
of
U.S.
Ambassador
Chris
Stevens
and
three
of
his
staff.
Rep.
Sanford
released
the
following
statement
regarding
his
decision
to
cosponsor
it:
&#8220;The
question
now
is
whether
or
not
a
breakdown
in
the
chain
of
command
occurred,
or
if
the
decision
was
made
not
to
intervene,
which
would
be
even
more
alarming.
While
we
cannot
change
what
happened,
we
can
learn
from
it
and
I
believe
the
families
of
slain
American
personnel,
as
well
as
the
American
people,
deserve
to
know
what
occurred.&#8221;
RECENT
VOTES
Below
are
a
few
notes
on
recent
votes
Rep.
Sanford
has
taken:
HR
2189:
Rep.
Sanford
voted
against
H.R.
2189,
which
came
before
the
House
on
Tuesday,
October
29,
and
passed
404-1
saying,
&#8220;I
don&#8217;t
want
it
to
be
misinterpreted
that
I
don&#8217;t
think
things
should
not
be
done
to
improve
the
quality
of
care
for
those
who
have
faithfully
served
our
nation,
but
as
the
only
former
Governor
in
the
Congress,
I
think
I
have
a
valuable
and
unique
perspective
on
the
importance
of
doing
so
in
a
way
that
does
not
undermine
prerogatives
that
have
rested
with
states
for
the
last
200
years.&#8221;
The
Congressman
released
the
following
statement
on
the
bill:
&#8220;The
bill
at
first
brush
looked
good
because
it
creates
a
committee
to
address
the
backlog
of
disability
claims
at
the
VA,
but
I
wound
up
being
the
dissenting
vote
against
it
for
reasons
I&#8217;ll
offer
in
just
a
moment.
Before
doing
so
let
me
say
that
taking
care
of
our
veterans
is
something
that&#8217;s
deeply
important
to
me
&#8211;
the
federal
government
made
a
commitment
to
them
when
they
commissioned
or
enlisted,
and
it&#8217;s
disgraceful
that
over
900,000
veterans
are
still
waiting
for
timely
care
and
attention
to
their
benefits
applications.
I&#8217;ve
voted
several
times
in
the
few
months
I
have
been
in
Congress
for
measures
to
reduce
this
backlog,
and
while
this
task
force
would
have
been
another
positive
step
forward,
one
provision
of
this
bill
violated
10th
Amendment
states&#8217;
rights,
and
that
is
ultimately
why
I
cast
my
vote
against
it
&#8211;
and
that
I&#8217;d
like
to
address.
&#8220;In
order
to
speed
up
the
process
of
evaluating
medical
claims,
this
bill
will
allow
doctors
contracted
by
the
VA
to
travel
across
state
borders
and
perform
medical
exams
in
any
state,
as
long
as
they
are
licensed
in
one
state.
There&#8217;s
no
doubt
that
we
need
more
physicians
performing
exams
to
determine
if
a
veteran
is
eligible
for
disability
benefits,
but
the
problem
here
lies
with
how
we
license
doctors
in
this
country.
We&#8217;ve
established
a
system
where
each
state
sets
their
own
licensing
standards
for
physicians
practicing
within
their
state
&#8211;
South
Carolina
might
have
very
different
requirements
of
their
physicians
than
California,
and
so
on.
Allowing
a
physician
to
practice
in
any
state,
even
if
it
is
for
the
good
purpose
of
helping
our
veterans,
would
trample
on
the
ability
of
states
to
determine
who
is
eligible
to
practice
within
their
own
boundaries.
Unfortunately
doing
so
breaks
the
concept
of
federalism
the
founding
fathers
believed
was
so
important
to
maintaining
liberty
because
their
premise
was
that
power
was
to
be
divided
in
as
many
ways
as
possible.
At
the
federal
level
horizontally,
as
it
was
allotted
between
the
executive,
legislative
and
judicial
branches
-
but
they
also
believed
it
should
be
vertically
split
between
the
federal
government
and
state
and
local
governments.
In
this
they
even
went
so
far
as
to
say
in
the
Constitution,
that
those
powers
not
specifically
enumerated
for
the
federal
government
were
to
be
left
to
local
governments
and
the
people.
So
I
support
the
underlying
goals
of
reducing
the
backlog
of
disability
claims,
and
want
our
veterans
to
be
treated
with
respect
and
timely
attention,
but
I
believe
we
could
have
created
a
task
force
to
examine
the
problems
here
without
also
violating
the
Constitution.&#8221;
Water
Resources
Reform
and
Development
Act
(WRRDA)
A
few
weeks
ago,
Rep.
Sanford
voted
in
favor
of
the
Water
Resources
Reforms
Act,
which
passed
the
House
by
a
vote
of
417-3.
The
Congressman
had
this
to
say
on
his
vote:
&#8220;It
represents
an
important
step
forward
for
Charleston
and
businesses
not
only
in
our
region,
but
across
the
state,
as
it
is
vital
to
ensuring
Charleston&#8217;s
Post-45
harbor
deepening
stays
on
schedule.
But
I
think
that
in
addition
to
the
economic
impact
back
home,
the
cost
cutting
measures
and
the
provisions
to
increase
efficiency,
ultimately
there&#8217;s
a
bigger
consideration
here
which
is
a
constitutional
question
on
the
balance
of
power.&#8221;
&#8220;This
bill
is
about
reclaiming
authority
that
many
contended
was
ceded
to
the
Executive
Branch.
I
applaud
the
fact
that
this
bill
contains
no
earmarks,
yet
preserves
the
role
of
the
Congress
in
determining
spending
priorities,
rather
than
abdicate
that
responsibility
to
the
Executive
Branch.
In
too
many
ways
it
seems
to
me
we
are
moving
towards
an
imperial
Presidency
without
traditional
checks
and
balances.
Beyond
the
necessity
of
funding
national
infrastructure,
this
bill&#8217;s
greatest
accomplishment
may
well
be
its
work
in
maintaining
the
balance
of
power.
