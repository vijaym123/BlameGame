Friend,
As my first term in Congress comes to a close, I want to take a moment to say what an honor it has been to serve the people of Sacramento County and to have your ongoing support. It has been a challenging term, but I am optimistic about what the future holds.
The best part of the holiday season is remembering those who make the holidays meaningful and
I am looking forward to spending time with my family.
The last couple years have been a new experience for us and I am thankful for all their support and encouragement throughout the process. I couldn&#39;t imagine doing it without them.
Thank you from Janine, Syd, and I.
I hope you have a safe and prosperous holiday season. Happy Holidays!
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
