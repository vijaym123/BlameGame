Investing in Montana
Dear David,
The House and Senate spent this past week voting on a number of different budget proposals for the next year.
Unfortunately, all of those proposals fall short of what most Montanans expect from their elected leaders.
Since 2009, we have reduced our deficits by about two-thirds and started to grow our economy again.
We need to continue this careful balance of deficit reduction and economic growth.
The President's plan doesn't do enough to reduce our deficit, while the House and Senate versions make drastic cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, education, and health care. They sell off our public lands and hurt children and low-income families.
I have a different idea about how to balance our budget, and it requires taking a hard look at our spending overseas.
The United States can no longer afford to fight international conflicts alone.
Don't get me wrong - we need to take international threats like ISIS or Russian aggression against Ukraine seriously.
But ISIS and Russia poses just as serious a threat to our allies.
And they need to step up to the plate.
And once they do, it will free up billions of dollars that we can put towards public education and health care and infrastructure and forest management and lower taxes.
Those are the investments we must make.
Not another war.
I will work to make sure my fellow senators understand that.
It's a pleasure to serve you,
