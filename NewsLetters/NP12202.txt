Local Boy Does Good, Drought Assistance for Southwest Texas,
Celebrating the State 6-Man Football Champions, ExxonMobil accepting
STEM internships, Hitting the Road in District 23
Hello Friend,
This was a busy week in Texas. I traveled from San Antonio to El Paso
and visited a lot of the Permian Basin region. Here's a quick look at
my week.

Local Boy Does Good
I love seeing local folks do well. This week, the USA Women's Bobsled
Team won the silver and bronze medals at the 2014 Winter Olympics in
Sochi, Russia. Less than a second separated them from the first place
team.
You're asking why I care about bobsledding?
The team's coach is Todd Hays from Del Rio, Texas. Todd is a former
Olympic silver medalist himself and his presence was called a "game
changer" by his team members.
Congratulations to Todd & the team!
Loving County Eligible for Drought Relief from USDA
What happened to Loving County? That's the question that was asked when
Loving County was left off the list of counties eligible for federal
drought relief assistance.
Well, ask no more. Ranchers in Loving
County will now be eligible for federal drought relief assistances
through a disaster declaration from the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA).
The drought has deeply impacted both farmers and ranchers - they've
been hit very hard. Now, these men and women who put food on our table
can protect their farms and ranch lands through LOW-interest emergency
loans from the USDA. As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, I
continue to work with Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack to make
resources available and to protect our small businesses and our local
economies. For a full list of drought stricken counties in 23rd
District of Texas, click here
.
A disaster designation makes farmers in primary counties and
surrounding counties eligible for assistance from the Farm Service
Agency (FSA), including FSA emergency loans. FSA considers each
emergency loan application on its own merits, taking into account the
extent of production losses on the farm, and the security and repayment
ability of the farmer or rancher.

The Best of the Best: The Grandfalls-Royalty Cowboys
The Grandfalls-Royalty Cowboys won the state football championship in
the 6-Man Division this year. I got to meet the school's football team
and present them with certificates for their achievement.
It is very
impressive to win a state championship.
I spoke to both students, coaches and teachers. Absolutely everyone in
town is proud of their accomplishments. Since most of theorem is
comprised of sophomores, I wish Grandfalls-Royalty a repeat performance
in the coming football season. Earlier this year, I spoke on the floor
of the House of Representatives congratulating them on their big win.

Hispanic Students Encouraged to Apply for ExxonMobil Fellowship
ExxonMobil and Hispanic Heritage Foundation have partnered to offer
Hispanic college students a fellowship focusing on the STEM field
(science, technology, engineering and math). I encourage students to
apply for the ExxonMobil Loft Fellowship.
These two great organizations are helping to prepare the next
generation of computer engineers, statisticians, and chemists as our
young people get ready to enter the 21st century workforce. The
fellowship provides the tools and training Latinos need to succeed
through real-life experiences and mentoring. I thank ExxonMobil and
Hispanic Heritage Foundation for their efforts and for offering
additional educational opportunities.
For more information, visit Hispanic Heritage Foundation website
. Applications will close April 15, 2014. All
interested candidates can apply here
: If you have any questions please email
Julian@hispanicheritage.org. Please use "ExxonMobil LOFT Fellowship" in
subject line.
Gone to Texas
I spent the week in Texas visiting with constituents, "road-tripping"
the district and addressing issues of importance to veterans, seniors
and business owners.
I was in El Paso to speak to a chamber of commerce luncheon. I visited
Rankin, Big Lake and several other small towns across West Texas. My
staff was around, too, and they made visits of their own. All in all, a
great week of outreach.
Lastly, thanks again for letting me be your congressman. If I can help
you with a federal agency or issue, please call on any of our offices.
The phone numbers and addresses are listed below. I've never been a big
fan of politics - helping people is my favorite part of the job. Please
put us to work for you.
Sincerely,
Pete P. Gallego
