David -- Republicans are blowing this election. And Democrats are taking advantage.
Brand new polls from NBC, Fox News, and USA Today all show Democrats tied or with the lead nationally. That&rsquo;s a huge surge from the numbers just last month!
And we are completely destroying Republicans at the ground game -- it&rsquo;s our biggest Get Out The Vote effort ever.
Let&rsquo;s keep it going!
