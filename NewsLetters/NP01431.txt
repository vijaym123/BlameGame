Recently, legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives to allow law-abiding Americans who have concealed carry permits in their home states to legally bring their firearms into any other state with concealed carry laws. Under the bill, titled the
Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2015 , gun owners would still be required to comply with any concealed carry laws in any state they are visiting.
This legislation was created as a common sense solution to the often confusing patchwork of state and local laws, which can pose a real problem for gun owners who may accidentally cross state lines with guns they are legally permitted to carry in their home states.
Congressman Forbes supports the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2015, and has consistently voted to uphold Second Amendment rights.
