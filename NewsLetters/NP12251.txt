Dear Friends,
President Obama briefly visited the Central Valley today and promised to spread all kinds of money around our
communities. What he
didnt
promise was any meaningful action to restore our water supply. When we asked him for water, he apparently thought we said welfare.
Rep. David Valadao, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, and I comment on Obamas visit, and on his ridiculous focus on global
warming,
here .
