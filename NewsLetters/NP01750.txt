Friends,
I traveled this week as part of a Congressional delegation to Tunisia and Ukraine, both of which are embattled U.S. allies.
In Tunis, Tunisia, the delegation laid a wreath to commemorate the innocent lives taken during the recent terrorist attack at the Bardo National Museum. As freedom loving people, we will work together to secure a hopeful and prosperous future, and defeat the despair and bondage that terrorism seeks to impose.

The delegations visit to Ukraine comes after the House passed a bipartisan resolution last week that urges the president to provide lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine.

Its important that the United States stands in solidarity with Ukraine in their quest for a free and democratic future in the face of Russian aggression. This visit has been critical in getting real time information from Ukrainian leaders concerning recent developments.
Freedom First,
Congressman Tom Graves
