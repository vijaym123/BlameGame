A Bipartisan
Defense Bill Passes a Divided House

A Bipartisan
Defense Bill Passes a Divided House
I am proud to
report that the House of Representatives passed the Fiscal Year 2016
Department of Defense Appropriations bill, drafted by my Defense
Subcommittee, yesterday.
This is the legislation which funds critical
national security needs, military operations abroad, and health and
quality-of-life programs for the men and women of the Armed Forces and
their families.
In total, our bill provides $578.6 billion in
funding, an increase of $24 billion above the last years level and
$800 million above the Presidents budget, submitted in
February.
This includes $88.4 billion in Global War on Terrorism (GWOT)
funding for war efforts and related costs.
This total is
approximately $38 billion more than the President sought, because, frankly, the
world is a much more unstable, unpredictable and dangerous place for
America and our vital interests these days.
As I said
in my closing remarks to the whole House yesterday, over 200,000 men
and women in uniform do the hard work of freedom every day across the
globe
in Afghanistan, Iraq, the Sinai, the Korean DMZ and many other
places.
Those members of our armed forces, and their comrades who
serve here at home, also deserve our admiration and untiring
thanks.
They deserve the support of the whole Congress!
And
yet, a remarkable event occurred Thursday morning: the Presidents
Secretary of Defense appeared before the House Democratic Caucus to
discuss the administrations opposition to my bill. This is more
remarkable because our defense bill has
always
had bipartisan support!
And yet, I am proud that my bill
passed with such a substantial margin.
Even though all Democrats
should have supported this excellent legislation, 43 of them broke from
Nancy Pelosi and voted for my bill, honoring our time-honored tradition
that Americas national security is a non-partisan priority.
With all the growing threats in the world today, our
national security is far too important to fall victim to political games. We
cannot risk having an underfunded military during these uncertain
times, and our troops deserve unfailing support as they lay their lives on
the line. This bill fulfills our responsibilities to properly fund
programs for our warfighters, our military families, our national
security, and for the success of our missions both now and in the
future.
I invite you to read my opening statement, delivered on
Wednesday when the debate began,

Our
counterparts in the Senate have started work on their version of the
Defense Appropriations bill.
However, Democrats in that chamber
have vowed to block all spending measures from consideration until
there is a resolution on larger budget issues.
That is a
dangerous injection of partisanship into a dangerous national security
climate.
New day. Same
war.
Waiting for the Presidents Complete Plan for
ISIL
Even as the President threatens to veto our Defense Appropriations
bill which provides him with the funds and resources that he needs as
Commander-in-Chief, the President is ordering another 450 U.S. troops
to Anbar province in Iraq.
Military planners are said to be
"actively looking at sites for new bases in Iraq, which might require
hundreds of additional troops!
Of course, we are still waiting
for the President to develop a complete battle plan against ISIL in
Iraq and Syria.
