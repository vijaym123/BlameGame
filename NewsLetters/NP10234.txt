Friends,
With Congress out of session for the Easter recess, I spent time
visiting with constituents throughout Alabama's Second Congressional
District. Meeting with constituent groups, touring local businesses,
and checking out our area's schools are some of the most important and
rewarding parts of my job. Check out a recap of our stops below.
Andalusia
I traveled from Montgomery to Andalusia for a meeting with the
Andalusia Rotary Club
. We
talked a lot about job creation in Alabama and our changing economy. I
explained why I believe it should be a top priority for our state to
produce a skilled workforce that is suited for the new manufacturing
jobs in our area. One of best ways to do that is through career and
technical education programs, which help prepare students for the
workforce through real-world, hands-on training.
While obtaining a four year degree is certainly a worthy goal, it is
not right for everyone. Students need to understand that there are many
routes to success, and they should pick the career path that best
utilizes their unique skills, interests, and abilities.
After the Rotary Club lunch, we headed to Lurleen B. Wallace Community
College to meet with their staff, students, and faculty and learn more
about their campus. I was especially impressed by the work LBWCC does
on multiple campuses to prepare students for their next steps in life,
be that college or career. Now, the college is working with area high
schools to connect high school students with career paths before they
even graduate. I appreciate President Riedel and the staff for the
informative visit.
Montgomery
This week I hosted several informative meetings in my Montgomery
office. I enjoyed talking with Dr. Walter Hill, Provost of Tuskegee
University and Dean of the College of Agriculture, about some great
programs Tuskegee has to promote agriculture in our state. Next, I met
with a group of homeschool students and parents from Houston County.
The group was very sharp and asked great questions about our nation's
system of government.
I also met with the Montgomery chapter of the Medical Group Management.
We talked about how ObamaCare has affected their industry, as well as
some conservative solutions to make health care work for more
Americans. It is so beneficial to hear directly from those who deal
with the particulars of health care policy.
I was excited to finally meet the winners of this year's Congressional
Art Competition in my Montgomery office.
This year's winner is
Karvarus Moore, a junior at Booker T. Washington High School in
Montgomery. His winning artwork, which can be seen above, was a ink,
watercolor, and colored pencil drawing entitled "Dream." This painting
will go on to hang in the U.S. Capitol.
Justin Sloan, a senior from Prattville High School, was named runner-up
for his drawing titled "A Trip Back." Justin's drawing will hang in my
Washington D.C. office.
The annual art competition is open to all high school students in
Alabama's Second Congressional District. It is my honor to promote and
support the many artistic talents of Alabama students. You can learn
more about the annual Congressional Art Competition here
.
Elmore County
On Wednesday I drove up to Millbrook for a meeting of the
Millbrook-Coosada Kiwanis Club. We had a great conversation about
efforts in Congress to rein in executive overreach. I talked
specifically about our efforts to get answers on the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) program targeting the
southeastern automotive industry
. It is
wrong for the Obama administration to use a federal agency to advance a
political agenda, and I will continue to fight against overreaching
activity in federal agencies, especially those that threaten jobs in
this already difficult economy.
Later that day I visited Holtville High School, which recently won the
impressive distinction of being named a National Blue Ribbon School. It
was easy to see why Holtville won such an honor once I met their
teachers, staff, and students. Holtville has some very impressive
career and technical education programs which help prepare students for
the workforce. A special thank you to Principal Jimmy Hull and his
staff for their hospitality during the informative visit.
Greenville
On Thursday I travelled down Interstate 65 to Greenville. I met with
new Butler County Schools Superintendent Amy Bryan and visited the
"Bright Beginnings" Pre-K program there at the central office. It was
such a treat to visit with the children and learn about their top-notch
Pre-K program, including their partnership with AmeriCorps.
Next I visited with Mayor Dexter McLendon at city hall about some of
the new economic development projects in Greenville. Mayor McLendon
took me to Ozark Materials, which produces thermoplastic. Thermoplastic
is the material used to stripe roads across our state. From there, we
headed to the Greenville YMCA where I learned about how the community
is bringing public and private entities together to help children and
families in need. As a life-long YMCA supporter, it was inspiring to
see what a difference they are making in Greenville.
The Week Ahead
Next week, the House is expected to begin full consideration of the two
appropriations bills which passed out of committee a few weeks ago. As
you may remember, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs
Appropriations Act
has important language I advocated for that supports
a new health care program for veterans and prioritizes air traffic
control tower construction projects.
Additionally, the House is expected to consider:
*
H.R. 4486
, the Military
Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations
Act;
*
H.R. 4487
, the
Legislative Branch Appropriations Act;
*
H.R. 4414
, the Expatriate
Health Coverage Clarification Act; and
*
H.R. 4194
, The Government
Reports Elimination Act.
As always, please feel free to contact one of my offices
if we can ever be of help to you. Thank you again for
allowing me to serve as your representative.

Montgomery
This

about
some

has
to
promote
agriculture
in
our
state.
Next,
I
met
with
a
group
of
homeschool
students
and
parents
from
Houston
County.
The
group
was
very
sharp
and
asked
great
questions
about
our
nation&#8217;s
system
of
government.
I
also
met
with

A
special

Hull
and
his
staff
for
their

the
informative
visit.
Greenville
On
Thursday
I
travelled
down
Interstate
65
to
Greenville.
I
met
with
new
Butler
County
Schools
Superintendent
Amy
Bryan
and
visited
the
&#8220;Bright
Beginnings&#8221;
Pre-K
program
there
at
the
central
office.
It
was
such
a
treat
to
visit
with
the
children
and
learn
about
their
top-notch
Pre-K
program,
including
their
partnership
with
AmeriCorps.
Next
I
visited
with
Mayor
Dexter
McLendon
at
city
hall
about
some
of
the
new
economic
development
projects
in
Greenville.
Mayor
McLendon
took
me
to
Ozark
Materials,
which
produces
thermoplastic.
Thermoplastic
is
the
material
used
to
stripe
roads
across
our
state.
From
there,
we
headed
to
the
Greenville
YMCA
where
I
learned
about
how
the
community
is
bringing
public
and
private
entities
together
to
help
children
and
families
in
need.
As
a
life-long
YMCA
supporter,
it
was
inspiring
to
see
what
a
difference
they
are
making
in
Greenville.
The
Week
Ahead
Next
week,
the
House
is
expected
to
begin
full
consideration
of
the
two
appropriations
bills
which
passed
out
of
committee
a
few
weeks
ago.
As
you
may
remember,
the
Military
Construction
and
Veterans
Affairs
Appropriations
Act
has
important
language
I
advocated
for
that
supports
a
new
health
care
program
for
veterans
and
prioritizes
air
traffic
control
tower
construction
projects.
Additionally,
the
House
is
expected
to
consider: H.R.
4486 ,
the
Military
Construction
and
Veterans
Affairs
and
Related
Agencies
Appropriations
Act; H.R.
4487 ,
the
Legislative
Branch
Appropriations
Act;
H.R.
4414 ,
the
Expatriate
Health
Coverage
Clarification
Act;
and H.R.
4194 ,
The
Government
Reports
Elimination
Act.
As
always,
please
feel
free
to
contact
one
of
my
offices
if
we
can
ever
be
of
help
to
you.
Thank
