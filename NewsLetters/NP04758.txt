Washington D.C. - Today, Rep. Gregg Harper (R-Miss.) issued the following statement upon being notified that U.S. Marine Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi had arrived back in the United States after his release from a Mexican prison.
After 214 days, Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi is finally back on American soil. I am glad that he is back with his family and can now put this horrific experience behind him. I had originally expected that the Administration would use all means necessary to get Sgt. Tahmooressi released from imprisonment in Mexico. As this terrible period in his and his familys lives finally comes to a close, I believe the Administration could have done much more to secure his release. This clearly was not a top priority for them. Welcome home Sgt. Tahmooressi.
