Dear Friends,
I had
a busy couple of weeks in Utah
I wanted to give you an update on what I have been doing in Utah
the past couple of weeks before Congress came back in session on April
13th. I've always said, the best part of my job is being able to leave
Washington to come home and meet with you. Here is a short re-cap of
the things I have been doing.
Visited elementary students
in Loa &amp; Circleville
In addition to being a
dairy farmer, my father was also a school teacher. I have a deep
appreciation for those that dedicate their lives to our youth. Thank you for
the great work you are doing.
Talked with Glen Mills on ABC 4
Utah
This
segment
outlines the concerns I have
over President Obama's negotiations with Iran.
Good Things
Utah
I had such a great time on
Good Things Utah
sharing my family's omelet recipe.
Hosted a town hall meeting in
Delta
Town hall meetings are a great
tool for you to express your opinions and let your voice be heard. In an
effort to be more accessible, I frequently hold telephone town hall
conversations. If you would like to be included on the next one,
register at
stewart.house.gov.
Celebrated the new Community Health Center
in Escalante
I was honored to attend the ribbon cutting
ceremony to celebrate the opening of the Kazan Medical Clinic in
Escalante. These Health Centers are critical for communites throughout rural
Utah.
