Hello,
I hope you had a good week. Here's what I was up
to:
Fast
Track
On Friday I voted against
giving President Obama Fast Track Authority to negotiate international
trade deals. A bad trade deal could really do damage to our country and to
manufacturing as a whole, and I heard loud and clear from my
constituents that you did not want me to support
this.
Bearacade
This week I had a
productive meeting with representatives from
Bearacade .
Created after the tragedy at Chardon High School, this Hudson-based company
produces a door stop which prevents intruders from getting in &amp;
buys law enforcement crucial
time.
Our intern Taylor, a Chardon HS graduate, joined us for
the meeting to provide her
perspective.
Appropriations
Once again the committee
that I serve on, the House Committee on Appropriations, had another big
week. Here's what we
did.
Passed
the
FY16 Transportation, Housing &amp; Urban
Development
funding Bill out of the
House.
Passed
the
FY
16 Defense Appropriations Bill
out of the
House
Passed
the
FY16
Interior &amp; Environment Appropriations Bill
out of our
Interior Subcommittee. This bill includes $300 Million for the Great
Lakes Restoration Initiative, funding that I fought to be
included.
Passed
the
FY16 State &amp; Foreign Operations Bill
out of the full
Appropriations
Committee.
Released
the
FY16 Financial Services &amp;
General Government Appropriations
Bill
Girl
Scouts
In the midst of meetings, hearings and votes, I had a
chance to give Girl Scouts
Troop 91036, from Twinsburg, a tour of the
Capitol.
As I hope you can tell, we have been
working hard in Congress and I will continue to serve you to the best of
my ability every
day.
