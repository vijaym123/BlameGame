Dear Friends,
Unemployment rates in Delaware and around the country are at their
lowest levels in seven years. In fact, the Delaware Department of Labor
says our employment picture has improved by every metric, with a
falling unemployment rate, an increase in jobs, and rising wages and
earnings. Gallup recently found that job creation in Delaware is the
10th best in the country, outpacing the entire Eastern Seaboard.
But despite the good news, reducing unemployment in the First State
further remains a top priority for me. Now is the time to keep momentum
going until everyone who wants a job has one.
This week I joined Senator Coons and Congressman Carney in kicking off
our first of three job fairs this spring. For the past four years, we
have been proud to host these events that connect Delawareans searching
for jobs and companies who are looking to hire.
About 400 people attended Mondays job fair at Wilmington Universitys
Dover campus, including employers ranging from the Wilmington Police
Department to Christiana Care Health System and Aflac. We also had
experts there to provide on-site workshops on resume-writing and
interviewing skills.
If youre in the market for a new job or could use some help preparing
for the market then mark the next two job fairs on your calendars for:
Friday, April 10 from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. at Delaware Technical Community
Colleges Stanton campus
Monday, May 4 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Rehoboth Beach Convention
Center
Ive said many times that we dont create jobs in government; we help
create a nurturing environment that promotes job growth and
preservation. These job fairs are one small part of that. I hope to see
you there.

Dear
Friends,
Unemployment
rates
in
Delaware
and
around
the
country
are
at
their
lowest
levels
in
seven
years.
In
fact,
t he
Delaware
Department
of
Labor
says
our
employment
picture
has
improved
by
every
metric,
with
a
falling
unemployment
rate,
an
increase
in
jobs,
and
rising
wages
and
earnings.
Gallup
recently
found
that
job
creation
in
Delaware
is
the
10th
best
in
the
country,
outpacing
the
entire
Eastern
S eaboard.
But
despite
the
good
news ,
reducing
unemployment
in
the
First
State
further
remains
a
top
prior ity
for
me.
Now
is
the
time
to
keep
momentum
going
until
everyone
who
wants
a
job
has
one.
This
week
I
joined
Senator
Coons
and
Congressman
Carney
in
kicking
off
our
first
of
three
job
fairs
this
spring.
For
the
past
four
years,
we
have
been
proud
to
host
these
events
that
connect
Delawareans
searching
for
jobs
and
companies
who
are
looking
to

About
400
people
attended
Monday&#146;s
job
fair
at
Wilmington
University&#146;s
Dover
campus,
including
employers
ranging
from

If
you&#146;re
in
the
market
for
a
new
job
or
could
use
some
help
preparing
for
the
market
then
m ark
the

I&#146;ve
said
many
times
that
we
don&#146;t
create
jobs
in

we

a
nurturing
envi ronment
that
promotes
job

These

of
that.
I
hope
to
see
you
there.
