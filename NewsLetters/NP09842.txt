VISITING DC
May 09, 2014
This week the Senate passed the
Kilah Davenport Child Protection Act , which I introduced in December
as the Senate companion to Rep. Robert Pittenger's House legislation
( H.R. 3627 ).
This bill will require the
Department of Justice to do a study on state child abuse penalties, which
will serve as an important resource for determining if penalties are
sufficient to protect children.
Having passed both the House of
Representatives and the Senate, this legislation will now move to the
Presidents desk to be signed into law.
I cannot say enough
how pleased I am that the Senate passed the Kilah Davenport Act, and I
want to thank Representative Pittenger for his tireless advocacy on
behalf of the family and the abused.
I only regret Kilah did not
survive to see her issue championed -- God bless her and her family.

Next week, the Senate
Committee on Veterans Affairs will once again hold a hearing on the
state of health care at VA facilities, with Secretary Shinseki expected
to testify alongside other witnesses. Following the deaths in Phoenix,
Shinseki called for a nationwide review of VA clinics on Thursday.
During next weeks hearing I
hope that Secretary Shinseki will at
long last own up to the problems at VA hospitals and health centers,
explain why it took so long to acknowledge said problems, discuss what
he is doing to fix those problems, and hopefully answer some tough
questions about his leadership of the agency.
This recent
report from Phoenix is one more on a pile of hundreds detailing alarming
problems and avoidable deaths in VA facilities. For two years some of us
on the committee have been waving flags and vocalizing the major
problems the VA is facing, with little more than a letter in response. Our
veterans deserve better than what the current regime is providing and
Im not sure we can accomplish anything with the current
leadership.
On Tuesday, I joined my Republican colleagues on the Senate
Finance Committee in sending a letter to Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) Commissioner John Koskinen demanding answers as to how the IRS
plans to prevent future bonus payments from being given to employees with
conduct, performance, and tax compliance issues.
I hope the
Commissioner will respond quickly and that a vote on my legislation
introduced last week -- No Bonuses for Tax Cheats Act -- will take
place in the near future, ensuring that this does not happen again. To
