A Veterans
Day Message from Senator Patty Murray
Veterans Deserve Better than to Be
Held Hostage by Politics
After
seeing the partisanship and dysfunction
during the government shutdown last month,
many veterans across the country are angry
at their elected officials and skeptical
that Congress can get anything done. But
the bipartisan budget conference,
Co-Chaired by Senator Murray, offers
Congress opportunity to rebuild some trust,
find a path to compromise, and work
together to create jobs and boost our
fragile economy. -

Senate Budget Chairman Murray's Opening
Statement.
If there is one lesson to be
learned from past month, its this:
the only way we can avoid gridlock and
crisisand the only way either side
can get what they want is through
compromise and bipartisanship,
said Senator Murray.
Thats what the American
people are expecting from this conference.
And I am looking forward to getting to
work.
During the shutdown, Senator Murray
worked tirelessly to pressure leaders in
both parties to reopen the government
immediately, get to work on negotiating a
budget, and replace the harmful spending
cuts known as sequestration -- so as to not
continue harming our nations heroes
and their families.
In the News:
VA:
All veterans benefit payments
will be disrupted if a shutdown goes
beyond two weeks
This is a big reason why its
critical that the House join with the
Senate to act quickly and keep the
government open without any political
games,
said Sen. Patty Murray, (D-Wash.), who
is chairman of the Senate budget
committee.
Our nations heroes, who
are already waiting too long for the
benefits they deserve, shouldnt be
held at the mercy of gridlock and
dysfunction in Washington,
D.C.

Murray Applauds Passage of Bill to
Expand and Improve VA Programs for Homeless
Vets and Their Families
Those
who heroically served America in the
military should not find themselves
struggling to find a bed to sleep in or a
meal to eat, said Senator Murray.
With new servicemembers returning
home every day and the economy on the road
to recovery, it is critically important to
continue supporting programs that help our
veterans and their families access stable
housing. I remain committed to
providing Americas veterans and
their families with the sense of security
and dignity they all deserve.

War veterans face epilepsy as
side effect of head trauma
In 2007, Senator Murray introduced
legislation to require VA to establish 4-6
epilepsy centers of excellence and create a
national coordinator for epilepsy programs.
The bill, which was signed into law in
October 2008, also authorized $6 million
per year for care, research and education
done by the centers. Currently, veterans in
our state have access to two centers
one at VAMC Portland and the other
at VAMC Puget Sound. For more information

Murray Applauds Passage of Veterans
Cost-Of-Living Increase
Particularly in this difficult
economy, our veterans deserve a boost in
their benefits to help make ends
meet, Senator Murray said. We
have an obligation to the men and women who
have sacrificed so much to serve our
country and who now deserve nothing less
than the full support of a grateful
nation. A COLA increase will help
bring us one step closer to fulfilling our
nations promise to care for our
brave veterans and their
families.

Senator Murrays Statement on
Efforts to Correct Discriminatory Hiring
Practices for Veterans at BPA
Since
they were released earlier this month, I
have been extremely disappointed by the
findings in the Inspector Generals
report on unlawful and discriminatory
hiring practices impacting veterans and
others at BPA. As a longtime advocate for
servicemembers and veterans, I know well
the incredible value that veterans bring to
the workplace, and the unacceptable
practices described in this report must be
fixed as soon as possible. I am encouraged
that BPA and DOE are each taking these
issues seriously, and as they work together
to address these problems, I will continue
monitoring the situation closely while
working to ensure that BPA maintains the
flexibility it needs to provide reliable,
low-cost power to the Pacific
Northwest.

VA, the Affordable Care Act and
You
What is the Affordable Care
Act?
The Affordable Care Act, also known as the
health care law or Obamacare, was created
to expand access to coverage, control
health care costs and improve health care
quality and care coordination. The health
care law does not change VA health benefits
or Veterans out-of-pocket costs.
3 Things You Should Know:
VA wants all veterans to receive
health care that improves their health
and well-being.
If you are enrolled in VA health
care, you do not need to take additional
steps to meet the health care law
coverage standards. The health care law
does not change VA health benefits or
Veterans out-of-pocket costs.

Veterans Enrolled in VA Health
Care

in VA health care programs have health

Family Members
VA offers health care benefits for
certain family members of Veterans through
programs such as the Civilian Health and
Medical Program of the Department of
Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) and the Spina
