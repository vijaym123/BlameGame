New Veterans Legislation to Increase Access to Local Care
This week I introduced the "Vets Health ID Act" to create a pilot
program in South Jersey that would allow our veterans to receive
medical care at local non-VA facilities if they so choose. An idea
advanced by several local advocates, the recent revelations that as
many as 40 VA medical centers are being investigated for falsifying
records, extended wait times and delaying treatments for veterans has
given a renewed push for greater local access to care at non-VA
facilities. Read my "Vets Health ID Act" here
& check out the news coverage
from the announcement in Millville
.
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
To kick off Memorial Day weekend, U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Admiral
Robert Papp Jr. joined me, freeholders, local mayors and the public at
the Cape May Convention Hall to announce his intention to designate
Cape May County as a "Coast Guard Community". A two-year effort by the
city of Cape May and County officials, the formal designation was
submitted by Admiral Papp to Congress in April and will be finalized
later this summer. Read about the prestigious designation
for Cape May County.
