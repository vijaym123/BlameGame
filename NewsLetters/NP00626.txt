Hurricane Season is here. Are
you ready?
With the beginning
of hurricane season just a few days away, now is the time for
residents in South Louisiana to make sure emergency plans are in place.
Being prepared is one of the best things you can do to protect
yourself, your family and your
business.
To help make sure you and
your family are prepared, I have put together a list of some things to
consider as you make plans for a potential hurricane landfall in your
area. As always,
my
office
is here to ensure that residents have access to the information
needed to be ready for a major
storm.
Be
Prepared
As a resident of South Louisiana it is necessary that you
prepare yourself and your
family.
Prepare an
emergency kit .
Important items to pack are medicines, non-perishable foods,
battery-powered radio, flashlights, batteries and first-aid
supplies.
Have
copies of important documents ready in a water-proof bag. Be sure to
carefully consider
which items
to include in your emergency
kit.
Make a Family Emergency Plan.
Should disaster strike your
area and your family is not all together, it is important to know how
to
contact one
another . Plan places where your
family can meet both within and outside of your immediate neighborhood or
hometown.
Inquire about emergency plans at places
where your family spends time: work, daycare and
school.
Evacuation Plan
Identify ahead of time where your family will
meet.
Identify several places you could go in an
emergency.
If you do not have a car, plan alternate means of
evacuating.
If you have a car, keep a half tank of gas in it at all times in case
you need to evacuate at a time when gas pumps are not
working.
Take your Emergency Supply
Kit.
If you have pets,
understand that many public shelters may not allow them. Plan how you will
care for your pets in an emergency .
Be
Informed
Key terms to
know during hurricane
season:
A
hurricane
watch
means a hurricane is possible in your area. Be prepared to
evacuate. Monitor local radio and television news outlets or listen to
NOAA Weather Radio
for
the latest
developments.
A
hurricane
warning
is when a hurricane is expected in your area. If local authorities
advise you to evacuate, leave immediately. For more information on
evacuation shelters and routes, click

Hurricanes are classified into
five categories based on their wind speed, central pressure and damage
potential. Category Three or higher hurricanes are considered major
hurricanes, though Category One and Two are still extremely dangerous
and warrant your full
attention.
