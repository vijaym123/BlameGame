With 72 hours left until Election Day, Democrats are in the lead in key states: North Carolina (+4), Arkansas (+1), Georgia (+2), Colorado (+1), and Iowa (+1)!
Friend -- With 72 hours left until Election Day, Democrats are in the lead in key states: North Carolina (+4), Arkansas (+1), Georgia (+2), Colorado (+1), and Iowa (+1)!
But this is troubling: the
Wall Street Journal
reports,
&ldquo;Eight states remain too close to call and, in some cases, appear to be tightening.&rdquo;
We knew we&rsquo;d have to fight for every vote to win. But with races TIGHTENING at the last minute, we&rsquo;re going to have to double down in several critical states. That means we have to send EXTRA resources and staff to stay in the game&hellip; or we risk having Republicans pull the rug out from under us at the last second.
Friend, can you help us mount the most vigorous Get Out The Vote effort EVER? Your gift will be triple-matched and sent immediately to deadlocked battlegrounds.

Or donate another amount.
The
Wall Street Journal
warns, &ldquo;These down-to-the-wire contests inject added uncertainty into the final days of the midterm campaigns as both sides scramble to turn out the vote. The narrow margins in many races leave open the possibility of [any outcome].&rdquo;
So we&rsquo;re not exaggerating:
what you do right now could make or break this entire election.
It could be the difference between ousting Mitch McConnell and keeping the Senate blue&hellip; OR two or more years of a McConnell-led, obstructionist disaster.
Pitch in TODAY and we&rsquo;ll triple-match your gift. It&rsquo;ll go directly to key battleground states to help get out the vote and WIN this election!
We&rsquo;re counting on you.
