The health of our veterans
Dear Friend,
We reached an important milestone this week in our ongoing effort to improve the quality of life for the men and women who defend our freedoms. Yesterday, I had the privilege of attending the
White House bill signing ceremony
for the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, bipartisan legislation I co-authored to expand access to mental health care for our military personnel and veterans.
Military families across our nation are coping with unimaginable grief after the loss of a loved one to suicide. This bill makes it far easier for returning servicemen and women to get the care they need, including valuable peer-to-peer support, and it makes provisions to grow the ranks of mental health professionals working within the VA and DOD. Having lost some of my own troopers to suicide, it was a tremendous honor for me to advance this legislation and look on as the President signed it into law.
The legislation is named for Marine Corporal Clay Hunt , who was awarded the Purple Heart in Iraq and deployed to Afghanistan. He was diagnosed with PTSD but faced serious delays as he sought treatment from a psychiatrist.
In 2011, Corporal Hunt took his own life at the age of 28.
More than 20 veterans commit suicide each day. These are unbearable tragedies for our communities, and we have an obligation to see that our current and former military personnel have easy access to the support they need. Last year, we enacted sweeping reforms of the VA health system, including legislation that gives veterans living far from VA clinics the option of being treated by local doctors.
I have been disappointed with the initial implementation of these changes by the VA, and I encourage anyone having difficulties with the system to contact our district offices for assistance. We will continue to work with the administration and committees in Congress to see that the VA fully complies with and meets the intent of the legislationto reduce the backlog and provide quality care in a timely manner.
In other VA-related news this week, we re-introduced a bill I wrote called the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act with more than 125 bipartisan co-sponsors.
This constituent-driven legislation
gives presumptive Agent Orange exposure status to hundreds of sailors who served aboard ships off the coast of Vietnam.
A toxic chemical in Agent Orange is linked to non-Hodgkins lymphoma, type 2 diabetes, various cancers, and Parkinsons disease. For too long Navy veterans exposed to this chemical by their shipboard desalination systems have been denied the VA benefits they deserve. I am hopeful this bill will also be signed into law this Congress.
Again, if you or your loved one is having difficulty with a federal agency, please contact me. I also invite you to stop and visit with me during my travels across the Hudson Valley and Catskills. This weekend, Ill be at the WSUL-WVOS Heart-a-thon in Rock Hill and events in Kinderhook, Oneonta, and Pittstown.
At 6 p.m. Friday, February 20, Ill be speaking at my alma mater, Ichabod Crane High School, to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the death of President Lincoln and the passage of his funeral train through Columbia County. This talk is part of a series of Lincoln events to be held in the coming weeks around the area. I encourage you to join me as we explore the impact of this great President.
This Presidents Day weekend, please take a moment to pray for our troops and their families, especially those who are struggling with the mental anguish of war and the absence of loved ones. Take care in this cold!
Sincerely,
Chris Gibson
Member of Congress
