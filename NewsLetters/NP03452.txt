After the November elections, Republicans now control both the House and the Senate. Ill be championing progressive ideas and standing up for our President when hes attacked indiscriminately by the right, but I will also find ways to work with Republicans on legislation like I did in the 113th Congress
including issues such as police militarization and consumer fairness.
At home, I will continue working on behalf of my constituents
doing everything I can to empower, educate and enlighten citizens; and help them when they have an issue with a federal agency.
On that note, I wanted to make sure constituents who receive their health insurance through the Marketplaces are aware of the available resources.
In preparation for the 2015 tax filing season, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Treasury Department are putting together resources to provide tax filers with the information they need to get their questions answered.
In the coming weeks, consumer-friendly tools and resources will be made available for those tax filers who have health coverage through the Marketplaces, those seeking an exemption, and those without health insurance.
Tips About Marketplace Coverage

Dear
F riends,
I hope everyone had a joyful and safe holiday season. The 114th Congress is already underway, and I am preparing to introduce legislation that helps level the playing field for consumers and ensures that our justice system is fair for everyone
not just the wealthy and well connected.
