Friends,
I know youre fed up with
the news coming out of Washington.
From unilateral executive
actions, to costly and inefficient regulations, it seems government
bureaucrats are more focused on pushing their own agendas than working
together to focus on your priorities. While so many Americans today
are still struggling to find work and make ends meet, Washington seems
intent on making things harder for you instead of easier.
In
times like this, we need
solutions.
I have good news to share from Washington.
Im
excited to
announce
that my bill to cut taxes on air
travelers unanimously passed the Senate this week
making it my first
bill to pass the U.S. Congress!
Now, this important,
commonsense piece of legislation heads to the Presidents desk and will soon
become law. While this issue hasnt gained widespread attention, it is
an issue that truly matters to air travelers and directly affects
American taxpayers wallets. Im proud that I played a role in lowering
the cost of air travel for everyone, especially since were in the
middle of folks traveling near and far to visit loved ones during the
holidays.
Rolling back fees
and reducing taxes on airline passengers benefits everyone
from
helping families save money when traveling on vacation, to cutting costs for
small businesses whose employees travel for work.
When
I first heard that the Transportation Security Agency (TSA) was
charging folks an extra fee for every flight they took, I immediately went
to work on building a bipartisan consensus about how we could roll
back this unfair and unnecessary
fee.
I know that every extra dollar spent on more fees and taxes adds up.
Instead of handing over even more of your hard-earned money to
travel, you can save more. Not only will it have a tremendous impact on your
wallet, this legislation will lead to more frequent trips, increased
tourism and more dollars invested in our local
economies.
While this is a small step in the grand
scheme of things,
I hope that its a model we can follow on some of
the bigger issues facing our country.
Folks across the
country are thirsting for politicians to put aside petty differences
and get our country moving in the right direction again. As we move
into a new year and a new Congress, I remain committed to doing just
that. I didnt come to Washington to merely vote yes or no on legislation.
I came to Washington to roll up my sleeves, be an advocate
for issues important to you, and ensure that polices are put in place to
make life better for folks in North
Carolina.
Until next
week,
Richard
