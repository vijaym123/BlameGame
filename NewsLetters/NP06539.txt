Photo of the
Week:
This
week I attended the swearing-in ceremony for the new Chief Justice of the
NC Supreme Court, Mark Martin - a historic event for North Carolina
and
Republicans.
I hope you enjoyed the Labor Day holiday last week as we
celebrated our dedicated American workforce.
It was an honor to
witness the swearing-in ceremony for N.C. Supreme Court Justice Mark
Martin this week in Raleigh. This was a historic event and a great
opportunity for me to talk with many of our state officials and leaders
who were also in attendance. I have included several photos from the
event in this newsletter (both above and below), and you can find more on
my Facebook page
and in
this
article in The News &amp; Observer .
Over the past two
weeks we have seen the culmination of Obamas refusal to provide
leadership with regard to the terrorist organization called ISIS. We have
heard the president tell the world "we don't have a strategy yet" to
combat the Islamic terrorist group ISIS (or ISIL), even though
it has been reported
that the president has received
detailed intelligence briefings about the rise of ISIS for more than a
year. Then, we heard
the president's top spokesman
say
the U.S. is not at war with ISIS even though the White House had
previously labeled the group an "imminent threat to every interest we
have." And most recently, after ISIS brutally murdered a second American
journalist, the president said
the threat from ISIS
can become a "manageable problem"
if the international community
comes together. Americans want leadership, but so far our president
has failed to provide any.
It was great to be in the district
the past few weeks throughout the month of August, as it allowed for
me to meet with so many constituents, tour our local businesses and
hospitals, and host a community discussion about mental health reform.
I've included photos from the past few weeks below so you can see some
of the work I've done here at home. Next week, I'll be back in our
nation's capital when Congress is back in session.
Please
contact my Asheboro, Dunn or D.C. staff if you have any concerns or
questions or if you need help with a federal agency. We are happy to help
you however we can!
Installation Ceremony for Chief
Justice Martin:
Congratulations to new NC Supreme Court Chief Justice Mark
Martin.
The
swearing-in ceremony for Chief Justice Martin gave me an opportunity
to talk with many NC state officials and leaders also in attendance.
See additional photos from the swearing-in ceremony online
on the
News &amp; Observer
website .
Recapping August in the
District:
The photos below are just a few snapshots from some of my work
in the district during the August congressional recess:
Rep. Tim
Murphy and I met with News &amp; Observer editors and reporters to
discuss H.R. 3717 and the need for mental health
reform.
We hosted our
successful Third Annual Recruit-a-Vet Employment Fair on August 13th.
Business representatives had the opportunity to meet with veterans,
answer questions, accept resumes and interview applicants during the
fair.
While I was home in August, I met with doctors and medical
experts at the Fayetteville VA Medical Center and discussed ways we can
better assist and support our
veterans.
Thomas
Built Buses in Randolph County is one of the businesses I visited and
toured in the second district during the August recess. It was great
to see how businesses in the second district are helping our local and
national
economy.
Rep. Tim
Murphy and I
listened to
first-hand accounts from family members, law enforcement, healthcare providers,
veterans and military representatives during
the mental health
roundtable I hosted at Fayetteville Tech in August. I am a cosponsor
of Congressman Murphy's bill, H.R. 3717, the Helping Families in Mental
Health Crisis Act.
