Rep. Bruce Braley -- Iowa's First
District
David,
Veterans Day is a day to honor and commemorate the brave men and women
who have put their lives on the line for our country.
We are grateful for their sacrifice, service and their commitment to
keeping America strong and secure.
Today is also a reminder of the services that our veterans are owed
when they return home. They risked their lives to keep us safe - it's
now our responsibility to lend them a helping hand.
Bruce Braley thanks veterans at the WWII Memorial in Washington
DC
All my best to you and your family on this Veterans Day.
