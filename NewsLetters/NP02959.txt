Holding Gov't Accountable
Dear Friend,
Unfortunately, 2014 was not a great year for government accountability. From the Internal Revenue Service targeting of conservative groups, uncovering a dysfunctional Veterans Administration, and the truth about Obamacare coming from one of the laws chief architects
- there is no doubt we have a lot of work to do.
House Republicans and the committee that I chair, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, have made government accountability a top priority. We need to ensure that the government works for the people
not for Washington, D.C.
Through public hearings, letters to agencies, official committee reports and more
the Energy and Commerce Committee continues to hold the federal government accountable to the people.
Last Congress, our committee held tough oversight hearings on everything from the new Environmental Protection Agencys proposed carbon and power plant rules, the Centers for Disease Controls safety lapses involving anthrax and the Ebola outbreak, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration delay in recalling airbags and ignition switches.
Its not enough to demand accountability
we must practice it as well. My 21 st
Century Cures initiative, for example, has been a uniquely transparent process. Weve shown Washington how to do things a bit differently and deliver hope to the American people. Weve had an open and transparent process from the very beginning, and as a result, the discussion draft of our bill, released last week, had several ideas in it submitted by regular folks from around the country.
Thoughtful oversight has been
and will remain
a priority of my office and of the Energy and Commerce Committee.
