Dear Neighbors,
Our district has the third-highest concentration of manufacturing jobs
in the entire country. That translates to nearly 100,000 people working
in manufacturing businesses, large and small. These jobs are not the
old smokestack, Rust-Belt jobs of the last century, but the new,
high-tech, 21st Century, advanced manufacturing jobs driving today's
economy.
With this growth comes increasing need for innovative and skilled
manufacturing workers. This need requires a strategic commitment to
developing a well-trained, capable workforce.
Two local programs working to boost manufacturing caught my eye, and I
wanted to share them with you.
Recently, I joined members of the
Veterans Rapid Employment Initiative (VREI), a local program connecting
recently-discharged veterans with manufacturing careers, during a tour
of a Des Plaines-based manufacturer. Connecting veterans with
manufacturing is a win-win proposition. It expands career opportunities
for our veterans, whose unique and technical skills ideally suit them
to fill skilled positions, and helps drive the next generation of
manufacturing growth.
I also participated in the Wheeling Manufacturing Conference at
Wheeling High School. This school is home to some of the most exciting
educational and industry cooperation in the country. From the high
school's new nanotechnology lab that I visited with Education Secretary
Arne Duncan in October to its manufacturing center and the village's
commitment to business and manufacturing development, Wheeling is a
national model for integrating economic, educational and municipal
strengths.
Both of these programs further highlight the need to address our
growing skills gap and ensure manufacturers can hire the skilled
workers they need to compete in the 21st Century. Legislation such as
the AMERICA Works Act and LEARN Act-both bills I introduced-seeks to
bridge that gap, and with more partnerships and initiatives like the
VREI and Wheeling Manufacturing Conference, I am confident the Tenth
District will lead the way in innovative manufacturing for a new
century.
Thank you,
Brad Schneider

Dear
Neighbors,
Our
district
has
the
third-highest
concentration
of
manufacturing
jobs in
the
entire
country.
That
translates
to
nearly
100,000
people
working
in manufacturing
businesses,
large
and
small. These
jobs
are not
the
old
smokestack,
Rust-Belt jobs
of
the
last
century,
but
the
new,
high-tech,
21st
Century,
advanced manufacturing
jobs driving
today&#8217;s
economy.
With
this
growth
comes increasing
need
for
innovative
and
skilled
manufacturing
workers.
This
need
requires
a
strategic
commitment
to
developing
a
well-trained,
capable
workforce.
Two
local
programs
working
to
boost
manufacturing
caught
my
eye,
and
I
wanted
to
share
them
with
you.
Recently,
I
joined
members
of
the
Veterans
Rapid
Employment
Initiative
(VREI),
a
local
program
connecting
recently-discharged
veterans
with
manufacturing
careers,
during
a
tour
of
a
Des
Plaines-based
manufacturer.
Connecting
veterans
with
manufacturing
is
a
win-win
proposition.
It
expands
career
opportunities
for
our
veterans,
whose
unique
and
technical
skills
ideally
suit
them
to
fill
skilled
positions,
and
helps
drive
the
next
generation
of
manufacturing
growth.
I
also
participated
in
the
Wheeling
Manufacturing
Conference
at
Wheeling
High
School.
This
school
is
home
to
some
of
the
most
exciting
educational
and
industry
cooperation
in
the
country.
From
the
high

that I
visited
with
Education

Arne

to
its

village's

to
business
and
manufacturing

Wheeling
is
a
national

for
integrating

Both
of
these
programs
further
highlight
the
need
to
address
our
growing
skills
gap
and
ensure
manufacturers
can
hire
the
skilled
workers
they
need
to
compete
in
the
21st

Legislation
such
as
the
AMERICA

and

to
bridge
that
gap,
and
with
more
partnerships
and

like
the
VREI
and
Wheeling
Manufacturing
Conference,
I
am
confident
the
Tenth
District
will
lead
the
way
in
innovative
manufacturing
for
a
new
century.
