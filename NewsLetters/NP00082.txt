Taking
Necessary Steps Toward A Viable, Reliable
Health Care System
Dear Friend,
Since its implementation, the
Presidents healthcare law has time
and again harmed, rather than helped, the
overwhelming majority of Americans. The
policies put forth in Washington have real,
painful effects on Fifth District
Virginians, and I am committed to repealing
this law and replacing it with market-based
solutions to lower costs and improve access
to quality healthcare for all
Americans.
The Presidents healthcare law
contains a wide variety of harmful
provisions, including more than a dozen tax
increases. Last Thursday, the House passed
the Protect Medical Innovation Act
to
repeal one such tax increase
within the
Presidents healthcare law
the medical device tax. The tax was imposed
on medical devices that range
from
dentures to pacemakers to MRI machines.
These devices not only save lives and
improve patients health, but the
makers of these items employ hundreds of
thousands of Americans. Imposing an
additional tax hinders those jobs,
innovation, and patient care. I was proud
to cosponsor this legislation and see it
pass
the House with wide bipartisan support .
It is my hope that the Senate joins us in
passing this legislation to send it to the
Presidents desk.
This week, I will join my colleagues in
the House to mitigate yet another harmful
portion of the Presidents healthcare
law. The Independent Payment Advisory Board
(IPAB) is a panel of
fifteen
unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats
that will be given a staggering amount of
control over the care Medicare patients
receive. The law grants these individuals
substantial authority to slash Medicare
payments to providers or eliminate payments
for certain treatments and procedures
altogether. Congress should instead be
making such significant decisions about the
services Medicare patients receive - not a
panel of unelected appointees that cannot
be held accountable by the American public.
The IPAB is just another example in the
healthcare law that reinforces the
fundamental difference between this
Administrations view that Washington
knows best and my view that the American
people that know best.
These two bills are small steps in the
right direction toward protecting the
people from the negative impacts of this
fundamentally flawed law. But much more
must be done to reverse all the harm this
law has created by massively expanding the
size, scope, and reach of the federal
government into such personal matters. We
have to implement real healthcare reform
that actually reduces the cost of care,
premiums, and deductibles and does not
separate patients from their doctors. I
remain committed to reforms that are
patient-centered and market-oriented to
deliver the healthcare system the American
people deserve.
