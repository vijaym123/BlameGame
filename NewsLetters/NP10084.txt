Friends,
I am not sure if you had the opportunity to see
yesterdays newsletter, but I would like to clarify the five percent cut I
proposed.
The proposed cut
would apply to non-defense discretionary spending
only.
The other three spending levels (defense, mandatory, and interest)
would be exempt.
The five percent cut would have no impact on
South Carolinians' Social Security, Medicare, or
Medicaid.
Feel free to call my offices with any questions you may have about my
proposed spending cuts or email me
HERE .
Have
a good week,
