Dear friend,
I wanted to
give you a quick update on what Ive been up to in
Idaho.
On Valentines Day, my wife Becca and I had the privilege of
going to the Boise VA Medical Center, where we visited patients, delivered
handmade valentines to our veterans, and thanked them for their
service.
The best part of my job is thanking Idahos veterans for
their service and sacrifice, and to do that on Valentines Day made it
even more special.
This Monday, I co-hosted a reception with Senators Mike Crapo and
Jim Risch to congratulate this years Service Academy nominees from
Idahos First District. These 32 capable young Idahoans deserve our
full support as they take this next step in serving our country.
If
you know a young Idahoan who would be like to be considered for next
years nominations, just go to my webpage

Later in the week, I stood side-by-side with Senators
Crapo and Risch for another press event
a press conference in which
we were joined by U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell and Idahos
Second District Congressman, Mike Simpson.
Our focus at the press
conference was improving federal land management in Idaho
specifically, dealing with the growing threat of catastrophic wildfires on
federal lands
lands which cover 63 percent of our state.
As we all know, Idaho has suffered too
many catastrophic wildfires in recent years, and many of those
wildfires would have been preventable if better policies had been in
place.
Thats why the entire Idaho Delegation is united behind a new
bill, the
Wildfire Disaster Funding
Act.
This bill would make common sense changes to the federal
wildfire budget, ending the destructive cycle of robbing the Forest
Services non-fire accounts in order to pay for wildfire suppression when
costs exceed the agencys wildfire budget.
Our bill doesnt add a
single dime in federal spending; it simply ensures that discretionary
funding is spent in the most effective way possible - managing forests
in order to prevent wildfires, not on suppressing them.
Im
pleased that our delegation is united behind this smart, bipartisan
bill.
When meeting with collaborative groups from across the
state, I also spoke about the need to reform programs like PILT and
Secure Rural Schools (SRS).
So long as SRS and PILT are tied to
federal policies that prevent Idahos rural communities from developing
their own land in a way that would create more jobs and generate more tax
revenue, they are band-aids, not a real
solution.
Last September, the House passed my bill, the
Self-Sufficient Community Lands Act , as part of a larger bill to
empower Idahos rural communities to manage part of their own
land.
Now were just waiting for action in the Senate.
During the past week, I also kept busy with a variety of
activities
speaking at the ribbon-cutting of the Zions Bank Building (which
is now the tallest building in Boise); attending the Idaho
Association of Commerce and Industry (IACI) Board Meeting; and meeting with
members of the Western Timber Industry and the Trade Benefits America
Coalition.
I called into the KBOI Morning Show and met with a few
print reporters throughout the week.
Now that Ive come to
the end of a very busy and exciting week, I just want to thank you again
for the honor of serving you in Congress.
I remain grateful for
your trust and confidence.
