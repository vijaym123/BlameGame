Dear Friend,
I hope you're taking some
time this Independence Day to really celebrate everything we have in
this country.
We spend a lot of time talking about our
differences and the challenges we face, but July 4th is a special reminder
each year that as a country, we've overcome unbeatable
odds.
This is the day we celebrate the bravery of those Americans in the
18th century who endeavored to start this American Experiment.
It's a day we celebrate the generations since then who have participated
and sustained that experiment simply by living their lives, raising
families, working hard, and defending their freedom.
No
matter what's in the headlines today, we still have reasons to celebrate.
Enjoy your Independence Day!
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of
Congress
