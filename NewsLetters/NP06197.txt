&ldquo;Senate Republicans Can Taste Majority&rdquo; -
The Hill , 9/11/2014
Dear Friend, Members of the GOP are telling the press that they&rsquo;re confident they&rsquo;ll take over the Senate this fall.
They&rsquo;re seeing national pollsters&rsquo; predictions, and they&rsquo;re starting to get cocky.
Pride goes before a fall, and if the Republicans want to sit back and count their chickens before they hatch, that&rsquo;s fine with me. We&rsquo;re going to keep organizing in the meantime. We&rsquo;re closing in on our $145,000 goal for September. Please, if you&rsquo;re able, give $5 to help us hit our target before the FEC deadline on the 30th.

During their time in the minority, the Republicans have succeeded in derailing progress for the middle class. They&rsquo;ve blocked a federal minimum wage increase, they&rsquo;ve blocked proposals to roll back
Citizens United , and they&rsquo;ve blocked attempts to mandate equal pay for equal work.
If you want a sneak peek at what a Republican Senate would be like, look no further than the Tea Party-led House and their proposal to end Medicare as we know it. This is what the GOP wants, and if they win this November, they just might get it. We need to defend Massachusetts&rsquo; Senate seat from the GOP onslaught. Help us out with a $5 contribution.
Thanks,
Ed
