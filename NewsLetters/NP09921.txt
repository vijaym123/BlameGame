Working to
Put Forth Pro-Growth Policies That Will
Stimulate Our Fragile Economy
Dear Friend,
Since being elected to Congress, my top
priority has always been adopting policies
that will lead to the creation of private
sector jobs for the hardworking individuals
and families of Virginias Fifth
District. With the unemployment rate in
many Central and Southside Virginia
localities still exceeding the national
rate, government-created obstacles to
economic growth are unacceptable. My
colleagues in the House and I have passed
numerous pieces of legislation as a part of
our agenda to improve the environment for
job creation; however, our bills remain
stuck in the U.S. Senate, awaiting
action.
While I am encouraged that
Fridays monthly jobs report found
that our economy added jobs last month, we
also saw a number of discouraging economic
indicators last week. The jobs report shows
that over 800,000 people dropped out of our
labor force in April, reducing the labor
force participation rate to a 35-year low
of 62.8%. We learned that our GDP grew by a
sluggish 0.1% in the first quarter of 2014,
and a new study came out finding that China
is poised to overtake the United States as
the worlds largest economy, a
position the U.S. has held since 1872.
The bottom line is that our rate of
recovery from the economic downturn is well
below where it should be, and Fifth
District families are suffering as a
consequence of our lackluster economy. As I
travel across the Fifth District, I hear
from family farmers, community bankers, and
business leaders that the excessive
government red tape and overregulation
coming out of Washington are hurting them
and stifling their ability to grow. We need
to free our Main Street businesses from the
burdens of unnecessary government
regulations so they can succeed and
generate the jobs we need to uplift our
struggling economy. We need pro-growth
policies that entrust our private sector
businesses to be the drivers of our
economy, and not the federal government.
This continues to be our priority in the
House, but in order to see the action we so
desperately need, the Senate and the
Administration must also work with us. We
in the House have sent 238 pro-growth
bills, including two bills that I authored,
to the Senate that would help kick-start
our economy, but the Senate must act in
order to turn our economic fate around.
I look forward to continuing to work
with my colleagues in this effort so that
we may pave the way for our small
businesses and family farms to create
much-needed jobs and stimulate economic
growth.
