Dear David,
As we mark Military
Appreciation Month, please join me in thanking our nation's courageous military
veterans, active duty servicemen and women, and their families for
their commitment and dedication to keep our country
safe.
There are more than 26,000 active duty servicemembers and 480,000 veterans
currently living in Missouri, and I'm always honored to meet these
brave men and women as I travel through our state or through Honor
Flight programs in Washington, D.C.
Our nation's military heroes
deserve our thanks this month and every month, and we can never stop
finding ways to improve the quality of life for our troops and their
families who are deployed here and around the world.
I
hope you'll join me in honoring our veterans this month during Military
Appreciation Month. As always, I invite you to join the conversation
online by sharing your thoughts with me on
Facebook ,
Twitter , on
Instagram ,
and by subscribing to my
YouTube
channel.
Sincere regards,
