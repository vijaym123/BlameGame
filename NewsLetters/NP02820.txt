Wicker Presides Over National Prayer
Breakfast
63rd Annual Event Celebrates Faith and
Fellowship
Each year, the
National Prayer Breakfast is one of the most memorable events in our
nation's capital.
Drawing thousands of people from across the
country and all over the world, it is a moment for giving thanks and
celebrating God's glory in our
lives.
On February 5, I had the honor of serving as co-chairman of this
year's National Prayer Breakfast.
I presided with my colleague
Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), who has served with me over the past two years
as co-chairman of the Senate Prayer Breakfast.
The National Prayer Breakfast is an extension of
the prayer breakfasts that meet each week in the House of
Representatives and the Senate.
Like these smaller gatherings, it encourages
people of different backgrounds, political ideologies, and faith
traditions to come together in the spirit of religious fellowship.
I was pleased to welcome several
Mississippians to take part, including Miss Mississippi Jasmine Murray,
who performed "His Eye Is on the Sparrow."
The popular Lane
Chapel Quintet from Tupelo was also on hand to provide entertainment at
one of the widely attended National Prayer Breakfast dinners.
Darrell Waltrip Offers Keynote
Address
More than 3,600 people gathered for the 2015
National Prayer Breakfast, including the President, who participates
every year.
Every U.S. president, in fact, has attended the event
since the breakfast began in 1953.
The program of hymns, prayers,
and Scripture readings also includes a keynote address from a guest
speaker.
This year's
keynote was delivered by legendary NASCAR driver Darrell Waltrip, who spoke
from the heart about his own journey of faith and the constant
spiritual encouragement of his wife, Stevie.
Although he joked he was
not running for political office, he said, "I am running to something.
The Lord is a strong tower.
The righteous will run to it
and be safe."
Ebola Survivor Prays for World
Leaders
In many ways, the
National Prayer Breakfast underscores this message, calling on God to watch
over all of his children.
In his prayer for world leaders, Dr.
Kent Brantly, one of the Ebola fighters who survived the disease,
offered these words:
"Bless the leaders of the nations, Father, that
they might act justly, and love mercy, and walk humbly with
you."
Such blessings are certainly
needed in times of great challenge.
Today's airwaves are dominated
by news reports of terrorists committing violent acts and persecuting
religious minorities for what they believe.
The outpouring of
goodwill and tolerance at the National Prayer Breakfast reaffirms the
solidarity of faith that exists in the face of great evil.
The
United States has always stood for religious liberty and should continue
to do so, particularly in light of recent events in Europe and the
Middle East.
We are blessed
to live in a country that upholds every citizen's freedom to pray and
worship as he or she chooses.
Events like the National Prayer
Breakfast would not be possible in many parts of the world.
I am
thankful for my experience in helping plan this year's inspirational
event.
As Scripture says, "For where two or three are gathered
together in my name, there am I in the midst of them."
