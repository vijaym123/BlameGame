Dear Friend &ndash;
Throughout my tenure in Congress and as a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, I have fought to ensure our nation&rsquo;s veterans get the benefits they deserve once they return home.
This Saturday, I am proud to host my 11th Annual Orange County Veterans&rsquo; Fair featuring employment assistance, free health screenings, housing resources and the VA mobile health bus.
WHAT: 11th Annual Orange County Veterans&rsquo; Fair in Garden Grove
WHEN: 9:00am - 1:00pm Saturday, July 12, 2014
WHERE: Garden Grove Elks Lodge, 11551 Trask Ave, Garden Grove, 92843
For more details or any questions you may have, please call my Garden Grove office at (714) 621-0102.
Very Truly Yours,
Loretta Sanchez
Member of Congress
