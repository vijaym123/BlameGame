Four Years
Later, Dodd Franks Impacts
Continue to Hamper Main Streets
Dear Friend,
Four years ago, President Obama signed
the
Dodd Frank Act , which was intended to
address the underlying issues that led to
the financial crisis and create a safer
financial system. Instead, this 2,300 page
law, which establishes 400 new government
regulations, has led to disproportionately
negative impacts and costs for community
banks, small businesses, and consumers,
while doing little to tackle the issues
that truly drove the crisis.
Proponents of the Dodd-Frank Act billed
it as a means of ending the idea of
too big to fail financial
institutions that have the potential to
wreak havoc on our economy. And yet, the
Dodd-Frank Act does the opposite by
officially designating many large companies
as too big to fail and
allocating taxpayer resources to these
entities should they become insolvent.
Giving these companies advantages over
others in the market is terrible economic
policy because it distorts market
discipline and permits unnecessary risks
that could lead to more taxpayer-funded
bailouts.
Dodd-Frank was also intended to rein in
bad actors on Wall Street, but since its
passage, we have seen that it is
disproportionately harming small Main
Street banks, credit unions, and their
customers by imposing one-size-fits-all
regulatory schemes on community financial
institutions. These regulatory impacts
represent real costs and eliminate choices
for consumers
both families and
small businesses
on Main Streets
from Chatham to Warrenton. The House has
worked in a bipartisan way over the last
four years to adopt numerous bipartisan
measures to mitigate the impacts on Dodd
Frank regulations on community lenders;
however, the Senate has failed to act on
almost every one.
For all of Dodd Frank's regulations, it
also failed to address one of the leading
causes of the financial crisis - Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac. Almost six years after the
financial crisis, these government
sponsored enterprises continue to elude
reform, putting taxpayers at risk for
hundreds of billions of dollars in future
bailouts.
As a member of the Financial Services
Committee, I have worked with my colleagues
extensively to examine how the actions
taken by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have
caused boom-bust cycles in the housing
market, contributed to the 2008 financial
crisis, and forced hardworking taxpayers to
bail out the Government-Sponsored
Enterprises (GSEs) at a cost of almost $200
billion. That is why House Republicans
introduced the Protecting American
Taxpayers and Homeowners (PATH) Act, a plan
designed to protect homeowners and
taxpayers by ending taxpayer-funded
bailouts of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and
freeing Americas housing markets
from government distortion by implementing
these reforms and increasing private sector
participation in housing finance will
increase competition, enhance transparency,
and maximize consumer choice, making for a
stronger and more sustainable system.
This week, the Financial Services
Committee will hold a hearing to assess the
impact of the Dodd-Frank Act four years
after its implementation and demand
accountability for the costs that are
impacting our small businesses and
families. I look forward to this
weeks hearing, which will focus on
what we can be doing to implement more
commonsense and effective policies to
eliminate the burdens holding our economy
back and get our fiscal house in order.
