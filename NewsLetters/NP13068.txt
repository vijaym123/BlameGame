7th DISTRICT
January 16, 2014
Dear
Friend,
For the first time in nearly five years, Congress enacted
a budget setting a financial framework for the next two years.
Congress also passed an appropriations measure to fund our federal
government within that budget.
While I have differences with both
the budget and the omnibus appropriations, without those measures the
entire federal government flounders. In fact, without a budget and
appropriation, Congress must pass continuing resolutions that end up
spending more money and turns priorities for funding over to the
Administration and unelected bureaucrats.
The biggest benefit to
our 7 th
Congressional District with the passage of the
budget and appropriations bills is the stability in defense simulation
jobs. Central Florida would have been devastated if Congress did not
act.
Some of the other
positive impacts of the budget and appropriations measures
include:
Reduction
in federal spending of over $21 billion over the previous
year
Lowest
discretionary spending since
2009
Reduced discretionary spending by $165 billion
since 2010
Prevents arbitrary cuts instituted by sequestration that would cut our
military and harm our national
security
Includes a military retiree pension
fix to ensure medically retired personnel and survivors are
compensated
