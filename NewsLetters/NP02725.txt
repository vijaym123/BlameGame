An American Opportunity Agenda
In the first six weeks of the year the House has passed 42 bills, and all but one of them has received bipartisan support. We have passed bipartisan bills to provide tax relief for families and small businesses, create more job opportunities for veterans, stop the negative consequences of the President's health care law, combat human trafficking, and more. Although President Obama has threatened to veto many of these bills, we will continue working on this positive agenda to promote opportunity for everyone.
