Update from Congressman Scott Tipton
Dear Friend,
The American Dream has come at an incredible cost. Since the founding
of our nation, a small, important group of Americans have answered the
call to serve our country. Because of the sacrifice of these special
few Americans, we can wholeheartedly say that the world is a better
place.
On Memorial Day, we come together as a nation to give tribute to those
who paid the ultimate price in defense of freedom-in defense of that
Dream.
No words can sufficiently express the gratitude we have for our
troops, especially for those who have died in the service of our
nation.
These brave, selfless individuals share a sacred bond. It's an
immortal, patriotic bond that lives among their ranks from generation
to generation. It lives on today between veterans and their fallen
peers-between those who have stood together in defense of us all.
I believe that one of the best ways we as a nation can honor these
fallen heroes is to stand up for their brothers and sisters in arms and
fix the problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
The way that veterans have been treated by the VA is an outrage and a
failure by our government to honor its commitment. Across the nation,
nearly 350,000 veterans who have filed disability claims with the VA
are waiting longer than 125 days to receive their benefits.
It is
beyond troubling that ailing vets have been forced to wait ridiculous
amounts of time to receive the care they were promised, enduring
additional pain and suffering and even losing their lives.
The problems at the VA are systemic, and without necessary reforms and
changes will never be fully fixed.
It defies logic that under the current system, when a senior executive
at the VA fails to do their job, they are more likely to be rewarded
and promoted than fired. This week the House passed legislation (H.R.
4031) to stop this mind-boggling practice by empowering the Secretary
with greater flexibility to fire senior executive staff members that
fail to do their jobs. This bill is a needed step in the right
direction to help bring about accountability at the VA.
When those who are supposed to be helping our vets at the VA fail to do
their jobs, they need to be fired.
We've heard countless stories from veterans in our district that have
experienced delays, cancelations or a lack of response all together at
the VA. Matters are made even worse when a veteran has to drive several
hours while ill to get to their appointment, only to find out when they
arrive that it had been canceled without any notice given. This is
happening here in the 3rd District and across the nation, and it has to
stop.
There is a solution to help address the VA's healthcare delivery
challenges. I am working to advance legislation with my rural
colleagues to allow veterans to access healthcare in their own
backyard, rather than having to travel to regional VA facilities,
sometimes at great distances.
The Healthy Vets Act (H.R. 635) would clear hurdles blocking veterans
from accessing local care providers. I believe this solution would help
ease the strain on regional VA facilities, improve appointment times,
and ensure that veterans are able to access the care they need, when
and where they need it.
This commonsense solution, based on the premise that veterans-regardless
of whether they live in rural or urban areas-should be able to access
their benefits in a way that works for them, deserves greater attention.
Let's remember the promise this nation made to those who have served.
We must work to deliver that promise by ensuring our veterans receive
the benefits and care they and their fallen brothers and sisters in
arms earned.
If you are having an issue with a VA claim, my office may be able to
help and can be reached at 719-542-1073.
Sincerely,
In Case You Missed It

Members of the House, Senate introduce legislation to protect sage
grouse: Congressman Tipton joined several of his Western colleagues to
introduce the Sage Grouse Protection and Conservation Act. This
legislation would prevent the Sage grouse from being listed under the
Endangered Species Act for 10 years, and instead requires states to
develop conservation management plans to meet the unique needs of the
Sage grouse in each state. Read more

Update
from
Congressman
Scott
Tipton
Dear
Friend,
The
American
Dream
has
come
at
an
incredible
cost.
Since
the
founding
of
our
nation,
a
small,
important
group
of
Americans
have
answered
the
call
to
serve
our
country.
Because
of
the
sacrifice
of
these
special
few
Americans,
we
can
wholeheartedly
say
that
the
world
is
a
better
place.
On
Memorial
Day,
we
come
together
as
a
nation
to
give
tribute
to
those
who
paid
the
ultimate
price
in
defense
of
freedom&#8212;in
defense
of
that
Dream.
No
words
can
sufficiently
express
the
gratitude
we
have
for
our
troops,
especially
for
those
who
have
died
in
the
service
of
our
nation.
These
brave,
selfless
individuals
share
a
sacred
bond.
It&#8217;s
an
immortal,
patriotic
bond
that
lives
among
their
ranks
from
generation
to
generation.
It
lives
on
today
between
veterans
and
their
fallen
peers&#8212;between
those
who
have
stood
together
in
defense
of
us
all.
I
believe
that
one
of
the
best
ways
we
as
a
nation
can
honor
these
fallen
heroes
is
to
stand
up
for
their
brothers
and
sisters
in
arms
and
fix
the
problems
at
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA).
The
way
that
veterans
have
been
treated
by
the
VA
is
an
outrage
and
a
failure
by
our
government
to
honor
its
commitment.
Across
the
nation,
nearly
350,000
veterans
who
have
filed
disability
claims
with
the
VA
are
waiting
longer
than
125
days
to
receive
their
benefits.
It
is
beyond
troubling
that
ailing
vets
have
been
forced
to
wait
ridiculous
amounts
of
time
to
receive
the
care
they
were
promised,
enduring
additional
pain
and
suffering
and
even
losing
their
lives.
The
problems
at
the
VA
are
systemic,
and
without
necessary
reforms
and
changes
will
never
be
fully
fixed.
It
defies
logic
that
under
the
current
system,
when
a
senior
executive
at
the
VA
fails
to
do
their
job,
they
are
more
likely
to
be
rewarded
and
promoted
than
fired.
This
week
the
House
passed
legislation
(H.R.
4031)
to
stop
this
mind-boggling
practice
by
empowering
the
Secretary
with
greater
flexibility
to
fire
senior
executive
staff
members
that
fail
to
do
their
jobs.
This
bill
is
a
needed
step
in
the
right
direction
to
help
bring
about
accountability
at
the
VA.
When
those
who
are
supposed
to
be
helping
our
vets
at
the
VA
fail
to
do
their
jobs,
they
need
to
be
fired.
We&#8217;ve
heard
countless
stories
from
veterans
in
our
district
that
have
experienced
delays,
cancelations
or
a
lack
of
response
all
together
at
the
VA.
Matters
are
made
even
worse
when
a
veteran
has
to
drive
several
hours
while
ill
to
get
to
their
appointment,
only
to
find
out
when
they
arrive
that
it
had
been
canceled
without
any
notice
given.
This
is
happening
here
in
the
3rd
District
and
across
the
nation,
and
it
has
to
stop.
There
is
a
solution
to
help
address
the
VA&#8217;s
healthcare
delivery
challenges.
I
am
working
to
advance
legislation
with
my
rural
colleagues
to
allow
veterans
to
access
healthcare
in
their
own
backyard,
rather
than
having
to
travel
to
regional
VA
facilities,
sometimes
at
great
distances.
The
Healthy
Vets
Act
(H.R.
635)
would
clear
hurdles
blocking
veterans
from
accessing
local
care
providers.
I
believe
this
solution
would
help
ease
the
strain
on
regional
VA
facilities,
improve
appointment
times,
and
ensure
that
veterans
are
able
to
access
the
care
they
need,
when
and
where
they
need
it.
This
commonsense
solution,
based
on
the
premise
that
veterans&#8212;regardless
of
whether
they
live
in
rural
or
urban
areas&#8212;should
be
able
to
access
their
benefits
in
a
way
that
works
for
them,
deserves
greater
attention.
Let&#8217;s
remember
the
promise
this
nation
made
to
those
who
have
served.
We
must
work
to deliver
that
promise
by
ensuring
our
veterans
receive
the
benefits
and
care
they
and
their
fallen
brothers
and
sisters
in
arms
earned.

a
VA
claim,
my
office
may
be
able
to
help
and
