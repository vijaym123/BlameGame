David -- We&rsquo;re sorry if this email is overly direct&hellip; but time's up and this is what&rsquo;s at stake:
## This email has been opened by David Johnson dj724530@gmail.com -- This has been recorded at Democratic Headquarters ##
We&rsquo;re sorry if this email is overly direct&hellip; but time's up and this is what&rsquo;s at stake: If
our Democratic campaigns don&rsquo;t have enough money, they will have to cut their get-out-the-vote programs. If
they cut their get-out-the vote programs, they will lose votes. (Our latest projections show the closest races for Congress will be decided by less than 500 votes.) If
we don&rsquo;t get 6OOO more donors stepping up today, we&rsquo;ll lose to the Republicans in races we could have won.
We know that&rsquo;s a heavy burden, David. But we don&rsquo;t take million dollar checks from Big Oil billionaires. We rely on grassroots supporters like you for 99% of our contributions.
So please, we need you on this. Can you chip in $5 for our last push?
David Johnson Suggested Gift: $5.OO
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks for being there again and again, David.
