Tonight, the President will deliver his annual State of the Union address. This morning, the House and Senate began the day - as they do each day of session - with a pledge of allegiance to one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
And yet, as we look to our nation's future, it is clear that we cannot be one nation under God should tolerance require that God be caged behind the doors of our churches and homes. We cannot be indivisible should opportunity demand division from some and redistribution to others. And there is little hope for liberty and justice if it is to be administered by the clumsy and heavy-handed mitts of Washington bureaucrats.
There are many today who find it hard to believe that the big government that paws at their businesses and pries into their healthcare, might have a small ear when it comes to listening to their private conversations. There are those who understand that a weak national defense is most often an invitation to confrontation, rather than an overture of peace. They argue that we ought to care less about a celebrity named Justin and more about the justness of forcing our children to pay tomorrows chits for todays overspending. And they believe opportunity, as Thomas Edison said, is missed most often because it comes dressed in overalls and looks like work.
It is these people who give me hope
and because of them I am certain our union is still strong.
