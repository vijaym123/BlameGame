Sorry to email you again, but you need to hear this.
Just now, I watched Republicans vote for the first lawsuit against a President in U.S. history.
House Republicans took to the floor of the House and compared President Obama to a tyrant.
It's sickening. This is nothing but disgraceful politics -- and total disrespect for our President.
