Kansas Common Sense
May 12, 2014
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thanks for your continued interest
in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
Calling for VA Secretary's Resignation - Share Your Experience
This
week, I spoke on the Senate floor to share a message on behalf of
veterans in Kansas and across the country: the VA system is broken and
the Department of Veterans Affairs needs major change. I'm deeply
troubled by recent reports regarding a VA hospital in Phoenix where
1,600 veterans were placed on a "secret waiting list" to avoid VA
policies on extended delays. Some of these veterans waited up to 18
months to see a doctor, and 40 veterans died waiting to receive the
care
they needed. What is most disturbing is that the situation in
Phoenix
is not an isolated incident; there are reports and allegations
of VA
dysfunction and lack of quality care to veterans in VA
facilities in
Kansas and across the nation.
I shared several stories on the Senator floor this week about
veterans
who waited decades for their disability claim to be accepted,
veterans
who suffered after being misdiagnosed by VA physicians, and
veterans
who lost their lives because of negligence when seeking
treatment and
care. The sheer absence of care is in rural communities is
ignored.
For example, the Community Based Outpatient Center (CBOC) in
Liberal,
Kansas, has been without a primary care provider for three
years. On
numerous occasions, I have questioned the VA and Secretary
Shinseki
directly about these quality of care concerns and provider
recruitment
for rural areas like the Liberal CBOC - but nothing has
changed. I
cannot recall one instance when one of the complaints we
conveyed to
the Department resulted in any change in the way the
Department of
Veterans Affairs is doing business.
The problem is not a lack of resources - the problem is with
leadership and the lack of will to change. VA funding levels have
increased more than 60 percent since 2009. President Obama himself
recently stated that "we've resourced the Veterans Affairs office more
in terms of increases than any other department or agency in my
government." Unfortunately, the increases in funding have not equaled
an
increase in service and support to veterans. Veterans are waiting
for
action, and yet the VA continues to operate in the same old
bureaucratic
fashion, settling for mediocrity and continued
disservice.
There's a difference between wanting change and leading it to happen.
For this reason, on Tuesday I demanded accountability and reform within
the VA system from top to bottom and all across the country. I believe
that Secretary Shinseki is seemingly unwilling or unable to deliver
reform and hold people accountable so change must be made at the top. I
asked the Secretary to submit his resignation and I asked President
Obama to accept his resignation.
It is the first time in my 18 years of service on Capitol Hill that I
have called for the resignation of a sitting cabinet secretary. Amidst
the systemic failure and culture of mediocrity within the VA system, I
am convinced dramatic top-to-bottom change is needed at the Department
in order for veterans to receive the quality care they deserve and the
benefits they earned.
Too many veterans are suffering because the Department of Veterans
Affairs is failing to serve their needs. If you're a veteran or family
member of a veteran, I want to hear about your experience with the VA.

Disappointed with HHS Secretary's Refusal to Testify at Budget Hearing
On
Wednesday, I participated in a Senate Appropriations Health
Subcommittee hearing on the Administration's Fiscal Year 2015 budget
request for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). I
serve as Ranking Member of this subcommittee, which has jurisdiction
over funding for most agencies within HHS. Unfortunately, HHS Secretary
Kathleen Sebelius refused to testify on her Department's budget
request.
I would expect the head of any department in our government
to justify
its budget request before the Senate Appropriations
Committee,
especially since HHS requested nearly $70 billion for
FY2015.
While I appreciated the expertise and experience of the panel of
witnesses who testified at this hearing, none of them were in a
position
to explain the overall strategy or management of HHS. Not one
person on
the panel could explain the gives and takes that go into
determining
how funding is allocated throughout the entire budget. Not
one of the
witnesses could answer questions regarding the priorities
of the
Department as a whole. And not one of the panelists could speak
to why
specific decisions were made. All of these questions should be
answered
by the HHS Secretary, that is her role, and yet she declined
to appear
at this hearing. There is a level of respect that the
Executive branch
and Congress need to pay one another in order for the
budget process to
work, and the Administration's tactics here are
unprecedented and
unacceptable. Click here
to watch my remarks about the hearing.
Questioning Agencies about Federal Technology Spending
Also
on Wednesday, I participated in a Financial Services and General
Government Subcommittee hearing to examine management of federal
information technology (IT) investments. The hearing included witness
from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), General Services
Administration (GSA), Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the
Government Accountability Office (GAO). This year, the Federal
government plans to spend about $82 billion on IT, and that total does
not include 58 independent executive branch agencies, the CIA, or the
legislative or judicial branches. According to the GAO, 30 percent of
our spending - some $12.4 billion - is in need of management attention
because it will either be over budget, not developed in time, or will
not have the functionality that the contract awarded. The failed launch
of the Healthcare.gov website is the most recent example of the need to
improve our technology strategy. To view a webcast of the hearing,

Rotary's Effort to Eradicate Polio
I was honored to
be recognized by Rotary International at its Polio
Eradication Champions
event on Wednesday evening. Rotary is a leading
partner in the Global
Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), a
collaboration with the United
States Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) and other
partners including the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation, that is
committed to eliminating polio across the globe.
Rotary has contributed
more than $1.2 billion to date to fight polio.
Through 2018, every new
dollar Rotary commits to polio eradication
will be matched two-to-one by
the Gates Foundation up to $35 million a
year.
Polio once afflicted thousands of Americans during epidemics into the
1950s. Polio cases have been reduced by 99 percent worldwide, but the
disease has not yet been eradicated in Nigeria, Pakistan or
Afghanistan.
This support saves lives and reduces health care costs -
the GPEI will
have saved the world $40 to $50 billion from 1988
through 2035 if the
eradication of polio is achieved by 2018.
As a fellow Rotarian, I commend the organization and its members for
their leadership in eradicating polio across the globe and share this
commitment to ridding the world of this terrible disease. Today only a
handful of countries in the world still face endemic polio and with
continued commitment and determination from GPEI partners, together we
can reach this objective. Thank you for this kind recognition. Here,
I'm
pictured with Rotary International President Ron Burton.
Global Down Syndrome Foundation Annual Be Beautiful Be Yourself D.C.
Gala
Also
Wednesday evening, I joined hundreds of advocates for individuals
with
Down syndrome and individuals who are differently-abled at the
Global
Down Syndrome Foundation's (GDSF's) Annual Be Beautiful Be
Yourself D.C.
Gala. GDSF is dedicated to improving the lives of
individuals with Down
syndrome and their families through research,
medical care, education
and advocacy. During the Gala, I was honored
to receive GDSF's Quincy
Jones Exceptional Advocacy Award.
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the focal point of our
nation's medical research, and I am committed to prioritizing
life-saving medical research. I have also worked to raise the profile
of
medical research relating to Down syndrome, including its
connection
with Alzheimer's disease; by the age of 40, half of those
with Down
syndrome develop the pathology consistent with Alzheimer's,
yet only
half ever develop the disease. In a recent committee hearing,
I asked
NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins about this connection and the
potential
medical research holds. A better understanding of how
Alzheimer's
disease affects this very special population could produce
tremendous
benefits for those with Down syndrome as well as those with
Alzheimer's
disease. Please click here to view my discussion with Dr.
Collins.
Also, I am a sponsor of the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act,
legislation that would enable the creation of tax-exempt savings
accounts to help individuals with disabilities or the parents of a
child
with a disability save money to cover long-term expenses such as
education, housing, transportation and employment support. This
legislation has broad bipartisan support and I hope to have the
opportunity to support passage of the ABLE Act in the Senate very soon.
Thanks to GDSF and all their supporters.
Meeting with Livestock Marketing Association
En
route to Washington, D.C., I was able to stop in and visit with the
staff at the Livestock Marketing Association (LMA). LMA is the national
trade organization for the livestock marketing business and represents
around 70 percent of U.S. livestock markets. We discussed the
ever-increasing regulatory environment and what it means for livestock
markets and producers. It was good to talk with such a first-class team
with an organization that has been serving markets and producers for
more than 60 years. Thanks to Corey Schultz, Vince Nowak, Chelsea Good,
Lindsay Graber and Mark Mackey.
USDA Disaster Declaration for Five Kansas Counties
This
week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) designated five
counties in Kansas as primary disaster areas due to production losses
caused by the drought. The counties designated disaster areas are:
Butler, Kingman, Reno, Sedgwick and Harvey. Farmers
and ranchers in
the following 12 counties in Kansas also qualify for
natural disaster
assistance because their counties are contiguous: Barber, Chase,
Cowley, Elk, Greenwood, Harper, McPherson, Marion, Pratt, Rice,
Stafford and Sumner.
As I travel throughout Kansas, I can see the devastating impact of
the
drought. By declaring these counties agricultural disaster areas,
farmers and ranchers in the affected counties will become eligible for
USDA emergency loans. This assistance will enable agricultural
operations to continue across our state, in spite of the exceedingly
dry
conditions.
These counties are now eligible for important disaster programs, such
as the emergency loan program administrated by the Farm Service Agency
(FSA) and the Supplemental Revenue Assistance Payments Program.
Affected
farmers should contact their local FSA office for more
information: http://www.fsa.usda.gov/ks/.
SBA Disaster Assistance to Cherokee, Crawford and Labette Counties
Also this week, it was announced that
the U.S. Small Business
Administration (SBA) will offer low-interest
federal disaster loans to
Kansas residents and business owners affected
by the April 27, 2014
tornado. SBA assistance will be available in the
Kansas counties of
Cherokee, Crawford and Labette.
I am pleased the SBA quickly responded to Governor Brownback's
request
for disaster assistance following the Baxter Springs tornado.
After
witnessing the destruction of homes, businesses and infrastructure
firsthand, these loans will help Kansans rebuild. For more information,

McPherson "All Schools Day" Parade
On Friday, I
joined area residents for the 101st annual McPherson All
Schools Day
Parade. The tradition began in 1914 as a way to celebrate
8th grade
graduates. Since then, it has grown into a week-long annual
Kansas event
honoring graduates from eighth grade, high school and
college with
hundreds of participants. It was nice to see so many old
friends and new
faces. A special thanks to Scott Werth, my driver in
the parade; Donna
Viola, who helped arrange my visit and to the 2014
chairperson, Mary
Steffes. Mary and her committee did a great job
organizing this terrific
community event. Here, I'm pictured with
McPherson High School Senior
Ian Ferguson.
Little River Community Visit
On my way out of
McPherson on Friday, I stopped in the community of
Little River and
enjoyed visiting with folks at the City Library,
Little River State
Bank, Rice Co. Builders, Mutual Telephone Company,
Fat Boyz Bar and
Grille and Garden of Eden Grocery. Thanks for the
good conversations
along Main Street.
Rice County Kansas Listening Tour Stop
After my
visit to Little River, I continued my Kansas Listening Tour
in Rice
County in the community room at Lyons Federal Bank. I enjoyed
the
opportunity to visit with local residents about a wide range of
topics
including Cecil Burdette of Lyons who discussed concerns with
VA
healthcare. Thanks to John Sweet, Lyons City Administrator for
helping
set up the town hall meeting. The work I do in Washington and
the issues
I focus on are largely based on the conversations I have
with Kansans. I
greatly appreciate the hundreds of Kansans who take
the time to visit
with me at town halls because I learn something from
every conversation.
Check my website for upcoming Kansas Listening
Tour stops.
Meeting with Secretary of Labor on Veterans' Employment
This
week, I had the opportunity to sit down with Department of Labor
(DOL)
Secretary Thomas Perez in my office in Washington, D.C. The
meeting was a
follow-up to the April 9, 2014, Senate Labor
Appropriations hearing
during which I questioned Secretary Perez on
what the Department could
do to address the employment challenges
facing veterans when they return
from overseas.
During our meeting, Secretary Perez indicated that the Department is
working on several initiatives with the goal of helping veterans. He
cited the proposed expansion of Reemployment and Eligibility
Assessments
(REAs) and Reemployment Services (RESs) - in-person review
and
re-training exercises - to all recently separated military
personnel
receiving Unemployment Compensation for Ex-service members.
The
Secretary also discussed ongoing efforts with the Department of
Defense
and Department of Veterans Affairs to identify and begin
providing
employment services to service members six months before
their discharge
date. It is my hope that greater preparation will
reduce much of the
uncertainty that veterans upon their return home.
In Kansas, DOL currently has 22 full-time employees engaged in
veteran
employment and training services. The majority of this staff are
Disabled Veterans Outreach Program Specialists (DVOPS) dedicated to
providing job search and application assistance to veterans who have
significant barriers to employment. The job placement rate for these
veterans in Kansas is approximately 65 percent, with 85 percent
gainfully employed six months down the line. We can and must do a
better
job of providing our veterans with the proper tools and
resources to
succeed. Top flight workforce training programs in
Wichita and
throughout Kansas lead me to believe these numbers will
continue to
improve.
In addition, I am a cosponsor of the Hire More Heroes Act,
legislation
that will allow employers to exempt veterans or reservists
who already
have qualifying health care coverage through TRICARE or the
U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs from Obamacare's employer mandate
requirement. These employees would not be counted when determining
whether an employer meets the health care law's 50 full-time equivalent
employee requirement to provide health insurance, or else pay a $2,000
fine per employee. In March, a companion bill passed the U.S. House of
Representatives by a vote of 406 to 1, but no action has been taken yet
in the U.S. Senate.
The Independent School Visit
On Tuesday, I had the
opportunity to visit with two remarkable young
students from The
Independent School in Wichita. Eighth-graders Reid
McConnaughey and
William Rowley were in Washington, D.C. to
participate in the Ford's
Theatre Oratory Residency and Festival. They
were selected to
participate in this program based upon their
performance of an important
historical speech. As student
participants, Reid and William worked
with Ford's Theatre teaching
artists to build their speech, writing, and
leadership skills. I
enjoyed visiting with Reid and William about their
experience and the
skills they've learned through the program, and I
wish them continued
success as they pursue their education.
Congratulating Class of 2014 at Sylvan-Lucas Unified High School
On
Saturday, I had the opportunity to address the graduating seniors
of
Sylvan-Lucas Unified High School in Sylvan Grove during
commencement
exercises. When I asked Principal Walter about this class
of seniors, he
said, "it's a class of good kids" who will "do anything
for anyone at
anytime." In my book, that's pretty high praise coming
from a high
school principal. This group of 12 seniors is not only
actively involved
in school activities, but is also dedicated to
serving their local
community. In my view, individuals who engage in
their churches, schools
and communities can have the greatest impact
and change lives for the
better.
High school graduation is a special time for both families and
seniors
because it represents a significant turning point in their lives
as
many prepare to leave home for the first time. During this time of
year, most seniors are busy thinking about their future plans. So I
took
the opportunity to remind them that true success is not marked by
what
we get out of life, but by what we give back and the kind of
person we
become. I challenged the seniors to become individuals of
character who
pursue excellence and put others first. In life, each of
us has a higher
calling. Not just to make a dollar, but to make a
difference. Not just
to find happiness, but to fulfill a purpose. No
job, regardless of the
salary or perks, can take the place of a life
committed to a purpose
greater than yourself.
Congrats once again to the class of 2014 on their outstanding
achievement. And special thanks to Superintendent Stecklein and
Principal Walter for the invitation to speak at this year's graduation
ceremony.

Calling

This

The hearing included witness
from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), General Services
Administration
(GSA), Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the

the Federal
government plans to spend about $82 billion on IT, and that total does
not include 58 independent
executive branch agencies, the CIA, or the
legislative or judicial branches. According to the GAO, 30
percent of
our spending &#8211; some $12.4 billion &#8211; is in need of management attention
because
it will either be over budget, not developed in time, or will
not have the functionality that the contract
awarded. The failed launch
of the Healthcare.gov website is the most recent example of the need to
improve our technology strategy. To view a webcast of the hearing,

Rotary&#8217;s Effort to Eradicate Polio
I was honored to
be recognized by Rotary International at its Polio
Eradication Champions
event on Wednesday evening. Rotary is a leading partner in the Global
Polio Eradication
Initiative (GPEI), a collaboration with the United
States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) and other
partners including the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, that is
committed to eliminating
polio across the globe. Rotary has contributed
more than $1.2 billion to date to fight polio. Through
2018, every new
dollar Rotary commits to polio eradication will be matched two-to-one by
the Gates
Foundation up to $35 million a year.
Polio once afflicted
thousands of Americans during epidemics into the
1950s. Polio cases have been reduced by 99 percent
worldwide, but the
disease has not yet been eradicated in Nigeria, Pakistan or Afghanistan.
This support
saves lives and reduces health care costs &#8211; the GPEI will
have saved the world $40 to $50 billion
from 1988 through 2035 if the
eradication of polio is achieved by 2018.
As
a fellow Rotarian, I commend the organization and its members for
their leadership in eradicating polio
across the globe and share this
commitment to ridding the world of this terrible disease. Today only
a
handful of countries in the world still face endemic polio and with
continued commitment and determination
from GPEI partners, together we
can reach this objective. Thank you for this kind recognition. Here,
I'm

Global Down Syndrome Foundation Annual Be Beautiful Be Yourself
D.C. Gala
Also
Wednesday evening, I joined hundreds of advocates for individuals
with
Down syndrome and individuals who are differently-abled at the Global
Down Syndrome Foundation&#8217;s
(GDSF&#8217;s) Annual Be Beautiful Be Yourself D.C.
Gala. GDSF is dedicated to improving the lives of
individuals with Down
syndrome and their families through research, medical care, education
and advocacy.
During the Gala, I was honored to receive GDSF&#8217;s Quincy
Jones Exceptional Advocacy Award.
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the focal point of our
nation&#8217;s
medical research, and I am committed to prioritizing
life-saving medical research. I have also worked
to raise the profile of
medical research relating to Down syndrome, including its connection
with Alzheimer&#8217;s
disease; by the age of 40, half of those with Down
syndrome develop the pathology consistent with Alzheimer&#8217;s,
yet only
half ever develop the disease. In a recent committee hearing, I asked
NIH Director Dr. Francis
Collins about this connection and the potential
medical research holds. A better understanding of how
Alzheimer&#8217;s
disease affects this very special population could produce tremendous
benefits for
those with Down syndrome as well as those with Alzheimer&#8217;s
disease. Please click here to view
my discussion with Dr. Collins.
Also, I am a sponsor of the
Achieving a Better Life Experience Act,
legislation that would enable the creation of tax-exempt savings
accounts to help individuals with disabilities or the parents of a child
with a disability save money
to cover long-term expenses such as
education, housing, transportation and employment support. This
legislation has broad bipartisan support and I hope to have the
opportunity to support passage of the
ABLE Act in the Senate very soon.
Thanks to GDSF and all their supporters.
Meeting with Livestock Marketing Association
En
route to Washington, D.C., I was able to stop in and visit with
the
staff at the Livestock Marketing Association (LMA). LMA is the national
trade organization for
the livestock marketing business and represents
around 70 percent of U.S. livestock markets. We discussed
the
ever-increasing regulatory environment and what it means for livestock
markets and producers. It
was good to talk with such a first-class team
with an organization that has been serving markets and
producers for
more than 60 years. Thanks to Corey Schultz, Vince Nowak, Chelsea Good,
Lindsay Graber
and Mark Mackey.
USDA Disaster Declaration for Five Kansas Counties
This
week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) designated
five
counties in Kansas as primary disaster areas due to production losses
caused by the drought. The
counties designated disaster areas are:
Butler, Kingman, Reno, Sedgwick
and
Harvey.
Farmers
and ranchers in the following 12 counties in Kansas also
qualify for
natural disaster assistance because their counties are contiguous:
Barber,
Chase, Cowley, Elk, Greenwood, Harper, McPherson, Marion, Pratt, Rice, Stafford
and
Sumner.
As I travel throughout Kansas, I can see the devastating
impact of
the drought. By declaring these counties agricultural disaster areas,
farmers and ranchers
in the affected counties will become eligible for
USDA emergency loans. This assistance will enable
agricultural
operations to continue across our state, in spite of the exceedingly dry
conditions.
These counties are now eligible for important disaster programs, such
as the emergency loan program administrated by the Farm Service Agency
(FSA) and the Supplemental Revenue
Assistance Payments Program. Affected
farmers should contact their local FSA office for more information:
h ttp://www.fsa.usda.gov/ks/.
SBA Disaster Assistance to Cherokee, Crawford and Labette Counties
Also this week, it was announced that
the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) will offer low-interest
federal disaster loans to Kansas
residents and business owners affected
by the April 27, 2014 tornado. SBA assistance will be available
in the
Kansas counties of
Cherokee, Crawford
and
Labette.
I am pleased the SBA quickly responded to Governor Brownback&#8217;s
request for disaster assistance following the Baxter Springs tornado.
After witnessing the destruction
of homes, businesses and infrastructure
firsthand, these loans will help Kansans rebuild. For more information,

McPherson &#8220;All Schools Day&#8221; Parade
On Friday, I
joined area residents for the 101st annual McPherson
All Schools Day
Parade. The tradition began in 1914 as a way to celebrate 8th grade
graduates. Since
then, it has grown into a week-long annual Kansas event
honoring graduates from eighth grade, high school
and college with
hundreds of participants. It was nice to see so many old friends and new
faces. A
special thanks to Scott Werth, my driver in the parade; Donna
Viola, who helped arrange my visit and
to the 2014 chairperson, Mary
Steffes. Mary and her committee did a great job organizing this terrific
community event. Here, I'm pictured with McPherson High School Senior
Ian Ferguson.
Little River Community Visit
On my way out of
McPherson on Friday, I stopped in the community
of Little River and
enjoyed visiting with folks at the City Library, Little River State
Bank, Rice
Co. Builders, Mutual Telephone Company, Fat Boyz Bar and
Grille and Garden of Eden Grocery. Thanks for
the good conversations
along Main Street.
Rice County Kansas Listening Tour Stop
After
my
visit to Little River, I continued my Kansas Listening Tour in Rice
County in the community room
at Lyons Federal Bank. I enjoyed the
opportunity to visit with local residents about a wide range of
topics
including Cecil Burdette of Lyons who discussed concerns with VA
healthcare. Thanks to John
Sweet, Lyons City Administrator for helping
set up the town hall meeting. The work I do in Washington
and the issues
I focus on are largely based on the conversations I have with Kansans. I
greatly appreciate
the hundreds of Kansans who take the time to visit
with me at town halls because I learn something from
every conversation.
Check my website for upcoming Kansas Listening Tour stops.
Meeting with Secretary of Labor on Veterans&#8217; Employment
This
week, I had the opportunity to sit down with Department of
Labor (DOL)
Secretary Thomas Perez in my office in Washington, D.C. The meeting was a
follow-up to
the April 9, 2014, Senate Labor Appropriations hearing
during which I questioned Secretary Perez on
what the Department could
do to address the employment challenges facing veterans when they return
from overseas.
During our meeting, Secretary Perez indicated
that the Department is
working on several initiatives with the goal of helping veterans. He
cited the
proposed expansion of Reemployment and Eligibility Assessments
(REAs) and Reemployment Services (RESs)
&#8211; in-person review and
re-training exercises &#8211; to all recently separated military personnel
receiving Unemployment Compensation for Ex-service members. The
Secretary also discussed ongoing efforts
with the Department of Defense
and Department of Veterans Affairs to identify and begin providing
employment
services to service members six months before their discharge
date. It is my hope that greater preparation
will reduce much of the
uncertainty that veterans upon their return home.
In
Kansas, DOL currently has 22 full-time employees engaged in
veteran employment and training services.
The majority of this staff are
Disabled Veterans Outreach Program Specialists (DVOPS) dedicated to
providing job search and application assistance to veterans who have
significant barriers to employment.
The job placement rate for these
veterans in Kansas is approximately 65 percent, with 85 percent
gainfully
employed six months down the line. We can and must do a better
job of providing our veterans with the
proper tools and resources to
succeed. Top flight workforce training programs in Wichita and
throughout
Kansas lead me to believe these numbers will continue to
improve.
In
addition, I am a cosponsor of the Hire More Heroes Act,
legislation that will allow employers to exempt
veterans or reservists
who already have qualifying health care coverage through TRICARE or the
U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs from Obamacare&#8217;s employer mandate
requirement. These employees
would not be counted when determining
whether an employer meets the health care law&#8217;s 50 full-time
equivalent
employee requirement to provide health insurance, or else pay a $2,000
fine per employee.
In March, a companion bill passed the U.S. House of
Representatives by a vote of 406 to 1, but no action
has been taken yet
in the U.S. Senate.
The Independent School Visit
On Tuesday, I had the
opportunity to visit with two remarkable
young students from The
Independent School in Wichita. Eighth-graders Reid McConnaughey and
William
Rowley were in Washington, D.C. to participate in the Ford&#8217;s
Theatre Oratory Residency and Festival.
They were selected to
participate in this program based upon their performance of an important
historical
speech. As student participants, Reid and William worked
with Ford&#8217;s Theatre teaching artists
to build their speech, writing, and
leadership skills. I enjoyed visiting with Reid and William about
their
experience and the skills they&#8217;ve learned through the program, and I
wish them continued
success as they pursue their education.
Congratulating Class of 2014 at Sylvan-Lucas Unified High School
On
Saturday, I had the opportunity to address the graduating seniors
of
Sylvan-Lucas Unified High School in Sylvan Grove during commencement
exercises. When I asked Principal
Walter about this class of seniors, he
said, &#8220;it&#8217;s a class of good kids&#8221; who will
&#8220;do anything for anyone at
anytime.&#8221; In my book, that&#8217;s pretty high praise coming
from a high
school principal. This group of 12 seniors is not only actively involved
in school activities,
but is also dedicated to serving their local
community. In my view, individuals who engage in their
churches, schools
and communities can have the greatest impact and change lives for the
better.
High school graduation is a special time for both families and
seniors
because it represents a significant turning point in their lives
as many prepare to leave home for the
first time. During this time of
year, most seniors are busy thinking about their future plans. So I
took
the opportunity to remind them that true success is not marked by what
we get out of life, but
by what we give back and the kind of person we
become. I challenged the seniors to become individuals
of character who
pursue excellence and put others first. In life, each of us has a higher
calling.
Not just to make a dollar, but to make a difference. Not just
to find happiness, but to fulfill a purpose.
No job, regardless of the
salary or perks, can take the place of a life committed to a purpose
greater
than yourself.
Congrats once again to the class of 2014 on
their outstanding
achievement. And special thanks to Superintendent Stecklein and
Principal Walter
for the invitation to speak at this year&#8217;s graduation
ceremony.
