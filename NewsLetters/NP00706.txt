Financial Football
I had a great time playing Financial Football with Greg Olsen and
Thomas Davis of the Carolina Panthers
at Stall High in North Charleston
Monday morning! Financial Football promotes financial literacy among
high school students through a football video game. It is a fun way to
get our young people involved in learning about financial literacy.
Poverty Summit at Georgetown University
I enjoyed speaking at the Georgetown Poverty Summit on Tuesday. Poverty
is not a political issue, it is a moral, ethical, and biblical one. I
truly believe education is the doorway to the American dream and the
closest thing to magic. Watch my remarks by clicking the photo!
The Importance of the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program
Yesterday, I testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee at Archbishop Carroll High School on the importance of school
choice and the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program. I discussed my
CHOICE Act, Opportunity Agenda and building a brighter educational
future for our children. Watch here

Body Camera Hearing, Tuesday May 19, 2015
The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism will hold a
hearing at 2:30PM next Tuesday, May 19, entitled "Body Cameras: Can
Technology Increase Protection for Law Enforcement Officers and the
Public?"
I believe that body-worn cameras will keep both law enforcement
officers and citizens safer, while providing invaluable evidence for
potential investigations. I look forward to continuing our efforts to
find the best path forward on this issue at the hearing.
Thanks again for subscribing!
Sincerely,
Tim
