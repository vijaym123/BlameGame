This week, the House passed the Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act, ( H.R. 5405 ) which reduces the regulatory burden on small businesses and spurs growth. It also includes several provisions to help emerging companies raise capital and grow.
By reducing the regulations crushing small businesses, we take a step towards freeing them up to light up our economy. It makes sense: real growth isnt created by pulling a lever in Washington
real growth happens when our small businesses, innovators, and entrepreneurs have the ability and opportunity to create jobs, expand their companies, and push us forward.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.
I also cosponsored the Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act, ( H.R. 367 ), which requires Congress to take an up-or-down vote on every new major rule issued by a Federal agency before it could be enforced on businesses and the American people.
This ensures that the Executive Branch is being held accountable for the barrage of burdensome regulations being imposed on job creators. Its common sense.
