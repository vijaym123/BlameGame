Dear Friends,
It's been
such a pleasure representing you and your family in Congress this
year. In between the cookies, parties, Santa and presents this holiday
season, I hope you will also take some time to show peace, love and
kindness to your family, neighbors and communities. As Calvin Coolidge
put it, "Christmas is not a time nor a season, but a state of mind. To
cherish peace and goodwill, to be plenteous in mercy, is to have the
real spirit of Christmas".
Looking back on 2013, I realize our country is facing some tough
issues. As we approach 2014, I wanted to again share with you
some of my goals in Congress. We need to:
Reduce the size and influence of the
government
Increase personal freedoms
Reduce national debt and decrease spending
Secure our freedom as a nation
I remain hopeful and optimistic that we will be
able to make some meaningful reforms to get our country back on
track.
