I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU
One of the many ways I like to stay in touch with constituents is through my
Facebook ,
Twitter ,
YouTube
and
Instagram
pages.
My pages are constantly updated with new information, articles, photos and videos on the issues that are most important to you.
Just last week, I posted a
video
to my YouTube page to respond to constituent questions regarding my stance on the full withdrawal of troops in Afghanistan, increased government regulations and the impact on energy costs and the President's healthcare law.
I hope you'll take a moment to check out my social media pages, follow me and join in on the dialogue.
