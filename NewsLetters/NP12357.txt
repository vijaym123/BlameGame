Dear Friends,
Thank you
for the opportunity to update you on the work of the 113th Congress. I
trust this finds you and your family well. As I've mentioned before,
a few of my 2014 goals include, working to reduce the size and
influence of federal government, increasing our personal freedoms and
securing our freedom as a nation. I wanted to highlight three bills that fall
in line with these goals, which passed the House last week.
The
Public Access and Lands Improvement Act:
As
I try to reduce the size and influence of the federal government, I am
committed to promoting more access to the federal lands in Utah. I
was proud to vote for the Public Access and Lands Improvement Act which
is comprised of a package of bills designed to protect and promote
public access to lands. It removes red-tape that blocks local economic
development and job growth, and encourages locally-cenetered land
management. With more than 65% of Utah's land owned and managed by the
federal government, it's critical that we continue to work to return some
of Utah's federally owned land back to the state. This is a great step
forward.
The Sportsmens Heritage and Recreational Enhancement
Act :
As a lifetime hunter and outdoorsman,
promoting and preserving the values and traditions of sportsman
and sportswomen is extremely important to me. The Sportsmens
Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act, which passed the House last
week, requires the federal land management agencies to keep their
public lands open to hunting, recreational fishing, and shooting.
Additionally, one section of the bill clarifies that the EPA can't regulate the
use of traditional ammunition.
I am honored to continue to
do all that I can to uphold the 2nd Amendment.
GI Bill
Tuition Fairness Act:
This
bipartisan legislation, which passed the House last
week,
improves educational opportunities for veterans.
Active
duty servicemembers already receive in-state tuition rates, but when
they leave service, many veterans are unable to fulfill burdensome state
residency requirements and are forced to pay a high out-of-state
tuition rate even if they have been stationed in the state for
years.
Our nations veterans signed up to defend all 50 states, not
just his or her home state. By complying with the bills provisions,
public colleges and universities would charge non-state resident
veterans up to the in-state tuition rate.
Schools that offer the
in-state tuition rates to non-resident veterans would continue to be
eligible to receive G.I. Bill education payments. Voting yes on this
piece of legislation was not only the right thing to do for our
veterans within Utah, but for veterans all across the country who have
served and protected us.
