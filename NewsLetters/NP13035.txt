Dear Friends,
This Monday we join in honoring the life and work of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. A leading civil rights advocate and champion of equality, Dr. King embodied the values each of us should strive for.
Dr. King's efforts have left a resounding impact across the nation. His words and activism led us into a new era of freedom. As we honor him Monday, we must also remember that the fight for equal rights continues to this day.
2014 year marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Act. Throughout the year, the Library of Congress will be promoting the importance of this act nationwide, including activities in Hartford. Half a century since one of the most important measures in our nation&rsquo;s history passed, some continue to lack the freedoms they deserve. Discrimination persists across the country. In certain areas, Americans are still fighting for their fundamental right to vote.
Let us take the celebration of the great Dr. King and the anniversary of that vital legislation and remember that while our nation has come a long way, we still have work to do.
Sincerely,
