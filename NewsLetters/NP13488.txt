December 20, 2013
Dear Friends,
As we celebrate Christmas, close out 2013,
and look toward the New Year, I feel its appropriate to reflect on
the blessings the year has brought.
We live in the greatest country
the world has ever known.
And though weve been through a lot
of tough times
wars, civil unrest, economic turbulence, acts of
nature, acts of man
weve always landed on our feet.
Thats what
great countries do.
Thats what Americans do.
And Im
blessed with the comfort of knowing that, even in the times of uncertainty
we face today, we will do so yet again.
America faces many
challenges.
But the greatest challenge we face is leaving our
country better than we found it so our children and grandchildren
like
my new grandson, Kaden
can live the American dream, too.
As we
fight to restore fiscal responsibility and government accountability
in Washington, I could not be more grateful to represent you and the
people of Arkansass Third District.
I look forward to
serving you as we work toward getting America back on track and preserving
our great nation for our children and grandchildren.
Merry
Christmas and best wishes for a prosperous, healthy, and blessed
2014.
Congressman Steve Womack
Arkansas Third
District

us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be
upon his shoulder,
and his name shall be called Wonderful
Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. -Isaiah
