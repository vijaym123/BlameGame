This morning President Obama emailed you for the SECOND time this month.
That&rsquo;s because we're in serious trouble. Karl Rove and the Koch Brothers are massively outspending us -- and we only have 48 hours to respond.
If we get blown out right now, we might as well give up hope until 2016.
The biggest fundraising deadline of the year is in 48 hours.
If you can be one of the 13 people we need from from the 60659 code to respond to President Obama's call to action, please chip in what you can today.
