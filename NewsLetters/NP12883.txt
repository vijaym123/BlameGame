The State of
the Union
The Constitution says that
the president shall from time to time give to the Congress information
of the State of the Union.
That time comes this week as
President Obama will report on the condition of our country and outline his
legislative goals for the year.
Its clear that 2013
didnt go as well for the president as he was hoping.
From the IRS
and Benghazi scandals to the embarrassing start for his healthcare
law, the president will likely use his address to hit the reset button
and try to regain some credibility with the American
people.
Hell probably try to shift the focus away from his job performance
by rehashing a number of his liberal talking points, like giving
amnesty to illegal immigrants, or income inequality, all the while failing
to mention the role his policies have played in furthering that
gap.
Consider that the percentage of the American workforce
that has a job or is looking for one stands at only 62.8 percent, the
lowest in 36 years.
There are still over 10 million Americans
unemployed, and 8 million more who have part-time jobs but would prefer
full-time ones.
The presidents policies arent working, and the
American people deserve better.
In 2010, the president used
the State of the Union to declare that jobs must be our number one
focus.
Regrettably, that laser-like focus never materialized,
and our economic situation suffered as a result.
In
2014, I hope the president uses the opportunity to repeat that pledge,
and to mean it this time.
