Saving money and making the world safer! Doesn&rsquo;t that sound like a good idea?
I&rsquo;ll be hosting a public forum next month, &ldquo; The Risks and Costs of Nuclear Weapons &rdquo; on the need to reduce our nuclear arsenal and cut spending on outdated programs which are better suited for the Cold War than the strategic challenges we face today.
According to a recent
Congressional Budget Office report , the US currently spends over $150 million per day maintaining our nuclear capabilities. This money is spent maintaining an arsenal over 5,000 weapons strong and capable of destroying the planet many times over. These weapons haven&rsquo;t been used in almost 70 years and aren&rsquo;t the ones we need to deal with today&rsquo;s global conflicts. That is why I&rsquo;ve introduced
HR 4107, the Reduce Expenditures in Nuclear Infrastructure Now (REIN-IN) Act of 2014 . This legislation would save $100 billion over 10 years by reducing unnecessary nuclear weapons programs and significantly reduce the number of inter-continental missiles currently on 24-hour high alert.
Please join me for a forum with a panel of experts I am hosting representing Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility, the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, and Columbia Riverkeeper to discuss the fiscal, humanitarian, and environmental legacy of our nation&rsquo;s nuclear weapons programs.
