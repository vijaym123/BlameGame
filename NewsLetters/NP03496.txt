Quick heads up
were expected to be voting on the Department of Homeland Security funding bill over the next day or so, and with it, 5 amendments, which will cut funding from the Presidents executive actions on immigration and restrict him from taking similar actions in the future. This includes prohibiting the use of agency-collected fees (which I talked about back in December) that make up about 97% of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) budget. The USCIS is the agency responsible for implementing the Presidents executive amnesty plan.
Ill be sending out my notes on text of the legislation later, for now wanted you to be able to read the text of the proposed bill and amendments, available here:

Randy
