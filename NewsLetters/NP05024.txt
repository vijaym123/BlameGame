Westmoreland to Host Town Hall in
Griffin
I
will be hosting a town hall meeting in Spalding County at the University
of Georgia- Griffin Campus on October 29, 2014 from 10am to 11am.
At the town hall, I will give an update on my work in Washington and
allow for questions from the audience. All members of the community
are invited to
attend.
With everything going on both internationally and domestically, this town
hall meeting is a great opportunity for me to hear what the people of
the Third Congressional District think. The town hall also
allows me to give you an update on what Im working on both in Washington
and how it affects you here in Georgia. I encourage anyone with
concerns, questions, or opinions to attend my town hall in Griffin so that I
can better represent
you.
