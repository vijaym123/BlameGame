David -- This is the last national election of Barack Obama&rsquo;s presidency.
And right now, we&rsquo;re getting PUMMELED.

But we&rsquo;re not going down without a fight.
In 1 hours, we&rsquo;ll close the books on the final major fundraising deadline of this campaign. David, if you can chip in right now, we could really use your support. MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: All Gifts
