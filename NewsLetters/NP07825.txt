I wanted to share with you a new bill I introduced.
The Independent Research and Repurposing Act,
H.R.4287 , encourages the development of new medical treatments by repurposing existing drugs to address new ailments, conditions, or diseases.
Drug repurposing research is already underway in many disease areas, including cancer, Parkinsons disease, Alzheimers disease, epilepsy, depression, sleep disorders, and Post-Traumatic Stress.
Whether it is a servicemember suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress, or a relative recently diagnosed with cancer, discovering treatments and cures for the diseases afflicting many Americans is a priority that transcends politics. Encouraging drug repurposing is a critical avenue for discovering ground-breaking ways to combat - and ultimately cure - these devastating diseases.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.- I have also introduced the Patients First Act,
H.R.1740 , to intensify research and human clinical trials using stem cells that are ethically obtained and that show evidence of providing near-term clinical benefit for human patients. This bill recognizes that the twin goals of scientific advancement and the protection of human life are not mutually exclusive; rather, they should be one in the same.
