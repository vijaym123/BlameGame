Rep. Bob Goodlatte
50 Virginia College &amp; University Presidents Agree...
As college football season approaches, rivalries between
colleges around the Commonwealth are heating up. While we can't all agree on which team we cheer for, you may be surprised to find out that there is
one topic upon which 50 Virginia college and university presidents
can
agree.
Recently, 50 Virginia college and university presidents
signed a letter
expressing their concerns surrounding President
Obama's proposed college ratings system. I agree with their concerns, which is why I've introduced H.Res. 614, a resolution opposing the proposed
ratings system. You can read more in my
weekly column
below.
Protecting Students' College Choices
Across the Sixth District
and the nation, new college students are moving onto campuses for the first time, setting up dorm rooms, preparing for classes, and are just beginning
to embark on their higher education.
They have chosen a school, have enrolled, and are preparing to work hard to better themselves.
I remember well
choosing to attend Bates College and Washington and Lee University for my education, and similarly I remember helping my two children choose the
universities that they attended.
The reasons students and their
families choose a college or university are personal, and are oftentimes based on a variety of factors that differ from person to person. America has
an outstanding and unique college community.
The diversity found here is unmatched anywhere else in the world.
Students here have the option to go
to public schools, private schools, community colleges, Historically Black colleges, women&rsquo;s colleges, land grant universities, military
colleges, and countless others.
A proposal by the Obama Administration
and the Department of Education, however, threatens this diversity.
Their plan is to rate colleges and universities based on standardized measures
they choose with the intention of having financial aid tied to those ratings.
This will lead universities and colleges to tailor their education
programs to meet the Department of Education&rsquo;s specifications, encourage students to go into one major over another, and limit the innovation
potential that currently exists in our institutions of higher education.
It is no wonder that 50 presidents of Virginia&rsquo;s public and private
colleges and universities have joined together to express their concern about this proposal.
It is a worthy goal to ensure students and families have relevant information about the schools they are choosing between, but
rating our schools is not the role of the federal government.
For this reason, I have introduced a bipartisan resolution in the House of
Representatives,
H. Res. 614 , which strongly expresses
opposition to this proposal and instead supports the quality and value of diversity and innovation in our nation&rsquo;s colleges and universities.
New college students who are moving into their schools and universities
this fall had the opportunity to choose their school based on their own reasons.
Family tradition, cost effectiveness, location, size of school,
available majors, sports programs, religious affiliation &ndash; these are just some of the factors folks consider when making this decision.
I
don&rsquo;t want to see these factors removed from the equation and replaced with a federally-created rating, and I don&rsquo;t believe students and
their families do either.
A Few Photos From Around The Sixth District This
Week...
I made several stops
around the Sixth District this week, including a visit to Mt. Crawford Creamery and the King Tut Exhibit at the Science Museum of Western Virginia in
Roanoke. I also held a community luncheon with local leaders in Amherst and toured businesses in several communities. Follow along on
Facebook
for the latest updates on my stops around the Sixth
District.
