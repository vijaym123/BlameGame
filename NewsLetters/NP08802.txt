Grilling the EPA Deputy Administrator over CTS Spill
Site in Asheville
Last week, I was informed that several of my
constituents in Asheville were forced to evacuate their homes due toxic
air content near the CTS spill site off Mills Gap Road. The chemical
spill site has gone unaddressed for decades. Ensuring that the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) properly handle this site once and for
all is a top priority of mine. On Wednesday, I questioned EPA Deputy
Administrator Bob Perciasepe, demanding he address this issue swiftly and
thoroughly. Since the hearing, he has reached out to me personally. I
won't stop holding the EPA's feet to the fire on this issue until it
is properly handled. You can read more about it from the Citizen-Times
here .

Meeting Close
Up Participants Visiting DC
It was a pleasure to meet with two
students from Transylvania County on Wednesday, who traveled to
Washington, DC with Close Up, a civic education program founded in 1971. It was
my pleasure to speak with them about the importance of civic
engagement and what it's like working in government. I expect to see big
things in the future for these two young leaders. I always enjoy meeting
with students from the 11th district both in DC and back home. To the
left you can see us riding the underground tram in the Capitol
building.

Delante Benjamin, two students from Transylvania County who visited DC
with Close Up.
Appalachian Care Medical
Mission
Last Friday, I
toured Appalachian Care Medical Mission. The pop-up medical mission is
located in Swain County and Cherokee County for the first two weeks of
June. Appalachian Care is a Civil-Military Innovative Readiness
Training (IRT) Program, administered through the U.S. Department of Defense
(DOD). It conducts operations in medically underserved communities
throughout the US. Medical services are provided free of charge for
community members. It also provides training opportunities for military
reservists.
