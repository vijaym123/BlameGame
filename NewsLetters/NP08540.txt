Dear Friend &ndash;
In my family, going to college was not a choice. As the daughter of immigrants who never finished school, my parents instilled in me that to make it in America you had to be well-educated.
So I put myself through Chapman with Pell grants, loans and a scholarship from the Anaheim Rotary Club. I am what they call a &ldquo;public-private partnership.&rdquo;
It was hard, but not as hard as it is for today&rsquo;s student. When the Pell Grant was created in 1972 it covered the full cost of college. But next year&rsquo;s maximum Pell award will cover the smallest share of college costs since the start of the program: just one-third of the cost of a public four-year college.
And while college tuition across the country has grown as much as fifty percent from 2004 to 2014, state funding has steadily decreased. California&rsquo;s spending per student at state schools remains near the lowest point in more than thirty years. These factors have shifted the burden of higher tuition and cost of living to students, saddling them with increased debt.
That&rsquo;s why I introduced the Middle Class CHANCE Act. My bill would combat increasing college costs by 1) nearly doubling the national Pell Grant award to $8,900 from $5,730, 2) restoring year-round Pell grants, and 3) allowing Pell grant recipients to use the awards for 15 semesters instead of the current 12 semesters.
A college degree should help build dreams, not debt. I will continue to fight for the next generation here in Washington and at home. If you or someone you know is having trouble with student aid from the federal government, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact my district office at (714) 621-0102.
Very truly yours,
Loretta Sanchez
