Supporting Veterans and Service Members
I have been working hard in Congress to honor the sacrifices our veterans have made by ensuring they have the support they need. As the Ranking Member on the House Appropriations Committee&#44; I helped guide the Veterans Affairs bill through the House in April. The &#36;158 billion measure would take steps to reduce the veterans&#39; claims backlog&#44; enhance primary care for women veterans&#44; bolster veteran job transition and placement programs&#44; and increase funding for the Veterans Administration &#40;VA&#41; health care system. I also backed measures to investigate the systemic leadership and scheduling problems at the VA&#44; and I called for Secretary Shinseki&#39;s resignation. Our veterans must have the quality and timely care they have earned in service to our great nation.
As always&#44; my office is here to answer your questions and help you address problems with federal agencies. We recently assisted a Hartsdale veteran who received a bill in error from the VA and&#44; on his behalf&#44; we assisted him with removing the bill from his account. If you are having an issue with the VA&#44; Medicare benefits or another federal agency&#44; please click

to contact my office&#44; and we will do all we can to help.
It was my honor to join veterans recently at Memorial Day ceremonies in Clarkstown&#44; Cortlandt&#44; Hillburn&#44; Piermont&#44; Pearl River&#44; and Haverstraw&#44; to meet with student veterans from Rockland Community College about the expanded G.I. Bill&#44; and to meet with Congers native Colonel Joe Davidson &#40;who will be taking command of Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn in July&#41;&#44; in the photo below.
College Affordability
Many young people are buried in student loan debt. Anxious and concerned parents delay retirement &#45; or make early withdrawals from their retirement plans &#45; to help their children afford college&#44; which hurts our economy. Millions with student loan debt are burdened by sky&#45;high interest rates. That is why I co&#45;sponsored the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act to give borrowers the opportunity to refinance at the same low rate offered to new borrowers.
Unfortunately&#44; Republicans blocked this bill in the Senate&#44; but the President took action to ease the burden of crushing student loan debt by allowing five million borrowers with federal student loans to cap their monthly payments at 10 percent of their income. I will keep fighting to make college more affordable for Lower Hudson Valley families&#44; including the many high school graduates in our area&#44; like those at recent graduations I attended at Sleepy Hollow and North Rockland High Schools.
Phasing out cosmetic testing on animals
The humane treatment of animals is among the responsibilities of a decent society. In the past 20 years&#44; many companies have phased out animal testing in favor of more accurate alternatives&#44; yet each year millions of animals still suffer through cosmetics testing. These tests are incredibly inhumane&#44; focusing on the effects of chemicals on animal eyes&#44; which is not effective in gauging the effects on humans. That is why I
co&#45;sponsored
the Humane Cosmetics Act &#40;H.R. 4148&#41;&#44; which would phase out cosmetic animal testing and the sale of cosmetics tested on animals.
