Wicker: Border Crisis Reflects
Lack
of Presidential
Leadership
Obama Administration, Senate Democrats
Ignore
Need for Substantive Immigration
Reform
Like many Americans, I am deeply troubled by the
crisis along our country's southwest border.
Since October of last
year, more than 50,000 unaccompanied minors have been intercepted
while trying to enter the United States illegally, overwhelming U.S.
immigration services and facilities.
One report indicates that an
estimated 90,000 children will attempt to cross the border this
year.
No one suggests that these child
migrants are undeserving of our sympathy.
Many have fled dire
circumstances in Central American countries plagued with grinding poverty
and ruthless gang violence.
But finding a solution to the surge
at the U.S.-Mexico border requires an honest look at what is driving
tens of thousands of people to break the law.
In doing so, we must
confront the consequences of the Obama Administration's misguided
immigration policies.
Executive Action Sends the Wrong
Signal
There is no
question that America's immigration system is in need of a major overhaul.
We cannot ignore the fact that there are more than 11 million
people living illegally in the United States today.
However, the
current situation does not justify unilateral executive action from
President Obama, who has pledged to circumvent Congress and "fix as much of
our immigration system as I can on my own."
The President's unauthorized actions have sent the
wrong signal to the world that those who arrive in the United States
unlawfully can escape enforcement of the law.
The Deferred Action
for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program is a prime example.
Created by the White House in 2012, the program allows young illegal
immigrants to apply for temporary amnesty and work
rights.
Situation Demands Leadership, Not Blank
Check
At a time for leadership and consensus, it is
disappointing that President Obama has called for more taxpayer dollars
to deal with the border crisis.
I am opposed to giving the
President a blank check when the situation demands meaningful policy
reforms.
I do not believe that throwing $2.7 billion at the problem
will solve it.
We will not stem the tide of illegal immigration
until we strengthen border security and change the policies that
incentivize families to send their children on a perilous journey to the
United States.
Senate Democrats Derail Potential
Compromise
For starters, I believe
Congress should use the power of the purse to defund the DACA
program.
I offered an amendment to the Democrats' spending bill that
would do just that.
However, Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid
(Nev.) again refused to allow a debate and up-or-down votes on
Republican proposals.
If senators had been allowed to offer amendments
to improve the bill, perhaps bipartisan consensus could have emerged.
Once again, the Majority Leader succeeded in shielding Senate
Democrats from difficult votes in an election
year.
Another piece of legislation, the Helping
Unaccompanied Minors and Alleviating National Emergency (HUMANE) Act,
would strengthen, streamline, and expedite the legal process for
unaccompanied minors at the border.
Introduced by Sen. John Cornyn
(R-Texas), the bill would improve a 2008 anti-trafficking law by ensuring
that children from Central America receive the same treatment as those
from Mexico.
I am a cosponsor of this legislation because it
would serve as a starting point for real reform, rather than a temporary
fix.
A crisis of this
magnitude demands that both political parties work together toward a
lasting solution.
Congress and the President have a responsibility
to address the nation's broken immigration system with effective policy
changes that make judicious use of taxpayer dollars.
