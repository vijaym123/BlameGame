Ensuring an
Open and Transparent Legislative
Process
Dear Friend,
Last Thursday, the U.S. House of
Representatives voted on a government
spending omnibus to establish the budget
for the 2015 fiscal year. Unfortunately,
Congress failed, once again, to follow an
open and transparent legislative process
and, instead, waited until the last minute
to cobble together a massive 1600-page $1.1
trillion spending omnibus for the U.S.
government
with only 48 hours given
for consideration.
The United States Constitution places
tremendous responsibility for spending
taxpayer dollars with the U.S. Congress.
Our laws and our legislative rules clearly
set forth a process by which the Congress
considers legislative proposals in a
deliberate and thoughtful manner. In this
process, legislative proposals are
presented, debated, amended, and ultimately
passed, or not. When this process is
followed in an open and transparent manner,
the Congress is not only properly
fulfilling its constitutional obligation,
but it is also much more likely to produce
a legislative product that best reflects
the will of the people whom we
represent.
At a time when so many Fifth District
Virginians are gravely concerned about our
staggering $18 trillion debt and about the
Presidents repeated unconstitutional
use of executive authority to spend
taxpayer dollars in a manner inconsistent
with the law, it is more important than
ever that we have a full and robust debate
on these issues. Sadly, when Congress fails
to live up to these constitutional
obligations, many of our constituents
conclude that Washington simply does not
care about the legacy we leave for our
children and grandchildren
indeed a
country poorer in every way. For these
reasons, I was unable to support the
government spending omnibus.
With the New Year comes a new Congress
and new opportunities to work together on
behalf of the people we represent. It is my
sincere hope that the new 114th Congress
will be committed to considering
legislation in an open and transparent
manner consistent with our obligations to
the Constitution and to our
constituents.
I look forward to continuing to work
with my colleagues in the House and our
colleagues in the Senate to promote
pro-growth policies, to reduce our debt,
and to ensure that we leave our children
and grandchildren with a better future.
