UPDATE: Days after suing President Obama, Boehner&rsquo;s barnstorming the country on a 35-day victory tour.
At his first stop on Monday, Boehner riled up a room of Republican donors by promising that &ldquo;Frankly, it&rsquo;s going to be a Republican year.&rdquo;
WE REFUSE TO LET BOEHNER BEAT US.
That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve set a huge goal:
In the final 100 days of this campaign, we want to motivate and mobilize 1 million new voters to defeat Boehner&rsquo;s Republicans.

Thanks to your amazing grassroots support, we&rsquo;ve been able to put 444 organizers on the ground to get-out-the-vote in 48 districts. But if we&rsquo;re going to reach 1 million new Democratic voters, we need to expand our program -- and quick.
We want to add another 200 organizers before the end of the month.
That means we&rsquo;re counting on you: 99% of our donations come from grassroots donors like you (with an average donation of just $22). And more than 90% of that money goes directly to helping elect Democrats in key races -- exactly what we have to do to fire Boehner.
David, will you be a part of the team? http://dccc.org/Founding-Member
