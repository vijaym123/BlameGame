Illinois Congressmen
introduce bill to bring fairness to the FEMA disaster declaration
process
On Thursday, Rep. Kinzinger joined with other members
of the Illinois delegation to introduce legislation that would bring
fairness to how the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
distributes relief funds following a natural disaster. Currently, many small
towns dont get the relief they need after a disaster due to an unfair
and arbitrary formula that puts many towns in the Sixteenth District at
a disadvantage. The legislation introduced this week, the Fairness in
Federal Disaster Declarations Act of 2014, fixes this problem by
distributing aid according to where the need is greatest, not by arbitrary
population numbers.

Kinzinger participates in concealed carry informational
event in Livingston County
Congressman Kinzinger on Friday
attended an informational event in Chatsworth aimed at informing
residents about Illinois' new concealed carry law. The event brought
together local law enforcement and elected officials to answer questions for
residents about the law and provide a forum for residents to sign up
for training classes.
Rep. Kinzinger speaks to listeners in Chatsworth
with State Rep. Josh Harms on Illinois' new concealed carry
law.
I think were at the
beginning of a better era in terms of understanding and recognizing your
right to keep and bear arms in Illinois, said Kinzinger. Its not
just the right to go hunting. Its the right to protect yourself and
protect your family and defend yourself from overreach. -

Pontiac Daily
Herald .
