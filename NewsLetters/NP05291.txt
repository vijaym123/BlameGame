Dear Friend,
If the GOP takes the Senate, they will control committee chairmanships until at least 2016.
Let&rsquo;s take a quick look at who the new GOP Senate chairs could be.
&ldquo;I do not think the science clearly supports global warming theory." - Sen. David Vitter, Committee on Environment and Public Works
"Is our national goal to place as many people on welfare, food stamp support, as we can possibly put on that program? Is that our goal?[...] I just ask that. I think we should wrestle with that question." - Sen. Jeff Sessions, Budget Committee
"I think video games is a bigger problem than guns, because video games affect people." - Sen. Lamar Alexander, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions
That&rsquo;s
the kind of leadership we can expect from a Republican-controlled Senate. We can&rsquo;t control what happens in other races, but we can control how hard we work. Give $5 and help our GOTV teams do what they do best from now through Election Day.

Or donate another amount.
All our work on equal pay, on raising the minimum wage, on punishing polluters and capping carbon emissions -- all that work gets put on hold if the Republicans take the Senate.
This is a political party that doesn&rsquo;t even acknowledge that equal pay, climate change, and income inequality are problems that need to be addressed. There&rsquo;s too much at stake to let them win. A Democratic majority in the Senate isn&rsquo;t possible if we don&rsquo;t keep Massachusetts blue. Help us get out the vote with a $5 contribution.
Thank you.
