Dear Friends,
I am pleased to support the
Veterans Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency
Act which would finally take steps to address the shameful delays in
healthcare our heroes have been experiencing across the nation. As you
know, tens of thousands of veteran patients have been waiting at least
90 days for appointments at VA medical facilities. Tragically, these
wait time delays may have been responsible for the deaths of 58
veterans. While the full extent of this tragedy is still being investigated,
it is important that we move swiftly to rectify the mismanagement and
lack of accountability plaguing the VA system.
The
Veterans Access to Care Act would allow veterans greater access to
healthcare outside the VA system that is failing them. The bill would
also require reports from the VA and independent assessors as to how
veterans are utilizing this new access and how the VA can improve its
current and future health care capabilities.
Finally,
the bill would ban bonuses for all VA employees until 2016 and give the
VA Secretary authority to fire failing
executives.
Embarrassingly, mismanagement at the VA facility in Miami is emblematic of the
overall failures of the VA system. My colleague Mario Diaz-Balart and I
recently met with the Miami VAs Director and Chief of Staff and
unfortunately, still have more questions and answers. Weve had security
lapses at our drug rehabilitation center which may have led to a
veterans death, reports of retaliation against whistleblowers, and long
wait times of our own. All of this is in addition to the 2009 Miami VA
scandal where botched colonoscopies may have exposed 2,500 of our
veterans to disease.
I am ashamed and embarrassed by the
way our veterans are being treated and am looking forward to the day
when the VA can finally get its act together. We must stop the
slow-walking, the lack of transparency, and work to fix these problems as
soon as possible
whether its the embarrassing disability claim
backlog, the absurd amounts of time our veterans are waiting for care, or the
way VA officials attempt to shift blame for their failures. While the
Veterans Access to Care Act is a solid step forward to getting our
veterans the first-class care they deserve, we as a nation can and must
do more.
Sincerely,
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
