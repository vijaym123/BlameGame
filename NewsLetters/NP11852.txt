News from Representative John Delaney
March 1, 2014
Dear Friend,
As March begins, I write to you in recognition of Women's History
Month. Here in Congress, I've made women's rights a top priority by
supporting legislation that prevents violence against women, cracks
down on unfair labor practices, and strengthens women's voting and
civic rights globally. This month, I'm proud to recognize women from
Maryland and across the United States who have made a difference in our
country.
In honor of Women's History Month, I will be taking to Facebook to
highlight the work and achievements of women. Every day this March, I'll
post a short account of another woman who made history
. Whether they fought for women's
suffrage or pushed our nation to the forefront of scientific discovery,
women deserve recognition for their important role in our heritage.
Please take a moment to let me know about a woman you would highlight
as part of Women's History Month
.
This year, I took a stand for women's rights by cosponsoring the
International Violence Against Women Act (IVAWA). This legislation
would establish an Office of Global Women's Issues to coordinate U.S.
government efforts regarding gender integration and advancing the
status of women and girls in our foreign policy. The new office would
maintain a focus on establishing and supporting laws and legal
structures that help prevent and respond to all forms of violence
against women and girls.
In addition to my support for legislation like IVAWA, I've acted as a
strong voice for foreign policy that recognizes the importance of
protecting the civic and human rights of women internationally. This
week, I issued a statement congratulating British Foreign Secretary
William Hague for his work to recognize and prevent the use of sexual
violence as a weapon of war. We must struggle tirelessly to improve the
status of women around the globe, and Secretary Hague's achievements
provide an important foundation for our continued work.
During my first term in Congress, I have also pushed for legislation
that addresses women's rights abuses and inequalities here in the
United States. As a President of the congressional freshman class, I
have cosponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 377) and the Equal Pay
Day Resolution (H. Con. Res. 28). Equal pay for equal work is a core
American value, and I was proud to have the opportunity to join more
than 100 other cosponsors to support gender parity in the work place.
As Women's History Month begins, I will call attention to the
contributions of American women as well as the continued challenges
that they face. While the United States has made critical progress
addressing gender inequalities, wage inequalities and even the gender
gap in Congress clearly demonstrate that we have work to do. As I
continue to take a stand on these issues in Washington, I welcome your
feedback
.
Sincerely,
John

News
from
Representative
John
Delaney
March
1,
2014
Dear
Friend,
As
March
begins,
I
write
to
you
in
recognition
of
Women&#8217;s
History
Month.
Here
in
Congress,
I&#8217;ve
made
women&#8217;s
rights
a
top
priority
by
supporting
legislation
that
prevents
violence
against
women,
cracks
down
on
unfair
labor
practices,
and
strengthens
women&#8217;s
voting
and
civic
rights
globally.
This
month,
I&#8217;m
proud
to
recognize
women
from
Maryland
and
across
the
United
States
who
have
made
a
difference
in
our
country.
In
honor
of
Women&#8217;s
History
Month,
I
will
be
taking
to
Facebook
to
highlight
the
work
and
achievements
of
women.
Every
day
this
March,
I&#8217;ll
post
a
short
account
of
another
woman
who
made
history .
Whether
they
fought
for
women&#8217;s
suffrage
or
pushed
our
nation
to
the
forefront
of
scientific
discovery,
women
deserve
recognition
for
their
important
role
in
our
heritage.
Please
take
a
moment
to
let
me
know
about
a
woman
you
would
highlight
as
part
of
Women&#8217;s
History
Month .
This
year,
I
took
a
stand
for
women&#8217;s
rights
by
cosponsoring
the
International
Violence
Against
Women
Act
(IVAWA).
This
legislation
would
establish
an
Office
of
Global
Women&#8217;s
Issues
to
coordinate
U.S.
government
efforts
regarding
gender
integration
and
advancing
the
status
of
women
and
girls
in
our
foreign
policy.
The
new
office
would
maintain
a
focus
on
establishing
and
supporting
laws
and
legal
structures
that
help
prevent
and
respond
to
all
forms
of
violence
against
women
and
girls.
In
addition
to
my
support
for
legislation
like
IVAWA,
I&#8217;ve
acted
as
a
strong
voice
for
foreign
policy
that
recognizes
the
importance
of
protecting
the
civic
and
human
rights
of
women
internationally.
This
week,
I
issued
a
statement
congratulating
British
Foreign
Secretary
William
Hague
for
his
work
to
recognize
and
prevent
the
use
of
sexual
violence
as
a
weapon
of
war.
We
must
struggle
tirelessly
to
improve
the
status
of
women
around
the
globe,
and
Secretary
Hague&#8217;s
achievements
provide
an
important
foundation
for
our
continued
work.
During
my
first
term
in
Congress,
I
have
also
pushed
for
legislation
that
addresses
women&#8217;s
rights
abuses
and
inequalities
here
in
the
United
States.
As
a
President
of
the
congressional
freshman
class,
I
have
cosponsored
the
Paycheck
Fairness
Act
(H.R.
377)
and
the
Equal
Pay
Day
Resolution
(H.
Con.
Res.
28).
Equal
pay
for
equal
work
is
a
core
American
value,
and
I
was
proud
to
have
the
opportunity
to
join
more
than
100
other
cosponsors
to
support
gender
parity
in
the
work
place.
As
Women&#8217;s
History
Month
begins,
I
will
call
attention
to
the
contributions
of
American
women
as
well
as
the
continued
challenges
that
they
face.
While
the
United
States
has
made
critical
progress
addressing
gender
inequalities,
wage
inequalities
and
even
the
gender
gap
in
Congress
clearly
demonstrate
that
we
have
work
to
do.
As
I
continue
to
take
a
stand
on
these
issues
in
Washington,
I
welcome
your
feedback .

John
