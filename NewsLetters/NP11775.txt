Dear Friend,
Florida is second only to Texas in the number of people who work full-time and yet hover near the poverty line. By raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, the Fair Minimum Wage Act would grow the paychecks of over 1.06 million Florida workers over the course of three years.*
Do you think Congress should vote on the Fair Minimum Wage Act?
I appreciate you taking the time to weigh in.
Thanks again,
Ted Deutch
