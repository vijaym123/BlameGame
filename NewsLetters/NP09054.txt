Eastern North Carolina Update with Congressman Walter B. Jones
WASHINGTON, D.C. - As we begin the month of June, I wanted to take the
time to update you on my recent work for Eastern North Carolina.
On May 3, I had the privilege of speaking at the ribbon-cutting
ceremony for the reconstructed pier in Morehead City used by the 824th
Transportation Company, U.S. Army Reserve. I am so grateful for the
service and sacrifice of all our men and women in uniform.
Holding the Government Accountable
*	I believe our veterans deserve the highest standard of physical
and mental care, which is why I voted on May 21 in favor of H.R. 4031
to hold the VA
accountable for its mistakes.
*	On May 22, I voted against a bill
that would legalize the government's mass collection of
phone records and emails.
I believe that we need to enact reforms that
require accountability in our information-gathering practices.
*	I voted on May 8
to hold Lois Lerner, the former head of the IRS
division responsible for unfairly targeting conservative groups, in
contempt of Congress, and I voted to call on Attorney General Eric
Holder to appoint a special counsel to investigate the IRS's unlawful
practices.
*	Also on May 8, I voted to create a select committee
to investigate the Benghazi attacks because I believe the
American people deserve the full truth - something that the president
has been unwilling to provide.
Growing the Economy and Protecting Jobs
*
As co-chair of the House Depot Caucus, I led the effort
in opposition to an amendment offered to the National Defense
Authorization Act that would have significantly reduced the future
workload of Fleet Readiness Center East in Craven County.
*	In Eastern North Carolina, we continue to see the negative
economic impact of unnecessary regulations related to the Endangered
Species Act.
I've cosponsored seven pieces of legislation
to modernize the law and prevent the implementation of those
regulations and the waste of taxpayer money.
*	I am speaking out against a proposed rule
that would aggressively expand the scope of
Environmental Protection Agency authority over private property.
This
rule runs counter to Supreme Court precedent, is based on flawed
scientific evidence, and would have a significant negative impact on
property owners in Eastern North Carolina - stifling the economy and
preventing job creation.
Working for the Eastern North Carolina Coast
*	I am pleased that months of negotiations resulted in the hiring
of summer lifeguards
for three Cape Hatteras National Seashore beaches.
Without that
option, vacationing families looking for the extra safety and security
that lifeguards provide may choose to go elsewhere, hurting the local
economy.
*	The Beaufort NOAA lab is an integral part of the local economy
and an important provider of scientific research affecting the entire
East Coast, which is why I am proud to have successfully worked with
the committee of jurisdiction to ensure that the lab receives funding
next year
.
Defending Eastern North Carolina Values
*	I applaud the Supreme Court
for their landmark decision in the case Town of Greece
v. Galloway, which confirmed that legislative prayer is lawful under
the Establishment Clause of the Constitution.
*	I believe that members of Congress have a responsibility to
wisely use the American people's money - especially at a time when our
nation is $17 trillion in debt. To that end, I've introduced a bill
that would prohibit members of
Congress from flying first class using taxpayer funds.
Thank you for taking the time to read about some of my work for the 3rd
District.

Eastern

Update
with
Congressman
Walter
B.
Jones
WASHINGTON,
D.C.
-
As
we
begin
the
month
of
June,
I
wanted
to
take
the
time
to
update
you
on
my
recent
work
for
Eastern
North
Carolina.
On
May
3,
I
had
the
privilege
of
speaking
at
the
ribbon-cutting
ceremony
for
the
reconstructed
pier
in
Morehead
City
used
by
the
824th
Transportation

U.S.
Army
Reserve.
I
am
so
grateful
for
the
service
and
sacrifice
of
all
our
men
and
women
in
uniform.
Holding
the
Government
Accountable I
believe
our
veterans
deserve
the
highest
standard
of
physical
and
mental
care,
which
is
why
I
voted
on
May
21
in
favor
of
H.R.

to
hold
the
VA
accountable
for
its
mistakes.
On
May
22,
I
voted
against
a

that
would
legalize
the
government&#8217;s
mass

of
phone

and

I
believe
that
we
need
to
enact
reforms
that
require
accountability
in
our

I

on
May
8
to

responsible
for
unfairly

Also
on

I

because
I

the
American

&#8211;
something
that
the

has
been
unwilling
to

Growing
the

and

As
co-chair
of
the
House
Depot
Caucus,
I
led
the
effort
in
opposition
to
an

offered
to
the
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
that
would
have
significantly
reduced
the
future
workload
of
Fleet
Readiness
Center
East
in
Craven
County.
In
Eastern
North
Carolina,
we
continue
to
see
the
negative
economic
impact
of
unnecessary
regulations
related
to
the
Endangered
Species
Act.
I&#8217;ve
cosponsored

to

the

and

the

of

and

against
a

Agency

This
rule
runs
counter
to
Supreme

precedent,
is
based
on

and
would
have
a
significant
negative
impact
on
property
owners
in
Eastern
North
Carolina
&#8211;
stifling
the
economy
and
preventing

Working

the
Eastern
North

Coast
I
am
pleased
that
months

resulted
in
the

provide
may
choose
to
go

hurting
the

The
Beaufort
NOAA
lab
is
an
integral
part
of
the
local
economy
and
an
important
provider
of
scientific
research
affecting
the
entire
East
Coast,
which
is
why
I
am
proud
to
have
successfully
worked
with
the
committee
of
jurisdiction
to
ensure
that
the
lab
receives
funding
next
year .
Defending
Eastern
North

Values I
applaud
the
Supreme
Court
for
their
landmark
decision
in
the
case
Town
of
Greece
v.
Galloway ,
which
confirmed
that
legislative
prayer
is
lawful
under
the
Establishment

I

that
members

a

&#8211;
especially

I&#8217;ve
