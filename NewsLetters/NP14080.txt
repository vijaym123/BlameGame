Medicare Open Enrollment Reminder
Dear Friend,
Medicare is critical to the health and security of American seniors,
including 2.4 million Pennsylvanians. This year, Medicare's annual open
enrollment period will end on December 7th. To ensure that you and your
family members have access to the wide range of benefits available
through Medicare, my district offices have been hosting counselors from
APPRISE, Pennsylvania's free health insurance counseling program,
throughout the open enrollment period. A limited number of appointments
are still available in my Philadelphia and Montgomery County offices.
Medicare's annual open enrollment period should not be confused with
the new Health Insurance Marketplace on HealthCare.gov. The Insurance
Marketplace does not impact seniors with Medicare coverage.
During Medicare's open enrollment period, seniors have the option to:
*	Change from Original Medicare to Medicare Advantage Plan, or
from Medicare Advantage Plan to Original Medicare.
*	Switch from one Medicare Advantage Plan to another.
*	Switch from a Medicare Advantage Plan that doesn't offer drug
coverage to one that does.
*	Join a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan.
*	Switch from one Medicare Prescription Drug Plan to another.
*	Drop Medicare prescription drug coverage.
If you can't attend one of my counseling sessions, but have questions
regarding choosing or enrolling into a plan, you can also find a
listing of other area events on the Pennsylvania Department of Aging's
website
or contact my office for assistance.
I am proud that my district offices have helped more than 1,000
constituents in the 13th Congressional District in ensuring access to
Medicare. My district staff is also available to provide assistance
with matters such as:
*	Applying for Social Security Disability applications
*	Veterans services and benefits
*	IRS Issues
As always, it is a privilege to represent you in Congress.
Sincerely,
Allyson Y. Schwartz
Member of Congress
