House to Establish Select Committee
on Benghazi
Today, Speaker of the House John
Boehner announced that the House will establish a
Select Committee
to investigate the September 11, 2012 attack in
Benghazi.
As an original cosponsor of
H.
Res 36 -legislation establishing the Select Committee to investigate
the attack - I applaud Speaker Boehner for todays bold move to
further investigate what happened in Benghazi.
After
months of stonewalling, this Administration continues to hold back the
truth surrounding the deadly Benghazi attacks from the American
people.
The families of the four brave Americans who lost their lives that
night deserve straight answers about exactly what happened. Congress
will not stop until all the questions are answered and the truth about
exactly what occurred on September 11, 2012 finally
surfaces.
Working to Create Energy
Independence
This week, along with a group of 7 bipartisan colleagues, I
introduced legislation aimed at continuing vital funding for research and
development at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) in
Morgantown, W.Va.
The critical research NETL provides
benefits our environment and energy security, plus it keeps energy prices for
consumers affordable while leading to energy independence. Funding
for NETL results in affordable, safe and clean ways to enhance and
utilize our domestic fossil fuels.
The Department of Energys
Fossil Energy Research and Development Program supports more than
1,000 projects that contribute nearly $7 billion dollars annually to the
American economy and supports more than 55,000 jobs
nationwide.
The program, based in Morgantown, W.Va., is currently developing
advanced technologies to support a competitive future for our coal and
gas resources for use in power generation and industries around the
world. It also strengthens Americas global industrial
competitiveness.
Protecting Veterans and Veterans
Benefits
Service men and women who sacrificed on behalf of
our country deserve our full support and the benefits promised to them.
This week, the House voted to increase the budget of the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) to make sure these promises are kept. This bill
will also help to clean up the long wait times and backlogs of
benefits claims in the VA.
This
bipartisan
legislation
passed with a nearly unanimous vote, 416-1. In addition to
funding our veterans benefits and programs, this bill also contains
funding to help train and equip our troops, provide housing and
services to military personnel and their families, and maintain base
infrastructure.
The funding in this legislation provides the peace
of mind and quality of life for our military, as well as ensures that
our veterans receive the benefits that they
deserve.
