Congressman Lamborn Participates in First House-Senate VA Conference
Committee Meeting
6/24/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn
took part in the first meeting of the joint House-Senate VA
Conference Committee Meeting. Congressman Lamborn was
selected by House Leadership to be one of eight
Republican members of the Conference Committee to address the
differences between House and Senate VA healthcare reform legislation. This
conference committee will draft final legislation to hold people
accountable in the VA and provide veterans the timely access to quality care
they need.

Text of Congressman
Lamborn's Opening Statement
Id like to thank the Chairmen and Ranking Members of both
the House and Senate VA Committees for your leadership on this
issue.
Its an honor to be a member of this conference committee and I
look forward to working with you
all.
The lack of transparency at the VA and the very nature
of data manipulation and secret wait lists have made it very difficult
to reveal the true nature of the horrors facing our veterans.
There are almost 100,000 veterans living in my district.
In an
effort to find out what they are seeing Ive held conference calls with
local VSO leaders.
Ive spoken directly with the facility
directors that serve them and asked, Are there secret wait lists in Denver
or Colorado Springs.
Weve subpoenaed documents and testimony,
heard from countless witnesses from the VA, and my colleagues and I
have sent multiple letters to the VA demanding answers.
At first
the VA attempted to downplay the significance and extent of the
problem.
Only through the efforts of whistleblowers, brave individuals
from across the country that have taken great risk to expose the
truth, has the depth of the issues at the VA come to light.
Subsequently, the interim VA-OIG report validated those whistleblower claims
and has labeled them as systemic.
Yesterday, the VAs bimonthly access data showed that the
electronic wait list for the VA Medical Center in Denver that provides
care for many of my constituents, had more than doubled since their
last report two weeks ago.
This problem is not getting better,
its getting worse.
We cannot kick this can down the road.
We
cannot simply seek to create an assembly line that gets veterans in
and out faster without regard to the quality of care.
Ultimately
we must focus on changes that yield better healthcare outcomes for our
veterans through timely access to quality care.
In order to
achieve this and ensure that the solutions are enduring, there are
multiple items that have to be
addressed.
Obviously we must pave the way for the VA to use non-VA
care to expand veteran access and clear the current backlog.
But this problem cannot, and should not, be fixed by simply throwing
money at it.
The VA has had more medical-care funding than it could
spend during each of the last four fiscal years, to include $1.4B as
recently as 2010, and was set to carry over $450M this year before
dipping into those funds for the current Accelerating Access to Care
Initiative.
This has led to multiple testimonies by VA and non-VA
witnesses who have noted that the biggest issue that has led to this
crisis is not a lack of funding, but a lack of
accountability.
For this reason, the
legislation that we mold must hold individuals accountable who fail to
meet performance standards and oversee mismanagement and neglect.
The perverse incentives that have led to the manipulation of scheduling
data and secret lists must be removed and any incentives going
forward must have an impact on improving patient satisfaction, outcomes, and
provider performance and
productivity.
Finally, our ultimate product must protect
whistleblowers that step forward to share the truth.
The last thing they
should face for bravely standing up for our veterans is
retribution.
As I said
before, the end result of our efforts must be
timely access to
quality care for our veterans.
This is what our
veterans have earned, and they deserve nothing
less.
