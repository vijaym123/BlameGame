We&rsquo;re nearly out of time -- so we won&rsquo;t waste any. Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s $1.85 MILLION ad campaign against us -- the biggest of the election so far -- starts TOMORROW. Here&rsquo;s what that means:
our fundraising needs have skyrocketed. We need 92 more donations by midnight tonight to fight back for Brad.
If we don&rsquo;t hit this goal, we could be in serious danger. We hate to keep asking, but we need you to chip in before midnight. Are you in? Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
29 days left -- no time to lose.
