Listening To Pennsylvania
When the Senate is in recess, I travel our Commonwealth to meet with as many Pennsylvanians as possible to hear their concerns and ideas. I hope you'll take a moment to see what issues we've discussed this week. Thank you and, as always, it is an honor to serve as your senator.
Fighting Prescription Drug Abuse

In Washington County, I joined District Attorney Eugene Vittone and U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania David Hickton to address the growing problem of
prescription drug and opiate abuse.
The scope of this abuse is stunning. It's happening to people of all age groups, ethnicities, and backgrounds. According to a
study
from the Trust for America's Health, the number of drug overdose deaths in Pennsylvania has increased by 89 percent since 1999.
In the Senate, I am leading
a bipartisan effort
with Senators Tom Carper (D-DE), Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) to curb Medicare fraud and the abuse of prescription drugs.
Visiting Reading Hospital
With Congressman Joe Pitts, I toured Reading Hospital, which has one of the busiest emergency rooms in our state. Visits like these help me learn from Pennsylvania health care experts and inform my judgment so I can make constructive decisions back in Washington.

Learning About Worker Training at Philly's IBEW Local 98
In Philadelphia on Thursday, I visited the IBEW Local 98 training facility to learn more about their union apprenticeship and worker training program.
The federal government's worker training efforts are
a confusing maze of more than 50 different programs . While some of these programs might be effective, the overlap and duplication are a waste of taxpayer money. There's a lot that Washington can learn from IBEW Local 98's program. I look forward to engaging my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and improving the way we train Pennsylvanian workers for today's economy.
At the Williamson Free School in Media, I also learned about a worker training program that requires no government funding. At this post-secondary school, young people can earn an associate's degree in carpentry and other trades - for free.
