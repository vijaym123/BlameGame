Battling the Crisis on our Southern
Border
6/18/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn took two
important steps regarding the ongoing crisis on our southern
border.
First, he inserted language
into the Defense Appropriations Act to increase the funding available
to the Army National Guard to help address the illegal immigration
crisis currently taking place at our southern border. The Congressman
accomplished this by transferring funding from the staffing needs of the
Secretary of Defense into the funds for the Army National
Guard.

Secondly, the Congressman cosponsored the Southwest
Border Protection Act. This legislation calls for the deployment of at
least 10,000 members of the U.S. National Guard at the request of any
Governor of a State that shares a portion of the international border
between the U.S. and Mexico. Guardsmen and women would serve as support
for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection operations, and remain in
place until we have obtained control of our southern border.
"The primary role of
the federal government is to provide for our national security and
securing our southwest border is a vital part of this overall mission."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
(CO-05)
