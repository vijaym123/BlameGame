Friend,
Did you see the news yesterday? The House of Representatives, under John Boehner&#39;s leadership, voted to sue the President of the United States.
This is an unprecedented and outrageous action. They wasted taxpayer time and money on a fruitless political stunt.
This is NOT why Ami went to Congress.
Ami went to Congress deal with real issues that affect real people - from immigration reform, to climate change, to taking care of our seniors and veterans.
THAT is what Congress should be focused on. THAT is what matters.
Instead, we see a ludicrous vote to sue our President.
That&#39;s why deadlines like tonight&#39;s matter-- we need to keep Ami in Congress to fight for us.
John Boehner wants to add to his ranks-- he&#39;s hand-picked Doug Ose for our district and has already pledged nearly $1 million to support him.

We must demand better.
That&#39;s why we&#39;re working so hard to get Ami re-elected.
Boehner is counting on Doug Ose this fall, and even though they&#39;re pouring in millions, we can fight back.
We have $836 to go to hit our goal.
Chip in a few dollars right now.
Help us send a message.
Thanks,
Team Bera
PS --
The ability to self-fund combined with a commitment of close to $1,000,000 from John Boehner&#39;s political arm -
Doug Ose wants to join their ranks in Congress.
He has them - we have you. Click here and give $5 now.
