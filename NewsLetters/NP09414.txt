Protecting Military Religious Freedom, Prohibiting
Funding for the New START Treaty, and More NDAA
Amendments
5/22/14
On the House Floor this week, Congressman Lamborn
had six more amendments adopted into the final language of
the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act. The full 2015 National Defense
Authorization Act passed the House by a bipartisan vote of 325 to 98.
Of particular importance is language mandating a rewriting of overly
strict Department of Defense and Air Force regulations regarding
religious freedom in the military. This passed unanimously and directs
the DOD and Air Force to rewrite existing regulations to ensure that
verbal and written expressions of individual faith are protected by new
regulations.
"It is unacceptable to me that our men
and women who defend our Constitution do not currently enjoy all the
protections of the Constitution. Changes to internal regulations must be
made in order for religious freedom to be fully protected for the
members of our military."
- Congressman Doug Lamborn (CO-05)

Supporting Military Religious Freedom
The United States should
not be spending money to disarm ourselves
to dramatically cut our
strategic nuclear deterrent
if the other party to the treaty requiring
these cuts is verifiably dishonest. The Russian Federation is clearly
not trustworthy. Their actions in Ukraine and violation of agreements
such as the INF Treaty and CFE Treaty should be cause for great
concern. Vladimir Putin is a serial treaty violator who should not be trusted
with Americas national security.
I am pleased that the House adopted my resolution by an
overwhelming, bipartisan majority.

Lamborn (CO-05)

Amendment
ADDITIONAL
AMENDMENTS
An amendment
establishing the sense of Congress that national security
functions, such as military training and exercises, should be a top
priority, particularly when land owned by the US government is to be used.
W e must
be smart about how and where the military trains in order to preserve
our pristine national parks; however we must also remember that the
first job of the federal government is to protect our
nation.
An amendment
ensuring that the Afghan government does not levy illegal taxes
against companies supporting our military men and women taking part in
Operation Enduring Freedom. This has cost American companies at least
a billion dollars that should be recovered from
Afghanistan.
An amendment giving additional authority to the non-profit
Air Force Academy Athletics Corporation to allow them to supply
equipment and services to the athletics teams, including supporting travel.
These changes will allow the AFAAC to provide better support to
the student-athletes at the Air Force Academy and will save taxpayer
funds. This is because the AFAAC has access to private sector fundraising
efforts to support Air Force Academy
Athletics.
An
amendment prohibiting funding for the implementation of the New START Treaty
(calling for a reduction in our nuclear capabilities) until Russia
withdraws from
Ukraine.
An amendment requiring the Director of
National Intelligence to produce a public report on the
political and
economic corruption among senior Russian leaders, including an
analysis of potentially illegal attainment of financial
assets.
