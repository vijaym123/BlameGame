Senator Johnson Votes in Favor of VA
Bill
"I opposed
the original Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability,
and Transparency Act of 2014 because it was a fiscally irresponsible
bill, rushed to the floor by Sen. Reid without proper vetting.
Only minutes before the vote, the Congressional Budget Office provided
a partial estimate of the bills cost, estimating that one section of
the bill alone would cost taxpayers an additional $435 billion over 10
years." Read more

diagnosis, wrong
cure

mess of 2,300 pages that spawned uncounted pages of new regulations.
