.
I will also reintroduce a number of proposed reforms to the federal grand jury process, including the Grand Jury Reform Act (H.R. 5830) - which would prohibit the use of out-of-public-view grand jury hearings when it comes to cases where a police officer has killed a citizen. The bill also would require an outside prosecutor to investigate officers in such cases.
Police officers perform difficult jobs often under great stress - and 99 percent of police officers fulfill their duty to protect and serve. But after the grand jury decisions in the cases of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, both of which declined to present formal charges against two police officers involved with their deaths, a growing movement has begun to call for changes in the grand jury process. I'm leading the legislative push to create a more equitable system of justice. For more, click HERE .
PASSING THE $40 MILLION MARK: Since taking office in 2007, my office has worked to help secure more than $40 million for constituents seeking help with federal agencies. Helping constituents solve difficult problems is what my district office does every day. I'm proud that my staff has been able to help so many constituents receive the money and benefits due them from the federal government. Taking care of home first is my first priority.

OVERCOMERS HOUSE: Overcomers House is holding the Ella Fountain Holiday Basket Giveaway on Saturday, Dec. 20, 2014, at 2 p.m. in Snellville. Baskets include: turkey, hen or ham with trimmings, uncooked. For more, e-mail them at info@myovercomershouse.com
or call 678-575-6608.
HOMELESS VETERANS: I'm happy to report that the DeKalb County Housing Authority is receiving more than $87,000 to help homeless veterans and their families put a roof over their heads. While it's a modest sum, it will help build on the more than $10 million the district has received since 2012 to help homeless veterans.

Dear
F riends,
In the spirit of peace and goodwill toward all men and women, I want to wish you and your family, loved ones and friends a happy holiday season and a joyous and Happy New Year!
PREPARING FOR THE 114TH CONGRESS:
As my staff and I pivot to the new Congress that will be sworn in on Jan. 5, I want you to be aware of some of the legislation I expect to reintroduce early in 2015 that
deals with the militarization of the nation&#8217;s local police agencies and grand jury reform.
The Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act of 2014 (H.R. 5478) is a bipartisan bill I introduced with Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho). It would place restrictions and transparency measures on the Department of Defense
(DOD) program that transfers surplus military equipment straight from the battlefield to state and local law enforcement agencies. I intend to refile this bipartisan legislation early in 2015. For more, click
HERE .
I will also reintroduce a number of proposed reforms to the federal grand jury process, including the Grand Jury Reform Act (H.R. 5830) &#8211; which would prohibit the use of out-of-public-view grand jury hearings
when it comes to cases where a police officer has killed a citizen. The bill also would require an outside prosecutor to investigate officers in such cases.
Police officers perform difficult jobs often under great stress &#8211; and 99 percent of police officers fulfill their duty to protect and serve. But after the grand jury decisions in the cases of Eric Garner and
Michael Brown, both of which declined to present formal charges against two police officers involved with their deaths, a growing movement has begun to call for changes in the grand jury process. I&#8217;m leading the legislative push to create a more equitable
system of justice. For more, click
