The spread of Ebola from West Africa to the United States in recent weeks has shown just how serious of a problem this disease is for our nation and the world.
In order to prevent the further spread of this disease, we must act as a leader in the international community to set specific standards and protocols to ensure that this disease does not disperse further into the U.S. population.
I want to hear your thoughts on how we should address this important matter.
Please take a moment to
fill out my survey
on the Ebola threat and let me know how you think our nation should combat the spread of this disease.
