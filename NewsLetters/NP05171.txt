Forbes: ICE Cover Up of Aggravated Felons Release
Is Dangerous &amp; Concerning
Washington, D.C.
- Congressman J. Randy Forbes (VA-04) issued the following statement in response to records confirming that a number of the over 2,000 undocumented immigrants the Administration released were aggravated felons.
The fact that ICE would release thousands of undocumented immigrants
including violent offenders and individuals who have faced serious criminal charges
and then blatantly deny the severity of these offenses to the American people and to Members of Congress is not only deeply concerning, it is dangerous. The United States government has a duty to be transparent and accountable, and to prioritize protecting the citizens it serves. This is an egregious example of an abdication of that responsibility.
Last year, during a House Judiciary Committee hearing, Congressman Forbes questioned then-ICE Director John Morton directly for specifics on the criminal records of the people the agency had freed, asking, "No one on that list has been charged or convicted with murder, rape or sexual abuse of a minor, were they?" Director Morton answered, "They were not." Watch a video of the questioning,
here .
In addition to the misleading testimony, in response to written inquiries regarding the release of the undocumented immigrants, Forbes office received written communication from ICE specifically stating, Detainees with serious criminal histories are a detention priority and have not been released.
