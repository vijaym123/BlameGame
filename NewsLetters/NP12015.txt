Dear
Friends,
Welcome to the latest
edition of my e-newsletter.
STATE WORK PERIOD: TOWN HALL MEETINGS AND
MORE
This month, I had the
privilege of spending more quality time in my favorite place, Idaho.
During February, I was able to travel our state, making many stops
throughout the Treasure and Magic Valley areas, as well as north and eastern
Idaho.
Thank you to those who came out to participate in the
public town halls I hosted, the Chamber of Commerce and Rotary Club
lunches and other various events.
It is always refreshing to
hear common sense from Idahoans on the many critical issues facing our
nation.
I value your feedback highly and continue to encourage
you and your peers to speak out on the issues pending before
Congress.
To continue the many conversations started during my travels,
please reach out to any of
my seven
offices
for comments or questions.

During a stop in Moscow, I was able to meet with Mayor Bill
Lambert to discuss issues affecting Moscow and the greater Palouse
region.
I had the opportunity to tour Northwest River
Supplies in Moscow with owner Bill Parks.

During
a stop in Nampa, I sat down with the Idaho Press Tribunes editorial
board to discuss the happenings in Washington.
I had the opportunity to meet with the
Director of the Nampa Family Justice Center, Criselda
DeLaCruz-Valdez.
Magic Valley
During a
stop in Gooding, I had the chance to visit with folks at a Chamber of
Commerce lunch.
I had the opportunity
to host a mini-town hall in Twin Falls.
It is always great to
see Idahoans actively engaged in our nations political
discourse.
I had a great time speaking to Gooding High School students
about Congress and the legislative process.
I was fortunate to tour Glanbia Foods
Cheese Innovation Center and discuss Idaho jobs with Glanbia CEO Jeff
Williams.
Eastern Idaho
I spoke to the members of the
Pocatello business community at the Mystique Theater in
Chubbuck.
During a stop in Idaho Falls, I met with Idaho
Falls Mayor Rebecca Casper, Ammon Mayor Dana Kirkham and city
representatives to discuss issues of local importance.
I visited with Sarah Hibbert, Distinguished Young Woman
of Pocatello/Chubbuck, during a luncheon with business and community
leaders at the Mystique Theater in Chubbuck.
Sarah did an
excellent job singing the National Anthem for the program.
I was lucky to visit a kindergarten classroom at
Chief Tahgee Elementary Academy in Fort Hall.
FARM BILL: Supporting Idaho Agriculture And
Forest Industries
Congress put forth a
long-overdue Farm Bill this month with the support of the entire Idaho
Congressional Delegation.
The measure, though imperfect because of
the high price tag, is a far cry from the status-quo and offers
much-needed reforms to strengthen risk management tools.
Idahos
agricultural community needs a farm bill, and this legislation will help
producers to continue providing a safe and abundant food
supply.
The five-year Farm Bill
consolidates conservation programs, slashes $23 billion in federal spending
and streamlines other duplicative federal programs.
Unfortunately, an opportunity was missed to enact more reforms relating to the
food stamp program.
Agriculture producers did their part to make
sacrifices that will lower spending, but the nutrition title, which
comprises approximately three quarters of the bills price tag, should
have received much more scrutiny.
With Idahos status as a prime producer of pulse
crops, I strongly advocated to include a new provision to promote healthy
Idaho pulse cropsdry beans, dry peas, lentils and chickpeasin school
lunch programs through a five-year pilot program.
Additionally,
the final bill authorizes the Pulse Health Initiative, which I have
long championed, that will support expanded research into the health
and nutritional benefits of pulse crops.
The importance of the Farm Bill to Idaho
cannot be overstated.
But, even with its passage, we must continue to
find ways to implement further market-based reforms that create an
environment for growth, eliminate unnecessary obstacles for producers
and continue to reduce the budget deficit.

and the positive provisions essential to Idaho that I advocated for in
this bill,

WE MUST IMPROVE WILDFIRE
RESOURCES
U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell joined
the entire Idaho Congressional Delegation in Boise to discuss changing
the way fighting wildfires on public lands is
funded.
Each year, Idaho continues to face
record-breaking fire seasons.
The National Interagency Fire Center
reports that as of November 7, 2013, there were 1,456 wildland fires in
Idaho that burned 714,057 acres last year alone.
As more
resources go toward fire suppression, other resources that could be used to
implement projects that improve forest health, benefit forest
communities and enhance public safety are squeezed.
To improve the
health of our federal lands, decrease the threat of catastrophic fires and
ensure that firefighters have the resources needed to protect our
communities, I joined fellow Idaho Senator Jim Risch and Oregon Senator
Ron Wyden to introduce a bill to improve the way wildfire suppression is
funded, without increasing federal funding.
The legislation
accomplishes this by treating the most devastating of wildfires in bad
fire years like the disasters that they are by classifying them under a
disaster categorysimilar to hurricanes and other natural
disasters.
As we prepare
for yet another fire season, it is better to take steps now that will
put us on improved footing and ensure that those protecting our
communities have the resources necessary to decrease the threat of fires and
respond to wildland fires.
Firefighters, land managers and
forested communities deserve assurance that steps will be taken to
continually improve the federal response to wildfires, one that can both create
jobs and improve the health of our public lands.
This
legislation would assist with that effort.

ADMINISTRATION SHORT-CHANGING 70,000
IDAHOANS WHO RELY ON MEDICARE
ADVANTAGE
Last Friday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS) announced yet another round of cuts to the successful
Medicare Advantage (MA) program for 2015.
As a result of Obamacare,
over the next two years MA will see roughly $45.5 billion in cuts, in
addition to the new reductions proposed by CMS.
For Idaho seniors
who are enrolled and benefitting from MA plans, this means increased
premiums, limited provider networks and in many cases cancelled
plans.
Idaho has one of the higher percentages of seniors nationwide
that utilize MA coverage.
The Administrations continued effort to force seniors into the
one-size fits all insurance that is traditional Medicare by singling
out the competitive MA program through targeted reductions is
troubling.
Over 15 million Americans and over 70,000 Idahoans are
enrolled in the popular MA plans which typically offer broader benefits and
more innovative health care.
Medicare Advantage is a viable
option for seniors and can offer more flexibility, while providing
beneficiaries with more control over their specific needs and health care
choices.
Unfortunately, the many seniors enrolled in these plans could become
the latest victims of the presidents broken promise, if you like
your plan, you can keep it.
In an effort to urge CMS from making
additional cuts to the program, I led a bipartisan coalition of forty
senators in writing to CMS in support of MA and the beneficiaries who
enjoy these plans.
