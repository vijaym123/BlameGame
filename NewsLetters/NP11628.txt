Dear Friend,
This week, the President proposed his 2015 budget plan, I met with
several groups of young Memphians in Washington, and the Deputy
Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration made the false
claim that "every single parent" opposes marijuana. Keep reading to

Helping Young Memphis Foster Children
Yesterday, I met with several young adults from Memphis who had been
through the foster care system and were in Washington representing
Youth Villages at the White House with the First Lady. Youth Villages
is a non-profit organization that has partnered with the Tennessee
Department of Children's Services to help former foster children by
offering comprehensive services to foster children who have aged out of
state custody. National studies have found that, with limited resources
and support, these young people are more likely than their peers to end
up homeless or incarcerated and less likely to have a job or go to
college. The programs offered by Youth Villages aim to prevent these
outcomes and promote success. The organization's transitional living
program was founded in 1999 by the late Clarence Day, a Memphis
philanthropist, and has since expanded to help more than 5,000 young
adults.

White House" music series on Thursday.
Expanding Opportunity for All Americans
President Obama proposed his Fiscal Year 2015 budget plan this week to
help create jobs across the country, preserve social security for our
seniors, make higher education more affordable for families, cut taxes
for hardworking Americans, and ensure that everyone who plays by the
rules and works hard gets a fair shot. The President's plan also
continues our commitment to reducing the country's deficit.
President Obama's proposed budget also invests in infrastructure
projects like Main2Main, which is good news for Memphis, as is his plan
to increase funding for local communities to reduce their rape kit
backlogs, keep predators off our streets, and bring justice to victims.
I hope that House Republican leadership will put obstruction and
partisanship aside to join us in passing this budget.
Fighting for a Sane Criminal Policy
At a House Committee hearing about federal drug policies which unfairly
hurt minority communities and have resulted in 4 times as many African
Americans arrested as Caucasians, I was able to question the Deputy
Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Thomas
Harrigan about his views on federal marijuana. I was surprised to hear
that he believes that "every single parent" opposes marijuana and that
the drug, which is now legal for medical or personal use in nearly half
of the United States, "insults our common values." When I pressed him
for more information, he tried to backtrack his comments and wasn't
able to provide backup for either of his claims. You can watch me
questioning Deputy Director Harrigan here
.
Like the rest of our federal government when it comes to marijuana, the
DEA is out of touch with reality. They haven't kept up with the
science, they haven't kept up with the medical community, and they sure
haven't kept up with the American people. When a law is almost
universally perceived as wrong, it breeds disrespect for our legal
system. Americans young and old think federal marijuana policy is a
joke. They know that marijuana shouldn't be in the same category with
heroin, and they don't support taking one's liberty away because of
marijuana.
Among other problems with our drug laws, our nation's marijuana policy
is deeply rooted in racism. 80 years ago it was based on fear of
Hispanic immigrants, then Nixon played up raced based fears to garner
votes all while his administration lied about marijuana's health
effects. When marijuana was placed on Schedule 1, it was supposed to be
temporary until the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse
(known as the Shafer Commission) reported its findings on the drug.
That was 1970. The Commission's 1972 report recommended decriminalizing
marijuana possession, though that recommendation was never acted upon.
Last month, the Shafer Commission's Assistant Director Richard Bonnie
said: "Frankly, I am astonished that criminal penalties continue to be
prescribed and imposed for simple possession of marijuana. It is long
past time to repeal them."
It is imperative that we take an honest look at why we have the drug
laws we have today and how and why they should be changed. To
paraphrase Maya Angelou---when we know better, we should do better.
2014 White House Easter Egg Roll
As part of their ongoing effort to open the People's House to as many
people as possible, the President and First Lady have announced that
this year's White House Easter Egg Roll will be held on Monday, April
21st. In support of the First Lady's Let's Move!
initiative to help kids grow up healthy and
have the
opportunity to reach their full potential, the event will feature
sports courts, cooking stations, and, of course, Easter egg rolling in
addition to live music and storytelling.
Tickets to the White House Easter Egg Roll, a tradition that dates back
to 1878, will be distributed through an online lottery system which
opened this morning and will close on Monday, March 10that 9:00AM CT.
You can enter the lottery here
Tickets are free of charge and are non-transferable. Full details can
be found at www.WhiteHouse.gov/EasterEggRoll
and www.recreation.gov
.
Protecting Women's Rights
I am proud that I was recently awarded with a perfect score from NARAL
Pro-Choice America for my votes in 2013. It is an honor to be
recognized for my record protecting women's rights and health care
choices. While there are some in Congress who want to repeal the last
50 years' worth of advances in reproductive rights, I will continue to
stand with women and do whatever I can to make sure no one tramples on
their rights.
Supporting the DREAM Act and Immigration Reform
I was pleased to meet with a handful of Memphis students who were in
Washington to push for the passage of the DREAM Act and comprehensive
immigration reform, both of which I support. I will continue to urge
Speaker Boehner to bring both measures to the floor for a vote, and I
hope he does so as soon as possible.
Stopping Iran from Acquiring Nuclear Weapons
After more than a decade of foreign wars, no one thinks we should get
into another military conflict, which is why this week I joined a
bipartisan Congressional letter to President Obama supporting his
diplomatic efforts to get Iran to abandon its nuclear weapons
ambitions. However, that country's history of delay and deceptions
raises serious concerns that they may use prolonged diplomatic
negotiations to bolster their economy while continuing their progress
towards weapons of mass destruction-so it is important that the United
States keep all options on the table including stronger sanctions to do
all that we can to change Iran's calculations and make sure they follow
through and honestly negotiate with us. Our letter strongly urges the
President to keep Congress informed of his progress so that we can
swiftly consider additional sanctions if they become necessary.
Building a Healthier Memphis
Among the many benefits of the Affordable Care Act is free preventive
care for services like mammograms that can detect breast cancer. A New
York Times story
noted that Memphis is "the deadliest major
American city for African-American women with breast cancer."
The racial disparity in breast cancer outcomes is deplorable, but we
can take steps to reduce it. A primary reason for the high mortality
rate among African American women is late diagnosis, when the disease
is harder to treat and has much lower survival rates. That's why I
launched my "Building a Healthier Memphis" series on wellness in the
Ninth District by hosting an expert panel discussion and education
session about this disparity and what we can do to address it and
improve outcomes for victims of breast cancer in our city. I'm
encouraged by all of the Memphians who attended the event to learn how
they can help improve their own health and the health of their families
and communities, and I look forward to hosting the next "Building a
Healthier Memphis" event at Church Health Center Wellness on Saturday,
April 12that 10 AM.
Everyone in the Ninth District should know that provisions of the
President's Affordable Care Act enable them to get mammograms with no
co-pays or deductibles. Taking advantage of the Affordable Care Act
could help save lives in our city and around the country. And don't
forget that the open season deadline to enroll in health coverage for
this year at HealthCare.gov
is March 31st.
Fully Funding the HOPE Scholarships
Over the last 10 years, the HOPE Scholarship program that I worked for
20 years as a State Senator to create has been an outstanding success
that has provided $2.9 billion to Tennessee's best and brightest. And
while this funding has been critical to helping students attend college
and complete 4-year degrees, the HOPE Scholarship has never fully
funded college scholarships, as intended, because state lawmakers have
not allowed it to keep up with the skyrocketing cost of higher
education.
Today's HOPE Scholarships pay a smaller portion of college costs than
it did 10 years ago and, if Governor Haslam's newly-announced plan to
slash the first two years of HOPE Scholarships by 25% is implemented,
it will provide even smaller scholarships for freshmen and sophomores.
The first two years of college are crucial for students finding their
way. With scholarships paying a smaller portion of tuition, families
will have to pay more and students may need to work more hours while
juggling their scholastic responsibilities, making academic success and
retention of the HOPE Scholarship more difficult. Today's college
students are graduating with more student loan debt than ever before,
crippling their chances of economic success.
To ensure that HOPE Scholarships continue to help Tennessee's students
afford college and succeed, the program must keep pace with the rising
cost of higher education. But the Governor's newly-announced "Tennessee
Promise" actually cuts funding from high-achieving students beginning
4-year degree programs. I am extremely concerned and remain cautious
about any plan that would make it harder for our state's proven young
people to begin attending the best universities in Tennessee, or any
plan that places additional financial burden on schools like the
University of Memphis which are already struggling to keep costs down
and provide high-quality educations.
Rather than raiding the scholarship fund's excess to create a new
government program, those funds should be used to provide full HOPE
scholarships. Tennesseans voted to repeal our state's constitutional
prohibition on lotteries based on the idea of replicating the success
of Georgia's successful HOPE program which provides full college
scholarships. That promise to the people moves farther from being
realized with every new idea to siphon money from the scholarship
program. Once scholarships are fully funded, the excess funds would be
better used, as I personally expressed last year to Governor Haslam, by
raising the income cap on or raising the amount of Aspire Awards that
give middle- and low-income students who work hard extra help to give
them a fair shot at success.
Ensuring Memphians Get the Tax Returns They Deserve
The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is too important for people to
overlook, and everyone who is eligible should claim it when filing
their taxes. But historically, eligible taxpayers in Memphis and Shelby
County have not taken full advantage of the program-last year alone, as
much as $70 million in potential tax credits were left on the table by
area taxpayers.
Memphians shouldn't pay more than they owe, and they should receive
every penny they deserve in refunds. That's why I attended the grand
opening of one of 15 new Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) sites
that recently opened throughout Shelby County to provide guidance and
advice free of charge to ensure that eligible Shelby County citizens
take advantage of programs like the EITC and get the tax refund they
are entitled to. Click here
to find a VITA site near
you to help ensure you get every penny you are owed.
Helping Memphians Get Covered
All Memphians should have quality health insurance and the President's
landmark Affordable Care Act is making affordable, higher-quality
coverage available to people who have not had access to it in the past.
Luckily, many who have been unable to afford quality coverage in the
past are now eligible to enroll in Tennessee's Health Insurance
Marketplace
. Please don't forget that the open season
deadline to enroll in health coverage for this year at HealthCare.gov
is March 31st. And if you do not have health insurance coverage,
you may also be eligible to save money on your health care premiums
in the Marketplace.
If you are on Medicare or your employer is offering qualified health
insurance that you are enrolled in, you're already covered and won't
need to enter the Marketplace for your health coverage. If you aren't
sure whether or not you should use the Marketplace to get insurance,
call the Marketplace Hotline at 1 (800) 318-2596, visit
www.HealthCare.gov
, or call Tennessee's navigator, Seedco, at (901) 528-8341.
You can also call my office at (901) 544-4131 or the Marketplace
Hotline to find out if TennCare (Tennessee's Medicaid program) is a
coverage option for you. If you are one of the millions of Americans
who need health insurance, you can sign up
for coverage for 2014 until the open
enrollment period closes on March 31st, 2014. Visit www.healthcare.gov
today to look at your options.
The Affordable Care Act is already working for families across the
Ninth District. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, 147,000 individuals in the district now have health insurance
that covers preventive services without co-pays, $3.1 million in
insurance premiums have been returned to consumers, and more than 5,000
seniors on Medicare paid a total of $5.9 million less for their
prescription medications as we continue to close the 'donut hole.'
Also, health insurance companies can no longer discriminate against
patients with pre-existing conditions and young adults up to age 26 can
now stay on their parents' insurance plan.
Many of the Marketplace website issues that have been in the news have
been resolved. However, the Marketplace website is only one tool that
you can use to sign up for coverage. If you are having trouble
accessing the website, please do not hesitate to call the Marketplace
Hotline at 1 (800) 318-2596 or visit the Affordable Care Act Navigators
at Seedco's Mid-South office at 22 North Front Street (Suite 900) for
in-person help. Seedco can also be reached by phone at (901) 528-8341,
and if you have any other questions, you should feel free to call my
office at (901) 544-4131.
Helping St. Jude
This week, I announced nearly $750,000 in federal grant funds to St.
Jude Children's Research Hospital to help treat chronic infections. The
funding will be used to continue important research at St. Jude, which
is the world's leading children's cancer research hospitals and one of
the finest health care institutions on the planet.
VA Rolls Out Secure Veteran Health ID Cards
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) recently announced the phased
roll out of newly designed, more secure Veteran Health Identification
Cards. The new cards are distinguished by additional security features
and will have a different look and feel. In addition to being more
secure, the card has been transformed into a Veterans Health
Identification Card (VHIC).
Similar to a typical health insurance card, the VHIC displays the
veteran's Member ID, a new unique identifier, as well as a Plan ID,
reflecting the veteran's enrollment in VA health care. The card
replaces the Veteran Identification Card (VIC), which was introduced in
2004. As part of a phased rollout, the card will only be offered to
newly enrolled and other veterans who have not been issued a VIC. In
early April, the VA will begin a three month effort to automatically
issue the more secure VHIC to current VIC cardholders. The VA
recommends veterans safeguard their VIC as they would a credit card,
and cut up or shred the card once it is replaced. While not required to
receive VA health care, all enrolled Veterans are encouraged to get a
VHIC.
Enrolled veterans can get more information about the VHIC by visiting
their VA medical facility enrollment coordinator or the website
www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhic
, calling 1-877-222-VETS (8387) or visiting their
local VA health care facility. Veterans who are not enrolled in the VA
health care system can apply for enrollment at any time by visiting
www.va.gov/healthbenefits
, calling 1-877-222-VETS (8387) or visiting
their local VA health care facility.
Helping Veterans Become Homeowners
Last year, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs helped a record
number of veterans obtain mortgage loans and become homeowners
. In guaranteeing nearly 630,000 home loans, the VA's Loan
Guarantee program helped more veterans become homeowners or move to a
new home than at any point in its 70-year history. Not only is this
great news for veterans, but it also is another sign that our housing
market is rebounding-and that is good news for everyone. The VA Loan
Guarantee program has some of the lowest foreclosure rates around and,
along with offering low interest rates, their loans do not require a
down payment from first-time buyers. If you are a veteran looking to
purchase a home, you can learn more about the program here
.
Grant Announcements
I regularly release a list of grant announcements from federal agencies
like the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, and others. These
federal funding opportunities are available to faith-based and
neighborhood associations, nonprofits and other community organizations
in the Ninth District. The announcements are updated regularly on my
website
.
As always, I remain.

Yesterday,
I
met
with
several
young
adults
from
Memphis
who
had
been
through
the
foster
care
system
and
were
in
Washington
representing
Youth
Villages
at
the
White
House
with
the
First
Lady.
Youth
Villages
is
a
non-profit
organization
that
has
partnered
with
the
Tennessee
Department
of
Children&#8217;s
Services
to
help
former
foster
children
by
offering
comprehensive
services
to
foster
children
who
have
aged
out
of
state
custody.
National
studies
have
found
that,
with
limited
resources
and
support,
these
young
people
are
more
likely
than
their
peers
to
end
up
homeless
or
incarcerated
and
less
likely
to
have
a
job
or
go
to
college.
The
programs
offered
by
Youth
Villages
aim
to
prevent
these
outcomes
and
promote
success.
The

this
week
to
help

across
the

preserve
social

The

President

I

that
House
Republican
leadership
will
put

to
join
us
in
passing
this

Fighting
for
a
Sane Criminal
Policy
At
a
House
Committee
hearing
about
federal
drug
policies
which
unfairly
hurt
minority
communities
and
have
resulted
in
4
times
as
many
African
Americans
arrested
as
Caucasians ,
I
was
able
to
question
the
Deputy
Administrator
of
the
Drug
Enforcement
Administration
(DEA)
Thomas
Harrigan
about
his
views
on
federal
marijuana.
I
was
surprised
to
hear
that
he
believes
that
&#8220;every
single
parent&#8221;
opposes
marijuana
and
that
the
drug,
which
is
now
legal
for
medical
or
personal
use
in
nearly
half
of
the
United
States,
&#8220;insults
our
common
values.&#8221;
When
I
pressed
him
for
more
information,
he
tried
to
backtrack
his
comments
and
wasn&#8217;t
able
to
provide
backup
for
either
of
his
claims.
You
can
watch
me
questioning
Deputy
Director
Harrigan
here .
Like
the
rest
of
our
federal
government
when
it
comes
to
marijuana,
the
DEA
is
out
of
touch
with
reality.
They
haven&#8217;t
kept
up
with
the
science,
they
haven&#8217;t
kept
up
with
the
medical
community,
and
they
sure
haven&#8217;t
kept
up
with
the
American
people.
When
a
law
is
almost
universally
perceived
as
wrong,
it
breeds
disrespect
for
our
legal
system.
Americans
young
and
old
think
federal
marijuana
policy
is
a
joke.
They
know
that
marijuana
shouldn&#8217;t
be
in
the
same
category
with
heroin,
and
they
don&#8217;t
support
taking
one&#8217;s
liberty
away
because
of
marijuana.
Among
other
problems
with
our
drug
laws,
our
nation&#8217;s
marijuana
policy
is
deeply
rooted
in
racism. 80
years
ago
it
was
based
on
fear
of
Hispanic
immigrants,
then
Nixon
played
up
raced

fears
to
garner

all
while
his

marijuana
was
placed
on
Schedule

it
was
supposed
to
be
temporary
until
the
National
Commission
on
Marijuana
and
Drug

(known
as
the
Shafer

reported
its
findings
on
the
drug.
That
was
1970.
The
Commission&#8217;s
1972
report
recommended
decriminalizing
marijuana
possession,
though
that
recommendation
was
never
acted
upon.
Last
month,
the
Shafer
Commission&#8217;s
Assistant
Director
Richard
Bonnie
said:
&#8220;Frankly,
I
am
astonished
that
criminal
penalties
continue
to
be
prescribed
and
imposed
for
simple
possession
of

It
is

time
to
repeal
them.&#8221;
It
is

that
we

Protecting
Women&#8217;s
Rights
I
am
proud
that
I
was
recently
awarded
with
a
perfect
score
from
NARAL
Pro-Choice
America
for
my
votes
in
2013.
It
is
an
honor
to
be
recognized
for
my
record
protecting
women&#8217;s
rights
and
health
care
choices.
While
there
are
some
in
Congress
who
want
to
repeal
the
last
50
years&#8217;
worth
of
advances
in
reproductive
rights,
I
will
continue
to
stand
with
women
and
do
whatever
I
can
to
make
sure
no
one
tramples
on
their
rights.
Supporting
the
DREAM
Act
and
Immigration
Reform
I
was
pleased
to
meet
with
a
handful
of
Memphis
students
who
were
in
Washington
to
push
for
the
passage
of
the
DREAM
Act
and
comprehensive
immigration
reform,
both
of
which
I
support.
I
will
continue
to
urge
Speaker
Boehner
to
bring
both
measures
to
the
floor
for
a
vote,
and
I
hope
he
does
so
as
soon
as
possible.
Stopping
Iran
from
Acquiring
Nuclear
Weapons
After
more
than
a
decade
of
foreign
wars,
no
one
thinks
we
should
get
into
another
military
conflict,
which
is
why
this
week
I
joined
a
bipartisan
Congressional
letter
to
President
Obama
supporting
his
diplomatic
efforts
to
get
Iran
to
abandon
its
nuclear
weapons
ambitions.
However,
that
country&#8217;s
history
of
delay
and
deceptions
raises
serious
concerns
that
they
may
use
prolonged
diplomatic
negotiations
to
bolster
their
economy
while
continuing
their
progress
towards
weapons
of
mass
destruction&#8212;so
it
is
important
that
the
United
States
keep
all
options
on
the
table
including
stronger
sanctions
to
do
all
that
we
can
to
change
Iran&#8217;s
calculations
and
make
sure
they
follow
through
and
honestly
negotiate
with
us.
Our
letter
strongly
urges
the
President
to
keep
Congress
informed
of
his
progress
so
that
we
can
swiftly
consider
additional
sanctions
if
they
become
necessary.
Building
a
Healthier
Memphis
Among
the
many
benefits
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act
is
free
preventive
care
for
services
like
mammograms
that
can
detect
breast
cancer.
A
New
York
Times
story
noted
that
Memphis
is
&#8220;the
deadliest
major
American
city
for
African-American
women
with
breast
cancer.&#8221;
The
racial
disparity
in
breast
cancer
outcomes
is
deplorable,
but
we
can
take
steps
to
reduce
it.
A
primary
reason
for the
high
mortality
rate
among
African
American
women
is
late
diagnosis,
when
the
disease
is
harder
to
treat
and
has
much
lower
survival
rates.
That&#8217;s
why
I
launched
my
&#8220;Building
a
Healthier
Memphis&#8221;
series
on
wellness
in
the
Ninth
District
by
hosting
an
expert
panel
discussion
and
education
session
about
this
disparity
and
what
we
can
do
to
address
it
and
improve
outcomes
for
victims
of
breast
cancer
in
our
city. I&#8217;m
encouraged
by
all
of
the
Memphians
who
attended
the
event
to
learn
how
they
can
help
improve
their
own
health
and
the
health
of
their
families
and
communities,
and
I
look
forward
to
hosting
the
next
&#8220;Building
a
Healthier
Memphis&#8221;
event
at
Church
Health
Center
Wellness
on
Saturday,
April
12 th at
10
AM.
Everyone
in
the
Ninth
District
should
know
that
provisions
of
the
President&#8217;s
Affordable
Care
Act
enable
them
to
get
mammograms
with
no
co-pays
or
deductibles.
Taking
advantage
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act
could
help
save
lives
in
our
city
and
around
the
country.
And
don&#8217;t
forget
that
the
open
season
deadline
to
enroll
in
health
coverage
for
this
year
at
HealthCare.gov
is
March
31st.
Fully
Funding
the
HOPE
Scholarships
Over
the
last
10
years,
the
HOPE
Scholarship
program
that
I
worked
for
20
years
as
a
State
Senator
to
create
has
been
an
outstanding
success
that
has
provided
$2.9
billion
to
Tennessee&#8217;s
best
and
brightest.
And
while
this
funding
has
been
critical
to
helping
students
attend
college
and
complete
4-year
degrees,
the
HOPE
Scholarship
has
never
fully
funded
college
scholarships,
as
intended,
because
state
lawmakers
have
not
allowed
it
to
keep
up
with
the
skyrocketing
cost
of
higher
education.
Today&#8217;s
HOPE
Scholarships
pay
a
smaller
portion
of
college
costs
than
it
did
10
years
ago
and,
if
Governor
Haslam&#8217;s
newly-announced
plan
to
slash
the
first
two
years
of
HOPE
Scholarships
by
25%
is
implemented,
it
will
provide
even
smaller
scholarships
for
freshmen
and
sophomores.
The
first
two
years
of
college
are
crucial
for
students
finding
their
way.
With
scholarships
paying
a
smaller
portion
of
tuition,
families
will
have
to
pay
more
and
students
may
need
to
work
more
hours
while
juggling
their
scholastic
responsibilities,
making
academic
success
and
retention
of
the
HOPE
Scholarship
more
difficult. Today&#8217;s
college
students
are
graduating
with
more
student
loan
debt
than
ever
before,
crippling
their
chances
of
economic
success.
To
ensure
that
HOPE
Scholarships
continue
to
help
Tennessee&#8217;s
students
afford
college
and
succeed,
the
program
must
keep
pace
with
the
rising
cost
of
higher
education.
But
the
Governor&#8217;s
newly-announced
&#8220;Tennessee
Promise&#8221;
actually
cuts
funding
from
high-achieving
students
beginning
4-year
degree
programs.
I
am
extremely
concerned
and
remain
cautious
about
any
plan
that
would
make
it
harder
for
our
state&#8217;s
proven
young
people
to
begin
attending
the
best
universities
in
Tennessee,
or
any
plan
that
places
additional
financial
burden
on
schools
like
the
University
of
Memphis
which
are
already
struggling
to
keep
costs
down
and
provide
high-quality
educations.
Rather
than
raiding
the
scholarship
fund&#8217;s
excess
to
create
a
new
government
program,
those
funds
should
be
used
to
provide
full
HOPE
scholarships.
Tennesseans
voted
to
repeal
our
state&#8217;s
constitutional
prohibition
on
lotteries
based
on
the
idea
of
replicating
the
success
of
Georgia&#8217;s
successful
HOPE
program
which
provides
full
college
scholarships.
That
promise
to
the
people
moves
farther
from
being
realized
with
every
new
idea
to
siphon
money
from
the
scholarship
program.
Once
scholarships
are
fully
funded,
the
excess
funds
would
be
better
used,
as
I
personally
expressed
last
year
to
Governor
Haslam,
by
raising
the
income
cap
on
or
raising
the
amount
of
Aspire
Awards
that
give
middle-
and
low-income
students
who
work
hard
extra
help
to
give
them
a
fair
shot
at
success.
Ensuring
Memphians
Get
the
Tax
Returns
They
Deserve
The
Earned
Income
Tax
Credit
(EITC)
is
too
important
for
people
to
overlook,
and
everyone
who
is
eligible
should
claim
it
when
filing
their
taxes.
But
historically,
eligible
taxpayers
in
Memphis
and
Shelby
County
have
not
taken
full
advantage
of
the
program&#8212;last
year
alone,
as
much
as
$70
million
in
potential
tax
credits
were
left
on
the
table
by
area
taxpayers.
Memphians
shouldn&#8217;t
pay
more
than
they
owe,
and
they
should
receive
every
penny
they
deserve
in
refunds.
That&#8217;s
why
I
attended
the
grand
opening
of
one
of
15
new
Volunteer
Income
Tax
Assistance
(VITA)
sites
that
recently
opened
throughout
Shelby
County
to
provide
guidance
and
advice
free
of
charge
to
ensure
that
eligible
Shelby
County
citizens
take
advantage
of
programs
like
the
EITC
and
get
the
tax
refund
they
are
entitled
to.
Click

to
find
a
VITA
site
near
you
to
help
ensure
you
get
every
penny
you
are
owed.
Helping
Memphians
Get
Covered
All
Memphians
should
have
quality
health
insurance
and
the
President&#8217;s
landmark
Affordable
Care
Act
is
making
affordable,
higher-quality
coverage
available
to
people
who
have
not
had
access
to
it
in
the
past.
Luckily,
many
who
have
been
unable
to
afford
quality
coverage
in
the
past
are
now
eligible
to
enroll
in
Tennessee&#8217;s
Health
Insurance
Marketplace .
Please
don&#8217;t
forget
that
the
open
season
deadline
to
enroll
in
health
coverage
for
this
year
at
HealthCare.gov
is
March
31st.
And
if
you
do
not
have
health
insurance
coverage,
you
may
also
be
eligible
to
save
money
on
your
health
care
premiums
in
the
Marketplace.
If
you
are
on
Medicare
or
your
employer
is
offering
qualified
health
insurance
that
you
are
enrolled
in,
you&#8217;re
already
covered
and
won&#8217;t
need
to
enter
the
Marketplace
for
your
health
coverage.
If
you
aren&#8217;t
sure
whether
or
not
you
should
use
the
Marketplace
to
get
insurance,

if
TennCare
(Tennessee&#8217;s
Medicaid
program)
is
a
coverage
option
for
you.
If
you
are
one
of
the
millions
of
Americans
who
need
health
insurance,
you
can
sign
up
for
coverage
for
2014
until
the
open

period
closes
on
March
31st,
2014.

The
Affordable
Care
Act
is
already
working
for
families
across
the
Ninth
District.
According
to
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services,
147,000
individuals
in
the
district
now
have
health
insurance
that
covers
preventive
services
without
co-pays,
$3.1
million
in
insurance
premiums
have
been
returned
to
consumers,
and
more
than
5,000
seniors
on
Medicare
paid
a
total
of
$5.9
million
less
for
their
prescription
medications
as
we
continue
to
close
the
&#8216;donut
hole.&#8217;
Also,
health
insurance
companies
can
no
longer
discriminate
against
patients
with
pre-existing
conditions
and
young
adults
up
to
age
26
can
now
stay
on
their
parents&#8217;
insurance
plan.

Helping
St.
Jude
This
week,
I
announced
nearly
$750,000
in
federal
grant
funds
to
St.
Jude
Children&#8217;s
Research
Hospital
to
help
treat
chronic
infections.
The
funding
will
be
used
to
continue
important
research
at
St.
Jude,
which
is
the
world&#8217;s
leading
children&#8217;s
cancer
research
hospitals
and
one
of
the
finest
health
care
institutions
on
the
planet.
VA
Rolls
Out
Secure
Veteran
Health
ID
Cards
The
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
recently
announced
the
phased
roll
out
of
newly
designed,
more
secure
Veteran
Health
Identification
Cards. The
new
cards
are
distinguished
by
additional
security
features
and
will
have
a
different
look
and
feel. In
addition
to
being
more
secure,
the
card
has
been
transformed
into
a
Veterans
Health
Identification
Card
(VHIC).
Similar
to
a
typical
health
insurance
card,
the
VHIC
displays
the
veteran&#8217;s
Member
ID,
a
new
unique
identifier,
as
well
as
a
Plan
ID,
reflecting
the
veteran&#8217;s
enrollment
in
VA
health
care. The
card
replaces
the
Veteran
Identification
Card
(VIC),
which
was
introduced
in
2004. As
part
of
a
phased
rollout,
the
card
will
only
be
offered
to
newly
enrolled
and
other
veterans
who
have
not
been
issued
a
VIC. In
early
April,
the
VA
will
begin
a
three
month
effort
to
automatically
issue
the
more
secure
VHIC
to
current
VIC
cardholders.
The
VA
recommends
veterans
safeguard
their
VIC
as
they
would
a
credit
card,
and
cut
up
or
shred
the
card
once
it
is
replaced. While
not
required
to
receive
VA
health
care,
all
enrolled
Veterans
are
encouraged
to
get
a
VHIC.
Enrolled
veterans
can
get
more
information
about
the
VHIC
by
visiting
their
VA
medical
facility
enrollment
coordinator
or
the
website
www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vhic ,
calling
1-877-222-VETS
(8387)
or
visiting
their
local
VA
health
care
facility.
Veterans
who
are
not
enrolled
in
the
VA
health
care
system
can
apply
for
enrollment
at
any
time
by
visiting
www.va.gov/healthbenefits ,
calling
1-877-222-VETS
(8387)
or
visiting
their
local
VA
health
care
facility.
Helping
Veterans
Become
Homeowners
Last
year,
the
U.S.
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
helped
a
record
number
of
veterans
obtain
mortgage
loans
and
become
homeowners .
In
guaranteeing
nearly
630,000
home
loans,
the
VA&#8217;s
Loan
Guarantee
program
helped
more
veterans
become
homeowners
or
move
to
a
new
home
than
at
any
point
in
its
70-year
history.
Not
only
is
this
great
news
for
veterans,
but
it
also
is
another
sign
that
our
housing
market
is
rebounding&#8212;and
that
is
good
news
for
everyone.
The
VA
Loan
Guarantee
program
has
some
of
the
lowest
foreclosure
rates
around
and,
along
with
offering
low
interest
rates,
their
loans
do
not
require
a
down
payment
from
first-time
buyers.
If
you
are
a
veteran
looking
to
purchase
a
home,
you
can
learn
more
about
the
program
here .
