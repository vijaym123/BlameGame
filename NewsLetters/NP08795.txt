Wicker: VA Reform Bill
Important to
Restoring Public Trust, Credibility
Systemic Problems at Medical Centers
Nationwide
Highlight Need for Immediate
Action
The recently released internal audit by the Veterans
Affairs Department and a preliminary report by the VA's Office of Inspector
General (IG) paint a heartbreaking picture of veteran care in America.
The reports show that egregious delays in treatment and
manipulated records at a VA hospital in Phoenix
where 18 veterans died
while on waiting lists
are not isolated issues but part of a wider
crisis affecting the medical care of veterans across the nation.
The magnitude of this
negligence and mismanagement has rightly stirred alarm and outrage.
According to the internal audit, more than 57,000 veterans have been
waiting three months or more for their first appointments.
Likewise,
13 percent of hospital schedulers have been directed by supervisors to
make long wait times look shorter than the 14-day deadline.
The
interim IG report drew similar conclusions, revealing that
"inappropriate scheduling practices are a systemic problem nationwide" and more
than 42 VA facilities are under
review.
FBI Criminal
Investigation
Underway
Given these troubling findings, I joined 20 Senators in calling for a
criminal investigation by the Justice Department to ensure that those
responsible are held accountable.
On June 11, the FBI launched a
probe to determine any criminal wrongdoing, including whether VA
administrators lied about patient wait times to qualify for
bonuses.
Swift action and sweeping reforms are
important to restoring public trust and credibility in the VA system.
Gross mistreatment of our veterans is inexcusable and an affront
to their service and sacrifice.
These brave Americans have earned
the best health care available and deserve to receive it in a timely
manner.
We have an obligation to see that the system no longer
fails those that it is supposed to serve.
Congress Demands
Patient Choice,
Accountability
That is why I cosponsored the "Veterans Choice Act of
2014" shortly after learning of the VA tragedies.
The legislation
would give veterans more control over their health care and more choices
when faced with long wait times.
Veterans who live more than 40
miles from a medical center, for example, would be able to choose a
doctor outside the VA
system.
These ideas were soon incorporated into broader bipartisan
legislation, which recently passed the Senate by a vote of 93-3.
A
related bill was passed unanimously in the House.
Once the differences
between the two bills are reconciled, it will go the President to
become law.
In addition to offering veterans private-sector care,
the Senate bill, authored by Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and John
McCain (R-Ariz.), would establish 26 new VA medical facilities, hire more
doctors and nurses, and allow the VA Secretary to fire or demote
employees for poor job performance.
As a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I
remain ready to utilize every resource to ensure our veterans receive the
first-rate medical services they have earned.
Restoring
confidence in high-quality patient care
in Jackson, Biloxi, Memphis, or
wherever our veterans choose to seek it
is crucial to the reform effort.
The problems that have emerged at the VA in recent weeks are a
terrible wake-up call, but it is encouraging that Congress has seized
this opportunity to rebuild and restore faith in the
system.
