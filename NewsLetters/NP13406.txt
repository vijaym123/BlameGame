David --
This has been a very special year for me.
Quite simply, representing the people of Illinois&rsquo; 17th district in Congress has been the greatest honor of my life. I want keep on fighting for you, David.
I want to keep working on behalf of our veterans, our seniors, our communities and our families.
2014 will bring my first race for re-election. I know we can win, but it&rsquo;s going to be a battle. I know I&rsquo;m going to need you on my side. Will you join me? Please support my campaign for re-election by donating $3 or more before our critical year-end deadline &gt;&gt;
Election Day is closer than you think.
Let&rsquo;s get to work!
Thanks,
Cheri
