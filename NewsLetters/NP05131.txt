David --
Cheri&rsquo;s race against her Tea Party opponent is
too close to call.
But this race is about more than polling numbers and money in the bank.
It&rsquo;s a choice between a leader who believes the middle class deserves a fair shot. And a politician who only looks out for himself --
and
his big money backers.
That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re re-opening up
Cheri&rsquo;s Middle Class Action Fund
for the final 12 day sprint to the finish. David, you can become a Founding Member -- but only if you act fast.
We&rsquo;re permanently closing the books on this critical project in 24 hours.
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
After tomorrow's deadline, we&rsquo;ll have a record of the dedicated supporters who stepped up and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to stop rigging the game and start putting the middle class first.&rdquo;
Don&rsquo;t miss out on your FINAL chance to be a Founding Member: http://action.cheribustos.com/Founding-Member
