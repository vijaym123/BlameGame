This week I questioned several foreign policy and energy experts at the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing about the geopolitical potential of Americas energy boom. As technological advances open up untapped domestic reserves of natural gas and oil and position the U.S. as a world leader in energy production, there's a growing realization of the geopolitical merits of increased energy production and the possibility of exporting greater quantities of U.S. natural gas and oil.
Increased domestic energy production not only is good for the Pennsylvania and American economies, but it also would increase our position as a global economic leader.
Greater American production will also diminish our dependence on energy sources that either are in unstable regions or unfriendly to American interests. An energy independent America has the potential to not only write her own economic destiny and dramatically change the global security environment.
These policies are vitally important to American families and businesses that currently are suffering under unnecessarily high energy prices. They also offer the added benefit of renewing the American manufacturing sector and creating good paying American jobs.

We must balance our nations energy needs while taking thoughtful steps to preserve our environment. We must pursue an all-of-the-above energy strategy that includes research and development of new, clean energy technologies while ensuring that America takes full advantage of our vast domestic energy resources. At the same time, domestic oil and natural gas play a central role in our energy future by helping to create jobs, revitalizing our manufacturing sector, addressing energy costs and substantially reducing our reliance on energy from unstable foreign sources. They must be a part of our considerations to grow our economy and increase our global economic position.
Sincerely,
Scott G. Perry
