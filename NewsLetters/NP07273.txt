Don't Be Left in the Dark
As your voice in Washington, I do my best to keep you informed and updated about what is going on in Congress and what I am doing in the 3rd District of Missouri.
I wanted to let you know that House rules prohibit Member offices from giving notice of official tele-town halls or sending out Congressional newsletters during black out periods. In Missouri, our black out period for the general election begins on August 7, 2014 and extends through November 4, 2014.
During this time, I encourage you to sign up for my
e-newsletter
so you wont get left in the dark when I send updates on important issues like immigration, the IRS scandal, and the presidents health-care law.
As always, it is my honor to serve you in the House of Representatives.
