PEARCE VOTES TO KILL THE DEATH
TAX
U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce issued the following
statement after the House passed the Death Tax Repeal Act of 2015
(H.R. 1105), which fully repeals the federal Estate
Tax.
Small businesses account for 98 percent
of the jobs in New Mexico.
Most of these businesses are
family-owned.
Penalizing a family for a death of a loved one is no way
for the government to work, said
Pearce.
From ranching and farming to an urban small business,
families throughout the nation work together to build and grow a
successful life.
Yet, the death tax authorizes the IRS to take 40
percent of a familys living, which they have worked so hard to grow -
burdening our economy and killing jobs.
Permanently ending this destructive tax policy will help
protect ranching and farming jobs and the entrepreneurship fundamental to
the culture and history of New Mexico
as well as many other parts
of the nation.
It ensures family businesses can continue to
innovate and create jobs -- aiding in the return of a healthy economy --
despite the death of a loved one.
And, it will encourage more
Americans to start a business, and achieve their dream
the American
dream, Pearce added.
Last month,
the non-partisan
Tax Foundation , a research
think tank, predicted that full repeal of the death tax would create
139,000 new jobs nationwide.
