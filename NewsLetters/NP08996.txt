Dear Friend,
This was an in-district work week, a chance to get out with the good
people of Missouri's Fourth Congressional District and to hear some
common sense ideas to take back to Washington. Our two-day
"All-of-the-Above" Energy Tour was the highlight of this week as I met
with energy officials and experts throughout the district to see
first-hand the variety of ways energy is being generated and delivered
to our families and learn how Washington's policies are affecting its
cost.
Although our energy tour had been in the planning for more than a
month, this was coincidentally the week in which the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) unveiled its new regulations designed to curb
carbon emissions. So there was a good deal of discussion regarding the
EPA rules. I am certainly not opposed to reducing emissions, but I
believe it must be done in a common-sense way that does not harm the
hard-working Americans who would have to pay much higher energy bills
as a result of these EPA regulations. As the name of our tour would
imply, I believe we must embrace an "all-of-the-above" energy policy
that includes tried and true sources of energy such as coal, hydro, and
nuclear along with alternative energy sources that include wind and
solar power. The American people need energy and we must embrace all
forms of energy--but it should make sense with the goal of affordable,
reliable power.
We began at the hydroelectric power plant in Benton County near Warsaw.
The Truman Lake dam generates electricity in addition to controlling
flooding. Six turbines run during peak times to supplement base power
plants and to provide electricity to Missouri families.
The dam also includes a visitor center, open from March through October
providing visitors with a beautiful view of Truman Lake.
A visit to State Fair Community College in Sedalia presented an
opportunity to tour the school's Energy Innovation Center which turns
landfill waste into power. The Center converts methane gas from the
landfill into electricity to supplement college and community needs -
generating as much as 2.4 megawatts of electricity to be placed on the
grid and sold to KCP&L.; It also provides hands-on experience for
students who want to enter the biomass job market.
Congresswoman Hartzler and Energy Innovation Center Plant Manager
Richard Downin
I was impressed with this emerging energy source and how professionals
and students at a community college in Missouri's Fourth Congressional
District are working together to answer the call for our increased
energy needs.
Our next stop was the Spectra Energy Pipeline Pump Station near
Salisbury - one of several stations along a crude oil line that begins
in Alberta, Canada, runs through our district, and ends at Wood River,
Illinois where it is refined into useable petroleum.
Congresswoman Hartzler with Spectra Energy's Scott Waddill
Approximately 7,000 barrels of crude oil run through the pipeline every
hour.
A tour of the Thomas Hill coal-fired power plant in Randolph County
allowed me to see a facility that is providing clean, reliable
electricity to our citizens.
This set the stage for concerns about the new EPA regulations that
would be heard at our "all-of-the-above" energy rally in at Moberly
Area Community College in Moberly.
It is clear from this rally that Missourians appreciate various
alternative sources of energy, but they want affordable coal power, as
well. New Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations proposed
this week could raise the cost of energy by mandating a 30 percent
reduction in carbon emissions over the next several years. The 645-page
regulation document gives flexibility to the states on how to achieve
the reduction, so the direct impact is still unknown. I will be closely
examining this proposal and, since 80 percent of Missouri's energy
comes from coal, am concerned about the potential negative impact here.
If coal-powered plants are targeted again, it will hurt hardworking
families who are struggling to make ends meet as well as hurt jobs.
Common sense must prevail.
A visit to the Hubbell Manufacturing Company in Centralia was part of
our tour. The company manufactures a variety of transmission,
distribution, substation, and telecommunications products used by
utilities. This Boone County company employs 600 people!
Our tour wrapped up with a visit to the University of Missouri where I
toured the MU Power Plant and the Biomass Boiler before moderating a
panel discussion on Missouri's Energy Future: Challenges and
Opportunities.
In our ever-changing world the need for energy is only going to
increase. This "all-of-the-above" energy tour was eye-opening and
valuable as we face the task of finding solutions to America's energy
needs - and to keep that energy at a low cost to consumers. That is why
I am looking forward to scheduling a similar tour next year and in
future years. I thank all of those who worked with my office to help
make this tour possible.
Finally, the world is observing the 70thanniversary of the D-Day
invasion of Normandy in World War II. Nine thousand Allied troops -
many of them Americans - were killed or wounded, but 100,000 went on to
help save the world from the oppressive Nazi regime. As we mark D-Day,
I call on all Missourians to offer their thanks to America's World War
II veterans and to all veterans who have fought and those who continue
to fight to keep us free. Thank you for protecting the freedoms we all
enjoy.
Have a great week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler

Dear
Friend,
This
was
an

week,
a

the
good
people
of
Missouri&#8217;s
Fourth
Congressional
District
and
to
hear
some
common

Although
our

the
planning
for
more

this
was
coincidentally
the
week
in
which
the
Environmental

unveiled
its
new

designed
to
curb
carbon

So
there
was
a
good

of
discussion
regarding
the
EPA
rules.
I
am
certainly
not
opposed
to
reducing
emissions,
but
I
believe
it
must
be
done
in
a
common-sense

that
does
not
harm
the
hard-working
Americans
who
would
have
to
pay

energy
bills
as
a

of
these
EPA
regulations.
As
the
name
of
our

would
imply,
I
believe
we
must
embrace
an
&#8220;all-of-the-above&#8221;

policy
that
includes
tried
and
true

of

I
was
impressed
with
this
emerging
energy
source
and
how
professionals
and
students
at

community
college
in
Missouri&#8217;s
Fourth
Congressional
District
are
working
together
to
answer
the
call
for
our
increased
energy
needs.
Our
next
stop
was
the
Spectra
Energy
Pipeline
Pump
Station
near
Salisbury
&#8211;
one
of
several
stations
along
a
crude
oil
line
that
begins
in
Alberta,
Canada,
runs
through
our
district,
and
ends
at
Wood
River,
Illinois
where
it
is
refined
into
useable
petroleum.
Congresswoman
Hartzler
with
Spectra
Energy&#8217;s
Scott
Waddill
Approximately
7,000
barrels
of
crude
oil
run
through
the
pipeline
every
hour.
A
tour
of
the
Thomas
Hill
coal-fired
power
plant
in
Randolph
County
allowed
me
to
see
a
facility
that
is
providing
clean,

to
our
citizens.
This
set
the
stage
for
concerns
about
the
new
EPA
regulations
that
would
be
heard
at
our
&#8220;all-of-the-above&#8221;
energy
rally
in
at
Moberly
Area
Community
College
in
Moberly.
It
is
clear
from
this
rally
that
Missourians
appreciate
various
alternative
sources
of
energy,
but
they
want
affordable
coal
power,
as
well. New
Environmental

regulations
proposed

could
raise
the

of

by

in
carbon
emissions
over
the
next
several
years.
The
645-page
regulation
document gives
flexibility
to
the
states
on
how
to
achieve
the
reduction,
so
the
direct
impact
is
still
unknown.
I
will
be
closely
examining
this
proposal
and,
since
80
percent
of
Missouri's
energy
comes
from
coal,
am
concerned
about
the
potential
negative
impact
here.
If
coal-powered
plants
are
targeted
again,
it
will
hurt
hardworking
families
who
are
struggling
to
make
ends
meet
as
well
as
hurt
jobs.
Common
sense
must
prevail.
A
visit
to
the
Hubbell
Manufacturing
Company
in
Centralia
was
part
of
our
tour.
The
company
manufactures
a

Our

wrapped
up
with
a
visit
to
the
University
of
Missouri
where
I
toured
the
MU
Power
Plant
and
the
Biomass
Boiler
before
moderating
a
panel
discussion
on
Missouri&#8217;s
Energy
Future:
Challenges
and
Opportunities.
In
our
ever-changing
world
the
need
for
energy
is
only
going
to
increase.
This
&#8220;all-of-the-above&#8221;
energy
tour
was
eye-opening
and
valuable
as
we
face
the
task
of
finding
solutions
to
America&#8217;s
energy
needs
&#8211;
and
to
keep
that
energy
at
a
low
cost
to
consumers.
That
is
why
I
am
looking
forward
to
scheduling
a
similar
tour
next
year
and
in
future
years.
I
thank
all
of
those
who
worked
with
my
office
to
help
make
this
tour
possible.
Finally,
the
world
is
observing
the
70 th anniversary
of
the
D-Day
invasion
of
Normandy
in
World
War
II.
Nine
thousand
Allied
troops
&#8211;
many
of
them
Americans
&#8211;
were
killed
or
wounded,
but
100,000
went
on
to
help
save
the
world
from
the
oppressive
Nazi
regime.
As
we
mark
D-Day,
I
call
on
all
Missourians
to
offer
their
thanks
to
America&#8217;s
World
War
II
veterans
and
to
all
veterans
who
have
fought
and
those
who
continue
to
fight
to
keep
us
free.
Thank
you
for
protecting
the
freedoms
we
all
enjoy.
Have
a
great
week.
