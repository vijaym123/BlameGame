Dear Fellow Coloradan,
In the nearly three years since the Affordable Care Act became law, we've made important progress toward ensuring that all Americans have access to quality, affordable health care. As of January 1, more than 138,000 Coloradans have found affordable coverage through our state&rsquo;s new health insurance marketplace and the common-sense Medicaid expansion the law supports.
More importantly, our nation&rsquo;s health care law ensures that a mom never spends another sleepless night worrying if her kids have health insurance. And young Coloradans can now keep their coverage under their parents' health plans. And women across Colorado are no longer charged more for health insurance simply because of their gender.
And these benefits &mdash; among many more &mdash; are already improving the lives of people across Colorado and throughout the country.
Take Leslie from Lakewood, whose daughter needed a kidney transplant at age 13. When the family had to change insurers, Leslie learned that his daughter unfortunately would not be covered under the new plan because of her pre-existing condition. With the family now paying for two separate health plans, Leslie's daughter also faced lifetime limits on how much an insurance company would pay for costly, but life-saving, kidney care. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, Leslie's daughter can now secure quality health coverage while never again living in fear of a health-related bankruptcy.
Countless other Coloradans are also benefiting from lower premiums and more affordable, quality coverage. These are middle class Coloradans like Christine and her husband, who recently moved to Estes Park to retire and will save $3,100 a year because competition on the state&rsquo;s health marketplace has driven down costs. Then there&rsquo;s David, from Parker, who found that the online marketplace has cut costs for him and his wife by $1,700 each year.
Despite these success stories, the Affordable Care Act's implementation and rollout has been very bad. I remain committed to ensuring that the health law works for Coloradans and all Americans. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve led the charge to give families more time to enroll in insurance plans and even introduced a proposal to allow Americans to remain longer on their current health insurance plan if it worked best for their families.
As we work to ensure the health law works for Coloradans, we can't turn back the clock to the Wild West health insurance market that subjected middle class families to financial ruin if a loved one became sick or suffered an accident.
Nor can we allow our country to backslide to a time when insurance companies could unilaterally deny coverage to sick children, charge women more than men and run up premiums just to improve their bottom line. I refuse to let Congress turn its back on the 2.25 million Coloradans &mdash; including 291,000 children &mdash; with pre-existing conditions like asthma, diabetes, or cancer who could lose their coverage or see their rates hiked if we went back to the way things were.
And I refuse to see our families and communities bear the burden of 1.1 million Coloradans losing access to mental health services.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ll keep fighting to get our nation&rsquo;s healthcare law on solid footing and work across the political divide to ensure all Americans have access to the health coverage that works for their family.
Warm regards,
Offices
