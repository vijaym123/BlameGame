Rep. Bruce Braley -- Iowa's First
District
David,
I'm excited to announce that the 2014 Congressional Art Competition has
begun!
The Congressional Art Competition is an annual event that allows high
school students from Iowa's First Congressional District and across the
country to showcase their artistic abilities. Any high school student
in Iowa's First District is welcome to submit his or her artwork to my
office.
The winner of the competition will win two round-trip airline tickets
to Washington, DC and have his or her artwork displayed in the U.S.
Capitol for a year. Prizes will also be awarded to the runners-up.
Click here for more information about the competition and to submit
your original artwork.

Starting April 23, all submissions will be displayed in an online
gallery on my official website and the public will be able to vote for
their favorite.
If you know any high school art students, please feel free to forward
this email far and wide!
I look forward to all the great submissions this year.
All the best,
