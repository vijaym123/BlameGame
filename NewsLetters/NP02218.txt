Kansas Common Sense
March 9, 2015
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thank you for your continued interest
in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility Fully Funded
The passage of the legislation to fund the Department of Homeland
Security brings a decade-long battle to fund the National Bio and
Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) to a close. I regret, however, that the
spending package also included using taxpayer dollars to fund the
implementation of the President's executive amnesty. I have supported
NBAF since its inception - especially in my role on the Senate
Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security. Now, my advocacy
responsibilities will continue as chairman of the Senate Appropriations
Agriculture Subcommittee, which will fund the facility's operations.
Attending King v. Burwell Arguments at the Supreme Court
I was at the Supreme Court on Wednesday to hear oral arguments on the
legality of the Obama Administration's Affordable Care Act (ACA)
regulation extending subsidies to individuals purchasing health
insurance in states using federal insurance exchanges. At issue is
whether the words of the ACA, "through an Exchange established by the
State," refer only to state-created exchanges. This case - King v.
Burwell - appears to hinge on whether the Court should apply the ACA as
written or consider the broader effect of how the law functions in
states using the federal exchange. The Court is expected to issue its
decision in this case by the end of June. If the Court does find the
implementation unlawful, Congress will have an opportunity to steer
American health care policy away from Obamacare and implement policies
that will actually reduce costs and increase choice for individuals and
families.
Sponsoring Legislation Supporting Rural Hospitals
I recently sponsored legislation (S. 607) to extend the Rural Community
Hospital Demonstration Program - an important Medicare initiative that
helps certain rural hospitals in sparsely populated states expand care
to patients in their communities open. Currently, 23 small, rural
hospitals across the country participate in the demonstration,
including four Kansas hospitals - Mercy Hospital Fort Scott in Fort
Scott; Mercy Hospital Independence in Independence; Geary Community
Hospital in Junction City; and Bob Wilson Memorial Hospital in Ulysses.
This initiative, which is budget neutral, enables participating
hospitals to test the feasibility and advisability of a cost-based
payment model for acute-care inpatient services. This legislation will
enable the Kansas hospitals currently utilizing the demonstration to
continue receiving Medicare reimbursements that more accurately reflect
the cost of providing care to their patients. To preserve medical
access for Kansans and strengthen our communities, health care
professionals must receive appropriate reimbursement for the care they
provide. Click here
to read more about this bill.
Freshman Senators Join U.S. Senate Opposition to U.N. ATT
On Tuesday, I was pleased to gain the support of all 12 freshman
Republican Senators in joining the U.S. Senate's opposition to the
United Nations Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). The letter sent to President
Obama and signed by these 12 Senators provides reinforcement to the
Senate's declared intent to reject ratification of the ATT. A
bipartisan group of 55 U.S. Senators have now voiced their opposition
and informed President Obama that the Senate will not be bound by the
obligations of the ATT.
Despite its purported intentions, the ATT was drafted by foreign
nations and organizations with a long history of hostility toward our
country's Second Amendment freedoms. Under Presidents Clinton and Bush
the United States refused to engage in ATT negotiations, but this U.S.
policy was regrettably overturned when President Obama took office. In
September 2013, the Obama Administration formally signed the ATT, and
almost 18 months later the treaty has still not been submitted to the
Senate for advice and consent.
Last month, I asked Secretary of State John Kerry why the
Administration has not submitted the treaty and when it intends to do
so, but he did not have an answer. Until then, the Senate's letters
continue to send a powerful signal to the President that it will reject
the treaty. Although the Senate cannot "unsign" the treaty, we will
continue to build opposition and issue guidance under the hope that a
future President can do just that. I am proud to lead the Senate in
fighting to uphold the fundamental individual rights of Americans by
reiterating our rejection of the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty. Click here
to read the letter.
Providing Ag Industry Relief from Transportation Regulation
On Wednesday, I joined several senators in introducing S. 654,
bipartisan legislation to eliminate the regulation requiring
agriculture industry professionals to obtain a hazardous material
endorsement before transporting diesel fuel for many agricultural
operations. Specifically, this bill exempts agribusiness participants
from the requirement to obtain a hazardous material endorsement while
operating a service vehicle carrying less than 1,000 gallons of diesel
fuel, provided the tank containing diesel fuel is clearly marked. Under
current regulations, any driver transporting more than 119 gallons of
diesel fuel is required to obtain this endorsement on their Class A
Commercial Driver's License.
As I visit with Kansas farmers and ranchers, regulatory overreach by
the federal government is often cited as their greatest threat. Those
who work in agriculture should not be forced to jump through hoops just
to haul the necessary quantities of diesel required to fuel their
operations.Click here

Sponsoring Bill to Revoke Bonuses to VA Employees Responsible for
Misconduct
This week, I sponsored a bipartisan bill to rescind bonuses paid to
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) employees who were involved in the
manipulation of waitlists. On Monday, the House of Representatives
passed a similar bill. In the wake of the VA scandal last year, those
responsible for manipulating waitlists and mistreatment of veterans
should be held accountable for their actions. The VA used wait-time
metrics as a factor in determining employee bonuses, which incentivized
some VA employees to maximize their bonus payments by using secret
waitlists to artificially inflate compliance data. According to one
report, employees at the Phoenix VA hospital - where the scandal first
broke - received approximately $10 million in bonuses since 2011 while
simultaneously using secret waitlists to hide delays in patients
receiving care.
I believe VA medical centers and CBOCs in Kansas are filled with good,
hard-working people who want to care for veterans by providing quality
health care. But revelations of systemic failures at the VA
demonstrates what can happen when bureaucracy in Washington gets in the
way of an organization's mission and ability to properly serve
veterans. Click here

Joint Session of Congress with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
On Tuesday, I attended a joint session of Congress to hear Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address. The Prime Minister
discussed his country's concerns about the prospect of Iran developing
nuclear weapons. I welcome his assessment of the threats a nuclear deal
with Iran would pose to Israel and appreciate his insight as an
experienced leader in the Middle East. In the Senate, I will continue
to support legislative efforts to allow Congressional review and
approval of any nuclear agreement with Iran. The United States and our
allies around the world have too much at stake to accept a potentially
dangerous nuclear deal that disregards the concerns of Congress and the
American people.
Visiting with AIPAC Delegates from Kansas
This week, I visited with Kansas delegates to the 2016 AIPAC Policy
Conference. More than 80 people from our state traveled to Washington,
D.C., to attend a conference and speak to their elected officials about
the importance of a strong United States-Israeli relationship. The most
dominant topic in our discussion was the pending nuclear negotiations
with Iran and the implications for Israel. During our conversation, I
expressed my continued determination to deny Iran nuclear weapons
capability and reject any policies that might undermine the security of
the United States and our allies abroad, including Israel. Thanks to
all who made the trip to Washington to voice their opinions on this and
other critical issues.
Meeting with Fort Riley Leadership and Touring Irwin Army Community
Hospital
Back in Kansas over the weekend, I met with Brigadier General Eric
Wesley at Fort Riley. We discussed the incredible turnout of the
Listening Session a few weeks ago. I also toured the new,
state-of-the-art $343 million Irwin Army Community Hospital and medical
campus, which features unique evidenced-based design. Fort Riley
families are looking forward to its opening as much as the surrounding
community health care partners.
For example, the operating room is 50 percent larger than their other
operating rooms. They also have a new inpatient behavioral health wing
and the labor delivery and recovery suites. Every detail to enhance and
support quality of life for our soldiers was considered and
incorporated. I will continue to work to make certain Fort Riley
receives the support it deserves so the Big Red One can continue to
defend our nation. Thanks to BG Wesley and his wife Cindy for hosting
the visit.
Concordia Rotary Club
I was able to return home to Kansas in time for Concordia's Rotary Club
meeting because of a shortened Congressional schedule due to inclement
weather in Washington, D.C. The conversation centered on the
implementation of the VA Choice Act, keeping rural America alive with
access to health services and education, and the FCC's net neutrality
order. I appreciated hearing the members' thoughts, suggestions and
concerns.
The former president of the Rotary Club, Gordon Morrison was in
attendance and brought me a Four-Way Test to hang in my office. As a
Rotarian, I appreciated having a copy to remind me of the four
principles Rotary Club stands by: Our actions should be true, fair,
build good will, and be beneficial to all concerned. Thanks to current
Concordia Rotary Club President Patrick Sieben for allowing me to visit
and speak this week. Here, I'm pictured with Junior Rotarians of the
Month Jaden Payeur and Robin Daniels.
Visiting Clay Center High School
I was also in Clay County to visit with students and staff at Clay
Center Community High School (CCCHS). I enjoyed meeting with the senior
class. My visits to Kansas schools help me to learn more about the
successes and challenges educators face in providing Kansas students
opportunities to a quality education. As Congress works to reauthorize
the Elementary and Secondary Education Act - the primary source of
federal aid for K-12 education - these visits help me to gain valuable
insight about how Kansas educators work to meet the unique needs of
their students. Thanks to CCCHS Principal Bud Young for hosting my
visit.
Kansas City Kansas Chamber Luncheon
Friday I attended the Kansas City Kansas Chamber of Commerce Annual
Meeting. It was a great opportunity to visit with many business,
religious and civic leaders in Wyandotte County. More than 600 members
listened to General Motors North American Manufacturing Vice President
Cathy Clegg discuss their latest innovations, including a new 450,000
square foot paint shop at the Fairfax facility - a $600 million
investment. Sporting Kansas City's Greg Cotton who is the 2015 Chamber
Chairman introduced the "Made in the Dotte" campaign to promote
businesses and the workforce in Wyandotte County. Thanks to Interim
Chamber President Greg Kindle for his hospitality. Here, I'm pictured
with Mayor Holland and his wife, Julie Solomon, and Google's Rachel
Merlo.
Visiting the Lawrence Public Library
On Friday, I visited the Lawrence Public Library. It was great to see
the significant remodeling and improvements. Lawrence Public Library
Director Brad Allen invited me a few months ago to visit. The library
serves the city of Lawrence and offers many services including a
collection of more than 250,000 books and other materials, homebound
delivery, a senior living center bookvan service, public computers, and
meeting rooms, as well as extensive programming and exhibits/displays.
Below, I'm pictured with longtime children's librarian Linda Clay.
Retirement of Dr. Fred Cholick
Robba and I joined many faculty, staff and supporters on Friday to wish
Fred and Cathy Cholick best wishes as Fred retires from K-State. Dr.
Cholick came to Manhattan from South Dakota in 2004 to be Dean of the
College of Agriculture and most recently has been President of the very
successful KSU Foundation. Fred and Robba served together on the Kansas
State Fair Board. Thanks Fred and Cathy.

National
Bio
and
Agro-Defense
Facility
Fully
Funded
The
passage
of
the
legislation
to
fund
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
brings
a
decade-long
battle
to
fund
the
National
Bio
and
Agro-Defense
Facility
(NBAF)
to
a
close.
I
regret,
however,
that
the
spending
package
also
included
using
taxpayer
dollars
to
fund
the
implementation
of
the
President's
executive
amnesty.
I
have
supported
NBAF
since
its
inception
&ndash;
especially
in
my
role
on
the
Senate
Appropriations
Subcommittee
on
Homeland
Security.
Now,
my
advocacy
responsibilities
will
continue
as
chairman
of
the
Senate
Appropriations
Agriculture
Subcommittee,
which
will
fund
the
facility's
operations.
Attending
King
v.
Burwell
Arguments
at
the
Supreme
Court
I
was
at
the
Supreme
Court
on
Wednesday
to
hear
oral
arguments
on
the
legality
of
the
Obama
Administration's
Affordable
Care
Act
(ACA)
regulation
extending
subsidies
to
individuals
purchasing
health
insurance
in
states
using
federal
insurance
exchanges.
At
issue
is
whether
the
words
of
the
ACA,
"through
an
Exchange
established
by
the
State,"
refer
only
to
state-created
exchanges.
This
case
&ndash;
King
v.
Burwell
&ndash;
appears
to
hinge
on
whether
the
Court
should
apply
the
ACA
as
written
or
consider
the
broader
effect
of
how
the
law
functions
in
states
using
the
federal
exchange.
The
Court
is
expected
to
issue
its
decision
in
this
case
by
the
end
of
June.
If
the
Court
does
find
the
implementation
unlawful,
Congress
will
have
an
opportunity
to
steer
American
health
care
policy
away
from
Obamacare
and
implement
policies
that
will
actually
reduce
costs
and
increase
choice
for
individuals
and
families.
Sponsoring
Legislation
Supporting
Rural
Hospitals
I
recently
sponsored
legislation
(S.
607)
to
extend
the
Rural
Community
Hospital
Demonstration
Program
&ndash;
an
important
Medicare
initiative
that
helps
certain
rural
hospitals
in
sparsely
populated
states
expand
care
to
patients
in
their
communities
open.
Currently,
23
small,
rural
hospitals
across
the
country
participate
in
the
demonstration,
including
four
Kansas
hospitals
&ndash;
Mercy
Hospital
Fort
Scott
in
Fort
Scott;
Mercy
Hospital
Independence
in
Independence;
Geary
Community
Hospital
in
Junction

and
Bob

This
initiative,
which
is
budget
neutral,
enables
participating
hospitals
to
test
the
feasibility
and
advisability
of
a
cost-based
payment
model
for
acute-care

This

will
enable
the

currently
utilizing
the
demonstration
to
continue
receiving
Medicare

that
more
accurately
reflect
the

to
their

To
preserve
medical

for
the
care
they

55
U.S.
Senators
have
now
voiced
their
opposition
and
informed
President
Obama
that
the
Senate
will
not
be
bound
by
the
obligations
of
the
ATT.
Despite
its
purported
intentions,
the
ATT
was
drafted
by
foreign
nations
and
organizations
with
a
long
history
of
hostility
toward
our
country's
Second
Amendment
freedoms.
Under
Presidents
Clinton
and
Bush
the
United
States
refused
to
engage
in
ATT
negotiations,
but
this
U.S.
policy
was
regrettably
overturned
when
President
Obama
took
office.
In
September
2013,
the
Obama
Administration
formally
signed
the
ATT,
and
almost
18
months
later
the
treaty
has
still
not
been
submitted
to
the
Senate
for
advice
and
consent.
Last
month,
I
asked
Secretary
of
State
John
Kerry
why
the
Administration
has
not
submitted
the
treaty
and
when
it
intends
to
do
so,
but
he
did
not
have
an
answer.
Until
then,
the
Senate's
letters
continue
to
send
a
powerful
signal
to
the
President
that
it
will
reject
the
treaty.
Although
the
Senate
cannot
"unsign"
the
treaty,
we
will
continue
to
build
opposition
and
issue
guidance
under
the
hope
that
a
future
President
can
do
just
that.
I
am
proud
to
lead
the
Senate
in
fighting
to
uphold
the
fundamental
individual
rights
of
Americans
by
reiterating
our
rejection
of
the
U.N.
Arms
Trade
Treaty.

Providing
Ag
Industry
Relief
from
Transportation
Regulation
On
Wednesday,
I
joined
several
senators
in
introducing
S.
654,
bipartisan
legislation
to
eliminate
the
regulation
requiring
agriculture
industry
professionals
to
obtain
a
hazardous
material
endorsement
before
transporting
diesel
fuel
for
many
agricultural
operations.
Specifically,
this
bill
exempts
agribusiness
participants
from
the
requirement
to
obtain
a
hazardous
material
endorsement
while
operating
a
service
vehicle
carrying
less
than
1,000
gallons
of
diesel
fuel,
provided
the
tank
containing
diesel
fuel
is
clearly
marked.
Under
current
regulations,
any
driver
transporting
more
than
119
gallons
of
diesel
fuel
is
required
to
obtain
this
endorsement
on
their
Class
A
Commercial
Driver's
License.
As
I
visit
with
Kansas
farmers
and
ranchers,
regulatory
overreach
by
the
federal
government
is
often
cited
as
their
greatest
threat.
Those
who
work
in
agriculture
should
not
be
forced
to
jump
through
hoops
just
to
haul
the
necessary
quantities
of
diesel
required
to
fuel
their
operations. Click

Sponsoring
Bill
to
Revoke
Bonuses
to
VA
Employees
Responsible
for
Misconduct
This
week,
I
sponsored
a
bipartisan
bill
to
rescind
bonuses
paid
to
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
employees
who
were
involved
in
the
manipulation
of
waitlists.
On
Monday,
the
House
of
Representatives
passed
a
similar
bill.
In
the
wake
of
the
VA
scandal
last
year,
those
responsible
for
manipulating
waitlists
and
mistreatment
of
veterans
should
be
held
accountable
for
their
actions.
The
VA
used
wait-time
metrics
as
a
factor
in
determining
employee
bonuses,
which
incentivized
some
VA
employees
to
maximize
their
bonus
payments
by
using
secret
waitlists
to
artificially
inflate
compliance
data.
According
to
one
report,
employees
at
the
Phoenix
VA
hospital
&ndash;
where
the
scandal
first
broke
&ndash;
received
approximately
$10
million
in
bonuses
since
2011
while
simultaneously
using
secret
waitlists
to
hide
delays
in
patients
receiving
care.
I
believe
VA
medical
centers
and
CBOCs
in
Kansas
are
filled
with
good,
hard-working
people
who
want
to
care
for
veterans
by
providing
quality
health
care.
But
revelations
of
systemic
failures
at
the
VA
demonstrates
what
can
happen
when
bureaucracy
in
Washington
gets
in
the
way
of
an
organization's
mission
and
ability
to
properly
serve
veterans.

Joint
Session
of
Congress
with
Israeli
Prime
Minister
Benjamin
Netanyahu
On
Tuesday,
I
attended
a
joint
session
of
Congress
to
hear
Israeli
Prime
Minister
Benjamin
Netanyahu's
address.
The
Prime
Minister
discussed
his
country's
concerns
about
the
prospect
of
Iran
developing
nuclear
weapons.
I
welcome
his
assessment
of
the
threats
a
nuclear
deal
with
Iran
would
pose
to
Israel
and
appreciate
his
insight
as
an
experienced
leader
in
the
Middle
East.
In
the
Senate,
I
will
continue
to
support
legislative
efforts
to
allow
Congressional
review
and
approval
of
any
nuclear
agreement
with
Iran.
The
United
States
and
our
allies
around
the
world
have
too
much
at
stake
to
accept
a
potentially
dangerous
nuclear
deal
that
disregards
the
concerns
of
Congress
and
the
American
people.
Visiting
with
AIPAC
Delegates
from
Kansas
This
week,
I
visited
with
Kansas
delegates
to
the
2016
AIPAC
Policy
Conference.
More
than
80
people
from
our
state
traveled
to
Washington,
D.C.,
to
attend
a
conference
and
speak
to
their
elected
officials
about
the
importance
of
a
strong
United
States-Israeli
relationship.
The
most
dominant
topic
in
our
discussion
was
the
pending
nuclear
negotiations
with
Iran
and
the
implications
for
Israel.
During
our
conversation,
I
expressed
my
continued
determination
to
deny
Iran
nuclear
weapons
capability
and
reject
any
policies
that
might
undermine
the
security
of
the
United
States
and
our
allies
abroad,
including
Israel.
Thanks
to
all
who
made
the
trip
to
Washington
to
voice
their
opinions
on
this
and
other
critical
issues.
Meeting
with
Fort
Riley
Leadership
and
Touring
Irwin
Army
Community
Hospital
Back
in
Kansas
over
the
weekend,
I
met
with
Brigadier
General
Eric
Wesley
at
Fort
Riley.
We
discussed
the
incredible
turnout
of
the
Listening
Session
a
few
weeks
ago.
I
also
toured
the
new,
state-of-the-art
$343
million
Irwin
Army
Community
Hospital
and
medical
campus,
which
features
unique
evidenced-based
design.
Fort
Riley
families
are
looking
forward
to
its
opening
as
much
as
the
surrounding
community
health
care
partners.
For
example,
the
operating
room
is
50
percent
larger
than
their
other
operating
rooms.
They
also
have
a
new
inpatient
behavioral
health
wing
and
the
labor
delivery
and
recovery
suites.
Every
detail
to
enhance
and
support
quality
of
life
for
our
soldiers
was
considered
and
incorporated.
I
will
continue
to
work
to
make
certain
Fort
Riley
receives
the
support
it
deserves
so
the
Big
Red
One
can
continue
to
defend
our
nation.
Thanks
to
BG
Wesley
and
his
wife
Cindy
for
hosting
the
visit.
Concordia
Rotary
Club
I
was
able
to
return
home
to
Kansas
in
time
for
Concordia's
Rotary
Club
meeting
because
of
a
shortened
Congressional
schedule
due
to
inclement
weather
in
Washington,
D.C.
The
conversation
centered
on
the
implementation
of
the
VA
Choice
Act,
keeping
rural
America
alive
with
access
to
health
services
and
education,
and
the
FCC's
net
neutrality
order.
I
appreciated
hearing
the
members'
thoughts,
suggestions
and
concerns.
The
former
president
of
the
Rotary
Club,
Gordon
Morrison
was
in
attendance
and
brought
me
a
Four-Way
Test
to
hang
in
my
office.
As
a
Rotarian,
I
appreciated
having
a
copy
to
remind
me
of
the
four
principles
Rotary
Club
stands
by:
Our
actions
should
be
true,
fair,
build
good
will,
and
be
beneficial
to
all
concerned.
Thanks
to
current
Concordia
Rotary
Club
President
Patrick
Sieben
for
allowing
me
to
visit
and
speak
this
week.
Here,
I'm
pictured
with
Junior
Rotarians
of
the
Month
Jaden
Payeur
and
Robin
Daniels.
Visiting
Clay
Center
High
School
I
was
also
in
Clay
County
to
visit
with
students
and
staff
at
Clay
Center
Community
High
School
(CCCHS).
I
enjoyed
meeting
with
the
senior
class.
My
visits
to
Kansas
schools
help
me
to
learn
more
about
the
successes
and
challenges
educators
face
in
providing
Kansas
students
opportunities
to
a
quality
education.
As
Congress
works
to
reauthorize
the
Elementary
and
Secondary
Education
Act
&ndash;
the
primary
source
of
federal
aid
for
K-12
education
&ndash;
these
visits
help
me
to
gain
valuable
insight
about
how
Kansas
educators
work
to
meet
the
unique
needs
of
their
students.
Thanks
to
CCCHS
Principal
Bud
Young
for
hosting
my
visit.
Kansas
City
Kansas
Chamber
Luncheon
Friday
I
attended
the
Kansas
City
Kansas
Chamber
of
Commerce
Annual
Meeting.
It
was
a
great
opportunity
to
visit
with
many
business,
religious
and
civic
leaders
in
Wyandotte
County.
More
than
600
members
listened
to
General
Motors
North
American
Manufacturing
Vice
President
Cathy
Clegg
discuss
their
latest
innovations,
including
a
new
450,000
square
foot
paint
shop
at
the
Fairfax
facility
&ndash;
a
$600
million
investment.
Sporting
Kansas
City's
Greg
Cotton
who
is
the
2015

and
the
workforce
in
Wyandotte

Visiting
the
Lawrence
Public
Library
On
Friday,
I
visited
the
Lawrence
Public
Library.
It
was
great
to
see
the
significant
remodeling
and
improvements.
Lawrence
Public
Library
Director
Brad
Allen
invited
me
a
few
months
ago
to
visit.
The
library
serves
the
city
of
Lawrence
and
offers
many
services
including
a
collection
of
more
than
250,000
books
and
other
materials,
homebound
delivery,
a
senior
living
center
bookvan
service,
public
computers,
and
meeting
rooms,
as
well
as
extensive
programming
and
exhibits/displays.
Below,
I'm
pictured
with
longtime
children's
librarian
Linda
Clay.
Retirement
of
Dr.
Fred
Cholick
Robba

many
faculty,
staff
and
supporters
on
Friday
to
wish
Fred
and
Cathy
Cholick
best
wishes
as
Fred
retires
from
K-State.
Dr.

2004
to
be
Dean
of
the

of
Agriculture
and
most
recently
has
been
President
of
the
very
successful
