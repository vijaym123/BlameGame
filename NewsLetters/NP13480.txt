The Hill Report
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of December 16 - 20, 2013
This week, the Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee came to the 32nd Congressional District to hold a field
hearing on the ObamaCare navigator program. This field hearing was
called due to two instances in North Texas where navigators were
encouraging applicants to lie on their application in order to qualify
for subsidies or keep their premiums down. However, these two events
highlight the lack of training, vetting, and oversight of the navigator
program.
I was joined by Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa and my Texas colleagues
Blake Farenthold, Randy Neugebaeur, Michael Burgess, and Marc Veasey at
the congressional field hearing on Monday. The witnesses were Kevin
Brady, the Deputy Chief of Staff for the Texas Department of Insurance,
Carolyn Goodwin, the President-Elect of the Dallas Associations of
Health Underwriters, and Dr. Randy Farris, the Regional Administrator
for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.You can read their
written testimony here:

Throughout the hearing it became apparent that the Administration has
done far too little to ensure that the navigators are properly trained
and vetted to protect Americans' personal information and to ensure
that illegal activity does not occur. Fortunately, the state of Texas
is proposing its own rules to pick up the slack. I will continue to
monitor the navigator program and am confident that my colleague
Chairman Issa will continue to investigate and hold the Administration
accountable with his work at the Oversight Committee.
TBI & PTSD Initiative
On Friday, the Senate approved the National Defense Authorization Act
for Fiscal Year 2014, which included my amendment with Congressman Mike
Thompson (D-CA-01) to expedite access to innovative treatments for
members of the Armed Services suffering from Traumatic Brain Injuries
(TBI) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). I'm pleased to
announce that the next step is for the president to sign it into law.
As you may remember, I have worked to advance this proposal for the
past several years and I'm extremely grateful that my colleagues in
both the House and Senate have joined me in supporting this important
step for TBI and PTSD treatment.
Our initiative creates a pilot program that will allow military
patients to receive care from private physicians who provide innovative
treatment options not necessarily available within military medical
facilities. To reach the long-term objective of incorporating the best,
cutting-edge medical practices into military hospitals, the treatment
initiative requires an annual report to Congress on the results of the
program.
Constituent Meetings
On Tuesday, I had the opportunity to tour the DRS Technologies facility
in Dallas. DRS Technologies is a leading supplier of defense products
that focuses on developing, manufacturing, and supporting a broad range
of mission critical systems to support homeland security and the
military's current and future operations. It was a pleasure to meet
with the people who make sure our service men and women are equipped
with the best products available.

Also on Tuesday, I met with Garland city employees and residents to
discuss transportation issues. We also discussed solutions for other
issues in the community and our shared goal of making Garland a great
place to work and live.

On Thursday, I participated in an interview with students from Berkner
High School who are participating in C-SPAN'S StudentCAM documentary
competition. I enjoyed talking with the students about the issues
facing our nation today, and my role as a representative for the people
of North Texas.
