Dear
Friends,
Developing American energy is critical to
growing our economy. This week, the House passed
three
bills
to increase energy production on federal lands, prevent
unnecessary regulations, and increase construction of natural gas
pipelines.
Private sector
technological innovations are fueling an energy boom on private and state
lands. Sadly, due to the Obama Administrations hostility, oil and
natural gas production is down on federal lands. The
Federal
Lands Jobs and Energy Security Act
would reverse this
trend by establishing an efficient and effective process to responsibly
produce both renewable and conventional energy on our federal lands.

Also, despite a six decade record of safe and effective
hydraulic fracturing regulation at the state level, the President has
once again bowed to his extreme environmentalist base by proposing a new
layer of unnecessary federal regulations. The
Protecting
States Rights to Promote American Energy Security Act
would stop this new tangle of job-killing Washington red
tape.
Finally, the permitting process
for natural gas pipelines is outdated and is contributing to a shortage
of pipeline capacity, which has caused price spikes in some regions
of the country. The
Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform
Act
would streamline the process and help build up
Americas energy infrastructure.
More American energy means more economic growth, more jobs, and
lower energy costs. Unleashing America's energy potential will require
Washington basing policy on what is best the American people, not what
pleases the President's radical environmentalist friends. These three
bills are solid steps in the right
direction.
Stay in touch
and God bless,
