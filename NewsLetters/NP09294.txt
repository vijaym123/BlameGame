Dear Friends,
The Memorial Day weekend officially started the summer, but it signifies something deeper and more profound.
Every year, before we start the season of backyard barbeques and family vacations, we stop to pay tribute to those who gave their lives to give us our freedom as Americans.
Last weekend, I was honored to participate in Memorial Day events in Northern Ohio and also at the tenth anniversary commemoration for the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C.
As the author of the legislation that created the Memorial, I joined Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, former U.S. Senator Bob Dole and others to recognize the inestimable contributions of the "Greatest Generation," which defeated tyranny and literally saved democracy for the world.
Everyone who contributed to the World War II victory was a hero, both overseas and stateside.

The World War II generation, now in their late eighties and nineties, is fading into history. But Memorial Day reminds us to carry their legacy with us every day--because we are Americans and because a grateful nation will never forget.
Sincerely,
U.S. Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur
Representing Ohio&rsquo;s 9th Congressional District
