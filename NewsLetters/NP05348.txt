Upton holds hearing on U.S. response to Ebola outbreak
This week, Southwest Michigan Congressman Fred Upton held a hearing with some of the nations top health officials to examine the U.S public health response to the Ebola outbreak. Upton serves as Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has broad jurisdiction over health issues. The bipartisan hearing focused on the role of U.S. public health agencies and their efforts to prevent the spread of Ebola within the United States.
We need all hands on deck. We need a strategy. And we need to protect the American people, first and foremost, said Upton. Its not a drill
peoples lives are at stake, and the response so far has been unacceptable.

The preparedness of U.S. ports, points of entry, health care facilities, and other institutions to identify, diagnose, isolate, and treat Ebola patients in a safe and appropriate manner were also evaluated during the hearing.
We need a plan to treat those who are sick, to train healthcare workers to safely provide care, and to stop the spread of this disease here at home and at its source in Africa. This includes travel restrictions or bans from that region beginning today, continued Upton.
Surely we can find other ways to get the aid workers and supplies in to these countries. From terrorist watch lists to quarantines, there are tools used to manage air travel to assure public safety. Why not here? We can no longer be reacting to each days crisis. We need to be aggressive and finally get ahead of this outbreak.
Upton directly questioned Dr. Thomas Frieden, Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), on the use of travel restrictions from regions of Africa impacted by the fatal disease.
