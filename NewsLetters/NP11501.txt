Friends,
When Alabamians have trouble with the federal government, my job is to
step in and try to help. That's exactly what happened when a new
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation imposed costly
inspection and compliance requirements on Alabama farmers.
For years, EPA regulations for fuel storage on farms authorized under
the Clean Water Act of 1972 applied only to very large fuel tanks, or
those with a history of spills. Now, the EPA is applying the
regulations to smaller tanks and farming operations with no history of
accidents.
As you probably know, agriculture is the top industry in Alabama,
employing more than 580,000 of our citizens. Like in many industries,
aggressive agriculture regulations from Washington increase costs,
stifle opportunities, and make life difficult for farmers.
Thomas Adams from Henry County was one such farmer who was impacted.
The new EPA rules would force him to spend thousands of dollars for
special equipment and services to certify that his fuel tanks were
compliant. Learn more about Thomas's story by watching his WTVY News
interview
in the clip above.
Americans are tired of the endless stream of heavy-handed regulations
coming out of Washington. I worked with my colleague Representative
Rick Crawford of Arkansas on the FUELS Act
, which seeks to rein in EPA farm regulations
to truly reflect risk. Specifically, the FUELS Act would exempt fuel
tanks under 10,000 gallons from the regulation and allow larger tanks
without a history of accidents to self-certify.
I am pleased to report that the House passed the FUELS Act on March 11
in an unanimous voice vote. I was proud to work on behalf of Thomas
Adams and all Alabama farmers to find a solution to this problem and
help provide some much-needed relief. Now, we are urging the Senate to
pass this bi-partisan legislation without delay.
This is just one example of the harmful impact overreaching federal
regulations can have on small businesses, farms, and individuals. If
you know of an overly burdensome regulation that is hurting you or your
business, please write to me or visit Roby.House.gov
and let me know.
Combating Executive Overreach
One of the top questions I am asked is what Congress is doing to
address the pattern of executive overreaches and disregard for the law
by President Obama and his administration. Good, God-fearing Americans
who work hard, pay their taxes, and obey the law are understandably
frustrated by a president who acts as if he is above the law.
I believe in our Constitution, and I believe it's worth fighting for.
That's why I was proud to support two bills passed this week by the
House designed to rein in the Obama Administration and open the door to
legal action to challenge particularly egregious abuses of power. While
the separation of powers may not always be convenient for President
Obama's political goals, it is necessary to ensure government still
derives its authority from the people, not the other way around.
The Week Ahead
It was busy in Washington last week. Officials from the Montgomery
Chamber of Commerce, the Dothan City Commission, Alabama Farmers
Federation, Electric Cities of Alabama, and a number of local
businesses all came by the office. I appreciate all of those who took
the time to meet with my staff and me.
Next week, I will once again hit the road to make a number of stops
throughout the Second Congressional District. I'm planning to visit
with students at Samson High School, meet with officials in Houston and
Coffee Counties, attend the change of command ceremony at Fort Rucker,
and visit the Civil Air Patrol at Maxwell Air Force Base. I hope to see
some familiar faces while I am on the road.
It is an honor to serve as your voice in Washington. As always, do not
hesitate to contact my office
if we can ever be of assistance to you.

Combating
Executive
Overreach
One
of
the
top
questions
I
am
asked
is
what
Congress
is
doing
to
address
the
pattern
of
executive
overreaches
and
disregard
for
the
law
by
President
Obama
and
his
administration. Good,
God-fearing
Americans
who
work
hard,
pay
their
taxes,
and
obey
the
law
are
understandably
frustrated
by
a
president
who
acts
as
if
he
is
above
the
law.
I
believe
in
our
Constitution,
and
I
believe
it&#8217;s
worth
fighting
for.
That's
why I was
proud
to
support
two
bills
passed
this
week
by
the House
designed
to
rein
in
the
Obama
Administration
and
open
the
door
to
legal
action
to
challenge
particularly egregious abuses
of
power.
While
the
separation
of
powers
may
not
always
be
convenient
for
President
Obama&#8217;s
political
goals,
it
is
necessary
to
ensure
government
still
derives
its
authority
from
the
people,
not
the
other
way
around.
The
Week
Ahead
It
was
busy
in
Washington
last
week.
Officials
from
the
Montgomery
Chamber
of
Commerce,
the
Dothan
City
Commission,
Alabama
Farmers
Federation,
Electric
Cities
of
Alabama,
and
a
number
of
local
businesses
all
came
by
the
office.
I
appreciate
all
of
those
who
took
the
time
to
meet
with
my
staff
and
me.
Next
week,
I
will
once
again
hit
the
road
to
make
a
number
of
stops
throughout
the
Second
Congressional
District.
I&#8217;m
planning
to
visit
with
students
at
Samson
High
School,
meet
with
officials
in
Houston
and
Coffee
Counties,
attend
the
change
of
command
ceremony
at
Fort
Rucker,
and
visit
the
Civil
Air
Patrol
at
Maxwell
Air
Force
Base.
I
hope
to
see
some
familiar
faces
while
I
am
on
the
road.
It
is
an
honor
to
serve
as
your
voice
in
Washington.
As
always,
do
not
hesitate
to
contact
my
office
if
we
can
ever
be
of
assistance
to
you.
