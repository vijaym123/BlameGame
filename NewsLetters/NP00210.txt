Dear Friends,
Whether its buying
that first home, raising a child, or saving for a dignified retirement,
student loan debt is making it difficult for hard-working New Mexico
families to get ahead.
According to the Department of Education,
borrowers in the U.S. are carrying $1.3 trillion in student loan debt,
including $6.1 billion from borrowers in New Mexico.
During this period of historically low interest rates, consumers have
had the opportunity to refinance loans on homes, cars and more,
locking in rates that will save them money in the years to come.
Unfortunately, student loan borrowers have been left out, unable to
refinance their loans and cut their bills.
I have cosponsored
legislation that takes a commonsense step to fix this.
The Bank on
Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act enables student loan
borrowers, including those with graduate and parent loans, to refinance their
loans at a lower interest rate, providing an opportunity for borrowers
to reduce their payments and put thousands of dollars back in their
pockets.
This straightforward change would help 134,000 New
Mexicans with student loan debt while also giving our economy a
boost.
Refinancing loans at todays lower interest rates would save
families an estimated $50 billion nationwide
thats money they could
reinvest in their local economy rather than spend on high interest
rates.
This legislation stands in stark contrast to the
Republican budget recently passed by the House that cuts Pell Grants by $89
billion and freezes funding for 10 years 1 .
It also
eliminates a provision that prevents low-income students with need-based
loans from accruing interest while they are still in school, adding
$34.8 billion to the indebtedness of Americas
students 2 .
A college education is one of the most valuable investments a
family can make.
Congress should stand with New Mexico families
by giving relief to student loan borrowers and taking steps to make a
quality education more affordable and
accessible.
Sincerely,
Ben Ray Lujn
