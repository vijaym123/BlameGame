Touring the
District
It's wonderful to
be back in beautiful Western North Carolina. With Congress in recess
for the month of August, I've used my time back home to meet with
constituents, local businesses, and community leaders. Below are some
highlights from my travels throughout the district thus far. If you're
interested in setting up a meeting with me or having me visit your
business, don't hesitate to reach out to my office.
Meeting with National Forest
Officials
Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to meet with
North Carolina National Forests Supervisor Kristin Bail and National
Forests Public Affairs Officer Stevin Westcott. Kristin and her team do a
fantastic job managing our National Forests and ensuring they stay a
beautiful and safe tourist destination. Every year, North Carolina's
National Forests draw as many as 7 million visitors. I appreciate their
service to North Carolina.

Presenting Grant Checks to Volunteer Fire and
Rescue Teams
It's a great honor as your
Congressman to have the opportunity to present grant checks to volunteer
fire and rescue squads throughout the District. This week, I presented
grant checks to Etowah Horse Shoe Volunteer Fire and Rescue
Department, Clay County Fire and Rescue, West Buncombe Volunteer Fire
Department, North Canton Fire Department, Clyde Volunteer Fire
Department, and Savannah Volunteer Fire Department in Sylva, NC.
Thank you all for your hard work and dedication to protecting our
community. I'm grateful for your service.

Visiting
Local Industry
This week, MGM Brakes' invited me to tour their
manufacturing facility in Murphy, NC. MGM Brakes has developed a system of
electronic brake monitoring-- a hugely important safety precaution for
semi-trucks, motor coaches and passenger buses. Plant Manager Robin
Jenkins and CEO Ron Parker, my hosts during the visit, gave me a
fascinating look into the work their facility is doing in Cherokee
County.

My wife Debbie
and I had the opporunity to visit the Old Dominion Freight Line
facility in Asheville, which recently expanded its service center.
Since opening their doors in 1997, Old Dominion has experienced
considerable growth and now employs 33 people at its new service
center.

Join Me at the North Carolina Business
Summit
For 18 consecutive years, the North
Carolina Congressional delegation has hosted the North Carolina
Business and Economic Development Summit in Washington, D.C. I'm happy to be
a cosponsor once again this year. This two-day event is a
valuable opportunity for business leaders to learn, collaborate, network, and
discuss common legislative and management concerns. As always,
registration for the North Carolina Business and Economic Development Summit
is offered for free.
