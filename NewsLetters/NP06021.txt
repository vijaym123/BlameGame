Last week, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a
report
on abortion coverage in the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The report was requested by House congressional leaders and demonstrates that, through subsidies,
taxpayer dollars are going to pay for over 1000 health insurance plans that include abortion .
The ACA includes provisions requiring that if a plan covers abortion (in cases other than rape, incest or to save the life of the mother), a separate payment for abortion
- an abortion surcharge - must be collected.
However, according to the report, this requirement is not being strictly followed.
This is yet another example of the Administrations repeated failure to provide basic transparency about abortion coverage. In response, I have supported the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, ( H.R. 7 ),
which makes permanent restrictions on the federal funding of abortions .
It also incorporates provisions of the Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act ( H.R. 3279 ), which I cosponsored, to provide full disclosure and transparency of abortion coverage to consumers who are shopping for health insurance plans on the exchanges. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 227 to 188.
Yours in service,
Randy
