Congressman Perry to Hold Town Hall Meetings
YORK, PA
To offer constituents the opportunity to share their concerns regarding issues before the United States Congress and the federal government, U.S. Representative Scott Perry (PA-4) will be hosting a series of town meetings over the next week.
The dates and times of the town meetings are:
Friday, July 18 / 12:00 p.m.
1:30 p.m.
Lower Windsor Township Building, 2425 Craley Road, Wrightsville
Friday, July 18 / 5:30 p.m. - 7:00 p.m.
Upper Allen Township Building, 100 Gettysburg Pike, Mechanicsburg
Saturday, July 19 / 10:00 a.m.
11:30 a.m.
Fairfield Fire and EMS, 106 Steelman Street, Fairfield
Constituents will be updated by Congressman Perry on the issues currently facing Congress, including the federal budget, job creation and national security.
Afterwards, Congressman Perry will welcome questions on these and other federal issues.
For me to effectively represent constituents in Congress, I regularly need
and seek - their feedback on the issues facing our country, Perry said.
These town meetings continue Congressman Perrys efforts to solicit constituent feedback. Since taking office in January 2013, hes met with hundreds of constituents via individual meetings and site visits, conducted regular in-person town and tele-town meetings, and aggressively has utilized social media to interact with the citizens he serves. More than 10,000 constituents have signed up for regular updates via Congressman Perrys e-newsletter, Facebook or Twitter pages. Social media venues allow him to solicit constituent feedback and provide information on the issues before Congress, while also saving hard-earned taxpayer resources.
Residents who are unable to attend the meetings in person are welcome to contact Congressman Perry and his staff at any of his offices, or via Perry.House.Gov, where they can sign up for e-mail updates and for his Facebook, Twitter, You Tube, Instagram and Pinterest pages.
