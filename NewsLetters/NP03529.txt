Congressman Conaway Statement on Passage of Hire More Heroes Act
Washington
- Congressman Conaway released the following statement upon passage of The Hire More Heroes Act of 2015:
The men and women who have proudly served our nation deserve access to the same opportunities that every citizen does. The Hire More Heroes Act helps small businesses ease the financial burdens of complying with Obamacare and incentivizes them to hire veterans. Under this legislation, employers will no longer be required to count those who are receiving healthcare through the Department of Veterans Affairs towards their total number of full-time employees that determines the businesss standing under Obamacare.
This commonsense legislation simply fixes one of Obamacares many faults: it doesn't require businesses to pay for health insurance for those who are already receiving it. Our veterans have proven their dedication and willingness to work. Its time we showed them the same in return.
