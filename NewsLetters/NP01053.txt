Congressman McHenry Weekly Update
First Joint 10-Year Balanced Budget Since 2001
This week the House continued to build upon a
successful first 100 days
of our new majority with passage of
a joint balanced budget resolution . The joint resolution was the product of negotiations between members of the House and Senate Budget Committees. The plan we passed which will be considered in the Senate soon cuts over $5 trillion in spending, generates $400 million for the nation's economy and fully repeals Obamacare, all without raising taxes. Passage of the joint budget resolution also continues to highlight our new majorities ability to get things done as this plan represents the first 10-year balanced budget to clear the House since 2001. You can read my full statement on passage of the joint balanced budget below.

Proud to Support
With passage of a joint budget resolution in the House and Senate, the focus turns to passing the twelve government funding bills that come before Congress annually. The House began that process this week the earliest in the year it has begun since 1974 with passage of bills funding
Veteran's Affairs, military construction ,
energy and water . I was proud to support both of these funding bills including the VA portion which increases funding for the care of our nation's veterans by almost five billion dollars. You can learn more about both of these bills at the links above and see highlights from each in the graphics below.
What I Have Been Reading
VA staff cheered: Asheville center rated best in US
Asheville Citizen-Times
Last year's news reports of massive wait times at VA facilities across the country were deeply disturbing. However it must be acknowledged that all VA facilities are not as poorly run, included in that group is the Charles George VA Medical Center in Asheville. Just this week it was revealed the Asheville VA is ranked first for patient satisfaction throughout the VA system. I have visited the Asheville VA on multiple occasions and observed the high quality service first hand. Congratulations to the Asheville VA staff on this much-deserved recognition.
Community commemorates Vietnam War 50th anniversary
Camp Lejeune Globe
This week marked the 50th anniversary of the start of the Vietnam War. The anniversary provides an opportunity to give thanks to all the brave American men who served during the war and remember all those who did not return home. Regardless of what you think about the war, we must remember and thank all those who served our country at that time.
