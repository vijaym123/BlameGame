Friends,
What would you
do if you had $170,000 left over in your annual budget?
You
would probably go on a vacation, pay down your mortgage, purchase new
equipment for a business, or invest it in your company.
Our
Congressional Offices budget is not money we have earned or a profit we have
generated; our budget is your tax dollars.
My team and I have
carefully budgeted your money throughout the year, always looking for
ways to save money and cut costs.
As such, we finished the year
with more than $170,000 left over.
Last week, I gave this money
back to the U.S. Department of Treasury and requested that it be used
to pay down the national debt.
It may not seem like a lot of
money in the scheme of things, but I want you to know that we are
safeguarding your tax dollars.
Rest assured, I will continue to apply
these same fiscally conservative principles to our office budget and the
national budget.
Rewarding
Generosity
As Americans, we are known
around the world for our generosity.
People of all ages give
their time, money, and resources to others in need.
In 2013,
Americans gave $335.17 billion
a 4.4% increase from 2011. Since charities
are crucial to assisting families, children, schools, and
organizations, my colleagues and I have advanced solutions that encourage people
to give charitably.
Last week, we passed a bill that would
rewards taxpayers who give generously to others by allowing them to deduct
more of their charitable giving from their taxes.
This bill makes
permanent a tax credit for restaurants and businesses that donate
left overs to charities, like a local soup kitchen.
H.R. 644, the
America Gives More Act, also ensures that elderly retirees can
generously give distributions from their IRAs without being additionally
taxed.
We must always continue to support and encourage our
countrys exceptional generous
spirit.
Providing Relief for Small
Businesses
Many of our districts small
businesses need to purchase equipment today in order to stay in business
tomorrow.
Our business owners need certainty and a tax code that
allows them to plan for the future.
On Friday, I joined my
colleagues in passing legislation that reforms a portion of our tax code, so
small business owners can exempt more equipment now, rather than
having to spread out these purchases over time.
H.R. 636, Americas
Small Businesses Tax Relief Act of 2015, also amends this tax credit
so to allow businesses to write off infrastructure purchases like
computers and air conditioners, which are essential in operating in a
business in our districtespecially in the
summer.
Constituent
Spotlight:
I had the opportunity to meet with representatives from
Northeastern Technical College in Washington, D.C. for the American
Association of Community College Trustees and the Association of Community
Colleges Summit.
The summit covered education topics that are
important to students, educators, and families in our state like Pell
Grants, funding for Community Colleges, and the reauthorization of the
Higher Education Act.
After our meeting, we went on a quick tour
of the Capitol. Here we are on the Speakers balcony.

Boardwalk Earns Top Tourism
Prize
Our Myrtle Beach Boardwalk was
awarded the Governors Cup by the South Carolina Parks, Recreation, and
Tourism Department for the economic impact it has had on our community
and state.
Since the boardwalk opened in 2010, it has attracted
new businesses to Ocean Boulevard and inspired new attractions like
the Sky Wheel.
The Sun News reports, The Governors Cup is the
latest in a string of accolades for the 1.2-mile boardwalk. Its
regularly been listed by the likes of Budget Travel and National Geographic
as one of the top boardwalks in the country, as well as being
recognized by Travel + Leisure magazine. State leaders said all the mentions
and other national publicity are worth about $2 million and that 11
million people visit the boardwalk area each year.
Congratulations
to the Myrtle Beach Boardwalk for winning the top tourism award in
the
state!
