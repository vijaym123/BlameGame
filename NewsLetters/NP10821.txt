Strengthening America's Energy Independence
On Wednesday, I introduced a bill that would serve five very important
purposes: create jobs, strengthen America's energy independence,
encourage STEM education, offer veterans job training, and help lower
energy prices for low-income families.
The SEA Jobs Act, or Southern Energy Access Jobs Act, would pave the
way for responsible offshore energy production, as well as providing
access to job training for veterans, creating partnerships for STEM
education between industry, state universities, and HBCU's, and
dedicating 10% of all new federal revenues to paying down our deficit.
We have seen how control of energy production can affect national
security with the situation in Ukraine. For too long, we have been
dangerously reliant on other countries for our energy needs-it's time
to start developing the resources we have right here at home.

Restoring the 40-Hour Workweek
This week, I introduced an amendment that will restore the 40-hour
workweek. The Obamacare employer mandate currently requires employers
to provide health insurance to full-time employees and makes the new
definition of a "full-time" employee as one working 30 hours per work
week.
As a result, many employers are cutting hours for employees to fewer
than 30 hours per week-effectively cutting their pay by 25%.
For
families who are already working hard to make ends meet, this can be
devastating.
For this reason, my amendment will restore the definition of a full
week's work to 40 hours, and help get people back into full time jobs.
Strengthening Our Federal Workforce Training
Right now in America, 4 million jobs are sitting empty-65,000 of them
just in South Carolina. I introduced my SKILLS Act as an amendment
earlier this week in order to modernize and cut bureaucratic waste out
of the federal government's maze of 35 overlapping workforce training
programs.
We need to make sure Americans are prepared for continued success in
the workforce, and that starts with education and workforce training.
Watch me discuss my two amendments on the Senate floor below, and read
more about them here

Please join me in keeping the victims and their families of the Fort
Hood tragedy in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time,
and pray that they begin to find peace.
Sincerely,
Tim

Restoring
the
40-Hour
Workweek
This
week,
I
introduced
an
amendment
that
will
restore
the
40-hour
workweek.
The
Obamacare
employer
mandate
currently
requires
employers
to
provide
health
insurance
to
full-time
employees
and
makes
the
new
definition
of
a
&#8220;full-time&#8221;
employee
as
one
working
30
hours
per
work
week.
As
a
result,
many
employers
are
cutting
hours
for employees
to
fewer
than
30
hours
per
week&#8212;effectively
cutting
their
pay
by
25%.
For
families
who
are
already
working
hard
to
make
ends
meet,
this
can
be
devastating.
For
this
reason,
my
amendment
will
restore
the
definition
of
a
full
week&#8217;s
work
to
40
hours,
and
help
get
people
back
into
full
time
jobs.
Strengthening
Our
Federal
Workforce
Training
Right
now
in
America,
4
million
jobs
are
sitting
empty&#8212;65,000
of
them
just
in
South
Carolina.
I
introduced
my
SKILLS
Act
as
an
amendment
earlier
this
week
in
order
to
modernize
and
cut
bureaucratic
waste
out
of
the
federal

of
35
overlapping

We
need
to
make
sure
Americans
are
prepared
for
continued
success
in
the
workforce,
and
that
starts
with
education
and
workforce
training.
