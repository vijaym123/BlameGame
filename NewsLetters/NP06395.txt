David --
Despite working the same jobs, Illinois women
still
earn just 77 cents to every dollar that men earn.
That means middle class families have less money to put food on the table, gas in their cars, and even just pay the bills. Sadly, Republicans in Congress refuse to act.
Just yesterday, the Senate rejected the Paycheck Fairness Act -- a commonsense bill that would ensure equal pay for equal work.
Pathetic. David, join me in demanding Congress ensure equal pay for equal work by signing our petition &gt;&gt;
Thanks for stepping up,
