Congressional Report -- Week of May 12-16: Remembering Officer
Bobby Deckard and Deputy Bubba Kennedy
Hello Friend,
I spent part of the week traveling and meeting with constituents in the
23rd District of Texas - visiting El Paso, San Antonio and Alpine .
Thursday was the most difficult day. I joined the families of two Texas
law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty in 2013 as they
participated in the 33rd Annual National Peace Officers' Memorial
Service in Washington, D.C.
I headed back to Texas on Thursday evening and finished the week
attending meetings and visiting with constituents in San Antonio. This
morning, I'm speaking at a citizenship ceremony and then Nicols, my
son, and I are off to attend an air show in Hondo.
Field Representatives were also busy during the week. They visited
Eagle Pass, Del Rio, Eldorado, Sonora, Ozona, El Paso, Van Horn,
Presidio, Culberson, and various parts of San Antonio.

Remembering Law Enforcement Officers Bobby Deckard and Bubba Kennedy
On Thursday, I participated in the 33rd Annual National Peace Officers'
Memorial Service held in nation's capital. I joined the families of San
Antonio Police Officer Robert "Bobby" Deckard and Upton County Deputy
Sheriff Billy "Bubba" Kennedy in laying a wreath in memory of the two
law enforcement officers from 23rd District of Texas. Both were young,
they were parents of young children, and dedicated to their communities
- and each was killed in 2013 while on duty.
It was a somber morning as the nation honored Bobby, Bubba and other
fallen heroes. As a parent, I know I want to live long enough to see my
son grow up. I thought about what Bobby and Bubba will be missing. I
was hit particularly hard by the young kids at the ceremony. They've
lost Christmases, birthdays, baseball and the general good times that
come with hanging out with their dads and, in some cases, their moms.
I knew Bubba - and I've gotten to know Bobby through the people around
him. They were two exceptional law enforcement officers who died while
serving and protecting us. Bobby and Bubba will forever live in our
hearts and memories. I admire their families, friends and loved ones
for their resilience. And, I want them to know that they do not walk
alone.
San Antonio Police Officer Robert "Bobby" Deckard died on Dec. 20,
2013, after being wounded during a pursuit. He was 31 years old. Upton
County Deputy Sheriff Billy "Bubba" died in the line of duty on Oct. 2,
2013, while responding to a call in McCamey, Texas. He was 37 years
old. To view pictures of the ceremony, click here

Presidio Rocketry Clinches 4th Place in Nation at Rocket Contest
Last Saturday, Presidio High School's Rocketry Team placed 4th in
national at the 2014 Team America Rocketry Challenge. The all-day event
was held at the Great Meadow in The Plains, Virginia, near Washington,
D.C. The students competed with hundreds of other students, ranging
from 7th grade to seniors in high school, from throughout the country.
These kids came a long way from Presidio, Texas, to Washington, D.C.,
and to walk away as one of top five teams in the nation is quite a
feat. Teams from Presidio, one of the most remote and poor school
districts in Texas, have become regular attendees at the national
rocketry championship. It's a matter of time before these talented
young scientists take 1st place.
Presidio High School students were able to work in groups or by
themselves to build and launch a rocket following strict guidelines
regarding weight, length of rocket, altitude and time. Their sponsors
are Shella Condino, an AP Physics teacher at Presidio High School,
Adelina Portillo, English as a Second Language teacher at Presidio High
School, and Darwin Condino, staff at Presidio Independent School
District.
The team will receive $3,000 as part of the 4th place win. Their score
was 26.72. For more on their story, click here

Congratulations to Presidio High School students for placing 4th in
nation at Team America Rocketry Challenge.
Coming Home to the Sul Ross Commencement Ceremony, 2014
Commencement Day is always special, but for me, it's particularly
special at Sul Ross State University in Alpine - my alma mater. It
brings back so many memories. I love being there. It's hard to believe
it's been 32 years since I graduated.
I had the high privilege of speaking to the Class of 2014. So much
talent and potential. So much energy and enthusiasm. I wished the
graduates well and asked them to always keep close to what is really
important in their lives: their family.
Good luck, graduates! May God bless your every endeavor.
A special shout out to my official photographer for the day - my son,
Nicols. Nothing like giving a kid a job to keep him interested and out
of trouble. Nicols did an excellent job in taking so many good
pictures. To read a local article on commencement at Sul Ross, click

Visit to Fort Bliss in El Paso
On Monday, I spent several hours at Fort Bliss in El Paso and met with
many Soldiers and Marines. I am so proud of our men and women in
uniform.
Visiting with the 1st Armored Division and Brigade Modernization
Command was yet again clear proof that we have the best military in the
world. Some of our service members from Fort Bliss are serving all over
the world, while many others here at home are training and testing the
latest equipment that will help us save lives on the battlefield.
As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I'm doing everything
possible to make sure that our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines
have the training and equipment they need so we can keep the best
military in the world. I thank Fort Bliss for hosting us on Monday and
look forward to our continued work.
Mobile Office Hours for May
As we do every month, field staff will host mobile office hours
throughout 23rd District of Texas during May. Field Representatives
will be meeting with constituents to provide help with federal agencies
and departments.
Field staff makes it a priority to be accessible to constituents in the
29-counties that make up the Congressional District, and I take the job
of addressing the needs of those I represent seriously. I invite those
facing an issue with a federal agency or department to meet with staff
at our mobile office locations or at any of the district offices. To
see where field staff will be this month, please click here. To contact
a casework, go to www.gallego.house.gov and call one of the district
offices.
Lastly, thanks again for letting me be your congressman. If I can help
you with a federal agency or issue, please call on any of our offices.
The phone numbers and addresses are listed below. I've never been a big
fan of politics - helping people is my favorite part of the job. Please
put us to work for you.
Sincerely,
Pete P. Gallego

Robert

and
Upton

Kennedy
in
laying
a
wreath
in
memory
of
the
two
law
enforcement
officers
from
23rd
District
of
Texas.
Both
were
young,
they
were
parents
of
young
children,
and
dedicated
to
their
communities
&#8211;
and
each
was
killed
in
2013
while
on

It
was
a
somber
morning
as
the
nation
honored
Bobby,
Bubba
and
other
fallen
heroes.
As
a
parent,
I
know
I
want
to
live
long
enough
to
see
my
son
grow
up.
I
thought
about
what
Bobby
and
Bubba
will
be
missing.
I
was
hit
particularly
hard
by
the
young
kids
at
the
ceremony.
They've
lost
Christmases,
birthdays,
baseball
and
the
general
good
times
that
come
with
hanging
out
with
their
dads
and,
in
some
cases,
their
moms.
I
knew
Bubba
&#8211;
and
I've
gotten
to
know
Bobby
through
the
people
around
him.
They
were
two
exceptional
law
enforcement
officers
who
died
while
serving
and
protecting
us.
Bobby
and
Bubba
will
forever
live
in
our
hearts
and
memories.
I
admire
their
families,
friends
and
loved
ones
for
their
resilience.
And,
I
want
them
to
know
that
they
do
not
walk
alone.

it's
particularly
special
at

&#8211;
my

It
brings

it's
been
32
years

I
graduated.
I
had
the
high
privilege
of
speaking
to
the

So
much
talent
and
potential.
So
much
energy
and
enthusiasm.
I
wished
the
graduates
well
and
asked
them
to
always
keep
close
to
what
is
really
important
in
their
lives:
their
family.
Good
luck,
graduates!
May
God
bless
your
every
