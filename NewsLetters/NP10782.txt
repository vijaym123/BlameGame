The Hill Report
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of April 7 - 11, 2014
This week, the House of Representatives and the American people were
presented with a choice of two futures. Our nation can either stay on
the Democrats' current path of higher taxes, increased spending, and an
onslaught of debt, or we can chart a new course.
Budget Committee
Chairman Paul Ryan's "Path to Prosperity" budget offers a choice that
the American people deserve - a plan that will ensure a sound fiscal
future for generations to come by balancing the budget in ten years,
lowering taxes, and reducing wasteful spending by $5.1 trillion.

I believe that we must get our fiscal house in order so that we can
jumpstart our economy and expand opportunity for the American people.
That will require tackling the drivers of our debt, reforming our
broken tax code, and repealing ObamaCare.
We also cannot continue to
kick the can down the road and ignore the need to strengthen health and
retirement security for our seniors and future retirees.
I was proud to once again support Chairman Paul Ryan's responsible
budget plan that will spur job creation, reenergize the free enterprise
system, and put our nation on a sustainable path. If you'd like to read

IRS Scandal Update
Over the past several months, the House of Representatives has
investigated the IRS's intentional targeting of conservative groups and
political opponents of the president. The House Oversight and
Government Reform Committee, chaired by Congressman Darrell Issa, has
worked diligently to pursue the truth and found that former IRS Exempt
Organizations division Director Lois Lerner played a central role in
the scandal.
On Thursday, the Oversight Committee adopted a resolution
recommending the House hold Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress for
refusing to testify before the Committee.
Additionally, it was reported this week
that there was suspected illegal political
activity taking place at a local IRS office in Dallas. In the coming
weeks as the House pursues holding Lois Lerner in contempt, I will
continue to monitor the situation in Dallas and fight to hold the IRS
accountable for its blatant misuse of resources and power.
DFW Summit
On Tuesday, I had the pleasure of meeting with members of the Dallas
Regional and Fort Worth Chambers of Commerce during their annual visit
to Washington, D.C. I spoke with them about my ideas to create jobs for
North Texans, the budget proposal we were debating in the House this
week, the need for an all-of-the-above energy plan, and the importance
of protecting the free-enterprise system. I always value the
opportunity to talk with North Texas business leaders in order to find
ways that we can work together to spur job growth and strengthen our
economy.

Congressional Art Competition People's Choice Awards
Each year during the Congressional Art Competition, I am always blown
away by the talent of the students in the 32nd Congressional District.
On Wednesday, our panel of judges carefully reviewed each submission at
the Art Institute of Dallas and chose the winners.
In addition to
their selections, there will also be a "People's Choice Award," which
will be chosen through online voting. All constituents are encouraged
to participate, and voting will be open until noon on Thursday, April
17. To cast your vote for your favorite piece of artwork, click here

Have a good weekend.

IRS
Scandal
Update
Over
the
past
several
months,
the
House
of
Representatives
has
investigated
the
IRS&#8217;s
intentional
targeting
of
conservative
groups
and
political
opponents
of
the
president.
The
House
Oversight
and
Government
Reform
Committee,
chaired
by
Congressman
Darrell
Issa,
has
worked
diligently
to
pursue
the
truth
and
found
that
former
IRS
Exempt
Organizations
division
Director
Lois
Lerner
played
a
central
role
in
the
scandal.
On
Thursday,
the
Oversight
Committee
adopted
a
resolution
recommending
the
House
hold
Lois
Lerner
in
contempt
of
Congress
for
refusing
to
testify
before
the
Committee.
Additionally,
it
was
reported
this
week
that
there
was
suspected
illegal
political
activity
taking
place
at
a
local
IRS
office
in
Dallas.
In
the
coming
weeks
as
the
House
pursues
holding
Lois
Lerner
in
contempt,
I
will
continue
to
monitor
the
situation
in
Dallas
and
fight
to
hold
the
IRS
accountable
for
its
blatant
misuse
of
resources
and
power.
