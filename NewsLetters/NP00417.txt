Hello,
It was good to be home this week for
a District Work Period. Every few weeks, my colleagues and I go home
to work throughout our Congressional districts and hear from our
constituents.
Besides getting to
sleep in my own bed, I appreciate these weeks because I am truly able to
travel throughout Ohio's 14th District to meet with constituents,
community leaders, business owners and any other folks I get the chance to
run across. The more I am able to hear what you are thinking, the
better I am able to serve you.
Memorial Day
On Monday, it was
an honor to speak in Walton Hills and Mentor to remember those who
served and sacrificed for our
nation.
High School Senior
Projects
Throughout
the year, we have a number of high school students who complete
internships and class projects by joining our office.
This week I got to meet Brent
Levy, a Senior at Solon High School who has been working in our
Twinsburg office this semester. He'll be starting at the University of
Cincinnati in the fall. Good luck to
him!
Art
Competition
I recently announced the winners of the Congressional Art
Competition.
This week, I had a chance to meet with each of
them, they are impressive young artists and
students.
A special Thank You to
Lakeland Community College for hosting their
pieces.

Accomplishments
I'm looking forward to a productive June, but here's a look back
at some of what we accomplished in Congress this
month.
Six bills dedicated to
expanding opportunities and services for veterans
- so that the brave
men and women who defend our freedom are never
forgotten.
Four bills in honor of
Police Week
- so that we show appreciation to those protecting our
communities and the officers killed in the line of
duty.
The Regulatory Integrity
Protection Act
- so that property owners are protected from a government
regulatory power grab over our nations
water.
The National Defense Authorization
Act
- so that our armed forces can meet the challenges they face
keeping America safe and have the funds
necessary.
The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act -
so that Congress and the American people have a say in any agreement
on Irans nuclear
program.
The USA Freedom Act -
so that Americans civil
liberties are protected while maintaining our intelligence agencies
capabilities to defend the
homeland.
The Legislative Branch appropriations bill -
so
that we can continue to limit Congress spending on itself, which has
resulted in $782 million in savings to taxpayers since the Republican
majority began in 2011. And Im happy to report I returned
$100,000 back to the treasury last
year.
9 bills to spur innovation -
so that we
invest in and promote the entrepreneurial spirit that will lead to the
next big idea.
Extended authorities under the Highway Trust Fund -
so that we
continue critical infrastructure projects during the busy construction
season.
The
Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act and the Justice for Victims of
Trafficking Act -
so that we protect the most vulnerable among
us.
As you can see, we have
been working hard in Congress and I will continue to do serve you to the
best of my ability every
day.
