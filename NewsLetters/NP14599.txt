Levin Opposes Nuclear
Waste Dump
On October 31, Reps. Levin, Kildee,
Dingell and Peters voiced their opposition to a proposed nuclear waste
dump in Ontario, Canada, less than a mile from Lake Huron.
In a
letter
to the Canadian
Nuclear Safety Commission, the Michigan lawmakers wrote, This nuclear
storage facility is anticipated to remain radioactive for centuries; as a
result, it will impact the people of both countries for
perpetuity....
Neither the U.S. nor Canada can afford the risk of polluting
the Great Lakes with toxic nuclear
waste.
Senate Advances Workplace Non-Discrimination
Bill
On November 4, the Senate took a key vote to advance a bill
that would ban employment discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual
and transgender workers.
The Senate is expected to approve the
Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) this week.
The landmark
Civil Rights Act already prohibits employment discrimination on the
basis of race, religion, gender, national origin, age and
disability.
ENDA would extend that protection by making it unlawful to hire,
fire, promote, or compensate people differently based on sexual
orientation or sexual identity.
Rep. Levin is a cosponsor of
ENDA.
Once approved by the Senate, ENDAs future is unclear.
While the legislation likely would have enough support to pass in the
House of Representatives, House Speaker Boehner opposes the bill and
could block a vote from taking
place.
Remembering Families in Need
On October 30, Rep.
Levin went before the first Farm Bill conference committee meeting to
urge lawmakers to remember the millions of needy Americans
nearly
half of whom are children
who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program (SNAP).
Over the weeks ahead, Rep. Levin and the
other Farm conferees will be working to reconcile the two very
different versions of the Farm Bill approved by the House and Senate.
The House version of the Farm Bill would cut SNAP by nearly $40 billion
over ten years, throwing several million people off the
program.
At the meeting,
Rep. Levin reminded the
committee what was at stake :
When I have talked to teachers, and
these are in suburban school districts, in many cases they have a
drawer in their classroom filled with food because children come to
school hungry....
There is a severe nutrition challenge to millions
of families in this
country.
Michigan Lawmakers Meet to Debate Issues
On November
4, Michigan Reps. Sandy Levin and Mike Rogers met at the Detroit
Economic Club for what turned out to be an informative and civil discussion
of issues before Congress.
The two lawmakers fielded questions
on a broad range of issues ranging from the new health care law, to
Detroits bankruptcy proceedings, to the recent federal government
shutdown.
For more details, see the
Detroit Free
Pres s summary of the discussion.
