I&rsquo;m so grateful for you, David.
You didn&rsquo;t back down when the odds were against us.
And in the last 24 hours, you&rsquo;ve completely outdone yourselves. Since President Obama emailed you, over 46,OOO of you have stepped up! Boehner never saw that coming!!!
If we can hit 5O,OOO donations to President Obama&rsquo;s call-to-action today, we can deliver shocking upsets to Boehner&rsquo;s Republicans tomorrow (even in deep-red states!).
Just 9 donations from the 60659 zip code to go.
David -- Can I count you in? All Donations to this Email Quadruple-Matched Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
Nancy
