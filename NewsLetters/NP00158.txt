Rep. Curbelo on House passage of Medical Device Tax repeal, Trade Promotion Authority
Washington, D.C.
Today, the House took an important step forward in addressing the debilitating tax on medical devices by passing H.R. 160, the Protect Medical Innovation Act of 2015. In addition, the House voted again on Trade Promotion Authority. Rep. Curbelo offered the following statement:
H.R. 160 will repeal the $30 million medical device tax which took effect under the Affordable Care Act on January 1, 2013.
Since its implementation, this harmful tax has cut 33,000 American jobs, fringed upon patients access to life-saving products, and suppressed growth and modernization in our industries. Recently, several large businesses have announced their plans to end expansion in the U.S. or lay off workers because of the negative repercussions that result from medical device tax.
I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of H.R. 160, which will create more job opportunities for advancement in the American research and development sectors.
These industries are important to expanding innovation, which is vital to creating new life-saving products that will provide Americans with better quality healthcare.
I was also pleased to see the House reaffirm its support for Trade Promotion Authority by passing H.R. 2146 .
In South Florida, we see the benefits of free trade every day in the form of job creation and new markets for small businesses.
Our community is often referred to as "The Gateway to the Americas", and I'm proud to support this TPA bill that will create unprecedented transparency and Congressional oversight for all future free trade agreements. I look forward to continue working in a bipartisan manner towards both House and Senate passage of TPA.
On June 18, 2015, the House passed
H.R. 160
by a vote of
280-140
and
H.R. 2146
by a vote of
218-208.
