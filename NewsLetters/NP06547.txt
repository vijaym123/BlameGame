Administration Fails to Protect Americans on
Healthcare.gov :
Yesterday, the
Wall Street Journal
reported :
A hacker broke into part of the HealthCare.gov
insurance enrollment
website in July
and uploaded
malicious software, according to federal officials.
In
April, I sent a letter to all federal agencies that have a stake in the
HealthCare.gov website, requesting these agencies address the ongoing
security weaknesses and do more to protect Americans private
records. The millions of Americans who lost their health coverage, and were
forced onto the federal exchange, deserve peace-of-mind knowing their
sensitive information is safe.
In the
Administrations response to my letter
dated August 1st, 2014
they state there
has been no successful security attacks on Healthcare.gov. Based on
the Wall Street Journals report, we now know that there had been an
attack and their official statement was not true. Whether they were being
intentionally deceitful or simply unware of this attack, we do not
know. However, we do know, unequivocally, that this very expensive
website was clearly not ready for primetime. Since the roll out of the
Obamacare exchange websites, experts have warned us that there are major
security shortcomings and that millions of Americans personal,
financial, and health information could be at risk. I continue to doubt the
Administrations ability to adequately manage families sensitive and
private information, and I will keep pushing all relevant agencies to be
accountable to the American people.

Ransom Hospital Memorial Visit With
Mayor Reed :
While in Ottawa, I also had the
opportunity to tour Ransom Memorial Hospital with Mayor Linda Reed. We
discussed a number of concerns, from mental health care delivery to
ensuring lower volume hospitals have the resources they need to provide
care for the community.
COF Training Services
Tour :
I want to thank the staff at COF Training Services
Inc. for sitting down with me to discuss the services they provide for
the community. We had an informative conversation about specific rules
and regulations coming down the pike that would adversely impact their
ability to provide critical support services for people with
intellectual/developmental disabilities.
