Not So Fast-Track :
Today, Maine's 2nd District Congressman Bruce Poliquin stood up for Maine
families and opposed his Republican Party's leadership and President
Obama by voting against granting the White House
"fast-track" trade negotiating authority.
As someone who has created jobs, I understand how
important it is for companies to be able to sell their goods and services
overseas. However, my primary responsibility is helping to protect and
grow our 2nd District jobs by making sure our mills, factories, and
other employers are able to compete on a level playing field in the
global market place. This proposed fast track legislation does not
achieve that goal.
Knowing Where Your Food Comes From Is
Cool : On Wednesday, the House of Representatives passed
the Country of Origin Labeling Amendment Act.Despite most of the Republican
leadership urging him to vote in favor of this bill, Congressman Poliquin
voted to keep
country of origin labeling .
Mainers deserve to know what country their beef, pork
and chicken come from before putting it on the kitchen table for the
family to eat. I will always listen to the people of Maines Second
District and vote with their best
interest.

following:
As

for securing our liberties and keeping us safe from
harm.
