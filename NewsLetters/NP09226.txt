Dear Friend,
Yesterday, we gathered together on
Memorial Day to remember all of the brave
men and women who have served our country
and in particular we paid tribute to all of
those who have paid the ultimate price for
our freedoms. Each and every one of these
courageous men and women, those who are
serving today and those who have gone
before us, answered the call and stood up
to protect our beloved country and keep us
safe.
Earlier this year, we gathered together
to share the story of one of our very own
heroes from Akron, Ohio
Sergeant
Dominic Eritano. Sergeant Eritano served
during the Second World War and later
reenlisted to fight on behalf of Americans
in Korea. This past January, I had the
profound honor of presenting his family
with the Silver Star medal along with
several others that he earned for boldly
confronting the enemy and selflessly
defending his unit -- allowing them to
escape to safety. Sadly, on June 24
th , 1951, he was listed as
missing in action, but will never be
forgotten.
Sergeant Eritano isnt the only
hero from Ohios 16
th
district. It is with great
sadness that we reflect on the grave loses
our local community has suffered over the
years. Lieutenant Jason
Catdog Manse from North
Canton passed away while on a training
mission serving his country. Jason flew
over 50 combat missions in Iraq during
Operations Southern Watch and Iraqi
Freedom. Corporal Dustin Derga from
Uniontown lost his life during combat
operations with Lima Company, 3
rd
Battalion, 25
th
Marine Regiment while serving
as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. We lost
Lieutenant Sharon Lane from Canton while
she was aiding injured service members at
the 312
th
Evacuation Hospital in
Vietnam. Lieutenant Lane was the only
American Servicewoman killed as a result of
hostile fire in Vietnam. Private First
Class Walter Rinas of Strongsville died on
October 1, 1944 by sniper fire while
administering first aid to an injured
comrade during the heat of battle in
France.
Each of these brave men and women put
themselves in danger in order to protect
others. They loved their country like so
many other Ohioans and Americans who have
loyally defended our nation for more than
200years. They are examples of what
America is at its best.
We are all forever grateful to all of
those who have fought so valiantly on
behalf of our nation, as well as all of
those who are bravely serving today.
Im also thankful for those who
recognize our fallen heroes every day. From
the third graders at Norwayne Elementary
School who raise the flags at the Ohio
Western Reserve Cemetery to the Patriot
Guard Riders who hold Old Glory high at
funerals, our community memorializes and
remembers those who serve on a daily basis.
As we enter the summer months, we should
all resolve to memorialize those who gave
up so much to preserve the freedoms that
make each of us uniquely American.
