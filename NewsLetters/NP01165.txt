Dear Friends,
As they say, April showers bring May flowers. As we welcome warmer
weather, we should also be prepared for severe weather and tropical
storms. While there is only so much we can do to prevent damage caused
by these natural hazards, there are many steps we can take to be
prepared.
That's why today I'm
sending you this message about being prepared for emergencies to kick
off America's PrepareAthon! This nationwide campaign led by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency
and Ready.gov
is a call to action to increase Americans' preparedness for
emergencies. There are plenty of ways you can be prepared for severe
weather hazards at home and in your community. Some basic protective
measures include designating a plan for evacuation and shelter, making
an emergency supply kit, and signing up for emergency alert systems
available in your area.
In Delaware, the lowest-lying state in the nation, there are specific
steps we can take to gear up for severe weather. To start, learn the
elevation level of your home so you know how a flood may affect you. If
a storm is coming, cover your windows properly and reinforce your
doors. Insure your property.
For more information to stay prepared, check out Ready.gov
and America's PrepareAThon!
website for useful
drills, trainings, and resources. You can even register your
preparedness activities
in order to coordinate with community
members and take part in discussion forums. I encourage all Delawareans
to register yourself or your school, business, place of worship, or
other group, and be empowered with the knowledge and skills needed in
case of a disaster. To register, visit www.ready.gov/prepare
and join the Americans who have pledged to help their
families and communities.
If you have concerns about emergency readiness or any other issue,
please contact me through email
