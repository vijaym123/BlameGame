OUR OPINION: Michigan's Upton continues his voting streak
February 11, 2014
If, as the familiar quotation goes, "80 percent of success is showing up," U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-Michigan 6th District, is giving his constituents a good run.
Upton is the only member of the U.S. House of Representatives to have a
perfect record of voting attendance
since the beginning of 2010.
Upton's four-year streak is shared by Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Charles Grassley of Iowa, and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. The Congressional Quarterly reports that the House held 2,902 roll call votes between 2010 and 2013, while the Senate held 1,076. There were other members with perfect attendance, but they weren't eligible for all votes during the period.
A month into the 113th Congress, Upton is extending his good record.
We expect that our U.S. representatives and senators on rare occasion might have important reasons for missing a particular vote.
Some votes, of course, are more significant than others. And then, too, there were votes last year that we wished some of our congressional representatives hadn't turned in as they did.
Upton is right, though, in pointing out that it's a congressional member's job to represent the interests of his or her constituents on every issue decided.
Just a little something for voters to keep in mind.
