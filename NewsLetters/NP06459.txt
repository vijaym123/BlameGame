ICYMI: Rubio Responds To
Obamas Strategy To Defeat
ISIL
On Thursday, Marco responded to
President Obamas speech on the
Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant
(ISIL) terrorist group in a series of
morning interviews.
Following his interviews on
NPRs
Morning Edition ,
CNNs
New Day ,
CNBCs
Squawk Box , and
FOX
News Americas
Newsroom , Marco issued the
following statement:
I believe the President is in
a much better place than where he was a
few weeks ago, when he was downplaying
ISILs capabilities to threaten
Americas security and the
moderate Syrian rebels ability
to fight the radical Islamists.
However, I am concerned by the
Presidents view that we should
try to replicate what weve done
in Yemen and Somalia, which remain
dangerous places because of the
terrorist threat. And I remain
concerned by his unwillingness to
prepare the American people for what
will likely be a long, difficult
struggle.
As this debate moves forward,
I hope the President will step up and
make his case to the American people
that we will do whatever it takes,
however long it takes, to defeat ISIL
and protect the American
people.
Rubio Comments On Senate Passage Of
Resolution Honoring Lives Of Slain
American Journalists, Condemning
ISIL
On Wednesday, Marco welcomed the
Senates passage, by unanimous
consent, of
a
bipartisan resolution
honoring the
lives of American journalists James Foley
and Steven Sotloff, and condemning the
Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant
(ISIL) terrorist organization that
brutally murdered them. In addition to
Marco, the resolution was sponsored by
Senators Bill Nelson (D-FL), Jeanne
Shaheen (D-NH), Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), and
Bob Menendez (D-NJ).
In a wide-ranging U.S. Senate
floor
speech on Tuesday evening , Marco paid
tribute to Florida native Steven Sotloff,
and honored his noble and courageous work
as a journalist in the Middle East. His
tribute is below:
The second point, which I
thinkis related to my comments
herein a moment, is towards
thefamily of Steven Sotloff
wholost his life tragically in
theMiddle East over the last
fewdays. We all are familiar with
that horrific tale, said Rubio.
Steven actually lived in
Miami,Florida with his
family,literally blocks away from
whereI go to church, literally
blocks awayfrom where I
live.He was a member of our
communityand an
American.
As I said last week at
hismemorial service,
Stevenhad dedicated his life to
revealingthe suffering and the
reality ofwhat was happening in
some of the mostdangerous areas
of the world, Rubio added.
And while he lost his
lifetragically, I think it
isironic and appropriate that
inhis last act, as he lost his
life,he revealed the true nature
ofwhat we confront in that part
ofthe world and the true nature
ofthe Islamic State
and
who theyare and what they're all
about.
And this was a young man who,
asI said, dedicated his life
notjust to journalism, but to
journalismin the most dangerous
part ofthe world, Rubio
continued. And in so doing,
wasable to bring that reality to
useven in the last moments of
hislife.
Marco, joined by a group of bipartisan
Senators, also
introduced
a bill
authorizing up to $10 million
in rewards for information leading up to
the arrest and conviction of any
individuals involved in the kidnapping
and murders of American journalists James
Foley and Steven Sotloff.

In Washington Post Outlook:
Lets Reject The Veiled
Isolationism Of Obama And
Clinton
Read Marcos op-ed in
The
Washington Post
s Outlook section regarding
the dangers of President Obamas
and former Secretary of State Hillary
Clintons disengaged foreign
policy. An excerpt of the piece is
below:
Five and a half years of the
Obama/Clinton worldview has given
Americans a graphic and often horrific
view of the chaos that is unleashed in
the world when America walks away from
its traditional role as the guarantor
of global security. From Syria and Iraq
to eastern Ukraine and the South China
Sea, we are seeing what the world will
look like if our leaders continue
choosing detachment: more violence,
rivals and partners alike taking
advantage of our inaction, and a steady
increase in threats to our citizens and
to our prosperity.

On Senate Floor, Rubio Calls On Reid
To Hold Vote On Venezuela Sanctions
Bill
During a wide-ranging U.S. Senate
floor
speech on Tuesday evening , Marco
called on Senate Majority Leader Harry
Reid (D-NV) to schedule a vote on S.
2142, the
Venezuela
Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society
Act of 2014 , a bill authorizing
sanctions on individuals involved in
serious human rights violations against
peaceful demonstrators in Venezuela. The
legislation is currently being blocked
from being unanimously passed by the full
U.S. Senate at the behest of Citgo, the
Venezuelan regimes wholly owned
U.S. subsidiary. An excerpt of his speech
is below:
In Latin America, we have
seen an erosion of democratic order,
the rise of anti-democratic governments
that threaten to erode almost two
decades of democratic progress in the
region,
said Rubio . By the way,
in this body we have endeavored to
address one of those challenges in
Venezuela
an outrage, a place
full of corruption and human rights
violations, an anti-American government
that does everything possible to
undermine us and our interests, not
just the interests of their own
people.
And weve been blocked
in our efforts to address it because
somehow the Venezuelan government,
acting through Citgo, a wholly owned
company of the Venezuelan government,
got lobbyists to come here to the
Senate and lobby for blockage and
stoppage of a measure that we were
ready to pass by unanimous
consent,
Rubio added . And so I
come to the floor to ask the Majority
Leader to please schedule a vote on
these sanctions on Venezuela because it
will pass overwhelmingly.
Do not allow lobbyists for
the Venezuelan government to be able to
come to Washington, D.C. and impede
action on this matter,
Rubio concluded .
In recent weeks, Marco has
published an opinion column in
Louisianas
The Daily Advertiser
challenging U.S. Senator Mary
Landrieus block of the bill, and
urged Reid to hold a full Senate vote
in
a letter .
Constituent Casework Corner
Leslie, a resident of North Florida,
contacted Senator Rubios office to
request assistance for her mother. Her
mother is the widow of a WWII veteran and
she applied for Dependency and Indemnity
Compensation (DIC) from the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA). With her
mothers consent, a member of the
staff contacted the agency and was
subsequently told that her application
was approved. The VA deposited a
retroactive check into her bank account
last week. In addition, she will
receive a monthly DIC payment of
$1,538.75.
