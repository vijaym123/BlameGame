Maintaining an Open
Dialogue
Throughout last week, I held several meetings across the state
of Utah.
After meeting with local officials, media companies,
business leaders, employees, and industry leaders in Utah's thriving
private sector, I left with a better understanding of the issues that are
on the minds of many Utahns.
I have included a summary of these
visits below.
If you haven't been in contact with me for a
while, I would love to hear from you:

Meeting with Local
Officials
On Thursday morning, I met with a group of legislators
from the Utah House of Representatives.
It was an engaging and
lively discussion with many of our state legislators, and we spent
several hours discussing issues such as healthcare, education, and how I
can best be a resource to our state legislature.
Breakfast with Legislators
I also spoke
at the investiture of Judge Carolyn McHugh to the United States Court
of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. I supported Judge McHughs
nomination, the first female member of this court to be appointed in over 20
years.

I had an enjoyable tour of ABC4 Studios in
Salt Lake City by Richard Jones, the General Manager.
I met with
many of the employees of Channel 4, and had an in-depth interview with
Glen Mills, Channel 4s political reporter, who asked me questions
about my bipartisan Smarter Sentencing Act, which I am co-sponsoring with
one of my Democratic colleagues in the Senate.
We also
discussed the Transportation Empowerment Act.

On Wednesday morning I was part of an executive roundtable with
several dozen heads of companies that are listed on NASDAQ.
Many of
these companies are technology companies.
We had a very engaging
conversation about the patent reform bill I am co-sponsoring with
Senator Leahy and how patent trolls are crippling many companies in
their industries.
I also met with regional Comcast
representatives to discuss Utah-specific issues regarding infrastructure and
access.
As Utah continues to be one of the world's foremost locations
for new businesses, entrepreneurship, and the tech industry, it was
important to hear from one of our state's internet providers regarding
the importance of high-speed internet access to these different sectors
and to Utahns.
On Thursday I met with over 60 Salt Lake
City-based employees of the Williams Company.
I provided a report of
the current issues facing Congress, and I was able to hear from these
hard-working Utahns about their industry, their concerns, and their
accomplishments.
I also had a very productive discussion with
the Utah Steel Fabricators Association.
This group comprises most
of the distributors, processors, and fabricators of steel in the
state of Utah, which represents many thousands of Utah jobs.
We
discussed the future of American manufacturing, and how certain reforms
can help job growth continue in Utah.
