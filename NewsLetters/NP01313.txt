Remembering Oklahoma City 20 Years Later
There are some dates that you remember with complete clarity for the rest of your life. Without question, Oklahomans will never forget where we were and what we were doing on April 19, 1995. The memory of that day 20 years ago will remain permanently imprinted in my mind as long as I live.
On that fateful day, I was serving as Secretary of State to Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating and was arriving at the state capitol building just at nine oclock. I felt the tremble and wondered what it was as I walked toward my office. I learned in the following hours that something terrible had happened in downtown Oklahoma Citysomething that would change our lives and communities forever.
From that moment forward, I watched Oklahomans and Americans come together to mourn and lend support where they could. I remember the bravery and strength displayed by first responders and the exceptional leadership of Governor Frank Keating, First Lady Cathy Keating, Oklahoma City Mayor Ron Norick and Congressman Frank Lucas in one of our darkest hours as a state.
That day, 168 innocent lives were senselessly claimed and prematurely taken, and irreparable holes still remain in communities. Children yearn for lost mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers grieve lost siblings, friends and loved ones miss the voices of their dear ones.
But even in the midst of tragedy due to a despicable act of domestic terror, Oklahoma shined triumphantly and showed the world that evil would not overcome good. Decency prevailed over the terror. Compassion was readily available and offered by countless individuals. And through this terrible nightmare, the people of the United States and Oklahoma demonstrated to the world that they would never be terrorized, never be humbled, would always be proud and always respond with compassion and courage when confronted with danger and disaster.
Today and always, we remember those we lost, we honor those who were up to the task to help us through it. And we remain grateful that we live in the greatest, the freest and the most compassionate country in the world.
Last week, I joined with House members of the Oklahoma congressional delegation in remembering April 19, 1995 on the House floor. The

above includes our tributes and the moment of silence we observed to honor those lost 20 years ago.
I also shared my personal reflections on that tragic time for our state
here .
