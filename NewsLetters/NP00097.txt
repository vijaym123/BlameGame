Dear Business Owners,
Have you ever thought about selling your goods or services to the federal government? But then you thought it&rsquo;s too complicated or even impossible? I have good news for you! I am hosting an event titled &ldquo;Cracking the Code&rdquo; where we will do exactly that. The federal government spends over $80 billion per year buying products from small businesses. I want to help you get a slice of that pie!
&ldquo;Cracking the Code: Small Business Access to Federal Government Contracting Opportunities&rdquo; will be held on Friday, July 17, 2015 at 9 am at the College of San Mateo (CSM). The event is designed for small and medium-sized Bay Area businesses.
In 2013, the federal government spent $83 billion buying products from small businesses. That accounts for about one quarter of all government contracting. Yet obtaining a government contract can be daunting, especially for small businesses or those with no prior government contracting experience. Terminology, registration, certifications, and identification of opportunities can pose obstacles for those trying to work with the federal government. The goal of Cracking the Code is to help businesses overcome these challenges.
The seminar will feature speakers and panels giving you an overview of the nuts and bolts of government contracting and provide you with the resources you need to begin seeking your own contracts. We will have representatives from the Northern California Procurement Technical Assistance Center, the Small Business Administration (SBA), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and other government agencies.
