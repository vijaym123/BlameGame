Information from the House Veterans
Affairs Committee
The hearing will explore the effectiveness of VAs mental health and
suicide prevention programs in reducing the prevalence of mental health
issues and suicide among veterans. In 2013, VA released the 2012
Suicide Data Report which found that 18 to 22 veterans per day commit
suicide, a number that has remained stable since 1999 despite significant
increases in the departments mental health and suicide prevention
budget, programs and staff.
Additionally, the hearing will look at access problems for veterans seeking
mental health care in light of persistent delays in care across the VA
health care system and a 2012 VA Inspector Generals report that found
the majority of first-time patients waited an average of 50 days to
receive a full mental health evaluation from the department.
