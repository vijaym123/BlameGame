This has been a busy week up in D.C. We have a
lot going on between working on Appropriations bills and trying to help
solve the issues with Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities across the
nation and Texas.
This week I, along with
four other Central Texas Congressmen, sent a
letter to President Obama
requesting the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) to conduct an independent investigation into the
criminal allegations at several central Texas Veteran Affairs (VA)
facilities. Although I have questions about the Department of
Justice and Eric Holder, the FBI is the best investigative body that we
have.
This weekend I will be meeting with several people from the
VA in Central Texas to discuss the situation
more.
In addition this week, the House passed
H.R. 4810 , the Veterans Access to Care Act ( Roll Call 287 ), which requires the Department of Veterans Affairs
to offer non-VA care at the departments expense to veterans who have
had extended wait times or live over 40 miles from a VA medical
facility. This will help our veterans get off the wait lists and into the
doctors office to receive the medical care they
need.
I am happy to announce that my bill
the FY15 Homeland Security Appropriations bill
passed
the full Appropriations Committee on Wednesday. I am proud to have put
together a strong bill with a dual focus on our national security and
border enforcement. Once again President Obama gave us an inadequate
and poorly justified budget request, which we now must rectify. This
bill restores the deep and irresponsible cuts the President has made to
critical law enforcement operations across DHS.
It ensures our
men and women working to keep Americans safe and enforce our laws have
the resources they need to carry out their vital duties and defend our
homeland. This bill now awaits a vote on the full House
Floor.
The full Appropriations Committee also voted to
pass the
FY15 Defense Appropriations
Bill
which funds our Nations security needs, military operations
abroad, and the health and quality of life programs for our armed forces
and their families.
Lastly, we had a major
leadership upset in our Nation's capital this week. Effective July 31,
Eric Cantor will resign as the House Majority Leader after losing in
his primary on Tuesday. Leadership elections are slated for June 19
and currently Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (CA-23) is running to replace
Cantor.
I will be back in Washington
Tuesday, June 17 for another busy week.
