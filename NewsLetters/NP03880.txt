Dear Friend,
This past week, the House of
Representatives and the United States
Senate came together to pass the FY 2015
Appropriations Omnibus Bill, or a bill more
commonly known as the
CRomnibus. Included in the
package were measures that heard more than
80 hours of debate as well as more than 400
amendments that were considered on the
House floor.
We had two choices this past Thursday
evening. The first option was to pass a
two-month continuing resolution that would
have given President Obama full authority
to execute his immigration plan and
eliminate all of the Houses
appropriations work. The second option was
to pass the cromnibus, which
included11 of the 12 appropriations
bills, and only funds Homeland Security,
where immigration enforcement is funded,
for 90 days.
If we passed a two-month continuing
resolution, the government would have
likely had to operate off of short-term
patches through next September. The
cromnibus funds the government through the
fiscal year and is the best course of
action to address the Presidents
executive overreach, which will be
revisited in the New Year once we have a
Republican majority in the Senate. There is
no question that a long-term spending
measure that reins in executive overreach
was the better option over continuing down
the path of stop-gap bills. For these
reasons, I supported it.
Though the cromnibus is far from
perfect, it includes several items that are
not only good for Northeast Ohioans, but
Americans everywhere. For example, it
benefits Northeast Ohioans by providing
funding for the Great Lakes Restoration
Initiative and an anti-heroin task force to
combat the growing problem in our region
and across the country. The measure reduces
funding for the IRS and EPA, and provides
funding to address the VA backlog and
appeals. I was also proud to support a pay
raise for military service members.
Additionally, it eliminates new funding for
the Presidents health care law, and
cuts IPAB funding by $10 million. It also
prevents a taxpayer bailout of the risk
corridor program within the
Presidents health care law, and
requires the Office of Inspector General
(OIG) to report to Congress on improper
payments of Obamacare subsidies.
I was pleased to see Congress come
together to find a bipartisan solution that
will provide the certainty Americans need
to plan for their futures. The package was
sent to President Obama over the weekend,
and and signed into law yesterday.
