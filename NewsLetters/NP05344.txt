Rubio Comments On Ebola Response
Following his visit to Miami
International Airport (MIA) on Thursday
to discuss Floridas Ebola
preparedness, Marco issued a statement
regarding President Obamas
selection of Ron Klain to coordinate the
U.S. governments Ebola response,
while also reiterating his call for a
visa ban on travelers from affected
countries:
As
I
expressed on Wednesday , its
important that the U.S. have someone
officially in charge of coordinating
the federal governments response
to the Ebola outbreak, both overseas
and here at home. This is a complex
challenge that must be addressed by a
wide range of government agencies, and
we need someone to make sure all the
different pieces are working in concert
to protect Americans and stop this
outbreak.
Already, concerns have been
raised about the Presidents
choice. I hope Mr. Klain will come
forward quickly with a set of concrete
actions to reassure Americans that this
administration is taking this situation
seriously, including but not limited to
common sense travel restrictions on
individuals from the affected countries
in West Africa.
Marco outlined five steps the U.S.
should take to beat Ebola in
an
op-ed for CNN.com .
Watch
NBC
Miami s coverage of
Marcos visit to MIA, where he
discussed Floridas Ebola
preparedness with Miami-Dade Aviation
Director Emilio T. Gonzlez and
Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos
Gimnez, along with other local
officials.
ICYMI: Rubio: If ISIL Succeeds In
Kobani, It Will Demoralize Our Ability
To Confront Them
In an interview on FOX News, Marco
discussed the threat the Islamic State of
Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terrorist
group poses to U.S. national security.
Below is an excerpt from his
interview:
Rubio: It would be deeply
demoralizing to this effort to allow
them to take territory. And for John
Kerry to say that, proves to you how
out of touch they are about this
reality. They are doing anything they
can to disengage us from this process
by doing the least amount possible. And
its leading to this terrible
outcome.

Rubio: Disgraceful That Obama
Administration Did Nothing To Stop
Venezuelas Bid To Join UN
Security Council
Marco issued the following statement
regarding the Venezuelan
governments successful bid to join
the United Nations (U.N.) Security
Council:
The Venezuelan government has
aligned itself with and supported the
illicit activities of state sponsors of
terrorism like Iran, North Korea and
Syria, which all threaten
Americas national security. It
has supported Russian aggression
against Ukraine. It has sided with
terrorist groups like Hamas and
Hezbollah, which are committed to
Israels destruction. It has
supported regional terrorism by the
FARC and allowed drug cartels to
conduct their narco-terrorism
activities in the Western Hemisphere.
It has routinely violated its
international commitments by eroding
democratic governance at home,
trampling over the human rights of
innocent Venezuelans, and supporting
Cubas own human rights abuses as
well.
On every single issue where
peace, democracy and human rights hang
in the balance, the Venezuelan regime
has stood on the side of aggression,
destabilization and authoritarianism.
As the events of this year have shown,
this Venezuelan regime has the blood of
innocent Venezuelans on its hands.
For these and many more
reasons, it is disgraceful that the
Obama Administration failed to lift a
finger in making the case why
Venezuelas membership on the
U.N. Security Council is undeserved,
further diminishes the legitimacy of
this body, and ultimately sends a
demoralizing message to the Venezuelan
people who have suffered under the
Chavez-Maduro regime. If any nation on
earth should speak out against
repressive governments like Venezuela,
it should be the United
States.
Earlier this month, Marco joined a
bipartisan group of senators in urging
Secretary of State John Kerry to lead
a
diplomatic effort against
Venezuelas bid .
