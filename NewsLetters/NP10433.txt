12th Congressional District Art Competition Entries Are In!
Every year since 1982, the U.S. House of Representatives has held The Congressional Art Competition.
Its sponsored by Members of Congress and is open to high school students in their individual districts.
I am proud to participate again this year and continue to be impressed with the quality and skill shown in each entry. For the 12 th
District, I have assembled a panel of local artists and art experts to select the first, second, and third place winners. This year weve decided to add a category and we need your help.
The peoples choice winner will be chosen by the number of likes each entry receives in the
special album
created on my
Facebook page . Select your favorite piece, or two, and ask your friends to join in the voting, as well!
Voting is open until 5pm on Wednesday, April 23, 2014.
The first place winner will have their work displayed, along with other winning pieces from across the country at the U.S. Capitol.
Second, third, and peoples choice winners will have their art displayed in my Central Ohio office for one year.
I thank all participants and am proud to showcase the artistic talents of 12 th
District residents. Dont forget to
vote !
