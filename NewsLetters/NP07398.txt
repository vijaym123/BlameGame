"...our model gives the Republicans a 60 percent chance of taking control" --
New York Times , 7/27/2014
Dear Friend,
It&rsquo;s a midterm year in a President&rsquo;s second term. Historically, that&rsquo;s a bad sign for the party that controls the Senate.
And the
New York Times
is forecasting a 60% likelihood that Republicans will pick up the seats they need to take control of the Senate.
No one expected this year&rsquo;s elections to be easy for Democrats. But the
Times&rsquo;
prediction is a stark reminder that even in a blue state like Massachusetts, we can&rsquo;t take anything for granted.
I&rsquo;m running hard, and we need to hit our $55,000 goal for August. Can you spare $5 to get us a little closer?

With the Tea Party House passing budgets that would end Medicare as we know it, there&rsquo;s simply too much at stake to let Massachusetts be one of the seats that could flip from blue to red.
Our grassroots network is committed to taking action on climate change. The Tea Party doesn&rsquo;t believe it exists. Our grassroots network stands up to protect Social Security. The Tea Party has proposed privatizing the program. Our grassroots network believes that medical research is the field of dreams from which we harvest the cures for diseases like Alzheimer&rsquo;s, Parkinson&rsquo;s, and cancer. The Tea Party supports cuts to the National Institutes of Health. We know what&rsquo;s at stake. We know what happened the last time Democrats took a midterm for granted. And we know we can&rsquo;t let that happen again -- help us hit our $55,000 goal for August by making a $5 contribution.
Thank you for your continued support.
