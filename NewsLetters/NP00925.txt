It might seem small
reaching for the phone to make that call; picking up your pen and writing a quick note; or even pulling out your phone to send a text. But when we stop and take a moment out of our days to
say thank you
to those who have made a difference in our lives, it can be a powerful thing.
This week, during National Teacher Appreciation Week, lets each remember to stop and show our gratitude to the teachers, parents, administrators, and many others who contribute to educating our children. They do so much to shape the future of our nation.
Yours in service,
Randy
