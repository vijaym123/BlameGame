Dear Friend,
This Administration refuses to tell the truth about Islamic terrorism,
but Sister Diana Momeka, an Iraqi Christian, will -- now that John
Kerry's State Department
is allowing her to visit the
United States.
A week ago, it appeared that might not happen in time
for the human rights leader to join her delegation on a trip to
Washington, D.C.
Of all of them, including
Shiite and Yazidi representatives, the Christian was the only member
whose application for a travel visa Kerry's agency denied. State
Department bureaucrats, essentially calling her a liar, claimed Sister Diana
was a risk to overstay her visa, although she is in the exact same
position as the others, victims of ISIS, who received permission to visit
the U.S. International organizations and members of Congress have
endorsed the sister's trip and are anticipating her
arrival.

This week, I sent a
letter to Secretary of State Kerry and
appeared on
radio
and
in print
to force the government to
reverse its terrible decision. My campaign exposed its double standard
and yesterday led to the news that the State Department finally approved
Sister Diana's visa. Whereas the Obama Administration will do
anything to obscure reality, this brave nun will do anything to illuminate
Christian persecution across the Middle East, and I'm glad I was able to
help her mission.
Please follow me on Facebook to learn more
about my work on the Tom
Lantos Human Rights Commission, where I investigate issues of religious
persecution and advocate for religious freedom around the
world.
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of Congress
