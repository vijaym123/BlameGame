Dear
Friends,
Four
years ago today President
Obama signed the Affordable
Care Act that enabled more
Americans to get affordable
health insurance coverage
than ever before and
simultaneously started to
curb health care costs that
amount to 17 percent of our
economy.
With
the March 31 deadline to
enroll in 2014 plans fast
approaching, Im asking
all Delawareans to make sure
you and your family have
health insurance.
If
you are not yet insured, you
can enroll at
ChooseHealthDE.com
or in person at an enrollment
event
near
you .
ChooseHealthDE.com
provides you with the
information you need to make
the best decisions for you
and your familys
health. On the website,
you can search among dozens
of plans, find out what it
costs, see if you qualify for
a subsidy, and enroll in the
appropriate plan for you and
your family. You can also get
help by calling the 24/7
hotline at
800-318-2596 .
More
than 5 million Americans and
nearly 10,000 Delawareans
have enrolled in health care
coverage through the Health
Insurance Marketplace and the
state's expanded Medicaid
program, and more than 75
percent of Delawareans
enrolled in private insurance
plans have qualified for
federal assistance to help
pay for the cost.
I
met two of these Delawareans
this past week in
Seaford . Jerry Taylor has
been uninsured for the past
three years and starting
April 1 hell be
covered for $58 per month.
Christine Brooks is a breast
cancer survivor and
shes been uninsured
for five years, but now she
has coverage too.
Both
Jerry and Christine used the
help of a marketplace guide
to enroll and you can too at
one of the many enrollment
events near you, where
locally trained and certified
marketplace experts will be
available to answer any
questions you may have.
These guides can walk you
through the enrollment
process and help you select
an affordable plan that fits
all of your health
needs. A full schedule
can be found on the
ChooseHealthDE.com website at
http://www.choosehealthde.com/Health-Insurance/Calendar#recurring-events .
As
always, I welcome hearing
from you on this topic, or
any other. Please

issues are important to you
