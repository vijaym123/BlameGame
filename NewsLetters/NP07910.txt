Dear Friend,
As I travel throughout Ohios 16
th
District, I continue to hear
the same question: where are the jobs?
Though I was encouraged to see the
unemployment rate tick down this past
month, I remain concerned about our
economic recovery.
A drop in the unemployment rate does not
necessarily tell an accurate account of the
true economic reality for hardworking
Ohioans and Americans across the country.
Last week, the Washington Post reported
that nearly all of the jobs added in June
were part-time positions. Though it is good
news that more jobs were added than
expected, we have essentially shifted
people off of the unemployment rolls and
into underemployment, meaning that millions
are still struggling to make ends meet.
Last months job report also revealed
that the unemployment rate for 18 to 29
year olds, including those who have given
up looking for work, was 15.2 percent.
Additionally, we continue to see the
lowest labor force participation rate in
more than 35 years as more and more people
drop out of the labor force or give up
their search all together. Earlier this
week, the Cleveland Plain Dealer reported
that Ohio has yet to recover 120,000 jobs
that were lost since the recession,
indicating that there is still much work
ahead of us.
Burdensome regulations handed down from
Washington, economic uncertainty, and
higher taxes are making it harder for our
businesses to expand and hire. Furthermore,
the Presidents health care law is
forcing many businesses to reduce employee
hours in order to comply with the
laws mandates, turning full-time
work into part-time work at a time when
working families can least afford
it.
We can and should be doing more to make
it easier for our small businesses to
create the jobs that we need. That is why
we in the House of Representatives have
passed dozens of jobs bills that would lead
to economic growth and expanded opportunity
for Americans everywhere. For example, one
of those bills, the Red Tape Reduction and
Small Business Job Creation Act, reins in
federal overreach allowing our job creators
to create new opportunities. Additionally,
this past month the House passed
theDomestic Prosperity and Global
Freedom Act. This legislation expedites
exports of liquefied natural gas to our
allies and trading partners, and will
create more than 30,000 jobs right here in
Ohio by 2035.
However, sadly, those bills remain
stalled in the Senate. Though the White
House and the Senate refuse to act to open
the door for much-needed growth, I will
continue to put forth bipartisan,
commonsense solutions that will lead to the
job creation that we need in Ohios
16
th
District and across America.
I am also committed to doing all that I can
at home to help those who tell me they are
struggling to find work.
That is why our office will host a
Northeast Ohio Job Fair on Friday, July 18,
2014 at Brunswick High School from 11:00
a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Over 25 employers from
Northeast Ohio will participate, including
UPS, Vitamix, GOJO Industries, and Lumitex.
Fortunately for Ohios 16
th
District, there are several
businesses that are looking to hire and
improve our local economy. If you are an
employer and would like to participate,
please call my Wadsworth office at (330)
334-0040. There is no admission fee and all
