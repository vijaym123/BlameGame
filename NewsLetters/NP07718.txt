Fleming Reintroduces H.Res 615
Congress must still live with the laws it creates. Five years ago we stood together in the midst of the health care debate to send that message to Washington. I drafted House Resolution 615 because some members of Congress were trying to exempt themselves from the requirements of the health care law they were writing. I've now reintroduced HRes 615 because some members still want out from the Obamacare burdens they imposed on you.
Today, I am still fighting on this issue and I want to hear back from you on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
JOHN FLEMING, M.D.
Member of Congress
