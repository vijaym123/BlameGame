Congressman Lamborn
Calls for New Joint DOD-VA Clinic in Northern El Paso
County
5/13/14
As part of last week's mark-up amendment session for
the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act, the following amendment
from Congressman Doug Lamborn was adopted into the full 2015 National
Defense Authorization Act.
"As our military and veterans populations continue to grow, military
medical care will become an even greater priority for our region. This
amendment directs the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Veterans
Affairs to investigate the possibility of a new Joint DOD-VA Clinic in
Northern El Paso County. I look forward to the feedback from their
study."

AMENDMENT
TEXT
"The committee is aware
that the Defense Health Agency has identified Colorado Springs, Colorado
as the fastest growing Enhanced Multi-Service Market (EMSM) for
healthcare in the country.
As such, demand for healthcare may exceed
the current capacity of Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities in the region.
Joint
DOD-VA-civilian partnerships that can serve both active duty service members,
their families, and veterans have the potential to be an effective,
cost-saving approach to enhancing access to and the quality of healthcare
services provided by the DoD, VA, and the private sector.
Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense, in consultation
with, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to analyze the potential
benefits of a partnership in the Colorado Springs area in order to better
address the growing need for healthcare services.
This analysis
should consider the challenges that arise from the VA and DoD having
different planning and budget timelines, authorizations and approval
processes, personnel staffing authorities and requirements, pharmaceutical
policies, clinical scheduling policies and procedures, management
structure and performance evaluations, and provide solutions to address
these challenge to best leverage the capabilities of the two
Departments as well as the civilian community.
The analysis should
consider both the benefits and challenges seen in previous efforts to
consolidate DOD and VA facilities, as well as current joint DoD-VA healthcare
projects.
The Secretary of Defense should report the results of
the analysis to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees no
later than 120 days after date of enactment of this
act."
