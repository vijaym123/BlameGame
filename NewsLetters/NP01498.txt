Dear Friend,
7 out of 10 students graduate with student loan debt - a massive weight
on the lives of millions of young Americans. The House of
Representatives has introduced the Bank on Students Emergency Loan
Refinancing Act, which would help more than 1.5 million borrowers in
New York refinance their student loans at todays lower interest rates.
I strongly believe that giving students the option to refinance their
loans would create jobs and grow our economy by allowing millions of
Americans to start their own business, buy a home, or save for
retirement. We must act now because Hudson Valley students and families
cannot afford the crushing burden of student loan debt
plain and
simple.
What do you think? Please take a minute to answer the survey below.
Do you think Congress should pass legislation allowing borrowers to
refinance their education loans at lower rates?
Yes
No
