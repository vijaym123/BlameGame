Dear Friend,
Thank you for subscribing to my email updates. I appreciate your
continued interest and value this opportunity to share with you what
I'm doing in Washington and the 15th District. For more ways to stay in
touch, click on the social networking sites below.
Handing Over Internet Domain Name Oversight Is A Bad Idea Right Now
I joined fellow Representatives Todd Rokita (R, Indiana-4) and Marsha
Blackburn (R, Tennessee-7) in introducing H.R. 4342
, the Domain Openness
Through Continued Oversight Matters (DOTCOM) Act, on Thursday. The
DOTCOM Act is in response the recent Department of Commerce
announcement that the U.S. would relinquish its remaining oversight of
the Internet's domain name system to an ill-defined "global Internet
community."
In the month of March alone we've seen Russia block opposition
websites, Turkey ban Twitter, China place new restrictions on online
video, and a top Malaysian politician pledge to censor the Internet if
he's given the chance. This isn't a theoretical debate. There are real
authoritarian governments in the world today who have no tolerance for
the free flow of information and ideas. What possible benefit could
come from giving the Vladimir Putins of the world a new venue to push
their anti-freedom agendas?
While I've been told the administration won't move to a
"multistakeholder model" that could compromise the openness of the
Internet today, they need to explain to Congress and the American
people how they'll guarantee the new "multistakeholder regime" won't be
influenced tomorrow by foreign governments or - as advocated by Russia
and China - the United Nations' International Telecommunications Union.
We have to consider the long-term implications of relinquishing our
oversight role because once it's gone, it's gone for good.
The DOTCOM Act would prohibit the Department of Commerce's National
Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA) from turning over
its domain name system oversight responsibilities pending a Government
Accountability Office (GAO) report to Congress.
Most Taxpayers Can Take Advantage Of IRS Free File Program
Less than three weeks remain until the April 15 tax deadline. If you
have not already filed, you may want to consider the Internal Revenue
Service's Free File program. The service - available through a
partnership between the IRS and the tax software industry - provides
free access to leading tax preparation software, offering step-by-step
help to prepare and e-file federal tax returns online.
Through Free File, all taxpayers who made $58,000 or less in 2013 can
visit www.IRS.gov/freefile to prepare and e-file their federal tax
returns. About 100 million Americans - or 70 percent of taxpayers - are
eligible. In addition, Free File offers a basic e-filing service for
everyone, regardless of income. Taxpayers can also use Free File to
e-file an extension.
Beware Of Scams: With tax season upon us, the IRS reminds Americans to
beware of criminals seeking your personal information. A new "phishing"
scam in which taxpayers receive emails purporting to be from the IRS's
Taxpayer Advocate Service (and bearing its logo) has been reported. The
email contains a bogus case number and begins, "Your reported 2013
income is flagged for review due to a document processing error."
The email contains links where the recipient is asked to provide
personal information. If you get such an email, do NOT click on the
links. You can forward the email to the IRS's designated address for
such scams: phishing@irs.gov.
Students Interested In Service Academies Invited To 'All Academy Night'
Each year, I have the honor of nominating or welcoming students to each
of our five federal service academies: the United States Air Force
Academy, United States Merchant Marine Academy, United States Military
Academy, United States Naval Academy, and United States Coast Guard
Academy.
In order to give students an opportunity to learn more about
these academies and my nomination process, I will be co-hosting two
"All Academy Night" programs with Congressman Rodney Davis (R,
Illinois-13).
The events will be held April 14 at the Armory, 600 East University
Avenue, Urbana; and April 28 at The Commons on the campus of Lewis and
Clark Community College, 5800 Godfrey Road, Godfrey. The programs will
begin at 7 p.m. each night; however, the doors will open and registered
participants will have access to the Congressmen's staff and academy
representatives at 6:30 p.m.
High school and junior high students, parents, school administrators,
and guidance counselors are all welcome to hear from representatives of
each of the academies and to discuss the nomination process with
Congressional staff.
Please RSVP to Jennifer White of Congressman Davis' office by email at
Jen.White@mail.house.gov. For more information on the academies or my
nomination process, contact Dora Rohan at (618) 288-7190.

Red Cross Providing Free Emergency Apps: As part of National Flood
Safety Awareness Week earlier this month, the American Red Cross
released a new Flood app
. The free app can provide
smartphone users with flood and flash flood watches and warnings,
including audible alerts that can wake people when they are asleep. It
also provides tips on how to prepare for flooding. The new app joins
others available from the Red Cross for tornadoes, hurricanes,
earthquakes, wildfires, plus first aid, and is available for download
