Dear Friend,
I was honored this week to bring together a panel of experts on human
trafficking as I hosted a summit aimed at increasing awareness of this
horrific crime and providing tools for action to address this form of
human slavery.
Congresswoman Hartzler hosting the Summit on Human Trafficking in
Columbia, MO.
Those who came to the well-attended Summit on Human Trafficking, held
at Missouri United Methodist Church in Columbia, heard that while it is
easy to think of human trafficking as something that takes place only
in big cities or in other countries, this appalling crime is taking
place right in our own backyard. In fact, the Department of Justice's
Western District of Missouri alone is currently prosecuting 15 cases
involving human trafficking.
In May, my colleagues and I passed a series of bills aimed at
preventing or eliminating the spread of trafficking and protecting the
victims of this crime against humanity. Many of these victims are
pre-teens and young teenagers, with 80 percent of the victims being
female. My hope is that the information shared at this summit will help
stop this horrific crime.
The US Department of State Trafficking in Persons Report 2007 revealed
600,000-800,000 men, women, and children are trafficked across
international borders each year. Up to 50 percent are minors. In
addition, the most recent U.S. government estimates are that as many as
17,500 people are believed to be trafficked into the United States each
year, and some observers have estimated that as many as 100,000
American children are vulnerable to trafficking within the United
States during the course of a year.
Each of the Summit participants, including two women who survived this
heinous crime, brought unique perspectives and insights along with
valuable suggestions for combating it, sharing the fact that many
people are sold into prostitution at an early age and are enslaved
until they are no longer wanted. This crime must be stopped.
Participants in the summit included: Dr. Deborah Hume, from the Central
Missouri Stop Human Trafficking Coalition; Wende Baker, a Victim
Specialist with the FBI; Christine McDonald, a human trafficking
survivor; Adam Kavanaugh, with the St. Louis County Police Department's
Special Investigations Unit; Gail Reynoso, a Program Development
Specialist with the Missouri Coalition against Domestic and Sexual
Violence; Misty Losinger, a human trafficking survivor; and Steve
Dunlap, the founder of On Time Ministry. I thank all those who took
part and are working so hard to right this wrong.
While in Columbia, I also had an opportunity to lend a hand at the Food
Bank for Central and Northeast Missouri, bagging potatoes for hungry
families. The Food Bank acquires and distributes millions of pounds of
donated food each year.

The food goes to soup kitchens, emergency food pantries, shelters for
the abused and homeless, programs for low-income children and senior
citizens, and rehabilitation centers. It was a pleasure to help take
part, in some small way, in the effort to feed our needy families.
In Washington, this week, the House approved the FY 2015 Defense
Appropriations Bill. This bipartisan effort gives our men and women in
uniform the tools and resources they need to protect our nation from
current and emerging threats. It supports key readiness programs to
prepare our troops for combat and peacetime missions by providing for
operations and addressing readiness shortfalls; it ensures a
well-equipped, well-prepared force by providing for essential upgrades
and procurement of platforms; and it prepares for future security
threats by providing for research and development. The bottom line,
however, is that we are facing a scarcity of funds due to
sequestration, and drastic cuts to our military have been made.
I am happy that there are a number of provisions in this bill that
closely mirror the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that we
passed earlier this year. Those provisions, such as the funding for
additional Growler aircraft, keeping the Apache helicopter with the
National Guard, and rejecting proposals for cutting benefits and
another round of Base Realignment and Closure are very beneficial for
Missourians and Americans alike. I am particularly pleased that funding
has been provided to save the A-10. There is no better aircraft to
fulfill the military's critical close air support mission.
I also participated in two important hearings in Armed Services
Committee. The first was a classified briefing learning more about the
deal our government agreed to which resulted in the release of Sgt.
Bowe Bergdahl. While I am glad our soldier has been released, I
question the wisdom of exchanging five Taliban leaders for him. In
addition, I believe our Administration violated the law by not
notifying Members of Congress about the swap. Last year's National
Defense Authorization Act requires the Administration to notify
Congress before releasing terrorists. We now know 80-90 people within
the Administration knew but not one representative of the people was
made aware of this deal. This is wrong. The President should respect
the laws and be willing to consult elected officials before making such
a consequential decision.
In addition, we held a hearing on the ongoing discussions with Iran
regarding their desired proliferation of nuclear weapons. Iran must
stop its march to nuclear capability. There is no reason for them to
enrich uranium or develop a nuclear weapons program. With Iranian
leadership threatening to destroy both Israel and the United States
with a nuclear bomb, we must stand firm in our negotiations and insist
they dismantle their centrifuges and pursue peaceful relations with
other nations. The July 20 deadline to secure a resolution is fast
approaching. I will continue to push the Administration to hold firm
and do everything in our power to prevent further nuclear proliferation
of the world's leading supporter of terrorists.
Finally, I had the pleasure of meeting with the FFA group from my
hometown of Archie, MO. As a member of the Agriculture Committee, I
know how important it is for organizations like the FFA to bring young
leaders to Washington D.C. to experience the agriculture policy process
first hand and visit their Capitol. Additionally, I met with a group of
students from the Fourth District who won an essay contest put on by
the Missouri Electric Cooperatives. It was a true pleasure to meet with
such a bright group of young leaders. I wish them all the best in their
future endeavors.

Those
who
came
to
the
well-attended
Summit

heard
that
while
it

something
that
takes

only

this

is
taking

right
in
our
own

In
fact,
the
Department
of
Justice&#8217;s
Western

of
Missouri
alone
is
currently
prosecuting
15
cases
involving
human

Many

My
hope
is
that
the

at

will
help
stop
this
horrific
crime.
The
US
Department
of
State

2007
revealed
600,000-800,000
men,
women,
and
children
are
trafficked
across
international
borders
each
year.
Up
to
50
percent
are
minors.
In
addition,
the
most
recent
U.S.
government
estimates
are
that
as
many
as
17,500
people
are
believed
to
be
trafficked
into
the
United
States
each
year,
and
some
observers
have
estimated
that
as
many
as
100,000
American
children
are
vulnerable
to
trafficking
within
the
United
States
during
the
course
of
a
year.
Each
of
the
Summit
participants,
including
two
women
who
survived
this

brought

It
was
a

to
help

in
some
small

in
the
effort
to
feed
our
needy
families.
In
Washington,
this

the

the
FY
2015
Defense

Bill.
This
bipartisan

gives
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
the
tools
and
resources
they
need
to
protect
our
nation
from
current
and
emerging
threats.
It
supports
key
readiness
programs
to
prepare
our
troops
for
combat
and

missions
by
providing

addressing
readiness
shortfalls;
it

providing
for

and

of

and
it
prepares
for
future
security
threats
by
providing

The
bottom
line,
however,
is
that
we
are
facing
a
scarcity
of
funds
due
to
sequestration,
and
drastic
cuts
to
our
military
have
been
made.
I
am
happy
that
there
are
a
number
of
provisions
in
this
bill
that
closely
mirror
the
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
(NDAA)
that
we
passed
earlier
this
year. Those
provisions,
such
as
the
funding
for
additional
Growler
aircraft,
keeping
the
Apache
helicopter
with
the
National
Guard,
and
rejecting
proposals
for
cutting
benefits
and
another
round
of
Base
Realignment
and
Closure
are
very
beneficial
for
Missourians
and
Americans
alike. I
am
particularly
pleased
that
funding
has
been
provided
to
save
the
A-10.
There
is
no
better
aircraft
to
fulfill
the
military&#8217;s
critical
close
air
support
mission.
I
also
participated
in
two
important
hearings
in
Armed
Services
Committee. The
first
was
a
classified
briefing
learning
more
about
the
deal
our
government
agreed
to
which
resulted
in
the
release
of
Sgt.
Bowe
Bergdahl. While
I
am
glad
our
soldier
has
been
released,
I
question
the
wisdom
of
exchanging
five
Taliban
leaders
for
him. In
addition,
I
believe
our
Administration
violated
the
law
by
not
notifying
Members
of
Congress
about
the
swap. Last
year&#8217;s
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
requires
the
Administration
to
notify
Congress
before
releasing
terrorists. We
now
know
80-90
people
within
the
Administration
knew
but
not
one
representative
of
the
people
was
made
aware
of
this
deal. This
is
wrong. The
President
should
respect
the
laws
and
be
willing
to
consult
elected
officials
before
making
such
a
consequential
decision.
In
addition,
we
held
a
hearing
on
the
ongoing
discussions
with
Iran
regarding
their
desired
proliferation
of
nuclear
weapons. Iran
must
stop
its
march
to
nuclear
capability. There
is
no
reason
for
them
to
enrich
uranium
or
develop
a
nuclear
weapons
program. With
Iranian
leadership
threatening
to
destroy
both
Israel
and
the
United
States
with
a
nuclear
bomb,
we
must
stand
firm
in
our
negotiations
and
insist
they
dismantle
their
centrifuges
and
pursue
peaceful
relations
with
other
nations. The
July
20
deadline
to
secure
a
resolution
is
fast
approaching. I
will
continue
to
push
the
Administration
to
hold
firm
and
do
everything
in
our
power
to
prevent
further
nuclear
proliferation
of
the
world&#8217;s
leading
supporter
of
terrorists.
Finally,
I
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
with
the
FFA
group
from
my
hometown
of
Archie,
MO.
As
a
member
of
the
Agriculture
Committee,
I
know
how
important
it
is
for
organizations
like
the
FFA
to
bring
young
leaders
to
Washington
D.C.
to
experience
the agriculture
policy
process
first

and
visit
their
Capitol. Additionally,
I
met
with
a
group
of
students
from
the
Fourth
District
who
won
an
essay

put
on
by
the
Missouri

was
a
true
pleasure
to
meet
with
such
a
bright

wish
them
all
the
best
in
their
future
endeavors.
