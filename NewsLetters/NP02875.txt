Dear friends,
I will host my first
tele-townhall meeting of 2015 later this month and want to encourage
Idahoans to participate.
During the hour-long call, I will take
questions from Idahoans on a variety of topics currently being debated
in Congress, including new U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
efforts to increase federal control over state waters, federal education
mandates, the economy and the Presidents strategy to defeat ISIS.
The teleforum will take place on
Wednesday, February 25,
2015 at 7:00 PM Mountain Time/6:00 PM Pacific
Time.
To sign up for the teleforum, please visit my official
website,
http://www.crapo.senate.gov , and click the
tele-townhall icon on the right side of the homepage under the Action
Center.
This link will direct users to the tele-townhall section of
my website, where a sign up box is located in the middle of the
page.
You may also click
here
to be
taken directly to the tele-townhall page.
The deadline to
register to ensure participation is Wednesday, February 25, 2015, 1:00 PM
Mountain Time/ 12:00 PM Pacific Time.
All that is needed to
participate is a telephone.
Joining the call is voluntary, and
listeners are given an opportunity to ask me about topics regarding
federal policies and legislation.
Those who have signed up in advance
will receive an automated phone call just before the tele-townhall
begins and will receive instructions on how to
participate.
Looking for more information?
Please
visit the
Issues and
Legislation
section of my website for information that addresses many issues
important to all of us.
As always, I highly
value the opinions and concerns of my fellow Idahoans.
With that in mind,
we continue to work to improve my website.
Please do not
reply to this e-newsletter.
We are set up to respond to your
comments, suggestions or concerns at my official website, www.crapo.senate.gov.
Also, please let me know if there are other issues that you would
like me to address.
All the best,
