Remember Those
Who Sacrificed on Memorial Day
This Memorial Day, we celebrate the courage of those men
and women who have fought for the United States of America. From
Lexington to Pearl Harbor, and from Normandy to Afghanistan, Americans have
always stood for freedom and liberty.
Today, we reflect on those
who have paid the ultimate sacrifice to protect the American way of
life, and defend the U.S. Constitution.
Throughout our proud
history, men and women from every walk of life have rallied to the call of
freedom, and we are forever in their debt.
Missouri and the Sixth District is home to many
heroes.
I recently had the privilege of honoring such great men
with long overdue medals for their service in our military.
Mr.
Harley Edwards
who served in the Navy during World War II
of
Independence, Mr. Charles Bradbury of Blue Springs for his valor in Vietnam,
and Army veteran Mr. Donald Lloyd of Platte City.
Recently, the 1438th Engineer Company of the
Missouri National Guard returned home to Macon after a year-long deployment
to southern Afghanistan.
And last week, the House of Representatives finally approved a long
overdue measure to designate the Liberty Memorial at America's National
World War I Museum in Kansas City as the
National World War
I Museum &amp; Memorial .
Frank Buckles, the last surviving American veteran from World War I,
died in February of 2011.
Mr. Buckles was from Bethany,
Missouri.
I am so grateful for all of
Missouris heroes, past and present.
The Missouri way of life is
worth fighting for, and many venture into harms way knowing they may
not return.
With great reverence and admiration, we must renew
our resolve that their sacrifices will never, ever, be
forgotten.
Sincerely,
Sam
Graves
