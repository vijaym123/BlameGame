David, there was a lot of discussion about whether we should send you this email. After much debate, we decided to let you know the hard truth. Here it is:
There&rsquo;s no good news in this email.
The Koch Brothers are crushing Democrats with their unlimited, secret money. Now some are predicting Boehner will win the largest Republican majority in decades.
We&rsquo;ll be blunt: President Obama&rsquo;s final 2 years are at stake. And right now&hellip;it&rsquo;s not looking good.
If we&rsquo;re going to avoid disaster, we can&rsquo;t afford to fail ONCE between now and Election Day.
David -- we need your help before tonight's do-or-die mid-month fundraising deadline.
David Johnson Suggested Support: $5.OO
We need 13,658 more donations TODAY if we want any shot at giving President Obama a Democratic House for his final two years. We're pleading, David. Can you step up for the President right now?
