Dear Fellow New Mexican,
Earlier this week I toured the New Mexico-Arizona border region with my colleague U.S. Senator Jeff Flake, who also serves on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee,
to discuss forest restoration, conservation, and protecting our communities from wildfire.
Our day-long tour focused on our bipartisan efforts to address catastrophic wildfire prevention and recovery needs in our neighboring states and across the country, and included visits to forest product industry sites, the Wallow Fire burn scar, a home equipped to reduce the risk of fire, and the Catwalk National Recreation Area in the Gila National Forest.
I hope you&rsquo;ll take a moment to experience the places we went through an
interactive map on my website .
New Mexicans know first-hand the impacts catastrophic wildfires have on our communities and lands. And we share a deep appreciation for our firefighters and other first responders who put their lives on the line everyday to keep us safe. But fighting wildfires cannot come at the expense of programs that can prevent large, costly fires. We don't have to choose between fighting fires and preventing them -- we must do both, and I will continue to work to make that possible.
It is an honor to serve you in the United States Senate.
Be well and
keep in touch .
Sincerely,
MARTIN HEINRICH
United States Senator
