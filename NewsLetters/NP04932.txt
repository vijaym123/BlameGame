President Obama emailed you already. Now I&rsquo;m emailing you, too. When the President AND the Vice President email you in a single week, it&rsquo;s got to be important.
Friend -- President Obama emailed you already.
Now I&rsquo;m emailing you, too.
When the President AND the Vice President email you in a single week, it&rsquo;s got to be important. So please take 30 seconds and give this a close look:
We&rsquo;ve got just 48 hours to fully fund the DSCC&rsquo;s Final Weekend Get Out The Vote Push and we&rsquo;re still $1,825,242 short.
If we don&#39;t close that gap, we won&rsquo;t be able to contact tens of thousands of voters -- voters who will decide the outcome of the entire Senate.
The DSCC needs your help -- NOW -- to fill that budget hole.
Otherwise, their GOTV surge is dead in the water, and our path to keeping the Senate gets a whole lot steeper.
I&rsquo;ll ask bluntly: Please pitch in to the DSCC&rsquo;s Final Weekend GOTV Push before the final deadline in 48 hours. We&rsquo;ll triple-match your gift.
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
Friend, there are a dozen states still up for grabs. In an election like this, we can&rsquo;t afford any missed opportunities. Not if we&rsquo;re going to win and stop a Republican takeover.
The side that works the hardest in the next six days is the one that will win. Let&rsquo;s make sure it&rsquo;s ours.
Will you pitch in to support the DSCC&rsquo;s Final Weekend GOTV Push? Your gift will be triple-matched.
Thank you,
Joe Biden
Every dollar you give today will go to protect our Democratic Senate majority.
