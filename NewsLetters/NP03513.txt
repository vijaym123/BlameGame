It&rsquo;s Swearing-In Day! Sign your name to stand with Cheri as she takes the oath of office &gt;&gt;
It&rsquo;s here!
The day we&rsquo;ve been working so hard towards is finally here! Today, Cheri will take the oath of office and begin her second term to represent the people of Illinois&rsquo; 17th district.
For the next two years, Cheri will fight for Illinois&rsquo; middle class, for our seniors and for our veterans. Cheri will fight for you, David.
Let&rsquo;s show Cheri that we&rsquo;re standing with her! Sign your name to stand with Cheri as she takes the oath of office &gt;&gt;
Cheri is committed to fighting for the people of Illinois and to strengthening Illinois&rsquo; middle class. But make no mistake, this isn&rsquo;t an easy task. She needs each and every person reading this email to stand with her as she begins her next term in Congress. So, David, will you sign your name to stand with Cheri as she begins her second term in Congress? http://action.cheribustos.com/Stand-With-Cheri
Thanks! Let&rsquo;s keep moving Illinois forward!!!
