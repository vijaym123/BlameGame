Dear Friend,
During a town hall last week, I heard from folks all across the Hudson Valley about our crumbling infrastructure and transportation challenges.
Fact: America's infrastructure just received a D+ rating, including a D for transit and roads and a C+ for our rail system.
I know that my neighbors in the Hudson Valley know firsthand the challenges faced by our crumbling infrastructure and transportation systems, so I want to hear all of your concerns. You can take this
survey
on the most important challenges facing our community. Please
take the survey.
Do you think we should invest in 21st Century infrastructure and transportation systems in the Hudson Valley?
Yes
No
I Don't Know

Sincerely,
Sean Patrick Maloney
