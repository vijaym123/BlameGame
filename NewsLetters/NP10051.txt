Dear Friend,
As we all know, education is a vital component to the success of our
youth and our nation.
Each year, millions of students from across the
country recognize that obtaining a college degree will open the door to
countless opportunities for their futures.
Access to a high quality
education is the surest path to success, key to providing a better life
for themselves and their families, and necessary to participate in our
increasingly global economy.
Unfortunately, the cost of higher education has skyrocketed in the last
few years.
In Texas, tuition and fees at public institutions have
increased over 90% in the past decade.
More and more, students are
graduating with heavy debt burdens.
It is imperative that we make
college more affordable for all Americans.
That means cutting the
costs of student loans and making more grants and scholarships
available to those who need them.
While there is no doubt that we must make some hard decisions about how
to address our nation's finances, we cannot afford to deteriorate our
children's education in the process. As a nation, we need to work
together to guarantee our students have the world-class education they
deserve and ensure that students and their families are not being
saddled with debt.
San Antonio Celebrates College Week
San Antonio celebrated "College Week" this past week to encourage our
students to prepare for college. The week was full of events to cheer
on our city's students as they commit to pursue higher education and
attend college. We want to have a college-bound culture in our city so
that our economy can continue to thrive.
I joined with First Lady Michelle Obama, San Antonio leaders,
educators, and students at the College Signing Ceremony at the
University of Texas at San Antonio.
College bound students joined
together to sign their commitments to attend colleges and meet with
other area students who will be joining them at their future schools.
My staff in San Antonio and D.C. joined in the festivities by sporting
their college t-shirts to cheer on San Antonio students.
Funding for veterans and military projects in San Antonio
Earlier this week, I helped pass the Military Construction and Veterans
Affairs Appropriations Act, which provides funding for the programs and
infrastructure that our military and their families rely on in the U.S.
and abroad.
Importantly for the 1.7 million veterans living in Texas,
this bill funds veterans' programs, medical services, benefit claims
and addresses Veteran Affairs backlog issues.
Included in the bill was $44.1 million for two military projects in San
Antonio:
*	$38.3 million to replace the aging Joint Base San Antonio
(JBSA) Reid Trainee Clinic.
*	The Clinic was originally built in 1967 and it no
longer has the capacity for its current mission. The Clinic trains
86,000 military personnel annually.
*	$5.8 million for the construction of a fire station at the San
Antonio Military Medical Center
*	Due to the size of JBSA, the current situation does not
allow for a consistent and timely emergency response by the fire units
stationed in the main base of Fort Sam Houston that provide the
firefighting and emergency response to the SAMMC complex.
I strongly believe that we must make a sincere commitment to making
college more accessible and affordable for all Americans.
I remain
committed to removing barriers that keep millions of young Americans
from attaining a higher education.
We cannot afford to play politics
with our students' futures.
Sincerely,
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
As
we
all
know,
education
is
a
vital
component
to
the
success
of
our
youth
and
our
nation.
Each
year,
millions
of
students
from
across
the
country
recognize
that
obtaining
a
college
degree
will
open
the
door
to
countless
opportunities
for
their
futures.
Access
to
a
high
quality
education
is
the
surest
path
to
success,
key
to
providing
a
better
life
for
themselves
and
their
families,
and
necessary
to
participate
in
our
increasingly
global
economy.
Unfortunately,
the
cost
of
higher
education
has
skyrocketed
in
the
last
few
years.
In
Texas,
tuition
and
fees
at
public
institutions
have
increased
over
90%
in
the
past
decade.
More
and
more,
students
are
graduating
with
heavy
debt
burdens.
It
is
imperative
that
we
make
college
more
affordable
for
all
Americans.
That
means
cutting
the
costs
of
student
loans
and
making
more
grants
and
scholarships
available
to
those
who
need
them.
While
there
is
no
doubt
that
we
must
make
some
hard
decisions
about
how
to
address
our
nation&#8217;s
finances,
we
cannot
afford
to
deteriorate
our
children&#8217;s
education
in
the
process. As
a
nation,
we
need
to
work
together
to
guarantee
our
students
have
the
world-class
education
they
deserve
a nd
ensure
that
students
and
their
families
are
not
being
saddled
with
debt.
San
Antonio
Celebrates
College
Week
San
Antonio
celebrated
&#8220;College
Week&#8221;
this
past
week
to
encourage
our
students
to
prepare
for
college.
The
week
was
full
of
events
to
cheer
on
our
city&#8217;s
students
as
they
commit
to
pursue
higher
education
and
attend
college.
We
want
to
have
a
college-bound
culture
in
our
city
so
that
our
economy
can
continue
to
thrive.
I
joined
with
First
Lady
Michelle
Obama,
San
Antonio
leaders,
educators,
and
students
at
the
College
Signing
Ceremony
at
the
University
of
Texas
at
San
Antonio.
College
bound
students
joined
together
to
sign
their
commitments
to
attend
colleges
and
meet
with
other
area
students
who
will
be
joining
them
at
their
future
schools.
My
staff
in
San
Antonio
and
D.C.
joined
in
the
festivities
by
sporting
their
college
t-shirts
to
cheer
on
San
Antonio
students.
Funding
for
veterans
and
military
projects
in
San
Antonio
Earlier
this
week,
I
helped
pass
the
Military
Construction
and
Veterans
Affairs
Appropriations
Act ,
which
provides
funding
for
the
programs
and
infrastructure
that
our
military
and
their
families
rely
on
in
the
U.S.
and
abroad.
Importantly
for
the
1.7
million
veterans
living
in
Texas,
this
bill
funds
veterans&#8217;
programs,
medical
services,
benefit
claims
and
addresses
Veteran
Affairs
backlog
issues.
Included
in
the
bill
was
$44.1
million
for
two
military
projects
in
San
Antonio:
$38.3
million
to
replace
the
aging
Joint
Base
San
Antonio
(JBSA)
Reid
Trainee
Clinic.
The
Clinic
was
originally
built
in
1967
and
it
no
longer
has
the
capacity
for
its
current
mission.
The
Clinic
trains
86,000
military
personnel
annually. $5.8
million
for
the
construction
of
a
fire
station
at
the
San
Antonio
Military
Medical
Center
Due
to
the
size
of
JBSA,
the
current
situation
does
not
allow
for
a
consistent
and
timely
emergency
response
by
the
fire
units
stationed
in
the
main
base
of
Fort
Sam
Houston
that
provide
the
firefighting
and
emergency
response
to
the
SAMMC
complex.
I
strongly
believe
that
we
must
make
a
sincere
commitment
to
making
college
more
accessible
and
affordable
for
all
Americans.
I
remain
committed
to
removing
barriers
that
keep
millions
of
young
Americans
from
attaining
a
higher
education.
We
cannot
afford
to
play
politics
with
our
students&#8217;
futures.
Sincerely,
Member
of
Congress
