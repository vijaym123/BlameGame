I&rsquo;ve seen some crazy stuff during my time in office, but this really takes the cake. The new Republican Congress is an utter disaster.
David -- I wouldn&rsquo;t be emailing you if you weren&rsquo;t a top Democrat.
But my staff tells me you haven&rsquo;t renewed your DSCC membership for 2015 yet:
DSCC Membership Status:
pending
2015 Membership Rate:
$5
(renew membership now)
We&rsquo;ve never needed you more. The new Republican Congress is an utter disaster. They&rsquo;re about to
shut down
the critical Homeland Security department just because they have a beef with President Obama&rsquo;s agenda. I&rsquo;ve seen some crazy stuff during my time in office, but this really takes the cake.
And here&rsquo;s what keeps me up at night: if we don&rsquo;t stop them Republicans could take control of both the White House
and
all of Congress in 2016.
They&rsquo;re already starting to rake in millions. If Democrats fall behind in early donations, the GOP could gain an insurmountable lead.
Time is critical -- we have only 72 hours to hit our goal of 10,000 membership renewals
to compete with the GOP.
David, will you renew your membership by the end-of-month FEC deadline in 72 hours? A group of donors will
match
your membership gift, so it will have
twice
the impact!
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
Look, we need to be able to compete with the well-funded GOP. But we don&rsquo;t have the Koch brothers -- we have you.
Please renew your membership now so we can get out there and fight against the Republicans&#39; dangerous politics. Remember, the FEC deadline is in 72 hours.
I appreciate everything you do,
Senator Jon Tester
DSCC Chair
