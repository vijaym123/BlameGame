BREAKING: REPUBLICANS BLOCK EQUAL PAY LEGISLATION ON EQUAL PAY DAY
Even though it&rsquo;s 2015, Republicans just blocked the Paycheck Fairness Act.
Outrageous!
Add your name to tell Republicans to pass equal pay legislation TODAY &gt;&gt; NAME:
David Johnson Petition Signature:
SIGN ON &gt;&gt;
Sign Your Name &gt;&gt;
It&rsquo;s absolutely outrageous:
It&rsquo;s 2015, and women STILL make, on average, 22% less than men for the exact same work. That&rsquo;s not only awful, it&rsquo;s embarrassing.
It&rsquo;s time for America to do better.
That&rsquo;s why President Obama called on Congress to act:
&ldquo;Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. Really. It&rsquo;s 2015. It&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;
But seconds ago, the Republicans blocked the Paycheck Fairness Act -- for the 4th time. That&rsquo;s infuriating, and it&rsquo;s time to demand change. Stand with President Obama: Tell Republicans in Congress to STOP blocking equal pay legislation!
We need 50,000 people to stand with President Obama by midnight. It&rsquo;s 2015.
It&rsquo;s time to END Equal Pay Day by SECURING equal pay for women in the workplace!
It&rsquo;s simple: Once women receive equal pay for equal work, Equal Pay Day will be a thing of the past. But we need strong Democrats like you to demand change and make it happen. Add your name to demand Republicans pass the Paycheck Fairness Act TODAY &gt;&gt;
Let&rsquo;s equalize the wage gap for good.
