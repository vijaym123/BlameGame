Standing up for Consumer Protection
It's no secret that a lot of big financial institutions built their
business models last decade on gambling in the Wall Street casino and
exploiting their customers. The Dodd Frank Act was designed to put an
end to all that and put banks back in the business of working for Main
Street, not the other way around.
But since the law passed there's
been a constant effort to chip away at its reforms and protections, and
those efforts are kicking into overdrive following the 2014 elections.
Jeff was recently named the top Democrat on the Financial Institutions
and Consumer Protection Subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee -
putting him in a powerful position
to fight against Wall
Street's efforts to return to the dangerous practices that torched the
economy and stripped wealth from so many working families.
>From this new position, Jeff will be at the center of battles to stand
up for working families, push back on the big banks, and protect
essential consumer reforms. And he'll be leading the charge to protect
the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - which has already returned
more than $4.6 billion to consumers in its first three-and-a-half years
- keeping more money in the pockets of middle class families.
Sounding the Alarm on Dangerous E-Cigarette Findings
Jeff has been leading the charge against the unregulated electronic
cigarette industry that's targeting our kids with insidious flavors of
liquid nicotine like "Chocolate Treat" and "Peachy Keen." So when a
Portland State University study last week found that e-cigarette
"vaping" could expose users to startling amounts of the dangerous
chemical formaldehyde - 5 to 15 times the exposure from traditional
cigarettes! - Jeff got to work.
Leading a group of five Senators, Jeff quickly brought these alarming
findings
to the
attention of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and urged the
agency to act with urgency to issue long-overdue regulations for e-
cigarettes and other tobacco products, including tobacco candy.
Formaldehyde is a known carcinogen and, with the number of high
schoolers using e-cigarettes having tripled since 2011, it's urgent
that we act now to protect the health of our kids.
A Budget that Works for our Middle Class - and for Oregon
This week, the President released his 2016 budget blueprint for the
federal government. A budget is a statement of priorities, and Jeff was
glad to see the President prioritize the strong investments in
education and infrastructure that are necessary to grow and strengthen
our middle class.
This year's budget also contained good news for Oregon with the
inclusion of two very important items: a badly-needed five year
extension of Secure Rural Schools payments to Oregon's timber
communities, and common-sense reforms to how we fund fighting
wildfires. Right now, we under-budget for firefighting and make up the
difference during emergencies by shifting money from wildfire
prevention. This creates a vicious cycle, robbing wildfire prevention
to pay for wildfires that are already burning, which then leads to
worse fires the next year. That's why Jeff has pushed for bipartisan
reforms that would stop shortchanging prevention funds and start
treating the biggest wildfires like any other natural disaster - which
is exactly what they are.

Standing
up
for
Consumer
Protection
It's
no
secret
that
a
lot
of
big
financial
institutions
built
their
business
models
last
decade
on
gambling
in
the
Wall
Street
casino
and
exploiting
their
customers.
The
Dodd
Frank
Act
was
designed
to
put
an
end
to
all
that
and
put
banks
back
in
the
business
of
working
for
Main
Street,
not
the
other
way
around.
But
since
the
law
passed
there's
been
a
constant
effort
to
chip
away
at
its
reforms
and
protections,
and
those
efforts
are
kicking
into
overdrive
following
the
2014
elections.
Jeff
was
recently
named
the
top
Democrat
on
the
Financial
Institutions
and
Consumer
Protection
Subcommittee
of
the
Senate
Banking
Committee
&ndash;
putting
him
in
a
powerful
position
to
fight
against
Wall
Street's
efforts
to
return
to
the
dangerous
practices
that
torched
the
economy
and
stripped
wealth
from
so
many
working
families.
From
this
new
position,
Jeff
will
be
at
the
center
of
battles
to
stand
up
for
working
families,
push
back
on
the
big
banks,
and
protect
essential
consumer
reforms.
And
he'll
be
leading
the
charge
to
protect
the
Consumer
Financial
Protection
Bureau
&ndash;
which
has
already
returned
more
than
$4.6
billion
to
consumers
in
its
first
three-and-a-half
years
&ndash;
keeping
more
money
in
the
pockets
of
middle
class
families.
Sounding
the
Alarm
on
Dangerous
E-Cigarette
Findings
Jeff
has
been
leading
the
charge
against
the
unregulated
electronic
cigarette
industry
that's
targeting
our
kids
with
insidious
flavors
of
liquid
nicotine
like
"Chocolate

and
"Peachy
Keen."
So
when
a
Portland
State
University
study
last
week
found
that
e-cigarette
"vaping"
could
expose
users
to
startling
amounts
of
the
dangerous
chemical
formaldehyde
&ndash;
5
to
15
times
the
exposure
from
traditional
cigarettes!
&ndash;
Jeff
got
to
work.
Leading
a
group
of
five
Senators,
Jeff
quickly
brought
these
alarming
findings
to
the
attention
of
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(FDA)
and
urged
the
agency
to
act
with
urgency
to
issue
long-overdue
regulations
for
e-
cigarettes
and
other
tobacco
products,
including
tobacco
candy.
Formaldehyde
is
a
known

and,
with
the
number
of
high

using
e-cigarettes
having
tripled
since
2011,
it's
urgent
that
we
act
now
to
protect
the
health
of
our
kids.
A
Budget
that
Works
for
our
Middle
Class
-
and
for
Oregon
This
week,
the
President
released
his
2016
budget
blueprint
for
the
federal
government.
A
budget
is
a
statement
of
priorities,
and
Jeff
was
glad
to
see
the
President
prioritize
the
strong
investments
in
education
and
infrastructure
that
are
necessary
to
grow
and
strengthen
our
middle
class.
This
year's
budget
also
contained
good
news
for
Oregon
with
the
inclusion
of
two
very
important
items:
a
badly-needed
five
year
extension
of
Secure
Rural
Schools
payments
to
Oregon's
timber
communities,
and
common-sense
reforms
to
how
we
fund
fighting
wildfires.
Right
now,
we
under-budget
for
firefighting
and
make
up
the
difference
during
emergencies
by
shifting
money
from
wildfire
prevention.
This
creates
a
vicious
cycle,
robbing
wildfire
prevention
to
pay
for
wildfires
that
are
already
burning,
which
then
leads
to
worse
fires
the
next
year.
That's
why
Jeff
has
pushed
for
bipartisan
reforms
that
would
stop
shortchanging
prevention
funds
and
start
treating
the
biggest
wildfires
like
any
other
natural
disaster
&ndash;
which
is
exactly
what
they
are.
