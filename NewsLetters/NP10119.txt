Dear Friend:
Senate Republicans today blocked a raise for 28 million hard-working Americans, including more than 2 million workers in California.
When our workers have more to spend each month, our families do better, our businesses do better and our communities do better. We used to raise the minimum wage with broad bipartisan support, but today's Republican Party won't support a bill that would strengthen the middle class and benefit almost 20 percent of America's children.
To watch my speech on the need to give American workers a fair shot by raising the minimum wage, please click

Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
