Dear Friends,
America was founded on the principle of government by the people and
for the people. But too often, the federal government just gets in our
way. To see a recent example, we need look no further than the failed
launch of the Obamacare website. But the website is just a symptom of a
much larger problem-an ever expanding federal government without
limits.
Science Committee Chairman Smith at a hearing on abusive EPA
regulations.
In the last five years, the deficit has jumped to nearly $17 trillion.
And whether it's the President's takeover of health care or EPA's
abusive regulatory agenda, the federal government continues to try to
take the power away from the people.
We must preserve the system established by our Founders to protect the
rights and liberties of the American people from government overreach
and abuse.
I will continue to work to rein in abusive government regulations,
reduce wasteful spending and restore accountability for the American
people.

Member of Congress
Ensuring Fair and Affordable Health Care
When it comes to Obamacare, the President's broken promises are piling
up. He promised that if you like your plan, you can keep it. But for
millions of Americans, that's not true.
He said that the law would make health insurance more affordable. But
across the country, Americans are seeing their premiums go up, not down.
And by launching Healthcare.gov, the Obama administration sent the
message that the website was safe, secure and open for business. That
wasn't true either.
The more the American people find out about Obamacare, the less they
like it. We need to replace Obamacare with common-sense solutions that
lower costs, expand access to care, and eliminate unfair mandates and
penalties.
Reining in EPA Regulations
The EPA's efforts to expand its regulatory reach across the U.S.
represent a troubling trend. For example, the agency's proposed water
rule is an unprecedented power grab. Under the rule, the EPA would have
the power to regulate all streams, lakes and ponds, including those on
private property. This could be the largest expansion of EPA regulatory
authority ever.
Equally troubling, the EPA continues to rely on secret science and
undisclosed data to support its regulations. As Chairman of the
Science, Space, and Technology Committee, I issued a subpoena that
requires the EPA to make this information public. It was the Science
Committee's first subpoena in 21 years.
It's the EPA's responsibility to ensure that the science it uses is
transparent and that its claims can be verified independently. The EPA
must either make this data public, or commit to no longer using secret
science to support its regulations. Only then can the American people
decide whether the costs of EPA's regulatory agenda are supported by
the facts.
More information on my work as Chairman of the Science Committee can be
found here
.
Balancing the Budget
Under the Obama administration, the national debt has increased 50%--$6
trillion. That's the largest increase under any President. The federal
government now borrows 25 cents on every dollar it spends. This is a
drag on economic growth and contributes to high unemployment.
To secure our nation's fiscal future, we must put an end to the federal
government's spending spree. American families and individuals balance
their budgets every day. The federal government should do the same.
I will continue to support a Balanced Budget Amendment to force the
federal government to practice fiscal restraint.
Protecting American Workers
America has the most generous immigration system in the world,
admitting one million legal immigrants each year. That generosity
should continue. But as Congress considers immigration reform, we must
make sure that our immigration laws protect the interests of American
workers.
Unfortunately, the proposal supported by the President puts illegal
immigrants before Americans. The bill gives amnesty to 12 million
illegal immigrants. This will flood the market with new workers,
costing many Americans their jobs and depressing their wages. Instead
of setting a deadline to secure the border, the bill simply calls for a
plan. But plans are meaningless without action and enforcement.
Rather than support the President's plan, Congress should promote
policies that put the interests of the American people first. We can
reduce illegal immigration and protect jobs for American workers by
securing the border and enforcing current immigration laws.
Fighting Frivolous Lawsuits
Lawsuit abuse is common in America because lawyers who bring frivolous
suits have everything to gain and nothing to lose. Attorneys can file
worthless suits without fear of penalty. Meanwhile, defendants are
faced with years of litigation, attorneys' fees, and an unfairly
damaged reputation.
Last month, the House of Representatives approved legislation that I
authored to fight frivolous lawsuits. The bill restores accountability
to our legal system by making attorneys who file worthless lawsuits pay
the legal fees of innocent defendants. It encourages attorneys to think
twice before filing frivolous lawsuits.

promised
that
if

for

that&#8217;s

across
the
country,
Americans
are
seeing
their

go

And
by
launching
Healthcare.gov,
the
Obama
administration
sent
the
message
that
the
website
was
safe,
secure
and
open
for

wasn&#8217;t

either.
The
more
the

and

Reining
in
EPA
Regulations
The
EPA&#8217;s
efforts
to
expand
its
regulatory
reach
across
the
U.S.
represent
a
troubling
trend. For
example,
the
agency&#8217;s
proposed
water
rule
is
an
unprecedented
power
grab. Under
the
rule,
the
EPA
would
have
the
power
to
regulate
all
streams,
lakes
and
ponds,
including
those
on
private
property.
T his
could
be
the
largest
expansion
of
EPA
regulatory
authority
ever.
Equally
troubling,
the
EPA
continues
to
rely
on
secret
science
and
undisclosed
data
to
support
its
regulations.
As
Chairman
of
the
Science,
Space,
and
Technology
Committee,
I
issued
a
subpoena
that
requires
the
EPA
to
make
this
information
public . It
was
the
Science
Committee&#8217;s
first
subpoena
in
21
years.
It&#8217;s
the
EPA&#8217;s
responsibility
to
ensure
that
the
science
it
uses
is
transparent
and
that
its
claims
can
be
verified
independently.
The
EPA
must
either
make
this
data
public,
or
commit
to
no
longer
using
secret
science
to
support
its
regulations . Only
then
can
the
American
people
decide
whether
the
costs
of
EPA&#8217;s
regulatory
agenda
are
supported
by
the
facts.

on
my
work
as
Chairman
of
the

Committee
can

Under

the
national

is
a

and
contributes

secure
our
nation&#8217;s
fiscal
future,
we
must
put
an

to
the
federal
government&#8217;s
spending
spree.
American
families
and
individuals
balance
their
budgets
every
day. The
federal
government
should
do
the
same .
I
will
continue
to
support
a
Balanced
Budget
Amendment
to
force
the
federal
government
to
practice
fiscal
restraint.
Protecting
American
Workers
America
has
the
most
generous
immigration
system
in
the
world,
admitting
one
million
legal
immigrants
each
year. That
generosity
should
continue. But
as
Congress
considers
immigration
reform,
we
must
make
sure
that
our
immigration
laws
protect
the
interests
of
American
workers.
Unfortunately,
the
proposal
supported
by
the
President
puts
illegal
immigrants
before
Americans. The
bill
gives
amnesty
to
12
million
illegal
immigrants. This
will
flood
the
market
with
new
workers,
costing
many
Americans
their
jobs
and
depressing
their
wages.
Instead
of
setting
a
deadline
to
secure
the
border,
the
bill
simply
calls
for
a
plan. But
plans
are
meaningless
without
action
and
enforcement.
Rather
than
support
the
President&#8217;s
plan,
Congress
should
promote
policies
that
put
the
interests
of
the
American
people
first. We
can
reduce
illegal
immigration
and
protect
jobs
for
American
workers
by
securing
the
border
and
enforcing
current
immigration
laws.
Fighting
Frivolous
Lawsuits
Lawsuit
abuse
is
common
in
America
because
lawyers
who
bring
frivolous
suits
have
everything
to
gain
and
nothing
to

can
file
worthless

without

of

defendants
are
faced
with
years
of
litigation,
attorneys&#8217;

and
an
unfairly
damaged
reputation.
Last
month,
the
House
of
Representatives
approved
legislation
that
I
authored
to
fight
frivolous
lawsuits.
The
bill
restores
accountability
to
our
legal
system
by
making
attorneys
who
file
worthless
lawsuits
pay
the
legal
fees
of
innocent
defendants. It
encourages
attorneys
to
think
twice
before
