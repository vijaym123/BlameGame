David, This week, I began my second term in Congress.
I can&rsquo;t wait to continue working for Illinois -- but first I need to hear what you want me to focus on in 2015.
David, will you fill out our one-question issues survey?
Fight for equal pay &gt;&gt;
End Citizens United &gt;&gt;
Stand up for our veterans &gt;&gt;
Create American jobs &gt;&gt;
Protect Medicare/Social Security &gt;&gt;
Something else? Let us know &gt;&gt;
Your support is the reason we won in 2014. Now, I need your input to make the most out of my second term.
Thanks for filling this out,
Cheri
