Policy Update
*
The Senate passed legislation to support our veterans
and deal with mismanagement at the Department
of Veterans Affairs (VA). The bipartisan bill, which was negotiated by
Republican John McCain and Independent Bernie Sanders, addresses the
issues that led to the mismanagement and includes several measures to
achieve wider VA reform. This bill sends a strong message to our
veterans: we will continue to stand-by you as you stood by us, and we
will do what's right when it comes to fixing problems at the VA.
*
In late May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) reached a consensus
in determining the allocation of disaster relief funds for the
New England groundfishing industry. Maine is expected to receive $2.26
million in assistance.
*
Imagine trying to buy a car without knowing competing prices.
That's what the medical device industry does to hospitals. I spoke out
against it
on the Senate
floor.
*
Various Maine communities will be receiving federal grants to
support important programs and projects. These grants will help provide
equipment for firefighters in Yarmouth
, buoy improvements
to the Casco Bay ferry service
, and facilitate
the cleanup of contaminated sites
around
the state.
Scenes from Washington
Senator Collins and I met with 8th Grade students from Palermo
Consolidated School on the Capitol Steps.
Grover and I helped assemble Warrior Care Packs for our troops at a USO
event. The gang from Sesame Street does a lot of great work with the
USO to support our military members and their families.
Cheers to the Maine Brewers' Guild! I caught up with representatives
from Allagash Brewing Company, Baxter Brewing Co., Maine Beer Company
and Shipyard Brewing Company. I've sponsored a bill with Senator
Collins to help stimulate the craft beer industry.
