Friends,
Judging by the
temperatures this weekend, autumn has officially arrived. It's a
beautiful season in the 14th District, and I hope you've had a great weekend
enjoying fall activities with family and friends.
Our
nation recognized National Manufacturing Day on Friday. This industry is
the backbone of Northeast Ohio's economy and supports 17.4 million
jobs in the United States. There is a special pride put into every
product Made in the USA, and we need to do all we can to protect these
crucial American jobs.
This week, I was honored to receive
the
National Association of Manufacturers Award
for my 100% voting record on manufacturing issues. I am committed to
empowering local manufacturers and making sure they have the resources
they need to compete in our global economy.
On
Wednesday, I had the opportunity to join LyondellBasell in celebrating
their 50th anniversary. This company has demonstrated a true commitment to
Fairport Harbor through job creation and finding important ways to
give back to the community. I was happy to present them with a
Congressional proclamation to commemorate this achievement, and we now look
forward to their future success here in Northeast Ohio.
