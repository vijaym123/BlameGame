Dear Friend,
Tomorrow, families all across Rhode Island and our country will gather
together to give thanks for the many blessings we have enjoyed this
year, as well as the opportunities that we will have in the coming
year. I would like to give thanks for the opportunity to serve you in
Congress and for the privilege of working for Rhode Island. Like all
Rhode Islanders, I am especially thankful to the many brave men and
women who serve in our armed forces and protect the freedoms we enjoy
throughout the year.
As we take stock of all our blessings, we must also remember the
responsibility that we have to look after one another and to ensure
that the full bounty of the opportunities of our great country are
available to all. As Rhode Islanders continue to strive to get back to
work and build real economic security, it's important that we
rededicate ourselves to the work of creating good-paying jobs for
hardworking families and doing everything we can to get our state back
on the right track.
Despite the challenges we face today in our state, let's remember that
from the time the Pilgrims and the Wapanoag tribe celebrated the first
Thanksgiving, we have always come together as one people, united toward
a common purpose and mindful that our best days lie ahead.
I wish you and your family a very Happy Thanksgiving.
My best always,
David Cicilline
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
Tomorrow,
families
all
across
Rhode
Island
and
our
country
will
gather together
to
give
thanks
for
the
many
blessings
we
have
enjoyed
this
year,
as
well
as
the
opportunities
that
we
will
have
in
the
coming
year.
I
would
like
to
give
thanks
for
the
opportunity
to
serve
you
in
Congress
and
for
the
privilege
of
working
for
Rhode
Island.
Like
all
Rhode
Islanders,
I
am
especially
thankful
to
the
many
brave
men
and
women
who
serve
in
our
armed
forces
and
protect
the
freedoms
we
enjoy
throughout
the
year.
As
we
take
stock
of
all
our
blessings,
we
must
also
remember
the
responsibility
that
we
have
to
look
after
one
another
and
to
ensure
that
the
full
bounty
of
the
opportunities
of
our
great
country
are
available
to
all.
As
Rhode
Islanders
continue
to
strive
to
get
back
to
work
and
build
real
economic
security,
it&#8217;s
important
that
we
rededicate
ourselves
to
the
work
of
creating
good-paying
jobs
for
hardworking
families
and
doing
everything
we
can
to
get
our
state
back
on
the
right
track.
Despite
the
challenges
we
face
today
in
our
state,
let&#8217;s
remember
that
from
the
time
the
Pilgrims
and
the
Wapanoag
tribe
celebrated
the
first
Thanksgiving,
we
have
always
come
together
as
one
people,
united
toward
a
common
purpose
and
mindful
that
our
best
days
lie
ahead.
I
wish
you
and
your
family
a
very
Happy
Thanksgiving.
My
best
always,
David
Cicilline
