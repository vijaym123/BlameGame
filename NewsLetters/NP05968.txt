David,
It&rsquo;s incredibly inspiring to see so many people backing my first re-election campaign.
In fact, more than 22,000 supporters have stepped up so far. Thanks, David! But Speaker Boehner, Karl Rove and more Republican groups than I can count are spending over $4,000,000 to takeover Illinois's 10th district.
David, I want to keep fighting for Illinois -- and for you -- but I can&rsquo;t get across the finish line without your help. We&rsquo;ve got 36 days to go and a
one big deadline
staring us in the face tomorrow at midnight.
So whether you give $5 or $50, please make sure to get your donation in immediately. We&rsquo;ve never needed you more.
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks everyone!
