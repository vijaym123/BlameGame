The folks at Biovation in Boothbay are working on a bio-based boot
dryer for the U.S. Marine Corps.
At Eldertide in Dresden to meet with owner Edie Johnston and learn more
about the innovative elderberry products that helped earn her an award
from the U.S. Small Business Administration.
I couldn't resist snapping a "selfie" with Cpl. Scott MacKenzie of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police during the 50th Anniversary Celebration
at the Roosevelt-Campobello International Park.
I met one of my heroes, Ed Bearss, on a morning walk in Maine. Ed is
the former Chief Historian for the National Park Service, and is one of
the world's experts on the Civil War.
At America's First Mile on Route 1 in Fort Kent. Wish I had my

Thanks to my wife Mary for taking this photo of Steve Pressley, first
selectman of Whiting, State Rep. Katherine Cassidy, Jeff Denbow of

Connecting with the People of Maine
I've spent some quality time in Maine this month connecting with folks
all over the state. I've had a terrific time catching up with many of
the people who help make Maine so special.
This year marks the 400th anniversary of Monhegan Island's settlement,
which began in 1614 when Captain John Smith landed on the island.
After marching in a parade across the island, I spoke at a ceremony in
front of the schoolhouse as part of Monhegan's Quadricentennial
celebration
.
It was a great privilege to meet with Korean War Veterans Lou Poulin
and Donald Brawn
at my office in Augusta. I presented them with flags that I had flown
over the U.S. Capitol Building in honor of their birthdays and their
service to our country.
I had a blast with our Acadian brothers and sisters up at the World
Acadian Congress in Madawaska. Vive L' Acadie!
There's intriguing work being done at Auburn Manufacturing, Inc. (AMI)
in Mechanic Falls. The company is a leader in manufacturing fire and
heat-resistant materials. Congress should reauthorize the Export-Import
Bank
to help businesses
like AMI sell their products in international markets.
I stopped by Rock's Family Diner on Main Street in Fort Kent to chat
with local residents.
Visiting the Southern Border
At the beginning of the month, I took a trip down to the Texas border
with Senator Collins and other colleagues to gain a better
understanding of the humanitarian crisis
that has been unfolding there. As I see it, the principle
bottleneck is in the immigration courts. We need more immigration
judges and more courtrooms to deal with the large number of children
trying to enter this country.
Being briefed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials in
McAllen, Texas with Senator Collins and Senator John Barrasso
(R-Wyoming).
Recognizing Maine's Lighthouses
Along with Senator Collins and Senator Chuck Schumer (D-New York), I
worked to have August 7th, 2014 designated as National Lighthouse and
Lighthouse Preservation Day
.
Light Keeper Matt Rosenberg took this breathtaking shot of Nubble Light
in York.
