Weekly Column: Another Health Care Law Delay
This past week, President Obama once again unilaterally delayed the
employer mandate, a key provision within his health care law. The
latest delay provides medium-size businesses with an additional year to
comply with the law's mandate and phases in the same requirement for
larger businesses. We in the House of Representatives continue to ask,
what about the individual mandate - where is the delay for hardworking
Americans? Read full column HERE

Smithville High School Visit
Today, I had the opportunity to meet with American government students
at Smithville High School as a part of my "Visions of the Future"
series. It is important young people are engaged and have ample
opportunity to discuss the many challenges we are facing as a nation. I
had a great time speaking with and answering questions from students
this morning.
