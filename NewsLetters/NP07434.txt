House Republicans are suing President Obama.
Why? Because Barack has the nerve to actually get things done for the middle-class.
Look, you have been there for Barack and me in the past. I can&rsquo;t thank you enough for that. But if we can&rsquo;t prove at a time like this that President Obama has tons of grassroots supporters in his corner:
Republicans win.
So here&rsquo;s the plan: Let&rsquo;s get 20,000 Democrats chipping in TODAY to fight back.
That&rsquo;ll prove once and for all that House Republicans made a huge mistake when they decided to sue the President.
