Dear Friend, As your representative in Congress, I take a great deal of pride in knowing that you have chosen me as your voice on matters of importance to you.
Throughout the year, your thoughts and concerns have been invaluable and I have made a point of sharing them with my colleagues as we work to move our country forward.
It has been an incredible honor to work hard every day on behalf of you, your family, and our community. Here are a few highlights of what we accomplished together in 2014: Military and Veterans: &bull;
Introduced and passed the Military Suicide Reduction Act, H.R. 1463, legislation that helps protect the mental health of deployed service members.
This bill is expected to be signed into law by President Obama within the next couple of weeks. &bull;
Sent a letter to U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki in May asking for a review of VA facilities in Indiana in light of problems discovered at facilities nationwide. Read a copy of the letter here: http://carson.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/icymi-andr-carson-ensuring-top-notch-care-at-va-must-be-priority &bull;
As a Member of the House Armed Services Committee, co-authored the annual National Defense Authorization Act, which trains and equips our troops, strengthens housing and health care resources, provides a pay raise, and otherwise supports service members and their families. Jobs and the Economy: &bull;
Helped to connect unemployed Hoosiers with hiring businesses through my fifth annual job fair.
This year we hosted over 1280 job seekers and 78 employers. &bull;
Hosted a Youth Opportunity Fair to connect Marion County youth with summer programs, internships, volunteer opportunities and jobs. &bull;
Introduced H.R. 4876, the Emerging Business Encouragement Act of 2014, in the U.S. House of Representatives.
This bill would help emerging businesses compete for federal contracts and obtain access to federally backed loans as they get off the ground. Hoosier Priorities: &bull;
Helped secure over $12 million dollars in grants for local non-profits throughout Indiana&rsquo;s 7th Congressional District. &bull;
Held more than 800 legislative and constituent meetings in my Washington D.C. and Indianapolis offices. &bull;
Reserved tours for over 1,750 constituents to Washington D.C. landmarks. As we close out this year, I want to thank you again for trusting me to represent you in Washington.
I look forward continuing our fight for a stronger community, city, and country in 2015. Finally, as this is the last Carson Courier for 2014, I want to wish you a safe and happy holiday season and Happy New Year! Regards, Andr&eacute;
