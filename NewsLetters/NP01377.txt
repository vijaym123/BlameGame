Thune Applauds
Senate Passage of Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act
Today, Sen.
John Thune (R-S.D.) supported critical legislation to provide aid to
victims of human trafficking and empower state law enforcement to target
traffickers by voting in favor of the Justice for Victims of
Trafficking Act (S. 178), which passed the Senate by a vote of 99 to
0.
This bill creates a Domestic
Trafficking Victims Fund to increase federal support available to
trafficking victims, financed by increased penalties for convicted
traffickers. The bill also ensures that funds in the Justice for Victims of
Trafficking Act are not used to pay for abortions. Additionally, the bill
assists victims of human trafficking by providing law enforcement
personnel with additional tools to combat human trafficking offenses and
gives victims the aid and resources they so greatly
deserve.
This legislation has now been sent to
the House of Representatives and Sen. Thune is hopeful that the House
will act quickly to help advance the fight against trafficking in
America, and help promote the healing of victims of human
trafficking.
