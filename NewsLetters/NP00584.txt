4th
DISTRICT

CONTACT
May 29, 2015
Dear Friend,
Here is a quick update with the latest in
what is happening in Washington and my work for Alabama's 4th District.
As always, please let me know whenever I can be of assistance.
Please k eep in touch
and follow me on
Twitter
and
Facebook . Also, for updated
information check out my
virtual office
and
encourage your friends and family to sign-up for my monthly e-newsletter,
the
Aderholt Address .
Sincerely,
Robert B. Aderholt
Member of Congress
Protecting the
Unborn
On May 13th I proudly cast a vote for H.R. 36, the Pain
Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.
This bill prohibits elective
abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy, the point at which an unborn
baby can feel pain.
As Members of Congress, elected and sworn to
protect the Constitution of the United States, we have an obligation
to protect innocent life. As Americans we like to consider ourselves
to be among the most civilized societies in the world.
That is
why I have such a difficult time understanding why our law so many times
continues to promote, support, and even encourage the act of stopping
a defenseless human heartbeat.
As long as I continue to serve
as a Member of Congress, I hope to always rise to defend the most
innocent among us with my vote.

Keeping
America First in Space and Science
I continue to
serve on the House Appropriations Committee and on May 20th the Committee
passed the Commerce, Justice and Science funding bill. We have worked
diligently to make sure it has a positive impact on Alabama.
This bill ensures continued funding and in some cases actually increases
funding for many NASA, Department of Justice (DOJ), and science
related projects. Specifically, we were able to ensure adequate funding for
a number of projects that will ensure America remains a leader in
space exploration and science.
The bill also requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) to provide more for those seeking to produce independent
climate model evaluations in other words, the bill will require the
agency to provide grants to
all
researchers, not just those
whose conclusions agree with the Administrations global warming
position.
There is a great deal of debate about the validity, causes,
and consequences of Global Warming/Climate Change.
Unfortunately,
in the past, the Federal Government has routinely steered research
funding only to those who agree with the Administrations stance on the
issue to further their war on coal
efforts.

Russellville High School on May 8, 2015.
The students were in
Washington to compete in a national rocket challenge, and they won!
They
will now represent America in Paris at the international
finals.
4th
District Art Competition
I continue to be impressed by
the unbelievable talent in our District.
I got to see it firsthand
on May 4th at the annual 4th District Art Competition, which was at
Wallace State Community College. We received more than 150 entries this
year.
Cadley Jackson, a senior at Guntersville High School, won
this years Best of Show award.
Her colored pencil sketch
will hang for the next year inside the U.S. Capitol complex in
Washington, D.C.
Many thanks to Dr.
Vicki Karolewics and everyone at Wallace State Community College for
hosting the event; if you would like to see Cadleys winning piece and
others, please feel free visit them on my Facebook page
here .

District Art Competition on May 4th,

Guntersville with the Best of Show award at Wallace State, where she is

National Day of Prayer
On May 7th , from D.C.
to Alabama, and everywhere around our nation, people got down on
their knees to pray for our country on the National Day of Prayer. I was
honored to sponsor the National Day of Prayer event that took place on
Capitol Hill at the Cannon House Office
Building.
In my remarks at the service I took time to ask
for prayers for those who live in countries where the very act of
expressing your faith can lead to prosecution, persecution, and even
death.
I am reminded that we are so blessed to live in a land where
we can openly pray for Gods guidance!
May we never take that
for granted.
Although it may
technically no longer be the actual National Day of Prayer, I think we need
to continue to pray for our area. I certainly appreciate your prayers
for me as I work to represent the 4th District.
May 1 st
was Lunch Heroes Day.
The lunchroom staff at
Vinemont School in Cullman County were great sports in helping
produce a
video
to thank all the lunchroom employees
across the 4 th
District.
Memorial Day
May 25th was of course Memorial
Day.
For some this is the unofficial start to summer, a day
for grilling hamburgers and hotdogs, or simply, a day off from work.
But its important to remember the origin of this holiday:
Memorial Day is the day that we, as a nation, have set aside to remember
those who laid down their lives for our freedom.
We can never repay the sacrifice they made, but I
believe its very important that we try to pay tribute to these brave
men and women who answered their countrys call by paying the ultimate
price.
We put together a video (which you can see
here ) dedicated to those from our District who gave, as Abraham
Lincoln said, the last full measure of devotion.
