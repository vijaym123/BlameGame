David,
Today we gather and give thanks for the many blessings we enjoy as Americans. As we come together with family and friends for feasts and celebrations, let us also reflect on those less fortunate and pray that their holiday season and coming New Year may also be one of happiness and health.
Personally, I am thankful for the love and respect of my family and the confidence and trust of my friends. On this Thanksgiving in particular, I am grateful for the support of the countless volunteers and the more than 28,000 people like you who believed in me and invested in our campaign.
I am most grateful for the opportunity the voters of Illinois&rsquo;s 10th District provided me to serve as their Representative in the 113th Congress. It has truly been the highest honor and greatest responsibility of my life. While my term in Congress is soon ending, my commitment to working with you to strengthen our communities and build a better nation remains as strong as ever.
Finally, I ask us all to include in our thoughts this Thanksgiving day, and every day, the many brave men and women serving our country, including all their families who share in the sacrifice of their service.
Wishing you a Happy Thanksgiving.
Sincerely,
Brad
