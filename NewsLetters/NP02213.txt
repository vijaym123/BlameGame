Pro-Growth, Pro-Family Tax Reform
The greatest
driver of American prosperity is equal access to and equal
opportunity within our free enterprise economy. Thats what spurs innovation,
creates jobs, and drives up the take-home pay of working
Americans.
Today, in an increasingly competitive global economy,
the greatest impediments to economic opportunity and growth are unfair,
dysfunctional government policies that have not kept up with changing
times. These policies empower political insiders and crony
capitalists elites at everyone elses expense.
One place
where these policies are especially prevalent is the federal tax code. For
this reason, I joined with Senator Marco Rubio to introduce a
pro-growth, pro-family tax reform plan
to correct these
unfair, broken policies and to level the playing field for all
individuals, families, and businesses.
We started this tax
reform effort with a set of
goals:
Treat all families equitably and eliminate the tax
codes biases against parents and married
couples;
Encourage economic growth that will yield more
private sector jobs and higher wages;
Remove crony biases in the code;
Enhance the ability of firms located in the United States to compete
in the global market; and
Curtail the Internal Revenue Services discretion and capacity for
abuse.
This plan rejects the false choice that only one goal
of reform can be pursued at a time and offers a package that is both
pro-growth and pro-family.
We believe that by cutting tax rates,
eliminating double taxation, taxing saving and investment less
punitively and lifting the burden placed on American families we can have
both higher levels of growth, higher family incomes, and widely shared
prosperity.
Senator Rubio and I wrote an op-ed for the Wall
Street Journal to share some of the specifics of this plan, and you
can
read it here .
I hope you will join me in
my monthly tele-townhall this Wednesday at 7:00 p.m., so I can hear
your feedback on this plan.
In addition to this tax reform plan, I
also introduced bills last week to
reform our higher
education system
and to
increase accountability
at the Department of Justice .
I am encouraged by the support
these proposals are finding in Washington, and I am looking forward
to making sure you are part of the dialogue to fix our broken
government.
