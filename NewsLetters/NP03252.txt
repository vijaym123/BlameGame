Dear Friend,
This week,
President Barack Obama laid out his progressive vision for America in the
State of the Union. I am proud that he remains committed to the people
and issues I came to Washington to defend. The President made clear
that
the middle class is the heartbeat
of America ; that we must make paychecks go farther,
empower people through education, and keep jobs in America. President
Obama has overseen the most dramatic economic turnaround since President
Franklin Roosevelt, and I look forward to advancing the President's
policies to help more people get closer to achieving the American
Dream.
In 1971, I came to Congress to fight for working
families.
To ensure that everyone in America had access to
affordable housing and healthcare and quality education. To see that every
worker earns a living wage and has opportunities to succeed.
Forty-four years after my first State of the Union, I am proud to stand behind
President Obama to help build a nation that rewards the hard working
people at the foundation of America.
Why I Stand With the President:
Proposals to Invest in America's
Families:
Cut taxes for families . Will help working parents provide
for their kids and save for retirement.
Free
community college tuitition . Will enable everyone to develop the
skills necessary to be competitive in today's job
market
Combat climate change.
New regulations cutting carbon
and methane emissions will stem the threat climate change poses to our
national security and public health, while building a renewable
economy for future generations.
Protect the Affordable
Care Act.
The legislation, for which I was the prime
sponsor, continues to expand healthcare coverage and keep costs
low.
Normalize relations with Cuba . Opening doors
with Cuba will expand America's partners in trade and travel. My bill
will make the President's actions permanent in law.
Your opinion is
valuable to me. So please visit my website at

for more information, and to engage with me on
Facebook
and on
Twitter . It's always a great honor serving
you.
Best regards,
Charles B.

LEGISLATIVE
UPDATE
Following a strong push by President Barack
Obama during his 2015 State of the Union to make college education
affordable, I have introduced, along with dozens of House Democrats, the
Student Loan Interest Deduction (SLID) Act .
The SLID Act will help ease the burden of student
loan debt. Graduating from college is hard enough.
Let's make sure that students worry less about how they'll pay for
it
and more about the exciting opportunities that they can
pursue.
