Wisdom of the District: Defense Budget
On Monday, the Administration unveiled highlights from the FY15 Defense budget. This proposal included a plan to shrink active duty military forces to pre-WWII levels, retire the USS George Washington, eliminate ten large surface combatant ships by 2023, and halt the carrier variant of the Joint Strike Fighter for two years. In addition, the Secretarys budget calls for changes to service members housing allowances and health care contributions. It also calls for the closure of all U.S. based commissaries.
The Presidents budget will formally be released in March and sent to Congress for consideration.
Do you believe that the Presidents proposal is the most appropriate way to set our nation on a better fiscal path?
( )
Yes, we are spending too much money on defense and all of the proposed reforms are prudent.
( ) Yes, many of these programs have outlived their necessity and represent a Cold War posture.
( ) Some of these reforms make sense, but on the whole, the proposal cuts too much from our national defense.
( ) No, our military forces guarantee our safety and we should increase our defense budget but make cuts to other government programs and mandatory spending.
( ) I have another answer.
