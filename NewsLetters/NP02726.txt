Congressman
Bruce Poliquin
Representing the 2nd District
February 13, 2015
ObamaCare's Individual
Mandate : Im proud to help repeal ObamaCares penalizing
individual mandate. Our hard-working families should not be fined for
opting not to purchase a health insurance plan that does not fit their
budget or health care needs.

Congressman Poliquin Grills HUD Secretary :
"Do you think having
a huge government organization that's responsible for more than half
of all the mortgage insurance in America, which puts the taxpayers on
the hook for $1.1 trillion, and you folks don't know how big you want
to get; do you think that lives up to your mission statement of being
fiscally accountable, sir?"
Congressman Poliquin on
Public Housing : "We have a limited amount of money to help
those who desperately need help. So I think we ought to do things very
differently, Mr. Chairman, when it comes to housing to help our
families."
On To The President : Once
completed, with all the environmental safeguards in place, the Keystone
XL Pipeline will help increase the supply and drive down the cost of
heating oil, gasoline and diesel. This will create more jobs, help our
hard-working small businesses grow and build a better business
climate.
Letter
To The President : "To save our mills, factories and jobs,
government should do everything possible to lower the costs to run our
businesses. Falling gasoline, diesel, and heating oil prices will
also help our hurting families fill their vehicles, heat their homes, and
pay the monthly electric bills."
