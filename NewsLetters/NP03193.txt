Forbes Reacts to Military Compensation Report
Washington, D.C.
Congressman J. Randy Forbes (VA-04) released the following statement on the release of the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commissions final report:
How we treat those who have worn our nations uniform defines us as a country. The compensation and benefits that our servicemen and women have earned, whether competitive pay, a strong military commissary system, robust healthcare options, or the promise of a dignified retirement, are essential to retaining our current personnel and attracting future recruits. Earlier today, the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission released a report recommending changes to the compensation and benefits of active-duty and retired military personnel.
These recommendations are just thatrecommendations. Given the serious national security challenges facing our country, I remain opposed to changes to our compensation system that break faith with our warriors and jeopardize the All-Volunteer Force that has served our nation so ably.
