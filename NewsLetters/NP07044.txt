Dear Fellow
Nevadan,
After spending their lives working and contributing to their communities,
Americas seniors have earned the right to retire with dignity, free
from the fluctuations of the stock market and the threat of poverty.
For nearly eight decades, Social Security has secured that right by
providing reliable benefits to seniors in Nevada and across the country.
Roughly 90 percent of seniors over 65 now receive benefits. Without
Social Security, nearly half of Americas seniors would live below the
poverty line.
Today, we reflect on the importance of Social
Security as we celebrate the program's 79th anniversary. Though the
program has faced intense opposition from the very beginning, it's now
clear that Social Security has been a remarkable success. In fact, in
my view, Social Security is the most successful program in the history
of our country.
Unfortunately, many in Washington remain
hostile to Social Security. Opponents are determined to cut the
program's already modest benefits, if not eliminate them altogether. To
justify such cuts, critics typically resort to scare tactics, claiming that
the program is in crisis and on the verge of bankruptcy. This claim is
simply false, no matter how often it is repeated. In truth, the most
recent report of Social Security's actuaries verified that Social
Security will be able to pay every penny of promised retirement benefits
for nearly 20 years. Even without any changes, after that Social
Security still will be able to pay roughly three-quarters of such benefits.
And with relatively minor reforms, we can keep the program strong for
decades to come.
Those of us who support Social Security
need to fight back against misleading attacks and oppose unfair benefit
cuts. We also must oppose efforts to privatize the program. I led the
opposition to the Bush Administrations privatization proposal in
2005; it was a dangerous and fiscally irresponsible plan, and very
unpopular. Though we defeated that effort, many conservative leaders still
support privatization and are determined to hand Social Security over to
Wall Street, putting seniors at the mercy of the stock
market.
When critics argue for benefit cuts and privatization, it's
important to remind them that Social Security is not a handout; it is a
benefit that Americans earn, by working and paying into the system.
Cutting those earned benefits, or putting them at needless risk, would
break our promise to seniors. That would be wrong, and I will continue to
do everything I can to protect Nevada's seniors and oppose such
proposals.
