Nancy Pelosi has emailed you.
Joe Biden has emailed you.
And now I&rsquo;ve emailed you.
We wouldn't all be asking if it wasn't so important.
Right now, we&rsquo;re being outspent 2-to-1 by Republican outside groups in key races. If we allow that to continue, Republicans could win their largest Congressional majority yet. And you know exactly what that would mean.
We can stop that from happening -- but I need you right now. We&rsquo;re still coming up 37,715 donations short of our goal. Can I count on you today? All Gifts Today Triple-Matched! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
Barack Obama
