Dear Friends,
Last
week I requested that FEMA extend the deadline for homeowners to file
completed flood insurance claims.
Today, I am happy to say that
request has been granted.
I called on FEMA to grant
homeowners who are still struggling to rebuild after Superstorm Sandy more
time to file Proof of Loss documentation.
FEMA has heard
the call from me and the residents of the First Congressional
District to provide a longer window for the filing of necessary paperwork for
flood insurance claims.
I thank the leadership at FEMA for
taking this request seriously and lessening some of the burden homeowners
are facing.
This extension will allow Long Islanders additional
time to fully and accurately document losses and account for
additional expenses that were discovered after the rebuilding
began.
The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) requires homeowners to
submit a Proof of Loss form detailing the amount being claimed under
the policy.
The form requires supporting documentation, such as
cancelled checks and invoices from contractors, in order to process
claims.
The most recent deadline, set for April 28, 2014,
will now be extended another 6 months to October 29,
2014.
If you require assistance with a Proof of Loss claim or any other
issue related to Superstorm Sandy or another federal matter, please do not
hesitate to call my office at (631)
289-6500.
Sincerely,
Congressman Tim Bishop
First District of
New York
