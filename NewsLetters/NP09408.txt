Dear Friend,
Like many
Montanans, I am outraged by reports that a number of VA clinics have failed to
give our veterans the care and honor they deserve. These clinics
deliberately covered up delays that may have ultimately led to the
preventable deaths of at least 40 veterans. Yet the VA executives at these
troubled facilities are more likely to be given a bonus than face any
sort of accountability. This is disgraceful, and I stand with the
millions of Americans who are demanding accountability from the
VA.
Thats why I cosponsored and supported the passage Department of
Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act of 2014 (H.R. 4031).
This bipartisan bill, which passed the House yesterday, gives the VA
Secretary the authority to remove employees of the Senior Executive
Service due to poor performance
senior executives like those where the 40
preventable deaths occurred.
It was reported yesterday
that the director of the Phoenix VA received a bonus of $8,495 in April
while her facility - where veterans were dying - was under
investigation by the Office of Inspector General.
Twenty-six
VA facilities across the country are now under investigation. Instead
of receiving tax-payer funded bonuses, the managers of facilities
should be held responsible for any mismanagement or malfeasance that
happens on their watch.
Now that its passed the House, we need
the U.S. Senate to act on this important reform to bring
accountability to the VA.
As always, please don't hesitate to
contact my office
if you have any concerns, questions, or ideas to
share with
me.
Sincerely,
Steve Daines
