Dear Friend -
I wanted to open this e-newsletter with some exciting news. Last week,
I was named
chairman of the House Armed Services
Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations by Armed Services
Committee Chairman Buck McKeon. Being chosen to lead this key
subcommittee is a great honor, and I look forward to all of the
important work to be done in 2014.
One of the reasons I first ran for Congress was to serve our men and
women in uniform by bringing the perspective of a soldier to critical
national security and foreign affairs debates in Congress. I can think
of no better way to do that than by providing oversight of the
Department of Defense to ensure your tax dollars are responsibly spent
and that Pentagon programs are efficiently developed and implemented.
I hope that you will keep reading to learn more about my efforts to
improve the economy, the recently-passed spending bill, and my 2013
year in review. You can stay up-to-date on my work in real time by
connecting with me on social media
. I am on Facebook, Twitter, Flickr,
and Pinterest as Rep. Joe Heck.
As always, do not hesitate to contact me
if you have concerns about any issue currently before
Congress.
It remains an honor and privilege to serve you in the House
of Representatives.
Sincerely,
Joe
DR. JOE HECK
Member of Congress
The Answer to Joblessness is More Jobs
The January unemployment report was not how we were hoping to start
2014. While the unemployment rate decreased (largely due to people
ending their job searches), there are still far too many Americans who
are unemployed or underemployed. Meanwhile, Nevada continues to lead
the nation with an unemployment rate of more than 9%. While we hear
calls for more stimulus-style spending and minimum wage increases, the
best answer to joblessness is always more jobs. In Congress, I am
focused on advancing legislation
that sets the economic conditions for the
private sector to create jobs and helps out-of-work individuals learn
skills that will help them fill current openings. The House has
literally passed dozens of bills that would do just that.
Unfortunately, they are sitting in the Senate awaiting action. Click

Spending Bill a Step in the Right Direction on Military Pension,
Spending
Last week, the House passed an Omnibus spending bill that provides
funding for the federal government for the remainder of Fiscal Year
2014. I supported the bill
because it takes an important first step in correcting the injustice
that was done to our retired service men and women in the December
Bipartisan Budget Agreement. This bill restores the benefits of
medically-retired veterans and survivor benefit plan recipients that
were cut in that previous agreement. However, I will not rest until the
full COLA of all military retirees and surviving spouses are restored.
In addition, the bill reduces discretionary spending for the fourth
year in a row. Reducing spending and our national debt are essential to
improving the economy and giving our children and grandchildren a
better future.
With a national debt of more than $17 trillion, I know
we still have a great deal of work to do, but this bill is step in the
right direction. The chart below shows discretionary spending decreases
under Republican leadership in the House.
Health Exchange Security, Transparency Bills Pass House
ObamaCare continues to be a focus in the House of Representatives.
After the shaky rollout of the federal exchanges, there are still
concerns about the security of the site and the level of transparency
from the Administration. I maintain my belief that the law should be
repealed and replaced with patient-centered reforms that increase
access and decrease costs but in the meantime, we must ensure that the
exchange website and telephone call centers are secure as possible and
operating in a transparent manner. The House recently passed two
bipartisan bills that would do just that. The first requires consumers
to be notified of security breaches that could compromise personal data
on the exchange websites.
The second provides transparency for the
American people as they use the healthcare.gov exchanges by requiring
weekly reports on the site's functionality and any difficulties users
may be having. To learn more about my efforts to enact meaningful,
patient-centered reforms to our health care system visit

2013 in Review
Finally, I wanted to share with you a graphic that highlights my work
on your behalf in 2013. It is an honor and privilege to serve as your
voice in the House of Representatives and I look forward to working for
you in 2014!

The
Answer
to
Joblessness
is
More
Jobs
The
January
unemployment
report
was
not
how
we
were
hoping
to
start
2014.
While
the
unemployment
rate
decreased
(largely
due
to
people

there
are
still
far
too
many
Americans
who
are
unemployed
or
underemployed.
Meanwhile,
Nevada
continues
to
lead
the
nation
with
an
unemployment
rate
of
more
than
9%.
While
we
hear
calls
for
more
stimulus-style
spending
and
minimum
wage
increases,
the
best
answer
to
joblessness
is
always
more
jobs.
In
Congress,
I
am
focused
on
advancing
legislation
that
sets
the
economic
conditions
for
the
private
sector
to
create
jobs
and
helps
out-of-work

Spending
Bill
a
Step
in
the
Right
Direction
on
Military
Pension,
Spending
Last
week,
the
House
passed
an
Omnibus
spending
bill
that
provides
funding
for
the
federal
government
for
the
remainder
of
Fiscal
Year
2014.
I
supported
the
bill
because
it
takes
an
important
first
step
in
correcting
the
injustice
that
was
done
to
our
retired
service
men
and
women
in
the
December
Bipartisan
Budget
Agreement.
This
bill
restores
the
benefits
of
medically-retired
veterans
and
survivor
benefit
plan
recipients
that
were
cut
in
that
previous
agreement.
However,
I
will
not
rest
until
the
full
COLA
of
all
military
retirees
and
surviving
spouses
are
restored.
In
addition,
the
bill
reduces
discretionary
spending
for
the
fourth
year
in
a
row.
Reducing
spending
and
our
national
debt
are
essential
to
improving
the
economy
and
giving
our
children
and
grandchildren
a
better
future.
With
a
national
debt
of
more
than
$17
trillion,
I
know
we
still
have
a
great
deal
of
work
to
do,
but
this
bill
is
step
in
the
right
direction.
The
chart
below
shows
discretionary
spending
decreases
under
Republican
leadership
in
the
House.

ObamaCare

to
be
a

After
the

of
the
federal
exchanges,
there
are
still
concerns
about
the
security
of
the
site
and
the
level
of
transparency
from
the
Administration.
I
maintain
my
belief
that
the
law
should
be
repealed
and
replaced
with
patient-centered
reforms
that
increase
access
and
decrease
costs
but
in
the
meantime,
we
must
ensure
that
the
exchange
website
and
telephone
call
centers
are
secure
as
possible
and
operating
in
a
transparent
manner.
The
House
recently
passed
two
bipartisan bills
that
would
do
just
that.
The
first
requires
consumers
to
be

of
security

The

may
