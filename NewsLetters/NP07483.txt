Joe Kennedy emailed you.
Jan Schakowsky emailed you.
And now I&rsquo;m emailing you.
We wouldn&rsquo;t send you all these emails if it weren&rsquo;t so important.
My race is deadlocked -- as close to a tie as it can get.
So David, I&rsquo;m asking: use one of these links to make a donation before tonight&rsquo;s deadline. If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
I am counting on you.
