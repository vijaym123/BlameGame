Answering
Reagan's Challenge
Yesterday I had the opportunity of
delivering a speech
at the Reagan Ranch to
commemorate the 33rd anniversary of the signing of the Economic Recovery Tax
Act of 1981.
Today, conservatives tend to think of that moment as the
beginning
of Reagans
and the countrys - triumphant era, which
would eventually usher in the longest peacetime recovery in American
history, victory in the Cold War abroad, and the restoration of the
American Dream at home.
Twenty million new jobs. A forty-nine-state
landslide. Tear down this wall. Shining city on a hill.
Cadence
and courage.
Thats
the Reagan conservatives all remember and revere.
But I submit that is
not
the only Reagan conservatives need to
study and emulate most today.
The obvious achievements following August 1981
provide a showcase of what we can learn from our 40 th
president.
But some of the most important lessons we can take are from
Reagans hard and heroic work leading up to his electoral victory in
1980 .
The four-year stretch between 1976 and 1980 was a time similar to
our own. The unemployment rate was coming down, but still too high.
The economy was recovering, but not enough to restore broad prosperity.
Energy dysfunction, rising prices and an unfair tax system were
eating up what gains working families
did
see in their take-home
pay.
But
it wasnt just about statistics. Humiliating failures of leadership at
home and abroad throughout the previous decade had taken their toll as
well. A psychological pall was descending on the country, leaving
Americans uncharacteristically anxious and pessimistic. When grinding
stagflation steered us toward yet another recession, many Americans began
to wonder if our best days had come and gone.
It was in
that
time, in
my view, that Reagan did perhaps the most important work of his
career.
Coincidentally, the similarities between the late 1970s and today seem to
grow by the hour.
Now, as then, our economy is struggling. The great
American middle class is beset with anxiety. Stagnant wages dont keep
up with the rising cost of living. For too many Americans,
opportunities seem to be narrowing, and the American Dream seems to be slipping
out of reach.
Meanwhile, a chasm of distrust is opening between the American
people and their government. Both parties are seen as incapable of
producing innovative solutions to growing problems, or uninterested in even
trying. Reagans forgotten Americans are once again being left
behind.
I
believe this is the challenge of our time, and I addressed how we can
meet this challenge in my speech.
I invite you to
read the speech to learn more about the solutions I am proposing
to answer Reagan's challenge.
I also invite you to come to one of the
five upcoming town halls I am hosting during the last two
weeks of August
to share your thoughts and feedback with me.
Reagan's agenda was designed to give ordinary Americans
even more
power
to make decisions. He respected them and trusted them,
and thought the government should simply get out of the way.
He
knew the answer was not to get America to trust Washington; it was to
get Washington to trust America.
Today, some see it as ironic that as
Reagan
decentralized
power to a diverse, divided
nation...
we
came back together . But its not ironic at
all. Its the tried-and-true genius of the American way of life that has
sustained our exceptional republic for more than two
centuries.
I look
forward to a vibrant dialogue as we explore a new agenda of solutions to
answer Reagan's challenge and once again remember America's forgotten
families.
