Friend,
It&#39;s that time of year again-- with the holidays coming to a close, it&#39;s time to buckle down on those New Year&#39;s resolutions.
Your resolution may be to spend more time with family, quit a bad habit, or lose a few pounds. Our New Year&#39;s resolution is simple-- to do everything we can to ensure our victory in November.
In preparation for this, we&#39;ve been reviewing our year end numbers-- and we&#39;re coming up short. This is our final chance to show our strength in 2013, and we need to hit our end of year benchmarks to make sure our campaign continues to grow in January.
Our deadline is Tuesday night at midnight, and we are about $5,000 away from our 2013 goal. Can you chip in $5 or more now to help us get there?
Resolutions can be a real challenge, but with the support of friends and family, it&#39;s a lot easier to find success. And that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re counting on here-- that if our friends and families stand together, we will see our resolution through to victory in November.
We wouldn&#39;t ask if it wasn&#39;t absolutely necessary-- and we&#39;re so close to our 2013 goal that your $5 (or whatever you can afford) will make a real difference.
Please click here to give by our deadline on Tuesday, December 31st.
It&#39;s a new year and a fresh start, and if you&#39;ll join us, we will be successful in meeting all of our 2014 goals.
Be well,
