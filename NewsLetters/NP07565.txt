David --
Here&rsquo;s a little secret about elections: 100 days out from the big day, we're pretty darn sure how most of the population will vote.
Winning and losing will come down to the last few undecided voters -- and they&rsquo;re about to get hammered with negative ads distorting Brad Schneider&rsquo;s record. So here&rsquo;s the plan: we&rsquo;re going to call out their lies, expose the Republicans' plan to sell out the middle class, re-elect Brad, and celebrate on Election Day.
Does that sound good? Well, then Brad needs your help. His biggest fundraising deadline yet hits in just 4 days. Please donate $5 or more to back up Brad Schneider's fight against right-wing attacks &gt;&gt; If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Let&rsquo;s do this,
Paul
