Dear Friend,
Tax season is upon us, and if you have waited until the last moment to
file, here's some information to help you meet the April 15th Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) deadline.
Guarding Yourself Against Identity Theft
South Florida is a hotbed for the growing crime of identity theft.
To
fight back this increasing criminal activity, I am supporting a
bipartisan bill introduced by Congresswoman Wasserman Shultz that
increases penalties for tax return identity thieves.
In the meantime, don't you be the unlucky person who has their IRS
refund check fraudulently claimed by another. Protect yourself and
don't carry identification with you that has your social security
number on it. If you are a victim of identity theft, call the IRS at
800-908-4490, or visit the website for more information
.

)
Programs to Help With Filing Your Taxes
Free help for taxpayers is available on the IRS Web site

olunteers

phone (IRS Tax Help Line for Individuals, 1-800-829-1040), at local IRS
offices and at many community locations.

provide assistance, in person, do those who need it.

assistance to military personnel and their families

Forces Tax Council oversees the operation of the military tax programs
worldwide, and serves as the main conduit for outreach by the IRS to
military personnel and their families. Volunteers are trained and
equipped to address military-specific tax issues, such as combat zone
tax benefits and the effect of the new EITC guidelines.

taxpayers.
