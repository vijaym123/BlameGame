Memorial Day
A Celebration of Our Nation's Heroes
Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery
As Memorial Day quickly approaches, let us remember the brave men and
women who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom. The fallen
heroes of our country valiantly put their lives on the line while
fighting for our nation. We must always remember the hardships these
patriots suffered to protect our country and its liberty.
This celebration of our nation's heroes gives us the opportunity to
reflect upon how our veterans are treated when they return home from
duty. As the son of a World War II veteran, I am a firm believer that
veterans should have access to the best care our nation has to offer.
It is completely unacceptable that any veteran who has given up so much
for our country would not receive timely, first-class care. In an
effort to improve veterans' care in Tennessee, we recently opened two
new Veterans Affairs clinics in McMinn County and Roane County. While
the opening of these two VA clinics marks a significant victory for
veterans in East Tennessee, there is still more that must be done to
help these patriots. As we celebrate these heroes and all the men and
women who have served in the armed forces, let us never forget their
sacrifices for our freedoms.
Sincerely,
Chuck

Memorial
Day A
Celebration
of
Our
Nation's
Heroes
Tomb
of
the
Unknowns
at
Arlington
National
Cemetery
As
Memorial
Day
quickly
approaches,
let
us
remember
the
brave
men
and
women
who
have
made
the
ultimate
sacrifice
for
our
freedom.
The
fallen
heroes
of
our
country
valiantly
put
their
lives
on
the
line
while
fighting
for
our
nation.
We
must
always
remember
the
hardships
these
patriots
suffered
to
protect
our
country
and
its
liberty.
This
celebration
of
our
nation&#8217;s
heroes
gives
us
the
opportunity
to
reflect
upon
how
our
veterans
are
treated
when
they
return
home
from
duty.
As
the
son
of
a
World
War
II
veteran,
I
am
a
firm
believer
that
veterans
should
have
access
to
the
best
care
our
nation
has
to
offer.
It
is
completely
unacceptable
that
any
veteran
who
has
given
up
so
much
for
our
country
would
not
receive
timely,
first-class
care.
In
an
effort
to
improve
veterans&#8217;
care
in
Tennessee,
we
recently
opened
two
new
Veterans
Affairs
clinics
in
McMinn
County
and
Roane
County.
While
the
opening
of
these
two
VA
clinics
marks
a
significant
victory
for
veterans
in
East
Tennessee,
there
is
still
more
that
must
be
done
to
help
these
patriots.
As
we
celebrate
these
heroes
and
all
the
men
and
women
who
have
served
in
the
armed
forces,
let
us
never
forget
their
sacrifices
for
our
freedoms.
