Friends,
After much deliberation, the House
passed a border security plan on Friday to address the immigration crisis
occurring at our southern border.
These bills will ramp-up
border security, reunite children with their families back in their home
countries, and prioritize funding for border security so the
Administration does not receive a blank check.
Please read this
breakdown of the Border Plan and share it with your family and
friends:
Defending the Constitution
On Wednesday, the
House
voted to defend the Constitution
and stop President
Obama from acting unilaterally.
Our Constitution clearly outlines
the separation of powers, which the President and his Administration
have blatantly ignored.
For example, we learned on Thursday
that the
CIA snooped through Senators
and Senate staffers emails .
Even when
Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein suspected the CIA of spying in March, U.S.
Attorney General Eric Holder and the Department of Justice refused to
investigate.
An Inspector General Audit released this week
confirmed Senator Feinsteins computer hacking suspicions.
The CIA had
been spying unconstitutionally on the Senate, but the White House
gave a robust defense of the CIA.
When asked if the snooping
scandal has jeopardized the agency heads job, the White House responded,
absolutely not."
The CIA's actions were unconstitutional and
criminal.
Someone must be held accountable.
I went on
C-SPAN's Washington Journal
program to discuss the lawsuit and other legislative priorities of
the House of Representatives.
During the interview, the host
played a clip of President Obama's reaction to the House's lawsuit and then
asked me to respond.
In my response, I pointed out that the
House has passed 40 jobs bills, 10 of which had great support from
House Democrats.
Sadly, Senator Harry Reid refuses to bring these
bills up for a vote in the Senate.

Solution to VAs Shameful Audit Sent to the
President
According to an
internal
audit released this week
by the Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA), nearly 40 percent of employees at the Charleston VA Medical Center
were instructed to falsify appointment data.
This is three
times higher than the national average.
At Columbias VA
Medical Center, 16 percent of VA employees said they were told to
manipulate scheduling data.
This is a disgrace.
Our veterans put
their lives on the line for our country and in return the government
told them to get at the back of a fabricated appointment line.
I
am glad my colleagues in the House and Senate were able to come
together to give our veterans more options for health care, including
private care, and hire more doctors and health staff to attend to our
veterans needs.

Choice and Accountability Act of 2014,

Intern Spotlight: Eugene Kim
Eugene joins our Grand Strand District Office from Washington,
DC where he attends Georgetown University.
Eugene is a
sophomore, majoring in International Economics.
During his freshman year,
he was a rower on the Georgetown crew team and actively involved with
the Political Awareness Committee in the Asian American Student
Association (AASA); Campus Outreach, which is an on-campus, Christian
ministry; and Corpus Collective, a spoken word club.
While interning
in our office, Eugene enjoyed hearing constituents comments and
seeing Congress act on them, as in the case of the VA, which he says is an
experience that he is sure to remember.
After graduation,
he plans on serving in the Korean military for two years and then
continuing his education in Theology or International Development.
Have a good
week and I hope to see you at an upcoming district event,
