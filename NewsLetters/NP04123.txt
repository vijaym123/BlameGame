Dear Constituents,
This
holiday season looks to be to be one of the busiest in years, which
is great news for our ongoing economic recovery. For many of our
residents, Black Friday presents great opportunities to save on a wide range
of popular items. It can also be an overwhelming experience due to
the number of shoppers. To make the most of Thanksgiving shopping, I
would like to suggest a few tips for safe and productive
shopping.
1. Make a shopping list ahead of time.
This
simple strategy can help you save money and plan your spending
strategically. There are lots of great deals to find, but planning ahead can
help you focus on the items you need. A list can also help you keep
track of your spending and getting in and out of stores
quickly.
2. Shop Safely.
Shoppers arent the only people
who see Black Friday as an opportunity to grab great deals. While you
might think that youre safe from harm please remember that pick
pockets view the Thanksgiving shopping season as an opportunity to prey on
vulnerable members of our community. Remember to shop with a friend and
be careful in large crowds. Lastly, please remember to stay hydrated
Thanksgiving temperatures in our desert can still reach the
mid-80s.
What are your favorite parts

Black Friday isnt
your only choice for Thanksgiving shopping. If youre interested in
supporting job growth right here in our local community you should look
into Small Business Saturday. Small businesses, particularly here in
the desert are a huge part of what makes our community strong; in Palm
Springs alone, 90% of businesses are owned and operated by members of
our community.
This year, I am proud to support a bill
which would recognize November 29th, 2014, as Small Business Saturday
increasing awareness of the value of locally owned businesses, and
encouraging consumers to shop locally and support jobs that will stay here
in the desert.
Lets work to make Black Friday and Small
Business Saturday a success for our local economy this week. As your
Representative and advocate, my door is always open. If you have any
questions please contact any of my offices; my staff is waiting to help
you.
Have a wonderful holiday giving thanks with
family and friends!
Sincerely,
Raul
Ruiz, M.D.

District
