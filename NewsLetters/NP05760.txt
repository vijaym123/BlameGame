You&rsquo;re probably pretty sick of our emails right now. Sorry about that.
But there&rsquo;s a reason we&rsquo;ve been bombarding your inbox. Right now, we&rsquo;re in danger of missing our goal, and worse -- getting outraised.
We have 72 hours until Allen West&rsquo;s Tea Party fundraiser and we&rsquo;re still coming up $8,602 short of our goal. Our credibility depends on our ability to put up a big showing.
So, I&rsquo;m asking you, David. Will you make a small donation before the big event? It would mean so much to me.
