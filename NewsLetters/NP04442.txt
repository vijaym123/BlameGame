Friends,
Another day, another update - the Registrar of Voters has announced that we are maintaining our lead, holding steady at 697 votes ahead of Doug Ose.
The race is still incredibly close, and there are thousands of ballots left to count.
We feel confident that we will win this thing, but we have to be prepared for whatever course of action Ose&#39;s team decides to take - there&#39;s a possibility that they&#39;re going to try to draw this process out as long as possible.
Our current on-the-ground team is doing GREAT work to ensure all legal ballots are counted - and we need to keep them there as long as it takes. Please click below and give what you can immediately.
