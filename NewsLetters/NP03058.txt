ABSOLUTE LAST CHANCE TO RENEW YOUR MEMBERSHIP AND HAVE YOUR GIFT MATCHED!
Do it now &gt;&gt;
Friend -- We&rsquo;re at a terribly critical moment. PLEASE read this email start to finish:
The Koch brothers are firing up their right-wing money machine to elect an ultra-conservative extremist like Rand Paul, Jeb Bush, or Ted Cruz. It&rsquo;s
disgusting.
Meanwhile, the super-critical first FEC deadline of 2015 hits in only 6 hours! If the Democratic base doesn&rsquo;t respond BY MIDNIGHT, Republicans could gain an insurmountable fundraising lead.
Our chance to take the White House and Senate would be
over.
It&rsquo;s simple: If you renew your DSCC membership today, we&rsquo;ll be able to compete and win. But if you don&rsquo;t, the GOP will take the White House AND Congress.
Friend, this is so important that we&rsquo;re MATCHING all gifts. Will you renew before the FEC deadline in 6 hours?
