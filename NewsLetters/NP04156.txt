The 6th District
A Path Forward in
Afghanistan
Dear Friends:
No doubt, Ive been very pessimistic about our nations
role in Afghanistan.
Having just returned from a Congressional
Delegation visit to the country, however, I can see some reasons to have
hope for a better future for the country and for U.S. national
security interest in the region.
It is easy for me to make the case that the United States
was wrong to go into Afghanistan to conduct a major nation-building
operation after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
But at this point, we
are there and, for me, that is a debate better left to historians
given that the decision to go into Afghanistan was made long before I was
elected to serve in Congress.
The first note of optimism for Afghanistan was that
a democratically-elected peaceful transition of power just took
place.
Given the allegations of massive election fraud and the refusal
of the losing candidate to recognize the electoral outcome, I have to
hand it to our Secretary of State, John Kerry, for personally
negotiating an agreement between the two rival candidates that created a new
position in the government for the losing side and prevented the
country from fracturing.
Secondly, our six member Congressional delegation was meeting
with the new President of Afghanistan, Dr. Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, when
an aide abruptly entered the room with a note which Ghani promptly
opened and read.
He broke into a broad smile with an audible sigh
of relief and informed us that the Afghan parliament had just ratified
the Bilateral Assistance Agreement, with only five dissenting votes,
setting the stage for the implementation of a Status of Forces
Agreement.
The
failure to negotiate and ratify such an agreement in Iraq prompted the
Obama administration to abruptly pull all of our forces out in
2011.
This led to a loss of all U.S. influence and the Iraqi
government immediately reverted to their worst sectarian tendencies creating an
open invitation for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)
to seize the provinces dominated by the disaffected Sunni Arab
minority.
Lastly, the
Obama administrations position to pull out most of our remaining
ground troops, by the end of the year, has been reversed along with an
extension of U.S. tactical air support for Afghan security forces into
2015.
Costly
mistakes have been made in Afghanistan from imposing a government that
we wanted them to have and not one that fit their political culture,
under to the Bush administration, to denying the minimum troop request
from the battlefield commander, during the surge, under the Obama
administration.
However, now we must look to 2015.
I can
report that I am more optimistic after having just been to
Afghanistan.
Sincerely,
Mike Coffman
U.S. Representative

A Message
from the U.S. House Small Business Committee, which I am a Member
of:
Small
Business Saturday
is a relatively new, but fast-growing,
tradition. Falling on the Saturday after Thanksgiving,
Small
Business Saturday
embraces that weekends already active shopping
trends with a focus on shopping locally and shopping small.
Small Business Saturday
follows Black Friday, the
busiest shopping day of the year. Since 2010, millions of Americans have
shown their support for small businesses on
Small Business
Saturday .
Importance of Small Business to the
Economy:
A small business is
generally described by the Small Business Administration (SBA) as an
independent company having fewer than 500 employees.
The United States has an estimated 28.2
million small businesses. (SBA)
Americas small businesses are the engines of job
creation. Small businesses employ nearly half (48.5%) of all private
sector employees and create more than half of the nonfarm private gross
domestic product. (SBA)
In general, 60 to 80% of all new jobs come from small businesses. This
number fluctuates year-by-year as some small companies grow enough to
become classified as large firms, and new businesses are created. In
total, small businesses have generated 63% of net new jobs over a
20-year period, 1993-2013. (SBA)
The so-called "gazelle" firms (ages three to five years)
comprise less than 1% of all companies, yet generate roughly 10% of new jobs
in any given year. The "average" firm in the top 1% of all companies
creates 88 jobs per year, and most end up with between 20 and 249
employees. (Kauffman Foundation)
Small businesses are innovators. They produce 16.5 times more
patents per employee than large firms.
(SBA)
From 1992 through 2010, small
businesses outperformed large firms in net job creation 75% of the
time,
according to the SBA Office of Advocacy's Small Business Economy 2011
report (released March
21, 2012).
