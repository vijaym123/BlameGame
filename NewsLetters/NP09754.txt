I wanted to share with you a
recent article
published on Forbes.com, discussing the work of two German economists to rate the worlds tax systems. Their
Tax Attractiveness Index
examined 100 countries from 2005-2009, and evaluated the countries tax environments, tax rates, tax planning opportunities, and more.
Where did the United States tax system fall in line? 94th out of 100
ranking below Zimbabwe, Pakistan, Egypt and Mexico.
The conclusion here is simple, and one that I have been advocating for years: its time to reform our tax code. Ive supported multiple common sense solutions, including fighting for an optional flat tax and working to reform the entire code, and I will continue the fight to reduce the heavy burden our current tax code places on the backs of small businesses, as well as American families and individuals.
Learn more about my work,
here .
Yours in service,
Randy
