Ensuring
Working Families Can Save for
College
Dear Friend,
As a well-educated, well-trained
workforce is essential to maintaining a
competitive economy, we need to ensure that
young adults have access to higher
education that provides them the necessary
tools to help build a stronger economy.
Yet, each year we see the costs of college
and other higher education options continue
to rise, leaving many families straining to
find ways to meet those costs. It is vital
that hardworking American families have
access to financial planning programs that
help them prepare for the rapidly rising
costs of college.
Virginia, along with almost every other
state throughout the country, offers
529
plans , which represent an innovative
way for families to plan for the costs of
their childrens higher education
over time. They allow families that invest
in their childrens
educational expenses to withdraw those
savings tax free, thus providing millions
of American families a useful tool to help
defray the cost of tuition and other
expenses.
During his State of the Union address,
President
Obama announced his plan
to tax college
savings when withdrawn from a 529 account.
This tax would remove a powerful incentive
for families to save for their
childrens higher education and
represents just one way in which the
Presidents proposed tax increase
would unfairly place new burdens on working
families. The American people spoke up, and
the President, who received pressure from
both sides of the aisle,
dropped
his plan
to tax 529 college saving
withdrawals. I am pleased President Obama
decided to listen to the American people
and withdraw his tax hike on college
savings. This tax would have hurt working
families already struggling to get ahead.
We should be looking for ways to make
college more affordable
not
less.
Last Congress, I introduced the
bipartisan
College
Savings Enhancement Act , which would
update current law to allow state-run
prepaid college savings plans, like
Virginias prepaid 529 plan, the
freedom to invest more broadly, enhancing
their ability to meet their obligations to
the families purchasing their plans. I plan
to reintroduce this bipartisan bill, and it
is my hope that the Senate and the
President will work with us to implement
this commonsense measure.
The House is also considering
legislation introduced by my colleagues
Congresswoman Lynn Jenkins (R-KS) and
Congressman Ron Kind (D-WI). They
introduced
H.R.
529
to modernize and improve tax-free
529 college savings plans. These are
exactly the types of bipartisan ideas we
should advance to help families save for
higher education.
Providing information and opportunities
for Fifth District families to save and
plan for higher education expenses are
critical to providing individuals the
ability to further their education, and I
look forward to pursuing new avenues to
ensure that families are able to invest in
their childrens futures.
