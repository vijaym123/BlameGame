Rubio, Lee Introduce New Pro-Family,
Pro-Growth Tax Reform Plan
In an op-ed for
The
Wall Street Journal
, Marco and Senator Lee introduced a
new tax reform plan to promote growth and
families. They discussed the plan in a
radio interview with
Michael
Medved . An excerpt of the interview
is below:
Senator Marco Rubio:
Well a couple things. First of
all, youre allowing
lets not forget that, and I think
Senator Lee just touched upon this a
moment ago when he talked about freedom,
at the gist of the higher tax regime is
the belief that you see coming
consistently from the left, and that is
we dont trust what people will do.
We dont trust what schools
theyll send their kids to, so we
have to tell them where to send them. We
dont trust that theyll make
their health care decisions, so we are
going to tell them what kind of insurance
they need to have. And we dont
trust what theyll do with their
money, so we need to tax you more so that
we can spend it on their behalf.
So just allowing people to
keep more money of what they earn is
important. The second aspect of it is
that when a lower-income worker gets a
raise, a significant part of
especially if that raise puts them over
a certain threshold
a
significant percentage of that
additional fund is now eaten up in a
higher marginal effective tax rate. So
weve got to address that as
well.
And last but not least, it
would work in conjunction with the
Earned Income Tax Credit program to
allow people to not only incentivize
work, but allow them to keep more of
their own money
so they can do
things like save for retirement, buy a
better health insurance plan of their
choice for their families, send their
kids to a better school, so that they
can have a better opportunity at life.
And in some instances, you know, pay
off debt as well
the sorts of
things that put family on a more stable
footing.

Rubio Comments On U.S. Airstrikes
Against ISIL In Syria
Marco issued the following statement
regarding the United States
airstrikes against the Islamic State of
Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terrorist
group in Syria:
I support the
Presidents actions to target
ISILs facilities in Syria. I
have argued for months that President
Obama has the authority to confront
this threat to the United States
wherever they seek refuge. Defeating
this menace to all who value freedom
and tolerance will not be easy, but is
essential to our security. My thoughts
and prayers are with our men and women
in uniform carrying out their duties as
part of ongoing operations in Iraq and
Syria.
ICYMI: Rubio Marks Contract
With America Anniversary,
Outlines Agenda To Restore American
Dream
In an op-ed for Newsmax, Marco marked
the anniversary of the Contract
with America, and outlined his
agenda to restore the American Dream in
the 21
st
century. An excerpt of
the
op-ed
is below:
These challenges are many and have
changed greatly since the time of the
Contract With America.
High-skilled jobs of the future have
replaced low-skilled jobs of the past.
Higher education is no longer an option
for some, it is a necessity for all.
Global competition requires us to
compete for investment and innovation.
And too many children are raised today
without the comforts of a stable
home.
Just as I did in the Florida House,
I have spent this year developing
dozens of ideas that would tackle these
challenges head on. On some, Ive
partnered with leaders from both
parties, such as Sens. Mike Lee (Utah),
Ron Wyden (Ore.), Chris Coons (Del.),
and Cory Booker (N.J.); and Reps. Paul
Ryan (Wis.) and Aaron Schock
(Ill.).
My proposals would make higher
education accessible to everyone, spur
the transformative innovation that can
create new industries and millions of
jobs, open America to the possibilities
and realities of our increasingly
globalized economy, save our crucial
retirement programs from
self-destruction, and encourage rather
than punish marriage and
parenthood.

Constituent Casework Corner
Jackie, a resident of South Florida,
contacted Senator Rubio's office on

Mexico following Hurricane Odile. She was
concerned for their safety and was trying
to secure information to pass along to
assist them with a safe return home. A
member of the staff contacted the State

information to alleviate her concerns.
Subsequently, her friends were safely
evacuated and returned to Florida.
