Do you think oil and gas companies must be held to higher standards
when their drilling activities take place on public lands as opposed to
drilling activities on private land?
Yes - It is critical for the protection of our public lands and the
safety of our communities
Maybe -These companies should only be regulated on public lands where
endangered species and sensitive habitats are present
No - These companies are already regulated enough

In mid-April, the Nigerian terrorist group Boko Haram kidnapped 329
female students from the Government Secondary School in the town of
Chibok in Borno State, Nigeria. Although 53 of the students later
escaped, 276 remain missing.
This week, I participated in a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing
on Boko Haram. I condemn the violent actions of Boko Haram in Nigeria,
and I oppose any organization or group that seeks to deny the
fundamental right of education to children worldwide and resorts to
such despicable tactics.
I support the ongoing U.S. government assistance to help the Nigerian
government bring these young girls home safely to their parents.
Long Beach Pride Parade
Every year for more than two decades I have been a proud participant in
the Long Beach Pride Parade. This year was no different. It was great
to see so many friends and celebrate love and equality with so many
people. I remain forever an ally and advocate for the LGBT community.

Day Services For Seniors
Last Thursday, May 15, I visited the Acacia Adult Day Services in
Garden Grove where I had a chance to tour the facility, learn about the
critical services it provides to our seniors and people living with
disabilities, and talk to the staff and individuals at the center.
Founded in 1976 by members of the local United Methodist Church, in
partnership with the City of Garden Grove, the Acacia Adult Day
Services opened its door with a grant from the Orange County Office on
Aging to serve the growing needs of seniors in the Garden Grove
community. The facility now serves more than 105 individuals per day,
and it provides a wide range of services to individuals based on needs
including transportation; nursing; personal care; social work; hot
meals; case management; socialization; as well as physical,
occupational, and speech therapies. This facility was a great example
of how county resources can go a long way!
Sound The Alarms For Climate Change
On Wednesday, I joined more than a dozen members of Congress in a
Capitol Hill rally to raise awareness to Congressional inaction on
climate change.
Please click here
or the picture above to watch my speech
The event, coordinated through the House of Representatives'
Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition (SEEC), was labeled the
"Time to Wake Up Congress to Climate Change" rally and featured
Congress members from SEEC, the Senate Climate Action Task Force, the
Bicameral Climate Change Task Force, and the House Safe Climate Caucus.
At the rally, speakers and audience members were asked to set their
cell phone alarm clocks for 5:00pm EST in a show of solidarity that it
is time for Congress to "wake up" to the scientific evidence of climate
change.
Protecting Our Nation's Wildlife Refuges
On Tuesday, I participated in a Natural Resources Subcommittee on
Fisheries, Wildlife, Oceans and Insular Affairs oversight hearing on
"Oil and Gas Activities within Our Nation's National Wildlife Refuge
System."
There are currently very few federal rules when it comes to drilling in
our national wildlife refuges. I believe we need to change that. Oil
and gas companies must be held to higher standards in their drilling
activities on our nation's wildlife refuges.
Please tell me what you think in this week's poll!
Iran's Nuclear Program
The United States is currently in negotiations with our P5+1 partners
and Iran over the fate of Tehran's illicit nuclear program.
I support
President Obama's effort to negotiate an agreement to end Iran's
nuclear weapons quest, and while I am hopeful that these efforts will
succeed, I also have concerns that the full goal may not be achieved.
This is why on Thursday I spoke on the House floor to insist that any
final agreement ensures that Tehran has no pathway to a nuclear weapon.
Please click here
or the picture above to watch my speech
As the initial six month period for negotiations comes to an end on
July 20, it is crucial for Congress to stand firm in our resolve to
prevent a nuclear armed Iran.
As the president and Secretary Kerry have repeatedly said, no deal is
better than a bad deal.
Any agreement must also include an inspection and verification system
that provides for anytime, anywhere inspections to ensure Iran is
complying with all of its agreements.
"The Cannon Tunnel"
There are many underground tunnels that connect the three congressional
offices to the U.S. Capitol Building. The tunnel that connects my
office building, the Cannon House Office Building, to the Capitol is
called the Cannon Tunnel.
This long tunnel is lined with artwork from students from across the
country who have earned first prize in their individual Congressional
district's annual Congressional Arts Competition, including the first
prize winning artwork from the 47th District's Congressional Art
Competition.
When Congress is in session, the tunnel is packed with constituents
taking tours, Members of Congress and their staff shuttling back and
forth between the Capitol and Cannon, and even members of the media
tracking the activities of the day.
Are hiring tax credits good for America's small businesses?
51.6%
Yes - They incentivize businesses to hire workers and grow our
economy
12.5%
Maybe - Not enough businesses know that hiring tax credits exist
20.3%
No - The cost of the tax credits will only add to our deficit
15.6%

There
are
currently
very
few
federal
rules
when
it
comes
to
drilling
in
our
national
wildlife
refuges.
I
believe
we
need
to
change
that.
Oil

Iran's

with
our
P5+1

Iran
over
the

of
Tehran&#8217;s

I
also

the

This
is
why
on
Thursday
I
spoke
on
the
House

insist
that
