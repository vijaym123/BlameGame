The Senate is currently considering my Trade
Promotion Authority
(TPA)legislationa tool that will
strengthen Congresss role in international
trade agreementsandensure that
American-made goods find their way to more
customers around the world. Passing this
critically important bill will create
morejobs and help grow our economy. While
President Obama and I often disagree, I am
grateful that he is supporting our bipartisan
effort to open up new markets and create more
opportunities for hard-working Americans.

Our efforts have received a
significantamount of
support ,
particularly back in Utah. Jim Webb, President of
the Utah Pork Producers Association, wrote an
op-ed in the
Salt
Lake Tribune highlighting the different
ways TPA will help farmers and agricultural
workers in Utah. Nigel Steward, Managing Director
of Rio Tinto Kennecott in South Jordan, also
wrote in the
Tribune
about how TPA will increase Utah exports,
allowing companies like histo sell more
products to customers around the worldand
create more jobs and opportunities at home.
Matthew Shay of the National Retail Federation
wrote in
Fox
News about how TPA will lead to lower
costs for American families and more jobs in
Utah, where trade already supports
64,000
Utah workers .
Here are a few facts about our trade
efforts.
TPA strengthens Congresss role while
constraining the President's.
TPA requires the President to submit any trade
agreement to the public months before its
voted on or passed. The Presidents
authority is constrained while Congresss
role is increased. (Read more:

Trade helps Americans.
Ninety-eight percent of U.S. exporting
companies are small- and medium-sized businesses
with fewer than 500 employees. In Utah, 80% of
the businesses that export have fewer than 500
employees. These are the companies and employees
that will feel the most benefit. TPA is about
lowering trade barriers to help all exporting
companies sell their products to a larger market
of customers around the world. Additionally, the
White House released a report suggesting that
trade boosts the purchasing power of low-income
Americans by over 60% by giving them access to
less-expensive goods. (Read more:

TPA is a publicly available bill for all to
see.
TPA is a publicly available bill, and the
negotiations have been transparent.
TheTrans-Pacific Partnership (TPP),
however, is not yet publicly available because
the terms of the trade agreement are still being
negotiated. TPA will actually REQUIRE that the
final text of TPP is posted publicly online
before Congress votes on it. Should the President
ignore Congresss input, Congress can
reject the final legislation implementing the
agreement. (Read more:

Trade deals are
not
being rushed throughwithout
the American peoples approval.
If TPA were enacted today, the earliest
possible vote for TPP or any other trade
agreement would be in mid-December under the new
consultation timeline and public review
requirements. (Read more:

Promotion Authority: Frequently Asked
Questions )
TPA doesn't allow the President to change
immigration policy.
TPA has absolutely nothing to do with
immigration law. There are no immigration
provisions being considered with TPA, and TPA
explicitly states that it will not require
changes in any partys immigration laws or
procedures. U.S. Trade Representative
MichaelFromanhas made clear:
The United States is not negotiating and
will not agree to anything in TPP (Trans-Pacific
Partnership) that would require any modification
to U.S. Immigration law or policy or any changes
to the U.S. Visa system. (Read more:

No,
TPA has nothing to do with the Presidents
Immigration Agenda )
TPA doesn't affect our gun
rights.
The United States is not negotiating any
changes to U.S. gun laws in any trade agreements.
This suggestion is baseless. Transparency
safeguards will ensure that rights, such as those
protected in the Second Amendment, are not
infringed. (Read more:
