In 1863, President Lincoln
declared
a national day of thanksgiving, recounting the blessing bestowed upon this nation even during hard times.
This week, we invite constituents to share their reflections on what they are grateful for on our Facebook page, in their own words.
Question of the Week:
This week, as we reflect on all that we have to be thankful for, what are the things about our nation that make you the most grateful?
