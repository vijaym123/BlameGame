Dear Friend,
With five full years of unlimited corporate spending under our belts, even
Citizens United &rsquo;s supporters can&rsquo;t hide from the facts. A government designed around checks and balances has been captured by campaign checks and bank balances. We can&rsquo;t let this decision stick around for another five years. Citizens United
is enabling corporations and big-money donors to drown out the voices of middle class families. This decision must be overturned -- sign our petition and help us end
Citizens United.
In the five years since
Citizens United , we&rsquo;ve seen more outside spending by fewer people than at any point in recent history. And that money has paid for thousands of misleading, negative political ads. The basic logic of
Citizens United
-- that money is speech -- is flawed.
Campaign finance laws don&rsquo;t restrict free speech, they allow it. Free speech isn&rsquo;t free when you have to pay millions of dollars to be heard. Overturning
Citizens United
won&rsquo;t be easy. That&rsquo;s why I need your help to make Washington listen. Add your name to mine and demand an end to
Citizens United .
Thank you.
