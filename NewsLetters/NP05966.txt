The Scalise Capitol Report
September 29,
2014
Louisiana is our nations Sportsmans
Paradise
This past weekend, our nation celebrated National
Hunting and Fishing Day. Louisiana sportsmen are crucial to both our state
and national economies
generating $1.67 billion in economic
activity and creating more than 13,200 jobs in Louisiana annually. As a proud
hunter and fisherman, I love the unique culture and way of life we
have here in Louisiana, and will continue fighting for legislation that
protects and preserves our values, so we can remain our nations
Sportsmens Paradise.
American energy creates
jobs
Nuclear energy is a jobs engine and contributes to our energy
security. But a stable and consistent regulatory environment is
essential to preserve the vitality of nuclear energy. Last week I had the
opportunity to discuss the importance of nuclear energy and share how
Im fighting for an all-of-the-above energy strategy at the Nuclear
Energy Institute (NEI) national conference in New Orleans.
Sending the Army Corps MCM reform
recommendations
I joined with the entire Louisiana Congressional delegation
last week in sending
this letter
to the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers regarding the unrealistic wetland mitigation
regulation known as the Modified Charleston Method (MCM). Radical
environmental regulations developed by unelected bureaucrats at the Corps of
Engineers threaten communities throughout southeast Louisiana and
increase the cost of critical hurricane protection projects. The Corps of
Engineers needs to work with the Louisiana Congressional delegation to
create a plan that keeps Louisiana families and economic development
in mind when they are establishing new regulations and policies. We
all know that wetland mitigation is crucial to the survival of southeast
Louisiana, but mitigation policies need to be realistic and should
not be mutually exclusive to economic development. The Corps must be
aware of the impact its regulations have on Louisiana communities and
need to work with elected leaders to ensure that they are brought forward
responsibly and with
accountability.
This president is anything but
transparent
President Obama promised to be the most transparent president
ever, yet he refuses to lay out a clear strategy with regards to the
issues that are facing our nation, such as the current border crisis.
He recently claimed he will wait until after the upcoming November
elections before he carries out a go-it-alone executive action on
immigration. The American people deserve to see his response to this border
crisis before the midterm elections.

as House Republican-passed solutions that solve the border crisis,
