Dear
David,
As families in Missouri and nationwide mark National Mental
Health Awareness Month, I'm fighting to ensure all Americans have access to
quality behavioral health treatments. We must start treating mental
illness like any other physical illness.
We were reminded of
this important challenge last month at
Fort
Hood . In the wake of this tragedy, I'm talking with
military leaders in Missouri
and in
Washington
to
guarantee our servicemen and women, veterans, and military families
have access to quality behavioral health treatment - before a mental
health crisis takes a terrible turn for the worst.
As part of
these efforts, I introduced the
"Caring for America's
Heroes Act"
last week to bring mental health treatment for
military retirees and families in-line with the way physical injuries are
treated under TRICARE. This is a common-sense step forward as we work to
reduce the stigma surrounding behavioral health
challenges.
I also joined my colleague Senator Stabenow to successfully
pass a version of the
"Excellence in Mental Health
Act"
last month to help address the nation's fragmented mental health
system.
I hope you'll visit my
website
to learn more about my efforts to improve behavioral
health treatment, and join the conversation online on my
Facebook , on
Twitter , or on
Instagram .
Sincere regards,
Washington D.C. Office
