Highlights Issues Ready for Committee Action
Republican Leadership Stresses Importance of Legislating Under Regular
Order
At the start of the 114th Congress, incoming Senate Majority
Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) renewed his commitment to restoring
regular order in the U.S. Senate.
In his opening floor remarks, he
reminded colleagues from both political parties that Americans sent a
clear message last November.
He said, "They asked for a
government that works."
One of the first
steps toward achieving that goal is to legislate through the committee
process, where panels with jurisdiction and expertise can thoroughly
and publicly debate bills under consideration.
In this way,
lawmakers can scrutinize measures and work to resolve differences before
legislation comes to the Senate floor.
Over the past few years,
major bills have been forged in backroom deals with no opportunity for
amendments or open deliberation.
Regular order would replace
political expediency with stability and
consensus.
My committee work covers a diverse range of
issues, from the preparedness of our troops to the impact of the Obama
Administration's extreme environmental agenda.
During this Congress,
I look forward to serving as chairman of both the Armed Services
Subcommittee on Seapower and the Commerce Subcommittee on Communications,
Technology, Innovation, and the Internet.
In a recent floor
speech, I outlined a few of my priorities for these subcommittees, as well
as issues ripe for committee oversight.
They
include:
Ensuring our sailors and Marines have the
resources they need.
With emerging threats around the globe
and the smallest U.S. Navy since World War I, strategic investments in
seapower are critical to America's ability to project power and respond
to complex contingencies.
The Subcommittee on Seapower plays a
vital role in crafting a Defense Authorization Bill that meets
national security requirements and provides strong support for our Navy and
Marine Corps.
Encouraging
broadband growth and development.
The Internet serves as a
powerful economic engine for communities in Mississippi and around
the country. The Communications Subcommittee will continue to advance
ways to promote the deployment and adoption of quality broadband,
particularly in rural America.
Reining
in costly executive overreach.
As a member of the
Environment and Public Works Committee, I am directly involved in
congressional oversight of the Environmental Protection Agency, which has
proposed a litany of inflated rules and regulations.
The committee
will serve as a forum for challenging these controversial power grabs and
the financial burdens they put on the American people with limited
and at times, dubious
claims of environmental
benefit.
Enacting a budget resolution.
By
law, each house of Congress is required to enact an annual budget
resolution.
Over the past five years, however, the Democrat-led
Senate passed a budget only once.
As a member of the Budget
Committee, I look forward to producing a budget resolution that deals in a
serious way with out-of-control federal spending.
With the debt
now greater than $18 trillion, interest payments are set to become the
fasting-growing budget expenditure.
A
reinvigorated role for committees in the legislative process will go a long
way toward fixing the dysfunction that has exemplified Senate activity
in recent years.
I am encouraged by the discussions at the
outset of the 114th Congress to work on sensible, bipartisan legislative
items that have the potential to receive the President's acceptance.
I hope these discussions will continue to fuel practical solutions
to the urgent issues of our day.
