Dear Friend,
Im
incredibly proud to let you know that TODAY President Obama signed
the
Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act
into law.
This law, which I introduced on the one-year anniversary
of Sandy, is a tremendous victory for thousands of New Jersey
homeowners who were facing skyrocketing flood insurance costs even as they
continued to recover from the worst natural disaster in our states
history.
About a year ago I began
hearing from people like you, some who came to me in tears, expressing
horror stories of skyrocketing flood insurance premiums that threatened to
force them from their homes.
The more I listened, the more I
was convinced that something needed to be done and done quickly.
Armed with your stories, I fought hard to convince my colleagues, on
both sides of the aisle, that even in an era of partisan gridlock, we
can and must come together to do right by the hardworking homeowners who
need our help.
Heres what this law will
do:
Creates a Firewall on Annual Rate
Increases
FEMA cant raise average rates for a class of properties above
15% and cant raise rates on individual policies above 18% per year
for virtually all properties.
Repeals
the Property Sales Trigger
Homeowners will no longer have to
pay the full-risk rate for pre-FIRM properties at the time of
purchase.
This provision caused property values to drop, making many
homes unsellable. Under the new law, homebuyers will receive the same
treatment as the home seller.
Repeals the
New Policy Sales Trigger
Pre-FIRM property owners will no
longer be required to pay the full-risk rate if they voluntarily purchase
a new policy.
This law allows owners to voluntarily purchase a
policy under pre-FIRM conditions.
Reinstates Grandfathering
Without grandfathering, property owners
mapped into higher risk would have to either elevate their structure
or have higher rates phased in over 5 years.
The new law allows
grandfathering and sets hard caps on how high premiums can increase
annually.
Refunds Homeowners who
Overpaid
Requires FEMA to refund policyholders for overpaid
premiums.
Affordability goal
Requires FEMA to
minimize the number of policies with annual premiums that exceed one
percent of the total coverage provided by the policy.
It also
establishes a Flood Insurance Advocate within FEMA to answer questions
about the flood mapping process and insurance rates and requires FEMA
to justify that the mapping model it plans to use to create a
communitys new flood map makes sense.
As
our State continues down the path to recovery,
Ill continue to
work with Federal and State officials, as well as with my colleagues
in Washington, to find solutions to the challenges our families and
communities face.
Again, thank you for bringing this issue to my
attention and for your support in bringing this bill over the finish
line.
Sincerely,
Robert Menendez
United
States Senator
