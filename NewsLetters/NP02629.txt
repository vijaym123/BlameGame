Dear
Friend,
Every year, thousands of seniors are taken
advantage of by predatory scammers. I invite you to join my staff as well as
representatives from the Social Security Administration, the Federal
Trade Commission, and AARP to discuss the issue of senior fraud and
ways to identify and combat potential
scams.
Forums will be held at Alden of Waterford in Aurora from 10:00
am until 11:15 am and at Heritage Woods of Bolingbrook from 2:00 pm
until 3:15 on Monday, February 23,
2015.

RSVP, please visit

email or tell your friends and family to
