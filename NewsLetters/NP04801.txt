Friend -- I&rsquo;ve emailed you an awful lot in this election.
But this is the last time I&rsquo;ll ask for your help.
Take a moment to read our final Election Day update:
As polls open across the country,
SIX races are within two points.
If Democrats win three of those,
we protect the Senate.
We are in a strong position to win -- but we must send every last cent we can to tied battlegrounds to Get Out The Vote.
We&rsquo;re sending last-minute money to deadlocked battlegrounds at noon. All gifts will be triple-matched -- will you pitch in before then?
If you&rsquo;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Pitch in $3 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $8 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $17 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $25 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Pitch in $35 IMMEDIATELY &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount.
Tonight, you could find out that Mitch McConnell is GONE and that Democrats have held the Senate.
Please -- pitch in right away to make it happen.
Thank you so much for all your help,
Harry Reid
Senate Majority Leader
