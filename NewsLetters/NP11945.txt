David -- If this is true, we&rsquo;ve got a lot of work to do. Former Congressman Bobby Schilling has pledged to raise $2 million in his race against Cheri for Illinois&rsquo; 17th district.
Schilling was kicked out of Congress in 2012 because of his unyielding support for the Tea Party agenda. Now he thinks if he just calls himself a moderate and backs it up with a bunch of cash he can win this November.
But we see his true colors. Ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling is the same Tea Party extremist now that he was in 2012. 24 HOURS TO GO:
Will you donate $3 or more right now to support Cheri before tomorrow night&rsquo;s midnight deadline?
Cheri was successful in 2012 because grassroots supporters like you helped her fight back against each and every attack. If we want her to be successful this time around, we&rsquo;ve got to have her back.
Will you chip in $3 or whatever you can before midnight tomorrow? http://action.cheribustos.com/24-Hours
Let's go!
