Senator Shaheen visits TadePort USA in Somersworth to discuss
negative impact of online sales tax legislation)
Dear
Friend,
As a matter of common sense, New Hampshire businesses
shouldnt have to collect sales taxes for Illinois, Florida, or any
other state. But in Washington, some politicians are trying to force that
kind of misguided legislation upon our economy. For years, Ive fought
efforts like this that threaten our small businesses with unnecessary
red tape, and this fight was renewed last week when I again announced
my opposition to the so-called Marketplace Fairness
Act.
This bill would impose significant new tax
compliance burdens on entrepreneurs in New Hampshire that are trying to
grow their businesses and create jobs. Our state doesn't have a sales
tax, so our businesses arent equipped to collect one. Thats why
businesses are concerned, because if this bill passes, they will suddenly
be forced to collect sales taxes for 46 other states and 9,600 taxing
jurisdictions across the country.
On Monday, I had the
opportunity to visit TradePort USA in Somersworth - a great company that
does most of its business online
to discuss the negative impact an
online tax would have on their sales. TradePort leadership agreed, that
onerous regulations and unnecessary red tape would hurt their projected
growth and impose burdensome costs. This is a scenario that we would
see played out over and over again across our
state.
E-Commerce has been a real boon to small businesses in New Hampshire and
across the country we cant let this be threatened. Ill continue to
fight this misguided online sales tax proposal, as I have in the past, and
continuing working to protect our economy.
As always, I'm
incredibly proud to represent the Granite State and I look forward to
hearing from you
soon.
Sincerely,
Jeanne
Shaheen
