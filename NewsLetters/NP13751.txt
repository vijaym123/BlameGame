President Obama's broken promises on the House Floor.
Dear Friends,
As your member of Congress, I remain committed to being an effective
voice for your needs in the Nation's capital. That's why I've been so
personally touched by the stories you've told me regarding Obamacare's
impact on your lives.
When the President explained Obamacare to the American people, he said
you could keep your healthcare coverage if you liked it. He said
premiums would go down and the quality of care would go up. Sadly,
these were broken promises.
Too many of you have stood in line at public events to hand me copies
of your cancellation notices. Too many of you have emailed or called my
office to discuss the dramatic increases in your premiums or
deductibles.
Altogether, 100,000 Hoosiers and more than 4 million Americans have
already seen their policies cancelled because of this law. Hundreds of
millions of taxpayer dollars have been spent on a website that still
doesn't function properly. Americans have a right to expect more from
their government. They have a right to expect more from their
President.
Rest assured, I believe we need healthcare reforms that increase access
to quality care and lower medical costs. But these reforms must be
thoroughly vetted and carefully implemented. They must also reflect a
commitment to patient-centered care and medical innovation. Obamacare
does not meet any of these standards.
Below, you'll find a few of the stories Hoosiers have shared with me
over the last few months. To share yours, click here.
Thanks for reading, and please feel free
to be in touch if you have any questions or suggestions.
Sincerely,
Susan W. Brooks

#ShareWithSusan - Obamacare
"For the first time since I scrubbed floors at night at Walmart and
later cleaned houses while going to school for 4 full years, I couldn't
support myself if I weren't married, thanks to the pending
implementation of Obamacare. I will now lose almost 40 percent of my
pay, while working the same hours. I'm luckier than most. My boss is
gone and many co-workers are gone." - Karen, Anderson
"All of the options out there are less coverage than I have now and
about $1000 per month, an increase of over $200. For a single mother
trying to put her child through college that is a lot. What do I cut?
My daughter's education? Medical coverage? A place to live? Food? If I
had more time to make an informed decision I might not be so angry." -
Barbara, Indianapolis
"My insurance plan that I was happy with has been cancelled courtesy of
The ACA. Now, from what I can tell, the cheapest insurance I viewed on
the exchange is going to cost me roughly 60-70% more.I'd like to keep
the extra $80-$100 (minimum) a month I'm being forced to waste, and put
it towards something I actually want and am going to use." Lauren,

Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act
In July, I visited Indiana University's Riley Hospital for Children to
highlight the Kids First Research Act, a bipartisan piece of
legislation aiming to provide new levels of support for potentially
groundbreaking pediatric research. The bill ends taxpayer funding of
presidential campaigns and conventions and instead redirects $130
million in already collected funds to assist research projects focusing
on autism, childhood cancer and other devastating diseases. I was proud
to be joined by representatives and families from the Leukemia and
Lymphoma Society and Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation to support
this important effort.
Recently, the bill was renamed the "Gabriella Miller Kids First
Research Act" in honor of a brave and inspirational young lady who left
us too soon. You can learn more about Gabriella's story by watching
this video
, which I hope you will share on
your own social media accounts. Gabriella's story is one that should be
heard. To become a citizen cosponsor of this legislation, click here

and make a true difference in the lives of our youth.
Rep. Brooks meets with Frankton Jr./Sr. High School 8th grade students.
District Highlights
Frankton Jr./Sr. High School: In October, I was delighted to lead
students from Frankton's 8th grade class on a tour of the U.S. Capitol.
Due to the government shutdown, their tour would have been cancelled if
a member of Congress was unable to personally lead them through the
building. When I met these same kids in the school gymnasium about one
month later, they were kind enough to give me a framed photo collage
that recapped their big trip. I'm proud to say their generous gift will
now be displayed in my Washington, D.C. office. In total, I was able to
lead four school groups through the Capitol during the October
shutdown. I'm so glad my staff and I were able to make sure our
students didn't lose the opportunity to see such an important piece of
our history.
Veterans Listening Session at the Flagship Center in Anderson: On
November 4, I hosted a Veteran's Listening Session that brought
together representatives from local, state and non-profit service
organizations to discuss ways we can better serve our Hoosier military
heroes. Topics discussed included the current unacceptable claims
backlog at the Department of Veterans Affairs, medical care for former
service members and ways we can improve job opportunities for returning
veterans. I'm currently a cosponsor of House Resolution 2189, which
requires the VA to put in place accelerated plans to end the claims
backlog by 2015. I've also written to President Obama urging him to
make this issue a priority. We must keep our promises to those who've
sacrificed so much to defend our freedom.
Holiday Events: I was honored to speak at the Annual Hasten Hebrew
Academy Chanukah Dinner in Indianapolis on Sunday, November 17.
I also
helped light the Anderson Christmas Tree with Mayor Kevin Smith at his
city's annual celebration on Friday, November 22. It's always great to
celebrate these special occasions with my fellow Hoosiers!

Dear

As

I

That&#8217;s

Rep.
Brooks
meets
with
Frankton
Jr./Sr.
High
School
8th
grade
students.
District
Highlights
Frankton
Jr./Sr.
High
School :
In
October,
I
was
delighted
to
lead
students
from
Frankton&#8217;s
8 th
grade
class
on
a
tour
of
the
U.S.
Capitol.
Due
to
the
government
shutdown,
their
tour
would
have
been
cancelled
if
a
member
of
Congress
was
unable
to
personally
lead
them
through
the
building.
When
I
met
these
same
kids
in
the
school
gymnasium
about
one
month
later,
they
were
kind
enough
to
give
me
a
framed
photo
collage
that
recapped
their
big
trip.
I&#8217;m
proud
to
say
their
generous
gift
will
now
be
displayed
in
my
Washington,
D.C.
office.
In
total,
I
was
able
to
lead
four
school
groups
through
the
Capitol
during
the
October
shutdown.
I'm
so
glad
my
staff
and
I
were
able
to
make
sure
our
students didn't
lose
the
opportunity to
see
such
an
important
piece
of
our
history.
