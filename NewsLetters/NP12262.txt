Dear Friend,
This week, the Obama Administration announced yet another delay in the
Obamacare employer mandate, giving medium-sized businesses with between
50 and 99 employees until 2016 to comply with the President's health
care law. The law as it pertains to these businesses was originally
scheduled to take effect in January of this year but was delayed after
business groups expressed concerns that unresolved issues about the
law's rules and regulations would cause havoc throughout the country.
This delay is further proof that the new health care law was not ready
for launch and should, at the very least, be delayed until those
responsible for implementation are fully prepared to move forward with
this massive overhaul of our health care system. Sadly, while the Obama
Administration grants this extension to businesses, it has still failed
to delay the law's mandates for individual Americans and their families.
I remain committed to repealing this onerous health care law and
replacing it with a better health care proposal that guarantees all
Americans access to affordable, quality coverage they want to purchase.
This winter has been a rough one for Missourians - hitting propane
users very hard due to shortages and rising prices that have shot
through the roof. This shortage has been caused by a number of factors.
They include a 35 percent increase in domestic propane use due to the
extreme cold temperatures we have had to endure, higher than normal use
of propane to dry last fall's crops, and the shutdown of a major
pipeline to the northern Midwest during the month of December.
I support a number of ideas to address the situation in the short run,
including a recent decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) to temporarily prioritize the shipment of propane through
existing pipelines to assist customers in the Midwest and Northeast who
need it most. I urge FERC to extend this emergency order for the
balance of the home heating season.
I am also encouraging removal of restrictions to allow more propane to
be transported into Missouri to drive down prices. The long term
solution, however, is to increase pipeline infrastructure and domestic
energy production to ensure that this crisis situation does not repeat
itself in the future. Missouri's propane users are hurting and I am
committed to finding a permanent solution to this problem.
Finally, the House voted this week to raise the debt ceiling. Sadly,
the proposal did nothing to deal with the reason the debt ceiling had
to be increased: the overspending in Washington. For this reason I
could not support it. It would be irresponsible to continue the cycle
of spending while jeopardizing our children's future. When the good
people of Missouri's Fourth Congressional District sent me to
Washington with the honor of representing them, I pledged to work for
the common sense goals that include requiring the government to live
within its means, just as families in our district must do. I remain
committed to that pledge and that worthy goal. The financial future of
our country depends on it.
Have a great week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
This
week,
the
Obama
Administration
announced
yet
another
delay
in
the
Obamacare
employer
mandate,
giving
medium-sized
businesses
with
between
50
and
99
employees
until
2016
to
comply
with
the
President&#8217;s
health
care
law.
The
law
as
it
pertains
to
these
businesses
was
originally
scheduled
to
take
effect
in
January
of
this
year
but
was
delayed
after
business
groups
expressed
concerns
that
unresolved
issues
about
the
law&#8217;s
rules
and
regulations
would
cause
havoc
throughout
the
country.
This
delay
is
further
proof
that
the
new
health
care
law
was
not
ready
for
launch
and
should,
at
the
very
least,
be
delayed
until
those
responsible
for
implementation
are
fully
prepared
to
move
forward
with
this
massive
overhaul
of
our
health
care
system.
Sadly,
while
the
Obama
Administration
grants
this
extension
to
businesses,
it
has
still
failed
to
delay
the
law&#8217;s
mandates
for
individual
Americans
and
their
families.
I
remain
committed
to
repealing
this
onerous
health
care
law
and
replacing
it
with
a
better
health
care
proposal
that
guarantees
all
Americans
access
to
affordable,
quality
coverage
they
want
to
purchase.
This
winter
has
been
a
rough
one
for
Missourians
&#8211;
hitting
propane
users
very
hard
due
to
shortages
and
rising
prices
that
have
shot
through
the
roof.
This
shortage
has
been
caused
by
a
number
of
factors.
They
include
a
35
percent
increase
in
domestic
propane
use
due
to
the
extreme
cold
temperatures
we
have
had
to
endure,
higher
than
normal
use
of
propane
to
dry
last
fall&#8217;s
crops,
and
the
shutdown
of
a
major
pipeline
to
the
northern
Midwest
during
the
month
of
December.
I
support
a
number
of
ideas
to
address
the
situation
in
the
short
run,
including
a
recent
decision
by
the
Federal
Energy
Regulatory
Commission
(FERC)
to
temporarily
prioritize
the
shipment
of
propane
through
existing
pipelines
to
assist
customers
in
the
Midwest
and
Northeast
who
need
it
most.
I
urge
FERC
to
extend
this
emergency
order
for
the
balance
of
the
home
heating
season.
I
am
also
encouraging
removal
of
restrictions
to
allow
more
propane
to
be
transported
into
Missouri
to
drive
down
prices.
The
long
term
solution,
however,
is
to
increase
pipeline
infrastructure
and
domestic
energy
production
to
ensure
that
this
crisis
situation
does
not
repeat
itself
in
the
future.
Missouri&#8217;s
propane
users
are
hurting
and
I
am
committed
to
finding
a
permanent
solution
to
this
problem.
Finally,
the
House
voted
this
week
to
raise
the
debt
ceiling.
Sadly,
the
proposal
did
nothing
to
deal
with
the
reason
the
debt
ceiling
had
to
be
increased:
the
overspending
in
Washington.
For
this
reason
I
could
not
support
it.
It
would
be
irresponsible
to
continue
the
cycle
of
spending
while
jeopardizing
our
children&#8217;s
future.
When
the
good
people
of
Missouri&#8217;s
Fourth
Congressional
District
sent
me
to
Washington
with
the
honor
of
representing
them,
I
pledged
to
work
for
the
common
sense
goals
that
include
requiring
the
government
to
live
within
its
means,
just
as
families
in
our
district
must
do.
I
remain
committed
to
that
pledge
and
that
worthy
goal.
The
financial
future
of
our
country
depends
on
it.
Have
a
great
week.

Vicky
