Dear Friends,
Earlier this week, the President spoke to the Nation from the Rose Garden of the White House about the framework for a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action regarding Irans nuclear program. While I appreciate the Administrations efforts to promote peace in the region, I do not believe the current framework will accomplish our stated goal of a verifiably dismantled Iranian nuclear program.
The tentative agreement blindly puts faith in a regime that has never shown any reason for us to trust them. In return for scaling back their nuclear program, we are going to lift sanctions and effectively give a dangerous political foe an undeserved economic lifeline.
As I have said many times, Iran poses a significant threat to U.S. national security interests both home and abroad.
Iran is the greatest threat to security and peace to Israel and the entire Middle East. It is involved in the conflicts in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, and continues to support the terrorist groups known as Hamas and Hezbollah.
In the coming months, I am committed to working with my colleagues to make sure that any deal with Iran concerning the future of their nuclear program will be completed in a way that does not put the stability of the Middle East at risk and has the full support of our allies in the region.
Tell me what you think about the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action by commenting on my
Facebook page .
Sincerely,
Representative French Hill

After seeing the operations, Rep. Hill stated, "I was very impressed by the mutual effort by Mexican and American customs officials to facilitate billions of dollars in trade transiting the border by rail and truck -- while never loosing sight of the essential and complex task of blocking the illegal trade in people, money, guns and drugs."
