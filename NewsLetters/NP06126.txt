A Gross
Dereliction of Duty
On Thursday, I voted against the
Continuing Resolution that is a product of a dysfunctional law-making process.
This resolution tied the auhtorization for military intervention in
Syria to a bill to temporarily fund the entire government.
One of
the most important and solemn duties we have as members of Congress is
to authorize the use of military force and ask the brave men and
women in our armed services to put their lives in harms
way.
It is a gross dereliction of that duty
and an insult to those men
and women
to tack on a military authorization to a must-pass spending
bill, just so members of Congress can hurry back
home.
If the United States is going to escalate our involvement in a brutal
conflict overseas, if we are going to send American troops to arm and
train Syrian rebels for their fight against ISIS, we need to debate
that decision on its own merits, not as a condition of funding the
government. This is the only way for this issue to receive the careful
attention and robust debate that it deserves.
Prior to the vote,
I delivered a speech on the Senate Floor to recommend that we debate
the Syria and ISIS provisions separately from the government funding
provisions of the Continuing Resolution.
Unfortunately, my
request was denied.

On Wednesday, I also delivered a speech
about the many problems that result from using continuing resolutions
to fund the government.
I also recommend that you read this
speech when you can, so you can understand why I voted against this
proposal as your representative, and why I chose instead to fight for a
better way:

CR prevents Congress from doing its job here
