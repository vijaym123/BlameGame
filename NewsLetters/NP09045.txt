May Monthly
Recap
Dear Friend,
Communicating with the people of
Virginias 5th District and hearing
your feedback is very important to us. In
order to ensure that we keep you up to date
on what is going on from month to month, we
record a monthly video address. You may

Video Address Text
Hi, Im Robert Hurt. Thank
you for tuning into our Monthly Video
Address.
It is an honor to represent
Virginias Fifth District, and I
appreciate the opportunity to share with
you some of what we have been working on
during the month of May. Over the past
month, my colleagues and I have continued
our efforts to enact policies that will
provide more opportunities and a brighter
future for the American people.
This month, it was reported that
over
800,000
people dropped out of our labor force
in April -- reducing the labor force
participation rate to a 35-year low. Many
communities in the Fifth District continue
to experience unemployment rates well above
the national average, and our rate of
recovery from the economic downturn has
been weak. That is why the House of
Representatives has adopted dozens of
pro-growth proposals that would help
jumpstart our economy and get us back on
track. However, the President and the
Senate must join in our effort. It is my
hope that in the coming months we will be
able to find bipartisan common ground in
encouraging job opportunities for
Virginians and Americans, and I remain
committed to continuing to work toward this
crucial goal.
Also this month, I am pleased to
report that the House of Representatives
passed
legislation to establish a Select
Committee
to investigate the events
surrounding the September 11, 2012,
terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in
Benghazi. During ongoing congressional
investigations into this subject, we have
discovered that the Administration has not
been transparent with Congress and the
American people. It is critical that this
Select Committee focus on obtaining a
complete and objective picture of the
attacks that claimed the lives of four
Americans so we can ensure that this does
not happen again.
At the same time, we have
recently learned that the Department of
Veterans Affairs has provided service to
our veterans that has fallen miserably
short. To help address this issue, last
week the House of Representatives
passed
the Department of Veterans Affairs
Management Accountability Act
with a
strong bipartisan majority. This important
legislation allows for the removal of
ineffective and derelict senior level
officials at the VA that are contributing
to the mismanagement within the agency. It
is my sincere hope that this bill will
serve as an important step toward greater
care for our veterans by holding the VA
accountable for its actions and initiating
much needed reforms.
Finally, and most notably, we
observed Memorial Day to give thanks to all
of the brave men and women who have
sacrificed their lives while defending our
country. To all of those who are and have
been members of our armed forces
thank you for all that you have given up in
the name of American liberty. Your
sacrifice has allowed us to enjoy a way of
life which we often take for granted. With
these sacrifices in mind, our thoughts and
prayers are with all of those who have
served or are serving our nation and their
families.
Once again, I thank you for the
opportunity to represent the Fifth District
of Virginia in Congress, and I look forward
to continuing our work to promote a
brighter future for our children and
grandchildren. As we close, I encourage you
to sign up for updates at our website at
hurt.house.gov
and join the conversation on our social
media pages. Thank you for tuning in to our
monthly video address.
After speaking at the Altavista American
Legion Memorial Post 36 and Veterans of
Foreign Wars Post 4165 Memorial Day
Ceremony, Robert visited with American
Legion Commander Dean Jennings.
Robert met with 8th grade students from
the Charlottesville Waldorf School before
they toured the Capitol.
