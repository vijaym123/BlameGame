"We need to fix the dysfunctional political system and get unaccountable money out of it once and for all
-- even if that takes a constitutional amendment&rdquo; - Hillary Clinton
Hillary Clinton just announced she'll support a constitutional amendment taking on dark money. This is a HUGE DEAL.
We need 375,981 more signatures to get ONE MILLION Democrats demanding an end to Citizens United.

David -- How encouraging is this?! Hillary Clinton called for an END to dark money in politics. She laid it out as a top priority at her first campaign event in Iowa this week.
She is right -- our campaign finance system is broken. We can&rsquo;t let the Republicans or the Koch brothers buy any more elections. It&rsquo;s time to get their big money out of politics NOW and forever! Add your name: Demand Congress pass a Constitutional Amendment to overturn Citizens United!
David -- 624,019 people have signed on. Can you help us get to ONE MILLION supporters?
Thanks,
