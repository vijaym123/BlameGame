Friend
Wanted to be sure that you saw that the Mortgage Choice Act ( H.R. 685 ) was recently introduced its a bipartisan piece of legislation that would amend and clarify the definition of a qualified mortgage under the Dodd-Frank Act to promote access to affordable mortgage credit while maintaining strong consumer protections from bad loans.
I cosponsored this bill and supported it when it passed the House of Representatives in the 113 th
Congress by a bipartisan voice-vote.
I will keep you updated on its progress as it moves through the House in the 114 th
Congress.
Yours in service,
Randy
