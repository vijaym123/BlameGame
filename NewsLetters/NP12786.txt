Dear Friends,
This week the president delivered his annual State of the Union
Address. What we heard from him was more of the same failed policies
that have done nothing to jump start the economy nor create jobs.
I am
disappointed that after five years as president, he does not recognize
the pressing matters facing this country.
The speech was most notable
for what it didn't include. President Obama neglected to tell the
American people how he plans to bring the unemployment rate down or
reform out of control entitlement programs. He failed to address the
fatal flaws in ObamaCare or any plans to reduce our $17 trillion in
debt.
The president mentioned nothing about how he intends to secure
the border, instead focusing on his desire to offer amnesty for the
millions of illegal immigrants currently living here.
Instead of working with the House of Representatives to achieve
legislation that benefits the American people, the president threatened
to go it alone and will be issuing yet another executive order, this
one to increase wages for federal contractors. After five years in
office he has yet to develop a comprehensive energy policy that
prioritizes our domestic energy production.
This jeopardizes our
national security and with gas prices over $3.25 a gallon, it takes
money out of the pockets of hard working Americans.
I'll continue to
work with my Republican colleagues in the House of Representatives to
pass pro-growth, pro-security legislation and offer leadership on the
difficult challenges facing this nation.
I hope the president will
join us.
On Wednesday the House of Representatives passed the Agriculture Act of
2014, HR 2642,
also known as the Farm Bill. I supported this
legislation because it cuts mandatory federal spending by nearly $24
billion and represents the first major reform of the food stamp program
since 1996.
Most importantly, this legislation provides certainty to
Texas farmers and ranchers who are an important part of our nation's
economy.

Dear
Friends,
This
week
the
president
delivered
his
annual
State
of
the
Union
Address. What
we
heard
from
him
was
more
of
the
same
failed
policies
that
have
done
nothing
to
jump
start
the
economy
nor
create
jobs.
I
am
disappointed
that
after
five
years
as
president,
he
does
not
recognize
the
pressing
matters
facing
this
country.
The
speech
was
most
notable
for
what
it
didn&#8217;t
include.
President
Obama
neglected
to
tell
the
American
people
how
he
plans
to
bring
the
unemployment
rate
down
or
reform
out
of
control
entitlement
programs.
He
failed
to
address
the
fatal
flaws
in
ObamaCare
or
any
plans
to
reduce
our
$17
trillion
in
debt.
The
president
mentioned
nothing
about
how
he
intends
to
secure
the
border,
instead
focusing
on
his
desire
to
offer
amnesty
for
the
millions
of
illegal
immigrants
currently
living
here.
Instead
of
working
with
the
House
of
Representatives

that
benefits
the
American

the
president

After

he
has
yet
to
develop
a
comprehensive
energy

that
prioritizes
our
domestic
energy
production.
This

and
with
gas

over

a

it

of
the

Americans.
I&#8217;ll
