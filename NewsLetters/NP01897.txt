The Republican-controlled Congress is trying to run this country into the ground. They&rsquo;re putting Medicare and Social Security in jeopardy while providing tax breaks to the rich and no help whatsoever to working families. And the Koch brothers&rsquo; billions are behind them every step of the way.
We can sit here and let them do it -- or we can fight back.
On April 1, we start fighting back.
Our
Back to Blue project
will go into states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New Hampshire -- states that will be key to winning the White House and the Senate -- to build support for
a strong progressive agenda that includes raising the minimum wage and safeguarding Social Security and Medicare.
We&rsquo;ll hammer vulnerable Republican incumbents and
we&rsquo;ll
work to elect a Democratic Senate that will help the next Democratic president pass our agenda into law.
But we need to raise another $250,000 from grassroots supporters by the FEC deadline on March 31 to get Back to Blue off the ground. YOUR gift could make the difference -- will you please pitch in?
