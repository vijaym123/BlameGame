Friend -
I'm very concerned by the situation on our southern border. I know you are too. I want answers to these questions, but more than that, Americans have a
right
to the answers to these questions. You have a right to know how your tax dollars are being spent.
My questions for the Administration:
How much taxpayer money has been spent to feed, house, clothe, and supervise illegal immigrant minors?
Reports indicate that the Administration is providing free legal counsel to illegal immigrants
is this true?
Reports indicate that in many cases, the Administration is not detaining illegal immigrants, but releasing them and providing them bus tickets and other transportation to destinations of their choice around the country. How much taxpayer money has been spent to provide free transportation to illegal aliens within the borders of our nation?
The first action step in this situation is to hold the primary actor - the Administration - accountable. These are the questions you have been asking. You have a right to know. I am demanding answers, and I will be posting a copy of the Administration's response on my
website
so that every American might have the opportunity to read and comment.
Randy
