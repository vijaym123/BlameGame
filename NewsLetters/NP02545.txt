Dear Friend,
The last two weeks
have been very productive in Washington DC and here in the Fifth
Congressional District. From VA Department budgets, to more action on the
Keystone Pipeline, to standing firm in my 100% dedication to faith,
family, and values, this Ledger will contain lots of informative content
on the work we are doing in the second month of the 14th
Congress.
Here at home, I've been able to
host a Radio Telephone Town Hall Meeting with KVOR's Richard Randall,
formally name our new VA Clinic after a local World War II hero, and
so much more that you will read about
below.
Please let me
know if you require any assistance with a federal government agency by
contacting my local office at (719)
520-0055.
I am humbled and honored to serve as your
Representative in
Washington.
Sincerely,
Receiving the
True Blue Award from the
Family Research Council for my leadership and perfect 100% voting record
in defense of faith, family, and
freedom
We thank
these Members of Congress for consistently voting to defend and advance
faith, family and freedom. These True Blue Members have voted to
delay Obamacare, protect the unborn, and stand for religious liberty. FRC
and the thousands of families that we represent applaud these Members
for their unwavering commitment to faith, family and freedom, said
Family Research Council Action President Tony
Perkins.
American Family Association Action
President Tim Wildmon made the following
comments:
Our country so
desperately needs lawmakers and elected officials who will stand up
for the moral issues that are shaping our society. These leaders have
helped preserve life, protect religious liberties and promote families,
and for this, we thank them.
ANOTHER FEDERAL LAND
GRAB
President Obama's unilateral decision to designate Browns Canyon as a
National Monument is very troubling. I am outraged; this is the type
of executive order that upsets Americans. This is a top-down, big
government land grab by the President that disenfranchises the concerned
citizens in the Browns Canyon region. Ive heard from multitudes of
local citizens whose concerns about grazing rights, water rights, outdoor
recreation, and the inability of first responders to manage and fight
wildfires in the area have never been addressed. It is also important
for people to note that national monuments created by Presidential
executive order under the Antiquities Act almost always become
underfunded, neglected properties. This is because they are created without
normal Congressional and local consensus, robbing the people of a fair and
open process that stifles the input of the community. And they become
orphans once the Administration changes. Does Browns Canyon really
deserve this kind of second-class status?

FEBRUARY DISTRICT WORK
WEEK
I held a Radio Telephone
Town Hall Meeting hosted by KVOR's Richard Randall. The topics I
discussed with callers included ISIS, executive amnesty, veteran's issues,
and more. Thank you to everyone who participated and for your
thoughtful questions.

Thanks to Kevin O'Neil and the O'Neil Group for
hosting a tour and briefing on their new Catalyst Campus project for
myself and my staff. The Catalyst Campus project is an exciting new
development taking place near Downtown Colorado Springs. Please click
HERE
for more information on this
project.
Improving the situation for our brave veterans is one of my
highest priorities. That's why I was so pleased to have two important
meetings on the subject. First, I met with Dr. Clinton White, the Market
Medical Director for Kaiser Permanente to discuss VA health care
opportunities. Next, I met with CEO Jay Cimino, retired Army Colonel Bob
McLaughlin, and Pueblo County Commissioner Sal Pace of the Mount Carmel
Center of Excellence. Mt. Carmel provides wellness programs and
transitional services with special emphasis on veterans, military, and their
families. Mt. Carmel also provides space, expertise, and resources in
collaboration with numerous community
partners.
Thank you to Bob Cope of the City of Colorado
Springs Economic Vitality Department for coming to my office to discuss
the City for Champions project.

Congressional District Address, the military response to ISIS, and
more.
Thank
you to everyone who took the time to attend the ceremony naming our new
VA Clinic after World War II hero and Medal of Honor recipient Floyd
K. Lindstrom. It was an honor to carry this legislation through
Congress and this is a perfect way to commemorate a local
hero.

STANDING UP
FOR OUR
VETERANS
I participated in a budget hearing in
the House Veterans Affairs Committee. The Committee heard from a
distinguished panel designed to discuss the depth and breadth of the budget
proposals coming from the VA
Department.
Please click
HERE
to
receive an update on the construction of the Southern Colorado National
Veterans Cemetery
I also offered an
amendment to H.R. 216, the Department of Veterans Affairs Budget Planning
Reform Act of 2015. This legislation proposes that the VA submit a
five year budget and conduct quadrennial reviews of their strategy for
meeting every programs commitments to our veterans. My amendment
provides a critical level of additional oversight by calling for an
Independent Veterans Review Panel to review the VA produced quadrennial
review. Modeled after the National Defense Panel, this panel will insure VA
leadership is held accountable and is properly stressing the
importance of long-term thinking to address the challenges facing the
VA.
My amendment will allow for greater independent
oversight and outside perspectives in the proposed quadrennial review process.
It is extremely important that these proposals are reviewed by an
expert, outside group that does not become caught up in bureaucratic
micromanagement and groupthink. The quadrennial veterans review must not
be merely a carbon copy of the VAs budget request. Our veterans
deserve to have plans from the VA vetted by an impartial third party and my
amendment creates exactly
that.

process
PUSHING BACK AGAINST SEANTE
DEMOCRATS
I
joined 169 of my fellow House Republicans in demanding that Senate Minority
Leader Harry Reid stop censoring debate on a critical bill that would
fund the Department of Homeland Securitys operations for Fiscal Year
2015 and defund unconstitutional programs created unilaterally by
President Obama.
Text of Letter to Senator
Reid
Dear Minority Leader
Reid,
We write to express our strong concern
that Senate Democrats are blocking debate on a critical bill that
would fund the Department of Homeland Securitys operations for Fiscal
Year 2015 and defund unconstitutional programs created unilaterally by
President Obama.
Three
times, you and other members of your caucus have prevented even a debate
of the House-passed Department of Homeland Security Appropriations
bill. While we understand that you and many of your Democrat colleagues
are opposed to the provisions in the House-passed bill that would defund
President Obamas effective rewriting of our immigration laws, you
should at least support debating the merits of such an important funding
bill and offer amendments to the provisions you wish to
change.
However, you have repeatedly
obstructed even debating this bill in order to protect President Obamas
unconstitutional acts and shield Senators of your party
many of
whom have publicly stated that they oppose the Presidents unilateral
actions
from voting on the substance of the House-passed bill. It is
utterly appalling that you and other Senate Democrats believe that
protecting the Presidents unconstitutional actions is more important than
funding a Department tasked with keeping Americans
safe.
By preventing the Senate from
taking up the House-passed bill, you are also denying the American people
a fair debate on this issue. And a fair debate is what the American
people want
they fundamentally disagree with President Obamas
actions and believe that he has unlawfully acted alone. For example, a
Washington Post/ABC News poll last month found that 57% of registered
voters believe that President Obamas grant of deferred action should be
blocked.
President Obamas
actions are tilting the scales of our government in the executives
favor, threatening to unravel our system of checks and balances and
imperiling all our liberties.
The House of Representatives has acted
decisively to defend the Constitution from this clear and present
danger by voting to defund the presidents executive actions.
For
the sake of our nation, our two bodies must stand together on a
bipartisan basis. But in order to do this, the Senate Democrat caucus must
cease to play politics with the Constitution.
You must end your
filibuster of the House-passed bill and allow it to proceed to the floor
for consideration.
History will record our actions and how we
honor the trust placed in all of us by the American
people.

SUPPORTING AMERICAN ENERGY &amp; SMALL
BUSINESSES
I cast a vote in support of the Keystone XL Pipeline, finally
sending the bill to President Obama's desk for his signature. The
President has wasted six long years and lost a golden opportunity to create
economic growth and to provide greater energy security by delaying
the approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline. It is time for President Obama
to finally work with the bipartisan majorities in Congress who have
supported this project. The Keystone XL Pipeline will support long-term
energy security and will support more than 42,000 jobs across the
country. This equals $2 billion in earnings for workers and contributes
approximately $3.4 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product. The
Keystone pipeline has met all the requirements this administration has
demanded and more. There is simply no fact-based reason for the President
to oppose this project. I hope that he stands with a majority of
Americans who believe that it is well past time to build the Keystone XL
Pipeline.
I voted
in support of H.R. 636, the Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2015.
The bill provides greater certainty to small businesses by making three
tax provisions permanent rather than continuing to rely on short-term
congressional extensions. Please click
HERE
for more information on H.R.
636.
SUPPORTING OUR NATIONAL
DEFENSE
Recently, I was able to participate in
a trip to the USS Theodore Roosevelt. I gained a greater
understanding of the operational capabilities of a nuclear powered aircraft
carrier, a vessel that is vital to our national
security.
