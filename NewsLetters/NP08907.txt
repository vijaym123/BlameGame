Dear Friend,
"You are about to embark upon a great crusade, toward which we have
striven these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you. The
hopes and prayers of liberty loving people everywhere march with you."
These were the words of General Dwight D. Eisenhower in a message to
troops just before D-Day-June 6, 1944-as Allied troops prepared to land
at Normandy and save the free world. As we pause to observe the 70th
anniversary of that day, I think back to the 40th anniversary, when
President Ronald Reagan travelled to Normandy to honor the "boys of
Pointe du Hoc" and the other brave men and women of World War II. If
you haven't watched his remarks, I encourage you to take a few minutes
to do so by clicking here
.
In advance of D-Day's anniversary, 25 World War II veterans and one
Vietnam War veteran were in Washington, D.C. this week to visit the
World War II memorial for the first time. It was an honor to have flags
flown over the U.S. Capitol and recognize these heroes in the
Congressional Record. Thank you to Honor Flight of Oregon and Gail
Yakopatz for making this trip possible for these veterans.
As we honor and remember the "Greatest Generation," I am proud of the
young people that continue to volunteer to serve our country. In recent
weeks, thousands of our nation's finest young men and women have
graduated from service academies and been commissioned into our armed
forces. On May 23, four students from Central Oregon graduated from the
U.S. Naval Academy. Two were commissioned as officers in the Marine
Corps, and two were commissioned into the U.S. Navy. Read more about
the recent graduates from The Bulletin here
.
It's not enough to honor and remember, though-we must continue to
defend freedom at home and abroad.
In the words of President Reagan at
Normandy, "Strengthened by their courage and heartened by their valor
and borne by their memory, let us continue to stand for the ideals for
which they lived and died."
Time for accountability at the Veterans Administration
Americans are correctly outraged by the growing scandal at the VA.
According to KGW News
, veterans trying to see a doctor for the first time in Portland face
some of the longest wait times in the nation. And I hear about the
claims backlog way too often from veterans in Oregon. The latest
numbers from the Portland office show that about 62% of veterans'
claims are older than 125 days.
As a nation, we owe our veterans the best care possible. From World War
II to Korea, Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan, they've all fought to
defend our freedom, and we must ensure they receive the benefits and
care they've earned.
We in the House are continuing to act-passing legislation to clean up
this mess once and for all.
We've already passed legislation to fund
important veterans programs and reduce the unacceptable claims backlog.
Now the House has overwhelmingly passed-with my strong support-the VA
Management Accountability Act. Current law puts layers and layers of
red tape in the way before a senior manager at the VA can be dismissed
for not doing their job. This common-sense bill would make it easier to
fire or demote senior level managers at the VA who are failing to live
up to their responsibilities to our veterans and their families.
This plan would bring much-needed accountability to the Veterans
Administration, and the Senate should pass it right away too. Our
nation has made a promise to veterans. And we must keep it.
If you or a loved one are having problems with the VA or any other
federal agency, call my office in Oregon toll free from the 541 area
code at 800-533-3303. I have three veterans on staff standing by to
help, and I will do everything I can to get results for you.
Visiting with small businesses and the National Guard in the Gorge
I was in the Columbia Gorge this week for meetings with small brewers
and other businesses and to tour the new Readiness Center in The
Dalles. Here's a shot of Mt. Hood between meetings. Could anyone ask
for a more beautiful view?
The meetings began at Tofurky, a vegetarian food company in Hood River.
Founder Seth Tibbot told me that the company has grown over the past 33
years to have about 100 employees, with 30 more jobs projected in the
next three years. They opened a new building in Hood River last fall,
and I was glad I could stop by and tour it.
I also toured the new facility at Insitu, which they are preparing to
open in the Gorge on June 12. Insitu supports several hundred jobs in
Hood River and the surrounding area, and they are doing great work
developing new technology in the Gorge.
Then it was on to Full Sail Brewery in Hood River for a roundtable
meeting with small brewers. These brewers are growing Oregon's economy
and creating jobs all over our state. But they continue to face red
tape from the federal government that threatens their business. One
major topic of discussion was the "spent grains" rule for brewers that
the FDA recently proposed before pulling back after a bipartisan
outcry. These roundtable meetings are very valuable for me to learn
more about a growing industry and offer to do whatever I can to help.
Finally, it was on to The Dalles to tour the new Fort Dalles Readiness
Center. The Oregon Congressional Delegation worked for many years with
the National Guard, Columbia Gorge Community College (CGCC), and the
local community to get this done, and it is certainty an impressive new
facility. This new center will train approximately 150 soldiers a month
and is shared with the college's renewable energy program.
It's a
fantastic partnership between the CGCC and the Oregon National Guard
and provides and incredible community facility.
Thank you to Dr. Frank
Toda (CGCC President) and others for the tour.
House passes bill to boost economic opportunities in Hermiston, allow
important research to continue
Good news. The House has unanimously passed my bill to place the 290
acres of land currently home to Oregon State's Hermiston Agriculture
Research and Experiment Center (HAREC) fully under local control. The
Hermiston Reversionary Lands Act (H.R. 3366) repeals an antiquated
federal rule, providing an opportunity to grow Hermiston's economy
while allowing the flexibility needed for valuable, local agriculture
research to continue. Click here to watch me speak about the plan on
the House floor.
In 1954, the 290 acres near Hermiston was conveyed by the federal
government to the State of Oregon for the creation of an agricultural
experiment station. The federal government still holds mineral and
reversionary interest in the property. Should any portion of the
current research station property no longer be used for agricultural
research purposes, the property would return to federal ownership.
This antiquated clause provides management challenges for the station
and denies the flexibility needed for OSU to generate revenue from
portions unsuited for agriculture research. For example, it denies the
university the ability to sell the property and relocate the station
out beyond city limits to an area better located for agriculture
research, if needed in the future. The clause also denies the local
community the flexibility it needs to grow the economy and provide jobs
to meet the demands of the growing region.
Local leaders hailed passage of the plan:
OSU President Ed Ray said,
"This will provide the flexibility needed to ensure that the station
can continue to do research in support of the agricultural community,
the needs of the city of Hermiston, the region and beyond, now and for
generations to come."
And Bryan Wolfe, a local farmer and Chairman of the HAREC advisory
committee said, "As an agricultural community, we depend on the OSU
Hermiston experiment station to have the latest crop research and
techniques to remain competitive, support our economy and grow jobs. We
appreciate Congressman Walden working with growers here locally to make
sure an obscure federal law does not endanger the future of the
experiment station and our agricultural economy.
I am pleased that the House overwhelmingly approved this common-sense
plan. The Senate should pass it without delay so it can become law.
Forest access bill on deck next week
Next Tuesday, June 10, the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on
Public Lands and Environmental Regulation will hold a hearing on the
Forest Access in Rural Communities Act (H.R. 4272)
.
Union County Commissioner Steve
McClure will be on hand to give his support to the bill and perspective
as a county commissioner.
Federal agencies need to heed the input and wishes of local citizens
before closing roads and restricting access. My bill will bring
management decisions about public lands back to rural communities and
force the forest service to listen to Oregonians.
"During the first round of travel management planning on the
Wallowa-Whitman National Forest, I saw the Forest Service largely
ignore the data and comments compiled by local forest users when the
plan was released. I appreciate Representative Walden working with the
counties and local residents throughout the travel management planning
process and in crafting H.R. 4272 to ensure local communities have a
say in management decisions on our National Forests," Commissioner
McClure said.
I want to hear your thoughts on forest access. Click here to send me an
email before the hearing to let me know your view.
Thank you, and have a great week.
Best regards,
Greg Walden

Dear

&#8220;You
are
about

Time
for
accountability
at
the
Veterans
Administration
Americans
are
correctly
outraged
by
the
growing
scandal
at
the
VA.
According
to
KGW
News ,
veterans
trying
to
see
a
doctor
for
the
first
time
in
Portland
face
some
of
the
longest
wait
times
in
the
nation.
And
I
hear
about
the
claims
backlog
way
too
often
from
veterans
in
Oregon.
The
latest
numbers
from
the
Portland
office
show
that
about
62%
of
veterans&#8217;
claims
are
older
than
125
days.
As
a
nation,
we
owe
our
veterans
the
best
care
possible.
From
World
War
II
to
Korea,
Vietnam
to
Iraq
and
Afghanistan,
they&#8217;ve
all
fought
to
defend
our
freedom,
and
we
must
ensure
they
receive
the
benefits
and
care
they&#8217;ve
earned.
We
in
the
House
are
continuing
to
act&#8212;passing
legislation
to
clean
up
this
mess
once
and
for
all.
We&#8217;ve
already
passed
legislation
to
fund
important
veterans
programs
and
reduce
the
unacceptable
claims
backlog.
Now
the
House
has
overwhelmingly
passed&#8212;with
my
strong
support&#8212;the
VA
Management
Accountability
Act.
Current
law
puts
layers
and
layers
of
red
tape
in
the
way
before
a
senior
manager
at
the
VA
can
be
dismissed
for
not
doing
their
job.
This
common-sense
bill
would
make
it
easier
to
fire
or
demote
senior
level
managers
at
the
VA
who
are
failing
to
live
up
to
their
responsibilities
to
our
veterans
and
their
families.
This
plan
would
bring
much-needed
accountability
to
the
Veterans
Administration,
and
the
Senate
should
pass
it
right
away
too.
Our
nation
has
made
a
promise
to
veterans.
And
we
must
keep
it.
If
you
or
a

are
having

with
the
VA
or
any
other
federal
agency,
call
my

in
Oregon

I

Visiting
with
small
businesses
and
the
National
Guard
in
the
Gorge
I
was
in
the
Columbia
Gorge
this
week
for
meetings
with
small
brewers
and
other
businesses
and
to
tour
the
new
Readiness
Center
in
The
Dalles.
Here&#8217;s
a
shot
of
Mt.
Hood
between
meetings.
Could
anyone
ask
for
a
more
beautiful
view?
The
meetings
began
at
Tofurky,
a
vegetarian
food
company
in
Hood
River.
Founder
Seth
Tibbot
told
me
that
the
company
has
grown
over
the
past
33
years
to
have
about
100
employees,
with
30
more
jobs
projected
in
the
next
three
years.
They
opened
a
new
building
in
Hood
River
last
fall,
and
I
was
glad
I
could
stop
by
and
tour
it.
I
also
toured
the
new
facility
at
Insitu,
which
they
are
preparing
to
open
in
the
Gorge
on
June
12.
Insitu
supports
several
hundred
jobs
in
Hood
River
and
the
surrounding
area,
and
they
are
doing
great
work
developing
new
technology
in
the
Gorge.
Then
it
was
on
to
Full
Sail
Brewery
in
Hood
River
for
a
roundtable
meeting
with
small
brewers.
These
brewers
are
growing
Oregon&#8217;s
economy
and
creating
jobs
all
over
our
state.
But
they
continue
to
face
red
tape
from
the
federal
government
that
threatens
their
business.
One
major
topic
of
discussion
was
the
&#8220;spent
grains&#8221;
rule
for
brewers
that
the
FDA
recently
proposed
before
pulling
back
after
a
bipartisan
outcry.
These
roundtable
meetings
are
very
valuable
for
me
to
learn
more
about
a
growing
industry
and
offer
to
do
whatever
I
can
to
help.
Finally,
it
was
on
to
The
Dalles
to
tour
the
new
Fort
Dalles
Readiness
Center.
The
Oregon
Congressional
Delegation
worked
for
many
years
with
the
National
Guard,
Columbia
Gorge
Community
College
(CGCC),
and
the
local
community
to
get
this
done,
and
it
is
certainty
an
impressive
new
facility.
This
new
center
will
train
approximately
150
soldiers
a
month
and
is
shared
with
the
college&#8217;s
renewable
energy
program.
It&#8217;s
a
fantastic
partnership
between
the
CGCC
and
the
Oregon
National
Guard
and
provides
and
incredible
community
facility.
Thank
you
to
Dr.
Frank
Toda
(CGCC
President)
and
others
for
the
tour.
House
passes
bill
to
boost
economic
opportunities
in
Hermiston,
allow
important
research
to
continue
Good
news.
The
House
has
unanimously
passed
my
bill
to
place
the
290
acres
of
land
currently
home
to
Oregon
State&#8217;s
Hermiston
Agriculture
Research
and
Experiment
Center
(HAREC)
fully
under
local
control.
The
Hermiston
Reversionary
Lands
Act
(H.R.
3366)
repeals
an
antiquated
federal
rule,
providing
an
opportunity
to
grow
Hermiston&#8217;s
economy
while
allowing
the
flexibility
needed
for
valuable,
local
agriculture
research
to
continue.
Click
here
to
watch
me
speak
about
the
plan
on
the
House
floor.
In
1954,
the
290
acres
near
Hermiston
was
conveyed
by
the
federal
government
to
the
State
of
Oregon
for
the
creation
of
an
agricultural
experiment
station.
The
federal
government
still
holds
mineral
and
reversionary
interest
in
the
property.
Should
any
portion
of
the
current
research
station
property
no
longer
be
used
for
agricultural
research
purposes,
the
property
would
return
to
federal
ownership.
This
antiquated
clause
provides
management
challenges
for
the
station
and
denies
the
flexibility
needed
for
OSU
to
generate
revenue
from
portions
unsuited
for
agriculture
research.
For
example,
it
denies
the
university
the
ability
to
sell
the
property
and
relocate
the
station
out
beyond
city
limits
to
an
area
better
located
for
agriculture
research,
if
needed
in
the
future.
The
clause
also
denies
the
local
community
the
flexibility
it
needs
to
grow
the
economy
and
provide
jobs
to
meet
the
demands
of
the
growing
region.
Local
leaders
hailed
passage
of
the
plan:
OSU
President
Ed
Ray
said,
&#8220;This
will
provide
the
flexibility
needed
to
ensure
that
the
station
can
continue
to
do
research
in
support
of
the
agricultural
community,
the
needs
of
the
city
of
Hermiston,
the
region
and
beyond,
now
and
for
generations
to
come.&#8221;
And
Bryan
Wolfe,
a
local
farmer
and
Chairman
of
the
HAREC
advisory
committee
said,
&#8220;As
an
agricultural
community,
we
depend
on
the
OSU
Hermiston
experiment
station
to
have
the
latest
crop
research
and
techniques
to
remain
competitive,
support
our
economy
and
grow
jobs.
We
appreciate
Congressman
Walden
working
with
growers
here
locally
to
make
sure
an
obscure
federal
law
does
not
endanger
the
future
of
the
experiment
station
and
our
agricultural
economy.
I
am
pleased
that
the
House
overwhelmingly
approved
this
common-sense
plan.
The
Senate
should
pass
it
without
delay
so
it
can
beco me
l aw.
Forest
access
bill
on
deck
next
week
Next
Tuesday,
June
10,
the
House
Natural
Resources
Subcommittee
on
Public
Lands
and
Environmental
Regulation
will
hold
a
hearing
on
the
Forest
Access
in
Rural
Communities
Act
(H.R.

Union
County
Commissioner
Steve
McClure
will
be
on
hand
to
give
his
support
to
the
bill
and
perspective
as
a
county
commissioner.
Federal
agencies
need
to
heed
the
input
and
wishes
of
local
citizens
before
closing
roads
and
restricting
access.
My
bill
will
bring
management
decisions
about
public
lands
back
to
rural
communities
and
force
the
forest
service
to
listen
to
Oregonians.
&#8220;During
the
first
round
of
travel
management
planning
on
the
Wallowa-Whitman
National
Forest,
I
saw
the
Forest
Service
largely
ignore
the
data
and
comments
compiled
by
local
forest
users
when
the
plan
was
released.
I
appreciate
Representative
Walden
working
with
the
counties
and
local
residents
throughout
the
travel
management
planning
process
and
in
crafting
H.R.
4272
to
ensure
local

have
a
say
in
