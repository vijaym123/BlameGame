Dear Friends,
Each year on January 1st, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is released. This free form, created by the Department of Education, is the only form required to apply for federal aid.
The CSS/Financial Aid Profile, put out by the College Board, is an additional form that carries with it a $25 charge for the first year, and $16 for each subsequent year.
Many colleges use the CSS profile in making their own aid packages; however the
FAFSA is a free form
and is the
only form
required for federal aid and Pell grant eligibility.
Each year, the
Office of Federal Student Aid
offers an estimated $150 billion in grants, loans, and work study funds for college students. It is critical to fill out the
FAFSA form
in order to receive the maximum amount of help in paying for a college education. Use the resources below to help you fill out the free FAFSA form:

There are tools readily available on the Federal Student Aid website to help you arrive at an
estimate of how much aid a student will receive . Use the

As your member of Congress, I want to make sure you are aware of the federal resources available to aid in paying for college. If you have any questions or concerns about filling out the free FAFSA application, do not hesitate to visit my website, or the
FAFSA section
of the US Department of Education&rsquo;s website.
With kindest regards, I am,
