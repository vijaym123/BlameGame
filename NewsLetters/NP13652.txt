Dear friend &ndash;
Like so many municipalities across the nation, Orange County struggles with underfunded pensions and rising costs. But instead of picking corners, Orange County&rsquo;s pension stakeholders came to the table and found a fiscally sustainable way to provide retirement security for our hardworking government employees.
In 2009, the County of Orange and the Orange County Employees Associations (OCEA) developed a smart solution. The plan, supported by both sides of the aisle, provides a lower defined benefit option that the County would offer along with participation in an employer matching, defined contribution plan.
However, the plan requires a change in the Internal Revenue Code to protect the income tax treatment of employee contributions. The Treasury Department, despite three years of lobbying by me, OCEA and the County, has been unwilling to make this change.
Last week I convened a meeting between reform stakeholders and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (MI-4). During the meeting, Chairman Camp pledged his support to lobby the Treasury Department for a waiver necessary to implement reform. The Chairman&rsquo;s support marks a key step forward to make this bipartisan plan a reality.
There is simply no good reason that Orange County should not be able to proceed with their innovative solution to keep their pension system solvent and control future costs and liabilities.
I will continue to push for an administrative or legislative fix to solve this difficult fiscal issue.
Sincerely,
Loretta Sanchez
Member of Congress
