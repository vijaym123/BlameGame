September 11, 2014
Dear
Friend,
All Montanans
pause today to remember those who lost their lives during the terror
attacks of September 11, 2001. While more than a decade has passed, we
continue to honor the bravery of the first responders, the
firefighters and passersby who ran into the face of danger even if it meant
giving their own life to save another.
We also pause to
remember the American lives lost in the September 11, 2012 terror attack on
the United States embassy in Benghazi, Libya: Ambassador Christopher
Stevens, Information Officer Sean Smith, and former Navy SEALs Glen
Doherty and Tyrone Woods. We will continue to seek answers and bring to
justice the perpetrators of this attack.
We are eternally
grateful to the heroes of the United States Armed Forces who have
stood watch around the globe ever since, fighting the persistent threat
of terrorism that still exists. We honor the sacrifice of those who
have given their lives in service to our country and in protection of our
freedom.
The terrorists who committed these unspeakable
acts tried to weaken our nation, but the spirit of America
bravery,
resolve, courage, perseverance
shines the brightest in our darkest
hours. We will be the beacon of freedom and liberty in the world. We
will remain united. We will remember September 11.
God bless the
United States of America,
Steve
