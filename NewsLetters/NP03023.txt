HOUSE PASSES BILL TO PREVENT TAXPAYER FUNDING OF ABORTION
For more than three decades, various appropriations riders have been enacted to prohibit federal funding of abortion.
This patchwork approach has created uncertainty, as each provision requires regular re-approval.
The Hyde amendment was first enacted in 1976 and prohibits both the direct use of federal funds for abortion services and federal subsidies for health insurance plans that include abortion coverage, except in the cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the mother is in danger.
However, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) allows plans offered on the exchanges to cover elective abortions and authorizes taxpayer subsidies to be used to purchase plans covering these services.
Therefore, on January 22, 2015, the House of Representatives passed
H.R. 7 , the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2015, with my support.
This bill would codify policies that prohibit federal funding of abortion or insurance coverage that includes abortion.
Additionally, H.R. 7 would reduce the need for numerous separate abortion funding policies by establishing a government-wide statutory prohibition on funding abortion and ensure that no program or agency is exempt from this important safeguard.
2015 MARCH FOR LIFE
Thanks again to all who traveled to Washington, D.C. in support of protecting the sanctity of life.
I truly appreciate your dedication to this important cause.
Below are some pictures of constituents with me who were able to attend the open house.
U.S. SUPREME COURT ACCEPTS SAME-SEX MARRIAGE CASE
On January 16, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS) announced that the Court will review a 2-1 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6 th
Circuit that upheld bans on same-sex marriage in Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, and Tennessee.
The 6 th
Circuit decision marked the first time a federal appeals court backed a same-sex marriage ban after other appellate courts had found similar bans unconstitutional.
The split among the circuit courts gives the Supreme Court the opportunity to affirm what states across the country did in preserving the longstanding definition of marriage in their state constitutions.
SCOTUS has said it will specifically address two questions: (1) Does the 14 th
Amendment require a state to license a marriage between two people of the same sex? And (2) Does the 14 th
Amendment require a state to recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex when their marriage was lawfully licensed and performed out-of-state?
It is expected that the Court will issue a ruling by June 2015.
