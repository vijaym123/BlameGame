I appreciate the sacrifices that our veterans, active duty,
reserve, and National Guard personnel and their families have made.
Addressing issues that impact veterans and our servicemen and women
is one of my top priorities.
Our freedom would not be possible
without the prior service of veterans and our brave Armed Forces
stationed around the world today.
Many Missouri veterans have
voiced their concerns about the Gene Taylor Community Based Outpatient
Clinic being relocated to Springfield, and about the University of
Missouri Health Care's decision to close the Missouri Rehabilitation Center,
which houses the Mt. Vernon veterans' clinic.
The Veterans
Health Care System of the Ozarks submitted plans to relocate the
clinic to Springfield on September 17, 2010, before my tenure in
office.
The relocation to Springfield would mean that 10,071 veterans
within a 30-minute drive would be able to access the location, as opposed
to the 1,806 that are within a 30-minute drive at the current
location.
One goal of moving the location is to be closer to other
community medical services, which should increase the VA's ability to
retain qualified staff.
Additionally, the Veterans Health Care
System of the Ozarks has proposed a plan to open a veterans' clinic in
Joplin, which would create a clinic with 80 rooms and 40 employees
that would be expected to serve 9,000 veterans
annually.
Earlier this summer the House and Senate passed the
Veterans' Access
to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act . This
Act makes several reforms and includes provisions which would allow
veterans to receive care at non-Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA)
facilities and a requirement that the VA provides a Veterans Choice Card
for eligible veterans to receive care provided by non-VA
providers.
Eligible veterans are those who are enrolled in the VA health
system as of August 1, 2014, newly discharged veterans who are unable to
secure an appointment at a VA facility in 30 days, or veterans who
live more than 40 miles from a VA medical facility.
The legislation
also authorizes the VA to fire or demote Senior Executive Service
employees for negligence and poor performance and reduces funding for
bonuses available to VA employees by $40 million each year through Fiscal
Year 2024.
Generations of Americans have sacrificed to
protect our country, and as such we are obligated to care for these
courageous men and women as they grow older.
I feel it is my duty as
your congressman to ensure we support our veterans and give them the
benefits they rightly deserve.
I will continue to monitor how the
University of Missouri Health Care's decision to close the Missouri
Rehabilitation Center will impact area veterans who currently receive
care at that facility.
