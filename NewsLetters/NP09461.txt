Rep. Bruce Braley -- Iowa's First
District
David,
Iowa's active duty servicemembers and veterans deserve our respect and
gratitude every day, and I'm extremely proud to fight for them in
Congress.
Here's a quick update on some of the work I've been doing for our
veterans and brave soldiers over the last few weeks.
Honor Flights from Iowa
Rep. Braley at Eastern Iowa Honor
Flight
One of the best parts of my job is meeting with our nations veterans
and listening to their stories, not only about their brave service but
also about their lives after war, their families, and their work in
communities across Iowa.
That's why it was such an honor this week to meet with veterans from
the Dubuque and the Cedar Rapids areas who traveled to Washington, DC
as part of two Honor Flights from Iowa.
Every Honor Flight is a reminder of the tremendous amount of bravery
and sacrifice given by veterans from Iowa. Getting to meet veterans
that served during the same period as my father is an honor -- they
represent the very best of Iowa. It was a pleasure meeting Korean War
veteran Dick Spearman from Marion (pictured here) who traveled with the
Eastern Iowa Honor Flight on Wednesday.
The Honor Flight Network is a non-profit organization created to honor
America's veterans for their sacrifices by taking World War II and
Korean War veterans to Washington, DC to view their memorials
in-person, and at no cost.

Fighting for the Iowa National Guard
The National Guard is an essential component of America's defense
apparatus and has proven to be as effective as its active duty
counterparts.
But given the current fiscal climate, the Pentagon has proposed cutting
parts of the Iowa National Guard as a way of reducing cost. This is
simply unacceptable and why I've been fighting in Congress to protect
the Iowa Guard from these cuts.
That's why I wanted to share some good news with you: Yesterday, under
pressure from my colleagues and I, the House voted to drastically scale
back the cuts to the National Guard.
Iowa's National Guard has protected the lives of Iowans both at home
and abroad, and -- while yesterday's vote is a big step toward ensuring
that they can continue doing their job -- we can't let up now. I'm
going to continue fighting to protect the Iowa National Guard and
prevent even these reduced cuts from taking place. There are much
better areas to find savings at the Pentagon than cutting troops that
protect Iowans at home and abroad.

The True Cost of War
It's past time we stopped spending tens of billions of dollars a year
halfway around the world and bring our troops home.
That's why this week I reintroduced my True Cost of War amendment
to require the President, in
consultation with the Secretaries of Defense, State and Veterans
Affairs to report on the long-term costs of the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan in human and financial terms.
And just yesterday, the House passed my amendment as part of a larger
defense spending bill. This is a huge step toward providing the
American people with the information they deserve about the long-term
cost of these conflicts.
Here's some of what my True Cost of War amendment will do:
*	Require the government to report the current and previous costs
to date of the wars in terms of number of troops deployed, casualty
statistics, pending veterans claims, and the costs associated with
caring for wounded veterans.
*	Report estimates of future costs based on scenarios of
continued troop deployments, estimated number of troops needed,
estimates of future casualties, and healthcare cost projections.
It's embarrassing that over a decade after these wars began, we still
don't have a true accounting of the long-term costs because both the
Bush and Obama administrations would rather avoid the numbers than see
the price we've really paid.
It's time the White House ends their silent opposition to this
commonsense measure and signs it into law.

David,
Iowa's
active
duty
servicemembers
and
veterans
deserve
our
respect
and
gratitude
every
day,
and
I'm
extremely
proud
to
fight
for
them
in
Congress.
Here's
a
quick
update
on
some
of
the
work
I've
been
doing
for
our
veterans
and
brave
soldiers
over
the
last
few
weeks.
Honor
Flights
from
Iowa
One
of
the
best
parts
of
my
job
is
meeting
with
our
nations
veterans
and
listening
to
their
stories,
not
only
about
their
brave
service
but
also
about
their
lives
after
war,
their
families,
and
their
work
in
communities
across
Iowa.
That's
why
it
was
such
an
honor
this
week
to
meet
with
veterans
from
the
Dubuque
and
the
Cedar
Rapids
areas
who
traveled
to
Washington,
DC
as
part
of
two
Honor
Flights
from
Iowa.
Every
Honor
Flight
is
a
reminder
of
the
tremendous
amount
of
bravery
and
sacrifice
given
by
veterans
from
Iowa.
Getting
to
meet
veterans
that
served
during
the
same
period
as
my
father
is
an
honor
--
they
represent
the
very
best
of
Iowa.
It
was
a
pleasure
meeting
Korean
War
veteran
Dick
Spearman
from
Marion
(pictured
here)
who
traveled
with
the
Eastern
Iowa
Honor
Flight
on
Wednesday.
The
Honor
Flight
Network
is
a
non-profit
organization
created
to
honor
America&#8217;s
veterans
for
their
sacrifices
by
taking
World

and
Korean

veterans
to

to
view
their

in-person,
and
at
no
cost.

Fighting
for
the
Iowa
National
Guard
The
National
Guard
is
an
essential
component
of
America's
defense
apparatus
and
has
proven
to
be
as
effective
as
its
active
duty
counterparts.
But
given
the
current
fiscal
climate,
the
Pentagon
has
proposed
cutting
parts
of
the
Iowa
National
Guard
as
a
way
of
reducing
cost.
This
is
simply
unacceptable
and
why
I've
been
fighting
in
Congress
to
protect
the
Iowa
Guard
from
these
cuts.
That's
why
I
wanted
to
share
some
good
news
with
you:
Yesterday,
under
pressure
from
my
colleagues
and
I,
the
House
voted
to
drastically
scale
back
the
cuts
to
the
National
Guard.
Iowa's
National
Guard
has
protected
the
lives
of
Iowans
both
at
home
and
abroad,
and
--
while
yesterday's
vote
is
a
big
step
toward
ensuring
that
they
can
continue
doing
their
job
--
we
can't
let
up
now.
I'm
going
to
continue
fighting
to
protect
the
Iowa
National
Guard
and
prevent
even
these
reduced
cuts
from
taking
place.
There
are
much
better
areas
to
find
savings
at
the
Pentagon
than
cutting
troops
that
protect
Iowans
at
home
and
abroad.
The
True
Cost
of
War
It's
past
time
we
stopped
spending
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
a
year
halfway
around
the
world
and
bring
our
troops
home.
That's
why
this
week
I
reintroduced
my
True
Cost
of
War
amendment
to
require
the
President,
in
consultation
with
the
Secretaries
of
Defense,
State
and
Veterans
Affairs
to
report
on
the
long-term
costs
of
the
wars
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
in
human
and
financial
terms.
And
just
yesterday,
the
House
passed
my
amendment
as
part
of
a
larger
defense
spending
bill.
This
is
a
huge
step
toward
providing
the
American
people
with
the
information
they
deserve
about
the
long-term
cost
of
these
conflicts.
Here's
some
of
what
my
True
Cost
of
War
amendment
will
do:
Require
the
government
to
report
the
current
and
previous
costs
to
date
of
the
wars
in
terms
of
number
of
troops
deployed,
casualty
statistics,
pending
veterans
claims,
and
the
costs
associated
with
caring
for
wounded
veterans. Report
estimates
of
future
costs
based
on
scenarios
of
continued
troop
deployments,
estimated
number
of
troops
needed,
estimates
of
future
casualties,
and
healthcare
cost
projections.
It's
embarrassing
that
over
a
decade
after
these
wars
began,
we
still
don't
have
a
true
accounting
of
the
long-term
costs
because
both
the
Bush
and
Obama
administrations
would
rather
avoid
the
numbers
than
see
the
price
we&#8217;ve
really
paid.
It's
time
the
White
House
ends
their
silent
opposition
to
this
commonsense
measure
and
signs
it
into
law.
