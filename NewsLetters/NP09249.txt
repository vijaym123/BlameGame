Dear Friend,
No matter where I travel in Arizona, I hear a common theme: We have a duty to fight for our veterans and ensure they get the care they need. That&rsquo;s why we are appalled by the allegations of delayed care, mismanagement, and possible veteran deaths at the Phoenix VA and in other cities across the nation.
Our veterans deserve action &ndash; and answers &ndash; so I&rsquo;m working on both. As
The Arizona Republic
recently reported ,
&ldquo;One day after U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick called for a nationwide review of record-keeping at VA medical facilities, Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki ordered exactly that &mdash; audits at every health facility in America operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs.&rdquo;
( read my letter to Secretary Shinseki )
As Arizona&rsquo;s representative on the House Veterans&rsquo; Affairs Committee,
I voted to subpoena documents from the VA
in connection with the Phoenix VA allegations . And as the Ranking Member of its Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee,
I have called for hearings
after the Office of Inspector General completes its investigation. ( watch my CBS-5 interview about this )
Our veterans deserve a healthcare system they can trust, so I&rsquo;ll keep pushing to get to the bottom of this and work toward solutions. You can be sure I&rsquo;ll keep you posted about these efforts.
NOTE: We are finalizing our constituent email list, so

Sincerely,
Ann Kirkpatrick U.S. Representative, Arizona District One

Around the district
Every corner of our massive district has its own unique identity, strengths and challenges. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m constantly on the road, because it&rsquo;s important for me to meet in person with our veterans, seniors, job creators and local leaders to hear what matters to them. Below are a few highlights from my recent visits to
the Navajo Nation ,
the White Mountains ,
and Pinal
and
Pima
counties :
Navajo Nation
Rep. Kirkpatrick spent some time with the JROTC at
Tuba City High School
(as
shown in the photo above) and with students at
Greyhills Academy High School .
They discussed the importance of education and the legacy of military service.
In
Tuba City , Rep. Kirkpatrick met with
Navajo-Hopi Honor Riders
(as shown in
the photo above) and listened to veterans at the VA's
Native American Veterans
Mobile Outreach
unit so she could learn about their experiences in accessing care
through the VA.
White Mountains
During a tour of the
Forest Energy Corporation Pellet Plant in Show Low
(as
shown in the photo above), Rep. Kirkpatrick spoke with local officials about next steps
for the private timber industry as well as the
Four Forest Restoration Initiative ,
which is critical to forest health and local economies.
Pinal County
Rep. Kirkpatrick is working with owners and employees at the
Lucky Nickel Ranch
in
Eloy
(as shown in the photo above) on efforts to provide veterans with training,
jobs and leadership opportunities in agriculture through their innovative work with the
Farmer Veteran Coalition .
Pima County
Rep. Kirkpatrick, who serves as Ranking Member of the
House Veterans&rsquo; Affairs
Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigations, led a field hearing at the
Southern
Arizona VA Health Care facility
(as shown in the photo above). She and subcommittee
chairman
Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colo. , examined the systemic challenges veterans
face in accessing VA care for PTSD and traumatic brain injuries.
