News from Representative John Delaney
May 13, 2014
Dear Friend,
This week, I'm proud to recognize National Small Business Week. As a
former entrepreneur and CEO, I understand the many challenges that
small businesses face in today's global economy. Here in Congress, I've
acted as a voice for Maryland's businesses on issues ranging from
private investment to tax reform.
Last month, I hosted a Business Roundtable in Frederick, bringing
community leaders together to talk about the business climate in our
state and what they need to strengthen our economy. I'm a strong
believer that federal policy needs to start with local input, and I was
happy to hear from Maryland business owners about their top priorities.
I've worked to bring the concerns of business owners in our district to
Washington by drafting and supporting legislation that makes it easier
for Americans to invest in growing companies. This year, I partnered
with Representative Fincher to introduce the Improving Access to
Capital for Emerging Growth Companies Act
, a bill to streamline the initial
public offering process for Emerging Growth Companies (EGCs). Having
worked for two decades as an entrepreneur and CEO, I understand that
when more companies go public, our economy grows and employers hire
more people. I was happy to see strong bipartisan support for my bill,
which passed the Committee in a 56 to 0 vote.
As a Freshman Class President, I've also worked to support commonsense
tax measures that help American small businesses. Last week, the House
of Representatives voted to make permanent the research and
experimentation (R&D;) tax credit for businesses, strengthening our
commitment to innovation, modernization and development in the American
economy. Many small and midsize companies that employ engineers,
develop technology and software or conduct product testing rely on the
R&D; tax credit to make investments that keep our businesses
competitive. I joined my colleagues in supporting the tax credit
extension when it passed the House by a 274 to 131 vote.
Having worked for two decades in the private sector, I understand the
economic challenges that small businesses face. Yesterday, I spoke on
the House floor about the impact that globalization and technology have
had on American communities
. In order to bring local businesses up to
speed, we must make a commitment to strengthen our economy through
infrastructure repair, funding for research, an improved education
system and more. Here in Washington, I've advocated for an approach to
government that gives our country the opportunity to make investments
that will improve U.S. competitiveness for American small businesses.
As the 113th Congress moves forward, I will continue my work to hear
from constituents and Maryland business owners on how we can provide a
foundation for economic growth in the United States. Please take a
moment to let me know your thoughts on this important issue
. As Congress continues to consider strategies for
supporting American small businesses, I will be sure to keep you up to
date with my work.
Sincerely,
John

Dear
Friend,
This
week,
I'm
proud
to
recognize
National
Small
Business
Week.
As
a
former
entrepreneur
and
CEO,
I
understand
the
many
challenges
that
small
businesses
face
in
today&#8217;s
global
economy.
Here
in
Congress,
I&#8217;ve
acted
as
a
voice
for
Maryland&#8217;s
businesses
on
issues
ranging
from
private
investment
to
tax
reform.
Last

I
hosted
a
Business
Roundtable
in
Frederick,
bringing
community
leaders
together
to
talk
about
the
business
climate
in
our
state
and
what
they
need
to
strengthen
our
economy.
I&#8217;m
a
strong
believer
that
federal
policy
needs
to
start
with
local
input,
and
I
was
happy
to
hear
from
Maryland
business
owners
about
their
top
priorities.
I&#8217;ve
worked
to
bring
the

of
business

in
our
