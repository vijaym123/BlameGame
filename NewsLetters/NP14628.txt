November 8th, 2013
Dear Friend,
Monday, November 11th, is Veterans Day, when we recognize the sacrifices
made by our nation's more than 22 million living Americans who have
distinguished themselves through their service in uniform and honor all
of the heroes who have served this country throughout the years. The
bravery and devotion that they have shown throughout our history have
helped build this great country, and each of us owes them-and their
families-a debt of gratitude.

Annual Veterans Day Luncheon
As in years past, I will be hosting my annual Veterans Day luncheon from
11AM to 1PM on Monday at BRIDGES in Memphis. BRIDGES is located at 477
N. 5th Street. If you are a Ninth District veteran, I would like to
invite you to attend my luncheon and I hope to see you there for good
company, good food, and to receive the respect and thanks that you
deserve. Also, just before my luncheon on Monday, I will attend the
Memphis VA Medical Center's Veterans Day Parade.
Bringing More Competition to the Memphis Airport
This Monday, I visited Memphis International Airport to celebrate the
beginning of Southwest Airlines' new service in our city. The airline is
bringing six new non-stop routes to Memphis and will offer more than 80
connecting destinations-that means more competition, better options, and
hopefully lower prices for Mid-South consumers. While our city's
relationship with Delta Airlines has been a source of disappointment and
frustration in recent years, things are beginning to look up for Memphis
travelers.
Recovering from 2011's Severe Floods
Our community sustained terrible damage in the severe storms of 2011,
and many Ninth District citizens still need help rebuilding their lives.
On Tuesday, the Department of Housing and Urban Development approved
Shelby County's disaster recovery plan, paving the way for the County to
receive more than $7.4 million in federal funding for its recovery
efforts. This funding will go a long way towards helping our city and
the rest of Shelby County recover from the natural disaster that still
affects many families in our region.
Helping Memphis Get Covered
All Memphians should have quality health coverage. Luckily, many who
have been unable to afford quality coverage in the past are now eligible
to enroll in Tennessee's Health Insurance Marketplace
thanks to the President's landmark Affordable Care Act, also known
as Obamacare. If you do not have health insurance coverage, you may be
eligible to save money on your health care premiums
in the
Marketplace.
If you are on Medicare or your employer is going to offer qualified
health insurance next year, you're already covered and won't need to
enter the Marketplace for your health coverage. If you aren't sure
whether or not you will need to use the Marketplace to get insurance,
call the Marketplace Hotline at 1-800-318-2596 or visit
www.HealthCare.gov
. You can also call my office or the Marketplace Hotline to
find out if TennCare (Tennessee's Medicaid program) is a coverage option
for you. If you are one of the millions of Americans who need health
insurance, you can sign up
for coverage today that will take effect January 1, 2014.
Enrollment in the marketplace will remain open for six months, but you
can go online to www.healthcare.gov
today to check out your options.
The Affordable Care Act is already working for families across the Ninth
District and the government shutdown didn't change that. According to
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 147,000 individuals in
the district now have health insurance that covers preventive services
without co-pays, $3.1 million in insurance premiums have been returned
to consumers, and more than 5,000 seniors on Medicare paid a total of
$5.9 million less for their prescription medications as we continue to
close the 'donut hole.' Health insurance companies can no longer
discriminate against patients with pre-existing conditions and young
adults up to age 26 can now stay on their parents' insurance plan.
In recent weeks, there have been reports of citizens having difficulty
successfully using the Marketplace website. Many of these reported
problems have already been resolved and there are people working around
the clock to fix the problems that remain on the website. But the
Marketplace website is only one tool that you can use to sign up for
coverage. If you are having trouble accessing the website, please do not
hesitate to call the Marketplace Hotline at 1-800-318-2596 or visit
Seedco Mid-South for in-person help. Seedco is located at 22 North Front
Street (Suite 900), and they can be reached by phone at 901-528-8341.
Next week, Seedco will also be hosting two town hall meetings with Mayor
A C Wharton to answer questions about the Marketplace and help Memphians
enroll in it. On Tuesday from 5:30 to 7:00 PM, they will host a town
hall meeting at the Benjamin L. Hooks Central Library on Poplar and from
5:30 to 7:00PM on Thursday, you can attend their town hall meeting at
Golden Gate Cathedral, located at 3240 James Road. If you have any other
questions, you should also feel free to call my office at 901-544-4131.
Remembering JFK
Next week, WKNO Public Television will air "American Experience: JFK," a
two-part profile of one of our nation's most beloved presidents. Last
week in Washington, I had the opportunity to see an advance screening of
the film with John Seigenthaler who, in addition to being a
well-respected Tennessean, was a close friend of the Kennedys. If you
are interested in the life and times of President John F. Kennedy, I
recommend you taking the time to watch or record this profile next week.
The first part will air at 8PM on Monday night, and part two will air at
8PM Tuesday.
Medicare Open Enrollment
Medicare Part D enrollment for 2014 is now open and will run until
December 7th. The Aging Commission of the Mid-South will be sponsoring
several enrollment workshops in the 9th District to assist seniors in
enrolling in next year's plans. All that you have to bring is your
Medicare card and prescriptions. Be sure not to miss out on this great
opportunity to lower your monthly pharmacy costs. For dates, times, and
locations of the workshops please click here
.
Keeping More Newborns Alive
A few days ago, the New York Times ran a story about one aspect of the
Affordable Care Act that many people don't know about: the landmark
health care reform law could help prevent the deaths of infants around
the country. Though our nation once lost fewer infants than most other
industrialized nations, in 2010 we fell behind most of the
industrialized world
. Because the Affordable Care Act now ensures broader access to
prenatal care for pregnant women in this country, many women at higher
risk of premature births-who are often minorities-will have improved
health care and we could see a quantifiable decrease in our nation's
infant mortality soon. The New York Times story
is definitely worth a read.
Electronics Recycling Drive
Next Friday between 3 and 6:30 PM, an electronics recycling drive will
be held at the Central Station pavilion at Front and G.E. Patterson. If
you have any electronics that you need to dispose of but that should not
be recycled or thrown in the trash (such as computers, TVs, cell phones,
DVDs and other items), I hope you will bring them to the recycling drive
next week.
Grant Announcements
I regularly release a list of grant announcements from federal agencies
like the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, and others. These
federal funding opportunities are available to faith-based and
neighborhood associations, nonprofits and other community organizations
in the 9th District. The announcements are updated regularly on my
website
.
As always, I remain.
Most sincerely,
Steve Cohen

Bringing
More
Competition
to
the
Memphis
Airport
This
Monday,
I
visited
Memphis
International
Airport
to
celebrate
the
beginning
of
Southwest
Airlines&#8217;
new
service
in
our
city.
The
airline
is
bringing
six
new
non-stop
routes
to
Memphis
and
will
offer
more
than
80
connecting
destinations&#8212;that
means
more
competition,
better
options,
and
hopefully
lower
prices
for
Mid-South
consumers.
While
our
city&#8217;s
relationship
with
Delta
Airlines
has
been
a
source
of
disappointment
and
frustration
in
recent
years,
things
are
beginning
to
look
up
for
Memphis
travelers.
Recovering
from
2011&#8217;s
Severe
Floods
Our
community
sustained
terrible
damage
in
the
severe
storms
of
2011,
and
many
Ninth
District
citizens
still
need
help
rebuilding
their
lives.
On
Tuesday,
the
Department
of
Housing
and
Urban
Development
approved
Shelby
County&#8217;s
disaster
recovery
plan,
paving
the
way
for
the
County
to
receive
more
than
$7.4
million
in
federal
funding
for
its
recovery
efforts.
This
funding
will
go
a
long
way
towards
helping
our
city
and
the
rest
of
Shelby
County
recover
from
the
natural
disaster
that
still
affects
many
families
in
our
region.
Helping
Memphis
Get
Covered
All
Memphians
should
have
quality
health
coverage.
Luckily,
many
who
have
been
unable
to
afford
quality
coverage
in
the
past
are
now
eligible
to
enroll
in
Tennessee&#8217;s
Health
Insurance
Marketplace
thanks
to
the
President&#8217;s
landmark
Affordable
Care
Act,
also
known
as
Obamacare.
If
you
do
not
have
health
insurance
coverage,
you
may
be
eligible
to
save
money
on
your
health
care
premiums
in
the
Marketplace.
If
you
are
on
Medicare
or
your
employer
is
going
to
offer
qualified
health
insurance
next
year,
you&#8217;re
already
covered
and
won&#8217;t
need
to
enter
the
Marketplace
for
your
health
coverage.
If
you
aren&#8217;t
sure
whether
or
not
you
will
need
to
use
the
Marketplace
to
get
insurance,
call
the
Marketplace
Hotline
at
1-800-318-2596
or
visit
www.HealthCare.gov .
You
can
also
call
my
office
or
the
Marketplace
Hotline
to
find
out
if
TennCare
(Tennessee&#8217;s
Medicaid
program)
is
a
coverage
option
for
you.
If
you
are
one
of
the
millions
of
Americans
who
need
health
insurance,
you
can
sign
up
for
coverage
today
that
will
take
effect
January
1,
2014.
Enrollment
in
the
marketplace
will
remain
open
for
six
months,
but
you
can
go
online
to
www.healthcare.gov
today
to
check
out
your
options.
The
Affordable
Care
Act
is
already
working
for
families
across
the
Ninth
District
and
the
government
shutdown
didn&#8217;t
change
that.
According
to
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services,
147,000
individuals
in
the
district
now
have
health
insurance
that
covers
preventive
services
without
co-pays,
$3.1
million
in
insurance
premiums
have
been
returned
to
consumers,
and
more
than
5,000
seniors
on
Medicare
paid
a
total
of
$5.9
million
less
for
their
prescription
medications
as
we
continue
to
close
the
&#8216;donut
hole.&#8217;
Health
insurance
companies
can
no
longer
discriminate
against
patients
with
pre-existing
conditions
and
young
adults
up
to
age
26
can
now
stay
on
their
parents&#8217;
insurance
plan.
In
recent
weeks,
there
have
been
reports
of
citizens
having
difficulty
successfully
using
the
Marketplace
website.
Many
of
these
reported
problems
have
already
been
resolved
and
there
are
people
working
around
the
clock
to
fix
the
problems
that
remain
on
the
website.
But
the
Marketplace
website
is
only
one
tool
that
you
can
use
to
sign
up
for
coverage.
If
you
are
having
trouble

the
Marketplace

Keeping
More
Newborns
Alive
A
few
days
ago,
the
New
York
Times
ran
a
story
about
one
aspect
of
the
Affordable
Care
Act
that
many
people
don&#8217;t
know
about:
the
landmark
health
care
reform
law
could
help
prevent
the
deaths
of
infants
around
the
country.
Though
our
nation
once
lost
fewer
infants
than
most
other
industrialized
nations,
in
2010
we
fell
behind
most
of
the
industrialized
world .
Because
the
Affordable
Care
Act
now
ensures
broader
access
to
prenatal
care
for
pregnant
women
in
this
country,
many
women
at
higher
risk
of
premature
births&#8212;who
are
often
minorities&#8212;will
have
improved
health
care
and
we
could
see
a
quantifiable
decrease
in
our
nation's
infant
mortality
soon.
The
New
York
Times
story
is
definitely
worth
a
read.
Electronics
Recycling

Next
Friday
between
3
and
6:30
PM,
an
electronics
recycling
drive
will
be
held
at
the
Central
Station
pavilion at
Front
and
G.E.
Patterson.
If
you
have
any
electronics
that
you
need
to
dispose
of
but
that
should
not
be
recycled
or
thrown
in
the
trash
(such
as
computers,
TVs,
cell
phones,
DVDs
and
other
items),
I
hope
you
will
bring
them
to
the
recycling
drive
next
week.
