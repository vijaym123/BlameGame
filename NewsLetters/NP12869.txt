As a fifth
generation Montanan, I deeply value our personal freedoms and am committed
to protecting them. That's why I continue to fight to protect your
privacy and make sure your personal information is not at risk through
federal websites like
healthcare.gov.
My time serving on the Committee on Homeland Security has only
strengthened my belief that taking extra measures to secure personal
information is a critical step in safeguarding our right to privacy.
That's why I helped
introduce
bipartisan
legislation at the beginning of the year that requires the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS) to take the lead in developing cybersecurity
standards for the healthcare.gov
website.
Additionally, I authored an amendment that recently
passed
the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Cybersecurity,
Infrastructure Protection and Security Technologies that expands upon
the security and accountability measures contained in the
Cyber
Awareness and Recovery Enhancement Act . My amendment, which
passed
without any objection and is now included in the
National Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection Act
of 2013 , addresses security risks plaguing the Obamacare
marketplace website and works to ensure that Americans' personal information
is better protected while using any federal website. Specifically, it
requires federal agencies to notify all potential victims of a data
breach involving personally identifiable information within two business
days, and it provides assistance to help these agencies prevent and
respond to such security
breaches.
Though I firmly believe additional protections are needed to safeguard
our personal information, as your voice in Washington I want to hear
from you on this issue. Please take a moment to answer the question
below about my recently passed amendment.
Do you support my amendment
to the National Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection
Act that provides additional security provisions to safeguard personal
information? Yes -
Additional security measures are needed to protect Americans personal
information while using federal websites No - This amendment is unnecessary and no
additional security measures are needed Unsure *By answering this survey, you are subscribing to

Thank you for
sharing your thoughts with me. As your Representative, it is not only
my priority but also my job to represent you and your
interests.
Sincerely,
Washington D.C.
