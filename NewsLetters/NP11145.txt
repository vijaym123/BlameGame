Friends,
In the debut edition of "Martha's Mailbag," I'm answering constituent
questions about the conflict in Ukraine, House efforts to promote
affordable energy, and ObamaCare. You can watch the video below or by
clicking here
.
"Martha's Mailbag" will be a
regular opportunity for me to answer
questions about issues you care about.
You can send in questions about
various issues under debate in Congress or current events, and I will
chose a handful to answer via video from Washington.
You can submit a question in one of the following ways:
*	By posting a question on my Facebook page
;
*	By sending a tweet to @RepMarthaRoby
using the hashtag #MarthasMailbag;
*	Or simply sending me an email by clicking here
.
It has always been one of my top priorities to be accessible to the
people I represent. I am always here to listen to your questions and
concerns. It is my hope that the new "Martha's Mailbag" feature will
only further increase my accessibility and responsiveness to those I
represent.
I look forward to hearing from you,
Washington DC
