Dear
Friend,
As 2014
draws to a close, Id like to
take this chance to reflect on what
weve accomplished together
throughout this past year and to
outline some goals for the year
ahead.
The last
12 months have been remarkably
consequential for Florida and our
nation. Weve seen global
conflicts, world health concerns,
persistent economic hardship at home,
and even a heartbreaking scandal
regarding the treatment of our
nations veterans.
In
addition to confronting these concerns,
I've undertaken an initiative that is
very special to me. I have worked to
advance a bold agenda to restore the
American Dream by tearing down the
barriers between our people and the
promise of the 21st century.
Ive
met a few barriers of my own in the
process, including stubborn
congressional gridlock. But with a new
Republican controlled Senate and a
growing consensus among the American
people that we need a new direction in
Washington, 2015 promises to be an
exciting year.
Below are
some of our many accomplishments over
the past year:
Fighting for Florida:
In July
of this year, my office hosted its
500th mobile office hour event. To
mark this milestone, we released a
report highlighting various stories
that exemplify the work our
constituent service team has done to
assist Floridians with federal
services over the first three and a
half years of my term.
Florida
is home to over one and a half
million heroic veterans. This is why,
as the disturbing truth of rampant
mismanagement and neglect at the
Department of Veterans Affairs was
revealed this year, I led the charge
for the resignation of the VA
Secretary and for meaningful reform
of the departments practices.
I was the original Senate sponsor of
the VA Management Accountability Act
of 2014, which passed the House in
May and was included in the
Senate-passed VA reform legislation
in June.
In the
Coast Guard Reauthorization bill that
was signed into law in December, I
also pushed for a provision that
would make it easier for veterans to
be hired in the maritime industry.
Additionally, the legislation
provided a three-year exemption for
small commercial vessels from
unnecessary EPA regulations. These
measures will help ensure Florida's
maritime industry remains a national
leader in economic opportunity and
job creation.
I was
honored this year to cosponsor a bill
to award the 65th Infantry Regiment
Borinqueneers with the
Congressional Gold Medal, and I stood
in the White House to watch the
President sign it into law in June.
The Borinqueneers were a segregated
Hispanic unit, comprised of mostly
Puerto Rican soldiers, who were not
given the same benefits and honors
awarded to other soldiers despite
their service in World War I, World
War II and the Korean War. Many
surviving Borinqueneers live in
Florida today.
I fought
for educational opportunities for
Floridas families by calling
for an end to the baseless federal
probe into the Florida Bright Futures
Scholarship. In an October op-ed, I
made the case for this vital
scholarship program and explained why
it was a lifeline for
low-income kids. The probe
finally ended in December.
This
year I voted for the Water Resources
Reform and Development Act, which was
a positive step forward for many of
Floridas vital water-related
interests. However, we still have
work to do to reestablish water flows
to Apalachicola Bay and restore the
Everglades. This is why I have
supported future authorization of the
Central Everglades Planning Project
and will continue to explore
legislative solutions to discharges,
especially those impacting the Indian
River Lagoon, which I visited in
June.
After
working with the northwest Florida
Congressional delegation for the past
two years, we secured long-awaited
disaster assistance funding aimed to
restore the oyster fishery in
Apalachicola Bay. This provided
much-needed relief for the small
business owners and families who were
severely impacted by the
drought.
I spent
much of 2014 crafting a comprehensive
agenda to help confront the
challenges preventing many Floridians
and families across America from
accessing the American Dream. To help
summarize these challenges and
outline my solutions, I delivered a
major address in June titled
Finding Economic Security in
an Insecure Time, which told
the real life stories of several
struggling Floridians, including a
single mom, two recent college
graduates, and a family that operates
a small business.
Restoring the American
Dream:
To
confront the complex web of challenges
holding our people back from accessing
the American Dream, I spent this year
proposing reforms in several key policy
areas.
I began
in January by delivering an address
on the 50th Anniversary of President
Johnsons War on Poverty
titled, Reclaiming The Land Of
Opportunity: Conservative Reforms For
Combatting Poverty. In that
speech I said, what I am
proposing today is the most
fundamental change to how the federal
government fights poverty and
encourages income mobility since
President Johnson first conceived of
the War on Poverty fifty years ago. I
propose that we turn
Washingtons anti-poverty
programs
and the trillions
spent on them
over to the
states.
In
February, I delivered a speech
titled, Making Higher
Education Affordable Again,
which confronted the fact that our
current system of higher education
has become too expensive and too
inflexible. The reforms I proposed in
this speech, and began introducing
throughout the year, would make
higher education more affordable,
more accessible, and more attuned to
the needs of our 21st century
economy.
In
March, I spoke at Googles DC
headquarters at an event sponsored by
the Jack Kemp Foundation. My speech
was headlined, Sparking
Dynamic Growth in 21st Century
America, and focused on how to
build a growing, prosperous and
opportunity-rich economy. My
proposals focused on sparking
innovation, opening America to the
opportunities of our global economy,
and making our nation the best place
in the world to invest and create
jobs. Essential to this goal are
several bills related to wireless
innovation that I introduced in
January 2014 and hope to pass through
Congress next year.
In May,
I gave an address titled "A Secure
Retirement for 21st Century Seniors."
I proposed policies to deal with the
fact that Social Security and
Medicare are on a path to insolvency
and that the longer we wait to
address this problem the more
difficult and disruptive the
solutions will become. I proposed
ways to help all Americans save for
retirement, and ways to save Social
Security and Medicare for future
generations without changing benefits
for current seniors.
As part
of my June address titled
Finding Economic Security in
an Insecure Time, I discussed
my vision for a pro-family and
pro-growth tax reform that would help
Americans confront the rising cost of
living. In September, to follow
through on that goal, I partnered
with Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) to
propose a federal tax-reform plan
that would remove obstacles to
investment, innovation, growth and
opportunity.
In July,
I delivered an address at The
Catholic University of America titled
Strong Values for a Strong
America. In this speech, I
made the case that our peoples
social and moral wellbeing is
inextricably connected to their
economic wellbeing. I proposed a few
concrete ideas for how we can work to
strengthen communities and families
so that every child is raised with
love and taught the values of
success.
Promoting American Strength:
In
September, I gave a major address on
rebuilding Americas defense
capabilities. In that speech, I noted
that foreign policy and domestic
policy are connected, and that the
reluctance of our current
administration to engage
constructively in global affairs has
left America weakened and the world
less safe. I discussed specific
measures we need to take in order to
reestablish American Strength.
I
sponsored the Venezuela Defense of
Human Rights and Civil Society Act of
2014, which authorizes sanctions
against human rights violators in
Venezuela and was signed into law in
December. After almost a year of
trying to achieve this important
measure as a response to Nicolas
Maduros violent crackdown on
innocent Venezuelans, I'm glad these
sanctions against corrupt human
rights violators are finally the law.
But we must remain vigilant as a
crumbling Venezuelan economy will put
even more pressure on Maduro's
regime, resulting in even more human
rights abuses.
I have
spoken forcefully against President
Obamas recent and
unconscionable shift in policy toward
Cuba and have vowed to use any and
every tool within my power to stop
it, particularly as incoming Chairman
of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committees Western Hemisphere
subcommittee.
Throughout
this year, I helped lead calls in the
Senate for a coherent administration
strategy for opposing ISIL. In one
notable moment in September, I
pressed Secretary of State John Kerry
on why President Obama had ruled out
using U.S. combat troops to defeat
the terrorist group.
In
January, I went on a week-long trip
to Asia that included visits to
Japan, the Philippines, and South
Korea. As the ranking member of the
Senate Foreign Relations
Committees East Asian and
Pacific Affairs Subcommittee, I had
the opportunity to meet with U.S.
officials and foreign leaders to
discuss critical securityy and
economic issues, including one
involving Florida's citrus industry.
I concluded the trip by delivering a
major foreign policy speech in
Seoul.
This
year I announced legislation to
strengthen Americas commitment
to international religious freedom
and bolster our countrys role
in monitoring and responding to
violations of religious freedom
throughout the world. I also assisted
with legislation to reauthorize the
US Commission on International
Religious Freedom, which passed the
Senate.
Despite
the progress we made in 2014, much work
remains to be done in 2015. As has been
the case now for too many years,
millions of Americans remain out of
work or in jobs below their skill
levels. They have begun to question
whether the American Dream is still an
achievable goal for them. Ensuring that
these Americans have the opportunities
they deserve must be a priority for all
lawmakers in 2015.
Unfortunately,
so many of the bills I proposed this
year toward that end were met with a
wall of stubborn Congressional
gridlock. But 2015 has the potential to
be very different. I hope youll
join me for another year of fighting
for the principles that have always
made America exceptional: a limited
government, a free economy, and equal
opportunity for all.
Thank you,
happy New Year, and may God bless
America,
Marco
