Voting NO on "Clean" DHS
Funding
3/3/15
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn voted against the "clean" bill
funding the Department of Homeland Security and fully funding
immigration agencies.
"I am deeply
disappointed that there was no alternative presented to bringing
forward the so-called "clean" DHS bill that keeps the funding for the
President's lawless amnesty. By capitulating to the demands of Harry
Reid's minority party in the U.S. Senate, we lost our opportunity to take a
firm stand against the lawless executive amnesty of President Obama.
I voted no because I will not go along with the President's unlawful
actions."
- Congressman
Doug Lamborn (CO-05)
