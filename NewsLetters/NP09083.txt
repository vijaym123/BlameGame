Leading the Way on
Increasing Private Sector Care for Our
Veterans
6/4/14
Congressman Doug Lamborn, joined by 35 of his fellow Members of
Congress, sent a letter to Acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson calling for an
immediate increase in fee-basis care for our veterans. This strategy is a
kind of disaster relief for our veterans to help address urgent,
near-term problems while also changing incentives to prevent similar
future scenarios from occurring.
Increasing fee-basis care is a
solution that has been endorsed and supported by the
VFW.
"Fee-basis care can and should
be used to provide medical care to veterans when the VA health system
is overburdened. Unfortunately, one of the reasons that many veterans
are denied access to fee-basis care is that the costs of this
outsourced care is covered out of the budget of each individual VA health
facility. Local and regional VA managers are incentivized to deny veterans'
requests for fee-basis care and keep them locked in the VA health
system, even if that leads to longer wait times for care. Therefore, in
addition to directing immediate and wide-spread access to fee-basis
care for waiting veterans, we ask you to immediately establish a budget
mechanism outside of the existing model to ensure that the local and
regional VA healthcare managers have no incentive to deny veterans
access to fee-basis care."
