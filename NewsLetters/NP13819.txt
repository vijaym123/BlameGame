Update from Congressman Scott Tipton
Dear Friend,
With great foresight, the founders of this nation endeavored to protect
private property from the federal government.
In the West, we know
that this protection extends to privately-held water rights.
Unfortunately, recent history has shown that the federal government is
more than willing to overreach its authority to try and acquire private
water rights, through coercion if necessary.
I was somewhat encouraged that the Forest Service recently acknowledged
their flawed and unnecessary policy, and indicated that its future
water rights clause may no longer require the transfer of
privately-owned water rights. However, it needs to be noted that this
clause has yet to be seen and the agency's comments indicate that we
will only see a temporary fix for one group of water users in a single
region.
The Forest Service's latest policy shift doesn't provide the same level
of protection as the bipartisan Water Rights Protection Act-which is
supported by more than 30 state, local and national stakeholder groups,
including the National Cattlemen's Association, and numerous Colorado
counties, river districts and conservation groups.
The policy shift also falls far short of giving private water users
much certainty, and is the fourth change in Forest Service water policy
for ski areas in the last ten years.
According to the National Ski Areas Association, "These changes are
disruptive, create uncertainty and adversely impact our operations,
planning and future growth. The ski industry can't afford to be
subjected to a different water policy with each Administration. Only
federal legislation can give us the long term protection we need of an
outright statutory prohibition on the taking of our water rights by the
federal government."
Federal attempts to seize private water rights aren't limited to ski
areas. The same tactics have been used by both the Bureau of Land
Management (BLM) and Forest Service in attempts to take or interfere
with private water rights associated with agricultural production in
the heart of rural America where farmers and ranchers rely on their
rights to secure loans and irrigate crops and livestock.
In an October Natural Resources Committee hearing, Tim Lowry, an Oregon
rancher, testified that from almost the moment his family purchased
their ranch, the BLM began attempts to inhibit their ability to utilize
their water rights. After a decade-long legal battle that has racked up
more than $800,000 in legal fees for Lowry, the Idaho Supreme Court
ruled in his favor and against federal attempts to hijack his
privately-held livestock water rights.
We've heard similar stories out of Utah where the Forest Service denied
ranchers access to rangelands for grazing until they transferred their
private water rights, and in Nevada where Forest Service and BLM
employees attempted to violate state law by eliminating livestock
watering rights.
It is unforgivable that the federal government would put people in a
position of choosing between their lawfully acquired property and
financial ruin.
I know for certain that many of the ranchers I
represent can't afford drawn-out and costly legal battles with the
Forest Service and BLM to protect what is rightfully theirs under state
law.
Nor should they have to.
That is why I joined with my colleagues Reps. Mark Amodei (R-NV) and
Jared Polis (D-CO) to introduce the Water Rights Protection Act. This
commonsense bill would protect communities, businesses, recreation
opportunities, farmers and ranchers as well as other individuals that
rely on privately-held water rights for their livelihood from federal
takings.
It would do so by prohibiting federal agencies from confiscating water
rights through the use of permits, leases, and other land management
arrangements. It would provide these vital protections for private
property owners without affecting water allocations for non-federal
parties or allocations that protect the environment.
In order to permanently protect private water rights from federal
takings and provide certainty for all water users, Congress must act
and pass this bipartisan legislation. Water is the lifeblood of the
West, and is vital for Colorado's economic health. I will continue to
work to advance this needed legislation to protect all water users and
ensure that our most precious resource is not subject to the control of
Washington bureaucrats.
Sincerely,
In Case You Missed It

Grand Junction Daily Sentinel: Udall wants energy order to be law: A
presidential order that federal agencies get at least 20 percent of

questioned whether the executive order would do anything to reduce
current or future spending.. Tipton's office said the administration
should focus on ensuring that the federal government's energy use is as
efficient and cost-effective as possible. "The immediate question the
president's new federal renewable standard raises is, how much more is
it going to cost taxpayers who are already in many cases struggling to
pay their own energy bills, let alone an increase in the government's,"
Tipton's office said. Read more

Update
from
Congressman
Scott
Tipton
Dear
Friend,
With
great
foresight,
the
founders
of
this
nation
endeavored
to
protect
private
property
from
the
federal
government.
In
the
West,
we
know
that
this
protection
extends
to
privately-held
water
rights.
Unfortunately,
recent
history
has
shown
that
the
federal
government
is
more
than
willing
to
overreach
its
authority
to
try
and
acquire
private
water
rights,
through
coercion
if
necessary.
I
was
somewhat
encouraged
that
the
Forest
Service
recently
acknowledged
their
flawed
and
unnecessary
policy,
and
indicated
that
its
future
water
rights
clause
may
no
longer
require
the
transfer
of
privately-owned
water
rights.
However,
it
needs
to
be
noted
that
this
clause
has
yet
to
be
seen
and
the
agency&#8217;s
comments
indicate
that
we
will
only
see
a
temporary
fix
for
one
group
of
water
users
in
a
single
region.
The
Forest
Service&#8217;s
latest
policy
shift
doesn&#8217;t
provide
the
same
level
of
protection
as
the
bipartisan
Water
Rights
Protection
Act&#8212;which
is
supported
by
more
than
30
state,
local
and
national
stakeholder
groups,
including
the
National
Cattlemen&#8217;s
Association,
and
numerous
Colorado
counties,
river
districts
and
conservation
groups.
The
policy
shift
also
falls
far
short
of
giving
private
water
users
much
certainty,
and
is
the
fourth
change
in
Forest
Service
water
policy
for
ski
areas
in
the
last
ten
years.
According
to
the
National
Ski
Areas
Association,
&#8220;These
changes
are
disruptive,
create
uncertainty
and
adversely
impact
our
operations,
planning
and
future
growth.
The
ski
industry
can&#8217;t
afford
to
be
subjected
to
a
different
water
policy
with
each
Administration.
Only
federal
legislation
can
give
us
the
long
term
protection
we
need
of
an
outright
statutory
prohibition
on
the
taking
of
our
water
rights
by
the
federal
government.&#8221;
Federal
attempts
to
seize
private
water
rights
aren&#8217;t
limited
to
ski
areas.
The
same
tactics
have
been
used
by
both
the
Bureau
of
Land
Management
(BLM)
and
Forest
Service
in
attempts
to
take
or
interfere
with
private
water
rights
associated
with
agricultural
production
in
the
heart
of
rural
America
where
farmers
and
ranchers
rely
on
their
rights
to
secure
loans
and
irrigate
crops
and
livestock.
In
an
October
Natural
Resources
Committee
hearing,
Tim
Lowry,
an
Oregon
rancher,
testified
that
from
almost
the
moment
his
family
purchased
their
ranch,
the
BLM
began
attempts
to
inhibit
their
ability
to
utilize
their
water
rights.
After
a
decade-long
legal
battle
that
has
racked
up
more
than
$800,000
in
legal
fees
for
Lowry,
the
Idaho
Supreme
Court
ruled
in
his
favor
and
against
federal
attempts
to
hijack
his
privately-held
livestock
water
rights.
We&#8217;ve
heard
similar
stories
out
of
Utah
where
the
Forest
Service
denied
ranchers
access
to
rangelands
for
grazing
until
they
transferred
their
private
water
rights,
and
in
Nevada
where
Forest
Service
and
BLM
employees
attempted
to
violate
state
law
by
eliminating
livestock
watering
rights.
It
is
unforgivable
that
the
federal
government
would
put
people
in
a
position
of
choosing
between
their
lawfully
acquired
property
and
financial
ruin.
I
know
for
certain
that
many
of
the
ranchers
I
represent
can&#8217;t
afford
drawn-out
and
costly
legal
battles
with
the
Forest
Service
and
BLM
to
protect
what
is
rightfully
theirs
under
state
law.
Nor
should
they
have
to.
That
is
why
I
joined
with
my
colleagues
Reps.
Mark
Amodei
(R-NV)
and
Jared
Polis
(D-CO)
to
introduce
the
Water
Rights
Protection
Act.
This
commonsense
bill
would
protect
communities,
businesses,
recreation
opportunities,
farmers
and
ranchers
as
well
as
other
individuals
that
rely
on
privately-held
water
rights
for
their
livelihood
from
federal
takings.
It
would
do
so
by
prohibiting
federal
agencies
from
confiscating
water
rights
through
the
use
of
permits,
leases,
and
other
land
management
arrangements.
It
would
provide
these
vital
protections
for
private
property
owners
without
affecting
water
allocations
for
non-federal
parties
or
allocations
that
protect
the
environment.
In
order
to
permanently
protect
private
water
rights
from
federal
takings
and
provide
certainty
for
all
water
users,
Congress
must
act
and
pass
this
bipartisan
legislation.
Water
is
the
lifeblood
of
the
West,
and
is
vital
for
Colorado&#8217;s
economic
health.
I
will
continue
to
work
to
advance
this
needed
legislation
to
protect
all
water
users
and
ensure
that
our
most
precious
resource
