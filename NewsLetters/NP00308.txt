Protecting Our Coal Industry
The War on Coal is real
and it is devastating West Virginia. President Obamas onslaught of
regulations has brought the coal industry to its knees. His extreme
environmental policies are bankrupting coal companies, laying off thousands
of miners and coal workers, and shutting down coal-fired power plants.
West Virginia families deserve better than these bullying tactics
from the EPA.
There is still a future for this safe, reliable,
and efficient source of energy; and I intend to fight to protect our
coal industry from unfair regulations. You deserve peace of mind that
the government will not destroy your community just to pursue a
dangerous ideology.

on Coal

Energy Secretary Moniz about the recent layoffs by clicking below:
Letter to Gov. Tomblin: Dont
Help EPA Kill Jobs
This week, I led a letter
along with Reps. Mooney and Jenkins urging Governor Tomblin not to be
complicit in the EPAs damaging rules for coal power plants. The
letter lays out the threats to West Virginias economy from the proposed
rule. Our Governor and state government should not comply with this
attack on our coal industry, and I call on him to fight these destructive
regulations.
You may read the letter

Connect the
Dots
What do the Empire State Building and ping-pong balls have to do with
EPA regulations? I wrote an op-ed this week about how the EPA gets away
with destructive new regulations by hiding the costs and hyping the
benefits.
Please read it
here
and
forward to your relatives, friends, and neighbors so they can connect the
dots on regulations too!
Fighting Unfair Trade
Practices
Small manufacturers and businesses
across the First District are constantly struggling to compete with
illegal and unfair competition from China and other countries. Yet when
they file claims against large, state-supported companies they are at a
distinct disadvantage. Thats why I offered an amendment to give these
businesses the tools they need to level the playing field. The
amendment passed the House this week with bipartisan
support.
Watch my speech on the amendment here:
Standing up for Rural
Hospitals
Medicaid is an important program for many West Virginians. It is vital
that hospitals who serve the poor and vulnerable in our state can
focus on delivering care. Instead, Medicaid administrators have begun
threatening intrusive audits of hospitals delivering critical care in
rural areas.

officials in charge of the audits:
Have a great week,
