Dear Friend,
As consumers, we are all looking
for ways to save money and find the best price.
For most
products, competition among different suppliers and access to good
information allows consumers to compare prices and find a good deal.
This is not the case with prescription medicines for household
pets.
That is why I introduced a bipartisan bill with fellow Utahn
Jason Chaffetz that makes sure pet owners are given the opportunity to
find the best price for their pet medicines.
Even if this bill does
not become law this year, it is important that you and your family
are educated consumers and can realize savings if you
choose.
Veterinarians do a wonderful job of caring for our pets, but
they are not required give pet owners a copy of a prescription when they
prescribe medication.
Most pet owners purchase prescription pet
medications from their veterinarian without knowing that they could
also purchase those medications at a pharmacy or online.
Without
the ability to compare prices,
Consumer Reports
estimates consumers are paying 100% to 1,019% more for medications when
they buy them at the veterinarians office.
Our bill
simply requires veterinarians to provide a prescription to the pet
owner.
At that point, the owner would still have the choice to buy the
pet medication from the veterinarian, or to go elsewhere. This is not
a unique concept
it took federal legislation to require eye care
professionals to provide a written prescription to consumers so they
would have a choice of where to purchase contact lenses.
The result
of that legislation is that prices for contact lenses dropped
significantly and consumers are far better off today.
Veterinarians
have expressed concerns with my legislation because they say
consumers need to be instructed on the proper use of prescription pet
medications.
My response is that the veterinarian should provide that
information to anyone to whom he provides a prescription, just like
medical doctors do for humans, regardless of where the medication is
actually purchased.
I know this is not the most significant
issue we face in Washington these days, but I believe it is always
important to stand up for consumer interests and make sure our economy works
in a transparent way.
And with
62% of all
American households owning pets , this issue affects a significant
number of people.
I am proud to sponsor this bill, and am
honored to serve in Congress on behalf of Utah families like yours.
As your representative, I always appreciate hearing from you on current
topics and issues affecting you and our community.
Please let
me know areas you find especially interesting or where I can provide
you with additional information.
I value your ideas and look
forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
U.S. Representative
