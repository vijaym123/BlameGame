First the bad (ok, TERRIFYING) news:
The Huffington Post just reported that a single right-wing mega donor cut Karl Rove&rsquo;s group a check for
$1O,OOO,OOO.OO .
That means Rove can blast TVs across the country with Obama-bashing ads. Here&rsquo;s the good (ok, AMAZING) news: After President Obama&rsquo;s email this morning, a group of Democratic supporters have agreed to TRIPLE-MATCH ALL GIFTS until midnight.
David, we can&rsquo;t throw away this opportunity.
David Johnson ANSWERED PRESIDENT OBAMA'S CALL TO ACTION? no donation
We need you to stop what you&rsquo;re doing, answer President Obama&rsquo;s request, and help us stop Republicans from buying this election with their secret right-wing money.
ALL GIFTS TODAY TRIPLE-MATCHED! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
No regrets!
