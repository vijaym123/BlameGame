URGENT:
Boehner&rsquo;s Republicans just rammed through a rule that could devastate Social Security.
On a straight party line vote, the GOP voted to undermine Social Security -- potentially threatening the benefits of 11 MILLION disabled workers.
We can&rsquo;t let Republicans get away with this. David -- will you sign our petition and help us reach 100,000 strong demanding Congress protect Social Security?
