House Votes to End Taxpayer
Funding for Abortion
On Tuesday, I joined my House colleagues in voting to pass H.R. 7,
the
No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act . It is time for
Congress to stand up for the most vulnerable while respecting the
consciences of millions of Americans.
While speaking in
favor of the bill on the House floor, I had the opportunity to
give my perspective on the sanctity of life from my personal
experience as a father . When my wife and I were expecting our first
child, a son, we were awed to feel him kicking in the womb as he
responded to my voice and touch. I realized then that I had been silent on
the issue of life for far too long.
As a Christian and
the father of two children, I wholeheartedly affirm the sanctity of life
for every human being. In Congress, I will continue to defend each
life as a precious gift from God.

Farm Bill Passes House
This week, the House
passed the final conference agreement to H.R. 2642, the
Federal
Agriculture Reform and Risk Management (FARRM) Act of
2013 .
This Farm Bill is the first significant reform to mandatory
spending in more than three years, estimated by the Congressional Budget
Office (CBO) to save our nation more than $16 billion over 10 years.
Though I encouraged House leadership and the House Agriculture Committee
to include more conservative reforms, I do believe this bill is a step
in the right direction. The people of the 11th District agree, as
constituents polled prior to the vote supported passage of this
legislation three to one.
While closing loopholes in the food
stamp program to save $8 billion, the bill also eliminates or consolidates
more than 100 U.S. Department of Agriculture programs and replaces
outdated direct subsidies for farmers with a strengthened crop insurance
program. Of particular importance to Western North Carolina, it also
reauthorizes
PILT
(Payment in Lieu of Taxes)
through 2014. Knowing that PILT impacts every county in my district,
I went directly to Speaker Boehner and asked him to reauthorize this
program when it recently expired. He followed through on my request by
including PILT in this legislation, and these annual payments will go
out as scheduled in June.
Our nation must prioritize both
national security and food security. Undermining the American farmer
and becoming dependent on foreign sources of food can be as dangerous
as depending on foreign countries for oil. I will continue to work
toward incorporating conservative reforms to our nations agriculture and
nutrition policy while ensuring that our farmers receive the
long-term certainty they deserve.
Quick Reflection on the State of the
Union
Click here to
watch my interview with News 14 Carolina prior to the 2014 State of the
Union .
In his sixth State of the Union address,
President Obama pledged to make 2014 a "Year of Action." Though he made
it clear that he plans to pursue his own agenda with or without
Congress, I am willing to work with him on any solutions that will actually
create jobs for hardworking Americans and grow our economy. With 40
jobs bills passed by the House sitting idly in the Senate coupled with
an unacceptably high unemployment rate, a simple phone call from the
President could be the action needed to put people back to
work.
Committee
Update
On Wednesday, the
House Foreign Affairs
Committee
passed H.R. 938. This bill, which I co-sponsored, declares
Israel to be a major strategic partner of the United States and
strengthens the alliance between our two nations.
The
House
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee
has begun hearings on
legislation authorizing the development of our nation's highways and
infrastructure.
On the
House Oversight and Government
Reform Committee , we continue our investigations into Benghazi,
the IRS targeting scandal, and Obamacare's disastrous
implementation.
