A New Congress
Earlier this week, the 114th Congress began and with it a Republican
majority in both the United States Senate and the United States House
of Representatives.
With our new role comes a number of important
responsibilities to help the American people.
I'm definitely humbled
by this chance to help struggling middle-class South Carolinians and
all Americans who are clearly frustrated by an increasing lack of
opportunity, the stagnation of wages, and a government that seems
incapable of performing even basic tasks.
School Choice Week
I have long been an advocate for school choice in the United States
Senate because I can personally attest to the power of education in my
own life.
So as my first measure in the new Congress, I filed a
resolution supporting "National School Choice Week."
I am proud that I
was able to lead a group of senators to designate the week of January
25 through January 31, 2015 as "National School Choice Week."
Later this month, I plan to also reintroduce my Creating Hope and
Opportunity for Individuals and Communities through Education (CHOICE)
Act and host a significant event supporting school choice in early
February.
You can learn more about my resolution HERE
.
Keystone XL Pipeline
I believe that approving the Keystone XL Pipeline will provide
opportunity not only to address the topic of energy, but to
specifically address issues faced by millions and millions of Americans
- unemployment and energy poverty.
Now that Republicans are in the
majority, I look forward to tackling this issue head on, something the
last Congress was unwilling to do.
Last year, I released a white paper
on energy poverty
with Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), the new
Chairwoman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
Hire More Heroes
This week I also co-sponsored the "Hire More Heroes Act." It is aimed
at encouraging companies to hire more American veterans.
Our brave men
and women in uniform shouldn't be hindered from good employment
opportunities when they return home because of Obamacare and its
burdensome mandates on employers. The Hire More Heroes Act is a common
sense piece of legislation that will ensure that the healthcare our
veterans receive through TRICARE or the VA is not counted toward the
Obamacare employer mandate threshold, which will help encourage small
businesses to hire more veterans.
Visitors from Home
When I need to be in Washington for legislative duties, it is always a
pleasure to see people from home.
Southern hospitality reaches all the
way up to Washington, D.C., and we enjoy visiting with the school
groups, families, and individuals who join us for Palmetto Wednesdays
or come by the office to say hello.
If you will be in Washington, be
sure to let us know at (202) 224-6121 and feel free to come on by!
I appreciate the opportunity to serve as your United States Senator.
Please do not hesitate to contact my office if we can ever be of
service to you.
Sincerely,
Tim Scott

Earlier

the

and
with

a

I
have

for
school

in
the
United

because
I
can

So
as

I

Keystone
XL
Pipeline
I
believe
that
approving
the
Keystone
XL
Pipeline
will
provide
opportunity
not
only
to
address
the
topic
of
energy,
but
to
specifically
address
issues
faced
by
millions
and
millions
of
Americans
&#8211;
unemployment
and
energy
poverty.
Now
that
Republicans
are
in
the
majority,
I
look
forward
to
tackling
this
issue
head
on,
something
the
last
Congress
was
unwilling
to
do.
Last
year,
I
released
a
white
paper
on
energy
poverty
with
Senator
Lisa
Murkowski
(R-AK),
the
new
Chairwoman
of
the
Senate
Energy
and
Natural
Resources
Committee.

I

is
aimed
at
encouraging

to
hire

American

which
will
