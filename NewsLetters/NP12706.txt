News from Representative Randy Neugebauer
February 3, 2014
Holding the President Accountable
President Obama declared a pen and a phone
were all he needed to push his
political agenda.
Then at the State of the Union last week he
reaffirmed that he "won't wait"
for Congress, and will act alone "wherever and whenever"
he can.
But our Founding Fathers put a lot of work into crafting our
Constitution, and they included checks and balances for a reason.
What the President doesn't seem to want to remember is that they also
included Congressional oversight and the ability to check an
overreaching Executive.
I won't stand by and watch the President
unilaterally push his liberal agenda with no regard to our
Constitution.
That's why I'm fighting for the Stop This Overreaching
Presidency (STOP) Resolution
that directs the House
to hold President Obama legally responsible for trying to circumvent
Congress when it suits his political purposes.
Completing the Farm Bill
After years of research, multiple drafts, and lots of hard work, I'm
proud that the House passed a five year Farm Bill
last week.
This week the Senate is expected to vote, and soon our nation's farmers
- and American taxpayers - will see the benefits of the new
market-based reforms included in this Farm Bill.
Here's what West Texans need to know: we're saving taxpayer dollars and
actually reducing the deficit by $23 billion.
We're eliminating direct
payments which weren't tied to actual production, and we're
strengthening crop insurance for when our producers hit hard times.
We're helping ensure farmers invest in their own risk management.
Although I would have liked to close more loopholes in nutrition
assistance, the loopholes we were able to close will save taxpayers a
total of $8 billion, and we're starting pilot programs in 10 states to
get people back to work and off of food stamps.
I also hoped to end
the government's involvement in marketing products, but we'll just have
to keep working on reforming the trade-distorting COOL regulations
moving forward.
It's been a long journey for this Farm Bill.
I'm pleased the final
outcome provides America's farmers and ranchers with the certainty they
need and deserve.
Action Item: Voting to Serve our Veterans
Our men and women in uniform sacrifice a lot for our nation.
Tonight,
I'll vote to strengthen our commitment to our troops to honor their
service.
The GI Bill Tuition Fairness Act
will help provide our soldiers with the tools they need
to successfully transition back into civilian life.
Under this bill,
all veterans will qualify to pay in-state tuition across America - in
all of the 50 states they've worked so hard to defend.
It will allow
them to choose the best school for them without having to worry about
high costs.
Our veterans deserve the very best, and this is a small
step to show our appreciation for their sacrifice.
Thank you,
P.S. I want to apologize to those of you who haven't received the
Roundup these past few weeks.
The House server experienced some
technical glitches in January, but now we have fixed our system.
