Dear Friend,
2,145 days. Thats more than 5
years. Over half a decade - thats how long President Obama has been reviewing the Keystone XL pipeline application. The Founding Fathers of the United States of America drafted and ratified the Constitution in less than a year.
The U.S. is currently experiencing an energy renaissance. The economies of towns and states across the nation are benefitting from increased production of our natural resources. Private companies, small and large, are investing in big ways around the country. They are capitalizing on fine-tuned technologies that are turning previously unreachable energy reserves into fuel for our cars, homes and manufacturing facilities. Were on a path to energy independence from Middle Eastern countries, but we need the presidents support.
The Keystone XL pipeline could play an important role in reducing our need for overseas energy sources if the president would just approve the application. Keystone XL would bring nearly one million barrels of oil per day from Canada to U.S. refineries. In addition to being a new source of energy from our largest trading partner, the pipeline would create thousands of jobs during construction. Keystone XL makes sense for so many reasons. Remember January of 2009 when the price for a gallon of gas was $1.84? Approval will help the price at the pump!
The U.S. House of Representatives has acted numerous times over the last 3
years to push this project forward - unfortunately, those efforts have been halted by the Administration and Senate. Ill continue to support the approval of this project even though others are standing idly by.
God Bless,
Gregg Harper
Member of Congress
