Rep. Bob Goodlatte
Unconstitutional
Immigration Actions Must Be Stopped
Reading the Constitution isn&rsquo;t something
many Americans do on a daily basis. However, in light of President Obama&rsquo;s announcement that he will act unilaterally to change our immigration
laws and shield five million unlawful immigrants from immigration enforcement, perhaps we should take a look at our founding document for a refresher.
Article 1 Section 1 of the Constitution states that &ldquo;All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United
States.&rdquo;
The Congress, not the President, has the power to legislate.
It&rsquo;s both perplexing and alarming that the President has decided to move forward with executive actions on immigration that
he has
said on numerous occasions
that he didn&rsquo;t have the
constitutional power to take. The President&rsquo;s decision to recklessly forge ahead with a plan to change our immigration laws on his own ignores
the will of the American people and completely disregards the Constitution.
The American people are deeply concerned about the direction of our country, and they went to the polls earlier this month to overwhelmingly reject
the Obama Administration&rsquo;s policies. I&rsquo;ve heard these concerns when traveling throughout the Sixth District. Rather than listen to the
American people and change course, President Obama is going rogue, doubling-down, and driving full speed towards a constitutional crisis. By assuming
legislative power and ignoring the limitations placed on his authority, he threatens to unravel our government&rsquo;s system of checks and balances
and endangers individual liberty. These actions also do very little to build the public&rsquo;s trust of his presidency
Additionally,
the President&rsquo;s shortsighted
actions further set back any chance of
enacting immigration reform. Democrats and Republicans alike can agree
that we have a broken immigration
system and it must be fixed. The
debate in Congress over the past two years has shown that there is a
willingness and need to reform our
nation&rsquo;s immigration system.
While
there are varying opinions on how to amend our immigration laws, one
thing is clear: the President
does not have the authority to change our
immigration laws by executive decree.
It&rsquo;s disappointing that President
Obama has refused
to work with the new men and women Americans elected
to represent them in Congress.
Ours is not a &ldquo;my way or the highway&rdquo;
system of government. That&rsquo;s just not the way it works. The Executive
Branch
does not have the power to bypass the Congress and the American
people to legislate by executive order. Since the President has acted
outside the
confines of his authority, I will work with my colleagues in
both the House and the Senate to stop the President&rsquo;s unconstitutional
actions
from being implemented.
For more on executive action on immigration:
On Wednesday, I joined House
Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) in
sending a
letter
to President Obama demanding that he abandon his unconstitutional plan to act unilaterally on immigration. You might also want to

in the
Wall Street Journal
on these executive actions.
Saturday is
National Adoption Day
Thank you to the many families in Virginia and across the nation who have given adopted
children the greatest gift -- a loving family to call their own. Adoption offers a wonderful opportunity to bring together children with caring,
supportive parents. Additionally, there are several great organizations throughout the Sixth District that are helping families with adoption. I've
had the opportunity to visit many of them, and I am grateful for their work. However, more than 100,000 children are in foster care today and are
looking for a home.

In Case You Missed It: Chairing the House Judiciary Committee
This week,
I was re-elected by the House Republican Conference to
continue serving
as Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.
It is an honor to serve you in this role. In the 114th Congress, I intend to build on the good work of the Committee over the past two years and will
continue to pursue a pro-growth agenda that is focused on creating jobs and making America more competitive and free.
Enjoyed attending the groundbreaking of Gleaning for the World today!
