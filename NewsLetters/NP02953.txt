Congresswoman
Jackie Walorski
Representing the 2nd District
February 06, 2015
Weekly Recap - February 6,
2015
This week, the president unveiled his budget proposal to Congress.
I
voiced
my concerns that this plan overspends
&amp; never balances. I am committed to working with my House
colleagues to stop reckless spending &amp; ensure our future generations &amp;
business arent burdened with a soaring deficit.
I also
voted to repeal Obamacare &amp; protect Americans who were given false
promises on keeping their health insurance. The Affordable Care Act
stifles job creation, prevents our economy from growing, &amp; unfairly
increases insurance premiums for millions of Americans. You deserve
better &amp; Ill keep working to craft solutions to reform our healthcare
system.
