Dear Friend,
The Massachusetts Legislature just raised the Commonwealth&rsquo;s minimum wage. It&rsquo;s now the highest in the nation, and despite Tea Party predictions to the contrary, our economy has not collapsed. In fact, it&rsquo;s thriving.
It&rsquo;s long past time for Capitol Hill to learn a thing or two from Beacon Hill.
But the federal minimum wage hasn&rsquo;t been touched for five long years -- that&rsquo;s five years without a raise or even a cost-of-living adjustment for 3.55 million Americans . Minimum wage workers have been trying to climb into the middle class, but no matter how hard or how many jobs they work, they&rsquo;re stuck, because the minimum wage is stuck. And if the Tea Party picks up six Senate seats this fall, there&rsquo;s no telling how much longer those 3.55 million people will have to wait. Help us stay strong against the Tea Party and continue our push for a higher minimum wage -- give $5 today.

American corporations are doing very, very well since the economic crash of 2008. So are the top 1% of earners, who control a larger share of the national wealth than at any time since the 1920s.
The middle- and working class, on the other hand, are not doing so well.
The same people who suffered the most when Wall St. wrecked the economy haven&rsquo;t shared in the gains we&rsquo;ve seen since then.
And as long as the Tea Party continues to hold back any progress, that&rsquo;s not likely to change. But you can help change that. Make a $5 contribution and keep the Senate out of the Tea Party&rsquo;s hands.
We know that raising the federal minimum wage would create approximately 85,000 new jobs and grow the economy by about $22 billion. This shouldn&rsquo;t be a partisan issue. But everything is a partisan issue for the Tea Party -- and we need to fight back.
Thanks for your support.
