Rep. Bruce Braley -- Iowa's First
District
David,
Our nation's wounded warriors, especially those with multiple severe
injuries, deserve everything we can do to make sure they are treated
fairly upon their return home.
That's why I'm proud to introduce the Taylor Morris Act, named after
the Cedar Falls-native who was severely injured by an IED while
clearing a path for his Army Special Forces team in Afghanistan in May
2012. Taylor is now living as a quadruple amputee.
Current compensation for injuries sustained in combat is capped at
$100,000, meaning that a servicemember with two amputated limbs
receives the same payment as a servicemember who has lost all four
limbs -- despite the much greater financial hardship and longer
recovery. This legislation would remove that cap so payments are more
appropriate to the injuries sustained.

Taylor Morris
Taylor is one of the bravest men I've ever met and I'm honored to name
this bill after him.
And the fact that more servicemembers are surviving severe injuries due
to immediate medical treatment is a great development, but this cap
just isn't fair to our injured veterans and needs to be eliminated.
If you have any questions or comments about this important legislation,
please feel free to contact me at any time.
All the best,
Bruce
