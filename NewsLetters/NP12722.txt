Dear Friends,
Thank you for the opportunity to update you on the work
of the 113th Congress. I trust this finds you and your family
well.
PILT (Payements
in Lieu of Taxes):
The Federal payments in
lieu of taxes (PILT) program is vital to Utah's 2nd Congressional
District, as much of the lands in rural Utah are federally owned and unable
to be taxed by the state or counties. Last year alone, it
provided $35 million to counties in Utah. I worked extremely hard for
the last several weeks to ensure that the PILT program would be funded
and was happy to see its funding included in the FARM bill which
recently passed Congress. I will continue to do all in my power to fight for
the issues that are important to you. Make sure to
contact my office
if there are issues affecting your family or
communities.
State
of the Union Address:
Last
week, much of the country was focused on Washington, D.C.
for
President Obama's State of the Union
Address.
Unfortunately, I think the president missed an opportunity in
his speech. Instead of setting a tone of legislative bipartisanship in
2014, he chose to outline an aggressive political agenda full of
unilateral executive actions. The President needs to work with Congress,
not around Congress.
As I wrote in an
op-ed for the Deseret
News , 'When a president vilifies the other party, we can be sure
gridlock will follow. But when the president expresses a willingness to
find common ground, the other party often
reciprocates. Unfortunately, President Obama doesn't have a great track record on working
with Congress'. For my full reaction to the speech,

event, check my

STOP Resolution:
The next day, I
joined some of my
House colleagues in a press conference, urging President Obama to
stop his congressional overreach, which goes against
his constitutionally mandated authority, and isn't a recipe for creating trust
and good will in Congress. In response to the president's
actions, I have co-sponsored the
STOP Resolution ,
which directs the House to institute legal action to require the
President to comply with the law.

I
was also interviewed
by the
Politico Newspaper , which wrote a great
special report on this topic.
