Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
Thirteen years ago, the world watched in horror as innocent Americans were targeted by heinous and cowardly acts of terror. None of us who watched those attacks unfold will ever forget where we were that day. We remember those who have fallen, commemorate the bravery of our first responders, and honor those who have sacrificed to continually protect us from threats of those who still wish to do us harm.
Those who fear freedom chose to use terror as a weapon on that mournful day and still seek to even now. So we remain ever vigilant, armed with weapons of might and the eternal hope of freedom, as that is the price of liberty. Our great country is, and always will be, the shining example to all the world of what can be achieved when liberty and justice for all are cherished above all else.

This week, I was honored to help assemble care packs for our wounded, ill, and injured service members as part of the USO Service Project on Capitol Hill. On Friday, I stopped by the Camaraderie Foundation to thank Michael and Marnie Waldrop, and the
Camaraderie team for
their incredible work to serve veterans and help them heal from the invisible wounds of war. We owe our veterans a debt of gratitude that we can never repay, and I am so grateful for organizations like these who are serving the men and women who have sacrificed so much for us.

On Monday, it was a privilege to keynote the Homeless Veterans Summit in Polk County and thank the community leaders and service organizations who are partnering together to serve our veterans. I shared with them what we are doing both locally and federally to support those who have served and offered my services as a member of the U.S. Congress as we seek to show our gratitude and work in a manner worthy of their sacrifices.

Central Florida has benefited so much from the services of charitable organizations like Habitat for Humanity and City Year Orlando. I have been privileged to work alongside those organizations and see some of the great results that they have achieved. AmeriCorp, who has worked alone side Habitat for Humanity and is the parent organization of City Year, celebrated their 20th anniversary this week, I was pleased to tape a video tribute in thanks and recognition of their service to our community.

Each member of Congress gets an opportunity to invite a local pastor to the Capitol as their Guest Chaplain. This week, Pastor Cliff Lea from the First Baptist Church of Leesburg went to Washington and opened the House of Representatives in prayer. Pastor Lea went to Seminary with Congressman James Lankford and I hosted both for lunch. The First Baptist Church of Leesburg is involved in extensive outreach programs that serve our North Lake community.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
Recently, a constituent from Leesburg was having trouble receiving his travel pay reimbursement related to his treatment at the VA Medical Center.
My office submitted an inquiry to the VA on his behalf and received information that we relayed to the veteran. While the initial response was helpful, the constituent still had some questions regarding back appointments that had not yet been covered.
My staff followed back up with the VA and they were able to provide a more detailed list and synopsis of the constituents current balance and status.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.

Legislative Update:
Obamacare has failed to deliver on many of its namesakes soundbite promises from day one. Perhaps the biggest broken promise was the Presidents infamous declaration that If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan. Period. This claim was found to be so misleading and outright false that it was deemed the Lie of the Year by the nonpartisan fact checker, PolitiFact.
The simple truth is that millions of Americans lost their health care plan because of Obamacare. While most of these cancellations were limited to the individual market, millions of Americans who get their health care insurance through their employer face the same fate in the coming months.
This week, I voted in support of the Employee Health Protection Act, which ensures that American workers can keep their current health plan if they like it. The bill also expands freedom for small businesses to access more affordable health care options that best serve their employees.
For too many, Obamacare has resulted in cancelled plans, lost doctors or higher premiums and out of pocket expenses. Instead of a government overreach, we need health care solutions that deliver the care you need, from the doctor you choose, at a price you can afford.
