HERE TO HELP YOU!
Constituent services continue to be my first and foremost focus. From
helping our local veterans with access to VA healthcare to cutting
through the bureaucratic red-tape at the Social Security
Administration, my staff and I are ready to assist people who have
problems with the federal government. Please refer to the "Serving You"
section of my website for services my office can
provide. (Reminder: All casework and personal information is protected
under federal privacy laws.)
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
This week the Senate approved a bipartisan, fully-paid extension of
temporary unemployment benefits. Immediately after that vote I and
several of my colleagues called on the House to consider the bill or
similar legislation to help those in greatest need in South Jersey. You
can read our letter here
. Next week I will join local residents
negatively affected by the expiration of unemployment benefits to
discuss the latest developments as well as the lack of job
opportunities and economic recovery that underscores the need for the
extension.
LATEST NEWS
Interested in a committee hearing I'm participating in but not able to
travel to Washington? You can often watch proceedings from the House
Armed Services Committee
and the House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee
live online. Check out their respective sites for
upcoming events and look for updates on my Facebook
and @RepLoBiondo on Twitter
.(Note: Most hearings in the House Permanent Select
Committee on Intelligence are closed to the public due to classified
information.)
SOUTH JERSEY "HOT PIC"
I recently held my 11th enrollment clinic for veterans seeking to
access the VA's healthcare system and other benefits they are entitled
too. The attendance in Vineland underscored to VA officials on hand
that there remains significant need in our region from our veterans. I
will continue to host more clinics and work for more community-based
healthcare services in South Jersey. See the Veterans Page
on my website.
