Conaway Chronicle: Defunding Obama's Amnesty Plan, Upcoming Town Hall Meeting,
Runnels County 4-H, Mineral Wells Welcome Sign

Thank you for reading The Conaway Chronicle, a review of my activities in Congress.
Vote to End the Presidents Illegal Amnesty Plan
Last November, President Obama wrongly granted amnesty to as many as five million illegal immigrants through an unlawful executive action. His decision to circumvent the proper legislative process was not the right way to handle this, and the President himself even admitted that he did not have the legal authority to act on immigration in this way. I made a promise to my constituents that one of the first things we would do this Congress would be to prevent the Presidents unconstitutional executive action from becoming our nations new immigration policy. This week, the House of Representatives passed legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security for the remainder of the fiscal year, and defund the Presidents illegal amnesty plan.
This legislation also provides Customs and Border Protection with enough funding to support the greatest number of Border Patrol agents and officers that we have ever seen, and provides them with the technologies they need to ensure the surveillance of air, land and sea approaches to our border. The Coast Guard will also be protected from the cuts proposed by the President that would have greatly harmed operational abilities, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement will see an increase in funding for detention programs and resources to investigate criminal activity. This bill prioritizes spending in a way that will ultimately help protect our country. It is imperative that the Senate now pass this legislation to stop the Presidents unconstitutional actions and to give the needed support to the men and women who protect our borders.

Mineral Wells Welcome Sign
Visitors to Mineral Wells, Texas have been greeted with this welcome sign since 1922. The sign was donated to Mineral Wells by George Holmgren, President of the Texas Rotary Club, to thank the city for their hospitality at its State Convention that year. It was built in San Antonio at Holmgren's Iron Works before being brought to Mineral Wells. It originally required many light bulbs to keep it lit at night, but those were later replaced with red neon lights. In 1972, the sign was moved from East Mountain to the east side of Bald Mountain, and it is kept illuminated by flood lights at its base. This picture from 1929 also shows a lookout tower atop the mountain, which was destroyed by a tornado in 1930.

Sincerely,
Rep. Mike Conaway, 11th District
