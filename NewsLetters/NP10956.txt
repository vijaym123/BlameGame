Since 1998, the Department of Commerce has exercised control over the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a private, non-profit organization that manages basic functions of the Internet.
Earlier this month, however, the administration
announced
its intent to relinquish control of ICANN to the global Internet community.
In 2012, the House and Senate unanimously passed resolutions expressing the sense of Congress that the administration should maintain the United States support of a global Internet free from government control, and work to preserve and advance the multi-stakeholder model that governs the Internet today.
