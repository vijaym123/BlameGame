Dear Neighbors,
Rep. Tammy Duckworth meets with local manufacturers in the 8th District
It is important to work together to get things done. I am proud to say
that this strategy has helped bring innovation and manufacturing
advantages to the Chicagoland area.
Earlier this week, UI Labs in Chicago received a $70 million federal
grant for a Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute. The
institute will allow manufacturing and software companies to develop
interoperable software and hardware for digital manufacturing supply
chains, reduce manufacturing costs, and accelerate the development of
existing technologies so that Illinois can be the go-to market for new
products. It will also increase the 8th District's manufacturing
capacity, allowing companies like Northrop Grumman, ACME Finishing
Company and L3 Communications to thrive.
I worked closely with Illinois' Congressional Delegation to engage the
Department of Defense, University of Illinois, Northern Illinois
University, Harper College, College of DuPage, Northwestern University
and 8thDistrict manufacturers during the grant application process.
Together, they secured this $70 million federal grant and the numerous
jobs, innovation, and economic growth it will bring to the region.
Our businesses, educators, and STEM talent will lead the digital
manufacturing revolution. UI Labs will dramatically reduce the time and
cost it takes to design, source, and manufacture spare parts for
equipment, lower risk and cost for the 8thDistrict's smaller- and
medium-sized businesses who wish to compete in the digital
manufacturing industry, and create high wage jobs and new business
growth.
I am proud that our region and manufacturers in Illinois' 8th District
are leading the way in strengthening American innovation. This
establishment of a Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation (DMDI)
Institute will continue to strengthen our position as a global leader
in manufacturing and cutting-edge technology.
Sincerely,
Tammy Duckworth
Member of Congress

By

it
will
take
priority
over
the

in
the

Dear
Neighbors,
Rep.
Tammy
Duckworth
meets
with
local
manufacturers
in
the
8th
District
It
is
important
to
work
together
to
get
things
done.
I
am
proud
to
say
that
this
strategy
has
helped
bring
innovation
and
manufacturing
advantages
to
the
Chicagoland
area.
Earlier
this
week,
UI
Labs
in
Chicago
received
a
$70
million
federal
grant
for
a
Digital
Manufacturing
and
Design
Innovation
Institute.
The
institute
will
allow
manufacturing
and
software
companies
to
develop
interoperable
software
and
hardware
for
digital

supply
chains,
reduce
manufacturing

and

the

of

that
Illinois
can

the
go-to
market
for

will
also
increase
the
8 th
District&#8217;s
manufacturing
capacity,
allowing
companies
like
Northrop
Grumman,
ACME

and

to
thrive.
I
worked
closely
with
Illinois&#8217;
Congressional
Delegation
to
engage
the
Department
of
Defense,
University
of
Illinois,
Northern
Illinois

Harper

and
8 th District
manufacturers
during
the
grant
application
process.
Together,
they
secured
this
$70

and
the
numerous

it
will
bring
to
the
region.
Our
businesses,
educators,
and
STEM
talent
will
lead
the
digital
manufacturing
revolution.
UI
Labs
will
dramatically
reduce
the
time
and
cost
it
takes
to
design,
source,
and
manufacture
spare
parts
for
equipment,
lower
risk
and

who
wish
to

growth.
I
am
proud
that
our

are
leading
the
way
in
strengthening
American
innovation.
This
