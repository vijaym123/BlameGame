Dear Friend:
On Labor Day 2014, people all over the United States will gather to honor the working men and women of America who helped build our country and make it what it is today.
Many of the most important achievements for workers and families are the result of organized labor's efforts.
The eight-hour workday, Social Security, health insurance, unemployment and disability insurance, occupational safety standards, fair wages and decent working conditions - labor fought to win these protections for all Americans.
This Labor Day, I reaffirm my commitment to defend these hard-fought gains and build on their legacy.
I promise to keep working to reform our broken immigration system so that millions of undocumented residents can come out of the shadows to join the mainstream of working Americans.
This will boost our economy.
I will keep working to pass a long-term highway bill that creates millions of jobs through investments in America's infrastructure.
I will keep fighting to increase the nation's minimum wage to help lift millions of working families out of poverty.
In California, thanks to Governor Brown and the legislature, the state minimum wage recently rose from $8 to $9 an hour, and it will rise to $10 in January 2016.
But in Congress, Republicans have repeatedly blocked a raise for 28 million hard-working Americans.
The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour leaves millions of full-time workers and their families in poverty.
I will keep fighting alongside working men and women for a minimum wage increase because I believe that together, we can make America a stronger and more prosperous nation with opportunity for all.
Sincerely,
Barbara Boxer
United States Senator
