Dear Neighbor,
This week the House passed our amendment to boost support for nuclear cleanup sites like West Valley in our district. Our amendment was included in the Energy and Water Appropriations Bill also passed in the House. We&rsquo;re working in the House through the
annual appropriations process , having completed half of the 12 appropriations bills so far.
REED AMENDMENT TO HELP WEST VALLEY PASSES HOUSE
Our bipartisan amendment with Rep. Brian Higgins (D-NY) to
support nuclear waste cleanup at sites like West Valley
in Cattaraugus County passed the House. We want to care for our communities at home and protect them from public safety and environmental hazards that will end up costing taxpayers more money the longer the cleanup process is dragged out.
REED AT CAF USA TO UNVEIL NEW RAIL CARS
At CAF USA we saw the unveiling of the first of three new cars the Elmira company will send to Albany as part of a 130-car order from Amtrak. I&rsquo;m proud of the work our area is doing to &lsquo;make it here and sell it there&rsquo; &ndash; it&rsquo;s a trend we need to support and care for so that we continue to create quality jobs here at home.
Here with Brian Gallagher (second from right), Director-Operations of the Office of the President and CEO at Amtrak and CAF USA employees with the Amtrak rail cars manufactured in Elmira. More photos from our visit

TOM REED ANNOUNCES DISASTER DECLARATION FOR NY FLOODING
This week counties impacted by severe flooding in May got some welcome news: the President issued a major disaster declaration for Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Ontario, Steuben and Yates Counties that releases federal funds to help with rebuilding. To me,
giving these communities a fair chance to repair
is the right thing to do.
REED SOLICITS QUESTIONS FOR BENGHAZI SELECT COMMITTEE
We heard from hundreds of constituents upset with the Administration&rsquo;s handling of the Benghazi attack and the Administration&rsquo;s lack of attention to the deaths of four Americans. We&rsquo;ve been asked how to get involved in getting to the bottom of what happened. Please
send your questions
and I will share all district input with my colleague Rep. Trey Gowdy, who chairs the Select Committee on Benghazi. Americans fairly deserve accountability and answers.
Videos, articles and photos
(like the one below from our visit with Tompkins and Steuben county 4-H students) from the week are all up on our
Facebook page .
