Greetings, I recently had an opportunity to tour the U.S. Botanic Garden&#8217;s holiday display in Washington D.C. that features a special lighthouse exhibit highlighting
some of the nation&#8217;s most iconic lighthouses, including Michigan&#8217;s Whitefish Point Lighthouse. There is also an amazing collection of model trains throughout the exhibit that is guaranteed to impress.
Here&#8217;s a
short video preview of the display ,
which is open through January 4, 2015.
For

I wish everyone a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year !
