Dear
Friends,
As a member of the House Transportation &amp;
Infrastructure Committee, I've worked to make sure West Virginians have a safe
network of roads across the state. One road project that remains
unfinished is Route 35 in Mason and Putnam counties, which links Ohio and
Interstate 64. This highway is incredibly busy with both tractor trailers
and local traffic, but about 14 miles remains a two-lane road. Two
lanes are not sufficient or safe for the amount of traffic on Route 35;
we need four lanes. So while I'm pleased that we've made significant
progress in the past few years in improving Route 35, we need to finish
what we've started. That's why I'm working for a robust highway bill
-- so we can ensure a safe ride for everyone who uses this important
connector.
On Friday, I drove a stretch of Route 35 with
truck driver Joe Stanley to experience what he and his fellow drivers go
through daily. There's no doubt that Route 35 needs to be finished.
After the drive, I met with Putnam County commissioners to discuss what
the project means for Putnam County's residents and
economy.
WATER
SAFETY
I met this week with Dr. Letitia Tierney, the
commissioner of the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health, to discuss the
Kanawha Valley chemical spill and water contamination. Among other
topics, we discussed long-term medical monitoring and water testing in
schools.
FLOOD INSURANCE
On Tuesday, I voted to
pass a fix for skyrocketing flood insurance premiums for new homeowners.
H.R. 3370, the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014,
passed the House of Representatives 306-91.
This bill would
treat new homebuyers the same as previous owners, ensuring that new
homebuyers wont face skyrocketing premiums when buying new homes. It
also would repeal the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Acts rate
increases for properties purchased after July 6, 2012, returning them to
their 2012 rates and making the transition to new actuarial rates
more affordable for homeowners.
I spoke on the House
floor about the impact of new flood insurance premium rates on homeowners
and shared the story of a constituent from St. Albans.

ART COMPETITION
I'm pleased to announce that Kaylee Icenhower of
Ravenswood is the Second Districts winner of the 2014 Congressional Art
Competition
An Artistic Discovery. Kaylee, a senior at Ravenswood
High School, won for her submission, Double Sided.

Ravenswood High School, for Abandoned

sophomore at Nitro High School, for Family Moment

Miller, a junior at Ravenswood High School, for Jim Carrey in
Text
In this annual competition, one winner is selected from
each congressional district. Each first-place winners artwork will
be displayed in the tunnel connecting the U.S. Capitol and the Cannon
House Office Building.
It is a privilege to showcase the
wonderful artistic talents of the Second Districts high school students.
Art and creativity should be encouraged in our schools, and this
annual competition gives students a chance to perfect their work for
public display. I thank all of the students who entered and look forward to
displaying Kaylee Icenhowers work in Washington.
Thank you for reading my
