Dear
Friends,
My prayers and thoughts are with
the people in DeSoto County who were affected by the heavy rainfall
and flooding late last week.
First responders, state and local
officials, the media and Governor Bryant have been doing a great job
providing up-to-date information and support during and after the
storms.
While damage assessments are being made,
my
team and I
stand ready to help individuals, families, and
businesses.
Please do not hesitate to give us a
call.
