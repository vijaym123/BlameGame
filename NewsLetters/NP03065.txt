ISSUES
LEGISLATION
February 01, 2015
Dear
David,
This week, the House passed
twelve bipartisan bills
to combat Human Trafficking, a
$9.8 billion
crime
industry that affects
over 300,000 children . The
measures will help give law enforcement the tools necessary to prevent
human trafficking, ensure victims of this crime have access to support
and services, and provide training to government employees so they can
detect and respond to human trafficking more effectively. I am proud
to stand with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle against this
horrific crime.
The House also passed the LNG Permitting
Certainty and Transparency Act ( H.R.
351 ) with my support. This measure would expedite the approval
process for liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports by placing a 30 day deadline
for the Department of Energy to issue a final decision on
construction applications after an environmental review is complete. Expanding
LNG exports will boost the economy, increase energy security, and create
45, 000 jobs . We cannot let an
inefficient bureaucracy stand in the way of economic growth and getting
Americans back to work.
Below are some highlights from my
time in DC last week. As our 114 th
Congress continues, your
priorities remain my priorities. Please let me know what you think
and stay in touch. You can always
email
me , interact with me on
Facebook , and call my office!
Sincerely,
Rep. LaMalfa attends a press conference on Tuesday

Rep. LaMalfa greets Jacob Peterson of Chico, CA in Washington,
DC. Jacob is the executive director of the Junior Leadership Development
Program, which provides leadership workshops, seminars, and mentors
to at-risk youth. He founded this program in Table Mountain Juvenile
Hall back in 2011, and now it has more than 50 volunteers who work with
students in schools throughout the Butte Country Region. What an
impressive young man from our district! If you are coming to DC, please
let my office know
so we can say
hello!
