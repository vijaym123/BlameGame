David -- we&rsquo;re in the fight of our lives.
And you&rsquo;re here with us&hellip; because you&rsquo;ve been here since the beginning. This is the last national election of Barack Obama&rsquo;s presidency. And right now, we&rsquo;re getting PUMMELED.
It&rsquo;s going to take everything we have to answer President Obama&rsquo;s call-to-action, beat Boehner, and hit our fundraising goal tonight.
We may not even be able to get there. But we&rsquo;re not going down without a fight.
David, we need you with us right now. ALL GIFTS TODAY TRIPLE-MATCHED! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
