TODAY: All Gifts TRIPLE-MATCHED
Yesterday, President Obama asked for your help.
And now, a group of Democratic supporters has agreed to TRIPLE-MATCH ALL GIFTS.
President Obama wouldn&rsquo;t have emailed you yesterday if he didn&rsquo;t need your help.
-- A New York Times poll shows Republicans have taken the lead in the race for Congress
-- And NPR reported that a right-wing megadonor just handed over
$1O,OOO,OOO.OO
to Karl Rove
That&rsquo;s a crushing combo of bad news.
But here&rsquo;s the good news: After President Obama&rsquo;s email yesterday, a group of Democratic supporters agreed to TRIPLE-MATCH ALL GIFTS.
David, control of Congress is at stake. Please don&rsquo;t waste this opportunity.
