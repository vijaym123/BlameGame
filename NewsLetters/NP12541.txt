Dear Friend:
Every February, Americans celebrate Black History Month, a celebration of the tremendous contributions that African Americans have made to our nation's social, political, and cultural life.
The theme of Black History Month 2014 &ndash; &ldquo;The Golden Jubilee of the Civil Rights Act&rdquo; &ndash; focuses on the landmark 1964 legislation that ended Jim Crow and prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.
Passage of the Civil Rights Act paved the way for additional antidiscrimination legislation, including the Voting Rights Act, and opened doors for African Americans that had been closed for far too long.
The historic accomplishments of the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act not only inspire us, they also challenge us to make good on their promises and keep moving forward until every American has equal rights and opportunities &ndash; including the right to vote without intimidation or obstruction, the right to equal justice under the law, and full and equal access to health care, education, and employment.
During Black History Month and beyond, I hope you will join me in honoring the memories of the countless African-Americans who have shaped our nation&rsquo;s past, present, and future.
