Dear Friends,
Each
March we celebrate National Womens History Month: a time to highlight
and celebrate the many contributions of women to our society. It has
been less than 100 years since the 19 th
Amendment was
signed into law, giving women the right to vote.
The women who led
the suffrage movement wanted to be counted as equal and full citizens of
this great nation, to do their part and help our country, and be
equally recognized for their accomplishments.
Womens History
Month helps convey this noble goal to current generations of young women
while also increasing consciousness and knowledge of women's history
to all Americans. This month we take the time to remember both the
women who made history and profoundly impacted our nation, as well as the
modern-day heroines who have contributed to all spectrums of society
as doctors, scientist, teachers, lawyers and yes even public officials.
They deserve their due recognition and our thanks.
One
of these amazing groups of women were the WWII Women Airforce Service
Pilots (WASP). They were the first women to serve as pilots for the
U.S. Armed Forces. However, they were considered civilians, and not
given military honors and they did not receive veterans benefits. There
was not a flag on the coffin of those who sacrificed their lives, and
those who survived received no compensation.
Although these
women were pioneers who broke barriers and made history, they flew
because they loved it. Their example paved the way for the Armed Forces to
finally lift the ban on women attending military flight training in
the 1970s, and for the females of today like my daughter in law,
Lindsay, who flew combat missions over Iraq and Afghanistan for our
Marines.
The ladies of WASP deserved to be acknowledged for their
heroism and sacrifices during WWII. They served because it was their
passion to defend the United States and not because they expected anything
in return. This made it all the more special when I had the
opportunity of authoring legislation to grant them recognition and actually
witness them receive the Congressional Gold Medal.
As we
commemorate Women's History Month, we must continue to honor the tremendous
contributions women have made and renew our commitment to advancing the
rights of all everywhere. I also encourage you to take the time to
consider the ways you can better the lives of those living in your
community.
Sincerely,
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen
