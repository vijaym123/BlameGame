Remarks as prepared:
Thank you, Chairman Merkley, for holding
this important hearing today.
Every day American families wonder if
they will have enough savings to enjoy a
comfortable and stable retirement in the
future. As a new generation of
Americans prepares to reach retirement age,
we are getting a clearer picture of the
evolving retirement landscape.
Over the last few decades, new and
diversified retirement options have been
created in an attempt to increase savings
and provide additional retirement
income.
A growing number todays workers
are preparing for retirement through
defined contribution plans, like 401(k)s,
and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs),
that allow families to accumulate financial
assets from investments in stocks, bonds
and mutual funds. These retirement
accounts, along with the development of
rules allowing for increased after-tax
contribution allowances in Roth plans, are
further expanding individuals abilities to
contribute earnings to their retirement
plan.
Although these are positive
developments, many Americans are still
struggling to save for
retirement.
The economic downturn and housing crisis
have had a particularly negative impact on
the financial situation of many. In
my home state, Nevadans are still grappling
with one of the highest unemployment rate
in the nation, and for many their home
values are underwater. For those
individuals who are struggling to get by,
retirement is a distant dream.
Until the economy improves, Nevadans
will remain at a disadvantage when
preparing for retirement. In order to
combat this crisis, Washington must
implement policies that return
Americas economy back to a period of
optimism and growth. The more people
can return back to work, the more
retirement opportunities will become
available to them.
Thank you to all of our witnesses for
attending todays hearing. I
look forward to hearing your views on the
current state of Americans
retirement security. I hope that our
discussion will shed some light on the
important issues affecting
individuals ability to financially
prepare for their retirement, particularly,
how current federal policies are affecting
retirement preparedness and what we can do
to better prepare Americans.
I welcome the views from each of our
panelists on these issues, and look forward
to the testimony we will hear today.
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
