Merry
Christmas
The Christmas season is always a magical time of
the year as we reflect on the past year and look forward to
celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ with loved ones.
As many of us
join with family and friends during the Christmas season, please
remember the reason why we celebrate the season. We can spread Christmas
cheer through acts of love and selflessness and keep in our hearts and
prayers those who are not as fortunate to celebrate this day with
their loved ones.
I wish you and your family and friends a very
Merry Christmas and a blessed New
Year!
Giving Children a Chance at Life
Each
year, many innocent children are not given the gift of life.
In some
of these cases, the mother feels that she has no other choice,
because she cannot provide for the child.
That is why I have
introduced the
Adoption Promotion Act .
The
Adoption
Promotion Act
requires that any taxpayer funded family planning
services must also provide adoption counseling.
This will provide
many women an option that they may not have considered
before.
I am pro-life and believe life begins at the moment of
conception.
I will still continue fighting for the rights of the unborn
child.
This bill is a definite step in the right direction.
Adoption options will be much more accessible to expecting mothers who
cannot provide for their child.
Many children will get a chance at
life, love, and the opportunity for a promising future with a loving
family.
