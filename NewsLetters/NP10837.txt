Congressional Report
Dear Friend,
Today, I would like to provide you with some updates from my work week in Washington, D.C.
Laredo Nominee Accepted into U.S. Naval Academy
Rep. Cuellar stands next to Eduardo Salinass proud parents after congratulating Eduardo on his acceptance to the U.S. Naval Academy.Congressman Cuellar spoke with Eduardo about his future goals and plans for during and after the academy.
On Monday, I joined United Independent School District to announce that Eduardo Salinas, a high school student at Alexander High School nominated by my office, has been accepted to the U.S. Naval Academy.
I would like to congratulate Eduardo for his acceptance into the prestigious U.S. Naval Academy. His leadership skills, excellent grades and test scores, and extensive volunteer service made him stand out among a group of competitive candidates for the Academy. I am certain he will serve his country and District 28 as a role model and a leader in the Naval Academy. I wish Eduardo the best of luck.
STEM Alliance Event at TAMIU
Congressman Cuellar spoke to a group of students that attended the STEM Alliance event about the importance of their education and the current need for young talent in the STEM field.
This past week, I addressed area middle and high school students today participating in the four-day long Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Alliance event that my office co-hosted in conjunction with Texas A&amp;M International University.
I had the privilege to join TAMIU Provost, Dr. Pablo Arenaz, and an astronaut from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to encourage participating students to consider a career in a STEM field.
The students were engaged in the various science experiments and lectures at the STEM Alliance event.
A career fair was held to inform college students about the many career options in the STEM field.
The event included a career fair, presentations from companies, universities, and government agencies, and activities for middle and high school students. It targeted local Hispanic and female students as they are underrepresented in the areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.
I am confident that with the talent District 28 has, we can fill those jobs with the best in the field.
The Need for a Permanent Repeal to the Doc Fix
This year, Congress came closer than it ever has before to finding a permanent fix to the flawed formula that provides Medicare reimbursement to doctors. I signed on to the legislative fix, H.R. 4015, the SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014, which would transition Medicare away from a system where doctors are paid based on the number of patients they treat toward a system that is based on the quality of care they provide.
This bipartisan, bicameral agreement was the result of months of hard work done by the committees, staff and concerned stakeholders.
I had hoped that Republicans would bring a clean bill to the Floor but instead I believe they added a poison pill and continue to waste the taxpayers time by delaying a serious vote on this issue. I hope my Republican colleagues will put the permanent proposal back on the table so we can create a responsible solution and a permanent repeal of the Doc Fix.

Rio Grande Valley Senior Summit
Outreach coordinator, Nichole Hernandez, attended the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Senior Summit and spoke to Valley seniors about ways my office can provide constituent services.
If you are a senior living in the Rio Grande Valley, I hope you attended the Senior Summit last week hosted by the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.
It provided important health information and free health screenings to Valley seniors.
My staff, Nichole Hernandez, attended and spoke to seniors about ways my office can help them follow up with government agencies or provide more information on their options.
