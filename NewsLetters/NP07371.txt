Reforming Veterans Health Care and Its
Management
This week the House passed, with my strong
support , a bill to address the serious and widespread problems
in the VA health care system.
The bill will give eligible
veterans the ability to go outside the VA system if they cannot be given an
appointment within 30 days, will give the VA greater authority to
fire or demote supervisory employees for poor performance or
misconduct.
The bill provides the funds needed to implement these
much-needed reforms.
The recent reports of excessive wait times,
falsified records, and gross inefficiencies across the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system were deeply troubling and
completely unacceptable.
Our country has a sacred obligation to ensure
that those veterans who are eligible for health care through the VA
receive the best possible medical care in a timely and efficient
manner.
I will continue to work closely with the Department of
Veterans Affairs to ensure that our nation lives up to its commitment to
provide for them, especially for the men and women who depend on East
Orange and Lyons VA Medical Centers.

Wall Street
Journal
THE U.S. PUBLICS RESISTANCE REFLECTS COLD-BLOODED LOGIC: WHY
GET INVOLVED IF THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE MAKES CLEAR THAT AMERICAS
PRESIDENT WONT STAY THE COURSE, NO MATTER HOW WORTHY THE
CAUSE?
Daniel Henningers brilliant
analysis
(Winds of War, Again) of why the American people are reluctant to heed
the lessons of history is a must read!
Also See:
Obamas foreign policy reveals the effects of disengagement
Washington Post
Fred Hiatt,
writing
in the
Washington Post ,
covers a long list of national security problems around the world that
are a direct result of the Presidents policy of leading from
behind.
As Hiatt puts it: We have witnessed as close to a laboratory
experiment on the effects of U.S. disengagement as the real world is
ever likely to provide.
This, too, is must
reading.
Re-establishing the Constitutions Separation of
Powers
On Wednesday, I joined with a majority of my colleagues in
the House in authorizing a legal effort to put an end to President
Obamas frequent violations of his Constitutional
authority.
The President has used his executive powers to unilaterally rewrite
laws passed by Congress and signed into law by the President.
This
abuse of his executive authority, and his repeated failure to enforce
the nations laws and rules and regulations, warrants this
unprecedented action.
House Speaker John Boehner
outlined
in
USA Today
why the House
is taking this step to preserve its Constitutional authority to
legislate.
And this thoughtful
piece
in the
Wall Street Journal
explains
why this legal action is not only justified, but necessary to restore
the balance of power in Washington.
Ukraines
President: Helping Ukraine is in the National Interest of the
U.S.
The President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko,
writing
in the
Washington
Post , explains why the United States has a vested national interest in
helping Ukraine overcome Russias aggression and its violation of
Ukraines sovereignty and right to self-determination.
This is a must
read!
This past March I
urged
President Obama to grant Ukraine the
status of Major Non-NATO Ally.
It is long past time for the President
to designate Ukraine a Major Non NATO Ally and begin immediately
providing Ukraine with much needed military support so that it can defend
itself.
Stand With Israel
As
Israel continues to defend its country and its people from the terrorist
organization Hamas, some seem to think that Israel is going too far
in its efforts to eliminate the threat from Hamas.
In this cogent
and persuasive
op-ed , Bret Stephens argues in
the
Wall Street Journal
that, To
argue the Palestinian side, in the Gaza war, is to make the case for
barbarism.
GAO: Mismanagement Caused the
Obamacare Roll-out Disaster
Andrew Malcolm,
writing
in
Investors Business
Daily , discusses how the General Accountability Offices audit of
the Obamacare roll-out, released this week, represents just the latest
problem the current administration has faced in running the federal
government.
According to the article, The new report
from the nonpartisan General Accounting Office blames systemic problems
such as poor planning, lack of follow-up, ineffective oversight and
chaotic coordination for the failed roll-out of
Obamacare.
The GAO predicts that, Unless CMS [the Centers for Medicare &amp;
Medicaid Services] improves contract management and adheres to a
structured governance process, significant risks remain that upcoming open
enrollment periods could encounter challenges.
The entire GAO
report can be found
here .
Border Security Legislation to Meet the Humanitarian
Crisis
Today the House is debating legislation to address the
continuing humanitarian crisis on our southern border.
The bill
will discourage families from paying money to cartels which results in
dangerous transportation for their children to the U.S. border. This
bill will also reduce the number of children who will remain in the
United States after they have illegally entered.
By increasing
the number of children who will be safely and quickly returned to
their home countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, this bill
sends a clear signal that the United States will enforce its
immigration laws
laws which, by the way, allow one million people to enter the
United States legally every year.
Salute:
