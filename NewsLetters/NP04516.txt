Kansas Common Sense
November 10, 2014
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thanks for your continued interest in
receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
Honoring All Those Who Served
Each year on November 11, Americans celebrate and honor our nation's
veterans - the generations of men and women who have served our country
with valor. I hope this Veterans Day, you take the time to honor and
celebrate the veterans in your life. Whether it's your sister, dad,
grandpa or neighbor, take a moment to thank them for their courage and
sacrifice, which has preserved the freedoms we all enjoy today.
I am visiting Gardner on Veterans Day where I will have the opportunity
to say thank you to veterans and their families as part of the Gardner
Veterans Day ceremony. This is the 28th Annual Johnson County Veterans
Day Observance and I am honored to be included. This is just one of the
many events and parades across Kansas that will bring families and
communities together to honor all those who served. On Saturday, I rode
in the Topeka Veterans Parade. Thanks to former Kansas Adjutant General
Maj. Gen. Tod Bunting for joining me in the WWII Jeep as together we
honored the generations of men and women who have served our country
with valor. God bless you, and God bless America.
While our society has such great respect for those who have served, the
organization charged with providing their care has fallen short,
failing to uphold its commitments to our veterans. Like many Americans,
I was disturbed by the dysfunction and disservice to veterans under the
care of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), an agency created to
serve them. For years, the VA has struggled to provide quality health
care for millions of veterans, particularly rural veterans in Kansas.
In August, Congress passed the Veterans Access, Choice, and
Accountability Act of 2014 to give veterans access to non-VA care if
they wait more than 30 days for an appointment or they live more than
40 miles from a VA medical facility. By law, the VA began implementing
increased choice in access to care on November 5, 2014. If you are
veteran, you can call 866-606-8198 to verify your eligibility.
Despite some positive steps, there is more to be done to correct the
bad policies of the past and improve the quality of life for our
nation's veterans. Whatever the mission, the men and women we honor on
Veterans Day were ready to answer the call. They deserve a VA that is
ready to serve them. Our nation would not be what it is today without
your strength, sacrifice and bravery. We are forever grateful for your
service.
Words are Right, We Will See About Actions
On Friday, I spoke with the Secretary of the Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA), Bob McDonald, about the implementation of the Veterans
Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014. Secretary McDonald
assured me that the law will be implemented to serve any veteran who
needs access to care, as it was intended. While I am encouraged by the
VA Secretary's personal conviction and motivation to provide quality
and timely healthcare to our nation's veterans, I am deeply concerned
that the implementation of this law will fall short of its duty to
serve the most vulnerable veterans who struggle to access healthcare -
something rural Kansans understand all too well. I'm afraid VA
bureaucracy is still in control and veterans will find that this new
law is being implemented in a very typical, bureaucratic fashion. I
keep pushing for common sense to prevail and have shared my concerns
with Secretary McDonald personally. His pledge sends the right message
but we will have to wait and see if actions can live up to his words.
A New Congress
After Tuesday's elections, it's clear that Washington, D.C., will look
different in January. For the first time in 8 years, Republicans will
have a majority in the U.S. Senate. With new leadership, I expect the
Senate will seek results, not play divisive political games. I look at
elections like the beginning of a new year, with hope and promise.
The challenges America faces are significant, and the consequences of
failing to address them are profound. The President indicated his
policies were up for review by the electorate this November and the
response from voters was clear: the President's agenda has fallen
short. With so much at stake, we're in need of real solutions that do
more than just increase the size and cost of the federal government.
This new Congress has an opportunity to move the country in a positive
direction and approach the difficult decisions ahead with the
well-being of all Americans in mind. This week voters requested a
different plan, respect among elected officials, and an end to the "do
nothing" Senate. I am eager to begin this new chapter and am hopeful
for a better future ahead.
Olathe East High School
On Monday morning I spoke to a government class at Olathe East High
School. We discussed the upcoming elections and the national attention
on Kansas politics this year. They asked about which Senate committees
I sit on and how our work impacts Kansas. I also had the opportunity to
visit with Thomas Williams, a student at Olathe East who recently
received my principal nomination to the U.S. Naval Academy. I
particularly enjoy visiting with high school students because that was
the time when I discovered my own interest in government and history.
Thanks to Olathe East teacher Breanna Francis for the invitation to
meet with her students.
Touring Pittsburg State University
Monday afternoon I had the opportunity to tour the construction site
for Pittsburg State University's Bicknell Family Center for the Arts.
Upon completion, the $33 million facility will serve as one of the
Midwest's premiere venues for music, theater, art exhibits and
lectures. The generosity of lead donor Gene Bicknell, his wife, Rita,
and their family is making a permanent mark on PSU and will help
transform the future of the region. The Bicknell family long wished to
remain anonymous in order to keep the focus on the true purpose of the
project: academics, community and culture. Thank you to the Bicknell
family and the more than 600 donors who have joined them in supporting
the future of PSU. After 30 years on the drawing board, you have helped
the new Center for the Arts at Pittsburg State become a reality. The
ribbon cutting is scheduled for December 7.
It is an amazingly impressive performing arts center. I said "Wow!" as
I drove down the street and saw it for the first time. Thanks to
President Steve Scott for showing the new Arts Center to me and more
importantly for his tremendous leadership on this accomplishment.
Kansas Listening Tour Stops Continue
Crawford County
On Monday, I continued my Kansas Listening Tour with a stop in Crawford
County. Residents turned out to the Frontenac community hall to share
feedback and concerns on a wide array of topics including
transportation funding, burdensome federal regulations, immigration
reform, the importance of supporting independent living, and the need
to keep our Critical Access Hospitals open. Thanks to Frontenac City
Clerk Doug Sellars for making the facility available. Thanks again to
all the Kansans who attended including State Representative Adam
Lusker, former Senator Jim Barone, and former Reps. Bob Grant and Ed
McKechnie.
Linn County
Thanks to the Linn County residents who came out to my Listening Tour
Stop at City Hall in Mound City on Monday to share the issues they
consider important to Kansas and the nation. We discussed a number of
issues including fixing the dysfunction at the Department of Veterans
Affairs. I appreciate veteran Les Heflin for taking the time to share
with me his experience dealing with problems at the VA - his story will
be helpful as we continue to work toward improving this system. We
discussed equal pay for women in the workplace, country-of-origin
labeling, and accelerated depreciation of equipment that affects
purchase of farm equipment. Our visit also covered the farm bill, the
ISIS threat and the Affordable Care Act. Thanks to all who attended,
including Senator Caryn Tyson and her father-in-law, former state Sen.
Robert Tyson.
Labette County
I started Tuesday morning with a Labette County town hall in the
community building in Altamont. Our discussion included how changes to
the Senate rules are harmful to Kansans and rural America at large.
Residents shared their concerns about regulations by the FCC, EPA and
FEMA, and how the government needs to work to create an environment
where our economy can grow. Thanks to all the residents who turned out
on Election Day to share your thoughts, ideas and concerns about the
direction of our country. Special thanks to Altamont city clerk Liz
Finley for helping arrange my visit and to Mayor Herb Bath for his
attendance.
Wilson County
On Tuesday afternoon, I was the keynote speaker at the Neodesha Rotary
Club meeting. About 40 folks attended and the conversation focused on
the importance of ending the gridlock in the Senate and passing bills,
over-regulation by federal agencies including the EPA, and the need to
produce our own domestic energy. These are all issues the new
Republican-led Senate will work to address by focusing on pro-growth,
pro-jobs policies. Thanks again to Mojo's for hosting the meeting, as
well as Karen Porter for arranging my visit. It was good to see
everyone who attended, including Wilson County Commissioners Casey
Lair, Jim Richardson and Russ Walker.
Neosho County
I finished my Listening Tour stops this week at Neosho County Community
College in Chanute. More than 20 area residents attended and shared
their thoughts. The discussion focused on a number of issues facing
Kansas and the nation including ensuring access to quality healthcare
for rural veterans, the promise of medical research, the threat of
terrorism, and disability issues. Thanks to the folks who came out on
Tuesday and thanks to President Dr. Brian Inbody for allowing me to
host my town hall ?at Neosho County Community College.
Visiting Plainville
On Friday, I visited my hometown of Plainville and visited with folks
at the Rooks County Health Clinic, Rooks County Medical Center City
Hall, the Plainville Times and the Post Office. I also stopped by
Midwest Community Bank. The residents I saw shared lots of concerns
with me and I appreciate the conversations.
LeadingAge Kansas
This year is the 60th anniversary of LeadingAge Kansas, a coalition of
160 nursing home, assisted living, housing and other aging services
providers dedicated to serving the needs of Kansas seniors, and
providing services and supports to aging Kansans in their own
communities. The availability of quality health care and other
community services determines whether Kansas seniors can remain in
their communities. The special way of life we live in our cities and
towns would not be possible without access to the types of care and
support provided by LeadingAge Kansas members and other providers
throughout our state.
Johnson County Community College Some Enchanted Evening
On Saturday evening my wife Robba and I attended Some Enchanted
Evening, which raises money for scholarships for students attending
Johnson County Community College. I enjoyed hearing from students on
how their scholarship has impacted their life and provided an
opportunity to further their education. I extended my congratulations
to Dr. Gary Morsch, founder of the Heart to Heart Foundation who was
honored as Johnson Countian of the Year. Thanks to Mary Birch for
chairing the event and to Dr. Joe Sopcich and his wife, Stacy for
hosting Robba and me at their table.

Kansas
Common

2014
Hello,
Welcome
to
&#8220;Kansas
Common
Sense.&#8221;
Thanks
for
your
continued
interest
in
receiving
my
weekly
newsletter.
Please
feel
free
to
forward
it
on
to
your
family
and
friends
if
it
would
interest
them.
Honoring
All
Those
Who
Served Each
year
on
November
11,
Americans
celebrate
and
honor
our
nation&#8217;s
veterans
&#8211;
the
generations
of
men
and
women
who
have
served
our
country
with
valor.
I
hope
this
Veterans
Day,
you
take
the
time
to
honor
and
celebrate
the
veterans
in
your
life.
Whether
it&#8217;s
your
sister,
dad,
grandpa
or
neighbor,
take
a
moment
to
thank
them
for
their
courage
and
sacrifice,
which
has
preserved
the
freedoms
we
all
enjoy
today.
I
am
visiting
Gardner
on
Veterans
Day
where
I
will
have
the
opportunity
to
say
thank
you
to
veterans
and
their
families
as
part
of
the
Gardner
Veterans
Day
ceremony.
This
is
the
28th
Annual
Johnson
County
Veterans
Day
Observance
and
I
am
honored
to
be
included.
This
is
just
one
of
the
many
events
and
parades
across
Kansas
that
will
bring
families
and
communities
together
to
honor
all
those
who
served.
On
Saturday,
I
rode
in
the
Topeka
Veterans
Parade.
Thanks
to
former
Kansas
Adjutant
General
Maj.
Gen.
Tod
Bunting
for
joining
me
in
the
WWII
Jeep
as
together
we
honored
the
generations
of
men
and
women
who
have
served
our
country
with
valor.
God
bless
you,
and
God
bless
America.
While
our
society
has
such
great
respect
for
those
who
have
served,
the
organization
charged
with
providing
their
care
has
fallen
short,
failing
to
uphold
its
commitments
to
our
veterans.
Like
many
Americans,
I
was
disturbed
by
the
dysfunction
and
disservice
to
veterans
under
the
care
of
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA),
an
agency
created
to
serve
them.
For
years,
the
VA
has
struggled
to
provide
quality
health
care
for
millions
of
veterans,
particularly
rural
veterans
in
Kansas.
In
August,
Congress
passed
the
Veterans
Access,
Choice,
and
Accountability
Act
of
2014
to
give
veterans
access
to
non-VA
care
if
they
wait
more
than
30
days
for
an
appointment
or
they
live
more
than
40
miles
from
a
VA
medical
facility.
By
law,
the
VA
began
implementing
increased
choice
in
access
to
care
on
November
5,
2014.
If
you
are
veteran,
you
can
call
866-606-8198
to
verify
your
eligibility.
Despite
some
positive
steps,
there
is
more
to
be
done
to
correct
the
bad
policies
of
the
past
and
improve
the
quality
of
life
for
our
nation&#8217;s
veterans.
Whatever
the
mission,
the
men
and
women
we
honor
on
Veterans
Day
were
ready
to
answer
the
call.
They
deserve
a
VA
that
is
ready
to
serve
them.
Our
nation
would
not
be
what
it
is
today
without
your
strength,
sacrifice
and
bravery.
We
are
forever
grateful
for
your
service.
Words
are
Right,
We
Will
See
About
Actions On
Friday,
I
spoke
with
the
Secretary
of
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs
(VA),
Bob
McDonald,
about
the
implementation
of
the
Veterans
Access,
Choice,
and
Accountability
Act
of
2014 .
Secretary
McDonald
assured
me
that
the
law
will
be
implemented
to
serve
any
veteran
who
needs
access
to
care,
as
it
was
intended.
While
I
am
encouraged
by
the
VA
Secretary&#8217;s
personal
conviction
and
motivation
to
provide
quality
and
timely
healthcare
to
our
nation&#8217;s
veterans,
I
am
deeply
concerned
that
the
implementation
of
this
law
will
fall
short
of
its
duty
to
serve
the
most
vulnerable
veterans
who
struggle
to
access
healthcare
&#8211;
something
rural
Kansans
understand
all
too
well.
I&#8217;m
afraid
VA
bureaucracy
is
still
in
control
and
veterans
will
find
that
this
new
law
is
being
implemented
in
a
very
typical,
bureaucratic
fashion.
I
keep
pushing
for
common
sense
to
prevail
and
have
shared
my
concerns
with
Secretary
McDonald
personally.
His
pledge
sends
the
right
message
but
we
will
have
to
wait
and
see
if
actions
can
live
up
to
his
words.
A
New
Congress After
Tuesday&#8217;s
elections,
it&#8217;s
clear
that
Washington,
D.C.,
will
look
different
in
January.
For
the
first
time
in
8
years,
Republicans
will
have
a
majority
in
the
U.S.
Senate.
With
new
leadership,
I
expect
the
Senate
will
seek
results,
not
play
divisive
political
games.
I
look
at
elections
like
the
beginning
of
a
new
year,
with
hope
and
promise.
The
challenges
America
faces
are
significant,
and
the
consequences
of
failing
to
address
them
are
profound.
The
President
indicated
his
policies
were
up
for
review
by
the
electorate
this
November
and
the
response
from
voters
was
clear:
the
President's
agenda
has
fallen
short.
With
so
much
at
stake,
we&#8217;re
in
need
of
real
solutions
that
do
more
than
just
increase
the
size
and
cost
of
the
federal
government.
This
new
Congress
has
an
opportunity
to
move
the
country
in
a
positive
direction
and
approach
the
difficult
decisions
ahead
with
the
well-being
of
all
Americans
in
mind.
This
week
voters
requested
a
different
plan,
respect
among
elected
officials,
and
an
end
to
the
"do
nothing"
Senate.
I
am
eager
to
begin
this
new
chapter
and
am
hopeful
for
a
better
future
ahead.
Olathe
East
High
School On
Monday
morning
I
spoke
to
a
government
class
at
Olathe
East
High
School.
We
discussed
the
upcoming
elections
and
the
national
attention
on
Kansas
politics
this
year.
They
asked
about
which
Senate
committees
I
sit
on
and
how
our
work
impacts
Kansas.
I
also
had
the
opportunity
to
visit
with
Thomas
Williams,
a
student
at
Olathe
East
who
recently
received
my
principal
nomination
to
the
U.S.
Naval
Academy.
I
particularly
enjoy
visiting
with
high
school
students
because
that
was
the
time
when
I
discovered
my
own
interest
in
government
and
history.
Thanks
to
Olathe
East
teacher
Breanna
Francis
for
the
invitation
to
meet
with
her
students.
Touring
Pittsburg
State
University Monday
afternoon
I
had
the
opportunity
to
tour
the
construction
site
for
Pittsburg
State
University&#8217;s
Bicknell
Family
Center
for
the
Arts.
Upon
completion,
the
$33
million
facility
will
serve
as
one
of
the
Midwest&#8217;s
premiere
venues
for
music,
theater,
art
exhibits
and
lectures.
The
generosity
of
lead
donor
Gene
Bicknell,
his
wife,
Rita,
and
their
family
is
making
a
permanent
mark
on
PSU
and
will
help
transform
the
future
of
the
region.
The
Bicknell
family
long
wished
to
remain
anonymous
in
order
to
keep
the
focus
on
the
true
purpose
of
the
project:
academics,
community
and
culture.
Thank
you
to
the
Bicknell
family
and
the
more
than
600
donors
who
have
joined
them
in
supporting
the
future
of
PSU.
After
30
years
on
the
drawing
board,
you
have
helped
the
new
Center
for
the
Arts
at
Pittsburg
State
become
a
reality.
The
ribbon
cutting
is
scheduled
for
December
7.
It
is
an
amazingly
impressive
performing
arts
center.
I
said
"Wow!"
as
I
drove
down
the
street
and
saw
it
for
the
first
time.
Thanks
to
President
Steve
Scott
for
showing
the
new
Arts
Center
to
me
and
more
importantly
for
his
tremendous
leadership
on
this
accomplishment.
Kansas

to
the
Linn
County
residents
who
came
out
to
my
Listening

Stop
at
City
Hall
in
Mound
City
on
Monday
to
share
the
issues
they
consider
important
to
Kansas
and
the
nation.
We
discussed
a
number
of
issues
including
fixing
the
dysfunction
at
the
Department
of
Veterans
Affairs.
I
appreciate
veteran
Les
Heflin
for
taking
the
time
to
share
with
me
his
experience
dealing
with
problems
at
the
VA
&#8211;
his
story
will
be
helpful
as
we
continue
to
work
toward
improving
this
system.
We
discussed
equal
pay
for
women
in
the
workplace,
country-of-origin
labeling,
and
accelerated
depreciation
of
equipment
that
affects
purchase
of
farm

Our
visit
also
covered
the
farm
bill,
the
ISIS

Act.
Thanks
to
all
who
attended,
including
Senator
Caryn
Tyson
and
her
father-in-law,
former

Robert
Tyson.
Labette
County I
started
Tuesday
morning
with
a
Labette
County
town
hall
in
the
community
building
in
Altamont.
Our
discussion
included
how
changes
to
the
Senate
rules
are
harmful
to
Kansans
and
rural
America
at
large.
Residents
shared
their
concerns
about
regulations
by
the
FCC,
EPA
and
FEMA,
and
how
the
government
needs
to
work
to
create
an
environment
where
our
economy
can
grow.
Thanks
to
all
the
residents
who
turned
out
on
Election
Day
to
share
your
thoughts,
ideas
and
concerns
about
the
direction

Special
thanks
to

helping
arrange
my

Wilson
County On
Tuesday
afternoon,
I
was
the
keynote
speaker
at
the
Neodesha
Rotary
Club
meeting.
About
40
folks
attended
and
the
conversation
focused
on
the
importance
of
ending
the
gridlock
in
the
Senate
and
passing
bills,
over-regulation
by
federal
agencies
including
the
EPA,
and
the
need
to
produce
our
own
domestic
energy.
These
are
all
issues
the
new
Republican-led
Senate
will
work
to
address
by
focusing
on
pro-growth,
pro-jobs
policies.
Thanks
again
to
Mojo's
for
hosting
the
meeting,
as
well
as
Karen
Porter
for
arranging
my
visit.
It
was
good
to
see
everyone
who
attended,
including
Wilson
County
Commissioners
Casey
Lair,
Jim
Richardson
and
Russ
Walker.
Neosho
County I
finished
my

this
week
at
Neosho

Community
College
in
Chanute.
More
than
20
area

and
shared
their

The
discussion
focused
on
a
number
of
issues
facing
Kansas
and
the
nation
including
ensuring
access
to
quality
healthcare
for
rural
veterans,
the
promise
of
medical
research,
the
threat
of
terrorism,
and
disability
issues.
Thanks
to
the
folks
who
came
out
on
Tuesday
and
thanks
to
President
Dr.
Brian

for
allowing
me
to
host
my

at
the
Rooks
County
Health
Clinic,
Rooks
County
Medical
Center
City
Hall,
the
Plainville
Times
and
the
Post

shared
lots
of
concerns
with
me
and
I
appreciate
the
conversations.
LeadingAge

This
year
is
the
60th
anniversary
of
LeadingAge
Kansas,
a
coalition
of
160
nursing
home,
assisted
living,

and
other
aging

providers
dedicated
to

the
needs
of
Kansas

and
providing

The

The
special

of
life
we
live
in
our

would
not
be
possible
without
access
to
the
types
of

and
support
provided
by
LeadingAge
Kansas
members
and
other
providers
throughout
our
state.
