Dear Friend,
I want to take just a moment to wish you and your family a
very Happy Easter.
For Christians, this is the most sacred of
holidays.
It's the fulfillment of a promise and the reason we
have hope.
The hope that we can be redeemed of every
shortcoming we have.
That we can overcome the most insurmountable of
challenges.
That we may work freely towards the limitless
potential that comes from grace and forgiveness.
Some might say
that's just part of the American dream, but it's more than that.
It's the hope for all humanity, and it started on that
Sunday.
A very Happy Easter from the Collins Family to
yours.
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of Congress
