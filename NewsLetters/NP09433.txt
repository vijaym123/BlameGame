The House on Thursday overwhelmingly backed a $601 billion defense bill that ignores cuts proposed by the Pentagon and spares the A-10 aircraft fleet, including those stationed at Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Harrison Township, from elimination during the 2015 fiscal year.
The campaign to save the A-10s benefited from a spending authorization bill that spares a wide array of planes, ships and military bases in an election-year nod to hometown interests.
Republicans and Democrats united behind the popular measure that authorizes spending on weapons and personnel for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The vote was 325-98 for the legislation, which now must be reconciled with a work-in-progress version in the Democrat-controlled Senate.
The A-10s, which are a key contingent at National Guard bases across the nation, have key allies in the Senate who are part of a congressional effort to preserve the low-flying plane, so the House action should hold up.
"Our support for the A-10 is based on facts, the cost effective nature of these aircraft, and the strong support of our soldiers who depend on the close air support provided by the A-10," said Rep. Candice Miller, a Harrison Township Republican whose district includes Selfridge, Michigan's largest defense installation.
"I hear it time and time again from our troops who have served in combat in defense of freedom as well as those that operate A-10s out of Selfridge. They all agree that it is the most dependable aircraft. They use words like 'proven, effective and reliable' to describe it. They say it is the only weapons system that can do what it does, and what it does is protect them in combat."
The Pentagon had proposed retiring the Cold War-era U-2 spy plane, the decades-old A-10 "Warthog" close-air support aircraft, Navy cruisers and AWACS reconnaissance???? Planes, as well as shuttering outdated bases.
Earlier this year, the Air Force hoped to retire all 326 A-10 Thunderbolts at a savings of about $3.7 billion
The proposal would retire the base's 18 A-10 Thunderbolts in fiscal year 2017 and then mitigate the damage to Selfridge's viability by doubling the number of KC-135 mid-air refueling tankers to 16. The change would mean the loss of 275 Air National Guard positions and 85 full-time civilian and Air Force jobs. That put the future of the107th Fighter Squadron -- a unit formed decades ago known as the "Red Devils" - in jeopardy.
The House vote nixes that entire plan.
Miller and top elected officials across southeast Michigan, as well as Gov. Rick Snyder, have been fighting Pentagon attempts to kill the A-10 for two years.
They cite Army brass who say the A-10 is uniquely able to protect ground troops at low speeds with bombs and rotary machine guns and also perform its traditional role as a "tank buster."
But the Air Force has said other aircraft can provide similar ground support and also perform other missions. Top officers consider the 1970s-era A-10 a one-dimensional weapon that is obsolete.
The House version of the defense authorization bill saves the A-10s, but only for one more year.
Janine Davidson, a defense specialist at the highly regarded Council on Foreign Relations in Washington wrote this week that "the A-10 was designed in a very different era, when, as one Air Force pilot explained, 'the only way to deliver precise fires and effects was strafing with a gun.' Indeed, the A-10 is often thought of as a flying Gatling gun.
"Today's precision-guided systems allow F-15Es or B-1s to deliver an array of munitions in greater numbers and with accuracy 'unimaginable' when the A-10 was designed. Finally, the Air Force argues that future ground fights will see increasingly sophisticated anti-aircraft surface-to-air threats, making the A-10 increasingly vulnerable. Relying on this outdated jet in future fights places airmen and soldiers at greater risk."
At the Pentagon, spending on the military is being cut after more than a decade of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, with deficit-driven budgets taking their toll on Pentagon spending.
But the House forcefully rejected plans for eliminating weapons systems that mean thousands of jobs in congressional districts and for reducing military payroll and personnel costs.
Lawmakers cast aside a Defense Department plan to increase the troops' out-of-pocket costs for housing and health care and instead granted a 1.8 percent pay raise.
Even tea party Republicans joined in the parochial approach to the defense bill.
Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., highlighted her vote for the bill and its importance to her home state, where more than 150,000 have defense or defense-related jobs. Her colleague, Rep. Ron Barber, D-Ariz., praised the A-10 Thunderbolt, which trains in Tucson. In committee, Rep. Jim Bridenstine, R-Okla., a former pilot and tea party favorite elected in 2012, spared three of seven AWACS aircraft based at Tinker Air Force Base in his home state.
It fell to the House Armed Services Committee's top Democrat, Rep. Adam Smith of Washington state, to complain that the House rejected the Pentagon's cost-saving proposals and came up with no alternatives.
"We ducked every difficult decision," Smith said.
