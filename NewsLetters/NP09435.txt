Memorial Day
Dear Friend,
As you and your family look ahead to the Memorial Day weekend, please
think of our service members, veterans, and their families for the
enormous sacrifices they have made to defend America's safety and
freedom. Since September 2001, some 2.6 million Americans have served
in Afghanistan or Iraq, and of those men and women, 290 Pennsylvanians
have made the ultimate sacrifice. We must never forget the commitment
and courage shown by the brave men and women who have sacrificed so
much for our nation.
It is my hope that everyone takes a moment on Memorial Day to
acknowledge the tremendous service of the Pennsylvanians currently
serving in our armed forces and of the Commonwealth's more than 950,000
military veterans. As the daughter of a Korean War veteran, I take very
personally my responsibility to ensure that our troops receive the
respect they have earned for their service to our country. In Congress,
I have been a steadfast supporter of our men and women in uniform,
ensuring they have the health care, educational, and career
opportunities they deserve.
On this Memorial Day, please join me in remembering those who have paid
the ultimate price by giving their lives in service to our nation. Our
thoughts and prayers are extended to their families as we honor their
memory.
Sincerely,
Allyson Y. Schwartz
Member of Congress
