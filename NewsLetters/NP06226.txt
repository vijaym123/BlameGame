Funding the Government and Fighting
ISIS
9/17/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn joined a strong
bipartisan majority in House by voting to fund the government and fight
back against the terrorists of ISIS.
I joined a bipartisan House majority in passing a Continuing
Resolution to keep the government funded and to take the fight to the
terrorists of ISIS. This vote is a small step which gives the
President the authority to begin training and equipping appropriately vetted
opposition forces from Syria. The Presidents failed foreign policy has
compounded this problem, so Congress will do what we can to assist
him in crafting a more sound foreign policy. The United States must
present a strong, unified front as we face these barbaric terrorists and
todays vote is a positive step in that
direction.
- Congressman Doug Lamborn
(CO-05)
