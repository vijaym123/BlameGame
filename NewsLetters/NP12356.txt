Celebrating Black History Month
The accomplishments and contributions of African-Americans in
our community and throughout our country are a very important part of
our history. This year marks 50 years since the Civil Rights Act of
1964, which outlawed discrimination and protected voting rights for all
of our citizens.
Since this period, voting rights advocates
like our own Alice Tregay of Evanston have led historic voter
registration efforts to ensure that more people can exercise their right to vote.
Sadly, voter suppression efforts have resurfaced in some states. In
the face of these challenges we must continue to strive toward equality
for all.
Department of Justice Expands Same Sex
Protections
The changes in the
Department of Justices policy memorandum released Monday
will go a long way toward making sure that LGBT individuals are
treated with dignity and respect. Individuals in same-sex marriages
will now be treated the same as other legally married couples with
regard to civil and criminal trials, bankruptcy filings, and more. As a
founding member of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, I am elated
that we have come so far, though we still have work to do. I will
continue to be a passionate advocate for equality. I also applaud Michael
Sam, former University of Missouri football player and current N.F.L.
prospect, for his courage. This is great week for equality and I am a
proud supporter of this kind of progress in our
society.
