Dear Friend,
This week, the House marked Stop Government Abuse Week by approving a
number of important bills designed to stop the government overreach
that is infringing on the rights of citizens.
First and foremost, the House is moving to stop the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) from implementing proposed regulations on tax-exempt
501(c)(4) organizations. The Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the
IRS Act, H.R. 3865, would stop IRS' latest efforts to muzzle
conservative groups by maintaining the current IRS standards and
policies that have been in effect since 2010.
If the IRS puts its proposed rule into effect, it could have a chilling
effect on groups that have been formed for the purpose of educating
citizens. The current rules and regulations permit these groups to
conduct get-out-the-vote drives, hold candidate forums, and to
distribute voter guides. The proposed changes would effectively
restrict the right of these groups to engage in public discourse, even
when it is conducted in a non-partisan manner. The Stop Targeting of
Political Beliefs by the IRS Act is designed to protect the
Constitutional Rights of American citizens. I urge the Senate to
quickly take up this bill and pass it.
The House also passed bills to increase transparency in your federal
government. The Taxpayer Transparency Act, H.R. 3308, requires that all
government advertisements include a statement indicating that the ad
was paid for with taxpayer dollars. Congress already abides by this
rule; the White House should abide by it, too.
The Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act, H.R. 1423, was approved, as well. It
would provide taxpayers with an annual report outlining whether
taxpayers are getting their money's worth out of government programs.
This report would include data on wasteful and duplicative programs,
such as the USDA catfish inspection scheme that I have fought against.
This duplicative scheme has already spent $30 million of your
hard-earned dollars without inspecting a single fish. Your federal
government, at all levels, must be accountable to the people for the
money it spends. These bills are steps in the right direction.
The Department of Defense released its budget proposal that outlines
the devastating reality of passage of the Budget Control Act of 2011
that established sequestration and massive cuts to our national
defense. While this budget proposal will be studied and modified over
the coming months, I want to make clear that I am fighting back against
a number of DoD proposals. I am the sponsor of legislation to prevent
the premature divestment of the A-10. Premature divestment of the A-10
by the Air Force would create a dangerous close air support capability
gap that could unnecessarily endanger American service members in
future conflicts. Hundreds of brave Americans are alive today because
of the performance of the A-10 in Iraq and Afghanistan and the Air
Force should not create a close air support gap that will put our
ground troops at increased risk. Additionally, I am a co-sponsor of
legislation, H.R.3930, to prevent the transfer of the Apache helicopter
from the National Guard to the active-duty force. This bill will
support and maintain the size of the National Guard as a strong and
viable force for America's defense and homeland security. It would
freeze the transfer and divestiture of National Guard aircraft while
forming a commission to examine and make recommendations on the force
structure of the Army as a whole.
As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I believe our Armed
Services have already been cut disproportionately in an effort to help
address this country's fiscal situation and oppose asking the military
to do more. Providing for the common defense is one of the few specific
Constitutional requirements of the federal government and I will
continue to fight to preserve the greatness of our military.
On a related matter, I promised I would be working to reverse the
military retiree pensions reforms that were part of the Bipartisan
Budget Act passed in December. I am pleased to report this goal has
been accomplished and was done without raising taxes. I believe in the
principle of "Promises Made; Promises Kept" and I am glad that this
provision of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 was corrected before the
reduction went into effect. Providing our veterans with the benefits
they were promised is the least we can do to demonstrate support for
our troops, retirees, and veterans.
Finally, I want to share that I met this week with several educators
from the Missouri Association of Elementary School Principals who were
in Washington to meet with education officials from throughout the
country to discuss a number of important topics. Those issues included
reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act,
pre-school education, and professional development. As a former school
teacher, I take great interest in efforts to better educate our
children and to ensure they are experiencing the best possible learning
environment.
L-R: Tammy Condren, Stacy Fick, Ed Elsea, Congresswoman Hartzler,
Michael Schooley, and Jason Anderson
It was a pleasure to meet and talk with the fine educators who are
guiding our children through their pivotal learning experiences.
Have a good week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler

Dear
Friend,
This
week,
the
House
marked
Stop
Government
Abuse
Week
by
approving
a
number
of
important
bills
designed
to
stop
the
government
overreach
that
is
infringing
on
the
rights
of
citizens.
First
and
foremost,
the
House
is
moving
to
stop
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
(IRS)
from
implementing
proposed
regulations
on
tax-exempt
501(c)(4)
organizations.
The
Stop
Targeting
of
Political
Beliefs
by
the
IRS
Act,
H.R.
3865,
would
stop
IRS&#8217;
latest
efforts
to
muzzle
conservative
groups
by
maintaining
the
current
IRS
standards
and
policies
that
have
been
in
effect
since
2010.
If
the
IRS
puts
its
proposed
rule
into
effect,
it
could
have
a
chilling
effect
on
groups
that
have
been
formed
for
the
purpose
of
educating
citizens.
The
current
rules
and
regulations
permit
these
groups
to
conduct
get-out-the-vote
drives,
hold
candidate
forums,
and
to
distribute
voter
guides.
The
proposed
changes
would
effectively
restrict
the
right
of
these
groups
to
engage
in
public
discourse,
even
when
it
is
conducted
in
a
non-partisan
manner.
The
Stop
Targeting
of
Political
Beliefs
by
the
IRS
Act
is
designed
to
protect
the
Constitutional
Rights
of
American
citizens.
I
urge
the
Senate
to
quickly
take
up
this
bill
and
pass
it.
The
House
also
passed
bills
to
increase
transparency
in
your
federal
government.
The
Taxpayer
Transparency
Act,
H.R.
3308,
requires
that
all
government
advertisements
include
a
statement
indicating
that
the
ad
was
paid
for
with
taxpayer
dollars.
Congress
already
abides
by
this
rule;
the
White
House
should
abide
by
it,
too.
The
Taxpayers
Right-to-Know
Act,
H.R.
1423,
was
approved,
as
well.
It
would
provide
taxpayers
with
an
annual
report
outlining
whether
taxpayers
are
getting
their
money&#8217;s
worth
out
of
government
programs.
This
report
would
include
data
on
wasteful
and
duplicative
programs,
such
as
the
USDA
catfish
inspection
scheme
that
I
have
fought
against.
This
duplicative
scheme
has
already
spent
$30
million
of
your
hard-earned
dollars
without
inspecting
a
single
fish.
Your
federal
government,
at
all
levels,
must
be
accountable
to
the
people
for
the
money
it
spends.
These
bills
are
steps
in
the
right
direction.
The
Department
of
Defense
released
its
budget
proposal
that
outlines
the
devastating
reality
of
passage
of
the
Budget
Control
Act
of
2011
that
established
sequestration
and
massive
cuts
to
our
national
defense.
While
this
budget
proposal
will
be
studied
and
modified
over
the
coming
months,
I
want
to
make
clear
that
I
am
fighting
back
against
a
number
of
DoD
proposals.
I
am
the
sponsor
of
legislation
to
prevent
the
premature
divestment
of
the
A-10.
Premature
divestment
of
the
A-10
by
the
Air
Force
would
create
a
dangerous
close
air
support
capability
gap
that
could
unnecessarily
endanger
American
service
members
in
future
conflicts.
Hundreds
of
brave
Americans
are
alive
today
because
of
the
performance
of
the
A-10
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
and
the
Air
Force
should
not
create
a
close
air
support
gap
that
will
put
our
ground
troops
at
increased
risk.
Additionally,
I
am
a
co-sponsor
of
legislation,
H.R.3930,
to
prevent
the
transfer
of
the
Apache
helicopter
from
the
National
Guard
to
the
active-duty
force.
This
bill
will
support
and
maintain
the
size
of
the
National
Guard
as
a
strong
and
viable
force
for
America&#8217;s
defense
and
homeland
security.
It
would
freeze
the
transfer
and
divestiture
of
National
Guard
aircraft
while
forming
a
commission
to
examine
and
make
recommendations
on
the
force
structure
of
the
Army
as
a
whole.
As
a
member
of
the
House
Armed
Services
Committee,
I
believe
our
Armed
Services
have
already
been
cut
disproportionately
in
an
effort
to
help
address
this
country&#8217;s
fiscal
situation
and
oppose
asking
the
military
to
do
more.
Providing
for
the
common
defense
is
one
of
the
few
specific
Constitutional
requirements
of
the
federal
government
and
I
will
continue
to
fight
to
preserve
the
greatness
of
our
military.
On
a
related
matter,
I
promised
I
would
be
working
to
reverse
the
military
retiree
pensions
reforms
that
were
part
of
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act
passed
in
December.
I
am
pleased
to
report
this
goal
has
been
accomplished
and
was
done
without
raising
taxes.
I
believe
in
the
principle
of
&#8220;Promises
Made;
Promises
Kept&#8221;
and
I
am
glad
that
this
provision
of
the
Bipartisan
Budget
Act
of
2013
was
corrected
before
the
reduction
went
into
effect.
Providing
our
veterans
with
the
benefits
they
were
promised
is
the
least
we
can
do
to
demonstrate
support
for
our
troops,
retirees,
and
veterans.
Finally,
I
want
to
share
that
I
met
this
week
with
several
educators

the
Missouri

the

pre-school

As

I
take
great
interest
in
efforts
to
better
educate
our

they
