The 114 th
Congress continues to pick
up momentum, and we are forging ahead on new legislation.
I
want to share with you two important bills I have introduced
one to
protect and inform taxpayers, and another to promote pro-life principles
for adoptions.
In an era of strained budgets and increased
spending, it is important to hold the president and the Executive
Branch accountable on how Americans hard-earned tax dollars are
spent.
That is why I have introduced the
Taxpayer Transparency
Act
(H.R. 310).
My bill simply extends similar requirements
already imposed on the Legislative Branch to the Executive
Branch.
This bill requires Executive agencies to disclose that their
advertisements and certain communications are paid for at taxpayer expense
in mediums including printed mailers, brochures, television and radio
advertisements, billboards, and e-mail.
I am optimistic this
common sense piece of legislation can successfully move through both
chambers and land on the presidents desk.
I also
introduced the
Adoption Promotion Act
(H.R. 311), as I
continue fighting to protect the unborn and give children opportunities
for a happy, fulfilling childhood within a loving, caring family through
adoption.
The bill would ensure that all women accessing family
planning services with Title X funding are given pregnancy options
counseling, including professional adoption counseling.
The
Adoption Promotion Act
would also allow collection of data on
the effectiveness of pregnancy options counseling and adoption
counseling to make sure women are receiving the most effective counseling
possible for their child.
I am optimistic and looking forward
to seeing where the legislation heads as I work with my House
colleagues on these two measures.
The legislative measures I am
championing are about shining a light on how taxpayer dollars are spent and
helping children find loving families through
adoption.
