D e ar
Friends,
We are a nation built on
immigration, and it has made us strong.
My
grandparents, like so many others who immigrated to the United States, came
to this country looking for a better life and were privileged to pursue
the American dream.
Sadly, there are an
estimated 11.5 million undocumented immigrants living in the
proverbial shadows of our democracy.
Just
over a year ago, the U.S. Senate passed a comprehensive immigration
reform bill that gives undocumented immigrants a chance to earn their
citizenship by paying back taxes and getting in the same line as everyone
else.
I proudly co-sponsored the
Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization
Act, or H.R.15, in hopes that the U.S. House of Representatives would
pass our own version of the bill.
That
has not happened.
Those living on
the margins of our society are still here. Their fear and frustration
grows each day Congress refuses to fix our broken immigration
system.
There are millions of aspiring Americans
wishing to contribute to our society, and their contributions would
boost our bottom line.
The
Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that H.R. 15 would reduce the deficit by
$900 billion over the next two decades, including $200 billion over
the first 10 years. It would also create 159,000 new jobs for American
workers.
An estimated 79 percent of
Americans support comprehensive immigration reform, along with the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce and 600 business
organizations.
America is a better, stronger and more vibrant
place because of our diversity. We should give those who came here
seeking a better life a chance to pursue their dreams, just as we have done
for past generations.
Independence Day
should remind us of our nations core values. Closing our borders to
those in need is not the American
way.
Sincerely,
Eliot L. Engel
MEMBER OF
CONGRESS
