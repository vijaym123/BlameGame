David -- We need a last-minute miracle:
We&rsquo;re not just getting outspent by the Republicans&hellip; we&rsquo;re getting PUMMELED by Obama-bashing attack ads.
The fundraising deadline is tonight at MIDNIGHT.
We&rsquo;re STILL short of the 100,000 donations we&rsquo;ll need to close the gap.
Now, it&rsquo;s a race against the clock. If we can bring in 6,973 more donations before tonight&rsquo;s fundraising deadline, we&rsquo;ll reach President Obama&rsquo;s goal in just the nick of time.
David
