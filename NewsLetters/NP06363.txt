Boehner just announced
We&rsquo;re running out of time -- so we won&rsquo;t waste any:
Last night, we got word that Speaker Boehner's unleashing a
$1.85 MILLION
ad campaign against Brad. Boehner knows if he can outspend us right now -- in the critical moments before the election -- the damage could be irreversible.
We just ran the numbers: we need 200 more donations in the next 24 hours to take on Boehner&rsquo;s attacks.
So David, if you were planning to chip in for Brad&rsquo;s progressive campaign, do it now, while there&rsquo;s still time to fight back.
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;
Or donate another amount &gt;&gt;
Thanks,
Team Brad
