Video is Worth 1000 Pictures
On Tuesday, I testified before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on
Crime and Terrorism's hearing entitled "Body Cameras: Can Technology
Increase Protection for Law Enforcement Officers and the Public?"
I
also questioned
a panel of experts during the
hearing.
I strongly believe that body cameras are one piece of the puzzle to
rebuilding trust and aiding our law enforcement officers and our
communities. It is the best way to keep both officers and residents
safe. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a video is worth a
thousand pictures.
You can watch my full testimony below.

I continued the conversation on body-worn cameras with MSNBC's Morning
Joe
, CNN's Jake Tapper
, and Neil Cavuto with Fox News
throughout the week.
Raising Awareness to Save Lives
Today I joined Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) in launching the Senate
Prescription Abuse Prevention Caucus. Prescription drug abuse has
devasting effects on thousands of families across our nation. This is a
problem we must tackle from every angle, and I look forward to working
with Senator Manchin and our colleagues in the Senate to find solutions
and save lives.
Memorial Day
On Monday, let us all celebrate those who have died for our great
nation. It is our responsibility to say thank you to the brave men and
women who sacrificed their lives for our freedom. Their dedication will
never be forgotten.
Hurricane Preparedness Week
Hurricane Preparedness Week runs May 24-30. It is important that we all
