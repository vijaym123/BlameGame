The Congresswoman's recent tour of Taylor University was led by Student
Body President Bri Leever and Taylor Student Organization Executive
Secretary Noelle Smith.
Dear Friends,
As I travel the 5th District, I always enjoy visiting with local
employers and employees who fuel so many vital Hoosier industries. I've
learned we have many job openings in Indiana, and four million job
openings in this nation.
However, not enough people know about or are
ready to fill these job openings.
Solving this problem starts with
making sure our students are aware of the exciting career paths that
exist.
That's why I'm proud to announce a new signature event that combines my
passions for workforce development and K-12 education as well as my
work on the House Education and the Workforce Committee. "Connecting
Careers & Classrooms" is a series that will provide middle school and
high school counselors, teachers and administrators the tools and
information they need to help advise and prepare students for the jobs
of the 21st century. The first event takes place on Thursday, April 17
at Beck's Hybrids
Headquarters in Atlanta and focuses on
agribusinesses.
This is a series intended to bridge the gap between various sectors of
our economy and our schools while providing educators an inside look at
leading employers and the workforces they need. Our upcoming event will
also highlight current best practices between educators and
entrepreneurs that bring together students and career exploration.
Did you know food and agriculture is a $16 billion industry in Indiana
with the average job paying more than $58,000 a year? Unfortunately, in
my meetings with urban and rural high school and middle school students
it seems many aren't aware of these excellent opportunities. My hope is
this series will provide educators the information they need to better
advise our students on the classes they should consider taking to get
on a career path they might pursue.
To learn more about this important event, click here
. We still have
spots left, so if you're an educator please consider signing up. If you
happen to know of a counselor, teacher or administrator who may be
interested in attending, please consider forwarding this email.
Attendees will receive documentation for up to 6 and a half hours of
Professional Growth Points.
We also hope to hold future events on
sectors such as life sciences and technology and will keep you updated
on these events.
Thank you for taking the time to read this message and I hope you'll
take a few moments to read more about my recent activities below.
As
always, feel free to be in touch with any comments or suggestions you
may have. And remember to follow me on Facebook

to keep up with my latest activities.
Sincerely,
Susan W. Brooks

Dear

As

I

I've

Solving

announce
a
new

that
combines
my
passions for

&#8220;Connecting
