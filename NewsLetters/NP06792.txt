David --
As you read this, three different outside Republican groups are spending piles of cash in Illinois to defeat Brad.
Here&rsquo;s why: For more than 30 years, Republicans controlled this seat -- but then you stepped up to help us build an amazing movement of supporters to send Brad to Congress and turn the 10th district blue. As of 6pm, we still have $4,712 to go to hit our August goal.
If we don&rsquo;t close the gap before our monthly deadline, Republicans could be one step closer to getting their reliable ally Bob Dold back in Congress. We can&rsquo;t let that happen. David, will you please chip in $5 or more to help Brad close this final gap before the deadline? If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
This is just the beginning. Soon enough, even more Republican groups will try to play in this race and buy this seat for Bob Dold.
We're ready to push back against the attacks, but we are going to need your help. Please chip in a few dollars. 24 HOURS:
