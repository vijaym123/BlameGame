Earlier last week, we all took time to honor our veterans and
their sacrifices for this great nation.
Our prior servicemen and
women have given so much to this country, and although they may not
ask for any praise, it is important that we, as a nation, recognize
their service.
Having served as a Captain in the Marine Corps, Im
proud to join fellow veterans and Hoosiers each year in celebrating
Veterans Day.
This year, I had
the distinct privilege of attending several events in South Central
Indiana.
These events included the Martinsville Baptist
Tabernacle Church &amp; School program,
Jeremy R. McQueary
USMC Memorial Bridge ceremony
in Brown County, and
the NAACP event in Jeffersonville
with guest speaker Brigadier
General Wayne Black.
All of these events demonstrated our states
deep appreciation for service members, and it was great to have the
opportunity to speak with so many fellow Hoosier veterans.

Pictures Below)
In light of Veterans
Day, I want to take this opportunity to highlight some of our offices
initiatives and services to help
veterans.
Veterans
Services
For many of our Hoosier veterans, the backlog of
disability claims at the Veterans Administration continues to be a hurdle. In
addition to the backlog, our nations veterans still face other issues
like homelessness, unemployment, and mental and physical
injuries.
While I have joined initiatives to influence the administration to
take action, along with voting for legislation to help veterans, the
VA backlog and other issues continue to be challenges for veterans. In
light of these challenges, its important that veterans living in the
9th District understand the services provided by their Constituent
Service Centers.
Our office
provides a variety of services for veterans, including assistance with
TriCare or CHAMPVA problems, help with acquiring service medals, and any
other VA or Defense Department concerns.
Additionally, caseworkers
can help with VA disability claim issues you may be facing. While its
important to note that we cannot influence the VAs decision, we can
look into any paperwork or filing issues.
In regards to employment and training services, many times
veterans just need to be pointed in the right direction.
Our staff
will be happy to speak with you about the different federal and local
options out there for veterans seeking employment or further
education.
If you are facing any veteran
or active military issue, I encourage you to either contact the
Jeffersonville Constituent Service at 812-288-3999, or check out our
veteran/military services webpage at
http://toddyoung.house.gov/veterans-affairs-and-active-duty-military/ .
Our dedicated staff will help with whatever inquiry you may
have.
Hoosier Veteran
Voices
Like all Americans, I have
a deep appreciation for the great sacrifices our wartime veterans
have made for this country. Their service to our nation is the reason we
enjoy the freedoms we all cherish. Since their timeless stories are
essential to inspiring and fostering the patriotic appreciation of
future generations, it is important that we record the stories so that they
might be passed on.
Having
served in the Marine Corps and as a U.S. Representative, I am proud to
announce that your 9th District staff members are scheduling interviews
for Hoosier Veteran Voices, a program in conjunction with the Library of
Congress Veterans History Project to record and preserve the
personal narratives of wartime veterans.
While working as a staffer for
former Senator Lugar, I had the opportunity to conduct some of these
interviews for the Library of Congress records.
Im now excited
to build upon the work that he did by archiving stories from Southern
Indiana.
You can learn

And as always, if you
have any questions about the services our office provides, feel free
to contact our staff at any of the office
locations.
