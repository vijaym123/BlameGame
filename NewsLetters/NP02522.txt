The New York Times reports that the GOP could shut down the federal department that keeps us safe -- just to score political points with the Tea Party.
David -- We know you&rsquo;re a strong Democrat who cares about progressive issues. You&rsquo;ve stood up for Democratic values, ideas, and candidates in the past. But we were going through our records and we noticed you haven&rsquo;t renewed your DSCC membership for 2015:
DSCC Membership Status:
expired
2015 Membership Rate:
$5
(renew membership now)
Here&rsquo;s why we need you now:
Republican control over the House and Senate has been an epic disaster: Social Security, Obamacare, and abortion rights are all under threat.
The latest outrage? The
New York Times
reports that
the GOP could
shut down
the federal department that keeps us safe -- just to score political points with the Tea Party.
If that&rsquo;s how they govern now, how will they govern if they control all of Congress AND the White House?!
Bottom line: We don&rsquo;t want to find out. But we need all hands on deck as soon as possible to stop it.
Renewing your membership TODAY will allow us to hold GOP extremists accountable for their irresponsible actions,
take back the Senate, and keep the White House out of their hands.
