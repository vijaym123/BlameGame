Happy Thanksgiving!
Kansans know gratitude isnt reserved for any single time of year, but as Thanksgiving Day ushers in the holiday season we do take more time to reflect on our blessings and enjoy time with those we dont often see.
I travel to Washington D.C. to fight for Kansas values every week, but return home on weekends to ground myself in my blessings.
Spending time with people in our District, learning first-hand your ideas, thoughts, and concerns -- these connections help make me a better Representative.
I am thankful for the faith you have placed in me to represent you and the 4 th
District of this great state of Kansas.
May God bless you and your family now and always.
On behalf of Susan, Nick, and myself, we hope you have a blessed Thanksgiving.
Sincerely,
Mike Pompeo
Member of Congress
