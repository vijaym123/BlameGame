Happy Thanksgiving - What a profound idea President Lincoln had when setting aside a day for all of us to remember what we have to be thankful for. It is so quick and easy to say thanks, but it is so easy to forget the importance of that simple action. So today I would like to say thank you:
...To our brave men and women in the military and to our military families, to our veterans, to our police officers and fire officers, for they risk their lives daily to protect us and to save the lives of others;
...To our teachers, who work hard to educate and train our students to prepare them for our future;
...To my critics, who force me to think harder about my positions, to see if I may be missing something, and, thus, help me work better and smarter in service to the people of the Northern Mariana Islands;
...To my wife, Andrea, who, despite my absence from home over half the year, working in Washington, continues to hold our family together;
...To my Dad, who has now passed on, but whom I am just so blessed to have had as a loving, kind, and generous Father for 58 years; and
...To all who have entrusted me to represent them in Congress and given me the opportunity to make life better for everyone in our Commonwealth.
May you enjoy celebrating Thanksgiving today with family and friends.

2014 Congressional summer internship opportunity beckons - I received word this week that there are no applicants from the Northern Mariana Islands for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's summer 2014 Congressional Internship Program . So, if you are a college student from the NMI, I encourage you to consider applying. Selection is competitive; but the reward is a 12-week paid internship in the office of a Member of Congress with training in legislation, constituent casework, and legislative research. Interns also participate in a community service project and receive educational and professional training from the Institute. The program pays for round-trip travel to Washington D.C., housing, health insurance, and provides a $2,500 stipend. I became a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in part to open the door to this kind of opportunity, so I hope NMI students will look at all the internships, fellowships, and scholarships that CHCI has to offer. See an information packet here . And for more information about summer 2014 Congressional Internship go to http://www.chci.org/internships/.
