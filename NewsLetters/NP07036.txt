Dear
Friend,
I believe that every student who is
willing to work hard deserves a shot at a good education without being
buried in debt. While borrowers are struggling with increasingly
larger amounts of debt, federal law prevents students who have already
borrowed money from refinancing their loans when lower rates become
available.
That is why I am
cosponsoring the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing
Act. This would allow students to refinance their student loans, just
like they can on a car or a home, when lower rates are
available.

the commencement address at North Central
College
Providing
a high-quality education for our children is critical to our
countrys long-term economic success. Weve got some of the greatest
educational opportunities in the world, but weve got to make sure they are
financially accessible to our
students.
