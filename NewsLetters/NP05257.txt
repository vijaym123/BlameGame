TODAY ONLY: All Gifts
Triple-Matched President Obama and President Clinton asked for your help. Thanks to their efforts, we can now TRIPLE-MATCH all donations today!
We just got a look at the latest national poll -- and we have some great news (finally!):
FOX NEWS POLL: THE RACE FOR CONGRESS IS A DEAD-HEAT
That means we can deliver a shocking defeat to Boehner&rsquo;s Tea Party lackeys in this election!!!
But first, we have to close this budget gap.
We just got word that Boehner&rsquo;s allies launched a last-minute $3 MILLION attack in 7 must-win races. Now we need 5O,OOO supporters to answer President Clinton&rsquo;s call-to-action so we can fight these Republican attacks and fund our get-out-the-vote programs.
We know we&rsquo;ve asked a lot -- but we&rsquo;re so close to pulling off a stunning victory. We don&rsquo;t want to see it washed away by a last-minute Republican smear campaign.
David -- can you chip in $5 or $50 to fight Republicans&rsquo; deceptive attacks?
