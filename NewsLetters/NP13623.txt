Dear Friend,
I'm glad to be home in Memphis for the holidays after a long and
frustrating year in Congress. I hope that you and your loved ones have a
wonderful holiday season. Keep reading to learn what else happened this

Honoring the Late Nelson Mandela
In the last week, I attended a memorial service for the late Nelson
Mandela at the R.S. Lewis and Sons Funeral Home-the same funeral home
where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s body was taken for public viewing in
April of 1968. At the memorial service this week, I signed the guest
book and reflected on his great spirit and accomplishments. I will make
sure that the guest book gets to the Mandela family in South Africa.
Helping Memphians Get Covered by December 23rd
All Memphians should have quality health coverage and the President's
landmark Affordable Care Act-also known as Obamacare-is making
affordable, higher-quality coverage available to people who have not had
access to it in the past. Luckily, many who have been unable to afford
quality coverage in the past are now eligible to enroll in Tennessee's
Health Insurance Marketplace
, though the deadline to enroll for coverage that starts on January
1st is just 4 days away. If you do not have health insurance coverage,
you may also be eligible to save money on your health care premiums
in the
Marketplace.
If you are on Medicare or your employer is going to offer qualified
health insurance next year that you will enroll in, you're already
covered and won't need to enter the Marketplace for your health
coverage. If you aren't sure whether or not you will need to use the
Marketplace to get insurance, call the Marketplace Hotline at
1-800-318-2596 or visit www.HealthCare.gov
. You can also call my office or the Marketplace Hotline to
find out if TennCare (Tennessee's Medicaid program) is a coverage option
for you. If you are one of the millions of Americans who need health
insurance, you can sign up
for coverage that will take effect January 1, 2014 until
December 23, 2013. Enrollment in the marketplace will remain open until
March 31, 2014 if you miss the deadline for coverage starting in
January. Visit www.healthcare.gov
today to look at your options.
The Affordable Care Act is already working for families across the Ninth
District and the recent government shutdown didn't change that.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 147,000
individuals in the district now have health insurance that covers
preventive services without co-pays, $3.1 million in insurance premiums
have been returned to consumers, and more than 5,000 seniors on Medicare
paid a total of $5.9 million less for their prescription medications as
we continue to close the 'donut hole.' Also, health insurance companies
can no longer discriminate against patients with pre-existing conditions
and young adults up to age 26 can now stay on their parents' insurance
plan.
Many of the Marketplace website issues that have been in the news
recently have been resolved. However, the Marketplace website is only
one tool that you can use to sign up for coverage. If you are having
trouble accessing the website, please do not hesitate to call the
Marketplace Hotline at 1-800-318-2596 or attend one of Seedco
Mid-South's enrollment events for in-person help. Seedco's Navigators
will be at the Benjamin L. Hooks Central Library today and tomorrow to
help provide information and assist with in-person enrollment in
Marketplace health insurance options. They will be in the library's
Meeting Room B from 4:00 - 6:30 PM tonight (Thursday), in Meeting Room A
from 10:00 AM - 1:00 PM tomorrow (Friday), and Room L-56 from 2:00 -
4:00 PM tomorrow (Friday). You do not need to preregister to attend any
of these sessions. If you cannot make any of these sessions, you can
also visit the Seedco Mid-South office at 22 North Front Street (Suite
900), and they can be reached by phone at 901-528-8341. If you have any
other questions, you should also feel free to call my office at
901-544-4131.
Extending Coverage to Those Most in Need
While the technical problems with the health insurance Marketplace's
website are largely resolved, a political problem with another important
tool to help people access health care remains: TennCare has not been
expanded to include everyone that the Affordable Care Act allows it to
include. And sadly, our governor has failed to expand it-making health
insurance completely unattainable for some of the most vulnerable
Tennesseans. This week, I wrote a column in the Commercial Appeal about
why we must expand TennCare. You can read it here
.
Opposing Telephone Calls on Airplanes
Yesterday, I led a bipartisan group of 15 Members of Congress in urging
the FAA to keep the ban on in-flight calls in place
. I, along with my Congressional colleagues, share the concerns
of the flying public and the many professionals in the aviation industry
that such a change to the current rules disallowing the use of cell
phone voice networks could result in not only a markedly less pleasant
flying experience, but a less safe one as well.
Allowing passengers to make phone calls while in flight would disrupt
the right of consumers to enjoy the quiet comfort of their flight.
Simply put, the flying experience in the United States would be forever
changed for the worse if voice calls are allowed on flights. I hope that
the FAA considers our concerns and makes the right decision.
Senator Elizabeth Warren Joins My Effort to Ensure All Job Seekers Are
Treated Fairly
Using a job applicant's credit history to deny employment is not fair
because personal credit history is not an accurate predictor of job
performance. And worse still, without a job the chances of improving
one's credit rating can be significantly diminished, meaning that using
credit ratings to deny employment only perpetuates these cyclical
problems. According to TransUnion, Greater Memphis residents have among
the lowest average credit ratings in America.
My Equal Employment for All Act would help those with less-than-stellar
credit reports by prohibiting employers from using consumer credit
checks and bankruptcy filings in the hiring or firing processes. This
week, my bill got a big boost when U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren
introduced it in the Senate.
Having Senator Warren and other consumer champions like her on
our side is great news. I look forward to working with her in the coming
session of Congress to pass this important bill that will help Americans
who are looking for work.
Reining In the FISA Court and NSA Surveillance
This week, a federal judge originally appointed by President George W.
Bush ruled that some of the methods used by the National Security Agency
(NSA) to spy on American citizens were likely unconstitutional
. On Monday night, I spoke with Chris Hayes on MSNBC about some of
the ways we can help protect our rights-including my bill to change how
members of the FISA court, which oversees the NSA, are appointed. You
can watch my interview with Chris here
.
2014 U.S. Capitol Historical Society Calendars Are Available
My office currently has a limited number of 2014 U.S. Capitol Historical
Society calendars available. If you would like to receive next year's
calendar, please complete this short form on my website
. Due to the rules of
the House, I am only able to mail calendars to residents of Tennessee's
Ninth District. Please feel free to share this email with other citizens
of the Ninth District who may be interested in receiving one but who do
not receive my eNewsletter.
White House Internships
The White House Internship Program is currently accepting applications
from young people who are interested in government and devoted to public
service. If you-or anyone you know- would like to spend some time
working at the White House, gaining valuable professional experience and
building leadership skills, I would like to take this opportunity to
urge you to apply. The application deadline is January 5th, 2014. Click
here
for more information.
Grant Announcements
I regularly release a list of grant announcements from federal agencies
like the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, and others. These
federal funding opportunities are available to faith-based and
neighborhood associations, nonprofits and other community organizations
in the 9th District. The announcements are updated regularly on my
website
.

Honoring

In
the
last

I
attended
a
memorial
service
for
the
late
Nelson
Mandela
at
the
R.S.
Lewis
and
Sons
Funeral

home
where

in

of

At
the

this

I
signed
the

and
reflected
on
his
great
spirit
and
accomplishments.
I
will
make
sure
that
the
guest
book
gets
to

All

though
the

not
have
health
insurance
coverage,
you
may
also
be
eligible
to
save
money
on
your
health
care
premiums
in
the
Marketplace.
If
you
are
on
Medicare
or
your
employer
is
going
to
offer
qualified
health
insurance
next
year
that
you
will
enroll
in,
you&#8217;re
already

and
won&#8217;t

to

the

for

If

Hotline
to
find
out
if
TennCare
(Tennessee&#8217;s

you.
If
you
are
one
of
the
millions
of
Americans
who
need
health
insurance,
you
can
sign
up
for
coverage
that
will
take
effect
January
1,
2014
until
December
23,
2013.
Enrollment
in
the

if
you

coverage
starting

today
to

The
Affordable
Care
Act
is
already
working
for
families
across
the
Ninth
District
and
the
recent
government
shutdown
didn&#8217;t
change
that.
According
to
the
U.S.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services,
147,000
individuals
in
the
district
now
have
health
insurance
that
covers
preventive
services
without
co-pays,
$3.1
million
in
insurance
premiums
have
been
returned
to
consumers,
and
more
than
5,000
seniors
on
Medicare
paid
a
total
of
$5.9
million
less
for
their
prescription
medications
as
we
continue
to
close
the
&#8216;donut
hole.&#8217;
Also,
health
insurance
companies
can
no
longer
discriminate
against
patients
with
pre-existing
conditions
and
young
adults
up
to
age
26
can
now
stay
on
their
parents&#8217;
insurance
plan.

Extending
Coverage
to
Those
Most
in
Need
While
the
technical
problems
with
the
health
insurance
Marketplace&#8217;s
website
are
largely
resolved,
a
political
problem
with
another
important
tool
to
help
people
access
health
care
remains:
TennCare
has
not
been
expanded
to
include
everyone
that
the
Affordable
Care
Act
allows
it
to
include.
And
sadly,
our
governor
has
failed
to
expand
it&#8212;making
health
insurance
completely
unattainable
for
some
of
the
most
vulnerable
Tennesseans.
This
week,
I
wrote
a
column
in
the
Commercial
Appeal
about
why
we
must
expand
TennCare.
You

read
it

Senator
Elizabeth
Warren
Joins
My
Effort
to
Ensure
All
Job
Seekers
Are
Treated
Fairly
Using
a
job
applicant&#8217;s
credit
history
to
deny
employment
is
not
fair
because
personal
credit
history
is
not
an
accurate
predictor
of
job
performance.
And
worse
still,
without
a
job
the
chances
of
improving
one&#8217;s
credit
rating
can
be
significantly
diminished,
meaning
that
using
credit
ratings
to
deny
employment
only
perpetuates
these
cyclical
problems.
According
to
TransUnion,
Greater
Memphis
residents
have
among
the
lowest
average
credit
ratings
in
America.
My
Equal
Employment
for
All
Act
would
help
those
with
less-than-stellar
credit
reports
by
prohibiting
employers
from
using
consumer
credit
checks
and
bankruptcy
filings
in
the
hiring
or
firing
processes.
This
week,
my
bill
got
a
big
boost
when
U.S.
Senator
Elizabeth
Warren
introduced
it
in
the
Senate.
Having
Senator
Warren
and
other
consumer
champions
like
her
on
our
side
is
great
news.
I
look
forward
to
working
with
her
in
the
coming
session
of
Congress
to
pass
this
important
bill
that
will
help
Americans
who
are
looking
for
work.
Reining
In
the
FISA
Court
and
NSA
Surveillance
This
week,
a
federal
judge
originally
appointed
by
President
George
W.
Bush
ruled
that
some
of
the
methods
used
by
the
National
Security
Agency
(NSA)
to
spy
on
American
citizens
were
likely
unconstitutional .
On
Monday
night,
I
spoke
with
Chris
Hayes
on

about
some
of
the
ways
we
can
help
protect
our

my
bill
to
change
how

of

are
appointed.
