Dear Friends,
French Ambassador Francois Delattre will be visiting Northwest Ohio tomorrow as part of an economic and cultural visit I have arranged as Co-Chairman of the Congressional French Caucus. During his visit, the Ambassador will meet with business leaders, deliver an address at The University of Findlay and tour the Toledo Museum of Art's new exhibit,
The Art of the Louvres Tuileries Garden.
He
will also enjoy a traditional French meal prepared and served by The University of Findlay's Hospitality Management and Owens Community College's Culinary Arts students and will honor World War II veteran and Fifth Congressional District resident, Clyde Shull.
I would like to personally invite you to attend the Ambassador's address at The University of Findlay, which will be taking place from 3:00 to 3:45 pm at the Winebrenner Theological Seminary Auditorium, located at 950 N. Main St. in Findlay.
If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact my office at (419) 354-8700.
I look forward to seeing you there, as we welcome Ambassador Delattre to our hometown and showcase all that Northwest Ohio has to offer.
Sincerely,
Congressman Bob Latta
