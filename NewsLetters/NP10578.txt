Dear
Friend,
I'm writing you today to share some local
news and office updates that you might find useful.
Fire Restrictions Begin
Today
Earlier this
week, the National Forest Service released campfire and smoking
restrictions for the following forests: Coconino, Kaibab, Prescott and Tonto.
Under the restrictions, fires, campfires, charcoal, coal and wood
stoves are allowed in developed campgrounds only.
The restrictions also limit smoking to within
enclosed vehicles or buildings or in developed campgrounds.
Using
a device that is solely fueled by liquid petroleum or LPG fuels that
can be turned on and off is allowed in areas that are clear of
flammable materials.
Fireworks are always prohibited on all national
forest lands.
More details can be
found
here .
Still Getting Unwanted Phone
Calls?
Many people have contacted my team in the past,
frustrated with unsolicited calls from marketers, campaigns, and
businesses. This issue is not uncommon.
If you have experienced issues with unsolicited phone calls,
register your information with the Do-Not-Call Registry and the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC). The registry is nationwide in scope,
applies to all telemarketers (with the exception of certain non-profit
organizations), and covers both interstate and intrastate telemarketing
calls. Commercial telemarketers are not allowed to call you if your
number is on the registry, subject to certain
exceptions.
Register your telephone number
with http://www.donotcall.gov/ or by phone: 1-888-382-1222: for TTY call
1-866-290-4236.
You must call from the phone number you wish to
register.
If you
experience any difficulties or challenges in getting your number properly
registered on this Do-Not-Call list, please contact my
office.
Be Aware of Phishing
Emails
My staff has been alerted of a phishing email that has gone
out to many USAA consumers. Phishing emails are acts of identity theft
where the author intends to 'bait' the recipient into sharing personal,
sensitive information like usernames, passwords, phone numbers,
credit card details, etc. Many times a phishing email is disguised as an
official communication from a provider.
Click here to see the email being used as
bait.
If you believe you may have been a victim of the
phishing scam targeting USAA consumers, please contact USAA Website
Customer Support line immediately by calling 1-877-632-3002. More details on
how to contact USAA if you believe you're a victim of this fraud can
be found
here .
I hope this
information is helpful to you.
Have a happy and
blessed holiday weekend,

Spread the word!
I recently started highlighting district
businesses that are supporting job growth on my website. I want people who are
new to the area or interested in starting a business see how others
have succeeded in town.
I hope youll take a second to look at this page
and share the growth of the local business sector with friends and
family on Facebook or Twitter. I think its important to recognize the
hard work of those who are helping build a healthy
economy.
