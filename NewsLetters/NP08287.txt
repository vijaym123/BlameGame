David --
This morning, 5 male, Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices decided to roll back access to women&rsquo;s health care, the same care that we have been fighting so hard to protect.
In a blatantly partisan, deeply ideological decision, the Court shockingly gave employers full authority to deny women birth control coverage -- allowing bosses to impose their own personal beliefs on their employees. That's just wrong. David, I&rsquo;m pro-choice -- plain and simple.
It&rsquo;s 2014. Women should have the fundamental right to make their own healthcare decisions, with their doctor, free from the control of their employer.
David, if you believe every woman deserves the freedom to make her own healthcare choices, then I need you standing with me, now more than ever.
