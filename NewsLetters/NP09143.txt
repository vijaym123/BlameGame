Dear Friend,
Thank you very much for signing up for our eNewsletter. I appreciate
the opportunity to serve as your Representative. I wanted to give you
this update on our activities in the Second District and Washington,
D.C.
Memorial Day Weekend in Afghanistan
This Memorial Day weekend I joined a bipartisan congressional
delegation that visited troops in Afghanistan over Memorial Day
weekend.
I also met with U.S. military leaders, Afghan National
Security Forces (ANSF) officials, and intelligence officers to discuss
on the ground strategy and long-term planning going forward.
Visiting with troops stationed in Afghanistan
It was a real pleasure to be able to visit with our troops stationed in
Afghanistan, especially during a time when we pay tribute to our fallen
soldiers. I was encouraged to see the great work our troops are doing
overseas to protect our country and provide security abroad.
Family and Students Visit DC
It was a short but busy week in DC! It was great having my family with
me, and I'm happy I had the chance to visit with students from across
the district.
Taking the family with me to go vote
I'm glad students from Woodall Elementary were able to make it out to
the Capitol
Re-enlistment Ceremony
On Friday, I had the honor of hosting a re-enlistment ceremony at the
U.S. Capitol for Hospital Corpsman Third Class (HM3) Albert Terrell, a
native of Tahlequah, Oklahoma.
Albert, who will have served in the
Navy for 5 years this June, is originally from Tahlequah and attended
Gore High School. He is currently stationed in Indian Head, Maryland
and formally re-enlisted today.
The ranking officer begins the ceremony before Albert takes the oath.
I'm always humbled by the commitment of our nation's service members,
especially those like Albert who choose to continue their service.
Thank you all for your service to this country.
