Dear
Friend,
This week we lost one of God's gifts to mankind. I have long
thought of Nelson Mandela to be the epitome of Sainthood.
He was a
visionary and selfless leader, who was willing to make great sacrifices
in the pursuit of freedom and justice. We in Congress must fight
against inequality between the rich and the poor by raising the minimum
wage, and allowing people to earn a fair, livable income for their
work.
Madiba the Great : Not many would have
the courage and conviction to endure 27 years of imprisonment fighting
to free the people of South Africa from the racial oppression of
apartheid. Mandela spent his entire life fighting and suffering for
what was right, and he emerged from his battles with grace and
good-humor, not anger or bitterness. He is my personal hero and I will never
forget how humbled I felt when I first met him.
Ever since that day, I have thought to
myself: 'God spent a lot of time making Nelson
Mandela.'
But that is because Nelson Mandela was one of those special
people in human history.
He is a true inspiration to anyone who
has heard his story.
And even on this sad day, I find comfort in
knowing that his life and spirit will continue to inspire humankind
for generations to come. I hope we can take this period of mourning to
reflect on the powerful lessons Nelson Mandela has taught us.
We
must honor his life by renewing our dedication to social justice,
equality, and freedom for all peoples.
Fighting for
Equality &amp; Livable Wage:
The November jobs report, which
showed that the economy added 203,000 jobs and the unemployment rate
dropped to 7 percent -- the lowest unemployment rate in five years -- is
a sign of economic recovery. This week the President called on
Congress to raise the federal minimum wage, which currently stands at $7.25
an hour to $10.10.
This change would raise the incomes of 28
million Americans. For example, women make up nearly two-thirds of all
minimum wage workers. Over 40% of women are the primary breadwinners for
their household and single motherhood is steadily rising.
Consequentially, raising the livable wage would lift many families out of poverty
and decrease the need for public assistance. Raising the minimum wage
also puts money into the pockets of workers who need it the most,
resulting in a direct increase in their purchasing power. Increasing the
livable wage puts money back into the pockets of the American people
and has a positive effect on our economy.
