Dear
Friend,
Im proud to announce that the
Humane Society has given me a 100+ grade for my work in the 113th
Congress on its annual
scorecard.
This score reflects my pro-animal
voting record, plus extra credit for my leadership on animal-protection
issues.
Furthermore, Im proud that the Humane Society has recognized my
pro-animal record every year that I have been in the U.S.
Senate.
I look
forward to continuing this legacy and working to ensure animals
everywhere are protected and treated
humanely.
Check out the full scorecard
