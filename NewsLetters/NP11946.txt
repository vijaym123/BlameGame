Dear Neighbor,
Last week, I held a Telephone Town Hall in an effort to address your concerns about rising flood insurance rates. The call was joined by more than 3,900 residents from our district.
After giving a brief legislative update, I provided callers the opportunity to have their questions and concerns heard. We discussed the HOME Act, a bill I introduced to delay premium rate increases across the board, encourage homeowner mitigation through loan programs and tax credits, and require FEMA to conduct an affordability study. We discussed the passage of meaningful flood insurance reform through the Senate, and the current status of similar legislation in the House of Representatives.
According to a poll conducted during the event, over 60% of callers were negatively impacted by the Biggert-Waters Act. Callers, and other South Floridians like them, have seen anywhere from $5,000 to $50,000 rate increases. We discussed the need for immediate action, and I pledged my commitment to doing so. I encourage you to take a look at the articles below to find out more about what was said on the call.
House Majority Leader, Rep. Eric Cantor, has promised to take up a flood insurance reform bill in the House, so we must keep up the pressure. I promise to stay vigilant and keep fighting for this much needed reform.
