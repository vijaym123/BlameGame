Friend,
Ever since I was elected in 2012, I have made it my mission to change the culture in Washington,
but I quickly found out that not everyone shared my vision.
Not everyone wants to move our country forward, but I&rsquo;m not going to let that stop me.
My vision of a Congress that works for the people is within reach, and worth fighting for, but I can&rsquo;t do this alone.
Will you stand with me to change the culture in Washington and pitch in $5, $25 or whatever you can before our April deadline in 2 days? Your gift will be matched dollar for dollar.
If you&#39;ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt;&gt;
Chip in $25 immediately &gt;&gt;&gt;
Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt;&gt;
Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt;&gt;
Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt;&gt;
Chip in other amount immediately &gt;&gt;&gt;
I&rsquo;m doing everything I can to break through the partisan gridlock,
but I am facing resistance from the National Republicans who want to continue doing the same thing over and over.
I&rsquo;m not willing to accept mediocrity
and need your help to continue our fight for change.
Click here to give $5 or more and have your donation doubled.
Thanks again for your encouragement and support.
Be well,
Ami
P.S.
If we hit our $5,000 goal by the end of the month, our donor match will turn that into $10,000.
We don&#39;t want to miss this amazing chance--
w ill you chip in whatever you can today and have your donation doubled?
