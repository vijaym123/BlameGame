Listening to Central Florida
Dear Friend,
For the third year in a row, it was my pleasure to participate in the New Beginnings annual Celebrity Softball Game. Last Friday night, I coached members of the Clermont fire department to a win as we faced off against the Clermont police team, led by Senator Alan Hays. Two of my sons joined me for the evening, and it was great to support the work of Steve and Linda Smith and others with New Beginnings as they work to house the homeless in South Lake County.

Last Wednesday, I spent the day in Tavares, sitting down with city leaders and members of the economic development team to receive an update on several city projects and growth initiatives that will enhance the North Lake community. I also toured the Lake County Historical Museum, dropped by the Chamber of Commerce, and visited a couple of other local businesses in Tavares.

On Thursday, I spoke at the Lake Buena Vista Rotary Club about the services that my office provides, shared examples of how we have been able to help resolve specific situations for members of our community, and passed out copies of my
Constituent Service Guide.
After the meeting, I went to Downtown Disney to get a preview of the Disney Springs development and discuss the road and transportation projects that will provide easier access for both tourists and members of our local community.
Some of the other groups and organizations that I got to speak with included:
- Florida Association of Veteran Owned Businesses in Orlando
- Kingdom Walk in Winter Haven
- Lake County Childrens Services Council in Tavares
- Healthcare Marketing Professionals in Tavares
- West Orange Chamber of Commerce Government Advocacy Committee
- Central Florida Brazilian American Chamber of Commerce

Several local students with the Bank of America Student Leadership Program recently went to Washington after working on community service projects this summer. It was a pleasure to sit down with them last week at the Bank of America branch in Ocoee to hear about their service experiences and answer questions about my philosophy on government and how they can make a difference.
Your servant,
Daniel Webster
Member of Congress
Constituent Corner:
This summer, a constituent from Orlando contacted my office regarding her passport application. Although she had mailed in her renewal application in a timely fashion, the constituent was concerned because she was scheduled to fly on a mission trip the following week and had not received her new passport. My staff followed up with the Department of State to verify that the Passport Agency had received all the necessary documentation and was processing the application. They confirmed that the passport was being processed and provided the tracking number. My staff was happy to later get confirmation that the constituent had received her passport in time for the trip.
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape.
We are here to serve you.
Share Your View:
Last week, a video was posted online revealing the horrifying and cowardly execution of James Foley, an American journalist who had been captured by the terrorist group ISIS. After hearing of her sons death, Diane Foley wrote the following message on Facebook, We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.
Do you believe the escalating attacks on Americans and our security interests abroad warrant additional action against ISIS by our Armed Forces?
Yes
No
I don't know

Legislative Update:
Several meetings I had last week included discussions on economic development and how to facilitate growth in Central Florida. One of the developments I shared was the impact that the Water Resources Reform and Development Act will have on our State and the Central Florida region. I also discussed the importance of the widening of I-4, and my ongoing conversation with U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx and Florida Department of Transportation Secretary Ananth Prasad to ensure federal cooperation with the timetable the contractors will be working on to complete this critical project.
Earlier this year, I participated in a freight panel composed of some of members of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. We traveled to several different locations around the country in order to access our nation's transportation infrastructure and make recommendations on how to enhance the economic growth opportunities a modernized, cohesive infrastructure system can provide.
