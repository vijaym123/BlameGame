Like many parents, I cherish the memories I have of tucking my children into bed at night when they were young. Switching on the night light. Reading that favorite bed time story. Giving that one last good night kiss.
As a father, nothing pulls at my heartstrings more than to think of the approximately 400,000 American children who dont get tucked in by a parent every night
children who are growing up without a permanent, loving family or home. Recently, I cosponsored the Children in Families First Act,
H.R. 4143 , which will streamline the international adoption process for American adoptive parents.
May is Foster Care Month, but the problem wont disappear on June 1 st
and our commitment to these children cannot end there either. Every child deserves a safe and loving childhood, and I will continue to fight until that is a reality.
Yours in service,
Randy
