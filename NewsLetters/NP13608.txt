Dear Friend,
Rep. Waxman Joins 24-Hour Fast for Immigration Reform
On November 26, I joined with leaders from Los Angeles's faith, civic,
and business communities in a 24-hour fast to show solidarity with the
growing national effort to pass comprehensive immigration reform.
While the Senate passed the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and
Immigration Modernization Act (S. 744) on June 27 by a strong
bipartisan vote of 68-32, the House of Representatives has yet to act.
A large majority of Americans support comprehensive immigration reform.
I am a cosponsor of H.R. 15, comprehensive immigration reform
legislation that has been introduced in the House. Updating and
reforming our immigration policies would strengthen our economy, create
jobs, and bolster our national security. You can count on me to
continue to push for a vote on this important legislation.
You can find a summary of H.R. 15 here
.
Bringing Aerospace Jobs to California
On November 25, I spoke at the Torrance Area Chamber of Commerce's
State of the Region luncheon about the importance of aerospace industry
as a key driver of the economy in Southern California. Our region has a
rich history of aerospace manufacturing and our skilled workforce is
second to none.
That is why Southern California is uniquely positioned to host the
production of Boeing's new 777X airplane.
I am working hard with other
Southern California Members of Congress to bring its production to our
area.

copy of a letter to Boeing CEO James McNerney.
These flashbacks show how e-cigarettes are marketed today using the
same tactics from the '50s and '60s, when cigarettes were marketed to
kids as an act of rebellion.
E-Cigarette Flashbacks
In November I contacted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about
efforts by electronic cigarette companies to target young smokers with
the same advertising and marketing practices that major cigarette
companies used for decades to hook teen smokers.
I have also released an online presentation that shows how the
advertisement strategies once used by the cigarette companies to
attract young smokers are now being used by the e-cigarette companies.
Advertising expenditures have skyrocketed and the use of e-cigarettes
by kids doubled between 2011 and 2012. FDA action is essential to
ensure that e-cigarette makers don't hook a new generation of our kids
on nicotine.
The online presentation is available here
and you can find my letter to the FDA here
.
Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria
On December 12, the Food and Drug Administration announced new policies
to limit the widespread use of medically important antibiotics in meat
and poultry production.
I was glad to see the FDA take this important
first step toward preserving the effectiveness of our most important
human antibiotics.
I will be watching closely to see if this voluntary
approach is effective.
Earlier this year, I introduced the Delivering Antimicrobial
Transparency in Animals (DATA) Act, which would increase our knowledge
of how antibiotics and other antimicrobials are used in food-producing
animals. This legislation would be an important complement to FDA's
guidance. You can find more information about the DATA Act here
.
Safe Climate Caucus Milestone
December 3 marked the 100th day that members of the Safe Climate Caucus
spoke on the House floor about the defining environmental challenge of
our time: climate change.
As a cofounder of the Safe Climate Caucus, I am working to do all I can
to raise public awareness of scientists' warnings about climate change.
Members of the Safe Climate Caucus will continue to speak out about
climate change and to push for legislative action to address it.
