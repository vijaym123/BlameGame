I'm disappointed.
I was just updated on our fundraising before tonight&rsquo;s ad buy deadline. It's not good.
My team doesn't know what else to do. They've tried everything. That's why I am coming directly to you.
And I&rsquo;ll be blunt: If you don't step up, Rove's Obama-bashing ad blitz is going to steamroll us.
So David, chip in today if you can. This could not be more important. ALL GIFTS TODAY MATCHED! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
Thanks,
Nancy
