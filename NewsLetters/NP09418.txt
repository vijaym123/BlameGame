Hello--
Earlier today, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act. This marks the 53 rd
year in a row that the House has advanced a defense authorization bill.
Mississippi has a rich history of patriotism. Year after year, our state is voted amongst the top five states as having the most National Guardsmen per capita. During a time when less than one percent of Americans are volunteering for military service, Mississippians constantly stand up and answer the call.
This is one of many reasons why Congress should provide support for our service members.
The House-passed bill ensures that we have at least 11 aircraft carriers operating and blocks the retirement of some of Americas most capable Navy cruisers. The legislation also authorizes funds to build another amphibious assault ship for the U.S. Marine Corps that will be built on the Mississippi Gulf Coast.
By focusing on our military, veterans, and their families, Congress continues to fulfill its duty to provide for a common defense. It is my hope that the Senate acts swiftly so that Congress can get a final bill to the presidents desk.
God Bless,
Gregg Harper
Member of Congress
