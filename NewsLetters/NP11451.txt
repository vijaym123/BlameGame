Dear Neighbor,
I hope our update finds
you well this week.
As I head back home from Washington today, I want
to remind you of more
town halls tomorrow , March 15th, in Ontario,
Seneca and Tompkins counties.
Feel Free to forward this email along to
any friends, family or neighbors who might also be interested in
attending.
Looking forward to seeing many of you tomorrow at the town
halls.
VIDEO: REED OFFERS &ldquo;HAND UP ACT&rdquo; AS A PATHWAY OUT OF POVERTY
We introduced a bill this week to give states flexibility and creativity to fix our broken welfare system. The bill allows states to apply for five-year demonstration projects to test social welfare programs best suited for individual states. With more Americans living in poverty today than ever before, we have a responsibility to care for them and
help them out of the poverty trap .
REED FIGHTING FOR BILL TO PROTECT SENIORS
Working to reauthorize the
Older Americans Act , we met in Big Flats with representatives from Offices for the Aging, AARP chapters and senior groups to listen to their input. We&rsquo;re taking the lead to protect nutrition programs like Meals on Wheels, transportation services, support for family caregivers and programs to prevent senior abuse and neglect. More on our
AARP endorsed
bill and roundtable discussion
here .
TOM REED SUPPORTS MONTEREY SHOCK EFFORTS
Monterey Shock is an effective resource in our community with a proven track record of drastically reducing recidivism rates and in doing so, turning countless lives around for the better. This is a caring program that works from which taxpayers receive a fair return on investment. I will continue to work with local leaders to
keep the Monterey Shock facility open
and serving the community.
REED VOTES FOR VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER, VETERAN PROTECTIONS UNDER OBAMACARE
Congress had opportunities to protect two significant community groups from additional Obamacare costs this week:
volunteer firefighters and EMS personnel
and
veterans . Both bipartisan bills passed the House with strong support. More on the
Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act
and
Hire More Heroes Act
on our
website .
U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HONORS REED
Here with U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Tom Donohue to receive the &ldquo;Spirit of Enterprise&rdquo; award.
I was proud to receive the U.S. Chamber of Commerce&rsquo;s &ldquo; Spirit of Enterprise &rdquo; award for supporting pro-jobs, pro-growth policies. Getting government out of the way by cutting red tape, lowering taxes and reducing Washington spending is a fair way to care for our job creators.
REED ANNOUNCES SALAMANCA SCHOOL DISTRICT IMPACT AID
The $2.7 million we were proud to secure for the Salamanca School District will
decrease property taxes
for residents, putting more money in their pockets and investing in the education of our children.
