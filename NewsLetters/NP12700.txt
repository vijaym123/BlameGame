You Can't Make This Stuff Up
Monday, February 3, 2014
As many will remember, in 2010, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, but we have to pass the bill [Obamacare] so that you can find out what is in it
Last week, when asked on
The Daily Show
why its so hard to get a company to execute the Obamacare website competently, Pelosi said, I dont know and Well, its not my responsibility.
Let me see if I have this right.
According to Pelosi, we had to pass Obamacare to know what was in it, but now that it doesnt work, whats in it wasnt her responsibility?!?
You cant make this stuff up!
