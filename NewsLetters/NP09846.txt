Dear Neighbor,
On Sunday, we honor and thank all mothers for their dedication to what is the ultimate full time job. The youngest of 12 children, my mother served as the pillar in our family, raising six of us on Social Security and my father's military death benefit after my father passed away when I was just two years old. We watched our mother carry on, putting everything she had into raising us in the house my grandfather built. She will always hold a special place in my heart. To all of the moms who can&rsquo;t be replaced, Happy Mother&rsquo;s Day!
REED CONDEMNS &ldquo;SECRET WAITING LISTS&rdquo; AT PHOENIX VA
I am outraged by the
disturbing allegations
of neglect within the Phoenix VA. Covering up unacceptable wait times that may have resulted in the death of more than 40 of our nation&rsquo;s heroes is appalling. Immediately after news broke of the actions taking place in Phoenix, I spoke with the Bath VA director and other local VA directors to personally confirm similar activities are not happening in our backyard. Our veterans deserve the best care. They should never have to wait years &ndash; or even months &ndash; for the benefits they earned serving our country.
REED COSPONSORS U.S. INNOVATION THROUGH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The
&ldquo;American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2014,&rdquo;
passed in the House Friday, will increase opportunities for American research and development by making the innovation tax credit permanent. With the highest corporate tax rate in the world, we are doing job creators a disservice by unfairly leaving them guessing at each short-term extension. Giving job creators certainty will increase R&amp;D in the United States and make it easier for employers to add jobs.
TOM REED SAVES 645 JOBS WITH INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
Earlier this week we announced $465,000 for the Town of Wellsville to devote to the construction of public water system improvements along the Route 417 corridor. The funding will sustain 645 local jobs and will help create 18 new jobs. We were pleased to be able to work with the town to facilitate the grant and see that the project funding was awarded. See what the Wellsville town supervisor had to say about the increased support

COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE BENGHAZI WILL GIVE AMERICANS ANSWERS, ACCOUNTABILITY REED SAYS
We should care deeply about every American life lost and take every measure to protect our diplomats and service men and women. As a co-sponsor of the resolution to establish the select committee, I believe every American deserves to know the truth as to why four Americans lost their lives. The Administration continues to ignore subpoenas, withhold documents and deny a full investigation but I believe Americans deserve accountability from their government.
