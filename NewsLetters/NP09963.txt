Congressman Lamborn Protects our
Aerial Firefighting Fleet
5/7/14
As part of
today's all-day mark-up amendment session for the 2015 National Defense
Authorization Act, Congressman Doug Lamborn's inserted language ensuring
that the Air Force C-130 Modular Airborne Firefighting System (MAFFS)
aerial firefighting aircraft based at Peterson Air Force Base are not
removed without certification from the Secretary of the Air Force
that there will be no danger posed to the ongoing, nationwide
firefighting mission. Congressman Lamborn is extremely familiar with the
necessity of the MAFFS mission, having been closely involved in getting the
aircraft deployed as rapidly as possible during the Waldo Canyon and
Black Forest Wildfires of 2012 and 2013.

AMENDMENT
Amendment
Language
"The
Secretary of the Air Force may not remove C130 aircraft from a unit of the
regular or reserve components of the Air Force that is tasked with the
modular airborne fire fighting system mission, or from a unit that is
formally associated with a unit that is tasked with such mission, until
the date on which the Secretary of the Air Force certifies to the
congressional defense committees that such mission will not be negatively
affected by the removal of such
aircraft."
My amendment is designed to protect the
mission of our MAFFS aerial firefighting fleet. This amendment will
prevent the Air Force from removing C-130s dedicated to aerial
firefighting unless or until they can certify to this committee that no danger
to the firefighting mission will occur.
Our aerial
firefighting assets are already scarce and precious. They are a most
visible firefighting tool and become of extreme importance to the
communities that they assist. Thats why we must not go down the path of
expediency by moving to limit our aerial firefighting assets in any
way.
Catastrophic wildfires are a concern in my district and
throughout the nation. It was critical to adopt this amendment in order
to ensure that no precipitous decisions are made regarding any
reductions to our MAFFS aerial firefighting
fleet.
