Nancy Pelosi doesn&rsquo;t email if it&rsquo;s not important, but she did for Brad -- and now I am following up: Republicans are set to outspend Brad&rsquo;s campaign by
half-a-million dollars
in the final 3 weeks of the Election.
If we don&rsquo;t close the gap for Brad, my new neighbor to the North will be a Republican rubber-stamp.
Thanks... but no thanks.
David -- 36 days to go. Chip in today, close the gap, and help send Brad Schneider back to Congress.
