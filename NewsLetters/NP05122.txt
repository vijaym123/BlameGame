CRAIN&rsquo;S CHICAGO BUSINESS:
&ldquo;Schneider, Dold in a dead heat in North Shore congressional race&rdquo;
We just got the news: A brand new poll shows Brad
trailing
Republican Bob Dold by 2 points.
That's as close as it gets!
Look, this poll doesn&rsquo;t tell us anything we didn&rsquo;t already know.
Our race will go down to the wire, and the winner will be determined by who fights harder in the final two weeks.
So we&rsquo;ve got to on offense for Brad -- we&rsquo;ve got to get the facts to Illinois voters
before
they cast their ballots.
David -- we&rsquo;ve got 12 days left. If you were thinking about making a donation to Brad -- or increasing your previous support -- please do it now, while there's still time to make a difference.
