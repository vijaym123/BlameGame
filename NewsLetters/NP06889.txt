Dear Friends,
I am looking for college interns for the fall and spring semesters to work in my Visalia and Washington, D.C. offices. My current interns drew up a list of reasons to
apply:
Top 10 Reasons You Should Intern for Congressman Nunes
10.
You will encounter political figures whom you have only seen on television.
9.
You will never be hungry because the offices have infinite amounts of jelly bellies and pistachios to snack on, and sometimes youll even get doughnuts.
8.
You will have a unique and often comical story to share with your friends and family after every workday.
7.
You will constantly be amused by the staffs sense of humor. (Some may call it sophomoric.) Youll get this once you meet Chief of Staff Johnny
Amaral.
6.
You will become buddies with the Capitol Police, the Sparkletts Water Guy, and Art the Mailman.
5.
You will never be bored because you will get to talk to new people on the phone all day and conduct tours for visiting constituents.
4.
You will start answering your personal cell phone by saying, Office of Congressman Nunes.
3.
You will become an expert at Google and acquire a whole new government-themed vocabulary.
2.
You will always look snazzy because business casual is totally in.
1.
You will develop lifelong friendships, and your rsum will look great.
You can find more information and applications for internships on my website
here
or by calling (559) 733-3861.
Sincerely,
Devin Nunes
