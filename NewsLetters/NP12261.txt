Have You Had Enough?
Dear Friend,
I don't know about you, but I'm fed up with the federal government
wasting the money of hard-working taxpayers. One of my top priorities
this year is to eliminate as much waste, fraud and abuse as possible
through any and all means necessary. You deserve to have a lean,
efficient federal government, but that's not what you have now.
Although we must make tough choices to reign in spending, we can make
that happen. The easiest place to start is eliminating waste, fraud and
abuse. I wrote an op-ed, which appeared in Monday's online edition of
The Arizona Republic, about ways Congress can eliminate the prolific
waste within the federal bureaucracy. Click HERE

Stopping Union Kickbacks
I was happy to spearhead a Arizona Republican Delegation letter
to the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA), which was delivered on Thursday,
commending its decision to move forward with construction of the new
control tower at Tucson International Airport under a competitive
bidding process. Every Republican member of Arizona's Delegation signed
the letter, including Reps. Trent Franks (AZ-08), Matt Salmon (AZ-05),
and David Schweikert (AZ-06) as well as Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and
Jeff Flake (R-AZ).
Prior to this decision, every Democrat in Arizona's Delegation signed a
letter
to the FAA requesting that it impose a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) on
contractors building the facility. The Democrats' reckless efforts to
increase federal spending cannot be ignored. Our country is in serious
financial distress and one of the reasons is wasteful spending typical
of PLAs. One of the best ways to put our nation back on a fiscally
sustainable path is to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse. Part of
eliminating waste is discontinuing the use of frivolous,
Democrat-advocated labor agreements, which do nothing but line union
pockets with taxpayer money.
I applaud the FAA for using common sense and moving forward under a
competitive bidding process. A PLA is nothing more than a special union
kickback. These deals are both unnecessary and incredibly wasteful.

Reducing Food Stamp Waste
On Monday, I became an original co-sponsor of the SNAP Verify Act of
2014, which would require people using an Electronic Benefit Transfer
(EBT) card through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
(SNAP), also known as food stamps, to produce photo identification.
The easiest way to save taxpayer money is to eliminate waste, fraud and
abuse. The most effective way to accomplish this is to require strict
oversight of federal programs. As a dentist, I call the current
oversight of the SNAP program toothless.
This bill provides commonsense oversight of a rapidly expanding program
by requiring users of SNAP EBT cards to show their photo ID when making
purchases. It only makes sense that individuals utilizing federal
assistance benefits should verify their identity not only to safeguard
taxpayer dollars but also to protect the integrity of the program for
those who need it most. It's time to address rampant waste in the SNAP
program. Click HERE

Saving Jobs by Reigning in the EPA
On Tuesday, I announced my co-sponsorship of the Secret Science Reform
Act of 2014, which would require the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) to use public, reproducible science when proposing regulations.
This bill will eliminate the use of junk science at the EPA, which
frequently uses secret studies to justify regulations that fit their
job-killing agenda. Not only does this practice result in a lack of
transparency, it also leads to hundreds of thousands of jobs being
killed across the country by unreasonable regulations. On the heels of
January's disappointing jobs report, the Obama Administration should be
focused on growing the economy instead of proposing new job-killing
regulations under the guise of phony science.
Additionally, hardworking taxpayers are left to pick up the tab for
these expensive, and usually worthless, regulations. This bill simply
requires the EPA to use scientific studies that are transparent and
reproducible when justifying proposed regulations. Only in the federal
bureaucracy do you have to legislate such commonsense requirements.

Another Day, Another ObamaCare Delay
Also on Monday, the Obama Administration announced a second unilateral
delay of ObamaCare's employer mandate, which now won't be fully
implemented for mid-size businesses until 2016.
President Obama has established a pattern of ignoring his
constitutionally mandated duty to faithfully execute the law. While I
welcome a delay of ObamaCare's disastrous effects - especially a
permanent delay in the form of a patient-centered, free-market
replacement - the Constitution does not allow the President to pick and
choose which part of the law to enforce and implement. It's a tragedy
that our President has become lawless; the actions of the Executive
Branch are dictatorial.
This unilateral delay is further proof that the fundamentally flawed
ObamaCare is not viable. I'm deeply disturbed that the President
decided to allow this unilateral delay for mid-size businesses while
remaining steadfast in his opposition to doing the same thing for
individual Americans who have had their plans cancelled and seen their
premiums skyrocket. The President and Harry Reid shut down the
government in October after I and other Republicans sought a delay for
individuals through the proper legislative channels. It's time for the
Administration to stop picking winners and losers and either enforce
the law on the books or repeal and replace ObamaCare outright. Click

I Won't Stop Until Justice is Served
Manuel Osorio-Arellanes, who was one of the people who murdered Border
Patrol Agent Brian Terry, was sentenced to 30 years in prison on
Monday. I hope this sentencing brings some degree of solace to Brian
Terry's family. But justice is not yet achieved.
There are others directly involved in this murder who haven't been
tried in U.S. courts and there are government officials who continue to
deny responsibility for, and prior knowledge of, Operation Fast and
Furious. Agent Terry's death is a stain on the federal government, and
as a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, I
will continue to do everything in my power to hold those officials
responsible in order to prevent a tragedy like this from ever occurring
again. Click HERE

Our Nation has a Spending Addiction
Unfortunately, I couldn't be in D.C. to vote on the debt ceiling
increase because I'm scheduled to have hip replacement surgery; I guess
I'm finally paying the price of playing rugby all through college and
dental school. The vote for the debt ceiling increase was set suddenly,
as Congress closed early this week due to a big storm heading towards
D.C. Had I been able to vote, however, I would have voted AGAINST
raising the debt ceiling because it didn't contain a single reform.
Back in 2011, we reached an understanding that if we're going to raise
the debt ceiling and not jeopardize the nation's credit, then we need
to attach reforms to each debt ceiling increase so that we reduce the
need to constantly raise the debt ceiling and start living within our
means. This increase violates those principles.
Although some called this a "clean" debt ceiling increase, there is
nothing clean about borrowing another trillion dollars; this is as
messy as it gets and the term "clean" is propaganda as far as I'm
concerned.
The bottom line is that our nation has a spending addiction - it's past
the point of a problem - when we must continually raise the debt
ceiling to accommodate our dangerous spending habits. At what point
does it stop? How is it possible that we couldn't include a single
reform in this legislation?
I don't want our country to default but I wouldn't have voted to give
the President a blank check. The federal government will collect an
estimated $3 TRILLION in taxes from October 1, 2013 until September 30,
2014. We do have the ability to live within our means and it's time we
make the hard decisions necessary to make that happen.

The

Our

Reducing
Food
Stamp
Waste
On
Monday,
I became
an
original co-sponsor
of
the
SNAP
Verify
Act
of
2014,
which
would
require
people
using
an
Electronic
Benefit
Transfer
(EBT)
card
through
the

(SNAP),
also
known

to
produce
photo

The
easiest
way
to
save
taxpayer
money
is
to
eliminate
waste,
fraud
and
abuse.
The
most
effective
way
to
accomplish
this
is
to
require
strict
oversight
of
federal
programs.
As
a
dentist,
I
call
the
current
oversight
of
the
SNAP
program
toothless.
This
bill
provides
commonsense
oversight
of
a
rapidly
expanding
program
by
requiring
users
of
SNAP
EBT
cards
to
show
their
photo
ID
when
making
purchases.
It
only
makes
sense
that
individuals
utilizing
federal
assistance
benefits
should
verify
their
identity
not
only
to
safeguard
taxpayer
dollars
but
also
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
program
for
those
who
need
it
most.
It&#8217;s

rampant

Saving
Jobs
by
Reigning
in
the
EPA
On
Tuesday,
I
announced
my
co-sponsorship
of
the
Secret
Science
Reform
Act
of
2014,
which
would
require
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(EPA)
to
use
public,
reproducible
science
when
proposing
regulations.
This
bill
will
eliminate
the
use
of
junk
science
at
the
EPA,
which
frequently
uses
secret
studies
to
justify
regulations
that
fit
their
job-killing
agenda.
Not
only
does
this
practice
result
in
a
lack
of
transparency,
it
also
leads
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
jobs
being
killed
across
the
country
by
unreasonable
regulations.
On
the
heels
of
January's
disappointing
jobs
report,
the
Obama
Administration
should
be
focused
on
growing
the
economy
instead
of
proposing
new
job-killing
regulations under
the
guise
of
phony
science.
Additionally,
hardworking
taxpayers
are
left
to
pick
up
the
tab
for
these
expensive,
and
usually
worthless,
regulations.
This
bill
simply
requires
the
EPA
to
use
scientific
studies
that
are
transparent
and
reproducible
when
justifying
proposed
regulations.
Only
in
the
federal
bureaucracy
do
you
have
to
legislate
such
commonsense
requirements.

Another
Day,
Another
ObamaCare
Delay
Also
on
Monday,
the
Obama
Administration
announced
a
second
unilateral
delay
of ObamaCare's
employer
mandate,
which
now
won't
be
fully implemented for
mid-size
businesses
until
2016.
President
Obama
has
established
a
pattern
of
ignoring
his
constitutionally
mandated
duty
to
faithfully
execute
the
law.
While
I
welcome
a
delay
of
ObamaCare&#8217;s
disastrous
effects
-
especially
a
permanent
delay
in
the
form
of
a
patient-centered,
free-market
replacement
-
the
Constitution
does
not
allow
the
President
to
pick
and
choose
which
part
of
the
law
to
enforce
and
implement.
It's
a
tragedy
that
our
President
has
become
lawless;
the
actions
of
the
Executive
Branch
are
dictatorial.
This
unilateral
delay is
further
proof
that the
fundamentally
flawed
ObamaCare
is
not
viable.
I&#8217;m
deeply
disturbed
that
the
President
decided
to
allow
this
unilateral
delay
for
mid-size
businesses
while
remaining
steadfast
in
his
opposition
to
doing
the
same
thing
for
individual
Americans
who
have
had
their
plans
cancelled
and
seen
their

skyrocket.
The
President
and
Harry
Reid
shut
down
the
government
in
October
after
I
and
other
Republicans
sought
a
delay
for
individuals
through
the
proper
legislative
channels.
It&#8217;s
time
for
the
Administration
to
stop
picking
winners
and
losers
and
either
enforce
the
law
on
the
books
or

and

Our
Nation
has
a
Spending
Addiction
Unfortunately,
I
couldn&#8217;t
be
in
D.C. to
vote
on
the
debt
ceiling
increase
because
I&#8217;m
scheduled
to
have
hip
replacement
surgery;
I
guess
I&#8217;m
finally
paying
the
price
of
playing
rugby
all
through
college
and
dental
school.
The
vote
for
the
debt
ceiling
increase
was
set
suddenly,
as
Congress closed
early
this
week
due
to
a
big
storm
heading
towards
D.C.
Had
I
been
able
to
vote,
however,
I
would
have
voted
AGAINST
raising
the
debt
ceiling
because
it
didn&#8217;t
contain
a
single
reform.
Back
in
2011,
we
reached
an
understanding
that
if
we&#8217;re
going
to
raise
the
debt
ceiling
and
not
jeopardize
the
nation&#8217;s
credit,
then
we
need
to
attach
reforms
to
each
debt
ceiling
increase
so
that
we
reduce
the
need
to
constantly
raise
the
debt
ceiling
and start
living
within
our
means.
This
increase
violates
those
principles.
Although
some
called
this
a
&#8220;clean&#8221;
debt
ceiling
increase,
there
is
nothing
clean
about
borrowing
another
trillion
dollars;
this
is
as
messy
as
it
gets
and
the
term
&#8220;clean&#8221;
is
propaganda
as
far
as
I&#8217;m
concerned.
The
bottom
line
is
that
our
nation
has
a
spending
addiction
&#8211;
it&#8217;s
past
the
point
of
a
problem
&#8211;
when
we
must
continually
raise
the
debt
ceiling
to
accommodate
our
dangerous
spending
habits.
At
what
point
does
it
stop?
How
is
it
possible
that
we
couldn&#8217;t
include
a
single
reform
in
this
legislation?
I
don&#8217;t
want
our
country
to
default
but
I
wouldn&#8217;t
have
voted
to
give
the
President
a
blank
check.

will
collect
an
estimated
$3

2014.
We
do
have
the
ability
to
live
within
our

and
it&#8217;s
time
we
make
the
hard
decisions
necessary
to
make
that
happen.
