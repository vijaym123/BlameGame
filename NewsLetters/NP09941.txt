Dear Friend,
Every year, I have the privilege of nominating young men and women for admission to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, the U.S. Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at King's Point.
I would like to announce that the application for the class of 2019 is now LIVE on my website.

to access the application.
Candidates interested in seeking a nomination from my office to one of these academies must request a copy of my application packet in addition to applying directly to the Academy's Admissions office. I encourage you to contact other nominating sources, such as your U.S. Senators, be certain to confirm their deadlines and application requirements as procedures may differ between offices.
Basic Requirements For Service Academy Eligibility
Must be at least 17, but not yet 23 years-of-age by July 1st of year of admission to the academy
Must be a citizen of the United States
Must be unmarried
Cannot be pregnant or have legal obligation to support a child or other dependents
Must meet the medical, physical, and academic requirements of the Academy
The nomination process is highly competitive so applicants hoping to attend one of these academies should consider this opportunity very carefully and start taking steps towards applying now.
Sincerely,
Henry Cuellar
