Payment Reductions to Take Effect at Beginning of New Fiscal
Year - The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is encouraging
producers who have suffered eligible disaster-related losses to act to
secure assistance by Sept. 30, 2014.
The Livestock Indemnity
Program, the Tree Assistance Program and the Noninsured Disaster
Assistance Program Frost Freeze payments will be cut by 7.3 percent on Oct. 1,
2014.
Unlike the Livestock Forage Disaster Program,
applications for these programs must be fully completed by Oct. 1.
FSA
offices will prioritize these applications, but as the full application
process can take several days or more to complete, producers are
encouraged to begin the application process as soon as possible.
To
learn more about USDA disaster relief program, producers can review the
2014 Farm Bill fact sheet at
www.fsa.usda.gov/farmbill , the LFP program fact sheet,
