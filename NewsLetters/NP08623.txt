Dear Friends:
As Americans, we are lucky to live in a
country where we enjoy freedom, safety and prosperity. As Ronald Regan once
said, however, Freedom is never more than one generation away from
extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It
must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or
one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our
children's children what it was once like in the United States where
men were free. Those who dedicate their lives to serving this country
and preserving American liberty deserve the utmost level of respect
from U.S. citizens, members of government, and health
services.
Recently, there have been numerous reports regarding delayed care
and misconduct at veterans facilities across the country. A study done
by the departments inspector general found wide-ranging and
systemic abuses of its waiting lists to mask the problems of long wait times
for care. The investigations preliminary report found that 1,700
veterans at the agencys medical facility in Phoenix were left off the
official waiting list and that wait times were systematically
understated.
I have been outraged and saddened to learn the depth of
dysfunction at the VA. Its entire culture must be rectified, and the
fact that this has become a widespread, national issue reflects a severe
lack of leadership from the Obama administration. We also must hold
all of those who mistreated our veterans accountable, which is why I
joined my Senate colleagues in support of the Veterans' Access to Care
through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of
2014.
This bipartisan bill, passed last Wednesday, will allow veterans to
seek outside healthcare at VA expense if they experience long wait
times for appointments or if they live more than 40 miles from a VA
hospital or clinic. Additionally, it will allow for the opening of 26 new
clinics in 18 states and the hiring of additional VA doctors and
nurses.
It is of supreme importance to ensure that our servicemen
and women are taken care of after they have fulfilled their duty.
Congress, in its oversight role, needs to look closely at the best way to
address the issues at the VA, correct them, and move forward assured
that our veterans get the care they have earned and deserve. Although
this legislation will not fix all of the problems plaguing the VA, I
am confident that it is a step in the right direction. As we move
forward, I will remain committed to fixing this broken
system.
Very Truly Yours,
