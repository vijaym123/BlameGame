Dear Fellow Nevadan,
The Lunar New
Year is an important and festive holiday for people of Asian and Pacific
Islander heritage around the world. Lunar New Year celebrations not
only sustain important cultural traditions that have been practiced for
centuries, but also provide a moment to reflect upon the many
contributions made by the Asian and Pacific Islander community in Nevada and
across the globe.
Our great state of Nevada has one of the
fastest growing Asian American communities in the United States. From
2000 to 2010, the Asian American population in Nevada more than doubled.
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have greatly enriched Nevadas
history and culture, and I am pleased that they continue to do so as
they prepare for the upcoming festivities.

wishes for peace and prosperity in the coming year.
