Rep. Barton votes
against Cromnibus, cant support Presidents unconstitutional
action
WASHINGTON:
Rep. Joe
Barton (R-TX) issued the following statement after voting against the
so called Cromnibus, which is a trillion dollar spending bill that
funds most of the government through September - including the
President's unconstitutional executive action on immigration:
The
Presidents executive action on immigration is unconstitutional. I cant
in good conscious support something that goes against the
Constitution
not for 3 months, a week or even a day.
