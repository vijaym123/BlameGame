Briefings in Laredo
Last Monday I traveled to Laredo with Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz to make a firsthand assessment of the dangerous conditions our border patrol agents face every day. A few days prior to our visit, a U.S. Border Patrol helicopter was fired on while attempting to intercept a large group of people, most likely carrying drugs, from crossing the border. The helicopter pilot was forced to make an emergency landing after the copter was hit twice. Thanks to a bullet proof vest placed under his seat the pilot was unharmed and all the other agents are safe. Our agents risk their lives to keep drugs and dangerous criminals from entering our country. However, U.S. policies make it next to impossible for them to make any headway in securing the border. Later that evening at a dinner with a group of agents they expressed their frustration at apprehending the same people over and over again. They shared their belief that the Presidents executive amnesty and prosecutorial discretion policy sends mixed messages and encourages people to break the law as they are often simply released back to their home country or allowed to stay in the U.S.
Customs and Border Patrol should also have access to the tools and technology they need to accomplish their mission like unmanned aerial vehicles, and Aerostat balloons. America has the technology and we should be putting it to use.
Imagine the efficiency of having an Aerostat balloon a couple hundred feet in the air, able to survey the border and direct agents to interdiction sites. We can't have
real immigration reform until we first secure the border.
House Votes on TPA
On Friday the House, despite my "no" vote, passed Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) which would give the President greater authority to negotiate trade deals with other countries. While Im a strong proponent of free trade, with six years of broken promises and false assurances, our border still unsecured, our healthcare system broken, and a President who wont enforce our laws, I just couldnt support this measure. Throughout the week the phones have been ringing off the hook in both the district and Washington D.C offices with opinions running 30 to 1 against the TPA. Its clear to me that the folks in the 27th Congressional District dont trust this President any more than I do.
For TPA to move forward and take effect, a related bill, TAA, must also pass. TAA failed to pass Friday, but is scheduled to be re-considered next week. I voted no on TAA last week and plan to again next week.
Senate Democrats Threaten Government Shutdown
The House of Representatives has the power of the purse. This means that all spending in our federal government needs to in the House. The appropriations process is one of the strongest ways that Congress can execute clear conservative policies that control spending. Through this power the House determines where our hard earned taxes are spent.
For the past several weeks the House was working through the appropriations process focusing on funding America's national defense while Senate Democrats like Harry Reid and Barbara Mikulski threatened a government shut down by not voting on the House passed bills. While referencing a bill to fund our national defense, Senator Reid said "...I think it really is kind of a waste of time...". Is he serious? Funding our military, paying our troops, and other vital defense programs are a waste of time? That's crazy talk.
Celebrating Flag Day
On June 14,
1777, the Continental Congress made history by adopting the Stars and Stripes as the flag of the United States. From that moment, a timeless and inspiring symbol of freedom, opportunity, and courage was born. On the 238th birthday of the American flag lets remember and honor the heroic men and women who have given so much in defense of our nation. It can sometimes be easy to think the flag is just a piece of cloth, but we should remind ourselves that our flag is actually powerful symbol of everything the United States stands for. It has been carried to far flung places by pioneers, sea captains, and astronauts, it has been hoisted above battlefields to declare victory over tyranny, and it flies in thousands of family yards to display the pride that we Americans have for our country, a pride that is the envy of the world. Happy Flag Day!
Army Birthday
Happy birthday to the most powerful fighting force in the history of the world.
For 240 years the United States Army has been defending our country and securing out freedom against all enemies foreign and domestic. Heres to another 240 years of Army Strong!
Wharton Students Visit Washington
Students from Wharton visited Washington as part of a course with the Institute for Civility in Politics. My staff took them on a tour of the U.S. Capitol and I spoke to them about what I do as your Congressman. The students were particularly interested in how we can bring thoughtful and principled debate back to Congress.
Just in case yall were wondering, I was a No vote on TPA. Heres why...
