Dear
Friends,
After years of hard work, a balanced plan to protect irrigation,
recreation and wildlife has been established for Lake Lowell near
Nampa. The key to the success
announced at a news conference Wednesday
at Deer Flat National Wildlife Refuge headquarters
was local
input.
Eight years ago, there was talk of banning boats on the
9,000-acre lake. Later, refuge managers proposed keeping craft with
wake-enhancing devices off the water, an idea that would leave thousands
of Idaho boaters high and dry.
My involvement began as a
candidate for Congress in 2010, when I attended a rally raising
concerns about restricting recreational use. After my election later that
year, I continued to strongly advocate for local control as critical to
reaching a solution.
Thanks to grassroots input, sustained
leadership from the Idaho congressional delegation and an open-minded
U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, a compromise has been struck for a
15-year Comprehensive Conservation Plan.
Our final
management plan reflects what we heard from you, the public, said refuge
Manager Annette de Knijf on Wednesday.
Citizens fought to
keep alive a multiple-use success that began in 1906, when the U.S.
Bureau of Reclamation began work on Lake Lowell; the lake now helps
irrigate 200,000 acres. Canyon County residents organized a Save the
Lake campaign, knocked on doors, even hosted a parade. Consequently,
respect for Lake Lowells historic, cultural and economic values helped
create a plan making everyone happy.
As Sen. Mike Crapo
said Wednesday, getting to yes, was our aim. I am pleased to have
played a part in showing government can work when officials hear the people
they serve. The collaboration included Sen. Jim Risch, Canyon County
state legislators and county commissioners.
But the efforts
of the local citizens deserve the highest praise. They have worked
tirelessly for eight years to retain local access and multiple use of
Lake Lowell.
Deer Flat National Wildlife Refuge provides
breeding and migratory habitat for birds and mammals. It is an important
stop on the Pacific Flyway.
Its also a great place to
take the family to hunt, fish, swim and view wildlife. Less than an
hours drive from Idahos three largest cities, its a welcome refuge from
city distractions. The lake opens for boating April
15.
Admission is free. An excellent Visitor Center is open weekdays, 8 a.m.
to 4 p.m., Saturdays, 10 to 4. For more information visit the
Deer Flat Website .
Thank you ,
