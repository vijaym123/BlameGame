News from Representative John Delaney
April 20, 2014
Dear Friend,
I write today after a week on the road, meeting with constituents,
community organizations and local businesses from across the district.
Over the course of the week, I spent time with small business owners in
Frederick, students and teachers in Frostburg, veterans in Cumberland
and Fort Detrick and many others. I was happy to hear from families and
individuals on the issues important to them and to get feedback on my
work in Congress.
On Monday, I had the opportunity to host a reception honoring high
school students who participated in this year's Congressional Art
Competition
at the Delaplaine Arts Center in
Frederick. With over 60 student art pieces on display, I was proud to
recognize the talent and creativity of students from our district, as
well as the educators and parents who bring out the best in them.
During my time in Frederick, I hosted a Business Roundtable with
leaders from our district. Having spent two decades as an entrepreneur
and CEO, I understand how federal and state policies can impact local
businesses. I was was interested to hear from Maryland business owners
about the business climate in our state and what they need to
strengthen our economy.
On Wednesday, I sat down with the I-81 Corridor Coalition in Hagerstown
to talk about the kind of infrastructure development we need to keep
our district's economy growing. One of the most critical investments we
can make for local businesses is in our national infrastructure, from
our roads and bridges to communications networks and waterways. This
year, I authored a letter to the Washington County Legislative
Delegation expressing my support for federal funding for improvements
to Interstate 81 in Maryland. I've promised to act as a champion for
the further development of Washington County's I-81 corridor as well as
increased investment in our infrastructure nationwide.
This week, I also had the opportunity to spend time with our nation's
service members and veterans. On Wednesday, I joined some of our men
and women in uniform for an Earth Day celebration at Fort Detrick, and
on Thursday I had the chance to meet with the Vietnam Veterans of
America in Cumberland. As a Freshman Class President, I've acted as a
voice for our service members and veterans by introducing legislation
to improve the administration of veterans' educational benefits and to
support military families when a service member is receiving care after
being wounded.
I was especially honored to deliver posthumous service medals to the
family of Private Otis Poole
in Hagerstown this week. Poole
served as an anti-aircraft gunner and sharp shooter in World War II,
earning a Purple Heart, a Good Conduct Medal and more for his
exceptional service. Our veterans have made enormous sacrifices, and,
as a Member of Congress, I've worked to ensure that their service is
never forgotten.
One of the last stops on my trip was at Frostburg State University
(FSU), where I talked with students and professors and got the chance
to speak with a Public Affairs class about the importance of public
service. The students at FSU represent the next generation of the
American workforce, and I was happy to hear their thoughts and input
during my visit.
While I was only able to include a few of my stops in this newsletter,
I'll be sure to keep you up-to-date with my work as I continue to
gather feedback from constituents across the district. Hearing from you
is one of my top priorities, and I encourage you to share your comments.
Sincerely,
John

John
Delaney
April

Dear
Friend,
I
write
today
after
a
week
on
the
road,
meeting
with
constituents,
community
organizations
and
local
businesses
from
across
the
district.
Over
the
course
of
the
week,
I
spent
time
with
small
business
owners
in
Frederick,
students
and
teachers
in
Frostburg,
veterans
in
Cumberland
and
Fort
Detrick
and
many
others.
I
was
happy
to
hear
from
families
and
individuals
on
the
issues
important
to
them
and
to
get
feedback
on
my
work
in
Congress.
On
Monday,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
host
a
reception
honoring
high
school
students
who
participated
in
this
year&#8217;s
Congressional
Art
Competition
at
the
Delaplaine
Arts
Center
in
Frederick.
With
over
60
student
art
pieces
on
display,
I
was
proud
to
recognize
the
talent
and
creativity
of
students
from
our
district,
as
well
as
the
educators
and
parents
who
bring
out
the
best
in
them.
During
my
time
in
Frederick,
I
hosted
a
Business
Roundtable
with
leaders
from
our
district.
Having
spent
two
decades
as
an
entrepreneur
and
CEO,
I
understand
how
federal
and
state
policies
can
impact
local
businesses.
I
was
was
interested
to
hear
from
Maryland
business
owners
about
the
business
climate
in
our
state
and
what
they
need
to
strengthen
our
economy.
On
Wednesday,
I
sat
down
with
the
I-81
Corridor
Coalition
in
Hagerstown
to
talk
about
the
kind
of
infrastructure
development
we
need
to
keep
our
district's
economy
growing.
One
of
the
most
critical
investments
we
can
make
for
local
businesses
is
in
our
national
infrastructure,
from
our
roads
and
bridges
to
communications
networks
and
waterways. This
year,
I
authored
a
letter
to
the
Washington
County
Legislative
Delegation
expressing
my
support
for
federal
funding
for
improvements
to
Interstate
81
in
Maryland.
I&#8217;ve
promised
to
act
as
a
champion
for
the
further
development
of
Washington
County&#8217;s
I-81
corridor
as
well
as
increased
investment
in
our
infrastructure
nationwide.
This
week,
I
also
had
the
opportunity
to
spend
time
with
our
nation&#8217;s
service
members
and
veterans.
On
Wednesday,
I
joined
some
of
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
for
an
Earth
Day
celebration
at
Fort
Detrick,
and
on
Thursday
I
had
the
chance
to
meet
with
the
Vietnam
Veterans
of
America
in
Cumberland.
As
a
Freshman
Class
President,
I&#8217;ve
acted
as
a
voice
for
our
service
members
and
veterans
by
introducing
legislation
to
improve
the
administration
of
veterans&#8217;
educational
benefits
and
to
support
military
families
when
a
service
member
is
receiving
care
after
being
wounded.
I
was
especially
honored
to
deliver
posthumous
service
medals
to
the
family
of
Private
Otis
Poole
in
Hagerstown
this
week.
Poole
served
as
an
anti-aircraft
gunner
and
sharp
shooter
in
World
War
II,
earning
a
Purple
Heart, a
Good
Conduct
Medal
and
more
for
his
exceptional
service.
Our
veterans
have
made
enormous
sacrifices,
and,
as
a
Member
of
Congress,
I&#8217;ve
worked
to
ensure
that
their
service
is
never
forgotten.
One
of
the
last
stops
on
my
trip
was
at
Frostburg
State
University
(FSU),
where
I
talked
with
students
and
professors
and
got
the
chance
to
speak
with
a
Public
Affairs
class
about
the
importance
of
public
service.
The
students
at
FSU
represent
the
next
generation
of
the
American
workforce,
and
I
was
happy
to
hear
their
thoughts
and
input
during
my
visit.
While
I
was
only
able
to
include
a
few
of
my
stops
in
this

I&#8217;ll
be
sure
to
keep
you
up-to-date

my

as
I

feedback
from
constituents
across
the
district.

my
top
priorities,
and
I
