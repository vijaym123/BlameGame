Congressman
Bill Foster
Representing the 11th District
February 02, 2014
Dear
Friend,
I was very pleased
to see President Obama lay out an agenda to support working families
during the State of the Union Address.
Everyone deserves a shot at
the American dream
to get a good education, a job that supports a
family, and a place to call home.
Unfortunately, for too many,
that dream is becoming harder to achieve.
I was also pleased to hear the Presidents call to
action. Too many critical issues have fallen by the wayside because
Congress has failed to act
unemployment insurance, raising the minimum
wage, commonsense gun control laws and comprehensive immigration
reform.
Its time for Congress to get to
work.
Congressman Bill
Foster and Aurora resident and "DREAMer" Maria Torres
going to the State of the Union
Address
People like my guest Maria Torres,
are taking action to make their voices heard on important issues like
immigration reform, its time for Congress to start listening. I
brought Maria as my guest to the State of the Union because her story is a
powerful example of why we need to pass comprehensive immigration
reform.
Maria learned English, worked her way through college, and
is now giving back to her community. But under our current laws, Maria
has no path to citizenship. I believe immigration reform is one of the
most important issues facing Congress because its the right thing to
do morally and fiscally
passing comprehensive immigration reform
would grow our economy and reduce our
deficit.
What did you think of the President's address?
