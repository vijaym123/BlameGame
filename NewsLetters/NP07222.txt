Urgent Deadline Approaching
Dear Friends,
As your Congressman, I occasionally send out e-mail newsletters to keep you informed on my work in Washington and throughout South Texas. These newsletters cover a variety of topics ranging from district and community events to legislative updates.
I am writing to alert you that, due to U.S. House rules concerning communication before elections, there will be an upcoming blackout period in which I will be limited in the ways I can communicate with you.
In order to stay up to date on important information, including my work on your behalf, I encourage you to sign up and opt-in to receive my e-mails by Tuesday, August 5th, 2014. By opting-in, you will be able to continue receiving my e-mail newsletter even during the blackout periods. Please know that if you opt-in to receive emails, you can opt-out at any time.

I look forward to keeping you informed of my efforts in the House to serve our communities.
Sincerely,
CONNECT WITH US
