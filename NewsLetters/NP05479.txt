We didn&rsquo;t make it.
Despite all the emails from President Obama and Nancy Pelosi, we just couldn&rsquo;t catch up with the Republicans last night.
Don&rsquo;t get us wrong -- we did what we set out to do and hit our initial goal. But the Koch Brothers&rsquo; last-minute $1.8 million attack was just too much to overcome before the clock struck midnight. So now, it&rsquo;s time to make some tough choices.
We still have campaigns out there who need our help. And we need to do everything we can to provide them enough support to fight Republican smears.
So -- TODAY ONLY -- we are making an emergency extension of the triple-match.
**EMERGENCY EXTENSION**
TRIPLE-MATCH STATUS: ACTIVE UNTIL 11:59pm (today only)
We still need 11 donors from 60659 zip code
to make a TRIPLE-MATCHED gift by midnight to give our Democratic campaigns a fighting chance.
We're pleading. Can you step up right now?
