Dear Friend,
Like you, I am horrified by the revolting public executions of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff by Islamic extremists. My thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of these young Americans as they try to cope with unimaginable grief. These murders, as well as the appalling violence toward children and the elderly, are an unmistakable sign that the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, also known as ISIS, has grown stronger in the absence of American leadership. ISIS extremists will show no mercy in their quest to advance fear and terror throughout the Middle East and around the world.
President Obama has aptly referred to the ISIS jihadists as a &#147;cancer&#148; and has challenged neighboring countries in the Middle East to address the threat it poses to free nations. Last week, President Obama was asked about America&#146;s strategy for fighting ISIS extremists and he replied &#147;We do not have a strategy yet.&#148; America deserves a clear and concise strategy to combat ISIS terrorists. The eyes of the world are watching, and waiting on America&#146;s plan to defeat terror in any and all forms.
Terrorist groups like ISIS thrive when America appears aloof from global affairs. The Obama Administration has known for quite some time that ISIS has been growing stronger and poses a serious threat to Americans. Now is the time for American leadership. Now is the time for a clear strategy from the Obama Administration to combat ISIS rebels. This failure of leadership must be corrected.
A successful American strategy should include one goal &#150; victory. To achieve this goal, neighboring countries in the Middle East must coalesce and commit to stopping ISIS from advancing terror. American leadership is not always synonymous with U.S. military force. There are many nations in the Middle East that could make military commitments to fighting ISIS in their own backyard. With American leadership and a coalition of nations in the region, ISIS can be destroyed and the threat to freedom-loving people throughout the world can be eliminated.
The death of American citizens at the hands of Islamic terrorists must not be tolerated. The evil acts of ISIS will only grow in the absence of American leadership. While the Constitution clearly gives the power of forming military strategy to the Commander-in-Chief, Congress is ready and willing to work with President Obama to execute a plan to prevent acts of terror and protect our homeland. I encourage President Obama to develop a strategy that will eradicate ISIS and provide a safeguard for Americans at home and abroad.
Sincerely,
Jason Smith
Member of Congress
