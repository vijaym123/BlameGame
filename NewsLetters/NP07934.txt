CHICAGO SUN-TIMES: "Schneider and Dold are deadlocked"
David -- we just got the news: A new poll shows Brad in a DEAD HEAT with Republican Bob Dold.
Make no mistake, with the race this tight, outside groups will pour in cash from all over the country to try and tip the scales against us.
David, we can&rsquo;t let shadowy special interests buy this election. We need to go on offense and get the facts out to Illinois voters --
before
right-wing attacks take hold.
Election day is just around the corner. If you were thinking about making a donation or increasing your support, it&rsquo;s critical you do so immediately. Brad's depending on us.
