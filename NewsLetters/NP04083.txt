Dear Friend,
Thursday afternoon, we
passed H.R. 5759, the
Executive Amnesty Prevention
Act .
This bill would stop President Obama's executive action
granting legal status to millions of people who broke our immigration
laws.
Immigration is an important
issue, and this is the time for debate. This is the time for solving
problems. President Obama defied the public and the process through
his executive actions, and with this bill, the Peoples House acted on
the Peoples will. Theres nothing symbolic or politically motivated
about that, and the Congress the American people elected will work on a
solution to our immigration problem despite President Obamas efforts
to poison the well.
I spoke about
this bill on the House floor before the vote. Video of that speech is
below.
We heard from a lot of you about
this issue this week. Please remember, you can a lways
contact
me
with your thoughts.
Sincerely,
Doug Collins
Member of Congress
