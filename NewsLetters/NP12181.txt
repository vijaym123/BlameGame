Dear Friends,
I held a roundtable Wednesday morning with Kanawha
Valley small businesses on the impact of the chemical spill. Many told me
they are concerned about the long-term impact of the spill on tourism
and the states reputation. I will continue to push for answers on
the safety of our water and am scheduled to meet with the CDC next
week.
And on Thursday, I spoke
with
FEMA Region III Regional Administrator MaryAnn Tierney,
urging her to reverse the agencys denial of emergency protective measures
following the chemical spill. During the call, I shared stories Ive
heard from residents and from small businesses at Wednesdays
roundtable in Charleston. Families and business are still struggling to recover
from the spill and water contamination, a nd I made her aware of the long-term health questions and economic
damages that West Virginians are facing. This is not a traditional
disaster like a flood or fire, but it has long-ranging, devastating
consequences for the Kanawha Valley.
While I welcome the assistance FEMA has provided,
including a federal disaster coordinator to help consolidate federal
efforts across agencies, West Virginia needs more. I will continue to
push FEMA to overturn its decision and work to provide much-needed
assistance.
HONORING OUR
VETERANS
On Wednesday, I presented World War II veteran and Pearl
Harbor survivor Chester McNeely of Marmet with a flag flown over the

service to our nation.
