Dear Friends,
Tax season is here, and I want to be sure every hard-working Angeleno gets the valuable tax credits he or she has earned.
Do you or someone you know need help filing a tax return?
The IRS-sponsored
Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program
offers free tax assistance to people who make up to $53,000 and meet other eligibility criteria.
At VITA sites, IRS-certified volunteers provide free basic income tax preparation and can help determine if you are eligible to receive tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or Child Tax Credit.
The IRS also offers Tax Counseling for the Elderly, which offers free tax help to individuals who are 60 years of age and older and can answer questions about pensions and other retirement-related issues.
Visit the
IRS website
to find a local VITA site near you.
For more information about the VITA program or for help with any IRS matter, please call my district office at (213) 481-1425.
Sincerely,
XAVIER BECERRA
