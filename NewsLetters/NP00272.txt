 perhaps next year. In the meantime, I am educating Members of Congress about what is at stake. On Wednesday, I offered an amendment to the 2016 Defense appropriation bill requiring that any land acquisition follow the requirements of Article XIII of the Covenant and Title 10 of the U.S. Code. I had strong support from Democratic colleagues on the 173-256 vote
and from 7 Republicans. Covenant provisions and Title 10 still apply, of course, even without the amendment. But this was an opportunity for me to explain the importance of land to the people of the Northern Marianas. Of our fourteen islands four are nature reserves, where the CNMI Constitution
prevents habitation. Several, including Pagan, are actively volcanic. And two-thirds of Tinian and all of Farallon de Medinilla we have already leased to the U.S. That leaves little of our 184 square miles left to us-a point I will continue to emphasize.
DEFENSE APPROPRIATION RAISES MILITARY PAY, CLEAN UP FUNDS
Service men and women would get a 2.3 percent pay raise under the FY16 Department of Defense Appropriations Act the House passed on Thursday. That is 1 percent more than the President recommended in his budget. The House also added $25 million for Formerly Used Defense Sites above the President's recommendation. During debate, I argued for another $21 million to keep us at the same spending level as this year, $250 million. We have 5,000 sites nationwide-24 in the Northern Mariana Islands-that the Army Corps of Engineers says will cost $14 billion to clean up. At current spending levels that will take over 60 years. And if the military does not clean up its old areas of contamination any faster than that, it leaves us all very sceptical about the military's promises to clean up future activities proposed on Tinian and Pagan. You can read my statement here.

Hawai'i Senator Mazie K. Hirono and I discussed regional security issues, including how the pivot of U.S. forces to the Pacific affects the Northern Mariana Islands, at her offices this week. Senator Hirono and I served together in the House of Representatives before her election to the Senate. She is now a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
BILL SUPPORTS OCEAN RESEARCH IN THE NMI
Together with Congressmen Don Young (R-Alaska) and Frank Guinta (R-New Hampshire), I introduced legislation this week to continue the Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation System.
The Commonwealth Government is a member of PacIOOS,
one of 11 regional councils that partner with 17 federal agencies in the System. PacIOOS has installed monitoring buoys off Saipan to measure and forecast wave action, weather patterns, and water quality and temperatures. Understanding flood hazards, ensuring safe navigation and search and rescue capabilities, and gathering data on fisheries and water quality are important areas of research for the Northern Marianas and all of America's coastal areas. The bill we introduced, H.R. 2744,
will provide $36 million annually through 2019.

H.E. Ramn Gil-Casares, Ambassador of Spain, took time to visit and renew the connection between his country and the Mariana Islands this week. Our history with Spain go back almost 500 sometimes painful years. Today, as members of the European Union and the United States of America, respectively, we enjoy the best of friendships and share family heritage and much common language, culture, and cuisine. Buenas dias yan Si Yu'us Ma'ase por su visita.
