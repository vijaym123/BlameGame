OBAMACARE & YOUR STORY
The top Senate Democrat who authored Obamacare has called
implementation "a train wreck" - that is being generous! The Obama
Administration announced that less than 107,000 Americans have
successfully enrolled in its first month. Adding the countless
"glitches" and security flaws found in the construction of
www.Healthcare.gov
, including this week's Congressional testimony
that 30 to 40 percent of the website still needs
to be built - it is clear that Obamacare should be delayed or scrapped
altogether.
As the effects of Obamacare continue to come to light, I want to hear
YOUR STORY. There are two easy ways: join the conversation on my
Facebook
or fill out the online form
.
LATEST NEWS
United Airlines has announced it will begin daily service
between
the Atlantic City International Airport and its hubs in Chicago and
Houston starting in April. As Chairman of the House Aviation
Subcommittee, I've made a focus of making ACY an attractive option
for additional commercial air service. This is a
win-win for South Jersey!
SOUTH JERSEY "HOT PIC"
It was a beautiful day
when communities gathered to honor and remember our veterans. I joined
celebrations in Upper Deerfield, Cape May Court House and Mays Landing
(pictured) to thank South Jersey veterans for their service. See my
