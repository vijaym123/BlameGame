Nate Silver just projected that Georgia is the new &ldquo;tipping-point state that would determine majority control.&rdquo;

PITCH IN TO HELP DEMS WIN &gt;&gt;
Friend -- Nate Silver just projected that
Georgia is the new &ldquo;tipping-point state that would determine majority control.&rdquo;
Republican David Perdue has absolutely IMPLODED after news broke about his outsourcing past and Swiss bank accounts.
It&rsquo;s the closest race in the country, and Democrat Michelle Nunn just SURGED 5 points in the polls -- she&rsquo;s now led in
FOUR
STRAIGHT POLLS!
President Obama didn&rsquo;t sugarcoat it: &ldquo;Michelle Nunn will win the Senate if there&rsquo;s a high turnout among Democrats. If there&rsquo;s low or ordinary turnout, she won&rsquo;t win.&quot;
