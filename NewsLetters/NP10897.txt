Natural Resources Hearing on ESA Reform
Last week, I told you about legislation I've introduced
to reform the Endangered Species Act
(ESA) to make it work better for landowners, communities, and species.
The law is in need of reform-in the 40 years since it was enacted, only
2% of species have ever recovered to the point where they can be
removed from the list.
The ESA also imposes costly federal
requirements on landowners, when there are more practical, voluntary
conservation solutions that would work just as well to preserve
species.
It's also problematic that instead of making listing
decisions in a transparent manner, based on the best available science,
listings are being driven by closed-door settlements with activist
environmental groups.
So I've introduced two bills
to improve the ESA and
prevent unnecessary listing.
This week, the Natural Resources
Committee will be holding a hearing
on one
of those bills: H.R. 4317, the State, Tribal, and Local Species
Transparency and Recovery Act.
This bill requires the Fish and
Wildlife Service (FWS) to provide states with the data they are using
to justify their listing decisions.
Additionally, it requires FWS to
consider scientific data submitted by state and local governments
before making a determination.
Te
xas State Senator Kel Seilger
has been invited to testify
at the hearing on why involving states early in the process is critical
to successful conservation.
He'll also explain why data from state and
local fish and wildlife experts is critical to understanding local
species and their habitat.
I'm looking forward to Senator Seliger's
testimony.

Farm Bill Implementation
Last week, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack came before the House
Agriculture Committee
to answer questions
about farm bill implementation and the state of the rural economy.
We
discussed how USDA will define "actively engaged" farmers under the new
Farm Bill provisions.
I also asked him why he continues to say that
mandatory Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) benefits producers when
we've seen quite a lot of evidence that it doesn't.
Cargill was forced
to close their processing plant in Plainview partly because of USDA's
COOL regulations.
More than 2,000 people lost their jobs.
So I wanted
to know why Secretary Vilsack considers mandatory COOL to be a positive
policy when COOL is killing jobs and making it more difficult for West
Texas cattle producers to process their livestock locally.

Action Item: Honoring Chancellor Kent Hance
On Wednesday, I'm proud to be hosting special order on the House floor
to honor my friend and mentor, retiring Texas Tech Chancellor and
former Member of Congress Kent Hance
.
I'll be joined by other Members of the Texas
delegation to pay tribute to Hance's achievements.
The special order
will take place at in the afternoon on Wednesday, April 9, and you can
watch it live on the House of Representative's website
or CSPAN

Natural

I&#8217;ve
introduced

the

The

is

the
40

since
it
was
enacted,
only
2%
of
species

the

where
they

The
ESA

there

voluntary

solutions

also
problematic
that

based

So
I&#8217;ve
introduced
two
bills
to
improve
the
ESA

prevent
unnecessary
listing.
This

the
Natural

H.R.

This

requires
the
Fish

they
are
using

Additionally,
it
requires
FWS
to
consider

Secretary

answer
questions
about

and
the

We
discussed
how
USDA
will
define
&#8220;actively

under
the
new
Farm

I
also
asked
him
why
he
continues

that
mandatory
Country

Origin
Labeling
(COOL)
benefits
producers
when
we&#8217;ve
seen
quite
a

it
doesn&#8217;t.
Cargill
was
forced

More

So
I
wanted

COOL
