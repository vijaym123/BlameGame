Perfect voting record: 2,500 consecutive votes
On May 29, 2014, I cast my 2,500th consecutive vote in Congress
, extending
the longest active voting streak of any sitting representative. I also
have explained every one of those 2,500 votes on my Facebook Page.
My perfect vote record actually started when I was a representative in
the Michigan state House, where I cast more than 1,300 votes in a row.
It was as a state representative that I began posting vote explanations
online. Those vote explanations spurred members of the Michigan state
House to increase transparency, and I hope the same will happen in
Congress.
My 2,500th vote in the U.S. House of Representatives was on an
amendment to H.R. 4660, the appropriations bill for the Department of
Commerce, the Department of Justice, science programs, and related
agencies. Here is the explanation
:
For my 2,500th vote in Congress (and 2,500th public vote
explanation), I voted no on the Cicilline of RI Amendment to H.R. 4660,
which transfers $8.5 million from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) to the Department of Justice's Project Safe
Neighborhoods program. The Project Safe Neighborhoods program sends
federal funds to local governments to help reduce gun violence.
Funding NASA is more appropriately a federal function than
funding state and local law enforcement. Instead of directly funding
local law enforcement functions, the federal government can improve the
budget flexibility of local governments by eliminating the unfunded
federal mandates that affect them.
The amendment was not agreed to 196-212.
Continuing the fight against unconstitutional surveillance
On May 22, I voted no on H.R. 3361, the USA FREEDOM Act
.
I am an original cosponsor of the Freedom Act, and I was involved in
its drafting. At its best, the Freedom Act would have reined in the
government's unconstitutional domestic spying programs, ended the
indiscriminate collection of Americans' private records, and made the
secret FISA court function more like a real court-with real arguments
and real adversaries.
I was and am proud of the work our group, led by Rep. Jim
Sensenbrenner, did to promote this legislation, as originally drafted.
However, the revised bill that came to the floor and passed the House
of Representatives doesn't look much like the Freedom Act.
The revised H.R. 3361 maintains and codifies a large-scale,
unconstitutional domestic spying program. It claims to end "bulk
collection" of Americans' data only in a very technical sense: The bill
prohibits the government from, for example, ordering a telephone
company to turn over all its call records every day.
But the bill was so weakened in behind-the-scenes negotiations over the
last week that the government still can order-without probable cause-a
telephone company to turn over all call records for "area code 616" or
for "phone calls made east of the Mississippi." The bill green-lights
the government's massive data collection activities that sweep up
Americans' records in violation of the Fourth Amendment.
The bill does include a few modest improvements to current law. The
secret FISA court that approves government surveillance must publish
its most significant opinions so that Americans can have some idea of
what surveillance the government is doing. The bill authorizes (but
does not require) the FISA court to appoint lawyers to argue for
Americans' privacy rights, whereas the court now only hears from one
side before ruling.
But while the original version of the Freedom Act allowed Sec. 215 of
the Patriot Act to expire in June 2015, the revised version extends the
life of that controversial section for more than two years, through
2017.
It's shameful that the president of the United States, the chairman of
the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and the leaders
of the country's surveillance agencies refuse to accept consensus
reforms that will keep our country safe while upholding the
Constitution. And it mocks our system of government that they worked to
gut key provisions of the Freedom Act behind closed doors.
The American people demand that the Constitution be respected, that our
rights and liberties be secured, and that the government stay out of
our private lives. Fortunately, there is a growing group of
representatives on both sides of the aisle who get it. In the 10 months
since I proposed the Amash Amendment to end mass surveillance, we've
made big gains.
We will succeed.
Sincerely,
Justin Amash

Perfect
voting
record:
2,500
consecutive
votes
On
May
29,
2014,
I
cast
my
2,500th
consecutive
vote
in
Congress ,
extending
the
longest
active
voting
streak
of
any
sitting
representative.
I
also
have
explained
every
one
of
those
2,500
votes
on
my
Facebook
Page.
My
perfect
vote
record
actually
started
when
I
was
a
representative
in
the
Michigan
state
House,
where
I
cast
more
than
1,300
votes
in
a
row.
It
was
as
a
state
representative
that
I
began
posting
vote
explanations
online.
Those
vote
explanations
spurred
members
of
the
Michigan
state
House
to
increase
transparency,
and
I
hope
the
same
will
happen
in
Congress.
My
2,500th
vote
in
the
U.S.
House
of
Representatives
was
on
an
amendment
to
H.R.
4660,
the
appropriations
bill
for
the
Department
of
Commerce,
the
Department
of
Justice,
science
programs,
and
related
agencies.
Here
is
the
explanation :
For
my
2,500th
vote
in
Congress
(and
2,500th
public
vote
explanation),
I
voted
no
on
the
Cicilline
of
RI
Amendment
to
H.R.
4660,
which
transfers
$8.5
million
from
the
National
Aeronautics
and
Space
Administration
(NASA)
to
the
Department
of
Justice&#8217;s
Project
Safe
Neighborhoods
program.
The
Project
Safe
Neighborhoods
program
sends
federal
funds
to
local
governments
to
help
reduce
gun
violence.
Funding
NASA
is
more
appropriately
a
federal
function
than
funding
state
and
local
law
enforcement.
Instead
of
directly
funding
local
law
enforcement
functions,
the
federal
government
can
improve
the
budget
flexibility
of
local
governments
by
eliminating
the
unfunded
federal
mandates
that
affect
them.
The
amendment
was
not
agreed
to
196-212.
Continuing
the
fight
against
unconstitutional
surveillance
On
May
22,
I
voted
no
on
H.R.
3361,
the
USA
FREEDOM
Act .
I
am
an
original
cosponsor
of
the
Freedom
Act,
and
I
was
involved
in
its
drafting.
At
its
best,
the
Freedom
Act
would
have
reined
in
the
government&#8217;s
unconstitutional
domestic
spying
programs,
ended
the
indiscriminate
collection
of
Americans&#8217;
private
records,
and
made
the
secret
FISA
court
function
more
like
a
real
court&#8212;with
real
arguments
and
real
adversaries.
I
was
and
am
proud
of
the
work
our
group,
led
by
Rep.
Jim
Sensenbrenner,
did
to
promote
this
legislation,
as
originally
drafted.
However,
the
revised
bill
that
came
to
the
floor
and
passed
the
House
of
Representatives
doesn&#8217;t
look
much
like
the
Freedom
Act.
The
revised
H.R.
3361
maintains
and
codifies
a
large-scale,
unconstitutional
domestic
spying
program.
It
claims
to
end
&#8220;bulk
collection&#8221;
of
Americans&#8217;
data
only
in
a
very
technical
sense:
The
bill
prohibits
the
government
from,
for
example,
ordering
a
telephone
company
to
turn
over
all
its
call
records
every
day.
But
the
bill
was
so
weakened
in
behind-the-scenes
negotiations
over
the
last
week
that
the
government
still
can
order&#8212;without
probable
cause&#8212;a
telephone
company
to
turn
over
all
call
records
for
&#8220;area
code
616&#8221;
or
for
&#8220;phone
calls
made
east
of
the
Mississippi.&#8221;
The
bill
green-lights
the
government&#8217;s
massive
data
collection
activities
that
sweep
up
Americans&#8217;
records
in
violation
of
the
Fourth
Amendment.
The
bill
does
include
a
few
modest
improvements
to
current
law.
The
secret
FISA
court
that
approves
government
surveillance
must
publish
its
most
significant
opinions
so
that
Americans
can
have
some
idea
of
what
surveillance
the
government
is
doing.
The
bill
authorizes
(but
does
not
require)
the
FISA
court
to
appoint
lawyers
to
argue
for
Americans&#8217;
privacy
rights,
whereas
the
court
now
only
hears
from
one
side
before
ruling.
But
while
the
original
version
of
the
Freedom
Act
allowed
Sec.
215
of
the
Patriot
Act
to
expire
in
June
2015,
the
revised
version
extends
the
life
of
that
controversial
section
for
more
than
two
years,
through
2017.
It&#8217;s
shameful
that
the
president
of
the
United
States,
the
chairman
of
the
House
Permanent
Select
Committee
on
Intelligence,
and
the
leaders
of
the
country&#8217;s
surveillance
agencies
refuse
to
accept
consensus
reforms
that
will
keep
our
country
safe
while
upholding
the
Constitution.
And
it
mocks
our
system
of
government
that
they
worked
to
gut
key
provisions
of
the
Freedom
Act
behind
closed
doors.
The
American
people
demand
that
the
Constitution
be
respected,
that
our
rights
and
liberties
be
secured,
and
that
the
government
stay
out
of
our
private
lives.
Fortunately,
there
is
a
growing
group
of
representatives
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
who
get
it.
In
the
10

we&#8217;ve
