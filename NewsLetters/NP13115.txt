Dear Friend &ndash;
Today, President Obama proposed reforms to surveillance practices by the National Security Agency (NSA).
Because of my experience on the House Armed Services and Homeland Security Committees, I know the very real and very dangerous threats our country faces. However, I want you to know that I am unwilling to sacrifice the privacy rights and civil liberties of Americans for the excessive collection of personal data. I have voted against the PATRIOT Act and every subsequent reauthorization of the controversial Section 215.
I am pleased the President wants to end the government&rsquo;s blanket collection of Americans&rsquo; phone data and require intelligence agencies to obtain FISA court permission before retrieving it. However, his proposals today do not go far enough. There must be a limit to what type of data agencies can store and how long they may do so.
I previously proposed numerous reforms, including the need to add a Privacy Officer and an Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties at the Department of Homeland Security to report on the privacy impacts of data sharing. These proposals were included in last year&rsquo;s Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CIPSA), which the passed through the House, but has stalled in the Senate.
I look forward to staying in touch with you as I work with my colleagues to change our approach to data collection in the upcoming reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act&rsquo;s Section 215.
If you&rsquo;d like to share your opinions or ideas on this topic, I&rsquo;d love for you to
email me . As always, I encourage you to contact one of my offices if you have questions or need assistance.
Very truly yours,
Loretta Sanchez
Member of Congress
