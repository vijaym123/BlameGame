This week, as part of the Houses ongoing investigation into the
terrorist attack in Benghazi, the House Intelligence Committee held a
hearing with former Acting CIA Director Mike
Morell . These hearings are critical in determining what
happened in Benghazi, how it could have been prevented, why the
American people received false information about the nature of the attack,
and what we can do to prevent future attacks and keep Americans
safe.
As a member of the Committee, I believe we must hold the
Administration accountable. I focused
my
questions
on two key areas:
First, why did the
Administration decide not to send a military response during the attack
to try to save American lives? We have been told there was not enough
time, but no one has been able to explain to me how they knew how long
the attacks would last. What if they had continued for another 12
hours?
Second, what can we do moving forward to minimize the
risk of another attack? What steps can we take to keep our agents and
embassies safe? Getting a full and forthright account of what
happened in Benghazi is vital to learning what must be done to prevent future
attacks.
Video of my exchange
during the hearing is available
here.
Following the hearing, I
spoke with Fox News about the testimony we
heard
regarding the tallking points distributed by the Administration and
used by Susan Rice and others for several days after the attack. These
talking points wrongly claimed that the attack was the result of a
spontaneous protest of a video, when, in fact, there was nothing to
support that allegation and clear, mounting evidence that it was an
orchestrated terrorist attack.
