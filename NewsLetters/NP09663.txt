Statement on the
Latest Resignation in the Department of Veterans
Affairs
5/16/14
Following the resignation of VA Undersecretary for
Health Care Robert Petzel, Congressman Doug Lamborn, the second-ranking
Republican on the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, released the
following statement.
It is
important that concrete steps are taken to get to the bottom of the
serious problems in our VA system. The resignation of an Undersecretary
for Health Care, when he was already planning to retire this year, is
a poor example of leadership and shows almost no accountability. The
time is now for the VA to begin producing genuine solutions for our
brave veterans.
- Congressman Doug Lamborn (CO-05)
