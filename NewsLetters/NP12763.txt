Hello Everyone!
As we embark upon a new year, it's time to refocus on the issues that
are most important to Granite State families. The best way for me to
represent your priorities and concerns is to hear them directly from
you.
Please click here to let me know what issues you would like me to focus
on in Congress for 2014.
Listening to your views and ideas helps me as I work with members of
both parties to find common sense solutions to the challenges facing
our state and country. Thank you for your participation and for all you
do to make New Hampshire such a fantastic place to live.
Sincerely,
Ann McLane Kuster
Member of Congress
