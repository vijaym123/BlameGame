District
Dear Friend,
From the Selkirks to the Owyhees,
Canada to Nevada
The August
Congressional work period reminds me how fortunate I am to represent one of
the most beautiful and diverse districts in the United States. Driving
along the Salmon River, I feel sorry for colleagues who return home to
a homogenous landscape.
After meeting with hundreds of people
who attended nine town halls from north to south, I came away with a
renewed commitment to resume our important work when I return to
Washington next week.
We began at Priest Lake, near Coolin. Id
never seen the northernmost of the 1 st
Districts three big
glacial lakes and it was well worth the wait.
Constituents who
met with me at the Cavanaugh Bay Resort voiced their frustrations
about matters of great concern to me:
the squeeze the new health
care law puts on the middle class; the regulatory burden hamstringing
our natural resource industries; the false hopes given Central Americans
streaming to our southern border;
and the crippling impact of a
$17 trillion national debt.
Those issues were top-of-mind at
town halls in Bonners Ferry, Moscow, Lewiston, Cottonwood, Emmett,
Cascade, Nampa, and Meridian. My travels also took me to the Post Falls
Rotary Club and Orofino Chamber of Commerce, a meeting with
firefighters who successfully battled the Big Cougar fire in Idaho County, and a
tour of the Hewlett-Packard plant in Boise. I also was interviewed by
journalists in Sandpoint, Bonners Ferry, Coeur dAlene, Moscow and
Lewiston.
Despite what can seem a gloomy forecast, I believe
there is reason for hope as more and more Americans demand
change.
In the next Congress, I will join hundreds of colleagues pressing
to put us on the path to long-term solvency, including a flattening of
tax rates and elimination of loopholes benefitting special
interests.
We will continue to press for a federal balanced budget
amendment to ensure enduring fiscal discipline like that practiced by the
Idaho Legislature.
I am
privileged to serve hard-working people who care deeply about keeping their
republic.
August is the month when I recharge my batteries on
the energy of an informed citizenry. My thanks to all my constituents
agree or disagree with me
who make the effort to engage in the hope
for a stronger Idaho and a stronger America.
Thank
you ,
