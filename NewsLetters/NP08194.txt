Hello Friends and Happy (almost) Independence
Day!!
These past couple of weeks in Washington have caught
some national attention, first with the 50th anniversary of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 and then with the highly anticipated Supreme Court
contraception ruling. In between, it was great having some Wisconsin
visitors!
Wisconsin Comes to
Washington:
It was great
speaking with the 2014 Congressional Art Competition winner Laura and
her mother Carol in my Washington, DC office. I always enjoy meeting
with our students in DC and at my annual art competition reception in
Milwaukee. All of our students have so much talent.

wonderful visit with Milwaukee Children's Choir! To hear their beautiful

I joined the nation to celebrate the 50th anniversary
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, one of the most important
legislative accomplishments in American history. Its enactment into law
profoundly and unalterably changed our nation. For the first time,
discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin was
illegal. I'm so happy that Rev. Willie E. Brisco, President of
Milwaukee Inner-city Congregations Allied for Hope and
Anita Johnson, organizer with
Citizen Action of Wisconsin, were able to join me. For more photos
from this powerful event,

In addition to
celebrating this great moment in American history, I noted that
our struggle towards equality continues . We
cannot allow the Supreme Court of the United States, congressional
gridlock or state legislatures to undo what our civil rights leaders have
built. Congress must come together and
pass a strengthened Voting Rights
Act .
As we recognized the one year anniversary since the
Supreme Court struck down a vital piece of the Voting Rights Act, we
geared up for another battle. This week our highest court decided, in
a 5-4 ruling, that some for-profit companies can deny their employees
birth control coverage. The owners of Hobby Lobby, a for-profit
arts and crafts store, and Conestoga Wood, a for-profit wood furniture
manufacturer, should have no voice when it comes to women's private
health care decisions. Motherhood is not a hobby. Unfortunately the
Supreme Court does not agree.
I voiced
my strong opposition to this ruling
because our personal and
private health care decisions should remain personal and
private.
Other
News:
I joined forces with Financial Services Ranking Member Waters to
support the American
consumer .
I celebrated Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender
Pride Month , and I urged everyone in my district and across our
nation to fully recognize and appreciate that our differences,
including whom we love, do not weaken our nation; they strengthen
it.
I also renewed my
drive for Congress to
reauthorize
the charter of the Export-Import Bank
(Ex-Im Bank), the official
export credit agency of the United States. In Wisconsin, the Ex-Im Bank
supported the export of $102 million of goods and services from 2012 to
2013. Nationwide, the Ex-Im Bank helped sustain more than 200,000
jobs by supporting approximately $37 billion in exports last year
alone.
On
the eve of the one year anniversary of the passage of S. 744, the
Senate comprehensive immigration reform bill,
I joined other women leaders in Congress
to express our
disappointment and frustration that Speaker Boehner and the House
Republican leadership have failed to take action to fix our broken immigration
system.
