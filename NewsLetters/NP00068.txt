TOP NEWS
Thanks to all the constituents of FL-26 who participated in last week's Teletownhall. You had some great questions, and I look forward to continue reaching out and hearing from you to better serve South Florida in the 114th Congress.
HOUSE FLOOR
The House adopted a bipartisan amendment that will provide grants to Hispanic-serving institutions of higher education to offer advanced foreign language programs that are important to our intelligence community. This amendment will be included in the FY16 Intelligence Authorization Act, providing these students with both a traditional classroom setting and a first-hand perspective of the culture they are studying. I am proud to advocate for schools in FL-26 like Florida International University and Miami Dade College, and will strive to provide them the opportunity to train their students so they can serve our country.
COMMITTEE HEARINGS
In the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, we are continuing to work on child nutrition reauthorization to ensure that students have access to healthy meals and snacks. Outside of the child nutrition programs, I encourage parents to teach their children about the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
NOTABLE VISITS
Last week, I met with members of the USA Refugees and Immigrants who presented me with an award for my work defending human rights and democratic values worldwide. We discussed challenges facing Latin America, especially the current situation in Venezuela. I am very humbled to receive this award and thank the group for their efforts in raising awareness to ensure Venezuela has a brighter future.
