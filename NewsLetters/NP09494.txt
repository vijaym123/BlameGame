Rokita Readings
A clickable offering of books and articles that I've read recently and
highly recommend, as we strive together to "Keep the Republic."
For the Rokita Reading in this issue is a column I read earlier this
year that was sent to me by a friend and Rokita Report reader.
As the
House passed the DOTCOM Act this week, which I introduced with Reps.
John Shimkus and Marsha Blackburn, I was reminded of the good points
made in this column, "America's Internet Surrender
," by L. Gordon Crovitz.
Crovitz column, and the DOTCOM Act itself, were in response to the
Obama administration's proposal to cede control of certain internet
domain functions to a "multistakeholder community."
Additional
background on the issue is in the column and below, as the House passed
the DOTCOM Act this week.
Crovitz argues, and I agree, that we should not relinquish our
authority over these functions.
He makes the comparison that this is
on par with American naval forces no longer patrolling the seas.
Crovitz rightly has concerns that countries who do not value freedom
the same way we do, like China and Russia, would seek an increased role
and an attempt to limit internet freedom.
That, and also protecting the greatest economic engine to of the last
50 years, are the reasons why I introduced the DOTCOM Act.
_____
Protecting America's Internet Interests - DOTCOM Clears Committee
On Thursday, the House considered, and passed as an amendment to the
annual defense spending legislation, a bill I introduced, H.R. 4342,
the Domain Openness Through Continued Oversight Matters (DOTCOM) Act
.
The DOTCOM Act would prohibit the Department of Commerce's National
Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA) from turning over
its domain name system oversight responsibilities pending a Government
Accountability Office (GAO) report to Congress.
The internet is the single greatest economic machine created in the
last 50 years and it is a shining example of our American
Exceptionalism. It is against our own national economic interest to
relinquish control, especially without a clear path forward that will
protect internet freedom.

Holding Dept. of Veterans Affairs Accountable
This week, the House considered and passed the Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA) Management Accountability Act
, H.R. 4031, to address
the recent troubling report of avoidable patient deaths, falsified
records, secret waiting lists, and cancelled appointments in our VA
facilities.
Veterans ought to expect timely and effective care.
The troubling
reports of backlogs and poor service at VA medical facilities are
unacceptable.
Those who are directly or indirectly responsible must be
held accountable, starting with being fired for their negligence.
I
will continue fighting for our veterans by pursuing this and other
remedies to correct these problems.
Just last week, I joined with other Hoosier lawmakers in sending a
letter to the President
demanding the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki for the service
being shown our veterans.
The President continues to defend his
administration
despite the track record of mismanagement and neglect.
Our veterans
deserve better.

Making the Case - the Future of Conservative Education Reform
Next Thursday, in my role as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Early
Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education
, I will be the keynote speaker at an
event
hosted by the American
Enterprise Institute (AEI) in Washington, DC.
AEI is one of the world's best sources for insightful policy ideas that
empower people to live their lives to the fullest.
I truly appreciate
the work that AEI President Arthur Brooks, Resident Education Scholar
Rick Hess, and the whole AEI team does.
They are on the forefront in
the fight to help people build better lives for themselves and their
families.
I look forward to discussing many of the reforms I've worked on in my
time as Chairman, including the Student Success Act
, and the CHOICE Act
,
which I will be introducing next week.
The event starts at 3:00 pm (details here
).
For those of you unable
to attend in person, the event will be broadcast here
and an archived webcast
will be made available within 24 hours following the event.

Creating Jobs, Cutting Red Tape - House Passes Water Infrastructure
Legislation
On Tuesday, the House considered and passed the Conference Report on
the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA), H.R. 3080
, with overwhelming bipartisan
support.
This is an updated version of legislation we passed last year that has
been negotiated in a House-Senate conference committee.
The bill will
now head back to the Senate for final consideration before going to the
President for his signature.
H.R. 3080 streamlines and strengthens water transportation networks to
help create jobs and support economic growth by authorizing several
water resources projects.
It also modifies an additional eight
previously authorized water resources projects, as project cost
increases require congressional approval.
This bill is also
significant because it is the first water resources authorization that
has passed without earmarks.
That's progress, likely not realized
without House Republicans banning earmarks in 2011.
In addition to the jobs and growth this legislation will create, the
bill has significant impact for the Greater Lafayette area because it
simplifies the process for Congress to authorize waterway
infrastructure studies and projects like the ongoing efforts to address
erosion of the Wabash River in Greater Lafayette.
Now, private
nonfederal projects, like the Wabash River Enhancement Corporation
(WREC), have a more direct avenue to make their case for federal
assistance.
These reforms also allow the use of funds from non-federal
interests, like WREC, to expedite the processing of permits within the
regulatory program of the Corps of Engineers.

impact on Greater Lafayette here

_____
Stopping Human Trafficking
Also on Tuesday, I, along with my House colleagues, took a stand to
protect the victims of human trafficking by supporting a series of
measures aimed at cracking down on this awful crime.
The deplorable act of human trafficking must stop and we must do
everything we can to support victims and prevent these crimes from
occurring.
These bills are a significant step in ending the scourge of
human trafficking.
H.R. 3530 - Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act
, a bill I cosponsored, increases and streamlines law enforcement
resources, enhances victims' services, and strengthens our laws to
ensure that both buyers and sellers engaged in sex trafficking are held
accountable. It authorizes the appropriation of $25 million annually
over the 2015-2019 period for DOJ to provide grants to states and other
recipients aimed at improving the enforcement of laws against human
trafficking and to assist victims of such crimes.
H.R. 3610 - Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act
makes
several changes to laws related to human trafficking. It allows the
Attorney General to apply preferential treatment when making some
public safety grants to states that have adopted certain laws related
to trafficking victims, but does not change the funding level for the
grants. It requires the Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat
Trafficking to expand its reporting on certain trafficking-related
crimes. It requires HHS to provide funding for a national hotline for
trafficking victims. It also makes trafficking victims eligible to
participate in the Jobs Corps if they meet the age and income
requirements.
H.R. 4225 - Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation (SAVE) Act
would clarify the current laws against sex trafficking with
regard to the advertising of such acts. The goal is that the government
might be able to increase the number of successful prosecutions.
H.R. 4058 - Preventing Sex Trafficking and Improving Opportunities for
Youth in Foster Care Act
makes several changes to
the Title IV-E foster care program within HHS. It would require states
to identify child victims of sex trafficking in the foster care system
and put in place a plan to help them.
H.R. 4573 - International Megan's Law to Prevent Demand for Child Sex
Trafficking
establishes a model framework for international
law enforcement notifications when convicted child sex offenders pose a
danger to children in a destination country. It would require providing
advance notice of intended travel by registered child-sex offenders
outside the U.S. to the government of the country of destination and
requesting foreign governments to notify the U.S. when a known
child-sex offender is seeking to enter the U.S.

Rokita
Readings
A
clickable
offering
of
books
and
articles
that
I've
read
recently
and
highly
recommend,
as
we
strive
together
to
"Keep
the
Republic."
For
the
Rokita
Reading
in
this
issue is
a
column
I
read
earlier
this
year
that
was
sent
to
me
by
a
friend
and
Rokita
Report
reader.
As
the
House
passed
the
DOTCOM
Act
this
week,
which
I
introduced
with
Reps.
John
Shimkus
and
Marsha
Blackburn,
I
was
reminded
of
the
good
points
made
in
this
column,
" America's
Internet
Surrender ,"
by
L.
Gordon
Crovitz.
Crovitz
column,
and
the
DOTCOM
Act
itself,
were
in
response
to
the
Obama
administration's
proposal
to
cede
control
of
certain
internet
domain
functions
to
a
"multistakeholder
community."
Additional
background
on
the
issue
is
in
the
column
and
below,
as
the
House
passed
the
DOTCOM
Act
this
week.
Crovitz
argues,
and
I
agree,
that
we
should
not
relinquish
our
authority
over
these
functions.
He
makes
the
comparison
that
this
is
on
par
with
American
naval
forces
no
longer
patrolling
the
seas.
Crovitz
rightly
has
concerns
that
countries
who
do
not
value
freedom
the
same
way
we
do,
like
China
and
Russia,
would
seek
an
increased
role
and
an
attempt
to
limit
internet
freedom.
That,
and
also
protecting the
greatest
economic
engine
to of
the
last
50
years,
are
the
reasons
why
I introduced
the
DOTCOM
Act.
Protecting
America's
Internet
Interests
-
DOTCOM
Clears
Committee
On
Thursday,
the
House
considered,
and
passed as
an
amendment
to
the
annual
defense
spending
legislation, a
bill I
introduced,
H.R.
4342,
the
Domain
Openness

Continued
Oversight
Matters
(DOTCOM)
Act .
The
DOTCOM
Act
would
prohibit
the
Department
of

National

Administration
(NTIA)
from
turning
over
its
domain
name
system
oversight
responsibilities
pending
a
Government
Accountability
Office
(GAO)
report
to
Congress.
The
internet
is
the
single
greatest
economic
machine
created
in
the
last
50
years
and
it
is
a
shining
example
of
our
American
Exceptionalism.
It
is
against
our
own
national
economic
interest
to
relinquish
control,
especially
without
a
clear
path
forward
that
will
protect
internet
freedom.

I
will

Creating

Cutting
Red

-
House
Passes
Water
Infrastructure
Legislation
On
Tuesday,
the
House
considered
and
passed
the
Conference
Report
on
the
Water
Resources
Reform
and
Development
Act
(WRRDA),
H.R.
3080 , with
overwhelming
bipartisan
support.
This
is
an
updated
version
of
legislation
we
passed
last
year
that
has
been
negotiated
in
a
House-Senate
conference
committee.
The
bill
will
now
head
back
to
the
Senate
for
final
consideration
before
going
to
the
President
for
his
signature.
H.R.
3080
streamlines
and
strengthens
water
transportation
networks
to
help
create
jobs
and
support
economic
growth
by
authorizing
several
water
resources
projects.
It
also
modifies
an
additional
eight
previously
authorized
water
resources
projects,
as
project
cost
increases
require
congressional
approval.
This
bill
is
also
significant
because
it
is
the
first
water
resources
authorization
that
has
passed
without
earmarks.
That's
progress,
likely
not
realized
without
House
Republicans
banning
earmarks
in
2011.
In
addition
to
the
jobs
and
growth
this
legislation
will
create,
the
bill
has
significant
impact
for
the
Greater
Lafayette
area
because
it simplifies
the
process
for
Congress
to
authorize
waterway
infrastructure
studies
and
projects
like
the
ongoing
efforts
to
address
erosion
of
the
Wabash
River
in
Greater
Lafayette.
Now,
private
nonfederal
projects,
like
the
Wabash
River
Enhancement
Corporation
(WREC),
have
a
more
direct
avenue
to
make
their
case
for
federal
assistance.
These
reforms
also
allow
the
use
of
funds
from
non-federal
interests,
like
WREC,
to
expedite
the
processing
of
permits
within
the
regulatory
program
of
the
Corps
of
Engineers.

Stopping
Human
Trafficking
Also
on
Tuesday, I,
along
with
my
House
colleagues,
took
a
stand
to
protect
the
victims
of
human
trafficking
by
supporting
a
series
of
measures
aimed
at
cracking
down
on
this
awful
crime.
The
deplorable
act
of
human
trafficking
must
stop
and
we
must
do
everything
we
can
to
support
victims
and
prevent
these
crimes
from
occurring.
These
bills
are
a
significant
step
in
ending
the
scourge
of
human
trafficking.

the
Interagency
Task
