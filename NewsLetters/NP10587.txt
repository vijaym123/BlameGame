Dear Friends,
Congress
is out of session this week for district work, so I've been traveling
the state, meeting with constituents, working with educators, and
touring small businesses.
On Tuesday I held the third in a
series of roundtables with educators on cyberbullying, meeting with
educators in Weston at Robert Bland Middle School. Principals, counselors and
district employees shared with me their challenges in keeping
students safe and preventing conflicts and cyberbullying on social
media.
Following the roundtable, I participated in Google's Online
Safety Roadshow at Robert Bland Middle School, where enthusiastic Google
employees used games and humor to teach students how to stay safe
online, create strong passwords, recognize spam and phishing emails, and
be smart in sharing content online (pictured below).
I spent Thursday in Jackson
County, starting the day with an assembly at Ripley High School to teach
students about the importance of money management and starting to
save for the future. I also visited Mayor Carolyn Rader's office, where
she and Matt Anderson, chief wastewater operator for the city of
Ripley, detailed plans for the improvement and modernization of Ripley's
sewer infrastructure.
Later
that afternoon, I visited three Jackson County employers: K.S. West
Virginia, Valtronics and Star Plastics Ravenswood. I enjoyed the
opportunity to meet with these business owners and employees and discuss issues
important to them. In the photo below, Star Plastics President Doug
Ritchie shows me the components used in plastic
production.
On this Good Friday, I would like to wish you and your
families a very blessed Easter and safe travels this holiday
weekend.
Thank you for reading my
weekly
e-newsletter, and
as always, you can join in the conversation on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
Shelley
