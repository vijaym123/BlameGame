Background:
In 2012, Rep. Miller successfully defeated the Administrations attempt to eliminate and/or reduce the Air National Guard personnel and assets, including the A-10 Thunderbolt
aircrafts based at Selfridge Air National Guard Base (ANGB).
As a result of her efforts, the Defense Authorizations for 2013 and 2014 preserved Air Guard resources until an analysis could be conducted on the Air Force and its current and future structure
with respect to its mission.
The detailed report, completed last month by the National Commission on the Structure of the Air Force, included recommendations to the President, the Department of Defense and Congress to evaluate and improve the overall structure
of the Air Force.
Specifically of note, the Commission recommended that the Air Force place greater reliance on the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve to lower overall military personnel costs and produce a more ready and capable force.
Despite this
recommendation, the Administration is once again seeking to undermine one of our most capable, cost-effective resources by eliminating the entire A-10 fleet used by the Air Guard without identifying a replacement.
