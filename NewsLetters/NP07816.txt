July 13, 2014
Friends,
On December 12, 2013, I introduced the Stop This Overreaching
Presidency
(STOP) Resolution , which
directs the House of Representatives to take legal actions against the
President for executive overreaches. Since gaining support from 119
Representatives, the STOP Resolution has evolved and on Thursday, the Speaker
of the House submitted a resolution directing the House of
Representatives to initiate litigation to defend the Constitution, citing the
Presidents unilateral changes to the
Affordable Care
Act.
The
Supreme Court
ruled
on June 28, 2012, that the penalties under
the
Affordable Care Act
are a tax.
The Constitution of the United
States does not grant
any
President the authority to waive a
tax, to decide when a tax will be applied, or to exempt favored
classes of people from a tax.
When President Obamas signature
legislation prompted layoffs, premium spikes, and insurance cancellations, he
unilaterally changed the law more than 32 times.
Going as far
as delaying the
Affordable Care Act
enrollment dates and
exempting certain groups
of people from
the laws tax.
Our Constitution has served as the foundation
for our countrys success, and it clearly outlines the separation of
powers between the Legislative and Executive Branches. As elected
officials, we took an oath to support and defend the Constitution, and my
oath is something that I take very seriously.
While
my colleagues and I pursue legal action against the Executive Branch,
we will not turn away from any of the other pressing issues facing our
country.
Job creation and economic growth are my top priority
and I was proud to join my colleagues in passing the
SKILLS Act
last week.
Providing Job Seekers with Skills
Training
The workforce investment fund will help provide job training for many
job seekers in our community.
Local groups, like United Way of
SC, agree that the old, one-size-fits-all approach needed to be updated
and outdated programs needed to be consolidated.
The
SKILLS Act
will give job trainers and educators the
flexibility to meet their needs and help people get back to work. Pictured below

will impact.
Lawsuit
FAQ
I
have received a lot of calls and emails regarding the House lawsuit so I
would like to highlight a few of the most common questions and
provide you with some answers.
If you have any additional questions,
please do not hesitate to contact me.
Q:
Will taxpayer dollars be used
to pay for this suit?
Is it a waste of
money?
Q:
Shouldnt the
House be focused on the jobs and the economy instead of lawsuits against
the president?

Southern Border Illegal
Immigration Crisis
The illegal immigration
situation on our border is a national crisis.
President Obamas
executive actions and inaction have resulted in thousands of children
leaving their home countries and attempting to cross our southwestern
border.
In order to stop the surge of illegal immigration and hold
these parent countries accountable, I cosponsored the Illegal Entry
Accountability Act, H.R. 5014. This legislation suspends all assistance,
excluding money to fight drug trafficking, to Mexico, Honduras,
Guatemala and El Salvador until Congress determines they have taken
sufficient action to mitigate unlawful US-Mexico border crossings. This
situation is a result of the Presidents refusal to enforce our current
immigration laws.
If the President wants to fix our countrys
immigration issues, he must first start by enforcing our countrys existing
immigration laws.
