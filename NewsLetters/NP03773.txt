Dear Friend,
The open enrollment period for health
care coverage in 2015 began in November,
and with it came stories from people all
across Ohio. Whether in Ohios 16th
District or any other part of the state,
the negative impact of the
Presidents health care law continues
to be widespread.
Many are facing higher premiums and
deductibles. People are losing access to
their doctors whom they like and trust.
Sadly, I have heard from people living in
my district who have had their hours
reduced at work due to the laws
employer mandates
turning full-time
work into part-time work at a time when
they can least afford it.
A small business owner from North Canton
contacted me to inform me of the
laws negatives effects on his
business. He said that if 75 percent of his
eligible employees participate in the
companys health insurance plan, he
will be put out of business within 3-6
months. Though hes planning on
growing his company, the 30-hour definition
of full-time employment within the
Presidents health care law threatens
the companys very existence. A
retired constituent told me that his
monthly premiums have tripled and his
deductible has doubled - forcing him to
re-enter the workforce to cover the
significant increase in his health care
costs. A woman living in Massillon said
that though she has insurance now, she
cant go to the doctor because she
cant afford her deductible. Another
said that her health care costs are so high
she is forced to choose whether to buy food
or pay her utility bill to stay warm.
People all across my district are growing
more and more frustrated with the narrow
networks and higher costs of their health
care since the implementation of the
law.
That is why we in the House of
Representatives have worked to reduce this
broken laws harmful effects.
Earlier this month, we passed a continuing
resolution-omnibus bill that reined in the
Presidents health care law by
eliminating new funding for it.
Additionally, it cut funding for the
Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB)
by $10 million.It also prevents a
taxpayer bailout of the risk corridor
program within the Presidents health
care law, and requires the Office of
Inspector General (OIG) to report to
Congress on improper payments of
subsidies.
As we approach the 114
th
Congress, I am hopeful that
our work in the House will be matched by
the newly Republican-controlled Senate. I
expect us to work together on legislation
that repeals the medical device tax,
provides relief to Ohioans by repealing the
individual mandate, and ensures patients
and their families, not unelected
bureaucrats, are in charge of their
treatment decisions by repealing IPAB.
I have made clear that there are parts
of the law that I support such as
eliminating lifetime or annual spending
caps on essential benefits, preventing
insurers from unjustly cancelling policies,
and closing the Medicare Part D
doughnut hole, but this law
does not effectively address any of the
cost issues that already prevent Americans
from seeking or receiving appropriate
healthcare. We need to work toward real
health care reform that protects the
doctor-patient relationship and lowers
costs while increasing choices. I look
forward to building upon our work in the
next Congress and working with the Senate
to provide relief for Ohioans who are
grappling with the consequences of the
Presidents failed health care
law.
