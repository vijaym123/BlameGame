Remembering Our Past and Protecting Our Future
Dear Friends,
Today is September 11, the 13 th
anniversary of nearly 3,000 Americans losing their lives in the Twin Towers in New York City, at the Pentagon, and on flight 93 in Pennsylvania brought down by terrorists.
We are ever mindful of the terror threat.
Even now, action against ISIS is the subject of debate in Congress.
And it reminds us that this threat and the price of freedom are very high.
We salute our troops. We salute those Americans who have fought and died and been severely injured and had their lives changed forever because of the threat of terrorism and because of their commitment to keep America free.
Thank you.
And please
share your thoughts and concerns
with me on this and other issues that are important to you.
Sincerely,
