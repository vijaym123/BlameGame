Dear Friend,
I hope this finds you well and warm!
I wanted to give you a short
update on a provision I helped pass in the House today.
The bipartisan budget agreement that was enacted late last year to
avoid a government shutdown included a provision that would have slowed
the rate of the annual Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) increase for
certain military pensions.
This is an issue that I know has been on
the minds of many South Dakotans.
I wanted to let you know that this afternoon I helped the House pass a
repeal of that reduction for current and former members of the
military.
This means that if you entered the military before January
2014, there will be no changes to your benefit plan.
We were also able to keep this provision budget neutral by making a
small, one-year reduction to entitlement spending.
If you have any questions on this change, please reach out to my office
nearest you
or click here
to send me an email directly.
Stay warm!
-Kristi

Dear
Friend,
I
hope
this
finds
you
well
and
warm!
I
wanted
to
give
you
a
short
update
on
a
provision
I
helped
pass
in
the
House
today.
The
bipartisan
budget
agreement
that
was
enacted
late
last
year
to
avoid
a
government
shutdown
included
a
provision
that
would
have
slowed
the
rate
of
the
annual
Cost
of
Living
Adjustment
(COLA)
increase
for
certain
military
pensions.
This
is
an
issue
that
I
know
has
been
on
the
minds
of
many
South
Dakotans.
I
wanted
to
let
you
know
that
this
afternoon
I
helped
the
House
pass
a
repeal
of
that
reduction
for
current
and
former
members
of
the
military.
This
means
that
if
you
entered
the
military
before
January
2014,
there
will
be
no

We
were
also

this
provision
budget
neutral
by
making
a

to
entitlement
spending.
