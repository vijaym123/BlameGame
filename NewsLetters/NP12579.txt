Friend-
I am pleased to let you know that on Friday, January 31, 2014, the State Department
released
its final environmental impact study regarding construction and operation of the Keystone XL pipeline.
It is my hope that the administration acts without delay on this project to spur economic growth and energy independence.
Yours in service,
Randy
P.S.
I have supported the Northern Route Approval Act ( H.R. 3 ), which removes any need for presidential approval of the pipeline, and the Keystone For a Secure Tomorrow Act ( H.R. 334 ), which would allow Congress to directly and immediately approve the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline.
