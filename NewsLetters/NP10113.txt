WASHINGTON, DC
Rep. Louie Gohmert (TX-01) was just named the next President of The Texas State Society of Washington, D.C. He issued the following statement expressing his deep gratitude for the privilege of serving in this position:
It is an absolute honor to serve as the President of The Texas State Society of Washington, D.C. Community is always important. The Texas State Society provides this essential kinship among Texas colleagues living and working in Washington, DC. As a native Texan and United States Representative of the First Congressional District of Texas, it is exciting to have this opportunity to encourage camaraderie among Texans and friends in the heart of the nations capital.
Since this organization has a heritage that is 104 years old and includes most of the greatest Texas Representatives and Senators of the last 100 years, being the new president becomes even more of a privilege.
Though my duties take me to Washington, D.C. most weeks, Texas is ever and always home."
The Texas State Society of Washington, D.C. (TSS) is a bipartisan organization that encourages a fraternal spirit among Texans and friends in our nations capital. In addition to various events, in January 1981, the Texas State Society began hosting the Black Tie and Boots Inaugural reception, which has become a popular event throughout Washington, DC.
