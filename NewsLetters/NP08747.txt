This week, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio
introduced legislation that would ensure
the federal government uses its spectrum
efficiently and responsibly, and aims to
free up additional spectrum for
commercial use. The Senate passed a VA
reform bill that includes a measure
sponsored by Marco to increase
accountability in the VA, and approved
his bill to allow the Director of
National Intelligence (DNI) to complete
independent checks on drone targeting
decisions. He also warned of the threat
terrorists in Iraq pose on U.S. security.
Finally, Marco wishes all fathers a happy
and blessed Fathers Day.

Rubio Introduces Wireless Innovation
Act
Marco, a member of the Senate
Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, introduced the Wireless
Innovation Act to reallocate spectrum
used by the federal government for
commercial wireless services, ensure
greater transparency and accountability
of the federal governments
spectrum use, and promote wireless
innovation and deployment.
Marco first discussed his wireless
agenda during
an
event at 1776
on Wednesday. He issued
the following statement with the
introduction of the legislation:
The use of wireless broadband
and Internet connected devices has
caused an explosion of economic growth
and innovation that was previously
unimagined, and wireless traffic is
projected to grow exponentially in the
years ahead. In order to meet that
demand and ensure that the U.S.
continues to lead the world in wireless
innovation and technology, we must
ensure that the federal government uses
its spectrum in an efficient and
responsible manner, and we must free up
additional spectrum for commercial
use.
This legislation accomplishes
both goals by directing NTIA to
reallocate federal spectrum for
commercial use. The Wireless Innovation
Act will also provide transparency on
the use and value of federal spectrum
and inform the public on how federal
entities use a scarce public resource.
Passing the Wireless Innovation Act
will grow our economy and ensure that
consumers continue to enjoy the
benefits of wireless
technology.

After Rubios Push For Greater
Accountability, Senate Passes VA Reform
Bill
On Wednesday, the Senate passed
Veterans Affairs (VA) reform legislation
that included a measure sponsored by
Marco to increase accountability in the
VA by empowering the VA Secretary with
complete authority to fire or demote VA
Senior Executive Service (SES) or
equivalent employees based on
performance. Prior to the Senates
passage, Marco delivered
a
floor speech
highlighting the
importance of greater accountability in
the VA.
On Friday, Marco met with senior staff
and patients at the VA medical center in
West Palm Beach to discuss various issues
concerning veteran access to quality
health care.
An excerpt of Wednesdays floor
speech is available below:
The one I am proudest of, the
whole bill is important, but the one
Ive been working on personally,
the one that weve been engaged
in making this happen, is
accountability. Giving the Secretary
the power to hire and to fire those
mid-level bureaucrats that are not
doing their job. Thats an
important measure, Im glad
its included in this.

Senate Unanimously Approves Rubio,
King Bill To Provide Independent Check
On Targeting Decisions
On Wednesday, the Senate unanimously
approved legislation authored by Marco
and Senator Angus King (I-ME) as part of
the Fiscal Year 2014
Intelligence Authorization Act .
The Rubio-King provision is based on
legislation introduced in May 2013 as
S.1035,
the
Targeted Strike Oversight Reform
Act .The final provision was
moved to the classified annex. Rubio and
King requested that an unclassified
summary of the provision be made
available to the public.
The Rubio-King provision requires the
Director of National Intelligence (DNI)
to complete an independent assessment of
the available intelligence supporting any
determination by the Administration that
an identified U.S. person is engaged in
acts of international terrorism against
the United States and meets the
governments criteria for approving
the use of targeted lethal action. This
legislation will require an independent
assessment of the nomination of a U.S.
person for lethal strike to be completed
within fifteen days. It also requires the
DNI to immediately notify Congress in
writing of the results of the assessment,
and the identity of the U.S. person.
In passing this legislation,
we are adding an additional layer of
review to any consideration for lethal
strike of a U.S. person who has joined
enemy forces overseas. While in no way
do we limit the
commander-in-chiefs ability to
conduct war, we are safeguarding that
the executive branch fully considers
any targeted lethal strike of a U.S.
citizen by convening a special panel
outside the chain of command to
consider each case,
said Rubio . In doing so,
we are ensuring that even those U.S.
citizens who betray their country and
join enemy forces at war with the
United States receive an extra level of
scrutiny.
Rubio: Terrorists In Iraq Threaten
U.S. Security
In light of Al Qaedas advances
in Iraq, Marco delivered a Senate floor
speech on Thursday warning of the threats
to U.S. security. An excerpt of the
speech is below:
The choice before us will be
whether we prevent it now, or whether
we deal with the consequences of it
later. And I urge the White House to
take this matter for the importance
that it deserves and to come to this
Congress, as soon as possible, with a
clear and concrete plan on how we are
going to deal with and engage in this
emerging emergency situation that we
now face that threatens the national
security of the United States now, and
places a grave threat to the national
security of our country in the years to
come.

Constituent Casework Corner
Katie has a tumor in her neck that
requires life-sustaining surgery. She
contacted Senator Rubio's office for
assistance with obtaining a Special
Enrollment Period in order to change her
AARP Preferred Provider Organizer (PPO)
Plan to a Health Maintenance Organization
(HMO) plan because her surgeon does not
accept PPO Plans. A member of the staff
contacted the Centers for
Medicaid/Medicare Services (CMS) to
investigate the possibility of approving
her request. Due to the urgency and
sensitivity of this request, CMS granted
the Special Enrollment in Humana.
