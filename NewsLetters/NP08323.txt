Access to the Internet should never be taxed. And yet, many states and localities are looking to do just this. Pull out your most recent phone bill -- look closely, and you'll notice a list of access taxes tacked onto your bill each month. If you look at the bill from your Internet service provider, those same taxes are not there.
I am championing a bill to permanently ensure that citizens cannot be taxed for Internet access: the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act. Take a look at
H.R.3086 . Let's keep access to the Internet tax-free.
Yours in service,
Randy
