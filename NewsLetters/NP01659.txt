Washington
Should Follow the Example Local
Governments Set
Dear
Friend,
Last week, I had the opportunity to meet
with nearly 300 local elected officials who
join me in representing the two cities, 21
counties, and 39 towns that make up
Virginias Fifth District. It is an
honor to work alongside these state
Senators, Delegates, Board of Supervisors
members, City and Town Council members,
School Board members, and other
Constitutional Officers to serve the fine
people we represent, and I am grateful that
I had the opportunity to thank our
dedicated public servants.
Virginias Fifth District spans
across 10,000 square miles from the North
Carolina line up to Fauquier County, and
consistent cooperation with state and local
officials ensures that we address the wide
variety of issues our constituents from
Southside to the Northern Piedmont
encounter. It is vitally important that all
levels of government work together closely,
particularly to identify issues where the
federal government is overstepping its
authority or handing down burdensome
unfunded mandates, making it harder for
state and local government to provide the
services for which they are
responsible.
Listening to our local leaders across
our district makes it clear that Washington
still stands in the way of a robust
economic recovery. We all share the grave
concerns about our stagnant economy and
believe that job creation must be the top
priority. Every day, they see first-hand
how top-down policies, like the Dodd-Frank
Act, harm our Main Street businesses and
create an uneven playing field. They see
the regulations from the Presidents
healthcare law forcing employers to cut
working hours and negatively impact small
businesses, working families, and even the
emergency service volunteers who many of
our communities rely on to keep us safe.
They balance their budgets, knowing that
they cannot spend more than what they take
in, yet they watch Washington fail to make
the difficult choices necessary to bring
about fiscal responsibility and fear that
state and local services may suffer the
consequences for Washington's
recklessness.
I am advocating for policies and a
discourse in Washington that follow the
example that each of these state and local
officials set in their roles. That is a
spirit of cooperation
acting on
common sense for the common good in the
best interests of our communities. We are
elected to serve to help make things
better, and listening to the concerns of
Fifth District Virginians allows me to best
serve you in Washington. I will continue to
fight for policies that make life easier
for our Main Street businesses and family
farms to spur the job creation we so
desperately need.
Thomas Jefferson believed government
works best when it is closest to the
people, and we are fortunate to be
represented by dedicated public servants at
the state and local level. I look forward
to continuing to work alongside these
leaders to set policies that will create a
brighter future for all our citizens and
communities.
