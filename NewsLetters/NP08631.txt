Kansas Common Sense
June 16, 2014
Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thanks for your continued interest in
receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
Supporting the Veterans Choice Act
On Wednesday, the Senate voted 93-3 to pass legislation to address the
failures within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). As a member of
the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee and a sponsor of the Veterans'
Access to Care through Choice, Accountability and Transparency Act of
2014, I was pleased the Senate rose to the occasion and came together
on this critical legislation. I was unable to vote as I was in Kansas
for my father's funeral, but there should be no question about my
support for this bill. Had I been in Washington, I would have joined my
colleagues in voting in favor of this bipartisan plan to help make
certain veterans have access to quality, timely care. I will continue
to work to address the challenges and problems at the Department of
Veterans Affairs so our nation's heroes have a VA worthy of their
service. Click here
to watch an
interview with Eyewitness News KWCH in Wichita about this legislation.
VA Audit on Quality, Access to Care
I was once again disappointed to hear the latest news from the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regarding their findings from a
so-called "nationwide audit" conducted by VA employees through
face-to-face interviews, which I believe is far from a comprehensive
assessment and sincere look at the magnitude of the dysfunction at
hand. The Office of Inspector General (IG) wasn't involved whatsoever,
and those conducting the audit did not utilize the same practices and
procedures as the IG. If this cursory investigation discovered
thousands of veterans who have yet to receive care, I believe these
numbers only scratch the surface of the far-reaching problems plaguing
veterans. While the VA is touting that more than 3,772 VA staff were
interviewed, I'd like to know how many veterans themselves - if any -
were interviewed. We need to ask our veterans if they are satisfied
with the quality of care that they're receiving and let them be the
judge of whether or not good things are happening at the VA. I expect
to learn more about these delays and unauthorized lists, and will
continue to engage with VA leaders directly until this situation is
resolved.
Introducing Legislation to Expand Access for Emergency Care, Urging DOJ
to Investigate VA Misconduct and Calling on VA Secretary Gibson for
Long-Overdue Answers
On Thursday, I introduced the Veterans Emergency Health Safety Net
Expansion Act of 2014 with Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, which would
expand access to the Department of Veterans Affairs emergency safety
net to all VA-enrolled veterans who rely solely on the VA for their
medical care. This bill cuts through red tape and eliminates the
24-month rule that prevents veterans from receiving reimbursements for
their emergency medical expenses. Veterans should not be forced to bear
the burden of emergency health care costs because of an arbitrary rule
that has previously been amended by the Department of Defense. Those
who have served our nation with duty and honor deserve quality health
care when they need it. Click here
to learn more.
This week, in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder, I urged the
Department of Justice to join efforts with the Department of Veterans
Affairs Inspector General's investigation into the misconduct at VA
facilities. The Senate Commerce, Justice and Science Subcommittee
Fiscal Year 2015 appropriations bill includes the necessary resources
to conduct investigations to make certain whether any current or former
VA officials violated the law, with a report issued 30 days after
enactment. Click here
to learn more and read my full letter to AG Eric Holder.
Several Senate colleagues and I called on Department of Veterans
Affairs Acting Secretary Sloan Gibson this week urging him to extend
the program Access Received Closer to Home (ARCH) and the contracted
medical services that currently benefit rural veterans. The ARCH pilot
program has been operating since 2011 at five rural pilot sites, one of
which is Pratt, Kansas. This program allows veterans to access health
care services from community providers if they reside at least one hour
from a VA medical center or Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC).
Despite the overwhelming satisfaction of veterans who utilize ARCH, the
VHA has begun shutting down the program, restricting veterans from the
services they have come to rely upon and directing them back to VA
facilities. I believe the VHA intentionally misled my colleagues and I
who have sought answers from the VA for months regarding the potential
extension of the program. On May 22, 2014, the Senate Appropriations
Committee approved legislation directing the VA to continue providing
medical care through ARCH in fiscal year 2015 using existing
authorities. In light of this legislative action and the Senate passage
of the Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability and
Transparency Act of 2014 last week, I am seeking Secretary Gibson's
leadership to stop VHA's plans to dismantle ARCH and make certain that
veterans who are currently receiving medical services through ARCH will
continue to receive that care. Click here
to learn more.
Visiting Colmery-O'Neil VA Medical Center in Topeka
On Friday, I joined Rep. Lynn Jenkins at the Topeka Colmery-O'Neil VA
Medical Center to visit with patients and learn more about their
experiences. I will continue to work to address the challenges and
problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs so our nation's heroes
have a VA worthy of their service. Click here
for a
write-up on our visit by the The Wichita Eagle.

Brown at the Colmery-O'Neil VA Medical Center in Topeka on Friday.
Disappointing Appropriations Postponement
I was expecting to participate in the Senate Appropriations Committee
markup of the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill for fiscal year
2015 this week. I serve as Ranking Member of the Labor-HHS-Education
Appropriations Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over funding for
all accounts at the Departments of Labor and Education and for most
agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services. However, I
was disappointed that this markup was postponed indefinitely. According
to news reports, the markup was canceled because some Senate Democrats
did not want to vote on Obamacare and other politically sensitive
amendments. It is the duty of this Committee to make tough choices and
take tough votes to reign in federal spending and prioritize
initiatives that are important to our nation, and Democrats must not
shirk this responsibility. I will continue to press for consideration
of the Labor-HHS-Educations Appropriations bill. Click here
to learn more.
Visiting Olathe Medical Center
During my time in Kansas, I visited with administrators and staff at
Olathe Medical Center (OMC) to learn more about how they utilize
resources to care for their communities. OMC is the centerpiece of the
Olathe Health System, which includes Miami County Medical Center, 35
family care and specialty clinics of Olathe Medical Services, and more
than 300 physicians and 2,500 employees. The Olathe Health System
provides patients a comprehensive range of health services from
prenatal to hospice care. My discussions with Kansas hospital
administrators and staff cover a variety of topics. Almost every visit
involves discussions about the ever-increasing federal regulatory
burdens hospitals face as they work to provide quality health care
services to their patients.
During this visit, we discussed unnecessarily burdensome and flawed
Medicare audit regulations. Many Kansas hospitals have been forced to
divert significant resources away from caring for patients to appeal
incorrect audit decisions that are ultimately overturned through the
appeal process. This broken Medicare audit program places an
unreasonable burden on providers, and has created a two-year appeals
backlog within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
I continue working to require HHS to address this problem. In April, I
met with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator
Marilyn Tavenner to discuss these concerns. CMS is the division of HHS
responsible for administering Medicare and Medicaid. Also, I included
language in the Senate Fiscal Year 2015 Labor-HHS-Education
appropriations bill requiring HHS to account for improving the Medicare
audit appeals process and addressing the current backlog. Thank you to
OMC Senior Vice President of Operations John Staton for hosting my
visit, and to Olathe Mayor Mike Copeland for joining me on my tour.
Leavenworth Lions Club
I also attended Leavenworth's Lions Club to discuss the bipartisan
passage of legislation designed to address concerns at the Department
of Veterans Affairs. Thanks to the Leavenworth Lions Club and host
Caroline Arter for the warm welcome, club president Kimberley Pearl for
the invitation to speak, and to Lieutenant Colonel Richard Wright for
the wonderful program on the history of Fort Leavenworth. It was also
great to see Leavenworth Mayor Mark Preisinger in attendance. Here's
a write-up
in the Leavenworth Times about my visit.
