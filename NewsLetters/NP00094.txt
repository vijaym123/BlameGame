News from Representative Seth Moulton
Dear Friend,
When I first came to Congress, I made a conscious decision to forgo the
standard coverage used by Members of Congress to continue receiving
care from Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities. I did this because
our VA health care system is in need of drastic reform. Until it is
fixed, and every veteran in our nation is receiving the very best care,
I will stand with the millions of veterans who receive care from the
VA. I believe I will be a more effective advocate for change in
Washington because I understand what veterans go through everyday.
Thats why the first legislation I introduced in the House of
Representatives is focused on improving the VA. The VA Education,
Training, and Sustainability (VETS) package is a set of four bills
aimed at improving the talent pipeline
at VA medical facilities across the country. VETS focuses on recruiting
new talent, investing in existing employees, retaining staff, and
improving oversight of employee incentive and training programs. These
bills will help the VA attract and retain outstanding health care
employees through increased scholarship funding and debt reduction
programs.
I spoke with the Boston Globe
and National
Public Radio
about the
problems I personally encountered with the VA and my commitment to
fixing it for current and future veterans.
This bill is a first of many steps toward quality care for our
veterans. I wont stop until our veterans receive the care they deserve
and the care they have earned.
Sincerely,
Seth Moulton

Dear
Friend,
When
I
first
came
to
Congress,
I
made
a
conscious
decision
to
forgo
the
standard
coverage
used
by
Members
of
Congress
to
continue
receiving
care
from
Veterans
Affairs
(VA)
medical
facilities.
I
did
this
because
our
VA
health
care
system
is
in
need
of
drastic
reform.
Until
it
is
fixed,
and
every
veteran
in
our
nation
is
receiving
the
very
best
care,
I
will
stand
with
the
millions
of
veterans
who
receive
care
from
the
VA.
I
believe
I
will
be
a
more
effective
advocate
for
change
in
Washington
because
I
understand
what
veterans
go
through
everyday.
That&#146;s
why
the
first
legislation
I
introduced
in
the
House
of
Representatives
is
focused
on
improving
the
VA.
The
VA
Education,
Training,

Sustainability
(VETS)
package
is
a
set
of
four
bills
aimed
at
improving
the
talent
pipeline

across
the
country.
VETS
focuses
on
recruiting
new
talent,
investing
in
existing

retaining
staff,
and
improving
oversight
of
employee
incentive
and
training

These
bills
will
help
the
VA
attract
and
retain
outstanding
health
care
employees
through
increased
scholarship
funding
and
debt
reduction
programs.
I

I
won&#146;t

the
care
