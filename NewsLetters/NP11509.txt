March 10, 2014
Dear Friends,
Last Tuesday, the president released his
annual budget, which once again
taxes too much, and
spends too much . However, what I was most disappointed by was the
president's failure to approve construction for the
Savannah Harbor Expansion Project (SHEP) , our states number one
economic development project.
The administration has
emphasized time after time that deepening the port is critical to the state
and the nation, and has promised to deliver economic development and
economic opportunity to the state of Georgia through the authorization
and funding of SHEP. Vice President Biden visited the port in Savannah
last September and said the project would be expedited and built, come
hell or high water . The president himself
included SHEP in his We Cant Wait initiative in 2012, saying to Jay
Leno during an appearance on the
Tonight Show
that the Savannah
port needs to be deepened, and if we don't do that, these ships are
going to go someplace else and we'll lose jobs."
The
administration has failed to honor their promises before, but this latest
action against Georgia has forced the state to
seek
other options
to get this project moving as quickly as possible.
I applaud Governor Deal for showing real leadership
and refusing to let construction be delayed any longer by the
administrations refusal to fund this project, even if that means spending the
states own money.
The Savannah Harbor Expansion Project
will support hundreds of thousands of jobs in the state and the nation
and will generate billions in revenue. While the White House continues
to claim that they cannot approve this project until Congress passes
a law authorizing it,
Congress did so in the
Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 , which the president signed into
law in January. By not allowing the Army Corps of Engineers to sign an
agreement with the Georgia Ports Authority and begin construction
with state money, the Obama administration is explicitly ignoring
existing law. After a decade and a half of working on SHEP, it is simply
unacceptable for construction to be delayed any longer.
The
administration has turned its back on the state of Georgia and wasted the
opportunity for economic and job growth at a time when our country
needs it most. The entire Georgia delegation has expressed their
disappointment in the lack of support for SHEP and
requests
authorization for the state to begin construction on its own . We
cannot afford to lose any more time on this project, and I hope the
administration reconsiders their poor choice and allows the state to
move forward with this critical project.
I further discuss
this important issue on the Senate floor here:
