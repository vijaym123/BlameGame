In
late February, I sent out an
eNewsletter on how
Obamacares 30-hour provision
is affecting part-time workers all across
this country, including those Hoosiers working for small businesses,
restaurants, retailers, school districts and community colleges like Ivy
Tech.
In short, by requiring employers to provide insurance to
employees working 30 hours or more, Obamacare has essentially cost
part-time workers their hours, but more importantly their wages.
This increasing number of Obamacare 29ers has become a serious problem,
and its time that lawmakers, irrespective of their political
investments in the Presidents healthcare law, address this
issue.
This is exactly why I introduced the bipartisan supported H.R. 2575,
Save American Workers (SAW) Act , which Im proud to
say
passed the House this week
by a vote of
248-179!
Obamacare
29ers
When I travel around the 9 th
District, I hear numerous concerns from employees about losing their wages as
a result of Obamacares 30-hour rule.
These concerns have been
affirmed by employers who have reached out to members of Congress,
stating that theyll be unable to sustain their operations and
simultaneously provide their part-time employees with health insurance.
Thus, the only option is to reduce the hours of part-time workers to
below 30 hour per week, all in order to comply with
Obamacare.
So what are
the actual consequences of the 30-hour provision?
Well the math is
actually quite simple.
If you work 36 hours a week at $13.66 an
hour, and Obamacares 30-hour rule reduces you to 29 hours a week,
youll have a loss of 28 hours a month, or about $5,000 a year.
For hardworking American families just trying to get by, this is a heavy
burden in an already down economy.
Restoring Middle Class
Working Wages
As many have suggested, including the
President, there is very little hope that Republicans and Democrats will
come to an agreement on the merits of Obamacare.
While I still
maintain that the law is fundamentally flawed and ultimately unworkable,
I believe we must find common ground to correct some of the many
adverse effects of the Presidents healthcare law.
The Save American
Workers act is one of these solutions.
First and foremost, American part-time workers do not
want their wages reduced, regardless of their position on
Obamacare.
Reduced wages take away workers ability to provide for
their families and cover basic living costs.
So to ensure that
part-time workers do not take another hit, this week the House passed the
widely supported
SAW Act on a bipartisan
vote.
Going Forward
We now need Senate
Democrats to acknowledge Obamacares harmful 30-hour provision, the benefits
of the SAW Act, and subsequently help push this bill forward.
Moreover, the President must ultimately do the same in order to help our
American workers.
Right now, I remain cautiously optimistic that the
Senate will take up this legislation, but its crucial that Americans
continue to contact their representatives to explain how the 30-hour
provision will affect them, their friends and families.
Noteworthy: Senator Susan Collins, joined by original cosponsor Senator
Joe Donnelly, has already introduced companion legislation to the SAW
Act, called the
Forty Hours Is Full Time
Act .
I applaud them for their efforts and look to their leadership on
moving this legislation forward.
If you or someone you know has
been adversely affected by any part of the Presidents healthcare law,
I encourage you to contact me.
Additionally, if you have any
questions about the Save American Works Act, please reach out to our
office.
Yours in Service,
Todd
