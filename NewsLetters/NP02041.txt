Dear Friend:
Tomorrowmarks Obamacares fifth
anniversary. While anniversaries usually mark
joyful occasions, the costs, confusion, failed
oversight, technological glitches, and public
frustration with this lawhave left very
little to celebrate.
When Obamacare became law, there was
significant disagreement about whether it would
effectively reduce costs or expand coverage. Five
years later, Utahns and people throughout the
country are in total agreement about one
thing:
Obamacare just isnt
working .In fact, by any objective
account, it is an unmitigated disaster.
Since Obamacare became law, skyrocketing
health-care costs have pummeled hardworking
families across the country. Unfortunately,
tax-filing season offers little reprieve. With
theApril 15deadline only weeks away,
thousands of taxpayers are suddenly discovering
that they have to repay a portion of the Advance
Premium Tax Credit theyreceived
under Obamacare.According to
H&amp;R Block, it is expected that more than half
of the tax credits recipients will get a
surprise tax bill averaging about
$530resulting in a roughly 17 percent
decrease in the average tax
refund.Complicating matters more,
around 800,000 individuals on Obamacare received
incorrect tax documents due to an administrative
error, further delaying their ability to file
this tax season.
While the ramifications to taxpayers are
significant, the overall impact on
Americas budget is even more burdensome.
The total cost of Obamacare so far has numbered
in the tens of
billions , and were barely through
the first phases of implementation.
To mark the fifth anniversary of the
Presidents signature legislative
accomplishment,I called a Senate Finance
Committee hearing to look at this
administration's broken promises that cost
taxpayers dearly. You can read my opening
statement
here.
Additionally, my staff has compiled five
factsheets outlining some of Obamacares
biggest problems:
Obamacare Hits Americans
with Higher Premiums for Healthcare
Coverage
Failed Oversight &amp;
Security Safeguards Put Americans
Personal Information at Risk
Obamacare Subsidies Cause
Confusion and Frustration for American
Taxpayers
Five Most Egregious Misuses
of Taxpayer Funds
Administration Unilaterally
Altering Obamacares Flaws
These factsheets explain just a few of the
misguided, poorly defined, and haphazardly
implemented aspects of the Affordable Care Act.
This law is not only
not working for the American people;
it is
actually working against them . I will
continue my quest to repeal and replace this law
with a better alternative. If you would like to

Sincerely,
Orrin Hatch
