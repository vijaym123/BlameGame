No More Bad Trade Deals
Very soon, Congress will be voting on whether or not to Fast Track the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). I will be voting no.
I support fair, open and transparent trade. Unfortunately, Fast Track will not get us there. The Trans-Pacific Partnership gives wealthy corporations even more power, while outsourcing middle class American jobs. It threatens our environment and it puts the food we eat at risk.
To make matters even worse, Fast Track subverts Congressional authority and prevents Congress from providing substantive input on the deal.
I cannot support a bill that endangers American jobs, undermines human rights and threatens food safety.
Thats why Im voting no on Fast Track for the TPP.
