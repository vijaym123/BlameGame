David -- here&rsquo;s the latest:
--
FIRST:
Speaker Boehner came to Colona to collect big checks for my opponent
--
THEN:
A right-wing Super PAC launched a deceptive ad campaign targeting our campaign
--
NOW:
Boehner&rsquo;s in the midst of a
$2,24O,OOO.OO
assault on Illinois Democrats
I&rsquo;d never forgive myself if we didn&rsquo;t do everything in our power to fight back against Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s cash when there was still time. So I&rsquo;m asking:
will you chip in to our Democratic campaign for Illinois before tonight&rsquo;s budget deadline? I could really use your help. Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount &gt;&gt;
In Congress, I&rsquo;m working hard each and every day for Illinois&rsquo; hardworking families -- fighting to protect Medicare and Social Security, grow our economy, and bring good-paying jobs to our district.
But Speaker Boehner&rsquo;s determined to defeat us -- and bring down our
entire
Democratic agenda.
I won&rsquo;t let that happen -- but I can&rsquo;t do it alone. Please chip in before tonight&rsquo;s budget deadline: http://action.cheribustos.com/chip-in
