Update from Congressman Scott Tipton
Dear Friend,
This week, we passed a budget in the House of Representatives that
would grow the economy, provide opportunities for the private sector to
create jobs, achieve balance over the next decade, and strengthen
critical programs like Medicare for current and future generations. The
House budget is a strong starting point that seeks to responsibly
address the drivers of our nation's budget deficits and staggering
$17.6 trillion debt.
Families balance their budgets every day, and yet this simple, critical
practice continues to escape Washington bureaucrats and
tax-and-spend-politicians. It's time Washington joins the American
people in balancing the books, ending reckless spending, and getting
back to the basics. That's what the House budget seeks to do.
Chart courtesy of the House Budget Committee
Highlights of the House budget:
ECONOMIC GROWTH: The House budget slows the rate of federal spending
increases (by 1.7 percent) so that spending does not exceed revenue. It
achieves balance and cuts $5.1 trillion over the next decade, and over
time pays down the $17.6 trillion national debt. This provides
long-term economic certainty, encouraging investment and job creation.
By contrast, the President's budget proposal increases spending, raises
taxes by as much as $1.8 trillion and never balances.
MEDICARE: On the current fiscal path, Medicare will be bankrupt by 2026
according to the non-partisan Medicare Trustees. The House Budget ends
the raid on Medicare under the President's healthcare law.
The House
budget does not change Medicare in any way for current seniors or those
nearing retirement. Beginning in 2024, Medicare would offer additional
plans, some of which would provide premium support for seniors, meaning
that those who are on fixed incomes and in need will receive greater
assistance to meet their healthcare needs and will be able to choose
the plan that works best for them-including the traditional Medicare
fee-for-service plan.
DEFENSE: The House budget ensures that the troops have the tools and
resources they need to defend the nation. Unlike the President's budget
proposal, the House budget responsibly provides the resources to allow
the U.S. military to maintain its strength and support a strong
national security.
HEALTHCARE: The House budget repeals the President's healthcare law and
sets the stage for a patient-centered replacement that ensures all
Americans have access to affordable healthcare.
TAXES: The House budget does not raise taxes. It initiates tax reform,
simplifying the overly complex tax code, closing loopholes, allowing
American families to keep more of their paychecks and small businesses
to invest more in job creation. The President's budget seeks to raise
taxes by as much as $1.8 trillion.

.
We can and should roll up our sleeves and work together to solve
Washington's spending problem to provide economic opportunities for
families to get back to work and for future generations to have the
chance to realize the American Dream. I stand ready to work with my
colleagues to get this done.
Sincerely,
In Case You Missed It
Tipton calls for greater transparency in ESA listing process: During a
House Natural Resources Committee hearing, Congressman Tipton
underscored that federal agencies' refusal to disclose scientific data

preservation efforts. Read more

The Colorado Observer: Transparency lacking in ESA grouse listing: "With
regard to the sage grouse, not only have federal agencies refused to
disclose the scientific data on which they are relying to determine
potential ESA listings, they have failed to even provide preservation
goals to state and local entities already working to effectively
preserve the species despite numerous requests," Tipton said. Read more

Tipton questions Secretaries Jewell and Vilsack during committee
hearings: In the House Agriculture Committee, Congressman Tipton

Update
from
Congressman
Scott
Tipton
Dear
Friend,
This
week,
we
passed
a
budget
in
the
House
of
Representatives
that
would
grow
the
economy,
provide
opportunities
for
the
private
sector
to
create
jobs,
achieve
balance
over
the
next
decade,
and
strengthen
critical
programs
like
Medicare
for
current
and
future
generations.
The
House
budget
is
a
strong
starting
point
that
seeks
to
responsibly
address
the
drivers
of
our
nation&#8217;s
budget
deficits
and
staggering
$17.6
trillion
debt.
Families
balance
their
budgets
every
day,
and
yet
this
simple,
critical
practice
continues
to
escape
Washington
bureaucrats
and
tax-and-spend-politicians.
It&#8217;s
time
Washington
joins
the
American
people
in
balancing
the
books,
ending
reckless
spending,
and
getting
back
to
the
basics.
That&#8217;s
what
the
House
budget
seeks
to
do.
Chart
courtesy
of
the
House
Budget
Committee
Highlights
of
the
House
budget :
ECONOMIC
GROWTH :
The
House
budget
slows
the
rate
of
federal
spending
increases
(by
1.7
percent)
so
that spending
does
not
exceed
revenue.
It
achieves
balance
and
cuts
$5.1
trillion
over
the
next
decade,
and
over
time
pays
down
the
$17.6
trillion
national
debt.
This
provides
long-term
economic
certainty,
encouraging
investment
and
job
creation.
By
contrast,
the
President&#8217;s
budget
proposal
increases
spending,
raises
taxes
by
as
much
as
$1.8
trillion
and
never
balances.
MEDICARE :
On
the
current
fiscal
path,
Medicare
will
be
bankrupt
by
2026
according
to
the
non-partisan
Medicare
Trustees.
The
House
Budget
ends
the
raid
on
Medicare
under
the
President&#8217;s
healthcare
law.
The
House
budget
does
not
change
Medicare
in
any
way
for
current
seniors
or
those
nearing
retirement.
Beginning
in
2024,
Medicare
would
offer
additional
plans,
some
of
which
would
provide
premium
support
for
seniors,
meaning
that
those
who
are
on
fixed
incomes
and
in
need
will
receive
greater
assistance
to
meet
their
healthcare
needs
and
will
be
able
to
choose
the
plan
that
works
best
for
them&#8212;including
the
traditional
Medicare
fee-for-service
plan.
DEFENSE :
The
House
budget
ensures
that
the
troops
have
the
tools
and
resources
they
need
to
defend
the
nation.
Unlike
the
President&#8217;s
budget
proposal,
the
House
budget
responsibly
provides
the
resources
to
allow
the
U.S.
military
to
maintain
its
strength
and
support
a
strong
national
security.
HEALTHCARE :
The
House
budget
repeals
the
President&#8217;s
healthcare
law
and
sets
the
stage
for
a
patient-centered
replacement
that
ensures
all
Americans
have
access
to
affordable
healthcare.
TAXES :
The
House
budget
does
not
raise
taxes.
It
initiates
tax
reform,
simplifying
the
overly
complex
tax
code,
closing
loopholes,
allowing
American
families
to
keep
more
of
their
paychecks
and
small
businesses
to
invest
more
in
job
creation.
The
President&#8217;s
budget
seeks
to
raise
taxes
by
as
much
as
$1.8
trillion.

House
budget

We
can
and
should
roll
up
our
sleeves
and
work
together
to
solve
Washington&#8217;s
spending
problem
to
provide
economic
opportunities
for
families
to
get
back
to
work
and
for
future
generations
to
have
the
chance
to
realize
the
American
Dream.
I
stand
ready
to
work
with
my
colleagues
to
get
this
done.
