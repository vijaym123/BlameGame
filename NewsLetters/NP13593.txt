Restoring Defense Funds;
Cutting the Deficit $23
Billion
The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Bipartisan Budget
Act of 2013 by a vote of 332-94. Over two-thirds of House Republicans
supported the bill to cut the federal deficit by an additional $23
billion while averting severe cuts to Americas military
readiness.
A majority of Texas Republicans supported it, including deficit
hawks
John Culberson
and
Jeb
Hensarling , the former leader of the House conservatives.
BIGGEST BUDGET BUSTER:
OBAMACARE
The biggest budget-buster facing America is
ObamaCare , and its important that any budget agreement not
distract Americas attention from the harm our families, doctors and
local businesses are facing as they are forced to pay more for less health
care under the destructive Affordable Care Act.
PREVENTS
SEVERE CUTS TO
MILITARY
This agreement rebuilds the readiness of our national defense, cuts the
deficit and opens up the Gulf of Mexico
for more energy
development -- all of which are important conservative principles. Im
disappointed that Senate Democrats refused to work with us to begin
saving Social Security and Medicare.
KEEPS 100% OF MANDATORY
SEQUESTER
It also
extends 100% of the mandatory sequester for two additional
years
and preserves 92% of the sequester for discretionary spending, which
caps that budget at a level smaller than the conservative Ryan budget
of 2011. Just as importantly, it blocks Democratic tax increases and
prevents billions of dollars of more emergency unemployment checks
that are no longer called for under the law.
WHICH OF THESE
SAVINGS DO YOU SUPPORT?
The bill cuts
more than it spends. Some of the $85 billion in savings from reforms
to mandatory spending include:
Forcing new federal
government workers to pay a larger share of their retirement
contribution.
Requiring businesses to begin to shoulder more of
the $36 billion unfunded liability in the taxpayer-guaranteed program
that bails out private-sector pension plans.
Closing
loopholes in federal student loan programs
Reducing
fraud in the IRS and Medicaid.
Preventing improper Social
Security payments to prisoners.
WE NEED TO
DEFEND AMERICA
Major General
John Nichols, commander of the Texas National Guard issued this
statement: If the sequester were to play out in 2014 or 2015, the
Department of Defense and the National Guard are concerned about our ability
to defend America. This will help take the edge off that concern and
enable us to maintain more forces keeping our soldiers and airmen
trained and ready to fight."
ObamaCare is Less Popular by the Day
As Americans learn more about what is in the President's health care
insurance law, they like it less and less.Nearly four out of five
insured Americans blame the President's failing health care insurance law
for health insurance problems in a new poll.
Nearly half
polled by
the Associated Press
say
their policies are changing in the new year -- for the worse, not the
better.
69% say their premiums are rising
and
59% say their deductibles and copayments are going
up .
I continue to be concerned about the coverage
gap. Millions of Americans have had their policies cancelled -- yet
only hundreds of thousands have 'enrolled' in any of the exchange plans.
When
an
AP poll finds
that over 60 percent of the people who have tried to enroll have
encountered problems , that doesn't bode well for the coverage
gap not dramatically affecting millions of Americans on New Year's
Day.
This as the
Washington Post
revealed over the weekend that the
enrollments of "close to 15,000
HealthCare.gov
shoppers were not initially transmitted to the insurance
plans they selected " and
Politifact
named "If you like your health care plan, you
can keep it" their 2013 Lie of the Year .
Continue to share
your ObamaCare
stories with me so I know how this law is affecting your
family.
