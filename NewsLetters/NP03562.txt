Congressmen Massie and Bridenstine Demand Action
WASHINGTON, D.C.
- Congressmen Thomas Massie and Jim Bridenstine issued the following statement:
According to the Congressional Record, Congressmen Daniel Webster and Richard Nugent, Members who voted against John Boehner as Speaker of the House, have been kicked off the Rules Committee.
This retribution compromises the ability of Members of Congress to faithfully represent their constituents and subverts our representative democracy.
The Speaker must immediately reinstate these Members.
No Member should be punished for voting according to his or her conscience.
We expect other Members of the House of Representatives to condemn this act of political retribution.
