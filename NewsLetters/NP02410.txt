President Obama Vetoes Keystone XL Pipeline
This week I was disappointed in the president's decision to block legislation that would authorize the creation of more than 40,000 jobs and help make America more energy independent. Its unfortunate that despite years of scientific studies, approval from his own State Department, the urging of business and labor, and the support of members on both sides of the aisle, the president chose to play politics instead by vetoing the Keystone XL pipeline.
However, my colleagues in the House and the Senate will continue to push to authorize the construction of this pipeline. Let me know if you think the president should sign this legislation by
taking this YES or NO survey.
Davis Votes to Help Middle Class Americans Save for College
Last week, the House passed H.R. 529, a bill to expand, modernize, and strengthen 529 college savings plans, which are used by millions of middle class Americans.
As a parent who has used a 529 Savings Plan, I know how important they are to middle class families who are worried about paying for their children's education. By expanding and modernizing these plans, we can help more families prepare for the future.
Earlier this year, President Obama's budget called for taxing new accounts making them less effective. At a time when the middle class continue to see their budgets squeezed, we should come together to promote policies that help Americans save, not ones that limit them. I hope the president will join us in supporting greater opportunities for the middle class.

Ceremony Commemorating Lincoln's 2nd Inaugural at U.S. Capitol
On March 4th, I will co-host, along with the Illinois State Society (ISS) and the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Foundation (ALBF), a ceremony and reception in Statuary Hall, the room that served as the U.S. House of Representatives chamber when Lincoln served in Congress.
If you're in DC next week, join us by emailing lincoln.event2015@gmail.com.
As the representative of the 13th District, which includes part of the district Abraham Lincoln represented in Congress as well his home and resting place in Springfield, Illinois, I am honored to sponsor this event to recognize the life and legacy of our countrys greatest president. President Lincolns ability to unite rather than divide is the type of leadership our country needs and a quality I strive to emulate everyday as a member of Congress.
