Saving American Workers
Dear Friends,
One of the many prongs of Obamacare that threatens Wyoming workers is that it mandates that all businesses with 50 or more full- time employees provide healthcare for all of them. It also cuts the hours of full-time employment from 40 hours a week to 30. If the businesses are unable to pay for the healthcare, they will be fined which could force them out of business. The only option for businesses is to cut employee hours to below 30 hours a week or reduce employee numbers. It is estimated that around 2.6 million workers will face loss of wages, work hours and even jobs.
To fight this Obamacare attack on jobs, we in the U.S. House on Thursday passed with a bi-partisan majority
H.R. 2575: the Save the American Workers Act . This would restore the definition of a full-time job to 40 hours a week, which will prevent the need for smaller businesses to choose between these drastic cuts of hours and wages or bankruptcy.
Obamacare is still bad for jobs and wages in Wyoming and I will continue to fight to repeal it and stem the damage it has done and will do to our nation. Please
share your thoughts and concerns
as I continue working for Wyoming.
Sincerely,
Join the conversation! Stay connected to me through

I look forward to hearing from you soon!
