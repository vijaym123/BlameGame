Friend -
Wanted to provide you with a brief roundup of some bills that are moving forward in the House, that I think you would be interested in:
Making life a little easier for our veterans . Currently, only retired or medically discharged veterans receive an ID card from the VA. Im supporting a bill (the Veterans ID Card Act,
H.R. 91 ) to direct the VA to provide ID cards to any honorably discharged veteran who requests one. This would allow veterans to utilize goods, services, and activities offered by public and private institutions to those who demonstrate proof of military service
without having to always carry their official DD-214 discharge papers, which is both inconvenient and impractical.
Supporting our military families . The Military Spouse Job Continuity Act is being introduced this week to help military spouses transition more easily into new jobs. This act will allow for an income tax credit when a military move forces military spouses to apply for a new state license or certification.
Caring for disabled heroes.
I am supporting the Disabled Veterans Tax Termination Act ( H.R. 333 ), which amends Title 10 of the United States Code to permit retired members of the Armed Forces who have a service-connected disability rated less than 50%, to receive both retired pay and veterans disability compensation. It also extends eligibility for concurrent payment to Chapter 61 disability retirees with less than 20 years of service.
Supporting Vietnam veterans . I cosponsored the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act ( H.R. 969 ) to extend VA agent orange exposure coverage for qualifying Vietnam Navy Veterans, thereby lifting the burden from individual veterans to prove direct exposure to agent orange (which is nearly impossible due to lack of record keeping and the inability to know the precise location of toxins from air and ground water runoff).
Working to prevent suicides among veterans . I voted to support the Clay Hunt Act ( H.R. 203 ) to direct the VA to provide annual evaluations of mental healthcare and suicide prevention programs. It also requires a pilot program for loan repayment for psychiatrists who agree to serve in the Veterans Health Administration of the VA. This act passed both the House and the Senate, and was signed into law by the President.
I will continue to work on behalf of our men and women in uniform, our veterans, and their families. Because doing everything we can to support them, is the least we can do.
Yours in service,
Randy
