CONSTITUENT SERVICES
VISITING DC
June 12, 2015
This week, I pressed the Veterans Administration about a
long standing problem with an important new clinic in Wilmington that has
resulted in more delays for our Veterans needing care. Both Fox
Wilmington and
WECT
reported on the ongoing water
problem at the Wilmington VA clinic that has caused VA to postpone major
services, like dental, urology, and GI, indefinitely. I want to let you
know that Senator Tillis and I are both intervening to make sure VA
makes any fixes to clinic quickly and ensures that any veterans who
need medical in the meantime receive ready access to non-VA care in the
community. Veterans should not have to drive long distances to another
VA clinic if it can be taken care of locally. As always, if you need
help with VA or would like to share any concerns, please do not
hesitate to
call
or
email
my
office.
Fox Wilmington:
Burr and Tillis investigates Wilmington VA clinic's
water woes
The Senate focused on the Fiscal Year 2016
National Defense Authorization Act, also known as the NDAA, this week.
The NDAA funds our countrys military and,
despite what
Senate Democrats have said , is an important piece of legislation
that is needed to support our troopsas well as our bases all over
North Carolina.
The recent cyber breach at the Office of
Personnel Management was a serious attack on our government and we
cannot continue to have citizens personal information needlessly exposed
to foreign adversaries and criminals.As a reminder, Ive sponsored the
Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act
which
would help our companies and government share information about these
attacks with each other. In an overwhelmingly bipartisan Committee vote of
14-1, the Intel Committee recognized the extreme threat posed by our
adversaries who, in addition to the OPM breach, have stolen hundreds
of millions of Americans personal information in the last year alone,
swiped intellectual property, and conducted attacks on our
agencies.
Not only did my cybersecurity bill propose a solution to
help address these threats, it did so in a way that works to ensure
the personal privacy of all Americans. We can no longer simply watch
Americans personal information continue to be compromised.
Unfortunately, a few in the Senate object to this protective measure, allowing
foreign adversaries and international criminals to continue to steal
Americans personal information and intrude on their privacy.
The
American people and their data deserve protection from hackers --
perhaps when Senators have their own information stolen, they'll react
differently.
USA Today had a piece on Tuesday, highlighting how
my bill would help thwart hackers. You can read it
here .
On Wednesday, I joined Senator Scott and 21 other
Senators in a letter to the Director of the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau (CFPB) expressing concern over the security of Americans
financial information that the CFPB is collecting
information like
when you might overdraft from your bank account or information on the
cars you own.
From the letter: While [the IRS and OPM]
investigations remain ongoing, we believe that now is a critical time to
examine the measures other government agencies take to secure personal
data they collect on Americans. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB has
begun accumulating loan-level data covering approximately 80% of the
credit card marketplacehundreds of millions of credit card accountsWe
are gravely concerned by the CFPB's inability to confirm that the
massive amount of data it collects and stores could not be
reverse-engineered and traced back to one of our constituents Our constituents have
an absolute right to the security of their personal information.
Read the letter in full

Did you see
WBTVs story on the Social Security Administration
paying out millions to people who hadalready passed away ? This type
of waste of taxpayers hard earned money is intolerable. I will be
asking serious questions about how this happened and I will keep asking
hard questions of our agencies. Read the story
here .
Finally, have you ever run into a friend wearing the same
outfit? Senator Tillis and I did this week! Please
visit his Facebook page
and let him know that I clearly wore it
better.
Sincerely,
Richard Burr
