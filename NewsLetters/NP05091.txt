Don&rsquo;t worry &ndash; this email isn&rsquo;t asking for money.
We need something MUCH more important: your voice. According to our records, you live in zip code 60659. That means you&rsquo;re right in the middle of one of our most competitive Congressional races! (if you&rsquo;ve turned on your TV recently, you probably didn&rsquo;t need us to tell you that)
This race is going to be close. Honestly, it could go either way. But we know we can pull off a big Democratic victory if we can get enough Obama voters out to the polls on November 4th.
That&rsquo;s where you come in. We have 31 volunteer shifts we&rsquo;re hoping to fill before Friday. David -- can you help us Get Out the Vote in the final 4 days before Election Day?
Never volunteered before? No problem! It&rsquo;s easy, it&rsquo;s fun, and it&rsquo;s a great chance to get out and reconnect with your friends and neighbors.
And don&rsquo;t worry -- we&rsquo;ve already done the heavy lifting. Across the country, we've already reached over 22 million voters. We just need your help to give Democratic voters one last reminder before Election Day. Click here to let us know you can join us for a few hours during the final few days.
Once you sign-up, a local field organizer with get in touch to provide all the details and get you started.
We&rsquo;ve come so far, and we&rsquo;re so close.
Let&rsquo;s finish strong!
