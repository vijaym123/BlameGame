Preventing Executive
Overreach
As Americans, we understand that there will be
legitimate disagreements when Congress and the president are engaged in
debate over solutions to the challenges facing our nation. But, we also
believe that those discussions should be had with a healthy respect for
and adherence to the rule of law and the constitutional duties that
those of us who have the honor to serve have sworn an oath to
uphold.
Sadly, President Obama has
chosen to abandon the legitimate checks and balances of our democracy by
directly contravening the immigration laws of this land. Back in August
before he announced his most recent executive amnesty plan
House
Republicans voted to prohibit the presidents overreach. This past
week, the House of Representatives used its next tool within our
legislative authority by passing the
Preventing Executive Overreach on
Immigration Act . This legislation states unequivocally that the
Executive Branch does not have the authority, and should not be
allowed, to trample on the Constitution.
We also learned on Wednesday that 17 states, including Georgia,
have filed a lawsuit against the Obama Administrations executive
actions. This is important because elected officials at both the federal
and state level must pursue realistic avenues to hold the president
accountable. We have an obligation to protect and defend the rule of law
enshrined in our Constitution and with it the voices of the American
people we represent.
So
long as the president and his allies in Congress continue to put their
executive amnesty ahead of fidelity to the rule of law, we must and we
will continue to seek to hold the administration
accountable.
