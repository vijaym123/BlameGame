We&rsquo;re making history, David: On New Year&rsquo;s Eve 2013, President Obama asked for your help to reach
1,OOO,OOO
grassroots donations for the year. (And we did it with just hours to spare!!!) But now we&rsquo;re within striking distance of breaking a new record:
3,OOO,OOO
online donations to elect Democrats in this election!!!
We think we can break this record tonight -- but we need your help. If we want to make history&hellip; if we want to leave Boehner defeated on Election Day, we need your immediate support.
David Johnson Suggested Gift: $5.OO
