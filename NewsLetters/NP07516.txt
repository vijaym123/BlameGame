Dear
Friends,
Education opens doors. A diploma or degree brings
with it the promise of a better future, better wages, and a
better quality of life. Without a quality education, the
possibilities of life are truly limited, not limitless. And in the House
of Representatives, were taking action to ensure that every
American has access to a quality education and an education
thats affordable.
On Thursday, the House passed two bills that
would make financing higher education easier and more
understandable:
H.R. 4984, the Empowering Students through
Enhanced Financial Counseling Act, which would provide enhanced counseling
for all students receiving federal financial aid. This legislation would
help promote financial literacy and put students on a path toward
paying off their student loans. I am a cosponsor of this
bill.
H.R. 3393, the Student and Family Tax Simplification Act, which
would make permanent the American Opportunity Tax Credit. The credit
allows eligible students to write off a portion of their tuition and
related educational expenses.
By investing in
education, we invest in our nations future. We invest
in growing our nations economy, and we invest in generations yet to
come.
I spoke on the House floor this week about the
importance of investing in education and creating education policies that
work for students and families.

HUMAN
TRAFFICKING
As you may remember, I held a roundtable in Kanawha
County in May to discuss ways to prevent and respond to human
trafficking. My roundtable came just days after the House had passed a series
of bills to strengthen protections against human trafficking. I'm
pleased to announce that the House has passed another series of bills this
week to help victims of human trafficking and stop this terrible
crime:
H.R. 5081, the Strengthening Child Welfare
Response to Trafficking Act
H.R. 5076, the Enhancing
Services for Runaway and Homeless Victims of Youth Trafficking
Act
H.R. 4980, the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening
Families Act
H.R. 5135, the Human Trafficking Prevention,
Intervention, and Recovery Act
H.R. 5116, the Human
Trafficking Detection Act
H.R. 4449, the Human Trafficking
Prevention Act
H.R. 2283, the Human Trafficking
Prioritization Act
H.R. 5111, To Improve the Response to
Victims of Child Sex Trafficking
All of us can give a
voice to those whose voices have been silenced by the violence and
indignity of human trafficking. I am proud to stand up for our most
vulnerable and say no more to human trafficking.
Thank you for reading my
weekly
e-newsletter, and as always, you can join in the
conversation on
Facebook
and
Twitter .
Sincerely,
