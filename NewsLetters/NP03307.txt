Friends,
As Representative of North Carolinas Eighth Congressional
District, one of my top priorities is listening to your concerns and
needs and being a voice for our districts priorities in
Washington.
Since being sworn into office last week, my colleagues in the
Republican-controlled Congress and I have taken critical steps to stop the
Presidents executive action on immigration and pursue conservative
policies that promote job creation and move our economy forward.
We hope the President will work with us on your priorities
from
expanding domestic energy production, to simplifying the tax code,
strengthening border security and promoting job creation. We will also fight
to stop unilateral executive actions and undo the harm of job-killing
policies.
We will deliver to the American people what they
voted for
a smaller, more limited government that is effective,
efficient and
accountable.
As we begin the 114th Congress, it's
important that I continue to hear directly from our community.
I
deeply value your input and feedback, and I will continue to listen to
your concerns and work as hard as I can to represent our shared
priorities. Rest assured,
I will continue to stand on the values our
community holds dear as I fight to change the direction of our
country
and advance solutions that rein in big government, empower
businesses to create jobs and return control back to you and your
families.
Sincerely,
Richard Hudson
Member of Congress
