Dear Friend:
Recently, President Obama and his administration announced they have reached a deal to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons; however, I have grave concerns that this deal falls short and will do the exact opposite. Providing sanction relief to Iran, who has a history of dishonoring its international obligations, without receiving hard concessions from them is a major concern. This is why I believe any deal must stop Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and should be approved by Congress.
But, I want your input.
Take this one-question survey:
Do you believe Congress should need to approve any nuclear deal reached with Iran?
As always, please feel free to
email me
if you would like to share your opinion in greater detail.
Thank you very much for your time.
Sincerely,
Rodney Davis
Member of Congress
