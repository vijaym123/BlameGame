Dear Friend,
Remember when you were a kid, and there was that one house that gave away Halloween candy no one ever wanted? Sometimes, when I look at the GOP&rsquo;s agenda, I think about that house --
who actually wants this stuff? Trick-or-treaters are hitting the streets soon, but our GOTV teams are already knocking on doors.
They&rsquo;re working hard to make sure that the &ldquo;houses&rdquo; of Congress aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;haunted&rdquo; by Republicans&rsquo; anti-middle class plans. Election day is just a few days after Halloween, but we control whether we&rsquo;ll get a trick or a treat -- give $5 today to help our field teams get out the vote.

Republicans are getting into the Halloween spirit, trying to dress up the same tired ideas in shiny new costumes. They&rsquo;re not fooling anyone.
We know that the Republicans stand for special interest billionaires rather than middle class families. We know that a GOP-controlled Senate would mean two more wasted years of legislative gridlock. And we know what we need to do to win here in Massachusetts. Halloween&rsquo;s spooky, but Republicans&rsquo; policies are downright scary. Chip in $5 and support our efforts to keep Massachusetts&rsquo; Senate seat blue.
Thanks, and have a happy and safe Halloween.
Ed
P.S. Boo!
