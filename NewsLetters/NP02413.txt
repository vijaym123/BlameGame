Rep. Bob Goodlatte
VIDEO: Goodlatte Testifies Before House Budget Cmte.
On Wednesday, I
testified before the House Budget Committee
as
a part of
the Members' Day Hearing, an opportunity for Members of the
House of Representatives to testify before the Committee on their
suggested policies and
priorities for the Fiscal Year 2016 budget. I testified that a balanced budget and common sense tax reform are greatly needed for America to have a
healthy economy.
Weekly Column: ISIS in America
With
increasing regularity, Americans are bearing witness to the depravity
of terrorists
claiming the mantle of &quot;The Islamic State of Iraq and
Syria&quot; or ISIS, but also sometimes referred to as ISIL. Relatively
unknown to many
in America just a few years ago, ISIS relishes in their
own barbarity with videos depicting the murders of prisoners. As we have
seen recently in
Denmark, France, Australia, Canada, the United
Kingdom, and Germany, these terrorists are intent on destroying our way
of life.
Americans are not mere observers of ISIS's
atrocities. Our people
and our homeland are intimate parts of their
plans. The
organization's leadership has called for attacks on America
and
the rest of the West. They have solicited young people
to
renounce their lives and join them. Unfortunately, even here
in
America these calls have found receptive ears. FBI Director
James
Comey has disclosed that the Bureau is investigating
suspected
supporters of ISIS in every U.S. state.
As these threats evolve domestically, so do the
challenges our
intelligence and law enforcement officials face in
thwarting
violent terrorists and those who pledge allegiance to them
here
in the United States. Just a few days ago, the House
Judiciary
Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and
Investigations
Subcommittee
held a hearing on ISIS in America . At the hearing,
members had the opportunity to further examine domestic
terrorism, in particular the increasing threat posed by the
Islamic State through the assassination of American captives,
recruitment of American citizens, self-radicalization, and
domestic terror plots.
Regardless of whether these individuals make their way to Syria
or are radicalized in front of a computer in the U.S., the
threats they present are very real. Whether it be military force
or counter-terrorism efforts in the U.S., it is important
Congress know how to best ensure that our country is prepared to
stop these threats. As Congress considers the way forward in
combating ISIS, we must remain vigilant against this real threat
so that we protect Americans and our national security. The
barbaric actions of ISIS reinforce how imperative it is that the
United States continues our mission, in close cooperation with
our allies, to dismantle and destroy ISIS.
