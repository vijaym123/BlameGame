Friends,
Fifty years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson erased
decades of deeply entrenched segregation with the simple stroke of a
pen. The landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed discrimination
based on race, religion, sex or national origin and paved the way for a
more just America.
Getting there wasnt
easy. Many lives were lost and injustices
suffered.
Martin Luther King, Jr., led us to believe in his
dream of equality, and preached that the content of our character matters
more than the color of our
skin.
Our nation owes a debt of gratitude to the men and women -- many
whose names and faces we may not even know -- who worked to advance the
cause of equality and of human
rights.
We cannot take their sacrifice for granted, nor forgot these
gains can easily be reversed.
The
U.S. Supreme Court last summer invalidated a key portion of the 1965
Voting Rights Act. Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act requires states
with a history of discriminatory voting practices to pre-clear any
changes to their voting laws with the federal government or courts. The
Supreme Court struck down Section 4, which is the formula used to
determine which states are subject to
preclearance.
Now that Section 4 has been deemed unconstitutional,
we have seen a reemergence in laws that block access to the ballot
box.
I support a legislative fix
that would ensure that all eligible voters have a chance to make their
voices heard on Election Day. I am also a co-sponsor of the Voter
Empowerment Act of 2013, which requires states to offer online voter
registration.
America cannot live up to her
potential if any of her citizens are denied access to the ballot box.
Fair and free elections are at the heart of our democracy. Lets
protect it.
Sincerely,
Eliot L.
Engel
MEMBER OF CONGRESS
