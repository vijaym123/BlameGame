Time to Shrink the Federal Workforce
Dear Friends,
This week I joined Rep. Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina in introducing
the Federal Workforce Reduction Through Attrition Act .
This bill is designed to cut the federal workforce by 10% by limiting new hires to one new employee for every three that retire or leave service and ensures that the government isnt simply backfilled with contractors.
There are limited exceptions to the legislation for a state of war, or national emergencies, but otherwise if the limits are not followed this bill would institute a hiring freeze.
It was previously estimated that this bill will save $35 billion over five years.
We see businesses and local governments all across America using this attrition method to cut back on their employees without having to force anyone out of a job.
With a national debt now over $18 trillion I think it is high time that the federal government did the same and cutback to a workforce the American people can actually afford.
Please
