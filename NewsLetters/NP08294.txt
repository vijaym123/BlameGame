Dear David,
This week, we recognize Independence Day and all the freedoms every American should enjoy. It&rsquo;s a wonderful time of year to gather with family and friends, enjoy a parade, or a patriotic display of fireworks, and reflect on our great nation.
As you celebrate how much we have accomplished as Americans, be mindful that we must continue to work together to make certain everyone has an opportunity to achieve the American Dream.
This work includes guaranteeing a livable wage for all workers, protecting our seniors and veterans, building a school infrastructure that works for all students, making college affordable, and ensuring everyone has access to high-quality health care.
Our country was founded on the tenet that we have the basic right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I believe, if we work together, we can make sure American principles are protected for all.
Sincerely,
Andr&eacute;

Constituent Corner: Clearing Up an Accounting Error
We like to highlight stories where our office was able to help a constituent successfully resolve an issue with the federal government. This week, we want to share a story about an accounting error that could have become a big headache for a constituent named Dennis.
In 2006, Dennis, a veteran and lifelong federal employee, received a check from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for his pension from the U.S. Postal Service. Dennis was working for another federal agency and could not accept the funds at the time, so he promptly returned the check for roughly $59,000. When he retired from federal service in 2013, OPM charged him for the amount of the erroneous check. We were able to work with OPM to verify that Dennis had never cashed the check, and his pension payments will be returned to their original amount. He will also receive a check that will include the amount previously withheld as payment toward the erroneous payment.
