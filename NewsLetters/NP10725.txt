Dear
David,
Today is
Equal Pay Day
a day that symbolizes when, more than three months
into the year, womens wages finally catch up to what men were paid in
the previous year.
Throughout my career, Ive fought to
realize the promise of equal pay for equal work
because when women
succeed, America succeeds.
Unfortunately, women continue to
face too many challenges
from lack of paid sick leave, to the
rising costs of child care.
Thats why, together with President Obama
and my Democratic colleagues, I am fighting to advance legislation
and realize the promise of equal pay for equal work, paid sick leave for
all working parents, and affordable child care for every American
family.
When President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act into
law in 1963, women were earning just 59 cents for every dollar earned
by men. Today, women on average make 77 cents for every dollar earned
by men, amounting to a yearly gap of $11,607 between full-time working
men and women. This is progress- but not nearly enough.
As
Chairwoman of the Rules Committee in 2009, I brought the Lilly
Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to the House Floor and joined my Democratic colleagues
in voting it into law because it restores the right of women to
challenge unfair pay in court.
Today, Im fighting to pass the
Paycheck Fairness Act , a bill to update and
strengthen the Equal Pay Act so that women dont fall victims to legal
loopholes and underhanded tricks by those who seek to pay them less than a
fair and equal wage.
Equal pay is not simply a womens
issue
its a family issue.
Families increasingly rely on womens
wages to make ends meet, and with less take-home pay women have less
for the everyday needs of their families
groceries, rent, child care,
doctors visits.
Its time that we finish the work begun by
President Kennedy 51 years ago.
Let us level the playing field
for Americas women, and ensure that every American receives equal pay
for equal work.
Sincerely,
Tell A Friend
