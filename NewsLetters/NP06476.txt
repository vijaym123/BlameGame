Responds to President's Speech on ISIS Strategy
I will support strong and resolute action to
destroy the growing threat that ISIS and global terrorism represent to
America.
Tonight's speech was a necessary step in describing
those threats and stating that America's goal is the destruction of ISIS.
It is crucial that President Obama and the American public
remain totally committed to achieving that goal.
I will review the
presidents plan carefully in the coming days.

I will protect free speech, not incumbents'
seats
This week the Senate is taking
up political votes to help protect Harry Reids vulnerable Senate
Democrats. Forty-six Senate Democrats have proposed Senate Joint Resolution
19, a measure to essentially repeal the First Amendment. The
constitutional amendment is designed to energize the left wing base of the
Democrat party, and so far it is working. Read more

Victims of
Government
Sen. Johnson
strongly believes that the root cause of America's social and economic
problems lies in the excessive laws, rules and regulations that constitute
the government's intrusion in our lives. If you have had, or are
currently having, issues dealing with the federal agencies that mandate
these restrictions, we would like to hear your story and work with you
to resolve the issues. Share your story with Ron's professional staff
by emailing us at
VictimsofGovernment@ronjohnson.senate.gov .
