Friends,
I'm looking forward to hearing directly from our
seniors about the issues they are facing during our 7th District Seniors
Telephone Town Hall Meeting this Monday, May 5.
The LIVE
Telephone Town Hall will begin at 11:00 AM.
We will discuss Medicare
and Social Security, veteran benefits, and I'll answer questions about
these programs.
To ensure your household is called, please fill out
THIS sign up form .
If you know of any senior
citizens that may be interested in this event, please forward this invitation
along.
Thank
you and have a great day.
