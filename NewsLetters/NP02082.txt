ISSUES
LEGISLATION
March 22, 2015
Dear
David,
This week, the House Budget Committee
released its budget . Standing in stark contrast to the
Presidents proposal, our plan balances the budget over ten years without
raising taxes, fully repeals Obamacare, boosts defense spending above the
Presidents levels, cuts waste, and implements reforms to the regulatory
system to improve transparency, efficiency and accountability. The
House is expected to vote on the budget this upcoming week. Stay tuned
for more details and, in the meantime,
click here to learn more .
Below are some recent
highlights from both DC and the North State. To learn about how I can serve
you and to follow me throughout the week, please visit

Sincerely,
Rep. LaMalfa questions National Park
Service Director Jonathan Jarvis on the proposed entry fee increases. To

This past week during the House Natural Resources
Subcommittee hearing on Federal Lands, I questioned National Park Service
(NPS) Director Jonathan Jarvis on the proposed entry fee increases at many
National Park locations. The proposed fee increases at Lassen
National Park would be dramatic. Many users would face a fee increase of 300%
and the cost to merely drive a vehicle into the park would jump from
$10 to $25. I urged Director Jarvis to withdraw these steep fee
increases, which will be a significant turn-off for folks taking
"stay-cations" and enjoying our parks in this tough economy. To view my comments
in the hearing, please

Rep. LaMalfa meets with
Paul Zingg, President of Cal State University Chico, Taylor Herron,
President of the Associated Students, Peter Smits, Interim
Vice-President for University Advancement, and Susan Anderson, Assistant
Vice-President for Alumni Affairs and Parent Relations to discuss federal
policies to support Cal State Universities and strengthen higher education
in the North
State.
The House passed several common sense bills last week to
increase transparency and accountability in federal regulatory decision
making.
H.R. 1030 , the Secret
Science Reform Act, requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to
use publically available studies and data when proposing, finalizing, or
disseminating regulations.
H.R.
1029 , the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2015, restores the
independence of the Science Advisory Board, which provides scientific
advice to the EPA. The measure requires the Board to independently
provide that advice, and increases public participation in the process.
The EPA should be able to back up their regulatory decisions with
unbiased scientific advice from studies and data that Americans and
independent scientists can actually read, access, and analyze -- not
un-vetted scientific conclusions kept behind closed
doors.
