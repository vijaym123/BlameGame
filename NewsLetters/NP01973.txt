Through his role as Ranking Member on the House Appropriations
Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and Science and the Fattah Neuroscience
Initiative, Congressman Fattah has fought for increased federal funding
for neuroscience as a means of discovering breakthrough treatments and
cures for brain-related diseases and disorders, including autism,
stroke, Alzheimer's, and other dementias. As part of this ongoing effort,
Congressman Fattah has invited Ron Suskind and a panelist of experts to
talk about innovation and the future of Autism Spectrum Disorder
(ASD) care.
Researchers at
MIT, Cambridge, and Yale have come together to collaborate over a new
way to address autism called Affinity Therapy" that uses the childs
own interests to stimulate social development. The idea behind this
study has a unique source; it was seeded by Ron Suskind, the father of an
autistic child whose 20-year journey together illustrates the
incredible dedication and understanding many parents face in finding ways to
connect. His experience was translated into an international research
collaboration that
is being shaped into improved therapies,
educational models, augmentative devices, and outcomes for those with
ASD.
Join us for the
evening as we give the stage to Ron, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist
and bestselling author, to explain the development of Affinity
Therapy. Youll have the opportunity to learn more about what you can do as
a scientist, family member, or caregiver to improve the lives of those
affected by ASD.
