Dear Friend, The Supreme Court has once again done damage to women&rsquo;s health, to our constitutional rights, and to our democracy.
In the
Hobby Lobby
case, the Court&rsquo;s conservative majority held that closely held corporations are entitled to some of the same religious rights as people. That means corporations can decide whether or not birth control is covered in the health plans of female employees.
Corporations are not people,
period . A bosses&rsquo; religious views should not trump your doctor&rsquo;s medical opinion.
And if we lose control of the Senate this year, there&rsquo;s no chance of nominating Supreme Court Justices who will roll back this terrible decision.
Control of the Senate is on the line this year. If we lose our majority in the Senate, we run the risk of further entrenching the Court&rsquo;s conservative majority --
can you spare $5 to help our campaign stay strong and prevent another
Hobby Lobby ?
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was right -- the Court has ventured into a minefield, and in the process, they&rsquo;ve done more to restrict women&rsquo;s access to reproductive health than at any time since before
Roe v. Wade.
And with the
Hobby Lobby
decision, the Supreme Court has left open the possibility that closely-held corporations can object to any number of life-saving treatments on religious grounds.
We cannot afford to lose the Senate this year -- not with a Supreme Court like this.
Make a $5 contribution and help keep the Senate blue, so we can fix the problems the Court has created.
Thank you.
