Energy Hearing Updates

This week in
Washington, Congressman Doug Lamborn has taken part in two very important
hearings.
House Veterans Affairs Committee Hearing on the VA Claims
Backlog

The hearing looked at the strategies VA has used to meet
the 2015 goal as well as opportunities that may exist for abuse and
deviation from the mission of the Veterans Benefits Administration,
which is to provide benefits and services to veterans and their families
in a responsive, timely and compassionate
manner.

House Energy and Mineral
Resources Subcommittee Hearing on the Helium Stewardship
Act
Helium is essential to our
21st century economy.
Its needed to manufacture computer chips
and fiber optic cables, is used by hospitals for life-saving medical
tests like an MRI, and is critical to national defense efforts.
This important public law protects our economy from severe supply
disruptions, implements reforms to ensure greater return for taxpayers, and
promotes the development of alternative domestic helium
resources.
The goal of what we are
calling Helium II is to secure and encourage future production of
domestic helium, ensure helium producers have the regulatory certainty they
need to explore for and produce helium on federal lands and
facilitate a private domestic market for U.S. helium.
This proposed
legislation will create a federal leasing program for helium on federal
lands and ensure a secure supply of domestic helium for national defense,
federal researchers and other industries that depend on helium for
their business."
