Dear Friend,
This week was an in-district work week, giving me a chance to spend
time away from Washington and with the good people of Missouri's Fourth
Congressional District. I visited several places, meeting some of the
folks who make our district a special place in which to live and work.
A tour of Harleman Manufacturing was one of the highlights of a stop in
El Dorado Springs. Harleman and its staff of 16 employees make diggers,
augers, and tree saws for personal and commercial use.
Harleman Manufacturing owner Ron Harleman gives Congresswoman Hartzler
a tour of the plant
Owner Ron Harleman's primary customers are utilities / energy companies
and farms. But the company proved its worth after an inch of ice coated
the copper weld conductor lines in southeastern Kansas in December of
2007. Hundreds of poles snapped as the weight of the ice stretched
lines to the limit. The electric cooperative for the area invested in
auger, pole-setting and drilling attachments from Harleman to restore
what had been damaged in the ice storm. Nobody wants to see electric
utility equipment damaged by severe weather, but we can be pleased that
this Fourth District company was able to leap into action and come to
the aid of our neighbors in Kansas when the severe weather hit.
While in El Dorado Springs, I also visited Cedar County Memorial
Hospital. Cedar County Memorial provides critical care service to the
citizens of the region. I was impressed with the beautiful facility and
caring staff which provides cutting edge health care including CT
scans, digital mammography, physical and occupational therapy, a sleep
lab, and a special senior citizens unit known as Senior Life Solutions
which addresses mental health issues. Cedar County Memorial even has an
indoor swimming pool for therapy and water aerobics classes and is used
on a daily basis. The people of Cedar County are blessed to have this
facility in their community.
I am supportive of our rural hospitals and am doing what I can to
support the funding they need. With the changes due to Obamacare it is
becoming increasingly challenging to provide healthcare in local
communities. Rest assured, I will continue to support adequate funding
for healthcare while also advancing reforms needed to reduce the cost
of care and increase access for all.
Later, in Vernon County, I visited Deerfield Energy, a plant that
employs 70 people and receives 80-85 truckloads of soybeans every day.
It was interesting to witness the process that begins with the crushing
of the raw soybeans and ends with a finished biodiesel product. As I
have said on many occasions, one of the greatest pleasures of my job as
a representative of the people of Missouri's Fourth District is to
visit with the hardworking citizens who make this country work . and to
take their common sense ideas back to Washington.
I also had an opportunity this week to visit one of the great schools
in our district, touring Butler High School in Bates County and meeting
with Leslie Hedrick and students of her American Government class.
Congresswoman Hartzler speaks to students at Butler High School
As a former school teacher, I enjoy talking to students and listening
to what's on their minds as they prepare for future educational
opportunities and careers. With a great deal of attention being paid to
final exams and graduation preparation this is a busy time in high
schools across our state and I thank the administrators, staff, and
students of Butler High School for taking the time to allow me to visit.
Finally, I want to share with you an award I recently received while in
D.C. from the International Foodservice Distributors Association. The
2014 Thomas Jefferson Award honors a legislator's commitment to free
enterprise based on efforts to increase economic opportunity and to
reduce government regulation. This is needed to create more jobs and
enable all to pursue the American Dream.
Congresswoman Hartzler is presented the Thomas Jefferson Award
By Jim Tracy, Senior Vice President, Dot Foods (l) and IFDA
Board Chair Tom Zatina, President, McLane Foodservice (r)
I was pleased to accept the award on behalf of all our citizens who
support free enterprise and who want to see our overreaching government
get out of the way.
Have a great week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler
Member of Congress

Dear

of

With

attention
being
paid

preparation
this
is
a
busy
time
in
high

I
thank
the
administrators,

students
of
Butler

for
taking
the
time
to
allow
me
to
visit.
Finally,
I

you
an
