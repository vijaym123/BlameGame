Danny,
First of all, thank you. After you saw the news about Karl Rove's $900,000 ad buy, you stepped up and helped us raise over $5,000. I'm grateful.
That money helped us produce our first ad - now, we need another $10,000 this week in order to get it up and running. Click here to watch our ad - then give $5, $10, or whatever you can to help us fight back against the Ose-Rove money machine. secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/fightbackagainstkarlrove
We won't be able to match their $900,000 television ad buy, but that's ok. Our message is much more powerful than theirs. Doug Ose may have Karl Rove's money - but I have supporters like you.Click here now to help us spread our message and get our ad running. secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/fightbackagainstkarlrove
Thank you - talk again soon.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
Congressman, California's 7th District
PS - It's unheard of for outside attack ads to be up and running this early - but starting tomorrow, that's what we're facing. Karl Rove's money machine will be spreading lies all over the district, and we need your help to fight back. Click here and give $5 or more, right now. secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/fightbackagainstkarlrove

Friend,
Just wanted to give you a quick update on Monday&#39;s news.
Rove&#39;s spending close to a million dollars in our district, and his ads started running yesterday. We&#39;ve released a new ad, but we still need some help getting it on the air -
if you can give $5 or more right now, you&#39;ll help us counter the Rove-Ose message that&#39;s running throughout the district multiple times a day.
I know you&#39;re with us. Let&#39;s do this.
Thanks,
Danny Kazin
