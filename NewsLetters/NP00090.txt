David,
We both know it -- Deadlines are stressful.
But the
June 30th
FEC deadline is the BIGGEST fundraising deadline we&rsquo;ve faced together this election. Here&rsquo;s why: Everything we raise will become public.
That means the press, Mr. Boehner, and our potential opponents will get to look at all our numbers -- and know if we&rsquo;re vulnerable. Let&rsquo;s show them what we&rsquo;re made of. Will you make a generous contribution before next week's deadline?
$5 &gt;&gt;
$35 &gt;&gt;
$50 &gt;&gt;
$100 &gt;&gt;
$250 &gt;&gt;
Other &gt;&gt;
The strength of our campaign will be extremely clear in exactly one week from RIGHT NOW.
Please make sure we are sending the right message to Boehner. http://act.cheribustos.com/donate
