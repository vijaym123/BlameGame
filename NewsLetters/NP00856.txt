Dear
Friends,
Currently our federal government
releases back into the United States criminally convicted immigrants if their
country of origin has not accepted them for deportation within six
months. These convicted immigrants that are being set free include those
who have committed crimes of violence or aggravated felonies,
such as sexual assault.
Often called catch-and-release, this is a disturbing loophole in
our federal immigration code that allows criminals to return to
our communities and commit even more crimes against
Americans.
The numbers show that from
2008-2012, nearly 17,000 immigrants with orders of removal were released
back into our communities. In 2013 alone, more than 36,000
criminally convicted aliens were released by the U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement agency because their home countries had yet to take
them back.
In order to fix this
problem created by a couple of Supreme Court cases, earlier this year
I introduced the
Keep Our Communities Safe Act ,
which would require the Department of Homeland Security to recertify
a criminal immigrant for continued detention every six months if they
are a threat to the community. I intend to pursue all options for
getting this important legislation passed, having most recently introduced
it as an amendment to the Senates human-trafficking
legislation, and this loophole closed.
It
is time we address the dangerous system allowing criminal aliens to
be released back into the United States. But most importantly, its
time for us to keep our communities safe.
Sincerely,
Office
