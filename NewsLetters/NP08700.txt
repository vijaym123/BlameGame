Rep. Bruce Braley -- Iowa's First
District
David,
In the wake of terrorist groups attacking multiple cities in Iraq,
President Obama has announced that the United States is considering
military options in order to support the Iraqi government.
But after two long wars in the Middle East, where many of our brave
young men and women sacrificed their health and lives, I don't take
lightly the prospect of putting more of our heroes in harm's way.
To better understand the real, long-term costs of this type of
involvement I've introduced the True Cost of War Act, which would
require the government to provide a long-term analysis of the costs of
the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Before reengaging in Iraq in any way,
we need a serious and thorough debate.
That's why I want to hear from you:
Do you think the United States should intervene in the current crisis
in Iraq?
The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) is a terrorist group
that has recently attacked large sections of Iraq and is moving toward
the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.
Committing our military to another conflict in Iraq is serious and why
your opinion on this matters to me.
Feel free to click here and take this quick poll to give me your
feedback.
Your opinions truly matter to me, so thank you in advance for your
participation.

David,
In

attacking

in
Iraq,
President
Obama
has
announced
that
the
United
States
is
considering
military
options
in
order
to
support
the
Iraqi
government.
But
after
two
long
wars
in
the
Middle
East,
where
many
of
our
brave
young
men
and
women
sacrificed
their
health
and
lives,
I
don't
take
lightly
the
prospect
of
putting
more
of
our
heroes
in
harm's

To
better
understand
the
real,
long-term
costs
of
this

of

I&#8217;ve
introduced
the
True
Cost
of

which

Do
