Dear Friend,
Each year on Memorial Day, we have the
opportunity to honor and recognize those
who have paid the ultimate price for our
freedoms. If it werent for the
sacrifices of these brave men and women, we
wouldnt live in the most free and
prosperous country on Earth. Memorial Day
also serves as a reminder that we must take
care of all of those who have taken care of
us.
To pay tribute to veterans and the
fallen heroes of Ohios 16
th
District, my office presents
medals earned by servicemen and women who
never received them. Last September, we
organized a ceremony honoring Bruce
Bendroth of North Canton. We were notified
by his daughter that his discharge papers
stated he earned two medals, and upon
further research she discovered he was owed
a total of six medals. Sadly, he never
received them. More than 69 years later,
92-year-old Bendroth was finally awarded
the medals he deserved while wearing the
same Navy jumper he wore when he returned
home from World War II.
At the ceremony, Bendroth said,
there are so many other people that
deserve what I'm getting, but they'll never
get it because they're not here.
Visibly emotional, he said that he was one
of the lucky ones who survived.
Bendroths humility and heartfelt
words during the ceremony was a sobering
reminder of the true sacrifice that so many
of those who are a part of our
countrys greatest generation made to
keep our country safe.
Its important that we recognize
the service and sacrifice of all men and
women in the Armed Forces by keeping our
countrys promises to veterans. This
past week, the House of Representatives
approved several bills that will help
servicemen and women transition back to
civilian life and bring more accountability
to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
For example, the Boosting Rates of American
Veteran Employment (BRAVE) Act allows the
VA to give preference to government
contractors who employ veterans only if
its on a full-time basis. The
Ensuring VA Employee Accountability Act
requires the VA to maintain a record of all
admonishments and reprimands that a VA
employee receives in his or her file as
long as the individual is employed at the
department. As it stands now, an
admonishment can only remain on an
employees record for two years, and
a reprimand is erased after three years
potentially creating a
misperception of an employees
performance. Lastly, the Homeless
Veterans Reintegration Program
(HVRP) provides grant money for job
training programs to community
organizations that serve homeless
veterans.
This Memorial Day, let us all pause to
remember all of those who have given up so
much to protect our American way of life.
