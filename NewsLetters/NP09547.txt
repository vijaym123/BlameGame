352,000 Georgians Relying on Vote in Congress
Today I will be in the House of Representatives doing my duty - voting to represent you and the people of Georgia.
The Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), which will authorize the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project (SHEP), will keep the port and the state of Georgia competitive with other nations. And we know that as long as there is a level-playing field, the people of Georgia will prosper.
I look forward to passing this fiscally responsible and incredibly important legislation. The 352,000 Georgians who rely on the port of Savannah for their job can rest assured they will not be held back by government gridlock.
This legislation is the result of long years of work by my fellow Members of Congress and local leaders throughout the state. I am proud to have been a part of this effort and look forward to seeing Georgia succeed as a result of this renewed investment in the state.
Have a great day,
Jack
