Congressman
Lamborn Statement on One Year Obamacare Implementation
Anniversary
10/1/14
Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn released the
following statement discussing the one year anniversary of Obamacare's
implementation.
One year
ago today, Obamacare enrollment started and thats when the lies
started to be revealed. We were promised for years that if we liked our
healthcare plan we would be able to keep it, that was not true. The
entire healthcare network of America was unraveled and disrupted to serve
two percent of the population. That simply should not have happened.
Thats why my colleagues and I have voted, and will continue to vote, to
repeal and replace Obamacare with solutions oriented to serve small
businesses and the free market economy, such as H.R. 3121, the American
Healthcare Reform Act. Healthcare decisions should be made by you and
your doctor, not by faceless bureaucrats in Washington
DC.
