Senator Stabenow Introduces Bipartisan Bill to Toughen Trade
Enforcement
Last week, Senator Debbie Stabenow, co-chair of the Senate
Manufacturing Caucus, introduced a new bipartisan bill to help ensure
that American businesses and workers can compete fairly in a global
marketplace. The Trade Enforcement Act will toughen trade enforcement
by making the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center a permanent center
responsible for coordinating the enforcement powers of multiple federal
agencies. The Act also will create a Chief Trade Enforcement Officer to
lead the center and a Chief Manufacturing Negotiator in the Office of
the U.S. Trade Representative to protect the interests of American
manufacturers in trade negotiations. The introduction of the Trade
Enforcement Act follows the U.S. Trade Representative's release of an
annual report that highlights all of the ways countries are cheating to
gain unfair trade advantages. "Every time another country breaks the
rules, manufacturing jobs at home take a hit," said Senator Stabenow.
"The White House put out a 384-page report listing all of the illegal
trade barriers that other countries use to keep American products out.
This bill will help crack down on countries that are breaking the
rules, which will ensure our businesses and workers can fairly
compete," she added.

School Nutrition Summit Focuses on Year-Round Access to Fresh Fruits
and Vegetables
Senator Stabenow delivered remarks during a United Way for Southeastern
Michigan school nutrition summit at Ford Field. She called on community
leaders and advocates to continue working together to make sure
children have access to fresh and nutritious meals at school and during
the summer months. "We all care about ending child hunger and want our
children to have healthy meals at school, after school, and during the
summer months," said Stabenow. "Making sure our children are fit to
serve and fit to succeed starts with serving students a half a cup of
fruits and vegetables at every meal. It's really that simple," she
added. Stabenow has led the effort to get more Michigan fruits and
vegetables in schools and spearheaded the 2014 Farm Bill, which
increased access to healthy foods nationwide.
