Dear Friends,
The Obama
Administrations move to ban ammunition for the most popular rifle in
America
the AR-15
has been withdrawn.
After a public
outcry that included more than 80,000 comments, the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) dropped its proposal to ban M855
ammunition with a week left in the one-month comment
period.
You spoke, we listened, said ATF on Twitter.
The good
news is ATF was chastened by their misreading of congressional intent in
the 1986 Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act (LEOPA). The bad
news is the agency promises further study, which could mean a revived ban
proposal.
LEOPA includes provisions to keep armor-piercing
bullets unavailable for handguns. Though ATF couldnt produce a
single example of an M855 round being fired from a handgun at a police
officer, they still proposed a ban on
all
M855
ammunition.
ATF also ignored a key protection of gun rights in LEOPA: The
exemption of ammunition primarily to be used for sporting purposes.
That provision should be read broadly to include many legitimate uses,
including target practice, hunting, organized and casual competition,
training, skills development and instruction.
We must never
forget that the Second Amendment wouldnt be much good if it only
protected firearms and not ammunition.
As word of the ban
spread, I joined House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte in writing ATF to
express our serious concern. I was joined by 235 other members of the
House; a similar letter was signed by 53 senators.
Widespread
support for the Second Amendment hasnt stopped some Democrats, who
propose a legislative ban of the M855 in the Armor Piercing Bullets
Act. A more sweeping bill, the Modernized Law Enforcement Officers
Protection Act, would ban even more forms of armor-piercing
ammo.
Consequently, Ill be cosponsoring H.R. 1365, the Ammunition and
Firearms Protection Act, which would stop ATF from issuing any future
regulations to ban armor-piercing ammunition used in rifles.
As
Thomas Jefferson said so well, No free man shall ever be debarred
the use of arms.
In the name of freedom, I will continue to
oppose any infringement on the rights of law-abiding Americans to own
firearms and ammunition.
Thank
you ,
