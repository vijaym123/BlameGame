Helping Small Businesses and Farmers Invest in Growth
Every week, I hear from farmers, ranchers, and small business owners
who are hoping for a simpler, fairer tax code that will help them grow
their businesses.
Tax reform can help us strengthen the economy and
create jobs.
How?
Well, for one thing, small businesses waste about
1.7 billion hours
each year on tax compliance.
And small
businesses spend more than $18 billion each year on tax compliance
costs-not on taxes; on complying with tax policy.
Freeing up that time
and money allows business owners to invest in new equipment, new
employees, and business expansion-and that benefits everyone.
Part of simplifying the tax code is putting an end to temporary
provisions that expire after a few years.
Temporary policy is
problematic because it doesn't allow businesses to make long-term
plans.
House Republicans are working on permanent, comprehensive tax
reform, but there's a long road ahead for that policy.
In the meantime, farmers, ranchers, and business owners are struggling
because an important tax provision has expired.
The Section 179
expensing allowance allows businesses to purchase new equipment and
deduct the entire depreciation amount in a single year.
For instance,
if a farmer buys a new combine, he could deduct its lifetime
depreciation from his tax return that same year, which makes the
purchase more affordable.
With some farm equipment costing hundreds of
thousands of dollars, Section 179 expensing gives the farmer the
ability to not only improve his or her operation in a fiscally
responsible manner, but also to invest money in the local economy.
I want to help our farmers, ranchers, and business owners invest in our
local economy, so I sent a letter to House and Senate leadership today
urging them to return the Section 179 allowance to its former levels
for a minimum of two years.
I explained that, "Small businesses drive
our economy, and tax policy that encourages growth, investment, and
expansion means more jobs for Americans."

A Plan to Balance the Budget
In last week's Roundup survey, I asked you to weigh in on Budget
Committee Chairman Paul Ryan's budget proposal
.
The majority of you shared your
support for his plan.
I agree that our country can't go on spending
more than we take in.
A balanced budget is necessary to take control
of our debt and revive our economy.
So last week I voted for Rep. Paul Ryan's 2015 budget proposal, the
Path to Prosperity, which will get our nation back on a fiscally
responsible track.
Chairman Ryan's budget sets total spending and revenue levels for the
upcoming year, and lays the groundwork for our upcoming appropriations
discussions.
I'm pleased it makes necessary cuts to start tackling our
nation's sky-rocketing debt.
It cuts $5.1 trillion of wasteful
spending and will balance the books by 2025.
It also addresses the
auto-pilot programs that are driving our debt.
Two-thirds of federal
spending goes to mandatory programs like Social Security, Medicare,
Medicaid, and-increasingly-interest on the national debt.
We can't get
our spending under control without addressing these programs.
I'll keep you updated as we hammer out the specifics of next year's
spending and work on appropriations bills.
Honoring a Great Red Raider
Last week, I hosted a special order on the House Floor
honoring Texas Tech Chancellor Kent
Hance.
Kent was my teacher at Tech many years ago, and since then, he's
been a friend, mentor, and inspiration to me.
I was joined by nine
Members of Congress who shared their own memories of Chancellor Hance
and praised his work at Texas Tech.
Members who couldn't join us on
the floor wrote letters about Kent that I read into the Congressional
Record.
They were joined by officials including Governor Rick Perry,
Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, and former President George W. Bush,
all of whom commended the Chancellor's work.
But I suspect the letters
that meant the most to Chancellor Hance came from current and former
Tech students who shared what he meant to them
as a teacher and
mentor.

Helping
Small
Businesses
and
Farmers
Invest
in
Growth
Every
week,
I
hear
from
farmers,
ranchers,
and
small
business
owners
who
are
hoping
for
a
simpler,
fairer
tax
code
that
will
help
them
grow
their
businesses.
Tax
reform
can
help
us
strengthen
the
economy
and
create
jobs.
How?
Well,
for
one
thing,
small
businesses
waste
about
1.7
billion
hours
each
year
on
tax
compliance.
And
small
businesses
spend
more
than
$18
billion
each
year
on
tax
compliance
costs&#8212;not
on
taxes;
on
complying
with
tax
policy.
Freeing
up
that
time
and
money
allows
business
owners
to
invest
in
new
equipment,
new
employees,
and
business
expansion&#8212;and
that
benefits
everyone.
Part
of
simplifying
the
tax
code
is
putting
an
end
to
temporary
provisions
that
expire
after
a
few
years.
Temporary
policy
is
problematic
because
it
doesn&#8217;t
allow
businesses
to
make
long-term
plans.
House
Republicans
are
working
on
permanent,
comprehensive
tax
reform,
but
there&#8217;s
a
long
road
ahead
for
that
policy.
In
the
meantime,
farmers,
ranchers,
and
business
owners
are
struggling
because
an
important
tax
provision
has
expired.
The
Section
179
expensing
allowance
allows
businesses
to
purchase
new
equipment
and
deduct
the
entire
depreciation
amount
in
a
single
year.
For
instance,
if
a
farmer
buys
a
new
combine,
he
could
deduct
its
lifetime
depreciation
from
his
tax
return
that
same
year,
which
makes
the
purchase
more
affordable.
With
some
farm
equipment
costing
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars,
Section
179
expensing
gives
the
farmer
the
ability
to
not
only
improve
his
or
her
operation
in
a
fiscally
responsible
manner,
but
also
to i nvest
money
in
the
local
economy.
I
want
to
help
our
farmers,
ranchers,
and
business
owners
invest
in
our
local
economy,
so
I
sent
a
letter
to
House
and
Senate
leadership
today
urging
them
to
return
the
Section
179
allowance
to
its
former
levels
for
a
minimum
of
two
years .
I
explained
that,
&#8220;Small
businesses
drive
our
economy,
and
tax
policy
that
encourages
growth,
investment,
and
expansion
means
more
jobs
for
Americans.&#8221;
You

the
letter

A
Plan
to
Balance
the
Budget
In
last
week&#8217;s
Roundup
survey,
I
asked
you
to
weigh
in
on
Budget
Committee
Chairman
Paul
Ryan&#8217;s
budget
proposal .
The
majority
of
you
shared
your
support
for
his
plan.
I
agree
that
our
country
can&#8217;t
go
on
spending
more
than
we
take
in.
A
balanced
budget
is
necessary
to
take
control
of
our
debt
and
revive
our
economy.
So
last
week
I
voted
for
Rep.
Paul
Ryan&#8217;s
2015
budget
proposal,
the
Path
to
Prosperity ,
which
will
get
our
nation
back
on
a
fiscally
responsible
track.
Chairman
Ryan&#8217;s
budget
sets
total
spending
and
revenue
levels
for
the
upcoming
year,
and
lays
the
groundwork
for
our
upcoming
appropriations
discussions.
I&#8217;m
pleased
it
makes
necessary
cuts
to
start
tackling
our
nation&#8217;s
sky-rocketing
debt.
It
cuts
$5.1
trillion
of
wasteful
spending
and
will
balance
the
books
by
2025.
It
also
addresses
the
auto-pilot
programs
that
are
driving
our
debt.
Two-thirds
of
federal
spending
goes
to
mandatory
programs
like
Social
Security,
Medicare,
Medicaid,
and&#8212;increasingly&#8212;interest
on
the
national
debt.
We
can&#8217;t
get
our
spending
under
control
without
addressing
these
programs.
I&#8217;ll
keep
you
updated
as
we
hammer
out
the
specifics
of
next
year&#8217;s
spending
and
work
on
appropriations
bills.
Honoring
a
Great
Red
Raider
Last
week,
I
hosted
a
special

on
the
House

honoring
Texas
Tech
Chancellor
Kent

Kent
was
my
teacher
at

many

and
former

George
W.

all
of
whom
commended
the
Chancellor&#8217;s
work .
But
I
suspect
the
letters
that
meant
the
most
to
Chancellor
Hance
came
from
current
and
former
Tech
students
who
shared
what
he
