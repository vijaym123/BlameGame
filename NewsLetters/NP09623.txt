Liberal Groups Fear Senator Johnson's
Lawsuit
Senator Johnson has been completely transparent in
how he plans to pay for his lawsuit against the Obama
administration.
Even in his announcement of the lawsuit, Senator Johnson plainly
stated that his campaign, and not taxpayers, would pay for all costs
incurred.
Campaign donations and expenditures are reported to
the Federal Election Commission and are available to the public.
As Senator Johnson pays his legal bills, those will be reported as
well. Read more

One unpleasant
surprise in the grotesquely misnamed Affordable Care Act is how much
more costly the insurance is.
The
next unpleasant surprise is how narrow the choices are. As even so
Obama-friendly a newpaper as the New York Times is now
admitting.
No matter what kind of health
plan consumers choose, they will find fewer doctors and hospitals in
their network
or pay much more for the privilege of going to any
provider they want...
