Picture this: The year is 1960 and
John Kennedy was just elected President. You are 4 years old when your
father dies. Your guardian immediately begins collecting Social Security
survivor benefits on your behalf. Fifty-four years later, at age 58,
the IRS seizes your tax refund because they think your survivor
benefits were miscalculated. They think your guardian got too much. So they
decide to confiscate your money.
Sound
fair? Of course not. But it actually happened, according to the
Washington Post , which revealed that 400,000 innocent Americans have
been targeted in similar fashion.
I will be
introducing a bill in Congress to stop this
practice.
