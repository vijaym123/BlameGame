Friend,
At the risk of repeating myself - you&#39;re amazing. Every time we need you, you step up and meet the challenge. Your support last week was outstanding. I&#39;m consistently grateful.
The weeks ahead will be hard. The odds we&#39;re facing are pretty steep, and we have to stay focused, work together, and keep the end goal in sight - victory on Election Day.
As outsiders continue to attack and distort my record, I will be relying on you more than ever.
Together, we can make sure the truth gets out there - and by doing that, we will win.
Thank you. Onward to victory.
Be well,
Ami Bera, MD
