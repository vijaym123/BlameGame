ABOUT
ISSUES
Its been just over five months since you sent me to Washington, and
since then Ive been hard at work for Montana.
One of the most important things to me is staying accountable to you,
the people of Montana. Ive made a point to be totally accessible to
Montanans. That is why Ive been holding town hall meetings across the
state, hosting Google Hangouts online, and recently my office launched
mobile office hours to better serve rural Montanans.
Already weve
hosted mobile office hours in Libby, Superior, Virginia City, Dillon,
and Sidney, just to name a few.
Keep an eye out in your local paper
and my website
for upcoming mobile office hours.
Last week, I introduced comprehensive forest reform legislation that
conserves our forests, protects them against wildfires and reduces
costly and frivolous litigation against legal timber sales. If you
havent had the chance, check out my article in the Missoulian
about these important reforms.
I also recently introduced legislation to honor the four fallen heroes
in the Benghazi
terrorist attack with Congressional
Gold Medals. This is not about politics, this is personal. I knew the
fallen Navy SEALs, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods, and I believe we owe
it to them, and Ambassador Stevens and Agent Sean Smith, to honor their
service and sacrifice.
Don't forget, Military Academy applications are available through my
office and on my website.
If you, or a young person you know, is
interested in applying to one of our nation's service academies, my
office can help.
Visit my webpage to learn more
.
Its an honor to serve you in our nations capital. Ill see you soon.
God bless,

It&#146;s
