In his latest report, Charlie LeDuff explores the legacy of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which was signed 20 years ago with the expectation that it would help create jobs and stem the wave of illegal immigration from Mexico.
Today, with the surge of unaccompanied children crossing our southern border creating a humanitarian crisis, many are questioning the effectiveness of NAFTA, including
Rep. Candice Miller who has repeatedly called on the U.S. to reexamine the agreement.
