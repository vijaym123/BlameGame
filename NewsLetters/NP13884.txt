Congressional Report
Dear Friends,
I would like to share with you several updates during my Congressional Work Week across the 28th District of Texas.
HEB 23rd Annual Feast of Sharing
This weekend, I attended the HEB Feast of Sharing in Laredo. It was a great opportunity to see many people in the community serve food to thousands of Laredoans and I thank HEB for the good work it is doing in our community. I wish every family the best during this week.

US-Mexico Inter-Parliamentary Meeting
Congressman Henry Cuellar in attendance at a joint US - Mexico Inter-Parliamentary meeting in Mexico City, where he discussed issue of trade and security with Mexican counterparts.
It was a pleasure to join my colleagues Chairman Michael McCaul (R-TX), Congressman Gene Green (D-TX), Congressman Sean Duffy (R-WI), Congressman Pete Gallego (D-TX), Congressman Joe Barton (R-TX), Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), Congressman Richard Hudson (R-NC), and Congressman Beto ORourke (D-TX) in the United States and Mexico for an Inter-Parliamentary joint meeting last week in Mexico City. Our southern neighbor is one of our strongest and most important allies in terms of trade, security, and global relations. I look forward to traveling back again soon!
Service Academy Day
My Outreach Coordinator, Pete Arguello, hosted a Service Academy Day to provide information to interested students and their parents about applications to the National Service Academies.
On Monday, my Outreach Coordinator, Pete Arguello, hosted an informational session for high school students and their parents to learn about the application process for our nations prestigious service academies.
Two years ago, an applicant from the 28th District of Texas, Gavyn Gonzales, was accepted to the Naval Academy and is now completing his training as a Midshipman.
I encourage all young people interested in serving their country to apply
with hard work and dedication, an excellent opportunity to gain a first class education and serve your country is within your reach.

New Poll Shows Broad Support for Immigration Reform
A new poll shows that a strong majority of Americans, across party lines and religious boundaries, support reform for our nation's immigration system.
We must act now to reform our broken immigration system and I am glad to see Americans are ready for reform as well.
The poll shows that:
--65% of Americans agree that our nations immigration system is broken.
--63% support immigration legislation that creates a pathway to citizenship for immigrants.
