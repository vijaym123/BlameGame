Dear Friends,
April has arrived, and hopefully spring with it (finally!). Here is the
latest on how I am serving you in Illinois and Washington,
D.C.
State of
Homeschooling
Protecting
educational options for families is a priority that is close to my heart. As a
father of two homeschooling boys, I presented an update on the state
of homeschooling to the general public and met with families at the
Johnsburg Public Librarys Homeschool Resource Center. (See below my
signature for news stories about the event.)
As homeschooling households continue to grow in
number in Illinois, I wanted to talk about issues and legislation that
affect the movement, such as the concerning effects of the Common Core
on college admissions.
In response to the ongoing German persecution and unequal treatment
of homeschooling families like the Romeikes and the Wunderlichs, I
signed onto a letter requesting a meeting with the German ambassador. I
was grateful the ambassador met with my colleagues and me this week. We
had a productive meeting and I look forward to further discussions
about how to secure educational opportunities and choice for
all.

Offering Alternatives to
Obamacare
The White
House announced with great excitement this week that the Presidents
health care law is a huge success after signing up 7 million people to the
new federal system.
But the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has provided little economic security
for Americans.
I wrote
an
op-ed
for FoxNews.com about how House
Republicans have fought for positive alternatives
not just repeals
that
will provide economic security for Americans, while protecting patient
choice and driving down health care costs.
Bills like H.R. 3121, H.R. 2300 and others
embody viable alternative models to Obamacare.
Like any piece of
legislation, these ideas arent perfect or complete.
They need
to be debated through the normal legislative process to fine-tune them
to the needs of American health consumers.
In addition, this week I supported passage of
H.R. 2575 , the Save American Workers Act. The
ACAs 30-hour rule puts 2.6 million workers at risk for losing hours,
according to the Hoover Institution. Of those, 59 percent are younger
workers between the ages of 18-34 and 63 percent are women, including
single mothers. This bill will help stop the unintended consequences of
the ACA on those who earn the least, and I look forward to the Senate
taking action.
Honoring Women Veteran Champions of Change
On the House floor I recognized Erica Borggren,
Director for Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs who was named a
White House
Women Veteran Champion of Change.
General Petraeus
calls her, one of the most talented officers with whom Ive ever
served and exemplary in every respect. Please watch the video below for
more information on this hero.

I Want your Input on Combating
Heroin
As you may know, I
convened a Community Leadership Forum on Heroin Prevention in March to
share resources and ideas to tackle the growing threat of heroin
addiction and opioid abuse in northern Illinois.
Based on the great discussions we had in our
breakout groups, I have released a summary of the event and a working
draft action plan as a tool to keep the momentum going and ensure
community coordination and follow-up to what was
discussed.
This is not a finished productwe still
need input and further revision from the participants, but also from
the community as a whole.
This document, available on my website at
http://hultgren.house.gov/heroin , is just the next step toward putting
in place an action plan that will work and that all interested parties
are collaboratively pursuing.
I encourage you to send your edits, suggestions and comments
by 5:00 p.m. CT, April 17 to my Coalitions Director, Susan Russell, at
susan.russell@mail.house.gov .
