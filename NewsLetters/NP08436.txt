Dear Friend,
Thanks for taking the time to read this week's e-newsletter. Below you
will find updates on my latest work on your behalf including a video
update on the VA situation and recent legislation I have supported.
This week the House was in session and passed legislation to fund the
Department of Defense. With an increasingly volatile Middle East and
new threats emerging around the globe, this funding allows us to
achieve our mission overseas, keep our men and women in uniform safe,
and maintain national security. In addition, the House continues to
scrutinize the release of the Taliban Five in exchange for SGT Bowe
Bergdahl. Read to the bottom of the email to learn my thoughts on this
matter.
As always, do not hesitate to contact me
any time an issue that concerns you comes before
Congress. It remains an honor and privilege to represent you in the
House.
Sincerely,
- Joe
DR. JOE HECK
Member of Congress
Video of the Week
Hundreds of Nevadans have contacted me to express their outrage with,
disappointment over, and desire for solutions to, the problems at the
Veterans Administration. As an active member of the Army Reserve,
military physician, and veteran myself, I am committed to bringing
needed improvements to the VA so it better serves the men and women who
have made great sacrifices for our country. I filmed a short video to
update you on my recent work to find solutions to the problems at the
VA. Watch the video

Trending on Social Media
One of the best ways to keep up with what I am working on in real time

me on Facebook and Twitter as Rep. Joe Heck. There you will find the
latest photos and videos as well as information about legislation I
have introduced and supported. Take a look at some of my recent

Below you can read my justification for supporting two bills that
recently passed the House.
H.R. 4810, the Veterans Access to Care Act. Why I supported this bill:
Veterans should be able to go outside the Veterans Administration
system for healthcare services if there are geographic or bureaucratic
barriers to accessing care. This bill allows vets who live 40 miles or
more away from a VA facility or who have waited longer than the VA's
stated wait time goals to seek care from private doctors and hospitals.
This bill is another important step towards ensuring our veterans get
the treatment and healthcare they have earned and deserve. Passed the
House 426 - 0.
H.R. 4438, the American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2014. Why I
supported this bill: We need to support small businesses and help
facilitate economic growth, especially in the high-tech sector of our
economy. This bill makes permanent the research and development tax
credit which will give businesses the needed certainty to invest in
long-term research and development projects. More research and
development will help strengthen our economy and provide good,
high-paying jobs for Americans. Passed the House 274-131.
If you have any questions or concerns about these, or any bills the
House has considered recently, take a moment to email me by clicking

Around the District
I recently got the chance to meet with UPS drivers and staff at their
facility in Las Vegas. I had the great privilege of presenting driver
safety and longevity awards to several employees before they left on
their deliveries.
I visited Full Spectrum Laser, a unique engraving and 3D printing
company located in district three that
assembles its products 100% in
the United States. While I was there, the team at Full Spectrum made a
dragon trinket and a personal business card holder for me that I
watched them make right before my eyes.
I held a listening session with local veterans to hear their concerns
regarding the local VA healthcare system and discuss additional ways we
can bring needed improvements to the Veterans Administration.
