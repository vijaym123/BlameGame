Become a citizen co-sponsor of the SAVE Act to end the horrors of sex
trafficking
Dear Friend,
As the old saying goes, the journey of a thousand miles begins with a
single step.
This journey started beneath the historic dome at the Old
Courthouse
, when I first introduced the SAVE Act
with advocates from all over the St. Louis region.
And now, my friends, we are one step closer to ending the horrors of
sex trafficking.
This afternoon, the House Judiciary Committee passed
the SAVE Act in strong bipartisan fashion, where it now awaits a vote
on the floor of the United States House of Representatives.
In order to keep the momentum going, I am asking for your help.
Please
visit my website, and sign up to become a citizen co-sponsor of the
SAVE Act.
As citizen co-sponsors, you're the tip of the spear
in stopping the scourge of sex slavery.
If you have a moment, here are some suggested posts for social media to
help raise awareness and protect the most vulnerable members of our
society.
The #SAVEAct stops advertisers who knowingly profit from sex
trafficking.
We have a moral obligation to stop human trafficking where innocent
victims are dragged into the dark abyss of sex slavery. #SAVEAct
Modern-day slavery exists right here in our communities. It is
hiding in plain sight. #SAVEAct
Approximately 300,000 children are at risk of being prostituted in
the United States. #SAVEAct
The average age of entry into prostitution for a child victim in
the United States is 14 years old #SAVEAct
Companies that profit from advertising sexual slavery of innocent
victims must be held accountable #SAVEAct
47 State Attorneys General signed a letter to Congress asking to
change the law on online sex trafficking #SAVEAct
Together, we can put an end to the horrors of sex trafficking.
As always, it is an honor to serve you and I look forward to speaking
with you again soon.
Sincerely,
Ann Wagner
Member of Congress
