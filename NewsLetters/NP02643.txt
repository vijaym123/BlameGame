Congressman
Bruce Poliquin
Representing the 2nd District
February 20, 2015
Concealed Carry
Reciprocity :
Recently, Congressman Bruce Poliquin proudly became an
original cosponsor of
H.R. 986 , which ensures concealed carry
reciprocity.
As a Mainer, I appreciate and understand
the importance of the Second Amendment for our hard-working taxpayers
and I will always support and defend their Constitutional
right.
HUD Inspector Generals
Report :
In regards to the recent HUD Inspector General's
report , Congressman Bruce Poliquin released the following statement
after the Inspector Generals office found that thousands of individuals
were getting subsidies they were not entitled to, because they were
not taking part in the education or job training programs required by
HUD.
Maine families deserve a government that is accountable and
helps the poor while treating our hard-working taxpayers fairly. I
look forward to digging deeper into this situation to help get to the
bottom of this gross abuse of the public trust and misuse of taxpayer
dollars, and fixing the
problem."
FLASH BACK FRIDAY: Congressman
Poliquin Grills HUD Secretary :
Do you think having a
huge government organization thats responsible for more than half of
all the mortgage insurance in America, which puts the taxpayers on the
hook for $1.1 trillion, and you folks dont know how big you want to
get; do you think that lives up to your mission statement of being
fiscally accountable, sir?
Letter to the Food and Drug Administration : " Twin
Rivers Paper Company is one of primary manufactures of pharmaceutical
paper inserts in America. The mill employs nearly 600 hard-working
Mainers in the Madawaska area. It's critically important for our families
in the St. John's Valley in Aroostook County for the Twin Rivers mill
to remain competitive and healthy."
Recreational Lands Self-Defense Act :
"The Recreational Lands
Self-Defense Act will allow our hard-working and law-abiding taxpayers
to possess firearms and State-issued concealed carry permits on lands
owned and operated by the United State Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE). With over 7 million acres of land owned by the USACE, our taxpayers
should be able to defend themselves and their property as they
legally fish, hunt and camp.
