I was
in high school when the Supreme Court passed their
Roe v.
Wade
ruling.
I remember vividly how I could not understand their
thinking that legalized stopping a beating heart on demand. I thought
it was outrageous then and the intervening years have done nothing to
change my opinion. I believe in the sanctity of human life, which
begins at conception, and in protecting the rights of the
unborn.
I am an original co-sponsor of the
No Taxpayer Funding for
Abortion Act . This legislation codifies and makes permanent
several policies which prohibit the use of tax dollars for abortion, both
domestically and abroad. I have additionally co-sponsored several
other pro-life bills. If passed, these bills will establish that life
begins at conception and ensure that no funds provided under Title X of
the
Public Health Service Act
should be awarded to entities
which perform services for, or provide funds to another entity which
performs abortions.
I will continue to fight to stop
legislation and related measures which allow taxpayer dollars to fund abortions.
Moreover, I will continue to work with my colleagues to protect the
rights of the unborn and promote policies that encourage adoption and
promote stable families.
Each year women all across our
country find themselves facing a decision about whether to carry their
unborn child to term and how to provide for that child once it has been
born. We owe it to these women, and their children, to make sure they
are truly informed about the options they have for their child. I am
leading this effort through my
Adoption Promotion Act . This
legislation will ensure that all women who access family planning
services provided with Title X funding are given pregnancy options counseling
which includes professional adoption counseling. With this
legislation, I am hoping that when a woman feels she is unable to care for her
child for whatever reason, she knows she still has an option to provide
her child with life and a good, loving future through
adoption.
I am pro-life and believe we need to protect the rights of
the unborn children.
At the same time, we need to ensure that
women who feel they cannot care for their child know they have the
option of giving the child the gift of life and a loving family through
adoption.
