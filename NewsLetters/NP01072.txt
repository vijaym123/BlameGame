May Marks the
10 th
Anniversary of Jewish American Heritage
Month
WASHINGTON
This May marks the
tenth anniversary of Jewish American Heritage Month (JAHM), proclaimed by
President George W. Bush in 2006 after the congressional efforts of
U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (FL-23) and the late Sen. Arlen
Specter (PA). Rep. Wasserman Schultz issued the following
statement:
This year we honor the tenth anniversary of Jewish American
Heritage Month, during which we celebrate American Jews
contributions to this nation.
We have an opportunity to educate the broader
public about individuals and communities who have helped build our
nation since before its founding. Although we comprise a tiny percent of
the population, so many American Jews have dedicated their lifes work
to making this nation a more perfect union for us
all.
From the first battles for Americas independence, to advocating for
public policies that will ensure that everyone reaching our shores has
the opportunity to lead a better life, American Jews have and will
continue to be an integral part of our nations history.
American
Jews have been on the front lines in the fight for civil rights, justice,
and equality. We have been responsible for significant medical and
scientific advancements, and in all facets of American life, we have
enriched the proud culture of the American experience.
As the
first Jewish woman elected to Congress from Florida, I am proud to
represent one of the largest Jewish populations in the United States,
and proud to have carried the dream of this initiative from my South
Florida Jewish community leadership to the national
stage.
