Wicker Supports Balanced
Budget
Republican Plan Offers Economic
Growth, Less Debt
Earlier this year, President Obama
released a budget proposal that would borrow more, spend more, and
tax more
adding $6 trillion in deficits over the next 10 years.
Like the Presidents previous budgets, it was overwhelmingly rejected
in the Senate by a vote of 98-1.
$500 Billion in Economic Growth
Senate
Republicans, however, have a better plan in mind.
A budget introduced
by Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee,
champions a pro-growth agenda instead of a big-government one.
According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), Sen. Enzis budget
would increase Americas economic growth by more than $500 billion over
the next decade.
In Mississippi, that could mean more than
10,000 new jobs.
Unlike the Presidents budget, Republicans
plan would balance spending and revenues, reduce the debt by trillions
of dollars, and produce a surplus
all without raising taxes.
Simply put, it makes the tough decisions needed to rein in spending,
just like families in America are forced to do every day.
It also
repeals and replaces Obamacare, offering relief from a law that has
not reformed health care, instead burdening Americans with canceled
coverage and higher co-pays.
A
Long-Term Look at Spending
Seriously addressing
Americas debt problem is long overdue.
At more than $18 trillion,
the federal debt is unprecedented and unsustainable.
Interest
payments on the debt are on the rise, expected to triple by 2025, when
they will top $800 billion.
If that happens, annual interest
payments will become the third-highest expenditure in the federal budget,
behind only Medicare and Social Security.
Particularly
disheartening is that these payments offer taxpayers nothing in
return.
As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I was successful in
adding an amendment to Sen. Enzis budget proposal before it came to a
vote on the Senate floor.
Specifically, my provision would
require the CBO to calculate the long-term economic impact of major
spending legislation.
Instead of producing only 10-year estimates,
which is the agencys current practice, the CBO would make projections for
20 years.
Such analyses, for example, would have been
insightful during the debate on the Presidents health-care law, which is
expected to cost significantly more than the CBOs 10-year forecasts
initially suggested.
Plan for
Prosperity
Producing a spending plan is a basic
responsibility of governing.
Congress is required by law to pass a
budget resolution every year
an obligation Senate Democrats met only
once while holding the majority over the past five years.
Consideration of the budget is often accompanied by a marathon vote-a-rama,
in which lawmakers offer and vote on an unlimited number of
amendments.
I used this opportunity to draw attention to several important
issues, offering amendments to strengthen our defense ties with
allies, find a cure for Alzheimers, advance port dredging and maintenance,
and protect hospitals that serve vulnerable populations from
Obamacares harmful cuts.
I am encouraged by this years budget
process, which has produced meaningful debates about government spending
and Americas financial future.
Taxpayers deserve a government
that is run efficiently and effectively.
A balanced budget would
be a major step in the right direction, putting the country on a path
that promises prosperity, not crushing debt.
