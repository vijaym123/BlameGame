The CFPB
Needs Increased Transparency and
Accountability
Dear Friend,
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
(CFPB), which was created by the Dodd-Frank
Act, is an agency intended to oversee
consumer protection in the financial
sector, but it is equipped with
unprecedented authority over
Americas financial system, defying
the basic principle of separation of
powers. The CFPB receives its funding
directly from the Federal Reserve, which is
not
held to a minimal standard of transparency
or accountability , and it is only
subjected to limited congressional
oversight
a semi-annual Financial
Services Committee hearing with its
Director.
The CFPB remains an opaque and
dangerously
unaccountable agency
equipped with
unrivaled power over Americas
financial system and consumers
personal data. In actuality, it is using
its power to adopt policies that often
harm, rather than help, the very Americans
it is tasked with protecting.
Consumers, community banks, and credit
unions from across Virginias Fifth
District have relayed to me troubling
stories about the impact of the CFPB
indicating that the agencys
unchecked authority is restricting consumer
choice, creating an atmosphere of economic
uncertainty, and imposing undue regulatory
burdens that increase costs. This has
extensive and harmful consequences for our
economy. Small businesses, the backbone of
our economy, are not able to access the
capital they need to create jobs if their
community banks are fighting bureaucratic
red tape instead of providing loans.
Without appropriate oversight from
Congress, the CFPB will be able to continue
imposing sweeping and restrictive
regulations on community financial
institutions across the Fifth District at a
time when access to credit for small
businesses, farms, and families is more
essential than ever. Real consumer
protection requires that we shift power
from bureaucrats in Washington who
implement one size fits all regulations to
those who are most affected. True consumer
protection empowers consumers, not
bureaucrats in Washington.
Last week, the House passed the
Bureau
of Consumer Financial Protection Advisory
Boards Act , which would create a Small
Business Advisory Board at the CFPB. This
bill is critical in ensuring that the CFPB
considers the broad-reaching negative
effects on our most dynamic job creators. I
was pleased to see it pass the House with
bipartisan support, and I urge our
colleagues in the Senate to continue
working with us to promote success for our
small businesses.
Though this bill was a crucial step in
the right direction, it is just the first
of many. Congressional oversight is
essential to holding the CFPB accountable
to the American taxpayers. Effective,
appropriate consumer protections are best
achieved through legislative reforms, not
by empowering one unaccountable individual
with such a crucial task. I look forward to
continuing to work with my colleagues to
advancing commonsense policies that will
enhance accountability and transparency at
the CFPB to ensure their actions do not
come at the expense of Fifth District
families and small businesses.
