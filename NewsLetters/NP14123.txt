News from Representative Richard Nugent
Dear Friends,
As you probably know by now, the House has passed a bipartisan bill to
try to fix the "if you like your healthcare, you can keep it" problem.
It's not a perfect solution. This bill will only buy another year for
people who like their current coverage, but it's better than the
current situation. As you've probably heard, in the state of California
alone, more than a million people have been notified that their health
insurance is being cancelled.
As has been amply reported, the President said repeatedly (some 23
times between 2008 and 2010), and I quote, "If you like your doctor,
you will be able to keep your doctor. Period. If you like your health
care plan, your will be able to keep your health care plan. Period. No
one will take it away. No matter what."
Where I come from, your word means something. It means everything. It
goes without saying that on a lot of different levels, I think the
President's healthcare law is an enormous mistake. But separate and
apart from that, I think the federal government has a responsibility to
follow through on promises made to the American people.
The President's apology to the American people last Thursday was long
overdue. But actions speak louder than words. And when the President
announces that he wants to change the policy and then turns around and
threatens to veto a legislative fix offered by the House, I think we
have a serious problem. We also have a serious problem with this
seemingly endless string of executive orders either waiving, ignoring,
or changing parts of the law. This is way beyond what he has the
authority to do. Congress has the authority and the responsibility to
make and fix laws. The Constitution doesn't give the President the
ability to rewrite laws as he sees fit. The bill that the House passed
last Friday was supported by 39 Democrats. It's not a crazy partisan
bill. It's a partial solution to the problem that the President created
when he told the American people (and continued telling them even after
the bill was signed into law) that they could keep their insurance if
they liked it. He gave them his word.
I'm not sure how all of this is going to shake out, but it's clear that
this is just the beginning. Each and every day, I'm hearing from
individuals who are experiencing changes to their coverage and the cost
for that coverage. It is our responsibility to continue trying to work
together to protect people from undue and unintended harm. I sincerely
hope that the President will join us in that effort. Words alone aren't
enough anymore.
That's all from Washington for now.
I hope you all have a safe and
Happy Thanksgiving.
And if there is anything I can do to be of
service, please let me know.
Sincerely,
Rich Nugent
Member of Congress

News
from
Representative
Richard
Nugent
Dear
Friends,
As
you
probably
know
by
now,
the
House
has
passed
a
bipartisan
bill
to
try
to
fix
the
&#8220;if
you
like
your
healthcare,
you
can
keep
it&#8221;
problem.
It&#8217;s
not
a
perfect
solution.
This
bill
will
only
buy
another
year
for
people
who
like
their
current
coverage,
but
it&#8217;s
better
than
the
current
situation.
As
you&#8217;ve
probably
heard,
in
the
state
of
California
alone,
more
than
a
million
people
have
been
notified
that
their
health
insurance
is
being
cancelled.
As
has
been
amply
reported,
the
President
said
repeatedly
(some
23
times
between
2008
and
2010),
and
I
quote,
&#8220;If
you
like
your
doctor,
you
will
be
able
to
keep
your
doctor.
Period.
If
you
like
your
health
care
plan,
your
will
be
able
to
keep
your
health
care
plan.
Period.
No
one
will
take
it
away.
No
matter
what.&#8221;
Where
I
come
from,
your
word
means
something.
It
means
everything.
It
goes
without
saying
that
on
a
lot
of
different
levels,
I
think
the
President&#8217;s
healthcare
law
is
an
enormous
mistake.
But
separate
and
apart
from
that,
I
think
the
federal
government
has
a
responsibility
to
follow
through
on
promises
made
to
the
American
people.
The
President&#8217;s
apology
to
the
American
people
last
Thursday
was
long
overdue.
But
actions
speak
louder
than
words.
And
when
the
President
announces
that
he
wants
to
change
the
policy
and
then
turns
around
and
threatens
to
veto
a
legislative
fix
offered
by
the
House,
I
think
we
have
a
serious
problem.
We
also
have
a
serious
problem
with
this
seemingly
endless
string
of
executive
orders
either
waiving,
ignoring,
or
changing
parts
of
the
law.
This
is
way
beyond
what
he
has
the
authority
to
do.
Congress
has
the
authority
and
the
responsibility
to
make
and
fix
laws.
The
Constitution
doesn&#8217;t
give
the
President
the
ability
to
rewrite
laws
as
he
sees
fit.
The
bill
that
the
House
passed
last
Friday
was
supported
by
39
Democrats.
It&#8217;s
not
a
crazy
partisan
bill.
It&#8217;s
a
partial
solution
to
the
problem
that
the
President
created
when
he
told
the
American
people
(and
continued
telling
them
even
after
the
bill
was
signed
into
law)
that
they
could
keep
their
insurance
if
they
liked
it.
He
gave
them
his
word.
I&#8217;m
not
sure
how
all
of
this
is
going
to
shake
out,
but
it&#8217;s
clear
that
this
is
just
the
beginning.
Each
and
every
day,
I&#8217;m
hearing
from
individuals
who
are
experiencing
changes
to
their
coverage
and
the
cost
for
that
coverage.
It
is
our
responsibility
to
continue
trying
to
work
together
to
protect
people
from
undue
and
unintended
harm.
I
sincerely
hope
that
the
President
will
join
us
in
that
effort.
Words
alone
aren&#8217;t
enough
anymore.
That's
all
from
Washington
for
now.
I
hope
you
all
have
a
safe
and
Happy
Thanksgiving.
And
if
there
is
anything
I
can
do
to
be
of
service,
please
let
me
know.
Sincerely, Rich
Nugent Member
of
Congress
