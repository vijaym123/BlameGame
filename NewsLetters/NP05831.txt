David -- This is your last chance to TRIPLE-MATCH your donation before tonight&rsquo;s midnight deadline.
TRIPLE-MATCH STATUS:
ACTIVE
until 11:59pm
There could NOT be a better time to do it:
Control of Congress is at stake.
The latest polls show we&rsquo;re in a dead-heat.
But we&rsquo;re getting pummeled with Republican attacks.
That is why President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Nancy Pelosi have been emailing you. This is an all hands on deck moment. We still need 4 donors from 60659 zip code
to TRIPLE-MATCH their gift by midnight if we want any chance of victory in the election. David, can you help us out before tonight&rsquo;s deadline? MIDNIGHT DEADLINE: All Donations In Response To This Email Triple-Matched! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
