May 30, 2014
Dear Friend,
Whether I'm home in Rhode Island or working in Washington, my top
priority is serving my constituents.
This week I worked in Washington
and Rhode Island to keep our communities safe from gangs and gun
violence, renew unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed,
support advanced manufacturing, and honor our nation's veterans.
I'd
like to share a few updates about my work with you.
Keeping our Communities Safe
Preventing gun violence should be an issue where Republicans and
Democrats find common ground and work toward practical solutions to
keep our families and communities safe.
The recent tragedy in Santa
Barbara is another reminder that we need to do more to ensure weapons
don't get into the hands of dangerous individuals. Today, I introduced
the End the Purchase of Firearms by Dangerous Individuals Act
to help keep guns away from individuals who a mental health
professional has determined poses a serious threat to themselves or
others.
My legislation would provide a mechanism to allow mental
health professionals to report these individuals into the FBI's
National Instant Criminal Background Check System to help make our
families and communities safe. Importantly, this bill was developed
with local mental health professionals in order to ensure it protects
patients' privacy, establishes a robust appeals process, and implements
important liability protections for mental health professionals.
As a founding member of Mayor's Against Illegal Guns and a Member of
the House Judiciary Committee, I recognize the urgent need to enact
common sense gun safety laws and I will continue working in Washington
to advance legislation that will help law enforcement protect our
communities.
Supporting Out-of-Work Americans
This week I unveiled my third Faces of the Unemployed poster
to pressure House Speaker John Boehner to allow a vote to renew
unemployment insurance for millions of struggling Americans.
It has
been 53 days now since the U.S. Senate passed bipartisan legislation to
renew this vital lifeline and for 53 days House Speaker John Boehner
has been the only thing standing in the way of restoring this critical
safety net.
In less than two days the Senate bill will expire
delivering another devastating blow to the long-term unemployed. The
Faces of the Unemployed are not invisible and they deserve a vote.
Supporting Rhode Island Manufacturers
This week I toured Okonite Company's facility in Cumberland
as part of my
"Congress at your Company" series.
This facility, which produces
cables for X-ray machines and power lines, supports 90 jobs and I was
pleased to discuss their plans to expand operations in our state.
In addition to meeting with employees and executives during this tour,
I had the opportunity to discuss my work in Washington to support Rhode
Island's manufacturing sector. Last week, I introduced the 21st Century
Buy American Act to modernize decades-old Buy American standards and
help create new manufacturing jobs in the United States.
That same
week, the U.S. House of Representatives approved an amendment I offered
to the National Defense Authorization Act to help increase
opportunities for American manufactures to sell their goods overseas.
Honoring America's Veterans
On Tuesday, I had the opportunity to meet with Rhode Island veterans
at the Captain Elwood J. Euart Post 602 Veterans of Foreign Wars hall
in Pawtucket to discuss recent events surrounding the U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs.
It was an honor to meet with Rhode Island veterans to discuss their
experiences with the VA and to remember the brave men and women in
uniform who made the ultimate sacrifice defending our nation. Our
veterans deserve the highest quality healthcare and these long delays
in scheduling and processing the benefits they've earned are completely
unacceptable. I will continue working with my colleagues to hold those
responsible accountable and to fix the VA.
As always, if you or someone you know has any questions or concerns,
call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at
David.Cicilline@mail.house.gov

Dear

Whether

This

I

in
our

In

to
meeting

during
this

I
had
the

to
discuss
my
work
in
Washington
to

Rhode
Island&#8217;s
manufacturing
sector.

I

Honoring

I

veterans
at

in
Pawtucket

the
U.S.

It
was
an
honor
to
meet

discuss
their

with
the
VA
and
to
remember
the
brave
men
and

who
made
the
ultimate

Our

deserve
the
highest
quality
healthcare
and
these
long

in
scheduling

they&#8217;ve

are

I
