Friend,
Today marks one month until Election Day, and we have some startling news:
This Monday, John Boehner is coming to Sacramento to fundraise for Doug Ose.
First, Boehner handpicked Ose to run for this seat.
Then, he and the NRCC committed over $3 million to run negative attack ads against Ami.
Now, he&#39;s right here in our backyard. This Monday, John Boehner is coming to Sacramento to fundraise for Doug Ose.
Boehner is bringing his DC money with him - a lot of it. We have to respond, immediately.
Click here to give $5, $10, or whatever you can, to our Emergency Response Fund.
They&#39;re playing hard ball, and if we don&#39;t step up, we may lose this seat in November.
John Boehner wants his good friend Doug Ose to join him back in Congress -- and he&#39;s coming to town to ensure his man wins this seat.
If we don&#39;t respond, that&#39;s EXACTLY what will happen - help us with a contribution of $5 or more to our Emergency Response Fund. Click here, right now.
Thanks.
Team Bera
PS - The fact that Boehner is flying all the way to Sacramento to host a high dollar fundraiser for Ose shows you how tight this race is-- they think they can win.
And without you, they might.
