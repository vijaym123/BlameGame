This is the final weekend to
"like" my Facebook page
as part of a digital communications contest that will allow us to continue our conversations on Facebook. Sunday, July 20, 2014, at 11:59 PM is the final minute for a Congressional competition to determine the district with the most plugged-in residents. Ohio's Third Congressional District is already in the top-third, and rising fast.
