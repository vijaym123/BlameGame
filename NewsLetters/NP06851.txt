Focusing on
Federal Funding for Critical Research
I hosted a town
hall forum on the importance of
National Institutes of Health
(NIH) funding
for
critical and lifesaving
research
at the KU Edwards Campus last Tuesday. It was exciting to
hear the thoughtful questions from the audience and insightful remarks
from the local, regional, and national experts who served on the
panel.
Learn more about what Congressman Yoder discussed
during his NIH town hall by clicking the image above or
here .
It is clear this research is vital not only to those
fighting life-altering diseases and disabilities , but also to
those local universities and biomedical companies here in the district
that are
working to discover new scientific
breakthroughs
every day.
I appreciate the work that
Dr. Christopher Austin, the
Director of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences at the
NIH,
and his team do to find cures and save
lives.
A
special thank you to
Leesa Gabel, cancer survivor and Regional
Leader for the
LIVESTRONG Foundation , for participating on the panel. Leesas
strength, courage, and determination is truly
inspiring.
KCK Congressional Forum
I enjoyed
stopping by Congressional Forum, hosted by the
Kansas City Kansas Area Chamber of
Commerce ,
to discuss several important issues and give an update on
legislation currently before Congress.
ALS Association Keith Worthington Chapter
Thank
you to Nancy Lindquist, Care Services Specialist at the
ALS Association Keith Worthington
Chapter , for stopping by my district office in Overland Park to
share the latest developments in our fight against
Lou Gherigs Disease . The ALS Ice
Bucket Challenge is sweeping the nation, increasing private donations
at an astonishing rate. I will continue to work at the federal level
to do our part and
strengthen the search for treatment and a
cure .
I support efforts to bring new treatments to
patients
sooner
and look forward to the day when
we have a
cure for this progressive neurodegenerative
disease .
Alliance for Childhood
Education
Studies show that
early educational investment
in the
lives of children at risk, before Kindergarten,
produces great
value in their lives
and our communities as they grow to
become productive citizens. Extensive economic analyses have demonstrated
that when dollars are invested in
early learning
programs , they provide a 17 percent return on the initial investment each
year, according to
Alliance
for Childhood Education . As a recipient of the
Head Start 2012 Kansas State Childrens
Champion Award , I understand the importance of ensuring
our children have the
educational resources and opportunities
necessary for success available to them at a very young
age.
Thank you to Torree Pederson and Erin Brower, President/CEO and
Vice-President of
Alliance for
Childhood Education (ACE)
for sharing with me their work
to improve early childhood education.
Johnson and Miami County
Farm Bureau Legislative Tour
I joined several state
legislators from Johnson and Miami County at the
Johnson County Farm Bureau / Miami County Farm Burea u
Legislative picnic
and tour last week. We toured
the
Brunker family farming operation in Olathe
and
visited about many agriculture issues facing our state and country. As
a
fifth-generation Kansan who grew up on a
farm
and
Vice Chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on
Agriculture , it is very important to me that our nations agriculture
programs are adequately funded. We must ensure our
vital food,
animal, and plant programs are maintained , as well as
provide resources for
rural development, farm services,
and
marketplace oversight.
Thank you to the Johnson and Miami County
Kansas Farm Bureaus
for
this opportunity.
KU Clinical Research Center
After
the town hall on Tuesday discussing the important role of the
NIH in funding life-saving research , I was especially pleased
to tour the
Clinical and
Translational Science Unit (CTSU) at the KU Clinical Research Center
with Dr. Christopher Austin, Director of the National Center
for Advancing Translational Sciences from the National Institutes of
Health (NIH). The CTSU, along with the
National Center for
Advancing Translational Sciences , is all about getting
more treatments to more patients more
efficiently .
Thank you to
Dr. Jeff Burns
and
Dr.
Raymond Perez
for the tour and description of all the exciting
research taking place right here in Fairway.
Greater Kansas City
Chamber of Commerce
I had a great time at the
Greater Kansas City Chamber of
Commerce
iKC: The Unconference
event
Thursday morning with Kansas City Mayor Sly James. I always enjoy speaking
with
local entrepreneurs

Kansas City grow as a leading innovative and startup
community . We had a great conversation about the
Start-up Act 3.0 , the need for
greater access to technology and research, and my bill, the
Email Privacy

Plant
I visited the
General
Motors Fairfax Assembly Plant

hinder business and job

#BackToSchool
Families across Kansas are
heading
#BackToSchool , but the
cost of heading
back to school
doesnt stop at a new backpack and school
supplies. In fact, according to the
U.S.
Department of Agricultures annual Expenditures on Children and Families
report ,
the average cost of raising a child born in 2013
is $245,340 . And once you equate inflation
that total rises
to
$304,480 . The House has passed
numerous
bills to ease the financial burden of educational expenses ,
such as
H.R. 1406, the Working
Families Flexibility Act of 2013 . It doesnt stop there
we are still working on other bills such as the
Child Tax Credit Improvement Act
and the
Student and Family Tax
Simplification Act.
#StandwithIsrael
Im proud to
#StandwithIsrael.
The ongoing violence and acts of terrorism
against Israel is heart wrenching. Ive cosigned a
House resolution
stating our support
for the unequivocal
right of Israel to defend itself.
The resolution passed unanimously. I remain greatly concerned and will
continue to
#Stand
withIsrael.
#StuckInTheSenate
There are more than
350
bills currently #StuckInTheSenate
sitting on Harry Reids
desk collecting dust because he refuses to bring them to the Senate
floor.
Of the more than 350 bills, 90 percent were passed with
bipartisan support and at least 40 are jobs bills.
The gridlock
is not bipartisan. Its time to put politics aside and work to
find
long-term bipartisan solutions to the issues facing our
country . Senate, its time to act.
