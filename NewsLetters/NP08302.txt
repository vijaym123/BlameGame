Dear Friend, When was the last time we went a full month without a member of the Tea Party calling for Congress to impeach the President?
The Tea Party has no real reason to impeach the President. They just want to gin up their base and prevent sensible lawmakers from actually making progress for the American people. This year, Republicans are six seats away from completing their takeover of Congress. We can&rsquo;t let them win this seat -- help us fight back with a $5 contribution before the FEC filing deadline.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
There&rsquo;s a series of bills that have been passed by the Senate that are just waiting for action from the House, and even more good ideas that are being stifled by Tea Partiers in both chambers. I&rsquo;ve introduced measures to limit gun violence and combat climate change, both of which are issues that need urgent attention.
But the Tea Party isn&rsquo;t interested in governing, and they&rsquo;re certainly not interested in coming to a compromise with anyone outside their own echo chamber.
It&rsquo;s ludicrous -- the Tea Party model is no way to run a country. We need your help to make sure the Tea Party doesn&rsquo;t take over the Senate -- contribute $5 to get us closer to our $36,000 FEC deadline goal.
Thank you for your support.
