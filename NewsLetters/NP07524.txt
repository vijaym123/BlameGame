HIGHLIGHTS IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
[cid:image003.jpg@01CFA831.259D1870]
President Obama signed the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act on Tuesday. The new law authorizes a 17 percent increase in three major job training programs over the next six years and was a product of the Education & the Workforce Committee where I sit. Replacing WIA, the Workforce Investment Act, the new law aims to train workers in the skills employers seek and to give local Workforce Investment Boards and Governors more flexibility in how funding is used. The increased funding coupled with more local control should help the Northern Marianas' on-going efforts to train U.S. workers to take over jobs now held by CW workers.

The new Assistant Secretary for Insular Areas, Esther Kia'aina, was on Capitol Hill this week. Ms. Kia'aina previously served as Chief of Staff to Guam Congressman Robert Underwood (D) and Hawai'i Congressman Ed Case (D), so she understands the need for a working relationship between congressional offices and her Office of Insular Affairs and the importance of good communication among all of us who serve Pacific Islanders.
$1.8 million awarded to Head Start - 462 Northern Marianas children will benefit from the $1,837,675 our Public School System was allocated this week for its Head Start program. Head Start prepares children for school by giving them comprehensive health, education, and nutrition services that enhance social and cognitive development. The program also involves parents in their children's learning and encourages parents to make progress on their own literacy and employment goals. Congratulations to PSS.
