David --
Despite the burden of the most obstructionist and dysfunctional Congress in history&hellip;Despite the burden of taking office in the midst of the worst financial crisis in 70 years,
President Obama has achieved incredible progress for the United States.
Conservatives will lie through their teeth trying to deny it, but there&rsquo;s simply no arguing with these numbers:
President Obama Took Office (January 2009)
Today
7,949
The Dow Jones Index
17,635

Unemployment

GDP Growth

Consumer Confidence

That&rsquo;s what a successful presidency looks like. It&rsquo;s why Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman issued this forceful endorsement:
&ldquo;Obama has emerged as one of the most consequential and, yes, successful presidents in American history.&rdquo;
David, his work isn&rsquo;t over. And neither is ours. Will you add your name now and say that you&rsquo;re still standing with President Obama in his final two years in office? Sign your name:
