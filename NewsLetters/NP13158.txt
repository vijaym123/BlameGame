Dear Friend,
A new year is always an exciting time. It's an opportunity for us to
reflect on the past and look with optimism towards the next twelve
months.
It is a true honor to represent Minnesota's 6th Congressional District,
and I spent this past year crisscrossing Central Minnesota meeting with
constituents, listening to their comments and concerns, and answering
their questions.
In a St. Cloud Times op-ed
, I look back on what was a successful and
productive 2013. A few highlights:
*	My Minnesota staff and I organized or attended more than 700
meetings across the district
*	More than 20,000 responses have been sent to constituents who
wrote to or called my offices
*	President Obama signed into law the Uninterrupted Scholars Act
, which I helped champion as
co-chair of the Foster Youth Caucus, the largest bi-partisan caucus in
Congress
*	Once the IRS scandal broke, I gathered Tea Party leaders from
across the country for a press conference
with Senators McConnell, Cruz, Lee
and Paul and dozens of House members
*	I was selected by Speaker Boehner to join the House delegation
attending Margaret Thatcher's funeral

New Year's Resolutions for Washington
Reject the push for amnesty. I joined my colleagues in sending a letter
to President Obama rejecting his push
for amnesty now, border security never. Amnesty will hurt middle class
jobs, wages and benefits and won't address the danger of an open border.
Repeal Obamacare. With each passing day the Obamacare train wreck keeps
unraveling, and we must continue fighting to scrap this government
takeover. In 2013, the House passed my bill
to repeal Obamacare, and it's time to replace it
with patient-centered, market-oriented solutions
.
Promote innovation and job creation. In 2013, the House passed pro-job
growth bills on energy, education, health care, agriculture, and more,
despite President Obama's unwillingness
to work with us.
Advocate for vulnerable youth. I am a co-chair of the Adoption Caucus
and the Foster Care Caucus, two of the largest and most bi-partisan
caucuses in Congress. In 2014, we must continue to work towards a
resolution on the Russian adoption ban
, so that
families like the Thomas Family of Minnesota
can finalize their
pending adoptions and bring their children home. Every child, regardless
of nationality, deserves the chance at a forever family.
War on Poverty Anniversary
Wednesday was the fiftieth anniversary of President Lyndon B. Johnson's
State of the Union address that inspired legislation unofficially known
as the "War on Poverty," which has proven to be a failure.
America has always been a nation where hard work and creativity pay off,
where upward mobility was the aspired goal. Yet the War on Poverty has
created new generations of Americans who look to the government itself
as a parent, while hope of living the American Dream has been smothered
in the process. For more on this, click here.
Obamacare Security Breaches
Since the roll out of the Obamacare exchanges, several reports have come
out warning that consumers' personal information, including addresses,
social security numbers and health records, were vulnerable
.
Today, in response to the administration's failure to properly secure
the Obamacare site, the House passed the Health Exchange Security and
Transparency Act of 2014
with broad bipartisan support. The bill requires HHS to notify
individuals if their personal information has been stolen or unlawfully
accessed through an Obamacare exchange.
