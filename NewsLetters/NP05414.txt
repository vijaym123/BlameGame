The
Presidents Broken Promises
Continue to Harm Virginians
Dear Friend,
I spent last week traveling to the
communities along Route 29 visiting small
businesses to talk with their owners and
employees about how federal policies are
impacting their ability to succeed and
grow. We made a wide variety of stops in
Danville, Gretna, Altavista, Rustburg,
Lovingston, Charlottesville, Ruckersville,
Madison, and Warrenton, where we discussed
a range of issues from taxes to energy to
regulations. But at almost every visit, the
impacts of the Presidents healthcare
law were the top concern facing small
businesses and their employees, as the law
is hindering their ability to create more
jobs and is harming their employees.
One employer near Lynchburg told me he
would like to expand his business and
create more jobs but cannot afford to
comply with the extra healthcare mandates
that kick in when a company grows to 50
employees. Another business explained how
the premiums for their employees are going
up nearly 50 percent this year despite no
changes in what their plan covers. Nearly
everyone I talked with expressed concerns
about the continued growth of premiums,
co-pays, and deductibles. These cost
increases reduce take home pay for the
employees, and most small businesses do not
have the margins necessary to absorb higher
and higher costs, much less try to grow and
hire more employees.
Evidence continues to mount
demonstrating that the Presidents
healthcare law has had devastating effects
on our families and our small businesses
not just in Virginia, but across the
country.
Recent
business surveys
by regional Federal
Reserve Banks indicated that employers are
cutting hours down from full time to part
time to cope with added health care costs.
Another
recent study
found that the law is
drastically reducing take-home pay for the
employees of small businesses and has
contributed to more than 350,000 job losses
nationwide.
Our Main Street businesses are the
backbone of our local economies and have
the potential to be our most dynamic job
creators. Instead, they are forced to
comply with bureaucratic red tape from a
misguided law that was forced upon them.
These regulations are undoubtedly stifling
desperately-needed job creation in the
Fifth District, which is unacceptable when
some of our localities have unemployment as
high as ten percent.
Hearing from these small business owners
about how these policies burden them and
their employees reinforces my resolve to
repeal this very flawed law and replace it
with real health reform that does not
destroy jobs or reduce wages. House
Republicans remain focused on creating
solutions that are patient-centered and
market-based, putting the power in the
hands of individuals and families, not the
federal government, to make health care
decisions on behalf of themselves and their
families. I look forward to continuing to
work with my colleagues to achieve
meaningful healthcare reform that works for
the American people and our economy.
