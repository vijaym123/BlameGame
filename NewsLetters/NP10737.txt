Crossing Paths with the Red Sox in Washington!
Hi Everyone!
I hope you all had a great weekend. I spent last week meeting with
constituents and advocating for New Hampshire small businesses. It was
wonderful to welcome so many Granite Staters to Washington. Hearing
your ideas and stories is one of the best parts of my job, and I look
forward to continuing to discuss issues important to New Hampshire in
the coming weeks and months.
Meeting the Red Sox in our Nation's Capital
Last Tuesday, I was incredibly excited to meet the Boston Red Sox when
President Obama welcomed them to the White House. As a lifelong New
Englander and Red Sox fan, it was quite a unique opportunity to meet
the team we spend the spring, summer, and fall all rooting for. It was
wonderful to see members of both parties put aside their differences
and enjoy each other's company, while celebrating one of our country's
greatest pastimes. Hopefully 2014 will be our year!
Focusing on Infrastructure and Education
On Friday, I was proud to offer an amendment on the House floor that
emphasizes the importance of investing in education, infrastructure,
and other programs that help hardworking New Hampshire families
succeed. While we must cut waste and spend responsibly, it is essential
that we protect important investments that support the continued growth
of our economy and lead to job creation. Watch the video of my speech

During my meeting with the Nature Conservancy
Hearing From Environmental Advocates
On Wednesday, I met with the folks from the Nature Conservancy to
discuss a number of important environmental issues. They presented me
with a beautiful photograph in recognition of my advocacy for the lands
and water of the Connecticut River. Last year, I joined my colleagues
in sending a letter to Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell urging
her to visit the Connecticut River and to support the National Blueways
Program. In New Hampshire, we are blessed with incredible mountains,
lakes, forests, and rivers. Growing up, I cherished spending time on
Newfound Lake and enjoying all four beautiful seasons in the North
Country. As your Representative, I will continue to work on behalf of
the Granite State's natural environment.
Granite Staters on the Cutting Edge
On Wednesday, I participated in a Small Business Committee hearing on
the impact of bitcoin and other virtual currencies on small businesses.
One of the witnesses was Dr. L. Michael Couvillion, an Associate
Professor of Economics at Plymouth State University, who testified
about the possible benefits and obstacles presented by the growth of
bitcoin. While this technology is still being developed and defined,
Bitcoin's popularity in New Hampshire is rapidly expanding and Dr.
Couvillion's research is helping us understand this new and exciting
trend, which could impact our state's economy. Granite State
entrepreneurs and businesses are on the cutting edge of technology,
driving our economy forward into the 21st Century.
Helping Granite Staters
Earlier this year, I was contacted by the Haynes Library Association in
Alexandria, NH, about an issue it was having with the Internal Revenue
Service. The Association had lost its 501(c)(3) tax exempt status,
which made the future of the library very uncertain. My office worked
with the IRS to expedite this process, and on March 31, 2014, the
application was approved. If my office may ever be of assistance with a
problem you are facing, please contact my staff at 603-226-1002 so we
may help you resolve your problem or get you the information you need.
Have a wonderful week and thanks for everything you do to make New
Hampshire such a great place to live!
