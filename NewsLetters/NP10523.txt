Capitol Update
Congressman Cook Cosponsors Bill to Combat Unemployment by
Strengthening American Manufacturing
Last week, Congressman Cook became a cosponsor to a bill that will
rejuvenate American manufacturing and create good jobs. H.R. 2996, the
Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act (RAMI), would
establish manufacturing institutes, known as the Network for
Manufacturing Innovation (NMI). This important jobs bill would help
ensure that American workers receive the training they need to compete
for good-paying manufacturing jobs.
NMI is a public-private partnership that connects the federal
government, local governments, universities, and research institutes to
industry and businesses with the goal of training the workforce of
tomorrow. This bill aims to ensure the skills learned before entry to
the workforce are as commercially relevant as possible.
The bill accomplishes this by creating as many as fifteen Innovation
Manufacturing Institutes across the nation to train and match job
seekers with vital regional industries that are indispensable to
American economic growth. Rather than encouraging workers to enter
risky and unproven industries, this legislation focuses on proven
industries with a strong commercial market. NMI will require a
significant non-federal cost match to ensure that taxpayer dollars and
private sector investment hold an equal stake in this program.
Government handouts aren't the answer. Providing people the opportunity
for good-paying jobs is the only long-term solution to our nation's
unemployment crisis. Job seekers need 21st century skills to succeed in
the 21st century economy. This legislation will equip job seekers with
the abilities that employers need.
Congressman Cook Cosponsors Bills to Sanction Hezbollah, Block
Terrorist from Entering the United States
Last Wednesday, Congressman Cook cosponsored two bills that will
protect the United States from Iranian terrorism. The first of these is
the H.R. 4411, the Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act of
2014, and the second is H.R. 4357, which would prevent terrorists from
entering the U.S. as U.N. Ambassadors.
H.R. 4411, the Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act, will
deal a blow to one of the world's most dangerous terrorist
organizations by imposing sanctions on their finances and financiers.
In addition to expanding financial sector sanctions against Hezbollah,
this bill would strengthen America's ability to go after the
counterfeiting and narcotics operations it uses for funding.
Additionally, it would cripple al-Manar, a television station that
incites violence and broadcasts pro-Hezbollah propaganda.
H.R. 4357 would block terrorists from using diplomatic credentials to
enter the United States. This bill became necessary when Iran announced
its intention to name Hamid Aboutalebi, a known terrorist, as its
ambassador to the United Nations. Aboutalebi was a member of the Muslim
Students Following the Imam's Line, the group that stormed the American
Embassy in Tehran and took 54 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Before 9/11, Hezbollah, which is a terrorist arm of the Iranian
Revolutionary Guard, was responsible for more American deaths than any
other terrorist organization. It is absolutely essential that the
United States does everything we can to protect America and our allies.
Whether they're carrying an AK-47 or carrying a diplomatic passport,
terrorists have no place in the United States.
A Message from Congressman Cook on Tax Day
For most Americans, tax day is an annoyance that leaves us feeling
empty. For months leading up to today, businesses and families across
the Eighth District have sat down to review their receipts, earnings,
and finances as they prepared their 2013 income taxes. According to the
national Taxpayer Advocate, Americans spend $168 billion and more than
six billion hours each year complying with our complicated tax code.
Each year, April 15 is a reminder that our tax system is overly complex
and burdensome. It distorts economic behavior and hinders U.S. economic
competitiveness. Studies suggest that tax reform will not only make our
economy more competitive, but will also help to address our
ever-expanding budget deficit by promoting economic growth. This will
ultimately raise the federal tax receipts even at lower tax rates.
The last time Congress enacted comprehensive tax reform was in 1986.
Since then our tax code has grown considerably and has become a complex
maze of special interest provisions and temporary tax measures.
Unfortunately, rather than moving forward with an agenda that will
stimulate the economy, President Obama and Senate Democrats continued
the failed economic policies of the past five years. In President
Obama's Fiscal Year 2015 budget request, he proposed $1 trillion worth
of tax increases. This request comes as the nonpartisan Congressional
Budget Office reports that even without additional taxes the Gross
Domestic Product will remain at higher than historic averages for the
next ten years. This is simply unacceptable.
One particularly disturbing area of taxation is the death tax. The
death imposes a tax on wealth transfers upon death. Congress
temporarily phased out the death tax in 2001 as part of the Estate and
Gift Tax Relief Act (Bush tax cuts), but it was resurrected in 2011.
Taxable estates are currently charged at a fixed rate of 40 percent.
This is a punitive tax that unfairly punishes family farms and small
businesses. They don't have the liquid assets to pay estate tax
liabilities.
Additionally, these assets have already been taxed at
some point, whether it was income, a home sale, or otherwise. The death
tax equates to double taxation. We need to repeal it completely, once
and for all. This is why I remain a proud co-sponsor of H.R. 2429, the
Death Tax Repeal Act.
I've said it once and I'll say it again, Washington doesn't having a
taxing problem, it has a spending problem. We cannot tax our way to
prosperity. Today, more than ever, reminds us that the time is now to
take the bold steps needed to unleash America's potential.

Congressman
Cook
Cosponsors
Bills
to
Sanction
Hezbollah,
Block
Terrorist
from
Entering
the
United
States
Last
Wednesday,
Congressman
Cook
cosponsored
two
bills
that
will
protect
the
United
States
from
Iranian
terrorism.
The
first
of
these
is
the
H.R.
4411,
the
Hezbollah
International
Financing
Prevention
Act
of
2014,
and
the
second
is
H.R.
4357,
which
would
prevent
terrorists
from
entering
the
U.S.
as
U.N.
Ambassadors.
H.R.
4411,
the
Hezbollah
International
Financing
Prevention
Act,
will
deal
a
blow
to
one
of
the
world&#8217;s
most
dangerous
terrorist
organizations
by
imposing
sanctions
on
their
finances
and
financiers.
In
addition
to
expanding
financial
sector
sanctions
against
Hezbollah,
this
bill
would
strengthen
America&#8217;s
ability
to
go
after
the
counterfeiting
and
narcotics
operations
it
uses
for
funding.
Additionally,
it
would
cripple
al-Manar,
a
television
station
that
incites
violence
and
broadcasts
pro-Hezbollah
propaganda.
H.R.
4357
would
block
terrorists
from
using
diplomatic
credentials
to
enter
the
United
States.
This
bill
became
necessary
when
Iran
announced
its
intention
to
name
Hamid
Aboutalebi,
a
known
terrorist,
as
its
ambassador
to
the
United
Nations.
Aboutalebi
was
a
member
of
the
Muslim
Students
Following
the
Imam&#8217;s
Line,
the
group
that
stormed
the
American
Embassy
in
Tehran
and
took
54
Americans
hostage
for
444
days.
Before
9/11,
Hezbollah,
which
is
a
terrorist
arm
of
the
Iranian
Revolutionary
Guard,
was
responsible
for
more
American
deaths
than
any
other
terrorist
organization.
It
is
absolutely
essential
that
the
United
States
does
everything
we
can
to
protect
America
and
our
allies.
Whether
they&#8217;re
carrying
an
AK-47
or
carrying
a
diplomatic
passport,
terrorists
have
no
place
in
the
United
States.
A
Message
from
Congressman
Cook
on
Tax
Day
For
most
Americans,
tax
day
is
an
annoyance
that
leaves
us
feeling
empty.
For
months
leading
up
to
today,
businesses
and
families
across
the
Eighth
District
have
sat
down
to
review
their
receipts,
earnings,
and
finances
as
they
prepared
their
2013
income
taxes.
According
to
the
national
Taxpayer
Advocate,
Americans
spend
$168
billion
and
more
than
six
billion
hours
each
year
complying
with
our
complicated
tax
code.
Each
year,
April
15
is
a
reminder
that
our
tax
system
is
overly
complex
and
burdensome.
It
distorts
economic
behavior
and
hinders
U.S.
economic
competitiveness.
Studies
suggest
that
tax
reform
will
not
only
make
our
economy
more
competitive,
but
will
also
help
to
address
our
ever-expanding
budget
deficit
by
promoting
economic
growth.
This
will
ultimately
raise
the
federal
tax
receipts
even
at
lower
tax
rates.
The
last
time
Congress
enacted
comprehensive
tax
reform
was
in
1986.
Since
then
our
tax
code
has
grown
considerably
and
has
become
a
complex
maze
of
special
interest
provisions
and
temporary
tax
measures.
Unfortunately,
rather
than
moving
forward
with
an
agenda
that
will
stimulate
the
economy,
President
Obama
and
Senate
Democrats
continued
the
failed
economic
policies
of
the
past
five
years.
In
President
Obama&#8217;s
Fiscal
Year
2015
budget
request,
he
proposed
$1
trillion
worth
of
tax
increases.
This
request
comes
as
the
nonpartisan
Congressional
Budget
Office
reports
that
even
without
additional
taxes
the
Gross
Domestic
Product
will
remain
at
higher
than
historic
averages
for
the
next
ten
years.
This
is
simply
unacceptable.
One
particularly
disturbing
area
of
taxation
is
the
death
tax.
The
death
imposes
a
tax
on
wealth
transfers
upon
death.
Congress
temporarily
phased
out
the
death
tax
in
2001
as
part
of
the
Estate
and
Gift
Tax
Relief
Act
(Bush
tax
cuts),
but
it
was
resurrected
in
2011.
Taxable
estates
are
currently
charged
at
a
fixed
rate
of
40
percent.
This
is
a
punitive
tax
that
unfairly
punishes
family
farms
and
small
businesses.
They
don&#8217;t
have
the
liquid
assets
to
pay
estate
tax
liabilities.
Additionally,
these
assets
have
already
been
taxed
at
some
point,
whether
it
was
income,
a
home
sale,
or
otherwise.
The
death
tax
equates
to
double
taxation.
We
need
to
repeal
it
completely,
once
and
for
all.
This
is
why
I
remain
a
proud
co-sponsor
of
H.R.
2429,
the
Death
Tax
Repeal
Act.
I&#8217;ve
said
it
once
and
I&#8217;ll
say
it
again,
Washington
doesn&#8217;t
having
a
taxing
problem,
it
has
a
spending
problem.
We
cannot
tax
our
way
to
prosperity.
Today,
more
than
ever,
reminds
us
that
the
time
is
now
to
take
the
bold
steps
needed
to
unleash
America&#8217;s
potential.
