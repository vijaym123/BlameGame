David, The National Republican Congressional Committee just launched a disgusting new ad attacking my family to score cheap political points.
It's just another example of the GOP's willingness to say or do anything to retake this seat.
They have no shame, which is why we must win.
But we can only win if we stand up to Boehner's influx of $1.85 million for ads just like this one. David, I&rsquo;m going to fight day and night for the next 27 days to keep your voices in Congress. I hope you&rsquo;ll stand with me.
