Glad to be Home
Dear Friend,
This week was a district work week for the House of Representatives,
which gave me the opportunity to travel around District 4 and speak
with constituents. It's always refreshing to get away from Washington
and hear directly from you. The beautiful weather this week didn't
hurt, either!
Discussing the Issues
I held a town hall in Kingman on Tuesday, another in Lake Havasu City
on Wednesday and one in Yuma on Thursday. We discussed all the hot
issues, including ObamaCare, the national debt and immigration reform.
I enjoy holding town halls because it allows me to discuss the issues
with my constituents. To read an article in the Mohave Valley Daily
News about my town hall in Kingman, click HERE

Lake Havasu City town hall in the Havasu News-Herald. And click HERE

Helping Veterans
I held a veterans forum in Kingman on Wednesday morning. I told those
in attendance that my office is there to help veterans navigate the
federal bureaucracy so that they receive all the services they have
earned in a timely manner. I will continue to make helping veterans one
of my top priorities.
(Rep. Gosar speaking to veterans in Kingman, January 22, 2014)
Fighting for Those Who Protect Us
On Wednesday afternoon, I spoke to the Colorado River Law Enforcement
Association. I told them that we in Congress must do all we can to
support law enforcement professionals in our communities. That includes
fighting for the resources that keep them running. As you may remember,
one of the reasons I voted against the Omnibus Spending Bill was
because it did not include PILT (Payments in Lieu of Taxes) funding,
which Arizona's local communities depend on to provide police and
firefighting services, among other things. I will continue to fight for
PILT and other programs important to our local communities.
(Rep. Gosar addressing the Colorado River Law Enforcement Association,
January 22, 2014)
Honoring a Fallen Hero
On Friday, I was proud to attend the grand opening and dedication
ceremony of a new wind tunnel at Yuma Proving Ground named after Master
Sergeant George A. Bannar, who was killed on August 20, 2013 in
Afghanistan. The new wind tunnel will be used to teach military members
proper free-fall techniques. I know that this new facility and the men
and women who will train there will stand as a testament to the
sacrifice of Master Sergeant Bannar and all of our fallen heroes.
(Rep. Gosar and Master Sgt. Bannar's mother, January 24, 2014).

Protecting the Unborn
Wednesday was the 41st anniversary of Roe v. Wade. As a health care
professional and a father of three wonderful children, I know that life
is a precious gift from God. As an American, I firmly believe that we
must always protect individual rights, including those of unborn
babies. I won't stop fighting until every American, including unborn
babies, are provided their constitutional rights. I'm proud to stand
for life.
Our Country's Future
I had the opportunity to speak with student organizations twice this
week. I'm always happy to talk with young people, as they are this
country's future. On Saturday I spoke to students from a local chapter
of the American Student Dental Association. Then, on Thursday, I met
with the student leadership of Arizona Western College in Yuma. We
talked about jobs, the budget, and the need for a free-market,
patient-centered alternative to ObamaCare. I told both groups that good
legislation isn't Republican or Democrat, it's American.

ObamaCare Malady of the Week
4: that's the number of minutes it took one hacking expert to gain
access to the personal information of 70,000 people on healthcare.gov.
He said he could have accessed more, but stopped after 70,000. Click

to read more.
Did You Know?
Yavapai County is one of Arizona's four original counties. When it was
first created it covered more than 65,000 square miles, making it one
of the largest counties ever created. Eventually it was carved up and
contributed territory to 8 of Arizona's 15 counties.
As always, you can follow everything I am working on in Arizona and
Washington, D.C. through my website (http://gosar.house.gov
) on Twitter @repgosar
, or through Facebook
at Representative Paul Gosar.

Fighting
for
Those
Who
Protect
Us
On
Wednesday
afternoon,
I
spoke
to
the
Colorado
River
Law
Enforcement
Association.
I
told
them
that
we
in
Congress
must
do
all
we
can
to
support
law
enforcement
professionals
in
our
communities.
That
includes
fighting
for
the resources
that
keep
them
running.
As
you
may
remember,
one
of
the
reasons
I
voted
against
the
Omnibus Spending
Bill
was
because
it
did
not
include
PILT
(Payments
in
Lieu
of
Taxes) funding,
which
Arizona's
local
communities depend
on to
provide
police
and
firefighting
services,
among
other
things.
I
will
continue
to
fight
for
PILT
and
other
programs
important
to
our
local
communities.

Protecting
the
Unborn
Wednesday
was the
41st
anniversary
of
Roe
v.
Wade.
As
a
health
care
professional
and
a
father
of
three
wonderful
children,
I
know
that
life
is
a
precious
gift
from
God.
As
an
American,
I
firmly
believe
that
we
must
always
protect
individual
rights,
including
those
of
unborn
babies.
I
won't
stop
fighting
until
every
American,
including
unborn
babies,
are
provided
their
constitutional
rights.
I'm
proud
to
stand
for
life.
Our
Country's
Future
I
had
the
opportunity
to
speak
with
student
organizations
twice
this
week. I'm
always
happy
to
talk
with
young
people, as
they
are
this
country's
future.
On
Saturday
I
spoke
to
students
from
a
local
chapter
of
the
American
Student
Dental
Association. Then,
on
Thursday,
I
met
with
the
student
leadership
of
Arizona
Western
College
in
Yuma.
We
talked
about
jobs,
the
budget,
and
the
need
for
a
free-market,
patient-centered
alternative
to
ObamaCare.
I
told both
groups that
good
legislation
isn't
Republican
or
Democrat,
it's
American.

ObamaCare
Malady
of
the
Week
4:
that's
the
number
of
minutes
it
took
one

to
gain
access
to the
personal
information
of
70,000
people
on
healthcare.gov.

said
he
could

more,
