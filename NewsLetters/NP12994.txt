Dear Friend,
Last month, Congress passed a federal budget for fiscal year 2014. This
bipartisan budget was far from perfect, but it provides us with
certainty about federal spending and sets nationwide priorities for the
upcoming year.
Next year's budget process starts soon, and I value your input!
This
Thursday (Jan 23) I will host an interactive "budget workshop" in
Castro Valley with the Concord Coalition - a nationwide, non-partisan
grassroots organization that educates the public about the different
causes and consequences of federal budget decisions. At this event, you
will have the opportunity to work in small groups to consider a variety
of fiscal policy alternatives and put forth your ideas for improving
the nation's long-term fiscal outlook.
Federal Budget Workshop
Thursday, January 23, 2014
6:00 - 8:00 PM

Please reach out to one of my East Bay offices at 925-460-5100 or

you with federal matters.
