Dear Friends,
Serving Pennsylvania's Third District in the
House of Representatives has been the honor of my lifetime. As the 113th Congress begins its final two months and the 114th Congress prepares to take over, I look
forward to continuing to represent your voices and values in Washington,
and will never stop working to build a better future for Western
Pennsylvania and our great nation.
With a new majority in the U.S. Senate on the horizon, the flood gates of unprecedented legislative action will soon break open, and I look forward to guiding the waters to ensure that Western Pennsylvania is not just fully represented but made stronger and more prosperous.

Sincerely,
Rep. Kelly Celebrates
the 25th Anniversary
of
the Fall of the Berlin Wall
Rep. Kelly issued the following statement today in celebration of the 25th anniversary of the opening of the Berlin Wall, which occurred on November 9, 1989.
"This Sunday marks the silver anniversary of a golden moment for freedom. For an entire generation, the Berlin Wall stood as a deadly barrier between not just West Berlin and East Berlin, but between capitalism and communism, democracy and dictatorship, liberty and tyranny. For decades, it was thought that not only would the wall stay standing forever, but so too would the Soviet Union and the evil system it fostered and forced upon so many. Yet in November of 1989, the unthinkable occurred as the front door to the Iron Curtain finally swung open and the long patience, protests, and prayers of millions were finally answered. The immediate months and years that followed were indeed great ones for freedom and for all mankind, from the reunification of Germany, to the fall of the Soviet Empire, to the liberation of a half-billion people from Marxist chains, to the emergence of the United States as the world's singular superpower. I join all Americans in honor and commemoration of this wondrous historical occasion.
"While the Cold War now rests in history's rear view mirror, we must remember that nothing about the West's victory in that struggle was inevitable. After World War II, freedom's fight against communism was far from easy, but the constant source of strength against the Soviets was unmistakable: confident American leadership. From Truman to Kennedy to Reagan, our finest moments came when our leaders were unafraid to defend our values, stand by our allies, and declare our cause's righteousness in the clearest of terms. Whether the world was hearing ' Ich bin ein Berliner! ' or '
Tear down this wall!' , when America spoke and acted with strength, our friends were encouraged and our foes were on notice. Ronald Reagan had it exactly right when he defined the only acceptable outcome against Communist Russia as, 'We win, they lose.' His prediction that 'the West won't contain communism, it will transcend communism' was made true thanks to the courage behind his conviction.
"As we celebrate this upcoming anniversary, let us remind ourselves that people yearning to breathe free throughout the world still depend on America to lead with resolve, and that standing firm against those who oppress and terrorize is simply never optional."
NOTE:
Rep. Kelly is the co-chairman of the Congressional Caucus on Korea, which serves to strengthen and uphold U.S.-Republic of Korea (South Korea) relations especially in the face of increasingly menacing behavior by the communist dictatorship of North Korea. It recognizes South Korea as an international model for democracy and free enterprise and one of the greatest U.S. foreign policy success stories in the post-World War II era.
