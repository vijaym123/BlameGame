Dear Hoosier,
Today we released our 2014
annual report . This report chronicles my legislative and bipartisan efforts, travel around Indiana, and work on behalf of Hoosiers like you, in addition to other highlights from my second year as U.S. Senator for Indiana. Also, we released six video retrospectives:
&ldquo;What Did Joe Do For You?&rdquo; ;
&ldquo;A Job for Every Hoosier&rdquo; ;
&ldquo;More Wisdom in Indiana&rdquo; ;
&ldquo;Serving Those who Serve Us&rdquo; ;
&ldquo;Just Ask Joe&rdquo;
and
&ldquo;Best Ideas from Both Parties&rdquo; .
I am the hired help, and my top priority continues to be addressing the issues most important to Hoosiers: working to strengthen the economy for working- and middle-class families, ensuring our servicemembers and veterans have access to the care and resources they deserve, and providing excellent constituent services to every Hoosier.
From working nonstop to get the Jacob Sexton Military Suicide Prevention Act signed into law to advancing the Opportunity Agenda, my focus has been on getting things done by working with members of both parties. This report highlights our efforts to serve every Hoosier, and I look forward to continuing this work in year three.
