Congressman Lamborn
Criticizes Yet Another Obamacare
Extension
3/26/14
Congressman Doug Lamborn has released the following statement criticizing
the latest Obamacare enrollment
extension.
Just when you think that the implementation of
Obamacare cant get any more absurd, it does. After weeks of Administration
officials promising, on the record, that March 31 st
would
be the absolute deadline for enrollment, they have now created
loopholes allowing for extensions based on the honor system. It makes
absolutely no sense for the Administration to repeatedly make seemingly
arbitrary changes to Obamacare and at the same time expect Americans to
operate on the honor system. This flawed law based on a mountain of
distortions and falsehoods must be repealed and replaced with
patient-centered, free-market solutions.

(CO-05)
