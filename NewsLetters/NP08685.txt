Dear Friend,
I wanted to share an update on the
immigration crisis we've all been hearing about in the news. As many of
you know, thousands of unaccompanied children are crossing into the U.S.
by way of the southwest border at a record rate. Numerous buses and
planes have carried these minors to facilities across the country--
more than 1,500 are in Nogales right now.
In response to
this news, I wrote a bill yesterday calling for the President to
allow Governors of each state bordering Mexico to deploy 10,000 National
Guard men and women to assist in operations that are being left at the
wayside.
You can read my
letter to the
President here
and
H.R. 4882, the
Southwest Border Protection Act of 2014 .
Mr. President: Our Borders
Need Security
