Farm Talk
I had the pleasure of discussing agriculture policy with Senator Mark
Kirk, right, during a visit with members of the Vermilion County Farm
Bureau in Danville Thursday.
FCC Takes Another Step To Improve Wireless E-9-1-1 Accuracy
As House Co-Chairs of the Next Gen 9-1-1 Caucus, Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D,
California-18) and I last week expressed our appreciation to the
Federal Communication Commission (FCC) for voting in favor of proposed
standards for wireless providers to ensure accurate caller location
information is automatically provided to public safety officials for
indoor as well as outdoor wireless calls to 9-1-1 call centers.
We've made great progress on improving location reporting for outdoor
wireless calls to 9-1-1. Setting standards for indoor location accuracy
is the next logical step as more and more Americans rely on their
mobile phones in emergencies. I'm pleased to see the FCC agrees.
Added Eshoo, "By some estimates, 70 percent of 9-1-1 calls today are
placed from wireless phones, demonstrating the powerful effect mobile
technology has had on public safety. Yet, when these calls are made
from indoors, first responders still have difficulty obtaining accurate
location information. If their smartphone app can pinpoint their
location almost instantaneously, consumers rightfully expect our first
responders should be able to do the same in an emergency."
Rep. Eshoo and I sent a letter
to the FCC on January 15th requesting the
commission do more to ensure first responders have the necessary
information to locate calls made to 9-1-1 call centers from indoor
locations.
So What Exactly Did 2009 Landmark Legislation Stimulate?
Last week, Vice President Joe Biden visited Granite City to mark the
fifth anniversary of landmark stimulus legislation. While I support the
efforts to expand and grow America's Central Port, the stimulus as a
whole was a failure. The fact is the stimulus included very little
infrastructure spending, so touting infrastructure improvements hardly
tells the full story of the stimulus.
What the stimulus did include was a lot of waste, with funding for
bankrupt companies like Solyndra, which cost taxpayers over $500
million alone.
Other examples include the $3.4 million turtle tunnel
in Florida and numerous studies that had no economic or job-creating
value.
Another aspect of its failure is evident in the Illinois' unemployment
rate, which has not improved from the 8.5 percent in February 2009 to
December 2013's 8.6 percent. This does not include the many people who
are feared to have left the job search altogether.
According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, each job
created cost somewhere between $98,810 and $488,235. The worst part is
that the long-term costs of the stimulus will actually reduce our
nation's gross domestic product.
An analysis of the stimulus is available online
.
Sorting It Out
A number of constituents have contacted me about the effects of recent
U.S. Postal Service consolidation on the timeliness of their mail
delivery. On Thursday, I was able to share those concerns with Staci
Yerkes, acting director of the USPS Sorting Center in Champaign, which
has absorbed additional workload as a result of the consolidation.
Announcements
New Leader for Illiana: Japhet Rivera has been appointed director of
the VA Illiana Health Care System. He is expected to arrive by early
April in Danville, where he will oversee delivery of health care to
more than 33,000 veterans in Central Illinois and West Central Indiana
with an operating budget of more than $200 million. Rivera has been
acting director of the Robert J. Dole VA Medical Center in Wichita, KS.
His prior experience includes acting director for the Caribbean
Healthcare System in San Juan, PR; deputy director for the Caribbean
Healthcare System; and associate director for the Miami VA Health Care
System. He served in the U.S. Army Medical Department from 1987-2007.
VA Improving ID Cards: On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Veterans
Affairs announced the phased rollout of newly designed, more secure
Veteran Health Identification Cards. The new cards are distinguished by
additional security features and will have a different look and feel.
Each new card will be similar to a typical health insurance card,
displaying the veteran's Member ID, a new unique identifier, as well as
a Plan ID, reflecting the veteran's enrollment in VA health care. More
information is available online or by calling, toll-free,
1-877-222-VETS (8387).

So
What
Exactly
Did
2009
Landmark
Legislation
Stimulate?
Last
week,
Vice
President
Joe
Biden
visited Granite
City
to
mark
the
fifth
anniversary
of
landmark
stimulus
legislation.
While
I
support
the
efforts
to
expand
and
grow
America&#8217;s
Central
Port,
the
stimulus
as
a
whole
was
a
failure. The
fact
is
the
stimulus
included
very
little
infrastructure
spending,
so
touting
infrastructure
improvements
hardly
tells
the
full
story
of
the
stimulus.
What
the

include
was
a
lot
of
waste,
with
funding
for
bankrupt
companies
like
Solyndra,
which
cost
taxpayers
over

Other
examples
include
the
$3.4
million
turtle
tunnel
in
Florida
and
numerous
studies
that
had
no
economic
or
job-creating
value.
Another
aspect
of
its
failure
is
evident
in
the
Illinois&#8217;
unemployment
rate,
which
has
not
improved
from
the
8.5
percent
in
February
2009
to
December
2013&#8217;s
8.6
percent. This
does
not
include
the
many
people
who
are
feared
to
have
left
the
job
search
altogether.
According
to
the
non-partisan
Congressional
Budget

each
job
created
cost
somewhere
between
$98,810
and
$488,235. The
worst
part
is
that
the
long-term
costs
of
the
stimulus
will
actually
