Dear Friend,
Thank you very much for signing up for our eNewsletter. I appreciate
the opportunity to serve as your Representative. I wanted to give you
this update on our activities in the Second District and Washington,
D.C.
A Week in Pictures
I enjoyed being back in Oklahoma this week, making many stops
throughout the Second District. Being available and open for
communication has always been a priority of mine and I look forward to
taking what I've learned from each of you and using it to implement
change in Washington, D.C.
I had the opportunity to talk with and encourage students at Talking
Leaves Job Corps Center.
The Ferra Aerospace Co. in Grove graciously gave me a tour of their
operation.
I was able to meet with volunteers at the Christian H.E.L.P. Center,
including Don Fadley, who helps coordinate donations to the center.
The employees at Umicore in Quapaw took time out of their day to visit
with me and show off their products, technologies, and facilities.
I visited with many Grove seniors over lunch. Our seniors have so much
wisdom and experience that they can share with younger generations.
It was great to tour J&M; Farms with the Jurgensmeyers.
Employees at Newell Coach in Miami gave me a great tour of their plant.
I had the opportunity to go on a ride-along with UPS drivers.
It was an honor to attend the ribbon cutting ceremony with Governor
Fallin to celebrate the expansion of the Vallourec Star plant in
Muskogee.
Next Week
Next week we will consider important legislation that will allow
taxpayers to more effectively track Federal spending, as well as a bill
to repeal and consolidate unnecessary, duplicative, or outdated
government reports. We will also consider the Military Construction and
Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which will be
necessary to fund the Department of Veterans Affairs.
