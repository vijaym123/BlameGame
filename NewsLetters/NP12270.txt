House Votes to Restore
Military COLA Payments
The Ryan-Murray budget
deal passed by the House in December called for members of our armed
services to contribute more towards their pension funds rather than
making across-the-board cuts for all federal employees. It is
irresponsible to single out those who have sacrificed so much for our country. As
the representative for the district with the largest percentage of
retired military personnel in North Carolina, I could not support a
measure that forced these heroes to bear the burden of our nations
irresponsible spending.
On Tuesday, the House took a
much-needed bipartisan vote on S. 25 to restore COLA payments to our veterans.
After hearing from retired military personnel in my district and
advocating for this issue to be fixed, I was proud to join my House
colleagues in standing for our retired military men and women, as they devoted
their lives to standing for us.
S. 25 passed the House
in a vote of 32690 with my support.
Thanking D-Day
Heroes
It was an honor to attend Tuesday's ceremony for D-Day
veterans at the White House. French President Francois Hollande will
personally bestow the Legion of Honor medal upon six World War II veterans
during his visit to the United States. I had the opportunity to
personally thank one of those heroes, Art Ordel, and his lovely wife, Grace. We
can never allow their service and sacrifices for the cause of freedom
to be forgotten.
Debt Ceiling Increase
Despite my "no"
vote, the House passed a debt ceiling increase this week. Any measure that
raises the debt ceiling must also address the underlying drivers of
our debt. With no plan to cut excessive government spending and balance
the budget, we find ourselves kicking the can down the road yet
again. Continuing to raise the debt ceiling without conditions is
irresponsible and places an unfair and unsustainable burden on our children and
grandchildren.
Another Day, Another Obamacare
Delay
President Obama chose to once again delay Obamacare's destructive employer
mandate this week, this time for medium-sized businesses. Since July,
the President has unilaterally delayed parts of his own
health care law at least 23 times .
The President is
going around Congress to make temporary fixes for political reasons
when he should be working with Congress to make a permanent fix for the
American people.
