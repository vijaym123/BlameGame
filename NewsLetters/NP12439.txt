Intelligence Programs Should Protect Civil Liberties and National Security For the last several months, the House Judiciary Committee has conducted an
ongoing review of our nation&rsquo;s intelligence-gathering programs.
Last summer&rsquo;s unauthorized public release of these classified
programs by National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden has sparked a national debate about the extent of the programs and whether they pose a
threat to Americans&rsquo; civil liberties and privacy. Since then, there have been numerous proposals to significantly reform or end these programs
operated under the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , or FISA.
Just a few days ago, I convened a hearing in the House Judiciary Committee, which has primary jurisdiction over
how these programs legally operate, to examine the various recommendations for reform and discuss their impact on America&rsquo;s national security
and their value in enhancing civil liberty protections.
As we continue to review these proposals, trust is the number one issue we must address.
While the United States needs to have good
intelligence programs to gather information that will protect our communities from terrorist attacks, we also have a responsibility to guarantee
strong protections of the rights of Americans.
That is the mission of the House Judiciary Committee moving forward.
Any reforms Congress
enacts must ensure our nation&rsquo;s intelligence collection programs effectively protect our national security and include real protections for
Americans&rsquo; civil liberties, robust oversight, and additional transparency. Read more about this issue in the full version of my weekly column.

The
first annual
Congressional Science, Technology, Engineering and Math
(STEM) Academic Competition, or &ldquo;The House App Contest,&rdquo; is now open for
registration!
High school students from across the country, including
the Sixth Congressional District, will have to opportunity to create and
exhibit a software application, or &ldquo;app,&rdquo; for mobile, tablet, or
computer devices.
The
demand for students educated in engineering and technology continues to
rise in the United
States, but part of the challenge is how to engage
students in these subjects and further their understanding of these
valuable skills.
The House
App Contest provides students with the
opportunity to showcase their technology skills and learn more about
STEM fields.
Participating students
will design and develop a working
app, or design and mock up an app. The contest deadline is
April 30, 2014 .
More information on the contest
is available on my
website . You can also contact my Washington,
D.C. office at 202-225-5431 with any questions. If
you
know any students who may be interested, I encourage you to pass
this information along.
I know that we have many students in the Sixth
District
who excel in these fields, and I look forward to all of their
contest submissions.
