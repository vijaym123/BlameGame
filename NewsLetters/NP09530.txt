Dear Friend,
The last couple weeks on Capitol Hill have been eventful, to say the
least. My friend and colleague Congressman Trey Gowdy of South
Carolina, a former federal prosecutor, was named chair of a select
committee to investigate the events surrounding the 2012 terrorist
attack in Benghazi that killed four Americans including our ambassador.
It is about time. I have full confidence that the select committee will
get the full truth about what took place leading up to, during, and
following the terrorist attack on our consulate in Libya. The families
of the brave victims, as well as the American people, cannot wait any
longer for answers from the White House, which, for almost two years
now, has engaged in a pattern of obstruction regarding the horrific
events of that day.
There's been some intriguing news off of Capitol Hill as well, here in
our home state: A new Gallup poll says 47 percent of Marylanders would
leave the state if they could. And no wonder: I routinely hear from
constituents who rightfully complain of a "lack of jobs" and "being
taxed to death." I recently reacted to this striking poll on WJZ's
Eyewitness News at 11. You can watch the story here
.
We in the House understand that American families are hurting. There
have been a total of 246 bills passed by the House that are awaiting
Senate consideration; 40 of them relate directly to increasing the
number of U.S. jobs. Many of the bills have bipartisan support in the
House because they are common-sense. The bills address issues like
repealing job-killing provisions of Obamacare; building the Keystone XL
oil pipeline, which will produce 42,000 jobs; and creating conditions
that will make it easier for veterans to be hired. The Cecil Whig
recently published my op-ed on this very topic, which you can check out
here
.
Speaking of jobs, I spoke about the economic state of our country on a
recent episode of CNN's Crossfire. In case you missed it, you can find
links to the debate on my website
.
On a more personal note, one of my constituents, Mr. Ernst S. Selig of
Hillsboro, was awarded the French Legion of Honor for his service in
France during World War II. Eighteen U.S. veterans from "The Greatest
Generation," including Mr. Selig, were honored at a ceremony at the
French Embassy on May 8. You can check out photos from the ceremony on
my Facebook page
. With Memorial Day upon us, don't forget to
reflect on all the men and women who have died defending our freedoms-
and to thank a veteran, like Mr. Selig, for his or her service and
sacrifice.
Thank you for your continued energy and enthusiasm, as reflected in
your letters and Facebook posts. If you haven't already, LIKE my
