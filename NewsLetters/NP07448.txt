Dear Friend, This year, I&rsquo;ve spent countless hours fighting to protect consumers from big corporations.
From the GM ignition scandal to the on-going fight over net neutrality, this year has been a constant reminder that if something&rsquo;s worth doing, it probably won&rsquo;t be easy.
That&rsquo;s true on our campaign too. It&rsquo;s not easy to mobilize a statewide effort -- but with control of the Senate at stake, it was never going to be easy to begin with.
This month, we need to hit $35,000 to stay on track for victory -- make a $5 contribution and help us get a little closer.
If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately:
Express Donate: $5
Express Donate: $10
Express Donate: $25
Or donate another amount.
Winning the long game is about patience, about staying focused on the long-term goals no matter the distractions, and about hitting your short-term targets along the way. That&rsquo;s how we gathered public support on net neutrality, and it&rsquo;s how we marshalled evidence against the executives at GM who placed profits ahead of people&rsquo;s safety.
And that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re going to win this election too. Our campaign is focused on winning the long game, but we need your help to reach our fundraising goals along the way.
Chip in $5, $10, or whatever you can to help us reach $35,000 before tomorrow.
Thanks for your help.
