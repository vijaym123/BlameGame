Dear Friends,
Last month I introduced
the Roth
Account for Youths Savings or RAYS Act (H.R. 4129)
that would make
a modification to the earned income rules of existing Roth IRAs by
allowing children, who generally lack earned income, to use their
parents' earned income limits to make contributions to an account in the
minors' name. I did this because I feel the importance of saving money
for the future should be a lesson all Americans learn in childhood,"
said U.S. Rep. Hinojosa. "The RAYS Act would allow families to instill
the habit of saving for the long-term in Americas youngest
citizens.
Currently, the only tax-preferred savings vehicles to
save for non-working children are 529 College Savings Plans and Coverdell
Education Savings Accounts. Only 3 percent of U.S. families own
assets in either of these accounts, showing that current savings vehicles
intended for children are failing to promote savings for the vast
majority of Americans.
A robust research base shows that building
savings in childhood is a key contributor to financial security and
economic mobility over the course of one's life.
The "Roth at
Birth" legislation has evolved over the years but my bill represents the
most advanced version, without the pitfalls of previous versions. I
believe if children learn from an early age the importance of saving
money for their future, it will make our nation's economy stronger than
ever over the years.
The funds contributed into these accounts
would be accessible throughout life to pay for the following:
education, a down payment on a house, financial emergencies, and retirement.
Because they build on a familiar savings vehicle, the Roth IRA, RAYs
would be available from existing financial service providers with whom
families may already have relationships. As structured in my bill,
these accounts would not create a new tax shelter or drain on the federal
budget.
In an article by Rueter's reporter Mark Miller, he
writes, "Hinojosa's bill builds on several earlier attempts to create a
tax-advantaged path for Americans to save at very young ages. If it
becomes law, it could provide a significant boost to savings by
lower-income Americans and could address a worrisome long-term trend: younger
households' deteriorating balance sheets."
