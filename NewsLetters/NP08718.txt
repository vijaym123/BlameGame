Welcoming America's Future Leaders
Hosting PA's Military Academy Appointees For Breakfast In The Senate
Watch video
One of my greatest honors as U.S. Senator is to nominate outstanding young Pennsylvanians to our nation's service academies.
Each year,
I host Pennsylvania's appointees for breakfast
at the Capitol. Our deepest thanks to them, and to all those who serve in our military!
Saying hello before breakfast in the Russell Senate building.
Maria Kruegler, from Cumberland County, will attend West Point this summer. Congratulations to her and to all Pennsylvania's military academy appointees!
Working Across Party Lines To Protect Our Vets
I am spearheading a bipartisan measure to allow the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) secretary to dismiss poor performing employees and to give veterans flexibility on where they receive medical care.
Recently, the American people learned about outrageous examples of mismanagement at the VA that included excessive wait times; substandard care; dishonest reporting; and corner cutting that may have even cost veterans' lives.
Now more than ever, we need action and real solutions in Washington, not more gridlock and partisanship.
Senators Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) have introduced the bipartisan
Veterans' Access to Care Through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014
to address some of these problems.
I joined them as a cosponsor of this bill, which was passed by the Senate this week.
While this legislation is not perfect, there are two reform ideas that I have been championing which were included - namely, more accountability in the VA bureaucracy and more choices for veterans. I was pleased to join Senators Sanders and McCain on this important effort.
Cracking Down On The VA
Watch video
The recent revelations surrounding the VA scandal are infuriating.
The men and women who served in uniform should be first in line for the best quality medical care in the world.
I have introduced legislation to allow veterans to hold VA employees accountable if they falsify or destroy information relating to a veteran's health care.
My legislation would also
authorize the firing of VA employees
who engage in such activity.
