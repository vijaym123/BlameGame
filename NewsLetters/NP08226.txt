Update from Senator Bob Corker
June 27,
2014
Honoring
Senator Howard Baker
Senator Corker issued
the following statement yesterday on the passing of former U.S.
Senate Majority Leader Howard H. Baker, Jr. (R-Tenn.):
When I
think of the ultimate statesman, the very first person who comes to my
mind is Howard Baker.
Howard Baker was one of those people
who had the unique ability to bring out the very best in those around
him. He always put our countrys interests first, and lived a life of
service that everyone in public office should aspire to emulate. I
have cherished the privilege of being able to sit down and talk with
Howard on many occasions, and I will always value his words of
encouragement. He was a source of great pride in our
state.
Elizabeth and I extend our thoughts and prayers to his wife, Nancy, the Baker
family and all those who have been touched by Howards remarkable
life."

Unconstitutional Obama
Appointments
On Thursday, Senator Corker applauded the Supreme
Courts unanimous ruling that President Barack Obama violated the U.S.
Constitution when he bypassed the Senates advice and consent authority in
making so-called recess appointments in 2012.
This
result is a huge victory for all who believe in separation of powers and
the rule of law, said Corker.
In November 2013, Corker and
44 of his Senate colleagues filed an amicus brief in this case (NLRB v.
Noel Canning), a challenge to the constitutionality of President
Obamas recess appointments.
Highway Funding and Tax Relief
Proposal
June 18, 2014
Senators Corker and Murphy announce a proposal
to shore up the Highway Trust Fund and provide tax relief for American
families and businesses.
This summer, the
Highway Trust Fund, which funds improvements to roads, bridges and transit
systems, will run dry and likely halt the construction of any new
transportation projects without action from Congress. This will result in
a 50 percent reduction in Tennessees transportation budget in 2015
and create a $160 billion hole in state budgets nationwide over the
next decade at a time when they can least afford it.
Last
Week, Senator Corker and Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.)
announced a proposal
that would create a long-term, stable funding
mechanism for the Highway Trust Fund and enact tax relief for
American families and businesses.
Growing up in Tennessee as a
conservative, I learned that if something was important enough to have,
it was important enough to pay for. Thats how weve governed in the
Volunteer State, which has resulted in the second best transportation
system in the country without having one penny of road debt, said
Corker. In Washington, far too often, we huff and puff about paying for
proposals that are unpopular, yet throw future generations under the
bus when public pressure mounts on popular proposals that have broad
support. Congress should be embarrassed that it has played chicken with
the Highway Trust Fund and allowed it to become one of the largest
budgeting failures in the federal government. If Americans feel that
having modern roads and bridges is important then Congress should have the
courage to pay for it.
The proposal is drawing broad
support from a number of leaders in Tennessee and national organizations
including:
National
Organizations
AAA
American Highway Users Alliance
American Public
Transportation Association
American Road and Transportation Builders
Association
