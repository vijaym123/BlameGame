If the economy isnt doing well, it makes it very difficult for businesses to grow and create jobs.
Two signs indicating that our economy is struggling are that: (1) In 2010, China replaced the United States as the
largest manufacturing country ; and (2) for the first time in 30 years,
more businesses are closing
than opening.
Regardless of why this is happening, this should tell us that something is wrong.
Its time to light up this economy and get our nation back on course .
We need a national manufacturing strategy.
We need to lower taxes and reduce burdensome regulations.
We need to lower healthcare costs.
Theres no lever that can be pulled in Washington to get the economy back on track, but we can work to create an environment that encourages entrepreneurship, and allows existing businesses to grow and continue to thrive.
Yours in service,
Randy
