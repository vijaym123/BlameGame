This morning, President Obama sent you an urgent call-to-action. Here&rsquo;s a quick recap:
With just 7 weeks left, we&rsquo;re at the most critical point in this election. But we&rsquo;re in serious danger of getting outspent by Koch-funded Republicans in key races. If we can&rsquo;t close the spending gap right now, we will suffer terrible losses on Election Day. David, this is the last election of Barack Obama&rsquo;s Presidency. And today is one of the last times that he&rsquo;ll ask for your help. Will you stand with him one more time?
