They Feel Pain
Dear Friends,
When I first became a nurse more than 40 years ago, I took an oath to
"devote myself to the welfare of those committed to my care." I still
consider the words of that oath today in the decisions I make in
Congress-particularly in matters of protecting the most innocent and
vulnerable among us: the unborn.
My decades in the healthcare industry, along with my faith, have
informed my view that all life is sacred and deserves to be protected.
To that end, I wrote legislation offering relief from Obamacare's
mandate that employers provide abortion inducing drug coverage, voted
to pass the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, fought to defund
Planned Parenthood-the nation's largest provider of abortions-and
supported the passage of legislation that is very near to my heart: the
Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.
Passed by a bipartisan majority of the House of Representatives nearly
a year ago, this measure would ban late-term abortions after twenty
weeks with an exception provided for situations involving rape, incest,
or when the life of the mother is endangered. As I shared when I spoke
in support
of the bill on the House floor, the legislation is based on
undisputed scientific evidence which tells us that unborn children at
20 weeks and older can feel pain and that late-term abortions pose
severe health risks for the mother.
Despite this bill's strong support in our chamber, it has been blocked
from receiving further consideration by Harry Reid and the Senate
Democrat majority. During the time that the bill has been held in
waiting, a new report
from the Charlotte Lozier
Institute was released showing that the United States is one of only
seven countries in the world that permit elective abortion past 20
weeks-making our country an outlier with the likes of China, North
Korea, and Vietnam.
Our nation's unborn children shouldn't have to wait for the
pro-abortion Democrat Senate majority to act and protect their right to
live. That is why, this week, I led 104 other Members of Congress in
sending a bipartisan
letter to Senator Reid demanding
that the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act be brought up for a
vote on the Senate floor. As our letter explains, "Knowingly subjecting
our innocent unborn children to these brutal procedures in the womb,
particularly when they have developed to the point that they can feel
excruciating pain, belies everything America is or was ever called to
be."
It is past time we as a country acknowledge the science and take action
to protect our unborn children. Until we can stop the tragedy of
abortion once and for all, the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act
will mark an important step in the right direction.
Sincerely,
Diane Black
Member of Congress

They
Feel
Pain
Dear
Friends,
When
I
first
became
a
nurse
more
than
40
years
ago,
I
took
an
oath
to
&#8220;devote
myself
to
the
welfare
of
those
committed
to
my
care.&#8221;
I
still
consider
the
words
of
that
oath
today
in
the
decisions
I
make
in
Congress&#8212;particularly
in
matters
of
protecting
the
most
innocent
and
vulnerable
among
us:
the
unborn.
My
decades
in
the
healthcare
industry,
along
with
my
faith,
have
informed
my
view
that
all
life
is
sacred
and
deserves
to
be
protected.
To
that
end,
I
wrote
legislation
offering
relief
from
Obamacare&#8217;s
mandate
that
employers
provide
abortion
inducing
drug
coverage,
voted
to
pass
the
No
Taxpayer
Funding
for
Abortion
Act ,
fought
to
defund
Planned
Parenthood&#8212;the
nation&#8217;s
largest
provider
of
abortions&#8212;and
supported
the
passage
of
legislation
that
is
very
near
to
my
heart:
the
Pain
Capable
Unborn
Child
Protection
Act .
Passed
by
a
bipartisan
majority
of
the
House
of
Representatives
nearly
a
year
ago,
this
measure
would
ban
late-term
abortions
after
twenty
weeks
with
an
exception
provided
for
situations
involving
rape,
incest,
or
when
the
life
of
the
mother
is
endangered.
As
I
shared
when
I
spoke
in
support
of
the
bill
on
the
House
floor,
the
legislation
is
based
on
undisputed
scientific
evidence
which
tells
us
that
unborn
children
at
20
weeks
and
older
can
feel
pain
and
that
late-term
abortions
pose
severe
health
risks
for
the
mother.
Despite
this
bill&#8217;s
strong
support
in
our
chamber,
it
has
been
blocked
from
receiving
further
consideration
by
Harry
Reid
and
the
Senate
Democrat
majority.
During
the
time
that
the
bill
has
been
held
in
waiting,
a
new
report
from
the
Charlotte
Lozier
Institute
was
released
showing
that
the
United
States
is
one
of
only
seven
countries
in
the
world
that
permit
elective
abortion
past
20
weeks&#8212;making
our
country
an
outlier
with
the
likes
of
China,
North
Korea,
and
Vietnam.
Our
nation&#8217;s
unborn
children
shouldn&#8217;t
have
to
wait
for
the
pro-abortion
Democrat
Senate
majority
to
act
and
protect
their
right
to
live.
That
is
why,
this
week,
I
led
104
other
Members
of
Congress
in
sending
a
bipartisan

to
Senator
Reid
demanding
that
the
Pain
Capable
Unborn
Child
Protection
Act
be
brought
up
for
a
vote
on
the
Senate
floor.
As
our
letter
explains,
&#8220;Knowingly
subjecting
our
innocent
unborn
children
to
these
brutal
procedures
in
the
womb,
particularly
when
they
have
developed
to
the
point
that
they
can
feel
excruciating
pain,
belies
everything
America
is
or
was
ever
called
to
be.&#8221;
It
is
past
time
we
as
a
country
acknowledge
the
science
and
take
action
to
protect
our
unborn
children.
Until
we
can
stop
the
tragedy
of
abortion
once
and
for
all,
the
Pain
Capable
Unborn
Child
Protection
Act
will
mark
an
important
step
in
the
right
direction.
