Hello,
Welcome to "Kansas Common Sense." Thanks for your continued interest in
receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to
your family and friends if it would interest them.
Senate and House Should Not Walk Away from VA Reform
On Tuesday, the nominee to be the Secretary of the Department of
Veterans Affairs, Bob McDonald, testified before the Senate Veterans
Affairs Committee. While I was pleased to hear that Mr. McDonald
believes the VA must restore their values to truly care about the
well-being of veterans, I emphasized the need for immediate action on
the Veterans Choice Act to assist millions of veterans across the
country who are struggling with access to the quality care they
deserve. While speaking to Fox News
prior to the hearing, I called on the Senate to stay in Washington D.C.
rather than heading out of town for the traditional August recess until
a conference committee report has been reached.
It's been understandable to criticize the VA for its failures in
providing care to our veterans, but if we do not reach a conclusion on
this legislation, the United States Senate is deserving of that same
condemnation. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid should say we're not
going home - there's no August recess until we get this issue resolved.
The day after Mr. McDonald's nomination hearing, the Senate Veterans
Affairs Committee quickly voted in favor of McDonald's nomination by a
vote of 14 to 0. His nomination will head to the Senate floor to
complete the confirmation process and I look forward to working with
him as the new Secretary of the VA. I am hopeful the Senate and House
will show leadership and make certain the new VA Secretary has the
Veterans Choice Act to implement in service to our nations veterans.
Visiting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta
On Monday, I visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), our nation's health protection agency, to learn more about how
CDC works to safeguard the United States from health, safety and
security threats. CDC strengthens the health security of our nation by
fighting disease and supporting local health departments and other
health organizations across the country. As Ranking Member of the
Senate Appropriations Health Subcommittee, which has funding
jurisdiction over CDC, it is important for me to understand how the
agency allocates its scientific expertise, tools, and resources to
promote health, prevent disease, and prepare for new health threats.
CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden hosted me on this visit and showed me
around CDC's campus. We toured the CDC Emergency Operations Center
(EOC), which is CDC's command center for coordinating emergency
responses to domestic and international public health threats. The EOC
is the central point of contact for state health agencies reporting
potential threats to CDC. We also saw the CDC Influenza Lab which
monitors and assesses flu viruses and improves vaccines. This lab
improves global control and prevention of seasonal flu viruses and
enhances flu pandemic preparedness and response.
We visited about how Kansas utilizes CDC support to help rural health
care providers leverage resources to stay connected to patients living
across wide areas and improve their medication adherence to control
high blood pressure and other chronic conditions. Kansas also utilizes
CDC to bolster vaccine immunization coverage in our state and reduce
healthcare-associated infections. Finally, we discussed CDC's plans to
strengthen oversight of government laboratories handling dangerous
microbes in the wake of several disturbing safety lapses recently.
Thank you to Dr. Frieden and his team for their hospitality in hosting
me at CDC and their commitment to keeping our country safe and healthy.
Discussing Kansas Priorities with HHS Secretary Burwell
On Wednesday, I met with U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell to discuss health care topics of
importance to Kansans. As I visit with health care providers, almost
every discussion involves concerns with the burdens Washington policies
place on them as they work to care for Kansans. Kansans are strongly
opposed to the Obama Administration's proposals to cut reimbursements
to Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) and eliminate hospitals from this
essential rural health program. CAHs are small, rural hospitals that
receive enhanced Medicare reimbursements to provide care to an
increasingly aging population across wide rural areas. Kansas has 83 of
these hospitals, more than any other state. I explained to Sec. Burwell
how the Administration's policies would jeopardize the survival of many
rural hospitals and endanger access to health care in our own
communities. In addition to discussing the importance of hospitals to
the rural health care delivery system, Sec. Burwell and I visited about
the urgent need to improve the Medicare's Recovery Audit Contractor
program, the valuable role that pharmacists play in delivering health
care in their communities and how the decisions at her department that
threaten their future, and the unprecedented influx of unaccompanied
children from Central America arriving at the United States border. I
appreciate the Secretary's willingness to meet with me, and I look
forward to a renewed dialogue with her and her team on a range of
health care topics important to our state. Click here
to read more about this meeting.
Working to Keep Government Out of Your Email Inbox
This week, I sponsored the Electronic Communications Privacy Act
Amendments Act (S.607) to help protect the privacy of American citizens
online by updating the privacy protections for electronic
communications stored by third-party service providers - including
email and social media services. The importance of updating the privacy
protections was recently underscored
by an Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) claim that American Internet users "do not have a
reasonable expectation of privacy" when it comes to their emails being
accessed by the government.
Americans have a constitutionally protected right to privacy that no
one, including the IRS, may take away. Our electronic communications
privacy laws need to be updated to reflect that fact. These outdated
laws, designed in the era of floppy disks, do not make sense in an era
of cloud computing, when users essentially have infinite storage
online. Americans rightfully expect their private communications to be
protected from intrusion, especially by government bureaucrats. S. 607
will affirm Americans' right to privacy and help bring this 1980s law
into the 21st Century. This legislation would update the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act of 1986 by requiring government entities to
obtain a warrant in order to access electronic communications stored by
third-party service providers - including email, social media, and
cloud storage services. Click here
to read more about the legislation.
Standing Up For Israel During Turbulent Times
On Thursday, I spoke on the Senate floor
about the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. In my speech, I
referenced Resolution 498
which the Senate passed unanimously on July 17 to express American
support for Israeli self-defense efforts and call for an immediate
cessation of Hamas' attacks against Israel.
Americans would not tolerate the threat of terrorism that Israelis face
on a daily basis. Since 1948, attacks have repeatedly forced Israel to
defend its people. The Senate will continue to demonstrate that the
United States stands with Israel - especially during these turbulent
times as Israel takes necessary action to reduce Hamas' means of terror
and to disarm those who stand firmly in the way of a real and lasting
peace. Click here
to view a video of my full speech.
Touring Heartland Community Health Center in Lawrence
At the end of the week on my way home, I visited and toured Heartland
Community Health Center in Lawrence. Heartland is a Community Health
Center (CHC) that provides comprehensive health services through an
integrated care model to residents of Douglas, Jefferson, Franklin,
Leavenworth and Osage counties. Heartland also collaborates with the
Bert Nash Community Mental Health Center in Lawrence to connect
patients with important behavioral health services.
I have supported CHCs since I came to Congress in 1997 because they
help underserved patients by providing them a wide range of preventive
and primary health care services in their own communities. CHCs, which
are primary care centers located in medically underserved areas that
provide care to individuals regardless of their ability to pay, are a
targeted initiative that addresses a specific patient access need. They
also lower health care costs by reducing expensive emergency room
visits and promoting disease prevention and wellness. I welcome insight
on the unique challenges they face caring for patients. Thanks to
Heartland CEO Jon Stewart and Communications Coordinator Sean Hatch for
hosting my visit.
Visiting TravAlong Trailers in Waterville
On Friday, I had the opportunity to tour TravAlong Trailers in
Waterville. TravAlong Trailers has more than 60 employees in Waterville
and Manhattan who will produce around 800 steel and aluminum trailers
for construction and agribusinesses this year. It's always exciting to
see Kansas businesses thriving, and at times catching the spotlight.
Recently TravAlong participated in the upcoming Discovery Channel 2015
TV Series "How it's made." Thanks to Tom Grieshaber and Buzz Harris for
the informative and enjoyable tour.
More Kansas Listening Tour Stops
I continued my Kansas Listening Tour this weekend with stops in
Washington and Westmoreland. In Washington, I heard from area residents
about overregulation, the lesser prairie chicken listing, the federal
budget, importance of Ft. Riley and maintaining a strong military.
Thanks to the First National Bank for hosting the town hall.
In Westmoreland, Pottawatomie County residents attended and shared
feedback on the critical issues facing Kansas and the nation including
EPA regulations, the lack of "regular order" in the Senate, the budget,
immigration, and the need to pass VA reform legislation. The issues I
focus on and the work I do in Washington, D.C., are largely based on
the conversations I have with Kansans during these town hall meetings.
