Rep. Curbelo on TPA, TAA
Washington, D.C. -This afternoon, the House passed Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), but failed to move forward on Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA), the second half of H.R. 1314, The Trade Act of 2015. Rep. Curbelo (FL-26) issued the following statement in support of its passage:
Today the House of Representatives had a lively and impassioned debate on our countrys role in the global economy. The rules for trade in the global economy are being written without American input. TPA is about The United States having influence over global trade rules to ensure higher standards and that American products can access new markets, leading to domestic job creation.
I was proud to cast my vote in favor of both TAA and TPA. The South Florida communities I am privileged to represent directly see the benefits that trade promotion authority enables. This new trade package, H.R. 1314, which already passed the Senate with strong bipartisan support, allows for unprecedented Congressional oversight and transparency in the negotiation of all future free trade agreements. With this bill, Congress is in the drivers seat of our nations trade agenda
not this president or anyone who follows.
While TPA did pass the House with bipartisan support, I was disappointed the TAA portion fell short. I will continue working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance a strong trade agenda to help our workers and businesses open new markets in the world economy.
Trade Promotion Authority passed the House on June 12, 2015 with a vote of
219-211 , with Trade Adjustment Assistance failing by
126-302.
