THE 12TH DISTRICT
|
LEGISLATION
Dear David,
Getting
Results
Throughout my
tenure in Congress, I have worked to produce positive results and reforms
for my constituents, Floridians, and Americans across the country.
This year, I have introduced bills and worked with my colleagues to help
the residents of the 12 th
District of
Florida.
Fixing Flood
Insurance
As many of my
constituents know, homeowners around the country experienced astronomical rate
increases for flood insurance. Some of my constituents were facing
increases in the tens of thousands of dollars. In many cases, flood
insurance premiums were more expensive for my constituents than their
monthly mortgage payments.
The situation was dire. I was proud to be one of a handful of
legislators who came together to create a fix and encourage the House to take
action.
Congress was able to come together and get
it done
we passed a bill quickly and got it to the President for
his signature.
Working for
you
I
have introduced a number of legislative initiatives that will improve
the lives of my constituents. Among the dozens of measures I have
introduced, my bills would:
Allow Veterans to
receive alternative therapies to treat PTS;
Reform and improve Americas foreign student visa system, to prevent
individuals with malicious intentions from entering the country
through the Student Exchange Visitor Program;
Protect my constituents from the overly burdensome taxes and regulations
in the Presidents health care law;
Reform flood insurance rate calculation to prevent unreasonable rate
increases; and
Prevent prescription drug
abuse.
I am particularly
proud of my legislation to reauthorize Brand USA.
Tourism is an integral part
of our economy
especially in Florida. Increased tourism means more
American and Floridian jobs. My legislation means job growth without
utilizing a dime of taxpayer dollars. Millions of Americans across the
country are still struggling. Brand USA reauthorization is a jobs bill,
and will improve the lives of thousands of my constituents and
Floridians across the state.
Urging
Senate Action
Despite the Houses continued efforts, the Senate has been less than
willing to consider substantive legislation. I am disappointed that for
the Senate, flood insurance was the exception, not the norm. On the
other hand, the House has a proven record of success
its in the
numbers.
My
bill to reauthorize Brand USA is one of over 350 bills stuck in the
Senate. Nonetheless, I will continue to work for my constituents, and I
hope you will contact your Senators and urge them to pass Brand USA,
and other job-creating measures waiting on the desk of Harry
Reid.
Sincerely,
Gus
Bilirakis
Member of Congress
