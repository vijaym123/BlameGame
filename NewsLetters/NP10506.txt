The Hill Report
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of April 21 - 25, 2014
This week, I was delighted to congratulate the winners of this year's
Congressional High School Art Competition during an awards ceremony at
The Art Institute of Dallas. This year's competition included 41
entries from students representing 12 local schools. Prior to the
awards ceremony, the Grand Prize winner and Runners Up honors were
chosen by art instructors from The Art Institute, educators, and local
artists. The People's Choice Award winner was chosen through online
voting on my website.
Madeline Lynn, a senior at Ursuline Academy, was awarded the Grand
Prize for her photography entitled "Third World Reality." Her artwork
will be showcased in the corridor leading to the U.S. Capitol building
for the next year. As the Grand Prize recipient, Madeline will travel
to Washington, DC for the national Congressional High School Art
Competition award ceremony in June.

Runners Up honors were presented to Maury Sheeder, a junior at Highland
Park High School, for her photography entitled "Transition" and to
Angie Reisch, a senior at Ursuline Academy, for her oil painting
entitled "Syria." The People's Choice Award was presented to Aliana
Layug, a senior at Lakeview Centennial High School, for her pencil work
entitled "Patterns of a Face." The two Runners Up and the People's
Choice Award artworks will be proudly displayed in my office for the
next year.
The award-winning art produced by Madeline, Maury, Angie, and Aliana
showcased their exceptional talent and I am very proud of their hard
work.
Students and schools interested in participating in next year's
Congressional Art Competition may contact Jennifer Lang in Congressman
Sessions' Dallas District office at 972.392.0505 for more information.
Constituent Meetings
I also enjoyed meeting with several constituent groups, businesses, and
local leaders this week to discuss the issues important to the people
of the 32nd Congressional District.
I have highlighted a few of these
meetings below.
Commerce Street Capital 12th Annual Bank Conference
On Tuesday I had the opportunity to give the keynote address at the
Commerce Street Capital 12th Annual Bank Conference, which was attended
by 250 regional and community bankers. During my remarks, I discussed
the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) - one of the most
far-reaching provisions of the Dodd-Frank law.
The CFPB is a paramount
example of the government overextending its authority into the free
enterprise system, which is why I voted for the Consumer Financial
Freedom and Washington Accountability Act
in February.

Annual Bank Conference
I also discussed the need to rein in government regulation that is
making it difficult for banks to perform their critical roles in local
economies. Banks are increasingly facing new rules and regulations that
are creating unnecessary regulatory burdens that jeopardize their
functionality. Regulatory relief will allow more banks to realize their
full potential as catalysts for entrepreneurship, job creation, and
economic growth.
North Texas Municipal Water District Pipeline Project
On Wednesday I visited the North Texas Municipal Water District
Pipeline Project with Garland Mayor Doug Athas, Richardson Mayor Pro
Tem Bob Townsend, Richardson Mayor Laura Maczka, Rowlett Mayor Todd
Gottel, and Wylie Mayor Eric Hogue.
We began the visit with a meeting
to receive an update on the Lake Texoma Pipeline extension, ozone
project, and blending operations. We also toured the facility to see
the modifications that are currently under construction.

Wylie ISD
On Thursday I met with several leaders of the Wylie Independent School
District to learn more about their testing and new curriculum. They
gave me an update on their current work and we also discussed the
impact of federal policies on our local schools.

Wylie Lions Club
On Thursday I also had the opportunity to meet with the Wylie Lions
Club over lunch to discuss a variety of issues currently facing our
country, state, and community. We talked about the impact of ObamaCare
on our economy and health care system, the recent budget proposal
passed by the House, and military issues.

Have a good weekend.

Pete Sessions
