I was pleased to see so many of you enjoying
time with family and friends on Independence Day in Americas First
District. The holiday weekend is always a popular one for traveling, and
I know that many folks were watching the miles tick upward on their
odometers and thinking of the cost of gasoline. That cost has been on my
mind as well, and I recently voted for legislation to help cut the
cost of fuel for Americans by boosting domestic energy
production.
H.R. 4899, the Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an America That
Works Act, would streamline and improve onshore and offshore energy
permitting, and it ensures a responsible, all-of-the-above energy plan
that utilizes all of our vast energy resources. This legislation
included two amendments that I wrote to expedite Virginia offshore energy
production and increase Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM)
education in the Commonwealth. The bill would also create a new
revenue sharing formula to be phased in for coastal states, entitling these
states
including Virginia
to a significant portion of revenue
received by the U.S.
There has been bipartisan support at all
levels of government for the responsible development and exploration
of sources of energy off the coast of Virginia, and I was pleased that
my provisions were included. The resources are there, and this
legislation is a significant opportunity to make them available, thereby
helping to relieve pain at the pump and increase American
jobs.
There is no single solution to fixing our energy problems, but H.R.
4899 is one key part of a thorough approach to energy policy as a
whole. I also believe that renewable energy sources must play a part in
such a strategy, which is why
I introduced H.R.
1398 , the Advancing Offshore Wind Production Act, last year. This bill
would streamline the complex process for approving offshore wind permits
in the Outer Continental Shelf.
The main streets of
Virginias First District are full of ideas to get our economy back on
track, and your feedback is critically important to me as I serve you. I
