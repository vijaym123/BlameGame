Happy Thanksgiving! There is much to be thankful for over this past
year, and I hope that you are able to spend this time enjoying a great
meal with family and friends.
The tradition of Thanksgiving for me is especially meaningful, as we
have the opportunity both to celebrate all the good in our lives, as
well as to work on behalf of those who are less fortunate.
We have the potential to bring hope and opportunity to those
individuals and communities who need it most through the initiatives in
my Opportunity Agenda.
Issues like school choice, apprenticeships, and
job skills training can completely transform someone's life, and I am
committed to working to ensure that all Americans have an opportunity
to succeed.
I wish you and your family the very best this Thanksgiving, and I am
grateful for all of the support I have received from all of you over
this past year-your thoughts and suggestions are very valuable to me in
doing the very best job representing you.
It is an honor to serve as your voice in the United States Senate, and
I hope you and yours have a safe and happy Thanksgiving!
Sincerely,
Tim Scott
