Friend --
MSNBC
reports, &ldquo;Democrats are investing... in a
ground game of unprecedented strength &rdquo;: We&#39;ve outspent the GOP 3-to-1 on the ground in the four closest Senate races!!
It&rsquo;s what has us LEADING in Senate projections:
Democrats 51 - Republicans 49!
If we win all four races, we&rsquo;ll DESTROY Mitch McConnell&rsquo;s takeover chances and TRANSFORM the political landscape!!
We&#39;re launching a MASSIVE Get Out the Vote Campaign to WIN -- but the FINAL cutoff to fund it is in 48 hours.
That&#39;s when the LAST FEC deadline of the election hits -- and we need $500,000 more before then!

MSNBC
warns that to WIN, we MUST &ldquo;avoid getting blown out in the money and spending race&rdquo; in the final 22 days. So let&rsquo;s do it!!
If you pitch in now, you can hand a gut-wrenching loss to the Republican mega-donors who think they can just swoop in and buy the Senate. It&rsquo;ll be what
Meet the Press
called their &ldquo;worst case scenario!&rdquo;
