Restoring Fifth Amendment rights
The government shouldn't be able to seize an individuals private property without due process if a crime is alleged, but it does. According to a
Washington Post study , the government has seized $2.5 billion from nearly 62,000 people since 2001.
In the U.S., individuals deserve the expectation that due process will be followed and their rights and property will be respected by their government. Im proud to cosponsor legislation introduced in the Senate by Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) and in the House by Rep. Tim Walberg (R-MI) called
The FAIR Act,
and join the effort to make sure the government isnt taking private property it shouldnt be taking, and removing any incentive for law enforcement to circumvent due process.

Helping students save for college
This week the U.S. House voted to improve 529 college savings accounts, giving Southwest Washington students and families a better tool to deal with the costs of higher education. H.R. 529 would allow students to use their 529 college savings to purchase computers, and allow them to redeposit refunds on any qualifying expense back into their 529 account without taxes or penalties.
The amount of debt that young adults and parents are racking up in order to pay for higher education has become a crisis in this country, and its restricting choices and making life harder. Congress should be taking steps to make it easier for families to save for college, and thats exactly what this bill does. To read more about H.R. 529
