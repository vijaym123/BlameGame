Congressman Lamborn Supports
Important Changes to Obamacare
3/12/14
On the
evening of Tuesday, March 11th, Congressman Doug Lamborn supported two
bills designed to help employers deal with the impacts of
Obamacare.
H.R. 3474
-
Hire More Heroes Act of 2013
amends
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow employers to exclude
employees who get their health care under TRICARE or from the Veterans
Administration from the calculations used to determine whether an employer
is an applicable large employer and therefore subject to the employer
mandate under
Obamacare.
H.R. 3979 -
Protecting
Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act of 2014
amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to ensure certain emergency
services volunteers are not counted when determining the number of
full-time employees or full-time equivalents of an employer for the
purposes of the employer mandate in
Obamacare.
"It is very important to help our
employers navigate through the tangled labyrinth of Obamacare
regulations. That's why I supported these two common-sense bills designed to
help our job creators more accurately account for the employees they
are obligated to cover under Obamacare. By hiring our veterans,
employers will be bringing on board hard-working individuals with exceptional
skill sets, all while avoiding onerous mandates. Additionally, H.R.
3979 prevents our much needed volunteer fire departments from enduring
additional hardships thanks to Obamacare's short sighted
mandates."

(CO-05)
