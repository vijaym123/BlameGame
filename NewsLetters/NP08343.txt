LEGISLATION
Dear Friend,
As summer driving season gets underway and chaos builds in the Middle
East, families in Oregon continue to pay more and more at the gas
station every time they fill up the tank. Everywhere I go in our state,
families, farmers, ranchers, and small business owners tell me just how
much of a burden skyrocketing energy prices are on their budgets.
According to AAA, gas prices in Oregon climbed again last week to a
statewide average of $3.93 per gallon, well above the national average
of $3.66 (making Oregon one of the top 10 most expensive states to buy
gas). That average could soon climb above $4.00 per gallon, something
we haven't seen since 2012.
As one southern Oregon resident told
Newswatch 12 in Medford last week
, "Half my grandkids live up
in Portland, and I won't get to see them as often as if gas was cheap.
It's just that easy."
There's a better way. Part of the solution to our energy problems is
smarter consumption to reduce demand.
But we simply must increase
supply of American energy to lower energy costs for consumers, create
good-paying jobs, and keep our nation more secure. America is on track
to become the world's leading energy superpower, but we must update our
laws and cut through federal red tape to make this dream a reality.
That's why this week the House debated and passed bipartisan bills that
seek to promote an "all of the above" energy strategy, including plans
to do the following:
-
Increase domestic energy production to reduce our dependence
on foreign oil and create good, family-wage jobs here at home.
-
Cut red tape to speed the processing of cross-border energy
infrastructure projects (like the Keystone XL pipeline).
-
Increase energy production beneath federally-owned lands.
-
Encourage schools and federal agencies to use energy more
efficiently
-
Help expedite natural gas exports to our allies around the
globe to counter the influence of bad actors like Vladimir Putin.

Families in Oregon don't need to pay more at the pump. We can increase
energy production to reduce prices so that Oregonians can keep more of
their hard-earned paychecks and make America more prosperous and
secure.
A path to 21st century cures
Most of us have family members or friends who are impacted by cancer or
other debilitating or deadly diseases. Of the 7,000 known diseases, we
have treatments for only 500 of them.
The Energy and Commerce Committee in the House has launched a new
initiative to harness new technology and innovation while reforming
slow-moving government bureaucracies to put us on a path to quicker
cures and better health care options that are patient centered.
One of the diseases there is no known cure for is pancreatic cancer. I
recently met with Linda Sindt, a retired Air Force Colonel from
Medford, who lost her husband to this terrible disease. Linda is
working hard as a volunteer for the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network to
"Stomp on Pancreatic Cancer," and her story is an inspiration to me and
countless others.
The good news is that health care innovation is moving at the speed of
the light, and America can be-and must be-the world's leader in new
treatments. Since the dawn of the 21st century, we have seen rapid
breakthroughs in how diseases are treated, managed, and even cured.
Too often, though, our laws don't keep pace with innovation. If we want
to continue to save lives and keep our nation as a leader in health
care innovation, we need to close the gap between the science of our
cures and the way the federal government regulates these treatments.
That's why the committee I serve on, the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, has begun this bipartisan project-"A Path To 21st Century
Cures"-to take a look at what steps Congress can take to accelerate the
pace of cures in the United States. We began the process with the first
of a series of roundtables to listen to some of the finest minds in
science and technology, and get their take on how we can expedite
innovation here at home.
This week, we held a roundtable with researchers about digital health
care in the 21st century, and I was proud that Dr. Brian Druker,
Director of the Knight Cancer Center at the Oregon Health and Science
University (OHSU), could join us to give his insights.

Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Rep. Fred Upton, Michigan)
(Lower photo:

Rep. Marsha Blackburn, Tennessee, and I listen.)
Dr. Druker is a true pioneer in the fight against cancer. His work on
medicines like Gleevec have turned a previously lethal cancer into a
manageable disease, saving countless lives. I was proud to have such an
accomplished Oregonian give his insights to our panel as we continue
our search for cures. To learn more about this landmark initiative,

The public should have more time to respond to new endangered species
regulations
Oregonians know how what a severe impact the Endangered Species Act
(ESA) has had on rural communities throughout the West. Northern
spotted owl critical habitat designations have already led to federal
timber harvests dropping by more than 90 percent in the last 30 years.
Facing an arbitrary court-ordered deadline of September 2015, rural
communities across eastern Oregon are rushing to prevent the listing of
the Greater sage-grouse under the ESA in hopes of avoiding the
detrimental economic impacts that have come along with species listings
elsewhere in the West.
Now, the Obama Administration is proposing to further expand their
authority under the ESA with little time for public input. Their three
proposed regulations would make sweeping changes to how the ESA is
implemented on the ground.
But the Administration has only given the public 60 days to learn about
the regulations and give input on them. Sixty days is simply not enough
time for the public to read, understand, and comment on these
proposals. Agencies often offer 90 or 120 day comment periods on
complex rules that could have significant economic impact. The
Administration must give rural citizens as much time as possible to
explain how these new rules could affect Oregon farms, ranches, and
communities.
That's why I'm calling on the Administration to give the public at
least six more months to discuss these regulations. Forty-two other
representatives from around the country have joined in this effort.
Click here to read our letter to the Fish and Wildlife Director and the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Director.
As we wrote in the letter, "As written, these rules could dramatically
increase the amount of private and public lands designated for habitat,
which in turn could result in blocking or slowing down an array of
agricultural, grazing, energy transmission and production,
transportation, and other activities on the more than 680 current
habitat designations and hundreds more slated to be finalized in the
next few years."
The Bulletin hit the nail on the head in their editorial on these
rules,
"Whatever the conclusion
about the regulations themselves, it's clear the time extension is the
right move. The ESA has had enormous impact - for good and bad - and
those affected by changes are entitled to the chance to effectively
respond before significant alternations are made."
Addressing the crisis at the Veterans Administration
Reports out of the Veterans Administration (VA) of veterans waiting too
long to get care continue to get worse. Oregonians are rightly outraged
by headlines like "Oregon VA clinics fare poorly in national audit"
and "VA
deaths covered up to make statistics look better, whistle-blower says."
Men and women who served
our nation in uniform deserve the best care possible, and the current
crisis at the VA is completely unacceptable.
That's why the House has acted to clean up this mess. We've passed
legislation to hold senior level managers at the VA accountable
for the agency's progress. And we unanimously passed the "Veterans
Access to Care Act," emergency legislation that seeks to help veterans
receive timely access to medical care. This plan would allow veterans
who have been waiting for an appointment more than 30 days the ability
to get timely care outside the VA system. The Senate has passed similar
legislation, and negotiators from both chambers are currently hammering
out a final version that will be sent to the President's desk to be
signed into law.
If you or a loved one are having trouble with the VA (or any federal
agency), call my office toll free from the 541 area code at
800-533-3303. I have three veterans on staff ready to assist you, and
I'll do everything I can to get results for you. I recently helped a
veteran in Bend who had been mugged and robbed of all his possessions.
My office helped him prove he had been discharged honorably from the
Army, tracked down a copy of his birth certificate, and is working with
him and the Bethlehem Inn homeless shelter in Bend to find permanent
housing for him.
That's all for this week. Next week, I'll meet with ranchers in Dufur
and hold a town hall in Wasco County before celebrating Independence
Day in Hood River. Have a great week.

Dear

As

That

A
path
to
21 st
century
cures
Most
of
us
have
family
members
or
friends
who
are
impacted
by
cancer
or
other
debilitating
or
deadly
diseases.
Of
the
7,000
known
diseases,
we
have
treatments
for
only
500
of
them.
The
Energy
and
Commerce
Committee
in
the
House
has
launched
a
new
initiative
to
harness
new
technology
and
innovation
while
reforming
slow-moving
government
bureaucracies
to
put
us
on
a
path
to
quicker
cures
and
better
health
care
options
that
are
patient
centered.
One
of
the
diseases
there
is
no
known
cure
for
is
pancreatic
cancer.
I
recently
met
with
Linda
Sindt,
a
retired
Air
Force
Colonel
from
Medford,
who
lost
her
husband
to
this
terrible
disease.
Linda
is
working
hard
as
a
volunteer
for
the
Pancreatic
Cancer
Action
Network
to
&#8220;Stomp
on
Pancreatic
Cancer,&#8221;
and
her
story
is
an
inspiration
to
me
and
countless
others.
The
good
news
is
that
health
care
innovation
is
moving
at
the
speed
of
the
light,
and
America
can
be&#8212;and
must
be&#8212;the
world&#8217;s
leader
in
new
treatments.
Since
the
dawn
of
the
21 st
century,
we
have
seen
rapid
breakthroughs
in
how
diseases
are
treated,
managed,
and
even
cured.
Too
often,
though,
our
laws
don&#8217;t
keep
pace
with
innovation.
If
we
want
to
continue
to
save
lives
and
keep
our
nation
as
a
leader
in
health
care
innovation,
we
need
to
close
the
gap
between
the
science
of
our
cures
and
the
way
the
federal
government
regulates
these
treatments.
That&#8217;s
why
the
committee
I
serve
on,
the
House
Energy
and
Commerce
Committee,
has
begun
this
bipartisan
project&#8212;&#8220;A
Path
To
21 st
Century
Cures&#8221;&#8212;to
take
a
look
at
what
steps
Congress
can
take
to
accelerate
the
pace
of

in
the
United

We

The

Oregonians
know
how
what
a
severe
impact
the
Endangered

(ESA)
has
had
on
rural
communities
throughout
the
West.
Northern
spotted

have
already
led
to
federal

about
the

Sixty
days
is
simply
not
enough

for
the

Agencies
often
offer
90
or
120
day
comment
periods
on
complex
rules
that
could
have
significant
economic
impact.
The
Administration
must
give
rural
citizens
as
much
time
as
possible
to
explain
how
these
new
rules
could
affect
Oregon
farms,
ranches,
and
communities.
That&#8217;s
why
I&#8217;m
calling
on
the
Administration
to
give
the
public
at
least
six
more
months
to
discuss
these
regulations.
Forty-two
other
representatives
from
around
the
country
have
joined
in
this
effort.
Click

to
read
our
letter
to
the
Fish
and
Wildlife
Director
and
the
National
Oceanic
and
Atmospheric
Administration
Director.
As
we
wrote
in
the
letter,
&#8220;As
written,
these
rules
could
dramatically
increase
the
amount
of
private
and
public
lands
designated
for
habitat,
which
in
turn
could
result
in
blocking
or
slowing
down
an
array
of
agricultural,
grazing,
energy
transmission
and
production,
transportation,
and
other
activities
on
the
more
than
680
current
habitat
designations
and
hundreds
more
slated
to
be
finalized
in
the
next
few
years.&#8221;
The
Bulletin
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
in
their
editorial
on
these
rules,
&#8220;Whatever
the
conclusion
about
the
regulations
themselves,
it&#8217;s
clear
the
time
extension
is
the
right
move.
The
ESA
has
had
enormous
impact
&#8212;
for
good
and
bad
&#8212;
and
those
affected
by
changes
are
entitled
to
the
chance
to
effectively
respond
before
significant
alternations
are
made.&#8221;
Addressing
the
crisis
at
the
Veterans
Administration
Reports
out
of
the
Veterans
Administration
(VA)
of
veterans
waiting
too
long
to
get
care
continue
to
get
worse.
Oregonians
are
rightly
outraged
by
headlines
like
&#8220;Oregon
VA
clinics
fare
poorly
in
national
audit&#8221;
and
&#8220;VA
deaths
covered
up
to
make
statistics
look
better,
whistle-blower
says.&#8221;
Men
and
women
who
served
our
nation
in
uniform
deserve
the
best
care
possible,
and
the
current
crisis
at
the
VA
is
completely
unacceptable.
That&#8217;s
why
the
House
has
acted
to
clean
up
this
mess.
We&#8217;ve
passed
legislation
to
hold
senior
level
managers
at
the
VA
accountable
for
the
agency&#8217;s
progress.
And
we
unanimously
passed
the
&#8220;Veterans
Access
to
Care
Act,&#8221;
emergency
legislation
that
seeks
to
help
veterans
receive
timely
access
to
medical
care.
This
plan
would
allow
veterans
who
have
been
waiting
for
an
appointment
more
than
30
days
the
ability
to
get
timely
care
outside
the
VA
system.
The
Senate
has
passed
similar
legislation,
and
negotiators
from
both
chambers
are
currently
hammering
out
a
final
version
that
will
be
sent
to
the
President&#8217;s
desk
to
be
signed
into
law.
If
you
or
a
loved
one
are
having
trouble
with
the
VA
(or
any
federal
agency),
call
my
office
toll
free
from
the
541
area
code
at
800-533-3303.
I
have
three
veterans
on
staff
ready
to
assist
you,
and
I&#8217;ll
do
everything
I
can
to
get
results
for
you.
I
recently
helped
a
veteran
in
Bend
who
had
been
mugged
and
robbed
of
all
his
possessions.
My
office
helped
him
prove
he
had
been
discharged
honorably
from
the
Army,
tracked
down
a
copy
of
his
birth
certificate,
and
is
working
with
him
and
the
Bethlehem
Inn
homeless
shelter
in
Bend
to
find
permanent
housing
for
him.
That&#8217;s
all
for
this
week.
Next
week,
I&#8217;ll
meet
with
ranchers
in
Dufur
and
hold
a
town
hall
in
Wasco

celebrating
Independence

Have
a
great
