You came through for us in 2008.
And then again in 2012.
But here&rsquo;s the deal, David: everything we&rsquo;ve done so far is at stake right now.
Republicans in Congress are counting on big oil SuperPACs to buy them victory this November. But we have a secret weapon that could put them in their place:
YOU. Add your name David to commit to vote this November!
The choice facing voters has never been more clear: either we elect a congress that will work with President Obama, or spend the next two years dealing with even more Republican brinkmanship.
We need to get 1,000,000 people to commit to vote this November. We already have 336,587 commitments. Can we count on you to be number 336,588, David? Make your commitment to vote today: http://1MillionVotesfor2014.com
