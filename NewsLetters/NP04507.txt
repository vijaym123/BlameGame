In 6 years under President Barack Obama, we&rsquo;ve made incredible progress as a country.
Often in the face of incredible obstruction, the President has continued to fight for us and lead us forward. Will you add your name now and say that you&rsquo;re still standing with President Obama in his final two years in office?
