Dear Friend,
With Christmas just weeks away and Americans shopping for family and
friends, Congress was at work, trying to complete some important
legislation for the people of this country.
First and foremost, Congress has approved the National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2014 to defend our country and
to adequately fund America's men and women in uniform. The bill now
goes to the Senate.
This important piece of legislation provides the needed resources for
America to protect itself and to protect Americans in dangerous parts
of the world by supporting and protecting this country's warfighters
and military families. The NDAA not only protects America today, but
prepares our nation for future threats, and does so by controlling
costs and making wise choices. To that end, our legislation prohibits
the Department of Defense from initiating another round of Base
Realignment and Closure (BRAC). It also maintains the prohibition
against transfer of suspected terrorists from Guantanamo Bay to the
United States and the prohibition on construction of detention
facilities for terrorists in the United States.
I am pleased that the bill will provide Fort Leonard Wood and Whiteman
Air Force base with the resources they need to protect our country.
Fort Leonard Wood and Whiteman Air Force Base, combined, will benefit
from more than $100 million in military construction funds approved as
part of the base bill.
Also included in the bill is a prohibition on making additional A-10
aircraft retirements before December 31, 2014. This proactive step will
allow Congress time to conduct oversight and to consider what actions
to take on any force structure changes the Air Force may propose in
Fiscal Year 2015. Premature divestment of the A-10 by the Air Force
would create a dangerous close air support capability gap that could
unnecessarily endanger American service members in future conflicts.
On another important matter, the House and Senate have agreed on a
budget that begins the task of reducing the federal deficit while
safeguarding national security by reinstating some of the scheduled
defense cuts.
This budget bill reduces the deficit by roughly $23 billion without
raising taxes. The agreement falls short of securing everything I would
like to have in the budget, but with divided government in Washington,
it is a step in the right direction.
In addition to reducing the deficit, over the next two years this
budget restores $30 billion in previously reduced national defense
funding - reversing some of the sequester's arbitrary across-the-board
cuts that negatively impact our military. As a member of the House
Armed Services Committee and a strong supporter of our men and women in
uniform, I am pleased that this budget safeguards our national defense,
which is one of the primary responsibilities of the federal government.
This agreement will also provide certainty by averting a government
shutdown in January. This is good for all Americans as it breaks
Washington's pattern of lurching from crisis to crisis. It is not
everything we want, but it strengthens our military readiness while
cutting spending, and that's good for America.
On another important matter, House and Senate negotiators have made
significant progress on a comprehensive Farm Bill, but winter weather
in Washington, D.C. and last minute policy changes prevented the
Congressional Budget Office from providing the cost analysis the
negotiators needed to complete work on the Farm Bill before the end of
the year. I am optimistic that the House and Senate will be taking up
the Farm Bill once Congress returns in early January and provide a
five-year farm bill that saves taxpayers billions of dollars and
provides a safety net for farmers during times of extreme weather or
catastrophic market failure. This week, the House passed a short,
one-month long extension of the current bill to ensure certainty for
consumers and farmers in Missouri as negotiators iron out the final
differences.
Finally, I was privileged this week to present Texas Congressman John
Carter with petition signatures collected from Missourians who support
his Honoring the Fort Hood Heroes Act, H.R. 3111, which I co-sponsor.
It's a bill to have the Fort Hood attack declared what it is; a
terrorist attack. The fact is that during his trial former Army
psychiatrist Major Nidal Hasan acknowledged his jihadist actions as he
killed or wounded soldiers at Fort Hood, Texas in November of 2009. I
was recently given the signatures of over 100 veterans at an event in
Sedalia. They join me in the desire to have the despicable action
declared an act of terror so that the Purple Heart Medal is presented
posthumously to those killed as well as to the survivors of this
horrendous action. I pray justice will be served and the victims and
their families will receive the benefits they deserve.
Have a great week.
Sincerely,
Vicky Hartzler
Member of Congress

Dear
Friend,
With
Christmas
just
weeks
away
and
Americans
shopping
for
family
and
friends,
Congress
was
at
work,
trying
to
complete
some
important
legislation
for
the
people
of
this
country.
First
and
foremost,
Congress
has
approved
the
National
Defense
Authorization
Act
(NDAA)
for
Fiscal
Year
2014
to
defend
our
country
and
to
adequately
fund
America&#8217;s
men
and
women
in
uniform.
The
bill
now
goes
to
the
Senate.
This
important
piece
of
legislation
provides
the
needed
resources
for
America
to
protect
itself
and
to
protect
Americans
in
dangerous
parts
of
the
world
by
supporting
and
protecting
this
country&#8217;s
warfighters
and
military
families.
The
NDAA
not
only
protects
America
today,
but
prepares
our
nation
for
future
threats,
and
does
so
by
controlling
costs
and
making
wise
choices.
To
that
end,
our
legislation
prohibits
the
Department
of
Defense
from
initiating
another
round
of
Base
Realignment
and
Closure
(BRAC).
It
also
maintains
the
prohibition
against
transfer
of
suspected
terrorists
from
Guantanamo
Bay
to
the
United
States
and
the
prohibition
on
construction
of
detention
facilities
for
terrorists
in
the
United
States.
I
am
pleased
that
the
bill
will
provide
Fort
Leonard
Wood
and
Whiteman
Air
Force
base
with
the
resources
they
need
to
protect
our
country.
Fort
Leonard
Wood
and
Whiteman
Air
Force
Base,
combined,
will
benefit
from
more
than
$100
million
in
military
construction
funds
approved
as
part
of
the
base
bill.
Also
included
in
the
bill
is
a
prohibition
on
making
additional
A-10
aircraft
retirements
before
December
31,
2014.
This
proactive
step
will
allow
Congress
time
to
conduct
oversight
and
to
consider
what
actions
to
take
on
any
force
structure
changes
the
Air
Force
may
propose
in
Fiscal
Year
2015.
Premature
divestment
of
the
A-10
by
the
Air
Force
would
create
a
dangerous
close
air
support
capability
gap
that
could
unnecessarily
endanger
American
service
members
in
future
conflicts.
On
another
important
matter,
the
House
and
Senate
have
agreed
on
a
budget
that
begins
the
task
of
reducing
the
federal
deficit
while
safeguarding
national
security
by
reinstating
some
of
the
scheduled
defense
cuts.
This
budget
bill
reduces
the
deficit
by
roughly
$23
billion
without
raising
taxes.
The
agreement
falls
short
of
securing
everything
I
would
like
to
have
in
the
budget,
but
with
divided
government
in
Washington,
it
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction.
In
addition
to
reducing
the
deficit,
over
the
next
two
years
this
budget
restores
$30
billion
in
previously
reduced
national
defense
funding
&#8211;
reversing
some
of
the
sequester&#8217;s
arbitrary
across-the-board
cuts
that
negatively
impact
our
military.
As
a
member
of
the
House
Armed
Services
Committee
and
a
strong
supporter
of
our
men
and
women
in
uniform,
I
am
pleased
that
this
budget
safeguards
our
national
defense,
which
is
one
of
the
primary
responsibilities
of
the
federal
government.
This
agreement
will
also
provide
certainty
by
averting
a
government
shutdown
in
January.
This
is
good
for
all
Americans
as
it
breaks
Washington&#8217;s
pattern
of
lurching
from
crisis
to
crisis.
It
is
not
everything
we
want,
but
it
strengthens
our
military
readiness
while
cutting
spending,
and
that&#8217;s
good
for
America.
On
another
important
matter,
House
and
Senate
negotiators
have
made
significant
progress
on
a
comprehensive
Farm
Bill,
but
winter
weather
in
Washington,
D.C.
and
last
minute
policy
changes
prevented
the
Congressional
Budget
Office
from
providing
the
cost
analysis
the
negotiators
needed
to
complete
work
on
the
Farm
Bill
before
the
end
of
the
year.
I
am
optimistic
that
the
House
and
Senate
will
be
taking
up
the
Farm
Bill
once
Congress
returns
in
early
January
and
provide
a
five-year
farm
bill
that
saves
taxpayers
billions
of
dollars
and
provides
a
safety
net
for
farmers
during
times
of
extreme
weather
or
catastrophic
market
failure.
This
week,
the
House
passed
a
short,
one-month
long
extension
of
the
current
bill
to
ensure
certainty
for
consumers
and
farmers
in
Missouri
as
negotiators
iron
out
the
final
differences.
Finally,
I
was
privileged
this
week
to
present
Texas
Congressman
John
Carter
with
petition
signatures
collected
from
Missourians
who
support
his
Honoring
the
Fort
Hood
Heroes
Act,
H.R.
3111,
which
I
co-sponsor.
It&#8217;s a
bill
to
have
the
Fort
Hood
attack
declared
what
it
is;
a
terrorist
attack.
The
fact
is
that
during
his
trial
former
Army
psychiatrist
Major
Nidal
Hasan
acknowledged
his
jihadist
actions
as
he
killed
or
wounded
soldiers
at
Fort
Hood,
Texas
in
November
of
2009.
I
was
recently
given
the
signatures
of
over
100
veterans
at
an
event
in
Sedalia.
They
join
me
in
the
desire
to
have
the
despicable
action
declared
an

of
terror
so
that
the
Purple
Heart
Medal
is
presented
posthumously
to
those
killed
as
well
as
to
the
survivors
of
this
horrendous
action.
I
pray
justice
will
be
served
and
the
victims
and
their
families
will
receive
the
benefits
they
deserve.
Have
a
great
