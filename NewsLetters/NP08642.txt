In order to enhance the service we provide to you, weve launched Instagram and LinkedIn accounts. I encourage you to follow those accounts by clicking on the words
Instagram
or
LinkedIn
or by clicking on the Instagram and LinkedIn icons on the right-hand side of this email.
In addition to Instagram and LinkedIn, I encourage you to follow our other social media accounts to see the most current information about what's happening in Pennsylvania's 4th Congressional District and Washington, D.C. By clicking on the Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, and LinkedIn images on the right-hand side, you'll be able to follow me via social media, which will allow you to receive the most current information while saving hard-earned tax dollars on postage and printing costs. Again, you can "like" my official Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube accounts by clicking on the images to the right or by simply clicking on the words
Facebook ,
Twitter ,
Instagram ,
LinkedIn , or
YouTube .
Sincerely,
Scott G. Perry
