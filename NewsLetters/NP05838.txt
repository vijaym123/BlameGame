David -- there was a lot of argument here on whether we should admit our shortfall on this one. But in the end, it&rsquo;s better to just come clean. So here&rsquo;s the truth:
We fell short.
Despite emails from President Obama and Hillary Clinton&hellip;we just couldn&rsquo;t get it done.
We set the most aggressive fundraising goal we&rsquo;ve ever had. We even beat our original goal.
But we were forced to raise our projections yesterday when news broke that Republicans put in 12 million dollars in the last two weeks alone.
But we still needed to get the job done.
We can no longer afford to leave anything on the table. So, we are making an emergency extension of the triple-match TODAY ONLY.
**EMERGENCY EXTENSION**
TRIPLE-MATCH STATUS: ACTIVE UNTIL 11:59pm (today only)
We still need 11 donors from 60659 zip code
to make a TRIPLE-MATCHED gift by midnight if we want any chance of victory in this election. We're pleading, David. Can you step up right now? 1-DAY MATCH EXTENSION: All Donations Today
Triple-Matched! Chip in $5 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $35 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $50 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $100 immediately &gt;&gt; Chip in $250 immediately &gt;&gt; Or click here to donate another amount.
