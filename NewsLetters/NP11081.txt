Dear Fellow Nevadan,
Today, we honor an
American hero who dedicated his life to improving working conditions
for farm workers, and defended labor rights for all Americans.
Although Cesar Chavez is no longer with us, we must carry on his legacy by
creating jobs for the middle class, restoring long term unemployment
insurance for those who lost their jobs through no fault of their own,
making sure all workers earn fair pay for their work, and stopping the
separation of families by passing immigration reform.
Eliseo
Medina, who worked alongside Cesar Chavez during the 1970s, honors
his legacy today by fasting and organizing communities across the nation
to join the fight against the separation of families. As Eliseo and
all of us celebrate the life of this iconic American, we must work to
protect his legacy and continue to fight for every American family, in
Nevada and every state, to have the opportunity to achieve the
American Dream and to stay united as a family.
