Was it wise for Congress to vote on a clean debt ceiling proposal with
no strings attached?
Yes - When it comes to the full faith and credit of the United States,
Congress should focus solely on being able to pay its bills on time
Maybe - Congress still had two more weeks to debate the issue; they
should have waited a little longer to weigh the options
No - The debt ceiling proposal should have been tied to the defunding
or consolidation of other government programs, such as the Affordable
Care Act.

The full faith and credit of the United States would have been in
jeopardy after February 27 if both the House and Senate did not agree
to raise the debt ceiling. According to U.S.Treasury Secretary Jack Lew
, this would have devastating effects on our economy, as it would have
had resulted in our country being unable to pay its bills on time.
Thankfully, the House voted Tuesday to responsibly raise the debt
ceiling without adding any last minute policy riders - meaning we voted
on a proposal that dealt with the issue at hand-the debt ceiling-with
"no strings attached." To help ensure that we maintain the full faith
and credit of the United States, I voted "yes." The legislation passed
221 to 201.
This week, I had planned to vote "no" on the ironically misnamed
Consumer Financial Protection Safety and Soundness Improvement Act,
which if passed, would have actually harmed consumer protections and
sought to undermine and defund the highly effective Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau. Thankfully the proposed legislation was pulled for
the time being.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is a landmark agency created
by the Dodd-Frank Act to oversee consumer financial markets, and it is
the only financial regulator focused exclusively on consumer
protection. The Bureau, for example, has refunded more than $3 billion
to nearly 10 million consumers and U.S. military service members whom
have experienced financial or consumer fraud.
It has also begun to
achieve resolution for over 269,000 consumer complaints received
through its website.
The Bureau is critical in upholding strong consumer protections, and I
will continue to ensure it is maintained.
It is my distinct honor and privilege to announce the 47thDistrict
nominations for the U.S. Service Academy. Everyone in the 47th District
can be proud that we have so many talented, high-achieving students who
wish to serve our nation as future leaders of the armed forces and
merchant marine.
Entrance to The US Military, Navy, Air Force and Merchant Marine
service academies requires nomination by a Member of Congress or the
Vice-President. Acceptance at an Academy involves at least a five-year
obligation to the Service after four years at the Academy. Appointments
in the 47th District are very competitive, and the members of my
Service Academy Nomination Panel - composed of military veterans and
academy graduates - were instrumental in the interview and selection
process.
Final decisions will be made by the U.S. Military, Naval, Air Force,
and Merchant Marine Academies as they consider each of these talented
and dedicated nominees from the 47th District for admission.
The nominees are:
United States Military Academy at West Point, New York
