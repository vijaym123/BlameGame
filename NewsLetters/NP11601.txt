The Hill Report
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of March 10 - 14, 2014
This week, the House approved two bills to rein in the Administration's
unrestrained executive overreach.
The Constitution clearly states that
once laws are enacted, the president is tasked with responsibly
enforcing them. However, throughout his presidency, President Obama has
chosen to selectively enforce the law or sidestep Congress through
executive action to push his political priorities. Most recently, the
president unilaterally delayed or modified several parts of ObamaCare
due to the law's devastating impact on families and businesses.
In response to the president overstepping the boundaries of his
constitutional authority, the House passed the ENFORCE the Law Act
and the Faithful
Execution of the Law Act
. These bills
restore balance to the separation of powers by implementing tools for
Congress to hold the president and any federal official accountable for
failing to faithfully execute the law.
These important bills would
prevent the troublesome expansion of executive power that we've
witnessed from the current Administration and provide the American
people with certainty that the laws on the books will be followed.
SGR Reform
On Friday, the House passed H.R. 4015, the SGR Repeal and Medicare
Provider Payment Modernization Act.
As you may know, our nation's
current Medicare reimbursement formula - the Sustainable Growth Rate
(SGR) - is outdated and unstable for seniors and their physicians.
Unless Congress takes immediate action, Medicare providers will see a
nearly 24 percent reduction in their reimbursement rates, which would
dramatically reduce seniors' access to health care and jeopardize the
future of Medicare.
In response, today the House approved a bipartisan, bicameral proposal
that represents years of work by Congress to address this important
issue and provide certainty for those who rely upon Medicare.
This
proposal is also fully paid for by delaying ObamaCare's individual
mandate, ensuring that this legislative fix won't add to our long term
debt.
I'm proud of the House's work this week to reform our Medicare
payment system and protect our nation's seniors while also reducing
wasteful spending. To read the bill, click here

City Council Meetings
In addition to legislative business, I was delighted to welcome City
Council members from both Dallas and Garland to Washington this week.
On Tuesday, I had the pleasure of taking the Mayor of Garland and other
city officials on a night tour of the Capitol. During the tour, we also
had the chance to talk about the Council's priorities for the year and
how we can collaborate to work toward our shared goal of making North
Texas a better place to work and live.

On Wednesday, I had the opportunity to meet with Dallas City Council
members and city officials. During our meeting we discussed the
progress of the Trinity River Corridor Project, MAP - 21
reauthorization, local government grant programs, and a variety of
other issues. I always value the opportunity to sit down with local
officials and discuss how we can work together to accomplish the city's
federal legislative priorities.

Special Olympics Texas
On Wednesday, I was pleased to join Special Olympics Texas athletes and
representatives for breakfast during their annual visit to Capitol
Hill. I enjoyed talking with the athletes about their athletic
achievements and sharing stories about my son Alex's experiences with
Special Olympics sports. Special Olympics offers individuals with
special needs a unique opportunity to develop to the best of their
abilities, and I'm extremely grateful for the opportunity to meet with
them each year.

Texas Special Olympics
As a member of the Special Olympics Texas President's Advisory Council,
I will continue to support the Special Olympics and promote policies in
Congress that will create more opportunities for individuals with
disabilities.
Have a good weekend.
Sincerely,
Pete Sessions
Member of Congress

A
Weekly
Newsletter
from
Congressman
Pete
Sessions
Week
of
March

&#8211;
14,
2014
This
week,
the
House
approved
two
bills
to
rein
in
the
Administration&#8217;s
unrestrained
executive
overreach.
The
Constitution
clearly
states
that
once
laws
are
enacted,
the
president
is
tasked
with
responsibly
enforcing
them.
However,
throughout
his
presidency,
President
Obama
has
chosen
to
selectively
enforce
the
law
or
sidestep
Congress
through
executive
action
to
push
his
political
priorities.
Most
recently,
the
president
unilaterally
delayed
or
modified
several
parts
of
ObamaCare
due
to
the
law&#8217;s
devastating
impact
on
families
and
businesses.
In
response
to
the
president
overstepping
the
boundaries
of
his
constitutional
authority,
the
House
passed
the
ENFORCE
the
Law
Act
and
the
Faithful

of
the
Law
Act .
These
bills
restore

to
the

by
implementing

Congress

any

for

These
important
bills
would
prevent
the

expansion
of
executive
power
that
we&#8217;ve

the

Administration
and
provide
the
American

SGR
Reform
On
Friday,
the
House
passed
H.R.
4015,
the
SGR
Repeal
and
Medicare
Provider
Payment
Modernization
Act .
As
you
may
know,
our
nation&#8217;s
current
Medicare
reimbursement
formula
&#8211;
the
Sustainable
Growth
Rate
(SGR)
&#8211;
is
outdated
and
unstable
for
seniors
and
their
physicians.
Unless
Congress
takes
immediate
action,
Medicare
providers
will
see
a
nearly
24
percent
reduction
in
their
reimbursement
rates,
which
would
dramatically
reduce
seniors&#8217;
access
to
health
care
and
jeopardize
the
future
of
Medicare.
In
response,
today
the
